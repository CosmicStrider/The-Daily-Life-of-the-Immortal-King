  <h1>Chapter 854 Wang Ling's Display of Anger</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was clear when some people were angry, and they expressed it in the following ways: increased adrenaline, a flushed face and labored breathing, enlarged pores, glowering eyes, hair standing on end, a racing heart, voting for Kuxuan's new book and so on...</p>

    <p>And there were some who tended to handle things in a cold manner, adopting a supremely dismissive stance.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling's expression darkened, Fang Xing could already sense that Wang Ling was angry. Although Wang Ling usually spoke little and had a poker face, his supreme disdain when he was angry was completely different.</p>

    <p>One of the clearest signs was a drop in temperature. The air-conditioning in the gym was set at just 25°C, which was the most comfortable temperature, but the teachers watching the match couldn't help curling in on themselves.</p>

    <p>"What's going on? Why is it suddenly so cold?"</p>

    <p>A female teacher sneezed and was astonished when the air she breathed out turned into white vapor.</p>

    <p>"Is the air-conditioning broken?" A male teacher also felt a little cold, and immediately picked up the transmission talisman in his hand. "Attention, logistics department, turn off the air-conditioning!"</p>

    <p>The teacher in the logistics department was blank. This absolutely wasn't a problem with the air-conditioning, which was working normally! However, he couldn't explain the dramatic drop in temperature inside the gym. He had taken a look at the indoor thermostat just now, and it was already -3°C...</p>

    <p>Li Hao's punch was extremely ferocious, but the moment his fist approached Wang Ling, he could clearly feel a chill penetrate his body, which made him unable to display the true power of this punch - it felt like all his muscles were frozen and stuck!</p>

    <p>"How can this be..."</p>

    <p>Li Hao scowled as he felt his body slow down.</p>

    <p>"Don't look down on others."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing stepped forward of his own accord to meet Li Hao's punch.</p>

    <p>Actually, the punch wasn't that strong, but Fang Xing took it basically to protect Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Because people tended to lose all rationality when they were angry...</p>

    <p>If Li Hao had hit Wang Ling with that punch, the power of the backlash alone from Wang Ling's Sage Body would have caused Li Hao's arm to directly explode into fine dust.</p>

    <p>"There's something strange about these two students." After observing for a while on the side, Li Diao grabbed the front of Li Hao's shirt and took a step back.</p>

    <p>Li Hao was huge and stood there looking like a small mountain, but Li Diao lifted him up as if he was a chicken.</p>

    <p>Li Hao's body was trembling because of the chill.</p>

    <p>Vampires had already evolved to no longer fear the sun, but the cold instead. They were originally a race that depended on fresh blood to survive. The cold slowed down their blood circulation, hampering their movements and even slowing down their reactions.</p>

    <p>Li Hao could be considered a young vampire. The strength of a vampire enabled him to surpass the realm he was meant to have at his level, but fear of the cold was his weakness.</p>

    <p>Angering Wang Ling in this battle unexpectedly brought out this weakness of Li Hao's.</p>

    <p>"Utterly useless." Li Diao looked at his disappointment of a son and felt the urge to step on and burst his balls. In any case, vampires had a strong regenerative ability, so they would fill out again even after being crushed.</p>

    <p>He used the power of his own blood to help Li Hao's blood circulate and manually increase the blood flow.</p>

    <p>It was such a comfortable feeling.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Li Hao started to miss a drink popular among vampires — tampon coffee. The extreme cold made him miss the feeling of a hot cup of tampon coffee. The tampon's dense clots of blood mixed into the black coffee was a drink for the nobles that was hard to come by in the whole of the vampire race.</p>

    <p>When Li Hao came back to his senses, he was dazed when he saw that his father was holding him. "Father..."</p>

    <p>He had blacked out just now!</p>

    <p>Because of the excessive cold!</p>

    <p>Fortunately, Li Diao handled the situation in time to make it look less embarrassing; it appeared as if the father was helping to pull his son some distance away from the fight to prepare for the next attack.</p>

    <p>"Before I crush your balls like lightbulbs, you better show some vigor..." Li Diao gazed at Li Hao with eyes like a viper poised to strike, making Li Hao quiver as he instantly woke up.</p>

    <p>At that point, Li Hao finally realized that the two Number 60 High elite students in front of him weren't opponents that were easy to deal with...</p>

    <p>This sudden drop in temperature was definitely their doing!</p>

    <p>However, only Li Hao and Li Diao were aware of this stifling feeling, since the battle was confined within the barrier, and the teachers responsible for monitoring battle progress were standing outside the barrier. Although they could sense the abnormal change in temperature, they definitely weren't feeling it as keenly as Li Hao inside the barrier.</p>

    <p>The temperature outside the barrier was -3°C, but inside, it was dozens of degrees below zero...</p>

    <p>"Damn! They actually made me lose face in front of my father!" Li Hao clenched his teeth fiercely, and his anger caused his blood to flow more quickly. Coupled with the strength Li Diao had poured into his body, Li Hao's fighting strength after he was provoked soared in an instant.</p>

    <p>An increased blood flow for vampires meant faster speeds, quicker reactions, and greater power...</p>

    <p>"Go, defeat him! Especially the one that grew up eating junk food!" Li Diao narrowed his eyes as he gazed at Wang Ling, full of confidence in his son.</p>

    <p>As soon as he said the words, Li Diao realized all of a sudden that his surroundings seemed to have frozen, almost like... a time freeze?</p>

    <p>This was an extremely strange scene, as the entire world quieted down after the time freeze...</p>

    <p>Except for Fang Xing and Li Diao, everyone else in that moment was frozen, including Li Hao.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling..." Fang Xing was frightened by this power. To actually directly freeze time for the whole world... How many people under the sun could do this?</p>

    <p>In that moment, no one was more petrified than Li Diao...</p>

    <p>The power to freeze time...</p>

    <p>In the history of his Li family, there was once a family head called "Dior" who was once defeated by a force called "World"... That "World" back then was a power similar to a time freeze, but it was only for five seconds.</p>

    <p>But now, it had already been a few minutes...</p>

    <p>Time was still immobile!</p>

    <p>Danger!</p>

    <p>Li Diao instinctively sensed the danger. He wanted to grab Li Hao and retreat, only to realize that a tremendous pressure was preventing his own body from moving!</p>

    <p>Then, Wang Ling walked toward Li Diao step by step.</p>

    <p>"So it's you..." Li Diao broke into a cold sweat.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling wasn't in a hurry to act.</p>

    <p>He stretched out his hand, and a space opened in the air — noodles, come!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling directly took out a regular crispy noodle snack packet.</p>

    <p>Then, he opened it, added the pepper seasoning, and crushed the crispy noodle snack evenly.</p>

    <p>Li Diao still had no idea what the young man was planning to do.</p>

    <p>The next moment, Wang Ling directly grasped Li Diao's jaw and poured the crispy noodle snack into his mouth...</p>
