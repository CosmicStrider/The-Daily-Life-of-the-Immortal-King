  <h1>Chapter 459 Newbies Are Monsters! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at this number one fan "Brother Sleep's" bullet message for a long time. Somehow, the other party felt familiar; the tone and style of his words gave Wang Ling a sense of deja vu.</p>

    <p>While he lowered his head, lost in thought, he saw that the bullet messages in Daoist Guang's live stream had once again maxed out after Daoist Guang had joined forces with a passerby little brother.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had to filter the bullet messages.</p>

    <p>The bullet messages in Daoist Guang's live stream had increased to such a frightening amount; if they weren't controlled, the game couldn't even be seen anymore!</p>

    <p>In the game, Daoist Guang and this Little Brother GAYLIGAYQI hadn't moved and were still crouched on the top of the tower.</p>

    <p>A moment later, viewers in the live stream heard this little brother exclaim, "What the hell! Brother expert, you're really actually a live streamer!"</p>

    <p>He had never heard the name "Lord Island"- obviously, this was a new live streamer. Little Brother GAYLIGAYQI was a big fan of watching live streams, and there was no way he wouldn't know the veteran live streamers.</p>

    <p>Of course, the little brother wasn't discriminating against newbies! He just thought that it was really a little too scary that a new live streamer he had never heard of could perform this level of body movement!</p>

    <p>Sure enough! The newbies nowadays were all monsters!</p>

    <p>Then the little brother looked at the current number of people in the live stream room and felt like he couldn't breathe as he was shocked once again...</p>

    <p>Nearly five million people!!!</p>

    <p>A new live streamer...</p>

    <p>How had he done it?</p>

    <p>In the live stream, a string of bullet messages immediately flew past.</p>

    <p>"Congratulations, little brother, you're on TV!"</p>

    <p>" <em>Hehehe </em>, little brother, did you come here to check out the room? Are you happy? Are you surprised? Are you thrilled?"</p>

    <p>"Good luck, little brother! Lord Island will lead you to first place! Steady on! The two of you can win this!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>The little brother chose to turn off the bullet messages for the time being as they were blocking the screen. He looked at the "Brother Expert" whose face was densely covered with the bullet messages.</p>

    <p>For someone to be able to perform such a precise operation, he had thought that it was perhaps a young little brother player; he had never ever expected the person sitting in front of a screen in the live stream to be a grandfather whose hair and beard were all gray! As a grandfather live streamer... his voice sounded too young! It was too magnetic! And too nice to listen to!</p>

    <p>Voice wasn't a strict condition to be a live streamer, but it was a bonus, especially for some "voice-cons"; a pleasant-sounding voice could indeed bring in a lot of fans.</p>

    <p>Thus, Daoist Guang had altered his voice, but not with a voice converter. Instead, it was a large-scale beautifying sound wave spell which could combine elements of each viewer's imagination in their minds to create Daoist Guang's voice for them.</p>

    <p>In other words, each of the almost five million viewers in the live stream room now were hearing different versions of Daoist Guang's voice.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had seen through this trick from the very beginning. After all, Daoist Guang was a True Immortal, and casting a spell of this level was really too easy for him.</p>

    <p>However, this kind of beautifying sound wave spell had completely no effect on Wang Ling; the voice he was hearing now was still Daoist Guang's original voice.</p>

    <p>It was deep, with the flavor of rich experience...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>The little brother collected his thoughts.</p>

    <p>He was still in the game, so he didn't spend too long in the live stream room. He quickly turned off his phone and focused his attention on the game in front of him once again.</p>

    <p>Little Brother GAYLIGAYQI's heart was still shaking at the live stream's huge popularity just now... Five million people! Everybody was watching him!</p>

    <p>The little brother's heart was beating so fast that he could hardly speak properly. "Bro... Brother expert, how long have you been a live streamer?"</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang: "Less than a week."</p>

    <p>The little brother took a breath. "Then are you a <em>majia </em>...?"</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang: "A <em>majia </em>? What's that?" As an old man thousands of years old who had been "dead" for a period of time, and who had only just recently encountered the Internet, Daoist Guang was still not very clear on a lot of online jargon.</p>

    <p>The little brother sweated and explained to Daoist Guang. " <em>Majia </em>means an alternate account."</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang: "Oh, no. I'm really just a <em>mengxin <sup>1</sup> </em>."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The literal translation is 'cute
and new,' and basically refers
to newbies.)</dfn>

    <p>The little brother: "..."</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang: "Anyway, doesn't 'alternate account' also mean peeing <sup>2</sup> ?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(The term for 'alternate
account' in Chinese also has
the meaning 'to pee'.)</dfn>

    <p>"Pft!" The little brother laughed.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling couldn't help looking at the bullet messages, and a group of troublemakers were already flooding the screen with "Huaxiu nation's culture is extensive and profound" messages...</p>

    <p>Little Brother GAYLIGAYQI now suddenly understood why Daoist Guang was so popular as a new live streamer!</p>

    <p>He was funny and had pretty good skills. Unlike other live streamers, he was able to find another way to have fun in this type of shooting game, and was relying on just a katana to kill twenty people... this was a real gimmick!</p>

    <p>The most important thing was that he was unexpectedly a grandfather with a very nice voice!</p>

    <p>If he hadn't seen the live stream, Little Brother GAYLIGAYQI would have really thought that Lord Island was a youngster.</p>

    <p>It was over! This little brother realized he had already become a fan of Daoist Guang!</p>

    <p>These days, there were truly very few live streamers who performed well, were talented, and had a nice voice!</p>

    <p>Little Brother decided that as soon as he finished this round, he would subscribe to the live stream!</p>

    <p>Therefore, in order to leave a good impression on Lord Island, he had to perform well!</p>

    <p>Thinking this, Little Brother GAYLIGAYQI took a deep breath. "Lord Island, what should we do now? I am yours to command!"</p>

    <p>He had already picked up the equipment he had thrown on the floor earlier, and was fully armed.</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang felt that the tower they were in was a very good position. It was open in all directions and could be considered the best vantage point in the city with the widest view. Furthermore, looking at the map, Daoist Guang thought that the tower they were in was probably the final "god-blessed circle."</p>

    <p>Generally speaking, however, no one would choose to make a stand here, because once someone threw a grenade over here, the tower would explode, leading directly to death.</p>

    <p>But Daoist Guang wasn't afraid.</p>

    <p>However many grenades were thrown at them, he would receive them all with his frying pan.</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang listened carefully, then pointed the katana in one direction where he had heard movement. "Someone is in that direction. Be careful when you turn the corner into the alley and look for cover. Just lure them in, you don't have to be so enthusiastic about fighting. I'll use a ball <sup>3</sup> as much as possible!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(A ball formation is a number
of units moving together as
one group.)</dfn>

    <p>Viewers: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..." What damn ball!</p>

    <p>"Very well!" The little brother nodded and was about to have his character go down the tower.</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang was surprised and stopped him. "Wait! Do you have heal items?"</p>

    <p>The little brother paused. "Yes, four Med Kits and drinks."</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang couldn't help laughing. "You should restore your health before you go."</p>

    <p>"Man! I almost forgot!" Little Brother GAYLIGAYQI patted himself on the head! He had been too excited just now, he had forgotten to heal himself! As a result, he still had only half of his health until now.</p>

    <p>For some reason, Wang Ling felt that Daoist Guang and this little brother were a little adorable in how different they were.</p>

    <p>Before he left, the little brother looked back and asked Daoist Guang, "Lord Island, my mission is to just attract people, right?"</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang nodded. "Yes, then try to protect yourself after that and come back to the tower later to find me."</p>

    <p>"Okay! It's just luring people in! Leave it to me, Lord Island, I used to do this before." The little brother rushed out in high spirits.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Daoist Guang were both stupefied.</p>

    <p>Used to do?</p>

    <p>After leaving Daoist Guang, this little brother then fired his gun directly into the air as he shouted at the same time. "Come, come, take a look, find out how swimming keeps you fit <sup>4</sup> ..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>4</sup>(This is a sales slogan that
became a sarcastic or mocking
way of greeting people ..)</dfn>

    <p>Daoist Guang: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
