  <h1>Chapter 853 Heavenly Dao's Gift</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In the eyes of many, Gu Shunzhi's body techniques were just like a grand waltz, performed without any affected airs - it was as if all the power within his control was perfectly laid out.</p>

    <p>The fights were based on a points system - one point for each hit - and once someone passed out, the fight was over. As Gu Shunzhi's attacks skimmed over his opponents, he won with over a thousand points, while the two poor Class 2 students weren't able to even touch a strand of hair on Gu Shunzhi's head.</p>

    <p>"This person is like a dragon in the water..." someone exclaimed admiringly at Gu Shunzhi's brilliant body movements.</p>

    <p>This person had reached a heaven-defying level in both body techniques and body movements.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling closed his eyes - this battle was already decided, so he no longer paid any attention to it. Instead, he now had to figure something out: who on earth was Gu Shunzhi, what was his purpose, and why couldn't he read Gu Shunzhi's mind?</p>

    <p>Several seconds later...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's spiritual will directly reached the Heavenly Dao Committee's meeting room.</p>

    <p>The six Great Heavenly Dao, who were having a tea party, were frightened by the intensity of this will. Strength Heavenly Dao was so startled that he directly spat his tea in Time Heavenly Dao's face.</p>

    <p>The six Great Heavenly Dao stood up, and then Strength Heavenly Dao stepped forward to gaze at the prominent pair of eyes in the sky which were particular to Wang Ling — a pair of dead fish eyes that were far from cheap or conventional.</p>

    <p>Strength Heavenly Dao pulled his neck back. "Your Excellency Ling, why have you come?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling blinked and the image of Gu Shunzhi's attack in the world below was projected into the sky through Wang Ling's pupils.</p>

    <p>"So you're investigating this person..." Strength Heavenly Dao understood.</p>

    <p>He turned to the rest of the Heavenly Dao. "Everyone, do you have any idea who this person is?"</p>

    <p>"I know him."</p>

    <p>After several seconds of silence, Time Heavenly Dao stepped forward. "Your Excellency Ling, as far as I know, this person is from a world in a different timeline, and should be from the future..."</p>

    <p>After that, he waved his hand, and a golden talisman emerged from his palm, which was ultimately absorbed by Wang Ling's pupils.</p>

    <p>Time Heavenly Dao: "Your Excellency Ling, this is a time location talisman, and it contains my power. You can merge it with a magic artifact to create a time tracker magic artifact and find out that person's exact identity."</p>

    <p>"Mm."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling gave a light reply.</p>

    <p>Then, he closed his eyes, and the massive eyes in the sky directly disappeared.</p>

    <p>As if a weight had been lifted off their shoulders, the Great Heavenly Dao sat down on the ground, and each and every one of them heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>Strength Heavenly Dao: "Sir Time, why didn't you directly tell His Excellency Ling who this person is?"</p>

    <p>Time Heavenly Dao: "Who is His Excellency Ling that he needs me to tell him? His Excellency Ling will look so cool when he finds out for himself! What do you think? How many marks do I get for flattery?"</p>

    <p>The other Heavenly Dao: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling opened his eyes again in the lounge for Number 60 High School's elite students, the fight featuring Gu Shunzhi's natural and smooth movements was already over.</p>

    <p>Time Heavenly Dao had given him a Heavenly Dao golden talisman to trace Gu Shunzhi's identity - Time Heavenly Dao obviously knew Gu Shunzhi's identity, but couldn't reveal it directly.</p>

    <p>The Heavenly Dao had their own rules. Wang Ling didn't think he was a difficult person, and was pretty reasonable. Since Heavenly Dao wanted him to find out for himself, then he should just do that.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling recalled that he had a discarded iPad in his bedroom. If he merged it with this golden talisman and enlightened it, it would be a powerful time magic artifact.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling decided to give the iPad the name: Ipoid — Huaxiu Daoist name: Tablet!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At 3:40pm, the Team 3 showdown that everyone was waiting for finally began.</p>

    <p>A barrier and temporary arena had been set up in Number 60 High School, according to pretty much the same specifications as for the World Martial Arts Tournament Gym <sup>1</sup> . The materials used, however, were much worse than those for the Office of Strategic Deception's founding ceremony. The school had to cut costs and spend on education... Number 60 High's Headmaster Chen was notoriously stingy.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(From Dragon Ball..)</dfn>

    <p>Going up to the arena with Fang Xing, Wang Ling noticed that his shoes were a little dusty. If he had known earlier, he wouldn't have worn white shoes today.</p>

    <p>In Wang Ling's shoe cupboard at home, most of his shoes were white. Although they got dirty easily, white was indeed Wang Ling's most favorite color, representing cleanliness and purity.</p>

    <p>However, Fang Xing, who went on stage with Wang Ling, didn't have time to care about his shoes.</p>

    <p>To be honest, Fang Xing was a little nervous. This was his second time standing on the same battle line as Wang Ling to face an enemy. The last time was during the attack on Immortal Mansion... although he had already been unconscious by then.</p>

    <p>"Come on, Wang Ling! Come on, Fang Xing! Beat the shit out of them!"</p>

    <p>"Hold steady, Wang Ling! Just leave it to Fang Xing! Remember, you're forever a koi fish!"</p>

    <p>"Fang Xing, if you're a man, hold Li Hao's head down and beat him up for ten seconds!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"What do you want to do? I'll play along." Fang Xing took a deep breath, his expression deadly serious. His eyes were fixed on Li Hao and Li Diao in front of them.</p>

    <p>His nerves were purely because he didn't know how to shoulder this wok... The guy who was the best at this kind of thing was actually Zhuo Yi!</p>

    <p>Li Hao stepped onto the stage, his arms folded. He had corded muscles and his entire frame was unusually broad. He was actually a whole two heads taller than his father, Li Diao, who was like a demonic teenager and completely blocked from view when he stood behind Li Hao.</p>

    <p>Li Diao was a man who had already lived for over eight hundred years, but there was no way he could live that long by relying on his cultivation; it was because he was a vampire that he had a much longer lifespan.</p>

    <p>And this was clearly one of the strengths of a vampire. Many cultivators spent lots and lots of energy breaking through realms in their pursuit of long lifespans. If they succeeded, they could live for another century. If they failed, they would end up directly dying in a seated position and become skeletons.</p>

    <p>Vampires weren't bothered by the problem of longevity at all. Even if they didn't have enough cultivation, they could live for a very long time by relying on this special physique which never aged.</p>

    <p>At that moment, the two sides were standing face-to-face.</p>

    <p>"Players ready! Match, begin!" a teacher called out.</p>

    <p>Li Hao rushed straight at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Squash the soft persimmon first!</p>

    <p>The moment he stepped on stage, his eyes were already fixed on Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He had investigated Fang Xing, who was a transfer student from Tianshi Imperial High School and might not be easy to deal with.</p>

    <p>But this frail-looking and fair teenager standing before him looked like a typical skinny nerd without the slightest bit of protein in him — he must have grown up eating junk food!</p>

    <p>As Li Hao swung a fist at Wang Ling, little did he know that he had already pissed Wang Ling off...</p>
