  <h1>Chapter 334 The World Is So Damn Small </h1>

  <div>

    <p>To be honest, Wang Ling would never have been able to guess Lao Gudong's true identity without this photo from Killer Taoist...</p>

    <p>Although he had known since the beginning that Lao Gudong's identity definitely wasn't simple, there was no way he could have connected the legendary Gorgeous Itinerant to him. But many things now certainly made sense.</p>

    <p>First of all, Lao Gudong's considerable skill at shooting chalk. Back then, he had shot dead a Golden Core killer in the school office with a piece of chalk in order to protect Sun Rong. On the surface, it sounded like it was easy to do, but the most critical point was this chalk! An ordinary piece of chalk could never pierce a Golden Core cultivator's body unless it was enhanced to the max with some spell or technique.</p>

    <p>Secondly, at the beginning of the semester, Wang Ling had discovered a memory that had been sealed away in Lao Gudong's mind, but he hadn't tried using forceful measures to unlock it for fear of damaging the man's brain. It was obvious that this sealed memory had something to do with Taoist Taotie's adopted son, Black Gauze.</p>

    <p>And the last thing was that after the recent theory of history class, Guo Hao had seen with his own eyes Lao Gudong in the toilets looking at himself in the mirror with a face full of melancholy. It was obvious that he had been recalling his past appearance.</p>

    <p>Now that Wang Ling knew his true identity, he was really incredibly curious to know what on earth this man, who had been widely recognized in cultivation history for his gorgeous looks, had gone through to become like this.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was July 2nd, the tenth Sunday of the semester.</p>

    <p>Ever since Father Wang had messed with the head of Kitchen Knife Sect, Jiang Haifu, at the school gate, it could be said that they had become pretty close after that. Jiang Haifu had taken two full days to finish reading Father Wang's old novel Let Go of that Wet Nurse , and was full of admiration for him. A lot of this in fact had to do with Jiang Haifu's limited education. Although Kitchen Knife Sect was doing pretty well now, as the person helming the sect, he had always longed for an education, and he highly revered educated people.</p>

    <p>Although Father Wang had never graduated from Foundation Establishment middle school, he had been expanding his knowledge on all kinds of things while he had been holed up at home all these years. Even if he didn't know everything inside out, he at the very least possessed some knowledge on various subjects.</p>

    <p>As a professional web novelist, the most important thing about his job was being able to bluff his readers... it could be said that Father Wang was very confident in this regard, and it was a piece of cake to sway an unsophisticated fellow like Jiang Haifu.</p>

    <p>Two days ago, Father Wang had kept his word and sent the cigars to Jiang Haifu. While he had only sent two, Father Wang could imagine how the other man would definitely quiver with excitement at receiving them. After all, not everyone could whip these cigars out.</p>

    <p>In return, Jiang Haifu had sent back ten quality black jade kitchen knives. These knives were made from first-class materials with the finest workmanship especially for restaurant kitchen master chefs; they were so sharp that they could cut through bone like mud. Even if they weren't used in the kitchen, they were also valuable as collector's items.</p>

    <p>The ten kitchen knives had arrived just that morning. When Wang Ling came downstairs for breakfast, he saw the old man praising them lavishly as he held them in his hands.</p>

    <p>Having worked in a kitchen for many years, the old man was actually very strict about the kind of knives he used; for him to commend them to this extent, their quality was evident!</p>

    <p>"Nice knives! They're really good!"</p>

    <p>The old man stroked the blade of one black jade knife and flicked his finger against it so that it pinged crisply.</p>

    <p>Holding his coffee with two hands, Father Wang smiled. "As long as you like them, dad!"</p>

    <p>"Mm." The old man nodded his head. "I've rarely seen this type of kitchen knives throughout my entire career. These are the kind of top quality goods you might only see once in a lifetime. Did you say that they're from Ling Ling's classmate's father?"</p>

    <p>Father Wang sipped his coffee and nodded. "Yes, but they're not in the same class."</p>

    <p>The old man laughed. "Then that's such a good relationship! Bring that kid and his father over next time, I want to compare my cooking skills with his father's!"</p>

    <p>Father Wang couldn't help smiling. "Forget it, dad... He's the head of Kitchen Knife Sect, he would have at least several centuries' worth of experience."</p>

    <p>Father Wang's words were actually pretty cryptic. Even Wang Ling felt that there was nothing to compare in this matter. Jiang Haifu's Kitchen Knife Sect had only existed for several hundred years, but looking at the scale of its growth, it was already a leading name in the food and beverage industry. The most important thing was that the Kikkaro Restaurant where the old man had worked before belonged to Kitchen Knife Sect. Father Wang found it funny when he thought about the retired old man wanting to compare cooking notes with his boss.</p>

    <p>"What you said doesn't sound right." The old man narrowed his eyes and smiled as he waved his hands. "We'll just be comparing skills, not realms, and it'll just be for fun. I'm pretty confident in myself. Unless he's the best in the nation, even if he's a master chef, I can still win."</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "Dad... sometimes, you need to be a little more modest. I tell you, if you really want to compete with that person, he'll definitely go easy on you."</p>

    <p>The old man: "Before he comes, you can tell him that if he dares throw the match, I'll have Ling Ling's grandmother haunt him at night!"</p>

    <p>Father Wang and Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>The old man had always had confidence in his culinary skills.</p>

    <p>It was only chatting about it today that Father Wang realized that he actually knew very little about the old man's experiences as a chef when he had been younger; he only knew that his father had indeed reigned in Kikkaro Restaurant for a very long time back then. In the eyes of his similarly retired colleagues, the old man was a legend, the type that could turn into an idol to be worshiped.</p>

    <p>"Alright... I'll let him know later and set a date."</p>

    <p>Unable to talk the old man out of it, Father Wang in the end could only laugh and agree, treating it as giving the old man something fun to do in his retirement.</p>

    <p>"Good! Let me know later when he'll be coming, Sheep and I will go buy the ingredients! I should also send my knife for maintenance." The old man was instantly pleased, and he took out a flat object from the box of knives which Jiang Bai's father had sent.</p>

    <p>Only then did Father Wang and Wang Ling realize that the box had actually contained a gold voucher for one free kitchen knife maintenance service.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling glanced at it out of the corner of his eye and saw, written at the top of the gold voucher, the words "Luo Chuang Metalware"... Instantly he exclaimed in his heart: The world is so damn small!</p>
