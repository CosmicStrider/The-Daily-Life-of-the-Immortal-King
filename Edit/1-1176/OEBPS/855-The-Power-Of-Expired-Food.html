  <h1>Chapter 855 The Power Of Expired Food</h1>

  <div>

    <p>What did it feel like to be force-fed crispy noodles?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling controlled every crispy noodle grain that ran down Li Diao's throat; he even poured in all the pepper until there wasn't even a speck of it left. For a moment, Li Diao's throat felt as dry as a desert, the moisture all taken away by the crispy noodle snack until it was so dry that he wanted to cough.</p>

    <p>But the young devil in front of him had no intention of letting him go at all. Li Diao felt like a doll at the other party's mercy, and was unable to move at all; even his mouth and tongue were being controlled. He didn't have the least bit room to struggle.</p>

    <p>After a whole crispy noodle snack packet was poured into Li Diao's stomach, this young devil stubbornly crumpled up the packaging and also stuffed it into Li Diao's mouth.</p>

    <p>Finally, he jerked Li Diao's jaw up fiercely.</p>

    <p><em>Crack!</em></p>

    <p>Li Diao swallowed the crispy noodle snack packaging with a loud gulp, to the sound of his jaw breaking.</p>

    <p>After doing all this, Wang Ling's gloomy mood finally lifted.</p>

    <p>That crispy noodle snack just now was an expired one from home, but Wang Ling had been unwilling to throw it away.</p>

    <p>This was a regular edition crispy noodle snack. It may be expired, but as long as he accumulated a certain number of them, he could take them to the store to exchange them for an even better limited edition flavor.</p>

    <p>How could he be willing to let Li Diao eat the limited edition or enchanted ones?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that this type of big moron with a cheap and foul mouth who wouldn't acknowledge other people was only fit to eat expired snacks! Giving him an expired crispy noodle snack packet was already too good for him! If there hadn't been any other expired snacks at home, Wang Ling even felt like smearing that premium dog food which Er Ha had hidden under the toilet lid all over Li Diao's face.</p>

    <p>Hu...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling let out a long breath.</p>

    <p>Instantly, Fang Xing and Li Diao felt the surrounding temperature start to increase and gradually return to normal.</p>

    <p>This showed that Wang Ling had cooled down.</p>

    <p>He had always thought of himself as a more zen person. The last time he had been this angry was when Er Ha as a toad had flattened the flagship store under its butt, instantly enraging Wang Ling. After the flagship store was flattened, there weren't any good quality crispy noodle snacks that little Wang Ling could buy, and he could only subsist on ordinary versions at the time.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling never thought that there would actually be someone else brazenly courting death today.</p>

    <p>Panic...</p>

    <p>Panic from the depths of the soul flooded Li Diao's whole body and made him shudder. He had been so high before the fight started, but now he couldn't be any more terrified.</p>

    <p>His jaw was broken. Generally speaking, this injury should have healed very quickly given his physique, but at the moment, his jaw was recovering ninety percent slower than usual. Although it was healing, the pain of the broken bones mending felt like an author being crucified and roasted over a bonfire for slow updates â€” it was persistent and never-ending suffering!</p>

    <p>"Who... Who are you..."</p>

    <p>Li Diao gazed at Wang Ling in fear.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling, are you going to use an Amnesia Punch? You can leave it to me." At that moment, Fang Xing stepped forward. According to the regular order of things, he was guessing that Wang Ling would definitely use some kind of amnesia spell next. Given how annoying Li Diao was, what was the most brutal type of amnesia spell that could be used on him? Nothing beat an Amnesia Punch...</p>

    <p>The most important thing was that he was afraid that Wang Ling would directly kill Li Diao, so Fang Xing decided he should do it.</p>

    <p>That way, he could ensure that there was a cap on the strength used.</p>

    <p>In any case, he was the leader of the Office of Strategic Deception's goon squad!</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling, just leave the rest to me." And so, Fang Xing smiled slightly and took the initiative to shoulder the "wok."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "Mm..."</p>

    <p>When Fang Xing clenched his fist and released his aura, Li Diao's expression changed drastically... only then did he realize that this Fang Xing also wasn't any damn regular person!</p>

    <p>Even if the demon youngster wasn't here and Fang Xing acted alone, Li Diao and Li Hao didn't have the slightest chance of winning.</p>

    <p>"Is there anything you want to ask before you pass out?" Fang Xing gazed at Li Diao.</p>

    <p>Li Diao: "With your strength... why are the two of you here? Who the hell are you people? Is this spell to stop time called: World..."</p>

    <p>Li Diao had many questions.</p>

    <p>However, Fang Xing replied with just one sentence: "Not telling you!"</p>

    <p>Then, a fist the size of a sandbag smashed into Li Diao's head, and he felt his vision go black before he was swiftly knocked out.</p>

    <p>That punch just now was the legendary "Amnesia Punch," but Fang Xing had masterfully controlled his strength, erasing Li Diao's memory of what he had seen just now and leaving only his fear of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>If Wang Ling acted, Fang Xing surmised that it was likely Li Diao would even forget his own mother!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>A few minutes after that "Amnesia Punch," time started moving once again.</p>

    <p>When Li Diao came back to his senses, he could clearly sense a blank space in his mind.</p>

    <p>What happened...</p>

    <p>It felt like he had been punched in the face, and even his jaw was broken... but the scariest thing was that he had no idea at all what happened.</p>

    <p>"Lord Father! How should we handle these two? Which one do you want?"</p>

    <p>On the other side, Li Hao, who was completely unaware of the situation, was still full of fighting spirit.</p>

    <p>But in the next moment, Li Diao met Wang Ling's gaze, and his heart was immediately swamped with panic.</p>

    <p>All his hair stood on end!</p>

    <p>Li Diao raised his hand; an intense survivor's instinct was telling him to drag Li Hao away and leave this place, but at that very moment, his stomach released a "gu gu gu" sound! The expired crispy noodle snack which Wang Ling had poured into Li Diao's body just now was taking effect!</p>

    <p>When he had poured the crispy noodle snack into Li Diao's stomach, Wang Ling had enlightened a bacterium in passing...</p>

    <p>This bacterium would make Li Diao suffer incessant diarrhea for centuries to come!</p>

    <p>It felt like a long time had passed after Li Hao's first punch, but there weren't any signs that a confrontation had taken place in the arena, and a lot of people were feeling very anxious.</p>

    <p>"What's going on? Are they fighting or not?"</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling is the weakest in our school's elite stream! Why does it feel like Li Diao's looking at him strangely... Is it possible that he's intimidated by Wang Ling's dead fish eyes?" said Chen Chao, pursing his lips.</p>

    <p>While everyone was wondering what was going on...</p>

    <p>Because of an acute stomach ache, Li Diao crouched down on the ground under everyone's blank gazes.</p>

    <p>"Lord Father, what's wrong?" Li Hao bent down to ask in concern.</p>

    <p>The next second, Li Diao's face changed dramatically. "Not good! I can't hold it!"</p>

    <p>A shit-yellow substance shot out of his ass, the force so strong that everyone was stupefied!</p>

    <p>Li Diao was propelled forward by this massive force. His head hit Li Hao's chin so hard that the latter's vision went dark and he passed out on the spot.</p>

    <p>This scene happened too suddenly...</p>

    <p>When everyone came back to their senses, Li Hao and his father were already lying in a pool of shit...</p>
