  <h1>Chapter 1094 One Fingernail's Worth of Spirit Power</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In the headmaster's office, Number 60 High's Headmaster Chen Tianxiang and director of education Director Shi were also paying attention to this fight which had caught the attention of the entire school. Xia Ming's identity as a descendant of the Ancient Divine Clan had always been a secret, but he had unexpectedly been exposed in the fight today. Looking at Headmaster Chen's composed expression, however, Director Shi was even more certain that Headmaster Chen intended to let this fight happen.</p>

    <p>As a descendant of the Ancient Divine Clan, Xia Ming had a natural advantage since his spirit root was more superior to what other students had. This superiority was a double-edged sword: it might make some people more confident in their actions, but overconfidence could become arrogance.</p>

    <p>"There is only one descendant of the Ancient Divine Clan in our Number 60 High, so this can be considered my test for him," Headmaster Chen said slowly. Number 60 High had taken part in a lot of inter-school activities, but since Xia Ming had signed an agreement with Number 60 High that his identity as a descendant of the Ancient Divine Clan couldn't be revealed, he had never appeared in front of everyone, whether it was in the exchange meet with Number 59 High or the joint military training between six schools.</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen's intention was to test Xia Ming's temperament and see how long he could keep his identity secret. In the end, who would have thought that Xia Ming would completely reveal himself in just the second half of Senior Grade One.</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen sank into thought at this result. To be able to hide one's strength and live as an ordinary person - he didn't believe that an ordinary person could do this. Life was always full of frustrations - like now, for example, Xia Ming had violated the confidentiality agreement and revealed his identity as a descendant of the Ancient Divine Clan of his own accord, because he was jealous of Student Wang Ling and wanted to win Sun Rong's favor.</p>

    <p>As far as Headmaster Chen was concerned, Xia Ming was, in the end, still a child.</p>

    <p>He was far from mature enough.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High School might teach knowledge, but Headmaster Chen in fact focused more on cultivating character. It wasn't enough for teachers to just focus blindly on grades; when all was said and done, they also needed to guide the students on the right path and nurture them toward becoming useful members of society who understood gratitude and dedication.</p>

    <p>In comparison, Headmaster Chen was actually quite pleased with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling's grades were always right down the middle ever since he entered the elite class, his mentality was clearly much better than Xia Ming's.</p>

    <p>A normal student would feel anxious if their grades remained average, but Wang Ling? He just ate and drank as usual, and didn't think his average grades were a problem at all. He didn't even respond clearly to Student Sun Rong's confession, and had only accepted this challenge because he had been helpless to do anything but go along with the momentum!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling did live up to Headmaster Chen's expectations as the mascot of Number 60 High.</p>

    <p>From the previous spirit sword exchange meet to the joint military training for six schools, Wang Ling's performance had always been very colorful.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The onlookers at the scene were now divided into three groups.</p>

    <p>The first group supported Xia Ming. After he revealed his identity as a descendant of the Ancient Divine Clan, they looked forward even more to a brilliant performance. Wang Ling had really pulled too much aggro with the fact that Sun Rong had confessed to him, and a lot of people were itching for Xia Ming to beat Wang Ling up.</p>

    <p>The second group consisted of the five big shots: Wang Zhen, Gu Shunzhi, Liu Qingyi, Fang Xing and Zhenyuan. Of course, they supported Wang Ling unwaveringly. At the same time, they wanted to see how on earth he would handle this boring fight. They didn't care about the outcome at all, and were only concerned about what they could learn from him.</p>

    <p>Naturally, nothing needed to be said about the third group. Although Wang Ling was normally anti-social and didn't like to talk to other people, it wasn't as if he didn't have friends. Chen Chao and Guo Hao's fighting strength and ability to rally others alone were enough to help pull together a core group of supporters for Wang Ling. At the very least, all of Grade One, Class Three supported him! Even if someone had a different opinion, no one dared voice it since the commissary in charge of studies, Su Xiao, also supported Wang Ling; they were worried that if they openly opposed this, they might not have enough time from now on to catch up on and copy homework in the morning at school...</p>

    <p>At that moment, Xia Ming felt the resonance of his spirit root take form as thin streams of white spirit qi flowed from his body.</p>

    <p>It was indeed astonishing for a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator to possess such a massive reserve of spirit power.</p>

    <p>But this spirit power reserve was child's play to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Every single pore on Wang Ling's body was in fact a small world which could store a huge amount of spirit power for him to use. Apart from his pores, the same was also true of every single cell inside his body.</p>

    <p>The human body had around eighty trillion cells. Excluding the cells that were metabolized every day, Wang Ling had a total of eighty trillion small worlds on him.</p>

    <p>Not only that, spirit power was stored even in Wang Ling's fingernails.</p>

    <p>But the spirit power in his fingernails was for backup use, and wasn't as extreme as what was contained inside the small worlds. The amount of spirit power which one fingernail contained was roughly the same amount of spirit power which a Soul Formation cultivator possessed.</p>

    <p>Right now, Xia Ming's spirit power wasn't even a fourth of what Wang Ling had in one fingernail.</p>

    <p>What should he do? Go down with Xia Ming in this fight?</p>

    <p>Seeing how confident Xia Ming appeared, Wang Ling pondered inwardly, and the only thing he could think of was to draw with Xia Ming.</p>

    <p>This way, the situation might calm down.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling, please instruct me." At that moment, Xia Ming charged forward after he was done gathering his strength. Stepping forward, he closed the distance between them in the blink of an eye.</p>

    <p>A punch was thrown at Wang Ling's face, and he could feel the wind pressure from it. Wang Ling's first reaction wasn't to block it, but to evade it with his body techniques.</p>

    <p>Never hit someone in the face. It was true that Wang Ling had molded his own face to give himself an average appearance, but he had never been hit in the face before.</p>

    <p>He was the one who hit others.</p>

    <p>For another thing, Wang Ling was also taking Xia Ming's safety into consideration.</p>

    <p>If that punch had hit Wang Ling precisely in the face, Xia Ming would still suffer a fracture at the very least, even if Wang Ling deliberately restrained the power of the backlash.</p>

    <p>The scene of that red ribbon killer who had been turned into human slag from the backlash during the failed assassination on Sun Rong at school back then was still vivid in Wang Ling's mind.</p>

    <p>Under the eyes of so many, he didn't want history to repeat itself.</p>

    <p>Xia Ming threw a smooth series of punches.</p>

    <p>"Is dodging all you can do, Wang Ling?!" Xia Ming deliberately ridiculed Wang Ling as he threw his punches.</p>

    <p>But this sort of scorn was nothing to Wang Ling, and couldn't provoke him at all.</p>

    <p>Xia Ming scored very high in the body techniques exam. He cultivated the Chaos Running Water Fist Technique, in which both the fists and legs were used. It was a very consistent technique and highly explosive in power. However, it consumed too much energy, and a lot of people would feel exhausted when they performed the final stage of the technique.</p>

    <p>But Xia Ming was different. As a descendant of the Ancient Divine Clan, his endurance wasn't in question, thanks to his spirit root advantage.</p>

    <p>Thus, Wang Ling felt that this Chaos Running Water Fist Technique was a little difficult to deal with.</p>

    <p>Each move was aimed at his face; this person really wasn't showing any mercy...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling still didn't act, and continued to nimbly dodge Xia Ming's fists.</p>

    <p>But Wang Zhen and the others frowned slightly at this scene.</p>

    <p>This sort of dodging appeared meaningless, but for some reason, Wang Zhen felt that Wang Ling was doing it on purpose, as if he was deliberately guiding Xia Ming's punches.</p>

    <p>Sure enough -</p>

    <p>In the next moment, Xia Ming's punch actually changed direction, and in the end, hit Xia Ming in his own face...</p>
