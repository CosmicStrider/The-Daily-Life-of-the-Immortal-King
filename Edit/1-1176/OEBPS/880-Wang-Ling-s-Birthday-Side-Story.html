  <h1>Chapter 880 Wang Ling's Birthday (Side Story)</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Everyone had their own little secrets, including Wang Ling, who had a habit of writing his down in his diary â€” this was a major trait of the Wang family. The old man, Father Wang, Mother Wang, and even Er Ha who had joined them not long ago had the habit of writing things down. While Er Ha had indeed started keeping a diary to practice its writing, it ultimately became a habit as time went by.</p>

    <p>The things the Wang family wrote were the stuff of legends - these weren't empty words, but were verified by past experiences.</p>

    <p>As Wang Ling was writing in his diary today, he accidentally flipped back to his entry on his birthday last year.</p>

    <p>His experience that day had been quite mystical.</p>

    <p>December 26th, 4395.</p>

    <p>At that time, Wang Ling wasn't as close yet to Lord Diulei and the others, Sixology hadn't been created, Sevenology controlled everything under heaven, the koi fish phenomenon had yet to happen, the<em>Immortal King </em>hadn't been adapted into a cartoon, the group Calorie wasn't popular yet, Liu Qiangdong hadn't been arrested, the most beautiful Yu Quan duo hadn't gotten their wings clipped, nor had the "the breeze of reform has brought great changes" guichu video lyric gone viral <sup>1</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(These are basically all
references to news and
memes that have trended in
Chinese society ..)</dfn>

    <p>When Wang Ling woke up that day, he looked at the Heavenly Dao calendar, which was the cause of everything that happened that day.</p>

    <p><em>Cultivation Calendar: December 26th, 4395.</em></p>

    <p><em>Do: Have weddings and funerals, travel, make friends, study, work</em></p>

    <p><em>Don't: Eat snacks</em></p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked down at the crispy noodle snack in his hand.</p>

    <p>Although he hadn't opened the packet, his hand had already begun to tremble slightly.</p>

    <p>This Heavenly Dao calendar... would have been created by Heavenly Dao, right?</p>

    <p>No way!</p>

    <p>He had to change it!</p>

    <p>Not allowed to eat snacks on his birthday - how was he going to get through the day?!</p>

    <p>But at that time, Wang Ling and the six Heavenly Dao didn't have such a close relationship yet.</p>

    <p>He drew an equivalent exchange array with the hand that was holding the crispy noodle snack packet and summoned the Heavenly Dao little golden man.</p>

    <p>The little golden man's hands were also shaking. "You... now what do you want?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's gaze turned to the calendar, and his intent was very clear.</p>

    <p>"The Heavenly Dao calendar was approved by the Heavenly Dao Calendar Governing General Assembly yesterday; the actual decision wasn't made by the six Great Heavenly Dao, but by the Three Thousand Heavenly Dao which they represent, and everyone had to cast a vote. Don't blame me, I didn't tick 'eating snacks.'" The little golden man wiped at his cold sweat.</p>

    <p>He knew too well what this little master in front of him looked like when he was furious, and didn't dare provoke him at all.</p>

    <p>"Take me back to yesterday." Wang Ling fixed his eyes on the little golden man as he spoke telepathically.</p>

    <p>The little golden man's mouth dropped open. He didn't have the right to refuse the transaction, and was about to ask what Wang Ling had prepared for the exchange. In the end, when he noticed the crispy noodle snack packet in Wang Ling's hand, his heart instantly turned cold - as expected, it was expired...</p>

    <p>Giving a long sigh, the Heavenly Dao little golden man activated the time corridor to yesterday.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling strode in without hesitation.</p>

    <p>Unlike when the Heavenly Dao Governing Committee met, this Heavenly Dao Calendar Governing General Assembly was held in a large venue similar to a gym. When Wang Ling reached the entrance, he saw many little golden men picking up the voting devices. When the general assembly officially started, this voting device would be the important factor in determining the do's and don'ts in the calendar.</p>

    <p>"This is the voting device, please take it." The little golden man working at the venue gave every little golden man who entered a device.</p>

    <p>It was Wang Ling's turn.</p>

    <p>"This is the voting device, please..." Looking up, the little golden man was just about to hand over the voting device when he realized that this was actually a human...</p>

    <p>Wrong!</p>

    <p>How could a human show up here?!</p>

    <p>On the side, the little golden man who had led the way for Wang Ling hurriedly shot the other party a warning glance and whispered, "If you don't want to die, hurry up and give him a voting device."</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, the little golden man giving out the devices was incredibly stiff-necked. "No way! Only our Heavenly Dao little golden men can use this device! I definitely can't give one to this human! He can't even enter the venue!"</p>

    <p>Right after that, Wang Ling directly stretched out one hand and lightly flicked this little golden man in the forehead.</p>

    <p><em>Bam!</em></p>

    <p>There was an explosion, resulting in a small mushroom cloud.</p>

    <p>The little golden man giving out the voting devices was reduced to flying dust.</p>

    <p>The golden man acting as a guide sighed. " <em>Ai </em>..."</p>

    <p>These brothers, was there any need...</p>

    <p>Heavenly Dao couldn't die, but it would probably take a very long time for this little golden man, who had exploded into a small mushroom cloud and turned into dust, to be restored.</p>

    <p>After that, Wang Ling took the rest of the voting devices.</p>

    <p>The little golden men who were still in line stared blankly; although angry, they didn't dare protest.</p>

    <p>And so, after ten minutes or so.</p>

    <p>A mystical scene took place at the venue for the Heavenly Dao Calendar Governing General Assembly.</p>

    <p>A human youngster created hundreds of clones, each of whom held a voting device as they waited to vote.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, on the other side, the golden men whose voting devices had been snatched from them trembled as they huddled together.</p>

    <p>After the venue quieted down, a platform in the center slowly rose as the six Great Heavenly Dao presiding over the meeting showed up.</p>

    <p>When they saw a human actually sitting inside the venue after grabbing a voting device, they were already prepared to suppress him - in the end, after clearly making out his face, they restlessly withdrew their hands...</p>

    <p>Similarly...</p>

    <p>They were angry, but didn't dare protest.</p>

    <p>Strength Heavenly Dao cleared his throat. "Colleagues, as usual, we are having the Heavenly Dao Calendar Governing General Assembly today to vote on the do's and don'ts items for tomorrow, December 26th, based on our meeting discussion."</p>

    <p>After saying this, Strength Heavenly Dao glanced at Wang Ling and said haltingly, "Next, I'll first discuss the 'don't' items for tomorrow.</p>

    <p>"I observed the stars last night and noticed that the Emperor Star is at its apex, which is a sign of a great person's radiant soul. Thus, I specially propose a ban on recreational activities tomorrow... Among playing games, reading comics, binge-watching dramas, reading novels and eating snacks, which one should we ban? Please think it over carefully, then vote."</p>

    <p>Strength Heavenly Dao thought that his hint was quite clear.</p>

    <p>But he felt that the voting this time wouldn't go very smoothly.</p>

    <p>Because the Heavenly Dao little golden men didn't feel the urge to eat to begin with...</p>

    <p>So, during the voting, Strength Heavenly Dao already had a bad feeling.</p>

    <p>Strength Heavenly Dao: "Brother Time... can you turn time back... I'll remove the 'eating snacks' item..."</p>

    <p>Time Heavenly Dao: "Too late! Brother Strength! You're too late!"</p>

    <p>Strength Heavenly Dao: "..."</p>

    <p>As soon as Time Heavenly Dao said the words, a series of explosions started to ring out in the whole venue.</p>

    <p>For a moment, countless mushroom clouds rose around them.</p>

    <p>A few seconds later, the only one left in the massive venue was Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>And his clones...</p>

    <p>The six Great Heavenly Dao watched the mushroom clouds fill the venue.</p>

    <p>They were angry, but didn't dare protest.</p>
