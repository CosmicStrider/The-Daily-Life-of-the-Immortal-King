  <h1>Chapter 252 Perpetual! Motion! Machine?! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Shabby appearance, soft heart, and keen observation skills in addition to being enthusiastic and sensible â€” this was Wang Ling's first impression of Luo Chuang.</p>

    <p>To be honest, he had been amazed when he saw the drawer of crispy noodle snacks. He realized that although Luo Chuang hadn't joined the chat group, he had just as much access to information as the rest, since he was even aware of what Wang Ling's favorite food was. Most crucially, Luo Chuang's strength was very formidable.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had noticed this as soon as he had entered the shop.</p>

    <p>Although Luo Chuang's aura was very well hidden, it still couldn't escape Wang Ling's perception.</p>

    <p>If a true expert wanted to know how high the other party's realm was, they wouldn't judge it based on the other party's aura when it was released. Instead, it was often through what an expert could capture with their senses when the other party hid their aura, combined with formulaic calculations, that the former would be able to accurately determine the true strength of the latter's realm.</p>

    <p>And it was very obvious that Luo Chuang was a hidden expert.</p>

    <p>If Dharmaraja sans the godly thunder inheritance was used as a gauge, Luo Chuang's prowess was almost equal to one and a half Dharmarajas.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't have to wait long before he saw Luo Chuang lead Sheep out from the shop's interior. After a series of service works and repairs, Sheep was glowing; her pink hair was brighter than before, the two small buns on her head were as soft and cute as pudding, and her already fair face now reflected light.</p>

    <p>"This time, I gave her a more durable coat of paint and spirit wax. Sheep is too fast, so the materials used for her maintenance previously couldn't endure perpetual absolute speeds at all. I believe that the maintenance this time should last longer," said Luo Chuang.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded and thanked him.</p>

    <p>"Brother Thunder has a card with my store, and he called to tell me that he would pay for this maintenance. We're brothers, and it's also my first time meeting Ling Zhenren, so it's free this time. My paint and wax jobs aren't cheap, but I can cover them for my own brothers."</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang waved his palm-leaf fan and smiled. "This time, it wasn't easy for Ling Zhenren to come here, so I have a request if you don't mind."</p>

    <p>Tell me about it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised his eyebrows and directly communicated through telepathy.</p>

    <p>His expression was very relaxed because he had known from the beginning that things weren't so simple.</p>

    <p>This fatty might look harmless, but his mind was rather sharp.</p>

    <p>It would be a scary thing indeed to make an enemy out of such a person.</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang laughed and the plump flesh on his face wrinkled like a meat bun. "This metalware shop was handed down from my ancestors. In addition to running it, and doing some repair works and maintenance on magic weapons, Ling Zhenren has probably heard of my other identity as a smith."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded. Of course he knew Luo Chuang's identity as a smith. Even if Thunder hadn't told him previously, there were tell-tale signs.</p>

    <p>A smith's physique was usually very strong after years of refining and smelting weapons. Luo Chuang's face was meaty, but there were in fact solid lumps of muscles under his white shirt.</p>

    <p>"I've been a smith for hundreds of years in the ultimate pursuit of refining and manufacturing weapons. Therefore, my greatest wish is to someday create my own magic weapons as heirlooms." Luo Chuang cupped his fists in salute to Wang Ling. "I've long heard that Ling Zhenren has a sword and I'm very curious about it. I wonder if you would allow me to take a look at it?"</p>

    <p>Oh... it turned out that he wanted to take a look at Jingke.</p>

    <p>Spirit light flashed directly in Wang Ling's hand, then Luo Chuang saw a peach wood sword a meter or two in length emerge steadily from Wang Ling's palm.</p>

    <p>Actually, allowing another person to take a look at your personal spirit sword was quite personal. Luo Chuang had thought that Wang Ling would refuse since this was only the first time that they were meeting, after all, so Wang Ling's attitude was quite a surprise.</p>

    <p>Then, Luo Chuang stared at Jingke and was dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>It felt like he couldn't take his eyes off it.</p>

    <p>Although this was only a peach wood sword, its grain was utterly exquisite.</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang couldn't help stretching out one hand, but before he could touch Jingke, he could already feel the invisible sword qi that encircled the body of the wooden sword.</p>

    <p>"Self-protecting sword qi?" Luo Chuang paled with shock. He had come into contact with countless spirit swords, but had never encountered one that could generate perpetual protective sword qi without being activated by its master's spirit energy.</p>

    <p>Was this the legendary... Perpetual! Motion! Machine?!</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang's hand was frozen in mid-air, but the flesh on his face was trembling at that moment and he felt an unprecedented thrill in his heart.</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren, can you place the sword on the sword tray at the counter?" Luo Chuang was unbearably excited as he wiped at his tears and made his request.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded and put Jingke on the tray.</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang didn't dare directly touch Jingke's self-protecting sword qi. After Wang Ling put Jingke on the sword tray, Luo Chuang put down his palm-leaf fan. He put on a pair of white gloves, then lit an incense burner on the side.</p>

    <p>"The incense in this burner has the effect of soothing the sword spirit. A friend of mine gave it to me, his surname is Gu. His family has been manufacturing incense for generations. If there's an opportunity next time, I'll introduce him to Ling Zhenren... Anyway, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity, Ling Zhenren." Luo Chuang put the lid on the burner and looked gratefully at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Then, he stood before Jingke with full reverence and bowed to the sword. "Please pardon my offense, Lord Jingke."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw Luo Chuang gulp and slowly stretch out his hands to touch Jingke.</p>

    <p>It had already been a very long time since Luo Chuang had felt like this. He had seen countless spirit swords and magic weapons in this world, but in all these hundreds of years, this was the first time that he had seen a spirit sword that could take his breath away at first glance.</p>

    <p>"Good sword!" Luo Chuang was full of praise as he held Jingke in his hands. He tried hard to control his excitement and stop his hands from shaking too much.</p>

    <p>With a miniature magnifying glass in hand, he examined the sword from tip to hilt for a long time, as if he was scrutinizing a work of beauty. He looked at it for five minutes before he placed Jingke back in the sword tray, and he heaved a deep sigh. "As the rumors say, Lord Jingke's body is perfect and flawless. There are almost no defects; if you had to name one, it's just a small thing..."</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang's words made Wang Ling raise his head curiously despite himself.</p>

    <p>"If I may be so bold as to ask, Ling Zhenren, does Lord Jingke have a scabbard?"</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang removed his white gloves and picked up his palm-leaf fan out of habit, waving it slowly. "A sword's excellence doesn't just have to do with its body; its scabbard is also a very critical component.</p>

    <p>"If the sword body is the soul, then the scabbard is the flesh. Lord Jingke's body has a permanent protective layer of sword qi around it, but without the protection of a scabbard, drawbacks are bound to crop up in the future."</p>

    <p>Scabbard...</p>

    <p>When Luo Chuang said this, something had already occurred to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>In fact, when Father Wang had bought Jingke, there had been a scabbard.</p>

    <p>But at that time, Wang Ling's hand had gotten itchy, and had directly crushed it.</p>

    <p>So that time, only Jingke's body had "survived"...</p>
