  <h1>Chapter 1077 Finally, Er Ha's Human Form</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The situation was far beyond Immortal Zhenyuan's expectations. The Flame of the Universe was one of the most intelligent flames in the cosmos; logically speaking, there was nothing for it to be afraid of in an ordinary situation. That it could actually be frightened was unbelievable to Immortal Zhenyuan.</p>

    <p>"Senior Dog, who on earth is this senior..."</p>

    <p>Now that things had come to this point, Er Ha felt that it could no longer maintain its pretext as a "senior," and could only tell Zhenyuan the truth: "This is my master."</p>

    <p>This young man was actually Senior Dog's master...</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan was predictably gobsmacked.</p>

    <p>Senior Dog was already so strong... Then, wouldn't its master's power be explosive?</p>

    <p>Seeing that Zhenyuan was surprised, but not angry, Er Ha also thought it was unbelievable. "You're not angry?"</p>

    <p>"Why should I be angry?" Zhenyuan raised his eyebrows. "I saw Senior Dog's strength for myself. Since this young man is your master, then he must be even stronger!" What Zhenyuan most liked to do was make friends with the strong. "Senior Dog, you thought of me at such a crucial moment and even introduced your master to me. This proves that you see me as part of your family. I cannot be any more thankful - how can I blame you?"</p>

    <p>"..." Er Ha was astonished.</p>

    <p>So that was what this guy actually thought; he wasn't the slightest bit suspicious about why Er Ha had deceived him.</p>

    <p>When all was said and done, this was the first person to reach the Venerated Immortal level - given his pure mentality, it was no wonder he was able to accomplish this.</p>

    <p>Er Ha thought itself too wicked in comparison...</p>

    <p>This could be one of the reasons why it was slow to take on a human form.</p>

    <p>Seeing Wang Ling advance forward step by step, Zhenyuan's gaze turned solemn. "Since this is Senior Dog's master, I can only use emergency measures. If Senior Dog can't stop him, we might still have a chance if we work together."</p>

    <p>"..." Er Ha was lost in deep thought.</p>

    <p>It didn't have the heart to deal Zhenyuan a blow.</p>

    <p>Because even if they joined hands, they had no chance.</p>

    <p>If Er Ha was really strong, like Xiao Yin, and worked together with Zhenyuan, they might be able to stop Wang Ling for a moment. Right now, however, he really wasn't capable...</p>

    <p>Er Ha was still hesitating. If it really took action, it would be completely exposed in front of Zhenyuan and stripped of all its dignity - Zhenyuan might even look down on it.</p>

    <p>What should it do in this sort of situation?</p>

    <p>Seeing Wang Ling walk toward the forest of crispy noodle snacks as he gradually fell under the spell of the heart demon, Er Ha clenched its teeth. Maybe it could go all out?</p>

    <p>It decided to stake everything by combining the profound truth of Sword Dao which Wang Ling had passed on to it with what it had currently mastered!</p>

    <p>It had already lived with Wang Ling for more than half a year, and the bond between master and servant was so deep that Er Ha couldn't disregard it and allow Wang Ling to fall into the heart demon's clutches. Whatever happened, Er Ha couldn't abandon Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Charge!" Despite its misgivings, Er Ha still grit its teeth and circulated spirit energy throughout its body! It already no longer cared how Zhenyuan would regard it after its actual strength was revealed, nor did it care about its dignity - Er Ha only cared about Wang Ling! It couldn't just sit by and watch Wang Ling be corroded by the heart demon!</p>

    <p>At that moment, Er Ha burst with mighty power as it called up Sword Dao and boosted its strength with the improved version of the Demon King's Heart Sutra so that spiritual qi was released from every pore on its body.</p>

    <p>In a mere split second, green steam rolled out from Er Ha's body, and its green dog fur fluttered despite the lack of a breeze.</p>

    <p>Sword Dao was also a type of Heavenly Dao, which Wang Ling had stripped from Evil Sword God back then and given to Er Ha; Er Ha never expected it to come in handy at this moment. It had been painstakingly cultivating Sword Dao in the last few months, and while it might not yet have noticed the power of Sword Dao, Er Ha was still surprised at the steam rising off its body after it unleashed Sword Dao.</p>

    <p>Er Ha's body also started to show signs of energy materialization.</p>

    <p>"As expected, Senior Dog is strong." Zhenyuan sighed inwardly at this scene. To be honest, he had been skeptical before, and wondered if Er Ha wasn't as strong as he had imagined. Now, however, it seemed that Zhenyuan had been overthinking it.</p>

    <p>To be able to integrate Sword Dao into one's teeth wasn't something that an ordinary person could do; not only had this Senior Dog done so, it had been done with such consummate skill. Er Ha was even powerful enough to materialize its energy, which thoroughly dispelled Zhenyuan's doubts.</p>

    <p>But no one was clearer about its strength than Er Ha itself.</p>

    <p>It assessed its overall combat strength, and if it went all out, combined with Zhenyuan's combat strength, it would be just barely enough to withstand three attacks from Wang Ling when his power was sealed... In other words, it would take three of Wang Ling's slaps to die...</p>

    <p>This was already much better odds compared with what happened to Evil Sword God.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling currently wasn't aware enough to attack them, so their lives naturally weren't in danger. But trying to stop Wang Ling was still as difficult as scaling the heavens.</p>

    <p>"Cover me!"</p>

    <p>Despite that, Er Ha didn't plan to give up. Shouting the command at Zhenyuan, it moved swiftly and charged forward once again to bite down on Wang Ling's pants leg.</p>

    <p>The profound truth of Sword Dao was instantly unleashed through Er Ha's teeth as a Sword Dao array appeared in the air â€” Seven Swords Descending the Heavenly Mountain!</p>

    <p>Like the fangs of a dog, seven light swords dropped in a crisscross pattern to instantly form a cage around Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"It's done! Reinforce the seal!" Er Ha continued to exert force, its green dog fur fluttering like flames.</p>

    <p>"Senior Dog, I'm coming!" Zhenyuan coordinated exceptionally well with Er Ha; the moment the Seven Swords Descending the Heavenly Mountain array appeared, Zhenyuan completed the seal, and a massive jade seal fell from a space tunnel in the sky!</p>

    <p>"Heavenly Emperor's Jade Seal!" This was the other magic treasure that Zhenyuan was proud of, which had a powerful suppressive effect! What was more, it contained Zhenyuan's blood; one drop of Venerated Immortal blood was as heavy as half a planet. Combined with the descent of the Heavenly Emperor's Jade Seal, the suppression generated was out of the ordinary.</p>

    <p>Er Ha's spirits were lifted when it saw this, and its blood started to flow even faster throughout its body with its happiness.</p>

    <p>All of a sudden, Er Ha felt an unusual power bubble up inside its body.</p>

    <p>Was this... its human form?</p>

    <p>It had finally cultivated a human form?</p>

    <p>Er Ha was completely moved!</p>

    <p>It never thought that this battle would indirectly open up its blocked meridians and finally allow it to obtain the human form which it had craved for so long!</p>

    <p>Er Ha was so happy it grinned from ear to ear.</p>

    <p>A few minutes later, like a magical girl transformation, Er Ha turned into a green-haired youngster with cute little canine teeth.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>And at that moment, Wang Ling, who had been locked down by the Heavenly Emperor's Jade Seal and the Seven Swords Descending the Heavenly Mountain array, finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>This dog had finally transformed into a human!</p>

    <p>Acting was too tiring for Wang Ling.</p>
