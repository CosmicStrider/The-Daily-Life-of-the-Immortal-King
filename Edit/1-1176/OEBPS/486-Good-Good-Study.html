  <h1>Chapter 486 Good Good Study </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was clear that this Internet bar's Boss Ye was a person with a story to tell. To own a chain of more than a thousand Internet bars, it could be said that his family was very powerful.</p>

    <p>Huaxiu was too big, full of crouching tigers and hidden dragons. Er Ha felt it already knew so many mysterious people in Songhai city alone.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi and Er Ha sat down next to each other and turned on their respective computers. This private gaming room was an ordinary one for five people, and the largest room could hold ten people. However, the setup in all the private rooms was almost the same, without many differences; it was just that they were a little small. But while this was the case, Er Ha noticed the private room had its own washroom, which was quite convenient.</p>

    <p>In addition to the service call button next to the computer, there was also a self-service drinks rack and a snacks shelf in the room. If you wanted to order something, you could directly scan the code to pay.</p>

    <p>But the drinks rack and snacks shelf were now empty and had become part of the decor. One reason was that when Boss Ye had bought this Internet bar, things hadn't been completely ready yet. Secondly, Boss Ye was a little short of money at present and was unable to hire assistants to help him. He was a lazier person than most, and the best would be to specially assign someone to keep track of the snacks and drinks every day and replenish them promptly when necessary.</p>

    <p>Er Ha felt that it would be tired just looking at Boss Ye keep an eye on so many private rooms...</p>

    <p>Boss Ye waited for Wei Zhi and Er Ha to turn on their computers. After confirming that there weren't any problems, he silently finished the cigarette in his hand, stubbed it out in the ashtray, then pressed the ventilation button next to the light switch in passing. "The two of you probably don't smoke, right?"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "No, no..."</p>

    <p>Boss Ye nodded. "That's good. There's no smoking in this whole Internet bar."</p>

    <p>Er Ha couldn't resist retorting, "Then why are you smoking..."</p>

    <p>Boss Ye laughed. "Who asked me to be the boss?"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi and Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>"But I reckon there'll definitely be some people who don't follow the rules, which is why I specially designed this smoke ventilation system." As he spoke, Boss Ye took out two bottles of mineral water from his storage bag and tossed them to Er Ha and Wei Zhi. "I only have these in the store now since money is tight, so make do with them."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi took one. "Thanks, boss. You're not playing?"</p>

    <p>"Games all follow the same pattern, I've long grown tired of playing them. I'm going to go to the lounge next door to sleep." Boss Ye yawned and stretched. As he walked out the door, he said, "If there's a problem with the computer, just call for me. If everything's fine, the two of you can just leave straightaway once you're done. Remember to close the door for me..."</p>

    <p><em>Peng </em>!</p>

    <p>Then, the door to the private room closed shut behind Boss Ye.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "This Boss Ye is quite interesting."</p>

    <p>"Yeah."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi nodded his head; he somehow felt that this Boss Ye's temperament was similar to some legendary person, but at the same time was also a little different <sup>1</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(In 'The King's Avatar,' the skilled protagonist Ye Xiu is an avid gamer.)</dfn>

    <p>After turning on the computer, the first thing Er Ha did was to log into the chat app. Daoist Guang had already pulled it into the water friends group. Including Er Ha and Daoist Guang, there were currently five people in the water friends group. The others were Daoist Guang's number one fan [Has Three Days And Two Sleeps Been Updated], Lord Diulei, and a person whom Er Ha had never seen before with the ID "Good Good Study <sup>2</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is the deliberate literal mistranslation of 好好学习,or "study well .. ")</dfn>

    <p>Er Ha raised an eyebrow. "Senior Immortal, are you also taking part?"</p>

    <p>"That's right, Brother Dog! I'm so bored that I thought I'd play for a bit."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei replied from in front of his screen.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had teleported to Lord Diulei's house about thirty seconds ago, and was now watching from behind him. This "Good Good Study" account was actually a side account of Lord Diulei's.</p>

    <p>Before the cultivation forum had been set up, Lord Diulei had used this side account to infiltrate other chat groups to gather intelligence. It had actually been a very long time since he had used it, but it was a long-running account with a high rank - of course, the account ID hadn't been "Good Good Study" before; Wang Ling had changed it after borrowing the account.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei felt that Wang Ling was actually giving very obvious hints in every respect...</p>

    <p>It was a pity that Er Ha had no idea at all about the person using this account.</p>

    <p>That was because as long as Wang Ling wasn't online, he would usually be offline on QQ and he wouldn't hang around on the Internet. His account level would hence be lower than for most people. So when Er Ha saw the level of this account, it straightaway made assumptions that didn't factor in the possibility of Wang Ling being the account user at all.</p>

    <p>Staring at the account name for a long time, Er Ha carefully asked, "Senior Immortal, who is this senior?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Because it's duo play mode this time, I had a friend come over for now. This friend isn't in the chat group, you probably don't know him..."</p>

    <p>"Mm." Er Ha nodded and didn't think it suspicious. "If only my little master played games!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Reading this sentence, Daoist Guang and Lord Diulei couldn't help how their hearts thumped.</p>

    <p>Acting on the expression in Wang Ling's eyes, Lord Diulei asked, "Brother Dog, why did you suddenly decide to play games?"</p>

    <p>It actually wasn't just Wang Ling; Daoist Guang and Lord Diulei were also quite concerned about this matter.</p>

    <p>If this had been a week or two ago, Er Ha wouldn't have had any interest in these things at all, given its lazy view on a dog's life.</p>

    <p>Er Ha didn't mind this question too much when it saw it; indeed, it usually didn't play games, and to suddenly want to do so certainly was a little strange.</p>

    <p>Er Ha had already explained the reason for it; a lot of it had to do with decompressing since the mental stress caused by the inheritance talisman was greater than it had expected. Most importantly, Er Ha wanted to digest all the contents of the talisman in a short period of time before going off on its own to resolve the issue with the Toad clan.</p>

    <p>In the beginning, Er Ha had actually wanted to relieve stress by watching live streams. In the end, Daoist Guang had just happened to start live streaming and also gaming during that time. Watching someone else play games, you sometimes couldn't help but itch to play yourselves.</p>

    <p>So this was the second reason why Er Ha had chosen to play games to decompress... Of course, this was actually a minor factor.</p>

    <p>After thinking about it, Er Ha replied, "Well... I've been cultivating a technique recently, so I'm feeling a lot more pressure."</p>

    <p>On the surface, there actually wasn't anything wrong with Er Ha's answer. Wang Ling knew that in addition to studying a cultivation spirit technique recently, Er Ha was actually also trying hard to absorb the power of the "inheritance talisman," which was bound to cause mental stress. Wang Ling didn't deny that playing games was a very good way to relieve stress in this situation.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling still felt that Er Ha was still hiding something big...</p>

    <p>Just then, Er Ha suddenly said, "So the sixth person we've fixed on this time is my friend?"</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang nodded. "That's right."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Then I'll invite my friend in."</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang: "Mm, Brother Dog, go ahead."</p>

    <p>Just as Er Ha was about to invite Wei Zhi in, it suddenly thought of a very serious problem and hurriedly sent a message to the group. "Wait! There's something very important I haven't said!"</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang and Lord Diulei: "???"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Elder brothers, you must not tell my little master that I came out to play games!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
