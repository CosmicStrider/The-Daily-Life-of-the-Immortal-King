  <h1>Chapter 257 New Transfer Student </h1>

  <div>

    <p>The legend of Devil Valley wasn't a secret in the cultivation world at all; over the years, many people had searched for the valley's entrance.</p>

    <p>Apart from Huaxiu citizens, there were even many cultivators who had come from the west with an eye on this treasure land. Devil Valley contained resources that were otherwise extinct in the current world; if you took yourself to be an owner of a fish pond like Devil Valley, it absolutely wasn't wishful thinking to believe that you could achieve the pinnacle of your life's journey.</p>

    <p>Most of the people who searched for Devil Valley only thought about the benefits they could gain, but Luo Chuang had his own ambition — the only reason he wanted to enter the valley was to find the One Thousand Dried Bone, which was integral for creating a unique scabbard.</p>

    <p>After seeing the anticipation on Luo Chuang's face and those eyes full of boundless hope, Lord Diulei was instantly a little nervous.</p>

    <p>"For now, Little Black is only monitoring fluctuations that he suspects might be from Devil Valley, and can't fully confirm it yet. If you want to enter it, you'll still need a bit of luck..." Lord Diulei said.</p>

    <p>This was in fact something that everyone already understood very well. Devil Valley was like Peach Blossom Land <sup>1</sup> — most people would only be able to find it through serendipity. There were very few recorded instances of people successfully entering Devil Valley. Furthermore, it was said that many of the people who came out of the valley bearing those so-called extinct resources would later completely forget everything that they had experienced there.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is from a fable written by
Tao Yuanming in 421 AD
about the chance discovery of
an ethereal utopia where the
people co-exist in ideal
harmony with nature for
centuries, unaware of the
outside world.)</dfn>

    <p>So another way of saying it was that Devil Valley didn't actually exist.</p>

    <p>It was argued instead that the real Devil Valley was just an illusionary landscape that had been created by an Ancient Almighty, and the people who said that they had brought out extinct resources from the valley had actually been under an illusion spell.</p>

    <p>This information wasn't a secret. Both Lord Diulei and Luo Chuang, were very clear about it in their hearts.</p>

    <p>But it was very obvious that Luo Chuang wasn't willing to give up. "Anyway, I want to give it a go. Ever since meeting Lord Jingke, I knew that my dream of forging the ultimate sword was ruined. No matter what type of sword I make, it would never surpass Lord Jingke..."</p>

    <p>At this point, he grabbed Lord Diulei's hands with an excited face. "So, whether I can make a supreme scabbard or not will all depend on you, Brother Lei!"</p>

    <p>The corners of Lord Diulei's mouth twitched violently, and pulling his hands out of Luo Chuang's greasy grip, he tried to keep smiling. "I'll try my best..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was still June 22nd on Wednesday in the ninth week of the semester.</p>

    <p>Many things had happened in the morning because of the live broadcast of the old devil's trial.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan had had to come to class well in advance to crack down on the "riot."</p>

    <p>This was because the noise couldn't just be heard upon stepping out of the office — according to Teacher Pan, she had already been able to hear the yelling as soon as she had stepped out of the subway station near the school.</p>

    <p>It could only be said Teacher Pan was in the end Teacher Pan, a pioneer teacher at Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that the saying that all teachers-in-charge had preternaturally good hearing was utterly true.</p>

    <p>But even when she had to quell the noise, Teacher Pan seemed to be in a particularly good mood today.</p>

    <p>All the crows in the world were equally black — all the teachers-in-charge in the world liked to do one thing, and that was to compare their students with other students.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan rolled up her sleeves, placed her hands on the lectern, and sighed with dissatisfaction at the way her students were unable to live up to her expectations. "I don't know how to deal with all of you; the gap between the two elite classes in our Number 60 High School is growing wider everyday. Can't you learn from Fang Xing in the class next door?"</p>

    <p>The name made Wang Ling abruptly lift his head.</p>

    <p>Because he felt like he had heard it before.</p>

    <p>But it was only recently that he had heard this name, and that was after the survival contest.</p>

    <p>It was only later that Wang Ling had found out that Fang Xing was a new transfer student. Furthermore, he had transferred from a neighboring city and had been directly assigned to the elite class. There were only two elite classes in Number 60 High School: one was Grade One, Class Three which Wang Ling was in, and the other one was Grade One, Class Two. Fang Xing was a new transfer student in Class Two.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao had wanted to talk about this in the morning, but the live broadcast of the old devil's trial had been such big news that everyone had chosen to ignore the matter of the new transfer student, just like Wang Feng who was always robbed of his headlines <sup>2</sup></p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This refers to singer Wang
Feng's joke that any time
news of him is released, it's
bound to be eclipsed by some
other hot topic in the media.)</dfn>

    <p>During the morning class, Teacher Pan spoke highly of the transfer student and lavished him with praise, but this still wasn't enough to satisfy the students' curiosity.</p>

    <p>Hence, as soon as class was over, Guo Hao was surrounded. The two girls, Sun Rong and Lin Xiaoyu, had been sent next door as their representatives to feel out the true situation with Classmate Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>"Do you have anything on the transfer student? Where did he transfer from?" Chen Chao asked curiously.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao tsked and asked, "Have you heard of Tianshi Imperial High School?"</p>

    <p>Everyone shook their heads. Forget the high school, they hadn't even heard of this name before.</p>

    <p>"I have an uncle who told me that this is a high school for aristocrats in Jinghua city which was built on a spirit mountain. Since it's an aristocratic high school, not just anyone can enter. The annual selection is very strict and enrollment numbers are limited." Guo Hao cupped his chin, his face full of contemplation. "So this Fang Xing's identity definitely isn't simple."</p>

    <p>"Since his school is so awesome, why did he choose to come to our Number 60 High School?" someone asked.</p>

    <p>"I heard from my uncle that one of the compulsory requirements for being enrolled in Tianshi Imperial High School is that you must buy a house in the school district near the school. Since Classmate Fang's family has now moved to Songhai city, he'd have to transfer schools. As to why he chose Number 60... I don't know." Guo Hao shrugged helplessly.</p>

    <p>"But in addition to that, I heard that Classmate Fang Xing had only been here a day when he already caused three major events..." said Guo Hao.</p>

    <p>"What three events?"</p>

    <p>"The first one: after he just got here, he straightaway challenged Clan Leader Yu to a duel. The two of them fought with the wooden swords the school uses, and after the fight, Classmate Fang Xing's sword remained undamaged, but Clan Leader Yu's sword had simply become wood chips; with one gust of wind, they straightaway turned to sand. Classmate Fang Xing said that his sword skill was called 'You Are the Wind, I Am the Sand <sup>3</sup> '," said Guo Hao.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(This is the title of a song
associated with the Chinese
TV drama "Return of the Pearl
Princess .. ")</dfn>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>"The second thing was at the reception for new students. Lao Gudong went to explain our school's campus culture to Classmate Fang Xing, but he fell asleep. So Lao Gudong threw a piece of chalk at him... and he caught it!"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>"The last is the most terrifying. In order to welcome Classmate Fang Xing, Mother Juan specially him something to eat..." said Guo Hao.</p>

    <p>At just hearing the two words 'Mother Juan,' everyone couldn't help but shudder. They recalled how Guo Hao had suffered from her evil "fan bing bing" before the survival contest.</p>

    <p>"If we use that fan bing bing as the gauge, its lethality is three stars. Then Mother Juan's 'sky steamed godly snails'... is five stars!"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao's eyes were full of horror as he said, "After Classmate Fang Xing ate Mother Juan's 'sky steamed godly snails'... he was actually fine."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Now, even Wang Ling was terrified.</p>
