  <h1>Chapter 777 The Domain of the Gods: Nine-fold Star</h1>

  <div>

      <p>This was a sword that Beast King had never seen before ... Devil King felt a deep sense of terror just wondering about the identity of the spirit sword's owner.</p>

      <p>The reason for this -</p>

      <p>- was because he had definitely smelled the scent on this peach wood sword somewhere before ...</p>

      <p>"Did Your Majesty Beast King remember something?" Zhuo Yi asked when he saw the contemplative look on Devil King's face.</p>

      <p>Zhuo Yi didn't know anything about Jingke's origins, but he was one of the few people present who had experienced the profound strength of the peach wood sword. In the Master of Immortal Mansion's intrinsic spirit field back then, Jingke had revealed the formidable battle strength of the king of sword spirits, while that World-Annihilating Sword in the confrontation with Evil Sword God had been even more terrifying.</p>

      <p>Since things had come to this point, Devil King felt that he had nothing to hide.</p>

      <p>Because everything he was doing was for the sake of opening this Heavenly Dao Treasure Box. He had struggled hard in the game just to find hidden clues. Now, he was actually seeing hope once more in this magical peach wood sword, as if it was some light in the darkness.</p>

      <p>"I once felt an aura very similar to the aura that this Lord Jingke exudes, in a particular place," Devil King said calmly. "I don't know if you have heard of the legendary place known as the Domain of the Gods ... "</p>

      <p>For a moment, everyone fell into deep thought. Zhuo Yi had borne witness to a number of major events one after another in recent months, and had even captured a number of bigwigs himself, but compared with the people around him, his experiences were still too shallow, so naturally he hadn't heard of it. It was the same for Luo Chuang, who despite having eight hundred years more on Zhuo Yi, was only now hearing about this "Domain of the Gods" for the first time.</p>

      <p>"What is this place?" Xiao Yin asked. "I think I've seen it in the books of my clan as a kid ... but it wasn't explained in detail."</p>

      <p>When Xiao Yin said this, Zhuo Yi and Luo Chuang both looked at him.</p>

      <p>The holy beast race had always had long lifespans. While this eight thousand-year-old baby didn't seem very mature, he actually knew quite a lot.</p>

      <p>There thus was indeed a reason why some cultivators chased a long life so persistently.</p>

      <p>If you lived long enough, you would certainly experience different things ...</p>

      <p>"The Domain of the Gods ... the rumor is that this is a godly domain that you can ascend to as long as you possess a certain number of Heavenly Dao."</p>

      <p>"Domain of the Gods? Is there really such a place?" Wang Ming was skeptical.</p>

      <p>"I once had the same disbelieving expression on my face, but after His Majesty Fourth Generation Beast King passed on the position of king of the holy beasts to me, my doubts were dispelled ... the Domain of the Gods does exist, but it is well outside the Milky Way," Devil King said.</p>

      <p>Wang Ming understood right away at these words.</p>

      <p>If this place truly was outside the Milky Way, then there really was nothing to say.</p>

      <p>Given the current level of science and technology, all the satellite probes launched the world over could only explore up to roughly one hundred light years outside the Milky Way.</p>

      <p>In his search for Drought Star, Immortal Zhenyuan didn't even cover a tenth of the space outside the Milky Way ... To fly beyond the Milky Way would take a Venerated Immortal at least ten thousand years of his life.</p>

      <p>Immortal Zhenyuan made just one round trip to find Drought Star, which didn't even cover a tenth of the distance, but had taken him a whole two thousand years.</p>

      <p>If the Domain of the Gods did indeed exist, then would there be guys like Wang Ling there?</p>

      <p>That, in fact, was Wang Ming's main concern.</p>

      <p>He felt that he had really struck the jackpot with this trip into Beast King's tomb this time.</p>

      <p>At the very least, he had uncovered one more avenue to explore in his study of Wang Ling's primordial qi.</p>

      <p>As long as he could invent a magic treasure that could travel beyond the Milky Way to reach the Domain of the Gods in his lifetime, there might be a way to solve the problem of Wang Ling's control over his primordial qi.</p>

      <p>"The rumor is that the realm above Venerated Immortal is Dao Immortal, but there are very strict requirements concerning the number of Heavenly Dao a person must have. Even I am not very clear on this point." Devil King shook his head. The power of the king of holy beasts could be cumulatively passed on from one generation to the next, but after four generations, Devil King's strength was only at Venerated Immortal level.</p>

      <p>Although he had more than twenty Heavenly Dao on him, he was obviously still far from the standard for a Dao Immortal.</p>

      <p>"Is there a way to reach the Domain of the Gods?" Wang Ming continued asking.</p>

      <p>Wang Ming paid more attention to this matter since it had to do with Wang Ling.</p>

      <p>The Domain of the Gods ...</p>

      <p>He felt that Wang Ling's, and even Jingke's secrets might be explained in that place.</p>

      <p>In addition, Wang Ming felt that he needed to expand his knowledge when he returned later.</p>

      <p>Cultivators on Earth had long viewed themselves as the center of the universe.</p>

      <p>He believed that most people, including many current True Immortals, probably didn't know of the existence of the Domain of the Gods.</p>

      <p>Take the Ten Founding Generals for example. How would they feel if they knew that there was an even more heaven-defying Domain of the Gods far beyond the Milky Way?</p>

      <p>It would be very difficult for them to reach the Domain of the Gods with their current strength, but Wang Ming thought it was certainly possible for those Dao Immortals from the Domain of the Gods to come down to Earth if they wanted to.</p>

      <p>Thus followed the question ...</p>

      <p>Right now, on Earth, were there any Almightys from the Domain of the Gods who were observing them in the dark?</p>

      <p>How wide was the civilization gap between the Domain of the Gods and Earth?</p>

      <p>These were all questions that Wang Ming felt he really had to think about.</p>

      <p>While Wang Ming pondered, Zhuo Yi raised a question. "If there really were people on Earth who met the set standard number of Heavenly Dao and ascended to the Domain of the Gods, why isn't there any information on this at all?"</p>

      <p>"If their ascension caught them off guard, they naturally wouldn't have left any information behind, and would be just another missing person. Every year, every month ... even every day, people go missing for no reason in this world and no one knows where they've gone. Besides, there are even fewer records of rumors about the Domain of the Gods on Earth, so naturally, fewer people know of it," Devil King said.</p>

      <p>"But to enter the Domain of the Gods ... I indeed did hear of a way to do so from the last king of holy beasts. If you truly can break open the Heavenly Dao Treasure Box, I'll tell you everything," Devil King said.</p>

      <p>"That's easy."</p>

      <p>Zhuo Yi nodded.</p>

      <p>He then raised the peach wood sword high with both hands. "Lord Jingke, it's up to you!"</p>

      <p>In just a few seconds, Jingke's sword body started to tremble slightly.</p>

      <p>Suddenly, the brown spirit light transformed into a child dressed in a brown tunic and white robe that hovered in front of their eyes.</p>

      <p>"Lord Jingke's true form !!! " Luo Chuang nearly fainted from excitement.</p>

      <p>At the same time, Beast King shivered all over at the aura Jingke was emitting, his whole body freezing up.</p>

      <p>He watched as this sword spirit, who looked just like a ten-year-old boy, walked slowly over to the Heavenly Dao Treasure Box and stretched out his little hand to stroke it, before abruptly gripping it, as if he was squeezing a walnut ...</p>

      <p>Crack ...</p>

      <p>There was a cracking sound from the Heavenly Dao Treasure Box ..</p>
