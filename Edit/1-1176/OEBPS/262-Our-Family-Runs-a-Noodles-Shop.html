  <h1>Chapter 262 Our Family Runs a Noodles Shop! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>This was the first time that Wang Ling was experiencing the sensation of being set up.</p>

    <p>Mystical events did happen sometimes, but while he believed that coincidences might happen in particular situations, if it happened once, twice or even more than that, he would begin to suspect that things weren't what they seemed.</p>

    <p>Hence, the impression that Fang Xing gave Wang Ling was very special.</p>

    <p>That moment when he had been feeling out Fang Xing, and their gazes had met when the other boy had looked out of the corner of his eye... coincidence or not, it made Wang Ling very wary of Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>To guard against Fang Xing was one thing, but Wang Ling never expected the other boy to make the first move and set him up.</p>

    <p>Teacher Ye was naturally very happy with Fang Xing's recommendation. But it wasn't like Teacher Ye didn't have an impression of Wang Ling. During the previous spirit sword exchange meet at Number 59 High School, he had felt that Wang Ling's luck was especially good. Maybe this time... he could also go into battle as a mascot?</p>

    <p>"Student Wang Ling, will you join us?"</p>

    <p>After Fang Xing's recommendation, Teacher Ye looked at Wang Ling with an expression full of hope and sincerity.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>He had actually heard Chen Chao mention the district school sports meet before. But for a sports meet at this level, Wang Ling had felt that there was no way he would fill one of the limited spots as a school representative. He usually kept a low profile in school, and his PE grades were straight down the middle. Furthermore, there were quite a number of new Grade One students this year who were sports talents, including Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>Now that he thought about it carefully, Wang Ling felt like he had sold himself out.</p>

    <p>What a strange flag he had raised <sup>1</sup> for himself!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>("ç«‹ flag" has a similar meaning
to being a jinx.)</dfn>

    <p>In the end, Wang Ling agreed to do it...</p>

    <p>Of course, he had been compelled to agree.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After school that day, Fang Xing walked out of the school gate still surrounded by a bunch of girls. Wang Ling was also leaving school at the same time. Anyway, he was quite a distance away from Fang Xing. For such an eye-catching person, Wang Ling felt that for the moment, the less contact they had with each other, the better.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling could have initially chosen to teleport home, but it just so happened that the old man had come to town today to visit several of his disciples from when he had worked at that first-class hotel before, so he stopped by to pick up Wang Ling on Sheep the tricycle. The most curious thing was that Er Ha had also come along.</p>

    <p>His gaze passing through to the zebra crossing in front of Number 60 High School, Wang Ling saw the old man waiting across the road on a recently serviced Sheep; with the addition of a green-furred akita lying about lazily and wagging its tail, this image really looked a little bizarre.</p>

    <p>The old man had parked in quite a conspicuous spot, and was actually visible to a lot of people, so as soon as school was over, Wang Ling picked up his bag and immediately left the classroom; he wanted to leave quickly, conveniently avoiding Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>"What's the matter, Ling Ling? Why do you look so panicked?" The old man thought it was a little strange.</p>

    <p>Er Ha looked up at Wang Ling and blinked in surprise. It felt that its Little Master Ling didn't seem to be himself today. But very quickly, when it saw Fang Xing say goodbye to that bunch of girls on the other side of the road and then start walking step by step toward them, it instantly guessed what had probably happened...</p>

    <p>This should have been Er Ha's first time seeing Fang Xing, but it felt it was very strange.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing's aura felt indescribably familiar.</p>

    <p>As if Er Ha had smelled it from somewhere before...</p>

    <p>"Ling Ling, is this your classmate?" The old man stared at the approaching Fang Xing for quite a while.</p>

    <p>Soon after that, he gave his first impression of Fang Xing: "Your classmate... has long legs!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Though the old man was getting along in years and had once had dementia, his sense of aesthetics was as sharp as ever. After Father Wang had taught him how to use video-on-demand, he had been constantly studying the otaku culture of today's youth; he could be considered a pretty trendy old man.</p>

    <p>"Hello, grandfather. Are you here to pick up Wang Ling?" Fang Xing drew close and greeted him warmly.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw the old man nod and raise his hand to give the "okay" sign.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing laughed brightly. "Grandfather, you're so interesting."</p>

    <p>"You and our Ling Ling aren't in the same class, right? I don't think I saw you in the class photo taken at the start of the semester," said the old man.</p>

    <p>"My name is Fang Xing. I'm new, and I only just enrolled here the day before yesterday," Fang Xing answered.</p>

    <p>...So he was a transfer student!</p>

    <p>The old man was enlightened... To suddenly transfer schools halfway through the semester, the connections and money behind this person most likely weren't a simple matter. Furthermore, the old man had already painted an image of Fang Xing's parents in his mind. He recalled a line from a skit: Big head and thick neck; if you're not a tycoon, then you're a chef <sup>2</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is from a famous Chinese
New Year skit called "Mai
Guai" or'Selling Crutches .. ')</dfn>

    <p>Hence, if this Classmate Fang Xing's parents weren't rich people, then they might be chefs!</p>

    <p>Instantly, the old man felt that he had found common ground with Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling already didn't know what to say about the old man's strange way of thinking.</p>

    <p>"Student Fang, you're not in the same class as Ling Ling, but you're still schoolmates. I hope you'll take good care of our Ling Ling in the future." The old man looked at Fang Xing and smiled.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, grandfather. Classmate Wang Ling and I will be representing the school at the district sports meet in two weeks. I'll take very good care of him." While Fang Xing said this, he still had a harmless smile on his face and his eyes were creased into slits, deep with meaning.</p>

    <p>But that was what was weird...</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling read his mind, he couldn't find the slightest bit of ill intent in Fang Xing's head.</p>

    <p>This was the strangest person that he had ever met...</p>

    <p>After chatting with the old man for a while, Fang Xing suddenly noticed the food in the tricycle's freight; these were fresh meat and vegetables that the old man's disciples had forcefully sent him off with when he had left the hotel earlier. They filled up half of the tricycle; there were various types of vegetables and fruits, and even a large preserved ham, which was packed in a vacuum bag with the words "Specially Made By Kikkaro Restaurant" on it.</p>

    <p>"Is grandfather a chef?" Fang Xing asked curiously.</p>

    <p>"Yes, but I'm already retired. I'm old and quickly becoming unable to handle a ladle." The old man smiled.</p>

    <p>"What a coincidence!"</p>

    <p>When he heard the old man's response, Fang Xing looked pleasantly surprised. "Grandfather, do you know, my family actually runs a noodles shop."</p>

    <p>"Oh? Noodles shop? What type of noodles do you sell?" The old man was suddenly interested.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing: "All kinds of noodles! But the most famous noodles in our shop is the beef tendon noodles personally handmade by Lanzhou shifu . And we weave the beef tendon noodles into the shape of instant noodles and fry them at high temperatures so that in the end, they become crispy noodle snacks!"</p>

    <p>The old man: "..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "!!!"</p>
