  <h1>Chapter 1043 Why Are the Melon-Eating Masses Called as Such?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Liu Yi had been killed at home in the same manner as the other Magic Treasure Development University students at Divine Leisure Apartments; there were no visible signs of a break-in when they were killed. This person's technique was formidable, and they were instant kills... Whether it was strength, motive, or manner of break-in, when all three were combined together, Father Zheng was undoubtedly the prime suspect.</p>

    <p>The police were suppressing news of the case for now and hadn't made it public yet because the case was really too suspicious. Almost all the key figures in the plagiarism case from three years ago were dead. If Father Zheng had killed them purely for revenge, there was no need for him to deliberately plan and organize this hostage drama at all to let everyone know about this incident from three years ago.</p>

    <p>It would be enough for him to just kill all of his targets of revenge behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>So, the situation now was very clear.</p>

    <p>This was a set-up!</p>

    <p>At the scene, Gao Tian, Xiao Yin and Zhuo Yi all had this same thought after hearing the news that Liu Yi had been killed.</p>

    <p>But right now, they had no idea at all what this second party behind the scenes was.</p>

    <p>In the auditorium, Father Zheng also broke out in a cold sweat. He had been waiting for Liu Yi to come forward of his own accord. Since Liu Yi hadn't shown any signs of repenting after a long while, Father Zheng had been prepared to activate his magic to directly grab Liu Yi on the other end of the screen and interrogate him on the spot.</p>

    <p>In the end, when Father Zheng's spiritual senses infiltrated Liu Yi's place, he saw Liu Yi in front of the computer, already dead...</p>

    <p>His throat had been directly cut open and the blood had sprayed onto the ceiling. Beads of blood dripped down from the scarlet ceiling non-stop; it was like a scene out of a horror movie.</p>

    <p>Dazed, Father Zheng withdrew his spiritual senses.</p>

    <p>Liu Yi was dead...</p>

    <p>Just like that, the most important person in overturning the case's original verdict was gone, which was a massive blow to Father Zheng. Who on earth was it, to actually be able to stay a few steps ahead and even make a move right in front of him?</p>

    <p>Father Zheng was a little afraid of this hidden power. It felt like a curse, as if the intangible power of a curse was thwarting his every move. If he couldn't overturn the case this time, there might not be anyone left after he went to jail who could help clear his son of this injustice that had been buried for three years.</p>

    <p>If he wanted the matter clarified, it had to be here and now, when interest in the case was at its peak.</p>

    <p>Everyone knew that as bystanders, online users would usually pay attention to something for only seven days. A massive incident would ferment online for a short week before it was drowned out by some new event and people ultimately lost interest in it.</p>

    <p>Actually, the situation wasn't necessarily as pessimistic as Father Zheng had imagined, and a very important reason for this was: Zhuo Yi had come.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi's arrival meant that the case would be 100% solved perfectly and would 100% be credited to Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Thanks to Father Zheng, the entire country now knew about this incident. More and more people began to pay attention to the truth of the plagiarism case from three years ago, and naturally, there were students among the melon-eating masses...</p>

    <p>Whether it was Number 60 High's class chat groups or the private "happy study (copy homework)" small chat groups, they were flooded with messages about the Magic Treasure Development University incident.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao had been very depressed in the last two days after running into Old Pan when he had gone out to copy homework, but his gloom had been lifted slightly by the Magic Treasure Development University incident. Scientific research showed that when people ate melons (which in layman terms was known as gossiping), their brains would secrete a hormone called dopamine, which made them feel good and happy. It had more or less the same effect as eating sugar.</p>

    <p>This meant that gossiping and eating sugar could make people feel happy.</p>

    <p>As the saying went, "don't care about things that have nothing to do with you"; why were the melon-eating masses called as such? Because melons were sweet! And something that was sweet could make people happy!</p>

    <p>"I think this injustice against Senior Zheng has to be real." Chen Chao's words in the chat were surprising.</p>

    <p>Anyone else reading the words would think nothing of it, but they made Wang Ling shudder. If he hadn't believed it before, he had to now! Chen Chao's blessed mouth wasn't something he was born with, but which he had cultivated. After exploring Chen Chao's memories last time, Wang Ling had a brand new awareness and understanding of this monstrous mouth...</p>

    <p>"The witness was the key, but now the witness is gone." Guo Hao sighed.</p>

    <p>"Isn't there a Liu Yi? This Father Zheng is holding an entire auditorium hostage to intimidate Liu Yi into coming forward. As long as Liu Yi is willing to come out, everything will be fine. Unless, Liu Yi's dead," Chen Chao added.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "He really is dead..."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "WTF? I was just saying it casually - don't mess around!"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "It's true! I have an uncle at the Police Bureau who told me that Liu Yi died so miserably. Also, he died in exactly the same way as those graduates at Divine Leisure Apartments. Right now, the police's biggest suspect is Father Zheng, since almost all the evidence and the motive point to him."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was stupefied. "..."</p>

    <p>With Chen Chao's mouth and Guo Hao's uncles, these two could absolutely open a detective agency. If they had been born a few decades earlier, the world wouldn't have needed Conan...</p>

    <p>"Ai, then things don't look good now. I saw a lot of people analyzing it online earlier: this Liu Yi was a key person. Father Zheng was counting on Liu Yi to overturn the case. Whether Liu Yi was willing to tell the truth or not, at the very least, Father Zheng needed him alive!" Su Xiao sent a message in the group chat. "As for that Student Fu Fusheng, he doesn't know anything at all and was manipulated by Liu Yi all along. In the end, the mastermind is dead, and there's no one alive who can give us the truth."</p>

    <p>"Not necessarily," Chen Chao said suddenly. "I'm thinking there might be one possibility."</p>

    <p>"What is it?"</p>

    <p>"There might have been other witnesses at the scene three years ago. And there might also have been other witnesses around when Liu Yi died," replied Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sent several question marks. "???"</p>

    <p>"First of all, what I want to say is that I'm not referring to human witnesses. Old buildings like Divine Leisure Apartments will inevitably have cockroaches and ants, right? Maybe they saw what happened three years ago as well as when Liu Yi was killed!" Following another train of thought, Chen Chao said, "I know there's a spell for communicating with living creatures. Guo Hao should know more about this than I do."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao nodded. "There is. If you're a high-ranking pet trainer, you can do it... Maybe we could get Teacher Wei Zhi to help out. Maybe there really is hope. But the problem is, how would we find these cockroaches or ants?"</p>

    <p>"That's a question for Number 59 High's professional pest control team."</p>

    <p>"Number 59 High... pest control team... do you mean..."</p>

    <p>"That's right, it's that bunch of cats that showed up at Number 59 High before, led by that black cat. I heard that after the spirit sword exchange meet, the black cat took the lead in destroying Shadow Stream's headquarters. After that, they became famous and rode the momentum by starting a pest control business," Chen Chao said.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Guo Hao, and Su Xiao: "..."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "I heard that with that black cat as their head, their business has already expanded to cover all of Songhai's major districts. It's much easier for them than it is for us to find cockroaches, ants and whatnot. The most important thing is that they know how to hold back their strength. The people who hire them hate pests like cockroaches and mosquitoes to death, and many want these pests caught alive. Hence, the cats are especially careful when catching the pests. In the end, these things are handed over alive to the clients, who crush them."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
