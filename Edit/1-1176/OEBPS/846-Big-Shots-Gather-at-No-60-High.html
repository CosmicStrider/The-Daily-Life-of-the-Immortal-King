  <h1>Chapter 846 Big Shots Gather at Number 60 High</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Liu Qingyi and Wang Zhen's plan to transfer to Number 60 High wasn't a spur of the moment thing, but the same idea which they had both come up with a long time ago. Unexpectedly, it was also the first time that they more or less tacitly agreed on something.</p>

    <p>As people from the Domain of the Gods, they had to consider a lot of things.</p>

    <p>What kind of place was the Domain of the Gods?</p>

    <p>It was the supreme paradise for cultivators, where the strongest cultivators gathered after ascension. But an unknown variable like this "Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch" had appeared outside of it. As people born in the Domain of the Gods, both of them automatically decided to remain in the world below to continue observing in secret and see what on earth was going on. Ordinarily speaking, there was an ascension mechanism in place in the world below: when one surpassed the Venerated Immortal level, they would automatically be able to sense the location of Nine-fold Star Domain of the Gods, and open the doors of heaven to reach it.</p>

    <p>But this Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch was very strange: he seemed like one who could control all the laws and act completely freely, which was astonishing.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen acknowledged that on his own, he wasn't Wang Ling's match. However, Liu Qingyi was now here...</p>

    <p>If they joined hands, would their strength on the surface be enough to battle Wang Ling to a tie?</p>

    <p>Of course, this was all still unknown, and could only wait until they transferred to Number 60 High and investigated.</p>

    <p>They could always fight at a later date.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, this was a crucial matter of life and death for Nine-fold Star that couldn't be overlooked at all.</p>

    <p>Such a venerable Almighty was hiding himself in a school in the human below, and even had his own family.</p>

    <p>Who on earth was this person?</p>

    <p>Could it be that he faked his family members?</p>

    <p>Was he plotting anything?</p>

    <p>And why was he asking around about the Domain of the Gods?</p>

    <p>And then, what was he planning to do to it?</p>

    <p>In the last few days, Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi had sunk deeper and deeper into their thoughts.</p>

    <p>They felt that it was their time to stand up, investigate the truth, and save the world!</p>

    <p>It had to be said that Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi were truly full of valor.</p>

    <p>It was just a pity that Immortal Toya didn't have the Mind-Reading Ability, otherwise he would definitely stop this stupid move.</p>

    <p>From this, one could see that not only was it human nature to repeat things, thinking too hard was also part of it.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Monday, August 14th.</p>

    <p>It was the first day of the summer break, and also the day when Number 60 High School opened the transfer window. Because it was a more complicated process, the transfer window for Foundation Establishment high schools opened after the final exams every year.</p>

    <p>This year, the number of transfer applicants for Number 60 High was unprecedented. One reason for this was Zhuo Yi, who had become increasingly well-known in Songhai city after arresting several big shots in succession over the past two months and which directly influenced Number 60 High's status in the city.</p>

    <p>It was expected that Number 60 High would already be promoted to a key city high school by next year. Furthermore, the construction fund for the school grounds would be in place during this summer break, and the school would be transformed inside out.</p>

    <p>This was thus a rare opportunity for a lot of parents, when Number 60 High still accepted students based on ordinary high school standards just as the school was about to undergo a dramatic evolution. Many parents were itching to take advantage of this opportunity.</p>

    <p>Everyone knew that Number 60 High's biggest business investor was Huaguo Water Curtain Group! Not only was it the largest pill distributor, even the eldest daughter was studying at Number 60 High. Coupled with Zhuo Yi, who had been in the limelight recently, it was estimated that in another two years, Number 60 High could be promoted from a key city high school to a gold-class high school.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Although the students were on break, it was a very busy time for the director of education's office at Number 60 High; Director Shi had called Lao Gudong and Teacher Pan and asked them to stay back.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High's Golden Core rate had always been low. For Number 60 High to be promoted to a key city high school next year, the Golden Core rate would become an important rank index of measure.</p>

    <p>This was why this round of student enrollment was particularly important. With a quota limit for transfer students and a flood of applications sent in by parents, the school had to select students based on their overall excellence.</p>

    <p>"I'm surprised there's quite a number of quality students." Lao Gudong flipped through the book and saw some familiar names.</p>

    <p>For example, Number 59 High's delinquent senior "Tang Jingze" had actually sent in a transfer application.</p>

    <p>"I remember him. He's a gifted student; it was just that he had a bad reputation in Number 59 High." Teacher Pan pushed up her gold-rimmed glasses and said, "But I think he can join our Grade One, Class Three."</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong: "I thought Teacher Pan would refuse..."</p>

    <p>"I just checked, and there was a clear change in Tang Jingze in the later half of the semester. Right after the spirit sword exchange meet that our class attended, people say it's as if he's become a completely different person. It was all students from our class who went to that exchange meet." Teacher Pan laughed. "It must be their fine manners which straightened out this delinquent!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Mm, we can indeed consider this Tang Jingze."</p>

    <p>Director Shi also nodded as she flipped through another directory. "I think we should now consider the matter of Student Li Mingyao and Student Zhou Youzheng..."</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong was blank for a moment; these two names somehow sounded a little familiar. After recalling them, he was taken aback. "Could these two children be..."</p>

    <p>"That's right!" Director Shi's expression was serious. "These two children are the third scions from Songhai city's four big families. The Li family's skills store business and the Zhou family's artifact-refining business are extremely famous in the circle."</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong was a little puzzled. "These two participated in the summer camp previously, but why do they suddenly want to transfer?"</p>

    <p>"Perhaps it's for someone here... Our Number 60 High will become very famous if they join us. However, they said they must join the elite stream, though they didn't stipulate which class."</p>

    <p>"They didn't come for Sun Rong, did they?" Teacher Pan hmphed. "I forbid my students to have relationships at this age!"</p>

    <p>"That might be the case with anyone else, but definitely not these two." Director Shi said, "I remember when Student Sun Rong first joined Number 60 High, the other three big families of Songhai city did ridicule her a little for it, and these Young Masters Li and Zhou also indirectly mocked her on the school's Tieba forum. The two posts were deleted, but some capable online users dug them out. So, Li and Zhou deciding to transfer this time is for another reason."</p>

    <p>"Was it because of Zhuo Yi?" Lao Gudong broke into a sweat.</p>

    <p>The effect of this "so delicious <sup>1</sup> " law was a little sudden...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A reminder that this is a jibe
at those who do or say one
thing, only to demonstrate
the complete opposite later ..)</dfn>

    <p>Of Songhai city's four big families, three of them had children studying at Number 60 High - once this got out, Number 60 High's impact would roll out in a fierce wave.</p>

    <p>"It's possible!" Teacher Pan immediately nodded like a chicken pecking rice. "After all, he is the most outstanding student I've ever taught!"</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong: "..."</p>

    <p>"No matter who they're here for, we must respond prudently when these two join us. After all, their identities are a little unique..."</p>

    <p>At that moment, Director Shi said, "Apart from them, I looked at the list earlier, and I think the next few students are also good."</p>

    <p>"Oh? Which ones?"</p>

    <p>"Wang Zhen, Liu Qingyi and... Gu Shunzhi." Director Shi said, "Here are their profiles, please have a look."</p>
