  <h1>Chapter 610 From Today Onwards I'm Going to Become a Dog Lover!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Judging from the body of this multi-fanged kun, it was still a baby, but even then it was already very lethal. It was actually able to leap out of space and injure Demon Saint, forcing Demon Saint and Sage Master to use the power of the Holy Pillar to kill it... It sounded a little unimaginable, but it was true.</p>

    <p>"Senior Immortal Zhenyuan said this is a kun?" Second Generation Demon Saint and Shen Wuyue both turned pale with fright.</p>

    <p>They had never seen a kun before as it was a prehistoric creature that was already extinct. After several epochs, they suddenly disappeared in a certain period without leaving even skeletons behind. Since then, these prehistoric creatures had been declared extinct.</p>

    <p>At that time, not only the "kun," but the "qilin,""phoenix,""dragon"... all the other prehistoric creatures disappeared. In comparison, however, the kun was the earliest to become extinct, and there were many types of kun. The multi-fanged kun was just one of them, and it was well-known for its powerful ability to inflict physical damage. Moreover, one of the most striking features of this prehistoric creature was that it had a very diverse energy source inside its body which could change according to the environment.</p>

    <p>After the seal membrane was removed, Er Ha saw that Zhenyuan had opened his Immortal Eye and was impatiently using it to examine this multi-fanged kun from one end to the other. Even without those unusual space rifts, it was already mind-blowing enough that a prehistoric creature like the multi-fanged kun would reappear.</p>

    <p>"This is a kun, and it's still a baby." Immortal Zhenyuan frowned.</p>

    <p>He emphasized the word "baby" to highlight the fact that the multi-fanged kun had been born not long ago.</p>

    <p>Or to think of it in another way... It was possible that these already extinct prehistoric creatures had established a new home in some corner of the universe.</p>

    <p>Whatever the truth of the matter was, the appearance of this multi-fanged kun was a huge discovery.</p>

    <p>At this thought, Zhenyuan turned to Er Ha and said, "Senior Dog, you should have also noticed it, right?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha knew that Zhenyuan was referring to the multi-fanged kun's energy source. Er Ha couldn't be any more familiar with it, and was sure that there was no mistake - this energy source felt exactly the same as the primordial qi on Little Master Ling!</p>

    <p>This was also the main reason why Demon Saint's injury from the attack wasn't healing for now. Primordial qi was very lethal, and it was far from enough to rely purely on demon energy or spirit energy to repair cells.</p>

    <p>Primordial qi wasn't unique to Wang Ling, as he had confirmed previously on Immortal Zhenyuan's body. The fact was that once a cultivator reached Venerated Immortal level, they could indeed activate "primordial qi" as another source of energy apart from spirit energy. However, there was a limit to how much energy this second source could store inside a Venerated Immortal cultivator's body.</p>

    <p>Things had really gotten complicated...</p>

    <p>Looking at the body of this baby multi-fanged kun, Er Ha sniffed it carefully.</p>

    <p>It felt that there was some other scent on it...</p>

    <p>Er Ha instructed Zhenyuan to flip it over, and then abruptly fixed its gaze on the kun's stomach. "There's something inside..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan focused his Immortal Eye and was startled. "There really is something!"</p>

    <p>As expected of Senior Dog! It really was awesome.</p>

    <p>In fact, Er Ha hadn't seen anything. The reason it felt there was something there was purely because of its sense of smell and intuition.</p>

    <p>"What is it?" Second Generation Demon Saint asked.</p>

    <p>Previously, he and Shen Wuyue had already examined the multi-fanged kun's body many times inside out, but had discovered nothing unusual.</p>

    <p>"There's a string here, three inches below the belly button," Immortal Zhenyuan said.</p>

    <p>"String?"</p>

    <p>Second Generation Demon Saint and Shen Wuyue also began to use their own powers of sight to look carefully. Their powers certainly weren't as strong as Zhenyuan's, but following his direction, they did indeed see a floating piece of "string." It was as thin as gossamer and translucent. Furthermore, the end of the thread was already cut off. Without careful examination, it would have gone completely unnoticed.</p>

    <p>And the other scent which Er Ha had sensed earlier on this multi-fanged kun was from this "string."</p>

    <p>"Senior Dog, do you have any ideas?" Everyone stared at this string, lost in deep thought.</p>

    <p>Er Ha suddenly thought of something really terrifying. "I was thinking, this string... could it be a fishing line?"</p>

    <p>Everyone's expressions changed drastically at this conjecture: a fishing line?</p>

    <p>"Senior Dog, are you saying... that this baby multi-fanged kun was just bait? Someone deliberately hooked it up to a fishing line to fish around in space?" Second Generation Demon Saint said.</p>

    <p>This was only speculation, but from the evidence so far, it wasn't impossible.</p>

    <p>If this really was the case, then this already wasn't as simple as just fishing; rather, someone was using this way to kill people...</p>

    <p>The key problem now was the identity and objective of the "angler."</p>

    <p>This was an unknown enemy whom they currently had no information on. Where did this multi-fanged kun come from, and where had it been reared... these were some questions in a string of them which they had no clear answer for at present. But if it really had been reared in captivity, then the identity of this mystery angler was very terrifying.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the kun was just one prehistoric vicious beast type. God knew whether the person that had raised this vicious beast also had other "monsters"...</p>

    <p>"If Senior Dog confronts this angler... what are your chances of victory?" Immortal Zhenyuan asked.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "I should be able to win?"</p>

    <p>Who the hell knew what its odds would be... to be more precise, it should be what Little Master Ling's odds would be. The point was that Little Master Ling wasn't around, so Er Ha didn't dare be too sure of itself.</p>

    <p>"As expected of Senior Dog! You actually can win! Sage Master and I had no chance at all!" Second Generation Demon Saint said.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>"Sage Master and I had already wondered previously whether our two worlds should join hands and work together to deal with this unknown opponent. Since Senior Dog can handle it alone, that would be great!"</p>

    <p>Second Generation Demon Saint was very excited. "I've decided, from today onwards, I'm going to become a dog lover!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan: "That's just like Senior Dog. As long as you take action, you just need to snap your fingers to take down the other party, right?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>'Snap' your sister!</p>

    <p>I'm not Thanos!</p>
