  <h1>Chapter 1046 The Great Earthquake</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In the end, the biggest reason for the meteoric rise of Cockroach Wenqiang and the cockroach gang was the leftovers from the crispy noodle snacks that Wang Ling had eaten. What kind of divine treasure were the leftovers of the Immortal King's crispy noodle snacks? Just a little bit was enough for a small cockroach to grow to the size of a rabbit...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling knew this was his fault, which was why he had come forward to take responsibility now. To be honest, if Chen Chao and Guo Hao hadn't mentioned using a cockroach as a witness, Wang Ling probably wouldn't have remembered this matter.</p>

    <p>Back when the cockroach gang had been at its worst, Wang Ling had thought about solving the problem himself; in the end, it was at that moment that Lee Zheng Tan's independent regiment stepped out and dominated the scene. Wang Ling didn't make a move, because if he did, all the cockroaches in the world would have been destroyed in an instant. Every living creature existed for a reason. Even if cockroaches were pests, they were still part of the food chain. As long as they could be controlled, there in fact wasn't any need to kill every last one of them.</p>

    <p>And now, Wang Ling had once again shown up in his long-unused guise as "Immortal Meow" because he wanted Cockroach Wenqiang to atone for its sins with its own actions.</p>

    <p>So when Wang Ling appeared here, all the cats were utterly stunned. The Monk was already too excited to speak and fell flat on its bottom as it gripped its head with its paws with a disbelieving expression on its face. Wang Ling's Immortal Meow persona had always been a legend in the cat world, and something big always happened every time it appeared. When they saw Wang Ling, all the cats couldn't help kowtowing in worship, and Lee Zheng Tan was no exception.</p>

    <p>Cockroach Wenqiang was astonished when it saw that even Lee Zheng Tan had knelt down after Wang Ling appeared. "So you're the boss behind the cats..." It had been suspicious before: there was no way Lee Zheng Tan could have taken down the cockroach gang with its cats alone. After Wang Ling showed up, Cockroach Wenqiang instantly understood.</p>

    <p>Staring at Cockroach Wenqiang, Wang Ling didn't open his mouth.</p>

    <p>A voice sounded directly in Cockroach Wenqiang's mind.</p>

    <p>In accordance with Immortal Meow's regality, Wang Ling chose to speak telepathically, and requested that Cockroach Wenqiang testify in court.</p>

    <p>In the end, Cockroach Wenqiang had a very tough attitude. "The terms you agreed to before can't be changed, or don't expect me to testify! In any case, you can't beat me to death, and I won't starve to death here either. Let's see who dies first!"</p>

    <p>Its attitude was so vile that Wang Ling choked on his words. This cockroach that had grown this big on the leftovers from Wang Ling's crispy noodle snacks, and who was so arrogant about how invulnerable it was, had actually learned how to act like a tyrant? Wang Ling felt that he had to teach Cockroach Wenqiang a lesson.</p>

    <p>Hence, in the next moment, Wang Ling lifted his cat paw and ordered Lee Zheng Tan to release Cockroach Wenqiang from the fish tank.</p>

    <p>Cockroach Wenqiang was a little stunned. It didn't know what this white cat, which had suddenly shown up, was capable of, but since it could boss Lee Zheng Tan around, its realm should be higher than Lee Zheng Tan's, right?</p>

    <p>Golden Core? Nascent Soul?</p>

    <p>Cockroach Wenqiang assessed Wang Ling's realm, and felt that the white cat's level was only just so - it didn't know exactly what breed the cat was, but how high could a spirit beast's realm go? Cockroach Wenqiang had provoked all the spirit beasts in the Pet Trainers Guild before, and none of them had been able to directly kill it.</p>

    <p>It was a cockroach that had endured blows from Soul Formation cultivators - what kind of battles had it not seen?</p>

    <p>How ridiculous.</p>

    <p>After it was released from the goldfish tank, Cockroach Wenqiang could breathe free air once again. It stared at Wang Ling and crossed its legs in a very arrogant manner. "Let's hear it, how do you want to fight? I'm telling you, I'm a cockroach that can't be killed."</p>

    <p>All the cats: "..."</p>

    <p>Lee Zheng Tan started to cover its face with its paws. It had never seen someone court death so much...</p>

    <p>But this was normal. Wang Ling's Immortal Meow persona was no more than a legend in the cat world which only the old cats of Lee Zheng Tan's generation knew about; it was only by hearing the stories from the old cats that newborn kittens learned about "Immortal Meow," and even fewer cats had seen Immortal Meow for real.</p>

    <p>Lee Zheng Tan's independent regiment thus seemed more like a cat group favored by Wang Ling. The cats in the independent regiment had already seen Wang Ling no less than three times. This was also why many cats were willing to follow Lee Zheng Tan; in their eyes, Lee Zheng Tan was a cat favored by "god." If they followed Commander Lee, good things might happen to them.</p>

    <p>But there was no way for Cockroach Wenqiang to understand the beliefs of the cat world. It even started to taunt Wang Ling, and was certain that Wang Ling's slap couldn't hurt it at all. "How about this, let's make a bet. If you can knock me out with one swat, I'll testify."</p>

    <p>It could be said that this was the first time that Wang Ling had ever met such an arrogant cockroach... Even the Old Devil and Evil Sword God had seen their lives flash in front of their eyes after Wang Ling slapped them - the moment they were slapped, they were convinced they were going to die.</p>

    <p>Cockroach Wenqiang, on the other hand, actually thought that it would only be knocked out at worst - this baffling confidence annoyed Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Of course, he wouldn't swat Cockroach Wenqiang to death, since he needed Cockroach Wenqiang to find a witness from back then.</p>

    <p>But he could still teach Cockroach Wenqiang a lesson.</p>

    <p>Gathering a measure of strength, Wang Ling imbued his paw with primordial qi. Deep blue streams of air instantly sprang up out of his paw, rising up like colored vapor.</p>

    <p>The materialization of spiritual energy...</p>

    <p>The cats were petrified.</p>

    <p>It could only be said that Immortal Meow was in the end Immortal Meow... This was the manifestation of spiritual power at its peak, and was proof of a high concentration of spiritual energy, which led directly to spiritual qi taking the form of vapor when it was released.</p>

    <p>It was the sign of an expert.</p>

    <p>Because there were very few cultivators that could materialize "spiritual energy."</p>

    <p>Cockroach Wenqiang broke out in a cold sweat. It never expected this white cat to be so different from any spirit beast it had ever seen before. Even a Soul Formation cultivator couldn't materialize spiritual energy... unless the cat was...</p>

    <p>At True Immortal level?</p>

    <p>A True Immortal cat?</p>

    <p>How was that possible?</p>

    <p>Cockroach Wenqiang was alarmed. If that really was the case, then this Immortal Meow could be recorded down in The Cultivation Encyclopedia as an object of historical research. How could there be a living spirit beast like this in the world?</p>

    <p>"Ready?" The next moment, Wang Ling opened his mouth and spoke in his form as Immortal Meow for the first time.</p>

    <p>Before Cockroach Wenqiang could react, that paw pulsing with power was already flying toward Cockroach Wenqiang. In the blink of an eye, hundreds of li around Number 59 High started to shake violently in a great earthquake...</p>

    <p>And just as Wang Ling's paw was about to land on Cockroach Wenqiang's head, Cockroach Wenqiang was so scared it fainted...</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling withdrew his paw just in time.</p>

    <p>No one expected this sudden earthquake.</p>

    <p>Songhai was a coastal city and didn't sit on any cracks in the earth's crust. Earthquakes were very rare events. The magnitude of this sudden earthquake was 12.0, and it lasted for two seconds... Although it didn't cause any damage, this slap of Wang Ling's was in the end recorded down in The Cultivation Encyclopedia by geological experts, and caused human cultivators to reflect on protecting the natural environment.</p>

    <p>Only Wang Ling and Lee Zheng Tan's cat regiment knew that this "great earthquake" had been triggered just to scare a cockroach...</p>
