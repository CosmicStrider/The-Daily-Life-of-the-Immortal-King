  <h1>Chapter 778 Liar Wang</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Devil King's face lit up with rare excitement at the sound of the Heavenly Dao Treasure Box breaking. He never expected that they would really be able to break it open.</p>

    <p>When the treasure box broke, dazzling golden light suddenly burst out of the cracks, blinding everyone.</p>

    <p>Devil King struggled to open the Holy King Eye to clearly see what on earth was inside the box.</p>

    <p>However, it seemed that he had underestimated the aura of the Domain of the Gods contained within the Heavenly Dao Treasure Box. It was like a formless smokescreen occupying the inside of the box. The instant the box was opened, the aura flowed along the cracks - he actually couldn't see through this golden light at all with the power of his Holy King Eye.</p>

    <p>"Golden light?"</p>

    <p>While they had yet to clearly see what was inside the box, everyone present had amazed expressions on their faces.</p>

    <p>Given this momentum...</p>

    <p>The thing sealed inside definitely wasn't ordinary!</p>

    <p>"Can our holy beast race really be saved?!" Xiao Yin was extremely emotional.</p>

    <p>From the moment he saw Devil King and learned that the grand king of holy beasts was still alive, he had been holding in his feelings all this time.</p>

    <p>Now, they flared even higher.</p>

    <p>What on earth could be inside the box?</p>

    <p>A heaven-defying magic treasure that could change fate, or reverse and change everything?</p>

    <p>A magic array?</p>

    <p>Or a special skill?</p>

    <p>Could it be the legendary "Wang Jingze Fried Rice <sup>1</sup> "?</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Refers to a spoilt teenager on a variety show who was forced to stay in the countryside. After insisting he would rather die or starve than eat the poor food, he changed his tune after eating fried rice and praising it with 真香, "smells good." This has become a meme to mock someone for doing an about face.)</dfn>

    <p>Xiao Yin was extremely curious.</p>

    <p>The golden light emanating from the Heavenly Dao Treasure Box lasted for roughly two or three minutes. Finally, the glow from the broken treasure box faded, and the inside of the box was laid bare to everyone's gazes.</p>

    <p>In the end, everyone was blank.</p>

    <p>Because.</p>

    <p>There was nothing inside the box...</p>

    <p>"Empty?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin scratched his head and looked a little frantic. "How can that be..."</p>

    <p>"Tsk..." Wang Ming cocked an eyebrow, as if he had realized something.</p>

    <p>"Could it be that this box wasn't meant to be opened by force? Or the instant it opened, the thing inside transformed... falling once it touches gold, withering once it touches wood, melting once it touches water, burning once it touches fire, sinking once it touches earth <sup>2</sup> ? Is it possible that it turned into a butterfly and flew away like the Fragrant Concubine in some TV show <sup>3</sup> ?" Luo Chuang said.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(A description of ginseng fruit from "Journey to the West.")</dfn>
    
    <br/>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(From the TV drama "Princess Pearl..")</dfn>

    <p>"... Impossible." Devil King shook his head and sighed with a face full of disappointment. "While I couldn't clearly see what was inside the box, I would still have sensed if something had come out..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming wore a thoughtful expression, chin in hand. Looking at this outcome, it was very clear that this Heavenly Dao Treasure Box was just a scam...</p>

    <p>However, since the Heavenly Dao Treasure Box was from someone of the Domain of the Gods, that Daoist must have his own true objective.</p>

    <p>Although, Wang Ming still didn't know exactly what that objective was...</p>

    <p>Was there really a way to revive the holy beasts in this world? If so, then what was this empty box suggesting? Pouring cold water on the holy beast race after offering hope... Wang Ming was astonished that there could be such an unreasonable person in this world.</p>

    <p>Or, was this all simply for the sake of buying time? Perhaps it really was possible to revive the holy beast race, but to prevent Devil King from discovering the secret of this revival, this person had set up this scam so that Devil King would be stuck in the game world looking for clues for a thousand years.</p>

    <p>Devil King had been trying so hard for a thousand years, and this was the ending he finally got in return...</p>

    <p>He was naturally unsatisfied, but even then, what could he do?</p>

    <p>That was an Almighty from the Domain of the Gods; Devil King hadn't had any other choice except to believe him.</p>

    <p>At least, when he had practically fallen into despair back then after learning that the holy beast race had become extinct, it was this Heavenly Dao Treasure Box that had given him hope and courage to continue living.</p>

    <p>Perhaps this had been a well-meaning white lie?</p>

    <p>At this thought, there was immediately some relief on Devil King's face. The king of holy beasts should have the bearing of one.</p>

    <p>In comparison, however, Xiao Yin looked a lot more upset. He refused to believe such an ending... The most important thing was that he realized he had been tricked again!</p>

    <p>Back then, he had also been duped into joining Immortal Mansion by the Master of Immortal Mansion! They clearly hadn't had the means to cure Miss Ya Xuan, but he had foolishly believed that a miracle would happen... So he had become a thug for Immortal Mansion for a period of time.</p>

    <p>He realized that it seemed he was prone to being tricked!</p>

    <p>Where was the most basic trust between people?!</p>

    <p>"Look!" Just then, Zhuo Yi picked up a splinter of the box. "There seems to be an inscription on this fragment?"</p>

    <p>Everyone turned to look at it. Devil King took a closer look and found that it was a character in the language of the immortals. If it was translated... it read as "Wang."</p>

    <p>"Do the other fragments have words on them?" Wang Ming asked.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi examined all the fragments on the ground and then shook his head. "Only this one."</p>

    <p>"If I'm guessing correctly, this character... should represent the surname of the box's owner," Luo Chuang said suddenly.</p>

    <p>"Why do you think so?"</p>

    <p>"This Heavenly Dao Treasure Box clearly isn't an ordinary item. Its creator would definitely have left his mark on this magic treasure when he created it, like a signature. But this method is really a little old-fashioned. Nowadays, most craftsmen don't sign them."</p>

    <p>"Why is that?"</p>

    <p>"Because when a magic treasure is resold, some resellers will engrave it with their own names. If a magic treasure changes hands many times, there will often be a string of names left on it. By then, it's no longer clear who the actual creator is," Luo Chuang said. "Thus, what most craftsmen do now is to engrave their magic artifacts with a QR code!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Plus, the QR code is designed to be placed inside the magic artifact, and its overall quality is very special, so it won't fade easily. It's no use even if you try to cover it up. This is now the most reliable way of preventing forgeries. Signatures and whatnot are long outdated. On the flip-side, this does show that this senior is very old!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"His last name is Wang." At that moment, Devil King revealed the translation of that immortal character.</p>

    <p>The result stunned everyone...</p>

    <p>Because they remembered that Devil King had said earlier that this senior expert had dead fish eyes, and now his surname proved to be Wang...</p>

    <p>If this was a game of "guess who" among friends, the first person most people would think of was Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>How could it be such a coincidence?</p>

    <p>"Liar Wang!!" Xiao Yin grit his teeth with some resentment on his face. "The same surname Wang, and the same dead fish eyes... but how can their characters be so different?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin couldn't understand it.</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>"How can you be so sure it isn't Ling Zhenren?" Luo Chuang asked.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "Don't talk rubbish... There isn't even the faintest scent of crispy noodle snacks inside this box at all!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Plus, Master's handwriting is so much better!!!!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
