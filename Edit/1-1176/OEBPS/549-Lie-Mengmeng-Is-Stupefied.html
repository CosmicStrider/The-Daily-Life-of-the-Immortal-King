  <h1>Chapter 549 Lie Mengmeng Is Stupefied! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>As administrator, Lord Diulei rarely popped up in the cultivation forum. He only came on to handle any disputes forum members might have, and he hardly ever posted anything in support of anyone.</p>

    <p>Actually, Wang Ling had always felt that Lord Diulei's appeal shouldn't be underestimated. As soon as this renowned "Great Death-Courting Senior" in the cultivation circle posted, it almost immediately spread throughout the circle.</p>

    <p>In less than ten minutes, there were already close to a thousand replies on this "Summit War" post.</p>

    <p>"The hell?! Senior Immortal actually popped up!"</p>

    <p>"I never thought Senior Immortal would also be following this book! He's actually helping Wang Situ campaign for votes, it looks like he's a true fan!"</p>

    <p>"Cry cry cry! I really like Uncle Wang Situ! But Spirit Sword Sect also has an event on! They say that if you give Braised Pork Shoulder twenty monthly votes, they'll send you a tray of frozen Wang Lu sashimi<sup>1</sup> as a gift!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Wang Lu is the protagonist of the Chinese novel "Once Upon A Time, There Was A Spirit Sword Mountain." The running joke is that he can prepare all kinds of sashimi dishes.)</dfn>

    <p>"Senior Immortal, you are a real comrade! [Fist Salute] [Fist Salute] But Wang Situ is fighting a losing battle in the monthly votes this time... The gap is already too big."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Reading these comments, Lord Diulei's heart was as clear as a mirror. There was actually a limit to what he could do with the cultivation forum's resources; he could only help create momentum and vocalize his support for Father Wang at the most. After all, the target users in the cultivation forum and on Cultivation Chinese Network were different; it was almost impossible for a single post to turn the tide in the number of votes.</p>

    <p>As a result of the double monthly votes campaign, Father Wang was currently falling behind by nearly a million votes.</p>

    <p>Generally speaking, the true explosion happened on the final day of the monthly votes battle or in the final hour of the double monthly votes campaign.</p>

    <p>But whether it was the Spirit Sword Sect which backed Braised Pork Shoulder or the Divine Dynasty Sect which backed Braised Pig Feet in Sauce, both of these heavenly-level sects had yet to demonstrate real force.</p>

    <p>Looking at the ranking chart, Lord Diulei couldn't help frowning.</p>

    <p>When all was said and done, these were heavenly-level sects.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei, on the other hand, just ran an online forum. He had earned quite a fair bit over the years, but if he were to go head to head with a heavenly-level sect, he would definitely lose. Nowadays, there were actually plenty of companies that had started as online businesses first before expanding into the real economy. Lord Diulei had in fact been harboring a bold idea all this time â€” he also wanted to establish a sect!</p>

    <p>It was just that this wouldn't be easy - if you wanted to achieve something, you needed to put in the effort. Construction, planning, philosophy, school system, business model, enrolment regulations... He had to think about all of this.</p>

    <p>But at the rate that the cultivation forum was growing, even if he could settle all the above issues, the sect would at best only qualify as earth level in the final appraisal.</p>

    <p>An earth-level sect was not Lord Diulei's goal!</p>

    <p>Since he wanted to do it, he had to go all the way!</p>

    <p>Of course, that was a story for later...</p>

    <p>The most important thing now was to campaign for votes for Senior Wang!</p>

    <p>Although heavenly-level sects had a very solid foundation, the cultivation forum's online influence also wasn't low!</p>

    <p>Besides, he still had a general whom he had yet to mobilize!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was just about to open the live streaming program to look for Daoist Guang when the latter directly sent him a private message. "Brother Lei! Is Senior Wang's novel calling for votes now? I just advertised it for Senior Wang in the live stream room!"</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang attached a screenshot of the live stream room; at the very top, he had posted a link to Father Wang's novel in big, bold characters. His live stream room numbers now held steady at over ten million people! He had almost become the big brother of the live streaming entertainment circle!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Thank you for your support, Brother Guang!"</p>

    <p>However, Lord Diulei was now confronted with the same kind of problem advertisers faced.</p>

    <p>Because the audience was different, there was a limit to the number of people who could help Father Wang.</p>

    <p>After all, not all of these ten million people read novels, and not all of them were rich - most of Daoist Guang's fans were very young. And if one had to know, the top position on Daoist Guang's fans list was still occupied by Father Wang's registered ID [Has Three Days And Two Sleeps Been Updated]!</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang sighed and typed in reply, "But Brother Lei, I don't think the results are very good... I just heard the water friends say that there are two heavenly-level sects backing the other two writers' books. If we rely on just your and my strength to wrestle with established heavenly-level sects, I'm afraid we're not their match."</p>

    <p>At this time, Dharmaraja in the group sent a message. "Senior Wang's votes have increased very quickly, it's now at 1.2 million. But the other two writers already have almost two million votes..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei frowned. "So it's a consistent difference of eight hundred thousand votes..."</p>

    <p>"How about we think up other ways? Like rigging the votes..."</p>

    <p>"Absolutely not!" Lord Diulei shook his head at once and replied, "Since the votes of these two writers weren't rigged, but were due to the support from heavenly-level sects, I'm afraid that we'll become laughingstocks if we got found out for helping push Senior Wang up. And most importantly, his reputation will also suffer."</p>

    <p>After Lord Diulei said this, the group immediately fell into a deep silence.</p>

    <p>All of a sudden, Nine Times Man, who had been silent in the group the whole time, sent a fist salute emoji at that moment. "Everyone, I will offer up five hundred thousand monthly votes to Senior Wang later."</p>

    <p>At this message, the chat group instantly exploded.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "???"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "???"</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren: "???"</p>

    <p>Lightning Dharmaraja: "Damn, it turns out Nine Times Man is an invisible tyrant!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>In fact, when he saw this, Wang Ling already knew... Father Wang had most likely already contacted that strongest fan of his.</p>

    <p>In the end, this was one of the Ten Founding Generals...</p>

    <p>If it was five immortal gold bars for a monthly vote, five hundred thousand monthly votes would come to 2.5 million immortal gold bars!</p>

    <p>This was just too terrifying!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, Lie Mengmeng was still nervously waiting in front of the TV, but Father Wang was watching a drama, so Lie Mengmeng could only use his phone to check the chart.</p>

    <p>He was gratified to see that Father Wang's votes continued to increase, but while the gap was getting smaller, it was clearly still far from enough.</p>

    <p>"I'm going to the bathroom." Father Wang patted Lie Mengmeng on the shoulder.</p>

    <p>Father Wang's butt had barely left the sofa when Lie Mengmeng grabbed the TV remote to switch to the channel for the monthly votes count.</p>

    <p>After flipping through a few channels, however, he felt something was off with some of the TV programs...</p>

    <p>[Cultivation Sports Channel]</p>

    <p>At the world table tennis championships, a male player from their country with the surname Ma was giving a moving speech after receiving the gold medal. "I'm grateful! I want to thank my country! I want to thank my parents! I want to thank my coach! I want to thank my training partners who were with me the whole way. I also want to thank Lao Gudong Situ's The Live Streaming Life of the Immortal King for bringing me joy! Whenever I felt like I couldn't carry on anymore, it was Lao Gudong Situ's book that encouraged me! Everybody, please cast a monthly vote for him, thank you!"</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng: "???"</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng changed the channel with a befuddled expression on his face.</p>

    <p>[Cultivation Food Channel]</p>

    <p>A chef was being interviewed by a reporter on the street. "Mr Chuangzhen<sup>2</sup>, how do you find inspiration for the various culinary delights that you create?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is the Chinese pronunciation of the name of the protagonist in "Shokugeki no Soma," a manga and anime series set in a culinary school ..)</dfn>

    <p>This chef called Chuangzhen smiled slightly into the camera and gave a V sign. "Of course it's by reading The Live Streaming Life of the Immortal King! Lao Gudong Situ writes very well! 666!"</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng: "???"</p>

    <p>Another channel...</p>

    <p>[Cultivation News Broadcast]</p>

    <p>A female newsreader sat upright and solemn as she reported the international news. "Today, in response to Mixiu nation making unnecessary trouble, the spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense, Minister Shi, has said that he will see the matter through to the end..."</p>

    <p>After saying this, she suddenly paused.</p>

    <p>Because at that moment, she was suddenly handed a document from the side. Thanks to her professional bearing, she remained unruffled. "Everyone, the following is urgent news!"</p>

    <p>The female newscaster lowered her head and skimmed the contents of the document before quickly looking up once more. "Please offer up your monthly votes to The Live Streaming Life of the Immortal King by author Wang Situ! Thank you!"</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng was utterly stupefied. "What the fuck!!!</p>
