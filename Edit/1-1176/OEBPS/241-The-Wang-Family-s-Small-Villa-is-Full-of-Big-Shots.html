  <h1>Chapter 241 The Wang Family's Small Villa is Full of Big Shots! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>At this moment, the man from Immortal Mansion's eastern branch completely understood that this was a meaningless battle — from the beginning, he hadn't had the slightest chance of winning!</p>

    <p>"Are you from Immortal Mansion?" Just then, from the side, he heard a question asked in a rough voice, and two huge shadows loomed over him with a sense of heavy oppression. Two brawny men with muscles as large as Jinhua ham <sup>1</sup> and who were actually even bigger than he was appeared in front of him!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Jinhua ham is a type of
dry-cured ham named after
the city of Jinhua, where it is
produced, in the Zhejiang
province of eastern China.)</dfn>

    <p>Where on earth had they come from?</p>

    <p>No... wait!</p>

    <p>There seemed to be a third person!</p>

    <p>The man was startled as he lifted his gaze — only then did he notice that in addition to these two brawny men, there was actually a little girl with pink meatball-shaped hair buns and wearing a gray coat sitting on the shoulder of one of the men, her head tilted to look at him.</p>

    <p>He already felt completely overwhelmed. It wasn't just this sword spirit, these three people who had come out who knew when were in fact all stronger than him!</p>

    <p>If he had a second chance, he just wanted to call his leader and tell him: Chief! I don't want to play anymore!</p>

    <p>This wasn't a matter of whether he played or not, but that he couldn't play at all!</p>

    <p>"There's no other way..." The burly man from Immortal Mansion was desperate. The situation had grown further and further out of his expectations, and was completely out of his control.</p>

    <p>The only thing he could do now was to think of the best way to escape!</p>

    <p>Fortunately, he had made sufficient preparations before coming here, which included the "underground escape talisman." As long as this talisman was successfully activated, it would give him a chance to escape, even if these people's realms were higher than his.</p>

    <p>His mind whirled with myriad thoughts in the space of a single instant.</p>

    <p>He had to take advantage of the moment to escape before this frightening sword spirit and these three people on the side completely teamed up against him. His hands swiftly formed a seal and at the same time, he threw out the underground escape talisman which he had already prepared!</p>

    <p>The instant the magic lit up, the ground beneath the man's feet suddenly turned into quicksand, and his whole body dropped down into it.</p>

    <p>To ensure that he wouldn't be caught, he even cast the "art of godly movement" on himself! This was an advanced heavenly spirit technique and also an Immortal Mansion secret body spell for putting on speed.</p>

    <p>With this "art of godly movement" enhancing the underground escape talisman, the man was now five times faster than the talisman's basic speed of escape. He felt that at his current speed, he should be able to (probably) put some distance between himself and those four people.</p>

    <p>Jingke saw the man get sucked down swiftly into the quicksand as he disappeared in the magic light of the underground escape talisman.</p>

    <p>Seeing that the talisman had worked, the man who had escaped underground in the magic light breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>But he hadn't even made it halfway when the talisman was forced to stop working.</p>

    <p>Up ahead in the tunnel, a little girl's face appeared.</p>

    <p>The little girl stared at him, then stretched out her small hands to directly pull him out of the ground...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Less than ten seconds after the man had used the underground escape talisman to flee, Sheep jumped out a long distance away before coming back.</p>

    <p>Jingke saw that she was holding a dog leash in her small hand, which was directly connected to a collar around the man's neck.</p>

    <p>Both Pen and Eraser were startled; Father Wang had bought this collar and leash for Er Ha, but it had been unwilling to put them on, so it had hidden them in the attic. Who knew when they had ended up in Sheep's hands.</p>

    <p>With the dog leash in her small hand, Sheep threw the man in front of the two brawny men and sat on him. "...Too weak! He ran so slowly! I even specially went upstairs to get the collar and leash just now, but I never thought that he wouldn't run very far."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>The man wanted to cry... it turned out that there was a group of big shots in this villa whom he hadn't been able to sense.</p>

    <p>Jingke crouched down and stretched out one hand to cover the man's forehead. Instantly the man was soaked in sweat as he felt like he was about to be executed.</p>

    <p>There clearly wasn't the slightest trace of spiritual pressure about him, yet the oppression he was giving off was immense. His gaze alone felt like a death stare <sup>2</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is probably referring to
the online Luigi Death Stare
meme ..)</dfn>

    <p>Jingke had already felt out the other party's aura in the previous confrontation, but he hadn't been certain. Now, after careful consideration, he confirmed that this man was from Immortal Mansion.</p>

    <p>His spirit energy was exactly the same as that of the red-haired youth who had wielded the sword Abyss Avoidance in the fight against the old devil at Lord Diulei's place back then.</p>

    <p>After that, Jingke raised his hand. Several brown spheres of sword qi clustered around his fingers, and he slapped them onto the man's head.</p>

    <p>He used the sword qi to seal the man's spirit acupuncture points. For a long while after this, the man wouldn't be able to use his spirit energy.</p>

    <p>"What should we do with him, Lord Jingke?" Pen and Eraser, the two brawny men, looked at Jingke.</p>

    <p>"Ling, dislikes, trouble."</p>

    <p>Jingke looked at the man on the ground and said, "You, handle him, it's fine. I want, to rest."</p>

    <p>They had caught the man and furthermore had sealed his spirit energy, so Jingke couldn't be bothered to deal with everything else. It would be fine to leave the rest to the others to handle.</p>

    <p>As he yawned, the sword light glowed on his skin once again, and in the end, he transformed back into a sword which fell into the hands of one of the burly men nearby. "Put me, back, in bed."</p>

    <p>Pen and Eraser: "..."</p>

    <p>The man rubbed his eyes. When he saw Jingke change back into his original form, he thought he had seen wrong.</p>

    <p>In the end, he was stupefied once again; he had never ever expected that the real body of such a powerful sword spirit would actually be a peach wood sword commonly found on the market...</p>

    <p>"What should we do with him? Throw him into the toilet?" Pen asked with a sigh as he held Jingke in his hand and looked at the man on the ground.</p>

    <p>"Not a good idea." Eraser shook his head. "This Immortal Mansion keeps coming to make trouble for us. Since we managed to catch one of them, we can interrogate him for information."</p>

    <p>Pen: "But the Lord's not at home right now."</p>

    <p>"It's fine, I have Lord Diulei's number, I'm sure he'll definitely be interested." While saying this, Eraser took out a cellphone and made a call.</p>

    <p>Soon, Lord Diulei's magnetic voice came over the line. "Hello, this is Thunder. What can I do for you, Your Excellency?"</p>

    <p>"Is that Senior Lord Diulei? This is Ling Zhenren's enlightened goblin eraser. We just caught someone from Immortal Mansion trying to break into the Wang family's villa. Are you interested in popping by?" asked the burly man.</p>

    <p>"Oh, so it's you. I know you." Lord Diulei laughed. "Now that you mentioned it, I just remembered, didn't Dharmaraja go over to your place today to deliver a sword? Didn't he fight?"</p>

    <p>Eraser was quiet before he decided to tell the truth. "This person from Immortal Mansion is very strong; before Senior Dharmaraja could act, he was defeated by the backlash from the other party's aura."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Before he fought... he already lost?"</p>

    <p>"Regretfully, Senior Lord Diulei, that's the truth."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei took a deep breath and said, "I'm going to kick him out of the group! How shameful!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
