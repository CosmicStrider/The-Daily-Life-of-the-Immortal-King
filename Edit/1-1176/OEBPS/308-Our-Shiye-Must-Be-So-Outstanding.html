  <h1>Chapter 308 Our Shiye Must Be So Outstanding! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Actually, even Zhuo Yi himself didn't realize how far his reputation had spread.</p>

    <p>It didn't just have to do with his relationship with Secretary Dakang; it was also because of the major events that had happened around him.</p>

    <p>It had started after he officially became Deputy Director of the General Administration of 100 Schools following the Gate Between Worlds incident six years ago. Then there was the incident a few months ago when Jiang Liuying, the younger sister of the Master of Shadow Stream, was arrested, escaped, and recaptured. The most terrifying thing was that even the arrest of the old devil had had something to do with him.</p>

    <p>It could be said that after Zhuo Yi had chosen this path to serve the people, he had experienced a meteoric and smooth rise in his professional career, and had been involved in several major events, something that some people might never be able to achieve their whole lives. Just thinking about it could make a person's hair stand on end.</p>

    <p>So when the police uncle saw Zhuo Yi's face, his reaction wasn't as simple as just his hair standing on end; it felt like his head was going to explode.</p>

    <p>"Zhuo... Zhuo... Director Zhuo? Why are you here?"</p>

    <p>The police uncle was so shocked that he was incoherent. "I'll call the chief over!"</p>

    <p>This was a big shot. Although he was a leader in Songhai city, which was several cities away from Winter city, the police uncle didn't dare offend him at all. This was a legendary figure who could bring down even the old devil... he couldn't afford to provoke him.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was startled by the police uncle's reaction. "..." He felt that this police uncle had misunderstood something...</p>

    <p>Seeing the police uncle go up ahead to get his chief, Zhuo Yi pointed to his face and asked Zhao Kai, "Am I so scary?"</p>

    <p>Zhao Kai couldn't help snickering. "Since the old devil's arrest, the rumors about <em>shifu </em>are different in each city. As for public opinion... where there's truth, there are lies, and some news have deliberately exaggerated facts to draw attention."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "...Then what do they say about me?"</p>

    <p>Zhao Kai: "I don't know about the situation in other cities, but a widely circulated version in Winter city is that <em>shifu </em>assisted General Yi and set up the Five Elements Great Array together, and then used the Mouth EscapeTechnique <sup>1</sup> to make the old devil cry on the spot and surrender."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is a term coined by
netizens to describe how the
titular protagonist of the
'Naruto' series is always able
to successfully persuade
others with his words and
determination ..)</dfn>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>"This is all gossip, <em>shifu </em>, don't pay any attention to it." Zhao Kai scratched the back of his head.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi looked at him. "Then... what do you think the truth is?"</p>

    <p>"I think it's half true and half false." Zhao Kai laughed out loud. "If it was all true, given how awesome <em>shifu </em>is, then <em>shiye </em>must truly be so outstanding!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>As they were speaking, the police uncle who had run off earlier had already brought his chief back with him, a middle-aged man who looked very upright; from his well-ironed uniform, one could tell that he was a very organized person.</p>

    <p>Out of courtesy, Zhuo Yi directly got out of the car without putting on any official airs. The middle-aged chief was stunned and hurriedly went forward to greet him by shaking his hand as he smiled. "I've long heard of Deputy Zhuo's reputation. It was truly hard on you to travel all this way to Winter city. Is Director Zhuo here this time for work or personal reasons?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi thought it over for a bit before directly saying, "For work."</p>

    <p>It was impossible for him to give his <em>shifu </em>up, and he had told Zhao Kai before they had arrived at Sanyuan Road to say absolutely nothing about Ling Zhenren and his gang being here.</p>

    <p>His <em>shifu </em>had always liked to keep a low profile. If the media happened to take pictures of this incident, <em>shifu </em>would be very unhappy!</p>

    <p>After thinking about it, Zhuo Yi cleared his throat and continued, "That, I'm overseeing this operation across cities... I didn't have time to report to the higher-ups beforehand."</p>

    <p>After listening to Zhuo Yi, the police officers were all bewildered. "Huh?"</p>

    <p>"Not long ago, our Songhai city's General Administration of 100 Schools received reports about criminals suspected of kidnapping students, so our General Administration immediately launched an investigation. In the end, following the clues led us here to a massive dark force organization..." Zhuo Yi had thought of this in the car â€” it was just something that he had simply made up. "The spatial wall you see here was actually destroyed by our people."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>The police officers, including the chief, all gasped.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi flashed a glance at the name and police number on the chief's chest, and discovered that the chief's surname was Yu and his given name was Yue.</p>

    <p>"Chief Yu Yue! I must reflect on myself! I... I'm late!" Suddenly, Zhuo Yi stared at the chief and went forward to clasp his hands with a remorseful expression.</p>

    <p>Chief Yu: "..."</p>

    <p>"This is a secret operation which our superiors assigned us, and Secretary Dakang personally signed off on it. As the commander of this mission, it's my fault that I didn't contact Winter city's government beforehand!"</p>

    <p>"...It's fine, it's fine, don't worry, Director Zhuo. It's also my fault for not understanding the situation in advance." Chief Yu felt greatly overwhelmed.</p>

    <p>Then Zhao Kai and the rest of the police officers saw the two leaders bow and apologize to each other as they shook hands, as if there were at a wedding ceremony.</p>

    <p>This was just common courtesy, but it changed Yu Yue's impression of the rumored Zhuo Yi. Gripping Zhuo Yi's hands tightly, he said resolutely, "Whatever Director Zhuo needs from us, don't hesitate to let us know!"</p>

    <p>"Very well!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi nodded solemnly, and then made his request in neither a hurried nor a slow manner.</p>

    <p>"First of all, this is a secret mission from Secretary Dakang, so before we obtain any results from the investigation, we must ensure that the media does not get hold of any information.</p>

    <p>"Second, we need to protect the identities of everyone in the investigation team that's entered the den of this dark force this time... Well, that's all for the moment."</p>

    <p>Chief Yu immediately looked at his subordinate on the side as soon as Zhuo Yi finished speaking. "Did you hear that? Call the tech team immediately and have them contain the media. Turn down all the previous calls that were asking for interviews."</p>

    <p>The little police officer straightened and immediately nodded his head and saluted. "Yes, Chief!"</p>

    <p>After that, Zhuo Yi stared at the broken spatial wall not too far away and heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, he had arrived in time to keep the situation under control, otherwise if just one media outlet caught wind of this, things would have become a lot trickier.</p>

    <p>Zhao Kai parked the car and followed behind Zhuo Yi. There was something he was curious about, so he asked Zhuo Yi in a very low voice, "<em>Shifu </em>... when did Secretary Dakang approve this?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi had nothing to hide from his own man, so he directly opened his mouth and replied, "Well... to be exact, it was probably just now."</p>

    <p>Zhao Kai was stunned. "Just now?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, I texted Secretary Dakang on my way here ten minutes ago," Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>Zhao Kai was stupefied. "..."</p>

    <p>He had never thought that Zhuo Yi and Secretary Dakang would already be on such familiar terms, to the extent that the latter would immediately approve Zhuo Yi's text message.</p>

    <p>Ignoring Zhao Kai's flabbergasted expression, Zhuo Yi looked at the time and said, "I sent <em>shifu </em>a text message previously, and he replied with an ellipsis."</p>

    <p>"What does that mean?"</p>

    <p>"You'll know once you start coming into more contact with him. You'll have to learn how to understand the different types of meaning from his ellipses."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"I reckon they're going to be done soon. Now I'm giving you a task. Go and welcome them later."</p>

    <p>"What do I have to do?" Zhao Kai was suddenly a little nervous.</p>

    <p>"I'll drive later on. Go get a national red flag with its five stars from Chief Yu Yue and wrap it around your arm. Then get on the top of the car and have two people support you. As soon as they come out, we'll drive over..."</p>

    <p>Zhao Kai: "..."</p>
