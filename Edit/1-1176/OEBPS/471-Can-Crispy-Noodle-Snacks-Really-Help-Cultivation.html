  <h1>Chapter 471 Can Crispy Noodle Snacks Really Help Cultivation? </h1>

  <div>

    <p>The money wasn't Xiao Yin's, so he didn't feel distressed about spending it.</p>

    <p>He actually still didn't have any concept of money in human society, but he felt that a mere two thousand HNY was probably just pocket change. If he could use this small change in return for information on Master, Xiao Yin felt that it was more than worth it - in reality, he didn't know that for a sixteen-year-old high school student who usually scrimped and saved to buy snacks and whose father always docked his pocket money for various reasons, this amount was a huge sum of money for his master.</p>

    <p>Er Ha looked at the money in its e-wallet. Including the amount it had swindled from Xiao Yin the last time and minus the amount it had gifted to Daoist Guang previously, it had close to ten thousand HNY now.</p>

    <p>"By the way, how much does Senior Immortal give you?" Er Ha was very curious.</p>

    <p>"He gave me an e-wallet tied to another account of his and said I could use the money as I like." Xiao Yin took a screenshot and sent it to Er Ha.</p>

    <p>Er Ha was instantly stupefied.</p>

    <p>It started with "1" and was followed by six digits...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin had found a tyrannical CEO sugar daddy from the start!</p>

    <p>While it was true that cultivators were rich, not all of them were that wealthy. Except for second generation rich kids like Lin Xiaocong, people at Wang Ling's age who entered Foundation Establishment high schools usually had a proper attitude toward money which their parents had instilled in them from a young age.</p>

    <p>Learning how to manage money was very important. If you had an established and proper view of money from childhood, you would know that making money wasn't easy. Thus, while Wang Ling usually seemed stingy, he couldn't be completely blamed for this.</p>

    <p>In Er Ha's eyes, this was a lot better than those children from wealthy families who squandered their parents' money.</p>

    <p>But to be honest, the money in Xiao Yin's e-wallet was mere pocket change for Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>Er Ha remembered that the high-tech smart computer for the elderly which they had bought for Daoist Guang back then had cost hundreds of thousands of yuan, and had been close to a million yuan in price. But Lord Diulei had bought it without batting an eye.</p>

    <p>It was clear that he didn't lack money.</p>

    <p>The cultivation forum he ran was thriving as every day there would be people revealing gossip about the cultivation world which would directly attract heavy site traffic - in the current era of cultivation, the online economy was also an important part of development, and site traffic meant advertising.</p>

    <p>Over the years, Lord Diulei had made a fortune just by collecting advertising fees for cultivation dating apps and various magic treasure shops, not to mention the fact that he would once in a while still adopt his "Great Death-Courting Senior" persona and take on various chivalrous assignments.</p>

    <p>Now that Lord Diulei had a ring which could resurrect him infinitely, Er Ha felt that the man could now act even more recklessly...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin stretched out one hand and took out a wooden comb to sort out his messy silver hair when he sent a voice message. "Remember to speak to Master for me! Don't forget!"</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, you can absolutely rely on me!" replied Er Ha. "I'll go and study the Basic Dog Skills you sent me later. The first and second forms are level four, so I can still learn those."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin didn't expect Er Ha to be so diligent, and he couldn't help tsking. But at the same time, he thought of another issue and couldn't help asking, "By the way, what do you want the money for? Thunder gives me so much money, but I don't know how to use it..."</p>

    <p>"What else, for fun," Er Ha answered frankly.</p>

    <p>For... fun?</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "What do you mean??"</p>

    <p>Er Ha knew that Xiao Yin didn't understand what this "fun" meant, but it was lazy to explain it. It felt that holy beasts really actually didn't have any interests - as perhaps the only holy beast left in the world who had survived by laying low for eight thousand years, Xiao Yin had only just come into contact with human society and had utterly no idea how beautiful it could be.</p>

    <p>People who died without spending their money, people who lived without money, and people who lived without knowing how to spend money - these three situations were quite unbearable to Er Ha.</p>

    <p>Er Ha said, "You have to look for fun yourself; don't just stay at home the whole day."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "I have my phone when I'm at home, but it's quite boring playing with it now."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "If you're bored, you can use the crispy noodle snacks Little Master Ling gave you and cultivate. Don't waste your time."</p>

    <p>"What did you say?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was astonished, a thunderstruck expression on his face. "Can this thing really help cultivation?!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha's reply to this was a single sentence: "Don't recklessly waste God's good gifts."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "...I'll try it later!"</p>

    <p>"Mm."</p>

    <p>Er Ha nodded. As a senior who had been part of human society for longer, Er Ha couldn't help earnestly giving a piece of advice before it went offline: "The outside world is rich and colorful, so go out and take a walk if you want to learn as much as possible... speaking of which, have you been anywhere else apart from Senior Immortal's villa and our little master's house?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin thought for a bit. "The neighborhood around the villa..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Where else?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "The police station! I even know a police officer!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha sent an emoji of fists cupped in salute. "Goodbye!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Before Xiao Yin finished speaking, he realized that Er Ha's profile picture had already turned gray.</p>

    <p>For the time being, it should probably go cultivate.</p>

    <p>Then he had to work hard! If Er Ha hadn't called attention to it, Xiao Yin would never have thought that a cheap snack like crispy noodle snacks could actually be used in cultivation. But when all was said and done, he had gotten these twenty packets of crispy noodle snacks from Master, so they should indeed be useful!</p>

    <p>No wonder Lord Diulei had worn such a hungry expression back then over one crispy noodle snack packet...</p>

    <p>Now that Xiao Yin looked back on it carefully, it didn't seem ridiculous.</p>

    <p>But when it came to cultivation...</p>

    <p>It felt like there was something he had wanted to tell Er Ha earlier, but just as he had been about to say it, Er Ha had interrupted him and he forgot... What on earth had he wanted to say? It seemed to have been something to do with the side effects of cultivating the "Basic Dog Skills." Cultivating these skills required some knack for it and couldn't rely on just following them on the surface.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin might have copied them, but when he had studied this spirit technique collection in more depth, he had discovered some gaps, and had made some improvements in the process of learning it.</p>

    <p>So this collection of Dog Skills wasn't a problem for Xiao Yin... But if Er Ha made one wrong move, it would be a little troublesome.</p>

    <p>However, Xiao Yin couldn't remember what on earth the side effects were â€” this was what he had wanted to talk about earlier!</p>

    <p>About the side effects of cultivating the "Basic Dog Skills"...</p>

    <p>Folding his arms, Xiao Yin stared at the screen and thought hard for a moment.</p>

    <p>After three seconds...</p>

    <p>He gave up!</p>

    <p>Anyway, this level four spirit technique couldn't be learned so quickly within a short period of time. Xiao Yin felt that there was still time for him to wait until he remembered what the side effects were before sending another message...</p>
