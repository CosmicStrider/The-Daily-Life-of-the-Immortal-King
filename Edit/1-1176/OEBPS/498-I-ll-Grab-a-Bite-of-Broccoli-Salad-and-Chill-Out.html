  <h1>Chapter 498 I'll Grab a Bite of Broccoli Salad and Chill Out... </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Actually, whatever Lord Diulei was thinking of, Wang Ling had naturally already considered it.</p>

    <p>It was just that he couldn't be absolutely sure...</p>

    <p>Playing the same game as his spirit beast was already a very magical experience; adding a player whom he suspected was his father into the mix instantly gave Wang Ling an indescribable feeling.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei and Wang Ling were lying on the roof of the military base in the breeze, bored to death. On their left was " <em>youtiao </em>" and on their right was building C, which happened to be set at an angle. In their prone positions, they were surrounded by walls, and the angle was very tricky; unless people rushed into the building, they couldn't be detected, not even if the players stood on " <em>youtiao </em>."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei's heart was close to crumbling.</p>

    <p>The only difference between this utter lack of gameplay and turning into a box as soon as you landed was that they were fully equipped with supplies and heal items but couldn't exhibit their use at all...</p>

    <p>So, their current state was... two human boxes?</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei thought this was an apt comparison.</p>

    <p>He realized that as long as he was with Wang Ling, there wouldn't be such a thing as a god-cursed circle, not in his entire life.</p>

    <p>When other people played games, whether or not they could encounter the god-blessed circle depended on luck. When Wang Ling played games, whether or not he could encounter the god-blessed circle depended on Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Where Wang Ling was, so was the safe zone...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei had thought at first that playing the game with Wang Ling would be a very exciting experience.</p>

    <p>It was a real pity that their first time was worse than he had imagined...</p>

    <p>A lifeless Lord Diulei took off his headphones and stood up.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "Thunder, you're not playing anymore?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei said woodenly, "I'm going to go grab a bite of broccoli salad to chill out..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "But... you're in the middle of a game."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei smiled slightly. "It's fine - with Brother Ling around, I can win even if I use my feet to play."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It truly wasn't a great gaming experience. Since he seldom played, Wang Ling had actually really wanted to perform. However, because of the Great Fortune Spell, there was no way that he could perform today. Actually, the most critical point was that once the Great Fortune Spell was activated, the biggest headache about it was that it couldn't simply be canceled.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling knew that Lord Diulei was having a terrible gaming experience; not everyone had the nature to be kings at laying low.</p>

    <p>At that time, he saw that the system's third circle contraction was already over. When he opened the map for a look... Sure enough, they were still in the middle of the safe zone.</p>

    <p>When Lord Diulei went to get his broccoli salad, Wang Ling suddenly thought of a way to possibly verify whether or not this number one fan "Brother Sleep" was Father Wang.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling had gone out today, he knew that Lie Mengmeng and Father Wang had been in the study. There would be several days each month when Father Wang would go crazy over the novel, and Lie Mengmeng would specially drop by to urge Father Wang to speed up his updates.</p>

    <p>The book <em>The Live Streaming Life of the Immortal King </em>was now on track, and Father Wang generally wasn't in the habit of amassing drafts; all the draft chapters that he had stored up before the book's release had already been used up in the first month after its debut for the sake of securing monthly votes <sup>1</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(According to Qidian's system, VIP readers can support their favorite novels with monthly votes, thus boosting the book's profile ..)</dfn>

    <p>Plus, this water friends match which Daoist Guang had organized had been going on since the morning... Wang Ling remembered that Brother Sleep, this "number one fan," had been very active in the live stream room as he promoted the event and also engaged in lively chitchat.</p>

    <p>That was to say, if Lie Mengmeng had personally dropped by to press for updates but Father Wang still hadn't updated his novel today, then there was definitely something wrong.</p>

    <p>Curious, Wang Ling opened the novel software app to take a casual look.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, it was exactly as he had thought â€” there weren't any chapter updates for Father Wang's novel today!</p>

    <p>Hm... solid proof!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at the book review section for Father Wang's novel. Because it hadn't been updated all morning, the "demand more" party had already built high-rises in the review section.</p>

    <p>Should he send a book review?</p>

    <p>Suddenly, Wang Ling felt like being cheeky.</p>

    <p>About ten seconds later, Wang Ling's book review was finished: <em>Shocked! Some novel writer is ignoring his job to play a game with Lord Island, the famous rookie live streamer!</em></p>

    <p>It was a very short sentence and Wang Ling didn't even put down Father Wang's game ID.</p>

    <p>But he believed the review would definitely have an explosive effect.</p>

    <p>After all, no one knew how scary it was to have a bunch of readers clamoring incessantly for an author to dress up in women's clothes as compensation...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, in the study at the Wang family's small villa, Father Wang and Daoist Guang were coordinating very well together. They had killed five men in total, Daoist Guang three and Father Wang two... Father Wang actually didn't think he had a talent for games at all, but there were times when he just wanted to play.</p>

    <p>Earlier, Father Wang had sent Daoist Guang a private message explaining that he was the one who had invited the anti-cheat punishment expert over. Of course, Father Wang didn't say who it was exactly, just that it was a friend.</p>

    <p>Sometimes the word "friend" was really an explanation for everything.</p>

    <p>If there was something that you couldn't explain clearly, the right way to do it was to push it onto your "friend"!</p>

    <p>At that moment, Father Wang's cell phone on the table vibrated. Seeing that Wang Ming had sent him a voice message, Father Wang quickly turned off the microphone connection to Daoist Guang. He and Lord Island were in one team and acting in concert; if he didn't turn off the microphone, his private conversation with Wang Ming would be recorded.</p>

    <p>"Uncle, can I ask you something? Is Ling Ling at home today?"</p>

    <p>"Ling Ling? He's at home. He's been busy recently revising for the midterm exams," Father Wang quickly replied.</p>

    <p>"At home. All right, I see." Wang Ming's lips curled as he laughed since he already had an answer in his mind.</p>

    <p>Father Wang felt that Wang Ming's laugh sounded strange, so he couldn't help warning him, "Don't you dare take your little brother out to play games; you already graduated by the time you were his age, but he's not as smart as you - he can't keep his grades down in the average range like I told him to!"</p>

    <p>Keep... keep his grades down... erm...</p>

    <p>Wang Ming opened his mouth, but in the end didn't have the courage to refute Father Wang.</p>

    <p>What he actually wanted to say was that sometimes, those who could play at keeping their grades down were the real big shots...</p>

    <p>After the third circle contraction, the number of people had gone down to sixty again.</p>

    <p>This was in fact quite a normal figure, but Father Wang looked at the kill notifications on the public screen and noticed that a person with the ID "WF" had used a 98K to kill three people with a headshot in succession.</p>

    <p>"Little Ming, can you check whether this WF is using cheats?" Father Wang said.</p>

    <p>Five seconds later, Wang Ming's message came through. "No, this person isn't a cheater, but an expert. He has very precise marksmanship, and has currently killed seven people, all with headshots."</p>

    <p>"So amazing?" Father Wang tsked. Sure enough, there were still experts around in this game!</p>

    <p>"Do you need me to get rid of this person?" Wang Ming smiled.</p>

    <p>"Don't! Since he isn't cheating, it's fine. Although uncle is bad at this, I still have integrity!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming facepalmed. "Uncle... if you have integrity, you should be typing now..."</p>

    <p>"..." Hearing this, Father Wang was actually unable to respond.</p>

    <p>Behind Father Wang, Lie Mengmeng nodded his head frantically like a chicken pecking at rice.</p>
