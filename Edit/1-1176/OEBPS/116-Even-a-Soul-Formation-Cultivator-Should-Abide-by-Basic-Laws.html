  <h1>Chapter 116 Even a Soul Formation Cultivator Should Abide by Basic Laws </h1>

  <div>

    <p>The Killer Gaze was a trick which Wang Ling commonly used. If Er Ha had been here, as a being that had experienced it before... it would definitely have sympathized deeply with this fighting lion.</p>

    <p>When Lord Diulei saw the fighting lion become as obedient as a cat, he also couldn't help showing an amazed expression. In his heart, he once again marveled at how mystical this Brother Ling was.</p>

    <p>He remembered when he had asked Wang Ling to come along to hunt down the demons that had escaped from the Gate Between Worlds to earth; almost each time it had been like this — with just one look from Wang Ling, those demons had been knocked down.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was sure that it definitely wasn't a technique or forceful spiritual pressure; it was just a single look.</p>

    <p>In the absence of any cultivation techniques, to what extent could one rely purely on pressure from a single look?</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei felt that this was something Wang Ling had been able to grasp perfectly.</p>

    <p>True, temperament was one factor. If the realms were equal, the one who had more powerful life and spiritual essence could evoke deeper fear — but this was also an indication of how unfathomable Wang Ling's true prowess was.</p>

    <p>Of course, Lord Diulei didn't know that the person in front of him now was actually only Wang Ling's clone.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that if Lord Diulei knew the truth, this Great Death-Courting Senior would definitely start crying on the spot.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When the demon rampage had happened six years ago, apart from Zhuo Yi and some others who had been awarded for their deeds, there had in fact been some powerful cultivators who had been hired by the government to take charge of the aftermath and tidy up the mess.</p>

    <p>There weren't many Soul Formation mercenaries in the world, and in Huaxiu nation's cultivation circle, the Ten Saints were the most renowned.</p>

    <p>The Ten Saints was a group of ten mercenaries, all of whom were at the Soul Formation stage.</p>

    <p>The Ten Saints had two distinctive characteristics. Firstly, they were not only strong, but also very savage! Since their establishment, all the assignments which they had accepted had been large-scale operations, and they had a habit of eliminating their opponents and leaving none alive... people in this line of business looking to employ the Ten Saints had come up with a distinctive saying —"Where the Ten Saints go, no grass grows!"</p>

    <p>The second characteristic was their love of money. The Ten Saints were actually rare in that they were Soul Formation cultivators who could be bought with money... but the clients who could afford to hire them were also just as rare. This was because every one of the Ten Saints was crazy expensive. So for the Ten Saints, there was no such thing as true righteousness; they could be employed by the government to clean up a mess, but they could also be hired to commit misdeeds. For them, money was righteousness — as long as they were paid enough, they could call you "father" if you wanted!</p>

    <p>Thus, when Director Song Qingshu found out that the people he would have command over were the Ten Saints, the shock in his heart reached its maximum limit.</p>

    <p>For the first time, he felt that he had underestimated the Lord's might...</p>

    <p>To hire ten people at one go would require an ungodly sum of money — even the largest pharmaceutical group in Huaxiu nation, Huaguo Water Curtain Group, would have to think twice. But the Lord this time had actually secured the right to use these ten people for three years... what kind of priceless treasure had he traded for them? It was hard for Song Qingshu to imagine with just his limited experience.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At a little past four o'clock in the afternoon, Lord Diulei was about to start off from the villa.</p>

    <p>He tended to speed unconsciously when he flew on his immortal sword, and was done to two points on his sword-flying license after numerous demerits. The points would reset to twelve again in June, so in the meantime, he was going to take the spirit bus to Wang Ling's school. The journey would take about an hour and he would reach the school just before the start of the parent-teacher conference.</p>

    <p>As a citizen of Huaxiu nation, even a Soul Formation cultivator should abide by basic laws.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei's rule for conducting himself in society had always been to be a good citizen.</p>

    <p>After all, the times were different now.</p>

    <p>In the past, as long as your realm was strong enough, you were allowed to do whatever you wanted in heaven and earth <sup>1</sup> . Take the oldest and most common example of an auction — previously, even if something had been properly purchased with money, there was still the risk that the new owner could be killed for it anytime. But now, there was the cultivation police as well as a formal legal system... the era where realms were everything was already over.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is a reference to the title
of a xuanhua novel,
天地任我行, which translates to
"I am allowed to do anything
in heaven and earth.")</dfn>

    <p>You might have prowess and realm, but if you broke the law, you would still be imprisoned and wind up picking up soap <sup>2</sup> with your brothers.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(In Chinese, "picking up soap"
is used to imply anal sex, i.e.
in a communal shower, when
a man bends down to pick up
a soap bar that has fallen to
the floor, he's basically
exposing himself to be
sexually taken advantage of.)</dfn>

    <p>Everyone knew that Lord Diulei was very fond of seeking death; he had already considered himself the Great Death-Courting Senior for years. However, there were some bottom lines he would never cross.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, I'm leaving the rest to you!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei spoke with Wang Ling at the front door of the villa as he prepared to leave.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling crossed his arms and leaned against the door with a solemn expression. Next to him, the fighting lion crouched down in a show of obedience.</p>

    <p>After Wang Ling had tamed it with one look, the lion's previously unapproachable attitude had changed, and it now twisted its body to lick its mane, and lick its anus...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was speechless... this guy had already completely become a cat in front of Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, you've felt it too, right?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei asked as he stood by the door and looked at Wang Ling's solemn expression.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded without hesitation.</p>

    <p>He was well aware that there was more than one person watching them.</p>

    <p>"Looks like my misgivings weren't unreasonable; I knew that bunch wouldn't give up so easily!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling frowned.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "But Brother Ling is here. I'm sure you can handle it, right?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling frowned again.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Brother Ling, don't frown like that, it makes me very nervous!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>There were a lot of things that could make Wang Ling frown, such as exam results that were too good, Father Wang deducting his pocket money, limited edition crispy noodle snacks selling out...</p>

    <p>Of course, fear wasn't one of them.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had to admit that the guys outside had very formidable auras; they were completely unlike that bunch of Shadow Stream killers that he had dealt with previously, so he didn't know whether it would be easy to beat them or not.</p>

    <p>He hadn't needed to make a move against that Shadow Stream bunch before they had been killed by backlash. Looking at the overall strength of the group outside, Wang Ling felt that these people could probably endure two or three of his punches...</p>

    <p>The reason why Wang Ling frowned was that he felt that the other party had a little too many people, which made him super annoyed.</p>

    <p>After all, tonight was the premiere of the latest large-scale, anti-corruption cultivation TV series <em>In the Name of Cultivation </em><sup>3 </sup>, and Wang Ling didn't want to miss it! Because during the series premiere, major sponsor Small Raccoon was going to randomly select three hundred TV audience members to receive a large gift hamper of thirty years' worth of free crispy noodle snacks...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>('In the Name of Cultivation' is
a spin on the 2017 Chinese TV
drama series 'In the Name of
the People .. ')</dfn>

    <p>If he was held up because of that bunch of people outside, Wang Ling was going to spill blood!</p>
