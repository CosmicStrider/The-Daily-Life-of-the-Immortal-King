  <h1>Chapter 1125 Sun Rong's Sword Spirit Space</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Conditions permitting, making fair use of the loophole in the rules was also a shortcut in battle toward placing in the competition ranking this time. Headmaster Chen knew his old acquaintances all too well. His heart was as clear as a mirror; he knew that they would never let go of this opportunity.</p>

    <p>It was very likely that Li Qingxi, headmaster of Number 1 Devil-Subduing High, and Zuo Qingxiu, headmaster of Balance Flame Middle School, were both making plans at the moment.</p>

    <p>Of all the headmasters this time, Headmaster Chen felt that his biggest foes were these two guys.</p>

    <p>He might have defeated the both of them before, and they might not seem fearsome, but if they weren't capable, they wouldn't be able to hold up these two key city high schools.</p>

    <p>Number 1 Devil-Subduing High was good at control spells, and the students of Balance Flame Middle School were very good at learning through experience. If the two schools worked together, they might be a formidable combination.</p>

    <p>Devil-Subduing High was good at control spells, and could control both people and objects. They could use control spells to confuse the instruments used during the entry inspections so that they produced errors - Headmaster Chen could imagine this happening.</p>

    <p>Given Li Qingxi's character, he would definitely get the students to do that. In this eight-day battle for survival, even bringing a single fasting pill inside would significantly improve their odds.</p>

    <p>Compared with Li Qingxi's side, the students of Balance Flame Middle School were more conservative; this was a group of bookworms who emphasized rules and stubbornly clung to their principles; it would be absolutely unthinkable to them to take advantage of the loophole.</p>

    <p>Headmaster Zuo would want to persuade his students to bring some things in, but he would be faced with the problem of his students' unwillingness to break the rules. As headmaster, he couldn't force them to do what he wanted.</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen's guess was that this Headmaster Zuo would probably choose one or two of the students and use some of his tricks to deceive them into bringing things in...</p>

    <p>After these Balance Flame Middle School bookworms brought these things inside, they would have to use these extra aids once they encountered difficulties.</p>

    <p>Mankind could never escape "scientific truth."</p>

    <p>Hence, Headmaster Chen's plan for dealing with Balance Flame Middle School was very simple.</p>

    <p>After hearing Headmaster Chen's plan, Guo Hao's lips twitched. "To report them... Is that really alright? Isn't it a little too shameless..."</p>

    <p>"It's nothing more than a fair method of competition," Headmaster Chen said.</p>

    <p>Balance Flame Middle School was a school that would become harder to deal with in the later stage. They absolutely couldn't be allowed to survive in this battle, so they had to be disposed of as soon as possible in the early stage. It would be good news for all schools if Balance Flame Middle School was down some members right from the start.</p>

    <p>As for how Number 60 High would bring magic treasures in, Headmaster Chen had already thought up of a plan: They might be able to use Sun Rong's spirit sword Mysterious Sea to achieve this.</p>

    <p>Everyone knew that Sun Rong's spirit sword already had a sword spirit. As long as she used this sword spirit attribute and placed the magic treasures inside a sword spirit space, no equipment would be able to detect them.</p>

    <p>Spirit swords also weren't allowed in the national body technique competition this time, but when a sword spirit and its master shared a close enough rapport, a sword spirit space could be opened up remotely.</p>

    <p>"Mysterious Sea has been with Student Sun Rong since she was born. There probably isn't anyone here who has as high a rapport as Student Sun Rong does with her sword, so we'll have to trouble Student Sun Rong this time."</p>

    <p>"Okay, headmaster!" Sun Rong agreed readily.</p>

    <p>The truth was that even if Headmaster Chen hadn't said anything, Sun Rong had already figured out this method; as a refined young lady, not only did she have to bring magic treasures, she also had to bring many daily necessities.</p>

    <p>Everyone would definitely become unkempt while participating in this eight-day battle for survival, but Sun Rong didn't want that to happen to her. This was a national competition, and she would inevitably be photographed, so she would need to pay particular attention to her image, or it might tarnish the reputation of her family's Huaguo Water Curtain Group. Hence, she had to bring talismans for "cleaning" as well as makeup for girls.</p>

    <p>Conditions permitting, it would be best if she could wash her hair once a day.</p>

    <p>After class, everyone started to discuss what they should bring in with them.</p>

    <p>Li Youyue asked, "Will we really not be found out?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong nodded and beamed. "We won't be discovered. It's very difficult to create a sword spirit space, and it was only by luck that I was able to refine one. Generally, very few Foundation Establishment students can open up a sword spirit space, so there won't be checks carried out specially for a sword spirit space since the procedure involved is too complicated; if over a thousand students are checked for this space, who knows how long the inspections will take."</p>

    <p>Li Youyue sighed with relief. "That's great. I was still wondering what I should do if I got all dirty during the eight days... Can you help me bring in some makeup and toiletries?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "I'll prepare a few more; you can just use mine."</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi also echoed Li Youyue. "Me too!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong nodded smoothly. "No problem."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "But what if..."</p>

    <p>"You shut up!" The three girls shouted at the same time and stopped Chen Chao from speaking.</p>

    <p>The power of his blessed mouth really couldn't be underestimated.</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi actually had her own means of bringing things in, but the problem was that she didn't have any money right now! The money she earned from working at Wei Zhi's place was only enough for her to buy some cheap cosmetics. Her life was too hard... It would be good if she could save money and freeload off someone else.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling realized that when it came to a battle for survival, girls were unusually alike in their thinking: Their first concern wasn't whether they could survive, but for their appearance - this was just too real!</p>

    <p>Seeing this, Guo Hao couldn't help but sigh. "This is a battle for survival, can you be a little more serious?"</p>

    <p>"Is there anything else more important to a girl than being beautiful and clean?" Li Youyue smiled. She looked at Sun Rong and said, "Oh, by the way, Rongrong, I also have a set of kitchenware here; take it in for me later. Nine Dragon Mountain has plenty of local specialties; if we can get good ingredients, I can prepare a picnic for everyone."</p>

    <p>"Kitchenware? No problem. There's plenty of room in my sword spirit space. There's enough space for about two truckloads of stuff." Sun Rong nodded agreeably.</p>

    <p>"Then, can you help me bring in a game console?" Guo Hao asked.</p>

    <p>"You're the one acting as if you're going on holiday..."</p>

    <p>"Hey, I was planning to hole up at home next week and play Death Stranding - who the hell knew I would be sent out for a competition!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, I'll only play when it's perfectly safe. I'll do anything as long as you let me bring it."</p>

    <p>Where's your integrity...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was speechless. She then turned to everyone else. "Is there anything else you want me to bring? I still have plenty of space."</p>

    <p>Saying this, she turned to look at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "Classmate Wang Ling, do you want crispy noodle snacks?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
