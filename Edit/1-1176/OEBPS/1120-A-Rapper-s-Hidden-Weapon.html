  <h1>Chapter 1120 A Rapper's Hidden Weapon!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Seeing Liu Qingyi's powerful kick, Wang Ling, Gu Shunzhi, Wang Zhen and Zhenyuan all felt cold in the lower halves of their bodies. Since Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi had descended to the world below without permission, they were still being punished by Heavenly Dao, and to stop Mother Wang from embarrassing him back then, Wang Ling arranged to have Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi stay at Wei Zhi's place.</p>

    <p>Although their personalities seemed to clash, Wang Ling thought that they were actually very compatible with each other. He had originally intended to help them get to know each other better and develop feelings in passing; he never thought that they would have communication problems instead.</p>

    <p>It was said that absence made the heart grow fonder...</p>

    <p>It turned out that these words weren't a lie.</p>

    <p>As expected, when it came to feelings, was it still better to let nature take its course?</p>

    <p>An unripe melon wouldn't taste sweet!</p>

    <p>Seeing how fierce Liu Qingyi's kick was, Wang Zhen couldn't help trembling, and inadvertently covered his jewels.</p>

    <p>He recalled how he was kicked the morning before because he had accidentally used her toothbrush.</p>

    <p>He also recalled how he casually drank a mouthful of the bottled drink on the table in the living room two days ago. He thought it was Wei Zhi's, but it turned out to be Liu Qingyi's drink, and he was kicked yet again...</p>

    <p>He still remembered how he just casually criticized some young newbie stars on their poor acting skills three days ago, after Liu Qingyi had started to stan Earth celebs, and he was kicked for it...</p>

    <p>He already couldn't remember how many times he had been kicked in just a few weeks.</p>

    <p>In any case, this was the reality: the power of Liu Qingyi's kicks had increased, and Wang Zhen was almost done cultivating his iron crotch technique.</p>

    <p>"It's so hard!" Whenever Wang Zhen thought about it, he couldn't help feeling aggrieved, and he even teared up.</p>

    <p>As a man, he thought it was beneath his dignity to bicker with Liu Qingyi. Furthermore, he realized that he treated her with natural patience; whatever unreasonable thing she did to him, he actually didn't get angry.</p>

    <p>Of course, he absolutely didn't believe that he already had feelings for this violent woman. His parents had beat him since he was young, so his train of thought was different — he felt that it was probably because he had grown up under an iron fist that he had developed an immunity to violent behavior.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling clearly heard Wang Zhen's thoughts.</p>

    <p>It could only be said that Wang Zhen was a man with formidable mental fortitude... He had endured violence since young, yet was still able to grow up so well — the most miraculous thing was how he didn't become especially twisted or reclusive! What normal person could do that?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling himself was strongly opposed to violent behavior, whether at home or at school.</p>

    <p>The silent treatment was the most common and most easily overlooked type of abuse in school.</p>

    <p>Isolation wasn't good for physical or mental development, but many parents obviously didn't treat it seriously.</p>

    <p>It was possible that in every school, or even every class, there was a student who was an outcast — this was the scariest thing.</p>

    <p>Perhaps every person had "bullied" some outcast classmate when they were young and ignorant, and perhaps every person owed that classmate an apology. As time passed, this old wound was doomed to not heal, and couldn't be wrapped up with bandages; the only thing everyone could do now was start with the people around them: Tell your friends, relatives, and even your future kids, to treat the people around you with a little more kindness as much as possible.</p>

    <p>Actually, Wang Ling himself still preferred to be shunned...</p>

    <p>It would at the very least save him some headache.</p>

    <p>But since young, it seemed that everyone's gazes never strayed far from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>When he was young, his control had been unsteady, and there were times he would overperform, which landed him in awkward predicaments.</p>

    <p>By the time Wang Ling collected his thoughts again, he had already reached the second checkpoint which San Yuan had set up. The boss at the second checkpoint was a tall young man wearing mink fur. He had very unique dreadlocks and wore a pair of sunglasses. Coupled with the large gold chain around his neck and his jerky swaying, it was clear that this was a rapper.</p>

    <p>Rap was one type of musical genre, but Wang Ling didn't have a smooth tongue, and since the beginning, had never had much interest in this sort of impromptu freestyle form. Back when the show <em>Rap of Huaxiu</em> was popular, his classmates and friends around him would discuss those rappers who drew large audiences by improvising lyrics to diss other people and life, which won them popularity for a time.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling alone had little interest.</p>

    <p>He gazed at this rapper in a mink coat in front of him, and for the time being, gave him the name Brother Mink.</p>

    <p>Given that Brother Mink was a rapper, Wang Ling's first thought was that the other party might attack with a sound wave spell combined with a physical technique. Unlike the stereotypical impression many people had about sound wave spells, they didn't need to be yelled out.</p>

    <p>In fact, many advanced sound wave spells were practically noiseless; there was no need to yell them out — a soft murmur could be just as lethal.</p>

    <p>When advanced sound wave spells were sung in a low voice, they could have a hallucinatory effect on the other party, and if you seized that moment and used a physical technique, you could deal your muddle-headed opponent a heavy blow! Hit the vital parts, and before most people could react in time, they would have already fallen to the ground.</p>

    <p>Hence, the key to clearing this checkpoint should be to use the acupuncture seals, which they mastered in high school, to seal their own ears so that the opponent's sound wave spell wouldn't affect them.</p>

    <p>But what happened next made Wang Ling feel that in the end, he was still too young.</p>

    <p>When Brother Mink saw Wang Ling thinking about how to respond, he abruptly took action. Wang Ling did what he felt was right, and that was to seal his ears so that the sound wave spell wouldn't mess with his mind.</p>

    <p>Actually, even if he didn't seal his ears, the sound wave spell wouldn't affect him much, but he had to pretend...</p>

    <p>He had to pretend for San Yuan's benefit.</p>

    <p>But just as Wang Ling was thinking that his acting was pretty good, several concealed weapons suddenly flew out of the sleeves of this Brother Mink in front of him!</p>

    <p>"???"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's heart trembled.</p>

    <p>Hidden weapons weren't a big deal. It was common to use hidden weapons in line with a physical attack to change up the attack pattern. The accompanying use of hidden weapons wasn't rare.</p>

    <p>So it wasn't as if Wang Ling didn't understand this Brother Mink's behavior.</p>

    <p>The issue was that Wang Ling was still staring dumbly at the hidden weapons that were flying at him.</p>

    <p>Because these hidden weapons... were dumpling skins.</p>
