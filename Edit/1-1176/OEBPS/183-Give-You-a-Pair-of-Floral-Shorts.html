  <h1>Chapter 183 Give You a Pair of Floral Shorts </h1>

  <div>

    <p>"If you agree to work with me, you can request something of me. My venerable self can satisfy whatever you desire..." The voice of the stone ghost mask sounded from within the black smoke.</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue furrowed her brow. Although she had said that she trusted Devil Emperor Gua Pi, she was still doubtful about this so-called "cooperation." Who the hell knew, after being sealed away for over one thousand years in the mask, maybe this Devil Emperor Gua Pi had become a pervert?</p>

    <p>Right now, Jiang Liuyue had no other option but to choose to trust him. Moreover, she could use this opportunity to investigate the truth about this Devil Emperor for herself.</p>

    <p>After all, this was the notorious monster who had shaken the world back then; it had taken all of Huaxiu nation's power to destroy him.</p>

    <p>"Any condition is fine?" Jiang Liuyue asked softly after staring fixedly at the black smoke for a few seconds.</p>

    <p>"Of course." Devil Emperor Gua Pi laughed. "There is nothing that my venerable self can't do."</p>

    <p>"Then can you help me recover my former realm? Someone destroyed my spirit clay clone, which directly caused me to lose six hundred years of my cultivation..." Jiang Liuyue's eyes turned dark.</p>

    <p>"As long as your cultivation wasn't lost due to internal factors, you can regain your realm; for those who lose their cultivation through internal deviation, even my venerable self can do nothing for them. Since your condition was caused by an external factor, I have a way to help you recover. However, it will take time — to obtain six hundred years of cultivation once more, it will take at least a year."</p>

    <p>"A year?" Jiang Liuyue jolted. Cramming six hundred years into one would massively cut down the time needed for her to recover her cultivation realm!</p>

    <p>"This recovery technique doesn't require you to go into seclusion; you can cultivate anytime you want. My venerable self will now pass it on to you. You can try it out for a month to test my words. After that, you can tell me your second condition." Jiang Liuyue heard enigmatic laughter from within the black smoke.</p>

    <p>"Lord Devil Emperor might have guessed by now that as I've chosen to cooperate, I can no longer turn back. I'll learn this recovery technique and start cultivating immediately. During this period, I hope Lord Devil Emperor will help me with a second matter... I want revenge!"</p>

    <p>"Of course. In fact, saving time will benefit both of us. But my venerable self is currently confined to the mask and unable to come out, so what is your plan for revenge?" Devil Emperor Gua Pi asked.</p>

    <p>"I just hope that Lord Devil Emperor can help me 'persuade' several people." Jiang Liuyue cupped her fists in a salute toward the black smoke as she spoke slowly. "In the current list of killers, there are some people who have been looking for me. One-Inch Gray ranked seventh, Steamed Bun Invader ranked eighth, Little Cold Hands ranked ninth and Night Rain Kidney Menace ranked tenth..."</p>

    <p>"Hehe, do you want to see them dead by someone else's hands?" In the black smoke, Devil Emperor Gua Pi laughed. "I never expected that the current cultivation world would actually set up a list of killers... but why don't you directly ask those above you in the ranking list for help?"</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue: "Those people don't leave any tracks that can be followed, so I don't know their whereabouts for now. But I can bet that these four people are doing whatever they can to find me. As long as they kill me, they can move up one place in the ranking."</p>

    <p>Devil Emperor Gua Pi: "So that's it... hehe, then, you just need to send out a message; you don't have to take the trouble to find them."</p>

    <p>"Persuade some people and get them to do the work; are you confident you can do this?" Jiang Liuyue asked.</p>

    <p>"They're just a few juniors. Back when I was engaged in 'cheerful conversation' with the ten founding generals of Huaxiu nation, those people were probably still drinking their mothers' milk. You only need to draw them here and leave the rest to me." Devil Emperor Gua Pi laughed coldly.</p>

    <p>"Then I will have to trouble you." Jiang Liuyue cupped her fists in a salute.</p>

    <p>"Why do you need to thank me when this is a mutually beneficial arrangement?" After saying that, the black smoke which surrounded the stone ghost mask suddenly coalesced, and the mask returned to Jiang Liuyue's hand.</p>

    <p>"By the way, who did you want revenge on?"</p>

    <p>"A school."</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue gripped the stone ghost mask tightly. "I want the people in that school dead, every last one of them!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Everyone had learned a lot from the history class today. Lao Gudong's understanding of these top ten killers was far beyond what they could imagine, and they couldn't help but wonder if he had once worked for a national intelligence agency.</p>

    <p>When it came to gossip on Killer Taoist, Lao Gudong had had quite a fair bit of information; he had even talked about Killer Taoist's favorite color of underpants as if it was fact. The students in class had all thought that he was just full of hot air, but as someone who had seen the way Lao Gudong operated for himself, Wang Ling believed that everything the teacher had said was true.</p>

    <p>This was the number one killer on the international ranking list of killers! He was a figure who had once turned the cultivation world upside down... but the way Lao Gudong slandered him with his words just made him sound like a weird old uncle.</p>

    <p>Everybody's initial impression of Killer Taoist was that he was a brutal killer, but in Lao Gudong's mouth, he actually became a killer who upheld justice and punished evildoers. What was more, he had a unique fetish — he liked to wear floral underpants.</p>

    <p>Now, Wang Ling truly didn't understand anything.</p>

    <p>He had once suspected Lao Gudong of being Killer Taoist, but if that was the case, how could anyone be so careless as to reveal their unknown secrets to the rest of the world?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thus was once again lost in a haze of suspicion and doubts when it came to Lao Gudong's identity.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the evening on this day after school, apart from some patrolling night security guards and several teachers who had stayed behind to mark homework and instruct students, an unexpected person had also stayed back today.</p>

    <p>It was already getting dark when Lao Gudong's stout figure waddled up to the top of the school building to stare at the sky.</p>

    <p>At this time, Lao Gudong should already have left school. His schedule always followed a routine, and he was always careful to go to work on time and to clock off on time. He wouldn't waste even one second... but today, it was his first time going up to the roof.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, a black shadow appeared behind him. This black shadow raised a cold blade in its hand like a ray of light and stabbed directly at the back of Lao Gudong's head.</p>

    <p>His lightning speed was too fast to see clearly!</p>

    <p>But Lao Gudong's face was as calm as an old well. He twisted his hand and directly immobilized the point of the knife between his fingers, breaking the blade with a crack.</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong turned around and clapped. "Mm, your accuracy has improved tremendously... however, you're still lacking a little in strength."</p>

    <p>The man standing in the dark heaved a sigh. "Teacher, you're as powerful as ever!"</p>

    <p>Looking at this man, Lao Gudong narrowed his eyes slightly. "I have a bad feeling that something big is going to happen soon."</p>

    <p>"Indeed, the murder industry has been restless lately. A lot of people are looking for the Master of Shadow Stream," replied the man in the dark.</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong's eyes narrowed slightly. "My students may be in danger, so I hope you and your senior brother will keep an eye on those people. If anyone tries to lay a hand on my students, get rid of them as soon as possible."</p>

    <p>"Very well, teacher."</p>

    <p>The man in the dark nodded, but looked a little embarrassed. "But teacher, eldest senior brother could be anywhere, and I'm afraid I might not be able to find him... and even if I do, I'm not sure if he would listen to me."</p>

    <p>After the person said that, spirit light appeared in Lao Gudong's hand, and something was tossed to him.</p>

    <p>The man in the dark was immediately startled. "This is..."</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong: "This is your senior brother's floral underpants. I took them in passing back when he challenged me."</p>

    <p>The man in the dark: "..."</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong: "Hang them up on your clothesline and he'll show up straightaway."</p>

    <p>The man in the dark: "..."</p>
