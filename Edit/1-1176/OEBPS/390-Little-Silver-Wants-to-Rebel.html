  <h1>Chapter 390 Xiao Yin Wants to Rebel! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>The night the Demon Hunters Association was exposed, the news had already spread like wildfire before the media could announce it publicly.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling opened the cultivation forum that night, he found that the number of new posts had already broken the ten thousand mark, and almost all of the discussion was centered around the Demon Hunters Association.</p>

    <p>Some of the posts included images from the scene of pitiful spirit beasts that had been forced to cancel their contracts, lying motionless in their cages, gasping and bloody, and covered in multiple wounds, which was a horrifying sight.</p>

    <p>Some low-grade spirit beasts had been stripped of their fur while still alive to make Taoist robes and boots... The most important point was that almost all of the spirit beasts traded in the Demon Hunters Association turned out to have had owners before.</p>

    <p>No buying and selling of spirit beasts and no killing - who would have thought that the Demon Hunters Association would have the guts to dare continue commit these crimes at a time when the state had prohibited the capture and trafficking of spirit beasts.</p>

    <p>For the cultivators following this incident and those calling for people to live in harmony with spirit beasts, this was a huge blow to them.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, the pressure from public outcry ultimately still fell on the special task force responsible for investigating the Demon Hunters Association as well as its commander, Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>It had to be pointed out that while the Demon Hunters Association had been exposed, those that had been captured were pet traffickers peddling spirit beasts and lesser members of the organization. Not all the core members had been captured, and currently no one even knew who the head of the organization was.</p>

    <p>Of all the core members arrested, Strong Zuo ranked the highest, and according to his confession, he had never seen the face of the head, and only knew that his surname was Bai. Everyone in the organization addressed him as Chairman Bai.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, each time Chairman Bai made an appearance, it was accompanied by rolling fog and steam - it wasn't just his face, but his entire figure also couldn't be seen.</p>

    <p>At the prison, Warden Liang had a special magic treasure which could be used to detect lies. With this verification, it was indeed as Strong Zuo had said, and the identity of the head behind the Demon Hunters Association was a mystery.</p>

    <p>After Er Ha got home that night, it read the various posts online together with Wang Ling, while Zhuo Yi texted Wang Ling some of the results from the interrogation as soon as he obtained them.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling noticed that Er Ha had apparently taken this incident to heart.</p>

    <p>Er Ha had once been a demon king, but after all, a demon king was also a demon beast. In essence, demon beasts and spirit beasts were branches from the same tree - the only difference was in the power medium that they used.</p>

    <p>Hence, when Er Ha looked at these pictures in the forum, it felt extremely moved. It couldn't imagine at all what would happen if one day it was caught and treated like this.</p>

    <p>Of course, with Wang Ling around, there was no way that would happen.</p>

    <p>But Er Ha's attitude toward the Demon Hunters Association was already very clear â€” it would definitely ferret out the mastermind behind the scenes!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stroked Er Ha's head.</p>

    <p>Then, he realized that while going through the posts with him, this guy had actually fallen asleep on the table, just like that!</p>

    <p>Er Ha's narcolepsy had struck again!</p>

    <p>It was a good thing it had happened at home - if it had happened in the fight just now, the consequences would have been simply unimaginable.</p>

    <p>This matter needed to be resolved as soon as possible!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling cupped his chin in his hand as he pondered this. Then he picked up this lump of dog stuck to the table and put it down at his feet.</p>

    <p>After the last time he had called Lord Diulei to look for Xiao Yin to sell him some holy beast blood, Lord Diulei had bought Xiao Yin a cell phone and applied for a new number.</p>

    <p>He had already sent Xiao Yin's cell phone number to Wang Ling previously.</p>

    <p>Hence, Wang Ling directly contacted Xiao Yin this time.</p>

    <p>"When will you send it over?"</p>

    <p>The message was as short as always, with just six words.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was sitting on the sofa in Lord Diulei's house, and when he saw this message, he was so scared he almost dropped the phone. To be honest, the last time he had unsuccessfully bled himself had been pretty painful.</p>

    <p>It wasn't a big deal that he hadn't succeeded, but the point was that he had been treated as a depressed suicidal teenager, arrested by the police for ritualistic behavior, and then sent to the hospital as a mental patient.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin had initially wanted to relax for a few days before trying again... Holy beasts might have a strong ability to recover, but it wasn't meant to be used like this!</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin stared at his cell phone screen, not knowing what to do. He didn't dare directly refuse Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"How about... I pretend I didn't seen it?" Xiao Yin's hands were shaking.</p>

    <p>In a situation like this, ignoring it was usually the best way to avoid awkwardness! It was like your girlfriend looking for you when you were playing a game - there was no way you could tell her you were playing a game... so ignoring was the best option! It was better to wait for an appropriate time to reply later!</p>

    <p>Thinking this, Xiao Yin suddenly raised his head... This was probably the legendary non-action<sup>1</sup>, right?</p>

    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Based on the Taoist concept of 'Wu Wei' in the loose sense of not doing anything but letting things happen naturally.)</dfn>
    
    <p>Right! It had to be!</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin nodded his head firmly, and then directly steeled his heart and turned off the phone.</p>

    <p>He actually... ignored Master!</p>

    <p>For some reason, Xiao Yin felt that he was especially cool at that moment!</p>

    <p>Mm, there were times when you had to be aggressive! Learn to resist! Learn to say no! Even if the other party was a big boss, you couldn't bow to them!</p>

    <p>This was the dignity that every holy beast had to have!</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ling had very clearly seen through the cell phone screen Xiao Yin's flustered image as he sat on the sofa, including how he had turned his phone off...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling could activate his Heavenly Eye whenever he wanted and link his optic nerves to any type of screen. This was a new and modern spell which he had developed himself, like how he could control his nose hair to create a filter inside his nose against PM2.5<sup>2</sup>.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This refers to the concentration of fine particulate matter, and is a way to measure air pollution)</dfn>

    <p>After connecting his Heavenly Eye to Xiao Yin's cell phone screen and witnessing Xiao Yin's action, Wang Ling took a deep breath. Hm... he had actually been ignored...</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling wasn't angry at all. After all, the blood he wanted indeed was a bit too much... But this was an incomparable bargain for Xiao Yin.</p>

    <p>The twenty packets of crispy noodle snacks Wang Ling was using to buy this blood were part of his collection! Eating them would produce unimaginable benefits!</p>

    <p>"????"</p>

    <p>Phone in hand, Wang Ling sent another text.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Xiao Yin was stunned when his cell phone turned on by itself!</p>

    <p>What was going on?</p>

    <p>Could this phone start up on its own?</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin then saw the four question marks which Wang Ling had sent.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>Before he could turn the phone off again, Wang Ling's next text came through: "Give up, it's useless."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "I can turn on your phone remotely for you."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "I know you're reading this."</p>

    <p>And then, after several seconds...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't send a word, but a "kitchen knife" emoji.</p>

    <p>His meaning was very clear: If you don't come, I'll go get it myself...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was so scared he broke out in a cold sweat. He replied to Wang Ling in a panic. "Tomorrow! Is tomorrow fine?!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling replied: "Fine."</p>

    <p>Before Xiao Yin could calm down completely, Wang Ling's second reply came: "You won't get paid if you're late."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>
