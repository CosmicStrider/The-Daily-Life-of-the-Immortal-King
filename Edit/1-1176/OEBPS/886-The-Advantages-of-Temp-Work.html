  <h1>Chapter 886 The Advantages of Temp Work</h1>

  <div>

    <p>As the Toya clan's ancestral world-defying magic artifact, the Nine Cycles Exquisite Pagoda was an unprecedented boon for the clan. This was a magic artifact left behind by their ancestors back then. Unlike some person who relied on an ancestral grandmother to fight, the Nine Cycles Exquisite Pagoda's pagoda spirit had formidable fighting capabilities.</p>

    <p>"The fighting strength gained from a body possession - what do you think your chances of winning are?" Devil Gut Fungus Lord remained steadily aloft in the air. With just a wave of his hand, the innumerable Immortal Bugs on the ground suddenly rushed toward Immortal Toya like a swarm of locusts.</p>

    <p>The Immortal Bugs filled the sky and blocked out the sun, creating astonishing momentum as a gigantic shadow covered everything before it.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya couldn't let this wave of insects and super viruses touch him!!</p>

    <p>An ordinary Daoist robe wouldn't be able to withstand this wave at all - the smallest contact with a virus, and it would instantly be chewed up until there was nothing left but rags. However, it wouldn't be that easy for the virus-carrying Immortal Bugs to get close to Immortal Toya.</p>

    <p>"Out of my way!" Immortal Toya roared at the wave of insects.</p>

    <p>The next instant, his body moved on its own, controlled by the pagoda spirit. A green spirit light poured forth from his body and directly clashed with the black wave of insects which filled the sky. This green light was none other than the light of purification unique to alchemists, which was also related to the qi that alchemists accumulated in their bodies after refining medicine for many years, and which was called medicine qi.</p>

    <p>A senior alchemist could have thousands of different kinds of medicine qi, which had a lot to do with the medicinal ingredients he came into contact with while refining medicine. In order to make enough money to restore the Nine Cycles Exquisite Pagoda, Immortal Toya had practically worked himself to death by doing odd jobs, which hadn't been completely in vain.</p>

    <p>A lot of people might never bother with temp work, but it really was useful!</p>

    <p>While he worked during this period of time, Immortal Toya took on hundreds of different tasks and came into contact with far more medicinal ingredients than before. Since a lot of the medicines he refined were based on customer orders, it was the customers who had to provide all the medicinal ingredients. Even if Immortal Toya failed in the end, he still didn't need to pay compensation, since the customers who came to him for medicine refinement were generally insured against "medicine refinement risks" to minimize the loss from a failed refinement.</p>

    <p>On top of that, Immortal Toya also researched new pills and medicines, taking new approaches with their ingredients.</p>

    <p>The WIFI pill, portable charger pill, beauty makeover pill, and the Liuwei Dihuang pill <sup>1</sup> recently popular among A-list male celebrities were some examples. After a lot of medicinal ingredients were mixed together, they turned into new varieties of medicinal ingredients.</p>

    <p>Without Immortal Toya knowing it, he had actually already been exposed to more than a thousand medicinal ingredients, which included original and common medicinal ingredients, along with many rare and unusual ones. The medicine qi from these medicinal ingredients now overlapped each other, and drawing on the power of the pagoda spirit, the light of purification it created was in fact exceptionally powerful.</p>

    <p>The green light enveloped the sky, like the sun breaking through the dark night and the dawn slowly stretching over the horizon, as the light of purification passed through in a cycle <sup>2</sup> !</p>

"Miracle Reappearance," the
Chinese theme song for
"Ultraman Tiga.")</dfn>

    <p>The instant this light of purification, which contained over a thousand types of medicine qi, touched these virus-ridden Immortal Bugs, the insects actually emitted hot steam, and in the end turned into small fireballs as they were directly burned to a crisp!</p>

    <p>Looking at this scene, Immortal Toya was exultant.</p>

    <p>This light of purification combined with over a thousand types of medicine qi was simply the antithesis of both these viruses and Immortal Bugs.</p>

    <p>These insects that had attacked so fiercely thus gave off the sense of moths flying heroically into the flame; it was as if hundreds of thousands of moths were hurling themselves into the fire.</p>

    <p>Devil Gut Fungus Lord realized that he had underestimated the force of this light of purification, which contained over a thousand types of medicinal qi. This light didn't just contain medicine qi; also mixed into it were all kinds of antibiotics as well as the vitamins A, B, C, D, E, F, G...</p>

    <p>The Immortal Bugs couldn't get close to Immortal Toya at all, and neither could the viruses.</p>

    <p>However...</p>

    <p>Devil Gut Fungus Lord wasn't the least bit panicked.</p>

    <p>The Immortal Bugs' attack looked very intimidating, but in fact, Devil Gut Fungus Lord hadn't even used twenty percent of his strength.</p>

    <p>While this light of purification which contained medicine qi was very troublesome and could hold off hundreds of thousands of virus-ridden Immortal Bugs, then what if he increased the number?</p>

    <p>"Ten million Immortal Bugs..." The next moment, Devil Gut Fungus Lord flicked his finger. The earth trembled, and like a volcano erupting, endless waves of Immortal Bugs poured out in a frenzy from the crevasse in the ground.</p>

    <p>Both Immortal Toya and the pagoda spirit were shaken by this scene.</p>

    <p>This power had already completely surpassed True Immortal level...</p>

    <p>And most importantly, the abilities of these ten million virus-ridden Immortal Bugs had been completely upgraded!</p>

    <p>Each Immortal Bug was actually wrapped in a deep blue light.</p>

    <p>This was the power of the water element!</p>

    <p>President Bai originally had the power of Outer Dao to use the elements.</p>

    <p>After devouring President Bai's powers, Devil Gut Fungus Lord covered the Immortal Bugs with the power of water in reaction to being fried by the light of purification. These Immortal Bugs thus rose up once again, completely whole!</p>

    <p>What should he do now?</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya felt a little overwhelmed.</p>

    <p>Devil Gut Fungus Lord's abilities had improved too much after he devoured President Bai, Long Ming, as well as many of Night Chief's executive members.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya's face turned red under this terrible spiritual pressure.</p>

    <p>"Dammit... I can't hold on for much longer!" Immortal Toya bore up under the onslaught desperately.</p>

    <p>In the face of the pressure from these ten million Immortal Bugs, however, the green light of purification was fading little by little. Finally, this army of ten million insects were gnawing on Immortal Toya's fingers.</p>

    <p>Devil Gut Fungus Lord was greatly delighted at this scene.</p>

    <p>"Just like an ant trying to shake a big tree and a mantis trying to stop a chariot." He rattled off two idioms in a row, showing himself to be very cultured.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, he fixed his deep on gaze on Immortal Toya, who was being devoured.</p>

    <p>A moment later, he sensed Immortal Toya's aura vanish completely.</p>

    <p>He forgot all about devouring Immortal Toya, as he very carefully controlled the insects.</p>

    <p>His only goal was the Nine Cycles Exquisite Pagoda.</p>

    <p>He waved his hand, and the army of ten million insects dispersed.</p>

    <p>"Huh?"</p>

    <p>He was surprised to find that the green light of purification emitted by the pagoda spirit hadn't been completely annihilated; a small light like a firefly was still floating in the air.</p>

    <p>The next moment, Immortal Toya's body was reborn along with this firefly light.</p>

    <p>The outcome of this scene was completely unexpected.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya came back to life.</p>

    <p>And in that moment, there were actually two pagoda spirits standing behind Immortal Toya...</p>

    <p>What was this?</p>

    <p>Devil Gut Fungus Lord was very bewildered.</p>

    <p>The two pagoda spirits joined hands and whirled around Immortal Toya.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya smiled.</p>

    <p>In the end, this bacterium wasn't very cultured at all.</p>

    <p>He didn't even know the song-and-dance duet <sup>3</sup> ...</p>
