  <h1>Chapter 295 Everyone Has a Responsibility to Care for Animals </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling looked up into the sky, his red and black jacket flapping in the strong wind. With the jacket unbuttoned, one could clearly see the young man's distinct collarbone and defined lines.</p>

    <p>This was the weakest and thinnest body the silver horse had ever seen, but the spirit intensity of the energy it carried was shocking.</p>

    <p>This was just a human cultivator, yet he had such dense spirit energy despite the intrinsic spirit field and the core array pattern... and the silver horse was actually unable to match it.</p>

    <p>It already no longer had words to describe the strange feeling it was experiencing. This was the first time it felt like it wasn't fighting one human cultivator, but that it was pitting its entire strength against the whole world...</p>

    <p>The Chosen One... did such a person truly exist?</p>

    <p>The silver horse pondered this deeply as it turned into a fiery meteor.</p>

    <p>The intrinsic spirit field shook as the silver warhorse hurtled down from the sky toward Wang Ling; as for what would happen next, it had no idea. Two rounds of conflict had already told it one thing — the youngster in front of it defied common sense.</p>

    <p>To be or not to be... to do it or not, to hit him or not...</p>

    <p>In the second before it hit the ground, the silver warhorse felt that this philosophical question was just like Schrödinger's cat — you wouldn't know the outcome of something until you did it.</p>

    <p>Eyes fixed on this fiery meteor as it grew larger, Wang Ling drew in a deep breath. Even he had to admit that the attack this time round was so fierce that he would definitely be badly injured without any protection at all.</p>

    <p>Under such a fierce attack, cultivators would generally choose to put all their strength into defending themselves, but if it was Wang Ling, it would make things even more dangerous.</p>

    <p>The silver horse's strategy of sacrificing eight hundred to slay a thousand had been calculated by also taking the strength of Wang Ling's defense into account. Since ancient times, cultivators with Sage Bodies tended to be arrogant, and liked to rely on their golden bodies to charge forward.</p>

    <p>But the silver horse had misread Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Even if he had the powers of a Sage Body, for Wang Ling, the best defense was actually offense.</p>

    <p>And so, when the silver warhorse had turned itself into a falling star, Wang Ling had been gathering power in his right fist.</p>

    <p>One punch!</p>

    <p>There was a tremendous "bang" inside the intrinsic spirit field!</p>

    <p>It was as if Lord Diulei and the others could see a thirty-zhang wide warhead being fired directly out of an invisible cannon with Wang Ling at its center. The powerful recoil caused the ground behind him to straightaway cave in.</p>

    <p>The wind pressure from this punch was enough to make the silver horse cough up blood the moment the pressure reached it. If its armor hadn't absorbed some of the damage from the wind pressure, it would have already been killed.</p>

    <p>As a holy beast, however, it refused to yield no matter what, and it went all out in one last dive at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But for Wang Ling, all this was utterly meaningless.</p>

    <p>Behind the silver warhorse, the female elder in purple and the slit-eyed female cultivator looked on helplessly as that fiery meteor was stopped by the power of Wang Ling's fist, and tragically fell to one side.</p>

    <p>It crash landed...</p>

    <p>In that moment, Wang Ling couldn't help wanting to recite a poem.</p>

    <p>— Then I would die, and even my feathers would rot in the soil...Why are my eyes always brimming with tears...</p>

    <p>Because I love this land so deeply<sup>1</sup>...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(From the poem "I Love This Land" by Ai Qing)</dfn>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Shifu, has Senior Uncle Feifei... lost?" asked the slit-eyed female cultivator as she gnawed her fingers.</p>

    <p>The face of the female elder in purple twitched, but before she could knock her silly disciple over the head, that young man's punch, which had been like a shot from a cannon, had already smashed into the spirit wall of the intrinsic spirit field. Numerous web-like cracks instantly appeared and spread out over the spirit wall.</p>

    <p>"Not good!"</p>

    <p>The female elder was pale with fright — it was all over. The silver warhorse was badly injured, and the secret key to the spirit field had lost its usefulness.</p>

    <p>Hence, the moment that the spirit wall was hit, both of them were flung out heavily by the spirit field, and they hit the flat top of Yuntai Pavilion.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ling and his company also retreated after the intrinsic spirit field was destroyed.</p>

    <p>The protective golden glow kept them perfectly safe from the blast of the spirit field being destroyed, and enabled them to land steadily on the ground.</p>

    <p>Coughing up a mouthful of blood, the silver warhorse fell over on one side of the platform, its neck at a crooked angle.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed inwardly as he gazed at this silver horse. Its expression was obstinate and full of wrath as it tried to get up again.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised his foot as he wondered whether he should stomp on it or chop it with his blade one final time. In the end, Lord Diulei stopped him with a shout. "Brother Ling, show some mercy. Although there are no more holy beasts, if they were still around, they would be nationally protected animals."</p>

    <p>Oh...So it was a nationally protected animal.</p>

    <p>After some thought, Wang Ling in the end removed his foot. The warhorse's head was drenched in sweat.</p>

    <p>It could already picture what the ending would have been like if that foot had stomped down. Now, although its heart was injured and bleeding, at least it hadn't been completely destroyed. For this serious wound, it only needed five days... no, just three days, to get back on its feet!</p>

    <p>If a normal spirit beast, even a first-class one, had been this heavily injured and wasn't treated immediately, it could only wait to die.</p>

    <p>The reason why holy beasts were called as such was because of their immense life force; it was also the reason why they had become extinct.</p>

    <p>Back then, cultivators who sought the heavenly path in pursuit of immortality would fight over the hearts of holy beasts, even starting world wars over a single beast heart. But modern cultivation science had demonstrated that the reason why these beast hearts were so powerful was because holy beasts had unique blood compositions.</p>

    <p>To put it simply, a beast heart could only function effectively when it was in the body of a holy beast. Once it was taken out, this thing was just like some healthcare laxative.</p>

    <p>In that moment, this silver warhorse with the crooked neck gasping on the ground had already lost all of its previous stubbornness. It had always harbored a profound hatred of human cultivators; the only reason it had chosen to cooperate with Immortal Mansion was purely for the sake of revenge. Hence, it wouldn't give even the Master of Immortal Mansion any face.</p>

    <p>But after just a few rounds against Wang Ling, it realized that this human cultivator wasn't like any of the other trash humans it had ever seen before!</p>

    <p>And so, when Wang Ling had approached it, for the first time in its life, it had felt thick terror.</p>

    <p>Everything cycled back to that oft-asked question.</p>

    <p>"Who... on earth are you?" the silver warhorse asked fearfully, as it lay helpless on the ground.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt like every single time he fought and won, the other party would always ask this question.</p>

    <p>But he had already prepared for this today.</p>

    <p>Spirit light flashed in his hand, and a brown notebook appeared.</p>

    <p>The silver warhorse laughed weakly. "Are you going to subdue me with the law when I'm down?"</p>

    <p>After that, it realized that it was thinking too much.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling placed the brown notebook in front of it.</p>

    <p>To the silver horse's surprise, it was actually a student ID card...</p>

    <p>The silver warhorse: "..."</p>
