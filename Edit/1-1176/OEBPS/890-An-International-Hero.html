  <h1>Chapter 890 An International Hero!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>A drop of divine liquid shook the sky as the ripples swept over the ground and caused heaven and earth to fall silent. Even Immortal Toya was shocked at the power of this drop of divine liquid. After throwing it out, he remained unmoving and silent in the sky for a long time, utterly shaken by this scene.</p>

    <p>All this time...</p>

    <p>Ling Zhenren was far, far stronger than Immortal Toya had imagined.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya of course knew that Ling Zhenren was a top expert. But now, after experiencing the formidable power of this drop of disinfectant for himself, Immortal Toya thoroughly understood.</p>

    <p>This... wasn't a damn top expert!</p>

    <p>This was simply a god!</p>

    <p>It seemed...</p>

    <p>Ling Zhenren had a very close connection to the Domain of the Gods!</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya worshiped Wang Ling in his heart.</p>

    <p>This wasn't a technique a person in the world below was capable of. In Immortal Toya's opinion, Wang Ling was already far beyond even Venerated Immortal level, and only the legendary experts from the Domain of the Gods could reach realms above Venerated Immortal.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya had already encountered both Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi.</p>

    <p>These two people were originally experts with exceptional abilities from the Domain of the Gods.</p>

    <p>But what puzzled Immortal Toya a little was that, looking at Ling Zhenren, the latter seemed to have a very limited understanding of the Domain of the Gods.</p>

    <p>Could it be possible that Ling Zhenren wasn't from the Domain of the Gods?</p>

    <p>Or perhaps...</p>

    <p>Was there another realm above the Domain of the Gods in this world?</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya pondered this in his heart.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, in Porcelaino's eyes, what Immortal Toya did just now was simply like a miracle descending...</p>

    <p>"So this is an expert..." Porcelaino had to admit he had been short-sighted; he thought this foreigner from Huaxiu wasn't strong, and never expected the other party to actually take out such a magic treasure.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, after sending out that drop of divine liquid, which clearly had such astonishing power, the other party was completely unruffled as he stood in the air, as if he had done a minor thing...</p>

    <p>This was a genuine expert!</p>

    <p>It was clear that this expert had already experienced many battles. In the face of such strong fluctuations, he remained unmoved - this was the true style of an Almighty.</p>

    <p>It was just that in Huaxiu, there really weren't many experts who were famous abroad.</p>

    <p>This was because each country worked in a different way.</p>

    <p>Huaxiu Alliance didn't have a hero cultivator system like Mixiu Alliance did. Cultivators who were famous in Huaxiu Alliance might not be known internationally â€” their latest rising star was that Lord Diulei, the first True Venerated in the world.</p>

    <p>And in Huaxiu Alliance, apart from the Ten Generals, Porcelaino didn't know any other cultivator at all.</p>

    <p><em>Bzz!</em></p>

    <p>This drop of divine fluid finally pushed through everything. It fell on Devil Gut Fungus Lord's chest and instantly dissolved.</p>

    <p>Devil Gut Fungus Lord gave a gut-wrenching scream. There was nothing he could do to block the power in this drop of divine liquid.</p>

    <p>At that very moment, Devil Gut Fungus Lord felt like an ice cube being boiled as endless steam evaporated from his body. He gripped his head and yelled, "You created me... but now you want to destroy me..."</p>

    <p>He had already accepted the truth of his creation since he realized that he couldn't withstand this destructive force at all.</p>

    <p>"If you were devoted to doing good, I might have let you keep your life, but you caused so much trouble. Naturally, you can't be allowed to live." Immortal Toya stared at the dying Devil Gut Fungus Lord, whose body was already half on fire.</p>

    <p>In the distance, more and more hero cultivators were arriving, many with mud and bruises on them.</p>

    <p>They had all rushed to the frontline to provide backup after receiving the order from Mixiu Alliance, but just as they were about to get there, there had been a sudden explosion of overwhelming spirit power up ahead. Some of the hero cultivators had been so startled that their auras destabilized and they fell straight down from the sky...</p>

    <p>That was how they got their bruises and scars.</p>

    <p>"Don't be afraid! I am here!" A burly blond man hovered in the sky with his arms folded. He originally had a skinny physique, but the moment he reached the frontline, his muscles swelled as if they had been inflated!</p>

    <p>Even Porcelaino couldn't help bowing when he saw him. "Mr Olu!"</p>

    <p>This was Olu, an SSS-Class hero known as Light of the City! He was also the most famous hero cultivator in Mixiu Alliance, and currently the only SSS-Class hero!</p>

    <p>But when he arrived at the scene, Devil Gut Fungus Lord was already dying.</p>

    <p>Mr Olu sighed a little disappointedly. "It seems that there's no need for me to fight. But that's good too..."</p>

    <p>As the "Light of the City," Mr Olu was in fact very tired every time he carried out a mission. The thing about his unique technique was that he had to eat hair to gain power; with each strand of hair he ate, his strength would double.</p>

    <p>Given how dangerous Devil Gut Fungus Lord was, Mr Olu had thought he might have to eat up all his hair this time.</p>

    <p>His bald head was a sign that he was at his strongest, and also the origin of his hero codename "Light of the City."</p>

    <p>Porcelaino: "This Huaxiu little brother isn't ordinary; Mr Olu probably already sensed it just now."</p>

    <p>Mr Olu nodded. That indeed was very formidable strength. None of their Mixiu Alliance cultivators, including him, could release such strong spirit power.</p>

    <p>By now, Devil Gut Fungus Lord had been reduced to flying ash.</p>

    <p>Mr Olu and Porcelaino went forward to pay their respects to Immortal Toya on behalf of the group of hero cultivators. "Brother... may I ask, what divine being are you?"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "I am from the Office of Strategic Deception."</p>

    <p>All the hero cultivators instantly understood. It turned out he was from that new sect set up by the True Venerated!</p>

    <p>"Then may I ask, Your Excellency..." Porcelaino wanted to ask another question.</p>

    <p>Chin in hand, Immortal Toya pondered carefully, and felt that he shouldn't reveal too much abroad.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "I'm not the sect leader; for a fiend of this level, there's no need at all for our sect leader to take action himself."</p>

    <p>"Then may I ask, what is this brother's Daoist name?"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya quickly replied, "I don't have a Daoist name. But remember my name."</p>

    <p>"Go ahead, brother!"</p>

    <p>"My name - is Zhuo Yi!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>That evening, after washing and getting ready for bed, Zhuo Yi turned on the TV. The female newsreader was giving an eloquent report: "According to the latest news we've received, the villain who invaded Mixiu's border today has already been annihilated by Zhuo Yi, a cultivator from the Office of Strategic Deception. What kind of divine being is this Mr Zhuo Yi? Let's listen to what other hero cultivators have to say about Zhuo Yi."</p>

    <p>"????"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi rubbed his eyes and repeatedly confirmed the news caption.</p>

    <p>That couldn't be...</p>

    <p>When did he go abroad?</p>
