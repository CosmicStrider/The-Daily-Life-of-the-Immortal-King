  <h1>Chapter 478 Battle Saint Jiang Lei </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Of course, the old man had just carelessly proposed "neutering." After all, spirit beasts also had spiritual intelligence, unlike before. An intelligent spirit beast would restrain from acting recklessly on their emotions, otherwise it wouldn't be any different from a toy poodle <sup>1</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The joke is that toy poodles are supposedly very randy..)</dfn>

    <p>What the old man was mainly worried about was that Er Ha was out from morning until night these days.</p>

    <p>On one hand, the old man in fact knew that Er Ha had been involved somehow in the Demon Hunters Association incident that had happened recently. The leader of the Demon Hunters Association hadn't been caught; what happened if Er Ha was out and someone took revenge on it? On the other hand, there were actually a lot of instances now where people weren't careful in making friends in society; who knew whether their pure Er Ha was being led astray by some dodgy friends?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling realized that Father Wang's talent for writing novels might really have been inherited from the old man. The older a person was, the bigger the hole in their brain, and the easier it was for them to come up with wild fantasies. Even in choosing a daughter-in-law, the old man had selected a "Numinous Mother with the Magic Hands" for Father Wang...</p>

    <p>"Dad, you just do your own thing; I'll get Ling Ling to look for Er Ha later, it'll be alright." Seeing the worried look on the old man's face, Mother Wang comforted him and then watched Sheep take him out to buy fish. She then turned to go upstairs and look for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling instantly knew that he couldn't avoid looking for Er Ha.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, however, he had already finished two exams and he felt that except for the essay sections, he could handle the history and political science exams on the following Monday.</p>

    <p>He had plenty of time to deal with this Er Ha this Saturday.</p>

    <p>Actually, it would be very easy to find Er Ha; as long as he used the spirit beast contract, Wang Ling would be able to easily determine Er Ha's general location.</p>

    <p>But right now, he felt that finding Er Ha wasn't the important point; rather, it was what Er Ha was hiding.</p>

    <p>A lazy dog suddenly cultivating solicitously, and going out everyday from morning until night... The most terrible thing, moreover, was that it had learned to hide money now! If he didn't know that his dog wasn't the slatternly type, Wang Ling would have really thought that Er Ha was keeping a female dog outside.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed. In fact, even if Mother Wang and the old man hadn't said anything, he would have done something himself.</p>

    <p>But first, he had to find out what secret Er Ha was hiding...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Er Ha went out in the morning. Because the Wang family's small villa was in a relatively remote location, it had to catch the first spirit bus in the morning in order to meet Wei Zhi at the appointed time. The suburban spirit bus picked up quite a few passengers along the way. If this had been a spirit bus in the city, people would already be standing butt to butt by now.</p>

    <p>Except for the subway, all other transport vehicles didn't use the Space Expansion Skill.</p>

    <p>For Er Ha, taking the spirit bus was a relatively convenient choice, and its routine for getting on was the same as the last time: it snuck in swiftly and then found a place to hide. When it got off, it left a few coins below the seat.</p>

    <p>It would have taken fifteen minutes on a sword to directly reach Wei Zhi's apartment in a straight line from the Wang family's small villa. However, the spirit bus would still be slow no matter what; it took Er Ha fully an hour and a half to reach Wei Zhi's apartment.</p>

    <p>And as Er Ha had predicted, if it had left home half an hour later, it would have been late.</p>

    <p>After arriving at the family apartment building downstairs, Er Ha squeezed into the underbrush and sent Wei Zhi its location to indicate that it had already arrived and Wei Zhi should come pick it up.</p>

    <p>Why had it squeezed into the underbrush?</p>

    <p>If a person saw a green akita that knew how to chat on a cell phone, this would probably become community news... so Er Ha was very vigilant on this point.</p>

    <p>At the same time, it also noticed that the security guards from before had been switched out and the main entrance was tightly shut. No one could enter without an apartment access card, unless their acquaintance came down to pick them up.</p>

    <p>It was clear that the previous incident with the bone dragon man and the group from the Demon Hunters Association breaking into the family apartment by buying off the security guards with several cigarette packs had been taken very seriously. The current apartment security guards were clearly a new lot and looked very strict, as if the Mighty Miracle God himself guarded the gate.</p>

    <p>After sending the text message, Er Ha jumped out of the underbrush and waited for Wei Zhi at the entrance as they had agreed.</p>

    <p>In the security booth, a couple of security guards saw a green-furred dog appear at the apartment entrance and their eyes instantly felt refreshed...</p>

    <p>The two security guards on duty chatted in the security booth with their attention fixed on Er Ha.</p>

    <p>"The color of this dog fur is very strange."</p>

    <p>"It's fine, at least it's easy on the eyes."</p>

    <p>"Look, it's staring at us."</p>

    <p>"Whose dog is this? We could just let it in; It looks a little cute at first sight."</p>

    <p>"Don't cause trouble; if it's really from the apartment, its owner will definitely come downstairs to get it. The batch of security guards before us were fired because they let people in randomly. Even the old captain was implicated and fired."</p>

    <p>After that, the security guard who had wanted to let Er Ha was instantly silent. To tell the truth, this family apartment wasn't an ordinary place and they were paid very well to stay here. Even if they were security guards, they were all veterans who had been discharged from the army with very high professional qualifications.</p>

    <p>As for the last time when people from the Demon Hunters Association had been secretly let in simply for the price of a pack of cigarettes, that had purely been a mistake on the job.</p>

    <p>It was said that at noon that day, the brother who had let them in had drunk a little wine because he had been feeling heartbroken and depressed, and so hadn't been in his right mind. But who would have thought that the incident could have blown up like this.</p>

    <p>Director Jiang had been directly involved, so no one had dared say anything.</p>

    <p>Actually, for most people, being fired could be considered a very light punishment. In the family apartment where Wei Zhi lived, Director Jiang's identity actually wasn't a secret. This was Marshal Jiang, a person who could stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Blademaster General Yi. He was the Battle Saint who back then had killed a demon king with a single punch and a demon god with two punches.</p>

    <p>So forget just dismissing that group of brothers; he only needed to say one word if he wanted to thoroughly investigate them and erase all records of their time in the army, washing away their reputations.</p>

    <p>As the two security guards sighed in their hearts when they were thinking this, they just so happened to see a figure appear behind Er Ha.</p>

    <p>Er Ha sensed a shadow looming over it. It turned its head and saw an old man standing behind it; he was wearing a white singlet and bell-bottomed pants, and a bunch of keys hung from his waist.</p>

    <p>The same outfit as before...</p>

    <p>Er Ha was stupefied. Wasn't this the old man who had read the water meter?</p>

    <p>It also remembered that Wei Zhi had explained who the old man was.</p>

    <p>He was the landlord of the family apartment building and the Battle Saint who was one of the Ten Founding Generals, Jiang Lei...</p>

    <p>It was clear that the moment he saw Er Ha, Marshal Jiang couldn't help cocking his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>He stared at Er Ha thoughtfully. "I remember you... you belong to that whatever Zhi?"</p>

    <p>"Wei Zhi..." Er Ha couldn't resist reminding him.</p>

    <p>"Wei what Zhi?"</p>

    <p>"Wei Zhi..."</p>

    <p>"What Wei, what Zhi?</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
