  <h1>Chapter 17 It Was Just a Fucking Ordinary High School Student! </h1>

  <div>

      

      <p>Then again, this wasn't the main issue.</p>

      <p>The real issue was, how long had this person actually been here, and how much had he heard?</p>

      <p>He was an expert at the late Golden Core stage, but he couldn't even sense the aura of a Foundation Establishment high school student next to him? Xu Ying felt this didn't make sense.</p>

      <p>"How long have you been here?" He couldn't help the few drops of cold sweat that rolled down behind his black mask.</p>

      <p>Wang Ling jumped down from the top of the rooftop building, dusted off his pants, and stared carefully at Xu Ying. "From that sentence, 'There is a rip-roaring wind today'."</p>

      <p>Wang Ling's cool voice sounded in Xu Ying's mind, and there were traces of magic in its echo, startling him again. A Foundation Establishment high school student could actually communicate telepathically?</p>

      <p>Xu Ying: "..." He would definitely find out who this chuuni <sup>1</sup> teen was before he killed him!</p>

      <dfn><sup>1</sup>"Chuuni" is short for the Japanese term "chuunibyou," which translates to "second year of middle school sickness," and describes teenagers going through a phase where they try to act cool or edgy.</dfn>

      <p>He narrowed his eyes slightly at Wang Ling — the latter just looked like a very ordinary high school student. Yet for some reason, his breathing picked up.</p>

      <p>When people were nervous, they would experience an adrenaline rush. Cultivators, moreover, would usually release spiritual pressure as a warning to their opponents, and through the collision of spiritual pressures, learn the extent of their strength.</p>

      <p>This was only a Foundation Establishment high school student, there was absolutely no way he would be able to withstand his pressure!</p>

      <p>Xu Ying comforted himself repeatedly.</p>

      <p><em>Bzz! </em>He released all his spiritual pressure and bombarded Wang Ling with it!</p>

      <p>Tremble, young man!</p>

      <p>Kneel and surrender!</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>The minutes ticked away in a dead silence.</p>

      <p>"..." Wang Ling just nonchalantly raised his eyes to look at him.</p>

      <p>Xu Ying was shocked. All his spiritual pressure was bearing down on this teenager, but it wasn't any fucking use!</p>

      <p>Forget knocking him over, there wasn't even any fucking friction!</p>

      <p>He could build mountains with the bones of the countless number of people he had killed. Never could he have imagined that the first difficult opponent he would ever face would be a high school student!</p>

      <p>Right now, staring closely at Wang Ling, Xu Ying had already broken out in a cold sweat...</p>

      <p>He was only an ordinary Foundation Establishment senior high school student, yet he made him extremely nervous.</p>

      <p>At that moment, Xu Ying swiftly advanced and punched him.</p>

      <p><em>Whoosh! </em>— A tremendous wind was raised, blowing Wang Ling's short hair back.</p>

      <p>Actual combat was always the best way to test someone's strength!</p>

      <p>Perhaps the teenager was one of those people born with a weak ability to perceive spiritual pressure... but Xu Ying's punch was the real deal — a Foundation Establishment cultivator would be killed by it, not to mention a high school student who had never been professionally trained for combat. Combat training was an advanced course only taught at Golden Core universities.</p>

      <p>Xu Ying felt sorry for Wang Ling. He was just a high school youngster at the Foundation Establishment stage, and a future flower of the motherland. He hadn't fully enjoyed life, hadn't seen the beautiful rivers and mountains of the country, hadn't fallen in love... just because he had been a busybody, he was going to die.</p>

      <p>"Sayonara..." He sighed in his heart, and aimed a punch directly at Wang Ling's chest.</p>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p>There wasn't the slightest flicker in Wang Ling's expression. To be honest, he felt sorry for Xu Ying, a cultivator who hadn't even reached the Soul Formation stage. He hadn't fully enjoyed the experience of being born-again at the Nascent Soul stage, hadn't experienced the enlightenment of becoming one with nature at the Soul Formation stage, hadn't discovered the truth of the variations between Yin and Yang at the Fusion stage, hadn't enjoyed the pleasure of the flight towards immortality at the Tribulation Transcendence stage... just because he had punched Wang Ling, he was going to become a cripple.</p>

      <p><em>" </em>Bang! <em>"</em></p>

      <p>Like smashing a golden bell, the punch hit Wang Ling's chest unerringly with a resounding roar. In a split second, the rooftop shook mightily with the impact.</p>

      <p>However, Wang Ling was rock-solid and motionless...</p>

      <p>Then, with a <em>boom </em>, Xu Ying, the assassin leading this attack, jerked as if he had been struck by lightning. Blood gushed out of his mouth like a fountain, and he flew backward like a jet...</p>

      <p>He was bleeding from all the seven orifices of his head as he lay spread-eagled on the ground, spitting up blood foam. His face was twisted grotesquely from the intense pain, and in one instant, all his bones had been broken into pieces...</p>

      <p>What... the hell happened?</p>

      <p>Xu Ying had felt like he was punching a piece of magic iron. It was completely like throwing an egg at a rock — at the moment of impact, the bones in his fist had cracked one by one.</p>

      <p>It was only a fucking high school student... how could he have such a strong body?! This was really so fucked up!</p>

      <p>That was the last thought this chief of the killers had before passing out.</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>Shadow Stream's Red Ribbon killers were very famous in all of the murder industry, and the most famous among them were the legendary three... the Three Young Masters of Burying Love.</p>

      <p>The Three Young Masters of Burying Love — Eldest Young Master Xu Ying, Second Young Master Xu Feng and Third Young Master Xu Jian!</p>

      <p>In the last few years, the Three Young Masters had shaken the world, and dominated the business of murder. It could be said that there was no one who didn't know them.</p>

      <p>Nobody could have imagined that this Eldest Young Master, an industrial heavyweight, would die before his mission had even begun...</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>It was now noon, and lunch time at Number 60 High School. Usually once class was over, a group of people could be seen holding up their tableware and running hellbent to the canteen.</p>

      <p>But given the security warning in the last few days, everyone was forcibly confined to the classrooms, and the canteen sent lunchboxes directly to the classroom doors. The students were bored to death.</p>

      <p>Teacher Pan was sitting in the classroom, quickly going through and marking the exercise books for the Dao talismans course.</p>

      <p>Because of Shadow Stream's letter of challenge, physical education class had been cancelled in the last few days. As one of the vanguard teachers at Number 60 High School, she had seized the opportunity to progress more quickly in teaching the Dao talismans course.</p>

      <p>Bored stiff, Chen Chao was spinning a pen, and Guo Hao was teasing Er Dan. Both of them looked like they were ready to die — damn it, they had spent the whole morning writing talismans from memory! It was so boring! What was the point of drawing them carefully over and over again? Would it help them get an SSS in the Dao talismans exam?</p>

      <p>It wasn't just Chen Chao, all the boys felt roughly the same. Their very few physical education classes a week, wasted just like that... in Chen Chao's view, this was simply a waste of life! It was no different from the life of a loser!</p>

      <p>Looking around, he was surprised to see that quite a number of the top students in the class — as well as some weirdos — were staying calm.</p>

      <p>Like Lin Xiaoyu, who might seem carefree usually, but was very prudent when it came to studying. The key thing was, until now, this scary girl had gotten all full marks in her Dao talismans exercise book.</p>

      <p>Or like Su Xiao, the commissary in charge of studies, who was so quiet it was disturbing. From beginning to end, he had his head lowered as he wrote rapidly in his book. Chen Chao was sure that for someone like Su Xiao to get into the elite class was all solely due to his diligence.</p>

      <p>And the third person was Wang Ling. Maybe it was a guy's intuition, but from the assessment interview, up to Wang Ling summoning a demon king in their first Dao talismans lesson, plus his consistently average results in every dictation test and every quiz they had, he felt that Wang Ling wasn't as simple as he looked.</p>

      <p>Chen Chao was a man who believed in coincidences, but when so many coincidences happened to the same person at the same time, he couldn't help but begin to re-examine Wang Ling.</p>

      <p>He had once even suspected that the exceptionally powerful person who had annihilated the two Shadow Stream killers and protected Sun Rong that day at the Xiao Family Compound was Wang Ling himself... of course, this was purely just an assumption, as he had no evidence to back it up.</p>

      <p>However, he felt that anyone whom Classmate Sun Rong took a fancy to absolutely wouldn't be an ordinary person...</p>

      <p>The truth was that he didn't know much about Wang Ling's family circumstances, but he just had a feeling that his background might not be that simple.</p>
