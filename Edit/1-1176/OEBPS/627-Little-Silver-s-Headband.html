  <h1>Chapter 627 Xiao Yin's Headband</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Xiao Yin was a pure "Silver," one who was free of low tastes.</p>

    <p>The instant he saw the string-like lingerie, Lord Diulei had no idea how to explain it for a moment; rather, he was wondering how to explain it without appearing vulgar. Xiao Yin, who had just entered society, didn't know much about the ways of the world... Since Brother Ling had entrusted him with Xiao Yin's care, Lord Diulei had to have confidence in himself! Given Brother Ling's master level, surely it wasn't because of lack of money that Brother Ling had left Xiao Yin with him, right?</p>

    <p>There were quite a few "veterans" in the chat group who would say dirty stuff from time to time, but after Xiao Yin joined the group, Lord Diulei had immediately announced a ban on any uncivilized conduct. Ultimately, he didn't want Xiao Yin to be led astray while in his care.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling trusts me so much, I must guide Xiao Yin properly..." Thinking this, Lord Diulei nodded with a resolute face.</p>

    <p>However, Xiao Yin wasn't someone who could be easily fooled. Because there were many things which he didn't understand, Xiao Yin was often quite stubborn about learning things, and had to find answers which satisfied him.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei knew that if he couldn't come up with a reasonable explanation now, Xiao Yin would learn about it through some other means.</p>

    <p>"Thunder, what on earth is this? Why is your expression so strange?" Xiao Yin asked suspiciously. He had tried asking several times and found that Lord Diulei had sunk into deep thought with his chin in his hands as he stared at this pink string.</p>

    <p>"Oh... it's nothing, I was just wondering if you liked the color." Lord Diulei gave a quick-witted reply and didn't give Xiao Yin any reason to doubt him.</p>

    <p>"Pink is fine. Some people online say that pink is very girly, but I like this color a lot. Everyone is free to like whatever color they want," Xiao Yin replied swiftly.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin didn't discriminate against pink as a color. As for the theory online that those who used pink were sissies, he didn't really understand it. Xiao Yin was neutral to the color pink; he would use it at home now and then, but would never wear it out.</p>

    <p>Hearing Xiao Yin say this, Lord Diulei instantly relaxed and smiled at Xiao Yin as he pointed at this pink lingerie and said, "Actually, this is a headband."</p>

    <p>"Headband?"</p>

    <p>"Yes... headband..." Lord Diulei said. "When you wash your face, you can tie it around your forehead to keep your hair from getting wet. Of course, you can also use it to absorb your sweat when you exercise."</p>

    <p>"Is that so..." Xiao Yin frowned as he stared at the "pink headband," because he felt that Thunder's expression was somehow a little strange.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei tried to make his expression as natural as possible. "Yes, it really is a headband."</p>

    <p>"Fine, then; in any case, I'll use it at home, and I won't be taking it out." Xiao Yin pursed his lips.</p>

    <p>Then he stared gloomily at the lubricant, the candles and the leather whip on the side; he really couldn't understand why the headband had been sent with these three things...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After receiving the delivery, Xiao Yin went to wash his face and then planned to put on a face mask. This was a habit that Xiao Yin had developed recently. Everyone needed to take care of their skin, and Xiao Yin certainly wasn't an exception. He actually learned to use face masks from Lord Diulei, and even the masks he used were from Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, cleansing face masks for cultivators were different from ordinary ones. This was a true cosmetic face mask, with liposuction, acupuncture and face shaping effects. After putting it on, the whole face would be as white as an egg. Furthermore, the worse a person's skin was, the better the effect. The effects of one face mask could last for a month.</p>

    <p>Actually, Thunder felt that Xiao Yin didn't need to use them at all because this guy's face was pretty fair to begin with... Thunder knew that when Xiao Yin went to visit the Wang family's small villa, Mother Wang had bestowed the nickname "white-faced" girl on Xiao Yin.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei felt that as a holy beast, Xiao Yin's aesthetics were actually pretty good.</p>

    <p>Since Xiao Yin was going to put on a face mask, the pink "headband" just happened to come in handy. When Lord Diulei saw this scene, his entire expression didn't look right.</p>

    <p>Then he saw Xiao Yin lean back against the sofa and turn on his phone, as if he was about to make a video call. Lord Diulei's lips twitched. "Brother Xiao, what are you doing..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "I'm calling Er Ha; it's looking for me, and it said that Master has an important combat mission for me."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "You're calling it with a face mask on... that's not very good, is it?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "What's wrong with it, we're family. This Er Ha still can't take human form. If I put a face mask on in front of it, it would be so envious!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>"Every time we see each other, it's always showing off. Now it's my turn!" Xiao Yin patted the mask and tried his best to smooth it out without leaving any air bubbles.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei now really hoped that Brother Dog didn't know too much...</p>

    <p>The ringing lasted for about a minute before Er Ha accepted Xiao Yin's video chat.</p>

    <p>Soon, the video image came through.</p>

    <p>The first thing Er Ha saw was Xiao Yin putting on the face mask, and from Xiao Yin's smug expression, it was very obvious that this guy was doing this on purpose...</p>

    <p>Er Ha's lips twitched, and then its keen eyes caught sight of the "pink headband" around Xiao Yin's forehead...</p>

    <p>Er Ha was stunned on the spot. "Xiao Yin... Your headband is very unique!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "Of course. It was a freebie with a magic artifact I bought. The color is standard, but it's very silky smooth to use. Also, when I tied it around my head, it makes me want to be touched for some reason..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Right now, Thunder really wanted to find a hole to burrow into.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "... Didn't Thunder tell you what it is?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "Thunder said it's a headband!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Head, head, head... headband?" Er Ha obviously knew that Xiao Yin had very likely been duped, but it didn't have the heart to expose this lie. On the contrary, it could pretty much understand Lord Diulei's line of thinking...</p>

    <p>So even if it knew what the pink headband was...</p>

    <p>Er Ha still did its best to continue smiling in the video. "Your headband, looks very nice..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "Smart of you to know! Jealous? How about I order an identical one for you? Hm?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha's lips twitched. "Better not..."</p>

    <p>It wasn't in the habit of putting underwear on its head!</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "But I have to trouble you to pass on a message to Thunder for me..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "What do you want to say? My speaker is on, he's right next to me."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "I want to ask him, after nine years of compulsory education... why is he so amazing<sup>1</sup>?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The original meme, more precisely, is "we/everyone had the same nine years of compulsory education, but why are you so awesome?")</dfn>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>
