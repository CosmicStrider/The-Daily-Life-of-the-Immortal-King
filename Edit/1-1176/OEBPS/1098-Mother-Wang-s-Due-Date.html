  <h1>Chapter 1098 Mother Wang's Due Date</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling completely never expected that his short essay, in which he secretly complained about Father Wang docking his pocket money, would actually be shared by his teacher in the group, and then interpreted in such a way. A lot of people struggled when it came to the ability to interpret something subjectively, but teachers were mysterious creatures... Chinese teachers, in particular, were frequently able to extract from an essay some message which even the original writer didn't know about.</p>

    <p>For example, some adjective was repeated in this and that sentence, thus expressing some emotion of the writer's...</p>

    <p>But it could just be that the writer didn't know enough and could only use the same adjective over and over again.</p>

    <p>Or as another example, an exclamation point at the end of some sentence was conveying what the writer felt.</p>

    <p>The truth was that the kind of punctuation which a writer used at the end of their writing simply depended on their mood.</p>

    <p>For instance, when you look at this sentence, you'll notice that there's an exclamation mark at the end!</p>

    <p>But for the sake of picking out a theme, teachers would always rack their brains for the original writer's meaning.</p>

    <p>And most unfortunately, Wang Ling was misunderstood, just like that.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling got home that night, Father Wang had left thirty-five yuan and sixty-eight cents on the table along with a note: The editorial office organized a viewing of the major motion picture My Country and I for authors and their wives. There's just enough money here for you to buy a decent takeout. It's a place close to home, and your mom and I have already inspected it. It's pretty good and their bentos are nutritious. A nutritious assorted bento just so happens to cost thirty-five yuan and sixty-eight cents. Use this money and buy yourself a takeout.</p>

    <p>The corner of Wang Ling's mouth twitched. "..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang was as stingy as usual.</p>

    <p>But this was Father Wang's usual practice, and Wang Ling was long used to it.</p>

    <p>Actually, he could have used mobile pay, but you couldn't specify the amount down to 0.01 yuan during the transfer, so Father Wang had simply left the cash on the table in order to use up the cash they had at home.</p>

    <p>Mobile pay in Huaxiu nation had reached its peak under the leadership of the two Boss Mas. Because of how convenient it was, everyone basically just needed to take their phones with them when they went out. The thieves who worked during the Spring Festival couldn't even steal wallets anymore. They could only target phones, but the problem was that most people now always had their phones in their hands.</p>

    <p>The emergence of mobile pay was a severe blow to professions like pickpocketing.</p>

    <p>At the same time, many people gradually fell out of the habit of using cash as they got used to mobile pay. Before mobile pay became so convenient, part of Father Wang's author's remuneration had been mailed to him.</p>

    <p>Thus, Father Wang had collected quite an amount of cash at home over the years.</p>

    <p>Father Wang had thought of putting it in the bank before, but when he thought about how he would have to go to the bank and withdraw the money again when he needed it, he felt it was very troublesome, and so just stored it at home.</p>

    <p>Now, this cash was primarily used to give Wang Ling his monthly allowance as well as for some minor household expenses such as groceries, upfront express delivery fees and so on. Plus, there were times when Father Wang would find an excuse to dock Wang Ling's allowance, which led to a stockpile of cash that had yet to be used up.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling picked up the money from the table and put it in his pocket before he returned to his bedroom.</p>

    <p>Father Wang's study was opposite Wang Ling's bedroom. When he walked to the door, Wang Ling found a piece of paper on the ground. It must have been accidentally dropped by Father Wang when he left.</p>

    <p>There were all sorts of data analyses and charts on the sheet, and the heading was: Pregnancy Report.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling went through the report carefully.</p>

    <p>Name: Wang Youlan</p>

    <p>Age: 38</p>

    <p>Position of fetus: During the checkup, the fetus rolled around inside the body nonstop, and there is a small chance of it becoming entangled in the umbilical cord. It is recommended that a second examination be carried out next month to remove this risk.</p>

    <p>Physical state: In very good health. The pregnant woman gets the right amount of exercise and her body is healthy, and is thus in very good shape for birth. Since she previously gave birth naturally, the obstetrician also recommends natural childbirth this time.</p>

    <p>At the end of the report, Wang Ling saw that after Mother Wang's pregnancy checkup last night, the due date which the hospital had given was 30th December.</p>

    <p>This wasn't the 30th of December next year...</p>

    <p>But next month.</p>

    <p>This definitely wasn't the result of the hospital using some black tech to force the fetus to develop prematurely, but purely because nutrition in the cultivation world was too good.</p>

    <p>Mother Wang had been taking a lot of healthcare supplements these days to prevent miscarriage and to nourish the fetus; some she bought herself, while some were given to her by Zhuo Yi and Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>These tonics were panaceas which were priceless on the market. Eating all of these led to Mother Wang's due date being brought forward significantly.</p>

    <p>In addition...</p>

    <p>The little girl in her womb wasn't easy to handle to begin with.</p>

    <p>Even if Mother Wang didn't use these tonics, her due date would still have been brought forward by a fair bit.</p>

    <p>In a typical situation, substantially advanced pregnancies in the cultivation world were a very common phenomenon, but the point was that it was usually shorter by only three to five months.</p>

    <p>But this pregnancy was shortened by nine months, which shocked the hospital doctors who saw the due date in the report.</p>

    <p>The child was growing too fast, as if it could hardly wait to come into the world!</p>

    <p>It was like the opposite team's jungler still picking off the first batch of neutrals when your team's jungler had already eaten up all the neutrals on both sides to gain enough experience to directly jump up nine levels1.</p>

    <p>Reading the report, Wang Ling was suddenly curious about his birth.</p>

    <p>He saw in the report that Mother Wang had given birth naturally.</p>

    <p>In other words, his had been a natural birth back then.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling realized that his memory of it was a little fuzzy.</p>

    <p>He indeed had very early memories, but he only had a vague impression of his time in the womb.</p>

    <p>To be more precise, Wang Ling's memories only started when he took his first breath of fresh air.</p>

    <p>Curious, Wang Ling could hardly wait to see what he looked like when he was born back then.</p>

    <p>He went to the basement to search for the video which Father Wang had recorded with an image bead.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling remembered Father Wang saying before that he had made preparations long beforehand to record the entire birth in the operating room in order to preserve the moment.</p>

    <p>He searched the entire basement with his King's Eye and finally found the image bead which Father Wang had mentioned before.</p>

    <p>A year and time were engraved on it, which was the year and day that Wang Ling was born.</p>

    <p>After injecting spirit energy into the bead to activate it, Wang Ling very quickly saw Mother Wang's sweaty face and Father Wang's freely-running snot and tears...</p>

    <p>Father Wang back then had been really excited...</p>
