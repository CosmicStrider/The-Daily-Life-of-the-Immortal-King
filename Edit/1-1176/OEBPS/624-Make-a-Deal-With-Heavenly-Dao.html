  <h1>Chapter 624 Make a Deal With Heavenly Dao</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling remembered how he had suddenly seen the transmutation array for equivalent exchange in a dream, similar to how he gradually came to comprehend Heavenly Dao as he grew older. While very few Heavenly Dao had awakened inside Wang Ling's body when he was three years old, in front of the golden three-inch man, he hadn't felt the slightest bit of fear.</p>

    <p>If the golden three-inch man was the embodiment of the will of Heavenly Dao, then who on earth was Wang Ling?</p>

    <p>This was a question Wang Ling himself had pondered all this time over the years.</p>

    <p>Everything had a cause and effect; there had to be a reason why he could sit face to face like this with the embodiment of the will of Heavenly Dao and not feel the slightest bit of turmoil in his mood.</p>

    <p>But Er Ha and the gremlins he had enchanted were agitated, and even felt fear, which was the normal reaction.</p>

    <p>This was the will of the Three Thousand Great Spells given form, but even without giving off an aura as he just sat there, Wang Ling already demonstrated the greatest regality.</p>

    <p>Although the golden man was only three inches in height, he had energy as vast as the universe.</p>

    <p>He was gratified that after thirteen years, the young man in front of him had at long last gotten himself back on the right track.</p>

    <p>The passion stone was a very rare stone classified as a grade two stone natural resource, but it wasn't completely extinct yet. One of Wang Ling's handwritten "Three Five" test papers was ample sufficient trade for it.</p>

    <p>All natural resources could be categorized from grade one to grade ten.</p>

    <p>One handwritten paper from Wang Ling could be traded for an existing grade one resource at most, while an extinct resource would require a higher price.</p>

    <p>To sum up, the golden three-inch man had agreed to this transaction.</p>

    <p>He promptly stretched out his hand, and with a small glimmer of light, something that looked like brightly colored flowers blossomed in his small palm; they were hexagonal spirit stones that were grayish-blue in color, which were the very passion stones which Wang Ling wanted.</p>

    <p>Based on the value of those "Three Five" test papers, the golden three-inch man produced six stones in one go and gave them all to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Quietly observing this from behind, Er Ha felt that this equivalent exchange array was too convenient; furthermore, they had actually gotten six stones in the trade!</p>

    <p>Six?</p>

    <p>This was also beyond Wang Ling's expectations. This wasn't the first time he had done the "Three Five" test papers. Actually, he started doing them in middle school; they contained a lot of topics outside the school syllabus, and Wang Ling had learned them on his own to make it easier for him to do transactions with the Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's conservative estimate was that he could get three stones in the exchange, which was just enough to create the Three Values-Shattering Hammer. But now he had six stones, and he could make something else with the extra three stones.</p>

    <p>It was going to be Wang Ming's birthday soon, and just nice, Wang Ling could use these three passion stones to make permanent armor for him.</p>

    <p>"The handwritten papers you offered as sacrifice this time are elite and enhanced versions which are worth five passion stones," said the golden three-inch man.</p>

    <p>So upgrading the problems could upgrade their value!</p>

    <p>Realization dawned on Wang Ling; it was only today that he was finding out about this.</p>

    <p>"As for why you have six stones, the last one is a bonus." The golden three-inch man said indifferently, "After all, this is the first relatively normal transaction that you've made with me after all these years."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"By the way, you should know that this equivalent exchange transmutation array... can be used not just to exchange for resources, right?" the golden three-inch man said all of a sudden.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "???" He really didn't know!</p>

    <p>The golden three-inch man: "Apart from resources you want, you can actually do an equivalent exchange for all kinds of information. I already foresee a calamity in your life... This is a Heavenly Dao Great Calamity; even if you anticipate it, the chances of dispelling it are very low. But I can tell you how you can resolve it."</p>

    <p>"The price?" Wang Ling asked telepathically.</p>

    <p>"At your current stage... the most important thing in your life," the golden three-inch man said slowly.</p>

    <p>However, he didn't believe the young man would choose to make this exchange.</p>

    <p>The most important thing in life might vary from person to person, but it inevitably had to do with friends and family; no one would use a person's life in an exchange.</p>

    <p>But the principle of equivalent exchange had always been this unfeeling, and left no room for discussion.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "I'll look for you after several days then."</p>

    <p>The golden three-inch man: "???"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "The baked gluten-flavored crispy noodle snacks will only get here in a few days."</p>

    <p>The golden three-inch man: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the end, Wang Ling scared the golden three-inch man off; even the transmutation array on the floor disappeared completely without a trace...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling guessed that this guy was still living in the shadow of "crispy noodle snacks."</p>

    <p>But at his "current stage," Wang Ling felt that the most important thing in his life... was that box of baked-gluten flavored crispy noodle snacks which he had gotten custom made! He had squandered a precious opportunity and used his member privilege to get this flavor specially made to order! For one thing, he couldn't get it on the market, and for another, he had never tasted it before!</p>

    <p>How did the saying go?</p>

    <p>The rarer something was, the greater its value.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that this golden three-inch man knew nothing.</p>

    <p>But the Heavenly Dao Great Calamity which the golden three-inch man had mentioned just now had inevitably caught Wang Ling's attention. A Heavenly Dao Great Calamity that was going to happen soon... his expression twitched. Could it have something to do with the final exams?</p>

    <p>He really couldn't think of a more disastrous calamity than the final exams.</p>

    <p>But for Wang Ling, it was as if he was already used to it.</p>

    <p>Because since starting high school, every day felt like a calamity...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After the golden three-inch man disappeared, the feeling of a string that had been pulled taut in Er Ha's brain vanished.</p>

    <p>It didn't know what the Heavenly Dao had said to Little Master Ling, but it felt that his expression was a little heavy.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't think too much of it since the calamity had yet to happen. Furthermore, he didn't sense any sort of omen. It was enough to just keep it in mind; overthinking it wouldn't do any good.</p>

    <p>Currently, what was more important was to create this "Three Values-Shattering Hammer"!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling snapped his fingers, and the microwave on the first floor was instantly teleported to his room.</p>

    <p>Like with the previous operation, the first step was to smelt the material inside this enchanted microwave.</p>

    <p>He threw three passion stones inside, and the moment they completely melted into liquid, he opened the microwave. He used a spell to pull out the liquid from inside to float in the air, and it spun quickly to form a liquid ball. After that, the Great Weapon-Refining Spell was instantly activated.</p>

    <p>In a burst of bright light, a small black and gold hammer emerged in front of their eyes.</p>

    <p>This hammer's shape was very strange. It had a very large head, but the middle section of the head was completely flat. There also seemed to be a mechanism at the bottom of the hammer's head.</p>

    <p>Er Ha watched Wang Ling fiddle with the mechanism, and the flat section in the middle of the hammer's head unexpectedly flipped open.</p>

    <p>This thing was actually a flip-top!</p>
