  <h1>Chapter 917 Real Game</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Bai Qiao suddenly realized she was still too young; she thought she was someone who knew how the script went. However, she felt that Chen Chao was the true master, while she had only read the title page.</p>

    <p>When Guo Hao and Su Xiao came back to their senses, Chen Chao rehashed the current situation for them.</p>

    <p>Games were something which students were most willing to spend all their time, effort and even money on to transform their souls. Whether it was online games or single player games, it was always fun to be the first to play a new game.</p>

    <p>"The game's requirements are so high. We don't even get a 98K when we land, and we have to discover the plot ourselves?" Guo Hao patted his thigh. "This... is quite interesting!"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao analyzed the situation in front of them. "Currently, we don't know what the main plot is, we don't have any supplies, and we can't even understand the language used in the game. The game should let us choose the language at the very beginning of the story - if everything is in a foreign language, how can we clear the game?"</p>

    <p>"Language..." Su Xiao murmured to himself. "Then what should we do now?"</p>

    <p>"Let's head into the city and take a look around. Who knows, we might find the Easter eggs which Guo Hao's uncle hid in the game," said Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was startled. "Un... cle?"</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling, you don't play games much with us, so naturally you wouldn't know." Chen Chao laughed. "One of Guo Hao's uncles does the digital programming for games, and he will secretly plant eggs in all the games he works on - basically, all the games we play will have Easter eggs!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't really believe in mysticism, but he had experienced the authenticity of Chen Chao's "blessed" mouth for himself countless times already...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling retrieved the King's Eye after getting a rough idea of the planet's structure; there was only one city on this planet, and finding its governor would be easy since his profile image was projected conspicuously on practically every skyscraper.</p>

    <p>Contrary to Wang Ling's expectations, on this planet crawling with monsters, the governor unexpectedly had a human-like appearance (because they weren't sure whether the other party was actually human or not).</p>

    <p>"Hey, have you really decided on me as team leader?" Chen Chao's face was full of question marks.</p>

    <p>"That's right, it's you; don't turn it down." Fang Xing smiled.</p>

    <p>To be honest, this was a novel feeling for Fang Xing - he never thought there would actually be a day when he would feel a sense of reassurance from someone apart from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Given that Wang Ling could still use Heavenly Dao techniques as usual, it was easier to sneak into the city than they'd expected. Wang Ling used the Great Transfiguration Spell to change everyone's appearances to look like the monsters in the city.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao transformed into a muscular red giant with two formidable-looking devil king horns.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao transformed into a large, colorful rooster... Wang Ling had designed this form based on the Wrathful Rooster, since Wang Ling had been binge-watching the online TV drama <em>The Wrath of Time <sup>1</sup> </em>.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Refers to a particular scene in
the show "Candle in the Tomb:
The Wrath of Time ..)</dfn>

    <p>Su Xiao transformed into a bottle gourd person who was shaped like a peanut and carried two daggers on his back; naturally, these daggers were fake and couldn't be used.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing transformed a Vileplume; Wang Ling had seen it in a plant encyclopaedia, and it was a hermaphrodite.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's form was quite simple: he transformed into a raccoon.</p>

    <p>As for Bai Qiao, she didn't transform into anything; she made her legs disappear and turned into a ghost. This was the advantage of an artifact spirit; she could get rid of her legs anytime.</p>

    <p>When Number 60 High School's monster team entered the city, the monster team of lizard soldiers guarding the city didn't notice anything unusual about them.</p>

    <p>Because they spoke in a different language, Chen Chao observed the streets for a while before taking everyone to the entrance of a bar.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao didn't recognize the words, but he still recognized the alcohol bottles inside the bar.</p>

    <p>"In a free-roaming game like this, a plotline can usually be triggered in a cool location!" Chen Chao explained to everyone at the bar entrance.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing nodded. "Mm..."</p>

    <p>Naturally, he believed Chen Chao: if Chen Chao said yes, then it was so...</p>

    <p>Not knowing the language in a strange place, it seemed like they were at a deadend. When they entered the bar, the bartender at the counter turned out to also be a lizard.</p>

    <p>A lizard again?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Fang Xing exchanged looks.</p>

    <p>Although there were all kinds of monsters in this city, it was lizards that occupied the key positions in this city, like the lizard soldiers that guarded the city and the lizard troops that patrolled the streets.</p>

    <p>But they didn't carry any demon or devil aura on them, and were completely different from the lizards in the demon world.</p>

    <p><em>Jingle!</em></p>

    <p>The bell over the door of the bar rang.</p>

    <p>In an instant, all the monsters inside turned to look at Wang Ling and the others.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's protective spirit light dispersed to protect all of them. Although Chen Chao could still feel the spiritual pressure, Wang Ling shouldered most of it.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao and Guo Hao couldn't stop exclaiming in their hearts over how real the game felt. It even had a pressure sensor - this game was too amazing!</p>

    <p>Although they couldn't afford a virtual game pod, they still had some understanding of virtual pod games. They knew that there were only a few virtual game pod models sold on the market, and based on official specs, these models were still lacking in realism.</p>

    <p>But they could actually sense the spiritual pressure in this game... It was pretty awesome!</p>

    <p>"You're the NPC, right?" Chen Chao wasn't afraid at all as he straightaway marched over to the lizard bartender and pinched its nose.</p>

    <p>The lizard bartender scowled. "???"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "Whoa, damn! Guo Hao, look! This NPC actually has expressions! And it's actually angry? This game's algorithm is pretty amazing!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Fang Xing and Bai Qiao: "..."</p>

    <p>After that, Chen Chao grabbed an alcohol bottle which another monster was drinking, and smashed it over the lizard bartender's head.</p>

    <p>The lizard bartender flew into a rage and instantly turned red.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "Wow, what the hell! Everyone, look! This lizard bartender can actually get angry! The NPCs in this game are so real!"</p>

    <p>The lizard bartender broke out cursing. Although they couldn't understand a single word the other party was saying, the look of anger was the same everywhere in the universe â€” a thick gathering of qi in the dantian, spitting saliva, and a voice as loud as the firecrackers set off during the Chinese New Year.</p>

    <p>Seeing Chen Chao's frivolous appearance, the lizard bartender actually took out a gun right away and aimed it at him.</p>

    <p>"Hahaha! This lizard even took out a gun, but can it shoot me for real?" Laughing, Chen Chao reached out and directly wrestled the gun away from the lizard bartender.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Fang Xing and Bai Qiao: "..."</p>

    <p>After that, Chen Chao aimed the muzzle at the lizard bartender's head. "Just act like an NPC and go down - I'm even doing you the honor!"</p>

    <p><em>Peng!</em></p>

    <p>A laser beam shot out of the muzzle and pierced the lizard bartender's head.</p>

    <p>The lizard bartender dropped in a pool of blood.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao was startled yet again. "Holy shit! The blood in this game is actually red!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Fang Xing and Bai Qiao: "..."</p>
