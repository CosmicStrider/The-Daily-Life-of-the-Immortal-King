  <h1>Chapter 623 The Culprit is Heavenly Dao</h1>

  <div>

    <p>So there was this kind of operation...</p>

    <p>Er Ha stared blankly at the scene in front of it.</p>

    <p>For the most part, only Little Master Ling was able to use this type of magic array, since the transmutation array's principle of "equivalent exchange" was actually a transaction made with Heavenly Dao. But how many people in the world were qualified to negotiate directly with Heavenly Dao and make a deal?</p>

    <p>Even if a person knew how to draw the transmutation array and had an offering for the transaction, the Heavenly Dao might not necessarily respond.</p>

    <p>But Er Ha was a little baffled; since they could use a transmutation array, then why had they needed Lord Diulei to specially bring a magnetic stone the last time?</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Ling looked at Er Ha and very clearly heard its thoughts. He instantly said telepathically, "Because I hadn't finished doing the test papers back then."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Realization dawned on Er Ha.</p>

    <p>So that was it...</p>

    <p>It did understand this reasoning.</p>

    <p>But why was Wang Ling using these completed "Three Five" test papers to make a deal with Heavenly Dao?!</p>

    <p>Frankly speaking, Er Ha didn't think these "Three Five" test papers were an equivalent exchange for the invaluable "passion stone"- one passion stone was priceless, and worth so much more than the "Three Five" test papers sold in cultivation education bookstores everywhere.</p>

    <p>Could one set of "Three Five" test papers buy a 150- <em>ping <sup>1</sup> </em>house in the city's second ring? Of course not... but a passion stone could!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(One ping is roughly 35.6 sq feet.)</dfn>

    <p>With five of them, you could even buy a four- <em>ping </em>toilet in the first ring.</p>

    <p>This, was the difference!</p>

    <p>But in the end, Er Ha underestimated the value of these "Three Five" test papers.</p>

    <p>Not long after these test papers were thrown into the array, Er Ha saw them turn into golden light particles which disappeared into thin air. The Heavenly Dao had actually accepted them...</p>

    <p>After a short moment, the center of the transmutation array glimmered with light, and a little three-inch man glowing with light floated into existence.</p>

    <p>"You are..." Gaze fixed on the little man, Er Ha was extremely amazed, and felt like someone was pulling hard at its heart.</p>

    <p>Er Ha had a vague answer in its mind, but it didn't dare believe it at all and didn't even dare speak.</p>

    <p>The three-inch man didn't speak, but a voice rang out in Er Ha's mind. "I am Heaven, I am Dao, I am god, I am also the world..." There was neither sorrow nor joy in this tone, but a supreme dignity which made all of Er Ha's green fur stand on end.</p>

    <p>The tiny man wasn't doing it deliberately, but his power caused one to feel fear in the depths of their soul.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised an eyebrow, then crouched down to gently stroke Er Ha, who promptly felt its anxiety disappear as its breathing gradually settled.</p>

    <p>Er Ha actually hadn't dared confirm it earlier, but after what the golden three-inch man said, it was already certain of the answer in its heart - this golden three-inch man was none other than the embodiment of the will of the Three Thousand Great Spells!</p>

    <p>Also known as the embodiment of the will of Heavenly Dao!</p>

    <p>That nerve-wracking power just now was still vivid in Er Ha's mind. Since it had the power of Sword Dao in its body, it was highly sensitive to Heavenly Dao. And reality proved that it wasn't just Er Ha that was affected; it noticed that in Little Master Ling's room, the two gremlins Pen and Eraser on the table, Pillow Immortal on the bed, and Lord Ma in the toilet were all trembling slightly at the same time.</p>

    <p>Er Ha was well aware that all the gremlins enchanted by Little Master Ling had Heavenly Dao in their bodies, so their reactions weren't strange.</p>

    <p>After calming Er Ha down, Wang Ling softly patted Er Ha's butt and had it move to one side to allow Wang Ling to sit down cross-legged across from the golden three-inch man.</p>

    <p>It was an especially mystical scene that didn't seem real.</p>

    <p>There wasn't the slightest change in Wang Ling's expression and he didn't give anything away even in the face of the golden three-inch man.</p>

    <p>Who could endure the massive spiritual pressure of encountering Heavenly Dao face to face?</p>

    <p>Er Ha exclaimed admiringly in its heart; for the most part, only Little Master Ling could do so.</p>

    <p>This was actually a truly stunning scene. For those in particular who had grasped one or more Heavenly Dao, they would be sensitive enough to Heavenly Dao that the pressure or shock would be exacerbated for them.</p>

    <p>Er Ha initially wanted to take a photo of this scene with its phone to show Xiao Yin how powerful their owner was, but Er Ha was depressed when it realized that its phone didn't have a signal and that it also couldn't go online!</p>

    <p>This embodiment of Heavenly Dao as a golden three-inch man probably had the ability to disrupt web connections.</p>

    <p>Face to face, neither Wang Ling nor the golden three-inch man said anything, but they entered a small-scale Heavenly Dao field to talk.</p>

    <p>This field differed from the Mind-Reading Ability, which was the ability to perceive the other party's thoughts and which could also be used in telepathic communication. In contrast, it was absolutely safe to talk in this small-scale Heavenly Dao field since even the Mind-Reading Ability couldn't be used to find out what the people inside were talking about.</p>

    <p>Er Ha also discovered that the Internet wasn't working on its phone, the main reason being that it had been affected by the Heavenly Dao field.</p>

    <p>The truth was that this wasn't the golden three-inch man and Wang Ling's first transaction, and they were already very familiar with each other.</p>

    <p>Several dozen seconds later, the golden three-inch man spread his hands, and the "Three Five" test papers which Wang Ling had offered up as a sacrifice earlier floated in his hands.</p>

    <p>"These papers full of handwritten Heavenly Dao already meet the requirement."</p>

    <p>He looked at Wang Ling and asked, "What... crispy noodle snack flavor do you want to change them for?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had drawn the transmutation array several times before in the past to trade for crispy noodle snacks. The golden three-inch man already seemed very familiar with this youngster's nature.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling said telepathically, "I want the passion stone."</p>

    <p>The golden three-inch man was blank; he felt that this youngster's taste was a little heavy. "You want... passion stone-flavored crispy noodle snacks?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "... Just the passion stone."</p>

    <p>Realization dawned on the golden three-inch man and at the same time he was a little excited. After so many years, this youngster had at long last learned to do an exchange for something different...</p>

    <p>Actually, when all was said and done, the golden three-inch man felt that he was actually to blame.</p>

    <p>He recalled when this youngster in front of him had been a child...</p>

    <p>That had been about thirteen years ago...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>That day, three-year-old Wang Ling had drawn the transmutation array.</p>

    <p>The golden three-inch man had shown up, and when he had seen the oil painting which kid Wang Ling had painted, he had been utterly shaken.</p>

    <p>He had then cheated Wang Ling out of his oil painting with a crispy noodle snack.</p>

    <p>Just like that, three-year-old Wang Ling ate a crispy noodle snack for the first time in his life...</p>

    <p>And then, that was it...</p>

    <p>After that, Wang Ling would look for him every now and then to do a trade.</p>

    <p>Back then, if he hadn't deliberately led this youngster to that crispy noodle snack flagship store, he was afraid he would have been continually "harassed" until now.</p>

    <p>Fear still lingered in his heart when the golden three-inch man thought about this.</p>

    <p>He had to admit that he was the culprit.</p>

    <p>But fortunately, no one else seemed to know about it.</p>
