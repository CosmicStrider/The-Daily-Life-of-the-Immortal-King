  <h1>Chapter 802 Wang Zhen's Tragic Childhood</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Sky Light Alliance? Senior Immortal, are you saying that you received an email from this Alliance?"</p>

    <p>In the chat group, Lord Diulei shared a screenshot of an email with everyone. This email was from Sky Light Alliance, which more or less meant that the Alliance was hoping that the General Office of Strategic Deception would join it. It was also indicated in the email that if they were willing to join, Lord Diulei would be given the position of deputy head of the Sky Light Alliance.</p>

    <p>"What do you think?" Lord Diulei asked.</p>

    <p>"Clearly, they want us to be part of their faction." Lightning Dharmaraja said, "I've long heard about this Alliance. Currently, it has seventeen Sky-level sects at fifth class and above. During the annual sect evaluation, these seventeen sects help each other maintain their ranking, preventing the sects behind them from advancing. If they want to advance, they have to pay a protection fee and agree to join the Alliance. Our sect has just been founded, and we're already at Sky-level third class. This was probably beyond their expectations."</p>

    <p>"Does anyone have any complaints?"</p>

    <p>"What the Alliance is doing isn't a crime, strictly speaking. It's just that the way they go about offering protection is a little shameless... but Huaxiu Alliance can't do anything to directly control it. There are countless ways that sects compete with each other in business, this is too common!" Dharmaraja shook his head. "Moreover, these are all Sky-level sects. To be able to reach fifth class and above, they naturally have strong foundations which cannot be easily shaken."</p>

    <p>"Clearly, this is a feeler." Cailian Zhenren sent a sigh emoji. "If we don't agree, then these seventeen sects will undoubtedly join hands to crowd us out, which will be very detrimental for the future development of our sect! Senior Immortal, you have to be careful."</p>

    <p>"Mm, of course. I just checked, and basically, I can find acquaintances in the three sects who aren't part of the Alliance. If our four non-Alliance sects join hands, the situation may be very different." Speaking up to this point, Lord Diulei smiled slightly.</p>

    <p>To panic was to mess up.</p>

    <p>So there was no way he would panic.</p>

    <p>After all, they still had Wang Ling, this massive trump card!</p>

    <p>"By the way, I'm very curious: why is Ling Zhenren's new Daoist name Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch... It can't be as simple as being about crispy noodle snacks, can it?" Dharmaraja suddenly asked in the group at that moment.</p>

    <p>This was something everyone wanted to know.</p>

    <p>As an expert, how high was Ling Zhenren's realm?</p>

    <p>In their eyes, his existence was like that of an immortal living fossil...</p>

    <p>How could he come up with such a seemingly meaningless name?</p>

    <p>There had to be some profound meaning behind it!</p>

    <p>"Oh, about that, Brother Ling explained it to me before. Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch is a pun," Lord Diulei said. "It doesn't just refer to crispy noodle snacks, it's also a verb, and means the crisp sound of being slapped in the face <sup>1</sup> ."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Crispy noodles is "cui mian" in
Chinese, "mian" being a
homonym for "face.")</dfn>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>What damn "crisp"!</p>

    <p>As expected, Huaxiu's culture was extensive and profound!</p>

    <p>When all was said and done, basically no one in the group had deeply experienced what it was like to be slapped by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But there were actually some risks with this Daoist name; if Songhai First Prison's Mahjong Squad heard this Daoist name, who knew if they could guess that it was Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Thus, Wang Ling had also previously suggested a very foreign-sounding alternate Daoist name to Lord Diulei: Crispy C. Dao Monarch.</p>

    <p>This Daoist name was in the same style as Monkey D. Luffy <sup>2</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(The protagonist of the series "One Piece..")</dfn>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was the second day after Wang Zhen had been sent to Immortal Toya's Chrysanthemum Island.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen was also the second patient to be treated by Immortal Toya on the island in recent months. The first was the girl from the kun's belly, but after a long period of treatment to wake her up, the girl only switched from a deep coma to a shallow one. After lightly stimulating her skin, her fingers were already showing signs of movement.</p>

    <p>" <em>Shifu </em>, <em>shifu </em>, when will she wake up?"</p>

    <p>Because Immortal Toya had to take care of Wang Zhen, he had gotten Jin Shi and Yin Shi to be responsible for looking after the girl since last night.</p>

    <p>Golden needle acupuncture was a profound area of knowledge, and usually they weren't able to find a suitable target to practice on.</p>

    <p>Just nice, there was a vegetative person lying here...</p>

    <p>The two siblings, Jin Shi and Yin Shi, were usually very careful, but even if they stuck the acupuncture needles in the wrong place, it didn't matter.</p>

    <p>Where else could they find such a suitable opportunity for practice?</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya let out a long breath. "This girl's condition is more serious than I thought. If she doesn't wake up soon... then we can only wait for her to wake up after the end of <em>The Daily Life of the Immortal King </em>. That is, when Ling Zhenren finishes his Grade Three senior year..."</p>

    <p>Jin Shi and Yin Shi: "..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "This neglectful writer wrote eight hundred chapters which only cover one semester. There are five semesters to go until Ling Zhenren graduates, so that's still another four thousand chapters... If she doesn't wake up, I'm afraid she won't wake up in this lifetime!"</p>

    <p>Jin Shi and Yin Shi: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At this point, Wang Zhen's eyelids fluttered as he lay in a bed across from the kun belly girl and he started to mumble nonsense.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen was dreaming...</p>

    <p>His dreams were fragmented, and were a series of scenes from memories of his childhood.</p>

    <p>In his dream, he returned to the moment of his birth, and he dreamt of his parents' joyful expressions as they crowded around him.</p>

    <p>"Our Zhenzhen is a divine genius! He's already mastered a hundred Great Dao right after birth!" The woman in the dream held him tenderly and smiled gently at him.</p>

    <p>"Our Wang family's blood runs through Zhenzhen's veins; it goes without saying that he's gifted. Among the younger generation of the Wang family, this is the person who has the best hope of rivaling the Gu family... Gu Yanzhi that old man also has a son who was born not long ago, but the boy only has fifty Heavenly Dao. In the end, he's still no match for my Wang family's blood..."</p>

    <p>After that, Wang Zhen saw the man hold him aloft. "Look at how sturdy our son is! He only just came out, but has already comprehended a hundred Heavenly Dao. It shouldn't be long before he awakens his spiritual intelligence, and learns to talk and walk right away."</p>

    <p>"The best would be to use medicine to help along the awakening of his spiritual intelligence. It'll be gentler." The woman smiled.</p>

    <p>"No, no, no!"</p>

    <p>The man waved his hand. "Our Wang family's blood runs through Zhenzhen's veins. Blood is the best tonic! Medical supplements will cause him to become dependent on them; I believe that Zhenzhen can awaken himself! But to help his awakening along, it's better for us to give physical assistance!"</p>

    <p>"Physical assistance?"</p>

    <p>"That's right!"</p>

    <p>The man nodded.</p>

    <p>Then, in the next moment, he directly threw Wang Zhen onto the ground under the woman's stupefied gaze.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen bawled.</p>

    <p>The man stomped on Wang Zhen's head. "Honey! Look! What an iron head our son has! Hurry up and help so that we can stimulate him together! He'll awaken very soon! '</p>

    <p>Woman: "Is... this alright..."</p>

    <p>Man: "Trust me! This is the right way!"</p>

    <p>Under the combined beating from his parents, Wang Zhen, who had been bawling on the ground, finally exploded with a powerful and resounding protest. "Devils! Stop it!!!"</p>

    <p>The man picked up the newly born and badly battered Wang Zhen from the ground and laughed. "Look! Zhenzhen has awakened!!!"</p>
