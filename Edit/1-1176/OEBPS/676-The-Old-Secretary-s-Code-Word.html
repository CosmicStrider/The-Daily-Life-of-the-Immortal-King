  <h1>Chapter 676 The Old Secretary's Code Word</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Zhuo Yi didn't have the courage to continue this line of thinking - it was too dirty!</p>

    <p>How could men call each other that! Gay!</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi's face inexplicably flushed red. Seeing this scene, Warden Liang couldn't help glancing at the cooling talisman in the office. To be environmentally friendly, they didn't use air conditioning, but directly used talismans to lower the temperature. The talisman was clearly working as usual at that moment, as it gave off a light blue talisman light from where it was stuck on the wall.</p>

    <p>One cooling talisman could last for seventy-two hours straight.</p>

    <p>Warden Liang scratched the back of his head. Since it wasn't like this office didn't use a cooling talisman, why was Director Zhuo's face suddenly so red?</p>

    <p>"What are you thinking about, Old Zhuo?"</p>

    <p>Warden Liang looked at him strangely and snapped his fingers in front of Zhuo Yi. Zhuo Yi came back to his senses and looked at Warden Liang. "... Well, what does Elder Yaren call Elder Ji Xing?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, is that what you were thinking about?"</p>

    <p>Warden Liang chuckled. "Elder Ji Xing calls him Little Yaya, so of course, Elder Yaren calls him Little Xingxing!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi lowered his head in shame. "..."</p>

    <p>Sure enough, he was the one who had a dirty mind!</p>

    <p>"There was plenty of information in this Elder Yaren's communication device, though a lot of the data was encrypted and we're decoding it now... But the information we have analyzed so far is already very plentiful."</p>

    <p>Warden Liang took a sip of tea and gave Zhuo Yi all the information that he currently had. "According to our data, for the Demon Hunters Association's master plan tomorrow, there are a total of fifteen returnee cultivators from Sun Island who have studied ninjutsu that will be participating in the operation."</p>

    <p>"Fif... fifteen?" Zhuo Yi raised his eyebrows. This group was courting death with this plan!</p>

    <p>For some reason, Zhuo Yi suddenly felt inexplicably worried about the futures of these fifteen people...</p>

    <p>Actually, from the moment he had heard about this so-called Demon Hunters Association's revenge plan, Zhuo Yi hadn't thought anything about it at all.</p>

    <p>Because he was well aware that his <em>shifu </em>was at Number 60 High, so the school couldn't be any safer! There was no safer place than Number 60 High in the world...</p>

    <p>While there was all kinds of scaremongering happening outside, some of which were even aimed at him, Zhuo Yi didn't care at all.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi hadn't been worried about Number 60 High's security issue from the very start... On the contrary, it was Lord Diulei and the others who had run into the Demon Hunters Association before that Zhuo Yi was worried about.</p>

    <p>"Also, Old Zhuo, of the fifteen people, that Elder Ji Xing is the head of the whole affair this time. The other side came fully prepared. Although the reason I asked you to come was to share the information we've learned so far, I actually also wanted to tell you..."</p>

    <p>Warden Liang paused before he said, "I suggest that you stay away from the Internet for now. I've seen all the online comments."</p>

    <p>"Scolded very badly?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi smiled.</p>

    <p>Actually, he didn't believe that it was Number 60 High's parents who were flaming him online. He felt it was more likely an water army hired by some local fellow organization; it was quite normal for there to be competition in the workplace.</p>

    <p>Tall trees attracted the wind; his star had been on the rise in the last few months, which had definitely attracted a lot of envy. Now that this thing had happened, it wasn't strange at all that he had become the target of criticism.</p>

    <p>"What does the old secretary think about it?" Zhuo Yi asked suddenly.</p>

    <p>Instead, he was more concerned about Secretary Dakang's opinion. Secretary Dakang had been busy during this time planning the summer camp for various Songhai schools in Beast King's Remains. The Demon Hunters Association's revenge plan had only come to light in recent days, and Zhuo Yi had yet to give a report of the situation to Secretary Dakang.</p>

    <p>"What other opinion can the old secretary have? Of course he defers to the people! He said he won't be tolerant with you, even if you're his man!"</p>

    <p>Warden Liang then sipped the tea. "So delicious <sup>1</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The term 真香 has become a
way to mock someone for
doing an about face on a
statement they made
previously.)</dfn>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>"You're in such a high position at your age; once something happens, someone is bound to attack you. He was the one who promoted you back then, and now you've disgraced him! He said you definitely have to be punished!"</p>

    <p>Then Warden Liang sipped his tea again. "So delicious!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi smiled wryly, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. Everyone knew Secretary Dakang's huge propensity to shield others, especially if it was one of his own.</p>

    <p>When Evil Sword God was arrested back then, General Yi had persisted in wanting to talk to Zhuo Yi. If the old secretary hadn't obstructed him at that time, Zhuo Yi was well aware that given General Yi's methods, the latter would have very likely quickly discovered his <em>shifu </em>.</p>

    <p>Warden Liang had invited him over this time ostensibly to share information with him. But Zhuo Yi actually knew very well that Warden Liang was passing on the old secretary's opinion.</p>

    <p>Now that Zhuo Yi was in the eye of the storm, it made sense for the old secretary to decide not to contact him directly for the time being in order to avoid arousing suspicion.</p>

    <p>Although Warden Liang was the messenger, he was also very shrewd. He couldn't convey the old secretary's direct meaning outright, otherwise anyone who heard it would definitely turn it into gossip fodder.</p>

    <p>This was purely a sharing of information, plus some passing "small talk" through which he conveyed the old secretary's message...</p>

    <p>The secretary, who was pouring tea next to them, appeared calm and at ease, but there were a few drops of cold sweat on his cheeks. His lips twitched: <em>Can the two of you be any more obvious?</em></p>

    <p>Both Zhuo Yi and Warden Liang weren't stupid. Zhuo Yi had already seen the flicker in Warden Liang's eyes when he had entered the office... It had been very obvious that the latter had wanted to tell him something.</p>

    <p>"What else did he say..."</p>

    <p>"As for the outside comments, the old secretary didn't issue any sort of statement. He's decided to let it run its course. Even if you ultimately fall from the top, it has nothing to do with him at all."</p>

    <p>Warden Liang went on drinking tea. "So delicious!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>Warden Liang: "Oh, that's right, apart from this, the old secretary also hopes that you'll deal with this matter slowly. The slower the better - or just don't deal with it... Wait till you die."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi nodded, and also lifted the cup in his hand to take a sip of the tea. "Mm... This tea is so delicious."</p>

    <p>The secretary: "..."</p>

    <p>When they came out of Songhai First Prison, Warden Liang saw Zhuo Yi off. "Don't forget to come back later for a taste of my sweet potato wine." As Songhai First Prison's representative in strategic collaboration, Warden Liang could afford the wine. This eight-hundred-year-old sweet potato wine wasn't something ordinary people could drink. This was a precious brew from his hometown, and he had haggled over the price with his fellow townsmen for a long time before he was able to buy it.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Alright."</p>

    <p>Warden Liang leaned his elbows on the car window. "Oh, that's right, Old Zhuo, do you know what nickname the outside world has now given you?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "What?"</p>

    <p>Warden Liang: "Everyone online is saying that it seems wherever you go, something always happens... so now they're calling you anti-Android <sup>2</sup> ."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(The Chinese word for the
Android OS is "an zhuo,"
which uses the same "zhuo"
character in Zhuo Yi's
name ..)</dfn>
