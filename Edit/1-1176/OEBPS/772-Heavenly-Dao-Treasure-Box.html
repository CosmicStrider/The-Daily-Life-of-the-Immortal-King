  <h1>Chapter 772 Heavenly Dao Treasure Box</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Beast King's palm was undoubtedly strong, but this was just a feeler. Zhuo Yi stood alone at the very front as he struggled to withstand the powerful pressure created by the palm falling.</p>

    <p>The outcome was unsurprising.</p>

    <p>As Beast King's palm approached Zhuo Yi, the long johns the latter was wearing flashed gold and knocked Beast King's palm away.</p>

    <p>Beast King frowned and gazed at his palm.</p>

    <p>It tingled with pain from the golden light, and was like the pain of smearing chili oil over your palm: it wasn't sharp, but it was persistent, like a warning to him not to try and get any closer.</p>

    <p>There was no mistake...</p>

    <p>This was the aura of Heavenly Dao...</p>

    <p>Beast King narrowed his eyes. He didn't make another move, but fixed his deep gaze on Zhuo Yi. "Who are all of you?" At the same time, he also noticed Xiao Yin in the crowd. Although Xiao Yin was still in his human form, Beast King was confident that he wasn't mistaken about the rich scent of holy beast blood on him.</p>

    <p>There was actually still a holy beast alive...</p>

    <p>The expression on Devil King's face wavered; there was no way to tell if it was grief or joy.</p>

    <p>"We apologize for disrupting Your Majesty Beast King's game, but our reason for coming here is to have a chat with Your Majesty," Wang Ming said.</p>

    <p>"There's nothing to talk about. If there's nothing else, leave me alone and don't bother me when I'm playing." Devil King straight up refused.</p>

    <p>"It appears that Your Majesty Beast King is worried about something," Wang Ming continued.</p>

    <p>Devil King turned his face to Wang Ming and raised his eyelids with great interest.</p>

    <p>He could see that this was only a human being who didn't have the least bit of spirit energy on him, but he had been able to accurately guess Devil King's thoughts.</p>

    <p>"Can you read minds?" Devil King was skeptical.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming smiled. "Of course."</p>

    <p>In his heart, though, he was thinking that this was simply nonsense. Infiltrating Beast King's game world was the same as invading his consciousness, which was why Wang Ming was able to explore some of Beast King's surface memories.</p>

    <p>After the holy beasts were wiped out, Devil King had gone into seclusion for a thousand years, and had no idea that cultivation and science in the outside world could be combined and expanded to such a marvelous and profound extent.</p>

    <p>But this was also Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>A scientific cultivation magic artifact created by an ordinary person would not necessarily have the same functional effect as Wang Ming's.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming had piqued Devil King's interest, and the latter seemed a little more patient now. "Then, what do you want to know?"</p>

    <p>"Your Majesty Beast King is very clear on exactly what we want to know."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming quickly responded, "From Your Majesty Beast King's expression, you should already be aware that there is a living holy beast in our ranks. Don't you want to say something?"</p>

    <p>"I really had no idea that a holy beast was actually overlooked, and had survived that disaster back then. I remember that the Silver Unicorn clan was the last one to be wiped out; to think it actually still has a descendant. At long last, there is someone to light incense at the graves of the Silver Unicorn clan this year."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>But after mentioning what happened back then, Devil King's expression turned a little pained. "I know you want to ask exactly why the holy beasts were annihilated at the time. But no matter who instigated it, there was no way to stop it - our holy beast race was doomed to face such a catastrophe."</p>

    <p>Sure enough, things weren't that simple.</p>

    <p>When they heard this, everyone present turned the matter over in their minds.</p>

    <p>In the outside world, the official conclusion at present was that it was President Bai who had spread the rumor back then which claimed that the blood and heart of a holy beast had a strong nourishing effect that could help cultivators comprehend the power of Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>And so, the holy beasts were hunted down on a large scale.</p>

    <p>President Bai also took advantage of the chaos to realize his own purpose, which was to create the powerful spatial magic artifact "Wuji Umbrella."</p>

    <p>From Devil King's tone, it seemed that he had long known that the holy beast race would be wiped out, but perhaps for some reason, he wasn't able to do anything to stop it.</p>

    <p>So he shut himself away inside the game.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming suspected that Qin Lang only knew a little about this.</p>

    <p>Devil King had shut himself inside the game for another reason that wasn't purely self-isolation or as an escape from reality.</p>

    <p>"You can't fight fate. Defying Heavenly Dao never ends well." After a long while, Devil King let out a long sigh.</p>

    <p>"All this time, Your Majesty Beast King has been trying to solve this on your own. If you share your burden with us, who's to say that things will still end badly?" Wang Ming consoled him.</p>

    <p><em>You can't fight fate. Defying Heavenly Dao never ends well...</em></p>

    <p>Wang Ling had told Wang Ming about Heavenly Dao very early on.</p>

    <p>Although he had never truly encountered Heavenly Dao, what Wang Ming knew about it was in fact no less than a real cultivator.</p>

    <p>It was true that Heavenly Dao was formidable.</p>

    <p>But...</p>

    <p>He had Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>Devil King glanced at Wang Ming, then turned his Holy King Eye to the sky. A crack unexpectedly appeared out of nowhere, and a small, colorful glass box slowly emerged from the crack.</p>

    <p>"This is?" Wang Ming frowned.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling One was telling him that this box was very dangerous!</p>

    <p>"Heavenly Dao Treasure Box."</p>

    <p>Devil King said, "Back then, the senior Almighty who gave me this box was the one who told me that the holy beasts would inevitably become extinct."</p>

    <p>"Someone came looking for Your Majesty Beast King?"</p>

    <p>"That's right." Devil King nodded. "That senior is very strong... his power is in a completely different dimension."</p>

    <p>Everyone present was blank at these words.</p>

    <p>Not in the same dimension...</p>

    <p>Currently, the strongest realm in the outside world was level nine True Immortal.</p>

    <p>And above that was the Venerated Immortal level.</p>

    <p>Beast King's strength was on par with a Venerated Immortal's...</p>

    <p>If the person who had given Beast King the Heavenly Dao Treasure Box had an even higher level of strength... It seemed that he was indeed an expert!</p>

    <p>Looking at the reactions in Wang Ming's group, Devil King was slightly lost for words.</p>

    <p>This group was clearly peanuts in terms of strength, so why were they completely unperturbed by his declaration?</p>

    <p>That was a super strong expert who far surpassed a Venerated Immortal!</p>

    <p>"I said this person's strength is in a different dimension altogether, and you're not shocked?" Devil King was really startled this time. Had he run into a bunch of idiots?</p>

    <p>"Oh..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming and the others nodded very cooperatively, but the expressions on their faces were still unruffled. "If it really is as Your Majesty Beast King says, then that really is very shocking! How terrifying!"</p>

    <p>Devil King: "..."</p>

    <p>After all, everyone here had seen Wang Ling's might for themselves.</p>

    <p>So when Devil King told them about the Almighty, they were as calm as usual...</p>

    <p>Devil King rubbed his head and felt it ache a little. "Back then, that senior told me that the extinction of the holy beasts was inevitable and couldn't be changed; the only thing I could do was revive them. He gave me this Heavenly Dao Treasure Box and told me that as long as I could unlock its secret, it would still be possible to revive the holy beast race after it was wiped out. I've been in this game all these years, trying to find the password to unlock the treasure box based on what I know of that senior."</p>

    <p>"It can't be broken by force?" Wang Ming asked.</p>
