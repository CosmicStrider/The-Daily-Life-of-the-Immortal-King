  <h1>Chapter 1144 Li Modi's Mine Technique</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The Old Devil had committed so many crimes largely because he wanted to find his wife, Maiya. Asking him to recall the moment they parted for eternity was no doubt rubbing salt into the wound, but General Bai had a faint feeling in his gut.</p>

    <p>He had a feeling that the matter of the Old Devil and his wife might have something to do with Zaomen Rokuro.</p>

    <p>"My wife Maiya and I grew up together. She was a member of the peacekeeping force," the Old Devil said.</p>

    <p>A female peacekeeper?</p>

    <p>General Bai never expected the Old Devil's wife to have such an identity. Female peacekeepers were rare to begin with. Peacekeeping abroad was somewhat more complicated and fraught with danger. Although there were female peacekeepers, the gender ratio was limited, and most female peacekeepers did medical aid work.</p>

    <p>This absolutely wasn't discrimination. It was just that the work was different. The main thing was that organizations were still protective of women. Peacekeeping was very dangerous work, and if it wasn't because women had strong wills, organizations usually wouldn't specially set up female peacekeeping troops.</p>

    <p>After all, charging and breaking through enemy lines was still left to the hot-blooded, rough and tumble men.</p>

    <p>General Bai had never heard the Old Devil speak about his wife before. Hearing now about her identity as a peacekeeper, he was a little amazed. There were so many of them, however, and General Bai couldn't remember them all.</p>

    <p>"Was her codename Maiya?" General Bai asked.</p>

    <p>"No, her peacekeeper codename was Moon," the Old Devil said.</p>

    <p>General Bai was astonished. "It was her?"</p>

    <p>Moon was a famous peacekeeper general from more than a thousand years ago who had been missing ever since they lost contact with her during an operation. It wasn't until five hundred years ago that Huaxiu Alliance officially verified her death.</p>

    <p>It was said that a foreign peacekeeping force discovered a finger bone which DNA tests confirmed belonged to Miss Maiya. But it had been in a very strange place; it was discovered in an abandoned Daoist temple.</p>

    <p>Because it had been too long ago, no one knew what happened... What everyone did know was that five muddy footprints had been found inside the temple.</p>

    <p>Someone had struck a killing blow when Miss Maiya had been on the verge of death.</p>

    <p>This was the analysis the experts came up with after they investigated the scene.</p>

    <p>In short, this case caused a sensation back then, but it was so long ago that almost all traces at the scene had been swept away with the passage of time.</p>

    <p>Of course, the biggest mystery in this case was where the rest of Miss Maiya's bones were, since only a finger bone had been found in the Daoist temple.</p>

    <p>"The finger bone remains an unsolved peacekeeping case. Unfortunately, given how much time had passed, no one knows exactly what happened." General Bai sighed. "I remember Moon... oh, no, it's Miss Maiya. She was the captain of Peacekeeping Team Six. Her performance was outstanding, and she won many battles. This case caused quite a stir. I once sent out three squads and no less than a hundred people to investigate the incident, but we didn't find anything."</p>

    <p>"This matter is indeed odd. I don't blame you, general." The Old Devil sighed. "My venerable self has been searching for my wife's whereabouts all this time, but I still haven't found anything so far."</p>

    <p>"There will be a breakthrough one day." Countless thoughts flashed through General Bai's mind. He had never expected the Old Devil to actually be Moon's boyfriend.</p>

    <p>This devotion was indeed touching. However, a crime was a crime. The Old Devil would still need to continue on this path of redemption. Sympathy wouldn't get him a reduced punishment; that would be showing contempt for the laws of the cultivation world.</p>

    <p>General Bai kept this thought in mind. That incident back then was also a thorn in his flesh; he, too, was looking forward to the day when the thorn could be removed.</p>

    <p>He composed himself and the meeting continued. General Bai turned his eyes to the Master of Immortal Mansion and Evil Sword God on the other side, who were also lost in thought.</p>

    <p>"Does anyone here look familiar to you?"</p>

    <p>"This one," the Master of Immortal Mansion said as he pointed to a dark-skinned young man with a very distinctive hairstyle.</p>

    <p>This guy had an afro.</p>

    <p>"Li Modi." General Bai tapped on the man's profile and read up on the young afro man's background.</p>

    <p>This was a Dark Network expert who died three hundred years ago. Back then, he had been given the nickname Explosion Demon Li Modi. His "Mine Technique" was very troublesome and astonishing. Anything he touched would become a bomb, and would explode at the slightest jostle. Li Modi could be said to be unbeatable in those days because it was impossible to tell if he had touched something before... As for his death, it had been completely unexpected.</p>

    <p>"Is Li Modi dead, too?" the Old Devil asked.</p>

    <p>"Indeed he is, and as for the cause of his death... Look for yourselves." General Bai clicked open the file.</p>

    <p><em>Li Modi (cause of death): Suffered from dementia in his later years, and forgot that the things he touched had turned into bombs. Died after accidentally detonating bombs he had buried.</em></p>

    <p>He actually forgot...</p>

    <p>The Old Devil, the Master of Immortal Mansion and Evil Sword God were all lost for words at this cause of death.</p>

    <p>But the point Evil Sword God focused on was even stranger. "Cultivators can also suffer dementia?"</p>

    <p>"There is now medicine to treat dementia, but Li Modi... back then, he was wanted all over the world and was on the run all the time, so he missed the best medical window to be treated. Also, he liked being on his own, so he didn't have anyone with him. When his illness flared up, not only did he forget the bombs he had set, he even forgot to take his medicine."</p>

    <p>The Master of Immortal Mansion said, "I once fought him in my intrinsic spirit field; he turned my swords into bombs, and blew up several of my beloved spirit swords!"</p>

    <p>General Bai also noted this down. "If he has been resurrected, he will indeed be difficult to deal with."</p>

    <p>No one knew more about explosions than he did, as Explosion Saint.</p>

    <p>He was world-famous for his mastery with explosions. This Mine Technique was in fact a technique which General Bai had developed back then. However, it was too lethal and dangerous, and General Bai had destroyed his design.</p>

    <p>Even General Bai himself never expected that Li Modi would actually use a technique he designed...</p>

    <p>Of course, General Bai didn't rule out the possibility that Li Modi had developed the Mine Technique on his own. Once you grasped the basics, all spells and techniques in the world were the same. Li Modi was also an explosion expert, so it wasn't that surprising that he could come up with the theory behind the Mine Technique.</p>

    <p>"It's your turn." After General Bai wrote down Li Modi's name, he turned his eyes to Evil Sword God.</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God pointed to a young man with an unusual shamate hairstyle. "This guy looks familiar. I think I've fought him before. He also wears eye shadow."</p>

    <p>General Bai took a deep breath. "Of course he looks familiar... Because he's you..."</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God, with his eye shadow on, was also one of the Dark Network's Red 3S-Class wanted criminals...</p>

    <p>But when a foreign cultivation peacekeeping force caught an expert swordsman who similarly wore eye shadow during a mission, they had mistaken him for Evil Sword God.</p>

    <p>The truth was that the man was just a copycat criminal, who reportedly was a fan of Evil Sword God...</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, there was a huge difference between the dream idol and the real person.</p>

    <p>Who knew how that fan who had been caught in Evil Sword God's place back then would feel if he ever saw this Evil Sword God who turned into a simpleton without his eye shadow...</p>
