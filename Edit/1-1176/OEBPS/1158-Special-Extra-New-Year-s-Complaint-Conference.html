  <h1>Chapter 1158 Special Extra: New Year’s Complaint Conference (This chapter is free)</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Now, let us give a round of applause to the host of this New Year's Tucao Conference, classmate Wang Ling." Er Ha, who had transformed into a human, stared at his flowing green hair and calmly carried out the hosting work.</p>

    <p>This New Year's complaint conference that spans the timeline is not hosted by Er Ha this time. Unfortunately, due to the limited funds of the program, just activating the time circle to bring the three protagonists together in the same space has already spent a lot of money. Went to 99 funds.</p>

    <p>So this New Year's complaint meeting was held in Ku Xuan's pigeon nest.</p>

    <p>There was thunderous applause in the audience, and the Thunder-Throwing Lord, Xiao Yin, and Fang Xing burst into tears, because in this complaining conference, Wang Ling... this man who had never had more than 10 lines in a year, finally spoke. Got it!</p>

    <p>"Thank you all for the warm applause. But please be patient, because the first person to appear next is classmate Qin Zong, who is known as the only koi in the world of cultivation!"</p>

    <p>"I heard that classmate Qin Zong was not qualified to be a guest today. He became a guest through a lottery... Well, let us welcome classmate Qin to the stage with fierce applause."</p>

    <p>On the sofa, after being called by Loopy Toad, Qin Zong had indescribable excitement on his face.</p>

    <p>He walked quickly onto the stage and faced the people under the stage, as well as Wang Ling, who was eating crispy noodles...</p>

    <p>Qin Zong: "As you can see, counting me, there are actually 5 of our guests today. That is, myself, classmate Xiang Yi, classmate Lin Wan, classmate Sun Rong, and classmate Gan Jianmian... But now as you can see, Gan Jianmian... Classmate Mian has been eaten by the host Wang Ling, so this shows what kind of cruel show this is, even the guests are eaten..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling "..."</p>

    <p>Qin Zong, "Classmate Xiang Yi, is also the protagonist of the third book of Ge Xuan's mind-bending book. A man who inherited a wasteland cultivation world. He made a fortune by traveling back and forth between the two worlds, picking up rubbish and building. I have to say, This is also the hardest among the three of us, and we can be called the model worker among the protagonists!”</p>

    <p>"I, as long as I lie down and win the lottery, can be the protagonist; Classmate Wang Ling, as long as I lie down and act cute, I can be the protagonist; Classmate Xiang Yi, I don't know how many times I have died since the beginning of the book; Ku Xuan Gezi asked him After experiencing all kinds of novel ways to die, I seriously doubt that in the real world of Ku Xuan Ge, there is a buddy named Xiang Yi who once offended the old thief Ku Xuan and then was written into the book by the old thief. ”</p>

    <p>Xiang Yi nodded crazily like a chicken pecking at rice, "Really? Actually, I've always felt this way!"</p>

    <p>Qin Zong: "After talking about Xiang Yi, let us focus on Lin Wan. As you can see, Lin Wan is the only woman in our three books who is clearly confirmed to be the heroine! Ku Xuan Ge is obviously He didn’t even have a girlfriend, but he gave Classmate Xiang Yi a girlfriend, and even specially set Classmate Lin Wan to have a highly toxic constitution. This is obviously retaliation for Classmate Xiang!”</p>

    <p>"Next, classmate Sun Rong!"</p>

    <p>Qin Zong pointed his gaze over and saw Sun Rong, who was sitting in the guest seat, straightening her back and greeting everyone around her with a smile on her face.</p>

    <p>Qin Zong cleared his throat, "I'm sorry, because Classmate Sun Rong has too few scenes, I can't find any groove. As a woman who was once forgotten by Ku Xuan Gege, although Classmate Sun Rong is trying hard to stand out in the later plots My own sense of existence, but unfortunately, all of this is of no help. Perhaps it is for this reason that Sun Rong became the heroine in the Immortal King animation. Perhaps this is Ku Xuan Ge's compensation?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong "..."</p>

    <p>Having said this, Qin Zong sighed deeply, and then looked at Wang Ling who was sitting in the main position, "Finally, let us focus on the man who ate the guest at the beginning!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling "..."</p>

    <p>Qin Zong: "Many people say that I became the protagonist by bribing my classmate Wang Ling. But in fact, as the only koi in the cultivation world, I refused when I first became a koi. Everyone knows that I I threw away the express package from Xianzhou, but fate chose me somehow..."</p>

    <p>"In the new year, I wish you all can be as lucky as me, pass every exam, and turn bad luck into good luck! I heard that as long as you leave a message in this paragraph and make a wish, Ling Zhenren will definitely bless you! Thank you all ! I am Qin Zong!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha "Qin's speech is touching! But as the protagonist of Ku Xuan's third new book, let's hear what Xiang Yi thinks."</p>

    <p>Xiang Yi: "Hello everyone, I am the man who has died countless times and even had his ashes raised... but is still alive today..."</p>

    <p>"Many people think that Ge Kuxuan has a grudge against me. In fact, I think that he wrote me out and wrote this third book, which is completely a means of diverting attention. He is escaping from the fact that he has fallen in love with women's clothing. ! Trying to silence myself in the ocean of writing, so as to forget my love for women's clothing! But the voice of the masses cannot be forgotten! I hope everyone can speak out in this paragraph and let the old thief listen. The voice of the masses!”</p>

    <p>"Sorry, I may be a little too excited. Mainly because I finally met my idol, classmate Wang Ling."</p>

    <p>"Before coming here, I once asked Ge Ge Ku Xuan why the three of us are the protagonists and why Wang Ling can be the main character... Later I learned that the three of us have different meanings to Ku Xuan. "</p>

    <p>"As we all know, Ku Xuan has the habit of writing theme songs for the protagonists of his books. Classmate Qin Zong and I also each have a customized theme song. One is called "Reality", the other is called "Counter current Koi", and "Counter current Koi" also has v...and classmate Wang Ling has three songs by himself! The theme song, the interlude, and the Chinese-style interlude!"</p>

    <p>"Old thief Ku Xuan said that Wang Ling is his biological son to him."</p>

    <p>"Qin Zong is his godson."</p>

    <p>"I was picked up from the trash can..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "I'm very sorry. Student Xiang Yi couldn't control his emotions during this period and suffered a sudden myocardial infarction. Please carry Xiang down for a short rest. Classmate Lin Wan is taking care of her. I'm afraid she will have to miss the recording of the complaint conference. …”</p>

    <p>Sun Rong "Do I need to call an ambulance?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "No need, classmate Xiang Yi has resurrection coins. Even if you die of myocardial infarction, you can come back to life immediately."</p>

    <p>Everyone "..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Now, let us all give warm applause to welcome the main character of this issue, classmate Wang Ling!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong "???"</p>

    <p>"Hello everyone...I am Wang Ling..."</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, there was thunderous applause. Wang Ling rubbed his ears. For some reason, he said something and the atmosphere of the whole place was lifted.</p>

    <p>Lord Throwing Thunder: "Brother, come on!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin "Come on aster!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ma "Come on, my dear! Mom loves you! (づ￣3￣)づ╭?~"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "Well... the old thief said... if I praise him today... I won't have to worry about crispy noodles next year..."</p>

    <p>"But I... am not a man who speaks without conscience..."</p>

    <p>"I have to admit... the old thief... is indeed very handsome..."</p>

    <p>"Even women's clothing...is very...beautiful..."</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry...I really...can't make it up anymore..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "I can see that our classmate Wang Ling is indeed a little nervous. Then, let me finish reading the manuscript on my master's behalf..."</p>

    <p>"Old thief Ku Xuan, don't think that if you let me be the protagonist of the animation, I won't complain about you. If you don't update the good Immortal King, you will have to open two other books. Don't you know that it is easy to die suddenly when writing a book in three chapters? There is no resurrection coin for Xiang Yi.”</p>

    <p>"And because you stay at home every day in Sankai, you have become a month and a half again. You can't even wear the women's clothes I bought last year."</p>

    <p>"The Fairy King Animation was agreed upon in June 2018, but it turned out to be delayed day after day. Don't think that because you made me so handsome, I won't beat you. What surprised me most is that there is a female protagonist in the animation. Well. ...Call Sun Rong..."</p>

    <p>"So, who is Sun Rong...?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong "???"</p>

    <p>According to Ku Xuan, it’s almost the New Year. In fact, there are still a lot of flaws that I haven’t complained about...but I still want to leave some ground and explain to everyone after the Immortal King animation is successfully launched. Thank you very much for your concern, brothers and sisters. The 2019 Fairy King animation has had many twists and turns, and finally ushered in new news at the end of the year. There is no doubt this is a good start! In 2020, Pipikru sincerely wishes everyone a happy new year and all the best!</p>
