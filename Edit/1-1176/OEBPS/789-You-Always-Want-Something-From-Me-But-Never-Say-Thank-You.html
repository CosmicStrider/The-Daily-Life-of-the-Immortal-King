  <h1>Chapter 789 You Always Want Something From Me, But Never Say Thank You</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The golden three-inch man that was the embodiment of Heavenly Dao really wanted to cry, but he always felt utterly powerless when he was facing Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He had been summoned here over and over again this month, not because Wang Ling wanted to trade resources or anything, but because he wanted to ask about secrets.</p>

    <p>But these secrets were all mysteries only known to heaven...</p>

    <p>Most importantly, trading for these mysteries was bad enough, but who would trade for them using crispy noodle snacks?</p>

    <p>Blame everything on his father, who had originally used crispy noodle snacks in a transaction with the boy in front of him, thus leading to this reality...</p>

    <p>Devil...</p>

    <p>"Go ahead, what do you want?" The golden three-inch man sighed, already completely giving in to this reality.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was rummaging through his drawer. He actually didn't have many crispy noodle snacks left, and was very reluctant to give them away.</p>

    <p>And so, he was looking for expired crispy noodle snacks.</p>

    <p>The flagship store had a recall service for expired crispy noodle snacks. Since Wang Ling was a gold card VIP customer, the flagship store could come by to retrieve the expired snacks, but Wang Ling had thought later that he should keep some of them for the Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>Thus, before the summer camp began, Wang Ling had used the door-to-door VIP service and had gotten Er Ha to help do a swap. Furthermore, what he wanted in exchange was expired crispy noodle snacks...</p>

    <p>An intact original flavor crispy noodle snack packet could be exchanged for three expired crispy noodle snack packets!</p>

    <p>The golden three-inch man was blank at this scene, and he immediately stretched out a shaky hand. "— Young hero, wait a minute!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling turned around. "???"</p>

    <p>The golden three-inch man: "You actually don't need to use crispy noodle snacks for a transaction... We're just a loan service, so you can ask your questions first and then swap handwritten copies for them later."</p>

    <p>So good?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's eyes sparkled when he heard this.</p>

    <p>The Heavenly Dao this time was really quite conscientious!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed with feeling in his heart.</p>

    <p>But the problem was that he had already prepared the expired crispy noodle snacks; it would be a shame if he didn't use them!</p>

    <p>"Just nice, three questions."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling spoke lightly, and then presented three packets of expired crispy noodle snacks.</p>

    <p>The golden three-inch man was shocked. "Ex- expired?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised his eyebrows and stared at the Heavenly Dao as he said in a firm telepathic voice: <em>When we make a deal, it depends on what I have, not what you want...</em></p>

    <p>The golden three-inch man simply wanted to cry. "..."</p>

    <p>"Let's begin." Wang Ling stared at the golden three-inch man.</p>

    <p>The golden man wanted to cry but had no tears to shed. He rubbed his hands together, and a golden scroll emerged. "This is the Book of Heavenly Mysteries, a golden scroll which is an exclusive record of all the mysteries of heaven. You can put your question inside the Book of Heavenly Mysteries, and it will show you the answer."</p>

    <p>The Book of Heavenly Mysteries was a supreme magic artifact which was a record of all the secrets of Great Dao. It was a naturally occurring, divine level magic treasure that surpassed all of heaven and earth, and was of course a level above world-defying magic artifacts.</p>

    <p>An ordinary person had to pay the price in order to behold the secrets of Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>Answers to all the secrets stored in the Heavenly Dao's Repository of Heavenly Mysteries could be obtained from this book.</p>

    <p>Of course, these secrets had to be related to "Heavenly Dao."</p>

    <p>A lot of questions wouldn't be valid, such as: what does so-and-so like to eat, what sort of scandal fodder there was on them...</p>

    <p>If these people themselves weren't closely connected to Heavenly Dao, then their questions were all in vain.</p>

    <p>According to the laws of Heavenly Dao, the price for beholding the Repository of Heavenly Mysteries was as follows:</p>

    <p><em>One: To behold the heavenly mysteries, a person has to trade something of equal value, and if necessary, it might be at the cost of one's life.</em></p>

    <p><em>Two: Following on from Rule One, after an answer is obtained at the cost of one's life, the person will disintegrate into fine powder and disappear in forty-eight hours.</em></p>

    <p><em>Three: If the person who beholds the heavenly mysteries is extremely evil, they will never be reincarnated after death.</em></p>

    <p><em>Four: After obtaining their answer, the person who beheld the heavenly mysteries must guard this top secret. If they leak it, they will be struck by lightning as punishment by Heavenly Dao, never to be reincarnated.</em></p>

    <p><em>Five: To behold the heavenly mysteries, a person must have cultivated more than a hundred Heavenly Dao, or possess more than three Outer Dao.</em></p>

    <p><em>Six: To behold the heavenly mysteries, a person can use an equivalent amount of their lifespan to make up the value of their offering.</em></p>

    <p><em>Seven: The Heavenly Dao reserves the right to interpret the price.</em></p>

    <p><em>Eight: People on the Heavenly Dao white list are not bound by the above rules...</em></p>

    <p>And it just so happened that Wang Ling was on the Heavenly Dao white list.</p>

    <p>So the golden three-inch man couldn't do anything to him.</p>

    <p>If other people wanted to behold the heavenly mysteries, they would pay with their lives at the very worst.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling wanted to behold the heavenly mysteries, he just needed to hand over handwritten work which he didn't want, or even expired crispy noodle snacks.</p>

    <p>— You could do whatever you wanted if you had privilege!</p>

    <p>The golden three-inch man felt very helpless, but could only accept this...</p>

    <p>What was the saying?</p>

    <p><em>When the wheel of Heavenly Dao turns, who will Wang Ling get a hold of...</em></p>

    <p>They were finally seeing the bitter fruit of what they had planted back then.</p>

    <p>And so, when Wang Ling wrote down the questions he wanted to ask inside the Book of Heavenly Mysteries and looked up again, he saw two streams of tears actually running down the golden three-inch man's indistinct face...</p>

    <p>The man was actually crying?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was a little confused as to why.</p>

    <p>He was such an affable person!</p>

    <p>The golden three-inch man wiped at his tears and put away the three packets of expired crispy noodle snacks in front of him... Wang Ling was privileged enough that he could usually use his handwritten work to swap for resources, yet he used these three expired snack packets, which really weren't as good!!</p>

    <p>"Your questions have been received by the Repository of Heavenly Mysteries... Hm, it'll take roughly three to four minutes for the answers to show up in the Book of Heavenly Mysteries." The golden three-inch man rolled up the scroll and placed it in front of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Three or four minutes was precisely enough time for a song.</p>

    <p>All of a sudden, the golden three-inch man was seized by a whim to play Wang Ling a song.</p>

    <p>"Why don't you listen to this song..."</p>

    <p>The golden man simply clapped his hands, and a melodious singing voice in 3D surround sound instantly filled the room.</p>

    <p>The song's beautiful prelude rang out.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "This is...?"</p>

    <p>The golden man: "This is sung by a Heavenly Dao female singer. Each of us Heavenly Dao has a different role. When a lot of cultivators pass away, they see their lives flash before their eyes, and will hear melodious music, which is quietly performed by the Heavenly Dao female singer in the background. So not just anyone can hear her voice — it can change in myriad ways, and is an accumulation of all the most remarkable voices throughout the cosmos. Every voice can imitate an instrument, so she can sing with an accompaniment."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "Mm..."</p>

    <p>At that moment, this Heavenly Dao female singer with the countless voices had finished singing the prelude.</p>

    <p>The song officially started:</p>

    <p><em>You always want something from me, but never say thank you.</em></p>

    <p><em>Not until I grew up did I realize that crispy noodle snacks were cheap.</em></p>

    <p><em>Each time we do a trade, you pretend everything's fine,</em></p>

    <p><em>Saying with a smile "let's trade, I'll give you expired snacks <sup>1</sup> </em><em>... </em>"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Adapted from the song
"Father" sung by Chopstick
Brothers ..)</dfn>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The golden man: "So, anything you want to say?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "Mm, it sounds nice."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>The golden man completely gave up on Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>Forget it, expired was expired...</p>

    <p>There weren't many better clients than those on the Heavenly Dao white list who couldn't be condemned to death...</p>
