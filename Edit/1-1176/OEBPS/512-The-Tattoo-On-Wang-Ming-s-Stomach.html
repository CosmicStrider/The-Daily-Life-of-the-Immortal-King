  <h1>Chapter 512 The Tattoo On Wang Ming's Stomach </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling wasn't surprised by Wang Ming's visit this time. He guessed that the results of the space assessment which they had performed on Daoist Guang's tattered robe last week had come out. The robe had remnants of the Heaven-Cleaving sword's chaotic sword qi on it from when Evil Sword God had pursued Daoist Guang back then, and Wang Ming had used this sword qi to find a trail back to the space Evil Sword God had been in before.</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang had previous speculated that the entrance to the legendary Immortal's Treasure House was likely in a space cavern that linked the human world and the demon world together. Daoist Guang called this space the entrance to the Otherworld.</p>

    <p>But this was just speculation. Furthermore, even if an entrance did exist, it didn't necessarily lead to the Immortal's Treasure House. Almightys at Venerated Immortal level set up worlds like they were playing a game, so it was possible that Immortal Zhenyuan had established many equally fake worlds to mask the real Immortal's Treasure House, as if he was playing whack-a-mole...</p>

    <p>The talisman seal was growing weaker and weaker, and the primordial qi inside Wang Ling's body was starting to gradually adapt to the special substance inside the talisman. Furthermore, the primordial qi was starting to reinforce itself, forming something similar to an antibody.</p>

    <p>Of course, Wang Ming had deduced that it would still be another five to seven years before the talisman's effect wore off completely. That was to say, Wang Ling had to find a new way of either controlling his primordial qi himself or replacing the talisman seal before he went to university.</p>

    <p>It might seem that he still had a lot of time, but whether it was five or seven years, this was just the blink of an eye for a lot of cultivators. For seclusion maniacs like Patriarch Reliance, the headmaster of that Reliance High School from the combined military drill for six schools, five years in seclusion was like going to the toilet.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling hoped he would be able to find something in the Immortal's Treasure House, but he wasn't placing all his expectations on it.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, nothing would be better than him being able to control the primordial qi himself.</p>

    <p>But in the last few years, Wang Ling had noticed that his realm seemed to be advancing at a quicker rate. In the past, his realm would move up once every two years, but lately it seemed that his strength was growing again...</p>

    <p>The primordial qi changed with the growth in his realm.</p>

    <p>He had to adapt to his realm in order to be able to completely control the primordial qi. But the problem now was that he was growing too quickly, which didn't give him any time to adapt to his realm at all! It was like how some writers were slow to update their novels - it might look like they could keep up, but there was a chance that they would be behind in chapters right up until their next book...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>That evening, it was Zhai Yin once again who sent Wang Ming over, and Wang Ling wasn't as hostile toward her as he had been the last few times. Zhai Yin, moreover, was well aware that if she wanted to thoroughly conquer Wang Ming, she would inevitably need Wang Ling's help.</p>

    <p>The best in fact would be if she could win over her "brother-in-law."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin was utterly clear on this point after her last encounter with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Sending Wang Ming over this time, she still had on a wooden "strangers stay away" face, but when she saw Wang Ling open the door, she still did her best to soften her expression with a slight smile.</p>

    <p>It looked quite stiff, though.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming's lips twitched at this scene and his tongue was as poisonous as ever: "With your zombie face, you better not smile... If you let your hair down, with this expression, you could star in <em>The Grudge </em>."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin kept a tight rein on her anger. "..." She absolutely couldn't forget herself in front of her "brother-in-law"!</p>

    <p>They entered and switched to house slippers. Mother Wang and the old man were just about done with cooking. Mother Wang had calculated the right time to cook the vegetables, and she was walking out of the kitchen with a plate of stir-fried broccoli in her hands when she saw Zhai Yin and Wang Ming. "You're here! Come and sit down!"</p>

    <p>The one thing the Wang family's small villa didn't lack was broccoli... Ever since Lord Diulei had made up his mind to comprehend the Heavenly Dao from broccoli, he had become absorbed in breeding different varieties of broccoli and would send a large amount to the villa each month.</p>

    <p>The most terrifying thing was that because this broccoli had been grown in spirit soil, they stayed fresh for a very long time!</p>

    <p>Even when it wasn't kept in the fridge, it could be stored for two or three years without turning yellow or becoming moldy, and would still be fresh and rich in water content.</p>

    <p>Putting the dish down, Mother Wang wiped her oily fingers on her apron out of habit.</p>

    <p>Seeing that Zhai Yin looked a little ill at ease, Mother Wang quickly smiled. "Don't be polite, Miss Zhai, it's not your first time here, come and sit!"</p>

    <p>After several meetings, Mother Wang had learned Zhai Yin's identity as well as her gender. It wasn't Wang Ming who had told her, but Father Wang who had asked an "acquaintance" to check Zhai Yin out - Father Wang's most powerful fan was President Qi's direct superior and also the top leader. If there was anything Father Wang wanted to know, he just needed to open his fan group and send a private message.</p>

    <p>As a writer, you never knew what on earth your fans could do...</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling felt that Father Wang was a bit of a gossip sometimes. Furthermore, it seemed that in the last few years, Father Wang had even joined the "Wang Ming Get Married" group, and had already started to raise money for Wang Ming's wedding. Even Wang Ming himself didn't know about it, and Wang Ling had only found out inadvertently.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, Wang Ling would recall where Zhai Yin had come from... an administrator of Magnificent Immortal's Depository of Buddhist Texts — how many cultivators dreamed about this job? Wang Ling had also heard that these administrators were on fixed contracts and couldn't resign at will. But Zhai Yin had unexpectedly been transferred to the Cultivation Academy of Science to become Lu Wei's personal guard (Lu Wei = Scientist) <sup>1</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Lu Wei is Lu Benwei's nickname, and online users sometimes use 'scientist' to mock his cheating in games.)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ming had told Wang Ling before that it was President Qi who had used his connections to have Zhai Yin transferred.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling didn't think the truth was that simple.</p>

    <p>To say that Father Wang might have added fuel to the fire in the background actually wasn't an impossibility...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling randomly chose a seat and then watched as Zhai Yin unexpectedly pulled out the chair next to him and sat down.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "???"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming laughed when he saw this. "Hey, that's Er Ha's seat."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin's intention had only been to slowly win Wang Ling's favor.</p>

    <p>To be precise, this was her first time eating with them, so she completely had no idea that this was Er Ha's seat.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ming saw that Zhai Yin hadn't moved, he was dumbfounded. "It's the dog that was lying down at the door when we came in... You would even fight a dog over a chair?!"</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin's lips twitched violently as she tamped down her fury and changed seats.</p>

    <p>This time, she chose the chair directly next to Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming shook his head. "This is my grandfather's seat!"</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin got up and moved one chair down.</p>

    <p>Once again, Wang Ming said, "No no no, that's my auntie's seat!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling could completely tell that Wang Ming was deliberately picking a fight...</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin couldn't take it anymore; she directly stretched out one hand to pull Wang Ming up by his collar.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was alarmed. "What do you want?" He couldn't throw her off at all.</p>

    <p>Naturally, Zhai Yin wouldn't hit him; she simply unbuttoned the bottom half of his shirt instead.</p>

    <p>Then, Wang Ling almost sprayed out water... because he saw that there was actually a tattoo on Wang Ming's stomach; what was more, it was of a well-known cartoon character!</p>

    <p>Furthermore, only cultivators would be able to see this tattoo, and normal people like Wang Ming who couldn't use spirit energy wouldn't be able to see it at all.</p>

    <p>This was obviously Zhai Yin's revenge — maybe she had secretly drawn it on his stomach when he had been asleep.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming didn't know exactly what was going on, but he could guess something was up, and he turned his head to stare at Zhai Yin. "What did you draw on my stomach?"</p>

    <p>How humiliating!</p>

    <p>And in front of Wang Ling as well!</p>

    <p>Wang Ming felt some regret. He had thought that Zhai Yin wouldn't do anything to him in front of Wang Ling. He had just been joking around and had never thought that it would turn into a tit for tat...</p>

    <p>Then, some spirit energy shot out from Wang Ling's fingertip to settle on Wang Ming's eyes.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming turned pale when he saw what had been tattooed on his stomach. "What the hell! Peppa Pig?!"</p>

    <p><em>Papapa...</em></p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Ling started to clap his hands with a deadpan expression.</p>

    <p>How did the saying go?</p>

    <p><em>Get a Peppa Pig tatt...</em></p>

    <p><em>Shout out to your frat <sup>2</sup> </em><em>...</em></p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is a Peppa Pig meme where she is jokingly cast as a 'society' or 'frat member', which in colloquial Chinese refers to a gangster ..)</dfn>
