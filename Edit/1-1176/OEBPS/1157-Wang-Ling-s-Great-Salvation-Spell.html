  <h1>Chapter 1157 Wang Ling's Great Salvation Spell</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This familiar pattern of a dead person coming back to life confirmed Wang Ling's guess.</p>

    <p>Whether it was Bai Youquan, the son of President Bai, or Nightmare, whom President Qi had captured in Nine Dragon Pagoda, it was the same person pulling all the strings behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>The profound truth of Fate Dao was to control life and death, to overturn the heavens and change one's fate; it wasn't just a simple resurrection spell. Xia Lixing had been resurrected, but the power of Fate Dao could rig it so that at a critical moment, any of the Xia Lixings in numerous parallel worlds could become his substitute and die in his place.</p>

    <p>Thus, normal Heavenly Dao spells had no effect at all.</p>

    <p>But the Great Salvation Spell was different. This was one of Wang Ling's top ten spells of the thirty thousand Heavenly Dao, which could help all living things in the universe to cross over; any evil spirit would fade to nothing under the effect of the Great Salvation Spell. That was to say, no matter how many times Xia Lixing was resurrected on the spot due to Fate Dao, the power of salvation would always exist as long as Wang Ling didn't lift the Great Salvation Spell that was cast on Xia Lixing.</p>

    <p>And so, Xia Lixing was now performing the rarely seen death sit-ups in front of Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had no idea how much Fate Dao had been allocated to Xia Lixing by the mastermind behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>If Xia Lixing had only been given one hundred, like Bai Youquan, then he would die one hundred times. If it was three thousand... then he would have to die three thousand times.</p>

    <p>But Bai Youquan was more foolish compared with Human Devil Xia Lixing.</p>

    <p>He thought that he could beat Wang Ling by combining the strength of one hundred Fate Dao together.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that in the end, Bai Youquan was still too green.</p>

    <p>From what Zhuo Yi said, however, Bai Youquan's mouth was still resolutely shut. He was currently receiving the same sort of torture in Leifeng Pagoda as Immortal She Pi had experienced back then, and would be punished with thunderbolts to the head daily until he confessed.</p>

    <p>After a minute...</p>

    <p>Under Wang Ling's Great Salvation Spell, Xia Lixing was instantly killed close to six hundred times before he finally died for good.</p>

    <p>If this average frequency of dying every 0.1 second was recorded down, it would be a new world record in the cultivation world.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, there was no one here to witness this scene. Wang Ling had cast the spell in a more secluded place, so no one saw anything at all.</p>

    <p>After getting rid of Xia Lixing, Wang Ling walked out of the underbrush like nothing had happened. With Human Devil's death, the agitated mountain spirit calmed down. That giant hand of flowing, burning lava pulled back into the summoning array, and Fire Peak's mountain spirit fell asleep once more.</p>

    <p>As Wang Ling had expected, Xia Lixing was the cause of this mayhem.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, he had acted in time, or all the living things on Fire Peak might have suffered in the wake of the mountain spirit's awakening.</p>

    <p>After all, except for Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>Few people could fight against a force of nature.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling never thought that he would be forced to take a class on environmental protection during this national body techniques competition on Nine Dragon Mountain.</p>

    <p>But it wasn't over yet.</p>

    <p>Firstly, the person pulling the strings behind the scenes had yet to be found.</p>

    <p>Secondly, the "Eye of Rebellion" curse on Xia Ming had yet to be lifted.</p>

    <p>Xia Ming was still traumatized by the fact that he had unintentionally summoned the mountain spirit, and had almost caused great destruction... He was still panicking when the mountain spirit calmed down, but even after that, he still had a glazed expression, and couldn't come back to his senses at all.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The alarm was canceled, and the magic ball in the command center, which was responsible for monitoring abnormal energy, calmed down. When the mountain spirit had woken up earlier, the numbers for the fluctuation of spirit power had instantly maxed out on the surveillance instruments, and then fell just as quickly... It was like a roller coaster.</p>

    <p>"Strange..." Huang Feng frowned and asked, "The mountain spirit woke up, yawned, then went back to sleep?"</p>

    <p>President Qi also frowned. "It <em>is</em> very strange - I think something's wrong."</p>

    <p>It didn't seem to them that the mountain spirit would wake up for no reason at all - something must have disturbed its slumber. As for the idea that a Foundation Establishment student could summon the mountain spirit with the Spirit Summoning Technique, this could in fact be explained as a complete coincidence. For instance, there might already have been signs that the mountain spirit was waking up, and the Spirit Summoning Technique just happened to have an effect similar to that of a sober-up agent.</p>

    <p>But not everything could be explained so clearly.</p>

    <p>They had to figure out what had disturbed the mountain spirit's slumber.</p>

    <p>Old Huang Lao said slowly, "The laws of nature govern the survival of mankind. However powerful our cultivation, and however long we can live, there is only one planet suitable for us to live on, though we recently made a breakthrough in our exploration of space with the discovery of Divine Dao Star.</p>

    <p>"Divine Dao Star is too far away from us, however, and is home to many other alien beings. In the end, cultural differences are a problem, and it isn't realistic for cultivators to migrate at present. So, protecting what is in front of us right now is the most important."</p>

    <p>Many of the headmasters present nodded when they heard this.</p>

    <p>It was indeed important to look to the future, but the priority was still to focus on the present.</p>

    <p>Mankind still wasn't united In the current cultivation world, and there were still many shortcomings that had yet to be fixed.</p>

    <p>The recent murders in the medical field were a prime example.</p>

    <p>These were cultivators who were passionately devoted to their medical careers, but who were senselessly stabbed to death by hoodlums because of a few hysterical patients...</p>

    <p>So, this world was still in need of reform and change.</p>

    <p>But the very notion of change did imply that cultivators could make progress, step by step, and slowly make the world a perfect and united place.</p>

    <p>"Old Qi."</p>

    <p>At that moment, President Qi heard the sound of General Bai's voice.</p>

    <p>President Qi: "This is the command center. Go ahead."</p>

    <p>General Bai: "It seems that Xia Lixing is more cunning than I thought. We've lost the target... Can you locate him again?"</p>

    <p>"Locate him again, is it?"</p>

    <p>President Qi nodded. He spread out his mental powers and covered every inch of Nine Dragon Mountain. He had been a member of the operations team in the hunt for Xia Lixing when the latter was still alive back then, so he was naturally familiar with Human Devil.</p>

    <p>A man couldn't disappear for no reason. Xia Lixing was very sly, so President Qi speculated that the former must have used some method to cover his tracks.</p>

    <p>But after searching the entire area, President Qi found the outcome inconceivable.</p>

    <p>His eyes darkened. "He's disappeared off the map... How is that possible?"</p>

    <p>Old Huang opened his eyes and said, "Xia Lixing is dead."</p>

    <p>President Qi was shocked. "Xia Lixing is dead? This..."</p>

    <p>"Since you and I can't detect any traces of his aura, there's only one conclusion. A person can't disappear for no reason. Furthermore, there is too much evil energy on Xia Lixing - it's impossible for him not to leave any traces behind if he was alive."</p>

    <p>"But how did he die? There must be a reason..."</p>

    <p>Old Huang nodded. "Mm."</p>

    <p>He couldn't hide the grave expression on his face.</p>

    <p>At that moment, President Qi glanced at Zhuo Yi, who was on the side, and he confirmed that Zhuo Yi had never left the command center.</p>

    <p>That was because based on past experience, it was Zhuo Yi who had a hand in most of these types of odd incidents...</p>
