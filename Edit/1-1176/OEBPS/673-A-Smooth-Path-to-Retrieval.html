  <h1>Chapter 673 A Smooth Path to Retrieval</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The general situation was proceeding more smoothly than Elder Yaren had imagined. The Blood Binding Spell wasn't purely an imprisonment spell, but also a dark spell that could transform qi and blood into spirit energy to replenish itself. All dark spells were currently banned on the market and it was prohibited to use or sell them. Nevertheless, this type of spell was very popular in foreign markets.</p>

    <p>Elder Yaren only drew some qi and blood from the bodies of these little brothers and stopped after they fainted. He didn't get rid of them completely.</p>

    <p>Since the start of the plan, he had already decided not to do anything unnecessary. His objective was very clear: it was just to retrieve the body. Even if Director Zhuo blocked him from doing so later, Elder Yaren didn't plan to create any unnecessary complications.</p>

    <p>All this was so as not to affect tomorrow's master plan.</p>

    <p>The qi and blood energy drawn from the little brothers transformed into a glowing scarlet magic sphere which floated lightly above Elder Yaren's head. Ultimately, this scarlet magic sphere sunk into the top of Elder Yaren's head and was completely absorbed.</p>

    <p>When he absorbed it, Elder Yaren's body shone with a red lustre and his entire complexion seemed to improved significantly. He had drawn thirty percent of the qi and blood energy from each of the six Golden Core cultivators and converted it into spirit energy to replenish his own body, which was quite a considerable gain.</p>

    <p>Well...</p>

    <p>Since Elder Ji Xing had drunk some of his tissue before, Elder Yaren was still a little weak now.</p>

    <p>But now with this energy supplement, Elder Yaren did feel a lot more comfortable.</p>

    <p>"How's the plan coming along?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Elder Ji Xing's voice came from Elder Yaren's soul mark; he could use magic with the soul crystal ball in front of him for long-range communication.</p>

    <p>One of the biggest advantages of this kind of communication was that it could directly reach the heart and disregard electronic signals. Even if you were in an area with no signal at all, this method could be used to contact a person who had the soul mark in them; most importantly, no one could listen in.</p>

    <p>Since Elder Yin and Elder Poisonous Dragon had died suddenly one after another, Elder Ji Xing was a little worried about how Elder Yaren's assignment was coming along...</p>

    <p>If Elder Yaren, as the second strongest of the fifteen members in the team, died just like that, it would be a huge loss to the whole team!</p>

    <p>"So far, so good," Elder Yaren replied.</p>

    <p>He knew that the link through the crystal ball had been activated, and that he only needed to think in his mind to reply.</p>

    <p>He hid the unconscious little brothers in the green belt on the side and set up a scarlet screen. This was a barrier spell that could completely hide the auras of these people.</p>

    <p>Elder Ji Xing was relieved when he heard Elder Yaren's reply, and then said in a stern tone, "I received the latest response from Mo Immortal Castle. The road section which Elder Yin is on has been blocked off, and the anti-chemical protection unit is on its way. This must be done quickly."</p>

    <p>"Naturally."</p>

    <p>Elder Yaren replied, "My mission is to just retrieve the body... I've already stopped the anti-chemical protection vehicle, and I'm about to go in undercover. Don't worry, I'm not planning to do anything unnecessary. I'll be very quick to retrieve the body and I'll return safe and sound."</p>

    <p>Elder Yaren's voice came out of the soul crystal ball.</p>

    <p>But for some reason, Elder Ji Xing felt uneasy when he heard this.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, at the other end of the road, Zhuo Yi and Zhong Lang were waiting for the anti-chemical protection vehicle.</p>

    <p>It was too slow...</p>

    <p>They had already waited for so long, and during this time, Elder Yin's highly toxic body had already started to react slightly as black poisonous gas slowly started to seep out of it. The highly poisonous gas was so corrosive that it even dissolved the ground and caused the van next to it to burn.</p>

    <p>Elder Yin's corpse had now completely turned into a highly acidic and corrosive poison.</p>

    <p>Zhong Lang pinched his nose. "Brother Zhuo, is this really alright..."</p>

    <p>He couldn't help glancing at the peach wood sword in Zhuo Yi's hand. Needless to say, it was the power of this spirit sword that had helped them avert disaster just now.</p>

    <p>But from beginning to end, Zhong Lang couldn't believe what he was seeing...</p>

    <p>Because the problem was that this was a peach wood sword that couldn't be any more ordinary! He had seen so many identical ones in the flower and bird market! This type of peach wood sword actually spawned a sword spirit! And it had actually possessed Zhuo Yi's body to confront Elder Yin...</p>

    <p>Zhong Lang felt that everything he knew had already been overturned and it was all a mess.</p>

    <p>"The anti-chemical protection unit will arrive soon, we should hold our breaths as much as possible," Zhuo Yi said, and took a few steps back with Zhong Lang. The black poisonous fog emitted by Elder Yin's corpse had already begun to spread, like the blue circle in the game, as it slowly extended outward close to their feet.</p>

    <p>Just then, Zhuo Yi felt the spirit sword in his hand vibrate slightly.</p>

    <p>He was surprised. "Lord Jingke?"</p>

    <p>At that moment, Jingke acted once again to draw a circle of sword qi around Elder Yin's body and create a brown screen, keeping the poison gas safely inside!</p>

    <p>When it happened, Zhong Lang clearly saw a sword spirit apparition of a ten-year-old child with white hair...</p>

    <p>Although Jingke's true appearance came and went in a flash, Zhong Lang had still seen it.</p>

    <p>For some reason, his heart rate had sped up and there was a blush on his face! — He felt that this peach wood sword was quite handsome!</p>

    <p>"Brother Zhuo... This spirit sword..."</p>

    <p>"He's my <em>shifu's </em> spirit sword." Zhuo Yi didn't dodge the question.</p>

    <p>In fact, many people knew that he had a <em>shifu </em>, but who on earth this <em>shifu </em>was, was still a mystery.</p>

    <p>Zhong Lang's emotions swelled. "Brother Zhuo, your <em>shifu's </em> sword is quite handsome! Does he have a name? Will he take a disciple?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi looked into the air and gave an introduction. "His name is Jingke... I'm used to calling him Lord Jingke. 'Jing' from the word 'shock <sup>1</sup> ' and 'ke' from 'dreams of grandeur <sup>2</sup> ...'"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(惊 in 惊撼.)</dfn>
    
    <br/>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(柯 in 南柯一梦 ..)</dfn>

    <p>Jingke?</p>

    <p>Good name!</p>

    <p>Zhong Lang was very excited.</p>

    <p>So he was called Lord Jingke...</p>

    <p>He felt like he had already become a fan!</p>

    <p>Crap! Was this what it felt like to fall in love?</p>

    <p>While Zhong Lang burst with excitement, he heard faint sounds of a car from up ahead.</p>

    <p>The anti-chemical protection vehicle had finally arrived.</p>

    <p>Elder Yaren got out from the driver's seat. He was wearing a white anti-chemical protection suit which he had taken from one of the little brothers. His eyes were thoroughly hidden behind the reflective mask of the anti-chemical protection suit, and he was so wrapped up that his face couldn't be seen at all.</p>

    <p>When the anti-chemical protection vehicle stopped, Elder Yaren feigned respect and waved in acknowledgement before sweeping his eyes over the surroundings.</p>

    <p>The poison inside Elder Yin had already turned into a black gas that was spreading out, but it was actually confined behind a brown screen...</p>

    <p>"Are you alone, comrade?" Zhuo Yi greeted him from a distance.</p>

    <p>"Yes..." Elder Yaren nodded his head. The more he said, the more mistakes he might make, so he was succinct.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi nodded. Really, it wasn't like he couldn't understand; after all, retrieving a poisonous corpse was very hazardous.</p>

    <p>Outside the barrier screen, Zhuo Yi reached out to shake hands with this little brother. "Thank you for your hard work, comrade, I'll let your leader know later, what we need now are people as fearless and dedicated as you."</p>

    <p>"Haha... you flatter me!"</p>

    <p>Considering Zhuo Yi's identity, Elder Yaren thought it was better to shake his hand so as not to give the game away.</p>

    <p>So he walked outside Jingke's sword qi screen and took off his glove to shake hands with Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>When he was done, he returned to Elder Yin's body.</p>

    <p>He was extremely nervous about exposing his identity. Zhuo Yi saw that this little brother had even forgotten to put his glove back on and then directly touched Elder Yin's body...</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Comrade, wait!"</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, it was all already too late...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Five minutes later, Elder Ji Xing was observing Elder Yaren's soul mark through the soul crystal ball in the military tent.</p>

    <p>Unlike Elder Yin's and Elder Poisonous Dragon's soul marks which had directly exploded in bursts of light...</p>

    <p>Elder Yaren's soul mark twinkled like a little star...</p>
