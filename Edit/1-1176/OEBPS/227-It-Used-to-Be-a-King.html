  <h1>Chapter 227 It Used to Be a King... </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Because of his poor physique, Wang Ming had been unable to cultivate his whole life. Even though he had the strongest brain, he was still very envious of Wang Ling's inherent realm.</p>

    <p>What did it feel like to cultivate?</p>

    <p>He actually really wanted to experience it.</p>

    <p>But this was only just a thought, because if you wanted to become an excellent cultivator in the modern era, the pressure was quite intense!</p>

    <p>Modern cultivation emphasized a quality education; the dragon-defying heaven <sup>1</sup> cultivation style of killing god or Buddha when they obstructed your way was already a thing of the past.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is an Internet phrase
usually used to mock
protagonists with golden
halos, i.e. those who score
easy victories without needing
to use their brains or much
effort.)</dfn>

    <p>To be a renowned cultivator now, you not only had to be able to stand out, you also had to take on a certain degree of social responsibility.</p>

    <p>In comparison, Wang Ming felt that the pressure on Wang Ling was larger than what he himself bore. Wang Ling lived everyday like he was treading water as he tried this and that to reduce his presence and prevent his strength from leaking out. In addition, he had to think about saving the world along the way...</p>

    <p>The problem was that all these troublesome things were automatically laid at his door when he had never wanted to get involved.</p>

    <p>The appearance of the Gate Between Worlds should have been a world-shaking event.</p>

    <p>This time, Wang Ling had offhandedly closed the door and even cut off a demon king's arm in passing, saving the world unnoticed once again...</p>

    <p>God knew what other kind of trouble there would be in the future.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming looked at Wang Ling's exceptionally placid face next to him, and his heart immediately ached a little for his little brother.</p>

    <p>After all, he was only sixteen years old...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>About three minutes after Wang Ling had shut the door, the Gate Between Worlds started to disperse, becoming an afterimage, and the door that was over ten zhang tall seemed to dissolve in the air and gradually disappeared.</p>

    <p>"Gone, just like that?" Wang Ming heaved a long sigh, looking a little tired. When he had faced the Gate Between Worlds earlier, the shock and impact had really been too overwhelming, and the experience had been more thrilling than riding a rollercoaster.</p>

    <p>At that moment, there was a voice from the side. "The Gate Between Worlds' weapon spirit disappeared a thousand years ago, otherwise the Gate wouldn't have disappeared this quickly. Now, every time that it's open, it can only operate by consuming demon energy as a power source. Once the door is closed and there's no new energy source, the Gate Between Worlds will automatically disappear."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming turned his head to look behind him, and realized that a green-furred akita had actually shown up who knew when.</p>

    <p>He suddenly remembered that Father Wang had mentioned to him before that Wang Ling's class had a dog which the Wang family was now fostering.</p>

    <p>It was just that he had never expected that this dog's identity wouldn't be so simple. Not only did it have intimate knowledge of the Gate Between Worlds, it was also able to speak human language!</p>

    <p>"Why do you know so much about the Gate Between Worlds?" Wang Ming blinked and stared at Er Ha.</p>

    <p>It was already in the past...</p>

    <p>But like every other time when it came to this matter, Er Ha's eyes were already shimmering with crystal tears.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Because I came out of it back then... I, this king, am a toad full of pride!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Until... I landed in the human world, and Little Master Ling punched a hole right through my stomach."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Wang Ming: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming rubbed his jaw and still thought it was a bit strange. "You said you're a toad. How on earth then did you turn into a dog?"</p>

    <p>"It's a long story..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha sighed, but at the same time was a bit mad in its heart: How I ended up in this situation, don't you two brothers have any freaking idea?!</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming looked at Er Ha and suddenly thought of a sentence.</p>

    <p>It used to be a king... Later, it said 'forget it' <sup>2</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is an adapted lyric from a
'rap' song by popular
live-streamer MC Tianyou ..)</dfn>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Many screens were flashing in the conference room, and the old Secretary's eyes seemed unusually deep as he fixed his gaze on them.</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen felt it was a little strange. "Secretary Dakang, are you alright?"</p>

    <p>The old Secretary frowned. "Perhaps it's just an illusion, but I feel that there's a different kind of fluctuation in the small world. Although Yi Jianchuan that old man is the source of this small world, I was also responsible for the basic establishment of some of its nomological laws when it was set up in the beginning."</p>

    <p>As it turned out, the old Secretary's feeling wasn't wrong.</p>

    <p>The Gate Between Worlds had made a crackling appearance in the small world, but the broadcast of that area had been completely blocked by Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>Actually, the surveillance device in Zhuo Yi's hand had detected that fluctuation earlier on. The wave had undulated like a rollercoaster before climbing to a critical value that couldn't be measured. This had lasted for roughly three minutes before it had suddenly dropped to a normal range.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi knew it had to be that his shifu had encountered something in the small world.</p>

    <p>But in the end, they still couldn't outfox the old Secretary.</p>

    <p>Pretending to look at the data, Zhuo Yi reported with deliberate calm, "Erm, indeed, there were three minutes of unusual activity in the surveillance data just now, but it returned to normal very quickly, so it's probably a system error."</p>

    <p>A system error?</p>

    <p>The old Secretary frowned.</p>

    <p>That strength had really been too real and was very dangerous, but it wasn't the type of power that an evil demon could release. The old Secretary had felt a righteous aura contained in that sudden burst of power... really, it had felt just like the godly punishment, and was very pure!</p>

    <p>Had it really just been an illusion?</p>

    <p>"I feel like I might have sensed this same aura the last time during the spirit sword exchange meet between Number 59 High School and Number 60 High School..." He rubbed his stubble beard with a puzzled expression on his face.</p>

    <p>However, the aura had only appeared for a very short while back then, and it hadn't been as strong as what he felt now.</p>

    <p>"..." Zhuo Yi sweated a bit. He already knew what aura the old Secretary was talking about. After a spirit sword had been with its master for a long time, the aura it released would be similar to its master's, so the aura which the old Secretary had felt at that time was actually Jingke's.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi looked around and noticed that Patriarch Reliance, sitting next to Headmaster Chen, looked like he wanted to say something. This patriarch was probably the strongest of the six school headmasters; he was an old senior addicted to seclusion, but with powers of perception that were almost uncanny.</p>

    <p>What should he do?</p>

    <p>Would everything be exposed?</p>

    <p>There was some panic in Zhuo Yi's eyes.</p>

    <p>"Old Secretary and headmasters, according to surveillance, there is a piece of good news..." Hurriedly, Zhuo Yi decided to change the subject.</p>

    <p>The old Secretary raised his eyebrows. "What news?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi replied truthfully, "According to surveillance, the fluctuation from the Gate Between Worlds which we detected before has now completely disappeared."</p>

    <p>"Disappeared?" The old Secretary widened his eyes.</p>

    <p>Then, with a delighted expression, he got up and patted Zhuo Yi on the shoulder. "Little Zhuozi... last time, it was the sudden recapture of the younger sister of the Master of Shadow Stream; this time, it's the bizarre disappearance of the fluctuation from the Gate Between Worlds... I wasn't wrong, you truly are a mascot!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>
