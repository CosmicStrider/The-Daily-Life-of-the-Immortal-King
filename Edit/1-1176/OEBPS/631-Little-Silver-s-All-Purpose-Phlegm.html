  <h1>Chapter 631 Xiao Yin's All-Purpose Phlegm</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Over a hundred invisible flying swords carrying the greatest pressure slammed down on the SUV. This batch of invisible flying swords had been specially customized by President Bai of the Demon Hunters Association. Lord Diulei's power of sight wasn't strong enough to see them, but this spectacular scene was completely laid out before Xiao Yin.</p>

    <p>"Wow! Look! Thunder! Meteor shower!" Xiao Yin couldn't help marveling.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Brother Xiao, now is not the time to admire it..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "But, but, there are hundreds of swords flying at us right now!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Over a hundred invisible flying swords fell from the sky like ten thousand arrows!</p>

    <p>Each of these flying swords was a deadly force at peak late Soul Formation stage. Just the two probing attacks earlier had nearly broken through the SUV's double defense. Now, over a hundred flying swords were aimed at a single target and directly bombarded it. The SUV's defense alone definitely wouldn't be able to withstand it.</p>

    <p>"I did it!"</p>

    <p>Elder Zuo Wu was excited; anyone would feel the same at the very moment you were about to get your revenge.</p>

    <p>But just when Elder Zuo Wu thought that his scheme was going to succeed, he suddenly saw the SUV's car window actually wind down.</p>

    <p>Were they going to jump out of the car?</p>

    <p>No...</p>

    <p>On the floating gourd, Elder Zuo Wu narrowed his eyes.</p>

    <p>Then, all of a sudden, he saw —</p>

    <p>The silver-haired young man in the passenger seat suddenly spat a mouthful of phlegm outside the window!</p>

    <p>Zuo Wu sneered. In his eyes, this was just futile resistance.</p>

    <p>A mouthful of phlegm?</p>

    <p>Apart from the silver-haired young man venting his despair, what else could the phlegm do?</p>

    <p>Elder Zuo Wu didn't believe that a mere mouthful of phlegm would be able to break his "Infinite Creation of Swords" formation.</p>

    <p>But the next moment, this silver sputum actually exploded in the air like a firework, directly spreading out in all directions!</p>

    <p>Elder Zuo Wu: "..."</p>

    <p>The moment those invisible flying swords touched the phlegm, they instantly crumbled and completely dissolved.</p>

    <p>Elder Zuo Wu: "???"</p>

    <p>How could this be?</p>

    <p>Elder Zuo Wu cried out in his heart.</p>

    <p>The destructive power of this mouthful of phlegm was too astonishing that he practically couldn't stop blustering in his heart, but before he could react, two more silver globs of phlegm flew out of the window on the passenger side and exploded in the sky instantly.</p>

    <p>"It's over."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin smiled. The moment the silver phlegm exploded, the flying swords in the sky were all wiped out like in Minesweeper.</p>

    <p>Elder Zuo Wu was utterly shaken and his mouth couldn't drop open any bigger. There was a storm in his heart and his expression at that moment was one of utter shock - it was an expression he had never worn before in his life.</p>

    <p>Damn it!</p>

    <p>His attack had actually been neutralized so easily, shit!</p>

    <p>He had just lost two hundred once-off peak Soul Formation stage invisible flying swords!</p>

    <p>It looked like he would have to use the Itinerant Immortal invisible flying swords!</p>

    <p>Actually, Elder Zuo Wu had selfishly wanted to keep some of the once-off invisible flying swords. President Bai had given him a total of six hundred once-off flying invisible swords, two hundred of which were at peak late Soul Formation stage, two hundred at early Itinerant Immortal stage and another two hundred at late Itinerant Immortal stage! Elder Zuo Wu's balls would really hurt if they were all used up here.</p>

    <p>But just as Elder Zuo Wu grit his teeth and was about to launch a second and more powerful attack, a figure suddenly appeared in front of him, and his expression instantly turned stiff.</p>

    <p>"You!" Elder Zuo Wu's lips twitched. He was sitting on the floating gourd in an independent and isolated space; he should have been completely hidden!</p>

    <p>But Elder Zuo Wu had overlooked one thing, and that was Xiao Yin's power of perception, which was beyond his imagination.</p>

    <p>Not only could Xiao Yin's phlegm melt the invisible flying swords, it could be used as a reverse tracker.</p>

    <p>Through the vibrations and the overall strength of the invisible flying swords, the silver phlegm which was linked to Xiao Yin's sensory nerves could determine the approximate location which the swords had come from.</p>

    <p>However, it could only determine the general point of origin of those swords because Elder Zuo Wu was currently in an independent and isolated space. Therefore, even though the distance between them was very close, Xiao Yin couldn't touch Elder Zuo Wu.</p>

    <p>This was a clone, which couldn't see Elder Zuo Wu.</p>

    <p>After confirming that the other party couldn't find him, Elder Zuo Wu eventually relaxed, but this scene still left him in a cold sweat.</p>

    <p>The question was, how on earth had the other party sensed him?</p>

    <p>Elder Zuo Wu was very puzzled.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Because he was unable to get out of the SUV, Xiao Yin created a clone to fight it out with Elder Zuo Wu of the Demon Hunters Association. This person's overall strength was much weaker than that of Mr Lu, and was of no comparison at all. One clone was thus enough to deal with Elder Zuo Wu.</p>

    <p>The only tricky part was that the other party was hiding himself in a space, which Xiao Yin had guessed was the case at the very beginning.</p>

    <p>Additionally, it was obvious that this wasn't the other party's own ability; it was very likely that President Bai had bestowed this technique on this member of the Demon Hunters Association.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin raised his eyebrows. He was in a hurry to get to Master's house and he didn't want to make a single mistake.</p>

    <p>But the issue was, what on earth should he do in this situation?</p>

    <p>What would Master do?</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin reflected on the question.</p>

    <p>At this time, he suddenly remembered that he had already signed the contract!</p>

    <p>He should be able to get Master to lend him a hand!</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin remembered one condition that was clearly written in the spirit beast (holy beast) contract — when necessary, a contract beast could use the power of the contract to call on its owner for help.</p>

    <p>It seemed that he hadn't used the power of the contract even once yet!</p>

    <p>Suddenly, Xiao Yin's lips curved in a smirk; he was dying to test how strong the power of the contract was.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elder Zuo Wu's hair stood up all over his body at the sight of this silver-haired young man's sly smirk.</p>

    <p>He was sure that this silver-haired young man couldn't see him, but the problem was... what was up with that innocent smile? Elder Zuo Wu didn't quite understand, but in the next moment, he suddenly saw this silver-haired young man actually lower his eyelids and put his hands together in prayer, as if he was calling on something.</p>

    <p>Roughly several dozen seconds later, Elder Zuo Wu's expression changed dramatically and his entire body tensed up despite himself.</p>

    <p>"What is this?!" Because at that very moment, he felt powerful spiritual pressure pushing down and his entire body jolted so that it felt like his qi and blood were flowing backward!</p>

    <p>This extremely strong spiritual pressure squeezed the small space he was in, and his eyes turned bloodshot right away.</p>

    <p>The next second, Elder Zuo Wu saw a hand, which seemed to belong to a youngster.</p>

    <p>This hand was white as jade, with defined and incomparably exquisite finger bones, and completely at odds with the powerful sense of oppression it carried. All of a sudden, it broke through the space wall and reached out to grab Elder Zuo...</p>
