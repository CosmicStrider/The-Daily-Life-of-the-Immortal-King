  <h1>Chapter 272 This Is What a Big Shot Is Probably Like... </h1>

  <div>

    <p>The space shook violently, causing dust to fall from the ceiling.</p>

    <p>Familiar light brown sword light shone forth from the crack, directly illuminating the whole space.</p>

    <p>Under normal circumstances, spirit swords were invisible to ordinary people, and Lie Mengmeng couldn't see them at all. But Jingke was very special, because it was originally a peach wood sword, the kind used for warding off evil and which could be found everywhere on the market.</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang had only just found out about this, and was utterly astounded.</p>

    <p>"Lord... Lord Jingke!" The instant he saw Jingke appear, his voice trembled.</p>

    <p>He was extremely excited and also amazed at Wang Ling's strength... What kind of power was this, that could tear a seam in this completely sealed space and forcefully summon a spirit sword?</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang felt that this was already beyond his realm of understanding.</p>

    <p>The instant Jingke had been summoned, Thunder had obligingly knocked Lie MengMeng out with a light tap to the acupuncture point in his neck.</p>

    <p>Ordinary people were completely unable to withstand the mental pressure produced when a spirit sword was summoned through a tear in space; this wasn't a physical attack that a pair of long johns or long underwear could block.</p>

    <p>If Lie Mengmeng were to suffer residual effects from this, he would very likely come down with dementia later in life.</p>

    <p>"Too strong..." Seeing Wang Ling grasp Jingke firmly as sword qi continued to pour out with a roar, Luo Chuang's cheeks couldn't stop quivering.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>This aura vanished as swiftly as it had appeared. Luo Chuang felt that Jingke was just too cool, and that its rapport with Ling Zhenren wasn't an ordinary one.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling held Jingke in his hand, their auras merged into one, and gave off a sense of unity between heaven and man â€” this was a realm higher than unity between man and sword!</p>

    <p>"When will I ever have rapport with a magic treasure as close as the one between Lord Jingke and Ling Zhenren..." Luo Chuang blinked, his heart full of envy. After all, this was something you couldn't look for, and which only happened through serendipity. Luo Chuang had collected as well as made a lot of magic treasures, but rapport with a magic treasure wasn't something that could be achieved simply by making one.</p>

    <p>The rapport between a spirit sword and its master was a very profound subject. To use a common analogy, Luo Chuang felt that it was just like choosing a daughter-in-law in ancient times by studying her horoscope.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After ten breaths or so, the air was finally completely calm.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling pointed Jingke at the array pattern on the floor.</p>

    <p>He was about to slice through it when the array pattern seemed to come to life and move on its own.</p>

    <p>"Not good, the spirit of the array pattern is awake and is planning to escape!" Luo Chuang immediately shouted. Apart from being very complicated, this type of array created by an Itinerant Immortal would more often than not have an array spirit. In order to maintain the security and stability of the array, the array spirit would move the core array pattern around every once in a while.</p>

    <p>But the array spirit had now awakened earlier than expected...</p>

    <p>"Want to destroy me? It's not that easy! I was created by the nomological laws of this space; as long as I don't want to die, I won't!" The array spirit laughed proudly.</p>

    <p>This type of large magic array wasn't a small matter to begin with. Coupled with an illusion spell and multiple parallel spatial dimensions, this was an advanced spatial magic array, so its array spirit naturally wasn't some common thing.</p>

    <p>Just then, that array pattern which had been carved into the floor of the room transformed into a dragon-like specter which suddenly rose up to dart out the door.</p>

    <p>It was too fast, like leaping lightning, and Lord Diulei and Luo Chuang's eyes couldn't follow it at all.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't look away; he merely frowned, and then stamped down directly with one foot.</p>

    <p>Before it could dash out of the door, this array spirit was trapped neatly under Wang Ling's foot.</p>

    <p>"Ah!"</p>

    <p>It was just the last bit of the array pattern that had been stepped on, like a little tail, but the array spirit was dumbstruck when it realized that it actually couldn't move any further...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was already faster than the array spirit had imagined, and the strength in his one foot was enough to nail it firmly to the floor.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, for this spirit to be able to drive such a large magic array, it's definitely anything but ordinary! It would be great if you can take it alive!" Lord Diulei suddenly opened his mouth.</p>

    <p>The value of an array spirit at the level of an Itinerant Immortal was truly immeasurable.</p>

    <p>Activating an array normally required an array flag and the array maker to be present. In the absence of the array maker, however, an array spirit could be used to replace them. But subduing a powerful array spirit was just like trying to conquer heaven, since it was the product of nomological powers; the principle of its creation was somewhat similar to the birth of a sword spirit.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, there had been very few arrays since ancient times that could spawn array spirits of their own accord.</p>

    <p>However, Lord Diulei's words came too late...</p>

    <p>Once Wang Ling had made his move, he hadn't had the slightest intention of leaving this array spirit alive.</p>

    <p>He hated anything that disturbed his quiet life.</p>

    <p>Whether it was the main manipulator behind the scenes or the array spirit in front of him, they were all the same.</p>

    <p>Since he wanted to live a peaceful life, he hence didn't need to consider what would happen after. Whether this spirit was strong or weak had nothing to do with him. From the beginning, Wang Ling's goal had always been to bring everyone out of the space safely.</p>

    <p>He raised his hand, and his spirit sword instantly started to glow...</p>

    <p>The brown sword light which enveloped Jingke's body wasn't bright, and instead was quite soft. Nevertheless, the sense of oppression contained within this muted glow was very real.</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang just thought that Jingke was really handsome; there was nothing better than a gentle sword.</p>

    <p>Terrified, the array spirit could instinctively feel how dangerous the peach wood sword was, and it hurriedly opened its mouth and started to plead frantically. "Exalted Immortal, please let me go. It was I who failed to recognize your honored self..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't give it a second look, and directly swung his sword down.</p>

    <p>The spirit didn't even have time to scream when the sword directly pierced its body. In the next instant, its ghostly body together with the core array pattern that was concealed within it cracked open, smashed to smithereens.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling..."</p>

    <p>Seeing this scene, Lord Diulei and Luo Chuang couldn't help sucking in cold breaths.</p>

    <p>An array spirit at the level of an Itinerant Immortal, slashed just like that... Furthermore, it had died with just one swing.</p>

    <p>This was what a big shot was probably like...</p>

    <p>"..." Lord Diulei's heart hurt. If they had been able to subdue such a powerful array spirit, it could definitely have become a powerful errand boy!</p>

    <p>But soon after that, he relaxed, because Wang Ling had done nothing wrong.</p>

    <p>Since the beginning, he had always, always been this type of person...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>With the array spirit eliminated and the core array pattern destroyed, the game space began to fracture.</p>

    <p>A little sunlight permeated the dark space, and shone on Wang Ling's face...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei and Luo Chuang stood on the side and watched him. Maybe it was because they had just overcome a crisis, but they felt that Wang Ling's solemn face seemed a lot more at peace.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't say anything; he just picked up Lie Mengmeng next to him, put him over his shoulder, then walked toward the light step by step...</p>
