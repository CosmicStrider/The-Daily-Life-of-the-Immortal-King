  <h1>Chapter 746 Wang Ming Has Perished?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was in that moment that Ghost Head Blade realized that the soil in the real remains wasn't ordinary soil... When his metal body came into direct contact with it, it had almost corroded. Luckily he had quick reflexes, otherwise if he had remained underground a few seconds more, he really would have broken down!</p>

    <p>Once Ghost Head Blade learned that the soil was corrosive, he immediately switched tactics as he tried to attack Wang Ming in another way.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was now in a dangerous situation. He had overexerted himself using the Brain Deduction Technique, and was now in a weak state. It was a little like anemia since there wasn't enough blood going to his brain, so he didn't have enough qi and blood, was sweating all over, and his heart was racing... Wang Ming felt incredibly unwell for a moment, like a person who had suddenly stopped while sprinting.</p>

    <p>He did his best to regulate his breathing and control his heart rate. A regular qi-replenishing pill wouldn't do Wang Ming much good in this situation since this was an injury caused by a mental impact.</p>

    <p>"Brother Dark Fragrance, cover me!" At that moment, Night Chief's forces on the other side had already collapsed, and the only people who would be able to turn the situation around were Ghost Head Blade and Lord Anxiang.</p>

    <p>Among the Dark Network members, these two were the most difficult to deal with. Zhai Yin sensed the killing intent and immediately set up a blade formation around Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>"Cell Proliferation Spell!" Lord Anxiang clasped his hands together in a spell, and white cells instantly sprung up on Ghost Head Blade's pitch-black blade. These cells were like bacteria that rapidly multiplied on his body in an unending stream until they actually formed extremely tough cell armor that could regenerate continuously.</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade didn't need to worry about anything else and just needed to dash forward -</p>

    <p>his target was Wang Ming!</p>

    <p>This scene made the head of state's heart sink. He stretched out his hands, intent on blocking the attack, but in the next moment, Lord Anxiang who had performed the "Cell Proliferation Spell" suddenly raised his hand and a purple light wave burst forth.</p>

    <p>Dynamic Light Wave?</p>

    <p>The head of state stared at Lord Anxiang, whose eyes had changed as his aura swelled sharply, completely different to before.</p>

    <p>The head of state stopped and slowly focused. "Who is it..."</p>

    <p>President Qi also fell into deep thought at this scene in the Huaxiu Alliance command center as he recalled an advanced spell called Cell Assimilation Spell.</p>

    <p>This was a type of spirit technique similar to ghost possession. As long as you had obtained the DNA beforehand, this spell could be used to possess a body at long range. The usual possession technique had a cast range and the two bodies couldn't be too far apart, but the Cell Assimilation Spell could ignore the restriction on distance, and was only constrained by time.</p>

    <p>Possession through the Cell Assimilation Spell usually could only last for five minutes at the very most.</p>

    <p>This Lord Anxiang was initially a biological scientist, and he was extremely thorough in his cell research. He had even mastered a spell like the Cells At Work Spell and it couldn't be any simpler for him to cast the Cell Assimilation Spell.</p>

    <p>"Who has possessed this man?" General Yi asked.</p>

    <p>President Qi sighed and said in a profound voice, "Judging from the current situation, I think the leader behind Night Chief... is the only one who can stand up to His Excellency Head of State..."</p>

    <p>President Qi now finally realized...</p>

    <p>It turned out that Night Chief had planned all this.</p>

    <p>From the Sea And Sky Array to Night Ghost Spirit Emperor making a move himself, everything had gone according to their plan.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor successfully possessed Dark Fragrance's body through the Cell Assimilation Spell which the latter had cast. This was quite a memorable occasion for him, because it was his first confrontation with Huaxiu's head of state.</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor sneered as he stared at the head of state. "Your Excellency's trick was pretty good. That humanoid magic treasure almost fooled me, and your scheme might have succeeded."</p>

    <p>A showdown between experts didn't require any extraneous actions at all. Facing each other at a distance, it looked like they weren't doing anything, but they were in fact tussling in the dark.</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor's intention was very clear. Knowing that there was a time limit to the body possession, he was here to deliberately stall for time.</p>

    <p>In this situation, the head of state couldn't spare any strength at all to go and rescue Wang Ming. It was now up to Zhai Yin and the other lead teachers to keep Wang Ming safe.</p>

    <p>"Move aside." The head of state looked at Night Ghost Spirit Emperor with a profound gaze as he released terrifying pressure.</p>

    <p>"If Your Excellency can step past my venerable self first, I will step aside." Night Ghost Spirit Emperor chuckled.</p>

    <p>He was fearless. Both of them were True Immortals. Judging from the initial clash of their auras, the head of state was certain that Night Ghost Spirit Emperor's strength was on par with his. If they fought in these real remains, it would be a disaster... Furthermore, this was the first time Night Ghost Spirit Emperor was facing an enemy while possessing a body; revealing too much of himself wouldn't be a good thing.</p>

    <p>"Unfortunately..."</p>

    <p>Just then, Night Ghost Spirit Emperor sighed suddenly. "Unfortunately, the humanoid magic treasure which Your Excellency sent had such good defenses, and self-destructed before we had time to analyze it... Otherwise, my venerable self would have liked to study it properly, and then send it back in a Didi spirit car. In any case, it was just a shitty old man robot that wasn't at all good-looking; even if some Didi spirit car drivers are beasts, they probably wouldn't go so far as to do anything to an old man."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, the head of state's face darkened a little.</p>

    <p>He did his best to keep his composure, knowing that the other side was trying to provoke him into making a move.</p>

    <p>For a moment, the showdown between the two experts was at a deadlock.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, under the cover of the Cell Proliferation Spell cast by Night Ghost Spirit Emperor and Dark Fragrance, Ghost Head Blade's way forward was unimpeded.</p>

    <p>The pressure that Zhai Yin gave off was tremendous. The teachers who had remained behind weren't as strong as her and lacked combat experience. They had no idea what to do in the face of this type of ruffian rushing toward them.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, most of the teachers had gone to attack the core array pattern after receiving Wang Ming's coordinates. As long as the Sea And Sky Array had yet to disappear, the real remains would continue to be in danger of being wantonly destroyed.</p>

    <p>"Space Slash!" Ghost Head Blade rushed forward at the speed of light!</p>

    <p>The instant he drew near, Zhai Yin's expression abruptly changed.</p>

    <p>It was actually the Space Slash...</p>

    <p>This was a pure suicide attack blade technique! Zhai Yin hadn't expected Ghost Head Blade, who had still been making noise earlier about wanting a host, to actually turn around and use such a deadly blade technique!</p>

    <p>"Let's go to hell together..." Ghost Head Blade gave a cold, dark laugh as the blade cut through the air and directly pierced Zhai Yin's body.</p>

    <p>But contrary to Ghost Head Blade's expectations, it seemed that Zhai Yin hadn't been hit...</p>

    <p>Her body appeared on the other side.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin had been saved by Wang Ming's Brain Deduction Technique!</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade was flustered, but didn't pause in his attack. Just as he was about to cut Wang Ming open, Wang Ming suddenly grabbed his head and let out a pained yell.</p>

    <p>The next moment, a round black hole rose up from the crown of Wang Ming's head...</p>

    <p>With a powerful force, Wang Ming and Ghost Head Blade were sucked into the black hole.</p>
