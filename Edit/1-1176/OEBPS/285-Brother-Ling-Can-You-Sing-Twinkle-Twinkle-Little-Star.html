  <h1>Chapter 285 Brother Ling, Can You Sing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star? </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Everyone was instantly stupefied at Dharmaraja's sudden dirty joke.</p>

    <p>Even Cailian Zhenren, who had been an old female driver in the cultivation circle for decades, couldn't help shuddering.</p>

    <p>It went without saying that this amorous talk was beyond anything anyone could take, and the Soul Formation cultivators who were present were transfixed with horrified fascination.</p>

    <p>Two Waterfalls Entering Holes... what kind of operation was this?</p>

    <p>"Why's everyone struck dumb? Was my name not good enough?" Dharmaraja waved his hands helplessly. They were all grown-ups, what did it matter if they talked a little dirty? "Actually, I have even more impressive suggestions. Want to hear it?"</p>

    <p>"Shut your mouth, you horndog!"</p>

    <p>Before Wang Ling and Fang Xing could say anything, Lord Diulei and the others all yelled in unison.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>By then, the spatial wall had been blast open by the energy beam from the Heavenly Eye. The opening was over a meter in size, enough for a person to go through. Its burnt border gave off an unpleasant, scorched smell.</p>

    <p>Staring at this opening, Wang Ling frowned slightly. "..."</p>

    <p>He had thought that his beam would be able to completely blast open this spatial wall, and he had never thought that it would only be enough to create this man-sized opening. Although Lord Diulei and the others thought that this was incredible enough, Wang Ling wasn't satisfied.</p>

    <p>It was becoming more and more difficult to deal with the enemies that they were starting to encounter now.</p>

    <p>As he sighed in his heart, he involuntarily touched the talisman seal wrapped around his right arm. He didn't know if he would have to remove it one day, but he prayed that the day would never come.</p>

    <p>"Let's go, it wasn't easy for Brother Ling to burn open this passage. Also, be on your guard at all times," Lord Diulei said as he gazed at this invisible yet clearly present barrier after giving it careful thought.</p>

    <p>After all, the Ice Crystal Array was a holy array which was superior to the Five Elements Great Array that had been used to seal the old devil back then. Furthermore, its array spirit most likely had the independent ability to protect itself; it was very likely that any intruders who entered this space would be scattered by the array's power.</p>

    <p>It happened just as Lord Diulei had expected.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was the first to step into the space, and the view in front of him changed swiftly — the space reversed itself, like an inverted mirror. In the distance, Wang Ling could see that the road sign for "Sanyuan Road" now showed "Road Sanyuan."</p>

    <p>By the time he was on the ground again, he had already confirmed that this was the mirror space that had been set up by the Ice Crystal Array.</p>

    <p>In front of him, a young man in white landed steadily.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei had just happened to be dropped into the same space as Wang Ling. Looking at the view in front of him, he couldn't help swearing loudly with astonishment.</p>

    <p>At that moment, the initially bare Sanyuan Road was now crowded with a dazzling line-up of all kinds of palaces, some of which were even floating in the air like heavenly immortal residences. Just standing on the roadside, the both of them could already see dozens of sky palaces and numerous cultivation facilities nearby.</p>

    <p>These buildings were made out of complex materials; each brick was packed full of spirit energy and had the ability to restore itself — all of these weren't ordinary things.</p>

    <p>"This Immortal Mansion... they're so fucking rich!" Lord Diulei couldn't help cursing in his heart. Anyone would be jealous of such luxuries.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei recalled a story: In ancient times, a poor man survived after falling into a valley, and found a village beneath it called Golden Village. From the stele at the village entrance to the tiles on the buildings, even the piles of straw in everyone's backyards; they were all made of gold... Now, Lord Diulei felt like he had fallen into Golden Village.</p>

    <p>Because they were in the mirror world, everything was reversed; even the clouds in the sky moved differently. However, time passed at the same rate as in the outside world.</p>

    <p>The young man in white looked up at the sky. It was now dusk, and it was growing dark.</p>

    <p>Strangely, the moment the stars came out, it was like a river that flooded the entire horizon.</p>

    <p>The young man in white pointed at the sky. "Brother Ling, look, there are so many stars!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Before long, the young man in white slowly dropped his hand.</p>

    <p>Because he noticed that these stars seemed to be swiftly growing in size at a visible rate...</p>

    <p>It wasn't his imagination, right?</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei drew in a deep breath.</p>

    <p>Then, he opened his eyes again.</p>

    <p>The stars which had been the size of sesame seeds earlier were now as large as millstones...</p>

    <p>They weren't damn stars at all!</p>

    <p>They were fucking spirit bodies that had been activated by the holy array!</p>

    <p>It was only when those luminous "stars" came closer that Lord Diulei realized what they actually were — they were soul-like, transparent spiritual bodies that nonetheless radiated light.</p>

    <p>As these array guardian spirits dropped from the sky, they coalesced together rapidly and finally formed a giant array guardian spirit beast which stood directly in front of Wang Ling and Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>It was a large, glowing fish with two feet and two heads, and a mouth packed full of shark teeth. When it landed on the ground, it began snarling wildly, the two long whiskers on either sides of its mouth fluttering aggressively in the wind.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei's lips twitched... Was this array guardian spirit a Pisces?!</p>

    <p>...Fine, it wasn't the time to think about this now.</p>

    <p>Without saying anything, Lord Diulei directly threw a Skybomb Grenade into its mouth, and there was a sound of an explosion. In the end, this colossal fish felt nothing at all; it just stupidly opened its mouth and puffed out thick smoke.</p>

    <p>"This array guardian spirit is at Itinerant Immortal level at the very least." Lord Diulei frowned. After all, the mirror space was a product of the holy array; it made sense to have a guardian spirit at Itinerant Immortal level! The most troublesome thing about this guardian spirit was its thick and rough skin, coupled with its powerful ability to regenerate itself. There was no other option except to kill it in one strike.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>" Hou !"</p>

    <p>The two-headed fish roared loudly, its body glittering with starlight as each soul which was a part of it glowed.</p>

    <p>Looking at this giant fish, Lord Diulei felt very helpless, and in the end, he turned to Wang Ling for help. "Brother Ling, can you sing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star ?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at this giant fish for three seconds. "..."</p>

    <p>He sighed.</p>

    <p>Then, he pushed himself off his feet lightly and leapt upwards. Using his hand like a blade, he chopped this glowing giant fish into pieces.</p>

    <p>Hiss ...</p>

    <p>His attack didn't meet any resistance.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Lord Diulei clearly heard a resounding crack.</p>

    <p>One second earlier, this glowing giant fish had still been shrieking.</p>

    <p>Now, it had already become steamed fish head with chili peppers...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>
