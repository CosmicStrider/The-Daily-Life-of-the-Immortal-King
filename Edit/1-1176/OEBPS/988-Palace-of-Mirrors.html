  <h1>Chapter 988 Palace of Mirrors</h1>

  <div>

    <p>To swap out the Fate Dao mark and thereby break the order of fate - this was the solution the divine throne came up with.</p>

    <p>Since this bunch wasn't worried about dying because of the Fate Dao mark, their confidence just needed to be broken and they would naturally confess.</p>

    <p>The head of the black shadow men was bewildered and uncertain. He didn't doubt what the divine throne said at all. Based on the powerful divinity it was radiating, the head was aware that he wasn't this thing's match. The boost from the Fate Dao mark greatly increased their strength in combat, but what kind of hallowed thing was this divine chair?</p>

    <p>"Back then we were persecuted and remained buried in the earth for hundreds of years... It wasn't easy for us to come back to life, and we just want to serve our master and live well. Please don't cut off the only path we have," the head of the black shadow men begged after an internal struggle.</p>

    <p>"Very good."</p>

    <p>The divine throne laughed. "So tell me first: who on earth is the person who orchestrated this plan?"</p>

    <p>"His surname is Bai, Bai Youquan... He's our direct superior. We don't qualify to meet anyone else at a higher level," said the head.</p>

    <p>Bai Youquan?</p>

    <p>Wang Ming felt this name was a little familiar.</p>

    <p>He frowned. "I recall that before Bai Zhe was caught, didn't he have a son called Bai Youquan? He was an illegitimate child who died very young. According to Bai Zhe himself, when he carried his son around, he frequently treated him like a dumbbell to train his muscles. Once, he accidentally broke his own arm, and coupled with his Yin spiritual qi attribute, this Yin energy invaded the child's body and straightaway froze him to death at just several months old."</p>

    <p>"..." Everyone was astounded and never thought something like this could happen.</p>

    <p>As for why Bai Youquan could be resurrected, everyone no longer had any doubts after understanding the properties of Fate Dao.</p>

    <p>People who had already been dead for hundreds of years could be resurrected, to say nothing of Bai Zhe's child.</p>

    <p>Adding Wang Ming's strange dream to the mix, they could now confirm that the resurrection of President Bai Zhe and Devil Gut Fungus Lord in the dream was very likely true.</p>

    <p>Then, who was the person behind the scenes?</p>

    <p>Was it that white-haired young man who looked identical to Wang Ling?</p>

    <p>Now that they had proof related to the resurrection he saw in his dream, Wang Ming's heart couldn't help trembling.</p>

    <p>Who on earth was copying Wang Ling's face?</p>

    <p>He needed answers.</p>

    <p>"What's your name and what did you do before you were brought back to life?" The divine throne continued with its questions.</p>

    <p>"My, my name is Yu Zhong... before I was resurrected, I was a Chinese who grew up overseas, and I joined a foreign mercenary organization... I died in a battle between mercenaries."</p>

    <p>"Battle between mercenaries?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. Fights between mercenary cultivators are very common overseas. Most of them are vagrant cultivators, many of whom join mercenary organizations voluntarily as a way to make a living. A lot are duped into joining, initially wanting to make a quick buck, and only realizing after they joined how hard it is to get out... Although they make plenty of money, they don't dare use it in many situations," said Yu Zhong, this head of the black shadow men.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and the others all nodded when they heard this.</p>

    <p>The history of mercenary cultivators was quite complex. Wang Ling remembered that Lao Gudong had touched on this a little when talking about overseas history in history class.</p>

    <p>In many situations, these so-called mercenary organizations were set up in secret and didn't serve any country, but worked for themselves. Any nation could secretly hire them and commission them to carry out classified jobs.</p>

    <p>The mercenary organizations took a neutral stance: if there was a conflict in assignments, they would work for the highest bidder.</p>

    <p>Most of these unaffiliated vagrant cultivators were unregistered citizens, and no information on their identities could be found at all outside their circle.</p>

    <p>Therefore, there was no way to trace their identities after they died.</p>

    <p>"The situation is now very clear," said Guo Ping. "Most of these black shadow men were probably vagrant mercenaries hundreds of years ago, and their identities can't be traced. Even if we were to know their names now, there's nothing to investigate."</p>

    <p>"That's exactly it."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming nodded, and fixing his gaze on the head of the shadow men in front of him, he took out an electronic map and placed it before the latter. "I now need you to point out the location of your base."</p>

    <p>"The base is in the Palace of Mirrors. There's no way for me to point it out on this map of yours, but I can show you where the entrance is." After he said this, Yu Zhong pointed at a spot on the map, then begged, "But please, don't swap out our butts..."</p>

    <p>"You don't have to worry about that," said Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Soon, the interrogation was done.</p>

    <p>Star Lord of Divine Dao Star saw Wang Ling and the rest off from Star Lord's Palace.</p>

    <p>Before leaving, Wang Ming asked the divine throne curiously, "Will switching out their buttocks truly destroy the Fate Dao mark?"</p>

    <p>"Of course not. I have no idea how to do it, I simply made something up to scare him," answered the divine throne.</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Ten-odd minutes later, Wang Ling and the others appeared at the mouth of the secret alley to the Palace of Mirrors.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming had made ample preparations and had brought Wang Ling Two and Wang Ling One with him. He wore the newly-developed Two metal suit and Guo Ping the One metal suit; now, both of them had the strength to fight.</p>

    <p>There were people guarding the mouth of the alley. To avoid alerting the enemy, Wang Ling used his King's Eye to cover the scene so that what the guards saw was an image of the alley from an hour ago.</p>

    <p>This move allowed them to go completely unnoticed and was a lot more useful than an invisibility spell.</p>

    <p>That head of the black shadow men hadn't lied; when Wang Ling and the others entered the alley, they noticed the mouth on the wall.</p>

    <p>"How do we get in?" asked Guo Ping.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming used the Deduction Technique to go through several possibilities before saying, "You have to put your hand into the mouth and say the password. If it isn't right, it'll straightaway bite your arm off. I've yet to figure out what the password is, though..."</p>

    <p>"Don't bother."</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Ling stepped forward.</p>

    <p>Touching the big mouth on this stone wall, he simply directly thrust his hand inside, then pulled out a long red tongue.</p>

    <p>The stone mouth was caught completely unaware by Wang Ling's thrust - too deep! It was too deep down its throat! Its throat felt swollen from this thrust...</p>

    <p>" <em>Wuwuwu... </em>" the stone mouth cried; it had no eyes, so the tears poured out of the mouth.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling gazed at the stone mouth, his expression as calm as an ancient well. "Let us in."</p>

    <p>Stone mouth: " <em>Wuwuwu </em>... no, I can't..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling opened his dead fish eyes. "If not, I'll beat you to death."</p>

    <p>Stone mouth: "I'll open..."</p>
