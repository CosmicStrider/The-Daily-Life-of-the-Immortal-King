  <h1>Chapter 489 Mr Lu Meets Death Valiantly... </h1>

  <div>

    <p>He was the grand Wang Situ, with countless fans. How could he let other people find out that he was actually a fan of "Three Days And Two Sleeps"?</p>

    <p>Father Wang's writing career had been smooth so far. Once his first book entitled Let Go of That Wet Nurse was released online, the numbers had started to crush everyone else spectacularly. Even the god-level writer "Zhu Ge" on the website had been so pissed off that he had switched to another website...</p>

    <p>In all these years, Father Wang had felt that if he really had someone fated to be his opponent in the circle... it would probably be Three Days And Two Sleeps. From content alone, Father Wang thought that this person's story was very rich and interesting. It was a pity, however, that the story was being written too slowly, and because it often stopped updating, it never entered the rankings. If the updates were resumed at a steady rate, this person would definitely be a strong opponent.</p>

    <p>Given Father Wang's status in the circle, it wasn't too much to say that he was at the top level. He enjoyed access to various resources on the website, had comfortably substantial subscriptions, and received fan adulation. But in the end, one shouldn't be too arrogant. Lie Mengmeng thought Father Wang's mentality of staying vigilant in times of peace was pretty good.</p>

    <p>Back when he had learned that even the renowned "Wang Situ" Father Wang was a fan of Three Days And Two Sleeps, Lie Mengmeng had been very surprised. Of course, it was only Lie Mengmeng who knew this; for Father Wang, this was something that had to remain absolutely secret. It was in fact common for writers to be mutually competitive while they tooted each other's horns at the same time. But there were also quite a number of writers like Father Wang who would secretly worship a specific individual in particular.</p>

    <p>Father Wang turned on the voice modifier sound card as he planned to change and mask his voice slightly in the game later.</p>

    <p>Father Wang had Lord Diulei's chat account, so he immediately knew the latter's real identity. When he saw Lord Diulei call the person with the ID "Immortal Two" Brother Dog, Father Wang almost immediately guessed that this "Immortal Two" was his family's Er Ha...</p>

    <p>Question: What did it feel like to play PUBG with your family's own spirit beast?</p>

    <p>Father Wang had no good answer for the time being...</p>

    <p>At the very least, he would be a little more serious while playing the game.</p>

    <p>If he was really killed by his spirit beast with a 98K, he would lose so much face...</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang's custom mode had been set up and everyone entered the game one by one; it was about to start.</p>

    <p>Father Wang was glued to the screen.</p>

    <p>At that point, Lie Mengmeng suddenly asked, "What kind of person do you think this Three Days And Two Sleeps is?"</p>

    <p>"Apart from not updating every now and then, he should still be a pretty good person. Isn't he a stay-at-home dad? His kid is still so young, it certainly wouldn't be easy for him to type and watch his kid at the same time." Father Wang, like most people, had seen this author neglect his work in order to play live stream games.</p>

    <p>"I heard he's never been to an event. It would be great if I could meet him once at the annual meeting some day..."</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng was silent when he heard this.</p>

    <p>"What's the matter?"</p>

    <p>Father Wang suddenly thought that Lie Mengmeng didn't look well.</p>

    <p>"It's nothing..." Lie Mengmeng smiled slightly.</p>

    <p>Three Days And Two Sleeps's real identity wasn't that of a stay-at-home dad... The person who normally live streamed games wasn't Three Days And Two Sleeps at all, but the husband of the real "Three Days And Two Sleeps"!</p>

    <p>Yes!</p>

    <p>That was right!</p>

    <p>The real "Three Days And Two Sleeps"...</p>

    <p>Was in fact a woman!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The game was about to start. At that moment, a figure with a noble and gentlemanly temperament stopped outside the villa entrance, and Mr Lu fixed his gaze on the villa.</p>

    <p>The coordinates on the radar in his hand corresponded completely with the soul marker, which proved that this villa was the place he was looking for and that the green-furred dog was here.</p>

    <p>Based on the task President Bai had assigned him, he would kill the green-furred dog first and then go see the teenage-looking expert as described by the Lady.</p>

    <p>Mr Lu pressed his monocle, and a light instantly shot out. This was an infrared ray, and scanning the villa, he could already grasp its layout and where the people inside were. The infrared sensor told him that there were currently three people in the villa, and they were all in the basement.</p>

    <p>Then where was the dog?</p>

    <p>Mr Lu felt something wasn't right.</p>

    <p>Could it be... that the dog wasn't just a second-class one?</p>

    <p>Mr Lu frowned as he thought of a scenario that could precisely explain why Elder Han and Elder Canglan, who had been dispatched to kill this green-furred dog, hadn't been able to take it down.</p>

    <p>There was only one truth...</p>

    <p>That was that this green-furred dog's true realm was now at first class and it was even already capable of taking human form.</p>

    <p>But based on the infrared sensor alone, Mr Lu couldn't be certain which of the three was the green-furred dog in human form.</p>

    <p>How about getting rid of all three of them together?</p>

    <p>Mr Lu looked at the time.</p>

    <p>But then it would be too late... because he was about to get off work!</p>

    <p>In the end, the reason why Mr Lu had thrown his lot in with President Bai was because he was being paid handsomely per hour. Mr Lu had initially timed it just right; if he was dealing solely with the green-furred dog, he would still make it. But now that there were changes to the plan and he had to kill three people, it would definitely take more time.</p>

    <p>So Mr Lu stood at the entrance and sent President Bai a text message explaining the situation.</p>

    <p>President Bai replied in almost a second: Then kill them all, you'll get overtime pay...</p>

    <p>"Very well, President!"</p>

    <p>Having obtained further instructions, Mr Lu turned off his phone.</p>

    <p>He would do anything as long as he was paid enough overtime...</p>

    <p>Should he break in?</p>

    <p>Mr Lu gathered power in his fist, but very quickly he released it.</p>

    <p>He felt that it wasn't elegant.</p>

    <p>A villain should still be sophisticated.</p>

    <p>Maybe he should just ring the doorbell...</p>

    <p>The moment the door opened, he would rush in and eliminate all traces of these three people.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Just as Mr Lu was about to ring the doorbell, the subtle killing intent from when he had amassed power earlier in order to break down the door had drawn Wang Ling's attention in almost the same moment.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei took off his headphones. "Brother Ling, what's wrong?"</p>

    <p>Killing intent...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling turned his head and looked at the top right corner of the room, which was in the direction of the villa's main entrance.</p>

    <p>"It's demon qi!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin also stood up. As a holy beast, he had been born with an innate sensitivity to demon qi which was more acute than that of human priests!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at the game interface; it was already at the "ready" stage, and they couldn't stop at this point.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei looked at Xiao Yin and said, "Brother Xiao, Brother Ling and I are busy at the moment. It's time for you to step up!"</p>

    <p>"But! This demon qi is very strong! It's at least an Itinerant Immortal! I'm afraid I can't defeat it without Master!" Xiao Yin bit his lip. In fact, he wanted to fight with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Brother Xiao, don't be scared... you've eaten a crispy noodle snack, what the hell is there to be afraid of!"</p>
