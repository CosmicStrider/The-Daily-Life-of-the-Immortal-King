  <h1>Chapter 357 The Moment You Open the Delivery </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Teacher Ye's tragic experience confirmed one thing, and that was that the relationship between parents and teachers was far from as simple as it seemed. Although they started out the same in wanting the children to make progress, there were times when even the teachers had the urge to become hostile when they ran into unreasonable parents.</p>

    <p>Hu Su's mother was very notorious in Number 60 High School. Her son had toiled hard in Grade One's remedial class for four years, but still continued to repeat it, and she would make trouble daily. Almost everyone in the school had heard of her, but a few of the younger teachers who had only just been posted here, and had yet to become completely familiar with the "business," were still in the dark.</p>

    <p>Over the years, Headmaster Chen had tried all kinds of ways to have Hu Su withdraw from the school because of the problem with his mother. Hu Su wasn't an interim student, but was officially enrolled in Number 60 High School. Every year, the exams always took into account the total scores of the whole school, and every year, Hu Su's scores would drag the school down.</p>

    <p>At this critical juncture when Number 60 High School was on the cusp of being promoted as a key city high school, Headmaster Chen really didn't want anything to go wrong.</p>

    <p>However, there was a good saying that it was easy to invite the devil in, but hard to get rid of him...</p>

    <p>Number 60 High School had personally enrolled this student Hu Su. Although his parents were somewhat unreasonable, his living and study habits weren't bad, and he was an obedient and sensible person who often helped the teachers and his classmates... It was just that his scores couldn't improve no matter what! Actually, urging an official student to withdraw from school purely on the basis of their poor scores wasn't reasonable. Furthermore, if word of this got out, the school might be accused of "improper education."</p>

    <p>As a result, all the various ploys that circled around in Headmaster Chen's mind were thus scattered.</p>

    <p>The most painful part of the whole matter was that upon careful consideration, Hu Su's mother's words were actually quite reasonable... Once my child entered the school, he became an official student of your Number 60 High School, even if he's just in the remedial class. His living and study habits and his character are all very good, but his scores haven't improved at all. It's been a full four years, there hasn't been any progress at all... if it's not the school's fault, then whose fault is it?</p>

    <p>This made Headmaster Chen feel indescribably miserable.</p>

    <p>In the breakroom, Teacher Pan and the other old teachers took this opportunity to tell the new teachers all the stories about Hu Su and his mother; this bunch of younger teachers started to have deep misgivings about their jobs, when they had previously been looking forward to a career in education.</p>

    <p>It turned out that nowadays, it wasn't just doctors who could no longer save people...</p>

    <p>Neither could teachers...</p>

    <p>While they were chatting, Teacher Pan abruptly realized that Lao Gudong had disappeared. "Eh? Where's Old Wang?"</p>

    <p>One teacher replied, "It looks like the headmaster came looking for him just now. Old Wang also teaches the remedial class history; I heard that he's an old hand at comforting Hu Su's mother."</p>

    <p>Anyone who entered the workforce would feel that working wasn't easy - this was true of any profession. Apart from settling down and getting on with life, you also had to learn how to speak well and be on guard against people who could make things difficult for you.</p>

    <p>In this world, you had to learn to compromise.</p>

    <p>In the current era of national cultivation, many cultivators carried on with the same line of cultivation work, like Immortal Toya performing alchemy, and Luo Chuang running his metalware store and doing smithwork. The work was extremely complex, but also extremely lucrative. Most crucially, this was work which didn't depend on playing nice with other people.</p>

    <p>After persuading Hu Su's mother to leave, Lao Gudong leaned his fat body against a wall and pondered for a very long time... Actually, his reasons for deciding to become a teacher were very complicated.</p>

    <p>If he had to name one, it was because he thought that it was a very honorable profession.</p>

    <p>After he finished chewing a latiao in the hospital toilets, Lao Gudong felt much calmer. He then looked at the time and frowned a little... He had made an online purchase earlier, and the electronic receipt had indicated that it would be arriving in twenty minutes.</p>

    <p>Now that it was almost time, he was wondering whether he should go to the hospital's main entrance to receive the delivery, but just as he lifted his foot to step outside, there was a voice from the toilet cubicle next to him. "Excuse me, are you Mr Wang?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong was stunned.</p>

    <p>"...Yes, that's me."</p>

    <p>After he said that, Lao Gudong opened the toilet door, then saw a man dressed in diving gear crawl out of the squat toilet...</p>

    <p>Dripping wet, the man then bowed respectfully to Lao Gudong. "Shun Feng God Express! Mission accomplished guarantee!"</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong was still in a state of shock. "...How did you get in?"</p>

    <p>He had long heard that this Shun Feng God Express company currently had the most efficient express delivery team in the country; if you had goods that needed to be delivered ASAP within the same city, they would reach the customer under twenty minutes as long as the goods were marked 'urgent'! However, this was the first time that Lao Gudong was experiencing it for himself, and it was truly broadening his horizon.</p>

    <p>How had this courier gotten in, when outside was being so heavily guarded by the police? This was the magic question.</p>

    <p>The courier was panting. "There are too many police officers outside; sending this package was really not easy. After I took on this delivery, I drew a blueprint to figure out sir's coordinates, then I dug a tunnel from a park three hundred li away; using the bone-shortening technique, I entered the city's sewer system. Finally, after verifying your location, I found sir here. Mm, Mr Wang, after you've received the delivery, please be sure to give me a five-star comment!"</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong: "..."</p>

    <p>While he was speaking, the courier took out a square box from his storage space. "Your delivery, sir."</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong: "...It's not broken, is it?"</p>

    <p>The courier: "The box is waterproof, so it's not a problem. But whether the item inside is intact or not... it's hard to say."</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong: "I added insurance..."</p>

    <p>"Oh, of course. If the item is broken, we'll definitely refund you. But I don't in fact know whether the item inside the box is broken or not - it might be fine, it might not." The courier analyzed the situation seriously. "According to the theory of quantum mechanics, there is a possibility it could be broken and intact at the same time."</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong: "..."</p>

    <p>The courier: "It's only the moment when you open the box that these two possibilities will converge into one! This is that very famous theory called Schr√∂dinger's cat."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Lao Gudong almost fell to his knees. "I'm sorry, big brother, I'm wasting your time..."</p>

    <p>The courier nodded, unperturbed, and took out a grading device. "It's our job to answer any queries the customers might have. Will sir please evaluate my service? If there are any problems with the delivery, please tap on the feedback button at the bottom of the electronic receipt on the app, and we'll get someone to follow up on it!"</p>

    <p>The corners of Lao Gudong's mouth twitched, and he pressed the "Five Stars" button with shaking hands... were couriers nowadays all this awesome?</p>
