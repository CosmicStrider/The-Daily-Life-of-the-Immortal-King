  <h1>Chapter 42 Lao Gudong's Education Policy </h1>

  <div>

      <p>Wang Ling hadn't imagined that Lao Gudong would actually announce the news so quickly. Nowadays, there were plenty of lightning marriages <sup>1</sup> , but who knew that there were also so many lightning love affairs.</p>

      <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A 'lightning marriage' is to get married on the spur of the moment.)</dfn>

      <p>He felt it was probably because Lao Gudong had gone too long without love, so once he fell into the honey river of love, he couldn't pull himself out.</p>

      <p>It was very obvious that spring had arrived for Lao Gudong.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, Guo Hao had entered a chilly winter...</p>

      <p>Er Dan wasn't an ordinary parrot. This wasn't reflected just in its special ability, born from mixing various bloodlines together, but also in the fact that Er Dan had the ability to transform. While there was a very short time limit to how long it could maintain a human form, it was already more than enough time to teach Guo Hao a lesson.</p>

      <p>Especially when Er Dan saw a small bald patch amidst the spotless white feathers which it was so proud of, the result of that fucking fortune-telling...</p>

      <p>From afar, Wang Ling could already feel the low pressure emanating from Guo Hao's shoulder. Moreover, he heard Er Dan's thoughts again: whip, handcuffs, small candle...</p>

      <p>Sss ! — It was just three simple nouns, but it was more than enough for his imagination.</p>

      <p>He had never thought that even a bird could play such exciting games these days...</p>

      <p>A Lao Gudong in love was even more approachable than usual, and it should have been a stress-free spirit sword training session. However, firmly oppressed by Er Dan's icy cold spiritual pressure, Guo Hao couldn't be cheerful.</p>

      <p>The morale of this story was, if you are a pretentious prick, you will pay the price. If you want to show off in front of people, your bird will use candle wax on you behind the scenes... Wang Ling felt that this incident made a very good case for the "lead a low-key life" philosophy which Father and Mother Wang had instilled in him from a young age.</p>

      <p>For Wang Ling, this spirit sword training was predictably boring. What Lao Gudong was teaching was a very basic spirit sword beginner's course.</p>

      <p>In theory, at the Foundation Establishment stage, one was completely capable of flying a sword. However, Huaxiu nation's Education Department had made "flying a sword" a university-level course in the current education system.</p>

      <p>What most Foundation Establishment students could learn in high school was basic maintenance of their spirit swords and basic skills in flying a sword.</p>

      <p>Of course, as students of the elite class, they may also delve a little deeper into the content and learn things such as advanced sword skills and mental sword cultivation methods. However, these lessons still weren't any challenge for Wang Ling.</p>

      <p>A so-called true master, with a sword not in his hand, but in his heart, could use a blade of grass to cut down even the stars — this highest realm of swordsmanship had long faded into history and most people thought it was just a legend. However, Wang Ling felt that without the restraining effects of the Dao talisman seal, it wouldn't be difficult for him at all to cut the stars down with a blade of grass.</p>

      <p>The basic training for flying a sword mainly consisted of controlling their spirit swords to paint the figure "8" in the air. With his strength pulled back, Wang Ling carefully controlled his small wooden sword and tried his best to flunk the session, so that he didn't tear the roof off the gymnasium by mistake.</p>

      <p>In the end, based on Lao Gudong's strict grading system, Wang Ling was ranked fourth of the students present in proficiency at flying a sword.</p>

      <p>While fourth out of five people placed him in the bottom half, he was very satisfied with this ranking.</p>

      <p>The person in last place was Lin Xiaoyu. To begin with, parent and child swords weren't very easy to control and required a level of swordsmanship that was more than two times as difficult as wielding one sword. What was worse, she had gotten the genders of her two spirit swords wrong all these years... hence, though they had been together for a very long time, they had yet to establish real rapport between them.</p>

      <p>"If you go on like this, you'll get nowhere." Lao Gudong put his hands on his waist and sighed, feeling a slight headache.</p>

      <p>A Lao Gudong in love was somewhat more unusual than normal, but that didn't mean he had been idle in collecting data on the previous spirit sword exchange meet between Number 59 High School and Number 58 High School.</p>

      <p>On the surface, the students' levels in handling spirit swords appeared roughly the same among the three schools.</p>

      <p>In fact, Number 60 High School had an advantage, because Sun Rong's Mysterious Sea had already spawned a sword spirit. To quote a chuuni <sup>2</sup> saying, in all of the one hundred schools, a high school student who bred a sword spirit was a very rare and extremely fearful existence...</p>

      <dfn><sup>2</sup>("Chuuni" is short for the Japanese term "chuunibyou," which translates to 'second year of middle school sickness,' and describes teenagers going through a phase where they try to act cool or edgy.)</dfn>

      <p>However, the spirit sword exchange meet was a team event and employed a team grading system. If Number 60 High School wanted to emerge victorious in this exchange meet, apart from Sun Rong and Chen Chao, the two best performers currently, the other three people had to ensure that at the very least, they obtained a final average score or higher — it would only take one person holding them back to produce poor results.</p>

      <p>What was worth mentioning was that although Wang Ling was ranked fourth, his score was just above average, which Lao Gudong felt was really miraculous. For some reason, he felt that the person who had scored sixty points was somehow more skilled than the one who had scored full marks.</p>

      <p>Currently, it looked like it was just Lin Xiaoyu who was holding them back. Furthermore, her score was very discouraging. The city-wide average score in proficiency at flying a sword was sixty-five, but Lin Xiaoyu hadn't even reached the passing score.</p>

      <p>However, Lao Gudong was, after all, Lao Gudong. Headmaster Chen had sent him to lead this team, and even if this fatty who only knew how to eat snacks had now been blessed with luck in love, his teaching prowess was beyond question.</p>

      <p>After that, the other students left the gym except for Lin Xiaoyu. There were still two more hours before dinner, which was supposed to be free time, but Lin Xiaoyu had to do extra training.</p>

      <p>"Teacher, am I hopeless?" This fujoshi was obviously very upset, her head hanging low. Lin Xiaoyu felt that flying a sword had become the second most painful thing in her life, after her father burning her gay fanfiction.</p>

      <p>Girls had thin skin <sup>3</sup> , so Lao Gudong would always give them face. If it had been Teacher Pan, she would have long broken out into cursing, resentful that a student didn't live up to her expectations, and she would have used various radical ways to stimulate the students' adrenal gland hormones.</p>

      <dfn><sup>3</sup>(To have 'thin skin' is naturally the opposite of having 'thick skin,' and means to be sensitive or easily upset.)</dfn>

      <p>However, every teacher had their own teaching style.</p>

      <p>This method of berating students in order to spur them into action did not suit Lao Gudong's gentle image at all. Furthermore, this was a Lao Gudong who was in love; it was even less likely for him to criticize a schoolgirl who was suffering disappointment in her studies.</p>

      <p>Compared with Teacher Pan's method of goading, Lao Gudong was better at giving encouragement.</p>

      <p>Additionally, he was very good at applying the right fix to any situation.</p>

      <p>Flying a pair of parent and child swords was indeed more difficult than flying a single sword, but the principle was the same. One just needed to memorize a few more of the original basic formulas. For students in the elite class, memorizing something had never been a problem, especially for Lin Xiaoyu, who was a top student.</p>

      <p>Therefore, Lao Gudong felt that it wasn't that Lin Xiaoyu couldn't learn, but that she wasn't absorbing the lesson. Additionally, he could tell that she was feeling rather depressed.</p>

      <p>In fact, the pile of treasured gay fanfiction burned several days ago was the main reason for Lin Xiaoyu's bad mood. But Lao Gudong had no idea about this situation at all, so he could only judge based on his years of experience and his own observations.</p>

      <p>After all, secretly investigating a student's private affairs would be too much like the actions of a pervert...</p>

      <p>In situations like this, Lao Gudong had a lot of relevant methods for solving this type of difficult problem.</p>

      <p>In any case, he just needed to give the right type of encouragement for the student in question.</p>

      <p>A spirit light glowed in Lao Gudong's hand as he conjured up a book which he had prepared beforehand, and he gave it to Lin Xiaoyu. "I hope Student Lin will enjoy this book. The names of the protagonists are very similar to those of your parent and child swords."</p>

      <p>Curiously, Lin Xiaoyu took the book and saw on the cover four very elegant-looking words: Founder of Evil Sorcery...</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>Actually, before the spirit sword training and in line with his encouragement approach, Lao Gudong had very considerately prepared a gift for each student early on as an emergency incentive.</p>

      <p>For Sun Rong, he had written a list of Wang Ling's favorite snacks.</p>

      <p>For Chen Chao, he had prepared a dumbbell with a gravity system so that he could control its weight at will.</p>

      <p>For Guo Hao, he had prepared a little book in which he had recorded all the student gossip which only he knew.</p>

      <p>For Wang Ling, he had prepared a packet of the just released stir-fried swamp eel-flavored crispy noodle snack...</p>
