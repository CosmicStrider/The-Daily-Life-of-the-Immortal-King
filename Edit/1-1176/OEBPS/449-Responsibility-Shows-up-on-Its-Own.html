  <h1>Chapter 449 Responsibility... Shows up on Its Own! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Evil Sword God might have been captured, but the incident was suppressed in the end given his identity. As for the unusual large-scale blackout and the malfunctioning electronic equipment in the area, Songhai city's Electricity Department ultimately took responsibility for it. A notice about the accident was posted the following day which explained that it had happened because of faulty equipment; in the end, only those who had been personally involved knew what had actually happened.</p>

    <p>That night, not long after Evil Sword God was detained, Zhuo Yi received two phone calls.</p>

    <p>The first was from his old leader, Secretary Dakang.</p>

    <p>"Hello, Little Zhuozi..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi had already gone from being overwhelmed at hearing the old secretary's intimate address in the beginning to being completely used to it.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi nodded. "Yes, it's me, secretary."</p>

    <p>On the other end of the phone, Secretary Dakang said in a somewhat meaningful tone, "I've always thought since before that you have experts hiding around you... <em>Hehe </em>, you've completely exposed yourself when catching this Evil Sword God this time."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi's mind went blank when he heard this; if <em>shifu </em>knew that he hadn't taken responsibility for this incident, he would definitely hate him!</p>

    <p>"Secretary Dakang, it's not like that..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was about to explain when Secretary Dakang's voice came over the phone. "Don't be afraid," he said. As long as you're dedicated to society, I don't care whether you have one expert or two experts around. But for that senior you invited to be able to catch Evil Sword God, his strength is certainly not ordinary. Perhaps he is in no way weaker than me or Old Yi."</p>

    <p>"Secretary, I..."</p>

    <p>"It's fine, you don't have to explain. I understand you."</p>

    <p>On the other end of the line, Secretary Dakang nodded slightly and said slowly, "Everyone has secrets; no one can live without them. You bring honor to our education field and you are now a role model for all children. I have to thank you for that... Later, if you get a call from Old Yi, you can straightaway direct him to me and say that I was the one who invited the senior behind you so that he doesn't start talking behind your back..."</p>

    <p>"..." Listening over the phone, Zhuo Yi suddenly felt a little addled.</p>

    <p>Something that had seemed impossible to explain had actually been inexplicably resolved?</p>

    <p>"Given Old Yi's character, I'm guessing that once he finds out about this, he'll definitely make the trip to Songhai city, and will even call you. What's more important is that we sort out what we should say first, since Old Yi this person is very shrewd."</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, Secretary Dakang couldn't help laughing out loud. "Previously, he, Old Jiang and I made a bet to see who could catch that Chen Nanxuan first. In the end, who would have ever thought that the result would be me winning by default! Little Zhuozi, you've given me face again!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>Secretary Dakang: "Also, you handled the particulars very well this time. You immediately suppressed the media and didn't alert them. It's still better to leave Evil Sword God to Old Yi himself to handle."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Little Zhuozi, don't worry. Although there won't be any media coverage on this incident, you will certainly receive plenty of internal commendations. If you are promoted to our Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools in the future and Old Yi is willing to put in a good word for you, that will carry a lot of weight."</p>

    <p>"Very well, secretary..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi thanked him, hung up the phone, and then couldn't help taking out a handkerchief from his pocket to wipe at his sweat.</p>

    <p><em>A man sits at home and responsibility falls from heaven...</em></p>

    <p>As it turned out, he had been powerless from the start to decide for himself whether to shoulder this responsibility or not - because it had been decreed by fate, falling from the sky!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It wasn't long after Secretary Dakang's call that the phone rang once again in Zhuo Yi's staff apartment. It was an unknown number, but Zhuo Yi knew when he saw the call that it was most likely from General Yi.</p>

    <p>Actually, he and General Yi had met once before at the combined military training for six schools, but General Yi hadn't been familiar with him at that time.</p>

    <p>This was a founding father, a legendary existence who had battled demon gods with his own strength, and who was already actually calmly indifferent to a lot of things. It was impossible for a junior to try and curry favor with him.</p>

    <p>So this phone call was in fact an opportunity.</p>

    <p>But Zhuo Yi's top priority at present was to shoulder the responsibility <em>shifu</em>had given him - keeping <em>shifu </em>happy was the most important thing. While he hadn't been able to learn anything from <em>shifu </em>yet, Zhuo Yi felt that it was only a matter of time, given their master and disciple relationship.</p>

    <p>He had been well aware of this from the very beginning.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi picked up the phone. Compared with Secretary Dakang, who typically sounded like an old-fashioned matchmaker, General Yi's voice sounded much deeper and more solemn. "Are you... Zhuo Yi?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi nodded. "I am..."</p>

    <p>On the other end of the phone, General Yi was silent for a bit before he asked, "Is Dakang your <em>shifu </em>?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "General Yi, you misunderstand... we only have a leader and subordinate relationship."</p>

    <p>General Yi couldn't help tsking. "Then why does he treat you like a disciple? If this old man hadn't thoroughly checked you out, I would have almost thought you were his illegitimate child."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi's face twitched. "..."</p>

    <p>Getting down to business, General Yi cleared his throat. "This old man got a phone call from him just now saying that you caught my junior brother, after he's been on the run for so many years - is that true?"</p>

    <p>In fact, the moment he had received the phone call, General Yi hadn't dared believe it, because no one knew his junior brother better than he did.</p>

    <p>Vicious and merciless, cutting people down like grass, and murdering his own<em>shifu </em>back then - during that time, his junior brother's strength had already been very terrifying, and to be caught suddenly after disappearing for several hundred years made General Yi very suspicious.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi took a breath and said very seriously, "General Yi, the news that Evil Sword God has been arrested is true. We have already collected the Heaven-Cleaving sword he was holding as evidence, you can come and verify it for yourself."</p>

    <p>"Very well, this old man will be able to tell with one glance whether it's the genuine thing or not. I'm leaving for Songhai city tomorrow... I'll find out for myself then."</p>

    <p>On the other end of the line, General Yi said, "But this old man still has a question."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "General, say it, please..."</p>

    <p>General Yi: "I heard that you are the leader directly in charge of this matter, so would it be possible for you to tell this old man... how was my stupid junior brother defeated? I hope you won't try to dupe me... This old man has already put a curse on this phone call; if you have something to hide, every time it rains in the next six months, you'll experience an unbearable itch."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>To be honest, this question made Zhuo Yi sigh in relief, because General Yi had asked how Evil Sword God had been defeated and not who had defeated him.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi felt it was completely okay as long as he didn't expose Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi actually hadn't seen the battle with his own eyes, but had heard all about it from Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>General Yi just wanted to hear the truth, right...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi recalled what Lord Diulei had said about the battle and replied, "Erm... General Yi, it went like this...</p>

    <p>"He was first given two slaps..."</p>

    <p>"Mm..."</p>

    <p>"After that, he was stabbed with a magic sword..."</p>

    <p>"Mm, and then?"</p>

    <p>"That was it..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
