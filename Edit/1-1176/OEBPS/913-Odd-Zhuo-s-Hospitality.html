  <h1>Chapter 913 Zhuo Yi's Hospitality</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The two Immortal Palm Tree Sect disciples deeply regretted coming to this Internet cafe now. This was a rip-off! However, they couldn't not give Su Xing face; everyone knew that after the sect celebration last time, Su Xing and Lord Diulei had become very close.</p>

    <p>Who was Lord Diulei? On the day the Office of Strategic Deception opened for business, even the Ten Founding Generals gave him face!</p>

    <p>Furthermore, the Office of Strategic Deception was currently the only sect among all the light forces that worked in direct cooperation with Huaxiu Alliance! Thus, it was very important to build a good relationship with the sect!</p>

    <p>Immortal Palm Tree Sect hadn't sent any representatives to the sect celebration, and the sect head of Immortal Palm Tree Sect regretted it so much that the day the Heavenly Dao broccoli went on sale, he signed a massive order with the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>It was his way of apologizing. On top of that, it demonstrated his sincerity for future collaborations.</p>

    <p>It wasn't just these Immortal Palm Tree Sect disciples; there was now an explicit rule in Immortal Palm Tree Sect that all their disciples had to vigorously support all of the Office of Strategic Deception's businesses!</p>

    <p>In fact, it was because of this rule that the two disciples could no longer refuse, and they couldn't let anyone else hold this over their heads!</p>

    <p>"I'll get a gold member's card..." After making up his mind, the senior brother grit his teeth and took out several golden bills from his wallet.</p>

    <p>Su Xing looked at the little junior brother next to this senior brother, and noticed that he was laughing secretly with the face of one rejoicing in someone else's misfortune. Su Xing quickly said, "Since you've decided to get a gold membership, how about topping up another five hundred to reach 1500 and upgrade to a combined package? One card can be used by two people. You should look after your little junior brother. However, this extra five hundred immortal gold has to be paid by your junior brother."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>The little junior brother's face instantly turned gray.</p>

    <p>He couldn't refuse, and could only take out a golden bill worth five hundred immortal gold and get a combo card with his senior brother.</p>

    <p>Su Xing happily took the money, and while he was keying in the customer information, he suddenly thought of something, and looked at the two people. "Ah, that's right! Do you want to top up another five hundred immortal gold? Our Internet cafe just opened and has an exchange offer. An extra five hundred immortal gold can be exchanged for a crispy noodle snack packet!"</p>

    <p>"No... no need, we don't have any more money!" The two Immortal Palm Tree sect brothers were about to cry.</p>

    <p>Su Xing smiled. "Don't regret it!"</p>

    <p>Actually, it wasn't that they didn't have the money, but that they didn't think it was worth it.</p>

    <p>Five hundred immortal gold for a snack packet...</p>

    <p>Only a fool would do that!</p>

    <p>Ten minutes later, the two Immortal Palm Tree Sect disciples left with the gold member's card for the Office of Strategic Deception's Internet cafe and looks of despair on their faces... His elbow half-propped on the doorframe, Su Xing watched these two suckers leave.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was still Wednesday August 30th.</p>

    <p>Shortly after the two Immortal Palm Tree Sect disciples left, a van bearing the logo of the General Administration of 100 Schools drove directly through the gate of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>A group of people got out of the van: Wang Ling, Chen Chao, Guo Hao and Su Xiao... Number 60 High School's Grade One, Class Three squad had gathered.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao had already been chattering on for a while during the car ride; he couldn't believe that he had actually received an invitation from the Office of Strategic Deception... He had clearly still been complaining last night about not getting a beta account for Cultivation Emulator. In the end, he had received an invitation letter the next day!</p>

    <p>The invitation was signed with Lord Diulei's name and even bore a golden seal.</p>

    <p>They had been invited to tour the newly-built Internet cafe. At the same time, each of them received visitor's passes to all the halls, in addition to a gift pack of the beta version of the game!</p>

    <p>Fang Xing got out from the front passenger seat and smiled. "Don't get too excited. We're only allowed to take a look around today. We're all minors, yet Senior Zhuo Yi was able to commission Lord Diulei to send us invitations, so you should be happy with that."</p>

    <p>"Are we really only allowed to look around?" Guo Hao and Chen Chao were both a little disappointed.</p>

    <p>"At any rate, you have the beta version gift pack; you can take that home to play." Su Xiao chuckled.</p>

    <p>As the commissary in charge of studies, Su Xiao had already been completely led by Guo Hao and Chen Chao down a road of no return...</p>

    <p>"Didn't I say Wang Ling was a good luck charm?!" Chen Chao touched his head. Even now he still felt amazed. "But why did Senior Zhuo Yi suddenly invite us over?"</p>

    <p>"Did you forget that Wang Ling lent his spirit sword to Senior Zhuo Yi at the spirit sword exchange meet? This is Senior Zhuo Yi's way of saying thanks," Fang Xing replied.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing and Zhuo Yi had already agreed on this cover story last night!</p>

    <p>"I told you! Wang Ling's a good luck charm!"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Chen Chao didn't suspect anything and straightaway laughed heartily. "I almost believed that it was Classmate Wang Ling who's running the Office of Strategic Deception!"</p>

    <p>Fang Xing: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Just like Fang Xing said, they could only tour the Office of Strategic Deception's Internet cafe this time. It was a legitimate Internet cafe, so naturally it looked like one - trying to enter through a back door wouldn't work.</p>

    <p>"Damn!" As soon as he entered, Chen Chao was promptly stunned by what he saw.</p>

    <p>He didn't think this could be called an Internet cafe at all. It was built like a palace hall, and the machines were all virtual pods! When you lay down inside and put on a helmet, you would be directly connected to the Internet! You could do whatever you wanted! Even if you played for a long time, you wouldn't feel tired! Once you were inside the virtual pod, it was almost like you were dreaming, and your body would completely relax.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, these virtual game pods which Lord Diulei had bought were all very advanced, with a massage function.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing had already informed Su Xing beforehand about their arrival. Su Xing showed them around and introduced various features of the Internet cafe to them.</p>

    <p>"These virtual pods are also the latest version and are fitted with a waste excretion unit underneath. If you want to use the toilet halfway, you can also directly switch to toilet mode, and the virtual pods will then turn into enclosed toilets." Su Xing pointed something out. "Do you see that? The button with an image of poop on it is the button for toilet mode."</p>

    <p>"What's this?" At that moment, Guo Hao pointed to a button underneath the button for toilet mode which looked like two fish balls strung together.</p>

    <p>"That's vibrator mode."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Taking into consideration the fact that some customers might overindulge in our virtual pods, we added this mode, which is primarily used like a laxative. We all know that lying or sitting down for too long can easily cause constipation."</p>

    <p>"Your services truly consider everything..." Guo Hao marveled.</p>

    <p>"All the excrement will end up in the waste water reservoir, after which it is specially treated and turned into fertilizer to water the Heavenly Dao broccoli in the cultivation shed."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"The Internet cafe just opened today, but we already have a lot of Nascent Soul and Soul Formation customers; their excrement is actually quite hard to come by."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>During his presentation, Su Xing would steal glances at Wang Ling from time to time.</p>

    <p>With the exception of Chen Chao, Guo Hao and Su Xiao, everyone here was well aware of Wang Ling's identity.</p>
