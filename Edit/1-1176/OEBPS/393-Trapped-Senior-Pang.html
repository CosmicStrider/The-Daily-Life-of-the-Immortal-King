  <h1>Chapter 393 Trapped Senior Pang </h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Is this really okay? It won't suffocate?" Xiao Yin looked suspiciously at the wooden bucket.</p>

    <p>"It's fine." Pen shook his head and said, "Before my Lord dumped it into the bucket, he sealed all its acupuncture points and cleared its meridians so that spirit energy can circulate through its body smoothly."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin nodded his head. "I see."</p>

    <p>He had only seen Wang Ling dump Er Ha into the wooden bucket, and didn't know what else he had done. Spirit energy itself carried oxygen, and this "spirit energy internal circulation" method was actually quite common for connecting meridians together; it was an advanced version of the turtle-breathing skill, but could last for longer.</p>

    <p>When the "spirit energy internal circulation" technique was in effect, a cultivator could go without breathing for seven to ten days; the higher the cultivator's realm, the longer they could maintain this situation.</p>

    <p>"Is this really useful..." Xiao Yin rubbed his head; he was really very curious about how effective it really was.</p>

    <p>After all, nowadays there was an abundance of hereditary folk remedies for curing psoriasis... who knew what was real and what was fake.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin raised his eyebrows. "How long does it have to soak for?"</p>

    <p>Pen: "Heat up and simmer for eight hours."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin still felt this wasn't right somehow!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling had dumped Er Ha into the wooden bucket, its acupuncture points had been sealed and the "spirit energy internal circulation" had been activated.</p>

    <p>It was quite a strange feeling for Er Ha to be immersed in warm holy beast blood.</p>

    <p>It felt a little like sleep paralysis, which was when you were asleep but your consciousness was clearly awake; your body was still in a state of deep sleep, so you couldn't even open your eyes.</p>

    <p>This was a typical symptom of narcolepsy.</p>

    <p>However, it didn't take long for Er Ha to notice that something was wrong; it abruptly realized that the scene in its mind had changed.</p>

    <p>Then, it fell onto an island...</p>

    <p>The cool sea breeze ruffled its green fur. Er Ha lifted one paw and touched the sand on the beach - it was real!</p>

    <p>What was going on?</p>

    <p>Wasn't it currently being treated?</p>

    <p>Er Ha collected its thoughts and pondered for a bit.</p>

    <p>It could only come up with one explanation for this situation: its soul had been brought to this space by some mysterious force!</p>

    <p>But who on earth had done it?</p>

    <p>While it was thinking about this, Er Ha saw an old man in white appear in the middle of a grove of coconut trees up ahead.</p>

    <p>Er Ha was instantly on guard.</p>

    <p>This wasn't any ordinary old man; his aura ran deep, and his clothes fluttered despite there being no wind. Spirit potential rolled and formed an incorporeal shield with a radius of five feet around him.</p>

    <p>Looking at this imposing manner, this old man was at the very least a True Immortal.</p>

    <p>Er Ha watched him approach slowly step by step. The old man was trying his best to suppress his aura, as if he was afraid of scaring Er Ha off.</p>

    <p>"Brother Dog, don't be frightened... This old man won't hurt you..." the coconut old man said.</p>

    <p>Er Ha fixed its eyes on the old man in front of it and made sure to maintain its distance. "Senior, who are you?"</p>

    <p>"My surname is Pang and my given name is Guang. You can also call me by my Taoist name, Taoist Guang." This coconut old man placed his hand next to his mouth and answered so gently that his voice almost blended with the sea breeze.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Senior, can you act a little more normally..."</p>

    <p>In the end, this Senior Pang dropped to his knees on the ground and sighed deeply. "This is because your master is too powerful..."</p>

    <p>"..." Realization suddenly dawned on Er Ha.</p>

    <p>It turned out that this guy had been intimidated by Little Master Ling before!</p>

    <p>It had left a shadow on his heart!</p>

    <p>No wonder!</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "You've seen my master before?"</p>

    <p>"Yes... twice..."</p>

    <p>Upon saying this, Taoist Guang, Pang Guang, already looked close to tears. "This is a space I personally set up - in the end, your master just came and went as he pleased like it was nothing... He really didn't give me any face!"</p>

    <p>Lying down with his butt up in the air and beating the ground with his fists as he complained tearfully, he didn't have the manner of a True Immortal in the slightest...</p>

    <p>Er Ha was silent at this scene.</p>

    <p>It appeared that it had been quite a heavy blow to him... <em>You have to calm down! Senior! Ants have been in a footrace for ten years <sup>1</sup> </em><em>!</em></p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is a homonym of the line "Mother has been gone for ten years," which actress Ouyang Nana said too quickly in a live skit ..)</dfn>

    <p>As Senior Pang sobbed, Er Ha more or less learned the whole story.</p>

    <p>Previously, Little Master Ling had helped Grandfather Wang bring his kitchen knife to Luo Chuang's store for maintenance, and had happened to see that Luo Chuang had a heavenly fissure stone. Thus, Little Master Ling had helped Luo Chuang to appraise it with his Heavenly Eye. The result was that he had been unexpectedly sucked into this hidden space inside the heavenly fissure stone, and had met this Taoist Guang, Pang Guang, who was now standing in front of Er Ha.</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang: "At the beginning, I wanted to take him in as my disciple and my believer so that he would help me set up nine thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one statues all over the world, as well as find ninety-nine thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one disciples... Only in this way can I successfully overcome the Samsara Spirit Tribulation and pass beyond True Immortal and advance to Venerated Immortal. But who would have thought that your master would turn me down!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..." It would have been absurd if he had agreed!</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang heaved a sigh. "When I established this space, I set a rule that the first person to enter the space would automatically form a soul contract with me. After my first attempt ended in failure, I was going to draw on the power of the contract to invade your master's dreamscape to look for him..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "And then?"</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang: "Then... I was blocked..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha wasn't sure how anyone else would have dealt with this situation, but listening to this Senior Guang say this, this indeed felt like something that Little Master Ling would do!</p>

    <p>Blocking the contract to stop it from generating power might be very difficult for anyone else, but for Ling Zhenren, it was a piece of cake!</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang felt like crying at this point. "If I hadn't formed a contract with your master back then, I'm afraid I'd be trapped in this space for the rest of this life."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang drew in a deep breath, then said, "This time, I came looking for Brother Dog to ask if you would be able to help me pass on a message to the senior outside..."</p>

    <p>So he had been waiting for Er Ha here?</p>

    <p>It couldn't help laughing inwardly when it heard this.</p>

    <p>It smelled... a business opportunity...</p>

    <p>"What's in it for me?" Er Ha stared at the old man.</p>

    <p>"A blueprint of something that absolutely no one can resist... even I feel that trading this blueprint in exchange for the slightest chance to win my freedom is a bit of a loss for me," said Taoist Guang.</p>

    <p>"What's the blueprint of?" Er Ha's interest was aroused.</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang couldn't help laughing. "Before that, I want to ask Brother Dog a simple question..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "???"</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang: "Do you know what your master's true strength is?"</p>

    <p>"You want to scout out my master's realm?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha looked up at him. "It's still better for Senior Pang to judge it for yourself, but I can tell you how my master cultivates."</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang: "Oh? Tell me!"</p>

    <p>"He keeps up with radio gymnastics and eye exercises everyday, in addition to doing exercises in <em>On Talismans </em>and <em>Five Three. </em>"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"What is <em>FIve Three </em>?"</p>

    <p>" <em>Five Years of College Exams and Three Years of Simulations </em>."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
