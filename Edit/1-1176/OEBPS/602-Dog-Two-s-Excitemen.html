  <h1>Chapter 602 Er Ha's Excitemen</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The Holy Pillar was in the center of the four territories. The demon gods of the four territories were startled when Er Ha specifically asked Elder Wen to lead the way. Actually, they had the vague sense that this Senior Dog and Elder Wen didn't have an ordinary connection; it was just that no one dared bring it up.</p>

    <p>"Why do I feel that all of you are unwilling?" Arms folded, Zhenyuan gazed at them.</p>

    <p>"No... it's just that..."</p>

    <p>The instant that gaze rested on them, the four demon gods felt chills run down their spines; this was a human cultivator that could go toe to toe with Demon Saint, who could deliberately wipe them out without any effort at all. Moreover, Demon Saint had magnanimously invited them to the Holy Palace at the top of the Holy Pillar; this wasn't treatment just any human cultivator could enjoy.</p>

    <p>It should be known that even they had never been to the Holy Palace at the top of the Holy Pillar. Back when Second Generation Demon Saint had been appointed a demon god, it had happened at the foot of the Holy Pillar and no one had gone up. In past generations of demon gods, only the first generation leader of the Tuntian Ha clan, Clan Leader Jiang, had ever climbed to the top of the Holy Pillar and seen the Holy Palace with his own eyes.</p>

    <p>So when Er Ha personally picked Elder Wen to show the way, the demon gods of the four territories pondered whether this had something to do Elder Wen's Tuntian Ha clan.</p>

    <p>After all, compared with Immortal Zhenyuan's strength, this Senior Dog's strength was even more unfathomable. Given how mysterious it was, every move it made and every word it said probably had its own meaning.</p>

    <p>For these four demon gods who had been constantly trying to figure out Demon Saint's will over the years, it could be said that they were especially sensitive to every decision and every word from this type of "Great Senior."</p>

    <p>Ghost Emperor of the South smiled. "It's like this, Senior Dog, Senior Zhenyuan. Usually, only the demon gods of the four territories are qualified to approach the bottom of the Holy Pillar. Anyone under the level of a demon god, whether a territory envoy or a demon king, won't be able to draw near, unless it's a joint envoy for the four territories."</p>

    <p>"Then the four of you just need to appoint one, right?"</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan: "Also, can you not smile when you speak - when you smile with that devil face of yours, it looks like you're crying."</p>

    <p>Ghost Emperor: "..."</p>

    <p>Elder Wen looked overwhelmed when he heard Immortal Zhenyuan's words. "This... the joint envoy for the four territories can only be elected by the demon citizens of the four territories through an online public vote; they've never been appointed by the demon gods before."</p>

    <p>The demon gods of the four territories nodded their heads like chicken pecking at rice.</p>

    <p>"It is when I say it is."</p>

    <p>At that moment, Er Ha spoke up. "If anyone has any complaints, come out and fight me!"</p>

    <p>All the demons took an involuntary step back.</p>

    <p>The four demon gods said in unison, "Henceforth, we officially declare that Elder Wen of the Tuntian Ha clan will serve as the Secretary-General of the peace consulate of the four territories."</p>

    <p>Elder Wen: "..."</p>

    <p>All the demons: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>As they watched Elder Wen lead "Senior Dog" and Immortal Zhenyuan in the direction of the Holy Pillar, the demon gods of the four territories felt like breathing sighs of relief.</p>

    <p>They had more or less been contemptuous of human cultivators before, but Zhenyuan had taught them a lesson this time; when a genuine and supremely powerful human cultivator stood in front of them, it felt like they had to even consider every breath they took.</p>

    <p>The most critical point was that this was the demon world — in a situation where there wasn't any spirit qi around at all, he was still so powerful.</p>

    <p>If they had been in an environment more suited for showcasing his prowess, it would definitely be even more terrifying!</p>

    <p>The four demon gods spoke to each other telepathically.</p>

    <p>"Don't know why Demon Saint extended an invitation to this Senior Dog and Immortal Zhenyuan..."</p>

    <p>"Demon Saint actually prepared a feast. It probably isn't a simple reason. But it would be for the best if such a strong human cultivator and this mysterious Senior Dog were to become friends with the demon world! It would be too scary if they become our enemies!" said Ghost Emperor.</p>

    <p>"By the way, was it really alright for us to directly give Elder Wen this appointment..." asked Turtle Devil.</p>

    <p>"Your objections are useless. This might have never happened before, but that doesn't mean that it can't happen. Also, Elder Wen is worthy of this honor." At this time, Scorpion King spoke slowly through telepathy. "If Elder Wen hadn't persuaded me this time, I wouldn't have come at all. Actually, I suspect that before Elder Wen and I arrived, this Senior Dog had been intentionally stalling for time."</p>

    <p>"Is Scorpion King saying that this Senior Dog already planned everything earlier on in order to renew the friendship between the four territories?"</p>

    <p>"It's possible..."</p>

    <p>They recalled what had happened earlier with slivers of fears.</p>

    <p>This was an expert's way of doing things — to control everything in the palm of the hand.</p>

    <p>As expected of Senior Dog!</p>

    <p>Previously, the four demon gods had actually wondered whether "Senior Dog" really was that amazing; it now appeared that they had no right to doubt it.</p>

    <p>"Erm, Lord Demon Gods, may I interrupt a little..." At that moment, Ghost Emperor's territory envoy Daoist Witch Demon suddenly spoke.</p>

    <p>Ghost Emperor: "What is it?"</p>

    <p>"Based on the information from the other envoys that we've compiled, the official mailboxes for the four territories have just received a lot of letters of complaints from various territory Flower clans and Tree clans; currently there are already a hundred thousand of them."</p>

    <p>"Letters of complaint?"</p>

    <p>"Yes." Daoist Witch Demon nodded his head. "When Lord Demon Saint and Immortal Zhenyuan were arm wrestling just now, there was a lot of back and forth between the power to drain things and the power to revive them, and the plant-type demon clans suffered unduly for it."</p>

    <p>The four demon gods: "..."</p>

    <p>"Clan Leader Lu Chi of the Forest Fairies said that when he had felt himself wither, he thought that his end was near, and he had lain down inside the coffin which he had prepared beforehand. In the end, who knew that the power to revive would fall and engage in a tug-of-war with the power to drain things..."</p>

    <p>"And then...?"</p>

    <p>"Then the whole clan watched Clan Leader Lu Chi do sit-ups in his coffin."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"In addition to this, Lord Venerated Ox needs to handle the matter of Fellow Horse Face. He broke the rule of the peace consulate and was turned into demon sand by Demon Saint's restriction punishment."</p>

    <p>"Horse Face's death was too wretched..."</p>

    <p>Venerated Ox felt a sting in his nose. "Where is his demon sand?"</p>

    <p>"It's still in the peace consulate, but I've already sent a little ghost over to take a look."</p>

    <p>Daoist Witch Demon said, "There's a possibility that Fellow Horse Face's ashes might have scattered due to how fierce the clash was between Lord Demon Saint's and Immortal Zhenyuan's auras..."</p>

    <p>Venerated Ox's expression was extremely pained. "My <em>mazi <sup>1</sup> </em>! Actually gone, just like that..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Means 'horse' but is also slang for 'girl..')</dfn>

    <p>The other demon gods: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, with Elder Wen leading the way, two men and a dog turned into three streams of light which swiftly approached the Holy Pillar.</p>

    <p>From a long distance away, Er Ha saw a towering ancient bronze pillar, which resembled the Sea-Stabilizing Needle, appear on the horizon.</p>

    <p>"So this is the Holy Pillar?"</p>

    <p>For some reason, Er Ha suddenly felt excited at the sight of this pillar.</p>

    <p>Ah!</p>

    <p>It really wanted to...</p>

    <p>Piss on the Holy Pillar...</p>

    <p>Wait! Why had it thought such a strange thing?</p>
