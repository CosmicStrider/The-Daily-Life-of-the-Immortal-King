  <h1>Chapter 752 Mind Amplification Device</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The Ten Generals had come through that time and shared extremely deep bonds with each other, which had translated into the Huaxiu nation of today. If they weren't united, internal cracks would have already started to show a long time ago.</p>

    <p>Of course, from the moment this Night Chief affair started, the Ten Generals had guessed that there might be a mole at the management level... But this entailed a careful investigation. Since they didn't have any proof, the best would be if they could catch the mole and find evidence.</p>

    <p>The moment something happened to Wang Ming, General Yi and Marshal Jiang had already anticipated that Old Qi would stand up for him.</p>

    <p>Old Qi was known for protecting his disciple.</p>

    <p>Especially at the research institute, envious colleagues would always sneakily snitch on Wang Ming, but none of these reports were ever delivered to Huaxiu Alliance, as Old Qi would personally intercept and destroy them.</p>

    <p>As he always said: talent would always be the target of envy.</p>

    <p>Old Qi had experienced his own share of this sort of suffering when he was young.</p>

    <p>To protect and educate was one thing, but like called to like.</p>

    <p>While Wang Ming was sometimes haughty, he was absolutely respectful toward Old Qi.</p>

    <p>At work, they were teacher and disciple, and in life, they were like father and son. For Old Qi, Wang Ming was the only candidate capable of assuming the mantle of Wisdom Sage after Old Qi retired one day. Most people felt that Wang Ming was still lacking in many aspects and was still very young, but from the moment Old Qi had discovered Wang Ming, he had firmly believed that this person was the hope and future that he lived for.</p>

    <p>Old Qi didn't leave the Huaxiu Alliance building, but headed for his office.</p>

    <p>He was going to give those people from Night Chief a warning.</p>

    <p>But that didn't mean that he had to run off overseas.</p>

    <p>Old Qi understood that as one of the Ten Generals, if he ran off just like that, it wouldn't just be the head of state he would alarm, but the country's news media would also be shaken.</p>

    <p>Hence, President Qi had already decided on a more feasible option.</p>

    <p>"Is everything ready?"</p>

    <p>When Old Qi returned to his office, a young man was already waiting for him.</p>

    <p>This was Old Qi's office assistant, Qi Mengyu.</p>

    <p>Old Qi didn't have family, and Qi Mengyu was his adopted son and trusted aide whom Old Qi had had with him since young. Although he couldn't be considered a cultivation genius, he was still pretty good. He was quite a fair bit older than Wang Ming and the two of them were even closer than biological brothers.</p>

    <p>"Everything's set up. The equipment was already tested the other day, there are no problems," replied Qi Mengyu.</p>

    <p>When he had learned about what had happened to Wang Ming, he knew that Old Qi might do something, but he hadn't expected Old Qi to go this far for Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>The last time Old Qi had activated his equipment in his office was several hundred years ago when he went up against a demon god...</p>

    <p>This equipment set-up was called the Mind Amplification Device, and the way it worked was very simple: one only needed to sit on the sofa in the space capsule and put on a wireless helmet which would immediately amplify the mind.</p>

    <p>Given Old Qi's current mental strength, when he used a particular cultivation technique with the helmet on, he could easily speak to anyone in any corner of the earth and even launch a long-distance mental attack.</p>

    <p>This was now already version 8.0 of this amplification device, and it was Wang Ming who had completed the latest upgrade.</p>

    <p>"Mengyu, stand guard outside the door and don't let anyone in," President Qi said to Qi Mengyu.</p>

    <p>After that, President Qi turned a hidden knob in his office table, and the bookshelf behind him suddenly opened to both sides. Behind the bookshelf was a safe the size of a Rubik's cube. President Qi brought it up to his eye. It automatically opened, and with a ray of spirit light, he was directly sucked into the cube.</p>

    <p>The equipment set had been shrunk down in size and placed inside the safe using space extension technology.</p>

    <p>This safe had a built-in shrinking magic array, which was automatically activated through eye verification.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, Wang Ming was examining the tools on the bamboo raft.</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade had injected enough spirit energy for Wang Ling to use into the toolbox. By his calculations, he realized that there was even a surplus of spirit energy in the toolbox.</p>

    <p>Mm... when the time came, he could store this extra spirit energy in his ring.</p>

    <p>"This is the blueprint for the amplification device. In order to guarantee that it will break through the space wall, I've significantly increased the original parameters to ensure that it will work in one blast." Wang Ming spent ten minutes or so drawing the blueprint for the "Amplification Cannon" on the drawing board that had been inside the toolbox, and included the corresponding formulas under the parameters for each component.</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade didn't quite understand what he was looking at, but this drawing reassured him greatly.</p>

    <p>Looking at the blueprint, he suddenly asked, "I heard that you are Wisdom Sage's disciple?"</p>

    <p>"That's right." Wang Ming didn't deny it.</p>

    <p>Since the other party had asked, this proved that he had definitely investigated him, so there was no use in Wang Ming hiding the truth.</p>

    <p>"Our Old Qi also has an amplification cannon. I was the one who designed the blueprint for the latest version, so I'm very familiar with the parameters," Wang Ming said. "At the very beginning, the prototype was actually a mind amplification device. When Old Qi developed it back then, he gave it to a foreign mutant organization. A Professor X used this device to recruit all kinds of people and even opened a mutant school."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"But there were defects in the first design, and using this device easily caused hair loss, so it wasn't long before this Professor X turned bald."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"And this mutant school still exists! I visited the place when I went overseas with Old Qi before!"</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade was suddenly curious and tsked. "So are you a craftsman?"</p>

    <p>"No, I'm just an inventor," replied Wang Ming. "In a broad sense, a craftsman mainly forges and refines artifacts by melting the raw materials and then molding it into shape before finally pouring spirit energy into them. But for ordinary people with no spirit energy like us, we can also create magic treasures with modern technology if we're smart enough. But this type of magic treasure works off two energy sources. The standard magic treasures forged by craftsmen operate on spirit energy, while the scientific magic treasures which we create operate jointly on spirit energy and rechargeable spirit energy."</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade gave a "mm.""... What you say fits with what I know."</p>

    <p>Actually, he didn't know much about refining artifacts. If not for Wang Ming, Ghost Head Blade might never have known that there was this sort of difference in modern magic treasures.</p>

    <p>What Wang Ming had to do now was to fully gain Ghost Head Blade's trust.</p>

    <p>Because the amplification cannon wasn't the only magic treasure that he was going to design...</p>
