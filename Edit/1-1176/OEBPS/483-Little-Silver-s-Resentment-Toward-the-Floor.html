  <h1>Chapter 483 Xiao Yin's "Resentment" Toward the Floor </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Lord Diulei actually didn't think that what Xiao Yin had said was trustworthy since there were times when he would just simply say things. They would have to catch Er Ha in the act; society was now ruled by the law, and everything needed to be based on evidence. Analyzing this situation logically, as Ling Zhenren's "imperial" spirit beast, Brother Dog was in no way a simple green-furred dog!</p>

    <p>This was a dog that, under Ling Zhenren's good and virtuous influence, had developed upright three views and rid itself of vulgar tastes.</p>

    <p>Putting Xiao Yin's statement and Er Ha's illogical behavior together, it indeed looked very much like it had gone out looking for a dog girlfriend.</p>

    <p>But the problem was that it hadn't been a real dog before turning into one. Could it do as the Romans did so quickly? Lord Diulei felt that this was a huge point of doubt. Secondly, as Ling Zhenren's dog and also given the fact that it had cultivated to second class, it wasn't hard for it to suppress its baser instincts.</p>

    <p>But Xiao Yin had always been more pure to begin with and was still naive about human society; Lord Diulei didn't think he would lie. Instead, he thought it was most likely that Xiao Yin didn't completely understand the phrase "look for fun."</p>

    <p>After all, Huaxiu's culture... was so deep and profound.</p>

    <p>Words had completely different meanings in different contexts.</p>

    <p>Actually, a lot of things now had been distorted...</p>

    <p>Phrases like "an empty hole invites the wind <sup>1</sup> " and "Guan Zhong and Bao Shuya's friendship <sup>2</sup> " used to have different meanings; even "deep and profound" had been twisted to mean a "surge in vigor." Lord Diulei felt that if Cang Jie <sup>3</sup> saw these phrases now, he would be so infuriated he would raise his hands to unleash the Chibaku Tensei <sup>4</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Original meaning is 'unfounded' or 'baseles.')</dfn>
    
    <br/>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Referring to men and women's private parts respectively.)</dfn>
    
    <br/>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(The creator of Chinese characters.)</dfn>
    
    <br/>
    
    <dfn><sup>4</sup>(A technique in the series 'Naruto' which has been used to create large satellites of debris to drop on opponents..)</dfn>

    <p>"Brother Xiao, can you send me your chat history for a look?" For the sake of solving this case, Lord Diulei could only raise his head to look through the hole that Xiao Yin had poked open in the ceiling with his finger...</p>

    <p>Forget it - Lord Diulei thought this round hole had been pretty nicely made... it also just so happened that the light from the first floor fell on the table in the basement, so he didn't even need to turn on the light in the basement!</p>

    <p>But contrary to his expectations, Xiao Yin actually objected.</p>

    <p>"No way!" Xiao Yin's answer was very resolute.</p>

    <p>For one thing, this matter involved his privacy, and for another, he had his own considerations...</p>

    <p>He, a holy beast, had to lower himself to beg a second-class spirit beast for help, and even sent it red packets - how humiliating would it be if this got out!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei heaved a sigh and didn't say anything more; since this had to do with privacy, it wouldn't be nice to insist on it. In the end, his phone on the table vibrated with another message from Wang Ling. "Guyuan New District?"</p>

    <p>Due to the spirit beast contract, Wang Ling could determine the general area that Er Ha was in, but wasn't able to work out the specific location. Now that he had narrowed it down as much as possible, he could only ask Little Black to help with the rest and do a search within the area.</p>

    <p>Hadn't Guyuan New District just opened? Why would Brother Dog go there?</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei knew that a lot of the entertainment facilities there were still under construction. There weren't any large cultivation shopping malls like Yida nearby, or even any relaxation centers with baths and saunas.</p>

    <p>First of all, Lord Diulei had already thrown out the possibility of Er Ha going for a foot soak.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, if a dog that could talk and which had such distinctive fur were to run to a relaxation center for a foot soak, it would instantly make the news.</p>

    <p>Thinking this, Lord Diulei directly sent Wang Ling a voice message instead of typing: "Brother Ling, wait a minute. I'll contact Little Black right away and have him find the exact location."</p>

    <p>But before he could finish speaking, Xiao Yin immediately interrupted him. "Wait, Thunder! Don't send it to Master yet!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was so startled his finger almost slipped at Xiao Yin's yell, but in the end he scrolled up and deftly canceled the voice message. "What's going on, Brother Xiao?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin had clearly received some explosive news, and he was unable to contain himself!</p>

    <p>Then, Lord Diulei heard a loud "bang" above his head.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin had directly punched a hole in the floor and jumped down from it.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei looked up at the ceiling and sucked in a cold breath of air. "Brother Xiao... what did my family's floor do to you?"</p>

    <p>It was made of the best sapphire marble! Custom made by artisans! Lord Diulei wanted to cry but had no tears to shed as he looked at the big hole in the ceiling.</p>

    <p>"Thunder! Thunder! Look at this!" Xiao Yin dusted himself off and passed the phone directly to him. It was a screenshot of a live stream room.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei stared blankly at the screenshot. " <em>Ei </em>? Isn't this..." He almost said "Daoist Guang" these two words, but Xiao Yin didn't know of the latter's existence. For the time being, Lord Diulei and Wang Ling had decided to keep secret Daoist Guang's identity as the person who had divulged information on Evil Sword God and the Immortal's Treasure House.</p>

    <p>"Thunder, you should know this live streamer, he's very popular recently!" Xiao Yin said excitedly.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei gave an unperturbed nod. "Hm... I know him..." He already more than just knew him; they had already become brothers!</p>

    <p>"Look at this!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin pointed at something in the screenshot.</p>

    <p>It was a bullet message in the live stream room which read: <em>Immortal Two and his friend are on the way to the Internet bar and Lord Island is recruiting water friends from his fan group! Everyone get hyped! Lord Island will choose water friends randomly! This is a rare opportunity!</em></p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was startled by this bullet message.</p>

    <p>Immortal Two? Wasn't this Brother Dog's online ID?</p>

    <p>As soon as he opened the live stream room, he saw that Lord Island was already online and there was a special notice on the public screen: <em>This online water friend activity is exclusively sponsored by Xin Xing Internet Bar...</em></p>

    <p>Not only that, Daoist Guang had even directly posted the address of this Internet bar on the public screen, and it was right in Guyuan New District!</p>

    <p>Well...</p>

    <p>There was no need for Little Black to step up...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei could roughly guess the whole story, and he promptly took a screenshot of the live stream room before he sent it to the three-person chat group they had set up with Daoist Guang. "Daoist Guang, are you going to game online with Brother Ling's dog?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "???"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had been staring at the chat box the whole time, so he saw this message when it popped up.</p>

    <p>He saw the screenshot that Lord Diulei had sent. There was already a red box on it singling out Er Ha's online ID among the bullet messages.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's face couldn't help twitching: this thing had actually gone to an Internet bar to play games?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling suddenly thought...</p>

    <p>His dog really knew how to look for fun...</p>
