  <h1>Chapter 648 A Precious Gift at the First Meeting</h1>

  <div>

    <p>For Immortal Toya, this was a very worthwhile transaction.</p>

    <p>It was just a branch in Songhai city and at most still only cost as much as one of his pill furnaces. At worst, he just didn't have to buy a new model next month - who asked Ling Zhenren to be so fond of crispy noodle snacks! In any case, as long as Immortal Toya could save face in front of his two disciples, he felt that everything was negotiable.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Wang Ling didn't expect Immortal Toya to give him a branch store, and he felt a trace of excitement. After annual VIP cards, there was finally a new way of giving gifts... directly giving a store!</p>

    <p>Sure enough, alchemists all had deep pockets!</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya went upstairs, followed by Jin Shi and Yin Shi, who wore relaxed expressions. He had boasted earlier downstairs that he and Wang Ling were evenly matched, so these two weren't nervous, while Immortal Toya himself was a little embarrassed.</p>

    <p>When they reached Wang Ling's bedroom, Immortal Toya lifted his hands and pushed the two ahead of him. "This is Senior Ling. This is your first time meeting him, give your greetings first."</p>

    <p>"Greetings, Senior Ling!" Jin Shi and Yin Shi nodded and stood next to each other as they gave Wang Ling courteous bows.</p>

    <p>"Mm." Wang Ling nodded.</p>

    <p>Jin Shi and Yin Shi had been trained since young and so had very good manners; they wouldn't reveal whatever they were thinking on their faces. Besides, they had very clean hearts and didn't have any bad thoughts at all.</p>

    <p>For now, they were just very curious about the things around them. After all, their living situation in the future would certainly be different after leaving the relatively secluded environment on Chrysanthemum Island and officially coming to the city to study. Wang Ling could understand Immortal Toya bringing the two siblings with him beforehand so that they could adapt to the surroundings.</p>

    <p>And when Wang Ling opened his mouth to respond, even though it was just one word, Immortal Toya's heart burst with joy! Senior Ling personally opening his mouth to reply was such a rare occurrence! For Jin Shi and Yin Shi to actually receive a reply in their first meeting with Senior Ling... they were indeed his disciples, full of potential!</p>

    <p>"You two, wait for me at the door."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya smiled gently at Jin Shi and Yin Shi.</p>

    <p>"Yes, shifu." Jin Shi and Yin Shi exchanged looks, then very obediently stood on each side of the bedroom door.</p>

    <p>To tell the truth, these two kids were really charming.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling lifted an eyebrow and took out two packets of crispy noodle snacks from his drawer before directly going over to the door and giving them to the two siblings.</p>

    <p>He had specially enchanted these crispy noodle snacks!</p>

    <p>After Immortal Toya's special training, Jin Shi and Yin Shi's damaged spirit roots were finally restored, and to a remarkable degree. They reached the Foundation Establishment stage at just thirteen years old. However, the potential of their spirit roots had yet to fully develop; unlike the ones that Xiao Yin had, these two packets of crispy noodle snacks were more suitable for Jin Shi and Yin Shi, and would help them develop their potential.</p>

    <p>When Jin Shi and Yin Shi accepted the proffered crispy noodle snacks, they felt that there was quite a bit of strength in this "Senior Ling's" hands, and they had to tug several times before they could take the crispy noodle snacks.</p>

    <p>Jin Shi and Yin Shi: "Thank you, senior!"</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling gave them the snacks, Immortal Toya was directly stunned; his mouth opened wide and he wore the expression of one who had received an overwhelming favor. "How can Senior Ling give them such great gifts?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling waved his hand lightly. Fang Xing had sent him these crispy noodle snacks previously. Before he could finish them, there happened to be two packets left. These two kids had taken the trouble to come visit him, so he felt that there was no need for him to be so stingy. He wasn't stingy at all!</p>

    <p>It was just that when he had handed the crispy noodle snacks over, his hands had trembled a little...</p>

    <p>This was a normal reaction!</p>

    <p>This time, Immortal Toya had struck it big!</p>

    <p>On his end, bringing Jin Shi and Yin Shi to meet Senior Ling had indeed been the right decision!</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya's heart was deeply moved and he couldn't help stroking Jin Shi's and Yin Shi's heads with extreme excitement. "The two of you are really lucky! I'm so proud of you!"</p>

    <p>Jin Shi and Yin Shi cocked their heads; they completely couldn't understand why their shifu was so thrilled.</p>

    <p>It was just two snack packets...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Closing the door, Immortal Toya prepared to do a thorough physical examination of the girl in gray.</p>

    <p>"Ah, what a pretty girl..." Immortal Toya marveled a little the instant he saw her.</p>

    <p>To be honest, it was hard for him to believe that this girl had actually been rescued from an alien planet... and from a kun's stomach to boot.</p>

    <p>These extinct prehistoric vicious beasts had actually survived...</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya took a deep breath and then took out his top secret medicines.</p>

    <p>He had his own unique medical methods. Generally, when outsiders came to him to be examined, he would make sure that there was no one in the room before he did anything. But none of this mattered now in front of Wang Ling... Senior Ling's realm was so profound, why would he bother with Immortal Toya's petty secret arts?!</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin and Er Ha moved aside.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya had seen Er Ha and Xiao Yin before, and had also heard that they were now Senior Ling's contract beasts. However, today was Immortal Toya's first time seeing Xiao Yin's human form. To be honest... if he hadn't seen Xiao Yin's original form, he would really have thought that Xiao Yin was a girl.</p>

    <p>After calming his thoughts, Immortal Toya carefully picked up a reagent tube. He extracted a drop of liquid medicine and let it drop onto the girl's body.</p>

    <p>In the end, before the drop could fall, it was blocked in midair by the bright light of the gray Daoist robe on the girl.</p>

    <p>"These clothes aren't simple..." Immortal Toya tsked.</p>

    <p>This tube of liquid medicine was his specialized evaporative fluid. It was non-toxic and harmless, and completely safe. Applying this liquid medicine to a cultivator's body would draw the person's spiritual qi out and their condition could be analyzed based on changes in the qi's color.</p>

    <p>If the girl's lethargy was caused by poison, the color of the spiritual qi would turn a dark black or purple.</p>

    <p>In general, there were two most likely reasons for a cultivator to fall into a coma.</p>

    <p>The first was that the coma was caused by poison, and this kind of poison wasn't too life-threatening. As long as vital signs were kept stable, the person would continue sleeping in a vegetative state.</p>

    <p>The second was that it had occurred naturally, which would require Immortal Toya to bring her to the island for further tests.</p>

    <p>"Brother Xiao Yin, Brother Dog... Can one of you help me undo this girl's collar a little?" Immortal Toya asked.</p>

    <p>"We can't. Only Master can touch her clothes." Xiao Yin shook his head.</p>

    <p>Saying this, he tried stretching out one hand to touch the girl in gray; in the end, the gray garment released a fierce, bright light which formed a resistance that blocked Xiao Yin's hand - he couldn't get close at all.</p>

    <p>Er Ha was weaker than Xiao Yin to begin with, so it was also impossible for it to touch her.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed. This time, he really had to do it himself!</p>

    <p>Just as he was about to undo her collar, Mother Wang came in with several cups of broccoli juice. "Little To, have some juice! It's from the broccoli Little Lei sent over last night, it's very fresh!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Immortal Toya, Xiao Yin and Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Carrying the juice, Mother Wang gave everyone a slight smile, then took two steps back and closed the door.</p>
