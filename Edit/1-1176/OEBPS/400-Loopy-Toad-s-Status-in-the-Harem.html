  <h1>Chapter 400 Er Ha's Status in the Harem </h1>

  <div>

    <p>After conveying the message to Xiao Yin in the main group, Lord Diulei instantly opened a private chat window. His chat partner wasn't just anybody, but was Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei swiftly typed out a question. "Brother Ling, why do you know who these people are, and why are you so sure that the Demon Hunters Association are after Brother Xiao Yin?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was silent at this question, because he felt it was a little complicated. It had actually all started when Xiao Yin had sent blood over.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling had been about to soak Er Ha in the holy beast blood, he had suddenly discovered that someone had planted a soul marker on it. It was a very sophisticated trace method, and stronger than what Mo Immortal Castle had used to track Song Qingshu. The most impressive thing about it was how discreet it was; it couldn't be detected easily without careful inspection.</p>

    <p>Er Ha had always been at home before, and the only people who would have had the opportunity to put this type of marker on it was the gang from the Demon Hunters Association.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling guessed that it was Strong Zuo who had secretly planted this marker. However, Strong Zuo couldn't have created this kind of soul marker with his ability alone. Wang Ling thus speculated that there had to be an expert helping them out behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>Then, when Wang Ling had dumped Er Ha into the bucket, he had transferred the marker to Xiao Yin in passing...</p>

    <p>After understanding what had happened, Lord Diulei wiped at his sweat as he looked at the screen. "Brother Ling... Did you plan this from the beginning? But may I ask, why Xiao Yin?"</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling had considered this problem carefully.</p>

    <p>First of all, this lot running over for revenge were elders who would naturally be stronger than Strong Zuo that piece of trash. Secondly, Er Ha's narcolepsy hadn't been fully cured; it would be a serious problem if it collapsed in battle. And finally, the soul pet contract's remote assistance option also had a cooldown period.</p>

    <p>Thus, Wang Ling's answer was very simple: <em>What if Er Ha gets hurt?</em></p>

    <p>Sitting in front of the screen, Lord Diulei sunk into deep thought at this reply.</p>

    <p>Somehow, he smelled a whiff of indulgence...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei's heart suddenly ached a little for Xiao Yin.</p>

    <p>Come to think of it, he suddenly recalled that while Xiao Yin had accepted Wang Ling as his owner, it seemed that they hadn't formed a contract yet... Moreover, just by looking at Wang Ling's attitude toward this incident, it was already clear to see how much space Xiao Yin and Er Ha each took up in Wang Ling's heart.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei couldn't help but sigh - Xiao Yin had a long way to go before it could truly obtain a position in Brother Ling's harem.</p>

    <p>Wait a minute...</p>

    <p>Had he somehow been fed a mouthful of dog food <sup>1</sup> ?</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This means to be subjected to PDA..)</dfn>

    <p>Fucking dog food!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>This block was actually very close to both Fang Xing's and Lord Diulei's houses; it was just that Xiao Yin had never been to this road with the weird name before. If he hadn't received Lord Diulei's instructions, he really wouldn't have known what to do with the gang of people behind him.</p>

    <p>After receiving clear instructions, Xiao Yin was greatly relieved and he deliberately slowed down.</p>

    <p>There weren't many people following him, just two individuals.</p>

    <p>They followed Xiao Yin closely and finally arrived at a factory which was still under construction. It was supposed to be a modern food processing factory, but it had yet to be finished. Work had stopped for the night and all the workers had gone home, so no one was there. Furthermore, the construction site inside was very spacious.</p>

    <p>The two elders of the Demon Hunters Association who had been tailing Xiao Yin the whole time stopped in front of the iron gates to the construction site, which were shut, and saw the silver-haired young man jump inside.</p>

    <p>Most likely they had been discovered.</p>

    <p>"It stopped moving..." An old Taoist in a grey Chinese gown stood at the entrance. He held a compass in his hand which showed the location of the soul marker.</p>

    <p>After the silver-haired young man had leapt inside, the soul marker which had originally been moving on the compass had stopped, thus confirming that the young man had stopped moving.</p>

    <p>"This beast has guts; it actually dares to challenge us." The old Taoist snorted.</p>

    <p>"Senior brother, do you think we may have the wrong target?" the man next to him couldn't help asking; he had a tear-shaped birthmark on his face and looked somewhat feminine.</p>

    <p>In addition to secretly planting the soul marker before being arrested, Strong Zuo had in fact also delivered a hidden order; after decoding, it turned out to be a description of the enemy â€” in addition to a youngster, the main force was a green-furred dog of the akita breed.</p>

    <p>And based on the decoded hidden order, Strong Zuo explained that while the dog was estimated to be third class, it had a very strong owner behind it. It was precisely because this owner had mobilized the soul pet contract to boost the dog's strength that Strong Zuo's group had been completely defeated.</p>

    <p>But the problem was that the target they were now chasing wasn't a dog!</p>

    <p>As a junior brother, the feminine man strongly suspected that they were mistaken.</p>

    <p>However, the issue now was that the two brothers had different views as the old Taoist holding the compass refused to believe it.</p>

    <p>The old Taoist squinted and snorted. "The soul marker contains the president's power; you and I both have seen his strength for ourselves. There is absolutely no mistake; without a doubt, the young man inside is that dog!"</p>

    <p>"But senior brother... Even in human form, it's definitely first class. But Strong Zuo's hidden order shows that the dog is third class." The junior brother was in a daze. This whole situation felt unreliable; there were too many points of doubt!</p>

    <p>Besides, as a green-furred dog, even if it took human form, its hair should at the very least be green, right? Too many things didn't add up!</p>

    <p>"Senior Brother Canglan... do you think it's possible that someone has tampered with the soul marker?" this junior brother surmised.</p>

    <p>"Tampered with it?" The old Taoist couldn't help laughing. "Junior Brother Han ah, Junior Brother Han, you're still young and inexperienced."</p>

    <p>Junior Brother Han: "But..."</p>

    <p>"No 'buts.'" The old Taoist pinched his beard. "Once something has been engraved with a soul marker, it can only be washed off through soul purification. What's more, the president's skill at soul marking is superb, and he's very good at hiding the soul marker; forget tampering, it's hard to even detect it. Junior Brother Han, you say that someone has tampered with it, but how?"</p>

    <p>Junior Brother Han said in a very soft voice, "I'm guessing that someone may have transferred it..."</p>

    <p>When he said that, the old Taoist burst into laughter. "Junior brother, your imagination is too wild! On this earth, how can there be anyone capable of moving the soul marker? No such technique exists!"</p>

    <p>Junior Brother Han: "..."</p>

    <p>"Unless he is the reincarnation of the Immortal King!"</p>

    <p>The old Taoist waved his hand and laughed. "If there is such a person, I, Canglan, swear by my Taoist name that my whole family will die out in a matter of days!"</p>

    <p>Junior Brother Han: "But Senior Brother Canglan... aren't you an orphan?"</p>

    <p>The old Taoist: "We two brothers, you and I, have relied on each other for many years, making a living through hunting spirit beasts... I, this senior brother, have long regarded you as family!"</p>

    <p>Junior Brother Han: "..."</p>
