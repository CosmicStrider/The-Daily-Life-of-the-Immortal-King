  <h1>Chapter 1022 A Case Caused By Copying Homework (3)</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This time, over two thousand killers had come together for a large-scale operation, regardless of qualifications or age, and President Bai found this fishy. To be able to command and move two thousand killers, it had to be those two epic-level killers in the circle who were behind this...</p>

    <p>"Gorgeous Itinerant and Daoist Taotie..." President Bai immediately thought of these two fellow brothers.</p>

    <p>"Does father think these two are in charge of this operation? But the rumor is that they've already cut off ties with each other," Bai Youquan murmured to himself. After rebuilding their base in this underground tomb, they had been secretly recruiting people from all over the place. With the Night Chief subordinates who had escaped before and some hidden Dark Network peak experts acting as a foundation, they set up a brand new black shadow army.</p>

    <p>They also tried employing some killers, but none of those on the list of killers paid any attention to their invitation.</p>

    <p>This was ample proof that these killers already had backers, or at the very least, that there was someone directing all their movements behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>After the assassin organization Shadow Stream was wiped out, the party who could win over the hearts of the killers and unite all of them in a short period of time... President Bai and Bai Youquan couldn't think of anyone else except the two epic-level killers.</p>

    <p>They wanted to monitor the fluctuation of Shadow, but the secret of the fluctuation was by no means known only to their family.</p>

    <p>According to President Bai's investigation, while it seemed that Immortal She Pi had been executed back then, it might actually have been for the sake of hiding the secret of the "fluctuation of Shadow."</p>

    <p>Perhaps, every country's cultivation government was already monitoring this matter in secret.</p>

    <p>But how had this group of killers found out?</p>

    <p>President Bai felt a little restless. His task was to ensure that no one interfered with the fluctuation of Shadow before it reached its peak. President Bai thus couldn't help but be exceptionally wary of this large-scale, collective killer operation.</p>

    <p>"I might be worrying too much, but since His Excellency has permitted us to act, nothing can be allowed to go wrong."</p>

    <p>President Bai's fingers incessantly tapped the bench that he was sitting on. "Dispatch someone at once. Whatever they're doing, they can't be allowed to succeed."</p>

    <p>"Very well, father," Bai Youquan replied.</p>

    <p>A few minutes later...</p>

    <p>Inside the underground tomb, Bai Youquan came up with a new command plan for the black shadow army.</p>

    <p>Black shadows overlapped each other in front of him, surging with the auras of multiple experts.</p>

    <p>"This time, we have to stop the killers, but remember, this must be done undercover. Your identities must not be exposed. So, everyone has to take off the black shadow suit that signifies our organization. Change into something else to pass as killers yourself."</p>

    <p>"Should we act together?" someone asked.</p>

    <p>"No need."</p>

    <p>Bai Youquan shook his head and said thoughtfully, "We will send in the same number of people as the other side. Keep an eye on one person each! If they don't make a move, neither will we! We just need to curb their movements! During the operation, be careful not to injure our own accidentally!</p>

    <p>"Before the master plan is in place, everyone must please keep a low profile. If you run into a situation that you can't handle, you can report back to me."</p>

    <p>"Yes, Captain Bai!"</p>

    <p>Right after Bai Youquan was done speaking.</p>

    <p>The layers upon layers of shadows in front of him, which were as black as crows, scattered on the spot.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Everything happened so suddenly. The moment Wang Ling saw the back of Teacher Pan, his mind swiftly and automatically filled in the big picture. This was the legendary "Great Mind Fill Spell." He truly wasn't deliberately peeking into Teacher Pan's thoughts; he just wanted to know whether Teacher Pan's appearance was coincidental or calculated.</p>

    <p>From the conclusion of the Great Mind Fill Spell, it was clear that it was the latter.</p>

    <p>And it wasn't just Teacher Pan; Wang Ling's "Great Mind Fill Spell" had even picked up on the operation that Lao Gudong was directing.</p>

    <p>No wonder there were so many cultivators lurking nearby - Wang Ling had noticed them when he was walking down the street. They had hidden themselves completely in the dark street corners where the sun didn't shine.</p>

    <p>It was this occupational habit which left Wang Ling in no doubt of their identities. He hadn't known at first what these people had shown up here for, since they didn't have any killing intent.</p>

    <p>Given Wang Ling's abilities, he usually could immediately determine whether or not a killer harbored malicious intentions, no matter how well they could conceal their killing intent.</p>

    <p>Now that he had the whole picture, Wang Ling suddenly understood.</p>

    <p>It turned out that this group of killers... was here to freaking grab homework...</p>

    <p>Using his identity as an epic-level killer, Lao Gudong had teamed up with his junior brother Daoist Taotie to get two thousand killers to spread out in all directions in the twenty-two districts of Songhai city...</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, such a large-scale operation had been launched all for the sake of homework...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling took a deep breath. For the first time in his life, he felt a little suffocated...</p>

    <p>At that very moment, Teacher Pan was right up ahead. Sticking his hands in his pockets, Wang Ling lowered his head slightly.</p>

    <p>There were only a few individuals between him and Teacher Pan; if she turned around now, she would see him right away.</p>

    <p>Things had become a little troublesome after all...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's pace was unhurried and he didn't act rashly. The killers dispatched by Lao Gudong were lying in wait in the shadows nearby. With so many eyes on him, any suspicious move he made would expose him.</p>

    <p>As he passed a convenience store, Wang Ling turned and entered it.</p>

    <p>He planned to wait for Teacher Pan to walk away a little further before ducking into the coffee shop.</p>

    <p>Looking at the current situation, however, it didn't seem like Teacher Pan planned on leaving any time soon...</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling took a cap out of his pocket and put it on his head.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling actually didn't have this cap on hand to begin with - this was a magical ability called the "Great Creation Spell," which he could use to create whatever object he wanted out of spiritual energy. In theory, this spell could even create food, but the food would be tasteless.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Ling felt like he had turned into a spy.</p>

    <p>To make his behavior look more natural, he picked up an original flavor crispy noodle snack packet from the shelf, paid for it, then went over to sit down at the snack table inside the convenience store.</p>

    <p>But not long after he sat down, he suddenly heard Su Xiao's voice next to his ear. "Wang Ling?"</p>

    <p>Su Xiao wasn't tall to begin with, and a white cloth was wrapped around his head. He was wrapped up tightly like a mummy, and was wearing sunglasses. Wang Ling almost didn't recognize Su Xiao, if it hadn't been for his voice.</p>

    <p>"Ha ha ha, it looks like you didn't recognize me - that's a relief, then!" Su Xiao grinned.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..." This clearly looked even more suspicious!</p>

    <p>"I got here before you, but unfortunately, I didn't make it into the coffee shop."</p>

    <p>Su Xiao then pointed to the door, in Teacher Pan's direction. "I'm hiding from Old Pan, just like you."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
