  <h1>Chapter 753 A Strange Request</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In Night Chief's general HQ, Night Ghost Spirit Emperor looked like he was in a good mood.</p>

    <p>Although it hadn't been his original body that had directly confronted the head of state, he had at the very least been able to parry His Excellency's blow in Dark Fragrance's body, and furthermore hadn't been at a disadvantage at all.</p>

    <p>What did that mean?</p>

    <p>If this was later reported in the news by all the major media outlets, Night Chief's reputation would increase and they would be able to recruit new members to greatly boost their strength, thereby making up for the losses from this master plan in Huaxiu nation this time - only Night Ghost Spirit Emperor himself knew that whether or not the real remains had a level thirteen spell wasn't important.</p>

    <p>What was important was the momentum and impact which the clash this time, as well as future ones, carried.</p>

    <p>It was only in recent years since Night Chief was first established that they had become the target of various governments and military forces.</p>

    <p>But a nation had dared to move rashly against Night Chief.</p>

    <p>Why?</p>

    <p>Because unlike other dark forces, Night Chief's foundation was too solid.</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor had endured in secret for hundreds of years as he built up Night Chief's core members, and the organization had devoted itself to developments in science and technology. Night Chief now had the capability to produce magic crystals - more than that, the magic crystals they produced on average continued to surpass those produced by various nations in terms of quality, and Night Chief was already capable of mass producing them.</p>

    <p>This meant that those members with lower realms in Night Chief only needed one high-level magic crystal to become a threatening force.</p>

    <p>Thus, while Night Chief's plan to invade the remains this time seemed to have ended in failure...</p>

    <p>The truth was that what Night Ghost Spirit Emperor valued the most was the international impact it generated.</p>

    <p>As for President Dylan who would probably give his life for this master plan, and even Edmark who had died suddenly before the start of the plan, their sacrifices didn't hurt Night Ghost Spirit Emperor at all.</p>

    <p>Losing two generals in exchange for international influence...</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor felt that this was an extremely worthwhile exchange.</p>

    <p>He could recruit new members to replace those that were lost.</p>

    <p>But such influence was hard to gain.</p>

    <p>Of course, there was an unexpected element which worried Night Ghost Spirit Emperor, and that was the "mysterious expert" hidden in the ranks.</p>

    <p>Who on earth was this expert?</p>

    <p>This was a riddle.</p>

    <p>But Night Ghost Spirit Emperor had a vague answer for this person's identity.</p>

    <p>He was practically convinced that the mysterious expert who had taken action, and the youngster who had killed President Bai, were probably the same person.</p>

    <p>It was just that he didn't know what that young man looked like, and the only lead he had was that youngster's brother.</p>

    <p>Saying that, Night Ghost Spirit Emperor suddenly recalled Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>At the very beginning, Night Chief hadn't fully investigated Wang Ming's identity.</p>

    <p>But Night Ghost Spirit Emperor was certain that this person's identity wasn't simple - because the personal information on this ID card was too fake!</p>

    <p>The initial plan was for Ghost Head Blade to capture Wang Ming, but unfortunately, the two of them had fallen into a space rift together.</p>

    <p>If he wanted to find out that youngster's exact identity, this brother whom he had a close relationship with would have been the best shortcut.</p>

    <p>He touched the screen as he read the information on Wang Ming. There weren't any other photos of him, and the one that Night Ghost Spirit Emperor was looking at was that foolish-looking ID pic.</p>

    <p>"Continue tracking follow-up information on this person. If there's anything new, inform me at once," Night Ghost Spirit Emperor narrowed his eyes and instructed one of his subordinates.</p>

    <p>This was the third president under him: Long Ming. He was an insect specialist, dressed in a very thick protective suit with a protective mask on his face.</p>

    <p>But after Night Ghost Spirit Emperor gave the order, Long Ming uncharacteristically didn't respond.</p>

    <p>Something didn't seem right.</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor stood up as his eyes turned hard and he was instantly on guard.</p>

    <p>In the next moment, Long Ming actually attacked him directly as black poisonous bees poured out of small gaps in the protective suit.</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor knew that Long Ming was probably being controlled as the latter would never attack him directly no matter how much guts he had.</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor waved his hand to cast a level five ice spell. Icy mist surged forth from his palm and the bees were instantly frozen into ice cubes which fell to the ground like snowflakes and shattered.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Night Ghost Spirit Emperor rumbled, "Long Ming, wake up!"</p>

    <p>This booming call had a sound wave spell mixed into it which could purify the mind and free a person from mind control.</p>

    <p>However, the mind controlling Long Ming's mind was beyond Night Ghost Spirit Emperor's imagination.</p>

    <p>This level six sound wave spell "Sound of Revival" actually didn't have the slightest bit of effect on Long Ming!</p>

    <p>In this deadlock, Night Ghost Spirit Emperor saw out of the corner of his eye that except for him, all of Night Chief's command was actually under mind control!</p>

    <p>All of them were frozen in motion.</p>

    <p>This was the illusion that time had stopped, created by the brain when it was under mind control.</p>

    <p>It was very clear that this Almighty had used the strength of his mind to track down the location of Night Chief's headquarters to launch this surprise attack.</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor's heart was shaken.</p>

    <p>It seemed he would need to move headquarters once again.</p>

    <p>When he had been hit by the medicine ball previously, he had already relocated headquarters once; who would have thought another wave would be stirred up yet again.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he had already guessed the identity of this person. "I know who Your Excellency is."</p>

    <p>To possess this sort of unimaginably formidable mental strength, there could be no one else but that commander in Huaxiu nation, one of the prestigious Ten Generals of legend: Wisdom Sage.</p>

    <p>President Qi didn't say anything, but manipulated this insect specialist called Long Ming into launching an even fiercer attack!</p>

    <p>Tens of thousands of insects poured forth and actually created a disorienting formation around Night Ghost Spirit Emperor.</p>

    <p>"A petty trick." He sighed lightly, and with just a flick of his sleeve, these spirit insects were directly devoured by flame.</p>

    <p>In that moment when the spirit insects were wiped out, Long Ming unexpectedly charged forward to attack him.</p>

    <p>"Insect attacks are Long Ming's forte. If you're controlling his mind, you should use what he's good at. He's the worst at close-range combat!" Night Ghost Spirit Emperor sneered outright.</p>

    <p>The next moment, he saw Long Ming raise his arm and aim his palm directly at his face.</p>

    <p>"Usually when Long Ming hits me with a close-range technique, it's just a tickle."</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor smirked again very broadly and didn't raise any sort of defense at all, but half-turned his face himself. "Come, hit me!"</p>

    <p>Long Ming's body paused, and it was obvious that the person controlling his mind was startled by Night Ghost Spirit Emperor's move.</p>

    <p>In the next moment.</p>

    <p>"Pa"!</p>

    <p>When Long Ming slapped his face, Night Ghost Spirit Emperor's expression changed dramatically.</p>

    <p>Like a shell shot out of a cannon, he was sent flying out of the command post with a bang.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, in the military tent, Wang Ling withdrew his mental power.</p>

    <p>This was the first time someone had offered their face up for him to hit.</p>

    <p>He had never heard such a strange request before.</p>
