  <h1>Chapter 221 Dog God </h1>

  <div>

    <p>More than two hours had passed since the start of the survival contest, and nearly a thousand people had been eliminated.</p>

    <p>The final number above Pingding Mountain on top of the boundary support was also stuck at 9118.</p>

    <p>The number hadn't changed in quite a while.</p>

    <p>The competition's duration was very long, so no one wanted to send themselves off so soon after it had just begun. After the initial pillaging of resources when they had first landed, the students from the six schools had found favorable territory to occupy, and then all of them had similarly adopted the "ten thousand-year-old lurker" maneuver.</p>

    <p>Squatting in favorable terrain and waiting for an outsider to attack first before they counterattacked — this was the same idea which almost all of the students from the six schools had had at this early stage of the survival contest.</p>

    <p>Electronic illustrated handbooks were scattered everywhere on the map and weren't difficult to find. However, because of the six headmasters' decision, each of the students in Number 59 High School and Number 60 High School already had a handbook, which was a huge advantage in enabling them to check their location on the map and to acquire information on magic treasures.</p>

    <p>The doors of a large supermarket were all tightly sealed.</p>

    <p>A crowd of students from Number 59 High School and Number 60 High School, led by Senior He Bufeng, the delinquent repeater of Number 59 High School, were gathered here.</p>

    <p>Su Xiao and Guo Hao were in this group.</p>

    <p>Everyone received Immortal Toya's message on their electronic illustrated handbooks at the same time: the toxic smoke on the horizon was finally starting to draw in.</p>

    <p>Su Xiao carefully compared position coordinates on the map, then said quietly, "The first layer of the toxic fog won't come in too far. We're close to the center of the circle, so we're actually still very safe."</p>

    <p>He Bufeng nodded, sweeping his gaze over the thirty to forty people around him, and said, "This position is very advantageous to us; there's a generous amount of map supplies in this supermarket. Even without the airdrops outside, each of us can pick up a spirit sword and even ample spirit talismans and all kinds of one-off functional magic treasures here."</p>

    <p>"This is simply a god-blessed circle!" someone said excitedly.</p>

    <p>In order for the map's simulation to appear authentic, even the items on the supermarket shelves were all real and consisted of supplementary consumer supplies such as all kinds of elixirs, food and water — occupying this large supermarket was a huge advantage.</p>

    <p>Currently, the only irregularity was Guo Hao.</p>

    <p>From being sent to the small world with bare buttocks to spiraling up to a height of five kilometers to finally falling down... Guo Hao felt like he was already near death.</p>

    <p>"Is Brother Guo's stomach a little better? What the hell did you eat?" He Bufeng frowned.</p>

    <p>Both He Bufeng and Tang Jingze had experienced Mother Juan's cooking for themselves. Although the names were very strange, honestly speaking, the taste was not bad! Furthermore, the food clearly contained the canteen lady's deep love for the kids.</p>

    <p>"No, you don't understand at all how terrifying Mother Juan's trial dishes are." At this point, Su Xiao couldn't help shuddering. "Last time, because of Mother Juan's trial cuisine, one of our teachers at the late Golden Core stage was laid up in hospital for twenty days after eating it and had had so much diarrhea that his golden core dried up."</p>

    <p>He Bufeng: "Is it that terrifying?!"</p>

    <p>Su Xiao: "Luckily Classmate Guo Hao only had a mouthful, otherwise he might not even be able to find his two balls."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Meanwhile.</p>

    <p>Two figures stood on top of a tall building in the center of the city in the small world.</p>

    <p>One was handsome, gray-haired Immortal Toya, who was dressed in traditional attire, while next to him stood an old man with a bent back. This was Li Su, who had been in the Seven Stars Cultivation Special Forces back then, and was now Old Li, the Chief School Guard at Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>Standing on top of the tall building, Immortal Toya looked at the city which had calmed down for the time being. "I never thought that we would meet again here."</p>

    <p>Hands behind his back, Old Li's eyes were serene. "It was thanks to Senior Toya that we seven old Stars could gather together this time. Due to a lapse back then, the seven of us were severely injured, and the headmistress had had to reorganize the Seven Stars. I've been a school guard all these years, but Headmistress Xingye has invited me a number of times to speak to that bunch of new Seven Stars juniors."</p>

    <p>"Xingye..."</p>

    <p>Saying this, Immortal Toya was suddenly silent for a bit. "Is she well?"</p>

    <p>Old Li narrowed his eyes and laughed slightly. "Senior Toya's cold refusal was a terrible blow to Headmistress Xingye. After that heartbreak, she has been immersed in work ever since, and for a long time now has stopped waiting for her destined person. With regard to this, I still think it would be better for you, Senior Toya, to personally send her your greetings."</p>

    <p>"Forget it, I don't have the courage." Immortal Toya smiled embarrassedly. "If I go... she'll definitely kill me."</p>

    <p>Old Li: "Senior Toya, you will have to make the decision yourself, but at the school's last annual meeting, I did hear Headmistress Xingye say that she would never give up..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya had a headache and rubbed his head. "..." He felt that the next thing he would need to do now was mass produce medicine for traumatic injuries.</p>

    <p>In fact, these were all words which Headmistress Xingye of Seven Stars Sect had recently ask Old Li to pass on. The gossip about Immortal Toya and Headmistress Xingye from back then was actually well-known in cultivation circles.</p>

    <p>After that spontaneous confession had been rejected, Headmistress Xingye of Seven Stars Sect had monopolized all the spectator seats in Huaxiu nation for three consecutive years during the Qixi Festival <sup>1</sup> , making every couple feel unspeakably bitter.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is based on the famous
Chinese tale of the cowherd
and the weaver girl, who were
separated despite their love.
The festival is the equivalent
of Valentine's Day for the
Chinese ..)</dfn>

    <p>With that matter covered, Old Li decided to get down to business.</p>

    <p>He looked in the direction of the small world's desert. "Senior Toya should have also felt it, right? I felt the aura of the godly punishment earlier, but there weren't any plans to activate it at this time, so it's a little strange."</p>

    <p>The gray-haired young man hummed in agreement as he nodded calmly. "I've already checked it out, Senior Ling is over there, so there's nothing strange about it."</p>

    <p>"Consultant Ling is there?" Old Li was startled. "But his signal doesn't seem to be on the radar!"</p>

    <p>"Senior Ling's aura is hidden very well. If he hadn't been exposed by the godly punishment earlier, I wouldn't have been able to pinpoint his position. As for the radar issue... I believe it's Senior Ling's elder brother who is probably blocking his signal. Whether it's us or the conference room outside, no one will be able to see him."</p>

    <p>"Senior Ling has an elder brother?" Old Li felt his three views toppling a little.</p>

    <p>The gray-haired young man smiled slightly. "Do you know the strongest brain in the Cultivation Academy of Science?"</p>

    <p>"!!!"</p>

    <p>Old Li felt his three views being overturned.</p>

    <p>"As expected, we can't comprehend Consultant Ling's strength and background."</p>

    <p>Old Li sighed. "Putting that aside, there are still a lot of people in the small world, and it's already been a long time since they made a move. At this rate, can the competition still proceed smoothly?"</p>

    <p>"At this time, the students have chosen to lay low, which General Yi had already expected; nobody wants to be eliminated so soon."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya answered, "Each time the toxic fog closes in, it will be in larger increments, which means that the space which the students can use will become smaller and smaller — that will be when the outcome will be decided. Oh, by the way, Li Su... I actually have a question."</p>

    <p>Old Li: "Senior Toya, please speak freely..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya looked at the street below him. "I wonder... what's the deal with that green-furred akita?"</p>

    <p>Old Li: "This is a dog which Consultant Ling's class is raising. Because the total number of Number 59 High School and Number 60 High School students in the contest is really too low, Consultant Ling's teacher-in-charge Teacher Pan applied to the higher-ups to allow this dog to participate. It's called Er Ha, and it's currently living with Consultant Ling."</p>

    <p>Living in Senior Ling's house?</p>

    <p>Living in that holy land?</p>

    <p>It was Immortal Toya's turn to be startled... so, this had to be a dog god, right?!</p>
