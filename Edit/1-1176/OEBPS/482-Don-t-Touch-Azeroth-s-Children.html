  <h1>Chapter 482 Don't Touch Azeroth's Children </h1>

  <div>

    <p>After this, Er Ha suddenly realized that there were quite a number of people around it who kept "demon beasts," like the members of the Demon Hunters Association whom it had run into at the assessment center. The leader had had a bone dragon with him. Er Ha had thought that it was a western spirit beast, and hadn't expected it to be called a completely different name in western countries.</p>

    <p>After Er Ha accepted Wei Zhi's gift, the two of them went out; Er Ha had already selected their destination. One dog and one person needed to decompress; for Er Ha, it was because it had been absorbing the Sword Dao in the inheritance talisman, and it needed to relax its mind as much as possible in order to be able to better absorb the contents of the talisman. For Wei Zhi, it was purely because he was short of money, which put him under immense pressure.</p>

    <p>In the driver's seat, Wei Zhi started his car. "Where are we going?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha sent the location to Wei Zhi. "An Internet bar, but it's a little far."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi was astonished. "You can play games?!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha spread its claws. "It's not hard to learn."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi sucked in a cold breath.</p>

    <p>But it didn't take him long to realize that this wasn't the main issue!</p>

    <p>Because it occurred to Wei Zhi that spirit beasts weren't allowed inside Internet bars!</p>

    <p>"Brother Dog, the problem is, how are you going to get in?" Wei Zhi asked.</p>

    <p>"It's an Internet bar willing to cooperate with Lord Island; he already let the boss of the bar know, and it'll be closed for us today."</p>

    <p>"Brother Dog knows Lord Island?" Wei Zhi's face was full of astonishment once again.</p>

    <p>Er Ha had a nonchalant expression; of course it knew Daoist Guang, though finding Daoist Guang's chat account had been a coincidence. After adding Lord Diulei and Little Master Ling as friends, the chat app had actually sent Daoist Guang's account as a "you may know" recommendation.</p>

    <p>"Just look at the fan list, I'm Immortal Two. Don't look down on Lord Island, he actually cherishes his fans!" Of course, Er Ha was just making all this up.</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang had helped Er Ha sort out the Internet bar last night. Given how big his live stream career was right now, there were actually a lot of Internet bar bosses who wanted to collaborate with him. Closing the bar for a day was a small thing for them; combined with the power of Daoist Guang's influence, if the name of such-and-such Internet bar was promoted during his live stream, it would definitely become popular.</p>

    <p>Er Ha took its phone out of its mouth. Checking its messages, it saw that Daoist Guang had already sent it a reply, and it told Wei Zhi, "Lord Island has already arranged it with his water friends and are waiting for the two of us. We'll be gaming as one team, and Lord Island and his number one fan will be another team."</p>

    <p>"Alright..."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi looked at the location Er Ha had sent him, and the corners of his lips couldn't help twitching as he stepped on the gas and drove the car slowly along the road in the direction of the Internet bar.</p>

    <p>While it was quite some distance away to their destination, Wei Zhi remembered from before that it was an upscale residential district, but the land around it hadn't been developed yet. He thus guessed that this Internet bar was definitely newly opened; the bar's name didn't even show up in Er Ha's GPS message. It was also only new Internet bars that would pursue a collaboration in order to become popular; established Internet bars already had their own regular customers, so it wouldn't be worthwhile for them.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, the name of an old bar would have already shown up on the GPS.</p>

    <p>"What's the name of this newly opened bar?" asked Wei Zhi.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Xin Xing <sup>1</sup> ."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The name in Chinese, 欣兴, is actually a reverse of 兴欣, which translates to Happy, and which is the name of the main eSports team in the online gaming novel "The King's Avatar.")</dfn>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Just as Er Ha and Wei Zhi hit the road, elsewhere, Lord Diulei received a message from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This weekend, this Great Death-Courting Senior was conducting research in his basement for his next death-courting operation.</p>

    <p>Recently, a person with the ID "Corris" had used an Internet forum to draw a ten-year-old girl into sexting with him. In the end, her parents found out. Later, this Corris posted his chat exchange with her parents online and urged the girl to leave home. What was worse, he used his influence with his fans to launch a verbal attack on the girl's parents and criticize them for being old and conservative.</p>

    <p>But this girl's parents weren't part of the ordinary generation. At the end of her patience with Corris, the girl's mother, an old <em>World of Warcraft </em>player, directly chose to thoroughly lay bare this matter on the gaming forum <sup>2</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is in fact based on an actual case that happened on popular video platform Bilibili.)</dfn>

    <p>In the end, Corris had never expected this incident to instantly become a hot public topic online; online users were now crowdfunding a bounty to launch a national manhunt for Corris.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei thought that this Corris was simply courting death.</p>

    <p>He actually dared to lay hands on Azeroth's children <sup>3</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(Azeroth is the name of the planet on which most of 'World of Warcraft' is set ..)</dfn>

    <p>Azeroth's children couldn't be touched, Azeroth's future generations even less so!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was always very proactive when it came to dealing with this type of scum of society, and he didn't even need a reward. He had just sent this "Corris" ID to Little Black for the latter to help him look for this person's address.</p>

    <p>Using just an online ID to investigate a person's identity was something that Little Black actually did a lot. There were times when Lord Diulei thought that it would be great if he could follow the network cable or WIFI back to where these scumbags were hiding and beat them up!</p>

    <p>Less than a few minutes after Lord Diulei had entrusted the task to Little Black, Wang Ling suddenly sent him a message.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei stared at it blankly because it said that Er Ha had disappeared.</p>

    <p>"When did this happen?" Lord Diulei immediately stopped what he was doing.</p>

    <p>But intuition told Lord Diulei that this Brother Dog wasn't the type to run away from home; it probably had had something to do or was out with friends.</p>

    <p>"Brother Xiao?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei raised his head and spoke telepathically to Xiao Yin, who was lying on his stomach on the sofa on the first floor with a broccoli pillow in his arms.</p>

    <p>Barefooted, Xiao Yin was kicking his legs back and forth as he read online about various special ways to cook crispy noodle snacks. While the most basic way to eat it was to sprinkle the seasoning inside the bag and then break up the crispy noodles, Xiao Yin felt that he should add a little bit of fun to his boring life.</p>

    <p>Hearing Lord Diulei call for him, Xiao Yin subconsciously raised his head from the sofa and looked at the floor. Then, he used a finger to directly poke a hole in the floor. Peering through it, he saw Lord Diulei...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "What do you want?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Brother Xiao... you can just talk to me, don't poke holes in my family's floor!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin's lips curled up. "Fine fine fine, I get it! Hurry up and tell me what you want, I'm busy!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Have you seen Brother Dog? Brother Ling said it's been out from morning until night in the last two days, and its movements seem very suspicious..."</p>

    <p>"Oh, you're talking about that dog!"</p>

    <p>Thinking for a bit, Xiao Yin answered, "I don't know where it is, but not long ago, it told me it was going to go out to look for fun!"</p>

    <p>The hell?! Look for fun...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was shocked.</p>

    <p>Was Brother Dog so liberal now?</p>
