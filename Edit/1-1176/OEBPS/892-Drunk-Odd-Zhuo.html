  <h1>Chapter 892 Drunk Zhuo Yi</h1>

  <div>

    <p>That day, Zhuo Yi asked for sick leave and didn't go to work.</p>

    <p>After that group of reporters left, he texted Zhong Lang. "Little Zhong, I'm not feeling well today. There's been a lot on our plate recently, I'm going to have to trouble you."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi had always been a polite person. Zhong Lang had only worked with him for a few short months, and as Zhuo Yi's reputation skyrocketed, the work of Songhai's General Administration of 100 Schools had also increased. However, Zhong Lang didn't feel the least bit tired. Zhuo Yi was his superior but also his fellow brother, and they actually had a good personal relationship.</p>

    <p>"Brother Zhuo, you can leave things to me if you're not feeling well. Take care of yourself; you have to work, plus vanquish evil and uphold Dao while you're at it - that's so exhausting." Zhong Lang was watching the morning news when he replied to Zhuo Yi's text.</p>

    <p>The female newsreader for the morning news was repeating the news on Devil Gut Fungus Lord, and now everyone knew that Zhuo Yi had run off overseas to catch someone...</p>

    <p>Returning to his apartment, Zhuo Yi put his briefcase down, took off his suit jacket and shirt, and took out several jars of "cheeky wine" from the fridge. This wasn't the beer which regular people drank, but actual "cheeky wine" with the slogan "be a little cheeky and be happy" <sup>1</sup> on it.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>("Cheeky" and "beer" are homonyms in Chinese, and the slogan is a riff on a song itle.)</dfn>

    <p>This cheeky wine was made from a fermented spirit herb, which could help one feel joy when they were vexed.</p>

    <p>But it was still wine, after all.</p>

    <p>It was unhealthy to drink too much.</p>

    <p>Usually, Zhuo Yi would have one jar after work to take off the edge, but now he took out everything he had in the fridge, as he was feeling particularly agitated today.</p>

    <p>For some reason, Zhuo Yi felt that he was increasingly becoming a different person.</p>

    <p>And he was very unhappy.</p>

    <p>As he drained jar after jar of wine, it did nothing to soften his gloom.</p>

    <p>Once the alcohol in his bloodstream reached saturation point, Zhuo Yi lay on the sofa and let out a long burp before he looked up and hissed, "Unbearable! Ma Fei!</p>

    <p>"Um... who's Ma Fei <sup>2</sup> ?</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(A random line from a Lol game live stream, spoken to live streamer Ma Feifei, which caught on as a catchphrase.)</dfn>

    <p>"Forget it... Who cares who he is...</p>

    <p>"Unbearable..."</p>

    <p>"So unbearable..."</p>

    <p>Lying on the sofa, Zhuo Yi lost more and more confidence. He had drained the jar dry of cheeky wine. Head aching slightly, he tossed the jar aside casually. The potent wine flooded his veins, sending him into a deep sleep.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi had yet to sober up at noon. At that moment, there was the sound of a doorknob turning in his staff apartment, and a plump man wearing dark clothes entered.</p>

    <p>"The infiltration is a success," the man in dark clothing said softly; his mask was a transmission magic treasure which allowed him to contact his team members outside.</p>

    <p>It wasn't easy to infiltrate a staff apartment, but as a well-known assassin of the Dark Network, Kong Ruye succeeded in his task. He seldom undertook infiltration work like this now, but he had been offered an irresistibly large sum by the big shot who had hired him.</p>

    <p>After completing this mission, he would retire.</p>

    <p>At the door, Kong Ruye gave a sigh.</p>

    <p>He took off the cloak on his shoulders and covered his entire body with it. After that, his figure and aura completely disappeared.</p>

    <p>In the living room, Zhuo Yi sprawled on the sofa, drooling a little.</p>

    <p>When Kong Ruye saw the jars of cheeky wine scattered on the coffee table, he tensed up.</p>

    <p>This person actually hadn't gone to work today?</p>

    <p>Would an expert who had just destroyed a villain in another country get drunk from a few jars of cheeky wine?</p>

    <p>He didn't believe it.</p>

    <p>His first reaction was that Zhuo Yi was probably faking it!</p>

    <p>Cold sweat trickled down his temples as he observed Zhuo Yi's movements from a distance, not daring to act recklessly.</p>

    <p>A real expert was conversely more difficult to deal with when drunk.</p>

    <p>Kong Ruye sweated buckets under the cloak; he was convinced that as long as he didn't move, he wouldn't be discovered. The cloak he was wearing was a world-defying magic artifact handed down from his ancestors. Although his realm wasn't high, this cloak had been his source of courage in all his years of extensive travel.</p>

    <p>But now, Kong Ruye had run into a difficult life problem as he wondered whether to act against Zhuo Yi or not.</p>

    <p>It would still be alright if this person really was drunk.</p>

    <p>But if he was faking it...</p>

    <p>Kong Ruye was afraid he would lose his small life.</p>

    <p>This mission...</p>

    <p>Was much tougher than he had imagined.</p>

    <p>He had been asked to collect a strand of Zhuo Yi's hair.</p>

    <p>Although he had no idea what the client wanted with Zhuo Yi's hair, it certainly hadn't sounded like a difficult mission.</p>

    <p>He just needed to sneak into Zhuo Yi's apartment when the latter was at work and find a strand of hair.</p>

    <p>But since he couldn't tell whether Zhuo Yi was faking his drunken state or not, he was feeling immense mental pressure.</p>

    <p>After taking deep breaths for dozens of seconds, Kong Ruye decided to steer clear of Zhuo Yi and avoid direct contact. Even if the apartment owner was at home, directly cutting the other party's hair would be putting his life at risk...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi looked like he had casual living habits, so it should be possible to find some traces of hair in the bathroom.</p>

    <p>But when Kong Ruye went to the bathroom, he was dumbfounded again.</p>

    <p>He never imagined that a man's bathroom could be so sparkling clean, without even a speck of dust to be found.</p>

    <p>Leaning over, he felt around the drain groove, only to find no hair in it. It looked like this Director Zhuo didn't shed hair when he showered. Or, he had a habit of cleaning them up.</p>

    <p>Why...</p>

    <p>Kong Ruye was a little wounded.</p>

    <p>Why was this man so powerful and yet had so much hair <sup>3</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(The joke is from "One Punch Man," where the protagonist gains insane strength at the cost of going bald.)</dfn>

    <p>Given how clean the bathroom was, it looked like there wouldn't be any hair in the bedroom either.</p>

    <p>The jars of cheeky wine scattered around outside was the result of Zhuo Yi's occasional bout of indulgence.</p>

    <p>To be on the safe side, Kong Ruye went to the bedroom, and after confirming that there wasn't any hair there, he finally switched targets to the drunk Zhuo Yi who was lying down in the living room.</p>

    <p>"So, I can only make a move myself?" Kong Ruye swallowed before he took out a pair of scissors and slowly approached the sofa.</p>

    <p>Just as he was about to act, Zhuo Yi suddenly roared, "Do you know?! Do you know... you should be fat... and I should be thin <sup>4</sup> ..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>4</sup>(Modified from a line in the "Song Poem," "The red should languish and the green should grow .. ")</dfn>

    <p>Damn!</p>

    <p>He had been noticed!</p>

    <p>Drenched in sweat, Kong Ruye withdrew the scissors. He was clearly covered by the cloak, but the other party had guessed he was a fatty!</p>

    <p>As expected, this guy had been pretending!</p>

    <p>Flustered, Kong Ruye was about to quickly flee the apartment, but Zhuo Yi actually flipped over at that moment and tripped him.</p>

    <p><em>Aiya!</em></p>

    <p>Kong Ruye, who was going to run, gave a wretched cry and suddenly fell, his forehead hitting the coffee table in front of Zhuo Yi with a loud thump.</p>

    <p>It was Lord Diulei who had gifted Zhuo Yi with this coffee table on the day of the founding of the Office of Strategic Deception. It was made from a special material and was extremely durable - a Soul Formation cultivator wouldn't be able to break it easily.</p>

    <p>And so, Kong Ruye passed out, his head covered in blood...</p>
