  <h1>Chapter 181 Bandit Evil, Cold Wind and Teacher Killer </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It had already been three days since the destruction of Shadow Stream's headquarters, and it had taken that long for Jiang Liuyue to adjust in that secret underground room before her condition finally stabilized.</p>

    <p>This Master of Stream Shadow did some preliminary estimates; after this disaster, she had lost at least six hundred years' worth of cultivation.</p>

    <p>Even if her spirit clay clone had been completely destroyed, she could have still retained her realm as long as she could call her clone back. Unfortunately, that damn cat hadn't given her the slightest opportunity to do so, and had straightaway blasted it apart.</p>

    <p>Her headquarters was in ruins, her younger sister had been caught once again, and even her assistant Mo Li had been captured...</p>

    <p>The Shadow Stream that had been world-shakers in the murder industry in the past no longer existed; at that very moment, Jiang Liuyue felt a little downhearted.</p>

    <p>Now that Shadow Stream had declined, she was well aware that the killers on that ranking list would be doing what they could to track her down... whether it was One-Inch Gray ranked seventh, Steamed Bun Invader ranked eighth, Little Cold Hands ranked ninth, or Night Rain Kidney Menace ranked tenth, they all had the strength to kill her and replace her in the rankings as easily as turning their hands over.</p>

    <p>Next, what on earth should she do?</p>

    <p>Her eyes darkened suddenly.</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue had already prepared much earlier on for the worst, but she had never expected this day to come so quickly and abruptly. Nevertheless, though the situation was terrible, she had at least been able to protect her real body. In fact, if it hadn't been for her spirit clay clone, she would have already lost her final shot at turning the tables.</p>

    <p>She was the one who had personally sealed up that mask chest in the headquarters. She knew that the stone ghost mask was one of twin weapons. Thus, the moment she had taken out that stone ghost mask, she had sealed it away in a void of chaos and cut off the resonant link between the two masks, exposing her location as a result.</p>

    <p>She was well aware that she still had an opportunity to turn the tide.</p>

    <p>That stone ghost mask was her final hand.</p>

    <p>As long as she could stay alive...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, Lao Gudong was still going on with his theory of history class.</p>

    <p>He was almost done introducing the top ten killers on the international ranking list, with three individuals left to talk about.</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong rested both his arms on the lectern as he adopted the manner of a storyteller. "I've explained the killers ranked fourth to tenth on the ranking list. Next, I'll talk about the top three killers in the world."</p>

    <p>When he said this, he narrowed his eyes slightly and his expression was calm and composed.</p>

    <p>"To my knowledge, since the release of the list of the top one hundred killers in the world, the rankings have changed roughly three thousand and six hundred times. However, there are three positions that have always remained the same, and they belong to the top three killers on the list. Once, there had been no shortage of killers on the list who would challenge them publicly; back then, in just one year, these top three killers had received over three hundred challenges, but on one particular day, all of these would-be challengers were killed. Basically, every single person just went to their deaths."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>"Since then, in order to reduce the constant upheavals that were happening on the ranking list, the killers all signed a pact to agree that they could only challenge the person who was in the spot above them, and they were forbidden to skip ranks when issuing challenges. So for the time being, Elders Gold and Silver are the only people qualified to challenge the third killer."</p>

    <p>"Excuse me, teacher, have Elders Gold and Silver attempted to issue a challenge?" someone couldn't help raising his hand to ask after hearing this.</p>

    <p>"Of course they have." Lao Gudong nodded. "As far as I know, Elders Gold and Silver this couple have tried over twenty times but they all failed. This third killer's codename is Bandit Evil. He's world-famous for his supreme thieving skills. The rumor is that anyone who fights him will find all the magic treasures they have on their person missing, and they won't know when it happened."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Before the killer's pact was enacted, Steamed Bun Invader had once challenged this Bandit Evil. The result was that all his bloody steamed buns were stolen on the day of the challenge, and in the end he had to run away without fighting."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Little Cold Hands had intended to use the pengci routine on Bandit Evil, but in the end, all his clothes were stolen, even his underwear. Ultimately, he could only get up from the ground and run away without fighting. He was almost charged with pengci and indecent public behavior."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"The unluckiest person was One-Inch Gray... when he challenged Bandit Evil back then, he woke up the next day to find all his hair gone! What was more, Bandit Evil had even smeared hair loss ointment all over his head..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"So I think everyone can already guess why Elders Gold and Silver failed," Lao Gudong said indifferently. "Every time they were going to poison Bandit Evil, they would always find that their poisons had disappeared. At the very beginning, they had even wondered if they had dementia..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong was truly Lao Gudong; in succinct words, he had meticulously broken down the gossip on these terrifying killers on the international ranking list of killers.</p>

    <p>At that moment, the atmosphere in class was already completely fired up. Seeing that he still had some time left on the clock, Lao Gudong finished with the third killer Bandit Evil, and prepared to continue with gossip on the final two killers.</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong obviously enjoyed gossiping and didn't really want to stop. "The killer ranked second on the list is codenamed Cold Wind; his strength is widely acknowledged on the international list of killers. To the best of my knowledge, this killer was a special soldier trained by Huaxiu nation to execute state assassinations. He has helped our nation evade danger many times by preventing state secrets from being stolen by foreign spies, and he comes and goes like a shadow. Once, for an assignment, he single-handedly fought mercenaries sent by western cultivation nations and wiped them all out without sustaining a single injury."</p>

    <p>When he said this, Lao Gudong couldn't help feeling deeply moved in his heart. "Most of the time, the killers on the list leave us the impression that they're cold-hearted. But there are some heroes among them who deserve our reverence... Cold Wind is one of them."</p>

    <p>"One of them? Is there anyone else?" Someone noticed what Lao Gudong was implying.</p>

    <p>"Of course there is." Lao Gudong nodded swiftly. "The next killer I want to talk about is the legendary figure who has been in first place ever since the list was created... Killer Taoist, codenamed Teacher Killer."</p>

    <p>Hearing this renowned name, Wang Ling finally couldn't help raising his eyes.</p>

    <p>Killer Taoist... once again he was hearing this person's name.</p>

    <p>Third Saint, who had defected from Mo Immortal Castle, had previously mistaken Wang Ling as this Killer Taoist.</p>
