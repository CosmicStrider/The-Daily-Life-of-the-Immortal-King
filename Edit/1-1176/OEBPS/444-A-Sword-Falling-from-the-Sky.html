  <h1>Chapter 444 A Sword Falling from the Sky... </h1>

  <div>

    <p>As Lord Diulei's eyes glowed with brown spirit light, the air around him instantly changed.</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God stood inside the ten-meter sword circle, which was supposed to be an invincible field. He had deliberately fused his intrinsic spirit field with his Sword Dao. Although the scope of the intrinsic spirit field was greatly reduced, its advantage was that he wasn't weakened at all by fighting inside someone else's intrinsic spirit field.</p>

    <p>So when Wang Ling had activated his intrinsic spirit field, Evil Sword God hadn't been the least bit afraid. The intrinsic spirit field's greatest asset was the home ground battle advantage that could be used to suppress both the enemy's ability to draw on spirit power and the spirit power itself.</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God thought he was quite the genius to have thought of combining his intrinsic spirit field with his Sword Dao attribute... At the very least in this ten-meter sword circle, even if he was in someone else's field, he was invincible.</p>

    <p>But facing this young man in white now, he was starting to feel the intimidating oppression as he felt stifled by the other party's aura.</p>

    <p>"Who the hell are you?" Evil Sword God asked, although he already had his own suspicions.</p>

    <p>He suspected that this had to be the sword spirit of the peach wood sword that had taken possession of the body of the young man in white.</p>

    <p>But what kind of operation was this?</p>

    <p>The legendary union between man and sword?</p>

    <p>It felt like the situation was already a little beyond Evil Sword God's understanding.</p>

    <p>He felt that there was probably no one else in the world who understood Sword Dao more thoroughly than he did. He wasn't a Venerated Immortal, but he had been able to comprehend the "Great Sword Dao Spell" in advance, had mastered the ten-meter Sword Dao, and had also been talented enough to fuse the "ten-meter Sword Dao" with the "intrinsic spirit field" to create an invincible field.</p>

    <p>But this supreme Sword Dao union between man and sword was a fusion technique that was only possible when the rapport between a spirit sword and its master was at its most intimate.</p>

    <p>Even now, his own rapport with the Heaven-Cleaving sword was still very weak since it originally hadn't belonged to him and had been something that he had stolen.</p>

    <p>Heart full of suspicion, Evil Sword God cast a sidelong glance at the boy on the ground.</p>

    <p>This peach wood sword clearly belonged to this youngster... why was it that even his friend could become one with it?</p>

    <p>He stared at Wang Ling with clouded eyes. Then, very quickly, the corners of his mouth twitched...</p>

    <p>Because he realized that this boy actually wasn't paying any attention at all to the battle in the air; he was actually sitting cross-legged and writing in a book he was holding...</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God opened his Purple Investigative Demon Eye and activated the "Looking at the Horizon with One Eye" technique, and then saw the title of the book: <em>On Talismans </em>...</p>

    <p>He could even see the fine print clearly: <em>The Education Department's designated textbook for the high school Dao Talismans course, meticulously compiled by hundreds of experts, a best seller for sixty years...</em></p>

    <p>Evil Sword God's face twitched. "..."</p>

    <p>Just then in front of him, he saw a flash of light in the hand of the young man in white, who had already been possessed by the sword spirit of the peach wood sword. The sword turned into light particles before dissipating altogether.</p>

    <p>This was the true union between man and sword.</p>

    <p>When a man and sword were one, the sword body would disappear in fusion with the person. The man's body would be the hilt and his hands the blade, and sword qi would permeate his entire being.</p>

    <p>The ten-meter sword circle should have originally been his own invincible field, but Evil Sword God was aghast to realize that the situation was now reversed.</p>

    <p>After the young man in white and the sword had become one, the brown sword qi coming off his body was extremely frightening, like a monarch god holding all the power. Anywhere that sword qi was, the purple sword qi of the Heaven-Cleaving sword purple would retreat.</p>

    <p>It was simply impossible to think of this situation in a normal way, because it didn't conform to common sense at all.</p>

    <p>His ten-meter sword circle was a tried and tested technique, set up with the power of Sword Dao. However, in today's duel, he had the feeling that the power of Sword Dao which he was so proficient in didn't seem to be listening to his commands...</p>

    <p>Most frightening of all was the tremendous pressure he was feeling... He had been floating inside his ten-meter sword circle for a very long time and hadn't moved, not because he was playing at being aloof.</p>

    <p>Instead, it was because he couldn't move at all.</p>

    <p>"Plebe..." Jingke's voice sounded from Lord Diulei's body.</p>

    <p>Hands behind his back, Lord Diulei was enveloped in the brown sword light from top to bottom. Even in the ten-meter sword circle, his aura was crushing.</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God was petrified; this sound actually made fear well up from the depths of his soul.</p>

    <p>His back was instantly covered in cold sweat which soaked his Daoist robe so that it stuck to him.</p>

    <p>He couldn't even speak, and could only use the sword spirit contract to order the Heaven-Cleaving sword's skeleton sword spirit to be his mouthpiece.</p>

    <p>The skeleton sounded like an envoy of hell as it spoke in a very deep voice, "Who are you?"</p>

    <p>"Ling, dislikes, trouble. Have to, solve this, quickly..."</p>

    <p>Jingke replied in Lord Diulei's body, completely ignoring the other party's question.</p>

    <p>The next moment, Lord Diulei took one step and the ground shook. In a split second, the space inside the ten-meter sword circle actually started to collapse inch by inch and all the evil sword qi disappeared as if it had been purified.</p>

    <p>Both the skeleton sword spirit and Evil Sword God were dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>With one step, his ten-meter Sword Dao had crumbled, just like that.</p>

    <p>No, rather than 'crumbled,' Evil Sword God felt that 'rendered void' was a better term for it.</p>

    <p>What manner of thing was the sword spirit of this peach wood sword?</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God frowned deeply. The power of Sword Dao that he was the most proud of had actually been rendered utterly ineffective in front of him. The most terrifying thing, furthermore, was that until now, he still hadn't been able to figure out the sword spirit's origin.</p>

    <p>The human race had always been a species that feared the unknown.</p>

    <p>True Immortals were no exception.</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God thought that he had already reached the pinnacle of Sword Dao in this world, but Jingke's appearance had turned his mind into a complete state of disarray.</p>

    <p>For the first time ever, there was a look of terror in his eyes. He was uneasy and couldn't calm down.</p>

    <p>The last time he had been this agitated was when he had killed his <em>shifu </em>, Sword Immortal Fan Rui...</p>

    <p>Why?</p>

    <p>In the last few centuries, he had relied on his strength to prove that he was the ultimate master of Sword Dao, but why had a person who "broke the rules" suddenly appeared? This boy doing exercise questions on the ground, and the unknown sword spirit who recognized him as its master â€” who the hell were they?!</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God felt that this was an operation even more staggering than the bunch of Nanhan bangzi <sup>1</sup> acting like slags in the ice rink and rashly penalizing competitors from other countries while their own won by force <sup>2</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>('Bangzi' is Chinese slang traditionally used a s a particular ethnic slur.)</dfn>
    
    <br/>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(An obvious jab at the results of the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympic results for women's speed skating.)</dfn>

    <p>Nowadays... were there really referees who didn't return to the bench <sup>3</sup> ?</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(China appealed the penalty, but were declined because it didn't happen within 30 minutes of the end of the game. However, the Chinese coach said that it was because the referees had still been in a meeting that the appeal wasn't submitted in time..)</dfn>

    <p>The ten-meter sword circle had been rendered void and the skeleton sword spirit's figure had also returned to its normal size.</p>

    <p>"It's, over..."</p>

    <p>In the next instant, Evil Sword God watched in alarm as that young man in white disappeared in a flash before his eyes.</p>

    <p>Where was he?</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God was nervous because his Purple Investigative Demon Eye had yet to detect Jingke.</p>

    <p>At that moment, there was a resounding boom, and a figure dropped from above with tremendous pressure!</p>

    <p>This was... `</p>

    <p>The Sword Falling From the Sky?</p>

    <p>At that moment, Evil Sword God suddenly remembered what the unknown sword spirit had said after the body possession...</p>
