  <h1>Chapter 266 RuleBreakers </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It turned into an embarrassing scene.</p>

    <p>When the old man pulled the syringe back, he saw that the needle was bent. His face was as black as pickled vegetables in sauce.</p>

    <p>When all was said and done, he was just an NPC, and was unable to consider matters beyond his realm of understanding... according to the game's script, he would inject neurotoxin into every person who entered the game world while they were in the ambulance, then drop this group of people off at an asylum, where they had to find a way to escape while being chased and hindered by a bunch of zombies, in order to finally find a cure.</p>

    <p>Hence, the old man could only continue stabbing Wang Ling's hand with the syringe like Wet Nurse Rong <sup>1</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Wet Nurse Rong is a character
in the TV drama series "My
Fair Princess" who serves the
Empress. When the Empress
dies, she commits suicide by
stabbing herself ..)</dfn>

    <p>In the end, the old man used up all his syringes.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>When he looked at Wang Ling's long, thin fingers and at the clear and unmarred skin on the back of his hand, the old man finally gave up thinking.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Around five minutes later, the ambulance slowly drove through the iron gates of the asylum, which looked extremely rundown. It was now night in the game, and coupled with the rustling of trees in the shadows around them and the sound of strange cries, it gave the whole game a creepier atmosphere.</p>

    <p>After the ambulance drove through the asylum's iron gates, Wang Ling and Lie Mengmeng noticed sheets of an old newspaper scattered next to the water fountain in the center of the asylum's courtyard. Based on typical game routine, this old newspaper would contain information related to the plot. Initially, it should have been the old man who would explain these details after giving them the injections.</p>

    <p>But because he hadn't been able to give Wang Ling an injection, the old man in the ambulance had "crashed" just like that.</p>

    <p>At that time, Lie Mengmeng had been extremely stupefied.</p>

    <p>He hadn't expected the game to actually have such a strange computer bug...</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng picked up the newspaper to take a look, and was able to glean some useful information. "The plot should be the same as the main headline. This asylum has been infected by a biochemical agent, and all the patients have turned into monsters. What we have to do is collect relevant clues about the antidote, and as much as possible avoid the monsters that will be chasing us, before finally escaping the asylum."</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng pointed at the asylum's main entrance. "After we enter from here, we should be able to find a night vision camera and some batteries in one of the wards. According to the deity lord's mission brief, when we complete each task, we'll get points which we can exchange for additional battery charges."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Wang Ling nodded his head.</p>

    <p>It was actually quite a typical gaming plot, but the main point was that this wasn't an ordinary game, and players could get hurt or die in it. Thus, to break the illusion spell on everyone else, the key was to find the deity lord who ruled over the game.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling quietly opened his Heavenly Eye, and saw the various types of nomological rules that had been woven into the game world.</p>

    <p>This game had obviously been created by an Almighty. Above the Soul Formation stage were realms like the Ascension stage and the Void Refinement stage, and the people above these realms were collectively given the titles Perfected Being, Itinerant Immortal and True Immortal.</p>

    <p>This world had been created by an Itinerant Immortal. Although they weren't on the level of someone like General Yi, they still couldn't be underestimated.</p>

    <p>As for the deity lord, there were no rules concerning him that Wang Ling could glean. Under the camouflage of the game, it was very difficult to pin down the deity lord's true form. Wang Ling gave a silent sigh. The only option he could see right now was to wait for the deity lord to show himself before Wang Ling could make a move.</p>

    <p>While he was thinking, another ambulance drove through the iron gates.</p>

    <p>This was the other team which the old man in the ambulance had mentioned previously.</p>

    <p>"Little sprout, what is this place?" Wang Ling saw a fat man clamber noisily down from the ambulance, followed by a young man in white.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling saw these two individuals, his eyebrows immediately drew together. He never expected that this team would actually be made up of Luo Chuang and Lord Diulei...</p>

    <p>"Ah! Why are Brother Ling and Brother Song also here?"</p>

    <p>The instant the young man in white saw Wang Ling and Lie Mengmeng, he immediately looked pleasantly surprised.</p>

    <p>Because he had visited the Wang family many times before, Lie Mengmeng was quite familiar to him. This was the editor in charge of Great Senior Wang, whose real name was Song Zikai! It was impossible for Lord Diulei to forget him!</p>

    <p>It was clear that these two were already half-friends. While they usually didn't exchange many words, they often ran into each other at the Wang family's small villa.</p>

    <p>"How did you get here?" Lie Mengmeng asked curiously.</p>

    <p>"In the morning, when I was at Luo Chuang's shop, he suddenly received an express delivery. We opened it to take a look, and then somehow found ourselves here." Lord Diulei scratched his head and smiled. "An old man tried to inject us with something in the ambulance just now. Then, I just acted a little in self-defense..."</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling took a look.</p>

    <p>Then, he noticed the ambulance that Lord Diulei had ridden in on.</p>

    <p>He saw that the old man in the back of the ambulance had also "crashed." Furthermore, his body was stuck full of needles.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>If the script developed in typical fashion, then as Lie Mengmeng had said, after the NPC old man in the ambulance injected them with the neurotoxin and sent them to the asylum, the plot should then move forward.</p>

    <p>If they followed the script direction, after the old man injected them with the neurotoxin, the game would straightaway maneuver the ambulance to directly burst through the asylum's main doors... Most unfortunately, however, it had already been game over for the NPC old men one after another before the script could unfold normally.</p>

    <p>In front of the asylum doors, Luo Chuang looked at their surroundings, a slightly gloomy expression on his face.</p>

    <p>The instant that Luo Chuang and Lord Diulei had entered the game, they had already known that it absolutely wasn't a normal one. It had been refashioned using the foundation of the original Escape game; even the game developer was different.</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry to have gotten you involved. This was probably targeted at me." Luo Chuang's expression was a little downcast.</p>

    <p>"Why is Brother Luo so sure?" Lord Diulei thought it was a little strange.</p>

    <p>"Two days ago, I received a threatening letter, but I didn't take it seriously at the time." Luo Chuang laughed a little. "But I never thought that the other party would actually use this type of method to force me to come here. I heard previously that other people in the same smithing line of work also received the same letter, so I'm guessing that there are other people here besides the four of us."</p>

    <p>"What's the other party's objective?" Lord Diulei asked.</p>

    <p>"I'm not sure what their objective is, but one thing is for certain, and that is that they're looking for a smith. Anyone who has something to do with refining weapons has been caught up in this. You've been to my shop before, which is probably why you got pulled into it." Luo Chuang squinted. "This illusion spell is very powerful; we probably won't be able to get out with our strength alone, so for now, we can only follow the game's script and see how it goes..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei looked solemnly at Lie Mengmeng. "Don't worry, Brother Song, we'll protect you!"</p>

    <p>However, Lie Mengmeng seemed unaware of the danger. This damn otaku stood at the entrance and gazed at the shut doors of the asylum as he asked, "So how do we get in? According to the script, it should have been the old man to maneuver the ambulance to crash directly through the doors."</p>

    <p>"Er... is that the only way to set the plot in motion?" Lord Diulei stroked his chin.</p>

    <p>"In theory, yes." Lie Mengmeng nodded without hesitation.</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Wang Ling had a relieved expression on his face.</p>

    <p>Actually, doing it this way was better. And so, after Lie Mengmeng said this, he saw Wang Ling walk toward the ambulances behind them.</p>

    <p>He saw Wang Ling pick up one of the ambulances with one arm and fling it straight at the asylum's main entrance like a baseball pitch...</p>

    <p>Bang!</p>

    <p>The asylum's doors were smashed open.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Lie Mengmeng didn't know if it was just his imagination, but it seemed like he had heard someone say a faint "MMP" in the air!</p>
