  <h1>Chapter 419 Immortal Toya's Indirect Attack </h1>

  <div>

    <p>After listening to Immortal Toya's story, Lord Diulei sank into deep thought.</p>

    <p>On the immortal boat, several beads of cold sweat ran down Immortal Toya's forehead as he cast stealthy sidelong glances at Senior Immortal next to him. Ninety percent of the story he had told just now was true, while he had exaggerated and made up the remaining ten percent. In this way, he expounded on the story of a grieving man whose wife had cheated on him, and who had divorced her in hatred. After her shotgun marriage, he experienced all sorts of torment and became disillusioned with life.</p>

    <p>Actually, while this story might sound very tragic, Immortal Toya felt that it wasn't a bad ending. At the very least, after it was all over, the Nalan leader had been able to break free of this incident; if he was still alive now, his cultivation would be profoundly high.</p>

    <p>However, after inheriting this ancestral land a century ago, Immortal Toya had no longer heard any news about Zen Master Nalan... It was possible that he had already passed away.</p>

    <p>"After listening to this story, what do you think?" Immortal Toya turned slightly and asked.</p>

    <p>He felt that his prompt this time was obvious enough. From the first story about the immortal boat to the second one about the Nalan leader, the two keywords were, undoubtedly, number one: children.</p>

    <p>Number two: shotgun marriage.</p>

    <p>Of course, the most important word was: marriage!</p>

    <p>This was already no longer a hint, but a blatant prompt! And it wasn't just evidence, but bona fide ironclad proof!</p>

    <p>After Immortal Toya's ongoing hints, Lord Diulei raised his head after deep thought and looked at him. "Brother To, after listening to both your stories..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "Mm, is there anything you want to say?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "It seems like everything you've acquired, from this ancestral land to this immortal boat, was due to some other family's misfortune?"</p>

    <p>"..." Unexpectedly, Immortal Toya was unable to respond!</p>

    <p>"That's bad luck! How about I look for a diviner I know to predict your fortune? I'm not very good at it." The young man in white had a very serious expression as he looked at Immortal Toya. "By the way, Brother To, why do I feel like there's something wrong with your expression today when you look at me?"</p>

    <p>"It's nothing... You're thinking too much... The island's in front, I've already asked the old aunties to cook something, let's talk later after we sit down." Immortal Toya sighed in his heart; now that his second plan had failed, he only had one more plan he could carry out.</p>

    <p>It was the third and final one...</p>

    <p>If it didn't succeed, he would have died for a good cause.</p>

    <p>"Brother To, you even specially prepared food? I just came to give you a gift, you didn't have to be so polite," said Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>He had never been to Chrysanthemum Island, and had planned to do a surreptitious circle around it before leaving.</p>

    <p>After giving one ring to Immortal Toya, he still had six left, and later he would have to distribute them to Cailian Zhenren, Nine Times Man and the rest.</p>

    <p>"It won't take up too much time. I've already prepared an immortal car, we can eat as we drive, and at the same time Senior Immortal can take a look around the island," Immortal Toya said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"Great! Since I'm here... Brother To, you're too courteous!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei could only accept his hospitality.</p>

    <p>When they reached the island, there were chrysanthemum gardens everywhere, meticulously arranged according to color and breed. It gave off a picturesque charm from afar.</p>

    <p>At the entrance to the island was a stele on which a poem had been engraved in gold lettering: <em>While picking chrysanthemums beneath the Eastern fence, My gaze upon the Southern mountain rests.</em></p>

    <p>Lord Diulei took a deep breath and felt relaxed all over!</p>

    <p>The spirit qi on Chrysanthemum Island was ten times denser than in the city. It wasn't just because the spirit chrysanthemums had a natural ability to absorb spirit qi, it also had to do with the island's unique fengshui.</p>

    <p>Back then, the Nalan Clan had had an excellent reputation. The family definitely had to have their reasons for taking note of this land and inhabiting this territory.</p>

    <p>"If I wasn't in a hurry today, I'd definitely stay for a bit. Brother To, it's so comfortable here," Lord Diulei couldn't help praising.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya laughed aloud. "You flatter me, Senior Immortal. The future is long, you'll get the chance! If you want to come and breathe in the chrysanthemums in the future, let me know ahead of time, and I'll arrange everything."</p>

    <p>"...Breathe in chrysanthemums?"</p>

    <p>"One inhale of these spirit chrysanthemums can extend your life! These days, there are some people who inhale the scent of cats and some who inhale the scent of dogs... It's pretty good for you to come here and breathe in the chrysanthemums."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>They didn't speak on the journey as they walked deep into a chrysanthemum maze. It was only now that Lord Diulei realized that each chrysanthemum garden was one part of the maze.</p>

    <p>Anyone under the Soul Formation stage were restricted from flying here; once they were caught in the maze, it would be very hard for them to get out.</p>

    <p>"My ancestors set up this maze to protect the elixirs refined in the core furnace," Immortal Toya said. "My Toya Clan used to be a great clan which mass produced elixirs. We would have more than we could handle at the end of each year, so we would hire some outside alchemists, and put them up in the guestrooms on the periphery of the island. However, some of these people would steal things, which was why this maze was set up.</p>

    <p>"But there's no use for it now. The current legal system is comprehensive, and we have surveillance cameras everywhere. Anyone with the least bit of brain wouldn't just come bursting in." Immortal Toya shrugged his shoulders and smiled slightly.</p>

    <p>"Why not pull down the maze?"</p>

    <p>"It was something my ancestors set up, and we've already applied for a patent. It's now a UNESCO heritage site."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Previously, several people from Nanhan nation came to learn how to build a maze. I was afraid that they would claim they developed it, so I applied for a patent in advance!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"In the future, once I no longer refine elixirs, I also plan to open up the island as a tourist destination. Aren't escape rooms all the rage now? This chrysanthemum maze is a selling point!"</p>

    <p>"As usual, Brother To has a keen sense for business." Lord Diulei laughed.</p>

    <p>Finally, Lord Diulei saw that they had stopped in front of an immortal car.</p>

    <p>At that time, he couldn't help asking, "By the way, what food have you prepared?"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya patted his head secretly; he had let himself be distracted by Senior Immortal, and had almost forgotten the actual matter at hand!</p>

    <p>But now he knew his chance had come!</p>

    <p>"Just home cooking, nothing special..." Immortal Toya looked fixedly at the young man in white. His eyes turned austere, making Lord Diulei shudder with a chill.</p>

    <p>"Mandarin duck hot pot <sup>1</sup> ..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Refers to a hot pot with two compartments for different types of broth, but mandarin ducks also refer to a loving couple.)</dfn>

    <p>"Wife Cake <sup>2</sup> ..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Literal translation for a type of flaky Chinese pastry.)</dfn>

    <p>"Fuqi feiqian <sup>3</sup> ..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(A spicy Sichuan dish of beef slices and offal. The literal translation is 'husband and wife lung pieces .. ')</dfn>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Realization finally dawned on Lord Diulei at this moment. "Brother To, I feel you were a bit strange today... are you trying to tell me something?"</p>

    <p>"Senior Immortal, you've finally realized it?" Immortal Toya was inadvertently pleased.</p>

    <p>But before he could be happy for long, Lord Diulei said something which directly crushed him.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei let out a heavy sigh and patted Immortal Toya on the shoulder. "I know it hasn't been easy for you raising Jin Shi and Yin Shi all these years... Indeed, now is the time to find these two a stepmother."</p>

    <p>"???"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "That... that's not it, Senior Immortal..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Don't be shy - I know a girl called ShenLe <sup>4</sup> , she's not bad; how about you add her on WeChat?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>4</sup>('My God!' In Chinese)</dfn>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "..."</p>
