  <h1>Chapter 507 With All Due Respect... </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling sent a text message that afternoon, and Zhuo Yi quickly drove from his office directly to Lord Diulei's place. Since the incident with the Demon Hunters Association had yet to be fully resolved, Zhuo Yi, who was the chief commander of this operation, even had to sacrifice his weekend and remain at the office.</p>

    <p>The entire affair was in fact completely over; the last thing missing was the capture of the legendary President Bai, and the net had already closed as far as it could go all over the country.</p>

    <p>A large police force had been mobilized this time; not only was this a show of strength in the face of the illegal trafficking of spirit beasts, it was also a reflection of the country's vow to uphold its promises.</p>

    <p>After the holy beasts had been wantonly massacred by human cultivators back then due to lies and slander, laws against the mistreatment and murder of spirit beasts had always existed, but the punishments imposed clearly weren't severe enough.</p>

    <p>In recent years in particular, quite a number of spirit beasts had become in critical danger of becoming extinct, and there was a real need to draw people's attention to this problem.</p>

    <p>So this time, when Zhuo Yi received the message from Wang Ling saying that he had a lead on that President Bai of the Demon Hunters Association, he abruptly jumped out of his chair! As for the General Administration of 100 Schools, when Zhuo Yi wasn't in the office, the deputy director Zhong Lang was still around, so there was nothing to worry about at all.</p>

    <p>On the road, Zhuo Yi was both nervous and excited; nervous because he didn't know if he could finally catch that President Bai, and excited because he could see his <em>shifu </em>again!</p>

    <p>Although Zhuo Yi felt that he hadn't really learned anything substantial while he was with Wang Ling, and was forever just being a scapegoat... he was actually enjoying himself; to become <em>shifu's </em> scapegoat was an honor!</p>

    <p>Moreover, he deeply felt like this was a test of his intelligence; he didn't think that Wang Ling had truly acknowledged him yet. You had to know that in the fairy tale, when the tiger treated the cat as its teacher, it wasn't like the cat would teach it to climb trees! Zhuo Yi didn't think he was a tiger, and he probably would never reach his <em>shifu's </em> level in this lifetime, but he still felt that he at least learned something!</p>

    <p>For example, he was becoming better and better at being a scapegoat!</p>

    <p>And most importantly, Zhuo Yi felt that he was becoming more and more slick and sly at handling things! This was all thanks to his <em>shifu's </em> intangible and earnest guidance.</p>

    <p>Learning was a gradual process and the future stretched ahead of him, so Zhuo Yi wasn't anxious at all.</p>

    <p>By the time he arrived at Lord Diulei's place, it hadn't actually been very long, just about half an hour or so.</p>

    <p>On the way over, Zhuo Yi had roughly asked Lord Diulei about the situation, and had learned about that forest fairy "Mr Lu."</p>

    <p>At the villa, Xiao Yin jumped up to open the door.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi had heard about Xiao Yin in detail from his <em>shifu </em>Wang Ling previously, and it was in fact Zhuo Yi who had even engineered to secretly transport Xiao Yin from Winter city to Songhai city at the time. But he had only ever seen Xiao Yin's beast form, and it was his first time seeing the latter's human form.</p>

    <p>So when they met this time, Zhuo Yi was slightly dazed.</p>

    <p>He thought that as possibly the last living holy beast in the world today, Xiao Yin was far more lively and cheerful than he had imagined.</p>

    <p>And his human appearance was really a little too beautiful with a fair face and long silver hair, barefooted and dressed casually... In Zhuo Yi's view, he had a lot of potential to become a big shot in women's clothing!</p>

    <p>" <em>Shifu </em>Zhuo! Master has been waiting for you!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin greeted Zhuo Yi and led him inside.</p>

    <p>He had a lot of respect for Zhuo Yi, who had helped him out a lot when he had sent Xiao Yin to Songhai city back then. Xiao Yin had seen how busy Zhuo Yi had been the whole time as he made the preparations. And most importantly, Zhuo Yi was the personal inheriting disciple officially approved by Master!</p>

    <p>So Xiao Yin thought it made utterly perfect sense to call Zhuo Yi <em>Shifu</em>Zhuo.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin took Zhuo Yi to the hole he had punched open earlier, and the latter drew in a sharp breath when he saw it.</p>

    <p>What the hell... what was this?</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin waved in invitation. " <em>Shifu </em>Zhuo, please come in. This is the green channel!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..." What damn green channel!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After Zhuo Yi arrived and everyone was in place, Mr Lu began to confess what he knew about President Bai as well as whatever secrets he himself was aware of.</p>

    <p>"First of all, Mr Lu, with regard to what you said earlier about wanting to divulge information on President Bai of the Demon Hunters Association, is there anything else you want to tell us?" Zhuo Yi was in charge of asking questions while Lord Diulei took down notes on the side in a small notebook.</p>

    <p>Because he was constantly out "courting death," Great Death-Courting Senior Lord Diulei was fairly experienced in criminal investigation, which he had learned from his friends at the police station. He actually had quite a number of friends at the police station, and Lord Diulei realized that his relationship with them had deepened a fair bit thanks to Xiao Yin.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, he discovered that Xiao Yin had a somewhat toxic trait: whenever he went out, he would definitely wind up being carted off to the police station...</p>

    <p>"Mm! I want to make a report, I want to expose him! I'll tell you everything I know about the countless crimes President Bai has committed!"</p>

    <p>Sitting obediently on the floor, Mr Lu gave a full account: "This President Bai's full name is Bai Zhe. Let me start with how strong President Bai is; this man is extremely powerful. From my contact with him, President Bai's overall combat strength is around True Immortal level. And the most crucial thing is the self-healing system art he created himself, which can be considered monstrous. Furthermore, it seems that his physique is a little unique."</p>

    <p>"Self-healing system art?" Lord Diulei was blank.</p>

    <p>"Yes, I've seen it with my own eyes!" Mr Lu nodded. "Our Tree clan's ability to heal can already be considered heaven-defying, but Bai Zhe's ability is several hundred times stronger; no matter how big a wound is, it will heal completely in a blink of an eye."</p>

    <p>"Can you elaborate on what his physique is like?" Zhuo Yi then asked.</p>

    <p>"Bai Zhe's physique is a little unusual, but I don't know much about it as I've really never seen it... I've never heard of a human with an ability to heal which far surpasses the Tree clan's. And most importantly, even if Brother Xiao Yin could use the inhibitive effect which he has on serious injuries, it might not make a difference to this person's self-healing ability."</p>

    <p>Mr Lu sighed and said, "All these years, Bai Zhe has had nothing to fear given his self-healing ability and his strong defense. Additionally, that black magic umbrella he carries with him can instantly create barriers and set up a space to help him escape danger. He comes and goes like a ghost as if no one was ever there..."</p>

    <p>A human cultivator with a self-healing ability which surpassed that of the Tree clan?</p>

    <p>Listening to all this on the side, Wang Ling was a little interested, but completely unruffled.</p>

    <p>To be honest, he didn't think President Bai was any kind of threat to him.</p>

    <p>It was clear that Lord Diulei and Zhuo Yi also had the same thought, and their expressions were really too calm. When Mr Lu finished painting this picture with his words, he had initially thought that the people present would be a little amazed at least...</p>

    <p>At that point, Xiao Yin suddenly turned to look at Mr Lu and ask very emphatically, "I'm very sorry, I have a question I want to ask Mr Lu..."</p>

    <p>Mr Lu: "Say it, please..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "If we use a mousepad as the unit of measure, may I ask, with all due respect... how many mousepads would Master need to throw to kill this President Bai, Bai Zhe?"</p>

    <p>Mr Lu: "..."</p>
