  <h1>Chapter 339 Stay There and Don't Move </h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Afterwards, she discussed it with me, and she stopped writing in order to become a full-time housewife to take care of you." Father Wang was still leaning against the sofa with a cigarette in his mouth, but the gloom in his eyes had already disappeared, replaced with the happiness of recalling beautiful memories.</p>

    <p>After thinking about it carefully, Wang Ling felt that this was the first time he had heard his dad talk about the past. He had also never expected Mother Wang to have written novels before he had been born; furthermore, it seemed that her writing had been pretty good.</p>

    <p>What's the book called?</p>

    <p>Curious, he couldn't help asking the question telepathically.</p>

    <p>Father Wang cupped his chin and thought for a moment. "Back then, your mom's pen name was One Man One Dick. She wrote a cultivation romance light novel called Half-Immortal Summer Lady which was published."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Unexpectedly, this book sold well after it was published, but many readers wrote to the publishing house to complain about her pen name. After that, your mom decided to change to a new one before she started writing her new book. But even after she had finished writing her main outline, she wouldn't tell me what her new pen name was going to be. It was supposedly going to be a novel about the cultivation world, and I looked forward to it for a very long time."</p>

    <p>When he said that, Father Wang ground his cigarette butt into the ashtray and couldn't help smiling. "I reckon if you ask Little Ming about this, he might know."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "???"</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "Do you know what a time capsule is? When your mom decided to put her writing away, she sealed all her drafts in a capsule and gave it to Little Ming. At that time, the papers your mom wrote her drafts on were very rough in texture, and Little Ming said this method could prevent them from becoming damaged. I'm guessing that when he picked up the drafts and outline then, he probably read them."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Wang Ling couldn't help twitching his lips. If other people couldn't resist reading them, then Wang Ming... indeed, he would probably do it. Furthermore, Wang Ming actually enjoyed reading novels. He couldn't cultivate, but he would frequently imitate the plot of a cultivation novel and end up doing something mad.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's curiosity was aroused again. Wang Ming was coming by later anyway; he just had to pull him upstairs later and ask him about it. Wang Ling really wanted to know what that unfinished work was like.</p>

    <p>Father Wang had yet to update his novel today, so it was easy for Wang Ling to guess that Lie Mengmeng was most likely here to prompt him to do so.</p>

    <p>"Hi! Wang Ling! You're home!" Lie Mengmeng grinned as he greeted him, but his face instantly turned gloomy as he stared helplessly at Father Wang. "Brother Wang... why haven't you posted an update today? Don't you already have a lot of drafts on hand?"</p>

    <p>Father Wang sipped unhurriedly on his coffee and answered, "Mm, I've used all of them up."</p>

    <p>The corners of Lie Mengmeng's mouth twitched. "I recall there were two hundred thousand existing words."</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "Mm, all used up."</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng: "..."</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng buried his face in his hands. "Brother Wang, control yourself! Finishing too quickly isn't nice!"</p>

    <p>Father Wang and Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng: "Go upstairs, I'll help you sort out the rest of the plot."</p>

    <p>Father Wang shook his head. "It doesn't have to do with the plot this time. There's a new character in the novel, but I'm not sure how to depict this person. The best would be to find someone to act it out; I've already prepared all the stage props."</p>

    <p>"New character?" Lie Mengmeng rested his chin on his clasped hands as he gave it some thought, and after a while, he nodded. "Then I'll be the one to act it out for you as usual. What's the character's style?"</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "A gothic Lolita."</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng smiled. "No big deal, it's just cross-dressing, and it wouldn't be my first time anyway."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "There's candle wax involved!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "I want the most realistic reactions! Only in this way will readers feel its authenticity!"</p>

    <p>Tears welled up in Lie Mengmeng's eyes. "Come on then! I'm prepared to sacrifice myself for the organization!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>So... what on earth kind of PLAY was this?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ming came early in the afternoon even before the old man and Mother Wang had come back from buying groceries. When Wang Ling opened the door, he saw Wang Ming standing there with a depressed expression, Zhai Yin close behind him.</p>

    <p>Last time, Wang Ling had locked Zhai Yin outside because Mother Wang and the old man had happened to be cooking inside at the time, and thus hadn't seen him. But now that they had yet to come back, leaving Zhai Yin standing outside the door wouldn't be too good, so he grudgingly let him in.</p>

    <p>To be exact, this was Wang Ling and Zhai Yin's second time meeting face to face.</p>

    <p>In some sense, Wang Ming thought that they were pretty similar: they had the same facial paralysis. The difference was that Wang Ling had been born with his, while Zhai Yin's poker face was probably a result of being disillusioned by his life experiences.</p>

    <p>After he had sent Wang Ming back the last time, Zhai Yin had actually started to secretly investigate Wang Ling, but most unfortunately, everything he had checked out was all covered in mosaic tiles.</p>

    <p>This time, Wang Ling had directly let him in, naturally because he had his own reasons. Once Wang Ming stepped inside, Wang Ling fixed his eyes on Zhai Yin behind him.</p>

    <p>This gaze straightaway froze Zhai Yin in place.</p>

    <p>However weathered a veteran he was, this deeply imposing manner frightened Zhai Yin into breaking out in a cold sweat. It felt like some tremendous pressure welling up from the depths of the soul.</p>

    <p>It was very obvious that this was a warning.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming pulled Wang Ling behind him and stared at Zhai Yin. "I don't care if you follow me around outside, but this is my younger brother's home, and it's also like my own. If you dare cause trouble here, I'll have President Qi dismiss you."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin's eyes turned deep with emotion. "Try if you can."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming crossed his arms and sighed. He forgot that this guy might be persuaded but couldn't be forced!</p>

    <p>Then Wang Ming simply stretched out his hand and tugged Zhai Yin to the sofa in the living room. "Sit down! You can watch TV or sit here and cultivate, it's up to you."</p>

    <p>After saying that, he suddenly smiled craftily to himself as he looked at Zhai Yin. "Stay there and don't move, I'll go get you a tangerine <sup>1</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is adapted from a famous line in the well-known short story 'Retreating Figure' by writer Zhu Ziqing ..)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"?" Before Zhai Yin could react, the two brothers had already swiftly gone upstairs.</p>
