  <h1>Chapter 1042 The Second Force</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Number 60 High was already on course to be promoted to a key city high school even though the fragments of the Jade Scroll of School History were still being collected. Like every other key city high school candidate, Number 60 High had to go through the General Administration of 100 Schools' procedure, and needed Zhuo Yi's personal examination and approval before he signed off on the matter.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi had been planning to visit the summer break school construction teams from Number 60 High and some other candidate schools today, but on his way, he received a direct call from Secretary Dakang.</p>

    <p>"Little Zhuozi, something's happened at Magic Treasure Development University; it seems that the Immortal Arts Mobile Squadron was deployed. A police officer called Gao Tian is handling matters at the scene. You go and take a look," said Secretary Dakang.</p>

    <p>"Old leader... I'm on my way right now to meet the school construction teams. Since the police are already there, it won't make a difference if I go or not..." Zhuo Yi wiped at his sweat.</p>

    <p>His main fear was going over, only to find that the case had already wound up and it would ineffably be chalked up to him yet again...</p>

    <p>The Police Bureau's Chief Zhao was already unhappy about the incidents with the Old Devil and the Master of Immortal Mansion - Zhuo Yi felt that interfering with regular police work was indeed inappropriate.</p>

    <p>But Secretary Dakang didn't think so. "Little Zhuozi, you're wrong. The General Administration of 100 Schools is in charge of all schools to begin with, including universities! The Police Bureau is handling the hostage situation, but what the General Administration of 100 Schools wants to deal with is building school discipline. Most of the online public opinion about that plagiarism case from three years ago is pretty negative. You go and fix school discipline, and the Police Bureau will rescue the hostages. There's no conflict of interest at all!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>"We must treat these issues of school violence and academic cheating seriously and rectify them! As for that case from three years ago, I've already decided: you've been given special approval to investigate it."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Already approved? I... I haven't received the document..."</p>

    <p>"It should be on the way." Phone in hand, Secretary Dakang glanced at the time on his computer screen before saying to Zhuo Yi, "Little Zhuozi, you should be in your car, right?"</p>

    <p>"That's right, Zhong Lang is driving." Zhuo Yi nodded.</p>

    <p>"Wind down the window," said Secretary Dakang.</p>

    <p>"Alright..." Zhuo Yi followed the instruction, and just as the window went down, a document flew right into the car like a hidden weapon. Outside, a courier on a flying sword greeted Zhuo Yi elegantly. "General Director Zhuo, your express package has been delivered! Remember to give us five stars!"</p>

    <p>Secretary Dakang: "Immortal Communication Express, Live to Deliver! Extremely reliable! There is absolutely nothing to worry about when you send a parcel with them, not like Federal Divine Express misrouting parcels<sup>1</sup>!"</p>
    
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Refers to Huawei's allegations that FedEx diverted some of their packages to the US.)</dfn>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>"Alright, that's all I have to say. We have to handle school discipline and the students' mindset. Little Zhuozi, I know you've been very busy recently with the development of key city high schools and with visiting some Golden Core universities to understand the problems they're having. Just like that case of international students being assigned three study partners each<sup>3</sup>, you must be strict in handling this matter!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(Shandong University received backlash for its "buddy system," which seemed to afford international students unfair privileges..)</dfn>

    <p>"Yes!" Zhuo Yi nodded earnestly.</p>

    <p>"On the road from poverty to prosperity, our nation has long become used to viewing the world fairly. Many special privileges no longer exist, and more and more, everyone is being treated equally. Isn't it a joy to have friends from afar come? Being neither servile nor overbearing is the best form of respect<sup>3</sup>!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(Taken from a comment in People's Daily.)</dfn>

    <p>Secretary Dakang sighed emotionally. "It's not easy to rectify a school's unhealthy practices, but as long as we have outstanding civil servants like you, I believe that these schools can surely be led toward establishing new trends! After you're done with all this, I'll approve leave for you myself!"</p>

    <p>"Yes, leader! I'll make sure to fulfil my duty!" Zhuo Yi nodded.</p>

    <p>The old Secretary's heartfelt and logical words were so convincing that Zhuo Yi had no way of declining this assignment. As a matter of fact, Zhuo Yi had already been following the incident at Magic Treasure Development University in the car, and had planned to go over and take a look at the situation after he was done with his work.</p>

    <p>"Little Lang, change of plans - head for Magic Treasure Development University. It's an assignment from the old Secretary himself," Zhuo Yi said in the back of the car.</p>

    <p>"Then what about the school construction teams? It's almost time for the meeting..."</p>

    <p>"I'll handle the issue with Magic Treasure Development University and leave the school construction teams to you. You've worked under me for so long, I trust your abilities. In addition, pay more attention to the materials - don't let them stint on the materials and skimp on the job. If anything happens, you'll have to answer for it! I have faith in you!"</p>

    <p>"Yes! I'll make sure to fulfil my duty!" Zhong Lang nodded earnestly, his tone the same as the one Zhuo Yi had used when talking with the old Secretary.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>And then... there was no then...</p>

    <p>Zhong Lang drove Zhuo Yi to the scene, and the police officers who saw him arrive couldn't help wiping at their cold sweat.</p>

    <p>"You go and say it... I don't dare... isn't offending General Director Zhuo asking for trouble?"</p>

    <p>"So it's fine to offend Chief Zhao?"</p>

    <p>"Of course not..."</p>

    <p>"Then you go!"</p>

    <p>"Shit, why me?!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was looking for someone to explain what the current situation was, when a deputy team leader was pushed to the front by the other officers. "General Director Zhuo... this is a hostage situation. If you've come to inspect our work, we welcome you, but please don't interfere too much."</p>

    <p>"How do you define interfering too much?" Zhuo Yi laughed. "Let me ask you, this hostage situation, where is it happening?"</p>

    <p>"At a university."</p>

    <p>"Then what area does the General Administration of 100 Schools oversee?"</p>

    <p>The deputy team leader: "..."</p>

    <p>"It's fine, I'm not stealing your job from you." Zhuo Yi patted his shoulder. "Deputy Liu, don't be nervous. Rescuing the hostages is your job, while mine is to investigate the case from three years ago, so there's no conflict of interest."</p>

    <p>After saying that, Zhuo Yi slapped the document with the old Secretary's signature on Deputy Liu's chest. "This is a document personally issued by Secretary Dakang of the Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools. He wants me to thoroughly investigate the plagiarism case from three years ago. If there are no objections, I believe Chief Zhao shouldn't have any complaints."</p>

    <p>"..." Deputy Team Leader Liu took the document with trembling hands, his courage in speaking out earlier completely swept away.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "So, what's the current situation?"</p>

    <p>Deputy Team Leader Liu: "There hasn't been any movement for some time... The lives of the hostages aren't under threat for now, but the Immortal Arts Mobile Squadron is already prepared to take action. We've taken into consideration the abnormal improvement in the suspect's realm, possibly from taking illicit drugs or cultivating forbidden spells, which can cause mental instability."</p>

    <p>"Then did he provide any new evidence for the case from three years ago?"</p>

    <p>"Not yet so far."</p>

    <p>"What about the Liu Yi who was mentioned before? If Zheng Tianqiang was making empty accusations, wouldn't Liu Yi have stepped out to refute them?"</p>

    <p>"We've already sent people to look for him," Deputy Team Leader Liu replied.</p>

    <p>At that moment, a police officer ran over in a flurry. "Deputy Team Leader Liu, there's a problem!"</p>

    <p>"What now?"</p>

    <p>"We've found Liu Yi! He was at home!"</p>

    <p>"Bring him over!"</p>

    <p>"He's dead... He died the same way as those at the apartments..."</p>

    <p>"Could this be... dead men tell no tales?" Zhuo Yi thought that the case was becoming more interesting.</p>

    <p>Looking at the current situation, it was clear that apart from Father Zheng, there was a second force "working hard" because of that case from back then.</p>
