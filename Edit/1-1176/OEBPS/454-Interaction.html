  <h1>Chapter 454 Interaction! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>The audience in the live stream room hadn't expected Lord Island to activate the guess and gamble function at all, or to actually change the room title to:<em>Katana in Hand! Game Over! The Whole Game is My Pig Farm - One Hit, One Peppa Pig!</em></p>

    <p>The live stream room's bullet messages suddenly exploded.</p>

    <p>"What the fuck! Lord Island! Why are you taking it out on Peppa Pig?!"</p>

    <p>"My Peppa might say MMP if she knew."</p>

    <p>"Kill twenty people with a katana... Lord Island, do you think this is a knife battle? Everyone is using guns, how can you possibly fight them?"</p>

    <p>"Kill twenty people or more, yes or no? That's easy!"</p>

    <p>It was clear that thanks to Lord Island's eye-catching guess and gamble event and room title, the bullet messages had directly exploded. Sweeping his gaze over them, Wang Ling realized that most of them were still calling Lord Island into question. Some live streamers had even come running over to pay Daoist Guang's live stream room a "visit" and diss him for using this click bait title to attract more viewers.</p>

    <p>But it was a fact that this gimmick was working.</p>

    <p>Because of the influence of these big live streamers paying Daoist Guang a visit and dissing him, the number of viewers in the live stream room continued to climb, and from over two million people, had soared to over 2.8 million.</p>

    <p>This comprised Lord Island's Light Chasers and fans of other live streamers, and even more of them were casual viewers just joining in on the fun.</p>

    <p>In that moment, Wang Ling suddenly felt that Daoist Guang had a talent for live streaming...</p>

    <p>In a short few days, live stream audience numbers were already constant at over two million, and currently, it looked like it would even reach three million. The most important thing was that there were new viewers every day who, amused by Daoist Guang's live stream, would become "Light Chasers."</p>

    <p>On the first day of Daoist Guang's live stream, eight hundred thousand people had already purchased the "Light Chaser" tag that cost ten HNY. Now, the number of Light Chasers had broken the watershed million mark.</p>

    <p>Just as Chen Chao and Guo Hao had said previously, this had broken the live streaming platform's record of the past few years.</p>

    <p>There was no other new live streamer on any other live streaming platform who could match Daoist Guang's numbers in the first week of his live stream.</p>

    <p>Although luck was a factor, even more of it naturally depended on the live streaming rule which Daoist Guang had swiftly mastered.</p>

    <p>What was the first rule of a live stream?</p>

    <p>It was interaction!</p>

    <p>While interacting with the audience, live streamers could provide entertaining commentary while still being mindful of their language as well as make idle talk about trending current events. Using this as a foundation, live streamers could widen their scope to keep the live stream fresh for old viewers and at the same time attract new ones. It was obvious that Daoist Guang had managed to do this.</p>

    <p>Moreover, he had also learned how to use "gimmicks" to attract viewers.</p>

    <p>The bullet messages now weren't as "clean" as before, with a lot of them expressing doubts, plus there were a lot of fans of other live streamers sending reverse fan <sup>1</sup> bullet messages as well as provoking messages.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This refers to anti-fans who, rather than outright criticizing or slandering someone, take the opposite route of praising them so exaggeratedly that other people can't help but hate them ..)</dfn>

    <p>However, Wang Ling felt that Daoist Guang wouldn't care at all; after all, as a True Immortal with a highly cultivated mind, he wouldn't pay the slightest bit of attention if people started cursing him out in the live stream room, to say nothing of those voicing their doubts.</p>

    <p>In the end, after audience numbers increased to a certain point, trolls were inevitable.</p>

    <p>Actually, Wang Ling was pretty worried about the personal safety of these trolls, because the biggest characteristic of trolls was that while they were savage online, they were cowards in real life; a troll wouldn't track a network connection and WIFI back to a live streamer to beat them up.</p>

    <p>But as a True Immortal, Daoist Guang could do it easily enough...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At that moment, the bullet messages were setting the tone for the live stream.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling cupped his chin as he watched on curiously with the melon-eating masses.</p>

    <p>"Report, report! This live streamer is being deliberately gimmicky!"</p>

    <p>This message could be considered pretty good compared with another more malicious one...</p>

    <p>"According to the rules of the live streaming platform, if a live streamer is judged to have used click bait content, they'll be banned for seven to fifteen days! Everybody just leave. This live streamer is already old news; remember to burn incense for him before you leave."</p>

    <p>A dead live streamer?</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang glanced at this bullet message and was instantly speechless; he realized he actually couldn't refute this!</p>

    <p>Because theoretically speaking...</p>

    <p>He was indeed already dead!</p>

    <p>However, Daoist Guang didn't ban the bullet messages calling him into question or even those that jeered at or cursed him out.</p>

    <p>This was the result he was looking for.</p>

    <p>It wasn't bad to be doubted sometimes.</p>

    <p>As far as Daoist Guang was concerned, once he already had a fan base, the doubts could only help to increase his fan numbers.</p>

    <p>He looked at the number of viewers in his live stream room.</p>

    <p>It hadn't even been five minutes since he had changed the title.</p>

    <p>The number had already broken three million - this was an unprecedented rate of increase!</p>

    <p>If a quarter of his new one million viewers became Light Chasers, Daoist Guang would have accomplished his live stream goal for today.</p>

    <p>At that moment, the five-minute window for the first blue circle had passed and the map started to shrink. There were eighty-three people left on it.</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang was lucky that he didn't need to run from the blue circle, but he was still some distance away from the central safe zone. If he didn't start moving now, the next time the circle shrunk, his character would definitely be caught outside it.</p>

    <p>Moreover, he had already set a goal of twenty kills or more. If he wanted to accomplish this, he had to start his massacre now. It was easy to imagine how hard it was going to be to get rid of a quarter of the remaining eighty-three people with a katana.</p>

    <p>Thus, after officially deciding to make his move, he closed the bet.</p>

    <p>The odds were one to two hundred...</p>

    <p>Over two million people had taken part in the event.</p>

    <p>And most of them had selected <em>No </em>.</p>

    <p>Of course, these were also some bold gamblers.</p>

    <p>Two hundred-fold odds...</p>

    <p>This was too tempting!</p>

    <p>"I don't care, I don't care, this Light Chaser supports Lord Island! Ten thousand immortal elixirs! All in! I'm betting on Lord Island's victory!"</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang naturally saw this bullet message.</p>

    <p>He straightaway replied to it in a composed manner, "Indeed, I may have to improve my shooting skills, but this old man's sword skills won't let you down! Since I opened a bet, I have absolute confidence in myself! Everyone, please have your eyes wide open for the rest of the live stream. If you want to record it, feel free to do so. When the time comes after I've killed twenty people or more, don't say that I cheated. If you can detect any cheats, then you can consider it my loss!"</p>

    <p>It was as if Daoist Guang had dropped a bomb in the live stream room.</p>

    <p>This was being too confident!</p>

    <p>At this time, a multi-colored bullet message sticky appeared in front of everyone's eyes.</p>

    <p>It was from Daoist Guang's number one fan, [Has Three Days And Two Sleeps Been Updated].</p>

    <p>It read: <em>The katana is the latest in melee weapons and currently the one with the longest reach. It's also very lethal! However, the drop rate for this weapon on the map is very low and not a lot of live streamers are able to pick it up! Everyone settle down and watch Lord Island in action! Is there anyone present who has ever seen him use a katana in his live stream before?</em></p>

    <p>When this message appeared, everyone was instantly stumped.</p>
