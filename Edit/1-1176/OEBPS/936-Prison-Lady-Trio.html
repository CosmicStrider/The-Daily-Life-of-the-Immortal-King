  <h1>Chapter 936 Prison Lady Trio</h1>

  <div>

    <p>What awaited Huang Youliang next wasn't a three-party joint hearing in the prison, but the Old Devil's domestic discipline.</p>

    <p>Now that the Mahjong Squad were part of the atonement group, their final sentencings were also postponed.</p>

    <p>The Old Devil, the Master of Immortal Mansion Cheng Yu, and Evil Sword God had now all been in prison for some time, and it felt like home.</p>

    <p>The people there were all talented and interesting when they spoke...</p>

    <p>Their daily tasks comprised of looking after the prison crops and helping General Bai secretly deal with some wanted criminals. All these could gain them merit points, and at their final trials, their sentences could be commuted based on how many merit points they had.</p>

    <p>There was a saying that getting a job or working for others was impossible <sup>1</sup> , but the crimes of these three people were too heavy, and it was very likely that they would spend the rest of their lives in prison atoning for their sins.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A meme based on the words of
an arrested thief who refused
to get a job.)</dfn>

    <p>However, the Old Devil was a happy-go-lucky person with a strong ability to mentally adjust to his situation. The prison took care of his food and drink; he felt it would be fine for him to live here all his life. All he wanted was for General Yi to fulfill his promise and use the wheel of time to find his girlfriend's reincarnation.</p>

    <p>That would still take time.</p>

    <p>When it came to bureaucracy, everyone knew - getting a seal was just like the sloth in <em>Zootopia </em>.</p>

    <p>The process right up to obtaining approval would thus take a very long time. Even the Old Devil himself needed to be patient; it couldn't be rushed.</p>

    <p>On the whole, life in Songhai First Prison was quite comfortable.</p>

    <p>They rose at dawn to till the soil and rested at dusk.</p>

    <p>Even with their meridians blocked, they could still get assignments from General Bai once in a while to deal with fierce offenders.</p>

    <p>They had just carried out a mission a few days ago.</p>

    <p>The target had been a rainy night rapist who wore an open red raincoat that exposed his hairy legs, and who liked to act on rainy days. This person was extremely fast and acted under the cover of the weather. A lot of girls had fallen victim, and before they could react, they had fallen pregnant...</p>

    <p>When the Mahjong Squad found the rainy night rapist, the trio surrounded him.</p>

    <p>"You... Aren't all of you already..." Caught, the pervert was stupefied, as he had never expected this situation at all.</p>

    <p>But that was a few days ago...</p>

    <p>The Old Devil and the others had seen a lot of this type of trash in their contact with dark forces, and catching them was just dirtying their hands.</p>

    <p>But they had no other choice; the road to redemption was a long and difficult one.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On this day, inside the special call, the Old Devil and Cheng Yu were researching makeup techniques. Evil Sword God was a weakling when he went out on a mission without eyeshadow, so they had to improve their skills.</p>

    <p>And Warden Liang had approved their application.</p>

    <p>Warden Liang gave them a sack with all kinds of cosmetics inside.</p>

    <p>"So many?" Untying the sack, the Old Devil stared blankly.</p>

    <p>"They were all seized at the airport; I asked one of my colleagues there for them," Warden Liang replied mildly.</p>

    <p>Prisoners were also human beings, and naturally also needed to pass the time with something fun. In addition to "Fight the Landlord" and mahjong, the Old Devil and the others were also developing other things for their self-amusement, and a prison lady trio <sup>2</sup> act was quietly unfolding.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>("Games Lady Trio" is the
Chinese title for the Japanese
manga "Asobi Asobase," which
is about three girls who make
up the members of an
unofficial school Pastimers
Club.)</dfn>

    <p>But the Mahjong Squad was made up of three men, and they were putting on makeup for the first time...</p>

    <p>"How do we use these?" Cheng Yu asked.</p>

    <p>Old Devil picked out a few cosmetics. He had never worn makeup, but relying on what he remembered of his girlfriend's makeup bag before, he could still vaguely tell the difference between lipstick, BB cream, eye cream and whatnot.</p>

    <p>As he was picking out the things, it suddenly occurred to him that of the three people in the Mahjong Squad, he appeared to be the only one to have had a girlfriend before...</p>

    <p>"Give it a try first. This is lipstick. Apply it on him first."</p>

    <p>"Aren't we going to practice putting on eyeshadow?"</p>

    <p>"In any case, it's just for fun. Just put on whatever."</p>

    <p>After figuring things out, the two people started to mess around with Evil Sword God's face.</p>

    <p>Without his eyeshadow, Evil Sword God let them do whatever they wanted to him, like a daughter-in-law being bullied.</p>

    <p>A few minutes later, Evil Sword God officially took center stage wearing lipstick, a wig, eyeshadow and blush.</p>

    <p>"I think it's not bad," Cheng Yu commented.</p>

    <p>"Mm, he looks very similar to Jynx <sup>3</sup> like this." The Old Devil nodded.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(A "Human Shape" Pokemon..)</dfn>

    <p>But very quickly, the two of them frowned when they realized that this eyeshadow didn't have any effect - Evil Sword God didn't switch personalities from the makeup they put on him.</p>

    <p>"Did we put it on wrong?" Cheng Yu had a bit of a headache.</p>

    <p>"The first step is always the hardest. Let's take it little by little."</p>

    <p>The Old Devil pinched Evil Sword God's face. "Old Evil is pretty cute like this, don't you think?"</p>

    <p>"Em..." Cheng Yu stared at Evil Sword God's face more closely.</p>

    <p>"Old Cheng, just admit it. Don't you like Old Evil? I can hear your heartbeat." A sly smile played on Old Devil's lips.</p>

    <p>"Heartbeat???" The Master of Immortal Mansion was a little bewildered.</p>

    <p>It was true that a strong heartbeat was resounding in the air, but it definitely wasn't his.</p>

    <p>Whose heartbeat was this?</p>

    <p>While they were feeling puzzled, the door to the special cell opened and the prison guard who had been escorting Huang Youliang directly kicked him inside.</p>

    <p>"Oh, it's another newbie!" The Old Devil was overjoyed, but when he saw the man's face, his own instantly darkened.</p>

    <p>When Huang Youliang saw the Old Devil and the others at that moment, he was so frightened that his legs buckled and he could barely stand, and he shrank back. "You... Stay away from me!"</p>

    <p>The Old Devil...</p>

    <p>The Master of Immortal Mansion... and Evil Sword God!</p>

    <p>Huang Youliang was sure he was right!</p>

    <p>What frightened him even more was that these three people were actually in one cell...</p>

    <p>Huang Youliang's heart raced and he was so nervous he almost choked.</p>

    <p>He was now bitterly regretting the reckless comments he had posted online.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, there was no medicine for regret in this world...</p>

    <p>"It's you, isn't it... You called my venerable self a toy poodle in heat?"</p>

    <p>The Old Devil's light voice carried in the air. It wasn't loud, but it carried the greatest sense of terror.</p>

    <p>However, before the interrogation was over, Huang Youliang had already fainted, foaming at the mouth.</p>

    <p>Cheng Yu: "Do we need to wake him up?"</p>

    <p>Old Devil waved his hand. "It's fine. They are quite a few people who've been sent over for us to play with today: They all made inappropriate online comments, and can be called keyboard warriors or a water army."</p>

    <p>As soon as he said the words, it seemed more people had been sent over outside the door...</p>

    <p>These were all the keyboard warriors Jingke had caught after following the online trails; they were now all lined up outside the special cell in handcuffs.</p>

    <p>Cheng Yu was shocked at this momentum. "So many people?"</p>

    <p>These people were all crying noisily and shaking with fear.</p>

    <p>There were already twenty-six of them, and the number was still increasing.</p>

    <p>This was the first time the prison was so lively.</p>

    <p>It was just that the number was a little too large... In less than fifteen minutes, there was already a long line outside the door of the special cell as the number of people soared to more than a hundred...</p>

    <p>Cheng Yu was deeply shocked. "So this is an Internet water army..."</p>

    <p>With a snort, the Old Devil opened the cell door and stepped outside. All the keyboard warriors knelt one after another and begged for mercy. "We have reflected deeply, and we will all listen to the Governor!"</p>
