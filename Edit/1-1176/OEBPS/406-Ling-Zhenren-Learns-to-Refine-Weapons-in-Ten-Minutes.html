  <h1>Chapter 406 Ling Zhenren Learns to Refine Weapons in Ten Minutes! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>When Lord Diulei followed Er Ha upstairs, he happened to see Father Wang come out of the study yawning as he walked toward the washroom; he guessed that Father Wang had probably stayed up all night again to write.</p>

    <p>He was startled when he saw Father Wang's two eyes... Considering how high Senior Wang's realm was, for him to consume such massive amounts of energy to write this novel, it probably contained some sort of amazing philosophy!</p>

    <p>Every online novelist had a fan club which attracted diehard fans. Last time, Lord Diulei had seen how the number of Father Wang's club members had dominated all others to climb to the top of the list with more than thirteen million fans, while the author in second place only had two million fans.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei had specially read <em>The Live Streaming Life of the Immortal King </em>and bought a wave of gifts for the sake of finding something in common with Father Wang.</p>

    <p>To be honest, Lord Diulei felt that this novel was well-written, and given the current mainstream trend, was commercially profitable! But there was something that he still hadn't figured out, and that was Father Wang's purpose in writing this novel.</p>

    <p>Given his high cultivation realm, was he just writing this novel to make money?</p>

    <p>There had to be some secret hidden in it that Father Wang wanted people to know!</p>

    <p>It looked like he needed to investigate further...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei watched Father Wang enter the washroom as he pondered in his heart - he would definitely discover the secret in this novel! Perhaps it contained Senior Wang's cultivation secret!</p>

    <p>Standing at the door to Wang Ling's room, the corners of Er Ha's eyes twitched when it noticed that the young man in white was slow to enter as he stared at Father Wang's back.</p>

    <p>It knew that Lord Diulei's imagination was most likely starting to run wild again.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had already been waiting for quite a while inside the room.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei had thought about the Immortal's Treasure House the whole night, and naturally so had Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Given that cultivators all over the world had been doing all they could to look for clues to this Treasure House, but with nothing to show for it, this Taoist Guang might be the only person with inside information, and no one else except Wang Ling, Er Ha and Lord Diulei knew of his existence.</p>

    <p>This would be world-shaking news to any cultivator, and the young man in white was deeply aware that Wang Ling had been willing to tell him about this out of trust.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, I've brought the thing." Entering the room, Lord Diulei made himself at home and directly sat down cross-legged on the floor.</p>

    <p>Then, he took out a red and black multifaceted crystal.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had specially asked him to bring this thing here; it was called a magnetic stone. Back when they had caused havoc at Immortal Mansion, Lord Diulei had plundered and taken a lot of uncommon materials, and this magnetic stone was one of them. It was far more valuable than the primordial black crystal that had been incorporated into the stone ghost mask back then, and was classified as an extremely rare type one material of the highest grade.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling did have some knowledge about refining weapons; their grades could be divided into four types and five levels.</p>

    <p>As a type one, first-class weapon, a magnetic stone was priceless.</p>

    <p>But Lord Diulei still didn't know what Wang Ling wanted it for.</p>

    <p>"That Senior Taoist Guang is currently sealed inside a soul space now, and I'm connected to it," said Er Ha.</p>

    <p>Putting this together with what Er Ha had said previously, Lord Diulei suddenly understood a little better. "No wonder Brother Er Ha said that that senior was in your dream. It appears that once you start to dream, your soul will enter the space."</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, Lord Diulei was a little amazed; this was clearly a great technique that only a great senior would possess. This was enough to prove that this Taoist Guang's level wasn't low; he had to be a peak Itinerant Immortal at the very, very least, with strength that was very close to the Ascension stage.</p>

    <p>"Since this Taoist Guang is inside a soul space, this confirms that his real form is actually that of a soul. His strength is probably weaker in this state, right? What realm is he at now?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha felt there was nothing to hide. "True Immortal."</p>

    <p>Despite his circumstances, he was still a True Immortal...</p>

    <p>"This Taoist Guang is pretty powerful..." Lord Diulei judged almost immediately. True Immortals were truly rare; apart from General Yi, the people they'd run into during recent major events, like the Master of Immortal Mansion, were just Itinerant Immortals.</p>

    <p>"You're not nervous?" Er Ha suddenly asked as it stared at the young man in white.</p>

    <p>"Why should I be nervous..." Lord Diulei was speechless. "In this villa, aren't Senior Wang and Old Senior Wang True Immortals?"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Er Ha almost sniggered...</p>

    <p>As expected, this fanciful misunderstanding still persisted until now!</p>

    <p>Looking at Lord Diulei's ability to make things up, Er Ha felt it would be pretty difficult to clarify this misunderstanding.</p>

    <p>It had to be mentioned that it was because of Lord Diulei's wild imagination that broccoli had become extremely pricey on the market. Er Ha had even seen on the news previously that the City Bureau of Quality Supervision was looking for the culprit behind this price inflation... when Er Ha had seen this news, it had almost spat out the houseflies it had eaten that night.</p>

    <p>"By the way, what on earth does Brother Ling want to do with the magnetic stone?" Lord Diulei couldn't help asking as he saw Wang Ling rub the magnetic stone between his fingers while he flipped through reference books at his study table.</p>

    <p>"Do you still need to ask? Magnetic stones are a rare source material and there is none other more suitable for refining a ring. That senior is currently still trapped in the soul space, so we have to move Taoist Guang's soul space into the ring!" Er Ha replied.</p>

    <p>The corners of Lord Diulei's lips twitched. "..." After going around in circles, they still had to use a ring!</p>

    <p>As expected, did the old man and the ring come as a pair?</p>
    
    <p>Then when it rained... would the old man and the ring be even more of a match<sup>1</sup> ?</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is a random adaptation of a line used in a Dove Chocolate ad ..)</dfn>

    <p>"That... what is Brother Ling looking at now?" Lord Diulei covered his mouth and asked in a whisper.</p>

    <p>He was sitting cross-legged behind Wang Ling. After Wang Ling had taken the magnetic stone from him, he had turned around to look through his reference books, and Lord Diulei didn't dare disturb him.</p>

    <p>"Learning how to refine weapons," Er Ha said nonchalantly. "How can he create a ring without learning to refine weapons?"</p>

    <p>When Er Ha said this, it hit Lord Diulei that Luo Chuang didn't know about Taoist Guang, so they couldn't ask him to refine the ring even though he was a weaponsmith.</p>

    <p>For now, this was still a highly confidential matter.</p>

    <p>"So Brother Ling is learning to refine weapons..." Lord Diulei nodded his head.</p>

    <p>But very quickly, he had a stunned expression on his face as he couldn't help turning to Er Ha. "Wait! Learning to refine weapons? Are you saying that Brother Ling hasn't learned this before?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "No, he hasn't, which is why he's teaching himself now."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Anyway, refining weapons isn't hard."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>As it spoke, Er Ha pointed at the pile of books on the table. "Little Master has read and grasped the knowledge in all these books."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei brought the books over and looked through them carefully. Every level of refining weapons was covered, from <em>A Guide to Refining Weapons </em>and <em>Refining Weapons for Beginners </em>to <em>Bronze Weaponsmiths </em>, <em>Silver Weaponsmiths </em>, <em>Gold Weaponsmiths </em>, and the last one, <em>King of Weaponsmiths </em>...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Did Brother Ling read all these last night?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha shook its head: "No! Ten minutes ago!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei broke out in a sweat. Wang Ling had learned to refine weapons up to the level of a king in ten minutes... If Luo Chuang found out, who knew how long he would curse for.</p>
