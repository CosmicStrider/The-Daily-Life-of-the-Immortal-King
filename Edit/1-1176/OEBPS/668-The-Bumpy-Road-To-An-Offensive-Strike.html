  <h1>Chapter 668 The Bumpy Road To An Offensive Strike</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The other party was a mere Soul Formation cultivator, yet Elder Poisonous Dragon was actually helpless against him? Looking at Lord Diulei's "you can't do anything to me" expression, Elder Poisonous Dragon was enraged. He had used practically all of the upgraded Poisonous Dragon Drill forms, but the other party continued to be resurrected on the spot.</p>

    <p>How did he do it? Elder Poisonous Dragon couldn't figure it out at all.</p>

    <p>All this was within Lord Diulei's expectations.</p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon was indeed a powerful enemy. If he had met this enemy before, who only liked to strike without saying much, Lord Diulei felt that he would have died long ago. But the situation was now different as he had a world-defying resurrection magic treasure which Elder Poisonous Dragon couldn't smash apart with his strength.</p>

    <p>Given how tough the world-defying magic treasure was, it wouldn't be the least bit damaged by any attack under True Immortal level.</p>

    <p>When he knew that one of the persons he would be dealing with this time was "Great Death-Courting Senior" who was only at the Soul Formation stage, Elder Poisonous Dragon hadn't thought much of him at the beginning. But reality was crueler than Elder Poisonous Dragon had imagined... The truth was, it was Lord Diulei who didn't think much of Elder Poisonous Dragon.</p>

    <p>From the moment he received Zhuo Yi's phone warning, Lord Diulei had known that even if it was someone dispatched by the Demon Hunters Association, there was no way that they could destroy his ring!</p>

    <p>Ignoring the panting Elder Poisonous Dragon in front of him, Lord Diulei took out a small notebook and started to record down each of Elder Poisonous Dragon's earlier attacks as he put together a concrete summary of the Soul Suppression Ring's performance test. This type of opportunity to test its performance wasn't something he could come by all the time. Furthermore, he could add the data he had obtained from this test to the cultivation forum's "Skill Encyclopedia."</p>

    <p>Many cultivation spells were listed in the <em>Skill Encyclopedia </em>. The categories they were sorted into were very detailed; each skill's level of power damage had even been specially evaluated.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei wrote in his little notebook:</p>

    <p><em>Lightning Poisonous Dragon Drill's second form, a small-scale and long-range attack spell combo. Presents as a single-handed attack; during the attack, one hand turns into a soft metallic screw which pierces the body. As powerful as a large cannon, and very lethal! 7.5 points...</em></p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon: "..."</p>

    <p>In the middle of writing, Lord Diulei suddenly turned to look at Elder Poisonous Dragon. "Oh, that's right, Brother Poisonous Dragon... What was that second move you used just now called? Auldey what drill?"</p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon's lips twitched before he replied in a deep voice, "Auldey... Double Drill..."</p>

    <p>But! The problem was! This wasn't the main point!</p>

    <p>How had he become Brother Poisonous Dragon?</p>

    <p><em>Who's your brother?!</em></p>

    <p>But Lord Diulei didn't pay any attention to Elder Poisonous Dragon's black face at all as he earnestly took all kinds of notes in front of him. As the owner of the cultivation forum, it was his responsibility as an online administrator to enrich the forum's resources in a timely manner!</p>

    <p>At that point, Elder Poisonous Dragon's mindset collapsed.</p>

    <p>To be honest, he kind of regretted taking this job.</p>

    <p>Although he had long heard that this Great Death-Courting Senior was a veritable freak, he truly hadn't expected him to be one of a kind...</p>

    <p>He was a terrible and vicious man, hey! A man who wanted the other party's life! But the other party was actually completely ignoring him and earnestly taking notes!</p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon: "What are you doing?"</p>

    <p>"Collecting data to update the forum's database..." Lord Diulei answered truthfully before he looked at Elder Poisonous Dragon in front of him with a broad smile on his face. "Thank you very much, Brother Poisonous Dragon, for the invaluable data you've provided for the cultivation forum's <em>Skill Encyclopedia </em>."</p>

    <p>"Are you ignoring me? Are you serious? I'm here to kill you!"</p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon couldn't take it anymore. The next moment, powerful spirit energy burst out from his body.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was dazed before he hurriedly put away his little notebook. "I do know!"</p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "But can you kill me? You're here on a mission anyway, so why don't you start with the guy upstairs?"</p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon grit his teeth. "..." He was already one hundred percent sure that this "Lord Diulei" in front of him was abnormal, extremely abnormal! Besides, he was actually feeling a sliver of fear for some reason... he was even starting to have doubts about this Great Death-Courting Senior's true realm!</p>

    <p>This Great Death-Courting Senior was rumored to be a Soul Formation cultivator, but Elder Poisonous Dragon now thought that it was very likely that the other man had hidden his realm.</p>

    <p>One had to know, he was just too calm if he really was just a Soul Formation cultivator!</p>

    <p>The number of True Immortals in Huaxiu nation could be counted on the fingers, while there were less than one hundred Itinerant Immortals. Returning elite cultivators from overseas like them, who had also undergone the Demon Hunters Association's specialized training, stood out among the Itinerant Immortals... But in a confrontation with them, this Great Death-Courting Senior actually wasn't the least bit nervous, which was enough to prove that this person definitely dealt often with cultivators at higher levels, which was why he could ignore their auras and the oppression they brought with them.</p>

    <p>Thinking this, Elder Poisonous Dragon couldn't help breaking slightly into a cold sweat.</p>

    <p>Could a person with no capabilities hang around often with True Immortal bigwigs?</p>

    <p>... There was something wrong with this Great Death-Courting Senior!</p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon was suddenly disinclined to attack.</p>

    <p>He turned his gaze to the second floor and then looked at Lord Diulei. "Stay there and don't move; I'll let you off for now... But I have to kill the person on the second floor today!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei nodded and smiled. "Go ahead..."</p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon was furious, but in the end, he only took one step up the stairs when a snow-white foot hit him in the face and immediately sent him flying!</p>

    <p>The first floor was so noisy just now that it made Xiao Yin very fidgety. It was only after he sent out his awareness that he realized that there was an intruder!</p>

    <p>He was in the middle of writing!</p>

    <p>His creative thought process had been interrupted by the noise from the first floor, causing a ball of fury to form in Xiao Yin's heart. "Who are you?! Can you please be quiet?! Don't you know I'm writing a book?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin grabbed his silver hair, feeling a little agitated.</p>

    <p>He had come upstairs just now overflowing with ideas, but everything was now a mess in his head!</p>

    <p>When he went downstairs, he happened to see someone he didn't recognize about to come rushing up, so Xiao Yin directly gave him a flying kick...</p>

    <p>It was a very fierce kick. Although it was just a normal attack by Xiao Yin, Elder Poisonous Dragon was kicked directly into the wall.</p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon was instantly enraged at being kicked in the face. "You're courting death!"</p>

    <p>He used his Lightning Poisonous Dragon Drill again. Taking this silver-haired young man's strong recovery ability into account, Elder Poisonous Dragon didn't hold back this time as he put everything he had purely into hitting Xiao Yin's chest!</p>

    <p>" <em>Aiya </em>! No good!"</p>

    <p>"Afraid now? You're dead meat!"</p>

    <p>Seeing that Elder Poisonous Dragon was serious, Xiao Yin wanted to dodge that sharp tip, but it was too late. Elder Poisonous Dragon's move connected as it directly hit Xiao Yin's body!</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, however, Xiao Yin's body was far more resilient than Elder Poisonous Dragon thought, and it was actually just a scratch in the end.</p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon withdrew his hand, a shocked look on his face. "How can this be?"</p>

    <p>When he came back to his senses, he saw this young man with a collar around his neck staring longingly at him.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "So... so good..."</p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon: "???"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "Hit me again..."</p>
