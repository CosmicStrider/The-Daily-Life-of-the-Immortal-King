  <h1>Chapter 926 I Don't Need to Lift a Finger at All</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Divine Dao Star's Star Lord was pressed firmly down on the throne. His face turned red as he felt the greatest humiliation. No one had dared to act so outrageously against him like this ever since he took control of Divine Dao Star, but now, a high school student born on Earth, a planet which he had always viewed as inferior, was actually pressing him down on the throne, and he was unable to move at all.</p>

    <p>He was infuriated, but helpless.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Ling suddenly heard a voice which was actually coming from the throne under Star Lord.</p>

    <p>Although Star Lord had been pressed down on the throne, unable to budge, the throne slowly turned around so that the back was facing Wang Ling, and an impassive face appeared on it. "I miscalculated; I never thought that there would still be someone like you on Earth... no, in the universe."</p>

    <p>The moment the throne opened its mouth, the fluctuations of godly power all around them actually settled down completely.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling gazed at the throne. Previously, he had felt that it was of an unusual origin, but he never expected it to actually have its own consciousness. Moreover, it felt completely different to an artifact spirit.</p>

    <p>What was this?</p>

    <p>God?</p>

    <p>Or did it have some other name?</p>

    <p>The universe was so big, and there were too many things that Wang Ling didn't know.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling didn't care what on earth the throne was.</p>

    <p>Whether it was a god or devil -</p>

    <p>Since it was causing him trouble, he would just eliminate it.</p>

    <p>"You aren't an ordinary person. With such formidable power, even if you come to our divine realm, you would be a Venerated God, and one in a million. But you won't live past today. Blame me for indulging Shen Tian... He only has one Divine Dao, so he isn't your match." The face on the back of the throne opened its mouth, and the real horror was how it spoke without the slightest trace of emotion.</p>

    <p>The Shen Tian it had mentioned was Star Lord's name.</p>

    <p>"Then what the hell are you? An artifact spirit?" At that moment, Bai Qiao opened her mouth again before anyone else.</p>

    <p>The face on the throne smiled and golden light blossomed around it like petals, just like a god on high.</p>

    <p>"God am I, and I am God... You puny Earth cultivators have never touched the divine realm, so naturally you do not know what a god is. The most ridiculous thing is that you even have a place called the Domain of the Gods..." The throne sneered. "It has no true god or divine law, yet enjoys a godly name - it will definitely suffer backlash."</p>

    <p>The throne spoke lightly and with assurance and composure; it thought nothing of Wang Ling and Bai Qiao at all.</p>

    <p>"The true divine realm is on the border of the universe, and is a place which you can never reach. If you had not wilfully founded the Domain of the Gods and pretended to be deities, you wouldn't be subjected to this divine punishment." Speaking eloquently, the throne pointed out the crux of the contradiction, and all of its criticism was aimed at the "Domain of the Gods," which initially was the place to which cultivators who had achieved Dao ascended.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't know how to define a god.</p>

    <p>He had never seen a real one.</p>

    <p>Everything was relative.</p>

    <p>To ordinary people, Soul Formation cultivators could perhaps already be considered gods.</p>

    <p>To Soul Formation cultivators, the god in their hearts might be True Immortal cultivators.</p>

    <p>And True Immortal cultivators yearned for the Venerated Immortal level and the "Domain of the Gods"...</p>

    <p>Since ancient times, cultivators had never let up on pursuing realms.</p>

    <p>To sum it up in simple terms, whoever was stronger was god.</p>

    <p>It seemed that Star Lord had been silenced by the throne, which was when Wang Ling realized that Star Lord was in fact a puppet, and the real enemy was actually the throne under Star Lord.</p>

    <p>"Will you kill yourself, or are you waiting for me to make a move?" When the throne opened its mouth, its words swept out, as if they rang out from the center of the universe.</p>

    <p>It deliberately attacked Wang Ling with this godly pressure, and while Wang Ling did indeed feel it, it wasn't enough to send him to his knees.</p>

    <p>"Making a move, is too troublesome." Wang Ling gazed at the throne and spoke telepathically.</p>

    <p>"What do you mean?" The throne was impatient.</p>

    <p>The gems on the armrest exploded with a beam of light as thick as a thigh that shot forward and rocked the entire golden palace with the fierce sound of thunder.</p>

    <p>In the next moment, however, this divine light was split in two.</p>

    <p>"What is that?" The face on the back of the throne frowned.</p>

    <p>Staring fixedly ahead, it saw that the youngster was now holding a peach wood sword.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had already said the line "sword, come" so many times before, and was now a little tired.</p>

    <p>It was his summer break, but he was being hit by troublesome things one after another... this divine realm had to be fixed.</p>

    <p>He didn't care about the throne's origins.</p>

    <p>Apart from Mother Juan's dishes and Chen Chao's mouth, there was nothing else in this world that could make Wang Ling's heart tremble. Even the godly pressure released by this throne from the true divine realm didn't intimidate him in the least.</p>

    <p>The throne no longer made a move as it sensed something strange in the youngster's calm posture...</p>

    <p>The face on the back of the throne was very grim and its eyes were fixed on the youngster in front of it.</p>

    <p>The youngster slowly walked to a golden divine pillar in the palace and sat down next to it. Casually propping up one arm on his knee, he leaned back against the pillar and sighed softly.</p>

    <p>"This sitting posture..." At that moment, the throne turned pale with fright.</p>

    <p>It unexpectedly saw a familiar figure in this sitting posture.</p>

    <p>Impossible...</p>

    <p>That man was already no more!</p>

    <p>The expression on the face on the back of the throne kept changing. It used its Divine Eye which could see through everything to gaze at the youngster, but it saw nothing in the youngster's past life or future at all.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling smiled.</p>

    <p>He knew the throne was looking at him.</p>

    <p>However, even he himself couldn't see his past or future clearly, to say nothing of this lousy chair.</p>

    <p>"Time to end this." Wang Ling turned his eyes to the throne, which was already no longer as arrogant as before.</p>

    <p>A sense of danger gripped the throne's heart.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling lightly tossed his peach wood sword into the air, and it released dense godly power!</p>

    <p>"The power of Divine Dao..." The throne wore an indecipherable expression. "You passed the power of Divine Dao to your sword spirit?"</p>

    <p>"No."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling shook his head, his clear and cold voice echoing in the air. "It's just a supplementary lesson."</p>

    <p>The throne: "A supplementary lesson???"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "If I can learn it, so can my sword spirit, naturally."</p>

    <p>In fact, it was during the handful of seconds when Wang Ling summoned Jingke to cut the divine light in half and he sat down that Jingke had completed his supplementary lesson.</p>

    <p>And the reason why Wang Ling had tossed Jingke up into the air was because he wanted Jingke to resonate with Bai Qiao.</p>

    <p>When the blade and scabbard were close, their memories would become one! And the power of Divine Dao would become two!</p>

    <p>"So, there's no need for me to lift a finger at all." Wang Ling stared at the throne, his expression as unruffled as an ancient well.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Bai Qiao, who had realized Wang Ling's intention, had already taken the form of a scabbard for the first time.</p>

    <p>In contrast, Jingke was slightly hesitant in the air... He had never been inside a scabbard before. For a moment, he was actually shy, and his sword body was suffused with red...</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao was a little impatient. "Don't talk rubbish! Hurry up and come in!"</p>
