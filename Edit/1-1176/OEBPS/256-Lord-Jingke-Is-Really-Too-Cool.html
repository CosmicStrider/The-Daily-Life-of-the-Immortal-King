  <h1>Chapter 256 Lord Jingke Is Really Too Cool! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Hundreds of millions of people in Huaxiu nation were paying close attention to the live broadcast of the old devil's trial. Luo Chuang was one of them. His metalware store was from that old generation; even its cabinets were made of wood.</p>

    <p>He wasn't in the habit of reading the news, nor did he binge watch TV. He got all his news from the mouths of customers as well as brothers and sisters who came to him to get their magic weapons serviced.</p>

    <p>That morning, Luo Chuang was unprecedentedly interested in the old devil's trial. He didn't have a TV in his shop, and could only use a mirror-like magic treasure to simulate TV reception.</p>

    <p>So when someone entered the shop that morning, they saw a fatty with hair combed into a poop style <sup>1</sup> and wearing a white undershirt looking into a mirror. But this fatty wasn't admiring himself — he was sincerely concerned about state affairs.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Everyone probably knows the
poop emoji that is shaped like
a soft-serve ice cream ..)</dfn>

    <p>"Yo, morning."</p>

    <p>At that moment, a man in white suddenly stepped across the threshold and greeted him.</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang looked up, and when he saw the visitor, he was a little surprised. "Why are you here so early?"</p>

    <p>"I still have something to do in the afternoon, so I thought I would pick up the sword in advance. You promised to help me give the Seven Stars Sword a full service if I lent it to you for five days to study it. Don't tell me you forgot?" Lord Diulei leaned back and supported himself against a cabinet with a smile.</p>

    <p>"Of course not, I gave it a full service. It didn't take too long, and it didn't cost too much." Luo Chuang waved his hand and his gaze turned to the cabinet on the right. "It's in number twenty-four on the right, you can get it yourself."</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang was so matter-of-fact that Lord Diulei couldn't quite believe it. He remembered that Luo Chuang's attitude hadn't been like this when he'd first asked for the Seven Stars Sword; he'd almost fallen to his knees to hold on to Lord Diulei's thigh...</p>

    <p>"I'd heard of Immortal Zhenyuan's fame before, so I'd always had high expectations of the Seven Stars Sword. But when I got it from you, the novelty wore off after just a couple of hours."</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang put down the mirror in his hand, slowly raised his head, and said seriously, "The Seven Stars Sword's strength to move things is no small matter, and it is indeed very formidable. However, there's also a huge drawback, and that is it asks a lot of its wielder. It consumes almost four times the amount of spirit energy compared with a spirit sword at the same level."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "What's your point?"</p>

    <p>"So, even though the Seven Stars Sword ranks high in the swords list, it's also true that this sword isn't practical, and it isn't suitable for everyone. It's only suitable for cultivators who have innate spirit energy and abundant basic energy reserves, and who can develop at extraordinary speeds — in other words, the so-called sons of heaven." Luo Chuang shrugged. "If you want me to rank it, the Seven Stars Sword wouldn't even make the top ten."</p>

    <p>"??? " After hearing this, Lord Diulei's expression was full of bewilderment, since this wasn't what Luo Chuang had said a few days ago!</p>

    <p>"Didn't you say that this Seven Stars Sword was an exquisitely crafted and flawless godly sword? That was just a few days ago..." Lord Diulei was speechless.</p>

    <p>"That was then, this is now." Luo Chuang pressed his lips together. "I have seen so many spirit swords, what sword haven't I viewed before? But it was only recently, when I saw Ling Zhenren's Jingke, that I realized that I was just a frog in a well..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Surely you're exaggerating?"</p>

    <p>"You don't understand."</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang tsked. "From tip to end, Lord Jingke is impeccable. The only pity is that he doesn't have a scabbard. Nowadays, there are truly very few swords like Lord Jingke, which are able to save on as well as consume less energy, which are very formidable and pleasing to the eye, and which uphold the three views."</p>

    <p>When Luo Chuang spoke up to this point, Lord Diulei saw his eyes light up.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang looked at the mirror, which was still playing the live broadcast of the old devil's trial. There was a deep expression in his eyes. "Look at this; no matter who you are, even if you have a hollow reputation for having once rocked the world... in the end, don't you just become outdated, just like the Seven Stars Sword? So, only a common spirit sword like Lord Jingke, which is not on the swords ranking list, is the genuinely supreme godly sword."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Of course, it's not like I'm targeting your Seven Stars Sword. Ever since I saw Lord Jingke, I've come to realize..." Luo Chuang squinted and smiled. "All other existing spirit swords are trash!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei could already completely tell that this Luo Chuang had become a fanboy!</p>

    <p>"By the way, has there been any progress in relation to the place that I asked you to look into?"</p>

    <p>Speaking on this topic, Luo Chuang suddenly lifted his head to look at Lord Diulei as he recalled proper business. Previously, he had asked Lord Diulei to look for a secret location called Devil Valley, which was rumored to be a secret place with a history far older than the Gate Between Worlds and which only opened once every century.</p>

    <p>While the name Devil Valley made it sound like an awful place, according to historical records, it had the kind of picturesque landscape where any photos you took could be used as a screensaver.</p>

    <p>And, most crucially, it was rumored that Devil Valley contained rare materials that according to history no longer existed.</p>

    <p>"I asked Little Black before, and he has already detected some fluctuations that might be from Devil Valley. Calculating the years, it indeed looks like the valley will open again this year." Lord Diulei flattened his lips. "But I still want to know, why do you want to go there?"</p>

    <p>"I want to make something. If I succeed, it'll be my entire life's glory," Luo Chuang said proudly with a face full of smiles.</p>

    <p>"You want to make a sword?"</p>

    <p>"That was my previous goal; before, I wanted to create a spirit sword that would be able to easily destroy all the armor in my shop. However, since seeing Lord Jingke, I feel that this isn't something that can be achieved in this life." Luo Chuang sighed with a little regret, and then he looked up with hope in his eyes. "So instead, I'm going to make the ultimate scabbard for Lord Jingke."</p>

    <p>"Is this your most recent reason for wanting to go into Devil Valley?" Lord Diulei raised his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>"That's right." Luo Chuang smiled and said, "My original plan was to look for the special supplemental material, the One Thousand Dried Bone, in Devil Valley."</p>

    <p>"One Thousand Dried Bone? That would be very rare, even in the valley." Lord Diulei sighed.</p>

    <p>The One Thousand Dried Bone which Luo Chuang was talking about was a supplemental substance in ancient times which could be added as an ingredient to elixirs for restoring vitality, but which had been used back then to stabilize the forging of holy weapons. Unfortunately, because of its extremely long growth cycle, plus excessive harvesting at the time, it had already gone extinct a long time ago.</p>

    <p>Even if it really did exist in Devil Valley, there actually wouldn't be a lot of it.</p>

    <p>It was clear that Luo Chuang was well aware of this.</p>

    <p>"I know that even if Devil Valley does have the One Thousand Dried Bone, there won't be much of it. If I were to use it to forge a godly sword, this amount wouldn't be enough. However... if I use this material to build the ultimate scabbard, it'll definitely be enough!" Saying this, Luo Chuang smiled maniacally.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei instantly panicked when he saw this fanatical smile.</p>
