  <h1>Chapter 456 A Frog Cannot Defeat a Pheasant </h1>

  <div>

    <p>There were only sixty-seven people left, but Daoist Guang had to kill another eighteen before his mission could be considered complete; he would only be able to catch up by making full use of the time to slaughter the others in a mad wave.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling couldn't take his eyes off the scene in the live stream. No one else knew Daoist Guang's true realm; only he did!</p>

    <p>Watching a True Immortal game... was truly a mystical experience.</p>

    <p>Perhaps Daoist Guang using spells to help him in the game might be quite disgraceful!</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling felt that this couldn't be considered cheating; after all, people relied on their own abilities to learn spells... Daoist Guang had spent many years cultivating step by step to get to this stage. Even to temper a mere auxiliary spell like the "Focus Spell" to the fullest like Daoist Guang had would require a hundred years of painstaking cultivation day and night.</p>

    <p>What was more, the whole nation was involved in cultivation in this era. Who knew if other live streamers also used spells to help them game.</p>

    <p>When it came to cheats, there had been a lot of instances recently where people had created videos with frame-by-frame evidence of live streamers who had cheated.</p>

    <p>Because of this, live streaming platforms had thus added their own cheat detection mechanism. If live streamers were detected to be cheating during the live stream, they would be permanently banned from the platform. Of course, the platform would award proficient live streamers who didn't cheat with green live stream tags.</p>

    <p>Whatever the case, most people felt that using cheat software was a despicable thing to do.</p>

    <p>The uploaders who released evidence videos would play back scenes of the live streamers' performance in the game frame by frame in order to capture unusual and quick camera shifts.</p>

    <p>Most of the live streamers who cheated used the "aimbot" cheat. Once the camera started running, super-targeting would have already been deployed <sup>1</sup> ! The gun's muzzle would automatically lock onto a body part like the "thigh" or "neck."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is a reference to an incident where a live stream gamer claimed he wasn't using cheats, but the game suddenly announced that "super-targeting had been deployed," thus exposing him as a liar)</dfn>

    <p>When a lot of people appeared in a scene at the same time, a particular situation would often occur with the cheating live streamer: when shooting at a person, the muzzle of their gun would suddenly move to accurately aim at another enemy.</p>

    <p>This might not be obvious during the live stream.</p>

    <p>But after a slow playback and frame extraction, people would always be able to find something wrong!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had seen some of these evidence videos, such as from the famous evidence uploader "A Frog Cannot Defeat a Pheasant."</p>

    <p>It had to be said that in the beginning, these videos had indeed been uploaded in the spirit of justice.</p>

    <p>Later, however, these so-called "evidence videos" began to gradually deteriorate, and were reduced to becoming commercial tools used by live streaming platforms.</p>

    <p>Paying someone a bit of money to make a video slamming a big live streamer on some other platform drew on the anti-cheat movement and could easily turn the tide in a platform's favor.</p>

    <p>So after that, some so-called evidence videos would come up with laughable "one second one frame" evidence.</p>

    <p>Looking for and obtaining a hammer <sup>2</sup> was a thing, but it was a big problem if you weren't professional about it!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is a literal translation of the online catchphrase 求锤得锤, which refers to a phenomenon, usually in the entertainment industry, of someone spreading news and only releasing evidence to support it after calls are made for them to do so.)</dfn>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After killing the second person, replenishing his health and obtaining a frying pan, Daoist Guang simply directly got onto the former player's motorbike at the gas station and sped toward the city.</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang was playing the so-called "Fish Pond Round <sup>3</sup> " level. Apart from live streamers shooting the breeze and the cheaters, the passersby at this level all had pretty much the same skill in marksmanship.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(A literal translation of 鱼塘局, which refers to a game level where most of the players are new and it's comparatively easy to win ..)</dfn>

    <p>It was very hard to shoot at someone riding a fast motorbike!</p>

    <p>The rumble of the moving motorbike was also bound to attract a lot of attention in the city.</p>

    <p>That was exactly what Daoist Guang wanted!</p>

    <p>This was a shortcut when you had to kill a certain number of opponents but couldn't find enough people.</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang's idea was that it would be best if someone shot at him first. He would then figure out his opponent's position based on the sound and the bullet's trajectory, and then retaliate.</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang was just thinking this when a sharp and clear gunshot rang out!</p>

    <p>Because of how noisy his live streaming environment was, Daoist Guang already had the game on at full volume, so the sound of the sniper rifle was very clear!</p>

    <p>Many viewers heard it in the live stream room.</p>

    <p>"There's a sniper! Lord Island, be careful!"</p>

    <p>"Sounds like a SKS? And it's the kind where you don't have to take a breath in between shots?"</p>

    <p>"It's over! Lord Island is dead! Game over!"</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang found a house in the corner of the city he could use as cover and stopped the motorbike. When the sniper had shot at him, Daoist Guang had already tracked the sound back to lock onto his position.</p>

    <p>On screen, Daoist Guang's character could be seen hiding behind a wall, half of his profile slightly exposed and his gaze fixed on a tower not far away.</p>

    <p>In the live stream room, many sharp-eyed viewers followed Daoist Guang's line of sight and saw a small black dot on top of the tower.</p>

    <p>Instantly there were cries of surprise in the bullet messages.</p>

    <p>"Fuck! How did he see that?!"</p>

    <p>"Lord Island is awesome! He was able to instantly determine the trajectory even when riding the motorbike!"</p>

    <p>"Ah? Where? Why can't I see it?"</p>

    <p>"The message in front, are you blind?! There was a muzzle flash just now from the person on top of the tower!"</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang didn't have time to pay attention to these bullet messages. He was observing the person on top of the tower... If he wanted to perform a massacre in this city, this sniper was a huge hidden threat, so the sooner Daoist Guang got rid of him, the better.</p>

    <p>The man's position wasn't far from him.</p>

    <p>The main issue was that while Daoist Guang had noticed this person, he himself had clearly also been discovered.</p>

    <p>Given the short distance between them, and after determining the enemy's general position, opening his <em>x </em>scope to look for the other party was too easy.</p>

    <p>The best proof of this was when Daoist Guang, who was in a blind spot, deliberately exposed half of his body, and with a "pew" the man shot at him again.</p>

    <p>But it hit the wall of the house in front of Daoist Guang instead of hitting him, leaving behind a clear bullet hole.</p>

    <p>Seeing this, Wang Ling couldn't help being derisive.</p>

    <p>This was a Fish Pond Round!</p>

    <p>This aim was too askew!</p>

    <p>The other party was simply a body outline-tracing master...</p>

    <p>Almost on par with Jiang Bai!</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang couldn't help sighing in his heart as well; this little brother's marksmanship was terrible!</p>

    <p>But that was exactly what he wanted.</p>

    <p>"Dare shoot me?"</p>

    <p>Stuck behind the wall, Daoist Guang smiled calmly in his heart. Directly switching from the katana in his hand to the frying pan, he quickly headed straight for the tower.</p>

    <p>This scene stunned everyone in the live stream room.</p>

    <p>Even the person in the tower was stunned.</p>

    <p>He had just made three shots; it was impossible for the man not to know that there was a sniper in the direction he was heading in now.</p>

    <p>Also, according to the regular way of thinking, even if the other person wanted to get close enough to kill him, they would normally look for a suitable position and go around for a better chance of success.</p>

    <p>Who would directly charge forward with a frying pan when they clearly knew that there was a sniper in front of them?</p>

    <p>The player in the tower with the ID "GAYLIGAYQI" was stupefied.</p>

    <p>Then he quickly came to his senses and lay down in the best position to aim at Daoist Guang through the rifle lens before pulling the trigger. "Sorry, brother, I'll accept your express delivery!"</p>

    <p><em>Peng </em>!</p>

    <p>One shot!</p>

    <p>Mm...</p>

    <p>This time, it was a hit!</p>

    <p>However, this player wasn't happy at all!</p>

    <p>Because this shot had precisely hit the frying pan!</p>

    <p>False positive?</p>

    <p>Because everything had happened in an instant, it hadn't been very clear, and he had only roughly seen a spark on the frying pan in Daoist Guang's hand.</p>

    <p>It couldn't have been that coincidental, right?</p>

    <p>He happened to hit the pan?</p>

    <p>In the tower, the player took a deep breath...</p>

    <p><em>Peng </em>!</p>

    <p>Another shot!</p>

    <p>This time, the player paid particular attention.</p>

    <p>Hm...</p>

    <p>Very good...</p>

    <p>He had hit the pan again!</p>

    <p>Or, to be more precise...</p>

    <p>This man charging in his direction had raised the frying pan in his hand to block the bullet.</p>

    <p>"???"</p>

    <p>As question marks flooded the screen in the live stream, this player called "GAYLIGAYQI" instantly felt that he was in trouble!</p>
