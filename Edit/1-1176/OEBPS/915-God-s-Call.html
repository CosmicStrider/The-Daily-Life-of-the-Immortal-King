  <h1>Chapter 915 God's Call</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The moment the pod door closed, something unexpected happened. There were different remote controls for closing the pod doors and starting the machines, but the virtual game machines activated on their own before Su Xing could press the start button!</p>

    <p>Su Xing frowned and subconsciously felt that something didn't seem right as he immediately took out both remotes and pressed the off buttons.</p>

    <p>But none of them responded!</p>

    <p>Was there something wrong with the machines?</p>

    <p>Su Xing yelled at the people outside, "Pull the plug!"</p>

    <p>All of a sudden, all the lights in the Internet cafe went out.</p>

    <p>Some confused customers climbed out of the pods to ask about the situation.</p>

    <p>"Why did the power go out? I'm only halfway through my novel!"</p>

    <p>"Wow! You're so cool, brother, coming to an Internet cafe to read a novel, and even doing it in a game pod... " Another customer next to him was taken aback.</p>

    <p>"Yes! <em>The Only Koi in the Cultivation World </em>is so good! Also, the author is very handsome, and didn't ask for monthly votes during the Chinese New Year!"</p>

    <p>"Is there an author nowadays who doesn't ask for monthly votes?"</p>

    <p>"I guess it's because his updates are so slow that he doesn't feel right asking! Anyway, brother, what were you doing just now?"</p>

    <p>"I was reading the chicken soup by that famous chicken soup master Teacher Mimi Mengmeng. Just as my soul was going to be healed, the power went out! Damn it!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Right now, the electricity had been turned off.</p>

    <p>But the five machines that Wang Ling and the others were in were still running.</p>

    <p>There was a problem!</p>

    <p>Su Xing broke out in a cold sweat, but he had no idea who the enemy was.</p>

    <p>"Should I destroy them?"</p>

    <p>Su Xing gazed at the five machines in front of him.</p>

    <p>Shortly after that, he grit his teeth and struck the game pod with one palm!</p>

    <p>He couldn't worry so much now; the most important thing was to save lives first!</p>

    <p>He hit the pod door of the virtual pod precisely with a bang!</p>

    <p>But the instant his palm made contact, Su Xing'e expression turned alarmed - an invisible barrier actually covered the door!</p>

    <p>"When was this set up?" Su Xing's face twisted.</p>

    <p>These game pods had only been brought in this morning, Furthermore, they had been tested to ensure that there was nothing with them, and had been here this whole time until Ling Zhenren brought his classmates.</p>

    <p>No one had entered the room before this, and Su Xing had been watching outside the whole time, and hadn't noticed anyone suspicious.</p>

    <p>He never thought that someone would have already tampered with these game pods.</p>

    <p>However, before Su Xing could figure out the person responsible for this, a strong wave of spirit power pushed out from where Su Xing had hit the barrier.</p>

    <p>"Damage rebound?" Su Xing grit his teeth and struck this wave with his palm again to try and neutralize this force.</p>

    <p>Su Xing's palm technique contained Heavenly Dao, which wasn't weak!</p>

    <p>However, when his palm collided with this spirit power rebound, Su Xing fell back and spit out a mouthful of blood.</p>

    <p>The strength in the rebound had actually doubled.</p>

    <p>Su Xing propped himself up with one knee on the ground. His sternum was already fractured and even the wall of the room had collapsed.</p>

    <p>In an instant, the Internet cafe had inexplicably become a mess.</p>

    <p>"What on earth is going on..." Su Xing struggled painfully to his feet.</p>

    <p>He suddenly thought of someone - Miss Bai Qiao!</p>

    <p>The game pod in her office had also been delivered that morning!</p>

    <p>Logically speaking, with the power out at that moment, Miss Bai Qiao should have already long flown into a rage and jumped out of the pod cursing!</p>

    <p>But now he didn't see any sign of her.</p>

    <p>Had she gotten caught up in the trouble too?</p>

    <p>Su Xing hurriedly informed Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>But just as the call went through, a space rift unexpectedly appeared behind him.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei and a beautiful person of indeterminate gender walked out of the rift, but the aura on this person didn't belong to a human; it was heavy demon qi.</p>

    <p>It was none other than Shen Wuyue, who was still in the form of his second personality, Shen Eryue.</p>

    <p>"We were still too late." Lord Diulei frowned.</p>

    <p>Seeing the injured Su Xing, Shen Eryue helped him up and uncovered the plaster on his head where one of the antlers had broken off.</p>

    <p>Su Xing was amazed when, with a "biu," blood spurted out of the break in an arc.</p>

    <p>Taking out the ever-ready disposable plastic cup he was carrying on him, Shen Eryue skillfully collected a cup of blood, then restuck the plaster back on.</p>

    <p>Su Xing: "..."</p>

    <p>Giving the cup of blood to Su Xing, he said in a voice as delicate at the autumn moon, "You're badly hurt. Drink this cup of blood if you don't want any residual effects."</p>

    <p>This was someone whom Lord Diulei had brought over, and it was obvious that they had anticipated this event.</p>

    <p>Although there was demon qi on this strange person, Su Xing didn't think too much of it before draining the cup of blood.</p>

    <p>The kydeer's blood had a powerful recovery ability, and was several times more effective than Xiao Yin's blood.</p>

    <p>After drinking the cup, Su Xing was pleasantly surprised when all the pain in his body was completely swept away and his broken bones knitted back together; even his complexion improved.</p>

    <p>"Let me introduce you: this is the Sage Master who accompanies the demon world's Demon Saint, Lord Shen Wuyue." Seeing that Su Xing had recovered, Lord Diulei made the introductions.</p>

    <p>The Sage Master of the demon world...</p>

    <p>Su Xing's lips twitched.</p>

    <p>He felt that he had underestimated the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>They actually had connections with the backbone of the demon world...</p>

    <p>Struggling to rein in his shock, Su Xing asked, "Senior Immortal, what on earth is going on..."</p>

    <p>"Earlier, the Holy Palace in the demon world detected fluctuations beyond the Domain of the Gods, and captured a Three-Headed Phoenix which had come from there." Lord Diulei replied, "This extinct Three-Headed Phoenix was reared beyond the Domain of the Gods and had a puppet string on it. It launched an attack on the Holy Palace. Finally, Lord Shen Wuyue subdued and captured it."</p>

    <p>"Beyond the Domain of the Gods..." Su Xing felt his worldview refreshed once more.</p>

    <p>The events of the last two days had continued to refresh Su Xing's knowledge of the cultivation world.</p>

    <p>He had previously regarded the levels of the Ten Generals as the mark of top big shots in the cultivation world... but now, he realized that he was just a frog in the well.</p>

    <p>As they spoke, Shen Eryue examined the barrier on the game pods, and he frowned deeply.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "How is it?"</p>

    <p>Shen Eryue: "This barrier is a force I've never seen before... It's beyond my capability, but what's certain is that it's neither Heavenly Dao nor Outer Dao - it should be a power above the two. Senior Immortal should be able to feel it too, right? You also have the power of Heavenly Dao."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei's expression was heavy as he nodded. "Indeed, this isn't Heavenly Dao."</p>

    <p>"Our opponent's realm is on a higher level." Shen Eryue sighed.</p>

    <p>"So... we can't do anything to help?"</p>

    <p>"We can only believe in His Excellency Ling's strength. In addition, we could perhaps ask Mr Wang Zhen and the others for help - since they're from the Domain of the Gods, they might know something about this power," said Shen Eryue. "Also..."</p>
