  <h1>Chapter 1167 Gao Tianming's Fall From Grace</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Shadow Dao was a two-edged Great Dao with a critical flaw that was very easy for evil people to exploit. However, Wang Ling felt that this flaw could be fixed. After all, Ah Nuan had yet to be born. She was probably the most powerful embryo in the world, or even the universe, right now, but she still had limited control over Shadow Dao. As long as Ah Nuan grew up and got rid of the aspect of Shadow Dao which triggered "evil," it would still be a Dao that would benefit all of mankind.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling couldn't say for sure if Wang Nuan would cause all sorts of havoc after birth like he had due to lack of control over her power. What he could be sure of, however, was that Father and Mother Wang's instructions for him hadn't changed: As her big brother who had experienced the pain of losing control before, what he could do was help lead Ah Nuan on the right path.</p>

    <p>"Relying on burning talismans to climb to the top? Number 60 High really has a lot of talent..." Everyone in the command center looked at the scene in front of them. They had already noticed movement on the top of Mist Peak. Gao Tianming had devoured Wang Zhen in a blind corner, so the scene hadn't been recorded. Until now, no one in the command center knew that Gao Tianming had already fallen into a demonic state.</p>

    <p>Thus, when Wang Ling appeared on the summit in an attempt to rescue Wang Zhen, the headmasters in the command center just treated it as a normal Foundation Establishment duel. However, as Wang Ling's head disciple, Zhuo Yi instantly understood what Wang Ling was going to do.</p>

    <p>He was all too familiar with Wang Ling's personality.</p>

    <p>He wouldn't appear on the front line so easily to take action.</p>

    <p>If he had chosen to make a move, he must have run into some problem.</p>

    <p>As for burning talismans as he climbed to the top, it was very likely just a cover.</p>

    <p>Even if he wasn't with Wang Ling, nor even the commander in chief of the operation this time, Zhuo Yi thoroughly understood that his job was to divert other people's attention from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He promptly gestured to the staff member on the side, who was controlling the display, to cut away from the scene.</p>

    <p>To prevent this very situation, Zhuo Yi and Lord Diulei had plotted early on to take over this staff position, and this person was in fact someone who had been dispatched by the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Seeing the image on the large screen cut away, Zhuo Yi sighed with relief inwardly.</p>

    <p>But he tensed up once again at Old Huang's next words. "Why did you cut away? I remember the list said that Gao Tianming is the strongest of Number 1 Demon-Subduing High's new students, and also the team captain this time. His opponent is Number 60 High's mascot Student Wang Ling. Their fight should be worth watching."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>Given Old Huang's status and identity as the <em>shifu </em>of one of the Ten Founding Generals, President Qi, it was impossible for Zhuo Yi not to know how much respect the former enjoyed in the cultivation world. The way Old Huang said it, Zhuo Yi immediately knew that he had to switch back to the scene.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, Zhuo Yi had a plan B.</p>

    <p>This was the second plan he had prepared for Wang Ling's sake, in the event that Zhuo Yi was asked to switch back to the scene.</p>

    <p>It was just that the scene that he would switch back to wasn't the true scene of the battle.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At that moment, in a dark studio in Songhai city, Dharmaraja and Luo Chuang, this pair of slightly plump buffoons, were already fully prepared. They had already been on standby when the scene first cut away. In any case, they were Soul Formation experts; it wasn't difficult for them to emulate a duel between two Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p>

    <p>This dark studio had a live projection effect, and could project an image of Mist Peak's entire landscape that was so realistic that one could hardly tell that it was fake.</p>

    <p>What Dharmaraja and Luo Chuang were going to do was use the Transformation Spell to turn into Gao Tianming and Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>After that, they would use the props which they had prepared beforehand to give a live performance.</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang had produced these props earlier on.</p>

    <p>After some investigation, Lord Diulei had gotten a complete list of magic treasures that students from the various schools might smuggle into the competition, and Number 1 Demon-Subduing High's puppet was on the list.</p>

    <p>Now, it was a fight between Wang Ling and Gao Tianming. Luo Chuang immediately transformed into Gao Tianming and changed into the clothes he had prepared earlier before he took out a puppet prop which he had made himself - his "Luo Chuang Hardware" had been open for a long time and had received all kinds of odd custom orders for magic treasures; naturally, they had included puppets like this.</p>

    <p>Thus, it wasn't hard for Luo Chuang to make puppets.</p>

    <p>"Luo Chuang, isn't your puppet a little too detailed..."</p>

    <p>When Boss Luio took out the puppet he designed, Dharmaraja was taken aback.</p>

    <p>Rather than a puppet, Dharmaraja felt it might as well just be called an action figurine. It was painted all over, and its figure even conformed to the golden ratio. The most important was that it was even wearing clothes, and it was so detailed that even its finger joints could move freely.</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang: "Dharmaraja, you don't understand. Puppets also need to look good. In any case, I'm still a magic treasure designer; I just can't take the crude and ugly puppets that Gao Tianming, this Foundation Establishment junior, uses."</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja: "I understand, but the question is... why does your puppet look like Lord Jingke?"</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang: "What a pointless question! Only Lord Jingke deserves my serious treatment! Be careful when you fight me later, and don't break my figurine... no, my puppet! In any case, this is just for show, and we just need to go through the motions!"</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja: "Then do you have another puppet? Change it with another one!"</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang: "I do! Don't regret it after I've changed it!"</p>

    <p>"..." Dharmaraja suddenly had a bad feeling.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At that moment, Zhuo Yi sent a signal from the command center.</p>

    <p>The scene would be switched back soon.</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja and Luo Chuang prepared themselves and immediately entered "Oscar movie king" mode.</p>

    <p>There was no doubt that this was a contest for best acting.</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja, starring as "Wang Ling," starred expressionlessly at Luo Chuang, who was starring as "Gao Tianming." Dharmaraja didn't speak because he knew Ling Zhenren had always been a person of few words, and he would easily give himself away if he talked too much.</p>

    <p>As for Gao Tianming...</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang didn't know him very well, and could only rely on himself for this act.</p>

    <p>And so, when Old Man Wang and all the headmasters in the command center saw the scene in the studio -</p>

    <p>Everyone was struck dumb by the puppet behind Luo Chuang.</p>

    <p>"We only cut away for a moment; how did Student Gao's puppet change so much?" Old Huang was puzzled. He remembered that Gao Tianming's puppet was a little more crude and scary-looking.</p>

    <p>"Youngsters - it's certainly very normal to have one or two detailed puppets." President Qi laughed on the side. "But I didn't expect there to be such a huge difference in Student Gao Tianming's style. Perhaps he's a shut-in."</p>

    <p>"A shut-in?"</p>

    <p>Old Huang frowned as he shot a glance at the headmaster of Number 1 Demon-Subduing High, Li Qingxi. "Headmaster Li, I didn't expect the students of your esteemed school to have this side to them. A puppet master's puppet can actually reflect their personality."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>As headmaster, Li Qingxi was also stupefied as he stared at the sexy female puppet behind Luo Chuang on the screen.</p>

    <p>He remembered that his student Gao Tianming didn't have this sort of style!</p>

    <p>What on earth happened in that moment when the scene cut away?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>This was the puppet that Luo Chuang had switched to one second before the scene switched back. It was made with replica skin, and was known as: Adult Puppet...</p>

    <p>And it was stark naked, with not a stitch of clothing on it...</p>

    <p>Hence, everyone in the command center now knew that Gao Tianming from Number 1 Demon Subduing High had a dirty mind...</p>
