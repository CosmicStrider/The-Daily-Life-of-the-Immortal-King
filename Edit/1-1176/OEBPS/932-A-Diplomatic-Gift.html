  <h1>Chapter 932 A Diplomatic Gift</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Chen Chao and the others were wild with excitement after receiving the game pods.</p>

    <p>"The Office of Strategic Deception really gave us such a great gift this time!" In the Grade One, Class Three squad chat group, Chen Chao shared pictures of the game pod from various angles.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing sent a grinning emoji. "Not posting them in WeChat Moments?"</p>

    <p>"Senior Zhuo Yi already called to tell us to keep it under wraps. Getting this gift is more than enough; there's no need to share it on WeChat." Chen Chao said off-handedly, "But it's a bit of a pity; somehow, I feel like I've forgotten something about the virtual game we played yesterday."</p>

    <p>Right after he said that, Guo Hao and Su Xiao also agreed.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "Chao? You feel like you forgot something, too? How strange... I feel the same."</p>

    <p>Su Xiao tensed up. "Don't tell me it's a side effect?"</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, it can't be a side effect."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing reassured them. "The virtual game pods you experienced are the latest model, and the game you played is the newest one. The game pod was designed to be connected to the brain, but in order not to overload yours, forgetting is in fact a normal phenomenon after coming out of the pod. Furthermore, the game you experienced yesterday was a restricted beta version which is still a secret."</p>

    <p>This speech was something Fang Xing and everyone at the Office of Strategic Deception had settled on after some discussion.</p>

    <p>Actually, the memories of the Number 60 High School squad had been tampered with after the game.</p>

    <p>Divine Dao Star was going to establish diplomatic relations with Earth right away, and Guo Ping, a distant uncle of Guo Hao's who did research, would become their space ambassador.</p>

    <p>If Chen Chao and the others still remembered the incident with Guo Ping... The whole thing would be blown open.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was September 2nd, the twentieth day of the summer vacation.</p>

    <p>Guo Ping, who had disappeared in outer space on a mission, returned to Earth, shocking the entire world.</p>

    <p>But most importantly, Guo Ping brought back a gift from Divine Dao Star this time: it was something which Star Lord of Divine Dao Star called a "cosmic gem." Now, it had become an important symbol of the establishment of diplomatic relations between mankind and Divine Dao Star.</p>

    <p>Guo Ping and the head of state together attended a meeting held in the United Nations summit conference room. True Immortal head of states from every country were gathered together; it was an imposing and powerful atmosphere to astonish anyone.</p>

    <p>The conference was made public this time, and the whole world followed the meeting proceedings closely. This was the first time mankind was establishing diplomatic relations with an alien civilization, and it seemed everyone was being very cautious.</p>

    <p>The heads of all the countries were similarly worried about expansion by alien civilizations.</p>

    <p>They were basically the type to be vigilant in times of peace. This was a group of very suspicious people, so Guo Ping naturally couldn't give a truthful account. Otherwise, there would be one or two leaders at this summit who would definitely start to deploy measures to defend against an alien invasion... If this led to a misunderstanding, that would be a real issue.</p>

    <p>When you hung out with your friends, you would never carry a fruit knife on you to guard against them, would you?</p>

    <p>That would be an act of mistrust...</p>

    <p>All these heads of state were overly suspicious people. Guo Ping knew the importance of his report this time. He wanted to put an end to these leaders' paranoia.</p>

    <p>After all, with Miss Bai Qiao and Student Wang Ling this good luck charm around, Divine Dao Star would no longer act presumptuously toward Earth anymore.</p>

    <p>"Professor Guo, will you please give your report on Divine Dao Star first," said Oligei, Mixiu nation's dark-skinned head of state.</p>

    <p>Behind him stood his personal bodyguard â€” it was none other than the hero cultivator Silky Web Heroine of the Mixiu Alliance of Cultivators.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya had met Silky Web Heroine once before, and had been utterly amazed at how she spurted spider silk from her butt in the battle with Devil Gut Fungus Lord.</p>

    <p>Silky Web Heroine initially wasn't going to be at this conference because of her abnormal spider silk ejection (also known as abnormal leukorrhea). However, considering this was the first time that mankind was establishing diplomatic ties with an alien civilization, Silky Web Heroine had spent a lot of money to get Immortal Toya to make medicine for her.</p>

    <p>Ever since the battle with Devil Gut Fungus Lord, the Office of Strategic Deception's international sect standing had also improved markedly; as leader of the medicine team, Immortal Toya's reputation had also been boosted.</p>

    <p>Now, the Office of Strategic Deception's medicine team was receiving more and more orders from abroad.</p>

    <p>Mixiu nation was still the world leader in cultivation science and technology; when the country's dark-skinned leader spoke, the atmosphere in the meeting room instantly sobered.</p>

    <p>Guo Ping sorted out his thoughts. He cleared his throat and delivered the statement he had prepared beforehand. "Hello, leaders. I am a researcher with Huaxiu's Cultivation and Magic Treasure Research Institute. My name is Guo Ping. Six years ago, I was sent on a mission. However, I was accidentally sucked into a black hole. When I finally fell out, it happened to be on Divine Dao Star, billions of light years away..."</p>

    <p>Guo Ping had specially altered this part. He didn't mention the energy string, which was Wang Ling's hair, that had acted as a power source... Otherwise, that would definitely cause a sensation.</p>

    <p>Of course, Guo Ping himself didn't know that this so-called energy string was Wang Ling's hair...</p>

    <p>This was something "developed" by Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>This energy string had even enabled Wang Ming to obtain a year-end bonus from the research institute.</p>

    <p>"Divine Dao Star is much further away than we thought. With the assistance of Star Lord of Divine Dao Star, they helped me upgrade my spaceship and used existing black hole technology to help me return to Earth.</p>

    <p>"I believe everyone has also seen their diplomatic gift. This is a cosmic gem which can generate energy infinitely; we can use existing equipment to extract the energy from the cosmic gem for the continuation of spirit qi on Earth.</p>

    <p>"Not only that, the cosmic gem can also circulate and purify spirit qi. As long as it isn't damaged, it will be a never-ending source of spirit qi for the Earth.</p>

    <p>"In short, the civilization on Divine Dao Star has developed in more or less the same way as Earth. It is a vast and abundant planet with many unique resources. It is the first planet to establish friendly ties with Earth, and I feel that we Earthlings should also come up with a matching list of gifts in return."</p>

    <p>After Guo Ping said this, the various country leaders whispered to each other.</p>

    <p>In terms of sincerity, this gift of a "cosmic gem" from Divine Dao Star was really of great significance, and it had to be said that it would solve Earth's most pressing situation at present...</p>

    <p>Several thousand years down the line, the spirit qi on Earth would be completely used up and cultivators would no longer exist.</p>

    <p>This replenishing cosmic gem was the same as giving all the cultivators in the world new hope.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Huaxiu's head of state said, "How about this: after this meeting, each country will offer up a gift. What do you think?"</p>

    <p>Feixiu's head of state raised his hand weakly. "Can... can we give them golden soil <sup>1</sup> ?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A literal translation of Jinkela,
the brand name of a fertilizer
addictive whose over-the-top
ad was turned into a meme ..)</dfn>

    <p>Guo Ping: "Your Excellency Head of State of Feixiu, please think it over carefully... Divine Dao Star's agriculture is very advanced; they don't need golden soil."</p>
