  <h1>Chapter 532 Xiao Yin's Takeout Delivery </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Xiao Yin didn't believe a word Er Ha said; his first reaction was that this Er Ha had to be lying - making money at Master's level was too easy. How could he possibly be poor!</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin in fact had mistakenly assumed this whole time that a modern cultivator's income level was based on their realm: the higher their realm, the higher their income. Thunder, for example, had yet to reach Itinerant Immortal level, but was already flush with cash and didn't blink at spending several million a month! How could Master lose out to him!</p>

    <p>Seeing the suspicion written all over Xiao Yin's face, the corner of Er Ha's eye couldn't help twitching; it had known that this guy wouldn't believe it.</p>

    <p>Actually, Little Master Ling was pretty miserly and frugal; he wasn't extravagant and he meticulously calculated his spending down to the penny. All of this was due to the values and views on spending which Father Wang and Mother Wang had instilled in him at a young age.</p>

    <p>Boys should be raised to be thrifty; this was how Father Wang and Mother Wang educated Wang Ling when it came to money. Although Father Wang's revenue was high, he still only gave Wang Ling a fixed amount of pocket money each month so that Wang Ling would understand that making money wasn't easy. This was something most people wouldn't comprehend until they started working themselves.</p>

    <p>This was particularly true of people like Wang Ling's peers; most of them might not come from money like Sun Rong's family, but at least they didn't have to worry about food or clothing nowadays, and until they got internships in university, they didn't have to worry about getting a job or making money. For most kids, these concerns seemed too far away, but time would fly by very quickly.</p>

    <p>As parents, Father Wang and Mother Wang were unable to help Wang Ling control his primordial qi, but at least they had spared no effort in helping him establish his values as he matured.</p>

    <p>It was very easy for a person to start thinking differently after obtaining absolute power. Father Wang wrote books and had seen plenty of these types of stories, while Mother Wang who had been a writer before was also very good at thinking up scenarios. The couple had previously wondered what would happen if Wang Ling turned into a chuuni devil...</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling had been young, they had even dreamed several times of Wang Ling floating in the air as he roared at the swarm of human cultivators below him: Ants! Why should I, Wang Ling, explain myself to you?!</p>

    <p>Mother Wang had shared this story with Er Ha when she had taken it out on a walk and stopped to get groceries on the way.</p>

    <p>Every time Er Ha thought about this, it couldn't help the way the green fur all over its body shook.</p>

    <p>But there was no way it would expose its Little Master Ling's shortcoming in front of Xiao Yin.</p>

    <p>There was a very important condition attached to the spirit beast contract: no matter the situation, they should never tear their owners down! There were some things you might discern, but which you shouldn't talk about - Er Ha was very clear on this point.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin might not believe it now, but it was just a matter of time.</p>

    <p>Heaving an inward sigh, Er Ha used its swallowing spell to regurgitate the spirit beast contract which little master had given to it to pass to Xiao Yin.</p>

    <p>"Wow! Master wants to sign the contract with me!" The moment Xiao Yin saw it, he fairly jumped to his feet in excitement!</p>

    <p>He picked Er Ha off the floor and hugged it, rubbing its head wildly and yelling, "You dog bapi! I never thought you'd be so reliable this time!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha squinted and said helplessly, "Go easy... I've been shedding pretty badly recently. If you rub anymore, I'll go bald!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "It's fine, it's fine! If you go bald, we can learn from Lord Island's livestream and form our own team and call ourselves Deyinse<sup>1</sup>."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is adapted from Deyunshe or 'Deyun Club,' which is a Chinese comedy performance group. The 'yinse' used here means 'silver color.')</dfn>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin loosened his grip and put Er Ha down. "By the way, how do I sign the contract?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha shook as it immediately realized that this was Xiao Yin's first time signing a contract and he thus didn't know the process... In fact, it had also been Er Ha's first time - it used to be a true blue demon king, after all! When would it ever have signed a spirit beast contract with a human before? Naturally, the same was true for Xiao Yin; as a holy beast, and very likely the only one left in the world today, he had an even more prestigious identity.</p>

    <p>But there were some things you never forgot after doing it once.</p>

    <p>Er Ha spoke on the side. "There are two copies of the contract, a thumbprint in blood is fine."</p>

    <p>"Oh! That's easy!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin straightaway bit his thumb open and deftly marked both copies.</p>

    <p>The contract took effect immediately. Both copies turned into gold particles that then dispersed in front of Xiao Yin. When he came back to his senses, the contents of the contract had already appeared in his head.</p>

    <p>Each word was vivid in his mind and like a brand on his soul.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin had signed the contract so fast that Er Ha was dumbstruck. "You put down your thumbprint just like that? Without looking at the contents of the agreement?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin waved his hand. "What's there to look at in a Big Thigh Contract?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Big... Big Thigh Contract?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin looked at Er Ha in surprise. "Didn't you sign the contract in order to hug a thigh<sup>2</sup>?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(A reminder that this means to curry favor with someone more powerful ..)</dfn>

    <p>Er Ha was silent: "..." It couldn't deny it!</p>

    <p>After signing the contract, Xiao Yin closed his eyes and felt the link to Master take shape in the depths of his soul, as if they were bound together by an invisible thread.</p>

    <p>In the eight thousand years that he had been alive, not a single day had gone by that Xiao Yin hadn't felt dread after the extinction of the holy beasts. This contract, however, gave him a sense of fulfilment and safety.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin tsked. "The contract feels very mystical! Even if Master isn't with me, it feels like I'm sleeping next to him!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>This was the first time Er Ha had heard such a description... but though it sounded crude, it did actually make sense!</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "From now on, when you find yourself in a dangerous situation you can't handle, you can directly use the power of the contrat to call for Little Master Ling, understand?"</p>

    <p>"Of course I do! The moment the contract was formed, I knew everything!" Hands on his waist, Xiao Yin laughed gleefully. "Hahaha... I don't have anything to be afraid of now no matter how reckless I am."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "You better behave yourself..."</p>

    <p>After all, it wasn't like every Death-Courting Senior was called Lord Diulei...</p>

    <p>After Er Ha and Xiao Yin talked for a bit in the basement, Lord Diulei's voice drifted down from the first floor. "Brother Dog? Why not stay for lunch?"</p>

    <p>"Alright," replied Er Ha.</p>

    <p>No prize for guessing what they would be eating...</p>

    <p>First of all, lunch was bound to be Lord Diulei's favorite food, broccoli, and secondly, Xiao Yin would be getting takeout.</p>

    <p>As expected, Lord Diulei quickly replied, "I have broccoli I just harvested. If Brother Dog doesn't like it, Brother Xiao Yin can share his takeout with you. We don't have dog food here, I hope you don't mind."</p>

    <p>"It's fine, it's fine, Senior Immortal, you're too polite," said Er Ha.</p>

    <p>After that, it turned to Xiao Yin. "What do you normally order to eat?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin spread his hands and answered as if it was a matter of course, "Just from the shops nearby. I did a round of orders, the food actually tastes pretty good."</p>

    <p>Roughly half an hour later, a truck drove into Wenxian Garden villa estate.</p>

    <p>This entire truck...</p>

    <p>...Was loaded with Xiao Yin's takeout!.</p>
