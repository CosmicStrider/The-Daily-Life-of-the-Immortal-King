  <h1>Chapter 404 What Fur </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Thus, close to midnight today, Lord Diulei specially went to the police station to bail Xiao Yin out. Song Qingshu, who had been serving as Lord Diulei's housekeeper after leaving Mo Immortal Castle, stopped the black car that he was driving outside the entrance. Actually, Song Qingshu knew more about the police station than Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>When he had been with Mo Immortal Castle, Song Qingshu's role as leader was to act as a liaison in his field of networks. Since Xiao Yin had just been detained, it would normally be completely impossible to bail him out at this time. However, Song Qingshu had taken care of it with his connections.</p>

    <p>He might have already left Mo Immortal Castle, but over the years, he had planted a lot of spies in local agencies all over Songhai city; even Mo Immortal Castle was unaware of their existence.</p>

    <p>Most importantly, these people were completely trustworthy because Song Qingshu had supported and helped all of them during their most difficult times; he had even saved some of them.</p>

    <p>Hence, he wasn't a bad person fundamentally, otherwise it would have been impossible for Lord Diulei to let this person remain by his side to work.</p>

    <p>When Lord Diulei brought Xiao Yin out, it had just gone midnight. The rear car door opened, and Xiao Yin directly dove headfirst into the car like a paralyzed geyou.<sup>1</sup></p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A reminder that Ge You is an actor who starred in a TV comedy sitcom called 'I Loved My Family.' A screencap of a scene where he's slouching down on a sofa low enough that he's almost lying flat became a Chinese online viral meme.)</dfn>

    <p>Today... was so damn tiring!</p>

    <p>First was the inhuman exchange of four thousand milliliters of holy beast blood for twenty crispy noodle snack packets, and then he had become the target of people from the Demon Hunters Association on his way home, which was immediately followed by him being sent to the police station to give his statement... Why had so many things happened in just one day?</p>

    <p>Lying on the back seat, Xiao Yin couldn't figure it out no matter how he puzzled over the matter.</p>

    <p>Then he realized a very serious problem.</p>

    <p>It was fine if he didn't go out, but when he did, he suffered disaster! And if it wasn't the hospital he ended up in, it was the police station...</p>

    <p>"I definitely offended this year's taisui<sup>2</sup>!" Xiao Yin suddenly sat up straight and shook his head bitterly as he lamented loudly.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>('Taisui' refers to the stars directly opposite the planet Jupiter in its twelve-year orbital cycle, which are personified as gods. It's believed that those who possess particular characteristics that clash with the taisui or god of a current year will encounter struggles or misfortune or die young in that year.)</dfn>

    <p>In the front passenger seat, Lord Diulei almost spat blood when he heard this.</p>

    <p>Offending the taisui...</p>

    <p>How can the taisui be older than you?!</p>

    <p>"Come to think of it, aren't you a little too free every day, Senior Immortal?" Xiao Yin asked, hands clasped under his head.</p>

    <p>"..." As the driver, Song Qingshu almost stamped on the brakes when he heard this question. Since he hadn't participated in the crackdown on Immortal Mansion, he didn't know Xiao Yin's real identity. However, he had a feeling that Xiao Yin was more than just Lord Diulei's distant relative.</p>

    <p>In the current cultivation circle at least, Lord Diulei was so renowned that there basically wasn't anyone who would dare ask him such an impolite question. Additionally, the term 'distant relative' was in fact quite vague...</p>

    <p>Therefore, Song Qingshu had always been inwardly suspicious about Xiao Yin's real identity; he just hadn't dared say anything.</p>

    <p>When Lord Diulei heard Xiao Yin's question, the corners of his mouth couldn't help twitching. "Brother Xiao Yin, why do you say that?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "Look, every time I run into trouble, you'll immediately come rushing to the scene. Also, I've realized that you're very concerned about me. When I came out of the police station earlier, I heard people wondering whether you were my father."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei took a deep breath. "...Brother Ling entrusted you to me."</p>

    <p>Otherwise why would he care about all this shit! Who wanted to go running to the police station all the time...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was startled. "Master?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei's face was expressionless as he turned to look at Xiao Yin, as if his heart was exhausted. "Brother Ling felt that you don't know much about the ways of the world, and there are times when your words and behavior can easily cause misunderstandings. Especially when you're at the police station; if you're able to remain silent, then try your best to do so."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin looked puzzled. "Why?" He felt that Officer Gao at the police station was a very good man...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Think about it; if you say something out of place at the police station, it's very easy for them to assume that you're drunk or high on drugs, and they might drag you off to do a blood test."</p>

    <p>"There's this kind of operation?!" Listening to Lord Diulei, Xiao Yin immediately understood how serious his situation was.</p>

    <p>If he was really dragged off to get a blood test done and they detected his holy beast blood, then everything was over...</p>

    <p>After that, it was silent in the car for a while. Both Lord Diulei and Xiao Yin were well aware of the situation, and only Song Qingshu looked bewildered... Listening to what had been said, this incident had something to do with Senior Ling again?</p>

    <p>However, this reinforced Song Qingshu's view of Xiao Yin at that moment.</p>

    <p>This Brother Xiao Yin's identity was absolutely not simple, if he was connected to Senior Ling!</p>

    <p>When the car was about to reach the villa, Lord Diulei spoke up once again. "Finish what you have to do for Senior Ling as soon as possible."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "Okay..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin knew that Lord Diulei was talking about giving blood; he still owed Master six thousand milliliters of holy beast blood...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "If your body is hurt in some way, remember to eat a packet of crispy noodle snacks; it'll bring out the maximum effect..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin scratched his head in puzzlement. "What does that mean???"</p>

    <p>"Exactly what I said."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei sighed. "You'll know once you eat one. This is something Senior Ling gave you... Of course, if you're willing to give me one, I have no complaints."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin sunk into deep thought at these words, and he recalled what that brawny brother Pen at the Wang family's small villa had said to him previously.</p>

    <p>There were many times when three men talking would create a tiger<sup>3</sup>...</p> 
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(When repeated rumor becomes a fact.)</dfn>
    
    <p>Lord Diulei had done well for himself in the cultivation circle over the years. There wasn't any treasure that he hadn't seen, so why was he so attached to a packet of crispy noodle snacks?</p>

    <p>Could it be... that the crispy noodle snacks which Master had given him really had magical effects?</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin's attitude started to change from complete disbelief to mild skepticism.</p>

    <p>"You want a crispy noodle snack?" Xiao Yin patted Lord Diulei on the shoulder and laughed.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei's entire body shuddered. "..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "How about this, I'll give you a packet. After all, I've been living at Senior Immortal's house, and actually I'm a little sorry about the inconvenience."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Really?"</p>

    <p>"Of course! But I have a small request..." Xiao Yin said. "Tonight, I'll have to trouble Senior Immortal to please help me brew a pot of immortal mountain snow lotus tea; the best would be the one that's six hundred years old... Remember to count up to two hundred and thirty-three seconds after the spirit water has boiled before filtering the tea - that's when it's at its most fragrant!"</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu broke out in a sweat. Six hundred year-old immortal mountain snow lotus... This was the most expensive tea in Lord Diulei's villa, its value incomparable.</p>

    <p>Even Lord Diulei himself wouldn't normally drink it...</p>

    <p>But contrary to Song Qingshu's expectations, Lord Diulei actually gritted his teeth and replied, "Fine!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin stretched his legs out and crossed them as he sat facing forward, looking very pleased. "I'll have to trouble Senior Immortal to please massage my shoulders at night..."</p>

    <p>The corners of Lord Diulei's mouth twitched. "Alright..."</p>

    <p>His voice was trembling...</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu was speechless. What kind of distant relative was this? This was just like taking care of a young master!</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin hadn't expected Lord Diulei to agree so readily.</p>

    <p>It suddenly occurred to him that he hadn't taken a bath in a long while...</p>

    <p>For a holy beast like him, taking a bath in his human form didn't work to clean him, so he had to turn back into his beast form.</p>

    <p>Seeing how agreeable Lord Diulei was, Xiao Yin said bluntly, "Lastly, when I take a bath in the evening, Senior Immortal, please brush my fur<sup>4</sup> for me..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>4</sup>(Yes, horses have hair and not fur in English, but the word 'mao' in Chinese can encompass both.)</dfn>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu was also directly stupefied.</p>

    <p>Fur?</p>

    <p>What fur...</p>
