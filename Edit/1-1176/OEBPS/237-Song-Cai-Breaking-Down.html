  <h1>Chapter 237 Song Cai, Breaking Down </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Every school or every class would always have a little angel in charge of information and gossip. Number 60 High School's Guo Hao was one of them. Number 59 High School's Song Cai was another.</p>

    <p>Relying on the practice of astrology, Song Cai had made a lot of money and also a lot of friends in school. He charged a thousand yuan for each divination with a money back guarantee if it wasn't accurate. As the thirteenth generation heir of the Tuochuqikanjiji family, he had always been very confident in his astrological predictions.</p>

    <p>However, he had begun to doubt the accuracy of his divinations recently...</p>

    <p>It all started some time ago.</p>

    <p>In addition to many loyal divination customers in school, Song Cai had also opened an online store.</p>

    <p>He remembered that a few days after his store had just been opened, a customer had asked him to divine their fate for the near future.</p>

    <p>Divining fate was Song Cai's specialty. Once he had the other party's zodiac sign and exact date of birth and firmly bore this information in mind as he meditated and prayed, the crystal ball would reveal the final prediction.</p>

    <p>Song Cai remembered, something which he had never seen before had appeared that day.</p>

    <p>Because the crystal ball hadn't shown the usual prediction.</p>

    <p>But three English letters: GCM...</p>

    <p>Song Cai had thought that his crystal ball had broken, hence why it was showing this messy code, but when he replaced it with the spare crystal ball at home, the divination result was still these three mysterious English letters.</p>

    <p>Song Cai had been driven mad. Who could tell him what the hell this meant?!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Hence, when He Bufeng mentioned astrology and introduced him to the others, Song Cai really felt his blood freeze.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Song Cai, your predictions are always on point. Can you divine the last god-blessed circle through one of us?" asked He Bufeng.</p>

    <p>The teenager with the gold-rimmed glasses sat in one corner with his arms around his knees; his face was full of chagrin, and he looked like he wanted to cry but had no tears to shed. "Senior He... my divination might not work..."</p>

    <p>"How will you know if you don't try?" He Bufeng patted Song Cai on the shoulder with a firm expression.</p>

    <p>Song Cai raised his head, his eyes glittering with tears.</p>

    <p>When a person had doubts in their life, the most important thing for them was the encouragement of others. It could be said that He Bufeng's encouragement actually proved quite important; Song Cai pondered for a very long time, and then looked to the side at the many expectant expressions on the students' faces.</p>

    <p>In the end, he quietly got up and said to the crowd, "Then... please help me see if there's a crystal ball nearby. Otherwise, glassware can also work."</p>

    <p>In astrology, the resource consumed the most was the crystal ball, because with each divination, a crack would appear in the crystal ball. Each crystal ball could only be used four times at the most, because a cracked crystal ball could greatly affect the effects of the divination.</p>

    <p>"So glassware can actually be used as a replacement?" asked someone.</p>

    <p>"Yes." Song Cai nodded. "But unlike a regular crystal ball, any other glassware will basically be scrapped after one use. The accuracy of the divination is also lower than with a regular crystal ball, about one or two percent? Generally, it's not a big gap."</p>

    <p>"Oh, so it's like that!" The students around him had enlightened expressions.</p>

    <p>The good news was that their base was in a large supermarket, so there were plenty of glass items to choose from.</p>

    <p>At last, Song Cai picked out a large electric light bulb which Su Xiao had found. "I'll use this."</p>

    <p>"What's next?" He Bufeng asked.</p>

    <p>Song Cai looked around and said, "I'm going to hold this light bulb for the divination and everyone needs to hold hands in a circle around me; this will improve the accuracy of the prediction."</p>

    <p>Almost everyone had basically lost the courage to hold hands with the opposite sex after Junior Grade Three, but for the sake of victory, they did as instructed.</p>

    <p>To pray together hand-in-hand was the most basic way of improving the accuracy of an astrological divination.</p>

    <p>After the ceremony was completed, Song Cai nodded with satisfaction. With the light bulb in hand, he then slowly sat down in the center of the circle.</p>

    <p>He took a deep breath and tried to relax as much as possible. Calling up spirit energy, he put it into the light bulb, and it lit up with a "ding . "</p>

    <p>A moment later, the light bulb directly exploded in Song Cai's hands.</p>

    <p>The students sitting in a circle were startled. "Did it fail?"</p>

    <p>"No, it worked..."</p>

    <p>Song Cai slowly opened his eyes and looked upward. "After ten seconds, the divination will be projected in the air."</p>

    <p>Everyone present held their breaths and all eyes were fixed on the air.</p>

    <p>Ten seconds later, the astrological divination slowly unfolded in the air...</p>

    <p>Song Cai looked up and saw the big three English letters in front of him once again.</p>

    <p>Song Cai: "..."</p>

    <p>Mom! As expected, my divination is broken!</p>

    <p>"GCM? What the hell does that mean?" In the supermarket, everyone looked at the three letters and pondered.</p>

    <p>"Photocatalysis, Guo Chunmei, engineering gate <sup>1</sup> ..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The first letters of the
characters in each of these
three Chinese words in pinyin
make up the acronym GCM.)</dfn>

    <p>He Bufeng said a few words in a row, and then his eyes lit up. "Could it be... climax <sup>2</sup> ...?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>('Climax' is 'gao chao' in Chinese..)</dfn>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling never thought that General Yi would leave the source of the small world with him.</p>

    <p>This was a valuable gift.</p>

    <p>He was clear that if General Yi had left him the runestone, that meant that he would surely be able to win the competition by relying on the god-blessed circle. And with this runestone in hand, he could willfully absorb the small world's source of spirit energy for his own use.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had a headache, because for him, this was a hot potato.</p>

    <p>He never wanted to be the center of attention. If he won this competition, all eyes would definitely be on him.</p>

    <p>"Is Senior Ling worried about this runestone?" Immortal Toya asked as he stared at it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling pinched the runestone between his fingers and then a light flashed in his hand. Immortal Toya then saw the runestone disappear!</p>

    <p>The ancient barter array had actually inspired Wang Ling as he recalled the Barter Skill, which was one of the Three Thousand Great Spells which he had learned. In fact, it worked in a very similar way to the ancient barter array, and you could do an exchange for something you wanted within a limited range of transfer.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Still in the big supermarket, Guo Hao clutched his stomach as he hid in the toilet. It had started hurting again when he had gone looking for glassware earlier.</p>

    <p>But when he had rushed to the toilet, he had discovered that it didn't have any toilet paper!</p>

    <p>Guo Hao fumbled around in his storage bag for a long time, and was miserable when he realized that he only had a snack gift pack which he had risked his life to grab when an airdrop had happened in front of the supermarket previously.</p>

    <p>However, Guo Hao was truly a master. At that moment, Guo Hao quickly recalled that the crispy noodle snack inside the snack gift pack would contain a collection card! He could use the card in place of toilet paper!</p>

    <p>At this thought, he hurriedly took out that crispy noodle snack excitedly.</p>

    <p>However, the moment he took it out, the crispy noodle snack flashed with spirit light in his hand, and turned into a runestone shaped like a seashell...</p>

    <p>...</p>
