  <h1>Chapter 137 What Is South Tianhe's Specialty? </h1>

  <div>

    <p>In all of Wang Ling's life plans, there was almost nothing else he wanted more than to live a smooth and stable life. But he realized that things always turned out contrary to what he wanted. An ordinary life was hard to come by for him...</p>

    <p>It was May 29th on Saturday in the fifth week of the semester.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was standing at the door with a bag in one hand. Seeing that Wang Ling himself had opened the door, he hurried to make a bow and greet him enthusiastically. "Morning, Brother Ling."</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling's expression was cold.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, Lord Diulei felt that it was very tiring to be friends with Wang Ling; he had to learn to read him from the tiny shifts in his expressions, otherwise he wouldn't be able to understand him at all.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was wearing his standard "dead fish eyes" expression, but as one of Wang Ling's few friends in the cultivation world, Lord Diulei felt that he could see a hint of bewilderment in the other man's eyes... if it could be summarized in four words, it would be: "Why are you here?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei lifted the bag in his hand. "I planted the broccoli which great senior gifted me in our family's spirit soil. I water it every morning, and it's growing very well! I harvested this bag of broccoli this morning, so it's very fresh. I wanted to give them to the seniors, so I brought it over."</p>

    <p>Without saying a single word, Wang Ling moved to shut the door...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei quickly thrust his hand into the gap between the door and its frame. "Brother Ling, wait, I'm here today on business! Do you remember that Third Saint from last time? He sent a suitcase to my villa, and I want you to take a look at it for me."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought for a while, then relaxed his grip on the door knob and let him in.</p>

    <p>Changing into slippers after entering the house, Lord Diulei lamented endlessly in his heart: nowadays, it was really so hard to come to this holy place to make his obeisance to the great seniors!</p>

    <p>Sensing that the Wang family's small villa was extraordinarily quiet today, he asked in confusion, "Huh? Great seniors aren't home today?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was too lazy to explain, and instead pointed nonchalantly at several travel magazines on the coffee table.</p>

    <p>Mother Wang and the old man had gone through them yesterday before they had left, and the magazines hadn't been put away yet.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei understood at once: so the great seniors had gone on a trip!</p>

    <p>But the destination was a little strange...</p>

    <p>Henan?</p>

    <p>...South Tianhe <sup>1</sup> ?</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Tianhe means "river," and
Henan literally translates to
"river south.")</dfn>

    <p>That place might be a scenic travel destination for ordinary people, but he felt that there was no value in it for cultivators.</p>

    <p>South Tianhe not only lacked natural spirit energy, it was also missing adventure thrills — scenic spots nowadays painstakingly created gimmicks to attract cultivators and their money. Currently, the most popular destinations were probably Black Ox Treasure Town, which was Old Demon Han's former residence, and the holy land of Malegebi <sup>2</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(In reaction to Chinese
online censorship laws,
Chinese netizens started
using the phrase "grass mud
horse" as a homonym
substitute for "fuck your
mother" online. This
spawned the creation of
various stories about the
grass mud horse, one of
them being that the
creature lives in the
Malegebi desert, which is a
homonym for another curse
expression, "fuck your
mom's genitals.")</dfn>

    <p>Lord Diulei stared at the travel magazines for quite a while. Finally, he stroked his chin and couldn't help sighing. "I'll also buy these two magazines later and bring them home to take a look; there has to be something unusual about this place if the two great seniors chose to visit it!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Anyway, I remember that South Tianhe doesn't seem to have any specialties... if we don't count their manhole covers <sup>3</sup> ."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(China's central Henan
province has historically been
stereotyped as the home of
lunatics and thieves who
would even steal the covers
off manholes.)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't know what expression to use in response. "..." History told him that there was no happy ending for blackening a region <sup>4</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>4</sup>(Presumably this is a reference
to how a lawyer sued Beijing
TV for a sketch that aired
during its 2017 Spring Festival
gala program which he
claimed was defamatory and
discriminatory against the
people of Henan ..)</dfn>

    <p>"By the way, Brother Ling! Third Saint sent over a suitcase, have a look at it." Now that that little interlude was over, Lord Diulei finally came back to the original topic.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling silently nodded. A spirit light flashed in Lord Diulei's hand, and a suitcase with a lock on it appeared. "The lock is encrypted..."</p>

    <p>Cautiously, Wang Ling first used his Heavenly Eye to carefully check and confirm that there were no traps on the suitcase. He had let Third Saint go back then, and although he didn't know his whereabouts, the other party had indeed kept the promise he had made upon his departure to stop working for Mo Immortal Castle. At the same time, he had also withdrawn from the Ten Saints group. Wang Ling felt that the suitcase most likely contained intelligence which Third Saint had acquired.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling touched the lock on the case and frowned. It was made from bronze jade, and while it wasn't the hardest substance in the universe, on Earth it still ranked among the best. But that wasn't the real issue — the problem was that the lock had been encrypted by Third Saint.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "The lock is very intricately designed; it doesn't have a bolt, but it contains a 64-bit encryption array. To unlock it, you need to decode this small array. I've been looking up a lot of information over the last two days, but so far I've got nothing. I researched it for two whole days, but I can't break it. I wonder if Brother Ling has any ideas..."</p>

    <p>Just as he finished speaking, Wang Ling stretched out his hand to pinch the lock...</p>

    <p>Then, " click "!</p>

    <p>The bronze jade lock directly crumbled to dust, and the suitcase popped open!</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>After that, Wang Ling pushed the case to Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..." This was too fucking simple and crude!</p>

    <p>As Wang Ling had guessed, once the suitcase was open, a stack of data met their eyes. Giving it a cursory look-through, Lord Diulei realized that it was all records of backdoor business transactions between Landscape Manor and Mo Immortal Castle! If they had the opportunity to indict Mo Immortal Castle in the future, all of this would become evidence!</p>

    <p>"I never thought that Third Saint would even be able to get his hands on their account books. This is solid evidence! We were initially worried that we wouldn't be able to find any."</p>

    <p>While this was a pleasant surprise, Lord Diulei was still a little disappointed. This evidence wouldn't have much impact on the current situation; at most, it could only prove that Mo Immortal Castle, which was a well-known education institution in the market, was hiding a series of secret interests.</p>

    <p>That Lord of the Castle was a very cautious person; it was possible that with time, leaked records like these found by Third Saint would eventually be covered up. For these people, money laundering was as easy as eating or drinking water.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at the suitcase for a while. Then he pushed aside the stack of information, and in the end, actually discovered an inconspicuous hidden compartment at the very bottom!</p>

    <p>This compartment had been expanded with the Space Expansion Skill, but on the outside looked as thin as a needle... nevertheless, it still couldn't escape Wang Ling's eyes.</p>

    <p>They could imagine that Third Saint had put in airtight protection measures to prevent this suitcase from falling into other people's hands. Even if someone else got hold of these records, they wouldn't understand it. It was very clear, however, that what was in the hidden compartment was the key!</p>

    <p>"That's just like Brother Ling! To be able to even find this..." Lord Diulei started to feel inferior again.</p>

    <p>Using spirit energy, he drew out the object in the hidden compartment.</p>

    <p>Following that, a little red brocade bag came into view.</p>
