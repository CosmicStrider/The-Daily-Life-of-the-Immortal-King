  <h1>Chapter 293 Intrinsic Spirit Field </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was obvious that the current situation was already out of this female elder's control. If this young man hadn't been here, she thought she would still have had a fifty percent of winning, even if Dharmaraja and Luo Chuang combined their strength. As an Itinerant Immortal, she had a bigger advantage.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, Wang Ling's presence had ruined all her plans, and she was completely at a loss.</p>

    <p>At that moment, all kinds of thoughts circled through her mind... what now, surrender?</p>

    <p>She indeed had this thought.</p>

    <p>Seeing how Wang Ling had counteracted the force of her stomp with a brush of his foot over the ground, the female elder had already accepted that the winner of this conflict had been decided, and she didn't want to fight any longer. However, she didn't dare admit her defeat out loud... If she surrendered here, she would definitely incur Master's wrath in the end.</p>

    <p>When it came down to it, she was just a middle man. Whatever she did next would only wind up in embarrassment for her.</p>

    <p>Whenever something like this happened, the best thing to do was to pass the buck on to someone else.</p>

    <p>This female elder in purple stared at her inheriting disciple next to her in heavy silence for a while...</p>

    <p>"Shifu, what should we do now?" asked the slit-eyed female cultivator.</p>

    <p>"Ya Xuan, call your Senior Uncle Feifei to come," the female elder said without hesitation.</p>

    <p>The slit-eyed female cultivator: "But... how do I call him?"</p>

    <p>The female elder: "Didn't you make an earthen pot before? That day on your birthday, he left a mark on it. You just need to smash the pot, and your senior uncle will come."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei laughed. "You can't win, so you're calling for reinforcements?"</p>

    <p>The corner of the female elder's mouth twitched again. "You outnumber us; winning like this wouldn't be honorable!"</p>

    <p>"Fine, do whatever you want." Lord Diulei waved his hands.</p>

    <p>His agreement wasn't meant to create trouble for Wang Ling; it was Wang Ling who had personally told him to let them do so.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling had brushed his foot over the ground just now to dissolve the force of the female elder's stomp, his real intention actually had been to create a link with her spirit energy through her attack. In this way, he could secretly search her memories without being noticed.</p>

    <p>But after going through her memories, Wang Ling had been disappointed. Because her rank wasn't high enough, she had had very few opportunities to meet the Master of Immortal Mansion, and thus didn't know very much more about the master than those inner sect female disciples.</p>

    <p>But now that the other party was calling in reinforcements, Wang Ling simply couldn't be happier.</p>

    <p>The reinforcements they would call for in a situation like this definitely had to be someone significant!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Following the elder's instructions, the slit-eyed female cultivator took out the earthen pot with trembling hands, then threw it onto the ground with a cry of "haiyah."</p>

    <p>The instant it shattered, whether it was Wang Ling, Lord Diulei or Dharmaraja and Luo Chuang on the side, they could all clearly sense the vigorous spirit energy that poured out of the pot.</p>

    <p>"What powerful spirit intensity!" Lord Diulei furrowed his brow.</p>

    <p>Spirit intensity was the standard measurement of spirit energy, and a scale for measuring spirit intensity was currently being sold on the market. At that moment, the spirit intensity that had been unleashed had definitely surpassed what the scale could measure... In a real sense, it was at one hundred percent!</p>

    <p>"Who is it?!"</p>

    <p>Within seconds of the pot shattering, there was a bellow of rage in the air; the voice seemed to be coming from the distant horizon in an unceasing tide of noise.</p>

    <p>A moment later, a massive black figure dropped from the sky with a resounding boom as the earth shook heavily from the impact.</p>

    <p>From their initial contact with Immortal Mansion, Wang Ling already knew that it didn't have any male disciples. But the huge monster which had appeared in front of them was still beyond their expectations. It was a twenty-zhang tall silver giant horse in armor, which stared menacingly at Wang Ling and his group.</p>

    <p>"What is that thing?" A huge shadow enveloped them, and it was so oppressive that sweat instantly started to roll down the foreheads of Dharmaraja and the others.</p>

    <p>"I believe this horse has something to do with the holy array!" Luo Chuang knitted his eyebrows together.</p>

    <p>Very quickly, however, that sense of oppression disappeared after Wang Ling covered everyone with his protective golden light.</p>

    <p>This silver warhorse silently stared at this protective golden light for a bit. After that, its enormous body gradually shrunk down to a regular size, though the pressure it released didn't diminish in the slightest.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, could this be..." Lord Diulei already had an inkling of this warhorse's origin.</p>

    <p>It had to be...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at the silver warhorse in front of him and narrowed his eyes.</p>

    <p>This was a genuine holy beast. Furthermore, it was endowed with the abilities of a core array pattern, which was why it was saturated with spirit energy and had such formidable strength.</p>

    <p>When they had been sucked into the game space back then, Lord Diulei clearly remembered that Wang Ling had destroyed the array pattern in one stroke, causing the entire space to instantly collapse. Now, this holy beast bore the power of the core array pattern. If they injured it heavily, the Ice Crystal Array might not collapse straightaway, but it would definitely have a heavy impact on the structure of the space.</p>

    <p>When that time came, they wouldn't have to continue wearing women's clothes!</p>

    <p>Of course, this wasn't the main problem.</p>

    <p>The main issue was, Immortal Mansion actually had a holy beast?</p>

    <p>Hadn't all of them already died out earlier on?</p>

    <p>Whether locally or abroad, a first-class spirit beast would be a major discovery. Countless spirit beasts had become extinct not so long ago due to extreme campaigns and hunting by cultivators. In the olden days, plenty of spirit beasts and even holy beasts had been killed for bone soup and meatballs... According to ancient texts, there had been a pitiful nine-headed lion<sup>1</sup> holy beast which had been beheaded by a brat and turned into braised lion's head<sup>2</sup>.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(From "Journey to the West")</dfn>
    
    <br/>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is the name of a dish made with pork meatballs)</dfn>

    <p>Although for now, they didn't know this silver warhorse's origin, from its aura, there was no doubt that it was a holy beast!</p>

    <p>"Are you the one who hurt our Immortal Mansion people? Now that you've come, why don't all of you just stay!" the silver warhorse roared as it raised its front hooves.</p>

    <p>In just a blink of an eye, the space around them transformed, and they found themselves in a barren landscape.</p>

    <p>Everyone had been sucked into it, and Dharmaraja and Luo Chuang were deeply shocked.</p>

    <p>"An intrinsic spirit field?!" Luo Chuang narrowed his eyes.</p>

    <p>"What's that?" Dharmaraja was stupefied.</p>

    <p>"It's also a type of small world, and is also known as the Internal Small World. Formed inside the body, it can be instantly released during battle. Massive amounts of spirit energy can be stored in the spirit field, and only the person who discharges the spirit field can use this spirit energy... In other words, if we run out of spirit energy, we won't be able to replenish it inside the spirit field." Luo Chuang narrowed his eyes. "As expected of a holy beast..."</p>

    <p>"Then what should we do now?"</p>

    <p>"We can only depend on Ling Zhenren... We don't have enough strength to fight an enemy who can discharge an intrinsic spirit field." Luo Chuang sighed as he patted Dharmaraja's shoulder. "Just be like me, and be a commentator â€” commentators never die."</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja: "..."</p>
