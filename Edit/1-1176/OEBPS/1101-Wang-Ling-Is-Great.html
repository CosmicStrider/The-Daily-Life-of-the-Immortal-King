  <h1>Chapter 1101 Wang Ling Is Great!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Headmaster Chen was an honest person, and had always been modest and prudent when conducting himself in society. In front of old man Sun Yiyuan, he felt that he should be even more modest in his manner. Actually, in Headmaster Chen's heart, Wang Ling was indeed an excellent student. He couldn't say that, however; instead, he would speak of Wang Ling's shortcomings and mistakes.</p>

    <p>Then, what were Wang Ling's shortcomings and mistakes?</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen pondered carefully for quite some time. Apart from the fact that Wang Ling was a little too withdrawn, which wasn't really a shortcoming... he really couldn't find fault with Wang Ling. In all the years since Number 60 High was founded, Headmaster Chen felt that Wang Ling was the first student with such a commonplace existence.</p>

    <p>He got average marks in his tests and stood in the middle of the class queue. As for his ranking in all team competitions... it seemed that he was in the middle.</p>

    <p>"According to Headmaster Chen, Student Wang Ling is introverted. Then, does he have any friends?" Old Man Sun asked.</p>

    <p>"Of course," answered Headmaster Chen.</p>

    <p>Up to that point, Headmaster Chen had in fact been keeping a careful eye on every student's social circle. He was worried that there would be students who were unable to fit in and were thus isolated. Isolated children were more vulnerable to school violence, which wasn't necessarily physical; cold violence was also a type of school violence.</p>

    <p>As headmaster, Headmaster Chen felt that it was his mandatory duty to put an end to school violence.</p>

    <p>Teaching head knowledge was admittedly important, but so was nurturing the spirit. Headmaster Chen hoped that every student who graduated from Number 60 High would leave Senior Grade Three with good memories, and not psychological shadows which they might bury in their hearts for decades, before they came back to beat up or denounce teachers and say that it was never too late to take revenge.</p>

    <p>"Having friends proves that Wang Ling has his own special charisma." Old Man Sun laughed as he got a clearer picture of Wang Ling in his mind.</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen didn't know what to say, and could only smile. "Our school used to have an entrance test which made use of the remnants of a demon king's primordial soul. At the beginning of the first semester, the demon king unexpectedly escaped... Fortunately, our teacher reacted promptly and fused the residual soul with the skeleton of a dog, turning it into a green-furred akita."</p>

    <p>"Oh, something like this happened?" Old Man Sun was amazed.</p>

    <p>"Yes, Mr Sun. That dog is now being raised at Wang Ling's home. Back then, a lot of the students said that they couldn't keep a dog at home, but Wang Ling's family just happened to have a lot of space. In addition, we also felt that Wang Ling was too introverted. Getting him to help us raise the dog would also help Student Wang Ling become closer with the other students..." said Headmaster Chen.</p>

    <p>His intention in saying this much was clear.</p>

    <p>He was correcting Old Man Sun's thoughts about Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>What he was implying was that Wang Ling's ability to make friends had less to do with his charisma than with part of the school's educational policy and decision-making.</p>

    <p>But Old Man Sun clearly didn't think that way.</p>

    <p>After hearing the whole story, he couldn't help beaming. "Wang Ling is so withdrawn, but not only can he make friends, even the dog is willing to stay at his place. That isn't easy!"</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen: "..."</p>

    <p>Old Man Sun: "Besides, this dog has the soul of a demon king, doesn't it?"</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen: "Yes..."</p>

    <p>Old Man Sun: "As a demon king, has it been behaving itself after turning into a dog?"</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen: "Very much so. And now that it's familiar with Wang Ling, it listens to him. When the Shadow Stream assassins came to the school back then, Student Er Ha helped us kill one of them."</p>

    <p>"Isn't that great?" Old Man Sun said, "Since Student Wang Ling's family is raising the dog, this is enough to prove that Wang Ling's family upbringing is very good. Even making the demon king obedient! Don't you think there's something in the way that even such a fierce demon king can be reformed and do what it's told?"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Headmaster Chen was instantly lost for words.</p>

    <p>Old Man Sun's analysis was incredibly logical and practically watertight... Even if Headmaster Chen wanted to refute, he couldn't! The school had just been discussing whether or not they should pay Wang Ling's family a home visit again to see if any domestic violence was taking place. But now, hearing Old Man Sun's words, Headmaster Chen instantly felt that it actually wasn't necessary.</p>

    <p>This was a household that could reform even the demon king - how could it possibly use violence against Student Wang Ling? Old Man Sun's logic was irrefutable! Moreover, even if there really was any domestic violence in the family, Er Ha would have long told the other students about it. Given its spiritual intelligence, how could it not have done something?</p>

    <p>"Apart from what you've mentioned, is there anything else about Student Wang Ling?"</p>

    <p>Old Man Sun was becoming more and more interested in Wang Ling. Headmaster Chen wiped at his sweat. He was a little reluctant to continue the conversation about Wang Ling, so he changed the topic. "As for Student Xia Ming..."</p>

    <p>"Oh, that Student Xia Ming. I'm not interested. Isn't he just from the Ancient Divine Clan? We also have company staff from the Ancient Divine Clan, and they aren't any damn use." Old Man Sun rubbed the top of his cane, his face as calm as an ancient well.</p>

    <p>Many people were very envious of the innate advantage of the Ancient Divine Clan's spirit root, but if the clan members weren't talented in their cultivation and their realms stalled for a long time, this advantage still wasn't any use; after they graduated, they still had to work for other people.</p>

    <p>As the chairman of a large corporation, Old Man Sun had more or less seen everything, so he naturally wasn't impressed by a mere kid from the Ancient Divine Clan.</p>

    <p>In addition, when Xia Ming first entered Number 60 High, it wasn't a key city high school, but a key district school without a particularly high ranking. In Old Man Sun's view, for a child of the Ancient Divine Clan to study in this school meant that he wasn't particularly outstanding.</p>

    <p>"Let's continue talking about Student Wang Ling, Headmaster Chen." Old Man Sun brightened when he brought up Wang Ling again.</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen could only change the way he talked about Wang Ling's shortcomings. "Student Wang Ling's grades are always down the middle, and I wonder if his dead fish eyes are distracting..."</p>

    <p>"Oh, you mean his single eyelids. I didn't especially like them too, at first, and I also wondered if I should help pay for him to get double eyelid surgery. Later, my assistant said that our Rongrong likes this sort of eyes. Now, I'm used to them. These single eyelids look lifeless, but in fact are especially intimidating, and can give a person a sense of security!" Old Man Sun analyzed.</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen: "Also, as far as I know, Wang Ling still likes snacks, like crispy noodle snacks, for example..."</p>

    <p>"Crispy noodle snacks."</p>

    <p>Old Man Sun nodded. "Crispy noodle snacks are good! Eating snacks indicates a childlike innocence. Moreover, you can collect cards from crispy noodle snacks! No doubt, Student Wang Ling collects them! This ability also proves that he has a pretty good concept of financial management - he'll be able to accumulate a fortune!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>For a while, Headmaster Chen was speechless.</p>

    <p>Old Man Sun had turned everything into praise...</p>
