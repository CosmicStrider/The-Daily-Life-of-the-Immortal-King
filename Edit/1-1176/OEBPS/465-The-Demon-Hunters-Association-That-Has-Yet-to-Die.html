  <h1>Chapter 465 The Demon Hunters Association That Has Yet to Die </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Although the Lady of the Castle couldn't estimate this Senior Bai's exact strength, she was well aware of his identity: this was a wanted major criminal, President Bai of the Demon Hunters Association. However, based on the various clues and statements which the police currently had, none of the members of the Demon Hunters Association who had been arrested could describe President Bai's appearance.</p>

    <p>Not even members at the higher levels of the Demon Hunters Association like Strong Zuo had ever seen his real face.</p>

    <p>The only person who knew President Bai's true appearance was perhaps the servant standing next to him with the black umbrella... But even if he was just a servant, the Lady felt that his strength was no weaker than hers, which was a little frightening.</p>

    <p>When the Lady mentioned the old devil and the Master of Immortal Mansion, President Bai's gaze changed slightly.</p>

    <p>There were actually a lot of intelligence organizations in Songhai city, and while he had heard that Mo Immortal Castle's intelligence network was second to none, seeing was believing. This young man with the abnormally pale complexion hadn't thought that Mo Immortal Mansion would have actually dealt with Daoist Taotie, the Master of Immortal Mansion and the old devil.</p>

    <p>Intelligence could be very costly, but there were times when cost didn't mean accuracy.</p>

    <p>It would thus depend on whether or not the intelligence agency had the pertinent business qualifications. If even the old devil had come here to buy information... President Bai immediately felt that this information was perhaps worth the price.</p>

    <p>"Old Lu, arrange the transfer." President Bai raised his hand.</p>

    <p>This servant called Lu was stunned. "President, do you need to think it over again?"</p>

    <p>"No need."</p>

    <p>The abnormally pale youth waved his hand. "Our Demon Hunters Association lost two elders this time. I know very well how strong Elder Canglan and Elder Han are. I sent the both of them to deal with a third-class dog, but in the end there was unexpectedly nothing left of them. Moreover, the initial reason our Demon Hunters Association is in turmoil this time is all because of this dog. If I don't find and stew this dog, it'll be very hard for me to get rid of my hatred!"</p>

    <p>"Very well..."</p>

    <p>The old servant had no choice but to nod his head; for some reason, his eyelid was twitching very fiercely, and he had a bad feeling.</p>

    <p>While the old servant held the black umbrella in one hand, a rattan limb actually extended out of the front of his jacket. He then took out a cell phone and used the rattan arm to directly operate it.</p>

    <p>The Lady stared blankly. Judging from his aura, this didn't seem like a wood spell; rather, it seemed much more like a human limb...</p>

    <p>Could it be that this person was a tree goblin?</p>

    <p>An old tree that had been enlightened and turned into a human form... she felt like she had learned something amazing.</p>

    <p>Because the tree goblins belonged to the demon race.</p>

    <p>Although the Lady had heard that there were some demon clans that had fled the Gate Between Worlds and integrated into the human world in human form, this was her first time seeing hints of it. The point was that this old servant was so well hidden that there wasn't even any demon qi on him.</p>

    <p>Thinking this, the Lady had a slight notion of the origins of this master and servant duo.</p>

    <p>A tree goblin which could take human form had to have at least over three thousand years' worth of cultivation - it was very likely that he was an Itinerant Immortal.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, such an Itinerant Immortal tree goblin was willing to be the servant of this abnormally pale young man...</p>

    <p>If this abnormally pale young man wasn't this human-shaped tree goblin's second eldest uncle <sup>1</sup> , it only proved that the young man's strength was probably above that of Itinerant Immortal... making him stronger than Daoist Taotie.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(In Beijing, this is used as a vulgarity, like 'fuck your mom.')</dfn>

    <p>He was a True Immortal expert!</p>

    <p>Suddenly, the Lady realized that this young man could be an opportunity for Mo Immortal Castle to get back on their feet after their current financial slump.</p>

    <p>The Lady thought that if they could pull in such a True Immortal senior as a patron, things would go a lot more smoothly for them in the future.</p>

    <p>"President Bai, please wait a minute," the Lady said suddenly.</p>

    <p>"Hm?" The abnormally pale young man looked up.</p>

    <p>"I can sell you this information at a ten percent discount."</p>

    <p>"What do you want?" The abnormally pale young man's eyes turned deep.</p>

    <p>As President of the Demon Hunters Association, he had traveled all over the world and encountered all types of situations; he had also undertaken all kinds of transactions, so he naturally knew the rules of trade. Meat pies never dropped from the sky for free. Information which cost five hundred thousand immortal gold bars suddenly sold at a ten percent discount; there was definitely some sort of request attached to it.</p>

    <p>"This junior knows that members of the Demon Hunters Association are now wanted and being arrested by the police all over the place, and it's currently at a critical juncture... senior, as long as you help Mo Immortal Castle do one thing in exchange, we'll sell this information to you at a discount price."</p>

    <p>"Ha ha, then why don't you just directly give me the information for free, as a passing favor?" The abnormally pale young man smiled.</p>

    <p>The Lady: "Because we are really poor right now!"</p>

    <p>The abnormally pale young man: "..."</p>

    <p>This simple and blunt reason also stunned the tree goblin servant with the surname Lu who was standing behind the abnormally pale young man.</p>

    <p>"Well, let me hear your request first," the abnormally pale young man said.</p>

    <p>"It's like this, senior: our Mo Immortal Castle is currently going through a slump and we have to sell information for a living... all this was because of one person. Although he appears to be a teenager, his realm is unfathomable. We dispatched people several times to teach him a lesson, but all of them were completely defeated."</p>

    <p>The Lady recalled that miserable experience. "Our Mo Immortal Castle hired the Ten Saints previously, but now they've become the Seven Freaks of Jiangnan..."</p>

    <p>The abnormally pale young man: "..."</p>

    <p>The Lady said, "Also, I suspect that the arrests of the old devil and the Master of Immortal Mansion most likely have to do with this person."</p>

    <p>"I see."</p>

    <p>The abnormally pale young man nodded; he already understood her intention. "You would like me to handle this person?"</p>

    <p>The Lady: "That's right!"</p>

    <p>"That's easy."</p>

    <p>The abnormally pale young man coughed lightly. "I'll first have this Old Lu behind me feel him out; if he can dispose of him, even better. If not, I'll do it myself. How about that?"</p>

    <p>The Lady exulted when she heard this. "If that's possible, that'll be wonderful! But that person seems a little strange; this junior personally feels that Senior Lu might not be able to deal with him..."</p>

    <p>The abnormally pale young man laughed. "I think you can already tell that Old Lu is not an ordinary person... Even if he can't defeat this person who looks like a teenager whom you're talking about, there is no way he'll die. I'm just sending him out to feel out the actual situation."</p>

    <p>Old Lu clearly looked very confident on this point. "You can rest assured... my major wood technique, the Spell of Creation and Rebirth, has a strong self-healing ability. As long as there is a speck of ash left, my body can be reconstructed, even after a blow from a True Immortal."</p>

    <p>"It's this junior who has thought too much!"</p>

    <p>The Lady nodded and cupped her fists in salute to Old Lu. "I wonder what Old Lu's full name is...?"</p>

    <p>"The Lady of the Castle is too polite; you can just call me Old Lu. My given name is Xun <sup>2</sup> ..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Lu Xun was the pen name of Zhou Shuren, a leading figure in modern Chinese literature..)</dfn>

    <p>"..."</p>
