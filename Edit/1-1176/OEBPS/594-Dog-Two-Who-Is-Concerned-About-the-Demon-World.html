  <h1>Chapter 594 Er Ha Who Is Concerned About the Demon World</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This sudden decision was beyond Daoist Witch Demon and Daoist Bronze Turtle's expectations. They could tell that this absolutely wasn't a joke... Besides, this red-haired young man indeed had this type of strength. It was an easy thing for a Venerated Immortal to wreck a planet, let alone four mere territories.</p>

    <p>The two territory envoys left as if they were fleeing for their lives; they had to go back to discuss countermeasures with the demon gods of the inner territories.</p>

    <p>"Senior Dog, are you doing this so that the demon gods of these four territories in the demon world will bury the hatchet and come together once again?" Immortal Zhenyuan asked a moment later.</p>

    <p>"Mm." Er Ha nodded.</p>

    <p>The truth was that the demon world had been very peaceful at one time, but a hundred years ago, after the new generation of demon gods came into office, disputes had cropped up which until now had yet to be settled. This generation's group of demon god leaders were especially extreme. The two demon gods Venerable Ox of the West and Ghost Emperor of the South were both warmongers, while Er Ha's impression of Turtle Devil of the South had always been that he didn't have his own opinion and was easily swayed.</p>

    <p>The dispute between the eastern territory and the other three territories this time was in fact the work of the two demon gods of the western and southern territories.</p>

    <p>A main characteristic of these warmongers was that they usually only thought about their own fun and completely didn't consider the other demon tribes in their territories. So this time, Er Ha's plan was to fight fire with fire, and fight a war to stop a war.</p>

    <p>Of course, this "war" wouldn't really happen.</p>

    <p>It would require that Immortal Zhenyuan played along with Er Ha.</p>

    <p>Gazing at Er Ha, who seemed to be in deep thought, the red-haired young man was filled with endless reverence.</p>

    <p>That was just like Senior Dog, to actually be so worried about the situation in the demon world!</p>

    <p>This was probably what a big shot was like...</p>

    <p>Only big shots had the strength to spare to protect world peace.</p>

    <p>What impressed Zhenyuan the most, moreover, was Er Ha's "educate and teach" approach toward settling the conflict at its root. How mighty was this spirit?</p>

    <p>Staring into the distance, Immortal Zhenyuan sighed. "I hope these demons will be able to understand Senior Dog's way of thinking..."</p>

    <p>While it pondered, Er Ha turned to look at the peace consulate. After seeing the two envoys leave, Elder Wen also walked out and bowed to Er Ha, then turned into a stream of light as he left the place.</p>

    <p>Er Ha guessed that he would be sending the message to Scorpion King of the East. Unlike the other two envoys, Elder Wen's pace was unhurried and he was very composed. He hadn't reacted straightaway at Er Ha proclaiming that it would wipe out the four territories, but judging from his current behavior, Er Ha felt that Elder Wen had likely thought of something.</p>

    <p>This was actually a way to step over the demon gods of the other three territories and was also a lifeline for the outcast eastern territory.</p>

    <p>Now, Er Ha took the position of a third party.</p>

    <p>Whether it could facilitate unity among the four territories would ultimately depend on the decision of the four demon gods.</p>

    <p>But from what Er Ha knew, the two demon god warmongers were guys who wouldn't shed tears until they saw the coffins <sup>1</sup> , so it was likely that they wouldn't admit defeat so easily.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Refers to refusing to be convinced until faced with grim reality.)</dfn>

    <p>This was all actually a little idealistic in Er Ha's view, so it would need to heat things up. "When you attack later on, make sure you go easy on them."</p>

    <p>"Very well, senior!" Zhenyuan nodded agreeably.</p>

    <p>After that, Er Ha personally led the way, and one man and one dog flew in the direction of the western territory.</p>

    <p>They had deliberately waited at the entrance of the peace consulate for a bit before setting out, in order to confirm that Daoist Witch Demon and Daoist Bronze Turtle had brought the word back to those demon gods.</p>

    <p>When they arrived at the pass to the western territory, Er Ha saw an astonishing scene.</p>

    <p>Guarding the pass was a brawny man with a tall and sturdy frame. He had ox horns growing out of his head and held the Guan King Blade <sup>2</sup> . Behind him were thousands of demon beasts, many of whom were demon kings from the various tribes in the western territory. They had all gathered here in the shortest amount of time in an astonishing battle lineup. To tell the truth, Er Ha had never seen anything like this lineup in its days as king. With a demon god commanding this gathering of demon kings, the demon qi here was too overwhelming.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Most likely a reference to the "guandao" or "blade of Guan," which is a Chinese pole weapon that in legend is said to have been invented by the famous general Guan Yu ..)</dfn>

    <p>Er Ha was suddenly very glad that it had the golden light shield, otherwise this battle lineup would have really made its legs go weak.</p>

    <p>That Daoist Witch Demon from before was standing next to the brawny man with horns. "Your Majesty Venerable Ox, I've received the news that Ghost Emperor will be here very soon to fight together with us."</p>

    <p>Venerable Ox of the West scowled. He looked cruel and feral. The Guan King Blade he was holding gave off a silver light as a demonic essence gathered along the blade, and the chain of ox horns which hung around his neck were unusual in their origin. After hearing Daoist Witch Demon's words, Venerable Ox took off his red cloak, baring his upper torso and revealing his majestic muscles. "It's not like Ghost Emperor has to come himself."</p>

    <p>Er Ha smiled coldly at Venerable Ox's attitude and it turned its head to ask, "What do you think?"</p>

    <p>"Junior fully understands senior's thinking," Immortal Zhenyuan said.</p>

    <p>Sometimes it really wasn't good to be too confident in yourself. Many people thought they had seen all of the world, but in fact they were just frogs in a well. Zhenyuan had always thought that he himself had a deep understanding of this point. Before meeting "Senior Dog," he had thought that Venerated Immortal was already the highest realm, and it was only later that he realized that this wasn't the case at all.</p>

    <p>There would always be someone else better than you; no matter how high you climbed, you should always be upright in your attitude and remain humble.</p>

    <p>No confidence and too much confidence - neither extreme was good.</p>

    <p>"Was it you who killed my Horse Face?" Venerable Ox of the West gripped the Guan King Blade firmly. He insolently blew powerful streams of demonic essence out of his nose, causing even the ring in his nose to jerk. This was a kind of sonic spell which used the the vibrations between the air from his nose and the nose ring to create intense spiritual oppression.</p>

    <p>The scene made Zhenyuan sigh, and he snapped his fingers at the sonic spell.</p>

    <p>Er Ha saw a golden circle ripple out from Zhenyuan's hand to directly neutralize this Venerable Ox of the West's sonic spell. Not only that, this simple finger snap actually kicked up a powerful wind which caused the expressions of all the demons present to drain of color.</p>

    <p>It was just a snap of the fingers.</p>

    <p>It was actually so powerful!</p>

    <p>Venerable Ox of the West's eyes turned dark. He then jumped into the air with the Guan King Blade held aloft as he prepared to make his move, and majestic demon essence gathered along the edge of the blade.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Zhenyuan snapped his fingers yet again.</p>

    <p>All the demons present heard the ringing sound of metal breaking.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Venerable Ox of the West never thought that before he could bring his blade down, the only thing that remained of the Guan King Blade in his hand was a stick!</p>

    <p>"Still want to try? If it was Senior Dog who personally took action, you would have already perished with one snap of the fingers."</p>

    <p>In the air, Zhenyuan smiled at Venerable Ox of the West. "You know nothing about power..."</p>
