  <h1>Chapter 708 Ghost Head Blade</h1>

  <div>

    <p>A sword spirit couldn't be cultivated overnight. Although the Heavenly Dao could indeed arrange it, getting crispy noodle snacks in exchange was a bit... It had to be said that the Heavenly Dao had no right to refuse whatever Wang Ling used in a trade. Moreover, the Heavenly Dao couldn't give his own opinion! He couldn't say what he did or did not want!</p>

    <p>This was the absolute rule of an equivalent trade.</p>

    <p>The crucial point was that this young man didn't realize that the other party didn't want crispy noodle snacks at all...</p>

    <p>Thus, when Wang Ling took out the entire box of baked gluten-flavored crispy noodle snacks which he had gotten custom-made, the golden three-inch man that was the embodiment of Heavenly Dao suddenly felt like crying but had no tears to shed.</p>

    <p>He couldn't be any more sure that when he had first done a transaction with a young Wang Ling... it was his brain that had short-circuited!</p>

    <p>This, was the consequence!</p>

    <p>The golden three-inch man stared at this box of crispy noodle snacks, took a deep breath, then directly put it away.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's heart ached a little at this scene - he had never expected this birthday gift to actually cost him this box of crispy noodle snacks, which had twenty-four packets inside... Although he had already opened the box, he hadn't even eaten one packet yet.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at the Heavenly Dao and sighed.</p>

    <p>It was said that Heavenly Dao was heartless, and sure enough, it seemed that there was some truth to it.</p>

    <p>"???"</p>

    <p>After taking the crispy noodle snacks, the golden three-inch man looked at Wang Ling. "The transaction is complete. Everything will be as you wish: on August 1st of this year, the sword spirit will be placed inside the Heavenly Materials sword as agreed. Whether or not he can summon it, however, will depend on him."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded.</p>

    <p>The truth was that he had already helped Wang Ming with the most difficult step: creating the sword spirit.</p>

    <p>But whether or not Wang Ming could summon it would depend on his own will.</p>

    <p>The first summoning of a sword spirit only happened when the owner of the sword needed it the most.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, in the overseas customs line at Songhai International Airport.</p>

    <p>A blonde and blue-eyed young man with hair combed into a swept-back style and wearing an elegant suit stood on the security check platform with his arms spread as a customs little sister checked along his arms and down his trouser legs for dangerous material.</p>

    <p>According to international cultivation flight regulations, cultivators traveling by large magic flight artifacts weren't allowed to carry space storage magic treasures on them. Even pants with independent storage spaces that had been set up in their pockets weren't allowed.</p>

    <p>Confirming that the young man didn't have anything in his pants, the customs little sister ran a black metal probe over his body, which didn't detect anything unusual.</p>

    <p>"Your checks are so strict." The blonde-haired young man smiled in a genteel way as he followed the customs little sister's instruction and walked through the virus-detection gate.</p>

    <p>This was a smart-type virus quarantine magic treasure, initially developed by Huaxiu's Scientific Institute of Cultivation and Magic Treasures, which could detect if overseas cultivators were carrying foreign viruses on them.</p>

    <p>When the young man walked through the detection gate, a green light appeared.</p>

    <p>The customs staff then stamped the young man's passport and gave it back to him with a smile. "Mr Han Di, have a pleasant stay."</p>

    <p>"Thank you." The young man put away the passport and put on a pair of sunglasses.</p>

    <p>Han Di.</p>

    <p>This was the alias that Night Chief's Second President Dylan was using for the Huaxiu operation.</p>

    <p>After passing the security check at customs, President Dylan's anxious heart finally calmed down.</p>

    <p>Because of Bai Zhe that useless trash, plus the fact that Beast King's Remains was about to open, Huaxiu nation had now tightened their security checks at customs. If it hadn't been for the fact that someone inside Huaxiu had helped arrange the identity "Han Di" for President Dylan, he might not even have been able to get a visa.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, this Han Di identity wasn't fake, and did exist in reality.</p>

    <p>When Night Ghost Spirit Emperor had demanded that President Dylan take over the master plan some days ago, the latter had already arranged for someone to prepare a new identity for him.</p>

    <p>This Han Di was the chairman of a vaccine enterprise who was of Mixiu descent. He held quite some power, and ran twenty vaccine testing companies. Unfortunately, there had been a huge issue some time ago with the vaccine produced by one of this "Han Di's" companies.</p>

    <p>Just like that, President Dylan had seized this opening and taken over his identity.</p>

    <p>There actually weren't any problems with that vaccine batch to begin with - it was President Dylan who had dispatched someone to tamper with the vaccine on the production line.</p>

    <p>Vaccines were very important drugs. If there was any problem with safety and quality, this Mr Han Di would be held responsible. Once Huaxiu's Food and Drug Administration tracked him down, several billion in compensation wouldn't be considered a lot. Most crucially, it was very possible that he could be sentenced to several hundreds years of playing mahjong with the Old Devil and the others.</p>

    <p>Afraid, this Mr Han Di thus willingly agreed to the "escape plan" which President Dylan had offered him, and gave away his identity and absconded to Mixiu nation.</p>

    <p>But what this Mr Han Di didn't know was that there were people from Night Chief waiting for him in Huaxiu nation.</p>

    <p>For Night Ghost Spirit Emperor, only dead men told no tales.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When President Dylan strolled out of the airport, a black military SUV was already parked at the A3 exit.</p>

    <p>As he approached the car, the door automatically opened.</p>

    <p>When he got into the car, he immediately received an overseas call on his cell phone, and the number was a string of asterisks.</p>

    <p>He picked up the call right away.</p>

    <p>"Lord Spirit Emperor, I've arrived. Everything went smoothly as planned. And as you expected, Huaxiu has tightened security across the board," said President Dylan.</p>

    <p>"Mm, since everything went smoothly, I'm greatly reassured," said Night Ghost Spirit Emperor. "Do you have enough people in Huaxiu?"</p>

    <p>"Lord, please rest assured. I used the Dark Network to contact a number of vagrant cultivators for hire this time. Their strength is the real deal. Among them, there's one called Ghost Head Blade." Speaking up to this point, President Dylan narrowed his eyes. The Dark Network he was talking about was the mysterious online network set up by dark forces at home and abroad. As long as one had the means to infiltrate it, they could post ads to hire dark vagrant cultivators.</p>

    <p>Given Night Chief's current lack of people in Huaxiu nation, this was the quickest way of rounding up manpower. These dark vagrant cultivators were very expensive to hire, but compared with the master plan, this money was nothing.</p>

    <p>"Hm? What is this Ghost Head Blade's background?" Night Ghost Spirit Emperor's interest was peaked.</p>

    <p>"This person was Numinous Mother's third disciple - I've already sent someone to verify this. Although he isn't on the list of assassins, he's skilled at stealth, transfiguration and invisibility techniques, and comes and goes like a ghost. I've already dispatched him to investigate the identity of that youngster's older brother."</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor: "You have everything in hand?"</p>

    <p>"Lord Spirit Emperor, please rest assured, I am nothing like Bai Zhe that trash." President Dylan curled his lip. "I'll make sure that Ghost Head Blade captures that youngster's older brother alive within the next seven days."</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor was very satisfied with this answer. "Then I will wait for news, President Han Di."</p>
