  <h1>Chapter 233 The Old Devil's Dignity </h1>

  <div>

    <p>General Yi had specially prepared this long string of bras for this plan. When the bras were flung to the ground, the slight fluctuation of spirit energy generated would instantly link the one hundred instructors together... It could only be said that General Yi was in the end General Yi, and Wang Ling thought that even if he were to cultivate for another hundred years, he would never be able to follow this line of thinking.</p>

    <p>A minute later, the instructors on the top of each building in the small world received the signal at the same time. Led by Immortal Toya, they began to lock down the old devil's position and set up the Five Elements Great Array.</p>

    <p>"Coordinates locked!</p>

    <p>"Array confirmed!"</p>

    <p>"Spirit energy reserve confirmed!"</p>

    <p>"Activate the array!"</p>

    <p>Sitting on the top of a tall building as he instructed the one hundred instructors, Immortal Toya gave the command to start the array, and spirit energy came surging forth out of the instructors' palms like the kamehameha.</p>

    <p>These one hundred light rays swiftly condensed into a five-colored magic sphere above the confirmed coordinates. Then, this magic sphere started to slowly extend outward to form a massive six-pointed star array which covered the sky.</p>

    <p>It was truly a spectacular scene, like fireworks at night, and far more magnificent than the fireworks at the Xiao Family Compound.</p>

    <p>Students from the six schools all stopped in their tracks.</p>

    <p>What was wrong?</p>

    <p>Was the godly punishment circle coming?</p>

    <p>In a short moment, the panicked students all stopped fighting and retreated back into the buildings.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling paused as he followed General Yi.</p>

    <p>The Five Elements Great Array was something that people would have only read about in ancient books and never seen for themselves.</p>

    <p>It was a powerful array that had only been used one thousand years ago when the demon gods had invaded Earth from the Gate Between Worlds during that era. Because its restrictive force was tremendously strong and it consumed massive amounts of energy, only the Almightys could specially use this array in order to deal with the demon gods.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The instant the Five Elements Great Array was activated, the old devil had already felt the fluctuation from a distance, deep in the earth.</p>

    <p>Sure enough... he had fallen into a trap!</p>

    <p>Furthermore, he immediately realized that it was his old adversary who had set this trap for him.</p>

    <p>"Yi Jianchuan, I knew that you wouldn't let my venerable self go so easily..." The old devil looked in the direction of the sky and took a deep breath. He stared at the skeleton in front of him contemplatively. He should have realized earlier on that there was something wrong with it!</p>

    <p>"What's wrong, Lord Devil Emperor?" asked Jiang Liuyue from the stone ghost mask.</p>

    <p>"My venerable self has fallen into a trap. This skeleton of the Ancient Almighty is a fake, and the Body-Turning Array won't work on a fake at all." The old devil looked in the direction of the sky. "Worse, my venerable self can already sense the aura of the Five Elements Great Array... a net has already been laid out outside. With the Five Elements Great Array open, I can't escape, even with the Purple Gold Gourd."</p>

    <p>"Then what should we do now?" Jiang Liuyue had never ever anticipated that things would actually reach this point.</p>

    <p>"The only thing we can do now is fight." The old devil sighed, and taking the stone ghost mask with him, broke through the earth above them.</p>

    <p>He had already sensed two familiar auras slowly approaching him from afar.</p>

    <p>Although they hadn't seen each other for a thousand years, that was still a familiar aura...</p>

    <p>The old devil narrowed his eyes, and then abruptly realized that there was a problem.</p>

    <p>Wait...</p>

    <p>Why were there two familiar auras?</p>

    <p>One was Yi Jianchuan.</p>

    <p>The other...</p>

    <p>Then, the old devil saw an elder and a teenager appear in his line of sight as they slowly came toward him.</p>

    <p>"..." When the old devil saw the teenager, he straightaway broke out in a cold sweat.</p>

    <p>Someone please tell him, why would this "Killer Taoist" appear in a place like this? And why the hell was he wearing a school uniform?!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The five-colored ring of the Five Elements Great Array shrouded the earth in an endless haze. A layer of mist hung over the ground, which unexpectedly made the place look like a fairyland.</p>

    <p>Following General Yi, Wang Ling stood face to face with the old devil.</p>

    <p>General Yi kept Wang Ling behind him and covered him unnecessarily in a protective immortal light, which made him a little uncomfortable... this light wasn't even half as strong as the protective golden light of his Sage Body!</p>

    <p>Actually, when he had read about the past grudges between General Yi and the old devil in history books, Wang Ling had wondered what the scene would be like if these two, who had been old adversaries for over a thousand years, were to meet again one day?</p>

    <p>In the end, this collision wasn't as intense as he had imagined.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The Five Elements Great Array had been set up and the old devil knew that it was already impossible for him to escape. Given his current body, which had yet to reach its full strength, he wouldn't be able to match General Yi at all.</p>

    <p>And the most fearsome thing of all was that the junior who had thwarted his plans twice already was actually standing behind his old enemy...</p>

    <p>At that moment, the old devil felt a little despair.</p>

    <p>"This old man has always been curious about how you would take revenge on me after you returned to the world once more. I never thought that when I'd see you again, you would be in a woman's body..."</p>

    <p>General Yi looked languidly at the old devil. "How about you surrender now and come with me, since you don't have the slightest chance of winning?"</p>

    <p>The old devil gnashed his teeth and stared at the elder. "Old Yi, my venerable self wants to ask you! What is your relationship with that junior behind you?"</p>

    <p>"Him?" General Yi laughed, and standing on tiptoe, he floated up into the air and stretched out his hand to rub Wang Ling's head. "This is the person I want to take as my disciple. Don't you think his root bone's pretty good?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>The old devil: "...You want to take him as your disciple?"</p>

    <p>"That's right, he's so young but he's already at the Golden Core stage. With this talent, I'm really looking forward to the future growth of his realm." General Yi looked at Wang Ling and smiled benevolently.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>After hearing this, the old devil was speechless for a long time.</p>

    <p>Not long ago, when he had seen Wang Ling effortlessly stop that Immortal Mansion youngster's gold crescent, he had already reached a conclusion.</p>

    <p>This teenager's strength was unfathomable. Even if the old devil had been at his peak, his chances of winning would at the most be just fifty percent.</p>

    <p>So when he heard what General Yi said, the old devil deeply felt that this old enemy of his seemed to have fantastically misunderstood this "junior."</p>

    <p>The old devil took a deep breath and gave Wang Ling a look first before finally turning his eyes back to the old elder with the hedgehog head standing in front of the teenager. "...Old Yi, are you sure you won't reconsider?"</p>

    <p>Obviously, the elder was a little puzzled by this strange question. "What does it have to do with you who this old man wants to take as a disciple? Or... do you mean my disciple harm?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>The old devil didn't say anything. When his eyes quietly swept over Wang Ling, he saw Wang Ling take a few steps back â€” obviously, he didn't intend to intervene in their grudge match. In the end, the old devil just pressed his lips together and simply swallowed down everything that had happened with Wang Ling before.</p>

    <p>He sighed. Now with things as they were, he knew that saying anything more now would be useless.</p>

    <p>He knew that he had no chance of winning this fight.</p>

    <p>But as the Devil Emperor, he would still hold on to his dignity even in his final moments.</p>

    <p>Hands behind his back, the old devil stared at the elder with the hedgehog head in front of him and simply said, "Go ahead... this will be the last battle..."</p>
