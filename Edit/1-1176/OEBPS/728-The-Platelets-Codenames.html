  <h1>Chapter 728 The Platelets' Codenames</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In the fake remains, this humanoid blood-red monster that was tens of meters tall stood up unhurriedly from the ground, thick, dark red liquid dripping from it like lava.</p>

    <p>But this wasn't lava. To be exact, it was more like a syrupy substance; because the fatty's blood sugar level was so high, the humanoid platelet he had summoned was incredibly gooey. When this thick liquid dripped off the body to the ground, it immediately turned the earth into sludge.</p>

    <p>"Whatever it is, take it down!" A Huaxiu Alliance cultivator made a move as he flew on his sword and tried to attack this giant blood-red monster from behind.</p>

    <p>Instead, he was sent flying by a spray of sticky fluid from the monster.</p>

    <p>Aya!!</p>

    <p>The cultivator shrieked as he was smashed into the side of a mountain in the distance. Even though he only had a few bruises, he was completely trapped inside the mucus, which was extremely sweet!</p>

    <p>"What the hell is that?"</p>

    <p>On the other side, the Old Devil, Master of Immortal Mansion Cheng Yu, Evil Sword God, and General Bai had all noticed the monster, but had no idea what it was at all.</p>

    <p>"This is 7364! This is 7364!" Other Huaxiu Alliance cultivators starting calling HQ to find out what this monster was.</p>

    <p>In fact, in Huaxiu Alliance's command center, General Yi and the others were also alarmed by the sudden appearance of this giant blood-red monster in the fake remains.</p>

    <p>"Old Yi, what do you think?" President Qi stared at the image on the screen as his thoughts turned over and over in his mind.</p>

    <p>General Yi shook his head. "It's a little like a blood demon, but not really... The only thing we know for sure is that this thing was summoned. Chances are it'll disappear if we can defeat the summoner."</p>

    <p>President Qi folded his arms and narrowed his eyes</p>

    <p>"Can we analyze this substance?"</p>

    <p>These fake remains was a made-up small world completely controlled by Huaxiu Alliance, so they had a certain ability to analyze the materials in it.</p>

    <p>When President Qi said this, the staff members in the command center had already started to carry out the analysis.</p>

    <p>It was a quick process which only took a matter of seconds.</p>

    <p>Finally, the composition of this blood-red monster was tabulated and displayed on the screen.</p>

    <p>Since it had a human form, this monster's body was comprised of water, sugar, fat and so on, but there was one substance which took up seventy percent of its composition...</p>

    <p>"Platelets?"</p>

    <p>Many people were astonished by the report results.</p>

    <p>So, this was an awakened platelet?</p>

    <p>"What is the overall strength of this cerebral blood clot?" asked President Qi.</p>

    <p>The researchers were blank when they heard this - cerebral blood clot?</p>

    <p>It didn't seem to be an ailment...</p>

    <p>Such a huge lump couldn't be called a platelet at all!!</p>

    <p>"From the analysis, it has the overall strength of an Itinerant Immortal, and should be at level three," a staff member replied at that moment.</p>

    <p>"Level three Itinerant Immortal? It looks like this thing has a parent, and its strength is enhanced by radiation," President Qi immediately surmised.</p>

    <p>A normal summoned creature's realm of strength would never be so fierce, so there was only one possibility, and that was that this blood-red monster had a parent. The parent would continuously supply it with energy from behind, finally increasing this monster's overall strength. There was in fact a special term for this type of summoning situation: Maternal Radiation.</p>

    <p>"I recall a Western forbidden skill which was localized for our context: it's called the 'Cells At Work Spell.'" As Wisdom Saint, President Qi had already drawn a conclusion. "And there is a biologist on the list of Dark Network members whom Night Chief recruited, so everything makes sense now."</p>

    <p>General Yi frowned. "If it is as you say, Old Qi, then it's pointless simply defeating this monster."</p> 
    
    <p>"That's right."</p>

    <p>President Qi nodded and then said to the staff member next to the command platform, "Tell them they have to find the parent, or this blood-red monster will continue regenerating."</p>

    <p>Platelets were cells with a hemostatic effect to begin with, so the self-healing ability of this huge monster would naturally be first-class.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At that moment, the situation inside the fake remains wasn't good; after the appearance of this huge blood-red monster, several smaller ones rose up from the ground next to it. Although they weren't as large as this "Cerebral Blood Clot," they were still tens of meters tall.</p>

    <p>It looked like they were guarding something, with the tallest "Cerebral Blood Clot" monster in the center. Seven monsters stood in a line to form a human wall, their blood-red bodies rippling with extremely high sugar content.</p>

    <p>Their intentions were very clear, as if they were telling everyone...</p>

    <p>You shall not pass!</p>

    <p>General Bai narrowed his eyes at the seven monsters and instructed everyone, "Don't waste time on these monsters. We must find the summoner and the parent as soon as possible."</p>

    <p>Knowing that this was the Cells At Work Spell, General Bai straightaway knew that time was of the essence.</p>

    <p>These seven monsters were here just to buy time, and the real purpose had to be the summoning of the follow-up cells. If the white blood cells and macrophages were called out in human form, it would then become a really difficult situation to settle.</p>

    <p>Given their current numbers, they might not be able to withstand tens of thousands of monsters.</p>

    <p>Moreover, General Bai himself was severely restrained. If it truly reached the point where the only thing he could do was wipe out all the monsters in one go as Explosion Saint, he might blow up all of the fake remains with his current strength.</p>

    <p>But at that time, all these Huaxiu Alliance colleagues would also suffer...</p>

    <p>"I'll handle these seven monsters. Everyone, hurry up and find the summoner and the parent! They should be hiding underground!"</p>

    <p>Thinking this, General Bai clenched his teeth and soared into the air and dashed toward the biggest Cerebral Blood Clot.</p>

    <p>He spread his palm and a ball of energy shot out!</p>

    <p>Explosion, was an art!</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The head of the biggest "Cerebral Blood Clot" monster was completely blown off!</p>

    <p>But as President Qi had predicted, not long after the monster's head was blown off, the mucus of its body swiftly piled up on its neck and in the end formed a new head.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The largest monster, codenamed "Cerebral Blood Clot," had the strength of a level three Itinerant Immortal.</p>

    <p>The second biggest one was fifteen meters tall with the strength of a level two Itinerant Immortal. Unlike the other monsters, it was more yellowish in color and looked very oily, so this fifteen-meter platelet's codename was "Fatty Liver."</p>

    <p>The third one was twelve meters tall and a level one Itinerant Immortal. While it was smaller than the first two, its chest was extremely big, and it was codenamed "Heart Attack."</p>

    <p>Looking at this scene from afar, the Old Devil felt that these platelets were all abnormals<sup>1</sup>...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(In "Attack of Titans," these refer to the titans that display uncommon traits or behavior.)</dfn>

    <p>The remaining four weren't as big as the first three, only five meters to seven meters tall on average, but they had discernable facial features since they were "thinner." Two of them looked more terrible and sluggish, and were codenamed "Brainless and Unhappy<sup>2</sup>."</p>

    <p>Of the last two monsters, one had a big head and the other a small one.</p>
