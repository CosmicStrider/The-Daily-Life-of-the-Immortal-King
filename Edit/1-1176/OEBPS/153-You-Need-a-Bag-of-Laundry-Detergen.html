  <h1>Chapter 153 You Need a Bag of Laundry Detergen </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling called Lord Diulei over from Wenxian Garden to deliberate the matter of Song Qingshu's request for help.</p>

    <p>After receiving the message, Lord Diulei immediately sped over on Sheep. It took him less than five minutes to reach the Wang family's main entrance.</p>

    <p>After Lord Diulei had taken Sheep back with him, he had entrusted the tricycle to a brother who specialized in magic artifacts to repair it. After hearing that Wang Ling was looking for him that night, he had taken the opportunity to bring the tricycle with him.</p>

    <p>At the gate, he saw that the front door of the Wang family's small villa was slightly ajar; Wang Ling had used air pressure to crack it open.</p>

    <p>What Song Qingshu then saw was this Great Death-Courting Senior and a pink-haired lolita in a pair of blue lace suspender shorts and wearing a little gray coat enter the house. The lolita looked like she was only six years old with meatball-shaped buns on her head. She blinked as she looked around.</p>

    <p>Noticing that Lord Diulei was holding the lolita by the hand, Song Qingshu's heart couldn't help jumping... he had never heard that this Great Death-Courting Senior had a daughter, so where had this lolita come from?</p>

    <p>After coming in, Lord Diulei immediately saw that Grandfather Wang was binge-watching Old Driver, Please Give Me a Ride , which was the hottest show on at the moment. He didn't dare disturb the old man, but at this moment, he had already secretly decided that when he returned home today, he would watch this TV series from beginning to end... maybe he could gain some enlightenment from it!</p>

    <p>Mm... there was a reason for every move that great senior made!</p>

    <p>Leading Sheep to Wang Ling by the hand, Lord Diulei was straightaway dumbstruck when he saw Wang Ling's pajamas: Damn, Brother Ling, aren't you a little cute today?!</p>

    <p>Following that, he clasped his fists in salute and said to Wang Ling in his big white bunny pajamas, "Brother Ling, I bring Sheep back to you..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at the lolita and raised his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei rubbed the lolita's head. "Brother Ling, are you relieved now?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling cupped his chin and nodded. This already wasn't the first time that Sheep had transformed, but in her previous transformations, her clothes and accessories had really been too tragic a sight because of the rust and flaking paint on the tricycle. It was certainly much better now after the maintenance!</p>

    <p>Sheep pointed at Lord Diulei, her face full of excitement. "This uncle asked someone to help paint, wax and grease me! It felt really nice!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>"..." Somehow, Wang Ling felt that her remark sounded a little dodgy!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After listening to Song Qingshu explain the whole story, Lord Diulei looked at him and laughed. "It turns out that you were the one who sent that bunch of people to fight us for the stone ghost mask back then. Now that you've been abandoned and reduced to being hunted down, you've come to us for help? If you knew today would happen, why did you do all that at the beginning?"</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu sighed with a deeply bitter and resentful expression on his face. "Given the current situation, I have no other option. I can only turn to both seniors for help. If both seniors can help me, I can help you get what you want..."</p>

    <p>"Let's hear it first then." Lord Diulei leaned back against the sofa, drawing Sheep down to hug her from behind. Sheep wriggled and wrenched herself free in disgust.</p>

    <p>Staring at Wang Ling and Lord Diulei, Song Qingshu said, "I know that seniors have been looking for information on the maker of the stone ghost mask..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Wang Ling and Lord Diulei's eyes lit up. "You have a lead?"</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu nodded solemnly. "Yes!" The head of Green Gang, Zhou Jie, had given him this piece of news, and it was over ninety percent reliable.</p>

    <p>Actually, Song Qingshu knew he didn't have any sort of bargaining chip at all. Cultivators nowadays could use plenty of ways to extract memories, and given the strength of these two, it would take them no effort at all to read his memories.</p>

    <p>But he was not stupid... long before he had come to the Wang family's villa, he had magically locked down this particular memory. If the spell was broken forcefully, the memory would disappear altogether. He was well aware that this was his only bargaining chip. Even then, he still wasn't sure if Wang Ling had other ways of prying into his memories.</p>

    <p>After all, this was the great senior capable of transforming a pair of long johns so that it could kill a Soul Formation cultivator by backlash!</p>

    <p>"Smart of you to use a spell to lock down your own memory." Lord Diulei's pupils flickered with light as he looked at Song Qingshu. This was the Heavenly Eye at the Soul Formation stage. Although it was far less strong than Wang Ling's, it wasn't difficult to pick out clues.</p>

    <p>But very quickly, Lord Diulei frowned when he discovered a black blotch on Song Qingshu's soul. He was shocked. "Soul brand?" He had seen many soul brands before, and the more sinister the brand, the darker its color. For example, Song Qingshu's soul brand was so black it had fucking turned into black fungus!</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu dropped his head and sighed. "Anyone who works at Mo Immortal Castle has their soul branded by the Lord of the Castle like this..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei cupped his chin, lost in thought. There were many ways to get rid of a soul brand. However, Song Qingshu's soul brand was too deeply entrenched, and would be hard to get rid of via general means. This brand tied to Song Qingshu's soul was now like a ticking time bomb. Not only was there a risk of it exposing his position, the person in question was also extremely vulnerable to long-range curses.</p>

    <p>"Does Brother Ling have any way to wash off this soul brand?" Lord Diulei asked with a frown.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded, then stood up and went to the bathroom on the first floor of the Wang family's small villa. He then took out a red-colored bag from a cupboard.</p>

    <p>On the side, Lord Diulei and Song Qingshu who saw this familiar bag were both dumbfounded. "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "...Brother Ling, what's this?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling pulled the bag open.</p>

    <p>Inside it, pure white granules emanated a golden light, and the scent of honey locust suffused the air.</p>

    <p>This was a bag of OMO laundry detergent which Wang Ling had already blessed...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, a woman approached the Wang family's small villa outside. She was dressed in a cheongsam and a pair of red heels.</p>

    <p>She had followed Song Qingshu's soul brand and tracked it down here.</p>

    <p>"This is the place... did you think the Lord wouldn't know that you were hiding here?" The woman sneered as she had already smelled Song Qingshu's scent.</p>

    <p>"Song Qingshu, come out and face death! On orders from the Lady of the Castle, I have come to take revenge for Ah Zuo!" The woman had yet to make a move, but her deafening and wrathful voice went straight to the heart.</p>

    <p>But most unfortunately, this shout didn't get any reply at all...</p>

    <p>"Damn it! Song Qingshu, if you'd rather be a tortoise and hide in your shell, this old mother is going to break in! I swear I'll kill everyone in this villa!" The woman in the red cheongsam flew into a rage.</p>

    <p>Just as she was about to take the next step and launch an attack on the villa, the front door of the Wang family's small villa opened...</p>

    <p>A teenager in big white bunny pajamas slowly came out...</p>
