  <h1>Chapter 226 Déjà Vu Act </h1>

  <div>

    <p>After Wang Ling closed the door of the Gate Between Worlds, the scene was tranquil once more.</p>

    <p>According to records of the last few times that the Gate Between Worlds had descended, once it was completely open, a storm of demon aura would come lashing out in a frenzy and erode the entire city, creating various kinds of abnormal natural disasters.</p>

    <p>But this wasn't the grand scene that was happening now at all...</p>

    <p>Apart from the unusual fluctuations of the light of chaos caused by the door's descent, there was no longer any sign of any other abnormal phenomena. Wang Ling had shut the door too quickly; no sooner had the Gate Between Worlds been cracked open than it had been decisively closed with a " <em>boom</em> "... Wang Ming had even seen faint spiderweb cracks in the door frame, which was enough to demonstrate the force of Wang Ling's strength when he had closed the door.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was slack-jawed and stupefied at this scene.</p>

    <p>This giant door had been closed with one hand...</p>

    <p>This was enough to prove that the explosive power in just one of Wang Ling's arms was at least a billion <em>jin</em> ...</p>

    <p>This type of power once again refreshed Wang Ming's understanding of Wang Ling's upper limits.</p>

    <p>He had never thought that Wang Ling would be able to release this type of power with the Dao talisman seal on. God knew that this Dao talisman seal really was the only thing helping Wang Ling to better control his power and moderate his aura.</p>

    <p>When he thought this, Wang Ming couldn't help breaking out in a cold sweat.</p>

    <p>He truly couldn't imagine how terrifying it would be if Wang Ling removed the Dao talisman seal!</p>

    <p>"So... the Gate Between Worlds is shut then?"</p>

    <p>With Chen Chao on his back, Wang Ming stared blankly at the huge door in front of him and blinked.</p>

    <p>It really had been shut too quickly...</p>

    <p>He felt that even if the radar signal on their side hadn't been blocked, the broadcast in the conference room outside wouldn't have been able to switch to this scene in time at all.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, he felt that he could already picture the twisted, "ate shit" expression on the face of that demon king inside the Gate Between Worlds.</p>

    <p>That arm was incredibly thick and solid, and was as long as two or three adults lined up from head to toe. It bulged with blue veins, as if several <em>qiulong</em> were twined around it. Just from the size of the arm, Wang Ming thought that the demon king behind the door had to have been at least twenty-odd meters tall.</p>

    <p>Six years ago, it was the first time that the demon army had ever collectively retreated.</p>

    <p>It was obvious that this demon king had had to muster up its courage before stretching its arm out.</p>

    <p>Its heart had been full of delight for the future revival of the demon race; full of excitement for the realization of the demon race's dream of glorious conquest; full of anticipation of the human cultivators' terror when the demon race descended upon them...</p>

    <p>In the end, it had barely stretched out its hand...</p>

    <p>When it was fucking cut off.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>A few seconds before the Gate Between Worlds had descended, Er Ha had actually already been nearby.</p>

    <p>It had then seen that familiar light of chaos pouring out of the Gate Between Worlds.</p>

    <p>But it hadn't felt the slightest bit of fear, since it had come out of that door itself six years ago.</p>

    <p>It was just that its ending had been a little tragic.</p>

    <p>As soon as it had come out, ten-year-old Wang Ling had punched right through its abdomen, scaring off the demon army behind it into withdrawing straightaway.</p>

    <p>This time, when it had seen the Gate Between Worlds descend once again, the first thing it had felt was that it was familiar and strange at the same time.</p>

    <p>This was the small world which General Yi had specially created for the students participating in this survival contest. Logically speaking, the Gate Between Worlds, this dangerous thing, shouldn't be here at all.</p>

    <p>So when it had seen the Gate Between Worlds, Er Ha had instantly had the thought that someone had summoned the door here!</p>

    <p>But who would have the guts or the strength to manipulate the Gate Between Worlds and communicate with the demon race inside?</p>

    <p>Er Ha hadn't been able to think of a logical answer at all.</p>

    <p>It was at that very moment that it had seen the Gate Between Worlds open from a distance and a thick, purple demon claw stretch out through the opening.</p>

    <p>Er Ha had widened its eyes. "This is... the troll clan?"</p>

    <p>With one glance, it had almost immediately recognized this demon claw. Every demon had a demon talisman in its body which corresponded to its clan and identity. Er Ha was absolutely sure that this was a troll's demon claw, and from the size of the emerging arm alone, this had to be a demon king troll chief!</p>

    <p>In the demon race's top one hundred ranking, the Tuntian Ha clan was ranked twenty-eighth, which was above average among all the demon clans, but the troll clan was the real ace of the demon race, and was in the top ten! A troll elder's prowess was already on par with Er Ha's true strength at its peak; what was more, this was a chief at the level of a demon king?</p>

    <p>What to do? Advance?</p>

    <p>One inch...</p>

    <p>Yet another inch...</p>

    <p>Er Ha saw that the purple claw had already stretched through the open crack of the door, and at last, a whole arm pushed through.</p>

    <p>"It's coming out!"</p>

    <p>The instant it had seen that arm, Er Ha had straightaway tensed up.</p>

    <p>Back then, Wang Ling had only used a single punch to kill it.</p>

    <p>But when all was said and done, this was a demon clan ranked in the top ten, and also a troll clan chief. Given that Wang Ling currently had the Dao talisman seal stuck on him, Er Ha felt that the outcome would be very hard to predict.</p>

    <p>It had thought that it might be able to mediate the situation, but it had also felt that this troll chief absolutely wouldn't listen to it.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Er Ha's heart had been very anxious.</p>

    <p>However, it had just been for that moment.</p>

    <p>It had watched Wang Ling walk step by step toward the Gate Between Worlds.</p>

    <p>With one push from his hand, the Gate shut with a boom...</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>And then, nothing...</p>

    <p>Er Ha saw that giant troll arm cut off just like that, and it fell from the air and crashed onto the ground...</p>

    <p>This scene gave it a slight sense of déjà vu.</p>

    <p>Er Ha had never ever thought that after six years, the demon race's invasion would unexpectedly fail once again.</p>

    <p>What was more, the situation was even more bitter this time. At least the last time, several demons had succeeded in infiltrating Earth during the invasion.</p>

    <p>This time, before it could even step through, Wang Ling had ruthlessly locked the demon out.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>A hundred years later, on top of a cliff in the Gate Between Worlds.</p>

    <p>This was the troll clan's ancestral land. An old, one-armed troll enjoyed the breeze while he sat on top of the cliff, cradling his grandson. His temples were gray and his long white hair hung down to puddle in a heap next to him.</p>

    <p>The old troll was already getting along in years. He had withdrawn from his high position to start his life of retirement. Nowadays, he had whole lines of descendants. The grandson he was holding now was already two hundred years old, but only four meters tall. For the long-lived trolls, this was still a little kid...</p>

    <p>The breeze blew over the cliff, and the grandson who had been sleeping deeply in the old troll's embrace woke up. He rubbed his eyes and stared at his grandfather. "Grandpa, grandpa, your arm, how did you lose it?"</p>

    <p>One-armed old troll: "Why do you always ask me this question every day..."</p>

    <p>Every day, as soon as his grandson woke up, he would ask the same question. He was about to go insane!</p>

    <p>Little troll: "Because I'm really curious! But grandpa never answers me!"</p>

    <p>The old troll looked at his grandson and said quietly, "Do you really want to know?"</p>

    <p>The little troll nodded like a chicken pecking at rice. "I bet it was definitely when grandpa was fighting on the frontline in a fierce battle, and it was cut off by the enemy, right? I want to hear grandpa's story!"</p>

    <p>The old troll shook his head. "No..."</p>

    <p>Little troll: "Was it cut off when you were protecting grandma from a love rival?"</p>

    <p>The old troll was silent for a while, and in the end decided to tell the truth. "You might not believe it, but grandpa's hand was cut off by a door."</p>

    <p>Little troll: "..."</p>
