  <h1>Chapter 448 Gathering of Bigwigs in Songhai Prison </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Cultivated a Heavenly Dao...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi and Zhong Lang were stupefied.</p>

    <p>Although they were only at the Golden Core stage, that didn't mean that they didn't know what a 'Heavenly Dao' implied.</p>

    <p>It was something which pertained to the principles of Taoism and which a person could touch only after reaching True Immortal level. Even for many Soul Formation cultivators it was a very distant thing, what more for the two of them.</p>

    <p>Gazing at the young man lying on the ground, Zhuo Yi then looked around and realized that his <em>shifu </em>Wang Ling wasn't there.</p>

    <p>However, it was indeed <em>shifu </em>who had sent him the coordinates of this location earlier.</p>

    <p>So Zhuo Yi made a quick deduction.</p>

    <p>According to what Lord Diulei had said before, if this young man was a True Immortal big shot and had cultivated a Heavenly Dao, there was no way Lord Diulei could have dealt with him given his current strength. Thus, it was very likely that it was <em>shifu </em>who had defeated the young man and left this place, leaving Lord Diulei behind to coordinate the aftermath...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi knew that his <em>shifu </em>was a man who liked to keep a low profile, so every time he cleaned up some evil force, he would immediately call Zhuo Yi to deal with the aftermath and then push all the credit onto him.</p>

    <p>But here was the problem now...</p>

    <p>This was a True Immortal big shot. Even if he, Zhong Lang and Lord Diulei had run into this type of big shot cultivator together, wouldn't they all be killed with just one slap?!</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi looked at the young man on the ground and had a slight headache.</p>

    <p>Hm...</p>

    <p>He really couldn't carry this wok <sup>1</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A reminder that 'to carry a wok on the back' is to take the fall or be a scapegoat for something..)</dfn>

    <p>If he was going to shoulder this wok, then he should do it in a scientific way...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi remembered when the Master of Immortal Mansion had been arrested previously. Although the other party was an Itinerant Immortal, it was fortunate that a lot of top experts from the chat group had joined forces to surround and defeat him. Although their strength did appear to be on different levels, at least it wasn't too conspicuous a gap.</p>

    <p>But now, a True Immortal big shot had been defeated just like that. To be beaten solely through the joint efforts of the three people present... This reason might not be convincing enough.</p>

    <p>"Brother Zhuo, what are you worried about?" Zhong Lang asked.</p>

    <p>"I was thinking that it indeed wouldn't be appropriate for our involvement in this matter to be made public," Zhuo Yi said with his chin in his hand. "Hm... Little Zhong, contact Warden Liang for me and have him deal with this."</p>

    <p>Zhong Lang nodded obediently. "Very well, Brother Zhuo!"</p>

    <p>"Brother Zhuo Yi, to be able to arrest such a vicious criminal can be considered an unparalleled achievement. Why would you push it onto someone else?" Lord Diulei smiled.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi sighed. "This wok is too heavy..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>In fact, to put it bluntly, the issue was the difference in realms.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was actually a pretty self-aware person. There were some things he could take credit for, but some he couldn't. The moment he was half as strong as <em>shifu </em>, he would put that wok down... But for now, he still felt he was weak.</p>

    <p>"But by the way, Senior Immortal, I don't sense any spirit energy from this person. Is he really that strong?" Zhuo Yi asked.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Brother Zhuo Yi, there's nothing to worry about. This man's spirit has been sealed, and he is now no different to a regular person. You can arrest him without worry, but if you're really uneasy, you can apply to your higher-ups to use Spirit Shackles. In addition, I suggest it would be best for you to get in touch with General Yi about this incident."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi nodded. "I'll do as Senior Immortal says!"</p>

    <p>After all, this involved the Ten Founding Generals, so he had to be cautiously prudent.</p>

    <p>"But Senior Immortal, come to think of it... who exactly is this person?"</p>

    <p>"Ten-Meter Sword God, Chen Nanxuan. He calls himself Evil Sword God."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi and Zhong Lang had enlightened expressions on their faces. "Is that right..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was very surprised. "Have you heard of him?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "No..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Actually, it made sense that they didn't know Evil Sword God.</p>

    <p>After all, it had been a very long time ago, and furthermore, Evil Sword God's identity was directly related to General Yi.</p>

    <p>Therefore, although the higher-ups had dispatched people all this time to secretly look for traces of Evil Sword God, whatever news that might have been leaked by the media as well as news reports related to Evil Sword God back then had all been frozen.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei believed that if he went to the library now, that newspaper that had published Evil Sword God's deeds would definitely no longer be there.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi and Zhong Lang were very young, so it was in fact normal for them not to know him.</p>

    <p>Moreover, Lord Diulei felt that even if Evil Sword God was brought up in the chat group, not many people would be able to say much about him. Had it not been for Daoist Guang's personal clash with Evil Sword God back then, the only clue Lord Diulei was able to obtain on him would have been limited to just that newspaper.</p>

    <p>However, after today's incident, Lord Diulei was starting to gain a new understanding on the gap between realms.</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God was really too ferocious. If Daoist Guang hadn't been a True Immortal at the time, he might not have been able to escape his death.</p>

    <p>By the time Warden Liang arrived, it was already close to ten o'clock.</p>

    <p>After that, Lord Diulei and Zhuo Yi were busy handling the incident with Evil Sword God until after midnight.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Songhai First Prison.</p>

    <p>Warden Liang sent Evil Sword God there that very night. That was because after his spirit had been sealed off by the "World-Annihilating Sword," Evil Sword God had been unconscious since then.</p>

    <p>Warden Liang straightaway put him in Spirit Shackles and sent him to the special prison cell.</p>

    <p>After the cell door opened, two prison guards carried Evil Sword God inside. Following behind them, Warden Liang couldn't help sighing in his heart. It had barely been a few short months and this was already the third one...</p>

    <p>He looked at Devil Emperor Gua Pi and the Master of Immortal Mansion Cheng Yu, who were sitting in meditation...</p>

    <p>Hm, they had caught a <em>fatan <sup>2</sup> </em>, and then a marksman, and now this newly arrested warrior... Damn! Their battle team lineup was almost complete!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(A reminder that this is the
Chinese term used for game
characters strong enough to
resist any damage to
themselves ..)</dfn>

    <p>Warden Liang thought he could probably apply for funding assistance to expand the special prison cell.</p>

    <p>The old devil and Cheng Yu, the Master of Immortal Mansion, were still in the trial period. While it looked as if it had been a long time since they were captured, it actually hadn't been two months since both of them had gone to prison one after another. They had yet to be fully rehabilitated, and already a new prisoner had arrived.</p>

    <p>"Old Liang, who is this person?" The old devil looked up and sneered when he saw that a new person had been brought in again.</p>

    <p>He was still using Jiang Liuyue's body. When he spoke, his old voice coming out of that body was jarring.</p>

    <p>But that couldn't be helped since the old devil was wearing Spirit Shackles, and with his spirit sealed, it was impossible to swap the bodies back.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, the higher authorities were afraid something might happen if the seal was lifted and the old devil was placed in an artificially made body, so he had to put up with this for now; as for the Master of Shadow Stream, Jiang Liuyue, her soul had already been transferred from the stone ghost mask to an artificial body, and she would also be placed inside this special cell very soon.</p>

    <p>This battle team lineup would have an assassin right away...</p>

    <p>"No comment for the time being... But I advise you not to provoke him." Warden Liang raised his hand and had Evil Sword God placed on a vacant bunk.</p>

    <p>"You two, behave yourselves!"</p>

    <p>Then he left with the prison guards, and the cell door slammed tightly shut with a loud bang.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Two minutes later...</p>

    <p>Cheng Yu raised his head and looked at the old devil next to him. "What do you say, Devil Emperor?"</p>

    <p>The old devil chuckled. "Of course wake him up..."</p>

    <p>Initiation was an essential part of the process for every "newbie" that entered prison.</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God was still unconscious when two figures approached him from both sides in the special cell.</p>

    <p>Then, two crisp " <em>pa pa </em>" sounds could be heard.</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God was slapped twice once again...</p>
