  <h1>Chapter 119 Senior Second Saint, Are You Alright?! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>There were different types of backlash. In the science section of the <em>Cultivation Encyclopaedia </em>, the injuries accrued from backlash were divided into five general grades.</p>

    <p>To Song Qingshu, it looked like the goateed elderly Taoist had suffered fourth-degree backlash. The spiritual pressure which had recoiled on him had rampaged through his body with no release outlet. In addition, the goateed elderly Taoist had circulated his own spirit energy in an effort to fight it, which had had the effect of driving the spiritual energy up into his head, thus causing it to swell.</p>

    <p>If his condition wasn't treated in time, it was very likely that he would wind up in a coma and become a vegetable.</p>

    <p>No matter how shallow Song Qingshu's experiences were when compared with Soul Formation cultivators, he was still a Nascent Soul cultivator. He might appear to be a naive fool in front of this bunch, but he could still tell that the goateed elderly Taoist had sustained a backlash injury! The build-up of spiritual pressure from the Heaven and Earth Spirit Awakening Array had bounced back; moreover, the only person it had hurt was the main coordinator of this array.</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu was aghast. <em>My god... </em>it had actually bounced back.</p>

    <p>Who on earth was that youngster inside the villa?</p>

    <p>Before he could recover from his shock, the goateed elderly Taoist had already passed out in the back of the car, foaming at the mouth and mumbling incoherently.</p>

    <p>"Shit! It's backlash from spiritual pressure! Quick... what grade is it?"</p>

    <p>As the others surrounded the elderly Taoist, the light of the Heaven and Earth Spiritual Awakening Array under them began to dim rapidly and then shut down.</p>

    <p>Second Saint frowned; using his spiritual senses to check, he was stunned. "Not good! It's a stage four injury!"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, the other eight saints dropped their heads lifelessly with pained expressions on their faces.</p>

    <p>They were well aware what stage four meant.</p>

    <p>Although it wouldn't result in death, the possibility that he could turn into a vegetable was as high as ninety percent. Even if he could come back to himself, his cultivation would be diminished! Worse still, it was very likely that he wouldn't be able to cultivate ever again in his lifetime!</p>

    <p>For a cultivator who was used to having a formidable realm, to become a cripple unable to cultivate any longer was a fate worse than death.</p>

    <p>In the prominently quiet car, after a long period of silence, howls of grief suddenly burst out. Who could have ever expected that such an easy assignment would destroy the Ten Saints' brand?</p>

    <p>Senior and junior brothers held onto the goateed elderly Taoist's legs as they started to weep bitterly. "Elder brother! Elder brother, wake up!"</p>

    <p>"Elder brother, you were just one step away from becoming the king in <em>King of Glory </em>!"</p>

    <p>Second Saint hugged the goateed elderly Taoist by his shoulders and squeezed his wrinkled hand. "Elder brother! We brothers will pull together! You must hang in there! Please remain strong and stay alive!"</p>

    <p>And then, the goateed elderly Taoist weakly narrowed his eyes and raised his hand with a lot of effort. "I... I'm not dead yet... if each of you... give me a portion of your cultivation... I think I can still survive..."</p>

    <p>In the front of the limousine, Song Qingshu and his subordinate were choked with emotion when they saw this.</p>

    <p>This scene of brothers working as one in the face of disaster was just too moving!</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu had always been an easy crier.</p>

    <p>Just as his tears were about to fall, Second Saint embraced the goateed elderly Taoist and stretched out his hand...</p>

    <p>He slowly lay it on his neck...</p>

    <p>And then.</p>

    <p>Second Saint straightaway strangled him to death...</p>

    <p>"!!!"</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu and the man in a suit were stupefied.</p>

    <p>"Senior Second Saint, this..."</p>

    <p>Second Saint shook his head sorrowfully. "I'm saving elder brother from a wretched fate; even if we save him now... he was bound to become a cripple in the future."</p>

    <p>"But Senior Great Saint said that as long as each of you gave him a portion of your cultivation..."</p>

    <p>Second Saint: "Director Song, will you believe the nonsense a man spouts on his deathbed?"</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu looked at the monitor screen. Before this Great Saint had died, he had been staring wide-eyed at his own junior second brother. He had completely never expected that in the end, it would be his own fellow brother who would send him to hell.</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu was speechless for a very long time. "..." It was fucking obvious that the elderly Taoist had died with a grudge!</p>

    <p>This should have been a moving performance of fellow brothers pulling together in the face of calamity, but instead it had turned into a miserable dog-eat-dog drama about internal rivalry.</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu's head was hurting; he already had utterly no idea how to write his final report.</p>

    <p>"Elder brother, rest in peace..."</p>

    <p>Second Saint stretched out his hand and closed the goateed elderly Taoist's eyes. "Don't worry, I'll definitely take revenge for you!"</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu: "..." <em>You were the one who fucking strangled him to death, hey!</em></p>

    <p>On the side, their fellow brothers were still weeping piteously. "Second brother, don't blame yourself. If elder brother's spirit is looking down on us from heaven, he would definitely understand!"</p>

    <p>Second Saint's hands curled into fists and he got to his feet, his cyan-colored Taoist cloak fluttering as it was caught up in a burst of spiritual pressure. "Fellow brothers! Elder brother is gone, but our grief will not stop us from taking revenge!"</p>

    <p>As he said this, his fellow brothers around him burst out in enthusiastic clapping, some of them moved to tears again.</p>

    <p>Finally, Third Saint regained his composure and spoke on behalf of the others. "From when we were first formed until now, we Ten Saints have never been this desolate. Now that elder brother is gone, we should all listen to second brother!"</p>

    <p>"Understood!"</p>

    <p>Second Saint nodded. He then recited a spell, and a purple light glowed in his hand.</p>

    <p>In a matter of seconds, there was a reaction from the deceased goateed elderly Taoist's storage bag, and a thick and powerful Buddhist staff flew out and into Second Saint's hand. When he struck it once on the ground, terrifying spiritual pressure surged up around them!</p>

    <p>The overwhelming aura of the Demonic Path enveloped the scene, instantly making it hard to breathe.</p>

    <p>The rest of the eight saints all had stunned expressions on their faces as they cried out in alarm. "The Night Demon's Weapon!"</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu gazed at the monitor screen, his heart overwhelmed with shock... because this Night Demon's Weapon was a magic weapon that had been personally crafted by Immortal She Pi! But it was so evil that Immortal She Pi had had to personally seal it away!</p>

    <p>This was a first-class immortal weapon. It wasn't just exceedingly powerful, it also had a special ability â€” when each of its subsequent masters died, it would swallow up their souls, which would enhance the power of the Demonic Path! This could happen up to ten times, hence this staff possessed power beyond that of other immortal weapons.</p>

    <p>"Back then, when <em>shizun </em><sup>1</sup> found this Night Demon's Weapon, he gave it to elder brother at the time of his death! Now that elder brother is gone, his soul has been absorbed by this weapon! Today, I am the third master of this weapon, and I will take revenge for elder brother! No matter who that youngster is, today I am going to cut off his head and water elder brother's grave with his blood!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>('Shizun' is one rank higher
than 'shifu,' and can be
interpreted to be shifu's
master ..)</dfn>

    <p>After saying this, Second Saint raised the Buddhist staff and shouted, "Ghost, come!"</p>

    <p>He struck the ground with the staff again and again, and a cyan-colored Ghost General that would have been invisible to an ordinary person rapidly took shape in the air. The general had fangs as thick and solid as an elephant's tusks, and when it stood up, it was four meters tall!</p>

    <p>In the front of the limo, Song Qingshu and the man in a suit next to him shuddered from head to toe and felt like they had been sapped of their strength. It felt like they had been pinned to a bed by demonic pressure.</p>

    <p>Second Saint then pointed the Buddhist staff at the villa as his spiritual senses locked directly onto its location.</p>

    <p>The Ghost General immediately bared its fangs and lunged ferociously in the direction of the villa!</p>

    <p>Though its body was massive, it was incredibly fast!</p>

    <p>The ground sank, and flowers and grass instantly wilted in its path.</p>

    <p>Inside the car, Song Qingshu and the nine saints had their eyes fixed on it.</p>

    <p>But very quickly, something shocking happened...</p>

    <p>The Ghost General that had been streaking toward Lord Diulei's villa had actually retreated halfway...</p>

    <p>And unlike its savage expression when it had first flew out, there was now a clearly terrified expression on its face!</p>

    <p>As if it had encountered some prehistoric monster, it was so frightened that it fled back into the Night Demon's Weapon without even saying a single thing!</p>

    <p>Nobody had expected the Ghost General to actually turn back before even a fraction of the power of the Demonic Path could be unleashed.</p>

    <p>The immense power of the Demonic Path lashed about inside the Night Demon's Weapon, and Second Saint jerked spasmodically as if he had been electrocuted.</p>

    <p>He gritted his teeth, his expression one of agony.</p>

    <p>By the time everyone reacted, they realized that the fingers on Second Saint's right hand, which had been holding the Buddhist staff, had already broken into pieces from the powerful jolts of the staff, and his entire hand was bleeding freely.</p>

    <p>As the Night Demon's Weapon dropped to the ground with a clatter, everyone saw Second Saint's head grow bigger and bigger...</p>

    <p>In front of the monitor screen, Song Qingshu was alarmed. "Senior Second Saint, are you alright?"</p>

    <p>Second Saint looked at his fingerless right hand. "I'm cosplaying Doraemon! Don't make a fuss if you don't understand!"</p>

    <p>As soon as he said this, he coughed up a mouthful of blood.</p>

    <p>With great difficulty, Second Saint resisted the battering of the Demonic Path's power inside his body. But just when this second brother leader had succeeded, his head was already the size of four watermelons. "...Previously, elder brother's Blood Shadow Magic Skill hadn't been performed all the way through, let me perform it for you again!"</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu: "..."</p>

    <p><em>Who the fuck will believe you!</em></p>
