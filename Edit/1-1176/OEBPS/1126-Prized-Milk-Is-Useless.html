  <h1>Chapter 1126 Prized Milk Is Useless</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Tomorrow was Friday, which was when Number 60 High would be headed to Jinghua city. After school, the students of the special training class gathered and discussed whether they should go out and eat together.</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen was in favor of this suggestion. The national physical body technique competition wasn't a solo event, and eating together was a good opportunity for them to communicate and get closer to each other.</p>

    <p>Things had been tense between Xia Ming and Wang Ling a few days ago, and Headmaster Chen felt that this might be a ticking time bomb.</p>

    <p>"It'll be my treat, everyone go out and eat," said Headmaster Chen.</p>

    <p>Frankly speaking, everyone was surprised by his generosity.</p>

    <p>"Huh? Headmaster, are you also coming with us?"</p>

    <p>"No." Headmaster Chen hurriedly shook his head; an old man going along with a bunch of young people certainly wasn't very good. They didn't have any topics in common, and conversation might be cut off by the generation gap. If he went with them, they might not be able to enjoy their food as much.</p>

    <p>"Will three thousand yuan be enough for the ten<sup>1</sup> of you?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Just an FYI that the author gave eleven names instead of ten.)</dfn>

    <p>"Wow... Headmaster, that's a lot!"</p>

    <p>"Next week will be very difficult for you. This amount isn't much for me."</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen took out some cash from his pocket and handed them to Sun Rong. "Student Sun Rong will take care of it. I only have two requests: Firstly, find a clean restaurant and don't get sick. Secondly, go home early when you're done."</p>

    <p>"Thank you, headmaster!" Everyone thanked him.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong politely accepted the three thousand yuan from the headmaster and also sighed in relief. Eating together was good, of course, but she sometimes actually offended a lot of people because of it.</p>

    <p>After all, she was the eldest daughter of Huaguo Water Curtain Group. Every time she arranged to eat with her friends, it was always especially lavish, and this sort of upper-class behavior naturally attracted envy.</p>

    <p>To use a popular modern phrase, it could be summarized as: a lemon person.</p>

    <p>After all, their family backgrounds were different. Sun Rong had been used to an upper-class lifestyle since young; up until high school, she never thought that there was anything wrong with it. She never had any intention of hurting anyone's feelings. Her family was just that rich! Could she be blamed for that?</p>

    <p>But then she met Wang Ling during the school's entrance exam...</p>

    <p>After being classmates with Wang Ling for a semester, she felt that she had actually learned a lot from him.</p>

    <p>Being low-key wasn't a bad thing. Before high school, she had intended to draw attention and win the hearts of everyone in the entire school to make herself the brightest star.</p>

    <p>Her thinking had now changed slightly - to be an unassuming young miss didn't seem like a bad thing...</p>

    <p>This three thousand yuan from Headmaster Chen could be considered very timely; if the ten of them went out to dine, Sun Rong's bodyguards would probably rush to pay the bill.</p>

    <p>What would her classmates think when they saw that? Wasn't that clearly showing off? Classmate Wang Ling definitely wouldn't like it...</p>

    <p>"What should we eat?" Sun Rong carefully put the three thousand yuan down on the desk and looked prepared to have a serious discussion.</p>

    <p>It wasn't that she was being modest, but that she really didn't have any ideas. For the sake of maintaining her figure, she didn't usually eat dinner, so she didn't have any idea at all what food to recommend.</p>

    <p>This was already the 1346th night in a row that she would be eating a fasting energy pill...</p>

    <p>"There's a soup restaurant on Yellow Springs Road that's pretty good. Shall we try it out? It's popular online!" said Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>"Yellow Springs Road... That's so ominous. Does it sell Old Woman Meng's soup<sup>2</sup>?" Guo Hao curled his lip. "Forget it. We should have a little more faith. No one can clearly explain the mysteries of the universe. There's too much poisonous milk nowadays..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Yellow Springs is a literal translation of Huangquan, which refers to the underworld. Before the dead cross the bridge to the underworld, they drink Old Woman Meng's soup to erase their memories of their past lives before they can enter the cycle of reincarnation.)</dfn>

    <p>After that, every single person looked at Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "Why're you looking at me? It's just Yellow Springs Road, and it's just drinking soup. I was thinking about the girls in our team - we should eat something mild at night, and we won't gain weight from drinking soup. It's not like after drinking the soup, we'll really -"</p>

    <p>Before he could say "die," Guo Hao hastily covered Chen Chao's mouth, but everyone could still vaguely hear him say that ominous word.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Ling was already observing a moment of silence for that Internet-famous soup restaurant...</p>

    <p>He then unlocked his phone to look for news on that restaurant, and sure enough, he saw that the latest news contained an expos√© on that Internet-famous soup restaurant.</p>

    <p>The news headline was [An Internet-famous soup restaurant down Yellow Springs Road has been shut down and is being investigated for hygiene issues after customers came down with severe diarrhea].</p>

    <p>"..." After reading this, Wang Ling silently closed his phone.</p>

    <p>It could only be said that Chen Chao's mouth was indeed terrifying. However, Wang Ling also realized that it had to be something which Chen Chao said without thinking before it came true. This was what people meant when they said that "prized milk is useless<sup>3</sup>," which also applied to Chen Chao.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(A spin on the colloquial term "poisonous milk," which is jinxing someone with your words ..)</dfn>

    <p>For example, if Chen Chao wanted to do well, and hence predicted that he would get full marks on his next test, it wouldn't happen.</p>

    <p>"Then what should we eat? Have you thought about it?" Wang Zhen swallowed as he looked at the three thousand yuan on the table; after he and Liu Qingyi were punished by Heavenly Dao, practically all they ate nowadays was instant noodles, in order to save money.</p>

    <p>Whenever Wang Zhen burped now, he felt like it had the flavor of braised beef...</p>

    <p>Looking at current Earth prices, three thousand yuan would be enough for them to eat until they were full.</p>

    <p>"Let's see what everyone likes first. If you don't have any ideas, then let me recommend something; I know a few good restaurants." Li Youyue raised her eyebrows, a confident expression on her face. "I don't eat spicy food. How about you guys?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong thought for a moment. "There's nothing in particular that I need to avoid."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "Spicy or not is fine for me. I don't eat duck."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "I eat anything."</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi said in unison, "Me too!" They exchanged looks of dismay after that, and then ignored each other as they looked away.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing: "As for me, I don't eat food that's too sweet."</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi: "My taste is the same as Wang Ling's."</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan: "So's mine!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "???"</p>

    <p>Li Youyue: "Then what does Classmate Wang Ling like..."</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi laughed. "It's definitely black pepper." After all, the sachet of seasoning inside a crispy noodle snack packet was black pepper in flavor.</p>

    <p>When Gu Shunzhi said this, Wang Ling was stunned. Gu Shunzhi had unexpectedly hit the nail on the head!</p>

    <p>As expected of the keeper of order - how dangerous!</p>

    <p>Xia Ming wasn't planning to say anything, and was fine with whatever was decided, but since everyone had contributed to the discussion, he thought he would seem a bit antisocial if he didn't say anything. Thus, he thought for a while, and then raised his hand and said, "Er... I'm allergic to peanuts, so I can't eat them"</p>

    <p>"Okay, got it." Li Youyue thought a bit, then said, "How about seafood? You can adjust your preferences yourself. I know a restaurant called The Conch Lady! Have you heard of it?"</p>

    <p>When Li Youyue said that, Sun Rong instantly fell silent.</p>

    <p>Because this restaurant...</p>

    <p>...was actually a business under her Huaguo Water Curtain Group.</p>
