  <h1>Chapter 965 What Cheek!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Seeing that a fight had already started at the recycling stand, Father Chen hesitated as he debated whether to go over and have a look. But he was then stupefied to see how excessively strong the three little scions were; they were more nimble than some of the big kids who had been training at his dojo for years.</p>

    <p>After thinking about it, Father Chen decided not to step forward in the end. Zhang Dezhi had dispatched a bodyguard to look after them. Judging from his aura, the bodyguard was a Golden Core cultivator. He was keeping watch, so there was no way anyone would actually die.</p>

    <p>Besides, with his father Liang Heng backing him up, Tiger Liang this brat had brought over a bunch of hooligans to smash Xiaoling's mom's stuff and even beat her up. The thought enraged Father Chen. This opportunity was hard to come by, and Tiger Liang had to be given a good thrashing no matter what.</p>

    <p>That day, Chen Chao and Wang Xiaoling gaped in awe...</p>

    <p>Regardless of their training in the dojo, this was their first time seeing true sect disciples up close, as well as a genuine sect young master taking action in a scuffle.</p>

    <p>Not all rich second generation kids were like Tiger Liang, who relied on his father and bullied others.</p>

    <p>Rich second generation kids also existed relative to each other at every level of society.</p>

    <p>Tiger Liang was a rich second generation in their neighborhood.</p>

    <p>But compared with the sects of Zhang Dezhi and the other sect leaders, the Liang family's Balance Magic Center was like a slum... These three little scions were of noble birth and had received the best of everything from the moment they were born. They would have obtained the best training, and far surpassed their peers in all physical aspects.</p>

    <p>Father Chen sighed with feeling repeatedly as he watched. Zhang Pingru, the son of the sect leader of Tyrant Earth Sect Zhang Dezhi, was only eight years old, but he was stronger than some of the eleven- and twelve-years-old in their family dojo.</p>

    <p>The more superior a rich second generation kid's family background was, the more likely they had to learn more and work harder than regular people since young.</p>

    <p>There was a good saying: <em>Don't be afraid of others being richer or higher born than you; be afraid if someone richer and higher born is more hardworking than you...</em></p>

    <p>Father Chen was deeply shaken by this point, and the young spirits of four-year-old Chen Chao and Wang Xiaoling were inspired at the same time.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>That evening, Father Chen called Xiaoling's mom, the three sect young masters, and the bodyguard who had accompanied them to the dojo for dinner. Mother Chen busied herself in the kitchen. It wouldn't be appropriate for her to order takeout on this occasion, so she wanted to do some home cooking.</p>

    <p>Initially, the three young masters still had training in the evening, but when Zhang Dezhi and the others heard about Father Chen's invitation, they immediately agreed inside the fan group. Actually, the truth was that they had agreed out of respect for Mr Wang.</p>

    <p>After Father Wang won Best Author, the book <em>Wet Nurse </em>had drawn widespread attention in the cultivation forum, and all the sect heads explored the mysteries in the novel as if they were reading a research report.</p>

    <p>Before dinner, everyone sat at the table peeling and eating melon seeds. The three young masters sat as smartly as ever, and Father Chen deeply felt the gap compared with his child's upbringing. But Father Chen wasn't worried. Chen Chao was only four years old, which was the time to be lively; that was the nature of children.</p>

    <p>"Thank you so much for everyone's help this time." Xiaoling's mom thanked them repeatedly.</p>

    <p>To be honest, she had already mentally prepared herself, and had known that Tiger Liang would come over again today to make trouble.</p>

    <p>The sturdy bodyguard whom Zhang Dezhi had dispatched was called Zhu Jin. Some people called him Little Zhu, and some people called him Ah Jin.</p>

    <p>Zhu Jin smiled and said, "Xiaoling's mother, you don't have to worry anymore after this. That brat got the lesson he deserved. Our three young masters didn't do much this time - that was just a slap on the wrist."</p>

    <p>"What? You call that a slap on the wrist? Poor Tiger Liang..."</p>

    <p>When he recalled Tiger Liang's wretched appearance at noon, Chen Chao slapped his thigh and couldn't help chortling.</p>

    <p>Wretched...</p>

    <p>He was indeed wretched...</p>

    <p>Tiger Liang had been sent flying with one kick at the start, like a ball that had been tossed in the air, and he had only dropped back down after a full five minutes. That bunch of lackeys he had brought with him didn't help out at all. Seeing the momentum of these three sect young masters, they all instantly scattered...</p>

    <p>"The kid was asking for it, not learning what is right but insisting on making trouble. And that father of his egging him on from behind is detestable!" Father Chen said angrily.</p>

    <p>"Thank you, Chief Chen, but I'm afraid Liang Heng won't give up..." Xiaoling's mom had a worried expression on her face. She hugged Wang Xiaoling who was sitting next to her, and somehow felt that her daughter seemed to have a little more awareness and meat on her bones than before.</p>

    <p>"I know, Xiaoling's mom, I understand his personality too well." Father Chen nodded.</p>

    <p>"You don't have to worry about that."</p>

    <p>Zhu Jin said, "Our three sect leaders have already sent lawyer letters to Balance Magic Center. If that Chief Liang is a sensible person, he won't come looking for trouble in the short term."</p>

    <p>"Lawyer letter?" Father Chen was blank.</p>

    <p>"That's right. After all, our three young masters also sustained injuries..." Zhu Jin said.</p>

    <p>"Where were they hurt?" Father Chen asked.</p>

    <p>"It's fine, they're minor injuries." Ah Jin sipped his tea and said, "They hit Tiger Liang so hard that they cracked their fingernails."</p>

    <p>" <em>Pfft... </em>" Chen Chao burst out laughing suddenly.</p>

    <p>Father Chen and Xiaoling's mom were utterly stunned by Tyrant Earth Sect's move. It was clearly Tiger Liang who had been beaten up, but the Liang family was the one to receive lawyer letters instead... Even this could happen?</p>

    <p>Ah Jin smiled. "There is no such thing as absolute justice in this world to begin with."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It had to be said that Chen Chao had amazing interpersonal skills. By the end of the meal, he was already close with all the three young masters and even exchanged contact details. While the trio were strong, Chen Chao also had his own strong point, which was that he was becoming more and more of a smooth talker... After all, he had been pursuing the "art of language" during this period of time.</p>

    <p>Father Chen was very happy about this.</p>

    <p>It was very rare to encounter peers of a higher level. Additionally, these three little scions normally had a very packed schedule, and Chen Chao was very lucky to be able to seize this opportunity.</p>

    <p>When Chen Chao did a rough comparison of his typical day with that of the three young masters, he realized his really was nothing.</p>

    <p>Beyond what Chen Chao imagined, there were so many things that the three sect young masters studied in one day. Especially eight-year-old Zhang Pingru... He was busy from six in the morning right up to two in the morning, and only got four hours of sleep every day.</p>

    <p>Spells logical thinking, physical training, agility training, spirit qi breathing training... lessons of all sorts one after another filled his day.</p>

    <p>Before Ah Jin took the young masters away, Father Chen was surprised when he saw Chen Chao actually wearing a suit belonging to one of the scions. It was a little too big, and Chen Chao had to hold up the pant legs and push up the sleeves. "Chen Chao, why are you wearing Pingru's clothes?"</p>

    <p>"It was Pingru who suggested it. He likes our dojo's Dao uniform, so I found him a set he could wear, and swapped clothes with him," Chen Chao explained.</p>

    <p>Father Chen: "What cheek!"</p>

    <p>"If the young master likes it, just let them swap. Chief Chen, train your son well. His root bone is in fact pretty good. We have some bone-strengthening pills exclusively developed by our sect. Sect Leader has something on and was unable to come today, so this is a gift! Someone will send it over in two days! Chief Chen, please think nothing of it!" said Ah Jin with a smile.</p>

    <p>"Thank you, Peppa!" Right after he spoke, Father Chen suddenly realized his mistake.</p>

    <p>He had been about to say "Little Zhu <sup>1</sup> ," but somehow his brain had short-circuited and he had called out the wrong name...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Pig is also "zhu" in Chinese,
and "little pig" calls Peppa Pig
to mind ..)</dfn>

    <p>"My apologies, Ah Jin..."</p>

    <p>"It's fine, Chief Chen, I'm already used to it..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"That's why people usually prefer to call me Ah Jin. If you call me Little Zhu, it's easy to think of something else..."</p>
