  <h1>Chapter 1164 Wang Zhen's Special Talent</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In chapters 802 and 803, Wang Zhen had a nightmare after being injured, which took him back to his miserable childhood. As a man who had been beaten since young, from when his parents beat him up until he started choosing the tool to beat himself with, Wang Zhen's experiences were the stuff of legend.</p>

    <p>Because of his special constitution, which was capable of enduring beatings and would achieve an awakening after being struck, Wang Zhen's body had been tempered by all sorts of tools.</p>

    <p>A divine whip as thick as a coke bottle, a meteorite hammer with 36,000 sharp spikes all over it, a head-shattering stone made out of king iron... Wang Zhen had stood firm and survived under these tools. He was never completely crushed by his miserable childhood and the pressures of life, and he was later struck by a truth.</p>

    <p>He was probably a natural-born warrior, and should rush to the very front as a meat shield.</p>

    <p>Thus, when Wang Zhen decided to use his body to draw the enemy's attention, the people behind him looked at his back and felt that he looked way cool.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen removed the life-saving golden talisman on his arm and gave it to Nan Yixiu. "Take this."</p>

    <p>"You're giving this to me?" Nan Yixiu felt it was inconceivable. Logically, if Wang Zhen was going to give it to someone, it should be to Chen Chao! Chen Chao was from Number 60 High! Not Nan Yixiu, who was an outsider. Even if they were allies, it didn't make sense to give him the important life-saving golden talisman, which was so important!</p>

    <p>Nan Yixiu refused. "If you give this to me, what about you? It's too dangerous."</p>

    <p>"It's fine, they can't hurt me." Wang Zhen smiled confidently. "I'm giving it to you because I trust you. If something does go wrong, just leave me, and evacuate with Chen Chao and Four Eyes."</p>

    <p>This trust deeply moved Nan Yixiu.</p>

    <p>He no longer hesitated, and reached out to take the golden talisman.</p>

    <p>Since he had accepted it, he would carry out his duty and mission!</p>

    <p>Nan Yixiu was a responsible and reliable person.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen had realized this early on.</p>

    <p>He was someone from the Domain of the Gods; it was impossible for him not to be able to see into one's heart.</p>

    <p>Strictly speaking, this was also one of Wang Zhen's special talents.</p>

    <p>Because he had grown up experiencing all sorts of violence and malice, he had a particularly keen sense for evil intentions, and could detect the tags in a person's heart. With Nan Yixiu, for example, Wang Zhen could see the tags [integrity], [determination], [quick wits], [reliability]...</p>

    <p>With Liu Qingyi, Wang Zhen could see [violence], [tsundere], [kindness], [charm]...</p>

    <p>As for Gu Shunzhi, he had very few tags: [resourcefulness], [keeper of order]...</p>

    <p>Because of Gu Shunzhi's special identity, Wang Zhen was unable to see all of his tags since some of his strength was still being suppressed by Heavenly Dao. Usually, he would be able to see at least four tags in a person's heart.</p>

    <p>Sometimes he could even see more than ten, or even twenty tags.</p>

    <p>Of course, there were people whose tags he couldn't detect.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, for example.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen remembered that when he had checked Wang Ling's tag, it was like this: [...]</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After discussing battle tactics with Nan Yixiu, Wang Zhen simply charged forward, undaunted by the danger. While he knew that Gao Tianming, who was at the Foundation Establishment stage, wouldn't be able to do any harm to his body, there was no way Wang Zhen would physically deflect an attack with his own flesh in such a public situation - it would be too obvious.</p>

    <p>Thus, while Wang Zhen's goal was to open battle by taunting them with his presence, he was still planning to use his reflexes to evade any attack.</p>

    <p>The other party was a Foundation Establishment cultivator. How fast could his attack be? Wang Zhen would definitely be able to react in time.</p>

    <p>Besides, even if he was hit, it would be no more painful than being bitten by a mosquito... He hadn't cried out even once when he was struck with the divine whip.</p>

    <p>He advanced another four li, and was less than a li away from the foot of Mist Peak now. Such an obvious target had naturally been noticed by the students on the mountaintop.</p>
    
    <p>Several sharp arrows were shot at Wang Zhen. In front of these Foundation Establishment cultivators, his dynamic vision went into overdrive. As the arrows flew at him, he felt them slow down to a thousandth of their speed.</p>

    <p>He stepped to the side lightly and perfectly avoided them.</p>

    <p>His posture was a little like Wang Ling's. During his time on Earth, Wang Zhen frequently reflected on his battles with Wang Ling, and had also unconsciously started to copy Wang Ling's elusive movements. Unfortunately, he couldn't grasp the essence, no matter how he copied Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>On the mountaintop, Gao Tianming had noticed the movements below.</p>

    <p>"Captain Gao, we've detected a person from Number 60 High," a Stars High student stepped forward and said with an expressionless face.</p>

    <p>The whole of Stars High had already fallen under Gao Tianming's Virus Puppet Spell, and the 10-person team was now under his control.</p>

    <p>To Gao Tianming, these people were nothing more than his tools.</p>

    <p>He stared at Wang Zhen at the foot of the mountain with a profound gaze, and fell into deep thought.</p>

    <p>He took out a photo from his pocket. After another comparison through a puppet with far sight, he confirmed that the person at the foot of the mountain was Wang Zhen in the flesh.</p>

    <p>A while ago, someone had found Gao Tianming and given him a picture.</p>

    <p>The people in it were all from Number 60 High: Wang Zhen, Liu Qingyi, Gu Shunzhi, Zhen Yuan (Zhenyuan) and Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>Gao Tianming didn't know what their backgrounds were, but after giving him the photo, the person had requested that he do whatever he could to cripple them in this competition.</p>

    <p>Of course, trying to severely injure these big shots was easier said than done.</p>

    <p>It would naturally be very difficult for Gao Tianming to do so with his initial strength.</p>

    <p>So, the man gave Gao Tianming a frozen dumpling to eat...</p>

    <p>Gao Tianming could hardly believe his eyes. "What's this?"</p>

    <p>"Something that can quickly and permanently boost your strength," replied the mysterious man in the white cloak.</p>

    <p>"A dumpling?"</p>

    <p>"This isn't an ordinary dumpling. They were pretty much all gone at first, but thanks to some traces left behind, I was able to restore them. Eat one, and you'll stand on top of the world."</p>

    <p>Before Gao Tianming ate the dumpling, he had thought the person in front of him might be a true-blue psychopath.</p>

    <p>The person's words sounded very chuuni, but they carried a devilish power which made Gao Tianming feel as if he couldn't control his own hands, and he grabbed the dumpling and ate it.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Zhen still didn't know that the person he was facing wasn't an ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p>

    <p>Gao Tianming had hidden his power while he was testing it out.</p>

    <p>He had obtained the power of Shadow Dao, and learned to control his shadow under the guidance of the mysterious person who had given him the dumpling. He simply needed to withdraw his shadow to perfectly suppress his own strength.</p>

    <p>And now was the moment to turn his shadow loose...</p>

    <p>Gao Tianming knew that he had become very strong, but he still needed to test it out on an opponent.</p>

    <p>In any case, he was only going to severely injure the other party, not beat them to death.</p>

    <p>Gao Tianming thought this in his heart.</p>

    <p>Then, he released his shadow!</p>

    <p>The sudden onset of danger made Wang Zhen's hair stand on end!</p>

    <p>He could actually sense death...</p>
