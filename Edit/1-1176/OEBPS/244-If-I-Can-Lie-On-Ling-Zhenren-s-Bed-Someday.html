  <h1>Chapter 244 If I Can Lie On Ling Zhenren's Bed Someday... </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Lord Diulei's rule for interrogation had always been to use special methods for special people. Of course, it might seem a little like unlawful torture, but in order to deal with the dark forces which liked to play small tricks behind the scenes, Lord Diulei's interrogation methods were nothing.</p>

    <p>There were times when he felt that not everyone was able to comprehend basic truths through cultivation. Different people at the Soul Formation stage would have different understandings of it — the biggest difference was that some people became wiser while some became more muddled.</p>

    <p>Obviously, after the man heard Lord Diulei tell Dharmaraja to use the godly thunder inheritance, he couldn't help sweating buckets of cold water.</p>

    <p>The man looked at Dharmaraja blankly. "Are you... a descendant of the Thunder clan?"</p>

    <p>"That's right." Dharmaraja nodded.</p>

    <p>Man from Immortal Mansion: "..."</p>

    <p>He had never expected that this person who had been standing in front of him all this time, wearing goggles and looking like a perverted uncle, would actually be a descendant of the Thunder clan, one of the twelve ancient clans.</p>

    <p>To be honest, in the split second when their gazes had met earlier, a thought had flashed through the man's mind as he wondered whether this perverted uncle was an actor who played roles where he acted as a groper.</p>

    <p>He didn't look like a descendant of the famous Thunder clan at all, and it was completely different from what he had imagined! — Even if you couldn't release one hundred thousand volts <sup>1</sup> , shouldn't you at least fit the picture of a teen idol with spiky blonde hair and a clearly defined six-pack, crackling with lightning <sup>2</sup> ?!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is Pikachu's Thunderbolt attack.)</dfn>
    
    <br/>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is a reference to the
Super Saiyan level in
'Dragonball.')</dfn>

    <p>The man from Immortal Mansion couldn't suppress the strong desire in his heart to ridicule Dharmaraja fiercely.</p>

    <p>Reality proved that there were times when people's dreams could really be crushed...</p>

    <p>From where she was sitting on the man, Sheep could clearly see the expression of loss on his face after he had verified that Dharmaraja was from the Thunder clan.</p>

    <p>She noticed that his eyes had grown dim.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, this time, she could clearly hear the sound of his heart breaking.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"So after all this, it turns out that this person is your fan?" Lord Diulei had crossed his arms and there was a funny expression on his face.</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja was flattered: "..." He actually had fans?</p>

    <p>"It makes sense. The last descendant of the Thunder clan who can use spirit energy to activate the holy relic, the godly thunder inheritance — by all accounts, it sounds like a great legend. The Thunder clan's name from back then is still a great one." Lord Diulei curled his lip as he looked at Dharmaraja and said, "If you continue working for the Xiao clan as an electric welder, you'll just be squandering what's left of its reputation."</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja blushed with shame when he heard this.</p>

    <p>"Long ago, the Thunder clan protected our ancestors, which is why we juniors have always valued the clan." The man on the ground gritted his teeth and said, "But just because a descendant of the Thunder clan is standing in front of me doesn't mean I'll tell you anything just like that..."</p>

    <p>"So you're a man of integrity."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei sighed helplessly at the man on the ground.</p>

    <p>A moment later, he waved his hand. "Fine, we're not in any rush to interrogate him. Let's just eat first. We can't miss Old Senior Wang's stewed broccoli soup!"</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja was a little surprised. "What? Didn't you want me to blind him with my godly thunder inheritance?"</p>

    <p>"In any case, he's a fan of yours, do you think you can really do that to him?" Lord Diulei laughed.</p>

    <p>As expected, Dharmaraja hesitated. He looked at the man on the ground and gave it some more thought before deciding to let it go in the end. He noticed that Lord Diulei looked very confident, so he knew that the other man very likely had a countermeasure in place already.</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja had always felt that in a world which prioritized looks, people who were his fans were a rare species... it had been hard to find one, so he had to take good care of him.</p>

    <p>If the man hadn't been a fan, Dharmaraja had already been prepared to fry him either medium or medium well.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When it was time to eat, Father Wang and Lie Mengmeng didn't come downstairs as they were still engaged in lively discussion in the study. Lord Diulei directly delivered the food to them, and the man from Immortal Mansion was taken aback by his reverent attitude.</p>

    <p>At this point, he already couldn't use logic to figure out the situation inside this villa — because so far, looking at the current situation, there didn't seem to be a single normal person here!</p>

    <p>He clearly couldn't sense any fluctuation of spirit energy from the homeowner, but whether it was Great Death-Courting Senior or Lightning Dharmaraja, a descendant of the Thunder clan, both of them showed reverence for the master of the house, and even called him "great senior."</p>

    <p>The man wondered deeply whether his ability to sense spirit energy had already been crippled...</p>

    <p>As they ate, this man from Immortal Mansion wasn't idle; although he had been tied up firmly, he was still thinking of ways to discreetly notify Immortal Mansion of the situation.</p>

    <p>After a cheerful lunch with Mother Wang and Grandfather Wang, Lord Diulei directly carried the man upstairs.</p>

    <p>The man was heavy and 1.9 meters tall, but Lord Diulei just lifted him up by the rope with one finger, as if he was lifting up a chicken. He then threw him into Wang Ling's room to continue the interrogation.</p>

    <p>Sitting on the edge of Wang Ling's bed, Lord Diulei crossed his slender legs and gazed languidly at the man in front of him. "Don't bother trying, as soon as you entered the door just now, Sheep and the others had already flagged you. Any fluctuations of magic weapons and communication signals are cut off inside this house and won't connect to the outside world."</p>

    <p>"Ah? This type of operation exists?" Dharmaraja was stunned again. Ever since coming to the Wang family's villa, he had felt like a fool, experiencing one shock after another.</p>

    <p>He carefully checked his phone and saw that indeed, it didn't have a signal. No wonder he hadn't gotten any phone calls since coming here.</p>

    <p>"I forgot to ask Sheep to set it up for you just now. The next time you come here, you won't be flagged anymore," Lord Diulei said as he looked at Dharmaraja.</p>

    <p>"Then what about you?" Dharmaraja asked in return.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei replied, "I'm a regular guest, so they already changed the setting for me earlier on."</p>

    <p>As Lord Diulei spoke, Dharmaraja realized that the other man was already lying on Ling Zhenren's bed like a paralyzed geyou <sup>3</sup> . What was more, his elbow was pressing down a little on Jingke, lying next to the pillow... but Jingke didn't mind at all, and didn't make the slightest move!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(A reminder that Ge You is
an actor who starred in a TV
comedy sitcom called I
Loved My Family. A
screencap of a scene where
he's slouching down on a
sofa low enough that he's
almost lying flat became a
Chinese online viral meme..)</dfn>

    <p>Dharmaraja was speechless when he saw this. This wasn't just being familiar... this was already being intimate!</p>

    <p>This was Ling Zhenren's bed, pillow and sword...</p>

    <p>Even if he returned here a hundred times, Dharmaraja didn't think he would ever have the nerve to sprawl so leisurely on Ling Zhenren's bed like that.</p>

    <p>He fixed his eyes on Wang Ling's soft single bed and swallowed unconsciously.</p>

    <p>From another point of view, if he could someday lie on Ling Zhenren's bed like Lord Diulei... would that mean that his relationship with Ling Zhenren would have advanced a step?</p>
