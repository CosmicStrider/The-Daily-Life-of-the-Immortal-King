  <h1>Chapter 903 Miss Scabbard Who Knows the Script</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was only then that Zhuo Yi realized that Boss Jin seemed to have set them up... Previously, Boss Jin had stressed over and over again that the peach wood sword was a token of his and his girlfriend's love - he had refrained from mentioning the fact that the scabbard had spawned an artifact spirit.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi had originally thought that Boss Jin was especially attached to this peach wood sword because it was a "love token"; after all, it had happened thirteen years ago...</p>

    <p>But now they finally understood that Boss Jin had in fact "set up house for a beloved woman"!</p>

    <p>For a moment, the whole room fell silent.</p>

    <p>Roughly ten minutes later, a girl with white hair and wearing a "Video Game One" Lu Ban character "game skin" pushed open the door and came in.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was finally seeing this Miss Scabbard. The girl took off her cap. Her eyes were empty and dull, and she had an ahoge as white as a sharp sword which stuck right up on the top of her head. At first glance, Wang Ling felt that she and Jingke indeed were meant to be... She was about fifteen years old, slightly older than Jingke, and had developed well in all the right places.</p>

    <p>"Father, I'm telling you, you only have ten minutes! You promised to buy me a game, no backing out!"</p>

    <p>The girl entered with a wooden face, casually pulled out a chair, and sat down. She then folded her arms and stared at the people in front of her.</p>

    <p>Her gaze swept over Er Ha, Fang Xing and Zhuo Yi, then finally stopped on Wang Ling. After observing Wang Ling for a while, she nodded and said, "No wonder Father is doing so well in the exorcism convention this year. This trash is indeed much stronger than the ones last year."</p>

    <p>Trash...</p>

    <p>Fang Xing's forehead throbbed visibly.</p>

    <p>Forget her calling him trash... but she actually dared call Wang Ling that?</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi wiped his sweat and felt that this Miss Scabbard really had a hot temper.</p>

    <p>"Such formidable spirit power," Er Ha said to itself in its heart.</p>

    <p>Boss Jin hadn't lied: this girl was indeed an artifact spirit. The composition of an artifact spirit's spirit power was more unique; Er Ha could sense it. However, Er Ha had to admit that this was its first time seeing an artifact spirit maintain its human form all this while, since most artifact spirits preferred to stay in their original forms.</p>

    <p>This was because artifact spirits consumed a lot of spirit power when they took on human forms.</p>

    <p>But this Miss Scabbard didn't seem bothered by this - or was it because there didn't appear to be a limit to her spirit power in her human form?</p>

    <p>What was going on?</p>

    <p>Er Ha was very puzzled.</p>

    <p>"Let me introduce you: this is my daughter, Jin Baiqiao <sup>1</sup> ..." Boss Jin wiped his sweat as he made the introductions. It seemed that he was very helpless when it came to his daughter.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Bai Qiao literally means "white scabbard")</dfn>

    <p>However, Miss Scabbard frowned and seemed very displeased with Boss Jin's introduction. "How many times have I told you, my surname isn't Jin. My name is Bai Qiao. Father, please correct yourself and don't simply give me a surname. I call you Father because that was the name you signed the contract with."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>This retort left Boss Jin somewhat speechless.</p>

    <p>After a long silence, Zhuo Yi was the first to break it. "Given Miss Bai Qiao's fighting strength, if she participated in the exorcism convention, she would definitely help Boss Jin rank first."</p>

    <p>This was the truth, but also the standard flattery... After all, this was their first meeting. In Zhuo Yi's opinion, it was necessary to say something nice and pleasant to hear.</p>

    <p>But this Miss Bai Qiao didn't buy it. She stared at Zhuo Yi and chuckled. "With my strength, getting rid of those petty devils would naturally be a piece of cake, but they aren't worthy of my attention. I know you, you're called Zhuo Yi, right? The one that's been on TV a lot lately?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was delighted. "Miss Bai Qiao knows me?"</p>

    <p>"Of course, King of Taking All the Credit."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"You can fool other people, but not me." Bai Qiao stared at Zhuo Yi and snorted. "But I also can't be bothered to expose your little tricks - everyone minds their own business. Besides, exposing you wouldn't do me any good. You have a lot of fans now; if I expose you online, they'll come after me."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>This second barb rendered Zhuo Yi silent.</p>

    <p>Er Ha couldn't take it anymore - this girl's tongue was so poisonous.</p>

    <p>It felt that as a loyal dog, it was time for it to show off the literary knowledge which it had accumulated in the human world.</p>

    <p>Wasn't this just insulting people? Who wasn't capable of that?!</p>

    <p>But Er Ha had yet to open its mouth when Bai Qiao stared at it. "You're the demon king from six years ago, aren't you? You barely landed before you were punched through the stomach. Now, you've become a spirit dog; not quite a demon, not quite a dog. You think you can argue with me just by learning a bit of human culture? 'Demons and ghosts,"to stand alone, to act in collusion,"to walk alone, to enlighten people'... You can't even sing the song <em>Rare Words </em>, can you <sup>2</sup> ?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(These are lyrics from the song, which is famous for using some of the most uncommon words in the Chinese language, and almost all of them are comprised of multi-stroke characters that are very difficult to write ..)</dfn>

    <p>"You..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha cried and retreated into itself.</p>

    <p>After making a jab at the third person, Bai Qiao then turned to look at Fang Xing. "You do have some skill, but you're still not as good as me. I know you, you're Immortal She Pi's son? Or a daughter? This really is a son and daughter!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi, Er Ha and Fang Xing all froze.</p>

    <p>Could this girl be the legendary person who already knew what the script was like?</p>

    <p>Finally, Bai Qiao's eyes turned to Wang Ling. "Don't think I'm afraid to insult you just because you're a pretty boy with fierce dead fish eyes. Why are you pretending to be weak? Who are you putting on a poker face for? Do you have any idea how strong you are yourself? All the strong people have gone off to save the world; you're the only one still in high school!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Other people say that you're a rip-off of <em>Saiki Kusuo </em>- why don't you dye your hair pink and put lollipops on your head? What's so great about putting a talisman seal on yourself as a kid? Who did you seal the Three Thousand Great Dao away for? If you have the ability, just destroy the world! Don't screw around! Although I don't know you very well, gossip is a scary thing! As soon as you were born, you could already sit up in a pram - you copied someone else's setting and you still won't admit it?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Forget about going to school. You don't have many lines in this book. You can obviously talk, but you insist on speaking telepathically to make yourself appear very low-key. So what if you can use the Three Thousand Great Dao? So what if you can cultivate? So what if you're omnipotent? You're just a mensao lurker who likes to do things behind the scenes. So what if you send ellipses - I can do that too!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"That's it, you've gone too far!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha couldn't take it anymore as it slapped its paws together and stared at Boss Jin. "Can... can I beat up your daughter?!"</p>

    <p>Boss Jin gave them a pained smile. "Do as you like..."</p>

    <p>Right after that, Fang Xing, Zhuo Yi and Er Ha all lunged at her.</p>

    <p>"Three small fry want to take me on?"</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao sneered. At that moment, the ahoge on her head glowed and turned into a whip of light which lashed out.</p>
