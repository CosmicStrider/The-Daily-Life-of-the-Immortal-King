  <h1>Chapter 75 The Weekend Is Naturally For Studying! </h1>

  <div>

      <p>Online live streaming had become a hot topic recently. There were experts who criticized online broadcasters, whether to their faces or behind their backs, for using their looks or scanty attire to make money off fans, while they themselves hated that they couldn't just stand in front of a screen to give an academic lecture and make hundreds of thousands each month easily.</p>

      <p>But not just anyone could make a living through live streaming. This was the age of beauty. For example, there were countless cases nowadays of blind dates falling flat when the reality of a person's looks didn't match expectations. If someone wanted to make a name for themselves on an online platform, they needed to have the type of face that was popular online, or at the very least, a pleasant-looking one.</p>

      <p>But who knew, maybe someone with a blood-red figure, butterfly-blue hair, and the face of Third Young Master Tang, singing "Ah~~ five~~ rings" might be able to make it big <sup>1</sup> .</p>

      <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Basically, the author is giving an example of someone bizarre enough who might be able to break into the live stream market. Third Young Master Tang is the pseudonym of a very famous web novelist, and "five rings" is from the popular 'Song of the Fifth Ring,' a song by Chinese rapper MC Hotdog.)</dfn>

      <p>At least, it would be a more festive sight.</p>

      <p>Little Xuan had greatly inspired Father Wang; live streaming could be considered a universal subject, something which was very immersive and fun. But the thing he now had to consider was how to develop this theme and make it even more interesting.</p>

      <p>After hearing Little Xuan's suggestion, Father Wang hurriedly expressed his thanks to everyone in the live stream, then logged off right away.</p>

      <p>Seeing Wang Jiaomei's profile icon turn gray, the people online all immediately knew... this almighty big shot in the world of web novels was about to make his move!</p>

      <p>This time... what kind of carnage was he going to wreck?</p>

      <p>Father Wang was quite an efficient person, which was reflected in everything he did. For example, in the time it took to boil water, he could easily finish three things at once while he was on the toilet bowl: eating, reading the newspaper, and squabbling with trolls in the online book review section by switching between the hundreds of alternate IDs which he owned.</p>

      <p>The title: The Live Streaming Life of the Immortal King</p>

      <p>A brief introduction: This is a story about the daily life of a cultivation master who is unable to suppress the prehistoric powers inside his body, and who sells <sup>2</sup> meng online by live streaming his daily immortal cultivation life on earth.</p>

      <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Adapted from the original Japanese word moe 萌え,the word 萌 or meng in pinyin can simply mean "cute," but at a deeper level, also refers to feeling fondness, devotion or excitement for someone.)</dfn>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p>Wang Ling had been looking at Father Wang's computer screen the whole time and felt an underlying sense of foreboding.</p>

      <p>Given Father Wang's current skill level in writing, it was very quick and easy for him to write an opening chapter. After checking for spelling mistakes several times from top to bottom, Father Wang then clicked his mouse and directly sent the file to his chief editor.</p>

      <p>Father Wang's chief editor was called Song Zikai and his editor code name was Lie Shou. People in the industry had given this big editor the nickname "'Lie Mengmeng." When he had paid a visit to the house before, Wang Ling had used his supernatural Eye Ability to check out this person's name card. This was the only editor whom Father Wang had met in real life since entering the web novel industry more than ten years ago. He was a very frail youth who looked like a shou <sup>3</sup> ; he seemed like he would tip over in a breeze, and his very neat fringe gave people the sense that he was very pure.</p>

      <dfn><sup>3</sup>(As a reminder, shou is used to describe the person who is the bottom in a BL relationship.)</dfn>

      <p>With the computer on, Father Wang made a cup of tea and waited in silence for a while. Very soon, he heard a ping! - Chief Editor Song had replied!</p>

      <p>This gold star editor was also an excellent publicist. The average time he took to check a manuscript was just thirty seconds, which was an especially mystical feat to Wang Ling.</p>

      <p>From Wang Ling's quick glance at the email reply, the theme was very attractive and Father Wang's writing was fine. But given the stunning performance of Father Wang's first book, along with his current online prestige, Lie Mengmeng decided he should write a few more chapters. After they added up to more than twenty thousand words, only then would he upload it onto the website to test the waters.</p>

      <p>Wang Ling had heard about this website before — it was a separate VIP novel website specially set up by the Cultivation Reading Network for readers who were their highest-ranked users and had been registered with them for more than one hundred years. On this separate website, they could read the drafts of new works by top-ranked writers beforehand and leave them messages to tell them their thoughts or offer suggestions.</p>

      <p>Gazing at the email reply, Father Wang was silent for a while, but finally he nodded in acceptance. After all, Wang Situ this pen name was a godhead that had taken him years to build and perfect. Given that he didn't know how marketable his second book could be, Father Wang really didn't dare release it casually — if it didn't pass the test, his godship would collapse! As for himself... wouldn't he become a complete joke in the industry?!</p>

      <p>Wang Ling was speechless at this. "..." This one pen name had been able to attract three hundred thousand people to a live streaming platform that had absolutely nothing to do with web novels — how could online nobodies compare with that and fucking survive?!</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>In the morning, Mother Wang had finished preparing breakfast, which was made up of fried bread sticks, soybean milk and her specialty, rejuvenation noodles. Mother Wang untied her apron strings and shouted up the stairs. "The two of you, come down and eat!"</p>

      <p>Wang Ling gazed at the table full of dishes and was almost moved to tears... after the torture that had been Mother Juan's black cuisine during those few days at Number 59 High School, it was perhaps only Mother Wang's personally cooked dishes that could fix his wounded heart.</p>

      <p>As they ate, Father Wang pushed his black-rimmed glasses up and stared closely at Wang Ling for a bit before he sighed. "Tch, you seem to have grown fatter these last four days."</p>

      <p>Wang Ling touched his face and felt that his cheeks had indeed seemed to have gotten meatier... this was probably because he had eaten Mother Juan's cooking and it was now fermenting in his stomach.</p>

      <p>It didn't matter though, as losing weight had never been difficult for him...</p>

      <p>Wang Ling rubbed his cheeks vigorously with both hands, and like plasticine, the fat on his face was instantly smoothed out.</p>

      <p>"..." Even this could fucking work?!</p>

      <p>This was the first time that Father and Mother Wang had witnessed this ability of his.</p>

      <p>Father Wang ate a mouthful of rejuvenation noodles. "These last four days, how was it, living in a large group?"</p>

      <p>Wang Ling was taken aback, but in the end shook his head.</p>

      <p>"I heard that when Ming Ming brought you the talisman seal, a lot of things happened?"</p>

      <p>Wang Ling nodded.</p>

      <p>Father Wang sighed. "Actually, I think you're just too nervous. Maybe if you act more naturally, nothing will happen. You should spend more time with your peers, understand?"</p>

      <p>Wang Ling continued nodding.</p>

      <p>"Enough! Why bring this up when we're eating!"</p>

      <p>Mother Wang interrupted Father Wang. "But Ling Ling, don't forget to do a bit of homework revision these two days. Although you shouldn't do too well, you shouldn't be at the bottom of the class, at least. Just study whatever is necessary. I've already asked about the classes you missed, and I especially made the trip to school to pick up the review materials. It should be enough for you to take a few minutes later to have a quick look at them."</p>

      <p>"Okay." Concise and comprehensive, this was the first word Wang Ling had spoken after coming home.</p>

      <p>In truth, he didn't need to review courses like Dao talismans and magical skills at all. But for courses like history and political science, he still had to spend some time memorizing the materials. Even for top students in the elite class like Lin Xiaoyu and Sun Rong, catching up on one week's worth of classes and digesting the knowledge would still take them a whole day.</p>

      <p>In contrast, it was a lot more convenient for Wang Ling, who could use his speed reading and memorization skills... mother never has to worry about my studies <sup>4</sup> !</p>

      <dfn><sup>4</sup>(This tagline is from a Chinese TV ad for an electronic device produced under BBK Electronics which helps teach children how to read.)</dfn>

      <p>But Wang Ling didn't want to be disturbed by anyone after he started his wonderful weekend of study, especially when he was using his quick memorization skill. If someone disturbed him at that time, it was highly possible it would result in him remembering things wrongly.</p>

      <p>And so, to prevent this from happening, Wang Ling opened up his stationery pouch...</p>

      <p>The monster pen and goblin eraser that he had created with magic previously could help him maintain order.</p>
