  <h1>Chapter 783 Wu Zhenjun's Ultimate Move</h1>

  <div>

    <p>He had only used twenty percent of his strength...</p>

    <p>A lot of people were stupefied at Wang Ming's move.</p>

    <p>This armor could actually change the Spirit Power Cannon's skin... this was too impressive!</p>

    <p>The majority of the people present were lost for words.</p>

    <p>None of the students and teachers who had doubted this armor earlier dared to speak now.</p>

    <p>Because this suit of armor just couldn't be regarded with common sense.</p>

    <p>Looking at the overall situation now, it seemed that Wang Ming had the upper hand.</p>

    <p>"Lao Gudong Xiaoer's equipment is so awesome, I also want one. But does anyone know what Lao Gudong Xiaoer's realm was before he put this on?" someone asked.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao was blank; he realized that for the first time, there was something which both he and his uncle didn't know...</p>

    <p>"I say, if Lao Gudong Xiaoer is just an ordinary person, and he can match an Itinerant Immortal in this armor, this would simply be a miracle invention!" On the side, Chen Chao chuckled and rubbed his head. "Of course, I'm just joking. We don't know what Lao Gudong Xiaoer's realm is, so don't take this seriously!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>At that point, the atmosphere on the scene shifted.</p>

    <p>It wasn't until that moment that many of the students truly realized that intellectual knowledge could change one's destiny. It turned out that gaps in realm, cultivation talent and strength could be made up for with knowledge!</p>

    <p>Knowledge was power - so, there really was some truth to this!</p>

    <p>After the first clash, the teachers who were maintaining order on the scene started to get the students to sit down in a circle to watch this contest between cultivation and science.</p>

    <p>"Everyone watch carefully and take notes! This is a rare study opportunity!" A teacher gave instructions on the scene.</p>

    <p>Everyone then realized that without them knowing, a barrier had already been set up around Wu Zhenjun and Wang Ming as if it was a battle arena.</p>

    <p>It was the head of state who had set up this barrier, and it was stable enough.</p>

    <p>A lot of the teachers and students who didn't understand the situation would probably think that it was some busybody who had raised this barrier.</p>

    <p>But even if this barrier hadn't gone up, the teachers had already planned to work together to build one. If Wang Ming truly could go toe-to-toe with an Itinerant Immortal in this armor, then this would be a great battle between Itinerant Immortals.</p>

    <p>If two True Immortals were to fight for real, it would be enough to destroy a planet.</p>

    <p>Similarly, a duel between Itinerant Immortals couldn't be underestimated. Since they were still in the remains, there was a chance the place would suffer damage if restrictions weren't put in place.</p>

    <p>In short, after this barrier went up, it was Wu Zhenjun's turn to get a headache.</p>

    <p>The implication was already very clear: he was to do battle with Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>It was also at that moment that Wu Zhenjun realized the deeper significance of this duel.</p>

    <p>His emperor medal teaching title instantly was nothing compared with the importance of this showdown.</p>

    <p>Just like many people thought, this was a clash between cultivation and science - was it truly possible to rely on science to stand on par with a cultivator in a fight? This was one question. More importantly, once Wang Ming's patent went public, it would undoubtedly favor those who didn't have cultivation talent, but still had a cultivation dream.</p>

    <p>Commercialization and factory-manufactured armor would enable them to rapidly stand on par with cultivators who had been genuinely and painstakingly cultivating for hundreds of years.</p>

    <p>A true cultivator would definitely be depressed by this.</p>

    <p>Thinking on it further, it was possible that ultimately, more and more people would abandon cultivation and choose to wear this armor instead.</p>

    <p>Thus, Wu Zhenjun wanted to make it clear in this fight.</p>

    <p>He had to win this fight.</p>

    <p>This could be considered validation for all cultivators.</p>

    <p>"It seems that Lao Gudong Xiaoer is already prepared. In that case, I won't be polite."</p>

    <p>Wu Zhenjun released a soft breath.</p>

    <p>The next moment, he stamped his foot lightly, and a grand circle appeared beneath his feet.</p>

    <p>Summons Spell!</p>

    <p>Some of the teachers immediately recognized this spell.</p>

    <p>Wu Zhenjun was actually using the Summons Spell.</p>

    <p>It looked like he really was going to get serious...</p>

    <p>Some of the teachers who were familiar with Wu Zhenjun couldn't help thinking of Irascible Dharmaraja's most powerful spell back then, which required coordination with a special summoned spirit beast.</p>

    <p>Hence, the instant they saw the summoning array, many of the teachers were moved.</p>

    <p>They couldn't help recalling Irascible Dharmaraja's summoned spirit beast back then.</p>

    <p>It was obvious that Wu Zhenjun was going to summon the same spirit beast!</p>

    <p>A black ink-like spring bubbled out of the summoning array on the ground, and several seconds later, it crackled with purple lightning.</p>

    <p>"Purple lightning?"</p>

    <p>Standing in the air, Wang Ming stared at the electricity that was lashing out.</p>

    <p>Wu Zhenjun was probably about to use his ultimate move.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming already had this premonition.</p>

    <p>"What kind of spirit beast is this?" There were still some students who weren't clear about the situation.</p>

    <p>"This purple lightning is Ziwei Lightning. Of the Five Yin Lightning<sup>1</sup> in legend, it has the most Yin and is also the most vicious; it's immensely destructive. To be able to tame this type of spirit beast, its master has to have enough Yang energy; not just anyone can handle this type of spirit beast."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(From the Chinese cartoon series "Under One Person.")</dfn>

    <p>While Lao Gudong was expounding on this, he kept everyone guessing by not explaining what on earth this spirit beast actually was. Now, the atmosphere had turned ridiculously mysterious. "Wu Zhenjun must have gone through a lot to tame this spirit beast. The reason why he has summoned it now is to complete Irascible Dharmaraja's ultimate move from back then with the help of the power from the purple lightning. This is a level six sound wave spell created by Irascible Dharmaraja, and the conditions for learning this spell are very harsh."</p>

    <p>By the time he said all this, the black spring gushing out of the summoning array had already covered every corner of the arena; it was flooded with purple lightning and there was nowhere to step.</p>

    <p>This had been deliberate on Wu Zhenjun's part, since he knew that Wang Ming was relying on the armor's strength to stay afloat, which consumed spirit power; sustained combat in midair would double this consumption.</p>

    <p>Wu Zhenjun's strategy was very clear.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling One, activate full magnetic shield."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming immediately gave the command for the magnetic shield to protect him so that he wouldn't be affected by the purple lightning on the ground.</p>

    <p>He conceded that if he had been wearing the first version of the armor, which had been simple and crude, there was no way he would be able to continually consume spirit power like this.</p>

    <p>At that moment, the ground started to tremble.</p>

    <p>Ripples started to form on the black pool...</p>

    <p>The summoned spirit beast hiding inside finally started to show itself.</p>

    <p>It was a massive and glossy black tail, and at first glance, it looked like a fish.</p>

    <p>Someone cried out in surprise, "Holy shit?! A swamp eel?!"</p>

    <p>Wu Zhenjun was incensed. "... It's an electric eel! Electric eel!!!"</p>
