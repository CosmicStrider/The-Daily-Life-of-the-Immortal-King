  <h1>Chapter 787 Huaxiu Alliance's Regulations for Self-Defense in a Crisis</h1>

  <div>

    <p>As an ordinary person, Wang Ming had proven that even if you were a muggle without a gift for cultivation, you could use your own wisdom and knowledge to change your destiny!</p>

    <p>Of course, the truth was that people like Wang Ming were still in the minority, and it might not be possible for someone like him to show up for another several millennia. But ordinary people were indeed capable of changing their destiny. The point wasn't whether they could, but whether they wanted to.</p>

    <p>"By the by, the mecha armor which Wang Ming this kid invented wasn't destroyed, was it?" While General Yi's words seemed dubious, his tone was very certain.</p>

    <p>At that time, many people had been blinded by the radiance from the pulse wave produced by the Heavenly E-Satellite. When the light faded, the majority saw that Wang Ming and Wu Zhenjun had already fallen to the ground.</p>

    <p>But this couldn't fool a True Immortal's eyes.</p>

    <p>General Yi and the other Ten Generals had seen it very clearly.</p>

    <p>The instant the pulse wave's power and light dissipated, Wang Ming had recalled the Wang Ling One armor and put it away inside his storage space; unlike what everyone else thought, this suit of armor hadn't been destroyed by the pulse wave.</p>

    <p>"Mm, it indeed wasn't." President Qi nodded.</p>

    <p>"As a government researcher, Wang Ming this kid developed this suit of armor without prior notice. According to Huaxiu Alliance's regulations, it should be confiscated, and it seems that Wang Ming will need to be punished," General Yi said.</p>

    <p>"Blademaster is as strict and honest as ever."</p>

    <p>Medicine Saint Luo Qiuhuai smiled on the side and said in a mollifying tone, "But considering how sudden this incident was, Wang Ming developed this suit of armor during a life-threatening crisis. Although he didn't give prior notice, according to 'Huaxiu Alliance's Regulations for Self-Defense in a Crisis,' he can be exempted from the corresponding punishment, and even the armor may not be confiscated - it is his personal belonging and Huaxiu Alliance has no right to interfere."</p>

    <p>General Yi's eyebrows formed a knot again.</p>

    <p>Actually, he understood this reasoning.</p>

    <p>"Little Ming won this battle. But at the very last moment, he chose to play dead. All of you should know why..." President Qi said lightly.</p>

    <p>How could the Ten Generals not know the implication of Wang Ming's behavior?</p>

    <p>Despite the huge gap in realm and strength, this high-tech suit of armor had bridged that distant until they were almost on equal footing.</p>

    <p>If Wang Ming ultimately achieved a clear and decisive victory in this fight in front of everyone, it would undoubtedly have a huge psychological impact on the teachers and students watching, and might even lead to some mental issues.</p>

    <p>A cultivator's mental state was also a very important deciding factor in their cultivation, which would directly determine whether they could walk even further down the path of cultivation.</p>

    <p>If this suit of armor conversely caused the teachers and students present to stop moving forward in the future and to try relying on the power of science and technology to quickly improve their strength, that would truly be too unrealistic.</p>

    <p>Wu Zhenjun had also collapsed.</p>

    <p>At the very least, Wang Ming had deliberately turned this match into a draw and demonstrated that neither cultivation nor science were inferior to each other, but were mutually complementary.</p>

    <p>"Little Ming once said to me that science is dead, but cultivation is alive... the possibilities for the latter are endless," President Qi said.</p>

    <p>This statement which Wang Ming had once said was one of the important reasons why he had brought this situation to a draw.</p>

    <p>Although Old Qi himself didn't know why a muggle who couldn't cultivate would assert this great principle like he was pouring out chicken soup for the soul, it could be said that this statement was something Wang Ming had experienced for himself since young.</p>

    <p>The suit of armor which Wang Ming had developed this time was certainly very unusual.</p>

    <p>It could fight a level nine Itinerant Immortal to a draw.</p>

    <p>But if Wang Ming encountered someone just a little stronger, his equipment would be torn apart in minutes.</p>

    <p>Given the current level of science and technology, it was actually at a bottleneck.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ming had already considered the issue of breaking through this bottleneck when he was upgrading "Wang Ling One" for the third time.</p>

    <p>He felt that the Domain of the Gods definitely had the answers he was searching for.</p>

    <p>But that was a story for later...</p>

    <p>"What do the rest of you think?" General Yi turned to look at the other Ten Generals.</p>

    <p>"What Qiuhuai and Old Qi said isn't unreasonable. Wang Ming can be excused from being punished, and can also keep the armor. I think he should even be given a commendation." Looking at the others, Marshal Jiang finally cleared his throat and spoke on their behalf.</p>

    <p>"A commendation?"</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>Marshal Jiang said categorically, "For Wang Ming, this was originally a situation in which death was imminent, but he turned it on its head through his own efforts. And most importantly, in the middle of such a crisis, he actually managed to composedly design this type of futuristic suit of armor in the face of death. I believe this is worthy of commendation, and we should then have an internal review where Wang Ming can share how he made this armor."</p>

    <p>General Yi was taken aback. "Are you the devil?"</p>

    <p>Marshal Jiang: "..."</p>

    <p>The Ten Generals darted looks at Marshal Jiang, and instantly understood.</p>

    <p>This was just another form of confiscation...</p>

    <p>Marshal Jiang gave a shrug. "Of course, it's just a suggestion. Commendation or not, review or not, these can be discussed separately. The point is that Wang Ming doesn't have to be punished, nor hand over his armor. Mm... That's all I wanted to say."</p>

    <p>"The Dead Sea of Space has long been called the tomb of magic treasures, and all the major nations' use of it has always been very limited. Many of them, including our country, regard the Dead Sea of Space merely as a dumping ground. But this is proof that some of these magic treasure scraps, whether thrown in or sucked in by accident, are actually still useful. If the Dead Sea of Space can be properly exploited and these abundant scraps retrieved for use, by turning trash into treasure... this is a secret goldmine."</p>

    <p>President Qi gave his opinion. "So my suggestion is that we can have the review, not for Little Ming to share how he made the armor, but for him to talk about the Dead Sea of Space. At the same time, he can explain how that Dark Network member Ghost Head Blade died. What do you say, Old Yi?"</p>

    <p>"Mm, since Battle Saint and Medicine Saint have spoken, this old man naturally has no other objections." General Yi nodded in agreement.</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade was now a corpse in the Dead Sea of Space. If this news got out, it was bound to be a huge blow to the Dark Network.</p>

    <p>"Finally, as for the commendation that Battle Saint mentioned, I don't think it's necessary. Wang Ming this brat is still a good-for-nothing, we can't praise him too much. And honestly speaking, I'm still going to punish him... ultimately, it was still because he was too rash that this type of crisis came about this time! This reckless youngster!" Speaking up to this point, President Qi smacked the table, his red face making him seem angry.</p>

    <p>The technical staff one after another bent their heads to their work and didn't dare make a sound.</p>

    <p>Only the Ten Generals were clear as a mirror in their hearts...</p>

    <p>While Old Qi's expression seemed unruffled like the surface of an old well, his heart was in fact bursting with happiness.</p>

    <p>Since time immemorial, there was no teacher who wouldn't be delighted when their disciple surpassed them!</p>

    <p>But President Qi had to restrain himself; no matter how red his face got, he couldn't show it...</p>
