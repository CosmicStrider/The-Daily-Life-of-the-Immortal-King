  <h1>Chapter 157 A Large Roulingzhi in the Air! </h1>

  <div>



    <p>In the heart of the city stood a magnificent building.</p>

    <p>The office of the Lord of Mo Immortal Castle's secretary, the Lady of the Castle, was on the top floor. The huge French windows offered a panoramic view of the city, and especially in the evening, the night lights in the city's central district could make a person feel nostalgic.</p>

    <p>It was eight o'clock in the morning.</p>

    <p>A woman with her hair pinned up and wearing black old-fashioned attire stood in front of a window, her eyebrows knitted and her gaze a little blank.</p>

    <p>Upon reaching the office, the Lady had received bad news — her subordinate Ah You's life sign had disappeared!</p>

    <p>Everyone who worked at Mo Immortal Castle had their souls branded by the Lord, which allowed them to be monitored using a unique life detector. If a life sign suddenly disappeared, it meant one of two things: either the soul brand had been cleansed, or the person was dead...</p>

    <p>The Lady of the Castle had been well aware of Ah You's plan since it had been her idea to send Ah You to take revenge on Song Qingshu.</p>

    <p>In the end, both Song Qingshu and Ah You's soul brands had disappeared!</p>

    <p>Just because of one Song Qingshu, she had actually lost her two beloved generals...</p>

    <p>The Lady of the Castle found it hard to accept this result.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, she didn't dare assume that Song Qingshu was truly dead.</p>

    <p>According to the life detector, Song Qingshu's soul brand had vanished, but they couldn't rule out the possibility that this guy might have found a way to remove it.</p>

    <p>While she was pondering this, the clear glass of the French window turned hazy. Seeing the black shadow that appeared in the window, the Lady's eyes widened and she bowed slightly with some trepidation. "Lord!"</p>

    <p>As the black shadow spoke, its voice echoed repeatedly as it seemed to come out of an ethereal void. "I see that Song Qingshu's soul brand has disappeared. Is he dead then?"</p>

    <p>Lowering her head, the Lady of the Castle solemnly answered, "We have yet to confirm it."</p>

    <p>"This time, because of a mere foot soldier, we've again lost two top generals. You must reflect on this..."</p>

    <p>"Yes, Lord."</p>

    <p>The Lady clasped her fists in a salute to the black shadow. "This subordinate will uncover the truth as soon as possible. I'll personally bring people to investigate right away. If Song Qingshu is truly dead, we should be able to find traces of the body-dissolving fluid at the coordinates where his life sign vanished."</p>

    <p>"Actually, I had always suspected that there was someone supporting him behind the scenes. The deaths of Great Saint and Second Saint back then, as well as Third Saint's betrayal, is a warning to us. You must be very careful this time. From now on, no more mistakes are allowed in my Mo Immortal Castle..."</p>

    <p>"Lord, please rest assured. Even if there is someone behind Song Qingshu, not just anyone can shake Mo Immortal Castle's current foundations — given the Lord's strength, as long as we can find the stone ghost mask, it'll only be a matter of time before you conquer the world."</p>

    <p>The Lord nodded. "Mm, the matter of the stone ghost mask must be clearly investigated as soon as possible."</p>

    <p>Just then, the black shadow of the Lord on the French window unexpectedly shuddered, and then there was a miserable "Ah!" cry in the void. Right after that, the black shadow didn't even say farewell before directly dissipating into nothingness.</p>

    <p>The Lady of the Castle was completely dumbfounded!</p>

    <p>Had the Lord come under attack?</p>

    <p>"Lord? Lord?"</p>

    <p>The Lady tried to call him twice.</p>

    <p>After about ten seconds or so, the black shadow reappeared on the French window, and she heard the voice of the Lord in the void once again. "...It was nothing, just a little accident. My long range projector ran out of battery! The newbie forgot to charge it last night, and he even spilled coffee on my pants! Fortunately, they're waterproof!"</p>

    <p>The Lady: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Considering the relationship between Headmaster Jin of Number 59 High School and Headmaster Chen of Number 60 High School, both of whom were from the same sect, the relationship between the two schools was actually quite close. It was just that over the last few years, the students had started to become more competitive with each other. However, since the last spirit sword exchange meet, the relationship between the two schools had improved significantly.</p>

    <p>Somehow, Wang Ling felt very strange seeing He Bufeng and Tang Jingze again.</p>

    <p>In Number 59 High School back then, one had been the fearsome Senior Buliang, and the other was the president of the student union who had always been able to find fault with others. After the four-day spirit sword exchange meet, both their bad dispositions had similarly disappeared. Since then, they had embarked on the study road day after day, sticking to the path of cultivation core values.</p>

    <p>The first two classes in the morning were Teacher Pan's Dao talismans course.</p>

    <p>The pace of study in both schools was pretty much the same. There was no pressure for He Bufeng to learn at all, while Tang Jingze was an old senior who was about to graduate, and so knew the high school curriculum like the back of his hand.</p>

    <p>"After the first few weeks of study, I believe everyone has an appropriate understanding of the four main talismans. The focus of the midterm exam will be the guiding talisman, which is a function-type talisman. Today, I'm going to talk to you about utilizing the extended functions of talismans."</p>

    <p>At this point, everyone basically already knew that Teacher Pan was going to start teaching outside of the class syllabus again.</p>

    <p>"What I'm going to talk to you about today is the meditation talisman."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Wang Ling couldn't help raising his eyebrow. This was a talisman that was very difficult to make. Meditation could project something relevant from the future into the air and help a person gain some enlightenment on what would be in store for them. But the chances of succeeding in this was extremely low due to the high degree of difficulty involved in making the meditation talisman.</p>

    <p>After mixing cinnabar and spirit water together, Teacher Pan spread open the yellow talisman paper and began to conduct a preliminary demonstration. She focused her spirit energy into the writing brush and furrowed her brow as she carefully wrote on the yellow paper to ensure that there was no mistake in the sigils — the slightest error could directly lead to the meditation talisman not working.</p>

    <p>After about three minutes, Teacher Pan put the brush aside and injected spirit energy into the yellow talisman. "Everyone, watch carefully..."</p>

    <p>A moment later, the yellow talisman danced in the air and projected the image of a pretty, colorful skirt, which was a little out of sync with Teacher Pan's solemn and staid style...</p>

    <p>She pushed up her glasses. "This is a magic skirt that I bought on Moubao <sup>1</sup> a few days ago."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Moubao is probably a play on
Taobao, the giant Chinese
online shopping website.)</dfn>

    <p>The demonstration had been successful, but what did the pretty skirt symbolize? Even Teacher Pan herself wasn't very clear on what kind of story would happen around the skirt. The meditation talisman could show keys things of the future, but a person had to use their imagination to guess what they represented.</p>

    <p>After that, Teacher Pan distributed a set of tools for making talismans to each student. "Now, students, try it for yourselves based on the earlier procedure."</p>

    <p>The classroom erupted in activity once again.</p>

    <p>The spell for the meditation talisman was intricate and really tested a person's finesse at writing; if the thickness of the written sigils was just a little different, the spell could fail.</p>

    <p>Even Tang Jingze, the old senior from Number 59 High School, had wasted several sheets of yellow talisman papers, and he couldn't help but frown; this was too difficult!</p>

    <p>But in an inadvertent attempt, the yellow talisman on Guo Hao's desk suddenly hummed and gave out a burst of light.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao looked at the floating yellow talisman in disbelief. "Did... did I do it?"</p>

    <p>Everyone's eyes were fixed on the air... a brief moment later, a faint image appeared.</p>

    <p>"What's this?"</p>

    <p>Lin Xiaoyu stared curiously at the object that had appeared; it looked a lot like a mushroom fungus with a head on both ends. The top was shaped like a mouth, while there was a small hole in the bottom, and the entire thing looked very glossy...</p>

    <p>"..." When all the boys saw it, they were immediately stunned.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao coughed. "Do you know the taisui mushroom? This thing is our family's ancestral roulingzhi <sup>2</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is based on a hilarious
story where a local reporter
had been sent to a small
village to investigate a
strange fungi-like object
which villagers had dug up.
A villager claimed it was a
type of lingzhi mushroom
called the taisui. What the
villagers and reporter didn't
realize was that this
mystery mushroom was in
fact a masturbation toy with
an artificial vagina on one
end and an artificial anus on
the other. Needless to say,
after the news report aired,
it was an instant hit, and
the word roulingzhi, or
'fleshy lingzhi mushroom,'
was coined in recognition of
this comedy gold ..)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..." I cannot fucking believe you!</p>
