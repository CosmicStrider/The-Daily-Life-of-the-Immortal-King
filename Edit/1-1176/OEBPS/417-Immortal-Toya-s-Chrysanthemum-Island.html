  <h1>Chapter 417 Immortal Toya's Chrysanthemum Island </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Dharmaraja was in despair and deeply regretted his impudence while the chat group were in despair and deeply disappointed at how slow he was... Now they finally knew why it was Dharmaraja who had encountered this stroke of bad luck with Ling Zhenren out of all the people in the group!</p>

    <p>"Senior Dharmaraja, when you're free next week, come straight to my family's noodles shop; I'll have someone pack the thing for you so that you can directly take it there." After typing this message, Fang Xing smiled as he gazed at the screen. "Senior Ling will definitely like it."</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja: "Many thanks to Brother Fang Xing! Come by my shop next time, and I'll give you electrotherapy free of charge!"</p>

    <p>Fang Xing: "..."</p>

    <p>At that moment, a system notification popped up. <em>"Immortal Two" has joined the group chat...</em></p>

    <p>This brand new name startled everyone in the group...</p>

    <p>Immortal Two? Who was that?</p>

    <p>It wasn't just the group's creator that could add people; anyone else in the group could do it.</p>

    <p>And this Immortal Two had been added by Cailian Zhenren.</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren: "Let me introduce Immortal Two to you. I've added him here and also to the main group... this is actually Senior Ling's family spirit beast."</p>

    <p>When she said this, a lot of people already understood, since many of them had seen Er Ha before.</p>

    <p>Er Ha had a phone, but it was an old model which Father Wang had given him. Nonetheless, it had all the functions of a smartphone. This phone had helped Er Ha tremendously in learning the basics of language. Last month, while the old man had been out buying groceries, he had helped apply for a SIM card for Er Ha.</p>

    <p>Er Ha had also applied for a chat group account the other day; watching Wang Ling chatting with this gang everyday, it had felt that it was really fun, which was why it had decided to get involved; even that silver unicorn was in this group, so Er Ha thought that there was no need to hide itself away.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had talked to Cailian Zhenren about Er Ha joining the main group, so it had been let in directly.</p>

    <p>In front of the screen, Er Ha typed, "Hello, everyone."</p>

    <p>"Hello, Immortal Two!"</p>

    <p>"Hi, Immortal Two!"</p>

    <p>Everyone greeted Er Ha one after another.</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja: "Immortal Two, are you as green as ever?"</p>

    <p>When Dharmaraja said this, it suddenly became deathly silent in the group.</p>

    <p>Er Ha broke out in a sweat. "..."</p>

    <p>To put it nicely, Dharmaraja had a frank and outspoken personality, but it was just another way of saying that he lacked EQ. He was lucky that he was living in a lawful society in an era of peace; in the olden days, he would have been beaten to death...</p>

    <p>Fang Xing: "Senior Dharmaraja, don't tell me you haven't realized how severe the problem is? Why do you think Immortal Two joined our group?"</p>

    <p>"...Brother Fang Xing, please advise me." Dharmaraja didn't dare say more as he sent an emoji wiping at sweat.</p>

    <p>He had only been joking, and hadn't expected this awkward silence!</p>

    <p>Gazing at the screen, Fang Xing smiled slightly. "Obviously, Senior Ling doesn't want to talk to you now, and threw a dog at you!"</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren: "..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "Excuse me, Senior Immortal just texted me. He's going to arrive at my island very soon, and I'm going to go welcome him. If I have any new information, I'll let everyone know..."</p>

    <p>After sending this message, Immortal Toya swiftly closed the chat window and breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>For some reason, he had smelled a hint of gunpowder just now...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In fact, Lord Diulei had yet to reach the island, but Immortal Toya calculated that he was probably on his way.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei had been here before, but before he could properly enter the island, Immortal Toya had always arranged for his young attendants to meet him. That was because Lord Diulei always came at a bad time, when Immortal Toya was refining elixirs.</p>

    <p>"This time I'll invite Senior Immortal in first and see what the situation's like." In front of his furnace, Immortal Toya frowned.</p>

    <p>He was plotting how to tactfully and offhandedly ask who on earth the female owner of the ring was...</p>

    <p>Chrysanthemum Island wasn't an island on a sea, but a lake. Yunlan Lake was six hundred li south of the outskirts of Songhai city, and Chrysanthemum Island was in the middle of the lake. Chrysanthemum Island wasn't large, but it was Immortal Toya's residence in Songhai city. This azure lake and the ten li of black bamboo forest around it were his private property.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya's family had purchased this land a long time ago, and in this generation, the deed had been passed down to him.</p>

    <p>When Lord Diulei drew close to the black bamboo forest, he could already see a boy and a girl of around twelve to thirteen years old and at the Foundation Establishment stage waiting for him, and his eyes lit up.</p>

    <p>"Hello Senior Immortal!"</p>

    <p>"Senior Immortal!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei smiled. "Hello, since the last time I saw you, your spirit roots seem to be purer than ever."</p>

    <p>These two attendants were a pair of abandoned brother and sister whom Immortal Toya had picked up and brought back to Chrysanthemum Island to become his disciples a dozen or so years ago. Later, he had given them names: the brother was Jin Shi and the younger sister was Yin Shi <sup>1</sup>.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(These are the Chinese pronunciations of the names Kintoki and Gintoki, characters in the manga series 'Gintama.')</dfn>

    <p>"This is thanks to <em>shifu </em>."</p>

    <p>The brother Jin Shi smiled and bowed. "The last few times you dropped by, it was truly unfortunate that our <em>shifu </em>was refining elixirs, so he sent us to greet you instead. This time, he happens to be free, and he specially invites Senior Immortal to meet him on his island."</p>

    <p>"That's great! I have yet to visit Brother To's Chrysanthemum Island." Lord Diulei laughed.</p>

    <p>"Senior Immortal, please follow us."</p>

    <p>The sister Yin Shi nodded, her face wreathed in smiles as she walked through the black bamboo forest.</p>

    <p>Following behind them, Lord Diulei couldn't help feeling deeply moved in his heart; this pair of twins had been taught well. Each time he came, especially in recent years, they always showed improvement.</p>

    <p>When they had been picked up as young children, their bodies had been so frail that they hadn't been able to cultivate at all, and their spirit roots had even been on the verge of breaking down. But now, they had reached the Foundation Establishment stage at only thirteen, which was faster than those second rich generation kids who took drugs to advance their realms.</p>

    <p>He had heard that Immortal Toya had researched and developed a formula unique to the Toya family that encompassed the Physical Build, Qi Condensation and Foundation Establishment stages; not only could it restore a damaged spirit root to the way it was before, it could accelerate the cultivation process.</p>

    <p>Crucially, the most distinctive thing about this formula was that there were no side effects to the vitality generated, meaning that even if it accelerated cultivation, it wouldn't have the slightest impact on a person's foundation.</p>

    <p>In the cultivation circle, many rich second generation kids were lazy to cultivate, and relied on drugs to reach the Foundation Establishment stage. The biggest problem for this group had to do with their foundation; they might have the realm level, but it was little more than an empty "structure" full of air!</p>

    <p>As far as Lord Diulei knew, this unique formula which belonged to Immortal Toya's family hadn't been made public yet. He himself had only known about it when Immortal Toya had mentioned it before while they were having tea.</p>

    <p>Now, looking at the changes in the bodies of these two, Lord Diulei thought that the manufacture of the formula was close at hand. Once it was announced and Immortal Toya applied for a patent, regardless of the wealth it gained him, it would be the perfect conclusion to a virtuous undertaking!</p>

    <p>Seeing the two attendants talk and laugh together as they led the way, Lord Diulei also felt happy since he had witnessed their growth.</p>

    <p>"You look like you have a good sibling relationship." Lord Diulei smiled.</p>

    <p>Jin Shi turned his head and replied with a smile, "Actually, we did argue before, and they were pretty bad fights. But <em>shifu </em>would teach us each time that siblings should love one another."</p>

    <p>His little sister Yin Shi followed up on what he said: "Our spirit roots actually hadn't completely recovered back then. <em>Shifu </em>said that during this time, we had to keep our spirits up, so our communication has changed a lot in recent years!"</p>

    <p>"How do you communicate with each other?"</p>

    <p>Jin Shi and Yin Shi spoke in unison, "For example, we bathe together at night!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>It had just been a casual question, but Lord Diulei felt like someone had dropped a bombshell on him!</p>
