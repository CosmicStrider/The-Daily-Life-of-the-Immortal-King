  <h1>Chapter 321 Brother, Give Me a Light </h1>

  <div>

    <p>When Father Wang arrived at the gate of Number 60 High School, it was the first time that he was alarmed by such a scene. To be honest, it gave him a sense of deja vu. Back when Wang Ling had just entered kindergarten, there had also been a large crowd of parents standing at the kindergarten's front gate when school was over.</p>

    <p>But since then, Father Wang had no longer dropped Wang Ling off at kindergarten. During that time, Wang Ling had been targeted by quite a number of child traffickers because of his cute looks; in the end, the day he had been kidnapped was the day that the entire human trafficking ring had been exterminated. In the time since Wang Ling started kindergarten to when he graduated primary school, he set a record for exterminating thousands of human trafficking rings.</p>

    <p>And with regard to this matter, both the Wang family's father and son kept their lips sealed and told no one about it — hiding the accomplishments and fame.</p>

    <p>Thus, personally coming to pick Wang Ling up this time gave Father Wang a faint sense of nostalgia. He hadn't planned to come, but on one hand, Teacher Pan had personally called him this time, and on the other hand, this marvelous scene was indeed happening at Number 60 High School's front gate, with a lot of parents even dragging the rest of the family with them to come and pick up their kids. Other parents had all come; if he was the only one who didn't show up, it would definitely look a little strange.</p>

    <p>Pushing his black-rimmed glasses up, Father Wang walked into the crowd with his hands in his pockets, then realized that while the scene looked chaotic, the parents were actually in a queue.</p>

    <p>The reason why it looked chaotic was that there were some parents who had also brought their sect followers or disciples for the sake of keeping up appearances. While the parents queued up, the disciples surrounded the perimeter, so everything looked disorderly.</p>

    <p>Looking at the long line that snaked out in front of him, Father Wang sighed deeply. He had never been subjected to a grievance like this except for when he calmly waited in the long lines at the annual comic convention.</p>

    <p>The process was obviously rather slow since the teachers at the school gate had to check the parents' identities one by one before calling out the numbers. Some of the parents waited impatiently with deep frowns on their faces.</p>

    <p>Many of the parents in line were distinguished figures who definitely had their own personal affairs to see to, but no one cursed irritably or urged the teachers to be quicker.</p>

    <p>It was moments like this that often reflected a person's nature.</p>

    <p>For the sake of making sure that the students returned home safely, the school teachers themselves had delayed getting off work on time, and instead remained at school to do overtime... they had done this much, what could anyone say? Who could complain?</p>

    <p>Father Wang stood quietly at the very end of the line, but he didn't feel bored. Writing came from life, and sometimes it was good to come out and collect source material for characters; this could probably be considered an occupational disease.</p>

    <p>He didn't have a high realm and was only at the early Qi Condensation stage. But even if his level wasn't high, he could still differentiate between strong and weak auras based on careful observation. For example, he thought that the middle-aged man standing in front of him at the moment wasn't simple.</p>

    <p>The man looked very rough; he had a beautiful beard and was dressed in traditional attire. He walked with his head high and his back straight, and there were several kitchen knives tucked around his waist. A person could tell with one look that he was a sect leader.</p>

    <p>Father Wang took the initiative to come forward and pat the man on the shoulder. "Brother, are you here to pick up your kid, too?"</p>

    <p>As he spoke, Father Wang noticed many of the young men around them, who were attired in a similar way to the man in front of him, shift their gazes one by one to look at him. In his heart, he confirmed the man's identity once again.</p>

    <p>Father Wang knew very well that they were probably this person's disciples.</p>

    <p>"Ah?"</p>

    <p>The middle-aged man hadn't expected anyone to speak to him of their own accord. He was taken aback at first, then turned his head to look at Father Wang before he replied offhandedly, "Mm..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang wasn't tall, and didn't even reach the man's shoulder. He even had to tilt his head up a little to speak to him. The contrast in their physiques was striking.</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "Is your son in the regular class or the elite class?"</p>

    <p>The middle-aged man's face darkened instantly. "..." This was just rubbing it in!</p>

    <p>His greatest fear was that someone would ask this question.</p>

    <p>He was Head of Kitchen Knife Sect, but his son had only been able to enter a regular class. This really wasn't funny.</p>

    <p>Hence, this head of Kitchen Knife Sect chose to keep quiet in that moment. He thought that as long as he didn't reply, this person should probably stop asking more questions.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, the person he was facing was Father Wang.</p>

    <p>It could only be said that Father Wang was in the end Father Wang. As a veteran web novelist, whenever he encountered a problem while he was collecting material for inspiration, he would fully display his indomitable spirit.</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "Brother? Why aren't you speaking?"</p>

    <p>Head of Kitchen Knife Sect: "..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang patted the man on the shoulder. "It's okay, we're all parents. We're in line right now, why don't we talk about our how kids are doing in their studies? My kid just entered school this year and his performance in the entrance exam was an aberration."</p>

    <p>An aberration?</p>

    <p>The head of Kitchen Knife Sect was instantly delighted. "Did your son also enter the regular class because of an aberration?"</p>

    <p>Father Wang shook his head. "No... he's in the elite class."</p>

    <p>The head of Kitchen Knife Sect just wanted to roar. "..." Then why are you complaining?!</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "My son is quite introverted. I thought that if he was in the elite class, he might eventually develop a sense of inferiority from being around a group of remarkable children. Hence, I initially wanted him to enter a regular class or a remedial class."</p>

    <p>When he said this, Father Wang sighed. "Who knew, this guy ended up performing out of the ordinary! I just wanted him to be a bad student!"</p>

    <p>Head of Kitchen Knife Sect: ???</p>

    <p>How was this just a fucking aberration? This was already an abnormality by far! What parent nowadays longed for their children to be bad students rather than dragons and phoenixes? At that moment, the head of Kitchen Knife Sect deeply felt that he had encountered a very strange parent, and he instantly didn't want to talk any longer.</p>

    <p>Continuing to talk with this person would just make him unhappy.</p>

    <p>But when the middle-aged man was turning his head away, he saw out of the corner of his eye that Father Wang had taken out a small notebook and a pen, and seemed to recording something down...</p>

    <p>It was impossible that this grand head of Kitchen Knife Sect wouldn't have sharp eyes. Narrowing them, he could clearly see the words Father Wang had written in his notebook. It said — Source Material One: Head of Kitchen Knife Sect, a burly man with a tough and stocky build; wears several kitchen knives around his waist; frequently distressed about the fact that his son is in a regular class. From a preliminary personality assessment, this person is probably a true tsundere...</p>

    <p>Seeing this, the corners of the middle-aged man's mouth twitched violently and he got a little angry. "You... who are you..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang pushed up his black-rimmed glasses with poise. "My apologies, brother, I'm collecting material for inspiration; this is my job as a web novelist."</p>

    <p>Head of Kitchen Knife Sect: "..."</p>

    <p>Just then, Father Wang took out a black cigar from his pocket and stuck it in his mouth.</p>

    <p>Then, he looked at the middle-aged man with a calm expression and said, "Brother, do you have a light? Lend me a light!"</p>

    <p>The middle-aged man had been trembling with anger, but the moment he saw the cigar, he calmed down immediately... This cigar was at the level of a national treasure! Only people at that level would have it! He looked at Father Wang in shock, his face pale. Who the hell was this man?</p>
