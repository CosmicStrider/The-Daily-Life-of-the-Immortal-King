  <h1>Chapter 485 Ling Zhenren Decides to Join the Battle </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Daoist Guang and Lord Diulei were waiting for Wang Ling's message in the group chat. Daoist Guang had even paused the live stream. His water friends thought that he'd gone to the toilet, so they didn't rush him, and the bullet messages were all still cheerful.</p>

    <p>It wasn't hard to notice that Daoist Guang's fans, "Light Chasers," were actually very civilized.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, users who sent bullet message were becoming younger and younger, and if many of the bullet messages weren't starting a fight, then they were sent by reverse fans setting the tone, which was very unsightly. This proved that having a group of high-class fans was actually very important.</p>

    <p>The two of them didn't wait long before Wang Ling sent a screenshot to the chat group... It was of the official PUBG download manager, and it was already halfway done with the download!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was stunned. "Brother Ling, are you going to take part? You hardly play games..."</p>

    <p>Alright...</p>

    <p>This screenshot actually already explained everything.</p>

    <p>Since becoming acquainted with Wang Ling, Lord Diulei's impression of him was that he rarely touched games; whenever he saw Wang Ling, the latter would usually be reading or studying. Lord Diulei guessed that Wang Ling's ultimate aim for deciding to "join the battle" this time was definitely to sound out the reason for Er Ha's recent abnormal behaviour.</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang was in high spirits. "It would be fantastic if Senior Ling takes part! It will definitely be much more lively. But Brother Lei is saying that senior hardly plays games?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei quickly recovered himself. "You don't have to worry about this at all, Brother Guang. Brother Ling is a very quick learner..." After all, Brother Ling had taken just ten minutes to advance from a bronze weaponsmith to a king weaponsmith. How hard could it possibly be for him to remember keyboard controls for the game?</p>

    <p>"Alright." Daoist Guang sent an "OK" emoji. "I'll choose custom mode and set up a password and invite Senior Ling and Brother Lei."</p>

    <p>"I also need to join this battle?" Lord Diulei couldn't help laughing.</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang: "I've already agreed to team up with my number one fan, and Brother Dog is bringing its friend with the surname Wei. We're doing two-player mode, and there are one hundred people in total with fifty teams. We can't ask Senior Ling to team up with a water friend..."</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang's purpose for forcefully drawing Lord Diulei into the game was actually quite simple - he was well aware that Senior Ling didn't like to talk! Once he was in the game, there really was the chance he would wind up being the lone maverick. It would be good for him to team up with someone familiar; an unfamiliar water friend might curse him out instead...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei sent a teary smile emoji. "Fine! But I haven't played this game in a very long time. It shouldn't take me too long to update it!"</p>

    <p>Phone in hand, Xiao Yin sat on a broccoli sofa in the basement as he stared intently at Lord Diulei. "Thunder, Thunder, what are you chatting about... so happy..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei raised his head and said, "Brother Ling may be coming here later to game with me and Lord Island."</p>

    <p>"Master... is coming here?!"</p>

    <p>For some reason, Xiao Yin was suddenly excited. "And you're going to play with Lord Island? You actually already know him?"</p>

    <p>"Mm... you could say I'm quite familiar with him..." Lord Diulei nodded his head.</p>

    <p>"Holy shit! Please help me get his autograph! He live streams from a remote island - it's such a boring place but he can still find something fun to do! He's my idol! I can't find anything to do at home every day!" Xiao Yin said feverishly.</p>

    <p>"An autograph? Wait, I'll ask..."</p>

    <p>After talking to Xiao Yin, Lord Diulei immediately sent Daoist Guang a message.</p>

    <p>"An autograph?"</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang replied very quickly. "I don't have any paper here. How about you ask Senior Ling to burn some paper for me later?"</p>

    <p>"Do you have any backups...?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei somehow thought it sounded very strange when he asked.</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang thought for a while and said, "Then I'll autograph a coconut."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, Er Ha and Wei Zhi had already arrived at "Xin Xing Internet Bar." The boss was a subdued-looking young man with a faint scruff and disheveled hair, as if he had just woken up.</p>

    <p>Standing at the entrance with a cigarette in his mouth, he looked at Wei Zhi and Er Ha before blowing out a perfect smoke ring. "It was Lord Island who introduced this place to you?"</p>

    <p>"That's right." Wei Zhi nodded his head.</p>

    <p>Crouching down, that young boss brushed his bangs aside and looked at Er Ha. "It's fine for you to speak, Lord Island already told me about you."</p>

    <p>Er Ha felt that this boss was a little interesting. "You don't think it's strange?"</p>

    <p>"Heh, my family has opened Internet bars for eight generations; what kind of demons and ghosts haven't we seen?"</p>

    <p>The boss smiled with the cigarette in his mouth, then fished out a key and showed Wei Zhi and Er Ha in. "Follow me."</p>

    <p>After entering, both Wei Zhi and Er Ha were startled by the open space... This Internet bar was huge!</p>

    <p>The machines in the main hall alone were already too many to count, and they were all first-rate setups. The decor was also very elegant and gave people a sense of sophistication.</p>

    <p>"There are five hundred machines in total in the main hall, and including those in the private rooms and the VIP rooms, we have over one thousand and two hundred machines." Speaking up to this point, the boss put out his cigarette and had already taken out a new one...</p>

    <p>"You should have plenty of customers, right?" asked Er Ha.</p>

    <p>"Hm..." The boss rubbed his head and said after some thought, "You are my Internet bar's fourth and fifth customers - the first three people were frightened off."</p>

    <p>"Frightened off?"</p>

    <p>"They couldn't afford the price."</p>

    <p>"How much per hour?"</p>

    <p>"Sixty."</p>

    <p>"Sixty, that's not expensive..." Given the environment and setup, Wei Zhi thought that sixty really wasn't expensive.</p>

    <p>The boss: "Immortal gold!"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi and Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Without saying anything else, this young boss showed them to a private room, above which read the fixed price: <em>One hundred immortal gold bars an hour! </em>The sixty immortal gold bars the boss had mentioned earlier was just the price for the main hall...</p>

    <p>The boss: "The two of you can use this room; I've already tested the setup for you in advance."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi smiled. "The area around Guyuan New District is still being developed, so there naturally wouldn't be many residents or customers here. Most Internet bars would kick off their business with special bargains. You might have this type of quality setup, but the price is a little expensive. And another thing, I don't understand why you would open an Internet bar here..."</p>

    <p>"Opening my own Internet bar has always been my lifelong wish! All the people in my family opened Internet bars, and they were passed down to me in this generation. I've always been a little lazier, and I'm normally too lazy to handle things. I had to handle customer data for over a thousand Internet bars, which was more than I could deal with."</p>

    <p>The boss looked very melancholy. "So I sold off my family's chain of over one thousand Internet bars and opened this one."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi and Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>The boss chuckled. "But I later realized that although things are more relaxed now, I no longer had any business. That's why I chose to collaborate with Lord Island, as rich customers will naturally drop by."</p>

    <p>Er Ha thought the boss of this Internet bar was an odd person, and was a typical case of not properly inheriting family property...</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "I have to ask, what is boss's surname?"</p>

    <p>"Ye <sup>1 </sup>."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Ye Xiu is the chain-smoking protagonist in the esports novel "The King's Avatar..")</dfn>

    <p>Leaning against the door with the cigarette in his mouth, the boss blew out a string of smoke circles.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi and Er Ha: "..."</p>
