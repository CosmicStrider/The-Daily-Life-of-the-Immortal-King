  <h1>Chapter 92 Shock! The Real Reason for the Owner's Disappearance Is... </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling had always felt that Lord Diulei, the owner of the cultivation forum, was a mystical person. There were two impressions which the old members in the group had of this owner.</p>

    <p>First, Lord Diulei, who traveled all year round, was not only knowledgeable, but also knew all kinds of funny anecdotes. As long as it was cultivation gossip, he would have almost all the details. Whose pill furnace exploded, whose mythical creature had gone missing, whose child fell into an underground cave while on holiday and found an ancient magic weapon... Lord Diulei could always turn all of these things into topics for idle conversation.</p>

    <p>Second, Lord Diulei really loved to court disaster. He was a very nosy person and Wang Ling had always felt that he had a very strong sense of cultivation brotherhood; no matter how big or small a matter was, as long as someone asked him for help and could pay a corresponding fee, Lord Diulei would lend a hand. Wang Ling knew him to be a man full of justice. The incident that left the deepest impression on him was when Lord Diulei had once accepted one HNY from a little girl whose whole family had been murdered to ensure their silence — without hesitating to offend the wrong people, he had shown up at the door of the underground criminal element, knife in one hand and killed them all.</p>

    <p>The reason Wang Ling was looking for Lord Diulei this time was actually to ask for any information he might have about the stone ghost mask. If one wanted to know any cultivation inside story, Lord Diulei was their best bet.</p>

    <p>While the group was engaged in a lively chat, Cailian Zhenren suddenly said, "It's rare for Ling Zhenren to be online, but it just so happens that Lord Diulei isn't here at the moment."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was shocked. "..." Based on his understanding of this chatterbox who liked to post trivial things whenever he had the time, even if they had now switched to a chat group, for him to not show up a few days in a row was really abnormal.</p>

    <p>Had he encountered some sort of trouble?</p>

    <p>While Wang Ling pondered this in his heart, Nine Times Man sighed. "Group owner really hasn't been online for a long time, it's been about three or four days!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was very clear on how strong Lord Diulei was; he was much stronger than Old Li, hence why he was able to travel around as he pleased. Besides, he also had an ancestral magic weapon, the "Skybomb Grenade"; its effect was five hundred times far more powerful than that of a flashbomb and also had a stun effect. Even if Lord Diulei's strength was flagging, he would always have a way to "throw a grenade" to ensure that he could escape successfully.</p>

    <p>"Does anyone have any information?" Cailian Zhenren asked in the group.</p>

    <p>She clearly knew that Ling Zhenren wouldn't have shown up if it wasn't urgent. But it had now been several days that the whereabouts of the group owner Lord Diulei was unaccounted for and she was a little worried.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya pondered for a moment, then replied, "Does anyone remember the last message sent by Lord Diulei?"</p>

    <p>Bulang Blade Immortal: "Senior Immortal said that one of his brother-in-arms had a lab which had suddenly been destroyed and he had also lost his memory, so he can't remember who on earth had done it. So Senior Immortal said he wanted to get justice for his brother, but until now there hasn't been any more news."</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling felt this seemed familiar somehow.</p>

    <p>Before he could digest this information, Bulang Blade Immortal said again, "This is actually very embarrassing. This Senior Immortal's brother actually deals in cyberintelligence."</p>

    <p>"Hacker?" asked Lightning Dharmaraja.</p>

    <p>Lightning Dharmaraja had always had an unusual interest in people's online habits. Over the years, he had used his own lightning energy to cure many degenerate youngsters who had been addicted to online games. Furthermore, every one of them ended up being promoted from worthless losers to the Foundation Establishment stage. It was said that this was all due to Lightning Dharmaraja shocking them into it.</p>

    <p>"That's right." Bulang Blade Immortal nodded. "Lord Diulei's hacker brother seemed to have been investigating some old senior. Then that person single-handedly destroyed the lab. It's said a cannon was also destroyed, I think it was called... Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon?"</p>

    <p>Looking at the chat window, Wang Ling facepalmed and was completely silent. "..."</p>

    <p>Bulang Blade Immortal seemed to have special knowledge of this matter as he continued talking. "This big cannon is amazing, it's said that Lord Diulei invented it in order to destroy the headquarters of the fake milk powder crime ring."</p>

    <p>"Fake milk powder?" Just then, Cailian Zhenren also remembered something. "I heard from Lord Diulei before about a criminal gang that specializes in selling fake milk powder. This group scams those in the general population that can't cultivate by saying that after babies drink their milk powder, they can be promoted directly to the Foundation Establishment stage. The cultivation police department issued a national orange order for their arrest not long ago."</p>

    <p>The full name of this fake milk powder group was Saint Cavalry and its members were called the Saint Milk Powder gang. Wang Ling had recently heard a lot about it on the way to school.</p>

    <p>Although Saint Cavalry wasn't strong overall, what was frightening about them was the fervor of their milk powder pyramid scheme; they had only appeared for just three months, but their member numbers and scale of development had already surpassed many criminal organizations which had taken years or even decades to set up. Apart from Shadow Stream, they were the only other criminal organization which the cultivation police department had felt compelled to issue an arrest warrant for, which was enough to show how serious the country was about this issue.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, many people believed that if their activities weren't effectively suppressed, the orange order would very likely be upgraded to a red order, the same as for Shadow Stream.</p>

    <p>It should be pointed out that if the people who had been cheated into buying the fake milk powder linked hands... they could fucking encircle the earth twice over!</p>

    <p>Listening to the group conversation, Wang Ling was lost in deep thought. He admitted that he had gone a little overboard; Uncle Black had only been doing the Zhuo family a favor in return for what they had done for him and hadn't had any malicious intentions. Instead, Wang Ling had messed up his lab and had now given criminals a chance to wreak havoc.</p>

    <p>He sighed in his heart. Later on, he would have to think of a way to make it up to Lord Diulei and that Little Black.</p>

    <p>Directly apologize? No way...</p>

    <p>Given the current buzz around the fake milk powder scandal, people in the group were naturally starting to worry about Lord Diulei's safety since he had already disappeared for a few days.</p>

    <p>"Do you think it's possible that group owner has been kidnapped by this Saint Milk Powder gang? Pyramid schemes nowadays are crazy!" Nine Times Man threw out his speculation.</p>

    <p>"If so, the situation is very dangerous."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya said, "I suggest waiting a while longer — if Lord Diulei still isn't online after twenty-four hours, we'll dial 110!"</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren also agreed. "Yes! If there's a problem, look for group owner; if group owner has a problem, look for the police! No problem!"</p>

    <p>Just as everyone was discussing this, the group chat window shook —"Group Owner: Lord Diulei is now online"!</p>

    <p>"Bloody hell?! Online? I didn't misread that, right?" Nine Times Man sent a surprised Tuzki <sup>1</sup> emoji.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Tuzki is a popular bunny emoticon character widely used in various messaging app platforms ..)</dfn>

    <p>"It really is Lord Diulei!"</p>

    <p>"Lord Diulei, you've been offline for several days, the group was discussing whether or not you had been kidnapped by an underground organization," said Bulang Blade Immortal.</p>

    <p>Everyone quietly waited for Lord Diulei's reply.</p>

    <p>A moment later, the group exploded with a foul-mouthed voice message which Lord Diulei had tossed out. "Fuck! You don't know how badly destroyed my brother's lab is! This isn't even the most irritating thing! It was bad enough the asshole who did it destroyed the equipment, but even the WIFI didn't escape damage! There was no signal at all over there! No WIFI! Bloody fuck!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
