  <h1>Chapter 985 The Plot to Wipe Out Research Institutes All Over the World</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Zhai Yin's injuries were severe and she was drenched in blood. It seemed it had taken the last of her willpower to reach the noodle shop and look for Wang Ming. The moment she arrived and saw that Wang Ming was safe, it was as if a weight was finally lifted off her shoulders, and she fainted, her face bloodless.</p>

    <p>Guo Ping rushed over in dismay. "She's close to dying... She's lost a lot of blood!"</p>

    <p>At the same time, he was deeply shaken by Zhai Yin's willpower. As expected of Zhai Yin - it wasn't just anyone who would be able to make it here while bleeding so severely.</p>

    <p>The situation was serious, and Wang Ling was about to help when Er Ha suddenly emerged from under a table to straightaway use the Toad clan's Swallowing Spell on Zhai Yin.</p>

    <p>After swallowig Zhai Yin, Er Ha burped. "Little master, you don't have to do anything; I can save her."</p>

    <p>"You?" Wang Ming was a little dubious.</p>

    <p>When the shadows had burst in earlier, this green-furred dog had run faster than anyone else and squeezed under a table...</p>

    <p>"You didn't come out earlier, so why are you coming out now?" Guo Ping smiled; he recalled Er Ha's terrified expression and thought it was pretty funny.</p>

    <p>"Ai, I don't know why I'm so cowardly - probably because the author forgot about me when he wrote the last chapter..." Er Ha sighed.</p>

    <p>"Can you really heal her?" asked Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>"No problem, our Tuntian Ha clan's toad oil is a natural and holy curative; it can cure internal or external injuries in an instant. From the moment my body changed, I've been storing it up, and there's enough for dozens of people," said Er Ha.</p>

    <p>After a few minutes, it opened its mouth and spat out a brand new Zhai Yin.</p>

    <p>Everything was as Er Ha said. Zhai Yin had completely recovered from her injuries, and even her complexion looked much better. In the demon world, the Tuntian Ha clan's toad oil could be directly used in trade as a top quality medicine, and part of the Tuntian Ha clan's economic network was propped up by sales of toad oil.</p>

    <p>They then used the money from selling toad oil to buy large quantities of meaty houseflies as supplementary nourishment. Houseflies were hundreds of times cheaper than toad oil, and once eaten and digested, they became brand new toad oil.</p>

    <p>This endless economic loop was like a perpetual motion machine which made money for the Tuntian Ha clan in the demon world.</p>

    <p>Immersed in the toad oil, Zhai Yin was like a baby in its mother's womb, and her internal and external injuries were healed in no time.</p>

    <p>After Er Ha spat her out, she very quickly regained consciousness and slowly opened her eyes.</p>

    <p>"She's awake!" Wang Ming was excited.</p>

    <p>Even Wang Ling had an amazed expression on his face; the toad oil was even more effective than he had imagined.</p>

    <p>"Chief Zhai, what is going on?" Guo Ping asked anxiously.</p>

    <p>He and Wang Ming had already mentally prepared themselves; given how severe Zhai Yin's injuries were, there was no doubt that the research institute was already in disarray.</p>

    <p>After the Master of Immortal Mansion Cheng Yu's arrest and the collapse of the number one dark force, plus the fact that practically all the Dark Network's criminal activities were being monitored, Wang Ming and Guo Ping truly never expected that there would be another organization powerful enough to suddenly attack the research institute with armed forces.</p>

    <p>For the other party to launch a surprise attack on the research institute just as Earth was about to establish diplomatic ties with aliens was the greatest provocation.</p>

    <p>"The research institute... almost everyone was killed, and Old Qi's whereabouts are unknown..." Zhai Yin pulled herself together and said, "They started slaughtering everyone as soon as they entered; if Wang Ming's long johns hadn't helped me deflect several fatal hits... I wouldn't have survived the first round of attacks."</p>

    <p>When she said this, Zhai Yin took the long johns out from her storage space; even though they had been enchanted by Wang Ling, this long johns divine artifact was actually unable to withstand an attack for the first time ever and was already completely destroyed, riddled as it was with holes.</p>

    <p>Even Wang Ling was a little astonished when he saw this. He never thought that there would still be this sort of power on Earth. If he had known earlier, he would've upgraded the long johns.</p>

    <p>"Who on earth launched the attack? Were they the same as this bunch in shadow suits?" Wang Ming asked as he pointed at the five on the ground.</p>

    <p>"That's right. They wore the same thing and snuck in unnoticed, which was why everyone in the research institute were hit hard..." Zhai Yin frowned. "Also, it wasn't just our institute that was attacked, but institutes all over the world were also hit..."</p>

    <p>"How can this be..." Guo Ping turned pale.</p>

    <p>"The other party's goal is already very clear: this is a plot to wipe out all the research institutes around the world; I'm afraid that all scientific researchers have fallen." Wang Ming frowned; if they hadn't been with Wang Ling this time, they would probably already be dead.</p>

    <p>"Who on earth are you?" Er Ha asked as he stepped on a shadow man.</p>

    <p>"Just kill us! We won't betray our organization."</p>

    <p>The five shadow men turned their heads to the side; they were very stubborn and wouldn't confess.</p>

    <p>If Wang Ling hadn't been quick enough, they might have already killed themselves.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling could see that they weren't afraid of death.</p>

    <p>If they could escape, they would. If not, they weren't the least bit afraid of dying.</p>

    <p>"It looks like it's no use asking them." Guo Ping analyzed the situation unhurriedly. "There are now a few issues we have to address. First: Where on earth did this group of shadow men come from, and on whose instigation?</p>

    <p>"Second: What is this power that they're using?</p>

    <p>"Third: What is the purpose behind attacking and killing scientific researchers all over the world?</p>

    <p>"Fourth: If they are just targeting scientific researchers, why did they capture Student Fang?"</p>

    <p>When Guo Ping brought up the fourth point, something suddenly struck Wang Ming and his eyes lit up. "We don't have any answers for the first three points yet, but I can think of several likely possibilities for the fourth point."</p>

    <p>Guo Ping: "What are they?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "Teacher Guo, don't tell me you've forgetten Fang Xing's true identity and background..."</p>

    <p>Guo Ping's face darkened. "Are you saying..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "Perhaps Student Fang himself has no value to them, but his father was a capable inventor under Old Devil back then. It's likely that they seized Student Fang Xing for his genes, to resurrect True Immortal She Pi... Of course, this is all conjecture right now; I still can't figure out the reason for wantonly massacring scientific researchers..."</p>

    <p>"The news is being suppressed for now, but fire can't be wrapped in paper for long..." Zhai Yin was already checking the news online at the moment.</p>

    <p>The massacre of scientific researchers on a global scale was a huge event, but if it was carelessly divulged, it could trigger panic throughout the entire cultivation world. It was for this reason that news of the event was being suppressed for now.</p>

    <p>But both Wang Ling and Wang Ming were well aware.</p>

    <p>Now that something like this had happened, they had to find a way to resolve it in the near future or it would ultimately become very hard to fix.</p>
