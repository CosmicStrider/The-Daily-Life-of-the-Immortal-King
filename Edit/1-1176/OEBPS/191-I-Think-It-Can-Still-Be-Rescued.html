  <h1>Chapter 191 I Think It Can Still Be Rescued </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling passed on his speculation telepathically to the two other people.</p>

    <p>As a result, Immortal Toya and Third Saint were flabbergasted.</p>

    <p>"No wonder the Master of Shadow Stream seemed a little weird... so she had the stone ghost mask on her? Also, based on senior's conjecture, she has already made a deal with Devil Emperor Gua Pi. So the person senior was fighting just now was actually Devil Emperor Gua Pi inside Jiang Liuyue's body?"</p>

    <p>After Immortal Toya's convincing analysis, Third Saint couldn't help breaking out in a sweat... he had actually provoked such an old devil just now. Furthermore, the other party had even said that he would remember him before he had fled.</p>

    <p>This was awkward... if the other party found an opportunity to catch him, it would be very hard for Third Saint to escape his doom.</p>

    <p>"With this, the situation has become more complicated..." Immortal Toya heaved a sigh; this matter was a lot more troublesome than he had imagined. Now that that old devil had been released, there would be no peace for Huaxiu nation in the days to come. The old devil didn't just have towering abilities, he also had concealed on him quite a few long-lost magic weapons, and he could suddenly take out one at any time to turn the tide; the purple gold fog which he had used to escape was one of them.</p>

    <p>Before that purple gold fog had appeared, Wang Ling had already opened his Heavenly Eye. This was already the ultimate level that the Eye could reach, yet he hadn't detected the fog at all. Surrounded by that fog, the devil had vanished into thin air in a blink of an eye, as if he had hidden away in another world, without leaving even the slightest trace behind.</p>

    <p>"Do you know the origin of this magic treasure?" Wang Ling asked telepathically as he tilted his head slightly to look at the two people next to him.</p>

    <p>"It looks a little like the Purple Gold Gourd..." Immortal Toya surmised. Immortal Zhenyuan's Purple Gold Gourd was a supreme life-saving magic weapon, also known as a quasi-godly weapon; what was more, it released a stream of purple gold fog.</p>

    <p>The rumor was that this fog "bound" two places together. When the fog was released, it could help a person to get away swiftly. It was a bit like a portable transmitter array, but way quicker. A person could use it to escape at any time, leaving no opportunity to catch them.</p>

    <p>"The Purple Gold Gourd is one of Immortal Zhenyuan's three magic treasures. Along with the Seven Stars Sword and Golden Canopy Rope, these are known as the Three Auspicious Treasures. At that time, Immortal Zhenyuan deliberately released them into the world so that they could be found by the person destined to have them. Plenty of cultivators have tried everything to collect these treasures. Immortal Zhenyuan once said that the person who is able to gather these three magic treasures together would become his inner disciple. In order to hide the real ones, Immortal Zhenyuan even made a lot of counterfeits. At that time, collecting these Three Auspicious Treasures had been all the rage, like collecting the cards in crispy noodle snacks..." Third Saint said with a reminiscent expression on his face.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Yes, there was something like that." Immortal Toya sucked in air between his teeth and said, "But until now, no one has successfully collected all of them. And even if they have, no one knows whether they're genuine or not..."</p>

    <p>"But the Purple Gold Gourd in that old devil's hands is definitely the real deal; only the genuine thing could transport him so quickly."</p>

    <p>Third Saint continued speaking and at the same time turned his gaze to Wang Ling. "Speaking of which, does senior have a way to track this devil down?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded, his eyes fixed on that crushed ancient magic blade on the ground.</p>

    <p>There was still a chance that they could repair the magic blade and use it to track that devil back to the magic treasure's small world.</p>

    <p>"But the middle of this magic blade has been reduced to sand, is it possible to repair it..." Immortal Toya crouched down on the ground and touched the shattered blade.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, as long as it's Senior Killer, he can definitely do it!" Third Saint breathed noisily through his nostrils as he stared at Wang Ling with a fanboy expression. "As expected of a blade crushed by Senior Killer â€” even though it's broken, it's still so sexy!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>For some reason, Immortal Toya suddenly wanted to request the song "Too Deep Into the Act" by Ma Xudong on radio.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>While it had just been a short confrontation with this legendary old devil this time, Wang Ling was now deeply aware of how dangerous this man was.</p>

    <p>The next time they met, they would have to settle this once and for all.</p>

    <p>Although it had appeared to be just a small fight, the two parties that had been involved were almighty cultivators who had the ability to upend mountains and seas with a wave of their hands. Even the collision of auras in this small-scale battle had severely damaged their surroundings.</p>

    <p>The convenience mart's roller shutter had already been completely torn down by the old devil's aura earlier. All around outside the mart, the wall surfaces had already cracked open, and some of the basement's support pillars even appeared worn down, as if insects had gnawed on them.</p>

    <p>Most tragic of all were the dozens of luxury cars parked in the basement; the collision of auras had blown out their headlights and punctured their tyres.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had in fact tried his best to control his strength, given that there were more than a hundred residents in this building. If he had fought the old devil seriously just now, these residents would have suffered for it.</p>

    <p>Given the confined space, he had had to take too many factors into consideration.</p>

    <p>He had to find a wide open space next time and take down this devil in one go!</p>

    <p>While Wang Ling was thinking this, elsewhere, sirens had already started to blare outside the basement.</p>

    <p>The only good news now was that the confrontation just now hadn't caused any casualties.</p>

    <p>When Third Saint had been on the way here, he had already known that a fight had broken out in the basement, and so had prevented residents who had been on their way down from entering.</p>

    <p>Most likely it was these passersby who had called the police.</p>

    <p>"Teacher Killer and Senior Toya please leave first, I'll handle the rest!" Third Saint said righteously, hands on his hips.</p>

    <p>"This place was badly damaged, it's probably going to cost a lot in compensation." Immortal Toya said.</p>

    <p>"It's vulgar for cultivators to talk about money. What is worldly wealth to us? This is just a basement. In order to create a superior battleground for senior, I disconnected the wires for this building's elevators in case someone took the lift down to the basement and disturbed Senior Killer."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Later, Wang Ling and Immortal Toya took their leave of Third Saint.</p>

    <p>Standing fixed to one spot, Third Saint waved until Wang Ling disappeared in the distance. "Goodbye, Senior Killer!"</p>

    <p>Soon after, several police cars with flashing sirens sped into the basement. As many as eight cars stopped in front of Third Saint, and dozens of police officers poured out to surround him in a half circle.</p>

    <p>Third Saint raised his eyebrows; the confrontation had begun...</p>

    <p>The police captain leading the team looked around the severely damaged basement, then immediately took out a pair of immortal-restraining handcuffs and threw them over to Third Saint. "Comrade! Please hand over your magic weapon of mass destruction, put on the handcuffs, and cooperate with our investigation immediately!"</p>

    <p>Third Saint put his hands up, an innocent expression on his face. "Comrade police, you misunderstand, I didn't do this!"</p>

    <p>"Do you have any evidence?" the police captain asked.</p>

    <p>Third Saint slowly turned around and shrugged off his white clothes.</p>

    <p>Instantly, four large characters on his back jumped out at everyone... these four characters were from when Wang Ling had signed his back, pretending to be Killer Taoist.</p>

    <p>To preserve this signature, Third Saint had already gone without a bath for more than half a month!</p>

    <p>Reaching behind him, Third Saint pointed at his back with his thumb and turned his head to bare his white teeth as he smiled. "See this?! Devotion to the nation!"</p>

    <p>Police captain: "...Someone come and arrest this psycho!"</p>
