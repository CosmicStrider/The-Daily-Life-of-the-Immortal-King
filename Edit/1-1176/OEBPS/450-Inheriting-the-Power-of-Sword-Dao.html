  <h1>Chapter 450 Inheriting the Power of Sword Dao </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was July 11th on Tuesday in the twelfth week of the semester.</p>

    <p>It was already more than ten hours after Evil Sword God had been formally detained. Returning home from school, Wang Ling placed the tools specially required for making talismans on his table: a brush, talisman paper, and cinnabar.</p>

    <p>While he had taken Evil Sword God's power of Sword Dao away, that didn't mean that it had disappeared.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's Great Sword Dao Spell attribute was "omniscience," and Evil Sword God's attribute was the "ten-meter sword circle."</p>

    <p>Looking at the level of quality of these attributes, the one that Wang Ling had grasped was undoubtedly the finest, but Evil Sword God's ten-meter sword circle couldn't be considered weak; at the very least, it could greatly enhance his strength and make him invincible in a fight at close quarters.</p>

    <p>It was just Evil Sword God's bad luck this time to run into Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, Wang Ling felt that with this ten-meter sword circle, even Evil Sword God's senior brother General Yi wouldn't be able to take him down.</p>

    <p>The Dao talisman that Wang Ling was preparing to draw this time was an inheritance talisman that would be combined with the "Great Sword Dao Spell" which had previously been taken from Evil Sword God.</p>

    <p>This was a type of legendary Dao talisman and there were almost no written records of it in the world; originally, it had been used to inherit the Three Thousand Great Spells.</p>

    <p>Standing in front of the table with the brush in his hand, Wang Ling drew the talisman with extreme focus.</p>

    <p>Crouched in Wang Ling's chair, Er Ha watched intently.</p>

    <p>Little Sheep stood next to the table.</p>

    <p>Inheritance talisman...</p>

    <p>Er Ha had never seen this kind of Dao talisman before and it was extremely difficult to draw. Even a professional talisman maker following a diagram had a very low chance of succeeding, and the success rate was almost negligible.</p>

    <p>After all, this was a special Dao talisman for inheriting the Three Thousand Great Spells; it wasn't some small, common ability, and it would never be that easy to draw.</p>

    <p>"What's it for?" Er Ha crouched in the chair and blinked.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling paid no attention to him as he concentrated on drawing the Dao talisman.</p>

    <p>On the side, Sheep raised her eyebrows as she looked at Er Ha. "Obviously, it's for you!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha was taken aback; it had never thought that its little master would actually pass on the Sword Dao he had taken from Evil Sword God to it.</p>

    <p>"But... I can't use a sword..." Er Ha broke into a sweat. It wasn't convenient for it to hold a sword with its paws unless it could cultivate a human shape. The problem was that it had just reached second class, and it would actually be a long time before it could advance to first class.</p>

    <p>Advancing from second class to first class included a transformation from the beast form to a human form, which for spirit beasts was equivalent to the "Soul Formation stage." Ultimately, spirit beasts had to successfully pass through a tribulation before they could cultivate to first class.</p>

    <p>Er Ha calculated its current cultivation progress: even if it was now using the modified "Demon King Heart Sutra" to speed up its cultivation, without any further assistance, it would have to painstakingly cultivate for at least the next fifty years.</p>

    <p>Advancing from second class to first class in fifty years could already be considered a breakneck pace.</p>

    <p>An ordinary spirit beast would need at least a thousand years of cultivation to advance from second class to first class.</p>

    <p>The modified "Demon King Heart Sutra" had already enhanced its speed twenty-fold... Er Ha was already pretty content with its situation â€” it wasn't Sage Tyrant Song <sup>1</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(An alias for the protagonist of the xuanhuan novel "Cultivation Chat Group." Song is a trouble magnet who actively courts death on a daily basis ..)</dfn>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Soon, Wang Ling finished drawing the Dao talisman and raised his eyes to look at Er Ha.</p>

    <p>Of course he knew Er Ha's misgivings.</p>

    <p>But he thought that most people in fact had a mistaken understanding of Sword Dao.</p>

    <p>True Sword Dao didn't require that you wield a sword.</p>

    <p>That also included when, during the fight, Evil Sword God had thought the highest state in Sword Dao was when a man and a sword became one. In fact, this wasn't the case.</p>

    <p>Each of the Three Thousand Great Spells had a lot of their own attributes, and depending on each person's differing understanding of them, these attributes could be divided into many types.</p>

    <p>Attribute was attribute.</p>

    <p>Realm was realm.</p>

    <p>Profound truth was profound truth.</p>

    <p>The highest state of Sword Dao was "intangible heart sword," which was then followed by "union between man and sword."</p>

    <p>A sword not in hand but in heart - this was the highest state of Sword Dao!</p>

    <p>But there were very few people in the world today who could grasp this level.</p>

    <p>Each person grasped different Sword Dao attributes, but if one was adept in cultivation, they could ultimately achieve "union between man and sword" or even "intangible heart sword"- even the supreme profound truth of Sword Dao, the "World-Annihilating Sword," would be within their grasp.</p>

    <p>That was why in reality, whether it was Wang Ling or Jingke, both of them could use the "World-Annihilating Sword" independent of each other.</p>

    <p>As for why Jingke had chosen to become one with Lord Diulei before using the World-Annihilating Sword in the previous fight against Evil Sword God, that was also Wang Ling's decision.</p>

    <p>Bluntly speaking, it was to help Lord Diulei save face.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling handed the inheritance talisman to Er Ha and told it to stick the talisman on its forehead when it had spare time. Sword Dao techniques were very complicated, but there was nothing to be afraid of if Er Ha used the inheritance talisman; it would be able to absorb a little each day and would master Sword Dao sooner or later.</p>

    <p>"Do I really have to learn it?" Er Ha was very doubtful as it accepted the inheritance talisman.</p>

    <p>Its current realm was just second class... at most it was just at the Nascent Soul stage, and the Three Thousand Great Spells was something that could only be touched by peak True Immortals at the very least! Wasn't it a little too early to come into contact with them now?</p>

    <p>Sheep crouched down and stroked Er Ha's fur. "The Three Thousand Great Spells are indeed difficult to comprehend. But actually, anyone can master them. Why do you think I can run so fast?"</p>

    <p>"..." Er Ha was immediately lost for words.</p>

    <p>When it heard what Sheep had said, it seemed to instantly understand. The goblins in the villa that had been enlightened by Little Master Ling actually didn't have high realms, but each of them had at least grasped one of the Three Thousand Great Spells - they had directly inherited these spells from Wang Ling after being enlightened!</p>

    <p>Sheep was clearly at the Soul Formation stage, but she had mastered the Great Wind Speed Spell.</p>

    <p>And Lord Ma, who had the highest realm and who in the villa was the only Itinerant Immortal Wang Ling had directly enlightened, had mastered the "Great Devouring Spell"...</p>

    <p>The Three Thousand Great Spells were something that could only be comprehended naturally once a person reached a particular realm. Furthermore, they were very difficult to understand, and many people frantically pursued them - but if they could be inherited, then that was a different matter altogether.</p>

    <p>Sheep: "Since little master is giving this to you, just accept it."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "But I don't have a sword..."</p>

    <p>Sheep: "Don't you have claws?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>That night, an old man with white hedgehog hair appeared at Songhai First Prison's main gate. As always, he was dressed in a martial arts outfit with a red waist sash. Furthermore, he didn't like walking, and he floated in the air with his feet several inches off the ground.</p>

    <p>"Who is it?"</p>

    <p>The prison officer guarding the entrance saw that there seemed to be a man at the gate, and he opened the small window in the iron gate to take a look.</p>

    <p>As a result, his face was instantly dotted with beads of fine sweat. "Gen, Gen, General Yi?"</p>

    <p>General Yi nodded and gave a soft grunt. "Open up."</p>

    <p>According to standard procedure, anyone entering the prison needed the warden's personal approval. There was no way Warden Liang wouldn't know if General Yi intended to come, and the prison would definitely have prepared beforehand to greet him.</p>

    <p>Unless General Yi had personally dropped by without informing anyone...</p>

    <p>The prison officer couldn't help recalling the criminal whom Warden Liang had personally put into the special prison cell that day in the early hours of the morning. Perhaps General Yi was here for that criminal... to be imprisoned with the old devil and Cheng Yu, the Master of Immortal Mansion, how could it be an ordinary person? For this criminal to actually alarm General Yi enough for the latter to come in person, the prison officer at the entrance felt this was quite unbelievable.</p>
