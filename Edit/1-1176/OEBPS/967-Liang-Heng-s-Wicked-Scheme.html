  <h1>Chapter 967 Liang Heng's Wicked Scheme</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Should he curse his own students?.</p>

    <p>Liang Heng instantly thought of this plan.</p>

    <p>Although that wouldn't be very kind of him, he had no other way. He had to take care of Tiger Liang, his wife and his old mother, and he himself was already old. But those students were different: they were still young and had long lives ahead of them. Taking a few years off their lives should be fine, right?</p>

    <p>As he thought this, wicked thoughts started to sprout and a shadow gathered in Liang Heng's heart.</p>

    <p>But Liang Heng felt that he should first test whether this curse really did work or not.</p>

    <p>He typed Father Chen's name into the name box on the grim reaper's tongue and finally chose the "mild curse" option.</p>

    <p>Right away, the reaper on the computer screen waved the scythe it was holding, and blood instantly splashed all over the screen...</p>

    <p>Liang Heng felt like he fell into a trance for a few seconds. When he came back to his senses, the reaper's long tongue had already rolled up and there was a word on the computer screen: Processing...</p>

    <p>It was actually real?</p>

    <p>Liang Heng examined his own body in disbelief. His physical health had indeed declined in an instant just now, as if he had aged.</p>

    <p>Even his skin had become a little flabbier...</p>

    <p>After all, middle-aged people who wanted to stay fit had to diligently cultivate and exercise a lot every day... One year had been taken off his life just then, but his body was displaying the side effects right away.</p>

    <p>If he used this on his students, they might become seriously ill for a time.</p>

    <p>But Liang Heng wasn't unhappy.</p>

    <p>Rather, he was delighted now...</p>

    <p>Thanks to Zhu Ge, he was actually able to learn this method to help him achieve a beautiful reversal in fortune!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At roughly the same time the next day, Liang Heng was checking the curse program again when he received a video that was several minutes long inside the program's internal mailbox.</p>

    <p>Liang Heng opened it and realized that the man in the video was actually Father Chen.</p>

    <p>While he wasn't certain how the person taking the video had managed to get so close without being noticed, Liang Heng carefully watched the video from beginning to end without skipping over a second of it.</p>

    <p>It could be called a compilation of Father Chen's "bad luck" for one day.</p>

    <p>At seven o'clock in the morning, Father Chen arrived at the dojo entrance and found that a huge, red "tear down" had actually been spray painted on the door.</p>

    <p>"What's going on..." Father Chen was utterly shocked by this massive sign of demolition in front of him.</p>

    <p>He rubbed the red spray paint; it was the kind that was waterproof and wouldn't wash off easily...</p>

    <p>He now needed to spend money to have the entire door removed and replaced...</p>

    <p>Even if he complained to the worker who had done the spray painting and claimed for damages, it would take months for the complaint to be processed.</p>

    <p>But what made Father Chen despair were the smaller words spray painted next to "tear down": "Sorry, I sprayed the wrong place!!!"</p>

    <p>Father Chen: "..."</p>

    <p>Liang Heng: "..."</p>

    <p>This was the first part of the video. Just like Father Chen in the video, Liang Heng sat in front of the video on his computer and didn't speak for a long time.</p>

    <p>For some reason, Liang Heng felt like laughing.</p>

    <p>But Father Chen's cursed day of bad luck had only just began.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The second part was during noon.</p>

    <p>A fish bone actually got stuck in Father Chen's throat while he was eating fish, and he was taken to the hospital right away.</p>

    <p>In the video Liang Heng had received, the doctor was taking the fish bone out of Father Chen's throat. When he fished the bone out with tweezers, the tip was even stained with blood from Father Chen's throat. "This was really dangerous. If you had come in a little later, this fish bone would have pierced your throat."</p>

    <p>In the operating room, Father Chen was feeling aggrieved. Because the bone had only just been taken out, his voice was still very hoarse. "But doctor, the fish I bought is Scaleless Boneless Fish..."</p>

    <p>This kind of fish was very popular in the market. As its name implied, it was scaleless and boneless. Both adults and children could eat it, and its meat was very delicious.</p>

    <p>Reasonably speaking, it was impossible for him to ingest a fish bone...</p>

    <p>"Was the fish fresh?"</p>

    <p>"Well... The meat is a bit old..."</p>

    <p>"Then you probably don't know, but when you buy Scaleless Boneless Fish at the market, you should get the young or adult ones. This kind of fish isn't truly boneless; it's just that the bones are very soft when their young or mature, so when you eat it, it seems boneless. Too bad you bought an old one."</p>

    <p>"What's wrong with an old fish..." Father Chen trembled.</p>

    <p>"Of course you can eat an old fish, but the one you bought had osteoproliferation," replied the doctor.</p>

    <p>Father Chen: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The last two minutes of the six-minute video were of Father Chen on his way back from the hospital.</p>

    <p>Father Chen's taxi had just arrived at a junction not far from the dojo, when a truck carrying steel bars actually went out of control and hit the taxi head-on... Fortunately, the taxi driver was a master and quick-witted. Predicting the path of the swerving truck, he stepped on the gas and accelerated. With a Cyclone Magnum Hurricane, the taxi directly overtook the truck and stopped in the safe zone up ahead.</p>

    <p>The truck carrying steel bars hit the roadside barrier, and white smoke started to escape the front of the truck.</p>

    <p>"I've been really unlucky today..." In the video, Father Chen turned to look behind him, his expression clearly a little scared as some trepidation still lingered.</p>

    <p>In front of his screen, Liang Heng exulted!</p>

    <p>He had only used one year of his life, but he almost killed Father Chen...</p>

    <p>Being able to sneak around merrily behind the scenes like this made Liang Heng extremely cheerful.</p>

    <p>His rival Chen Yi had actually suffered for real after Liang Heng had cursed him yesterday. Not only did he have bad luck for the whole day, he almost died...</p>

    <p>And this was only a mild curse!</p>

    <p>Liang Heng was excited.</p>

    <p>Who knew what the effects of a moderate curse would be like?</p>

    <p>Liang Heng raised an eyebrow.</p>

    <p>Staring at the completed order in the curse program, he was exhilarated and he couldn't calm down for a long time.</p>

    <p>After seeing Father Chen's unlucky day, Liang Heng felt that he couldn't wait any longer...</p>

    <p>"I'll see what a moderate curse looks like!" Liang Heng was extremely excited.</p>

    <p>Since a mild curse had almost killed Father Chen, would he be half-dead from a moderate curse?</p>

    <p>Liang Heng thought for a while.</p>

    <p>Then, he typed in a new name on the grim reaper's tongue: Chen Chao...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>His goal actually wasn't Chen Yi's death, but to make him feel pain.</p>

    <p>So if he put a curse on Chen Chao...</p>

    <p>As his father, Chen Yi would definitely feel even more pain!</p>

    <p>Liang Heng thought he really was too smart!</p>
