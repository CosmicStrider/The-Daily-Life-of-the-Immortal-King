  <h1>Chapter 1089 Backward Confession</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Although Xia Ming was revered as a warrior, he was now caught up in deep torment. He had gathered his strength for a whole semester to confess his feelings, but had dropped the ball at the critical moment... He didn't know why the words he wanted to say actually turned into that rubbish.</p>

    <p>Xia Ming was now in a dilemma; he didn't want to be a warrior in the Warrior Union, and he still liked Sun Rong a lot. But the Warrior Union in school now revered him as a hero; if his feelings were exposed, these people might retaliate against him...</p>

    <p>Xia Ming was preoccupied in class the whole day, and he experienced what only Classmate Sun Rong had ever experienced — the feeling of being in the spotlight at school.</p>

    <p>If Number 60 High had its own list of top searches, Xia Ming would definitely be at the top, and there might even be the word "hot" next to his name.</p>

    <p>But he had no idea when he would drop out of the list...</p>

    <p>Xia Ming looked at Sun Rong's empty seat when he passed by Class Three during the break. He had heard earlier that it seemed Sun Rong had gone crazy with anger yesterday and hadn't come to school today.</p>

    <p>Xie Ming hadn't thought it was that exaggerated, but realized that it was actually true when he passed by the classroom and had a look.</p>

    <p>Of course, he didn't come to Class Three purely to look for Sun Rong...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The sudden appearance of the man of the moment in class during the break instantly caused quite the stir around Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Isn't that Xia Ming..."</p>

    <p>"The hero everyone's talking about from yesterday!"</p>

    <p>Several people in class started to make a big fuss.</p>

    <p>"I'm really sorry about yesterday..." Xia Ming walked to the dais and bowed to everyone in class. He knew what Sun Rong's status was like in Class Three — basically everyone liked her. After his brain fart yesterday, when he did that outrageous thing, the entire class definitely hated him. In order not to make more enemies, he had struggled for a very long time before plucking up his courage to apologize.</p>

    <p>And this apology immediately won applause from the students in Class Three.</p>

    <p>Xia Ming raised his face suspiciously, and looked a little lost.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao came over and hooked one arm around Xia Ming's neck. "Bro! Honestly speaking, I was awed by your awesome move yesterday! Who taught you how to chat up girls?"</p>

    <p>Chat up girls?</p>

    <p>Xia Ming: "???"</p>

    <p>"There's never been anything that could make Classmate Sun Rong react so strongly." Chen Chao laughed. "Don't worry. I've asked about it, and she isn't angry. If she really was angry, her bodyguards would already have taken care of you on your way to school."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>What Chen Chao said was true. If Sun Rong really was angry, she didn't need to say a single word; given Huaguo Water Curtain Group's status, it would take no time at all to arrange for a student to be transferred to another school. And now that Chen Chao had opened his blessed mouth, this was more concrete proof that Sun Rong wasn't angry.</p>

    <p>At least, that was what Wang Ling felt.</p>

    <p>"How can you be so sure?" Guo Hao couldn't believe it, and for one moment, everyone in class gave Chen Chao curious looks.</p>

    <p>"It's like this: Sun Rong has a childhood friend who's been training at my family's body technique dojo. I have her WeChat account, and I was talking to her about Classmate Sun just now. I didn't expect her childhood friend to tell me everything," said Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>"What did she say..."</p>

    <p>"She said that after Sun Rong returned home, her bodyguards saw her remain silent the whole time, and looked for her childhood friend to help talk to her. After talking for around two hours, her childhood friend realized that Sun Rong didn't really seem angry." Chen Chao rubbed his chin. "But she didn't tell me the details... In any case, one thing we can be somewhat sure of is that Classmate Sun Rong seems to like Xia Ming a little. Of course, it might not be 'like'! It might just be a good impression."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "???"</p>

    <p>Xia Ming: "???"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "???"</p>

    <p>As soon as Chen Chao said that, the whole class instantly started swearing.</p>

    <p>In a flash, it was as if everyone seemed to understand the deal with what Xia Ming did yesterday.</p>

    <p>As it turned out, it wasn't real dislike, but a backward confession in front of everyone!</p>

    <p>So it was a backward confession to catch Classmate Sun Rong's attention, to try and use a novel way of expressing one's feelings!</p>

    <p>Everyone was dumbfounded!</p>

    <p>It wasn't just Class Three; when the students in the corridor who had gathered to look at the hero of the hour heard this, their jaws dropped open and there were awestruck expressions on their faces.</p>

    <p>"My god, what kind of godly operation is that?" Everyone was completely shocked.</p>

    <p>With this unexpected twist in events, Number 60 exploded once again.</p>

    <p>It was normally very hard for this sort of scenario to happen in real life — maybe it was only those crack authors who wrote songs every day rather than update their novels, who stopped updating for no reason yet still acted shameless about it, who would come up with such a plot.</p>

    <p>Thus, the whole school this time knew that Sun Rong actually liked Xia Ming...</p>

    <p>After this twist, Xia Ming thought that the Warrior Union would retaliate against him. However, after they learned the truth, the Warrior Union bros all looked at him in worship! In an instant, Xia Ming became Number 60 High's love guru... During the afternoon recess, people came non-stop to consult him on confessing their feelings.</p>

    <p>"Master Xia Ming! Please teach me how to pick up girls! We can't use this technique of yours!" A boy from another class approached him, a worshipful expression on his face. "I've been chasing a girl from another school. She can't be considered very beautiful, but is the tsundere sort. Master Xia Ming, please teach me the right way to confess my feelings. How should I confess so that I won't be rejected?"</p>

    <p>"You should be brave..." Xia Ming had no idea how to respond.</p>

    <p>After all, he himself had gotten lucky... who on earth could have known that his backward confession would conversely cause Sun Rong to have a good impression of him...</p>

    <p>A second boy found him. "Master Xia! I have a big sister neighbor whom I've liked for a long time. She's very gentle, and what's more, she likes manga and cosplay! How should I make her think well of me?"</p>

    <p>"You should be brave..." Xia Ming said.</p>

    <p>A third boy found him. "Mr Xia Ming... Actually, I have a younger sister. Of course, my parents adopted her at an early age, and we actually aren't biologically related! I want to ask: Can I also be brave?"</p>

    <p>"Hm... You should be brave, and then go and learn the criminal laws of our nation..." said Xia Ming.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
