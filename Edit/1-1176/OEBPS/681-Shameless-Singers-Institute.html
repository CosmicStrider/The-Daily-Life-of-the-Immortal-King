  <h1>Chapter 681 Shameless Singers Institute</h1>

  <div>

    <p>What was going on?</p>

    <p>Yang Zhong didn't expect to be attacked by a "water army" as soon as he started live streaming today. The question was, where did this water army come from? Were the guild battles starting again?</p>

    <p>In the live streaming industry, guild battles were very common, especially in the entertainment circle on live streaming platforms. In order to consolidate their strength, each guild frequently signed on many singers to create a team, and it wasn't uncommon for different teams of singers to wrestle each other behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>Shadow Fool Guild had a lot of rival guilds in the Langya Broadcasting circle, so Yang Zhong guessed that the other guilds were most likely envious of the profit he had made from his live stream yesterday, and hence had hired a water army to attack him.</p>

    <p>Wang Situ? Who was Wang Situ? Was there this kind of singer? He had never heard of him!</p>

    <p>Just as Yang Zhong was feeling very confused, that President Lang Bei also sent some news in the chat group: numbers in the live stream room had grown abnormally large, and the spectators squatting in the live stream room before the start of the broadcast had already surpassed tens of thousands. A hired water army was usually only made up of several hundred people, and they were the only ones who would repeatedly spam the bullet screen with malicious comments... everything would be fine as long as they were all blocked.</p>

    <p>But now, the live stream room was besieged by thousands and thousands of people!</p>

    <p>Like Li Yunlong's battle formation when he attacked Pingan county...</p>

    <p>Then the question was, who on earth was this Wang Situ?</p>

    <p>In the chat group, Lang Bei asked anxiously, "What's going on, who is this Wang Situ?"</p>

    <p>Under the mask, Yang Zhong frowned. A bead of cold sweat rolled down his cheek, and he swiftly replied, "I took a look at the bullet screen just now; I'm guessing it's probably the fans of the original owner of that audio who've come to demolish our live stream room<sup>1</sup>."</p>
        
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(In an online context, a "demolition squad" refers to users who spam the screen with bullet messages.)</dfn>

    <p>Hearing this, Lang Bei was shocked. "Such a coincidence?" They had only just talked about the audio before the start of the live stream, and after hanging up, President Lang Bei had already specially arranged for a record company to give this song a limited release online.</p>

    <p>The number of online users in the live stream room continued to climb, breaking half a million in five minutes, and Yang Zhong suddenly started to panic. "What should I do now?" He was just a small live streamer. Because he couldn't sing, he relied on buying raw vocals off other people and lip-syncing them to attract fans. Yang Zhong did think that he might be exposed one day, but he didn't expect that day to come so soon.</p>

    <p>In the face of such huge momentum, he felt a little overwhelmed...</p>

    <p>"For now, calm your fans down in the live stream room. Ban what should be banned. I'll arrange for someone to upload the song as soon as possible. Since it's never been released online, if we release it first, we'll have the upper hand."</p>

    <p>President Lang Bei thought of countermeasures. "Didn't we have a singer who always helped us before? Contact him and ask him to sing this song raw, then record it... lip-sync it in the live stream room; remember to act more like you're the one singing it, don't get caught with your pants down."</p>

    <p>Yang Zhong nodded. "Alright."</p>

    <p>After talking with President Lang Bei, Yang Zhong got in touch with the singer who had lip-synced for him. He had been flustered just now and had almost forgotten this trump card.</p>

    <p>This singer was none other than that online celebrity singer Tang Youning who became famous after singing "Old Boys," the vagrant singer whom Wang Ling had helped out at Boss Tan's Midnight Dining Hall!</p>

    <p>"Brother Tang? I have a song here, can you sing it raw?" Yang Zhong sent a message to Tang Youning.</p>

    <p>On the other end, Tang Youning fell silent when he once again received Yang Zhong's message.</p>

    <p>After a while, he typed one word: "Again?"</p>

    <p>Yang Zhong thought for a moment before replying, "Brother Tang, this really is the last time... I'm not going to sing anymore. I'm going to switch to becoming a talk show live streamer. You know what my family situation is like, my father is bedridden, my mother died shortly after I was born... I still have a brother at home, I need to pay his school fees! We've known each other for a while, can't you help me out one last time?"</p>

    <p>Tang Youning was silent.</p>

    <p>"But when you were exposed before, you already vowed to all your viewers and fans that you wouldn't steal songs and lip-sync anymore. Were those words... all fake?"</p>

    <p>"Brother Tang! Your voice is really very similar to the singer of this audio I found recently. As long as we don't say anything, no one will know! This really is the last time!"</p>

    <p>Yang Zhong knew that this was very important. If Tang Youning didn't help him this time, his career in entertainment was over!</p>

    <p>Apologize? Impossible... He had already apologized once in the previous incident. He clearly remembered saying to the audience that from then on, all the songs he performed in his live stream would be his own, that he wouldn't use another artist's music, that he wouldn't let those who liked him down anymore, that he wasn't a hypocrite...</p>

    <p>If something went wrong today and he had to bow to pressure and apologize again, his future path would be destroyed... Although he had already contacted Tang Youning before and said that he wouldn't bother him anymore, Yang Zhong now genuinely felt that he was already at the end of his rope with no way out.</p>

    <p>"Brother Tang, you have to help me with this!" Yang Zhong pleaded again. "I know you're riding the momentum now, but Brother Tang... Remember, when you were a vagrant singer back then, I especially helped you out financially. Also, I kept some screenshots of our previous deals."</p>

    <p>Tang Youning laughed. "Are you threatening me?"</p>

    <p>Yang Zhong: "No... I'm not threatening you... I'm begging you..."</p>

    <p>Tang Youning grit his teeth. "Back then, it was because I knew your family situation was difficult, and I didn't have any money, which was why I chose to help you! If I really wanted your money, I would have directly asked for half of your live stream profits instead of selling that raw vocal to you for fifty HNY!"</p>

    <p>Tang Youning was really furious as he never thought Yang Zhong would actually threaten him like this.</p>

    <p>Yang Zhong had relied on Tang Youning's voice to trend on the Internet and to gain popularity and fans... now, Yang Zhong actually didn't hesitate to threaten him with records of their previous transactions if Tang Youning didn't continue helping him trick the audience.</p>

    <p>This type of person actually existed in the world?</p>

    <p>Tang Youning was so angry that he directly closed the chat window and then turned off his phone!</p>

    <p>He had many benefactors, but Yang Zhong wasn't one of them!</p>

    <p>For Tang Youning, his benefactors were Boss Tan, who owned Midnight Dining Hall, and that youngster and his father who had sold him a song for cheap...</p>

    <p>But now Tang Youning had been dragged deep into the mud because of Yang Zhong.</p>

    <p>From the moment Yang Zhong had threatened him, Tang Youning realized that things couldn't go on like this.</p>

    <p>He had to step forward to uncover the true identity of this hypocrite... and get more people to see the repulsive face under that mask!</p>
