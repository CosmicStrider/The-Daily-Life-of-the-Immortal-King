  <h1>Chapter 859 Gu Shunzhi's Objective</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It turned out that all this time, what he had mastered was all the Heavenly Dao of the ten universes...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at his palms, closed his eyes, and thought for a bit.</p>

    <p>He wasn't like Gu Cheng, who had already grasped the Three Thousand Heavenly Dao when he was very young. Wang Ling's Three Thousand Heavenly Dao came to him bit by bit as memories. However, this type of memory recovery was quite slow, and Wang Ling didn't master all of the Heavenly Dao until he was about thirteen or fourteen years old.</p>

    <p>But based on what Book of Sage Immortal was saying, this riddle was now solved.</p>

    <p>Why were these memories slow to recover when he was a child?</p>

    <p>The reason was very likely because the Heavenly Dao he was recalling was likely the Heavenly Dao of the ten universes! Also, it was very likely that during the process, some sort of melding had happened...</p>

    <p>The Heavenly Dao of ten universes would total thirty thousand.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't have a clear idea of how strong he was, but he certainly knew how to count, and he was very sure that he only had Three Thousand Heavenly Dao in memory. However, there were countless branches under the Three Thousand Heavenly Dao...</p>

    <p>So after listening to Book of Sage Immortal, Wang Ling could make a rough deduction.</p>

    <p>While he was recovering the memories as he grew up, he was in reality recalling a full thirty thousand Heavenly Dao! There were ten universes in total, and he recovered the Three Thousand Heavenly Dao of each universe... But these Heavenly Dao had fused together!</p>

    <p>That was to say, while it looked like he had grasped three thousand Heavenly Dao, it was in fact thirty thousand...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was stunned.</p>

    <p>Even his mother didn't know how awesome he was...</p>

    <p>Completely ignorant of the atmosphere, Book of Sage Immortal, who was still immersed in giving praise, said at that moment, "If the heavens didn't give birth to Lord Ling, all ages would be like the long night <sup>1</sup> ! Given my lord's supreme strength, any heirs he has in the future will already be at their peak at birth..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Adapted from a Chinese poem about Confucius.)</dfn>

    <p>The corner of Wang Ling's lips twitched secretly.</p>

    <p>It was still way too early to talk about later generations.</p>

    <p>He didn't have a girlfriend yet...</p>

    <p>Besides, how could a girlfriend taste better than crispy noodle snacks?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling couldn't be blamed for thinking this...</p>

    <p>After all, he was still only sixteen years old.</p>

    <p>Right now, Wang Ling really couldn't imagine himself holding a child in his arms in the future and shouting every time he met people, "My son Wang Teng has the potential to become the Great Emperor <sup>2</sup> ..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(An iconic line from the online novel "Shrouding the Heavens.")</dfn>

    <p>Five minutes later, detailed information on Gu Shunzhi emerged.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked through the information Book of Sage Immortal had put together.</p>

    <p>According to Book of Sage Immortal, in addition to the seventh universe he inhabited, Gu Shunzhi also spent time in the first and tenth universes.</p>

    <p>In addition, Book of Sage Immortal described Gu Shunzhi's occupation as: keeper of order.</p>

    <p>Was this a person who did something like maintain order?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling lowered his head and pondered.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Book of Sage Immortal spoke again. "My lord! May I take a guess at what you're thinking?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded. "Mm..."</p>

    <p>Book of Sage Immortal: "Gu Shunzhi, who is originally from the seventh universe, has links to the first and tenth universes, and bears the position of keeper of order. My lord has probably already speculated that shortly after Gu Shunzhi was born in the seventh universe, the Heavenly Dao Governing Committee recognized him as master of three cosmic orders, who would fix certain errors that appeared as the universes expanded. Thus, Gu Shunzhi traveling back here from the future definitely is for the purpose of fixing some mistake... Of course, I believe my wise and divine lord will have already thought of this."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Book of Sage Immortal paused, then said, "Gu Shunzhi has come to an era where he has yet to be born, so he definitely didn't come for himself. According to the data, the only people who might be connected to Gu Shunzhi are Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi... Of course, I believe my lord has definitely thought of this, so I'll talk about the key points next."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Book of Sage Immortal: "Based on the data, Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi aren't in a relationship in the future. Liu Qingyi and Gu Shunzhi's father, Gu Cheng, will unexpectedly become husband and wife during a particular event, and the child which they will ultimately have is this Gu Shunzhi. From the data, Wang Zhen's end is more tragic. After losing Liu Qingyi, Wang Zhen embarked on solo space travel. Therefore, it can be inferred that Gu Shunzhi coming here from the future is probably for the following three things...</p>

    <p>"First, to prevent Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi from developing feelings for each other. Second, to actively set Liu Qingyi up with Gu Shunzhi's father, Gu Cheng. Third, to detain Wang Zhen. Wang Zhen will make important contributions to the development of the seventh universe in the future, so he cannot be allowed to run off on a journey because of a broken heart..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>So that was it!</p>

    <p>Book of Sage Immortal: "Excuse my ignorance, my lord, what I've said is just shallow knowledge... my lord must have already considered the matter more thoroughly!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was still August 18th, the day of Old Man Wang's showdown against Jiang Haifu, head of Kitchen Knife Sect.</p>

    <p>After weeks of preparation and training respectively, Old Man Wang and Jiang Haifu were in good competitive shape.</p>

    <p>Jiang Haifu's Kitchen Knife Sect was a rare sect enterprise that had become popular in recent decades. Its overall fighting strength might be weaker than that of other sects, but its massive size and large number of disciples created a ripple effect that spread throughout the country. Furthermore, Kitchen Knife Sect was going to launch a new franchise model very soon so that they were no longer limited to independent stores, thereby spreading its sect's influence worldwide.</p>

    <p>To be such a formidable boss, Jiang Haifu's ability to grasp the changing patterns in the market was unquestionable, but only Jiang Haifu knew that the biggest reason for his success today was that recipe he had accidentally picked up back then...</p>

    <p>Without that recipe, it would have been very hard for Kitchen Knife Sect to achieve what it had today.</p>

    <p>This was a contest, and in fact had a very simple format.</p>

    <p>After Old Man Wang and Jiang Haifu finished cooking in the kitchen, the dishes would be presented anonymously to everyone, who would taste the dishes and then score them. Whoever had the higher score would be the winner.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, to avoid suspicion, the dishes Old Man Wang and Jiang Haifu were cooking today had to be completely new innovations as they created dishes that had never been cooked before.</p>

    <p>This was in fact a rule set by Old Man Wang. After coming to live in the Wang family's small villa, he had demonstrated many specialties that he was good at one after another, the most famous among them being the sweet and sour pork ribs made with Ji Zhi Syrup <sup>3</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(A traditional Chinese medicine..)</dfn>

    <p>When Wang Ling went downstairs, he saw that many guests had already arrived.</p>

    <p>This time, those taking part in the judging weren't just the people in the Wang family's small villa; Wang Ming, Thunder, Immortal Toya, Xiao Yin, Zhai Yin and Jiang Haifu's son Jiang Bai were all here... In addition, Liu Qingyi and Wang Zhen were here.</p>

    <p>It looked like Book of Sage Immortal's deduction was utterly correct...</p>

    <p>If Gu Shunzhi didn't come, these two people would be together all day long, and might develop feelings for each other even if they were foes!</p>

    <p>But if Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi did develop these mutual feelings in the future, then what was it that would cause this to happen?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was suddenly a little curious...</p>
