  <h1>Chapter 1149 Your Excellencies, Times Have Changed</h1>

  <div>

    <p>As the students of Number 60 High made their approach through the thick jungle, the noise up ahead got even louder. As Gu Shunzhi had thought, two different school delegations were battling it out. They traded punches and kicks, and while it looked very dangerous, there was in fact a clear division of labor.</p>

    <p>The two teams clashed, but didn't go all out. They still had to consider the follow-up, and wanted to conserve strength. This sudden encounter was at most just testing each other out.</p>

    <p>It was a fight between Foundation Establishment students. To Wang Ling, there wasn't really anything worth watching. Their kung fu skills were too weak; he might as well watch <em>Ip Man</em> at twice the speed</p>

    <p>"One side has a cute pink school uniform and the other has a purple school uniform. What schools are these?" Chen Chao watched the fight from where he was hiding in the underbrush.</p>

    <p>"I'm not sure..." Guo Hao shook his head. There were too many schools in the competition this time, and many of them were from other cities. Even he, the gossip expert, had a hard time recognizing all the schools.</p>

    <p>As the two of them chatted quietly, the main forces of both teams decided to stop at that moment, and calm returned briefly to the noisy jungle.</p>

    <p>A boy from the main force in the cute pink school uniform stepped forward. "Brother! Both our teams aren't fighting with all our strength here; this is just a waste of strength and makes no sense at all! If two dogs fight over a bone, a third might run away with it - if some other team hears us and runs over to take advantage, we'll both lose out. How about we stop first?"</p>

    <p>Hearing this suggestion, the captain of the team in purple also stepped forward. "Good! I think you have a point. But since we've both decided to stop, how about we form an alliance here? We'll help each other out and stick together for the first few days. If we're separated after that, we'll go back to fighting for our own teams."</p>

    <p>"I think that's a good suggestion!"</p>

    <p>"Then shall we form an alliance?"</p>

    <p>"Alright!"</p>

    <p>"May I ask, brother, this cute pink school uniform of yours - which school are you from?"</p>

    <p>"I am from Number 8 West City High in Guangxi city!"</p>

    <p>"You're students from Guangxi, too? So are we! We are Purple Garden High School!"</p>

    <p>"So you are comrades from Purple Garden High School! Your headmistress Zi Yan is a well-known goddess in the headmaster circle!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"???" Watching the two schools that had been fighting fiercely earlier actually start to discuss an alliance, Chen Chao couldn't make sense of this plot development. They had been waiting here for so long to take advantage of the situation, but in the end, the two schools were about to form an alliance, which would be bad for them.</p>

    <p>"I'll do it." Xia Ming let out a sinister laugh. Wang Ling sensed the evil spirit qi that gathered on Xia Ming's fingertips. To everyone else, this spirit energy might look very pure, but in Wang Ling's eyes, it was simply unbearably foul. Although he did feel that Xia Ming was very strong, Wang Ling was well aware that this power didn't belong to Xia Ming.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had been thinking about helping Xia Ming undo the curse. But the evil spirit qi that had taken root in Xia Ming's body seemed even stronger than Wang Ling had thought. If it had only been on the surface before, it was now starting to eat away at Xia Ming's insides, like he was a rotten fruit. If even his inner core started to rot, things would get really messy.</p>

    <p>Xia Ming skillfully wielded this spirit qi that didn't belong to him and it carelessly hooked around the ankle of a student from Purple Garden High School up ahead. Then, as if he was being controlled, he threw a punch at a Number 8 West City High girl in that cute pink uniform!</p>

    <p>Bang!</p>

    <p>The girl was sent flying as the punch, and she smashed through several trees before she stopped and was actually sent out by the protective golden talisman.</p>

    <p>The boy who had been manipulated was dumbstruck. His punch was so extraordinarily powerful that even he himself found it unexpected. Usually, no matter how much strength he put into his blow, it wouldn't have this sort of explosive force!</p>

    <p>"What are you doing? Didn't we say that we would form an alliance..." The captain of Number 8 West City High School was furious. He never thought that Purple Garden High School would go back on its word.</p>

    <p>"It wasn't me. I couldn't control my body. There has to be some misunderstanding!" The boy who had thrown the punch had a wretched, helpless expression on his face.</p>

    <p>After that, because of Xia Ming's instigation, the two schools who had initially decided to form an alliance started fighting again. Xia Ming, the culprit, smiled wickedly, as if he was very satisfied with his work.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao and Guo Hao were utterly horrified by this operation. Xia Ming didn't usually give them the impression that he was strong... Why did it seem like he had been injected with chicken blood today?</p>

    <p>"Xia Ming, you're so strong!" Chen Chao couldn't help but say.</p>

    <p>"Of course!" Xia Ming was immensely pleased with himself.</p>

    <p>The feeling of having obtained power was so wonderful, and the fact that he had just put on such a good show in front of Sun Rong made him feel especially satisfied.</p>

    <p>As long as he had this power...</p>

    <p>Yes! As long as he had this power, he could even help Number 60 High win first place!</p>

    <p>As long as he used this power well and continued to put on a good show in front of Classmate Sun Rong, Wang Ling was nobody!</p>

    <p>Xia Ming had wild thoughts of the future, and his confidence had never been greater.</p>

    <p>But Chen Chao still stubbornly asked, "Are you high on drugs?"</p>

    <p>"No." Xia Ming denied it flatly. "Can't you think better of me? This is for the sake of winning honor for our school."</p>

    <p>"Of course I want to think better of you, but you're so strong now... It's incomprehensible! So, I feel that there can only be two possibilities. Either you're hiding something, or you've been possessed by the Holy Devil." When Chen Chao said that, Xia Ming couldn't help the cold sweat that broke out on his forehead. He had long heard of Chen Chao's famous enlightened mouth. Now that the truth had inadvertently come out, all of Xia Ming's hair stood on end.</p>

    <p>It wasn't just Xia Ming, but Wang Ling also couldn't help sweating a little...</p>

    <p>Chen Chao was indeed spot on, especially when he was making random guesses.</p>

    <p>As long as it wasn't "prized milk," Chen Chao would almost always hit the nail on the head.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High, who had been lying in wait for a long time, saw that both sides had pretty much exhausted all their physical strength after a fierce battle. Sun Rong immediately opened her sword spirit space and gave them the spirit swords that had been hidden inside it.</p>

    <p>And so, while the students of Number 8 City West High School and Purple Garden High School were duking it out intensely, everyone from Number 60 High charged out of the underbrush with spirit swords in hand.</p>

    <p>"Fuck! Isn't this a body technique exchange meet? How can you bring in spirit swords?!" The captains of both schools were stunned.</p>

    <p>Holding his spirit sword Ghost Tooth, Guo Hao smiled sheepishly. "If I said that we forged these swords just now, would you believe me?"</p>

    <p>"Like hell!" the captains shouted practically in unison.</p>

    <p>"Then there's no choice." Guo Hao sighed. "It's because we're skilled that we were able to bring our swords in; this can't be considered cheating... Also, let me give the both of you a reminder."</p>

    <p>"???"</p>

    <p>"Times have changed, Your Excellencies."</p>

    <p>With that, Guo Hao threw out Ghost Tooth. When the hooked blade was flung out, it flew past the two captains like a powerful boomerang to slice through a big tree behind them.</p>

    <p>The two captains laughed at him. "Brother, you missed your mark."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao recalled Ghost Tooth and gently wagged his finger at the two individuals, before he pointed to the tree.</p>

    <p>The tree, whose trunk was so thick that it would take five or six people to hold hands around it, fell onto the heads of the two captains...</p>

    <p>Both of them were sent out by the protective golden talismans at the same time.</p>
