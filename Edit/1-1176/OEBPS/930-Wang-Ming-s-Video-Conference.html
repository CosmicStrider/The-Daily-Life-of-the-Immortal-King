  <h1>Chapter 930 Wang Ming's Video Conference</h1>

  <div>

    <p>From what Wang Ming and Zhai Yin could see, magic treasure scientific experts from all over the world were attending this video conference, some of whom were heavyweight figures. Wang Ming's gaze swept over them before his eyes turned slightly disappointed.</p>

    <p>"Aren't they very amazing people? Why do you look a little unhappy?" said Zhai Yin.</p>

    <p>"There are too few inventors; the ones I mentioned just now are the famous ones, while the rest are research cannon."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin: "Weapons?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "Mouth cannons <sup>1</sup> ."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Refers to "braggarts" in Chinese.)</dfn>

    <p>Zhai Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>The "mouth cannon" was a mystical thing; it could trigger a war, but it could also bring peace. There were people in this world who could even freely use the art of the mouth cannon to wash someone clean or throw mud at them. The only limitation was that it took three times the effort to wash someone clean than to blacken their name...</p>

    <p>No wonder Old Qi hadn't wanted to attend this meeting; it looked like he already knew who would be attending.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming's lips thinned.</p>

    <p>A superior's order was the law! He had no reason to refuse Old Qi.</p>

    <p>After thinking for a while, Wang Ming let out a sigh.</p>

    <p>Actually, he didn't have to listen to them speak; he'd just treat it as an amusement.</p>

    <p>In any case, they were just a bunch of armchair strategists.</p>

    <p>Language barriers weren't a problem in this video conference, since any talk would be translated in real time by a built-in software.</p>

    <p>In other words, when a person spoke in their mother tongue in the video, the software would translate his words into a language that everyone could understand.</p>

    <p>After twenty minutes or so, the video conference began.</p>

    <p>Experts from different countries appeared on the screen in very small windows that densely packed the online conference room. It was only when they were saying something that the smart video screen would pick it up and their window would be enlarged.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming didn't rush to put forward his theory, but wanted to listen to what the foreign experts had to say.</p>

    <p>At that moment, a window suddenly enlarged, and an uncle with a full beard in a white coat and a white canvas hat spoke.</p>

    <p>The real-time interpretation software translated his words into a heavy "curry" accent. "Friends from all across the world, hello. I am the head of Magic Treasure Studies and lead professor of the Strategic Magic Treasure Research Society in Yinxiu nation. My name is Rossi Zeus Suess; you can call me Suess. Regarding the explosion of abnormal energy this time, my society has a new analytical report on it."</p>

    <p>A lot of people in the video instantly quieted down. Some sat upright and still as they looked at this Professor Suess with serious expressions, while some bent their heads and seemed to be jotting down things in a notebook.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming didn't know very much about this Professor Suess, so couldn't make much comment.</p>

    <p>But someone who could become the head of Yinxiu's research institute should be really something.</p>

    <p>"Our preliminary conclusion is that the abnormal energy fluctuations this time is likely largely connected to our Yinxiu's famous dish, curry."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming and Zhai Yin took deep breaths at the same time. "..."</p>

    <p>Sure enough, heads of institutes nowadays knew how to spout nonsense.</p>

    <p>Professor Suess spoke very confidently. "Everyone should know how delicious our Indian curry is; our most famous signature curry rice paste is endorsed by international film celebrity Mr Wang Jingze <sup>2</sup> . Since the energy fluctuations this time have troubled everyone, our Yinxiu nation will take full responsibility. Our king has already decided to give every nation a twenty percent discount on curry orders! So..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(The spoilt city teenager who
went viral for refusing to eat
fried rice on a village program
before doing an about face to
say it was delicious ..)</dfn>

    <p>When he said that, Professor Suess's video feed was directly cut off.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin: "What happened?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming chuckled. "The super admin banned him."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin was taken aback. "There's even a super admin here..."</p>

    <p>"He's with the United Nations. All international video conferences are regulated by super admins. Since Yinxiu nation's financial affairs this year aren't looking good, I guess this head had no choice and was forced to do some promotion through this video conference." Wang Ming smiled wickedly.</p>

    <p>Although Professor Suess's video feed had been cut off by the super admin, he had already achieved his advertising purpose...</p>

    <p>A recording of the video conference would be backed up for the leaders of various nations, and there would inevitably be those who would want to buy curry when they saw the video.</p>

    <p>For the sake of selling curry, Professor Suess was banned from speaking for seventy-two hours.</p>

    <p>But not long before Professor Suess went offline, another window expanded to reveal a scientist in a white lab coat who was as robust as a bear. "Hello, everyone, I am Elizabeth Putin from Maoxiu."</p>

    <p>This was a Maossian.</p>

    <p>The people of Maoxiu were famous for fighting, and the nation was still a military power.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming knew quite a bit about this group of people, and felt that some of them were pretty talented. That was because many of the latest weapons currently being developed by Huaxiu's research institute was in collaboration with researchers from Maoxiu nation.</p>

    <p>"Everyone, based on our analysis, we suspect that the abnormal energy fluctuations this time was a devouring phenomenon."</p>

    <p>As Wang Ming expected, this Mr Elizabeth from Maoxiu nation shared his view.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming saw all the international experts raise their heads at this and send strings of bullet messages.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin was startled yet again. "You can even send bullet messages?"</p>

    <p>"It's a video conference, after all. Too many questions are asked, so a bullet message function was embedded in international video conferencing. Similarly, the software will directly translate the words," said Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>After that, a lot of bullet messages flew over this Maossian's head.</p>

    <p>Many people were asking what the devouring phenomenon was.</p>

    <p>Thus, this expert explained, "To put it simply, this sudden phenomenon was very likely part of an alien invasion, but for some reason, they suddenly decided to abandon it, which is why the abnormal energy we detected went back to normal.</p>

    <p>"If they hadn't decided to give up, our Earth would have been completely in the grips of this energy in less than a day." This Maossian expert spoke very vividly; as he explained the situation, he also gestured with his hands. "So, to deal with any future invasion from an alien civilization, and in the event that they attempt to devour the earth, I propose that cultivators all over the world unite and immediately launch the Wandering Earth project!"</p>

    <p>The Wandering Earth project...</p>

    <p>Realization dawned on everyone and they were stunned by this grand plan.</p>

    <p>"Are there any specifics for this operation?" someone raised a hand and asked.</p>

    <p>The Maossian expert raised one finger and replied, "The first step! Build new toilets on one side of the Earth! And we have to build a lot of them! My initial plan is to build a toilet park with enough toilets for half the cultivators on the planet!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was shaken.</p>

    <p>Building toilets... What kind of operation was that...</p>
