  <h1>Chapter 323 The Most Important Thing for a Family Is to Be Neat and Tidy </h1>

  <div>

    <p>What was he trying to do?</p>

    <p>Kidnapping a girl and forcing her to say he was her father in broad daylight?</p>

    <p>Since it was a little past four o'clock after school, there were basically very few people around. Although a few passersby saw this scene, no one dared to step in.</p>

    <p>To many people, this just looked like a helpless father dragging a disobedient daughter off. Furthermore, the man was scolding the girl loudly for being unreasonable and wanting to run away from home, making him so worried... hearing this, many people didn't want to get involved.</p>

    <p>After all, it was someone else's business; why be a busybody?</p>

    <p>At one glance, however, Father Wang felt that there was something fishy about the identity of the man in the woollen hat.</p>

    <p>Father Wang couldn't quite describe this feeling; perhaps it was a sixth sense. He didn't have Wang Ling's Great Blood Origin Spell which could directly analyze and compare the blood connection between two people, but Father Wang thought that his sixth sense was spot on... and what he was feeling was that this man in the woollen hat wasn't the girl's father.</p>

    <p>There was a good saying: The most important thing for a family was to be neat and tidy <sup>1</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is sort of a classic line
used in many Chinese dramas
produced by TVB ..)</dfn>

    <p>The girl was wearing brand labels from head to toe; how could her father be an uncouth man in a dusty gray woollen hat?</p>

    <p>When a person was doing something suspicious, they would definitely feel guilty when they were stared at.</p>

    <p>Under the Wang family's two hereditary dead fish eye stares, this man in the gray woollen hat almost immediately felt like his head was going to explode.</p>

    <p>Before Father Wang had stepped forward to say something, the man already couldn't help roaring, "What are you looking at?! Never seen a man disciplining his own daughter?!"</p>

    <p>The girl was frightened by the man's roar. Her eyes were already wet and she had a terrified expression on her face. She shook her head as hard as she could, and found that she couldn't speak!</p>

    <p>This was the man's doing â€” when he had been pulling her earlier, Wang Ling had clearly seen him release his aura to seal the girl's tongue acupuncture point.</p>

    <p>The girl could only desperately shake her head in Father Wang's direction in a plea for rescue. None of the people passing by had dared to step in, and she was clutching onto her latest and last straw for help.</p>

    <p>Thus, in the next moment, Father Wang stepped forward decisively and said a classic movie line: "Let go of that girl!"</p>

    <p>The face of the man in the woollen hat darkened. "Mind your own business, or you'll regret it!"</p>

    <p>The man's expression and tone were fierce; it was clear that Father Wang's boldness didn't scare him. Father Wang was just at the Qi Condensation level, so the man didn't take him seriously at all. He thought he had their precise measure as he sized Father Wang and Wang Ling up and down: a Qi Condensation father with his Foundation Establishment son from a nearby high school; they completely weren't any threat to him.</p>

    <p>And most importantly, he was surprised to realize that the boy with dead fish eyes was actually pretty good-looking. He had been told especially to bring back some good-looking students. The girl he had was one, and this boy was another. If he could bring the both of them back, he would definitely score a lot of points with the organization!</p>

    <p>With a sly look on his face, he stared at Father Wang and laughed. "Is this your son?"</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "That's right."</p>

    <p>The man: "Great! But from now on, he's my son!"</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "???"</p>

    <p>Saying that, the man quickly sealed the girl's acupuncture points so that she couldn't move. Then he pointed directly at Wang Ling, and a burst of strong qi shot out from his finger.</p>

    <p>This was strong qi for sealing acupuncture points, and the man had taken a very long time to refine this skill. Everyone in the organization had been specially trained in this skill until they made next to no mistakes when using it. Once someone was hit by it, their eight extraordinary meridians would be instantly sealed. This trick was particularly effective on cultivators below the Golden Core stage.</p>

    <p>However, the situation was somewhat out of the man's expectations.</p>

    <p>When this strong qi hit that youngster, it unexpectedly turned around, bouncing back with twice the force! It was clearly just strong qi for sealing the acupuncture points, but in that moment, it was like a spirit bomb hurtling rapidly at him!</p>

    <p>Before he could let out a curse, the backlash of the aura had pierced him through his shoulder.</p>

    <p>His face instantly twisted with pain, and the man stared stupefied at Wang Ling. "You..."</p>

    <p>The backlash had caught him off guard; he couldn't figure out at all how a Foundation Establishment high school student had managed to strike back.</p>

    <p>He was well aware that he had already failed in his mission this time. He could only give up on both the girl and the boy in front of him; right now, escape was his top priority.</p>

    <p>But very quickly, he realized that once again, he had been thinking too much.</p>

    <p>Strong spiritual pressure froze him in place, and all his muscles instantly locked up!</p>

    <p>It was impossible for a high school student at the Foundation Establishment stage to have such spiritual pressure!</p>

    <p>The man's eyes were bloodshot and his face was full of resentment. The organization had sent out so many people, and he had never thought that he would actually be the first one to get caught.</p>

    <p>"Surprised?"</p>

    <p>Father Wang stared at him and smiled. "Just get used to it."</p>

    <p>The man: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had never thought that he would stumble so quickly upon the breakthrough which the police had been working so hard for. Whether the man knew anything or not, from his current behavior, he definitely had something to do with Shuigou Sect.</p>

    <p>After that, Wang Ling manipulated his spiritual pressure to directly unseal the girl's acupuncture points from afar, before deliberately hiding behind Father Wang so that she wouldn't be able to see his face from this angle.</p>

    <p>"Thank you... Really, thank you so much!"</p>

    <p>The girl's voice was still a little shaky once she could move again, but it was clear from her tone that she had already calmed down a fair bit. She tried to sneak a look at Wang Ling, but was blocked by Father Wang. "Which high school are you from? Why aren't you wearing your school uniform? Where're your parents? Why didn't they come to pick you up?"</p>

    <p>The girl lowered her head. "I'm from Jinyuan High School... My father actually wanted to come get me, but I didn't think it was a big deal, so I told him not to come and that I could go home by myself."</p>

    <p>"These two days are different; don't you know how many students have been taken? Young people... even if you're being rebellious, there has to be a limit to your willfulness." Father Wang sighed and said nothing more beyond this casual admonishment since it wasn't worth it. After all, she wasn't his daughter; it was still better for her own parents to discipline her.</p>

    <p>"Uncle is right. I won't do it again..." It was obvious that this rebellious girl had been truly frightened by what had just happened, and she lowered her head in front of Father Wang, not even daring to breathe loudly.</p>

    <p>The feeling of being grabbed by a stranger and forced to admit that she was his daughter, helpless and unable to defend herself... it had been too unbearable.</p>

    <p>"Wait for a minute, I'll have my son call his friend to come by. That person is from the General Administration of 100 Schools. It'll put my mind at ease if he can send you home." Father Wang stared at the girl and sighed. Now that he had lent a hand, of course he was going to do his best.</p>

    <p>The girl clutched the hem of her shirt with both hands. "Thank you, uncle..."</p>

    <p>While they were talking, Father Wang suddenly noticed that although the girl's head was lowered, she kept glancing at Wang Ling, intentionally or otherwise. But her line of sight was mostly blocked by Father Wang, and she was too shy to look at Wang Ling head-on... At last, she couldn't help frowning.</p>

    <p>Seeing this, Father Wang couldn't help laughing. "What are you looking at?"</p>

    <p>The girl lowered her head shyly. "..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "Stop looking... it's impossible for the two of you!"</p>

    <p>The girl: "..."</p>
