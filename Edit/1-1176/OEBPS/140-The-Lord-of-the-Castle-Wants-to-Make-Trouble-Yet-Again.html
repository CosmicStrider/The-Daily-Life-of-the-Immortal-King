  <h1>Chapter 140 The Lord of the Castle Wants to Make Trouble Yet Again </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Second Hospital had thirty floors in total, and treated various types of strange patients.</p>

    <p>When they reached the elevator, a little sister nurse happened to be pushing a hospital cart out of the large elevator. When she saw Director Li, she hurriedly bowed and greeted him. "Director Li, good morning!"</p>

    <p>Director Li had a good memory; he could recall most of the names of the nurses who worked in this hospital building, and could remember which patients they were looking after.</p>

    <p>"Little Liu, how is the patient's situation today?" he asked.</p>

    <p>The patient whom Nurse Liu was looking after was very special. Speaking of him, the little sister nurse's willow eyebrows pulled down and she looked very frustrated. "Same as usual, the patient keeps spouting nonsense about how he is a time traveler and claims that he has a superpower!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "What superpower?"</p>

    <p>"I'll show you..."</p>

    <p>After saying that, Nurse Liu immediately jumped left and right and roared loudly, " <em>Whoosh </em>!"</p>

    <p>Director Li: "..."</p>

    <p>After this shameful performance, Nurse Liu swiftly regained her composure and drew in a deep breath. "That patient keeps saying he can teleport in an instant."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"As you can see, we have a lot of strange patients here. Over the last few years, Huaguo Water Curtain Group has also given us a substantial investment to establish a research office for hard-to-treat cases... but most unfortunately, we haven't been able to find any effective cures for these illnesses yet." Director Li sighed.</p>

    <p>They followed Director Li into the elevator, and he pressed the button for the eighteenth floor. "The wards in this building are arranged by the complexity of a patient's condition. The more difficult the illness is to treat, the higher the floor."</p>

    <p>"How are these three kids?"</p>

    <p>When Lord Diulei saw that they were going to the eighteenth floor, his heart couldn't help quaking.</p>

    <p>It was already the eighteenth floor... then what the hell kind of mental cases lived on the thirtieth floor?!</p>

    <p>The state of health of patients in the separate compound was basically confidential information, but Director Li had still managed to learn some things through his connections. He was frowning as the elevator went up. "As far as I know, the situation is basically under control for two of the three children, but just barely; there's a possibility that things can still get out of hand at any time. The remaining child is in a worse condition."</p>

    <p>"Does the hospital know what the ingredients in the mutation potion are?" Lord Diulei asked.</p>

    <p>"They signed confidentiality agreements with the families and gave them substantial compensation. They wouldn't even give us the ingredients for the drug, and completely left it to us to treat them with our own methods."</p>

    <p>Director Li shook his head. "According to current treatment results, that potion not only affected their cell structures, it also seems to have ravaged their minds... you'll see what I mean when we reach the ward..."</p>

    <p>Some seconds later, the elevator reached the corresponding floor, and Director Li led them through a long corridor to the innermost ward. The ward was very large, and held three beds which were separated from each other by glass partitions.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling immediately saw three boys around his age. One sat on his bed clapping non-stop; one was lying completely motionless on the bed, as straight as a pole; and the third boy was simply lying on his stomach on the floor, in the arms of Mother Earth.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that his horizons had been expanded... there was a saying that mentally ill people were broad in their thinking, and this was so true. He was stunned to find that his Mind-Reading Ability was completely useless on these three people, just like when the old man had had dementia previously.</p>

    <p>Director Li pointed to the first patient who was clapping his hands. "Patient One, after taking the mutation potion, always thinks that he can summon the Heavenly Flame."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei asked doubtfully, "Then why is he clapping his hands?"</p>

    <p>Director Li: "He's imitating the Angry Buddha Fire Lotus."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>"Don't be fooled, currently the situation can already be considered under control since he's just clapping. Before, every time he clapped his hands, he would yell 'Angry Buddha Fire Lotus'... so, we've defined his illness as acute chuuni <sup>1</sup> syndrome."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(In case you need the
reminder, 'chuuni' is short
for the Japanese term
'chuunibyou,' which
translates to 'second year of
middle school sickness,' and
describes teenagers going
through a phase where they try to act cool or edgy.)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Director Li pointed to the second patient. "For Patient Two, the powerful side effects of the mutation potion completely stripped him of his autonomous abilities."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Like people in a vegetative state?"</p>

    <p>Director Li nodded. "You could call it a conscious vegetative state. He can eat, but food has to be put into his mouth. The worst was when he no longer even bothered to chew. So since then, we've switched to transfusions to provide his body with nutrients. We've defined his illness as chronic <em>geyou </em><sup>2</sup> paralyzed salted-fish syndrome."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Ge You is an actor who starred
in a TV comedy sitcom called
'I Loved My Family.' A
screencap of a scene where
he's slouching down on a sofa
low enough that he's almost
lying flat became a Chinese
online viral meme ..)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>After that, Director Li pointed to the last patient. "Among the three of them, the mutation might be considered a success in Patient Three, but his abilities are very weak."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Why is he lying face down?"</p>

    <p>Director Li's expression was calm. "He's imitating Spiderman."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Not long after Wang Ling and Lord Diulei had followed Director Li into the Night Shift Nurses building, the window of a Maybach in the parking lot slowly rolled down; the person sitting in the driver's seat was Song Qingshu's tall subordinate.</p>

    <p>He had watched them enter the building before immediately calling Song Qingshu to report the situation. "Lord Director, you guessed right. The matter has indeed drawn attention..."</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu sighed quietly. Sure enough, it had been a good move to send someone to monitor the situation!</p>

    <p>"What are we going to do now?" asked the tall man in a suit.</p>

    <p>"The Lord has expressly said that no outsiders can ever find out about the potion. After Third Saint's betrayal, the Lord has always been worried that this person would move against us. I never expected it to happen so soon!" Song Qingshu's words were neither hurried nor slow. "We currently have two options. We can either get rid of the three students or get rid of these visitors."</p>

    <p>The man in a suit was obviously stupefied. "...Lord Director, with all due respect, it seems almost impossible to kill these two people..."</p>

    <p>"Although our strength is not what it once was, there are still seven people left in the Ten Saints. Is there any issue that can't be handled by seven Soul Formation cultivators? It's just two people, right?"</p>

    <p>Man in a suit: "But of these two people... one is Great Death-Courting Senior."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu wanted to curse. <em>Motherfucker! Why is it him again?!</em></p>

    <p>Forcing himself to calm down, he drew in a deep breath. "Then... who is the other person?"</p>

    <p>"It's a youngster... he's always with Great Death-Courting Senior, and they drove here together! But Great Death-Courting Senior seems to respect him very much," the man in a suit replied honestly.</p>

    <p>A youngster who came together with Lord Diulei?</p>

    <p>Since the last time when they'd lost the two top generals Great Saint and Second Saint, the word "youngster" had already cast a deep psychological shadow in Song Qingshu's heart... don't tell him it was the one who had been at Lord Diulei's villa back then?</p>

    <p>As he considered this, his hands shook of their own accord.</p>

    <p>Was he actually scared?</p>
