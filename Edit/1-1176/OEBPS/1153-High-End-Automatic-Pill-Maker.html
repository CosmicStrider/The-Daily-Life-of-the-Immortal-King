  <h1>Chapter 1153 High-End Automatic Pill Maker</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Human Devil Xia Lixing really lived up to his reputation; the highest realm wasn't to devour all living things, but to meld them all together.</p>

    <p>After cultivating the "Holy Devil Imprisonment Technique" to perfection, Xia Lixing could easily turn himself into a shadow and lurk in the shadows of living things as he waited for the right moment.</p>

    <p>It was usually difficult to detect this sort of hidden operation.</p>

    <p>Well...</p>

    <p>It wasn't anything out of the ordinary.</p>

    <p>The truth was that the moment Xia Ling set his eye on Number 60 High, Wang Ling had already detected his presence.</p>

    <p>It was just that Wang Ling didn't know that the person following him was the legendary Human Devil Xia Lixing.</p>

    <p>After all, Wang Ling hadn't even been born when Xia Lixing rampaged through the world.</p>

    <p>But times had changed and things were different now.</p>

    <p>No one could have expected that one day, an invincible baby would be born.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, the baby's parents were crazy enough to have a second child...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In fact, it wasn't just Wang Ling who had noticed Xia Lixing; so had Fang Xing, Wang Zhen, Liu Qingyi, Gu Shunzhi and Zhenyuan.</p>

    <p>But when they saw that Wang Ling wasn't taking any action, they didn't hurry to act.</p>

    <p>In the next moment, they communicated with each other in the mental space constructed from their thoughts.</p>

    <p>"I sense malice behind us. Should we do something to get rid of it?" Wang Zhen asked. Used to his parents beating him up since young, he was especially sensitive to malice. Wang Zhen had known the moment Xia Lixing appeared, and he had swiftly thought up countermeasures. When it came to Xia Lixing's devouring spell, which he relied on to get stronger, normal attacks were sure to be ineffective; only a combined mental attack to severely injure his soul would work.</p>

    <p>"But Ling Zhenren hasn't made a move yet; I think we should just let it be. In any case, he isn't much of a threat; he's just an annoying mosquito." Liu Qingyi shook her head slightly. Devouring spells might appear tricky, but they were in fact just child's play in the Domain of the Gods above. Nowadays, most cultivators who still used devouring spells to become stronger had unstable foundations - they looked strong, but would collapse at a single blow.</p>

    <p>"I also think that there's some deeper meaning for Ling Zhenren to not act. Why don't we leave it for now and observe the situation?" Zhenyuan also nodded his head and expressed his opinion in the mental chat space. "My Crimson Flame Jade Ruler Mirror can combat this sort of devilish spell. If necessary, I can directly wipe this devil off the map at any time without leaving a trace."</p>

    <p>"There's no need to use a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Immortal, you can relax. I just checked the Heavenly Dao list, and I've discovered that this Xia Lixing is currently on the Heavenly Dao wanted list. He'll be punished by Heavenly Dao for his cruelty, so it makes no difference if we leave him alone for now. He'll disappear sooner or later," Gu Shunzhi said at that moment. He was the cosmic keeper of order, and knew the name of every wicked person.</p>

    <p>While Xia Lixing had a very high criminal index value in this world, he didn't even rank in the top 100 on the Heavenly Dao wanted list.</p>

    <p>So after Gu Shunzhi checked this Human Devil Xia Lixing's wanted index value, he instantly lost interest in him. This was nothing more than an ant that could be squashed to death at any time; how could he possibly be more important than the competition?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Xia Lixing was feeling a little suspicious - for some reason, he felt like he had been discovered?</p>

    <p>But these people in front of him were nothing more than students of a cultivation high school.</p>

    <p>Indeed, Xia Lixing didn't really believe that he had been discovered. They were just a bunch of Foundation Establishment students... How could they possibly detect him?</p>

    <p>He had to be mistaken.</p>

    <p>He was extremely confident in his "Holy Devil Imprisonment Technique." Logically speaking, no one should be able to detect him when he was hiding. Now, however, Xia Lixing was starting to have doubts about this operation.</p>

    <p>Thus, he didn't take action right away, but decided to observe for a while longer.</p>

    <p>Then, it turned into a very bizarre scene.</p>

    <p>At that very moment, six people from Number 60 High were aware of Xia Lixing's existence.</p>

    <p>But the grand and mighty Human Devil Xia Lixing didn't know that he had become their target...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Late in the afternoon, Number 60 High occupied a pretty good position on Fire Peak.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Guo Hao, Chen Chao and Xia Ming were responsible for cutting down trees and gathering wood to build a temporary camp.</p>

    <p>The two ladies Li Youyue and Liu Qingyi were in charge of lighting a fire for cooking.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen, Gu Shunzhi, Zhenyuan and Fang Xing were responsible for collecting spirit plants and hunting.</p>

    <p>Hunting wasn't anything difficult for them.</p>

    <p>Because of Xiao Yin and Er Ha's earlier summons, the level two serpent king and monkey king were also responsible for helping out in the jungle hunt as they offered up prey as sacrifice to Number 60 High... Thus, the food Number 60 High had that night was especially plentiful. In addition to the spirit fruits and berries on Nine Dragon Mountain which they had collected, Wang Zhen and the others had also caught a wild level four fire yak, which was enough food for all of them.</p>

    <p>"Level four? How did you catch it?" Li Youyue found it incredible; she had initially thought that catching a few pheasants would already be amazing enough.</p>

    <p>They could actually eat beef on the first day of this survival battle...</p>

    <p>"It wasn't that hard. We had barely gone a few steps when we saw it lying to one side and already dying. To end Brother Yak's pain, I went up and finished it with one strike," Wang Zhen said.</p>

    <p>Li Youyue: "..."</p>

    <p>On the other side, the construction of the camp was also done. Wang Ling actually didn't help much, only because Chen Chao and Guo Hao were too enthusiastic. After cutting down the trees, they used their spirit swords to slice the tree trunks lengthwise, before they carefully peeled off the rough tree bark. This bark was very dry, and could be used to make a fire.</p>

    <p>They then gathered lots of banana leaves to cover the tops of the huts, and just like that, two temporary huts were set up, one for the boys and one for the girls.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao was sweating profusely, but he couldn't hide his excitement. "This really is like a real life version of Minecraft! How exciting!"</p>

    <p>Once the two huts were set up, everyone looked again at the huge number projected over the dome-shaped peak.</p>

    <p>[Survivors remaining: 678]</p>

    <p>Nearly seventy more students had been eliminated...</p>

    <p>"Two people per team on sentry duty tonight; we'll rotate every hour." After giving the instruction, Sun Rong began to use some of the spirit plants collected by Wang Zhen and the others to make medicine.</p>

    <p>"Don't you need equipment?" Wang Zhen asked.</p>

    <p>"Of course I do." Saying this, Sun Rong opened Mysterious Sea's sword spirit space once again and took out a multi-functional, high-end automatic pill maker.</p>

    <p>This was a foolproof machine - the spirit plants and herbal medicine just needed to be put into the machine, which would automatically filter them and quickly make the medicine based on what was required. It was a lot more convenient than a pill furnace! Furthermore, this automatic pill maker was also exclusive to Huaguo Water Curtain Group.</p>

    <p>Everyone was stupefied. "Even this is possible?"</p>

    <p>All the headmasters in the command center were also astonished.</p>

    <p>"Wasn't it said that it can't be considered cheating if we can bring things in undetected?" Sun Rong smiled bashfully.</p>

    <p>Actually, there was also a compressed high-end villa capsule in her sword spirit space... It just needed to be thrown on the ground, and a villa would instant spring up.</p>

    <p>But on second thought, Sun Rong felt that this might be too much and could even destroy the balance in the game, so she didn't take it out.</p>

    <p>However, when it came down to it, as long as Number 60 High had Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>The balance would always be broken...</p>
