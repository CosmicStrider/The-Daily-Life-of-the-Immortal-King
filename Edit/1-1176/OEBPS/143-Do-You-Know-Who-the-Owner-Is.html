  <h1>Chapter 143 Do You Know Who the Owner Is? </h1>

  <div>

    <p>After obtaining some information from Second Hospital, Lord Diulei and Wang Ling went back down with Director Li. Lord Diulei frowned deeply; he hadn't been able to relax since entering the hospital building.</p>

    <p>"Director Li, please take good care of these three kids. I, Lei Mouren, will definitely investigate this thoroughly."</p>

    <p>"Senior Immortal, rest assured. Even if you didn't ask me to, I'll do my utmost. This bunch of profiteers producing three-no-goods <sup>1</sup> is too hateful!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Three-no-goods 三无产品 are
products that lack a
manufacturer's name or
address, a production date, or
quality certification ..)</dfn>

    <p>Director Li nodded. He knew it would not be an easy matter to investigate, because the other party had very broad financial resources. From the first moment that the three students had developed unusual symptoms, the other party had settled it privately, giving each family compensation which they couldn't refuse.</p>

    <p>But both Director Li and Lord Diulei felt that the compensation couldn't be used as a reason for preventing the truth from being exposed. These Foundation Establishment students, who were the hope for the future of the nation, had actually been treated like lab rats in human experiments... currently, the issue only seemed to be three students on the surface, but it was really too horrible to contemplate how much darkness there was behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>When they reached the hospital building's entrance, Director Li bowed. "Please be very careful, Senior, the forces behind this group of people are very powerful... my master knows you're investigating this on your own, so he's very worried. If you need any help, you can speak up in the group. If everyone works together, there will definitely be no problems!"</p>

    <p>"Did Brother Toya say that?" asked Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>"That's right! These are my master's words!" Director Li answered.</p>

    <p>"Tell Brother Toya not to worry. If I really can't deal with this matter, I'll definitely ask for help." Lord Diulei smiled. "In fact, I'm very thick-skinned."</p>

    <p>"Do your best, Senior!"</p>

    <p>Director Li nodded, then bowed at the entrance. "I still have something I need to deal with back inside, so I'll leave you here!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei nodded. "Mm, go ahead, Director Li. Feel free to contact me if there are any new developments from the drug test."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>As they left the hospital, Lord Diulei kept sighing.</p>

    <p>After their probing this time, he felt that perhaps the children hadn't meant to drink the potion, and had very likely been deceived. These days, it was too easy for those man-eating, black-hearted education institutions to sell their so-called brain-boosting products during tuition lessons.</p>

    <p>In the end, the unlucky and pitiful ones were these oblivious young children...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had originally intended to leave this incident to this forum owner, but it was very apparent that the owner himself was deeply troubled by these subsequent events. Since knowing Lord Diulei, he had never seen the other man wear such a depressed expression before.</p>

    <p>Mo Immortal Castle this organization was too mysterious and too fond of stirring up trouble... Lord Diulei couldn't handle the problem by just relying on his experiences and sense of righteousness anymore.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that the Mo Immortal Castle issue was now already a matter of great urgency.</p>

    <p>And the most critical thing was that the organization had already impinged on his own easy life both overtly and covertly.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Back in the parking lot of the hospital building, Wang Ling discovered traces of a fight.</p>

    <p>A spirit talisman that had been used up would leave behind a unique smell that other people wouldn't be able to detect, but his sense of smell was very sensitive.</p>

    <p>His pupils dilated and the scene in front of him began to rewind. The Heavenly Eye had a flashback ability which allowed Wang Ling to find out what happened in the last half an hour, though not more than that.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sent the images to Lord Diulei's mind, and the man was shocked. "Bloody hell! Brother Ling, your tricycle can speak?"</p>

    <p>Uh... that didn't seem to be the main point.</p>

    <p>The main point was, who was that man in a suit in the Maybach? Why did he want to smash the tricycle with a hammer? In the end, he was sent flying...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei's expression began to change as he carefully scrutinized the flashback images Wang Ling sent to him. Finally, his eyes suddenly widened. He remembered! He had seen that man before! This was the man from Mo Immortal Castle! The supervisor's subordinate!</p>

    <p>"Are we being watched?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei clenched his fists in fury. Was there really no place that this bunch of cretins couldn't get into? Were they eels?</p>

    <p>From a distance, the chief security guard had seen them appear, and he hurried over and pointed to the small tricycle. "Sirs, this cart is yours, right? When you weren't around, this tricycle actually chased after a Maybach... I don't know how, but it came back by itself just now."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Listening to the chief security guard, Lord Diulei felt that he was still too naive! He had thought that this tricycle was just an ordinary transportation vehicle... did Brother Ling enlighten this thing?</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Bingo! Congratulations!</p>

    <p>The chief security guard said helplessly, "Even if you are Director Li's friends, this tricycle and the Maybach which fled did affect other vehicles in our parking lot... sirs, how should we handle this?"</p>

    <p>At that moment, a burly man wearing sunglasses came over. From the Heavenly Eye's flashback of images, both Wang Ling and Lord Diulei immediately knew that this was the owner of the car which that man in a suit had flown into.</p>

    <p>"Was it the two of you who damaged my car?" The man in sunglasses asked.</p>

    <p>"You can't say that... your car was damaged by that Maybach man. How can you blame us?" Lord Diulei gave the man's black supercar a look... a limited edition Bugatti! The car's headlights had both been smashed in by that fucking idiot from Mo Immortal Castle!</p>

    <p>To fix these two big headlights would cost at least one hundred thousand yuan! How many crispy noodle snacks is that?!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought that he and Lord Diulei were very similar in one aspect — they were very thrifty. As they wandered through life, they absolutely wouldn't spend unnecessarily.</p>

    <p>"I don't care. That Maybach man has run away and I can't catch up to him. But you are also indirectly responsible!" The man in sunglasses crossed his arms, and his biceps bulged to strain against his white shirt. "In fact, I'm not the owner, I'm just the driver... do you know whose car this is? If I tell you, it'll scare you to death!"</p>

    <p>"Oh? Scare me to death?" Lord Diulei felt that was hilarious.</p>

    <p>"Do you know Secretary Sun of the Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools? One of the ten founding generals from back then!" The man in sunglasses sneered slightly. "My master is Number 60 High School's legend who reached the Golden Core stage at a young age."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Wang Ling already had a bad feeling...</p>

    <p>"He is the big name who recently prevented two Shadow Stream assassinations through his acute insight... he is now Secretary Sun's favorite, the youngest Director of the General Administration of 100 Schools in history — Zhuo Yi! Are you afraid now?!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>At that very moment, Wang Ling's expression wasn't just disturbed, he even wanted to laugh a little.</p>
