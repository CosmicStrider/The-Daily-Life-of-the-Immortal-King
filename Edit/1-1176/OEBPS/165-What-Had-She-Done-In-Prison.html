  <h1>Chapter 165 What Had She Done In Prison? </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was absolutely unfathomable that an instant noodles fork could be used to dig out such a passage in the national maximum security prison for major criminals.</p>

    <p>Given that her spirit energy had been restricted, how had the girl broken that thick and heavy steel plate reinforced with immortal crystal in her cell...?</p>

    <p>That was the question.</p>

    <p>And after breaking the steel plate, how had she moved all the bricks, stone and soil...?</p>

    <p>That was yet another question.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi arrived soon after Secretary Dakang. When he stepped into the prison, he could clearly feel himself becoming dizzy. Seeing this, the prison warden who had been waiting to meet Zhuo Yi at the entrance promptly hung a pendant around his neck, which alleviated his dizziness significantly.</p>

    <p>"...What's this?"</p>

    <p>The warden explained, "Director Zhuo, this is the resistance crystal developed by Huaxiu nation's Cultivation Academy of Science; it curbs the effects of the magic array under the prison. Everyone working in the prison has one."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Zhuo Yi nodded his head.</p>

    <p>The magic array under the prison was so formidable; as soon as he had stepped into the prison, he almost couldn't breathe. His syndromes were similar to those for low blood sugar: chest pains, shortness of breath, increased heart palpitations and dizziness. Major criminals imprisoned here were not only subjected to this restraining magic array, but also had their strength restricted by special handcuffs.</p>

    <p>Looking at all these factors, it was utterly nonsensical for someone to be able to break out of here...</p>

    <p>"The incident this time was a little unexpected, but luckily it was discovered in time. The prisoners' handcuffs have built-in signal transmitters, and the signal shows that the escapee is still hiding in the prison..." The warden felt like crying; if the prisoner escaped successfully, his career as a warden would definitely be over, and he would probably be forced to retire and go home to become a farmer.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The warden straightaway led Zhuo Yi to the crime scene; by then, the major crime investigation unit of the Songhai cultivation police had already rushed over. They all stood around the passage opening which the girl had used to escape. At first glance, Zhuo Yi could already pick out Secretary Dakang dressed in a windcheater in the crowd.</p>

    <p>"Little Zhuozi, you're finally here!" Seeing Zhuo Yi, the old Secretary's worried frown instantly relaxed. "It was thanks to you that we were able to catch this person previously."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>"I more or less understand the basics of the situation, so if you have any questions you can just ask me. Or, if you have any other opinion, let me know. Everyone here is at your disposal! We must endeavor to capture this criminal and bring her to justice before she escapes the prison for good!" The old Secretary patted Zhuo Yi's shoulder. "Little Zhuozi, it's up to you! I believe that since you managed to catch her once, you can catch her a second time!"</p>

    <p>"..." Zhuo Yi already didn't know what to say.</p>

    <p>The main thing was that he himself was clueless about the last two times!</p>

    <p>"...How did she escape?"</p>

    <p>The old Secretary replied, "According to our preliminary findings, the criminal did indeed use an instant noodles fork to dig a passage and escape through it. Although it wasn't very wide, considering the criminal's identity as a Shadow Stream killer, she was proficient in the bone-shortening technique, so she could definitely have escaped through this small hole. As for the steel plate on the floor, the prisoner used some type of corrosive liquid which ate through it."</p>

    <p>Corrosive liquid?</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was flabbergasted. "Wasn't a thorough body check conducted before she entered prison... how did she bring it in?"</p>

    <p>Speaking about this, the warden rubbed his temple in pain. "If we're guessing correctly, the criminal likely hid it in her crotch, which is a blind spot during the check..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "...Cro...crotch?"</p>

    <p>The old Secretary nodded his head solemnly. "This assumption might sound ridiculous but it's actually quite logical. It's actually easy to hide something in the crotch area. Even a grenade could be hidden there, not to mention a small bottle of corrosive liquid."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It had been two hours since Jiang Liuying had broken out of prison. The world outside was tranquil and peaceful, but the situation inside Songhai city's maximum security prison had already exploded.</p>

    <p>No one could clearly say what would happen in two hours, but the later it got, the higher the chances were of the criminal escaping successfully.</p>

    <p>This was a major criminal who worked for the wicked assassination organization Shadow Stream; if they allowed such an infamous criminal to escape, they couldn't guarantee that she wouldn't take harmful action against the community.</p>

    <p>Three miles away from the main prison building, Jiang Liuying crawled out from under a pile of grass, still gripping the instant noodles fork in one hand and with her handcuffs still on. The fork had an "armor-penetrating" talisman on it which had made excavating the soil for Jiang Liuying as easy as digging into pudding.</p>

    <p>By the time she had broken through the soil, the armor-penetrating talisman had lost its effectiveness, and the instant it happened, the "dying" instant noodles fork in her hand had tragically snapped into two.</p>

    <p>Oh, by the way... she had also taken this armor-penetrating talisman out from her crotch.</p>

    <p>"It's all thanks to the escape service pack which elder sister prepared..." Jiang Liuying turned over a glass bottle the size of a finger in her hand; it was full of all types of all-purpose capsules that contained various magic treasures which could be used for escape.</p>

    <p>And all this time, it had been wedged in her crotch.</p>

    <p>Actually, she could have escaped earlier on, but it was unfortunate that she had directly been knocked out. By the time she had regained consciousness, she had found herself already in prison... although it had taken her some time, luckily she had been able to escape in the end.</p>

    <p>Lying prone inside the pile of grass, Jiang Liuying stared at the bottle in her hand. She then gritted her teeth resentfully and thumped the ground angrily; that damn bunch of cats and high school students caused this old mother so much grief... just you wait!</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuying narrowed her eyes, a hidden light in their depths.</p>

    <p>The priority now was to get out of here. She was acutely aware that although she had escaped from her cell, she still hadn't escaped the prison compound. Furthermore, she had a hunch that she was being monitored.</p>

    <p>"I have to get this damn handcuffs off..." After cooling down, the girl stared in deep thought at the handcuffs on her hands.</p>

    <p>These handcuffs were made from refined steel. This material was very special as it was able to suppress spirit energy. Along with the restraining magic array under the prison, the spirit energy she could use now was almost too little to mention... however, she had come up with another solution.</p>

    <p>From the glass bottle, she took out an all-purpose capsule which contained the last armor-penetrating talisman.</p>

    <p>Taking it out of the capsule, the girl stuck this armor-penetrating talisman on her 36D chest weapon as her final ray of hope.</p>

    <p>And then, she took a deep breath...</p>

    <p>The girl placed her hands on a rock and spread them as far apart as possible.</p>

    <p>After that, she lifted her upper body and suddenly flung herself down...</p>

    <p>Bang !</p>

    <p>Just like that, the handcuffs were smashed to smithereens by this weaponized chest...</p>
