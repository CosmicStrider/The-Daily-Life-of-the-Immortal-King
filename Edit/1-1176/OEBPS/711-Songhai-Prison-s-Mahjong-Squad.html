  <h1>Chapter 711 Songhai Prison's Mahjong Squad</h1>

  <div>

    <p>A lot of medical personnel carrying briefcases came down from the ambulances. There were fully sixty people. The vaccinations proceeded in a thorough and methodical way. These medical personnel also wore uniforms designated by Huaxiu Alliance, the Alliance logo printed on the white coats.</p>

    <p>It wasn't just the students, but everyone had to be vaccinated, including the team of experts who would be entering the remains as well as the teachers leading the students.</p>

    <p>This was because an accident had befallen an expert in Beast King's Remains previously. Although he came out of it alive in the end, he wasn't treated in time, and the toxin invaded his spine, directly paralyzing his lower half.</p>

    <p>Thus, an antibody vaccination had become a prerequisite for entering Devil Valley.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Not long after the ambulances showed up, Zhuo Yi, Director of the General Administration of 100 Schools in Songhai city, also arrived on the scene.</p>

    <p>Once he got out of the car, Zhuo Yi promptly approached a young man with a fresh crew cut next to the public square and held out his hand. "Thank you for your immense support this time, President Han Di! We don't have that much stock of the universal antibody vaccine in Songhai city. If it wasn't for your support, we really wouldn't know what to do this time."</p>

    <p>"I just want to support our country's research development! For the country to develop, we need to rely on this new generation. I look forward to their futures!" President Han Di wore a patriotic smile as he gazed at the thousand-plus students in the square.</p>

    <p>Finally, he fixed his eyes on Wang Ming. "I never expected such a young scholar to be part of our country's research team."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi smiled. "There are geniuses in each generation, who will dominate for centuries to come<sup>1</sup>."</p>

    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(From the poem "On Poetry" by Zhao Yi.)</dfn>

    <p>It wasn't appropriate for him to directly reveal Wang Ming's identity.</p>

    <p>This President Han Di was also very sensible and didn't continue asking about Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>Then President Han Di changed the subject. "Excuse me, Director Zhuo, is the entrance to the remains here?"</p>

    <p>"According to the fluctuations we're monitoring, the entrance to the remains will indeed open in this square. If President Han Di is interested, you can watch the opening of the entrance with us. It's supposed to be a spectacular sight. I've also never seen it myself."</p>

    <p>"May I?" asked President Han Di.</p>

    <p>"Of course." Zhuo Yi smiled.</p>

    <p>This smile made President Han Di frown somehow, as he felt that it was a little unreliable!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, at Huaxiu Alliance Building in Jinghua, headquarters of the Huaxiu Alliance of Cultivators.</p>

    <p>President Qi moved the cameras in Peiyuan district's public square and an image of Zhuo Yi and President Han Di chatting was directly displayed on the big screen.</p>

    <p>"2200, turn the volume up," President Qi instructed the staff member next to him.</p>

    <p>"Okay." In the office HQ, a technician in a pitch black uniform used space technology to directly extract just the voices of Zhuo Yi and President Han Di from the noisy environment.</p>

    <p>This technician with the work number 2200 had been specially transferred from Magnificent Immortal. The Magnificent Immortal Special Army Brigade was Huaxiu's finest special combat force, which had its own independent tech organization.</p>

    <p>The name of this organization was "Old Black," and this 2200 was a veteran who had been transferred from there.</p>

    <p>President Qi vaguely remembered that back when Old Black had just been set up, it hadn't had more than ten people. Later, it had come to Magnificent Immortal's attention and was incorporated into the brigade. Who would have thought that after so many years, Old Black would actually expand to thousands of people... Unfortunately, no one knew where that Old Black 001 from back then was now.</p>

    <p>Looking at this work number tag, President Qi felt an unexpected sense of loss.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi and President Han Di's dialog resounded directly in Huaxiu Alliance HQ.</p>

    <p>"Why do I feel that there's something strange about President Han Di?" General Yi frowned as he stayed afloat in the air with his hands behind his back.</p>

    <p>"The reason is very simple."</p>

    <p>President Qi chuckled. "This President Han Di isn't the actual person. The real President Han Di has already been replaced."</p>

    <p>"You already knew?" General Yi raised his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>"Of course." President Qi said, "If I can't see through even this little trick, I would really be unworthy of my title as Wisdom Saint. But I have to say, the other side's arrangement this time runs very deep. If our customs hadn't flagged the real President Han Di when he went through, I'm afraid that we would still have been in the dark. Moreover, I'm guessing that they may have already seen through our real and fake remains strategy, which is something we couldn't fully guard against. The other side will probably also send people to both the real and fake remains."</p>

    <p>General Yi nodded and sighed despite himself.</p>

    <p>In a situation where they couldn't be sure which was real and which was fake, sending two teams was the most conservative choice; at the very least, the other party wouldn't make a mistake in their target.</p>

    <p>One advantage of this was that the overall battle strength of this foreign force would be halved.</p>

    <p>But there was still a very big risk involved, and that was the foreign force might pose a threat to the students entering the remains...</p>

    <p>"We also initially prepared a similar scientific research group for the fake remains, but since the other side has dispatched two groups of people, we naturally have to send a fighting force to intercept those who try to enter the fake remains."</p>

    <p>"Then... who was sent?"</p>

    <p>General Yi was silent. He actually didn't know any of this!</p>

    <p>"Some of the Ten Generals have been given the important task of protecting the students, so my plan is to have General Bai take some men over to the fake remains to wipe them out."</p>

    <p>"So it's Explosion Saint..."</p>

    <p>"That's right. In any case, the remains are fake, so Explosion Saint can act freely - even if everything is destroyed, it won't hurt. In addition, I'm going to have Songhai First Prison let out those people in the special cell to coordinate with General Bai in battle."</p>

    <p>"My junior brother as well?"</p>

    <p>"Mm."</p>

    <p>President Qi nodded. "The head of state has already given his consent on this matter. This is a chance for them to atone for their crimes. Their codename is: Mahjong Squad."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>General Yi: "Then how are we going to handle the real President Han Di?"</p>

    <p>"This person has already been detained by customs, but I assume that after this person is released to Mixiu nation, Night Chief may make a big move, and the real President Han Di might very well be exterminated. I've thus already sent a man of ours to disguise himself as President Han Di on the run, and beat them at their own game."</p>

    <p>"Night Chief is a ruthless force. It's very risky sending someone over..."</p>

    <p>"Of course I know that, so the staff member we've dispatched in disguise this time isn't a person... but Head of State 001."</p>

    <p>"Head of State 001? Isn't 001 following the children?"</p>

    <p>"That was the original plan, but to counter every move, this is the best option right now."</p>

    <p>"You, Old Qi... Are you saying..."</p>

    <p>General Yi thought of the implications, which made his scalp turn numb.</p>

    <p>"You've guessed right. The Head of State 001 following Wang Ming around now is in fact the head of state himself."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
