  <h1>Chapter 820 A True Master</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Blademaster Yi Jianchuan was a general who had made his name before the nation's founding, when he and Minister Shi, the current Minister of the Ministry of National Defense, had together cut down seven demon gods during the Battle of Shimen.</p>

    <p>Just looking at him now as he hovered at some distance in the air, he still exuded a faint, imposing air.</p>

    <p>That was one of the Ten Generals!</p>

    <p>He wasn't emitting any spiritual pressure, but everyone subconsciously couldn't help but feel reverence well up.</p>

    <p>In that moment, the hearts of basically everyone present were beating fast. While there might currently be some unsatisfactory aspects of Huaxiu, the nation was constantly developing and advancing every day. The current era of peace and prosperity was built on the sacrifices of the previous cultivation martyrs!</p>

    <p>Immortal doctors who saved the dying, sailors who sailed against the tide, police who defended the city, the sentries on the border... The instant General Yi appeared, one after another, all these people flashed before the audience's eyes.</p>

    <p>"General Yi usually keeps a low profile. Why this time..." Lu Youming asked telepathically.</p>

    <p>"As Sect Leader Lu may have considered, attending this event is completely giving the chief face. Being low-key is something that is reflected in all aspects, and comes from the heart. In the end, General Yi is General Yi - even if we were to temper ourselves for a hundred years, we would have no hope of matching the General's bearing."</p>

    <p>Professor Yang smiled slightly and replied, "Does Sect Leader Lu still remember General Yi's famous saying?"</p>

    <p>Lu Youming frowned and thought for a moment. "Your sword, is my sword?"</p>

    <p>"General Yi did indeed say that," Professor Yang said. "That saying is from General Yi's book <em>The Chronicles of Boundless Sword Dao </em>, which describes his difficult experiences in learning Boundless Sword Dao as he urges younger generations of cultivators to bear the hardships of the path of cultivation and to be more patient. However, this is not the saying I'm referring to."</p>

    <p>"Then..."</p>

    <p>"General Yi also said something else." Professor Yang said, "'A true master always has the heart of an apprentice.'"</p>

    <p>Lu Youming's eyes widened as realization instantly dawned on him.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The Office of Strategic Deception's founding ceremony would be a day that all the sect leaders and reporters who were present would probably never forget.</p>

    <p>Beyond anyone's expectations, the other Ten Generals of Huaxiu nation followed General Yi and appeared one after another!</p>

    <p>The ten of them, were all here!</p>

    <p>Some of the Sky-level sect leaders were so shocked that they almost fell flat on their asses - this was too ridiculous and unbelievable!</p>

    <p>"The Ten Generals... are all here?? Big news!!"</p>

    <p>The reporters were very excited.</p>

    <p>The cameras didn't stop flashing for a very long time in the northern square.</p>

    <p>And not long after the Ten Generals' appearance, the lift in the center of the stage rose once more.</p>

    <p>"Now let us welcome Lord Diulei, Chief of the General Office of Strategic Deception, with a warm round of applause!"</p>

    <p>Accompanied by Lao Gudong's deep and magnetic voice, a man with long black hair and dressed in white traditional attire with a long sword on his back officially stepped onto the stage.</p>

    <p>Next to him, at the same time, was Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch, who had demonstrated his extraordinary strength in the arena earlier, and a mysterious man dressed all in armor.</p>

    <p>"Who is this armored warrior?" Some of the sect leaders were very puzzled.</p>

    <p>But very quickly, someone speculated, "This man, could he be the legendary Ling Zhenren..."</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren?"</p>

    <p>"Think about it, who is it that Great Death-Courting Senior is said to be the closest to and has the best relationship with all these years? Isn't it this Ling Zhenren?!"</p>

    <p>Everyone nodded.</p>

    <p>That did seem to make sense...</p>

    <p>"At this very moment, at such a grand celebration of the sect's founding, all the department leaders of the Office of Strategic Deception are standing in the front row; none of them are qualified to step forward and stand on stage with Senior Immortal. This is even more proof that this Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch and Ling Zhenren have an unusual relationship with Lord Diulei."</p>

    <p>Under the stage, a bigwig was analyzing the situation intensely. "The story all these years is that Ling Zhenren helped Lord Diulei handle a lot of problems. In my view, this may be a misunderstanding... Perhaps Ling Zhenren is only his advisor, and the person who truly takes action is Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch!"</p>

    <p>"I see..."</p>

    <p>For a moment, there was a racket of voices In the northern square as the crowd of sect leaders discussed and whispered among themselves.</p>

    <p>At that moment, the Ten Generals had already touched down, and they all stepped forward on stage to congratulate Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>"Brother Thunder! Congratulations!"</p>

    <p>"Brother Thunder! Congrats, congrats!"</p>

    <p>"Brother Thunder! Congratulations on your opening! May it be an auspicious founding!"</p>

    <p>The Ten Generals had barely spoken when the northern square instantly turned quiet...</p>

    <p>"What are you saying, Brother Yi? Sis Luo is also being too polite... Everyone, please stand behind me first!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Brother... Brother Yi?</p>

    <p>And, Sis Luo?</p>

    <p>Some of the sect heads almost spat blood.</p>

    <p>How close was this relationship?!!</p>

    <p>No wonder all the Ten Generals showed up!</p>

    <p>If they had known, they would have formed a good relationship with the cultivation forum early on! This was enough to make anyone faint!</p>

    <p>Seeing that all the leaders had arrived, Wang Han opened his mouth. "Next, we invite the chief to say a few words!"</p>

    <p><em>Clap clap clap...</em></p>

    <p>The thunderous applause in the northern square lasted for a long time.</p>

    <p>"Thank you... Distinguished guests, sect leaders, representatives, and members of the media, thank you very much for participating in our sect's founding ceremony. Today, this northern square of ours is truly alive with the clamor of drums and gongs and the crackle of firecrackers, with the red flags fluttering in the wind, and a sea of people!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei spoke with passion and excitement. "Our General Office of Strategic Deception holds fast to the philosophy that all roads lead to the same destination, and was founded to help cultivators realize their dreams as well as to uphold peace and mediate conflict between sects."</p>

    <p>At the same time, his speech was being broadcasted live by some live streamers online. In Daoist Guang's live stream room alone, for example, more than fifty million people had already gathered...</p>

    <p>After becoming a web celebrity, Daoist Guang's number of fans had been growing at an uncontrollable rate.</p>

    <p>Oh, right, Daoist Guang was now also the team leader of the Office of Strategic Deception's live streaming team!</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, Wang Zhen, whom Immortal Toya had set up for the time being at Wei Zhi's place, was eating instant noodles with Wei Zhi while they watched the live broadcast online.</p>

    <p>After Lord Diulei spoke, someone quizzed him, "On such a grand day, would it be possible for Senior Immortal to have this brother in armor next to you remove his helmet for the audience?"</p>

    <p>"Of course."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei swiftly replied, "Let me introduce you properly. This brother in armor isn't just anyone. He is my dear brother, Ling Zhenren! Brother Ling! Please take off your helmet!"</p>

    <p>At that point, Wang Ling manipulated this clone of his into slowly taking off the helmet...</p>

    <p>Everyone, including the Ten Generals, turned their gazes to this mysterious Ling Zhenren, hungry for a look at his face.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Wang Zhen, who was watching TV with Wei Zhi, directly spat out a big mouthful of lao tan pickled cabbage beef noodles...</p>

    <p>WTF!! This guy, actually copied his face!!!</p>

    <p>There was no end to the shocks for Wang Zhen.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Lord Diulei waved his hand and drew out a large loudspeaker. Lifting it with both hands, he shouted loudly, "I declare! That today! The General Office! Of Strategic Deception! Is officially! Open!"</p>
