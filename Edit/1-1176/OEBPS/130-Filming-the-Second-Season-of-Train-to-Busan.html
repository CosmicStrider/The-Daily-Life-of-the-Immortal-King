  <h1>Chapter 130 Filming the Second Season of Train to Busan?! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was doomed to be a troubling day. Early in the morning, Song Qingshu received a message from Ding Yunsong.</p>

    <p>To sum up the content of the message, the implication was thus: the incident had become a huge issue which had drawn the attention of state leaders and big names from various circles in the cultivation world, and it couldn't be suppressed at all by purely relying on a mayor's power.</p>

    <p>Upon seeing this message, Song Qingshu's eyelids twitched... why was he running into all these big shots whom he couldn't afford to provoke lately? First it was that mysterious youngster who had shown up at Lord Diulei's villa, and now for some reason it was the web novelist guru Wang Situ...</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu didn't think he had ever felt more sullen in his life.</p>

    <p>While he was feeling depressed, his wristwatch rang.</p>

    <p>"Brother Song, this is Zhou Jie. I saw that the situation on Weibo had clearly settled, but why has it picked up again? It hasn't even been two hours. Did something happen?" There was an obvious note of urgency in Zhou Jie's voice.</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu rubbed the skin between his eyebrows with some annoyance. "I can't do anything about this matter; that Wang Situ's background is a little beyond my expectations. Even our Mo Immortal Castle can't deal with him."</p>

    <p>"How can that be..." Zhou Jie was dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>After a moment of silence, Song Qingshu said, "My advice now is that you quickly make arrangements for your younger cousin to go abroad and escape the limelight. It would be best if he didn't return for at least half a year."</p>

    <p>"Is the situation that serious?"</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu sighed. "Judge for yourself. What I can tell you is that this incident has already moved the almighty ten founding generals of Huaxiu nation."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Zhou Jie was dumbstruck with fear. What kind of influential background did this person have, that he could reach out to the ten founding generals?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was six o'clock in the morning on May 27th.</p>

    <p>Songhai city's Dahuang International Airport.</p>

    <p>A man with a mohawk, wearing a black face mask and carrying a black briefcase, cowered as he reached the departure lounge at the airport.</p>

    <p>He whispered into his phone, "Hello... brother, I've reached the airport."</p>

    <p>Over the line came Zhou Jie's voice. "Zhou Wei, I've already arranged everything for you; I bought a ticket for the earliest flight, which leaves at six twenty. Go directly through the green passage <sup>1</sup> ten minutes before that... ignore whoever talks to you, got it? Board the plane first!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The 'green passage' in Chinese
airports allow for quick
check-ins or custom checks
when time-sensitive items are
involved, such as donated
organs or fresh produce.)</dfn>

    <p>"Okay, brother, I got it..."</p>

    <p>Zhou Wei's face was sweating as he hung up the phone, and there was deep regret in his heart. He really wanted to cut off his hand! Why couldn't he have controlled himself back then?!</p>

    <p>Instinctively he turned his head, and realized that a black cat had poked its head out from under a row of chairs at the back of the departure lounge to survey him.</p>

    <p>So it was a cat...</p>

    <p>He heaved a sigh.</p>

    <p>It wasn't strange to see pets in the airport these days; a lot of them were soul pets that possessed spiritual intelligence. As long as their owners purchased tickets for them, they could get on the plane by themselves. There were even soul pets no less intelligent than human beings that were capable of buying their own tickets to travel abroad.</p>

    <p>Zhou Wei felt that this average-looking black cat was probably someone's pet, and that it was waiting for its owner under the chair.</p>

    <p>However, he still felt a little weird being stared at by a cat. He immediately stood up and switched to a seat where he wouldn't be able to see the black cat.</p>

    <p>As soon as he left, the black cat under the chair reached up to unfold its ears, which had actually been hiding a pair of wireless earphones...</p>

    <p>The black cat kept its cool and said in a low voice, "Attention, battalion commanders! The target has been sighted! Monk, what is your situation?"</p>

    <p>The Monk: "Reporting to the Regiment Commander! Everything is proceeding smoothly!"</p>

    <p>Zheng Tan nodded. "Good. All other units continue to tail the target! Monk, hurry and bring people in, we must stop this person before he boards the plane!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Zhou Wei didn't know if he was feeling too sensitive after doing something bad; there were clearly only ten more minutes to go before he could pass through the green passage and board first, but at the moment, he felt like he was sitting on pins and needles at the back of the waiting room.</p>

    <p>At six o'clock, there were only a few scattered guests in the departure lounge. Zhou Jie had deliberately arranged for Zhou Wei to wait in the VIP lounge where there were fewer people. However, Zhou Wei still felt like there were numerous eyes on him for some reason.</p>

    <p>Out of the corner of his eye, he saw an airport ground service employee cleaning with a quiet vacuum cleaner a dozen or so meters away... this person seemed to be staring at him?!</p>

    <p>Using a magazine to cover his face, he took a covert look.</p>

    <p>It was an old lady, far advanced in years.</p>

    <p>He shrunk back into his clothes. He was a muscular man over one hundred and eighty centimeters tall, but for the first time, he felt a lingering coldness in his heart.</p>

    <p>It was just an old lady who was quite a distance away and dim-sighted with age... she probably hadn't recognized him, right?</p>

    <p>Zhou Wei felt very nervous.</p>

    <p>In the end, after struggling in his chair for a long while, he decided to change seats again and put more distance between him and this ground service old lady...</p>

    <p>As soon as he left, the old woman crouched down behind the vacuum cleaner and stealthily took out a walkie-talkie. "Attention, all units! The target is on the move! This is a rare and huge case which the masses have reported to our General Administration of Harmony, so look lively! Old Zhang, what is your situation?"</p>

    <p>Master Zhang: "Reporting to Miss Dong! All is well!"</p>

    <p>Madam Dong nodded. "Good! Everyone else continue to tail him! The target is going to register to board in five minutes! We must stop him before he makes any further move!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Time passed minute by minute, but for Zhou Wei, every second felt as long as a year.</p>

    <p>Finally, it was time to board.</p>

    <p>Black briefcase in hand and racing against time, he rushed for the green passage almost at once!</p>

    <p>He didn't want to stay here even an instant longer!</p>

    <p>At the entrance to the green passage, a beautiful little sister with brown hair and long legs stopped him. "This gentleman, the green passage is now open. Please show me your boarding pass and passport!"</p>

    <p>He hurriedly took them out of his pocket and handed them to the little sister, his eyes flicking around nervously the whole time.</p>

    <p>"Hello, Mr Tom Zhou, welcome aboard. Have a nice trip..."</p>

    <p>Scarcely had the little sister put the boarding pass and passport back in Zhou Wei's hand when two large troops instantly emerged from behind. One was a bunch of old men and women wearing glasses and red ribbons around their arms; the old lady leading them turned out to be the ground service employee who had been pushing the vacuum cleaner around earlier!</p>

    <p>Even more frightening was that next to this elderly group were several dozen cats... at the very front was a black cat which had its arms crossed and which was standing on two legs, its gaze fixed on Zhou Wei! And behind these cats stood a fat police officer.</p>

    <p>Zhou Wei immediately broke out in a cold sweat... it turned out that he had already been watched from the very beginning!</p>

    <p>"Seize this groping bastard!" Madam Dong shouted loudly as she pointed at him.</p>

    <p>In an instant, a large bunch of meowing cats and a large bunch of old men and women pounced on Zhou Wei at the same time...</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Behind them, the little sister standing at the entrance to the green passage had black lines on her face <sup>2</sup> ... were they filming the second season of <em>Train toBusan </em><sup>3 </sup>?!!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(In Japanese comics and
cartoons, black horizontal
lines on a character's head or
face can denote various
negative emotions such as
shock or depression.)</dfn>
