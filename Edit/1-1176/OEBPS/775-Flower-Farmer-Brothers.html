  <h1>Chapter 775 Flower Farmer Brothers</h1>

  <div>

      <p>Dao Master Wang's appearance wasn't an accident. The truth was that when the girl in the kun's belly had first appeared, Wang Ling had already had a hunch that someone was looking for him, and that this person's strength wasn't ordinary; at least, of all the people Wang Ling had ever come across so far, he had never met this sort of person.</p>

      <p>Sitting on the throne in Night Chief's general HQ, Dao Master Wang only had to give President Bai a brief look to know what he was thinking.</p>

      <p>President Bai didn't expect Dao Master Wang's next words to directly shatter his overall plan for revenge.</p>

      <p>"You want revenge, I want to catch the thief ... It is more than good enough to accomplish these, there is no need to involve anyone else," Dao Master Wang said.</p>

      <p>Using the excuse of carrying out inspections, he had come down from Nine-fold Star to the mortal world time and again to look for that thief who had stolen a number of his Heavenly Dao. Every move he made had to be done in secret, and it was for this reason that he had developed his top chess piece in the mortal world: President Bai.</p>

      <p>He had to keep this chess piece under control; it would be bad if it went overboard and broke away from the chessboard, and cause the people on Nine-fold Star to accuse him of misconduct.</p>

      <p>Wang Zhen considered himself a cautious man.</p>

      <p>Faced with this formidable Dao Master Wang, President Bai was angry, but didn't dare speak out.</p>

      <p>After all, there was a huge gap in strength.</p>

      <p>Wang Zhen saw that Bai Zhe was unconvinced in his heart, so he gave Bai Zhe a sidelong glance and said lightly, "If you want to inherit the full power of Outer Dao, your mind must be clear of all distractions, otherwise you won't be able to combine the six Great Outer Dao together, and the first person to suffer will be you. It's for your own good."</p>

      <p>President Bai was blank since he didn't feel that being free of distracting thoughts had anything to do with comprehending Outer Dao.</p>

      <p>Of the two of them, one wanted revenge while the other wanted to catch the thief ... ultimately, they were both distractions!</p>

      <p>Bai Zhe wasn't a fool, and could tell that Dao Master Wang had misgivings.</p>

      <p>Nine-fold Star was known as the domain of the gods ...</p>

      <p>It definitely had to be inconvenient for Dao Master Wang to descend to the mortal world in order to capture the thief, which was why Bai Zhe had come to his attention.</p>

      <p>Hence, after pondering for only a short while, Bai Zhe quickly acquiesced. "What Dao Master Wang said has merit, this junior will remember it."</p>

      <p>Before drawing on Dao Master Wang's power to obtain the genuine and consummate power of Outer Dao, Bai Zhe could endure it for a while. With Dao Master Wang backing him, his revenge was only a matter of time.</p>

      <p>"As long as you listen to me, you absolutely won't regret it."</p>

      <p>When Bai Zhe lifted his head again, he heard Dao Master Wang Zhen's light voice. It sounded very ethereal, as if it was coming from everywhere around Bai Zhe all at once.</p>

      <p>"You're not weak when it comes to talent, but even then, you will never be able to touch the domain of the gods in your entire lifetime. Taking a gamble and amassing the six Great Outer Dao is thus the only way. But you must remember that you have to be patient and not the least bit rowdy. I've seen too many youngsters like you who were initially promising geniuses, but were too anxious to get things done, and in the end ran into setbacks. Whether it is Heavenly Dao or Outer Dao, we need to view these nomological powers with reverence."</p>

      <p>Wang Zhen explained the main reason to Bai Zhe very patiently. He could see that Bai Zhe was a very impatient person. If he didn't explain it clearly to him now, it was more than likely that some unexpected mishap would happen in the future.</p>

      <p>Bai Zhe was silent.</p>

      <p>He wasn't a person who liked to listen to reason, but under Dao Master Wang's systematic and patient guidance, it seemed that he had calmed down quite a bit, which was very strange.</p>

      <p>Actually, this was because when Wang Zhen had started to speak earlier, he had cast the "Great Calming Spell."</p>

      <p>This technique could force a person's mood to revert back to normal. No matter how distressed, angry, or aroused you were ... the moment this spell was cast, you would calm down. Even if you had taken Viagra, you would ultimately become limp.</p>

      <p>"Then, does Dao Master Wang have a plan after this?"</p>

      <p>Bai Zhe raised his head to look very respectfully at Wang Zhen.</p>

      <p>"Of course."</p>

      <p>Wang Zhen nodded. "There is a limit to how long I can come down here to carry out an inspection, but when I'm on Nine-fold Star, I never stop investigating and searching. Recently, I was inspired by new cooks hired by my family."</p>

      <p>"Cook?"</p>

      <p>"That's right, these two new cooks are brothers called Flower Farmer Brothers<sup>1</sup>. They used to farm in the outskirts on Nine-fold Star, and are famous for raising spirit rats. Furthermore, they came up with different excuses for eating the spirit rats, who might have been fighting, or were fat, depressed, beautiful or rutting. They stewed the rats, fried them, boiled them ... they cooked them in all kinds of twisted ways."</p>
      
      <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Derived from the popular live streaming duo "Chinese Farmer Brothers" who raise bamboo rats for food.)</dfn>

      <p>"All ... kinds of twisted ways?"</p>

      <p>"It was this point that caught my attention, and I spent a lot of money to hire them. I also invested a huge sum into helping them publish a book called 100 Million Ways to Cook Spirit Rats. If you're interested, I can bring this book to show you later. Whether it's in the world below or above, nutritious food is the trend, so there's no harm in learning some cooking skills, and it's actually useful ... "</p>

      <p>Bai Zhe: " ... "</p>

      <p>"Oh, my apologies, I've digressed."</p>

      <p>Speaking up to this point, Dao Master Wang seemed to feel that he had strayed from the main topic, and hastily came back to it. "It was only when I hired these two brothers that I learned that their ancestors used to raise vicious beasts. Unfortunately, the family later fell on hard times and was unable to bear the massive costs of breeding vicious beasts. And so, they sold their farm and then raised spirit rats as the next best thing. After I found out, I took over a vicious beast farm and gave it to them."</p>

      <p>"What are they raising?"</p>

      <p>"Kun."</p>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p>"In line with the brothers raising kun, I specially gave this fishery the name Golden Kun Farm, and I hired an experienced farm manager with the nickname Full Metal Shell Case<sup>2</sup>.</p>
      
      <dfn><sup>2</sup>(The pseudonym of an author who writes farming novels..)</dfn>

      <p>Bai Zhe was startled as he felt the name was somehow a little familiar!</p>

      <p>"After that, my venerable self took advantage of these two brothers' breeding techniques and started a business selling kun. And the results have been pretty good! We had a net profit of over ten billion in the first quarter!"</p>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p>"Of course, we encountered some mishaps in raising kun. In the beginning, the more unruly breeds would fight each other during the mating season. But things improved after the Flower Farm Brothers intervened, and like the spirit rats previously, all the kun that fought were eaten."</p>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p>"Also, in breeding the kun, there were some that came out ugly or with bad skin. My venerable self used these ones to explore space. I released a number of them in the demon world and the human world to investigate that thief's whereabouts. My efforts weren't in vain; after dozens of attempts, I finally obtained new results!"</p>
