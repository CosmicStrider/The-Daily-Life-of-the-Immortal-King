  <h1>Chapter 296 You Are My... </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Lying on the ground, the silver warhorse stared blankly at the student ID and didn't know what expression to use in front of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>From the ID, it could confirm two things. First of all, the cover was made of leather... and secondly, this human cultivator in front of it was a genuine high school student. There was a metal stamp on the ID which contained traces of magic, so the warhorse was sure of it.</p>

    <p>A high school student...</p>

    <p>The silver horse's hair stood on end. Were all high school students nowadays this formidable? What were they feeding them...</p>

    <p>Staring at the silver horse, Wang Ling stretched out one hand and rested it on its body, and the horse twitched involuntarily. It tried to get up, but found it hard in its current state.</p>

    <p>"You... what are you doing?" The silver horse's expression was full of terror.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling didn't hurt it further; he just felt around for the core array pattern which covered its body, then used magic to pull it out and straightaway tear it apart.</p>

    <p>The silver horse was dumbfounded once again; this was its first time actually seeing this type of operation. This was a fucking core array pattern! It could be considered a phantom thing, and contained a highly dense amount of spirit energy; pulling it out with your bare hands was like sticking a wet finger into an electric socket.</p>

    <p>This human wasn't just frightening; the way he did things was also very rough.</p>

    <p>This was the silver horse's second impression of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"What should we do with them?" Dharmaraja's gaze swept over their surroundings as he realized that there were still a lot of things which needed to be sorted out: there were the female disciples who had been knocked out by the spiritual pressure earlier, plus the shifu and disciple who had been knocked unconscious after they had been thrown out of the intrinsic spirit field.</p>

    <p>In the instant that the female elder had been flung out, she had still wanted to protect her silly disciple, and had been heavily injured. Blood trickled from the corners of her mouth and her nose; it was likely that her primordial spirit had sustained some sort of hurt.</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja and Luo Chuang blushed for this Itinerant Immortal who had been affected so badly just from being thrown out of the intrinsic spirit field. But if they hadn't had Ling Zhenren's protective golden light around them, it was likely that they would also have been severely wounded.</p>

    <p>"Tie them up first," said Luo Chuang. "I brought plenty of rope."</p>

    <p>"No... I think the first thing you should do is take off those women's clothes." Lord Diulei gazed at them and his lips twitched. When he had watched Wang Ling pull apart the core array pattern, he had already been itching to comment on it; these two were just too painful to look at in women's clothes.</p>

    <p>" Ai , it was a rare opportunity..."</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja looked a little reluctant when he took the women's clothes off.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The situation on the top of Yuntai Pavilion had settled for the time being, but things weren't over yet. The core array pattern on the silver warhorse's body had only been one part of the Ice Crystal Array; severing it wasn't enough to completely stop the array, but it could prevent the array guardian spirits from reforming in an incessant flow of attacks.</p>

    <p>"You've already won. With such power, there is no need for you to be afraid of the Master of Immortal Mansion at all." The silver warhorse lay weakly on the ground and struggled to breathe as it lifted its gaze. Wang Ling drew closer, and realized that the silver horse actually had eyelashes.</p>

    <p>Previously, he had heard that slit-eyed female cultivator call it Senior Uncle Feifei... but wasn't this a mare?</p>

    <p>"I found traces in the palace of the Master of Immortal Mansion using a magic array for summoning familiars. How can he possibly lose so easily, if he has the support of familiars behind him?" asked Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>"This person is pretty suspicious. He used a regeneration magic array created by a familiar to construct this large Immortal Mansion building complex. He then used a magic incantation to control the familiar and have it kill itself... I saw this with my own eyes, so I'm sure of it," the silver warhorse slowly explained without hesitation.</p>

    <p>"What kind of operation is this..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was startled when he heard this, then he suddenly realized something and asked, "You're a holy beast with Immortal Mansion, why are you telling us this classified information?"</p>

    <p>The silver horse didn't say anything, then looked weakly at Wang Ling. "Even if I don't say it, you can probably guess why, right?"</p>

    <p>"Mm... true enough." Lord Diulei nodded his head.</p>

    <p>The silver horse sighed. "Right now, I'm so weak I can't even stand up. A technique like the memory retrieval spell is like using modern X-ray technology, and is in fact quite harmful to the brain. If you keep using that on me, I might not even know how to ride a bicycle anymore."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>After saying this, the silver horse looked a little hesitant before it said, "Furthermore, I'm really not one of Immortal Mansion's people."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>

    <p>"Our silver unicorn clan used to be a glorious clan among the holy beasts. But over the years, too many of our clansmen died when mankind hunted us for our beast hearts. I am the only one who survived that disaster." It laughed bitterly. "I utterly despise humans... join and serve them? The only reason I'm doing this is all for revenge."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei understood a little better now. This could be considered an utterly simple and blunt reason: while it might sound like they were working together, the silver horse was actually borrowing Immortal Mansion's strength to take revenge on society.</p>

    <p>But though this silver unicorn utterly despised humans, there was one person who was different, and that was the slit-eyed female cultivator lying unconscious next to the female elder in purple.</p>

    <p>The silver unicorn looked at where the slit-eyed female cultivator lay on the ground, and it suddenly turned to Wang Ling with a pleading expression. "Please don't hurt her. I was the one who brought this girl to Immortal Mansion, and this was part of my arrangement with the master."</p>

    <p>"An arrangement?" Lord Diulei rubbed his jaw.</p>

    <p>The silver unicorn said, "This girl helped me out a lot, and also suffered for it. She didn't used to be stupid. Unfortunately, poison damaged her brain. The Master of Immortal Mansion happened to have something to suppress the poison inside her body."</p>

    <p>"What kind of poison is it?"</p>

    <p>"This poison is a little complicated, so it would take me a while to explain it clearly. Using my holy beast blood as a trigger, she has to take the root of the tropical sundew once every three days to keep the effects of the poison at bay." The silver horse became agitated as it said this, and coughed up another mouthful of blood.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei looked at the blood-stained ground with some regret... all this poured out on the ground was "gold."</p>

    <p>In addition, when he heard the silver unicorn mention the root of the tropical sundew, he was stunned, as this was a rare drug ingredient that was already on the verge of becoming extinct.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, is there a way to get rid of the poison inside her?" Thinking for a while, Lord Diulei abruptly turned to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"You can neutralize it?" On the ground, the silver unicorn had a disbelieving expression on its face.</p>

    <p>Then, it saw Wang Ling walking toward the girl, a white light glowing in his right hand.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stretched out his hand and placed it on her head. As he activated the Great Purification Spell, wisps of black smoke drifted out of her ears.</p>

    <p>The entire thing took less than a minute.</p>

    <p>The corner of the silver unicorn's mouth twitched. "This... is it done?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei nodded earnestly. "Yes, it's gone."</p>

    <p>The silver unicorn sucked in a sharp breath and stared at Wang Ling in reverence. Although it was still weak, it thought Wang Ling had been too cool just now, and it yelled in excitement, "MASTER! You are my MASTER!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
