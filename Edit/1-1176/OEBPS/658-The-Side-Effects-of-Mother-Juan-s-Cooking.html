  <h1>Chapter 658 The Side Effects of Mother Juan's Cooking</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This time, Mother Juan had prepared ten dishes in all. She duped Elder Ji Xing into finishing the ninth dish, and his reaction was to faceplant into the ninth empty plate.</p>

    <p>For some reason, Mother Juan's conscience was pricked.</p>

    <p>There was still the last dish to be tasted.</p>

    <p>These weren't regular croquette balls, but in a real sense was a new dish she had recently created since no one had tasted version 1.0 of it before. The croquette's ingredient was a type of spirit silkworm chrysalis which had to have formed for not longer than half a month, to guarantee that the ingredient was fresh!</p>

    <p>The exact cooking method was very simple â€” wash the selected spirit silkworm chrysalises and slice them. Mix them with dragon pork and crispy spirit chicken bones in the right proportions. Add fresh eggs and cornflour, and roll them into balls. After adding the seasoning, the final step was to deep fry them on high heat.</p>

    <p>The crispiness of the bones and the robustness of the dragon pork made the meatballs very chewy, and when they were deep fried on high heat, the sliced spirit silkworm chrysalis would melt like a cheesy yolk... with one bite, the liquid would explode in the mouth!</p>

    <p>Mother Juan felt that this was a particularly ingenious method, but after making these croquettes the last time, she had just put them in the fridge and had planned to find someone to try them the next day.</p>

    <p>The end result was that the rest of the fresh food in the fridge had gone bad by the second day...</p>

    <p>Thus, Mother Juan had never taken these croquettes out to be tasted before.</p>

    <p>But she gave it a very pleasant-sounding name: crispy chrysalis balls.</p>

    <p>Now, after Mother Juan had personally improved them, version 2.0 was out.</p>

    <p>The crispy chrysalis balls now wouldn't make the food around them rot or go bad. But after this female parent had finished eating nine of her dishes one after another, and had lost her memory after each one, Mother Juan found it really hard to imagine what type of adverse reaction she might have after eating this final croquette dish.</p>

    <p>Mother Juan felt a little guilty!</p>

    <p>After all, she hadn't tested these crispy chrysalis balls before; wouldn't it be too late if it reacted badly with any of the other dishes the parent had already eaten? To prevent this from happening, Mother Juan almost involuntarily decided to put away the last dish before this female parent regained consciousness.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, she was a little too late.</p>

    <p>Just as she was about to take the plate away, the female parent suddenly stretched out a hand to tightly grip her wrist.</p>

    <p>Then, Mother Juan saw this parent lift her head with a bewitched expression on her face as she stared at Mother Juan and muttered, "The food tasting event... has now started..."</p>

    <p>Mother Juan was alarmed. "..." Bloody hell! This parent's brain was broken from all the bad food she'd eaten!</p>

    <p>Moreover, this parent was a little too strong! She gripped Mother Juan's wrist tightly and refused to let go!</p>

    <p>No wonder this parent was fine after eating so many of the dishes.</p>

    <p>Her realm wasn't low to begin with!</p>

    <p>Mother Juan already had her own speculation.</p>

    <p>But in that moment, she felt at a bit of a loss. Because if this was the case, this food tasting was essentially meaningless. If this parent's realm was very high, she might have been relying purely on the attributes of her own body to resist the side effects in these trial dishes. So these dishes couldn't be given to regular Foundation Establishment students!</p>

    <p>Mother Juan abruptly sighed at that moment; it seemed that she still had a long way to go in her food research!</p>

    <p>Seeing this female parent stare stubbornly at the tenth dish with the expression of one already too far gone, Mother Juan let out a deep sigh. "Parent, please calm down. The food tasting is already over. Look, the other parents have already left..."</p>

    <p>Dazed, Elder Ji Xing looked around as his mind cleared a little.</p>

    <p>He looked at the nine empty plates next to him and the nine pairs of chopsticks...</p>

    <p>So, there had been several other parents who had participated in the food tasting?</p>

    <p>He shook his head and then rubbed his temples. He was really so muddle-headed! He couldn't remember even that!</p>

    <p>Learning to disguise yourself was a requirement for ninjas!</p>

    <p>As a cultivator returning overseas from Sun Island, Elder Ji Xing felt a little ashamed at the moment.</p>

    <p>He had actually made such a low-level mistake while sneaking into enemy territory!</p>

    <p>"My apologies..." He let go of Mother Juan's wrist. "I'm a little dazed right now."</p>

    <p>But actually, Elder Ji Xing felt a little suspicious in his heart; for some reason, he felt like he had forgotten something!</p>

    <p>"It's fine, parent."</p>

    <p>Mother Juan looked at this female parent amiably, and only thought of encouraging the other party to leave as soon as possible. "This tenth dish is a giveaway. I'll pack it up for you to take back. The other parents already took some back with them."</p>

    <p>"Is that so... alright..." To prevent his identity from being exposed, Elder Ji Xing could only follow Mother Juan's words and agree.</p>

    <p>But the truth was that even Mother Juan herself was feeling extremely nervous in that moment; she was worried that this female parent would notice something.</p>

    <p>But actually, she was thinking too much.</p>

    <p>She had underestimated the amnesia side effect produced by the first nine dishes...</p>

    <p>And the reason why she wanted the female parent to take the croquettes with her was actually to stall for time.</p>

    <p>Mother Juan felt that given this female parent's outstanding realm, the latter would be able to finish digesting all the dishes she had eaten on her way home.</p>

    <p>That way, Mother Juan didn't have to worry about the kind of side effects which could be produced by the crispy chrysalis balls.</p>

    <p>Hence, ten minutes later...</p>

    <p>At Number 60 High School's main gate on Qingyun Road, Old Li and Mother Juan stood at the gate and saw a confused Elder Ji Xing off with warm expressions.</p>

    <p>Mother Juan: "This female parent, take care! Thank you very much for making time in your busy schedule to attend my food tasting event! Feel free to come again!"</p>

    <p>Elder Ji Xing: "..."</p>

    <p>It could only be said that this had been a very fuzzy and confusing experience for Elder Ji Xing.</p>

    <p>He felt that from the moment he had stepped into the school, he had forgotten something. Plus, his original intention had been to scout out the school! Instead, the school's kitchen lady and guard had led him around by the nose before very politely sending him off at the gate... Elder Ji Xing really didn't know what kind of expression he should be wearing at the moment.</p>

    <p>In his absent-minded state, it seemed he could now better understand the Lord of Mo Immortal Castle's repeated warnings previously: Don't approach Number 60 High! Don't approach Number 60 High! Don't approach Number 60 High!</p>

    <p>After careful consideration, Elder Ji Xing felt that there really was something fishy about this school.</p>

    <p>He looked helplessly at the takeaway box in his hand and heaved a deep sigh in his heart.</p>

    <p>He never expected these croquettes to actually be the only thing he gained from this trip.</p>
