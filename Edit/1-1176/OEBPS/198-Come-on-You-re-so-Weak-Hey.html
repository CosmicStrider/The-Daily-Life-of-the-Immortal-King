  <h1>Chapter 198 Come on, You're so Weak, Hey </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Exactly how strong was the seven-layer godly thunder? Wang Ling roughly felt that it would definitely be able to paralyze a Soul Formation cultivator. Of course, that was if the cultivator was completely unprepared for it.</p>

    <p>Under normal circumstances, absolutely no one would voluntarily take a blow infused with the godly thunder inheritance from Dharmaraja — that was also the reason why he had never witnessed the full extent of the power of the godly thunder inheritance.</p>

    <p>The electric shock actually gave Wang Ling a comfortable feeling. He had had his Sage Body for many years, and so he couldn't feel much when his external acupuncture points were kneaded. However, when this godly thunder inheritance flowed through his body and stimulated his acupuncture points, it was a very intimate and snug feeling!</p>

    <p>On the side, Immortal Toya was dumbstruck. While he had already anticipated this result, the fact that Ling Zhenren actually hadn't moved the slightest bit at all after taking a hit from the godly thunder inheritance was really too much of an exaggeration.</p>

    <p>This result, however, excited Dharmaraja. "Senior Ling is really amazing, and truly lives up to his reputation!"</p>

    <p>The power in his left hand sparked more violently than before, and in that instant, lightning flashed and a loud thunderclap resounded throughout the whole square!</p>

    <p>It could only be said that the godly thunder inheritance was worthy of its name; it contained a power that could even change the weather.</p>

    <p>The sky above the square had been clear and vast before they had arrived; now, black streams of cloud spiraled overhead and gathered together in the air.</p>

    <p>The weather had become overcast and fog rolled out from the center of the square, making it impossible to see ahead. Even with his Heavenly Eye open as he watched from the side, Immortal Toya could only see two indistinct figures in the fog...</p>

    <p>"It truly is a holy relic, how powerful." As he watched the battle, Immortal Toya secretly sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p>At that moment, a drop of rain fell on the tip of his nose, and gradually more raindrops began to fall from the sky above the square.</p>

    <p>There was a loud roar, and this time in the nebulous fog, Immortal Toya saw lightning flash eight times!</p>

    <p>The eight-layer godly thunder inheritance was on an entirely different level than the previous layer; Dharmaraja's punch this time was accompanied by bursts of lightning, and the violent force caused the ground to explode and form holes in the square's surface.</p>

    <p>The stone bricks were completely scorched from the lightning, and some had cracks in them... Immortal Toya could already imagine the mess after the battle. Dharmaraja was probably going to have to be responsible for fixing all the bricks on the ground here.</p>

    <p>Who knew whether there was any metal in the stone bricks or not. If Dharmaraja couldn't repair them, he would have to pay compensation for each one. These stone bricks were remnants of the Great Battle Qi era; the market value of one was equivalent to the price of a chicken cup<sup>1</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This refers to cups that were forged in imperial kilns during the Ming dynasty which have chickens painted on them. There are only 19 known genuine cups in existence. In 2014, a chicken cup sold at an auction in Hong Kong for $36.3 million.)</dfn>

    <p>Standing in the square and looking at these broken bricks, Immortal Toya couldn't help stepping back.</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja's punch once again landed on Wang Ling's chest, and once again Wang Ling felt refreshed, like all his arteries and veins were being massaged.</p>

    <p>"How? Did it work?"</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja looked in front of him and just saw Wang Ling, who had taken the punch, nod slightly.</p>

    <p>Both the strength and the impact of this punch was on a level higher than the seven-layer godly thunder. Assuming that no precautions had been taken, if the seven-layer godly thunder could paralyze a Soul Formation cultivator, then the eight-layer godly thunder was powerful enough to severely cripple a Soul Formation cultivator.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, of all the holy relics, the godly thunder inheritance had a particularly unique attribute. Once a body was injured by this lightning force, the damage was almost irreversible; the body would become incapable of regenerating cells to fix itself. In contrast, paralysis of the nerves was the lightest condition.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling twisted his neck from side to side. Dharmaraja's mouth had dropped open with immense shock and amazement. What kind of monster was he really up against?</p>

    <p>"Dharmaraja, why don't you try using your full strength?" Immortal Toya couldn't take it anymore.</p>

    <p>A person who had been hit by the godly thunder inheritance twice in succession actually showed no reaction at all! This really was the first time something like this had ever happened...</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja looked at the rainbow-colored light that swirled in his palm. For the first time, he wondered a little suspiciously whether he had inherited a possibly fake holy relic!</p>

    <p>Standing in the same spot in the middle of the square, Wang Ling waved at Dharmaraja.</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja's heart instantly crumbled a little. He had never thought that a day would come where he would truly be able to exert the full strength of the godly thunder inheritance.</p>

    <p>Drawing in a breath, he calmed his thoughts, and the lightning in his hand surged up once again. "From ancient times until now, there have been no records in our clan of anyone who has been able to escape the bombardment of the ten-layer godly thunder inheritance completely unscathed."</p>

    <p>He looked at Wang Ling with some awe in his eyes.</p>

    <p>Previously, Dharmaraja had only heard about Wang Ling's prowess through various channels. Before meeting him properly, no one could tell whether this renowned senior in the cultivation circle really was as formidable as the rumors said. But now, Dharmaraja could confirm that rumors which argued that Ling Zhenren was actually nothing special were complete rubbish.</p>

    <p>This Senior Ling was really ridiculously strong!</p>

    <p>After ten bursts, the power of the godly thunder inheritance reached a brand new level once again.</p>

    <p>In a blink of an eye, the weather changed, and the light drizzle from before turned into a torrential storm. The lightning in Dharmaraja's left hand was like an electric dragon; in the split second when he streaked forward, the bricks beneath him crumbled straightaway, leaving a trench in the ground a dozen meters long.</p>

    <p>This strong pressure from dozens of meters away had already reached Wang Ling's face, and he could feel the tremors.</p>

    <p>His eyes finally darkened at the full extent of the power of the godly thunder inheritance. He could indeed feel a destructive force about to descend upon him.</p>

    <p>If the old devil in the stone ghost mask had been the person who wielded the power of this godly thunder inheritance, Wang Ling felt that the world would probably be doomed to extinction.</p>

    <p>This was Dharmaraja's most powerful blow. Wang Ling didn't think that he had ever felt so much force behind a punch before, and he had to suppress the tingling sensation in his chest.</p>

    <p>But unfortunately, Dharmaraja's movements were too slow, and Wang Ling was able to break down each move with his eyes.</p>

    <p>When Dharmaraja was just half a body length away, Wang Ling slowly raised his hand to accurately catch the former's fierce punch, his five fingers closing over Dharmaraja's fist.</p>

    <p>Instantly, the electric dragon in Dharmaraja's hand quietened down, but at the same time, the power of a tremendous backlash surged forth!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's body was bathed in golden light, and before the force of the backlash completely emerged, he also covered Dharmaraja and Immortal Toya in the light. Then, powerful spirit pressure burst out in every direction from Wang Ling as the center.</p>

    <p>In a few seconds, the backlash from Wang Ling swept away the rain, and the clouds in the sky scattered as things returned to a tranquil state.</p>

    <p>The sun once again shone through the clouds. When Immortal Toya opened his eyes, what he saw was Wang Ling with his fingers wrapped around Dharmaraja's fist in the middle of the square.</p>

    <p>The scene at this moment reminded him of the "Come on, you're so weak, hey" meme<sup>2</sup>...</p>
