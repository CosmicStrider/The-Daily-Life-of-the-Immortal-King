  <h1>Chapter 629 Don't Use a Traitorous Company</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Actually, Xiao Yin had been harboring a fantasy all these years that the holy beasts had not been truly exterminated. Even just one other holy beast that was still alive apart from him would be good! But over the years, even when human cultivators used all kinds of advanced scientific magic treasures in their investigation, they hadn't been able to find the whereabouts of any holy beast... Xiao Yin had thought that his fantasy was shattered, but hearing about the angler and prehistoric vicious beasts now, he instantly saw a glimmer of hope.</p>

    <p>There had been news before of a plane whose signal was suddenly lost mid-flight and which directly vanished without a trace for ten years. In the end, after a hundred years, this group of people that had already been treated as dead at the time appeared on a mysterious island, where they had even established a stone village.</p>

    <p>So maybe miracles really did happen!</p>

    <p>"Thunder, Thunder! I'm going out! I'm going to Master's place!" After confirming the operation with Er Ha, Xiao Yin intended to set out immediately, so he informed Lord Diulei of his plan.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin originally wasn't in the habit of doing so, but there were times when you really had to believe in the inexplicable... currently, looking at his three trips to the police station, if he went out alone, he would definitely wind up there again.</p>

    <p>So now Xiao Yin didn't dare be rash - it was safer to find someone to go with him.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Lord Diulei let go of his mouse and looked at him. "Alright, Brother Xiao, I'll drive you there."</p>

    <p>In fact, it was Thunder himself who insisted that Xiao Yin be accompanied by someone when he went out. Although he had acquaintances at the police station, he still had to go in to do the basic bail procedure. If Xiao Yin was detained when he was out, who was the one who would suffer for it...</p>

    <p>It was thus better to save himself the hassle. Although sending Xiao Yin to Brother Ling's place was time-consuming, it was a lot better than wasting time at the police station later...</p>

    <p>Thunder put down what he was doing and prepared to get his car. It was only then that Xiao Yin realized that this would be his first time sitting in a car that Thunder would be driving!</p>

    <p>"Thunder! What kind of car do you drive?" Xiao Yin couldn't help asking.</p>

    <p>"A Huawei triphibian spirit car; it can be used on land, in the water, or in the air! It's very fast!" Lord Diulei grinned.</p>

    <p>"Huh? I remember there's a brand called Lenovo?"</p>

    <p>"I don't use it." Lord Diulei quickly waved his hand. "They're traitors!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin raised an eyebrow. Although Thunder said it lightly, Xiao Yin felt that the man brimmed with righteousness.</p>

    <p>He suddenly seemed to understand a little better why Master had left him at Thunder's place. Wasn't this a hint that he should learn more from Lord Diulei?</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin felt that any other explanation apart from this one would be unscientific! Given Master's realm, there was no way he would have dumped Xiao Yin here for the sake of saving money!</p>

    <p>Mm, that had to be it!</p>

    <p>Just as Lord Diulei was about to get his car from the garage, Xiao Yin suddenly yelled, "Thunder! Thunder!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Is there something else, Brother Xiao?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "Can I live here forever..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei smiled. "Of course, Brother Xiao, just treat this as your own home."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "Thunder! Thunder! When I come back from my assignment, can I not order takeout and have broccoli instead?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was startled. "Brother Xiao, you would be willing to eat broccoli?" His impression was that Xiao Yin was usually extremely repulsed by vegetables... this sudden change in attitude actually caught Lord Diulei off guard.</p>

    <p>"Brother Xiao, you..."</p>

    <p>"I just suddenly want to eat it. Something wrong with that?"</p>

    <p>"How can that be? Brother Xiao, you can have as much broccoli as you want!" Reasonably speaking, Lord Diulei was a little excited as he felt like he had found a kindred spirit.</p>

    <p>"Alright! Then it's a deal! Once my assignment is complete, I'll come back and eat it!" Xiao Yin was overjoyed.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Although Lord Diulei was very happy, why did he feel like Xiao Yin had raised a very strange FLAG <sup>1</sup> ?</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(To "raise a flag" is similar to jinxing something..)</dfn>

    <p>Erm... It was like in those TV dramas when the soldiers said to their fiancees before they went off to war: <em>Let's get married when the war is over.</em></p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The two of them then went to the garage beside the villa. Xiao Yin saw Lord Diulei stand at the garage door for a few seconds before the closed door automatically opened.</p>

    <p>This garage was equipped with a face recognition system.</p>

    <p>Then, an exquisite triphibian SUV appeared in front of Xiao Yin. It was a dark gold in color and covered in solid vehicle armor. It looked very cumbersome, but in fact it was very light, more so than most of the supercars on the market.</p>

    <p>This was the first time Xiao Yin saw Lord Diulei's car, and it gave him a refreshing feeling.</p>

    <p>Starting a spirit car was vastly different from starting an ordinary car; it didn't use a car key, but a spirit sword.</p>

    <p>All spirit cars purchased by cultivators were tied to their spirit swords at the specialty store.</p>

    <p>"How does it start up?" Xiao Yin asked. He had never seen this thing, and knew very little about the spirit cars which modern cultivators used.</p>

    <p>"Starting it is very simple. First, you need to take out the spirit sword which it's tied to." Lord Diulei summoned his Brilliant Victory sword, and then opened something that looked similar to a fuel cap at the back of the car. With the sword still in its sheath, he stuck it in.</p>

    <p>With a roar of the engine, the car smoothly started up.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Brother Xiao, don't just stand there, get in!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On a sword, it would take two hours in total to get to the Wang family's small villa from Wenxian Garden, while it was in fact faster by car. That was because there was a sky bridge at high altitudes especially made for vehicles to travel along. Only those who drove could use the bridge, while those on swords couldn't.</p>

    <p>But nowadays, even if cultivators bought a car, they usually left it at home to collect dust unless it was an important occasion, since just traveling on a sword was somewhat more convenient.</p>

    <p>It took less than three minutes for the car to lift off unhurriedly and travel steadily along the sky bridge in the direction of the Wang family's small villa.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin looked around curiously. This was the first time he had seen such a modern high-altitude thoroughfare!</p>

    <p>But after less than five or six minutes of driving, Xiao Yin suddenly frowned as he turned his eyes to the clouds.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei noticed Xiao Yin's odd behavior. "What's wrong, Brother Xiao?"</p>

    <p>"Feels like killing intent!" Xiao Yin clenched his teeth as he stared at the cloud layers. He had what was almost a natural sensitivity to this type of malicious aura.</p>

    <p>There was definitely no mistake!</p>

    <p>This was malicious killing intent... and it felt a little familiar!</p>

    <p>"Who is it?" Lord Diulei gripped the steering wheel, on high alert.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Xiao Yin's eyes darkened. Although he wasn't one hundred percent sure, this aura was very similar to the killing intent from that Mr Lu before...</p>

    <p>This killing intent was from the Demon Hunters Association!</p>
