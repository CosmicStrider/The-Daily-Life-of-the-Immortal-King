  <h1>Chapter 675 Sorry, It's My Thinking That's Crooked!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Mother Juan had worked at Number 60 High for over a hundred years; since it was established, the first generation of teachers had already eaten her communal cooking. Many teachers were very familiar with Mother Juan, but sometimes when they thought about it carefully, they realized that they knew very little about Mother Juan. They didn't even know where she came from, only that she had many disciples in the world of cooking.</p>

    <p>Director Shi's expression thus turned slightly heavy after she heard Headmaster Chen's words. He hadn't told her everything, but even this was frightening enough to think about.</p>

    <p>If the dishes at the food tasting event hadn't been for the parents...</p>

    <p>Then had Mother Juan anticipated an attack by the Demon Hunters Association earlier on?</p>

    <p>Director Shi didn't dare dwell on it any further, because the result might be too scary for her. Although she was the director of education at Number 60 High, her time at Number 60 High School was less than one fifth of the time Mother Juan had been here.</p>

    <p>All this time, Director Shi had thought that Mother Juan was just a kitchen auntie who couldn't be any more ordinary and who often liked to study some new novel cuisine. But given what Headmaster Chen was now implying, Director Shi suddenly felt that she wasn't simple.</p>

    <p>"I am not at liberty to say much about it. Director, you can reflect on it yourself." Headmaster Chen steepled his fingers and smiled. "Our school may be small, but a good number of teachers here don't have simple backgrounds..."</p>

    <p>Director Shi wiped at her sweat. "I understand, Headmaster..."</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen: "Don't look down on the teachers, and don't ignore how the parents feel. Some of the parents are bound to already know the situation. I'll take responsibility for handling the students' safety, and I'll have to trouble the director to deal with the parents' state of mind and feelings."</p>

    <p>"Very well, Lord Headmaster." Director Shi nodded.</p>

    <p>She sighed in her heart, because she wasn't sure whether all the parents knew about this. On this point, she decided to arrange for the teachers-in-charge to coordinate all available teachers to pay home visits in twos or threes later on.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, Zhuo Yi had already verified Elder Yaren's identity. Not only was he an elite member of the Demon Hunters Association who had returned from overseas, he also had a high position in the organization. From the communication device which was seized off him, the police found plenty of proof of his identity as well as evidence of his close connection to that Elder Ji Xing.</p>

    <p>Songhai First Prison.</p>

    <p>When Zhuo Yi went there again, the prison guards at the gate who were already familiar with him saw his license plate number from a distance. After verifying the identities of the people in the car, the prison gate was already slowly opening by the time the car reached it.</p>

    <p>All of Zhuo Yi's work here that was related to the arrest of major criminals was now carried out jointly with Songhai First Prison.</p>

    <p>In addition to keeping custody of the criminals, follow-up interrogations were also conducted here.</p>

    <p>Elder Yaren had been directly sent here by the new anti-chemical protection team and put in solitary confinement. He had been deeply infected by poison. Although the recovery cells inside his body were constantly trying to cure him, there didn't seem to be a way to completely get rid of Elder Yin's poison.</p>

    <p>The silver lining in this entire fiasco was that the first anti-chemical protection team that had been dispatched weren't dead. They were found in the green belt, in a hidden barrier which Elder Yaren had put down; a careful search revealed corroborating evidence for this fact.</p>

    <p>In other words, this Elder Yaren hadn't intended to stir up anything in the first place; his only goal was to retrieve Elder Yin's corpse... in the end, he was infected.</p>

    <p>In the car, Zhuo Yi smacked his face and dropped his forehead heavily into his hand. What kind of operation was this?!</p>

    <p>Zhong Lang: "Brother Zhuo, you look a little unwell, are you alright?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "I'm fine, I'm fine... It's just a pain in the ass..."</p>

    <p>Zhong Lang: "..."</p>

    <p>After sending Zhuo Yi off, Zhong Lang went back to the General Administration of 100 Schools first. They now knew about the Demon Hunters Association's revenge plan against Number 60 High tomorrow and alarmist word of it had already leaked as rumors which some parents had caught wind of. The hotline of the General Administration of 100 Schools was now blowing up with calls from Number 60 High parents, most of whom wanted to check the situation.</p>

    <p>So Zhong Lang had no choice but to go back and handle this key issue.</p>

    <p>It was very important to placate the parents.</p>

    <p>It was quite normal for people to fear the unknown.</p>

    <p>In addition, the ultimate leader of the Demon Hunters Association was still on the run. Now, the other party was planning to retaliate against Number 60 High, the alma mater of Zhuo Yi, who was the chief overseer of the Demon Hunters Association case. Indeed, this caused a lot of parents to panic.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi already didn't intend to read the news online; as the chief overseer of this matter, it was indeed inexcusable that until now, he had yet to capture President Bai.</p>

    <p>He felt that it didn't matter if he was scolded a little; in any case, he just needed to have thick enough skin.</p>

    <p>As long as your conscience was clear in whatever you did as a person, that was enough.</p>

    <p>The most thick-skinned thing he had ever done in his life was to ask Wang Ling to be his shifu.</p>

    <p>Hence, Zhuo Yi was indifferent to the empty abuse he was getting online.</p>

    <p>Warden Liang had already been waiting in the office for a long time.</p>

    <p>When Zhuo Yi entered, Warden Liang smiled at him, same as ever.</p>

    <p>This was what it meant when some were happy while some were worried... while it was true that Zhuo Yi was being scolded on one hand, Warden Liang on the other hand was in a cheerful mood.</p>

    <p>More bigwigs had been imprisoned here at Songhai First Prison in the past two or three months than in previous years! Nowadays, attention was also paid to the quality of prisoners that a prison had. With so many high-quality prisoners, the prison would reap a lot of benefits!</p>

    <p>The Spirit Shackles' restriction on spirit energy could be adjusted manually. Ordinarily, the Spirit Shackles restriction on people like the old devil, the Master of Immortal Mansion Cheng Yu and Evil Sword God were lifted a little to allow them to use five percent of their spirit energy to help the prison complete various construction tasks.</p>

    <p>The old devil and the others were viewed as important manpower who were frequently ordered about. They might look idle, and usually could still find time to play cards, but the truth was that they were taking a breather from being busy...</p>

    <p>Although Elder Yaren had currently been poisoned, Warden Liang was profoundly aware that Elder Yaren had an ability that was close to immortality.</p>

    <p>"Director Zhuo, have a seat."</p>

    <p>Warden Liang pulled Zhuo Yi to one side and prompted a sightly blank-looking male secretary in the office, "Why are you spacing out? Hurry up and pour some tea for Director Zhuo!"</p>

    <p>But after saying that, Warden Liang felt that tea wasn't fitting enough, and whispered to Zhuo Yi, "Hey Old Zhuo, I just bought a bottle of Commander Li Sweet Potato Wine, it's eight hundred years old! Want to try some?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "We're on the clock... I'll pass..."</p>

    <p>"Alright then."</p>

    <p>Warden Liang nodded, took a seat, and looked at Zhuo Yi. "Come look for me anytime you want a drink, no need to be polite!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi sighed. "What's the situation?"</p>

    <p>"Hm, we currently have some pertinent leads from the device Elder Yaren was carrying on him. This Elder Yaren and the Elder Ji Xing whom Elder Zuo Wu mentioned don't have an ordinary relationship." Warden Liang said, "In Elder Yaren's text messages, Elder Ji Xing calls him Little Yaya... What do you think Elder Yaren calls Elder Ji Xing?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was taken aback. "..."</p>

    <p>Little... Jiji?Also a homonym for Chinese slang for the penis.</p>
