  <h1>Chapter 132 The Upcoming, Extremely Nasty Physical Exam Before Military Training </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was still May 28th, the fifth Friday after the start of the semester.</p>

    <p>During the Dao Talismans class today, Teacher Pan made a curious announcement.</p>

    <p>Standing on the dais, Teacher Pan pushed up her glasses as she said mysteriously, "Students, after careful consideration by the higher-ups, and in line with the local government's aim of reinforcing education on female defense against perverts, the military training program which was planned for Senior Grade Two has been moved forward. It's scheduled to take place in the middle of next month, and will be a five-day military training activity held on Songhai city's cultivation military base."</p>

    <p>Hearing Teacher Pan's words, the whole class immediately exploded.</p>

    <p>Whether it was guys or girls, anyone would be happy the moment they heard of the military training. Because during those few days of training, the school wouldn't assign homework! But as students of Number 60 High School's elite class, the students of Grade One, Class Three who knew Teacher Pan's personality quite well didn't betray too much excitement.</p>

    <p>Because to Teacher Pan, no matter how much or how little homework there was, it had to be done! The best example of this was when Wang Ling and the others had gone to Number 59 High School for the exchange meet.</p>

    <p>While a new round of discussion started up in the class, three people quietly covered their faces.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao covered his face because he was so happy he could cry. As a passionate sports fool, he felt that finally, the time had come when he could showcase his abilities!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling covered his face because he totally hadn't expected the group activity to happen so soon! He vaguely remembered the scene at Number 59 High School the last time, when Zhuo Yi had held up Secretary Dakang's two hairy legs. Every time he recalled it, Wang Ling felt his brain hurt. All in all, group activities were just a bad idea when it came to him...</p>

    <p>Su Xiao was the last person who covered his face. This was because he had heard Grade Three's Clan Leader Yu once say that the school would conduct a compulsory physical examination before the military training, as they needed to understand each student's specific physical attributes in order for the military training base to develop a scientific training program for them.</p>

    <p>After the whole class settled down under Teacher Pan's gaze, she cleared her throat and continued, "There will be no classes in the afternoon today. Student Sun Rong will lead the girls and Student Chen Chao will lead the boys to the infirmary on the third floor for the physical exams. Everyone has to go; if you don't have special exemption, students who fail to participate will take two more test papers back with them as homework."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Su Xiao silently drew back the hand he had raised...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..." As expected, compared with a physical exam, homework was the most evil bane of all!</p>

    <p>From a young age, Wang Ling in fact had seldom had a physical exam.</p>

    <p>Because given his immortal body, he simply didn't need one!</p>

    <p>For cultivators, Foundation Establishment high school students should naturally have Foundation Establishment physiques which were far superior to those of ordinary people.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had always felt that the one-sided physical exams which schools conducted in fact had no substance. This was the so-called not checking what should be checked and checking what didn't need to be checked. He felt that what those old aunties in the infirmary really cared about wasn't the students' physique, and instead purely just wanted to see if a certain part of the body had grown...</p>

    <p>Therefore, he was like Su Xiao, as the thought of the physical exam gave them both a real headache.</p>

    <p>It was just that Wang Ling's reason was the complete opposite to Su Xiao's.</p>

    <p>Su Xiao thought his was just too small; he would be laughed at for not achieving the average standard for a boy...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, on the other hand, felt that his was too big; to far exceed the standard for an average boy would draw concern and attention...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the afternoon, there was a long, winding queue at the door of the infirmary. Chen Chao had led the boys of Grade One, Class Three here to undergo the physical exam.</p>

    <p>As Wang Ling had predicted, a short old auntie with a slightly hunched back stood at the door of the infirmary. She wore a white gown and a pair of very mystical-looking long-sighted glasses; her eyes scanned the crowd like a searchlight. "Settle down and don't be noisy. Wait for Doctor Song to give you your physical exam."</p>

    <p>Doctor Song?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that this title seemed a little familiar, so he sneaked a look with his Heavenly Eye... what the fuck, this Doctor Song was Lie Mengmeng!</p>

    <p>At that moment, Lie Mengmeng was putting on a pair of white gloves, his face expressionless. He greased his middle finger with some lube, and then checked the condition of a male student's anus. As soon as the tip of his finger went in, the boy's face revealed a twisted expression like Liang Yifeng's when he was reciting poetry <sup>1</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Liang Yifeng, or Leung
Yatfung in Cantonese, is a
student who became Internet
famous for a clip of him
reciting poetry in an
exaggerated and almost
melodramatic fashion.)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Hearing the boy inside shriek, someone in the queue couldn't help asking, "Holy shit! Don't tell me everyone gets checked like that?"</p>

    <p>The old auntie who was standing at the door to maintain order showed a "kind" smile. "We're just taking samples for testing — two samples per class."</p>

    <p>And then, she picked up an information sheet and glanced at it. "In your Grade One, Class Three, Students Chen Chao and Guo Hao are responsible for providing the test samples — are they here?"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao and Guo Hao both couldn't help trembling. "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Very quickly, the boys in the class before them were all done with their physical exams, and it was finally Grade One, Class Three's students' turn.</p>

    <p>After Chen Chao and Guo Hao, these two students who were responsible for providing test samples, were taken aside, the rest of the boys entered the infirmary one after another; inside, there was a thick smell of disinfectant in the air.</p>

    <p>At the sight of Wang Ling, Lie Mengmeng's expression finally changed slightly. Quickly composing himself, he put on those evil white gloves. He pointed at the small bed in front of Chen Chao and Guo Hao. "You two, take off your pants and bend over there. Then... hold your buttocks open yourself."</p>

    <p>The two people nodded fearfully and approached the bed. After they were both in position, Lie Mengmeng drew the curtain shut.</p>

    <p>From the shadow on the curtain, everyone saw Lie Mengmeng's next move...</p>

    <p>He liberally greased his finger with lube...</p>

    <p>Behind the curtain, there was a sinister squelching sound, then Lie Mengmeng could be seen using the one thousand years of death <sup>2</sup> as he hit the bullseye!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>('One thousand years of
death' is a translation of the
Japanese Sennen Goroshi,
which is a ninja technique
used in the Japanese
cartoon Naruto, and
involves clasping the hands
together so that the index
fingers are sticking out and
poking them into a person's anus.)</dfn>

    <p>This was immediately followed by Chen Chao's shrill and miserable cry from behind the curtain.</p>

    <p>Su Xiao was already so frightened that he had covered his eyes, completely unable to bear watching any longer...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling couldn't help sighing inside his heart. In ancient times, people sang "A Song of Courtyard Flowers" <sup>3</sup> on the other side of the river; now, they were standing around to watch a chrysanthemum <sup>4</sup> getting poked on the other side of the curtain.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(This is the last line of a
9th-century poem 'Mooring
on Qinhuai River.' The
musical piece "A Song of the
Courtyard Flowers"
玉树后庭花 which the poem
alludes to here was written
by the last emperor of the
Chen dynasty in the 6th
century. In the poem
however, the song is
referred to as 后庭花,or
"flowers of the rear garden."
This phrase has also come
to be used to describe male
same-sex relations.)</dfn>
    
    <br/>
    
    <dfn><sup>4</sup>(The chrysanthemum is
perhaps one of the most
common ways in Chinese to
describe a man's anus ..)</dfn>

    <p>Very soon, Chen Chao's exam was over. As he came waddling out from around the curtain and covering his butt, some of the boys snickered.</p>

    <p>"Was it that painful?" A pompous boy patted Chen Chao's shoulder.</p>

    <p>In return, Chen Chao glared at him with a "Go and try it yourself if you dare" expression.</p>

    <p>At this moment, everyone saw that behind the curtain, Lie Mengmeng had already changed into a pair of new white gloves and had lubed up his finger.</p>

    <p>But this time, the expected shriek didn't come...</p>

    <p>As a practitioner of the Flow of Five Pens, Guo Hao was indeed Guo Hao. He promptly used his professional insight to call into question Lie Mengmeng's caliber and ability.</p>

    <p>Behind the curtain, Guo Hao heaved a sigh. "You're not poking in the right place, you know? It's very easy to get hurt!"</p>

    <p>Everybody: "..." <em>Bloody hell! Why do you know that?!</em></p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "You're an intern, right? You bend over and I'll teach you!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>In the face of a Foundation Establishment cultivator, Lie Mengmeng as an ordinary person had no strength to fight back at all with his frail body, and was directly pressed onto the bed by Guo Hao... when Guo Hao put on the white gloves and poked his anus, Lie Mengmeng was already drowning in a flood of tears. Motherfucker! Trying to earn extra income nowadays really wasn't fucking easy!</p>
