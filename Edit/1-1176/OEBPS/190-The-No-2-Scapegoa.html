  <h1>Chapter 190 The Number 2 Scapegoat </h1>

  <div>

    <p>The scene sunk into awkwardness for a time. His ancient magic sword in one hand, Devil Emperor Gua Pi fell down at Wang Ling's feet like a believer worshiping at Bright Summit <sup>1</sup>.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Bright Summit is a holy place
in the Chinese martial arts
novel "The Heavenly Sword
and Dragon Saber .. ")</dfn>

    <p>The spirit energy wrapped around the blade had yet to be released, and the moment this black dagger touched the ground, fissures instantly appeared in the earth as they spread out in all directions from the blade at its center.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling had sharp eyes and deft hands, and he reached forward to pick up the blade.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling could feel the fierce magic pulse strongly in his hand. Lying prone on the ground, Devil Emperor Gua Pi raised his head and laughed coldly. "Even if you have a Sage Body, so what? My ancient magic blade was specially designed to destroy holy bodies. Now that you are holding the magic blade, its qi will invade your holy body and crack it open... my chance has now come!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling frowned slightly; indeed, he could feel traces of the sword qi enter his body, but it had little to no effect on him, so this really couldn't be the key to deciding the outcome of this confrontation.</p>

    <p>Yet this old devil seemed to have misunderstood something. When he saw Wang Ling grab hold of the magic blade, he burst into wild laughter in his heart and was confident that everything was within his calculations.</p>

    <p>In the next instant, he stood up from the ground, cradling the two lumps on his chest. "After the sword qi invades your body, it will remain in you forever unless the magic blade is destroyed! It's made of prehistoric materials and will only get harder with the passing of time; it's impossible for you to break it."</p>

    <p>Hearing the old devil's words, Wang Ling was stumped for a bit. "..."</p>

    <p>Then, he directly squeezed this ancient magic blade and snapped it with a crack.</p>

    <p>Breaking a blade...</p>

    <p>This was his special ability!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling recalled how, as a one-year-old genius, he had taught himself to destroy a precious sword barehanded.</p>

    <p>As the blade's power dispersed, this ancient magic blade abruptly lost its glow...</p>

    <p>At the same time, dead silence reigned on the scene.</p>

    <p>Some distance away, Immortal Toya was stupefied; even Third Saint, who had just arrived, was rooted to the spot as he stared blankly... what had they just seen?</p>

    <p>Although they weren't close enough to know exactly what had transpired, they could tell which way the wind had blown in this battle from the possessed Master of Shadow Stream Jiang Liuyue's expression.</p>

    <p>At that moment, the old devil was sweating profusely, to the point that his clothes were all soaked. He looked at the youngster in front of him as if he was seeing a monster and drew in a sharp breath.</p>

    <p>Although he was very reluctant to admit it, Devil Emperor Gua Pi knew that given the current momentum, there was no chance at all of him winning.</p>

    <p>Breaking an ancient magic blade barehanded...</p>

    <p>Even at his peak, he had never met such a savage person before!</p>

    <p>All this time that he had been sealed inside the stone ghost mask, what on earth had happened in this world?!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling took off the yellow delivery helmet he had been wearing to reveal a head of tousled black hair. Half of his face had been hidden by the helmet's protective visor before, and it was only now that Devil Emperor Gua Pi clearly saw his face.</p>

    <p>A string in his brain suddenly pulled taut â€” he had actually seen this person before!</p>

    <p>Back when the stone ghost mask had just been delivered to the Wang family's small villa, Devil Emperor Gua Pi remembered that he had tried to sink his claws into a youngster, but in the end, the hooks had failed to pierce his face.</p>

    <p>Now, he finally realized... this was the same person!</p>

    <p>At that very moment, as the old devil fixed his eyes on Wang Ling, he was drenched in sweat. This was a fear that he had never felt before. In the thousands of years that he had faced down countless opponents, none of them had ever evoked such terror as he was feeling today.</p>

    <p>"Your Excellency... who on earth are you?" The old devil stared fixedly at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Furrowing his brow, Wang Ling didn't deign to reply.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, an old Taoist in white suddenly popped up behind him. "The Master of Shadow Stream! To face off against Senior Killer Taoist... why don't you just give up?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Killer Taoist, is it? The junior who is ranked first on the ranking list of killers? Hehe... I'll remember you!" The old devil's eyes darkened as he looked at Third Saint behind Wang Ling. "And you, I'll remember you as well!"</p>

    <p>As soon as he said this, he suddenly released purple gold fog and his figure promptly vanished in its midst, leaving behind the words: <em>Just you wait for this venerable self to get you!</em></p>

    <p>Then, he disappeared without a trace.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren is too awesome!" Immortal Toya exclaimed in his heart as he came over. Even with his Heavenly Eye, he still hadn't been able to clearly see the confrontation between the two top masters just now. He was now deeply suspicious about whether his Heavenly Eye was real or not!</p>

    <p>As that purple gold fog dispersed in front of Wang Ling, he felt it was a bit unfortunate.</p>

    <p>For him, trying to catch this old devil alive was much harder than killing him; if the intent from the beginning had been to kill him, the other party wouldn't have had a chance to escape.</p>

    <p>What had to be said was that Wang Ling had certainly experienced for himself how powerful this old devil was as someone who had once given the entire Huaxiu nation a severe headache. Wang Ling was clear on the fact that in terms of sheer strength, this old devil certainly couldn't rival him. But unfortunately, the old devil had hidden on his person a lot of magic treasures that Wang Ling didn't know about, and they were all in another space. He could reach into this space anytime and take out whatever he needed, which was as troublesome as a particular robot cat's space pocket.</p>

    <p>This purple gold fog was one of Devil Emperor Gua Pi's magic treasures which he used as a means of escape.</p>

    <p>Of course, the old devil had also left something behind on the ground, and that was the ancient magic blade which Wang Ling had crushed.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had already reduced the middle portion of the dagger to sand. Just by looking at it, one could tell that there was no way it could be restored, hence why the old devil had simply tossed it aside like cabbage.</p>

    <p>Standing behind Wang Ling, both Third Saint and Immortal Toya opened their Heavenly Eyes to scan the air around them. It was only after they had made sure that Jiang Liuyue had truly disappeared that they sighed.</p>

    <p>"What a waste to have let this person escape!" Third Saint shook his head regretfully, then turned his gaze to Immortal Toya and bowed. "I'm guessing that this is Senior Immortal Toya? I'm Third Saint!"</p>

    <p>"Do you know me?"</p>

    <p>"...Immortal Toya's name is so famous that it's impossible for this junior to not know you." Actually, these were just empty words; previously, when Third Saint and the other nine saints had planned to rob Lord Diulei's house of the stone ghost mask, they had researched everyone whom he had a close relationship with.</p>

    <p>If he told the truth, he would definitely be regarded as a pervert!</p>

    <p>"I'm not that famous, right?" Immortal Toya scratched his head somewhat embarrassedly. He knew about Third Saint, since Lord Diulei had mentioned before in the group chat that of the Ten Saints, there was one called Third Saint who had defected. He had never expected that they would actually meet here in this way.</p>

    <p>In addition, Immortal Toya in fact knew that this Third Saint was under the assumption that Ling Zhenren was that legendary number one killer on the ranking list, Killer Taoist.</p>

    <p>However, looking at the current situation, Ling Zhenren didn't seem to have any intention of clarifying this matter.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya immediately understood.</p>

    <p>Hmm... since this Killer Taoist had already become the scapegoat, they might as well continue letting him be the scapegoat...</p>
