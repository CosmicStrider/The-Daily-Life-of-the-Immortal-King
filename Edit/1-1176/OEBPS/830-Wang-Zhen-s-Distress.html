  <h1>Chapter 830 Wang Zhen's Distress</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was August 9th on Wednesday in the fifteenth week of the semester.</p>

    <p>The day after the Office of Strategic Deception announced its establishment and had a smooth founding ceremony, the news that Ultimate King of Killers would be given the death penalty straightaway shook the whole country.</p>

    <p>Not long after he was taken back, his memories were completely extracted; given King of Killers's personality, he wouldn't say anything in an interrogation, right up to his death.</p>

    <p>Forcibly extracting memories was something that could only be done on the most heinous prisoners on death row, otherwise it was a violation of a person's personal rights.</p>

    <p>The reason why Ultimate King of Killers's memories were extracted so smoothly was ultimately because Wang Ling had sealed off his power in the end, leaving Ultimate King of Killers powerless to struggle.</p>

    <p>As an old adversary, General Yi understood this Ultimate King of Killers too well; this was a very tough person.</p>

    <p>If his strength wasn't restricted, he might even destroy his own brain without hesitation.</p>

    <p>In the conference room for the Ten Generals at the Huaxiu Alliance building.</p>

    <p>"In any case, this is all thanks to Lord Diulei's help this time." General Yi sighed.</p>

    <p>This time, General Yi and Marshal Jiang had witnessed an ample, preliminary demonstration of Lord Diulei's battle strength. As for why they called it a preliminary demonstration, that was because the gap in their strengths was so obvious that it felt like Lord Diulei hadn't used all of his at all.</p>

    <p>The most pivotal thing was that he had terrifyingly precise and skillful mastery over his power... This absolutely wasn't something that an ordinary person could do.</p>

    <p>"Who would have thought we hit the nail on the head this time. It is this Lord Diulei who is the strongest, when we were so focused on that Ling Zhenren and Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch before. It seems they were just a cover for Senior Immortal." Marshal Jiang also sighed feelingly. "This time, Senior Immortal chose to directly become a True Venerated in public during the founding ceremony; he's already demonstrating to the world that he's a man who will do great things, and will certainly raise the Office of Strategic Deception to great heights."</p>

    <p>"So, in the end, the head of state truly had unique foresight."</p>

    <p>President Qi nodded. "It's only because of the head of state's command that Huaxiu Alliance has a share in the Office of Strategic Deception's investment plan. When it expands again in the future... the results will be unimaginable."</p>

    <p>After saying this, President Qi fell silent and didn't go on to elaborate.</p>

    <p>But in fact, the Ten Generals' hearts were as clear as a mirror.</p>

    <p>It could only be said that not only was Lord Diulei an expert, he was also a meticulous person. He wanted the Office of Strategic Deception to grow into the number one Sky-level sect, but couldn't break away from Huaxiu Alliance's restrictions. Thus, when he accepted the investment from Huaxiu Alliance, he was in fact taking the initiative to set up a collaboration with Huaxiu Alliance.</p>

    <p>Now, Huaxiu Alliance occupied a pretty prominent position in the Office of Strategic Deception's plan for future development.</p>

    <p>And this also put a stop to rumors in the outside world that the Office of Strategic Deception was going to become a country within a country...</p>

    <p>Besides, if Lord Diulei hadn't helped to stop that Ultimate King of Killers, their standing as the Ten Generals might have suffered a blow.</p>

    <p>"Now that everyone is a family, we must first think of a way to explain Senior Immortal's advancement to True Venerated level to the rest of the world," President Qi said.</p>

    <p>This was the main purpose for the Ten Generals' gathering this time.</p>

    <p>Given that he had become a True Venerated, there were already a lot of people in the outside world, especially abroad, who were denouncing Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>But the fact was that Lord Diulei's advancement hadn't violated the True Immortal Convention at all.</p>

    <p>"Then what is Senior Immortal's attitude toward this?" asked Explosion Saint, who was ranked first in terms of strength among the Ten Generals.</p>

    <p>"He has yet to issue a statement..." President Qi shook his head.</p>

    <p>"Perhaps this is a test?" Explosion Saint raised his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>"Given Senior Immortal's tolerant personality, he was so low-key before that even we were almost mistaken, but he chose to break through at the sect's founding ceremony. Personally, I think it was mainly because of us... If it wasn't because he acted to protect Blademaster and Battle Saint, I'm guessing Senior Immortal would have continued hiding his strength..." Explosion Saint sighed deeply. "I feel that we owe him a big favor!"</p>

    <p>"That's why even if Senior Immortal has yet to clarify his attitude, we still need to deal with it carefully." President Qi said, "In the future, we may need to seek help from Senior Immortal, so we have to settle this properly. Of course, there might be another reason why Senior Immortal hasn't replied: there were too many of us when we escorted King of Killers away yesterday, so Senior Immortal might have felt that we didn't give him face, and he's angry because of it..."</p>

    <p>"Angry? How can that be... This old man will ask him!"</p>

    <p>General Yi texted Lord Diulei: "Senior Immortal, are you angry?"</p>

    <p>After the dinner banquet yesterday, Lord Diulei had added the two of the Ten Generals, General Yi and Marshal Jiang, on WeChat.</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>When Lord Diulei received the text, he was feeling distressed over public opinion and comments on him in international news.</p>

    <p>He had been eating broccoli for so long, but who knew he would break through so abruptly yesterday...</p>

    <p>Angry?</p>

    <p>Reading General Yi's text, Lord Diulei felt slightly overwhelmed by favor when he replied, "Angry? No, no I'm not!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was still deeply respectful of the Ten Generals.</p>

    <p>After all, he was just a baby with just over two thousand years of cultivation...</p>

    <p>But the Ten Generals all had thousands of years of cultivation; they were seniors who far surpassed him, having weathered life's great storms and billows!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>While the Ten Generals were thinking of a way to handle the issue with Lord Diulei, and Lord Diulei was feeling distressed over the sect and the international news, there was another person who was feeling the same way, and that was Wang Zhen...</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch was preparing for the important final exams, so his questions for Wang Zhen had been put aside for the moment. All of Wang Zhen's strength was restricted. He was staying at Wei Zhi's place as he helped raise the animals and spent his days over and over breathing in the smell of cats and stroking them...</p>

    <p>But this couldn't calm Wang Zhen down.</p>

    <p>He genuinely believed he was by and large mistaken about the thief.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing was that the young miss of the Liu family was still in a coma...</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen's feelings were a little complicated at this thought.</p>

    <p>In fact, he hoped she would wake up, because if the Liu family knew that in order to find him in the world below, their darling daughter had hidden herself in a kun's belly to secretly follow him, and had fallen into a deep coma because of it, the Liu family would definitely skin him!</p>

    <p>Having said that, Wang Zhen also hoped this Miss Liu would calm down a little after she woke up...</p>

    <p>There could be no love between them!</p>

    <p>But why was this Miss Liu pursuing him so relentlessly?</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen had heard before in the world above that she had a crush on him, but he never expected her to be this obsessed.</p>

    <p>Wasn't he just handsome, strong, and rich?</p>

    <p>How was that his fault?</p>
