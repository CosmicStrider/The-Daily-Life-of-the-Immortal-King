  <h1>Chapter 1111 All of Headmaster Chen's Life Knowledge</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It could only be said that Headmaster Chen was indeed Headmaster Chen. As an expert who had already experienced so much, this almost prophetic analysis was naturally a piece of cake for him. Devil-Subduing and Titan joining forces — this was the worst situation Headmaster Chen could think of. If students from these two schools formed an alliance, tanks, control, and damage output — they would have all of this. The battle royale would then become meaningless, and ultimately nothing more than a showdown between these two schools.</p>

    <p>Thus, to stop the two schools from joining forces, Headmaster Chen's strategy for everyone was to start with the students from Titan High School.</p>

    <p>An important precondition for the formation of an alliance was that the students from both sides should be mutually friendly — as far as Headmaster Chen knew, these two schools had never had any sort of connection before this.</p>

    <p>But the current headmaster of Devil-Subduing High School, Li Qingxi, was sharp, and he would definitely have already thought of the optimal combo of Devil-Subduing and Titan. Headmaster Chen felt that the other party might currently be formulating a strategy to form a friendly alliance with Titan High School.</p>

    <p>All was fair in war; stirring up a ruckus might be a little shameless, but it was a stratagem used by military strategists.</p>

    <p>To prevent an alliance between the two schools, Headmaster Chen had come up with a meticulous plan.</p>

    <p>He waved his sleeve, and each person was given a storage pouch.</p>

    <p>When they opened their pouches for a look, they were immediately startled at the contents — because the pouches from Headmaster Chen were full to the brim with snacks! And most of them were desserts!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling instantly understood Headmaster Chen's intention.</p>

    <p>"Students who cultivate the Titan Arts need to gain weight, so all they have for lunch is food that's high in calories, like burgers, fried food and all kinds of soft drinks and snacks. Of all of these, desserts are their favorite. As long as you follow this dessert plan, you'll definitely be able to take Titan High School down! Also, each of your pouches contains a simple support spell which I've developed exclusively. It basically contains all my life knowledge..." When he said this, Headmaster Chen's eyes turned red as he almost moved himself to tears.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao, Guo Hao, Sun Rong, Xia Ming, and Xia Ming's classmate Li Youyue were pleasantly surprised.</p>

    <p>This support spell which Headmaster Chen had developed by combining all the wisdom he had acquired throughout his life... he was actually just passing it to them like that?</p>

    <p>Some of them were awe-stricken.</p>

    <p>They promptly flipped through the scroll that was in the pouch for a look.</p>

    <p>Well...</p>

    <p>The name of this spell was fairly plain... It was called Dessert...</p>

    <p>The theory behind it was also very simple; even the hand seal couldn't be any easier.</p>

    <p>Spell effect: Just make the hand seal in front of your target; your eyes must make contact as you're casting the spell. Once the spell is cast, the target will gradually feel like wanting to eat dessert and lose the will to fight. If dessert is offered to them at this moment, there is a high chance that you'll earn the target's goodwill.</p>

    <p>Duration of spell effect: Depending on the caster's realm, it can be as short as two minutes or as long as two days.</p>

    <p>Spell prohibition: Use is forbidden on diabetics and hyperglycemic patients.</p>

    <p>How to dispel the spell: Just cast the Dessert spell on the target again.</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Staring at these completely frank instructions, everyone in this special training class couldn't help but fall into deep thought.</p>

    <p>Was this... the so-called life knowledge that Headmaster Chen had?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's eyebrow twitched.</p>

    <p>On the contrary, he didn't look down on this spell.</p>

    <p>Instead, he thought that Headmaster Chen was a talent.</p>

    <p>Though the theory behind this spell was simple, it contained the essence of a Heavenly Dao spell which Wang Ling was very familiar with: the Great Taste Spell. It was a spell which could control a person's mind and thoughts, and stimulate their appetite and taste buds; it was far better than the Dessert spell, and could be regarded as a super upgraded version of Headmaster Chen's Dessert spell.</p>

    <p>But with his own strength, Headmaster Chen had managed to design a Dessert spell which operated along a similar line as the Great Taste Spell.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling couldn't help but admire Headmaster Chen a little.</p>

    <p>Whether or not it was a happy coincidence, or if he really had carefully pondered the theory behind Dessert, a spell which could hit the enemy where it hurt was an awesome one.</p>

    <p>But having said that, Wang Ling had actually put the Great Taste Spell on his list of useless spells; he felt that it was basically pointless since after cultivators reached a particular realm, most of them could control their appetites.</p>

    <p>Even the students from Titan High School pigged out on high-calorie foods every day, not because they had huge appetites, but purely because they needed it to cultivate the Titan Arts.</p>

    <p>It could only be said that Headmaster Chen had really forked out a fortune in order to disrupt a possible alliance between Titan High and Number 1 Devil-Subduing High.</p>

    <p>This Dessert spell which he had created aside, the snacks and desserts in the storage pouches alone would have cost a heck of a lot. Ordinary desserts and snacks definitely wouldn't win them over, so Headmaster Chen had prepared some top quality desserts which weren't available on the market.</p>

    <p>After drawing up this first plan, Headmaster Chen couldn't help but laugh in his heart.</p>

    <p>Old Li ah Old Li... let's see how you'll compete with me...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After coming up with this first plan to drive a wedge between the two schools, Headmaster Chen started to introduce everyone to the students of the next school: South Sea Sky High School.</p>

    <p>This was a high school whose students also wore a blue school uniform; the difference was that Number 60 High's school uniform was a deep blue to navy blue in color.</p>

    <p>South Sea Sky High School's uniform was sky blue with shades of white in it.</p>

    <p>Actually, there were times when you could tell what a cultivation school's study focus was from the design of their school uniform.</p>

    <p>"South Sea Sky High School's focus is nature studies."</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen said, "Students from South Sea Sky High School have very powerful perception and possess the ability to communicate with all creatures in nature. Since there are a lot of spirit plants and spirit beasts on Nine Dragon Mountain, they'll have an overwhelming advantage if they skillfully use their ability in such terrain. It's also because of this perception that it's very hard to track them; they can easily determine your location, while you might not be able to discover their tracks."</p>

    <p>"Then what should we do?"</p>

    <p>"There's no need to panic; I've already thought up a countermeasure." Saying this, Headmaster Chen waved his hand again, and gave each person a second brocade pouch. "We must use appropriate means in order to deal with the students from South Sea Sky High School. These brocade pouches contain a second support spell which I've designed. This spell is something which I developed exclusively, and it basically contains all my life knowledge..."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "???"</p>

    <p>These words, haven't they heard them before???</p>
