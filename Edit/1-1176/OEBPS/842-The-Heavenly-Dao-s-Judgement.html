  <h1>Chapter 842 The Heavenly Dao's Judgement</h1>

  <div>

    <p>There was a saying: <em>There is no order without rules </em>.</p>

    <p>During the Heavenly Dao Committee meeting, there was no order without the Divine Table. Wang Ling's wrath on the other side had scared even the Divine Table into fleeing, which was enough to show how serious this matter was. Sometimes there were two types of anger; after dealing with this white list big shot for so many years, the Heavenly Dao Committee could tentatively sum up his two types of anger as: anger from the bottom of his heart, and anger from the depths of his soul.</p>

    <p>His crispy noodle snacks being destroyed or squandered would cause the first kind of anger.</p>

    <p>But this time even the Divine Table had left; it was obvious that this situation was far more serious, and this was wrath from the depths of Wang Ling's soul.</p>

    <p>"This person has already aroused public anger, which is why the wrath this time is so strong. Fellow Daoist Wang is simply serving as a bridge to direct the ire against that man here." Spirit Heavenly Dao heaved a sigh. "I just never expected this: how has this type of person who has sparked public rage gotten away without being judged for so long?"</p>

    <p>"I checked it out," Life And Death Heavenly Dao said at that moment. "There are records which show that the first ancestor of the Yang family, Yang Wude, once activated the Heavenly Dao Equivalent Exchange Array. This person offered the Heavenly Dao a rare treasure, the skull from an overlord's tomb, in exchange for the Yang family descendants being exempted from the judgement of the power of Heavenly Dao."</p>

    <p>The other Heavenly Dao were startled. "There was something like this?"</p>

    <p>Life And Death Heavenly Dao: "We've already examined the inscription on the Heavenly Dao Tablet, and this indeed is the case. But Yang Wude's descendants have been too wicked; in the thirty-sixth generation, the Yang family descendant was once beaten up by one of Dao Ancestor Wang's grandsons, and everyone should know who this person is."</p>

    <p>"Could it be Wang Zhen, whose strength has already been sealed?"</p>

    <p>"That's right, it's him."</p>

    <p>Strength Heavenly Dao was relieved. "It looks like this incident crippled the connection between the Yang family and Heavenly Dao. The agreement from back then held until the thirty-sixth generation, when the Wang family became involved... No wonder the strength of the agreement weakened, and the wrath in Fellow Daoist Wang Ling's soul was able to reach us... What does everyone think about this matter? How should we deal with this Yang Huai?"</p>

    <p>The other Heavenly Dao said in unison: "What is there to think about? I've been bearing with him for so long!"</p>

    <p>Strength Heavenly Dao said coldly, "I want him to lose all his strength so that he can only watch helplessly as his muscles atrophy bit by bit every day until he finally ends up a dwarf forever."</p>

    <p>Life And Death Heavenly Dao: "Sir Strength's punishment isn't vicious enough. I want him to live on in suffering - unless he acknowledges his sins, he won't be able to die, no matter how much he tries."</p>

    <p>Space Heavenly Dao: "Sir Strength's and Sir Life And Death's methods are too mild. But along with Sir Life And Death's method, I can release space worms which will constantly gnaw on his guts; since he can't die, he can experience all the pain to the full."</p>

    <p>Spirit Heavenly Dao: "Since it's like that, then I can control his mind. Whether he's awake or dreaming, he'll hallucinate being struck by electricity. Every single person who was ruined by the Yang family since Yang Wude's generation will constantly cycle through this dreams."</p>

    <p>Time Heavenly Dao: "Each and everyone of you are Heavenly Dao, how can you be so evil? Are you all devils?"</p>

    <p>The rest of the Heavenly Dao: "???"</p>

    <p>Time Heavenly Dao: "If it's me, I'll get Sir Soul to help me split Yang Huai's soul in two and have Sir Life And Death create a new body for one half. Then, I'll use the power of time to send Yang Huai back to Yang Wude's generation for the latter to personally torture him! Hia hia hia..."</p>

    <p>A key issue suddenly occurred to Life And Death Heavenly Dao. "Be that as it may, the power of the agreement still exists. Wouldn't this be breaking the rules?"</p>

    <p>Strength Heavenly Dao: "A white list client has the prerogative over all the rules. I don't know if all of you remember what Dao Founder said back then, but if there is conflict between the rules and a white list client, no matter how strict the rules are or whatever precious treasure was received, we must prioritize the white list client, even if he is a PY person <sup>1</sup> . Even if our integrity crumbles under the rules or our honor is tarnished, this is the essence of the Heavenly Dao white list!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(PY is the pinyin for the
Chinese word for "asshole,"
and implies shady dealings ..)</dfn>

    <p>After saying this, Strength Heavenly Dao waved his hand, and an image of Yang Huai on Earth instantly appeared.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Ling and Yang Huai were still locked in a confrontation. Yang Huai had grabbed that young man by the neck with his Eagle Claw Technique, and the latter's face was already turning a little blue.</p>

    <p>Spirit Heavenly Dao: "Since this is the case, before the Heavenly Dao punishment is carried out for real, shall we take action together, and give this Yang Huai a small taste first?"</p>

    <p>"Sounds good."</p>

    <p>Time Heavenly Dao chuckled. "Yang Huai this small fry has the guts to provoke the white list client - it looks like he's tired of living! No one can offend the white list client! No matter how majestic his position is down below, he needs to be squashed to death!"</p>

    <p>Soul Heavenly Dao: "How are we going to do this? Sir Strength, can you hit Yang Huai down below with something, at this distance?"</p>

    <p>Life And Death Heavenly Dao: "Yang Huai is holding an innocent young man hostage, so it might be difficult for Sir Strength to do anything; this Heavenly Dao is too powerful that the young man might also be affected."</p>

    <p>Strength Heavenly Dao laughed. "What a joke! I've fought tens of thousands of battles, great and small; I've long mastered the skill of a precise strike! Is Sir Life And Death actually looking down on me? Didn't you complain to Dao Founder about me before?"</p>

    <p>Life And Death Heavenly Dao broke out in a sweat. "What are you saying, Sir Strength..."</p>

    <p>Strength Heavenly Dao: "Forget it... Let's work together now and first teach this evil creature below an important lesson."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, Wang Ling had already thought up ten thousand ways to deal with Yang Huai and save the young man, and at the same time make Yang Huai suffer before he was ultimately punished by the law. Wang Ling would save the young man first and restrain Yang Huai. He would then call Zhuo Yi to come and cart Yang Huai off to prison, and have Zhuo Yi come up with ten thousand ways to punish Yang Huai!</p>

    <p>Hm...</p>

    <p>It was a perfect plan!</p>

    <p>Just as Wang Ling was pondering how to act, he heard a sudden clap of thunder in the sky.</p>

    <p>The next moment, a pair of giant hands with talisman symbols and strange runes all over them suddenly emerged from the ground to directly envelop Yang Huai! He found himself unable to move, and his body started to lose strength, as if all his bone cartilage had turned soft.</p>

    <p>Sensing the difference in Yang Huai, the young man he had seized hurriedly pushed him away.</p>

    <p>Lying limp on the ground in that moment, what Yang Huai faced next was Strength Heavenly Dao's first attack, which was also the most brutal punishment â€” tickling the soles of Yang Huai's feet...</p>
