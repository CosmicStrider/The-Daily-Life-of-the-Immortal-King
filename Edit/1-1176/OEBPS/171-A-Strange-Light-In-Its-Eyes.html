  <h1>Chapter 171 A Strange Light In Its Eyes </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Because of Jiang Liuyue's threat, the bombardment stopped.</p>

    <p>"Didn't I say to defend your positions with the cannons? Who was it who ran up to the peak?!" Zheng Tan had never thought that its plan would actually go wrong here. It grabbed the telescope and swiftly scanned the peak. "Let me see who that son of a bitch is..."</p>

    <p>Then, Zheng Tan saw the snowy-white figure in the woman's arms.</p>

    <p>Immortal... Meow?</p>

    <p>This time, Zheng Tan was stupefied.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When Jiang Liuyue had caught Wang Ling, he had still been searching for Zheng Tan's aura. Finally, he realized that clever little Zheng Tan was still at the foot of the hill. Wang Ling immediately breathed a sigh of relief in his heart. At the same time, he felt a sense of admiration for the way Zheng Tan had led its troops.</p>

    <p>Directing tens of thousands of cats in battle, Zheng Tan had managed to achieve zero casualties. Furthermore, this group of Shadow Stream killers had been forced to hole up at the top of the hill due to the fierce Yidali Cannon bombardment by Zheng Tan's Independent Regiment, and they didn't dare come down at all.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling realized that he had been worried for nothing...</p>

    <p>Zheng Tan was maturing much faster than he had imagined!</p>

    <p>Turning his head to look at the woman clasping him to her chest, Wang Ling knew that this person was the legendary Master of Shadow Stream.</p>

    <p>Strangely, however, Wang Ling could sense that the other party's aura was very weak.</p>

    <p>From the rumors, the real Master of Shadow Stream should be at the Soul Formation stage at the very least.</p>

    <p>Suspicious, Wang Ling opened his Heavenly Eye, and as he had expected, this Master of Shadow Stream wasn't real. Or to put it another way, this wasn't her real body at all â€” it was just a clay clone which she had shaped with spirit energy.</p>

    <p>Compared with Wang Ling's Great Separation Spell, a clay clone shaped with spirit energy had a more stable composition, so there was no need to worry that it would disappear. But its drawback was that it had to be near the real body in order to be reabsorbed. If the clone was damaged when it was outside, the real body's realm would also be set back.</p>

    <p>No wonder this woman had camped out on the top of the hill and hadn't dared to come down. If this had been the Master of Shadow Stream's real body, Zheng Tan's Yidali Cannon probably wouldn't have been able to do anything to her.</p>

    <p>What a devious woman, to actually create this type of "insurance" in order not to expose her real body.</p>

    <p>It only could be said that the real Master of Shadow Stream Jiang Liuyue was much more vigilant than the common people had imagined. But despite that, there was one thing that was impossible for her to guard against.</p>

    <p>That was Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"This bunch of damn cats... wait 'til my Shadow Stream reinforcements arrive, all of you will die!" Jiang Liuyue squeezed Wang Ling tight as she spoke in a low, cold voice.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared indifferently at her. Although she was clutching him so tightly, it wasn't really painful. It was just that the position was a little weird, because the two globes behind him made him feel like he was leaning against a sofa...</p>

    <p>Of course, he wasn't that vulgar, and this well-proportioned type wasn't his cup of tea.</p>

    <p>So, when the woman held him aloft as a hostage, Wang Ling twisted his body lightly and broke free of her hold.</p>

    <p>"Damn it!" Jiang Liuyue hadn't expected this snowy-white Persian cat to be so strong. She hurriedly stretched out her hands to grab it, only to brush Wang Ling's soft cat tail as this Persian cat floated in midair and looked down on her.</p>

    <p>It wasn't until then that Jiang Liuyue realized that this cat wasn't that simple.</p>

    <p>Sure enough... it had suddenly appeared out of nowhere on the hilltop. Had it used some sort of magic treasure to teleport here?</p>

    <p>"Who the hell are you..." She looked at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>And then, the answer she got... was immense spiritual pressure which poured over her like a flood!</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue saw a strange light in this white Persian cat's eyes!</p>

    <p>It wasn't just her; all the Shadow Stream killers on the hilltop were completely unable to move!</p>

    <p>Whether it was Jiang Liuyue or Mo Li, all of them felt as if their blood had frozen; they were completely rigid and unable to make a single move.</p>

    <p>These immobilized Shadow Stream killers were all fearful; given the situation, they couldn't cast any spells, which meant that the barrier would collapse under the artillery barrage!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling gazed down the hill to where Zheng Tan was holding up its telescope, waiting for his command.</p>

    <p>He nodded from afar!</p>

    <p>In the next moment, Zheng Tan roared for everyone to open fire!</p>

    <p>Boom boom boom boom ...</p>

    <p>The hilltop was instantly covered in a huge mushroom cloud.</p>

    <p>This series of explosions continued for five minutes before subsiding. After the smoke settled, all the Shadow Stream killers lay paralyzed on the ground in all kinds of bizarre postures, burnt like coal; although the shellfire from the Yidali Cannons had been fierce, it hadn't completely killed them. Wang Ling had stood amidst the shellfire wrapped in a protective aura, and then had wandered leisurely through as if no one else was here.</p>

    <p>If this was a game, you could probably see a bunch of 'MISS' words above his head.</p>

    <p>He had already calculated the power of the shellfire; it could only deal this bunch of people serious injuries at the most.</p>

    <p>It was good enough to deprive them of the ability to move. As for the rest... as usual, just hand them all over to the state!</p>

    <p>When Zheng Tan went up the hill with its chief of staff, The Monk, and the second battalion commander, all the cats saw this usually ferocious commander of the Independent Regiment, who always acted like an uncontrollable wild cat, fall wailing into Wang Ling's arms.</p>

    <p>The Monk covered its face as it suddenly felt a little ashamed. "..." You have to keep your cool, Regiment Commander!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>It was Zheng Tan's second time seeing the immortal cat, so it went without saying that it was very excited.</p>

    <p>After it had calmed down and finally regained its composure, it ordered the handful of cats behind it, "You guys, search inside..."</p>

    <p>The entrance to Shadow Stream's headquarters on the hilltop was actually pretty well-hidden in a well. But now that all of Shadow Stream's people had lost their ability to move, the cats of the Independent Regiment didn't face any resistance at all as they moved in.</p>

    <p>Looking around, Wang Ling confirmed that all the Shadow Stream killers were down.</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue's clay clone had been smashed in the explosion, and only half a face remained.</p>

    <p>What was more, that half-face also looked like scorched earth.</p>

    <p>She glared resentfully at Wang Ling with extreme hatred; unexpectedly, she could still talk. "Who on earth are you...?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't say anything, and only did some probing with his spiritual senses. He wanted to use his memory retrieval spell to search Jiang Liuyue's mind for any valuable information. But unfortunately, her brain was empty.</p>

    <p>Of course, he still had to find the real body, since the memory retrieval spell was of no use on a clay clone.</p>

    <p>Since it didn't have any valuable information, this clay clone was worthless to him.</p>

    <p>He opened his eyes, and a spirit light shot forth from them to straightaway destroy the final half of this woman's face.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, in a completely sealed-off basement in Jinghua city.</p>

    <p>A woman who had been sitting with her legs crossed and her eyes closed, choked and coughed up a mouthful of blood...</p>
