  <h1>Chapter 111 Don't Lose to the Storm of First Love! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling felt a little "fear" for the first time in his life as he looked at the beauty standing in front of him. There was no way anyone would realize that this beauty with beautiful hair and fair skin without the least hint of wrinkles was Teacher Pan, the fucking same person!</p>

    <p>So... did that Teacher Pan with the near-bucket waist figure and grey-streaked ponytail take leave today because of her period or something?</p>

    <p>He was a little stunned as he stared at this devastatingly gorgeous Teacher Pan — it felt like being unable to recover from watching a horror film.</p>

    <p>Even if this was just like putting on makeup, how could it transform her to this extent?!</p>

    <p>Looking at Teacher Pan, he suddenly remembered the three great witchcraft spells that were desperately sought after now by all female cultivators: plastic surgery, Photoshop and makeup cosmetics...</p>

    <p>"What foolishness are you thinking about, Student Wang Ling?" Seeing this perpetually poker-faced student reveal a rare, surprised expression, Teacher Pan smiled, pleased. "School regulations forbid teachers from using heavy makeup or taking medication such as youth-retaining elixirs. But we're not in school now, and I ate a quick-acting youth-retaining elixir when I set out this morning. Please make sure you don't tell the other students, Student Wang Ling!"</p>

    <p>Hearing her explanation, Wang Ling instantly understood.</p>

    <p>This kind of quick-acting youth-retaining elixir sold on the market only worked for twenty-four hours before its effect disappeared. After ingesting the elixir, a person's skin would immediately be drawn up and become tighter; the body would become younger and radiant as a person returned to what they looked like at the age of eighteen.</p>

    <p>After taking the quick-acting youth-retaining elixir, the Teacher Pan in front of him was actually Teacher Pan when she had been eighteen years old.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling really never expected her to be so beautiful in her youth!</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan came in and put on a pair of slippers before she sized up the Wang family's small villa. She frowned imperceptibly when she realized that there was no spirit energy in the house. Many parents nowadays would set up spirit gathering arrays in their homes so that their children could sleep well and cultivate regularly.</p>

    <p>Generally, the spirit gathering array which a student used would be fairly small and quite cheap; Teacher Pan had completely never expected the Wang family to be so poor that they couldn't even lay down a single spirit gathering array. Student Wang Ling had actually grown up in this kind of environment, without a spirit gathering array, and had cultivated step by step to reach the Foundation Establishment stage?</p>

    <p>To cultivate to the Foundation Establishment stage by sheer talent alone without any sort of supplementary resources had to have been incredibly hard.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan looked at Wang Ling with some pity and felt that this child was too unfortunate.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>When she walked into the living room, Grandfather Wang instantly stood up from the sofa; when their eyes met, they were both startled.</p>

    <p>Grandfather Wang was taken aback because he hadn't expected Teacher Pan Shengcong to still be as young as before, after so many years.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan was taken aback because she felt that the old man in front of her seemed familiar for some reason, but she just couldn't think who on earth he could be.</p>

    <p>On the side, Wang Ling read her thoughts. It was very obvious that she already no longer remembered much of Grandfather Wang.</p>

    <p>After all, so many years had already passed.</p>

    <p>The most important thing, moreover, was that Grandfather Wang's love had been unrequited. Wang Ling had never experienced the pain of unrequited love for himself; at that moment, Grandfather Wang was perhaps the only person who could truly understand the feeling.</p>

    <p>Both individuals looked at each other for a long time, and seeing that Teacher Pan still hadn't recognized him after that, Grandfather Wang felt a little depressed and sighed in his heart: I'm old, after all... I'm no longer the same as back then.</p>

    <p>In between the gazes of these two people, Wang Ling also perceived the unbridgeable gap between cultivators and ordinary men.</p>

    <p>A person could retain their appearance by cultivating or taking elixirs. The full strength and effects of a youth-retaining elixir could only be brought out by using spirit energy to completely absorb it into the body. On the other hand, no matter how many youth-retaining elixirs an ordinary person took, in the end they would still slowly grow old because they lacked spirit energy.</p>

    <p>Tragic?</p>

    <p>Maybe a little.</p>

    <p>But that was the reality.</p>

    <p>Grandfather Wang was a fairly sanguine person and wouldn't fret over something like this. He gestured to Teacher Pan to sit down and served her a cup of black tea. "Please sit down and have some tea, Teacher Pan."</p>

    <p>"Hello, sir, you are..." She frowned.</p>

    <p>"Oh, I'm Wang Ling's grandfather. Ling Ling's parents have an urgent matter to attend to today, so it was left to me to meet you, Teacher Pan."</p>

    <p>"Ah, I see."</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan understood the situation and smiled. "It's not a problem, this home visit was also a spur-of-the-moment decision on my part."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that except for her voice, Teacher Pan seemed to have gotten younger in almost all other aspects — even her attitude was completely different from the typical Teacher Pan in the classroom, and instead was especially gentle and kind.</p>

    <p>"It's fine, Teacher Pan." The old man smiled brightly.</p>

    <p>"Then, sir, how should I address you? Mr Wang or Grandfather Wang?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Grandfather Wang felt depressed once again. "..."</p>

    <p>It was very clear that the feeling of being called "grandfather" by his first love wasn't something that Grandfather Wang had ever wanted to know or experience.</p>

    <p>Quickly calming his chaotic thoughts, the old man replied, "Call me Mr Wang..."</p>

    <p>"Mm, very well, Mr Wang."</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan laughed so sweetly that Wang Ling felt that if she had been holding a cup of milk tea in her hand, she would be on par with the Internet celebrity Milk Tea Sister <sup>1</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>("Milk Tea Sister" is a nickname for Zhang Zetian, a Chinese businesswoman and investor who initially gained Internet fame from a popular photograph of her holding milk tea ..)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling sat opposite them and listened as they exchanged a few polite words before they started to talk about him.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling this child is usually quiet in school, and I assumed this was largely because of the family atmosphere at home. But from my home visit this time, I find that Mr Wang has a very youthful attitude."</p>

    <p>The old man scratched his bald head in embarrassment. "This boy is actually warmhearted, like his parents, and is an accommodating and good kid. Once you become familiar with him, you'll find that he has his unique qualities. Ordinarily, however, he always has this poker face — he's been like this since young, and he can't change it. Our family's given this frozen face of his a name, the 'cold to family syndrome.' Please don't mind it, Teacher Pan."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan covered her mouth and laughed. "Mr Wang, you really have such a sense of humor! I have a question I would like to ask you."</p>

    <p>The old man: "What is it?"</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan: "Mr Wang, what month was Student Wang Ling born in?"</p>

    <p>The old man promptly replied, "In December, on the 26th."</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan stared at Wang Ling, then shook her head with a sigh. "No wonder..."</p>

    <p>The old man: "Is there something wrong, Teacher Pan?"</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan: "It's nothing, I just realized that it turns out Student Wang Ling is a Capricorn."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
