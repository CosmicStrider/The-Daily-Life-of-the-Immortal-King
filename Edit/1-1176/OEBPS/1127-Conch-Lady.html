  <h1>Chapter 1127 Conch Lady</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Like Sun Rong said, there were a lot of businesses under Huaguo Water Curtain Group. Its main business was pills and medicine, but thanks to abundant profits and the company's renowned influence in the pills and medicine industry, Huaguo Water Curtain Group used this fortune to quickly expand into various other fields: film and television, e-sports, food, shopping malls... Huaguo Water Curtain Group's fingers could be seen in practically every popular pie.</p>

    <p>This "Conch Lady" seafood restaurant chain, for example, was in fact owned by Huaguo Water Curtain Group, but many people didn't know this.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong wanted to eat with the others in a neutral setting. She had relaxed a little when Headmaster Chen gave them the money for food, but why had things turned out like this?</p>

    <p>"Classmate Sun Rong, you don't look very good." Li Youyue asked, "Is it because you can't eat seafood?"</p>

    <p>"No, I'm fine..." Sun Rong quickly shook her head. She then silently took out her phone and sent a message to the driver, who was waiting outside the school gate, to let Conch Lady know in advance.</p>

    <p>Outside the school gate, the driver saw the message and was confused, because Sun Rong just said, "Inform Conch Lady on XXX Road."</p>

    <p>She didn't say exactly what to tell them!</p>

    <p>And the point was that Conch Lady was inside Huaguo Water Curtain Group's Huaguo Shopping Mall; there was practically no shop there that didn't know Sun Rong... Was there any need to inform them?</p>

    <p>The driver looked at his phone and frowned. Although he was a little perplexed, this was the Eldest Miss's request, after all, and the driver didn't dare disobey it.</p>

    <p>He immediately followed Sun Rong's instruction, and had the nearby bodyguards retreat three kilometers to follow her at a distance while he drove the car to that particular Conch Lady restaurant to let them know.</p>

    <p>When everyone exited the classroom, Sun Rong inwardly sighed with relief when she saw that the bodyguards who had initially been standing guard outside had retreated.</p>

    <p>"How are we going to get there?" Chen Chao asked.</p>

    <p>"Fly our swords; the competition is coming up, so we should grab every chance to build up our stamina. Besides, flying a sword consumes a lot of energy, so we'll enjoy the food more later," Guo Hao suggested. Stamina had always been his weak point, and this was a good opportunity to work out - a short cram session like this was also good.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong nodded. "I agree."</p>

    <p>Everyone was actually surprised at Sun Rong's agreement; their impression of her was that she was a different sort to them. Usually, there would be a black limo waiting for her outside the school gate after school.</p>

    <p>Since she had agreed, naturally, no one else would refuse.</p>

    <p>"Then let's fly our swords together; it'll be better that way. Who'll lead?" Everyone took out their spirit swords. Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi also took out the spirit swords which Lord Diulei had given to them. Heavenly Dao had blocked their use of magic treasures, and they were also forbidden to use their own spirit swords. However, it was difficult for a cultivator to move around without a spirit sword.</p>

    <p>For the time being, Lord Diulei had given them a compatible spirit sword each. The condition, however, was that after they were done helping Wei Zhi and had spare time on their hands, they had to go and help the Office of Strategic Deception deal with some client requests, like hunting down wanted criminals of the Dark Network and so on.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that in some sense, Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi were pretty pitiful.</p>

    <p>They could have become a loving couple in the world above. In the end, thanks to a freak combination of factors, they both wound up in the world below while running away from the marriage arrangement, and were punished by Heavenly Dao... Not only couldn't they return home, this young master and young miss had to work in order to survive here.</p>

    <p>How tragic...</p>

    <p>Everyone had decided to fly their swords, and Wang Ling naturally didn't have any objections. Flying a sword used up a lot of stamina and mental focus; they had to concentrate during the process, or it would be very easy for them to slip and fall in midair.</p>

    <p>There would usually be someone who would lead the group, and currently, it seemed only Sun Rong could take up this role.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Wang Zhen, Liu Qingyi, Zhenyuan, and Gu Shunzhi had to hide their strength. The only person here who had a sword spirit was Sun Rong. One of the great advantages of a spirit sword which had spawned a sword spirit was that it had an "autopilot" mode, where the sword spirit could fly the spirit sword on its own, and thus share its master's mental burden.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, if the team flew in a sword formation, the sword spirit in the lead could share part of the mental burden of each team member, which was the reason why many people liked flying swords in a group.</p>

    <p>This could be considered one of the very few times Wang Ling was eating out. Moreover, it was with his classmates. On the entire journey, Sun Rong's Mysterious Sea felt the pressure behind him...</p>

    <p>Mysterious Sea was well aware that this pressure was coming from Wang Ling's Jingke.</p>

    <p>Fuck... She was a small sword spirit. As the bro leading the team while being stared by the boss of sword spirits, the pressure was freaking insane!</p>

    <p>But Mysterious Sea didn't dare ask or say anything.</p>

    <p>She didn't know what the boss's character was like, but everyone knew that a sword took after its master, and Mysterious Sea was afraid Jingke would kill her...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was about an hour before they finally arrived at the commercial plaza, which had a designated zone for getting off flying swords.</p>

    <p>Everyone landed, and Guo Hao began to pant heavily. "Fuck! I swear I'll never fly so far in one go ever again! I felt like I was dying! I'd rather do workbook exercises for an hour!"</p>

    <p>"Your stamina is terrible... don't hold us back in the body technique competition, boss!" As soon as Chen Chao said the words, Guo Hao instantly tensed up and inwardly cursed Chen Chao's jinx of a mouth. Everyone else had already hurried on ahead to the mall.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong quietly sighed with relief when they reached the mall's main entrance. It looked like her driver had already let them know beforehand... Everything was going according to plan.</p>

    <p>On the way to the Conch Lady restaurant, she kept encouraging herself.</p>

    <p>She was just a very ordinary student today. She didn't need special treatment or anything like that at all. She just wanted to be like everyone else.</p>

    <p>But as they made their way to the restaurant, she noticed that everyone in the mall was giving her strange looks, and she slowly started to get a bad feeling...</p>

    <p>It couldn't be, right...</p>

    <p>Old Li had been her driver for so long, and should know her thoughts; he couldn't possibly have misunderstood her. Sun Rong checked the message she sent him, but when she saw the content, she almost spat out a mouthful of blood! She had been so nervous at the time, and had only told Old Li to let them know, but not about what... It would indeed be very easy for Old Li to misunderstand this message!</p>

    <p>By the time Sun Rong brought everyone to the Conch Lady restaurant, it was already too late.</p>

    <p>When the restaurant manager and staff saw Sun Rong, they all came out with smiles all over their faces and respectfully stood in a row.</p>

    <p>Then, the manager stepped forward and bowed deeply. "Eldest Miss! All the staff are in position; we await your inspection!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>
