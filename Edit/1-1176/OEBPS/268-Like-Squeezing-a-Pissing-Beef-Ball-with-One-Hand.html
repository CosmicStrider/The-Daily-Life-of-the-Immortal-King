  <h1>Chapter 268 Like Squeezing a Pissing Beef Ball with One Hand </h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Death Announcement? What's that?" Lord Diulei thought the name sounded a little familiar.</p>

    <p>"This is a more well-known modern type of magic treasure, shaped like a keyboard..." Luo Chuang seemed to have heard of it. "It appears that you can upgrade your rage numbers by continuously hitting and breaking things."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling already had no energy left to mock this plot with the woman and her husband.</p>

    <p>However, no matter how the game's plot unfolded, before the game's deity lord revealed his true nature, there was no way for Wang Ling to directly track down the deity lord's original body when the other party was still just game data. At this time, he suddenly thought of the advantages of having Little Black around. It would have been great if Little Black were here; that way, they could coordinate inside and outside the game to capture the deity lord.</p>

    <p>But now, the only way was to wait for the deity lord to get impatient and betray himself first.</p>

    <p>After Lie Mengmeng picked up the night vision camera, the power was directly cut off throughout the entire asylum. Whether it was the rooms or corridors, everything was pitch-dark. Even if Lie Mengmeng was a veteran player in the world of damn otakus, he still couldn't help the few drops of cold sweat that formed on his skin. "Tch... it's a little creepy!"</p>

    <p>"Brother Luo, can you sense anyone else?" Lord Diulei asked.</p>

    <p>"Not at the moment." Luo Chuang frowned. "I suspect that we entered a different game space to everyone else. Although we don't know what the mastermind behind all this wants, to be able to set such a large trap, his strength definitely isn't simple."</p>

    <p>"What should we do next?"</p>

    <p>"The trial version I played before ended here. According to the script, we have to explore the rest of this place with the night vision camera, and look for clues in order for the next part of the plot to unfold. The evaluation report also specially mentioned the ward which that madwoman's husband was in; I think we can go check that out."</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng sorted out his thoughts and said, "...From the trailer I watched, it seems like there'll be zombies everywhere now that we've obtained the night vision camera. There'll be some metal cabinets and oil drums scattered throughout the game, and it would be best to hide in them when we run into zombies."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Still want to hide? It's better to kill them directly!"</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng: "...You can try."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Just like Lie Mengmeng had said, Escape had indeed arranged to use some zombies to hinder plot development.</p>

    <p>The weakest were the minions with normal physiques, like the madwoman earlier; one level above them were the zombies whose bodies had already completely mutated into obese shapes, commonly known as the fatties; the final level were the lizard people, the type of zombies that could crawl rapidly on the walls. In the trial version, the players had also called them "Voldemorts"...</p>

    <p>Holding the night vision camera, Lie Mengmeng walked down the corridor until he saw a metal cabinet, then stopped.</p>

    <p>"Be careful, there's something up ahead..."</p>

    <p>Although he was only a normal person, he had pretty sharp observation skills; when he saw this metal cabinet set up here for this scene, he immediately knew that the road ahead wasn't very likely to be peaceful.</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling had already sensed from afar that there were ten-odd "minions" in several of the rooms which lay ahead of the metal cabinet on the right side of the corridor; as soon as their group passed them, they would instantly rush out.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei said lightly, "Brother Song, don't be afraid. I'll go and take a look."</p>

    <p>He had barely stepped past the metal cabinet on the side when a mass of bodies burst out of the rooms, staggering toward them.</p>

    <p>"Oh my god! So many! Should we hide in the cabinet? We should definitely hide in the cabinet, right?" This scene gave Lie Mengmeng a fright.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, the shock of seeing a bunch of zombies rush at you on screen was completely different to seeing them advance on you in real life!</p>

    <p>"Brother Song, don't panic. Watch me kill them straightaway!"</p>

    <p>" Boom! "</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei flung a Skybomb Grenade at this group of zombies. Instantly the scene was enveloped in golden thunder and lightning as the horde of zombies exploded. But while they were badly mutilated, not all of them died, and those whose heads were still intact crawled forward on their arms inch by inch in the group's direction.</p>

    <p>Even if they were just minions, their resilience was amazing. As long as their brains were intact, their bodies would be able to regenerate constantly. Before those zombies missing their lower torsos had crawled half a meter over, their new bodies had already started to come together.</p>

    <p>Without saying a word, Lord Diulei directly strode forward and with a swipe of his sword, cut off the heads of these remaining minions.</p>

    <p>"Sure enough, if we want to defeat these things, we have to cut off their heads?" Luo Chuang smiled slightly before also joining the fight. He was more aggressive than Thunder, and stretching out one hand to grab hold of a minion's head, he squeezed it until it burst directly.</p>

    <p>A smith's average realm actually wasn't high; it could be said that there were a very rare few like Luo Chuang who could balance their realm and cultivation, so there were very few smiths who had the ability to protect themselves in difficult situations like this.</p>

    <p>As Wang Ling and Lie Mengmeng watched from a distance, the heads of these minions looked extremely fragile in Luo Chuang's hand, as if he was squeezing pissing beef balls <sup>1</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The name of a dish from the Stephen Chow film 'God of Cookery .. ')</dfn>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Because of Lord Diulei's Skybomb Grenade earlier, nearby zombies and minions also showed up after hearing the noise, and their numbers started to grow.</p>

    <p>"It appears these are enhanced zombies, they regenerate very quickly!" After a period of carnage, both Lord Diulei and Luo Chuang were starting to pant as they discovered a very serious problem! In this game space, combined with the illusion spell, their spirit energy wasn't being replenished!</p>

    <p>They had been using spirit energy all this time, and without a way to replenish it, it would be exhausted sooner or later.</p>

    <p>Because of the lack of spirit energy, Luo Chuang was obviously starting to feel a little weak... Suddenly, there was the sound of a massive shake up in front, and a figure swiftly approached them.</p>

    <p>"A big one's coming!" Luo Chuang widened his eyes in disbelief.</p>

    <p>It was a Voldemort, and its speed was awe-inspiring! Luo Chuang's eyes couldn't catch its movements at all!</p>

    <p>Although he didn't know yet what this Voldemort's strength was like, based on its speed alone, its level was already above the Soul Formation stage.</p>

    <p>After all, this was an illusion created by an Almighty at Itinerant Immortal level. This was an even trickier situation than Lord Diulei had imagined.</p>

    <p>"How about we hide in the cabinet..." Lie Mengmeng proposed once again.</p>

    <p>But before he finished speaking, Wang Ling had already moved forward.</p>

    <p>This Voldemort advanced on four brawny limbs, the tendons in its arms and legs as solid as qiulong . Its eyes had already become completely deformed, the corners completely torn apart to expose their whites, and its dark red pupils were fixed on Wang Ling as Wang Ling moved forward.</p>

    <p>After a few seconds...</p>

    <p>This Voldemort immediately started sweating like a fountain.</p>

    <p>Then, it directly turned around, opened the metal cabinet behind it, and straightaway hid inside.</p>

    <p>"???" When Lie Mengmeng saw this, the "black question mark" meme flashed through his mind.</p>

    <p>Based on the mechanics of gameplay, shouldn't they be the ones to hide in the cabinet?</p>

    <p>What kind of play was this?</p>
