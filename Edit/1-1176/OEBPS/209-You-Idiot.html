  <h1>Chapter 209 You Idiot! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>The instant Immortal Toya saw Wang Ling, his mind went blank. It was fortunate that he didn't have a habit of falling over, otherwise this old stone sculpture which had stood at Number 60 High School's front gate for a thousand years would have completely collapsed. Worse still, everything within a radius of dozens of li around Number 60 High School would have been affected by the tremors.</p>

    <p>A Soul Formation cultivator taking a fall was truly that terrifying...</p>

    <p>But Immortal Toya quickly recalled that Lord Diulei had told him before that Senior Ling was currently studying in a high school for the presumed purpose of experiencing life... it was just that this young man had completely never expected that Senior Ling would choose such an ordinary-looking high school which wasn't even a key high school.</p>

    <p>But when all was said and done, a big shot was a big shot, and ordinary people were utterly incapable of understanding such a person's thoughts.</p>

    <p>Perhaps this was the gap between Senior Ling and him...</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya sighed silently in his heart.</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen had been waiting for a long time at the main entrance of the school building. Seeing that Immortal Toya had suddenly paused at the student queue, he hurriedly came down the stairs to greet him. "Immortal, is something the matter?"</p>

    <p>When he heard Headmaster Chen's question, the young man with gray hair instantly returned to his senses. He immediately shook his head when he saw the headmaster looking at him doubtfully. "Oh, I'm alright, I was just reminded of my past..."</p>

    <p>It was naturally impossible for him to expose Senior Ling.</p>

    <p>Needless to say, Immortal Toya had quick reactions; to say such nostalgic words in a place like a school really fit the scene.</p>

    <p>There were many old cultivators who couldn't even find their alma maters anymore; after the founding of Huaxiu nation, most of those sects which had been set up by itinerant cultivators had been disbanded; only a very few had obtained government permits to operate, and they had been incorporated into the light forces.</p>

    <p>Therefore, even if it wasn't because of Wang Ling, the young man's heart was actually rather moved.</p>

    <p>After all, Number 60 High School was already a thousand years old.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At eight o'clock in the morning, a fleet of buses set off from Number 60 High School on time.</p>

    <p>On the road, Su Xiao asked a very practical question: how was the equipment distributed on the map during the survival drill this time?</p>

    <p>During the previous spirit sword exchange meet between Number 59 High School and Number 60 High School, it was General Yi who had put together the equipment which everyone had used.</p>

    <p>It was a good question which Lao Gudong had initially planned to address once they arrived at their destination, but since someone had brought it up now, there was no harm in explaining it on the way.</p>

    <p>"The magic treasures scattered on the map for the survival drill this time were also all produced by General Yi, but these are genuine articles. Because of this combined military training between six schools, plus this survival drill pilot program, General Yi started looking for specialists three months ago to create a batch of magic treasures. Since the map is larger this time, there will be tens of thousands of custom-made magic treasures," Lao Gudong explained.</p>

    <p>"Tens of thousands of them?"</p>

    <p>Quite a few people in the bus exclaimed in astonishment.</p>

    <p>Forget premium magic treasures; to be able to produce tens of thousands of low-quality magic weapons in bulk within a short three months in order to make up numbers on the map was simply inconceivable.</p>

    <p>Cupping his jaw, Guo Hao pushed up his glasses and seemed to recall something. "As far as I know, there are currently only two family factories in Huaxiu that can mass produce magic treasures."</p>

    <p>"Which two families?" Chen Chao asked.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao answered earnestly, "Lanxiang and New Orient."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao was startled. "Doesn't one operate excavators and the other teach English?"</p>

    <p>"They changed their line of work."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao spread his hands. "Nowadays, you can't make money through excavating or through teaching English. Any Golden Core cultivator can pull down a building, why would you need an excavator? And when it comes to teaching English, after our Huaxiu nation rose to the top, the whole world is now speaking Huaxiu's language!"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After about an hour on the road, the members from Number 60 High School finally arrived at a military training base on the western outskirts of Songhai city, Huaxiu nation.</p>

    <p>This military training would last for five days and the most important event, the survival drill, would officially start the day after tomorrow. Today was for the students from the six schools to assemble together on the military base.</p>

    <p>The base's two large iron gates, which were several dozen meters wide, slowly opened, and the buses slowly drove onto the base. This was a separate military training base which the Songhai city government had specially set up for local students. It had all the general facilities: teaching buildings, dormitories, a massive sports field as well as a training room that felt very high-tech.</p>

    <p>For the military training, the dorms were six people to a room. Wang Ling, Chen Chao, Guo Hao and Su Xiao were together. Whether it was a coincidence or not, they were assigned to room 101 on the first floor of the dormitory building.</p>

    <p>But the strange thing was, when Wang Ling looked at the names list for room 101, he only saw their four names.</p>

    <p>Were the other two beds unoccupied?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling rejected this conjecture and didn't think it was possible since all the other rooms had six people. In addition, they were in the first room of this dormitory building, so it was completely impossible for these two beds in the first room to be unoccupied.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao had the honor this time of being the dorm leader, and when he had to go collect the necessary military supplies, he dragged Chen Chao along with him.</p>

    <p>Key in hand, Wang Ling and Su Xiao went to the dorm. As they approached their door, Su Xiao sensed an aura in the room â€” someone was inside!</p>

    <p>"It seems like someone's inside the room..." Su Xiao said feebly.</p>

    <p>In actual fact, Wang Ling had already felt it as soon as they had stepped into the building.</p>

    <p>He could sense that person hiding in the dorm; furthermore, this was a premeditated move.</p>

    <p>The main thing was that he was very familiar with this person's aura.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling gestured for Su Xiao to stand to one side of the door.</p>

    <p>Then, he put the key in the lock and turned the doorknob.</p>

    <p>As soon as he opened the door, a large, round shadow instantly lunged at them from inside!</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling, watch out!"</p>

    <p>Su Xiao almost immediately cried out in alarm at this large hidden weapon.</p>

    <p>In the face of this black shadow flying straight at him, Wang Ling had a very calm expression on his face.</p>

    <p>In the split second it was about to touch him, he leaned sideways and evaded it perfectly!</p>

    <p>Then there was a "bang" as this black shadow went right through the door and smashed into the opposite wall.</p>

    <p>After the dust dispersed, Su Xiao could finally clearly see that this black shadow which had looked like a hidden weapon was in actual fact a person.</p>

    <p>That person had come flying out of the room wearing a helmet, and because of the massive impact, his entire head had gotten stuck in the wall...</p>

    <p>Then, Su Xiao saw this man struggle for a long time but was unable to get his head out of the helmet.</p>

    <p>Su Xiao: "..."</p>

    <p>In the end, the young man in the helmet let out a feeble cry for help. "Ling, it's my bad! Hurry up and save me..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed deeply in his heart... <em>Wang Ming, you idiot!</em></p>
