  <h1>Chapter 664 The Death of Elder Yin</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The brown spirit light settled on Zhuo Yi's body, and even his pupils were rendered brown. In almost a split second, his aura was different, and every subtle breath he took carried a strong sense of oppression.</p>

    <p>Elder Yin Zhiping couldn't help breaking out in a cold sweat. That brown spirit light just now had truly been too fast, and even with his dynamic vision, he had only been able to see an indistinct trail... While he wasn't completely certain, it looked as if a sword had turned into a light which then attached itself to this Director Zhuo's body.</p>

    <p>Union between man and sword...</p>

    <p>A sword spirit directly attaching itself to a body; Elder Yin Zhiping had to admit that he had never seen this type of operation before in his lifetime of cultivation.</p>

    <p>Also, he thought that it was extremely unscientific, because generally speaking, union between man and sword could only be achieved when the rapport between a spirit sword and its master reached a certain peak; only then could this fusion happen. The problem with the current situation, however, was that it was very obvious that the spirit sword which had just flown over clearly didn't belong to Director Zhuo.</p>

    <p>But even then, they were actually able to combine together.</p>

    <p>What on earth was the origin of this sword?</p>

    <p>Elder Yin Zhiping unconsciously stepped back as he felt the situation had completely turned around. The driver of the van had also already realized that things had taken a turn for the worse, but when he wanted to reverse the van, he discovered that all the four tires were flat!</p>

    <p>When had that happened?</p>

    <p>They hadn't noticed at all.</p>

    <p>After coming back to their senses, they recalled that when that sword light had possessed Zhuo Yi just now, their minds had blanked out from psychological terror... They had actually been so frightened that they snapped!</p>

    <p>Elder Yin clenched his teeth and frowned.</p>

    <p>At the moment, he had no choice but to fight.</p>

    <p>Moreover, he still felt that he had a chance of winning.</p>

    <p>Although this Director Zhuo was currently one with the sword, this union between man and sword couldn't fundamentally change the strength of his body. As long as Elder Yin's Little Rongnu pierced his skin even a little, a powerful poison would spread throughout Director Zhuo's body - even the attached sword spirit would be helpless against it, wouldn't it?</p>

    <p>It had to be said that while Elder Yin's thoughts were certainly reasonable, when all was said and done, he was unfortunately still too naive.</p>

    <p>He had no idea what kind of challenger the sword spirit standing in front of him was.</p>

    <p>In many cases, you couldn't use common sense to reason things out.</p>

    <p>"No matter who you are, you can't stop our Demon Hunters Association's master plan." Elder Yin Zhiping's face darkened and he chose to strike first. He had Little Rongnu, who was in his hand, turn into a stream of light which swiftly and suddenly lunged at Zhuo Yi's chest!</p>

    <p>But before the light could get close, Elder Yin Zhiping saw Director Zhuo, who was possessed by the sword spirit, coolly stop Little Rongnu with one forefinger.</p>

    <p>The first thing Jingke felt at Little Rongnu's strike was: so weak...</p>

    <p>It was so weak that Jingke couldn't find words to describe it.</p>

    <p>It was a far cry from what he had felt when he had been inside Lord Diulei and fought Evil Sword God, whose attack had felt a little itchy at least. It could be said that this particular attack, however, was utterly harmless... It could even be said to be no damn use!</p>

    <p>Even an egg smashed on a rock could in any case be set off as a little egg flower!</p>

    <p>"Impossible..." Elder Yin Zhiping screeched in his heart.</p>

    <p>There was no way that a Golden Core cultivator's physical strength could withstand this level of assault.</p>

    <p>Of course, there was another explanation for it, and that was Little Rongnu's attack hadn't been blocked by the body, but by the protective sword qi on Director Zhuo!</p>

    <p>So that was it...</p>

    <p>After discovering this secret, Elder Yin Zhiping smiled sinisterly in his heart.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, in Zhuo Yi's body, Jingke's face was expressionless from beginning to end.</p>

    <p>Elder Yin felt it couldn't be helped that this little sword spirit was still too young and had utterly no idea how highly poisonous his Little Rongnu was.</p>

    <p>"This sword spirit brother, if you think you can rely on just sword qi to defend against my Little Rongnu's poison, you're too naive. To make this poisonous, deadly weapon back then, I slaughtered eighty-eight female Rong Dragons and tempered this weapon in the toxin from their blood essence."</p>

    <p>Elder Yin Zhiping sneered; he was widely known for the dark poison arts which he cultivated.</p>

    <p>Even to make this Little Rongnu into his life bonded magic treasure back then, he constantly modified his body.</p>

    <p>Elder Yin Zhiping initially hadn't planned to use this move, but in the face of this protective sword qi and its impenetrable defense, he had no choice but to use this secret technique.</p>

    <p>He took off the upper half of his clothes and bared his arms.</p>

    <p>Inside Zhuo Yi's body, Jingke saw that Elder Yin's arms were actually covered in a black pattern of lines like a zebra.</p>

    <p>Then, Jingke saw Elder Yin Zhiping chant something under his breath, and these lines immediately started to spin before this spiral energy gathered in Elder Yin's hands.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Elder Yin's hands turned completely black with an accumulation of deadly poison!</p>

    <p>This deadly poison even affected the air, suffusing it with dense poison.</p>

    <p>To use this move, Elder Yin had to hold his breath altogether; even the turtle-breathing skill wouldn't work. To make sure that his reasoning during battle wasn't affected, he had even shrewdly contained the poison in both his arms so that it wouldn't flow into the other organs of his body and cause irreversible damage.</p>

    <p>So theoretically, Elder Yin was a semi-toxic person.</p>

    <p>At that point, Elder Yin grit his teeth, grasped Little Rongnu's hilt, and then transferred the poisonous mass in his hands to Little Rongnu. This bayonet, which was already black to begin with, was further covered in a black poisonous miasma which made it look even more terrifying.</p>

    <p>Jingke could sense it slightly.</p>

    <p>Mm, if a sword spirit wasn't strong enough, this poisonous miasma could indeed pervade its sword qi.</p>

    <p>However...</p>

    <p>Jingke put one hand to his forehead as he felt it ache. He thought this Elder Yin was going to pull out some dazzling move; who would have thought it would be so useless.</p>

    <p>Get rid, of this, scum first...</p>

    <p>Jingke raised his hand, prepared to make a move.</p>

    <p>The poison on Little Rongnu now amplified, Elder Yin sneered. "Not even ghosts or the gods can withstand Little Rongnu's poison! I refuse to believe I can't poison you!"</p>

    <p>Who knew if it was a habit of his, but before he made his move, Elder Yin licked Little Rongnu's blade.</p>

    <p>Jingke: "..."</p>

    <p>A few seconds later, Elder Yin's complexion straightaway turned deathly white as he foamed at the mouth and fell down dead.</p>

    <p>Jingke: "..."</p>
