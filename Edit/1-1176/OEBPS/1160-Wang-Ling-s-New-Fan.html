  <h1>Chapter 1160 Wang Ling's New Fan</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When you had power that was too strong for you to control, you couldn't help but shiver and feel afraid - Wang Ling had experienced this feeling countless times as a child.</p>

    <p>He would jerk awake on dark nights, afraid that he would do something terrible when he was asleep.</p>

    <p>After all, destroying the world would've been a piece of cake for Wang Ling back before the Dao talisman seal was officially developed. But even the Dao talisman seal didn't mean true freedom for Wang Ling - his power was constantly growing, and would one day surpass what the Dao talisman seal could take.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't say anything, but the moment his palm landed lightly and comfortingly on Xia Ming's shoulder, their minds became connected.</p>

    <p>Xia Ming felt like he saw the whole of Wang Ling's life in a few short seconds.</p>

    <p>His tears couldn't help pouring out at the sense of loneliness that came with being invincible.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had chosen to act at that moment because he knew that this was the perfect opportunity to get rid of Xia Ming's "Eye of Rebellion."</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling had overlooked one point.</p>

    <p>The Eye of Rebellion was also a Fate Dao spell, so when Wang Ling was trying to get rid of it, his fate line converged with Xia Ming's for a brief moment.</p>

    <p>And it was this brief moment which enabled Xia Ming to understand what sort of existence Wang Ling was.</p>

    <p>The people at school didn't know much about Wang Ling. While their fate lines had converged, which seemed to have exposed him, Wang Ling wasn't worried that Xia Ming would say anything.</p>

    <p>Because everything would seem like a dream. Once their fate lines split apart, the memories would quickly disappear and Xia Ming would forget everything.</p>

    <p>"It won't hurt any longer." Wang Ling's voice sounded in the depths of Xia Ming's heart to comfort him.</p>

    <p>As soon as Wang Ling said these words, the "Eye of Rebellion" curse in Xia Ming's stomach, which was like a festering sore on the bottom of the foot, was pulled out by the root, and completely disappeared.</p>

    <p>When Xia Ming came back to his senses, he realized he was crying, but he had no idea what he had just seen.</p>

    <p>The Eye of Rebellion, the things that the white-haired young man had threatened him into doing, the hidden side of Wang Ling - he forgot all of it.</p>

    <p>But Xia Ming sensed that he had returned to normal. He no longer trembled or felt afraid when it came to his power, and for some reason, he didn't hate Wang Ling at all...</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling... you..."</p>

    <p>Xia Ming had thought that Wang Ling would hate him, but when Xia Ming had shrunk back and was feeling afraid, it was Wang Ling who appeared behind him to support him with a hand on his back and give him warm strength.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Xia Ming looked at Wang Ling and couldn't help sighing. "No wonder Classmate Sun Rong likes you so much."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling, I've decided to give up on competing with you. Indeed, Classmate Sun Rong deserves someone better." Xia Ming gazed unwaveringly at Wang Ling and spouted righteous words that alarmed the latter.</p>

    <p>"???"</p>

    <p>Why pass everything to him...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was stupefied.</p>

    <p><em>If you don't compete, who will be my shield against that girl?!</em></p>

    <p>Wang Ling never thought that just by casually helping to remove an evil curse, he suddenly gained a new fan...</p>

    <p>There was indeed a spell among his thirty thousand Heavenly Dao that could forcibly turn a person into his fan, the kind of fan that chased and supported their idol.</p>

    <p>It was called the Great Fan Spell, but Wang Ling didn't use it often, since it was a little difficult to control how much strength was required; if he used too much strength, the fans would turn into scary "sasaeng fans"... The type that could find out where you live, and hide inside your place for a week as they waited for the chance to take a picture of you in the shower.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had also thought about using the Great Fan Spell before, since his relationship with Xia Ming was a little more tense.</p>

    <p>But after considering the bug with this Heavenly Dao, he ultimately didn't cast it on Xia Ming...</p>

    <p>He didn't want a male sasaeng fan squatting in his house every day and taking pictures of his life.</p>

    <p>But why had Xia Ming become his fan?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that this might have something to do with Fate Dao.</p>

    <p>When the fate lines of two people were connected, it probably had an effect similar to the Great Fan Spell, and smoothed out the wrinkles in "the fetters of fate."</p>

    <p>This was the only feasible explanation Wang Ling could think of so far.</p>

    <p>"Advance!" At that moment, there was a loud shout outside Number 60 High's secure camp fortifications.</p>

    <p>Nan Yixiu, captain of South Sea Sky High, and Zhu Hanyun, captain of Titan High, led the charge forward as everyone used hand seals and various spells to bombard Number 60 High's defense barrier.</p>

    <p>But how could it be so easy to break through this barrier? It was Gu Shunzhi and the others who had set it up...</p>

    <p>In addition, they were very crafty. In order to make the barrier look weaker, they used one that looked very thin... The ultra-thin barrier was naturally less durable, but Gu Shunzhi and the others had adjusted its recovery ability.</p>

    <p>In other words, it looked easy to break this ultra-thin barrier, but it recovered as quickly as it was torn apart.</p>

    <p>No matter how much the other side attacked, it felt like they were always one breath away from breaking the barrier.</p>

    <p>People who played tricks were all dirty...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed with mixed feelings. He felt that Gu Shunzhi and the others had finally learned what it truly meant to "lay low."</p>

    <p>Nan Yixiu, Zhu Hanyun, and the alliance of forty people attacked for a good ten minutes, but still couldn't break through Number 60 High's barrier. Taking into account the constant depletion of their spirit energy, they had to retreat for the moment, as they sat cross-legged and regulated their breathing.</p>

    <p>"What's going on? Why can't Number 60 High's barrier be broken?"</p>

    <p>"It can be broken! I feel like we're almost there each time..."</p>

    <p>The students discussed tactics. Number 60 High really was a tough nut to crack; at least, a lot harder than they had thought.</p>

    <p>[Survivors remaining: 519]</p>

    <p>Looking at the number of remaining survivors projected above the mountain dome, Nan Yixiu and the others instantly felt a strong sense of crisis.</p>

    <p>If they continued wasting time here, they would inevitably be faced with one of two situations if their spirit energy ran out: Number 60 High would launch a counterattack, or their group would be swallowed up by other teams coming here.</p>

    <p>This was a huge headache for both Nan Yixiu and Zhu Hanyun. "It's not good..."</p>

    <p>Worse still, Zhu Hanyun's arm was now injured, and urgently required medical treatment. While Nan Yixiu did have some medical skills, they clearly weren't enough.</p>

    <p>"What now?"</p>

    <p>At the foot of the mountain, everyone looked lost.</p>

    <p>Just then, they saw a paper airplane actually flying down from the mountain...</p>

    <p>The paper airplane hit Nan Yixiu right in the forehead. He opened it and read what was written inside: <em>If you abandon your attack, you can consider forming an alliance with us. Wait until the last day, and we'll have one final battle on the mountain dome...</em></p>

    <p>"What does it say?" Zhu Hanyun asked.</p>

    <p>"It says we can join them, but on one condition," said Nan Yixiu.</p>

    <p>"What condition?"</p>

    <p>"Join Classmate Wang Ling's fan club..."</p>
