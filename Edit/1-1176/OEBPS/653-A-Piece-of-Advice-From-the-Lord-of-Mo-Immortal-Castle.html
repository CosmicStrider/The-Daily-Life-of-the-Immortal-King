  <h1>Chapter 653 A Piece of Advice From the Lord of Mo Immortal Castle</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Mo Immortal Castle was an intelligence organization that enjoyed a particular level of reputation in Songhai City and even in the world. The reason why it had lasted so long and was so established was thanks to the prestige it had accumulated through its satisfied clients; even when it had been on the verge of collapse many times, the organization managed to pick itself up in the nick of time.</p>

    <p>In reality, it wasn't just the cultivation underworld that bought information from Mo Immortal Castle; it also had lawful clients. What mattered in the end was who could meet a higher price. As Mo Immortal Castle's most important client, President Bai enjoyed lifelong service of secrecy in the organization. That was to say, Mo Immortal Castle would never sell any information related to him.</p>

    <p>In working with such an important client, apart from protecting his privacy, Mo Immortal Castle also considered his personal safety.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High this place...</p>

    <p>In the Lord of the Castle's eyes at least, this was a pretty ominous place.</p>

    <p>There had really been too many big shots who had fallen in this place. Even if they survived, like that Daoist Taotie, he just so happened to be the junior brother of that Number 60 High's history teacher!</p>

    <p>Now that the Lord thought about it carefully, he felt that the reason why Daoist Taotie had been able to escape unscathed... definitely had to be because he was related to a teacher from Number 60 High!</p>

    <p>However, President Bai and Elder Ji Xing behind him didn't pay attention to the Lord's well-meaning advice. Elder Ji Xing merely accepted this information which they had paid for on President Bai's behalf and then directly plugged the USB into the portable laptop he carried as he started to scan the information.</p>

    <p>"Number 60 High?"</p>

    <p>Elder Ji Xing thought this place was a little familiar; for a period of time, it had seemed to pop up repeatedly in the news.</p>

    <p>"President Bai, Elder Ji Xing... I feel that you should reconsider." The Lord was silent for a while before he said, "There's something a little strange about this school; my Mo Immortal Castle was just about to put this school on the list of restricted areas. From now on, we will no longer arrange for our spies to operate around this school."</p>

    <p>"Aren't you exaggerating?" Elder Ji Xing sneered. "I remember now, didn't that General Director Zhuo Yi who's currently doing so well graduate from this school? For such a small school, it contains so many capable people."</p>

    <p>"That's right; apart from this youngster who's still studying in this Foundation Establishment high school for some reason, its teachers also aren't ordinary." The Lord stroked his beard and reminded them, "This school is responsible for the top-ranked international assassination organization, Shadow Stream, being completely wiped out. The truth is, there are indeed a pair of individuals at this school whom the assassins circle recognize as epic-level killers."</p>

    <p>When the Lord said this, President Bai's eyebrows finally moved slightly.</p>

    <p>Elder Ji Xing asked curiously, "Do you mean Daoist Taotie and Gorgeous Itinerant?"</p>

    <p>"That's right." The Lord answered honestly, "After Gorgeous Itinerant retired, he became a history teacher at this school. A while ago, his junior brother came to my Mo Immortal Castle to buy information for the sake of revenge. Unfortunately, it appears that the two of them reconciled in the end. Besides these two great killers, the rest of the teachers in this school, whether they have high or low realms, aren't characters that are easy to deal with."</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, the Lord sighed quietly in his heart.</p>

    <p>He had truly already tried his best!</p>

    <p>Actually, he had exaggerated a little as he deliberately made Number 60 High's teachers sound very mysterious. But the truth was that apart from that Gorgeous Itinerant who was already a known quantity, the only other person at Number 60 High currently who could truly be considered an expert was Headmaster Chen; this was also a person who wasn't easy to deal with.</p>

    <p>In short, while his explanation had been slightly exaggerated, the Lord of the Castle hoped that this important client of his wouldn't have anything to do with this "troublesome place."</p>

    <p>However, not everyone had as intense a desire to survive as the Lord.</p>

    <p>Apart from the faint twitch of his eyebrows earlier, President Bai didn't seem to think much of Number 60 High School at all.</p>

    <p>"Ji Xing, I'll leave this school to you." After a moment of silence, he gave Elder Ji Xing next to him this instruction.</p>

    <p>"How should I deal with it?" Elder Ji Xing smiled deviously.</p>

    <p>"Raze it to the ground," President Bai said lightly.</p>

    <p>"Very well." Elder Ji Xing nodded his head.</p>

    <p>It wasn't the first time they had done something like this, it was just on a broader scale this time.</p>

    <p>It was just a Foundation Establishment high school; apart from one or two teachers who would be slightly harder to handle and that mysterious youngster, this would be a piece of cake, and Elder Ji Xing felt a little excited!</p>

    <p>When the time came, President Bai just needed to use the "Wuji Umbrella" to open an independent space in Number 60 High's school grounds, and Elder Ji Xing could sneak in and do whatever he wanted!</p>

    <p>Elder Ji Xing's smile was full of confidence; it was the kind of smile that hid daggers. "Rest assured, Lord President, I'll definitely handle this splendidly. Zuo Wu that trash was too soft, but I'm different."</p>

    <p>The Lady was blank when she saw his expression. "I have yet to ask President Bai, who is this elder?"</p>

    <p>Ji Xing looked at President Bai, and the latter raised his hand to indicate that Elder Ji Xing could disclose his identity.</p>

    <p>Elder Ji Xing looked at the Lord of the Castle. "I forgot to introduce myself, this humble one is called Ji Xing. I am President Bai's number one weaponsmith. I was studying on Sun Island all these years, and I've only just returned to Lord President's side. During my time on Sun Island, I was also called Sonico."</p>

    <p>"Sun Island?" The Lord narrowed his eyes. He couldn't tell that this Elder Ji Xing was actually an overseas returnee.</p>

    <p>But speaking of studying on Sun Island, the Lord could instantly draw some conclusions about this Elder Ji Xing. From his relatively skintight outfit, it was very likely that the other party had studied Sun Island's ninjutsu. It was a small place to begin with, so to specially run over to study, it definitely had to do with ninjutsu.</p>

    <p>The Lord gave a faint smile. "It appears that Mr Ji Xing is skilled in ninjutsu?"</p>

    <p>"I wouldn't say I'm skilled, I just have my own understanding of it." Elder Ji Xing smiled. "But speaking of this humble one's path of learning, a lot happened. For example, I once encountered a very strong baldie on Sun Island, who used the 'One Punch Ninja Technique' and almost destroyed me..."</p>

    <p>The Lord of the Castle: "In the end?"</p>

    <p>"Luckily, I only lost one ball."</p>

    <p>Elder Ji Xing smiled: "Before that, my alias was actually Sonic<sup>1</sup>."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This entire exchange refers to Sonic, 索尼克 in the Chinese transliteration, who is a ninja character in the series "One Punch Man" that accidentally gets punched in the crotch by the bald-headed protagonist, hence the joke of him losing his balls. Chinese viewers jokingly changed his name to 索尼子, with 子 meaning 'egg,' another way to refer to a man's balls in Chinese.)</dfn>

    <p>The Lord and Lady: "..."</p>
