  <h1>Chapter 592 I'm Old and a Little Tired...</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The moment the figure of the red-haired young man fell from the sky, the ghost generals and the ghost soldiers that filled the sky were purged in the blink of an eye by the pure and holy light that had appeared.</p>

    <p>Daoist Witch Demon and Daoist Bronze Turtle paled with fright â€” this man was so scary! When he appeared, the purifying effect he carried had directly purified the world, and his aura had actually directly affected the ghost array, immediately causing it to stop working!</p>

    <p>Daoist Witch Demon looked at this scene in disbelief. He looked askance at the ghost flags of the array, and then noticed that there were actually cracks in them which ran down the flag posts and which ultimately caused the flags to directly crumble inch by inch...</p>

    <p>Daoist Witch Demon: "???"</p>

    <p>The array flags were covered in a steel membrane!</p>

    <p>This person wasn't simple at all...</p>

    <p>Judging from the green-furred mongrel's actions earlier, however, it seemed that this human cultivator had been summoned here by this dog. Daoist Witch Demon immediately made a guess - there had to be no mistake, this person was probably this green-furred dog's owner.</p>

    <p>"Senior, as you are a person from the human cultivation world, if possible, please do not interfere in the affairs of our demon world..." Daoist Witch Demon made a very polite bow. The coming of this sort of heaven-defying expert already upset the balance in the demon world, and he felt that there was no way Demon Saint would turn a blind eye like before.</p>

    <p>In fact, Daoist Witch Demon was right.</p>

    <p>Because he bore the will of the demon world, Demon Saint would immediately notice the slightest ripple in the world. Given how loud Immortal Zhenyuan's appearance had been, it was impossible for Demon Saint to not have sensed it. As Daoist Witch Demon had said, Immortal Zhenyuan's existence had already destroyed the balance.</p>

    <p>Demon Saint thought of himself as a demon with principles... If this red-haired young man went overboard, he would consider stopping him.</p>

    <p>On the Holy Pillar, Demon Saint narrowed his eyes.</p>

    <p>That was because the young man who had been summoned here wasn't the spirit dog's owner...</p>

    <p>The gaze of the dog's owner from before had left a deep shadow on Demon Saint's heart. At the time, that frightful gaze and those utterly unforgettable dead fish eyes were like a nightmare in Demon Saint's mind which he couldn't banish.</p>

    <p>Since succeeding the position of Demon Saint, there had never been anyone who could cause him to feel such tremendous psychological pressure with just one gaze.</p>

    <p>As mentioned before, experts could determine the gap in strength in a fight with a look.</p>

    <p>This red-haired young man's overall strength was weaker than that of the dog's owner, but was probably on par with his...</p>

    <p>Demon Saint looked down from the top of the Holy Pillar and made a decision in his heart.</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, after receiving the message from the main seal, Immortal Zhenyuan's entire being was directly sent here. He had still been repairing Drought Star when he was suddenly sent here. Although it was a little abrupt, Immortal Zhenyuan was instead a little happy.</p>

    <p>It looked like Senior Dog hadn't forgotten him!</p>

    <p>Turning his head, Immortal Zhenyuan saw "Senior Dog," who was wearing a yellow skintight outfit today which looked quite trendy. And moreover, that emerald green bone staff in its hand was emitting a mysterious power that was difficult to describe.</p>

    <p>As expected of Senior Dog... It was actually able to fuse the power of Heavenly Dao with a magic weapon!</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan was deeply astonished in his heart.</p>

    <p>Why hadn't he thought of this?</p>

    <p>This was probably the difference between him and Senior Dog...</p>

    <p>As he sighed in his heart, the demon world territory envoy in front of him who had set up the ghost array suddenly spoke to him.</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan gave Daoist Witch Demon a look of disgust. "I only listen to Senior Dog!"</p>

    <p>Daoist Witch Demon's and Daoist Bronze Turtle's faces turned pale at these words and they were rooted to the spot in fear as they almost froze like stone - Senior... Senior Dog?</p>

    <p>At that moment, the two territory envoys plus Elder Wen hiding in the peace consulate couldn't help sucking in cold breaths of air.</p>

    <p>It turned out that this red-haired young man wasn't this green-furred dog's owner!</p>

    <p>But... its underling?</p>

    <p>How interesting...</p>

    <p>"What were you doing before you got here?" Er Ha's tone was completely different and had become a little deeper. After all, it had acted as the dog savior of the world before, and it was very clear about its role.</p>

    <p>As long as Zhenyuan was present, it just needed to maintain this "senior" setting.</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan clasped his fists in a salute and answered politely, "Senior Dog, junior is still repairing Drought Star; currently, the repairs are already half done."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Mm. Well done. I wasn't disturbing you when I summoned you, was I?"</p>

    <p>"Disturb? How can senior's summons be a disturbance? This is a rare learning opportunity!" The red-haired young man waved his hand and bowed to Er Ha. "Senior's previous grade ten spell blew up Drought Star's surface. Now that I'm doing repair works on it, I'm in fact learning a lot! It feels like I'm playing Minecraft!"</p>

    <p>Immediately after Immortal Zhenyuan spoke -</p>

    <p>Daoist Witch Demon and Daoist Bronze Turtle were stunned once again. A grade... grade ten spell... had almost blown up an earth's surface...</p>

    <p>How was this dog so awesome? Then what was with those two lousy boxing techniques earlier? So this green-furred dog hadn't been using all of its strength, and had just been playing?</p>

    <p>The two territory envoys were stupefied.</p>

    <p>The conversation between this red-haired young man with unfathomable strength and this green-furred dog was so mind-blowing that for one moment, the atmosphere froze around them. The thoughts of the two territory envoys had also directly frozen and they didn't know what to say.</p>

    <p>"Junior is slow-witted; why has Senior Dog summoned me this time?" Immortal Zhenyuan asked softly.</p>

    <p>"Mm, just now I tried boxing a little with the two juniors up ahead, and I'm feeling a little tired," Er Ha said.</p>

    <p>Daoist Witch Demon and Daoist Bronze Turtle: "???"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "I'm old, and sometimes I can't keep up with these energetic youngsters... Especially in a fight like this, it's so boring it makes me sleepy and I just can't get excited."</p>

    <p>Daoist Witch Demon and Daoist Bronze Turtle: "???"</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan's face was wreathed in smiles. "Then senior's meaning is you need me to take action?"</p>

    <p>Daoist Witch Demon and Daoist Bronze Turtle: "???"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Mm, handle them as you see fit, but don't kill them. Remember to leave them alive... There's something I want to ask them."</p>

    <p>"Yes, senior!"</p>

    <p>As he said this, Immortal Zhenyuan released his aura, causing heaven and earth to shake. An energy that had primordial qi mixed into it rushed out from under the red-haired young man's feet toward the two territory envoys.</p>

    <p>"!!!"</p>

    <p>Daoist Witch Demon and Daoist Bronze Turtle were already trembling all over.</p>

    <p>They were thinking only one thing now... escape! As far as they could!</p>

    <p>This man's strength was too scary and far beyond theirs...</p>

    <p>At that moment, the two territory envoys felt a critical sense of impending death, and they both used their trump cards to madly run for their lives as they turned into two streams of lights that flew off. They didn't even have time to pick up the broken ghost flags on the ground.</p>

    <p><em>Want to run?</em></p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan smiled faintly.</p>

    <p>Of course it was impossible...</p>

    <p><em>It's not easy for me to find such a good opportunity to show off in front of Senior Dog; how boring would it be if I let the two of you escape?</em></p>
