  <h1>Chapter 506 Mr Lu's Wonderful Use </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling seldom played games, because for him... they were really boring.</p>

    <p>However, this game was different, and Wang Ling felt like he had discovered the fun and value of games.</p>

    <p>At the very least, it was a bridge of communication with his family's Er Ha.</p>

    <p>Because of Er Ha's unusual identity, Wang Ling was actually usually very careful not to ask it too many questions about its previous life as a demon king; he was afraid it would agitate his Er Ha and have an irreversible impact on its spirit.</p>

    <p>In fact, after careful analysis, Wang Ling thought that Er Ha's experience before becoming a dog was really a heavy psychological shadow over it.</p>

    <p>First of all...</p>

    <p>When Er Ha had still been a demon king back then, the other demon kings had pushed it out of the Gate Between Worlds, and after landing, it hadn't looked cool for even three seconds before it had died with a single punch from ten-year-old Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Second was the school placement test at the start of the semester.</p>

    <p>Er Ha's primordial spirit had been inserted into the school's testing system for students to hit like a sandbag as a ranking assessment. In the end, it encountered Wang Ling once again. Wang Ling remembered that Er Ha had been so scared back then that it had directly fallen flat on the spot, four feet pointed up at the sky and eyes rolled back...</p>

    <p>The third and final time.</p>

    <p>Everyone had used ghost-summoning talismans during Teacher Pan's Dao talismans lesson. After racking its brain at that time, Er Ha had abandoned most of its primordial spirit to break away and flee the school. In the end, before it could even leave the school's main entrance, Wang Ling had summoned it to the classroom.</p>

    <p>And then, there was no "and then"...</p>

    <p>Er Ha completely turned into a dog.</p>

    <p>Two encounters one after another that could be considered childhood trauma - what kind of experience was that... Wang Ling felt that only Er Ha itself would understand.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't ask Er Ha about its previous life, but that didn't mean that he didn't care.</p>

    <p>After all, this was his family's Er Ha who had already been acknowledged by everyone as part of the family. As its owner, Wang Ling could never ignore it.</p>

    <p>From what Wang Ling could now sense, Er Ha's worry clearly had something to do with its tribe in the Gate Between Worlds, and something big was probably about to happen. As for why Er Ha hadn't consulted him directly, Wang Ling also had his own conjecture.</p>

    <p>This was because of Er Ha's stubbornness as a demon king before it had become a dog.</p>

    <p>Part of it also was its resolve to bid its past farewell for good.</p>

    <p>So this guy actually wanted to personally end everything...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was also taken aback!</p>

    <p>Where on earth did Er Ha get its courage from? Liang Jingru <sup>1</sup> ?!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A Chinese singer who sang a song entitled "Courage..")</dfn>

    <p>Given Er Ha's current overall battle strength, Wang Ling felt that Er Ha would just be courting death if it entered the Gate Between Worlds now.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling communicated his conclusions to Lord Diulei telepathically.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was also shaken. "Brother Ling, you think Brother Dog's abnormal behavior recently is related to the Tuntian Ha clan in the Gate Between Worlds?" While it was a completely unexpected reply, Lord Diulei did think it was completely logical.</p>

    <p>After thinking back on it for a bit, he felt more and more that Wang Ling's answer was very sound. "Brother Dog has not yet completely cut off ties to its previous life; indeed, it's possible that this has to do with its original clan inside the Gate Between Worlds."</p>

    <p>At this point, Lord Diulei looked at Mr Lu, who was sitting upright on the floor in an obedient manner.</p>

    <p>After the effect of Xiao Yin's phlegm on serious injuries had worn off, the Spell of Creation and Rebirth had already taken effect. Mr Lu's wound was already completely healed, and his skin was just stained with a little blood.</p>

    <p>As expected, the Tree clan's ability to recover was terrifying!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei couldn't help sighing in his heart. Luckily they had Xiao Yin's thick phlegm, otherwise it would have been pretty difficult to deal with Mr Lu; unless it was something like Wang Ling's single crippling and explosive strike, even other True Immortal experts might not be able to kill Mr Lu.</p>

    <p>"How much do you know about the Gate Between Worlds, Mr Lu?" Lord Diulei asked.</p>

    <p>Mr Lu was originally a tree demon that had been born in the Gate Between Worlds. While he was now lurking and "working" in the human world, he had to have some way of keeping in touch with the Tree clan in the Gate Between Worlds.</p>

    <p>Mr Lu thought for a moment before he nodded and answered, "I have a magic artifact which indeed allows me to contact my clansmen." Since things had come to this point and he had already decided to switch sides, he no longer hid anything. He did indeed have a way of contacting his tribe inside the Gate Between Worlds, but he could only connect with some of the elders in the main Tree clan.</p>

    <p>"Then is it possible for you to ask them about the Tuntian Ha clan's situation?"</p>

    <p>"They'll have to ask around. The demon race actually isn't as united as humans think. Every clan fights and plots against each other as they fight over territory and resources; they're constantly using all kinds of reasons as excuses to start wars..." said Mr Lu with a sigh.</p>

    <p>If the demon world really was peaceful, he wouldn't need to risk coming to the human world to "work," and he wouldn't have been swindled into accepting a fake spirit sword.</p>

    <p>This was truly a great humiliation...</p>

    <p>Actually, what Mr Lu said were things that Lord Diulei had heard from dissident groups, but which he had yet to verify.</p>

    <p>The demon world wasn't at peace.</p>

    <p>In fact, someone had anonymously divulged this issue on the cultivation forum previously, but Lord Diulei had always been skeptical about this information. Listening to Mr Lu now, however, Lord Diulei suddenly recalled the numerous hot news items which that informant had disclosed. One of the top ones had apparently mentioned that a large-scale battle was on the verge of breaking out between two major clans in the demon world.</p>

    <p>"We'll still have to trouble Mr Lu to make inquiries into this matter." Lord Diulei looked at Mr Lu as he spoke, his chin in his hand.</p>

    <p>Mr Lu nodded. "Alright."</p>

    <p>"I've already discussed it with Brother Ling; from now on, Mr Lu, you'll come with me. We won't send you to the police for the time being; before that, you have to atone for your crimes. Do you have any objections?"</p>

    <p>"No..."</p>

    <p>Mr Lu lowered his head. Out of the corner of his eye, he kept sneaking glances at Wang Ling. As Lord Diulei spoke, Mr Lu saw how Wang Ling fiddled with the mousepad under his hand as he seemed lost in thought, which made Mr Lu tremble all over despite himself.</p>

    <p>He had almost died on the spot earlier from a casual blow from a mousepad.</p>

    <p>He didn't want to be hit again...</p>

    <p>"Previously I took in a housekeeper with the surname Song, full name Song Qingshu. He's helping me manage some other estates right now. You just need to follow him around; he'll take you ahead a bit at a time on your journey of atonement." Saying this, Lord Diulei laughed. "Actually, you won't be doing anything difficult; Mr Lu should be very good at it!"</p>

    <p>"...Exactly what kind of job is it?"</p>

    <p>Mr Lu was still feeling a little anxious.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Recently, the state invested huge amounts of charity contributions into setting up a lot of relief centers and orphanages in remote areas, but because they're all newly built, the smell is too overpowering. As it happens, Mr Lu can help to get rid of the smell of formaldehyde or something!"</p>

    <p>Mr Lu: "..."</p>
