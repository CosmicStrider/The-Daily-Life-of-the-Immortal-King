  <h1>Chapter 129 Which Old Leader Is This? </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was twelve o'clock, which should have been the dead of night for every human being!</p>

    <p>On the top floor of a staff apartment of the General Office of the Municipal Council in the urban heart of Songhai city, Mayor Ding Yunsong was in a sleeping robe and trying his best to "learn a foreign language" with a foreign blonde lolita when he suddenly received an emergency call.</p>

    <p>Since the mood had been interrupted, it was clear that he was a little unhappy, and even his voice sounded depressed when he picked up the phone. "Who is it?"</p>

    <p>The person on the other end just said three syllables: "Song Qingshu."</p>

    <p>As soon as he heard these three syllables, Mayor Ding's body jolted abruptly and he instantly picked himself up and smiled obsequiously. "So it's Mr Song... Mr Song, it's so late, what can I do for you?"</p>

    <p>"Does Mayor Ding already know about the incident on Weibo? The wife of that Wang Situ was molested, and caused a huge uproar," Song Qingshu said directly, not beating around the bush.</p>

    <p>Ding Yunsong made a show of being earnest as he nodded. "Yes, of course I know!"</p>

    <p>Actually, he didn't... he had been busy learning a foreign language, how would he have had time to worry about what was happening on Weibo?</p>

    <p>"That groper is a fellow younger brother of my subordinate. That day, he had drunk two bottles of <em>erguotou </em><sup>1</sup> , so his wits were a little addled. This is actually all a misunderstanding," said Song Qingshu.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>('Erguotou' is also known as
Chinese white liquor and is a
Chinese alcoholic beverage.)</dfn>

    <p>"I understand Mr Song's meaning. But there is a process for dealing with the aftermath that has to be followed..."</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu nodded. "I understand your meaning as well. Within half an hour of this call, three million yuan will be deposited into your foreign account for you to handle as you see fit. As for Wang Situ's family, give them some hush money to prevent them from spreading nonsense."</p>

    <p>Both men were experienced veterans; in just a few words, they were able to instantly establish the implications of this conversation. Though he was the mayor of Songhai city, Ding Yunsong readily called Song Qingshu Mr Song; anyone who was discerning enough would be able to tell what their relationship was like. Ding Yunsong was well aware in his heart that back then, if Mo Immortal Castle hadn't helped him get promoted, he would never have had the opportunity to sit in this position.</p>

    <p>He was silent for a while before he finally nodded. "Mr Song, rest assured. I guarantee that by early morning, this hyped-up Weibo post won't appear in the public eye any longer..."</p>

    <p>After that short call, he made several calls of his own: to Weibo's chairman of operations, to the technology department manager of the General Office of the Municipal Council... Ding Yunsong called all related parties with the ability to suppress public opinion to "convey his greetings."</p>

    <p>This already wasn't the first time that he had used his power to control public opinion.</p>

    <p>The first time that he had done so, he hadn't known who to look for, but now it was a walk in the park.</p>

    <p>After making dozens of calls, he stretched and looked at his wristwatch; it was already two in the early hours of the morning.</p>

    <p>The little foreign lolita in lace suspenders was already fast asleep.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Ding Yunsong was already completely not in the mood.</p>

    <p>"I should rest early tonight!"</p>

    <p>He sighed, walked gently over to the lolita and tucked her in.</p>

    <p>He was about to kiss her forehead when that damned phone rang once again.</p>

    <p>This time, he lost his patience â€” <em>fuck, let me learn a foreign language in peace!</em></p>

    <p>Mayor Ding was annoyed when he picked up the phone. "This is Ding Yunsong! It's so late, can't you report tomorrow?!"</p>

    <p>As the switchboard operator on the other end of the call was berated, the girl said helplessly in her sweet voice, "Mayor Ding, don't be angry... this is a call from the Department of Discipline Inspection."</p>

    <p>"Department of Discipline Inspection? Quickly put it through..."</p>

    <p>For some reason, he had a bad feeling.</p>

    <p>The administrator of the Department of Discipline Inspection only needed to say a few words, and instantly Ding Yunsong was no longer sleepy, his face turning pale.</p>

    <p>"We have been instructed by a higher-up to thoroughly investigate online guru Wang Situ's case to use as an example to others? He... he's just a web novelist, do we have to be so serious about it?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, Mayor Ding. Does it sound like I'm joking? Haven't you seen Weibo? The Supreme Cultivation Court and the Cultivation Prosecutor's Office have released official statements to say that they will be creating special legislation targeted at the deplorable act of groping in society. The higher-up has expressed that we should be strictly focused on this issue."</p>

    <p>Ding Yunsong couldn't help breaking out in a cold sweat.</p>

    <p>Higher-up? Which higher-up? Which higher-up could move the Supreme Cultivation Court and the Cultivation Prosecutor's Office? For matters as major as legislation... to say "do it," and it would be done... this was clearly such a trivial incident, how had it stirred up such huge waves?</p>

    <p>Listening to the call, Ding Yunsong was dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>From the moment he had received this call from the Department of Discipline Inspection, he had already known that this incident was now beyond his control. It was true that Song Qingshu had looked for him, but it was very obvious that the other party had also asked someone for help; furthermore, they had found a big name that he had no way of moving at all.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Ding Yunsong had no choice but to suffer in silence. He didn't even want to hang up the phone, because he was fairly certain that the top brass in the other departments were already in chaos, waiting on new instructions from him! Because the command from the higher-up and what Ding Yunsong had said in his phone calls earlier were two completely different things!</p>

    <p>He licked his dry lips, his forehead already wet with sweat.</p>

    <p>Less than ten minutes after the call from the Department of Discipline Inspection, his phone rang once more...</p>

    <p>This time, he conscientiously looked at the number that was calling, and almost pissed his pants... it was the Municipal Secretary, Secretary Sha!</p>

    <p>He answered the phone, already anticipating the magnetic and severe voice that came over the line.</p>

    <p>"Comrade Ding Yunsong, what are you doing as mayor? Are you allowed to suppress public opinion? You made the first move without any instructions from the higher-ups? Did you accept a 'red packet' from someone to handle this matter? Comrade Ding Yunsong, I'm giving you a serious warning, don't spend your time thinking about how to stir up things... I wonder if you've watched the TV series <em>In the Name of Cultivation </em>? I think you're very similar to the mayor who escaped abroad in the first two episodes!"</p>

    <p>Ding Yunsong was already too scared to speak. "..."</p>

    <p>"Whether or not you can keep your mayor's <em>wushamao </em><sup>2</sup> depends on your attitude toward this incident. Am I clear?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(The wushamao is a Chinese
hat with two thin oval-shaped
boards on each side that was
worn by traditional Chinese
officials ..)</dfn>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, the Municipal Secretary's tone became even darker. "The old leader is very angry about this matter! After waking up at midnight, he flew into a rage! He said that social ethics in Songhai city are in shambles if the cries of the people and public opinion can't be heard. He wants a thorough investigation of corruption in all city offices. Next week, fellow cultivators from the central government's anti-corruption inspection group will come to do inspections in our city."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Ding Yunsong shivered all over. "May I ask, Secretary Sha... which old leader is this?"</p>

    <p>"Mayor Ding, are you playing dumb with me? Shouldn't you have guessed it already? The Ten Founding Generals are all his students. Which old leader do you think it is?"</p>

    <p>Ding Yunsong's mouth dropped open, big enough to fit a whole apple in it. He was already utterly stupefied. "..."</p>
