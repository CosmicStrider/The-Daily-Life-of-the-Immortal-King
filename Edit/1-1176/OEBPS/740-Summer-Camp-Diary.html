  <h1>Chapter 740 Summer Camp Diary</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At this time, all the students were inside the tents writing their summer camp diary. This was an assignment which each lead teacher had given their group. All the students participating in this summer camp had to write down their insights and reflections on this trip in the form of a diary, in no less than a thousand words. This thing was like the "military training diary" for the combined military training for six schools before, but there was a difference compared with an ordinary military training diary.</p>

    <p>Because this summer camp diary counted toward credits!</p>

    <p>The key to getting high marks this time was your impressions of the plants which you saw on your journey: after demonstrating extensive understanding of the medical effects of these plants, you had to come up with imaginative theories for their future use. Put simply, this was about who had the wilder imagination.</p>

    <p>The overall marks for the summer camp diary accounted for fifty percent of the total points for the whole summer camp</p>

    <p>Therefore, everyone had no choice but to do it properly.</p>

    <p>"Guo Hao, what did you write? Let me take a look when you're done?" Liberal arts had always been Chen Chao's weak point. A pen in his mouth and the diary in his hand, he didn't know where to start.</p>

    <p>Writing an essay or whatnot was the hardest...</p>

    <p>Worse still, it had to be a thousand words...</p>

    <p>He could still endure it in high school, but Chen Chao felt that once he entered university and studied a major that had absolutely nothing to do with liberal arts, he might not be able to write even five hundred words then.</p>

    <p>"I'm also thinking about the subject matter, and it's a little complicated, so I'm going to start the diary entry for my first day from a political angle." Guo Hao was the political science representative, and the social ills of today were his specialty. The other most important point was that he knew so much gossip that he didn't need to worry that he wouldn't have anything to write about; whether what he wrote was up to standard, however, was another matter.</p>

    <p>But in using a political essay format to write a summer camp diary, he would have to ensure that he remained within bounds; otherwise, he would be held accountable for any deviations in his report in the future.</p>

    <p>"If you can't think of a theme, you can go ask Sun Rong. Her tent's pretty lively since a lot of people have gone to consult her, from our school as well as other schools," Su Xiao said hurriedly when he heard that these two hadn't decided on a subject yet while he was midway through writing his diary.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "Sun Rong?"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "It's natural for Sun Rong to know. Every year, there are experts sent by Huaguo Water Curtain Group in the scientific research team. These experts were from the research institute, and were then employed by Huaguo Water Curtain Group at sky-high salaries. The only level five spirit medicine laboratory in our country was a collaborative setup between Sun Rong's family and the research institute. Every year, Huaguo Water Curtain Group pours a lot of money into breeding spirit plants and refining pills..."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao clicked his tongue non-stop. Going on what Guo Hao had said, it was obvious that Sun Rong usually had access to extra lessons on the side... Besides, Sun Rong would most likely specialize in the field of medicine at university. As the eldest daughter of Huaguo Water Curtain Group, the responsibility she shouldered was in fact very heavy.</p>

    <p>Just then, Guo Hao pushed the tent flap aside and took a look. Sure enough, the outside of Sun Rong's tent was jam-packed with students from various schools. Initially she was already very popular for her good looks. While there were students who had come to ask her questions, there were naturally those who were taking this opportunity to pester her.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao curled his lip. "These people are wasting their time with Sun Rong... I've always felt that Sun Rong has someone she likes." Chen Chao's gaze happened to be on Wang Ling when he said this, which made Wang Ling's hand shake and he snapped his pen...</p>

    <p>Su Xiao: "Sun Rong has someone she likes?"</p>

    <p>"Probably..."</p>

    <p>Actually, Chen Chao wasn't too sure, either. "And I think the guy is in our class."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>While the two of them were talking, Guo Hao came back from outside the tent with a shocked look on his face.</p>

    <p>Su Xiao: "What's wrong?"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "Sun Rong will definitely get full marks for her diary this time... Guess what the title is?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Chen Chao and Su Xiao: "???"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "'My International Top 100 Corporation Father's Guide to Spirit Plants.'"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "..."</p>

    <p>Su Xiao: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Everyone was busy writing in their diaries, but Wang Ling's diary writing wasn't coming along smoothly. It wasn't that he couldn't write, but he somehow felt uneasy while doing it.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, he looked up.</p>

    <p>He had a intense foreboding that Wang Ming was in danger.</p>

    <p>Except for prophetic dreams, all of Wang Ling's danger warnings centered on him. Sometimes, however, there really was a mystical bond between brothers, even if he and Wang Ming were cousins and not biological brothers.</p>

    <p>But in the end, the blood of the Wang family ran through their veins.</p>

    <p>This signal of danger was so strong that it almost immediately made Wang Ling tense up. He quickly looked in the direction of Wang Ming's military tent, and sure enough, he could sense the killing intent which permeated it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was about to get up, but in the next moment, the world before him became crystal clear as he was unexpectedly sucked into a dark space.</p>

    <p>A moment later, there was a golden light, which slowly coalesced in front of Wang Ling and finally took the form of a person he was familiar with.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling hadn't expected the Heavenly Dao golden man to actually appear of his own accord.</p>

    <p>The golden three-inch man: "This is Heavenly Dao space."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sat down cross-legged and stared at this golden three-inch man that was the embodiment of Heavenly Dao. He was a little confused about the golden three-inch man's purpose, and his Mind-Reading Ability didn't work on Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>Because Heavenly Dao itself didn't have feelings.</p>

    <p>The golden three-inch man: "I'm here to warn you, it's best that you don't interfere."</p>

    <p>Chin in hand, Wang Ling instantly understood why the Heavenly Dao had come - he had to be referring to Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>The golden three-inch man: "This is a calamity he has to go through in his life. If he makes it through smoothly, he will be blessed richly. But if external forces interfere, he will encounter even more difficult calamities and troubles in the future. There is never a good outcome if you go against Heaven..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling said telepathically, "So this is a piece of advice?"</p>

    <p>The golden three-inch man: "You can think of it that way... I just hope you don't do anything that you can't come back from, otherwise it'll be too late for regrets."</p>

    <p>For the first time, Wang Ling felt that the Heavenly Dao seemed pretty considerate.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling carefully sized up the golden three-inch man in front of him, and appeared to realize something before he said again telepathically, "You seem different from the Heavenly Dao golden man I've seen."</p>

    <p>The golden three-inch man immediately started sweating. During a meeting that had been held earlier, the Heavenly Dao had already said that this guy was extremely dangerous.</p>

    <p>Now that he was encountering him in the flesh, the golden three-inch man felt even more scared out of his wits.</p>

    <p>After a moment of silence, the golden three-inch man confessed, "The person you've been doing the equivalent exchanges with is my dad."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was shocked: "???" The Heavenly Dao actually had family...</p>

    <p>The golden three-inch man: "My dad should have been the one to come and inform you not to make a move, but he didn't want to, so my granddad beat him up, which is why I'm the one who came."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "You all look the same?"</p>

    <p>The golden three-inch man was quiet for a bit. "Not completely... People call us golden three-inch men, but a lot of them don't know the meaning."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "???"</p>

    <p>The golden three-inch man: "It's true that we're all three inches tall, but our Tower of Babels are different. The older the Heavenly Dao, the longer his Tower of Babel... Of course, it's normally pulled back into the stomach."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
