  <h1>Chapter 962 Exposed</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Zhu Ge's expression instantly froze at these words. For a moment, his mind was completely blank and he didn't know what to say at all. Since last night, he had felt that something wasn't right and that things weren't as simple as he imagined, but he hadn't expected this...</p>

    <p>For a brief moment, it was as if the air had frozen solid. Zhu Ge swallowed his saliva, his Adam's apple bobbing nervously, and he even snuffed out the cigarette in his hand. "Chief Huang, what are you talking about... I don't understand."</p>

    <p>Chief Editor Huang Tao smiled. "Stop pretending, Zhu Ge, I know everything. The documents in this file aren't about your novel, but your identity. Open it and have a look."</p>

    <p>This file was already open, and it was obvious that Chief Editor Huang had already gone through the contents of the report. Zhu Ge's heart trembled slightly as he picked up the file.</p>

    <p>The file contained several sheets of information and a photo. The information contained records of investigation into several IP addresses as well as online purchases.</p>

    <p>To hide his identity, this "Dark Governor Lady Thirteen" was a side account which Zhu Ge had bought from a market dealer in accounts back then. In order to help create the perfect image of a financial group young miss, Zhu Ge had also bought a voice changer app to hide his real identity. The account and the voice changer were shown in the information to have been bought by the same IP address - and this address pointed to Zhu Ge's place.</p>

    <p>Zhu Ge's heart sank. If he wanted to think up an excuse, he could say that these materials were all forged and untrustworthy.</p>

    <p>But what really unsettled him was the picture in the file. To create the image of Dark Governor Lady Thirteen back then, he had even tried showing up in women's clothing... but that crossdressing plan that time was a total failure. He spent twenty thousand yuan on a HD beauty webcam, but there was no way to cover his fat face and obese figure.</p>

    <p>Thus, he abandoned his plan to crossdress on camera, and instead mainly relied on modifying his voice to hide his identity.</p>

    <p>But Zhu Ge had never gone public with his crossdressing and had only tried it in private. This picture was from when he had tried it out back then; from the angle in the picture, it looked like it had been taken by his laptop's webcam...</p>

    <p>"Zhu Ge, you disguised yourself and fooled even me. Actually, not only is there a picture, there is also a video which is currently in my hands. And it's all ironclad evidence." Chief Editor Huang sighed.</p>

    <p>"Chief Huang, I..." Zhu Ge knew that it was all over, and he was powerless to deny it.</p>

    <p>"You know, if the readers find out that Dark Governor Lady Thirteen is fake, it's very possible that they'll doubt our website's fair practices. If this leaks out, our website will suffer for it. Plus, you've committed fraud with this," said Huang Tao.</p>

    <p>"Chief Huang, it's a misunderstanding."</p>

    <p>"Whether it's a misunderstanding or not, you and I know very well. But this anonymous whistleblower left a way out and put forward a suggestion: as long as you follow it, he won't release this information on Lady Thirteen."</p>

    <p>"What does he want me to do..." Zhu Ge's face was already black and his entire body limp, like air escaping a balloon. In his heart, he knew that his situation was hopeless...</p>

    <p>Huang Tao pondered for a while, then said, "First, you can no longer use the Dark Governor Lady Thirteen account from now on."</p>

    <p>"That's not a problem..."</p>

    <p>"And one more thing, Zhu Ge: we're terminating your contract."</p>

    <p>Chief Editor Huang raised his head and said these last words to him.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>So that year, as soon as Wang Situ joined the website, Guru Zhu Ge left in anger. This incident made Father Wang famous on the Cultivation Reading Network (A summary of events can be found in Chapter 74 The Daily Life of Father Wang Seeking Inspiration).</p>

    <p>However, if not for Wang Ling skimming Chen Chao's memories this time, he really wouldn't have known all the bizarre things that happened in the wake of this incident...</p>

    <p>After Zhu Ge's defeat, Liang Huan gained nothing in return for the money which he had invested in the battle for Best Author; this was a heavy blow he had never experienced before. Balance Magic Center's business also got worse.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Chen Chao's dad's body techniques dojo, as the victor, was vigorously promoted by Father Wang; he knew that the results of the monthly votes battle was all because of the great efforts of Father Chen and the other group leaders, for which he was immensely grateful.</p>

    <p>After his victory in the battle for Best Author, Father Wang sent many red packets to the various fan groups to thank all the readers for their support. Furthermore, he burned the midnight oil every day for the next few days to produce tens of thousands of words for his book...</p>

    <p>Although business picked up for Father Chen's body techniques dojo, Father Chen for some reason had a bad feeling.</p>

    <p>The next day was New Year's Day, the first day of the new year, and the dojo was closed.</p>

    <p>But Chen Chao and Wang Xiaoling didn't stop training. They were exercising in the yard in the morning. This set of body-refining exercises had been designed by Father Chen, and he was planning to apply for a patent for it.</p>

    <p>Father Chen said that practicing the body exercises which he had designed himself was more useful than practicing military boxing. He recalled how there had been something online previously about a college student who practiced military boxing that hadn't collapsed even after being stabbed thirty-two times while he was subduing a hoodlum. Father Chen felt that anyone who practiced his body exercises would no longer need to worry about being stabbed at all!</p>

    <p>Strength Super Basic Body-Refining Exercises!</p>

    <p>See results after practicing one set! You won't cry even after being stabbed!</p>

    <p>Practicing two sets will work magic! You won't be afraid of a second stab!</p>

    <p>Wang Xiaoling had only started training a few days ago and was still a little uncoordinated, while Chen Chao had been doing these body exercises for a long time. They were almost the same age with Chen Chao being a few months older. Wang Xiaoling clumsily imitated Chen Chao from behind, and he deliberately slowed down so that she could follow his movements.</p>

    <p>"Xiaoling, Chen Chao?"</p>

    <p>Halfway through practice, Xiaoling's mom's voice came from outside the gated entrance.</p>

    <p>"Aunt!" Chen Chao and Wang Xiaoling hurried over.</p>

    <p>"I bought some fruit pancakes from West Street this morning. You haven't had breakfast, right?" Xiao Ling's mom passed them the two fruit pancakes and two cups of soybean milk which she had bought.</p>

    <p>"Not yet, my dad's making it now." Chen Chao accepted the food and ate it with a smile. "Aunt, won't you come in?"</p>

    <p>"No, no, I'll come tomorrow! Today - today I still have something to do." Xiaoling's mom turned him down.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao found her tone a little strange. The fence was a little high and the plants next to it blocked his view a little, so he couldn't clearly make out Xiaoling's mom's face. Unperturbed, he looked for an angle in the fence and peered through the crack.</p>

    <p>When he saw Xiaoling's mom's face, he instantly knew why she was reluctant to come in.</p>

    <p>Her face was full of bruises.</p>

    <p>Although she was wearing a face mask, it couldn't completely cover such severe bruises.</p>

    <p>Who on earth had done this?</p>

    <p>Was it Tiger Liang's side?</p>

    <p>Chen Chao made a guess.</p>
