  <h1>Chapter 167 Ling Zhenren's Family Cat Is Missing </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Just like this, the glorious part-timers had become scapegoats once again <sup>1</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The government and business
companies are infamous for
using this excuse in the event
of a mishap.)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling knew that this was the standard response practiced by Huaxiu government departments, like when Huaxiu nation's Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly condemned or protested something. This was a carefully-worded excuse that, like a panacea, could be used to reply to all kinds of interview questions.</p>

    <p>Although the girl's escape from prison was all that the news could talk about, there was very little about it online. Wang Ling opened several news apps and found very few comments related to this incident. It was very obvious that, just like with the matter of Mother Wang being groped, anything related to this incident was being suppressed...</p>

    <p>Warden Liang had downplayed it on TV. But watching the news report, Wang Ling somehow had a bad feeling.</p>

    <p>His eyelid twitched again, and this time, the disaster level was three stars...</p>

    <p>Thus, even though Wang Ling was at home and wasn't going anywhere this Saturday, he had a nagging sense of uneasiness. The frequent twitching of his eyelid made him a little anxious.</p>

    <p>After breaking out of prison, what would that fugitive girl do?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling lay on his bed with both arms crossed under his head, his thoughts in turmoil.</p>

    <p>For the time being, after escaping prison, it was clearly not possible for her to seek revenge against Number 59 High School and Number 60 High School. Most of the students were already on vacation, and even if she dropped in to make trouble, there were still many teachers on duty in school who definitely wouldn't leave this Shadow Stream killer any opening for attack. Going after Wang Ming sounded even more unreasonable. Huaxiu nation's top leaders all knew about the "love-hate" relationship between this super brain and this Shadow Stream maiden; after the news of her escape had come out, they would have undoubtedly already dispatched more people to protect Wang Ming at all costs.</p>

    <p>So the only party left whom she could take revenge on in the short term was Black Tan...</p>

    <p>When a person had no outlet for their anger, they would naturally look for a soft persimmon to pound.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that Zheng Tan was now in danger.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling transformed himself into a white Persian cat and appeared under that old willow tree in Number 59 High School. Given the urgency of the situation, he had directly teleported there.</p>

    <p>He carefully felt out his surroundings, but it was silent all around. Lying down at the tree hole, he couldn't sense a trace of any aura inside. Whether it was the commander-in-chief, First Battalion Commander The Monk, or the cavalry, the infantry, and the air force under Zheng Tan, they were all gone.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling opened his eyes and used his Heavenly Eye flashback ability. The scene in front of his eyes began to rewind, but it didn't give him much information.</p>

    <p>What he could confirm was that Black Tan had left at least half an hour ago. Also, he had come out in full force; the entire army had sallied forth, armed to the teeth with all the weapons they had in the hole — even that Yidali Cannon was gone.</p>

    <p>What on earth were they going to do?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was very worried about Zheng Tan's safety.</p>

    <p>Using an aura search, he could confirm that Zheng Tan and his group were already far away from Peiyuan district. It had been more than twelve hours since they had left the tree hole, much earlier than he had imagined. Now there was only one way left for him to find Zheng Tan...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In a mysterious lab on the border of Huaxiu nation, a man in black skintight clothes was absorbed in his research. He held in his hands a blueprint for the Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon.</p>

    <p>After his lab had been destroyed the last time, Little Black had been trying to restore this cannon which he had painstakingly created. Once he got word from Lord Diulei, he would take the cannon with him to the house of the bastard who had ruined his lab and blow it up!</p>

    <p>While Little Black was recalculating the cannon's muzzle velocity, a hand suddenly pressed down on his shoulder, making him tremble from head to toe in fear. "Who?!"</p>

    <p>This time, Little Black saw a young man in a white short-sleeved shirt standing behind him. "Who are you?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling spoke telepathically as he identified himself.</p>

    <p>Little Black was shocked. "You're Ling Zhenren?"</p>

    <p>This time, Wang Ling didn't have to deliberately cover up his face. The last time he had been here, he hadn't known the relationship between Little Black and Lord Diulei. Now that he knew Little Black was on their side, there was no need for him to hide himself.</p>

    <p>To verify that he was truly Ling Zhenren, Wang Ling even shared a meme of Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>He had secretly taken this photo when he was with Lord Diulei, just in case of a situation like this.</p>

    <p>Looking at the photo in which Lord Diulei smiled like a blooming chrysanthemum, Little Black's doubts about this youngster's identity was thoroughly dispelled... only when he was with Ling Zhenren would this cultivation forum owner smile like an idiot like this.</p>

    <p>"So you're Ling Zhenren... my apologies!" Little Black excitedly clasped his fists in a salute. So this was the big shot who would help him track down the bastard who had destroyed his lab! He actually looked so young!</p>

    <p>"Is there a reason why Ling Zhenren is looking for me?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't beat around the bush, but straightaway took out a quick sketch of Zheng Tan which he had prepared beforehand along with the specific location of that willow tree. "Can you find it?"</p>

    <p>Looking at the sketch of Zheng Tan, it dawned on Little Black that Ling Zhenren's cat was missing!</p>

    <p>But... why would it show up in such a strange location? Did big shots in the cultivation world now let their pets have free range?</p>

    <p>Little Black politely didn't ask too many questions.</p>

    <p>From the coordinates Wang Ling had given him, Little Black easily located the willow and managed to hack into nearby surveillance cameras.</p>

    <p>This time, Wang Ling finally had a lead.</p>

    <p>Zheng Tan and its group had set off at around eight o'clock last night, and each cat had had an invisibility talisman on it. As Wang Ling had guessed, they had taken all their weapons with them when they had left the tree hole... it was clear that they were off to do battle!</p>

    <p>From the monitor screen, Wang Ling's Heavenly Eye could clearly see the confident expression on Zheng Tan's black face; this guy was actually smiling!</p>

    <p>But what kind of battle would justify Zheng Tan mobilizing the power of all its troops?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's initial worry turned to curiosity.</p>

    <p>Little Black was truly Little Black, an existence that could make something good out of something bad when it came to the online network. Just from Zheng Tan's route trajectory from where it had set off, he had been able to calculate what Zheng Tan's final destination was — Songhai City Dahuang International Airport.</p>

    <p>Airport...</p>

    <p>Whether it was Little Black or Wang Ling, both of them were completely astonished.</p>

    <p>Little Black hacked into the airport's ticketing system to check the transaction records for that day, and finally discovered a set of very strange data. After analyzing it, he had a disbelieving expression on his face. "Ling Zhenren... your family cat is too amazing! It actually chartered a plane!"</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling was stunned by Zheng Tan's action.</p>

    <p>A black cat, taking all of its subordinates and equipment with it, and even chartering a plane... what the hell was it trying to do? Attack Ping'an country <sup>2</sup> ?</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(In the TV series 'Drawing
Sword,' Ping'an is the name of
the country which the
protagonist attacks using the
Yidali Cannon ..)</dfn>
