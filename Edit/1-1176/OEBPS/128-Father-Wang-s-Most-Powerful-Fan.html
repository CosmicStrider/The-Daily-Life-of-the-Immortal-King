  <h1>Chapter 128 Father Wang's Most Powerful Fan </h1>

  <div>

    <p>When Mo Immortal Castle was founded back then, it had had to rely on Green Gang for a very long time to build its own intelligence network in Songhai city.</p>

    <p>In the last few years, Green Gang's value to Mo Immortal Castle had fallen, and their relationship was not as close as it used to be.</p>

    <p>When two forces met to begin with, their relationship would be based on mutual exploitation; once that balance was broken, the relationship would also fall apart.</p>

    <p>As leader of Green Gang, Zhou Jie was naturally very clear on this point. Thus, for the future development of the Green Gang, he had also quietly expanded his intelligence grid over the years, trying to secure the throne as the top underground intelligence network in Songhai city. But in the last few years, Mo Immortal Castle had really grown too rapidly.</p>

    <p>But even if it was hard to compete with that power on the surface, Zhou Jie had still found another way. He had gotten information about the stone ghost mask by chance. Furthermore, he knew that Mo Immortal Castle had been looking for the maker of the stone ghost mask for many years.</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu involuntarily swallowed his saliva; indeed, this proposal sounded very attractive.</p>

    <p>On the other end, Zhou Jie knew that the situation was hopeful, and he continued with a smile, "Brother Song, you only need to think of a way to control public opinion and suppress the Weibo post... I only have this one younger cousin, I must protect him no matter what!"</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu sighed. "I admit your proposal is very tempting. But you should know that the head of the Exploding Sky Sect has already made a move, so even if our Mo Immortal Castle gets involved..."</p>

    <p>Zhou Jie interrupted him. "Brother Song, I can only rely on you for this. It'll be good enough if you can reduce the impact of this issue as much as possible! Of course, whether it works or not in the end, I'll still tell you everything I know about the maker of the stone ghost mask."</p>

    <p>This was a very sensible remark, and Song Qingshu nodded with satisfaction. "Very well, I'll do my best."</p>

    <p>He hung up after that, and then was at a loss.</p>

    <p>In the end, who was it better to look for?</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu thought for a while before finally picking up the phone again to quickly dial a string of numbers. "It's me, Song Qingshu. Help put me through to Mayor Ding..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>While the mohawk's older cousin, leader of Green Gang, called Song Qingshu for help, the battle on Weibo continued.</p>

    <p>It was already a full four hours after the start of the incident; it was almost midnight, but Weibo was still as busy as if it was daytime.</p>

    <p>Things had gotten more and more serious. Father Wang's trending post "Wang Situ in a Fury over a Beauty" had already been certified "Hot" by Weibo — how a weak female should react and defend herself when she encountered a wandering hand had become a popular topic for discussion.</p>

    <p>Netizens forwarded the post and were sympathetic; even the keyboard warriors stayed up late — all of them found incomparable satisfaction from being a part of this hype.</p>

    <p>But soon, someone posted an online message and also sent a string of angry emoji expressions. "Strange! My comment on the post is gone! Even the reader count in the upper right corner of my last few posts have all turned gray."</p>

    <p>This net friend shared a screenshot, expressing their dissatisfaction.</p>

    <p>A comment quickly popped up below it. "I thought I was the only one whose Weibo post was locked! So there were other people with the same problem!"</p>

    <p>"Shit! So it's not just me!"</p>

    <p>"I worked so hard to type out such a long post, why is it locked?! Support Guru Wang Situ!"</p>

    <p>This definitely wasn't netizens stirring up trouble for no reason, because Father Wang had also noticed something; he found that the number of thumb-ups and comments on his post were decreasing steadily. After four hours, a total of nearly two hundred thousand thumbs-ups before... was now only a hundred and ten thousand after he refreshed the page! That was half the amount!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling also realized that many online comments had disappeared.</p>

    <p>Previously, some people had sent several addresses for doxxing but which had yet to be properly verified. However, all of it had been deleted by Weibo on the basis that it was "prohibited information."</p>

    <p>It was very obvious that someone was deliberately blocking the messages and trying to keep the heat down.</p>

    <p>Father Wang patiently waited for fifteen minutes in front of the computer, then saw that the "Hot" word next to his post title as a hot search item had already disappeared. Even its ranking had dropped two levels, and he helplessly watched as it fell from Trending Topic 1 to Trending Topic 3.</p>

    <p>In the study, he sat in front of his computer screen, the ashtray on his table already overflowing with cigarette butts.</p>

    <p>He had already smoked all the cigarettes in his cigarette pack.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was wondering whether he should use his teleport ability to go to the supermarket and buy a pack for him.</p>

    <p>After all, this was the only thing that he as a son could do for his dad while Father Wang relied on his own strength to search for that mohawk scumbag.</p>

    <p>But very quickly, Wang Ling realized that he had been overthinking it.</p>

    <p>Because he saw Father Wang stand up and directly pick up an iron box off the bookshelf next to him. Inside the box were ten black cigars. Father Wang straightaway lit one up and put it in his mouth.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's heart couldn't help but shiver a little... he realized that Father Wang's evil temperament was about to get worse!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the study, Father Wang puffed on his cigar.</p>

    <p>As Wang Ling stared at it, he slowly started to recall that this box of cigars had been a gift which some fan had sent a few months earlier. At that time, Father Wang had still been in the study typing, so it was Wang Ling who had come downstairs to help him sign for the express delivery, hence why he had a vague impression of it.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling hadn't paid it any mind back then and hadn't cared about what was in the box.</p>

    <p>And when Father Wang had received the iron box, he had put it on the bookshelf, where it had remained ever since.</p>

    <p>It didn't look like a famous or expensive brand from the external packaging, but the texture inside each cigar was extremely special!</p>

    <p>Using his Heavenly Eye, Wang Ling could see that this single cigar contained more than three hundred types of precious celestial treasures. Among them, he could actually even detect the faint smell of "auspicious dragon grass"! This was a restricted-grade panacea grown in Huaxiu nation; it had the ability to bring a person back to life, and was currently also used all over the world as an efficacious drug for dealing with cancer! Just a little bit of this panacea could purify the body of all cancer cells!</p>

    <p>It was very obvious that these cigars had all been specially custom-made by that fan! To be able to use auspicious dragon grass as a cigar ingredient — what kind of person was this?</p>

    <p>While Wang Ling was still puzzling over this, Father Wang had already finished half the cigar.</p>

    <p>As he had expected, someone was now trying to block the messages on Weibo, and the topic "Wang Situ in a Fury over a Beauty" had just fallen several more places and was going to drop out of the top ten.</p>

    <p>"Everyone, forward the post again! Help Guru Wang Situ! It's fallen in the ranking again!"</p>

    <p>"This Weibo is real scum! Black operations <sup>1</sup> ! Shameless scum!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>('Black operations' refer to
backdoor dealings or covert
manipulation behind the
scenes.)</dfn>

    <p>"I forward! Forward angrily! Forward it again! I don't believe it can continue to drop with almost five hundred thousand forwards... robbed of first place by a shampoo ad! Who is it that gives you this confidence?! Rejoice <sup>2</sup> ?!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(One of Rejoice Shampoo's
taglines is 'confidence that
comes from smooth and shiny
hair .. ')</dfn>

    <p>These net friends all felt that it was unfair to Father Wang, but someone was clearly pulling some strings behind the scenes, and they were helpless to do anything...</p>

    <p>Reading these online comments, Father Wang felt his blood pressure rise.</p>

    <p>Black operations?</p>

    <p>No way!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw Father Wang turn the iron box over and open the back.</p>

    <p>His eyebrows twitched... it turned out that the cigar box could be opened on both ends, and there was a small compartment at the back!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling then saw Father Wang take out a black cellphone which he had never seen before from the back of the cigar box.</p>

    <p>There was only one number in the phone's contacts.</p>

    <p>Father Wang didn't even have to think about it before he directly made a call.</p>

    <p>A moment later, Father Wang's voice sounded. "It's me, Wang Situ. Please put me through to the head of state..."</p>
