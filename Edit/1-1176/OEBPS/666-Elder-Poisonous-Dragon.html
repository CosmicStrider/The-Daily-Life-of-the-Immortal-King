  <h1>Chapter 666 Elder Poisonous Dragon</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Xiao Yin thought that this setting was genius! Furthermore, he could write this toilet seat not only as All For One, but as One For All <sup>1</sup> also! He could set up the protagonist's toilet seat as a family heirloom, and every generation, the successor to the toilet seat would have a Heavenly Dao. As the three thousandth successor, the protagonist would directly grasp three thousand Heavenly Dao! It would be utterly heaven-defying!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The "One For All" quirk in "My Hero Academia" allows the wielder to access the powers of the previous quirk wielders ..)</dfn>

    <p>"Oh, no! Thunder, all my ideas are pouring out now! I'm going to go write after I finish eating!" Xiao Yin stood up and swallowed the broccoli in his mouth, traces of salad dressing still at the corners of his lips.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei silently took out a tissue and helped wiped Xiao Yin's mouth clean.</p>

    <p>The urge to write was like this sometimes. Most of the time, newcomers who just entered the circle would in fact be struck with this urge, and this was often how superior masterpieces came about. Anything written without this burst of inspiration or passion wouldn't be good.</p>

    <p>Although Lord Diulei had never written a complete work himself, he firmly believed in this.</p>

    <p>"Ah! Not good! I can't take it anymore!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin really couldn't take it anymore. Before he finished the broccoli in his salad basin, he already couldn't help standing up and getting in position, as if he was going to jump right up to the second floor. Seeing this, Lord Diulei hurriedly threw himself forward to press down on Xiao Yin's shoulders with a death grip, looking a little like he had just narrowly escaped some horror. "Take the stairs!"</p>

    <p>There had already been several instances when Xiao Yin had smashed open holes in the villa to go up and down more quickly.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Not long after Xiao Yin went upstairs, Lord Diulei turned around to clear the table. Because Xiao Yin had an especially enormous appetite, the broccoli salad had been tossed together in a basin. Watching a person eat a lot always whet the appetite, so Lord Diulei's own appetite had inadvertently increased lately.</p>

    <p>It was a good thing broccoli was a vegetable; you wouldn't get fat from eating a lot of it. Besides, the most important thing was that Lord Diulei had realized that he and Xiao Yin had the kind of physique where they wouldn't get fat from eating!</p>

    <p>Cleaning the dishes wasn't particularly troublesome; the main thing was your mood. There were times when Lord Diulei was even happy to wash them by hand instead of directly using some cleaning talisman or other. For a modern cultivator, a single cleaning talisman could handle any type of cleaning, so washing clothes or dishes by hand had conversely become a type of indulgence.</p>

    <p>But he had some important tasks to deal with today, so Lord Diulei in the end still chose to use a cleaning talisman to clean the dishes.</p>

    <p>This type of talisman wasn't expensive and was cheaper to buy in bulk than a year's worth of detergent. This was because the pattern on the talisman was relatively simple, and it was one of the few talismans on the market currently that could be directly machine-manufactured; attack or defense talismans in fact needed to be handwritten.</p>

    <p>"I wonder how Brother Toya is doing with the matter of that girl in gray."</p>

    <p>Done with the dishes, Lord Diulei recalled the girl in gray, whom they were trying to rouse on Chrysanthemum Island. Cailian Zhenren had also gone over. As for the girl's identity, Lord Diulei was currently trying to figure it out.</p>

    <p>Their only lead was the gray traditional garment she wore, which had a simple pattern on it. To discover the girl's real identity, he could only start with this garment and investigate its exact age and origin before he could determine who on earth the girl was.</p>

    <p>But this wasn't an easy thing to do. Last night, he had used his side account to post some images of the pattern on this traditional garment on the cultivation forum as he looked for help.</p>

    <p>He didn't include photos of the girl; even pictures of the garment weren't taken clearly or as a full view. Lord Diulei just wanted to try asking around in the forum; who knew, some big shot passing by might recognize it.</p>

    <p>He estimated that he should have gotten plenty of responses in the forum by this time, and was just about to have a look when Zhuo Yi suddenly gave him a call.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei answered the phone right away. "Brother Zhuo? What's up?"</p>

    <p>"I was attacked on my way to work. It was the Demon Hunters Association!" said Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>"What's the situation?" Lord Diulei took a deep breath, utterly calm.</p>

    <p>Although Zhuo Yi said he had been attacked, the fact that he was able to make this call now indicated that the attacker had probably already been dealt with.</p>

    <p>"Fortunately, <em>shifu </em>sent Lord Jingke in time, otherwise the consequences would have been unimaginable." Zhuo Yi sighed and told Lord Diulei what he knew for now. "They've gathered together a group of returnee cultivators who studied ninjutsu on Sun Island, and plan to launch a revenge attack on Number 60 High tomorrow..."</p>

    <p>"Then why were they after you?"</p>

    <p>"I'm also the scapegoat... ah, no, the commander in charge of the Demon Hunters Association affair! Of course they want to get even with me!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Besides, I'm a senior of Number 60 High. The attacker's objective was to capture me alive, and then take me to Number 60 High tomorrow to be publicly executed," said Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Lord Diulei sweated profusely.</p>

    <p>This gang was too vicious, actually just doing whatever they wanted!</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "I called to warn you to be careful today, Senior Immortal. Since that elder was able to find me, you might also be included in his revenge plan..."</p>

    <p>"Okay, thank you, Brother Zhuo! I'll be careful!" Lord Diulei nodded and hung up.</p>

    <p>Just as he put down the phone, he suddenly felt cold killing intent rush straight for his back behind him.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Wasn't this too fast?!</p>

    <p>He turned around, and sure enough, he saw a man standing in the courtyard on the first floor. The man's features and his ears were very sharp, and he had a slim figure. His eyes were at half-mast and revealed extremely cold killing intent. The scariest thing was how the corners of the other party's mouth were stretched back until they practically almost reached his ears.</p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon gave a horrible smile. "Excuse me, your Excellency, are you Great Death-Courting Senior?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Who are you?"</p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon didn't say anything. The next moment, he held out his right hand, which abruptly extended forward like a screw! In flashes of strange purple lightning, it passed through the garden and drilled open a big hole in Lord Diulei's chest!</p>

    <p>When Elder Poisonous Dragon withdrew his hand, he still had that weird smile on his face and his hand was covered in dark red blood.</p>

    <p>He licked the blood on his hand and looked at "Great Death-Courting Senior" and the big hole he had made in front of him. He sneered cruelly. "It's said that villains who talk too much die... I'm different. Once I've confirmed your identity, I'll act right away without hesitation! Remember my name, it's Poisonous Dragon."</p>

    <p>He then directly stepped into the house from the garden and fixed his gaze on the second floor.</p>

    <p>There was still one more person there whom he needed to take care of...</p>

    <p>But just as he was about to move, a hand suddenly fell on Elder Poisonous Dragon's shoulder.</p>

    <p>This hand belonged to none other than Lord Diulei!</p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon was thunderstruck. "You..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei grinned. "Sorry, seeing you talk to yourself for so long just now, I didn't want to interrupt, so I played dead for a bit on the ground. So it turns out your name is Poisonous Dragon!"</p>

    <p>"Impossible! How can you still be alive?!"</p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon felt it was inconceivable as he exclaimed loudly, "I clearly pierced and broke you open directly from the front!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was also alarmed. "Bloody hell... It's broad daylight, keep your voice down! I'm an upstanding young man from a good family, I'm still pure!"</p>
