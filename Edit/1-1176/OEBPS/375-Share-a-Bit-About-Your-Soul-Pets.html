  <h1>Chapter 375 Share a Bit About Your Soul Pets </h1>

  <div>

    <p>After finding out about Xiao Yin's miserable experience, Wang Ling was speechless for a good while... When all was said and done, Xiao Yin was a holy beast and was too honest; it would have been strange if no one had noticed him cutting his wrist and bleeding himself in broad daylight. If he had cast an invisibility spell or set up a boundary, things wouldn't have become this troublesome.</p>

    <p>Thanks to this unexpected incident, it appeared that the holy beast blood would be delayed for two days.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed in his heart, but he didn't actually need it that urgently. After merging with its current body, Er Ha's soul was in fact still going through a long period of adaptation; in addition to the fact that Er Ha was cultivating the new version of the "Demon King Heart Sutra," symptoms like being fond of sleeping were a sign that its body was still adapting.</p>

    <p>The holy beast blood would act like a catalyst which could substantially reduce the time needed for the body and soul to align with each other.</p>

    <p>This wasn't a situation unique to Er Ha; when a soul entered a brand new body, it would always need quite some time to break it in. This was unavoidable, like when the old devil had borrowed the body of the Master of Shadow Stream, or such as in the case of the takeout delivery little brothers whose bodies had suffered at the hands of the old devil back then; although the insurance companies had created new "lotus root bodies" for each of them, it wasn't that easy to truly get used to them.</p>

    <p>For these takeout delivery little brothers, even the simple act of shaking hands and hugging at the very beginning had had to be done gingerly since these lotus root bodies were especially fragile before they were broken in - one careless mistake and an arm could snap off, trailing a long lotus root fiber... just thinking about it was horrifying.</p>

    <p>It was now already past eight o'clock in the evening. After doing a bit of revision, Wang Ling then couldn't resist taking out his watch.</p>

    <p>Electronic gadgets nowadays were really evil; people were unable to control themselves and would take them out at all times for a look.</p>

    <p>That morning, the thing with the Society of Saints had yet to become widespread, and it had only circulated within the school.</p>

    <p>But now, Wang Ling was surprised to discover that this Society of Saints was already a hot search topic online and was mentioned by all the major news media outlets, and even in WeChat Moments and special top trending topics.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling didn't click on anything, and instead chose to ignore them.</p>

    <p>Afterwards, he opened the class group chat, and predictably, it was flooded. His classmates had grown increasingly passionate in the discussion on the Society of Saints, as if every one of them was an unusual talent that would be signed by the society any minute now.</p>

    <p>After all, a recommendation for university admission was just too tempting.</p>

    <p>After graduating from high school, if you could smoothly enter the university you wanted to get into, you had for the most part succeeded in life. As mentioned before, it didn't take long at all for a modern cultivator to advance from the Foundation Establishment stage to the Golden Core stage; as long as you were talented enough and had sufficient resources, there wouldn't be any problem making a breakthrough in just a few years. But advancing from the Golden Core stage to the Nascent Soul stage wasn't the same; during this period, you would need a very good life coach, and you could only encounter this sort of person at top universities.</p>

    <p>Of course... Wang Ling felt that all of this had nothing to do with him.</p>

    <p>While he was surfing online, Teacher Ye suddenly sent him a private message: "Student Wang Ling, this is the entry form for the battle of soul pets. Please fill it out and send it to me when you have the time. There are examples inside the form which you can refer to - these are the combat spirit beasts which the other schools have already entered into the competition; you can take a closer look at them."</p>

    <p>After that, Teacher Ye straightaway sent him the digital form. "Oh, by the way, Student Wang Ling, every spirit beast taking part in the battle needs to have a qualification certificate. The next time you're at school, just give me a copy of the credentials."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>To be honest, if it hadn't been for Teacher Ye, Wang Ling would have completely forgotten all about this.</p>

    <p>Until now, Er Ha had yet to be assessed by a regulatory organization!</p>

    <p>But it sounded like a hassle; Er Ha could go do it itself...</p>

    <p>After that, Wang Ling opened the form and went straight to the last few pages.</p>

    <p>These were Number 59 High School and Reliance High School's entries into the "battle of soul pets" event in the district sports meet. Both schools had already selected spirit beasts suitable for combat.</p>

    <p>These two spirit beasts belonged to students in each school respectively. The combat spirit beast which Number 59 High School was sending out was a gorilla named Jinbei, and its owner happened to be that famous delinquent senior He Bufeng who had turned over a new leaf.</p>

    <p>The form contained all the information on Jinbei.</p>

    <p>Name: Jinbei</p>

    <p>Age: 300 years</p>

    <p>Level: Fourth-class Spirit Beast</p>

    <p>Species: Goldenback Gorilla</p>

    <p>Character: Docile, Friendly with people</p>

    <p>Likes: Bananas</p>

    <p>Special Traits: When it sees bananas, it will enter a state of sustained violence</p>

    <p>After he finished reading the information, Wang Ling found a photo of Jinbei in the top right corner of the form. Although the goldenback gorilla was three hundred years old, it was considered a teenager in its clan. Soul pets generally had contracts, and often this soul pet contract could be passed down through the bloodline.</p>

    <p>Hence, Wang Ling speculated that this gorilla had probably been handed down in He Bufeng's family.</p>

    <p>Actually, there were a lot of goldenback gorillas in the world of spirit beasts, so they weren't exactly rare. But in the world of soul pets, they were priceless since few people would keep a gorilla as a pet at home.</p>

    <p>Also as a sidenote, this confirmed that He Bufeng's family situation was actually pretty good, though one couldn't tell to what extent.</p>

    <p>Apart from the goldenback gorilla that He Bufeng had offered up this time, Reliance High School had also put forward a pretty savage spirit beast, a land shark.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, it was a third-class beast!</p>

    <p>The owner was one of the three Tree brothers whom Teacher Ye had mentioned previously, Aluminum Tree.</p>

    <p>Land sharks were amphibious and quite rare among aggressive-type spirit beasts. Despite that, however, they were very easy to tame. If you could raise a land shark pup from a young age, feeding it meat and potato chips every day, it would become unwaveringly devoted to you.</p>

    <p>While land sharks were certainly very strong, they had a major flaw, and that was that they ate a tremendous amount. This spirit beast breed really liked to eat, and not only that, they were also very picky. There was no way that a regular family would be able to raise this thing.</p>

    <p>Looking at the form, Wang Ling sighed in his heart; it turned out that his two opponents this time were rich big shots!</p>

    <p>In contrast, Wang Ling felt that Er Ha was really easy to raise and also wasn't big in size; in addition to being easy to carry around, it didn't eat so much - the most important thing was that when you were tired from doing your homework, that green fur would always give you an overflowing sense of spring...</p>

    <p>Thinking about this, Wang Ling scrolled through the form and took a look at the specific data on the land shark.</p>

    <p>Name: Aluminum Small Fish</p>

    <p>Age: 233 years</p>

    <p>Level: Third-class Spirit Beast</p>

    <p>Character: Likes water, Going for walks, Tasty, Savage</p>

    <p>Likes: All kinds of meat and potato chips</p>

    <p>Special Traits: It can't move without food</p>

    <p>Species: Seafood...</p>
