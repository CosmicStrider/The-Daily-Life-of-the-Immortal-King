  <h1>Chapter 156 I Don't Want This Gift! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was June 2nd on Wednesday in the sixth week of the semester.</p>

    <p>After a busy night yesterday, Wang Ling had thought about a lot of things.</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu had used a lead on the maker of the stone ghost mask as a bargaining chip in order to forcefully hug their thighs. Wang Ling really loathed this type of behavior because he always felt it would be very troublesome.</p>

    <p>In fact, he had been opposed to it from the very beginning.</p>

    <p>However, his eyelid warning had persistently reminded him that if he dismissed this issue, even bigger problems would arise.</p>

    <p>Hence, everything he had done in the end was just out of sheer helplessness.</p>

    <p>Whether he accepted the situation or not, either option was troublesome. Given this was the case, the only choice Wang Ling had was to cut his losses in order to prevent the situation from becoming worse.</p>

    <p>And the other thing was this Immortal Mansion...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had very limited knowledge of the powers present in the cultivation world because he had never bothered at all to learn about these trivial matters. It was Lord Diulei who had told him a lot about how the forces were distributed.</p>

    <p>The cultivation world was currently split between the light and dark forces.</p>

    <p>The light forces were sects with business licenses. In addition to accepting disciples and receiving tuition fees, these sects also had an independent spirit grass cultivation base so that they could be self-sufficient as well as sell for profit. Of course, the light forces also acknowledged the Huaxiu government's central authority, and the sects were open and transparent about their state of affairs. Disciples were only accepted into the sects after they had completed their compulsory state education and had cultivated independently for at least a hundred years. At a basic level, there hence was no conflict of interest between the government's Education Department and the light forces.</p>

    <p>As for the dark forces, to sum them up in one phrase... they were unlicensed sects. Huaxiu nation's attitude toward such powers had always been to crack down hard on them and punish them severely.</p>

    <p>As the owner of the cultivation forum and cultivation chat group, Lord Diulei was in contact with every single light force. He was well aware of how the powers were distributed, so if it was a power he had never heard of before, it had to be one of the dark forces.</p>

    <p>Ah Zuo and Ah You had been hired by the Lady of Mo Immortal Castle as mercenaries. Perhaps they weren't crucial existences in Immortal Mansion's chain of power. Yet these two peripheral figures had Soul Formation realms. Furthermore, they were able to refine parts of their own bodies into magic weapons.</p>

    <p>It could only be said that, as an unlicensed dark force, the power behind Immortal Mansion was truly incomprehensible.</p>

    <p>After dealing with the items scattered on the ground, Song Qingshu had followed Lord Diulei back to Wenxian Garden. For the time being, he would work as the latter's assistant to investigate this issue. After Third Saint, he was the second person to betray Mo Immortal Castle.</p>

    <p>After they left, Wang Ling had looked at the time — it was nearly three o'clock in the morning, but he still had had quite a few exercise sheets which he had yet to finish!</p>

    <p>The biggest headache was that the content of these exercises as prepared by Teacher Pan was not covered in the syllabus! Wang Ling had had to spend five or six minutes previewing the material before he could get his pen and eraser gremlins to help him finish the homework!</p>

    <p>As a precious sixteen-year-old baby, he really felt very tired in his heart!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling arrived at class in the morning, for the first time today, there was nobody copying homework. Even Chen Chao and Guo Hao, the two damn nerds who always played games together all night, handed in their homework on time.</p>

    <p>There was definitely something fishy going on. Given what Wang Ling knew about these two people since meeting them, something was definitely wrong for them to suddenly become so diligent!</p>

    <p>He read their memories and found out why.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong hadn't come to school today.</p>

    <p>This was because the Grade One students at Number 60 High School would be participating in the military training in the middle of this month, and when Number 59 High School had heard this, the two headmasters had discussed it and then decided to simply have their military training together and conveniently promote friendship between the two schools. Thus, Sun Rong had been sent to Number 59 High School for the time being as a way of fostering links between the two schools beforehand.</p>

    <p>In exchange, Number 59 High School would also send a student to Number 60 High School as an exchange student to experience the difference in culture between the two schools.</p>

    <p>The two headmasters had completely decided this themselves first without notifying anyone else. It was only at the teachers' morning meeting yesterday that everyone had been notified, so most of the students were still in the dark about it.</p>

    <p>But as a class representative, Guo Hao was often in and out of the teacher's office, and thus had learned about the situation first... this was also the reason why two people in particular hadn't copied homework in class this morning.</p>

    <p>Because, they had heard that the exchange student from Number 59 High School was also its school beauty. It would be too disgraceful if they were caught copying homework by this school beauty!</p>

    <p>"I wonder who Number 59 High School will send..." Chen Chao cupped his chin as he stared at the classroom door, eagerly awaiting the person of his dreams to show up.</p>

    <p>There were not a few school beauties in Number 59 High School. Though they didn't have Sun Rong's lethal magnetic field that could draw in passerbys, the male students in Grade One, Class Three had actually grown a little too used to Sun Rong after being exposed to her for so long. Most critically, Sun Rong was too far away for them... this was a girl whom they had no hope of being with at all.</p>

    <p>In contrast, the ordinary school beauty from Number 59 High School might be more their type.</p>

    <p>It wasn't long before they heard Teacher Pan's footsteps in the corridor.</p>

    <p>"She's here, she's here!" Guo Hao's pupils contracted slightly.</p>

    <p>From afar, he could perceive that there were two auras next to Teacher Pan...</p>

    <p>Was this... two exchange students?</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan paused when she reached the classroom door, and turned to address the two exchange students. "Don't be nervous, our Grade One, Class Three students are very friendly; from now until the military training, I hope your time here at Number 60 High School will be a rewarding one."</p>

    <p>After that, Teacher Pan walked straight into the classroom.</p>

    <p>And stepping into Grade One, Class Three behind her were the two students from Number 59 High School.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao and Guo Hao almost flipped their desks — it turned out to be two male students!</p>

    <p>Fuck!!! We used our top school beauty in Number 60 High School in the exchange! Why do we get just these two things?!</p>

    <p>As for these two male students, they could be considered old acquaintances of Number 60 High School and were even associated with Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>Standing on the dais, Teacher Pan happily introduced the two students from Number 59 High School. "Students, let me introduce them to you. On the left is Student He Bufeng. On the right is Student Tang Jingze... let's give them a round of applause!"</p>

    <p>Papapapa...</p>

    <p>After a moment of token clapping, Guo Hao couldn't help asking doubtfully, "Teacher Pan, these two students don't seem to be Grade One students... is that really okay?"</p>

    <p>"It's like this... due to personal reasons, Student He Bufeng has never participated in the school military training before, so he'll be taking part in the military training with the Grade One students this time round. As for Student Tang Jingze..." Teacher Pan pushed up her glasses. "Because we sent Student Sun Rong to Number 59 High School, Headmaster Jin felt that it wasn't good to have just Student He Bufeng come as the exchange student, so he sent Student Tang Jingze together with him..."</p>

    <p>There was dead silence in Grade One, Class Three... because based on Teacher Pan's words, this guy was a freebie!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..." What damn freebie!</p>

    <p>"Student Tang Jingze's grades are excellent. If there is anything any of you don't understand, you can ask him to teach you." Teacher Pan cleared her throat and pondered over what she was going to say next, a slight flush on her face. "Furthermore, Student He Bufeng's family operates a men's hospital, and he's brought a gift for the exchange at our Number 60 High School... for the next six months, all Number 60 High School male students can enjoy fifty percent off on circumcision services at the hospital when they present their student IDs."</p>

    <p>"What about the girls?" Lin Xiaoyu raised her hand and asked.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan: "Hair removal."</p>

    <p>Everyone in Grade One, Class Three: "..." I don't want this gift!</p>
