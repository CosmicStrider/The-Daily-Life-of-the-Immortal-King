  <h1>Chapter 1076 Flame of the Universe</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The moment the forest of crispy noodle snacks appeared, Er Ha realized that the situation was gradually spinning out of control... Although the forest had been produced by the heart demon, everything about it was truly a little too real. Even from far away, Er Ha could smell the pepper scent of crispy noodle snacks which wafted out from the forest.</p>

    <p>It knew its Little Master Ling too well - how could he possibly resist such temptation?!</p>

    <p>"No! I have to do something!" Seeing Wang Ling gradually turn absent-minded, Er Ha grabbed Wang Ling's pants leg between its teeth to drag him back. However, Wang Ling was outrageously strong, and Er Ha found itself unable to stop him at all. Despite its death grip on Wang Ling's pants legs, it was dragged over the ground, its head creating a deep furrow in the earth...</p>

    <p>No, it needed reinforcements!</p>

    <p>Er Ha grit its teeth and took out the immortal seal! This was from Immortal Zhenyuan, and could be used to summon him whenever necessary. In this situation, the fastest way Er Ha could think of to get help was to summon Immortal Zhenyuan.</p>

    <p>To prevent the girl from doing anything unusual, Xiao Yin was protecting them outside, and thus couldn't enter the world.</p>

    <p>"Law of nature! Seal complete!" Er Ha shouted inwardly.</p>

    <p>With the injection of spirit energy, Zhenyuan's immortal seal instantly burst with powerful spirit power. Power gathered in the sky before a figure finally took shape. Immortal Zhenyuan was the same as ever with his red hair. Red flames of spirit light curled around his body as he descended from the sky.</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan cultivated the Upright Yang Element Technique, which was a divine-level fire technique that had the miraculous effect of driving off demons and ghosts. When he appeared, the initially gloomy heart demon world seemed a little more colorful.</p>

    <p>"Senior Dog!" Zhenyuan came over to greet Er Ha. He was still working on restoring Drought Star, and all this time had been anticipating Senior Dog summoning him to do odd jobs for it! He never thought that after so long, Senior Dog would finally remember him!</p>

    <p>This sort of excitement was like a popular uploader, who hadn't been online for a while, remembering his password for the video website...</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan looked around excitedly and was stunned.</p>

    <p>Heart demon world...</p>

    <p>Although he didn't know about the Shadow Palace, he could instantly sense that this world had been created by a heart demon!</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan was no stranger to heart demons. Back then, he had sundered his heart demon from his body before it overwhelmed him, and it became "Wind Spirit." Ultimately, he destroyed Wind Spirit with his own hands. Zhenyuan still vividly remembered the melancholy of that act to this day.</p>

    <p>It was already scary enough dealing with a heart demon.</p>

    <p>How much worse would it be to deal with a world that had been constructed by a heart demon?</p>

    <p>"Come." Er Ha didn't say anything unnecessary as it promptly called Zhenyuan over to hold back Wang Ling. It already felt like it couldn't hold on, but thinking of its identity as "Senior Dog" in front of Zhenyuan, it automatically switched to a commanding tone.</p>

    <p>Er Ha had covertly drawn on Wang Ling's power last time to help Zhenyuan destroy Wind Spirit. Zhenyuan had treated it as a senior since then, and even revered it as a divine dog for a while.</p>

    <p>"Okay, Senior Dog, there's no need for you to handle this small thing! Just leave it to me!" The next moment, Zhenyuan took action right away. Since he had faith that this "Senior Dog" would support him from behind, he wasn't apprehensive at all in his movements.</p>

    <p>"Heaven Sun Lock!" He made a hand seal at the speed of light, his long fingers moving unceasingly like a fire lotus blossoming. In a split second, several golden disks appeared in the sky, and blazing golden chains of fire shot out to firmly grasp Wang Ling's ankles.</p>

    <p>This Heaven Sun Lock which Immortal Zhenyuan took pride in was one of the magic treasures he had created. It could suppress powerful spirit beasts, demon beasts, and even vicious behemoths! This was the confidence of a man who was devoted to creating magic treasures!</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling held Zhenyuan in very high regard when it came to the creation of magic treasures. After all, this was the man who created the Gate Between Worlds... If it wasn't for the Gate Between Worlds, Er Ha wouldn't have met Wang Ling, and it might not be where it was now if it hadn't met Wang Ling. It had already been stuck at a bottleneck as a demon king, and if things had continued in that vein, the Tuntian Ha clan might have been sooner or later swallowed up by the other demon clans.</p>

    <p>It could be said that the Gate Between Worlds had changed the outcomes of many things...</p>

    <p>Er Ha thus also had a lot of confidence in the Heaven Sun Lock which Zhenyuan created. Even if the magic treasure couldn't stop its Little Master Ling, it should at least buy them some time, right? Its little master's strength was still sealed away; in theory, it should be possible to forcibly restrain Wang Ling in his constrained state.</p>

    <p>But reality was far more challenging than Er Ha imagined.</p>

    <p>The chains had only just fastened themselves around Wang Ling's ankles, when a flash of protective gold light actually smashed them into powder!</p>

    <p>"My Heaven Sun Lock..."</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan was extremely heartbroken.</p>

    <p>This Heaven Sun Lock was his proud masterpiece which he had only been able to accomplish after roaming the universe for a long time looking for the materials needed!</p>

    <p>But it had actually been smashed to smithereens by this youngster's protective golden light alone?</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan was somewhat surprised.</p>

    <p>It seemed that Senior Dog had found him a really amazing opponent this time!</p>

    <p>Perhaps this was Senior Dog's test for him?</p>

    <p>He had to put on a good show!</p>

    <p>The youngster's odd behavior as he uncontrollably walked toward the forest of crispy noodle snacks was a typical sign of a heart demon corrosion! Perhaps he had been tainted by the inner demon of this world?</p>

    <p>A lot of complicated possibilities flashed through Zhenyuan's mind.</p>

    <p>Looking at Wang Ling's young face, he couldn't help sighing. When all was said and done, this was still a youngster who had yet to spread his wings, and who was completely unable to withstand the pressure of such an environment!</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan smiled a little sympathetically.</p>

    <p>Now that he knew that the youngster had lost control of his own body because of the heart demon, what Zhenyuan needed to do next was very easy.</p>

    <p>Thinking this, Zhenyuan unhurriedly took out a second magic treasure.</p>

    <p>Er Ha noticed that it was actually a lighter.</p>

    <p>"Senior Dog, this is the Flame of the Universe that I gathered when I was wandering around space... the holy power it contains has the effect of purifying a heart demon!"</p>

    <p>"Why a lighter?"</p>

    <p>"This is the legendary nuclear lighter. I also have a matching nuclear flashlight here!"</p>

    <p>"...Does it work?" Er Ha was doubtful.</p>

    <p>This heart demon was created by Shadow Dao - even the Great Purification Spell was useless.</p>

    <p>But this was Er Ha's first time seeing the Flame of the Universe.</p>

    <p>It was a rainbow-colored flame which had been refined in the core of every large star that existed in the deepest parts of the universe.</p>

    <p>Now that things had come to this point, Er Ha had no other choice but to let Zhenyuan give it a try.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, Senior Dog, the Flame of the Universe will automatically purify the heart demon!"</p>

    <p><em>Pa!</em></p>

    <p>Zhenyuan aimed the nuclear lighter at Wang Ling and flicked it.</p>

    <p>The Flame of the Universe had its own spiritual intelligence. It sprang out of the lighter and lunged confidently at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But even before the flame was halfway to Wang Ling, something happened which left Zhenyuan astonished.</p>

    <p>This small seven-colored flame actually pulled back shivering into the lighter...</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan: "???"</p>

    <p>The Flame of the Universe was actually so scared?</p>

    <p>Who on earth did Senior Dog want him to deal with?</p>
