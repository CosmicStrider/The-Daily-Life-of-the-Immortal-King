  <h1>Chapter 437 Cheat Diviner Reed's Divination Skill </h1>

  <div>

    <p>After leaving the institute, Lord Diulei tossed out the spirit sword that was on his back as he planned to fly home on it.</p>

    <p>This sword which Lord Diulei carried on his back was known as Brilliant Victory, which meant "ever-victorious and brilliant."</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang hadn't made this sword; instead, it was a sword that was handed down from Lord Diulei's forefathers. Usually it was in a secured state, wrapped in layers of seals like a dumpling. But this didn't impact on its ordinary use - at the most, it just looked a little unsightly.</p>

    <p>A bigger pain in the ass was that the spirit sword had been forged by a weaponsmith elsewhere, so when Lord Diulei had gotten it... its sword plate number wasn't a local one! Thus, there were flight restrictions on it during morning and evening peak hours everyday!</p>

    <p>But the time now was just right; if he took the spirit bus home, it would waste a lot of time.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei jumped onto his spirit sword and was just about to leave when he got a phone call.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei looked at the caller ID: Cheat Diviner Reed... (he had read that correctly)</p>

    <p>Huh? A call from Cheat Diviner?</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei stared a little blankly at the screen. After his visit to Immortal Toya's Chrysanthemum Island, he had secretly found this diviner friend of his, Daoist Reed, who was nicknamed Cheat Diviner Reed because his divinations were so accurate it was as if he used cheats!</p>

    <p>Like Luo Chuang, he wasn't part of the chat group, but was one of Lord Diulei's very good friends.</p>

    <p>There would always be mavericks in any era, and there were countless weirdos in the cultivation circle. Some of them didn't take part in chat groups, and forcing them to join didn't make sense.</p>

    <p>In the end, it was up to each person. Perhaps one day they would start to feel lonely, and want to join a group to chat every day, like Daoist Guang.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei pressed the answer button.</p>

    <p>Cheat Diviner Reed's voice, which had a slight regional accent, sounded from the other end of the line. "Hello? Senior Immortal? Is that you?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Yes, Brother Reed, it's me..." As soon as he spoke, the young man in white couldn't help stamping his feet. Every time he talked to Cheat Diviner Reed, his own accent would also come out!</p>

    <p>After composing himself, Lord Diulei asked, "Brother Reed, is there any news with the divination I asked you to perform?"</p>

    <p>After leaving Chrysanthemum Island, he had asked Cheat Diviner Reed to do a reading on Immortal Toya's marriage prospects.</p>

    <p>However, Daoist Reed hated marriage divination the most; it wasn't just time-consuming, but every person who had wanted a marriage divination done would develop a mysterious confidence once they knew what their path to marriage was like.</p>

    <p>Why were there so many douchebags, guys and girls alike, nowadays?</p>

    <p>Daoist Reed thought that half of it might be his fault.</p>

    <p>Hence, he wouldn't do this type of divination at all, no matter how much more he was paid, unless you were one of his especially good friends.</p>

    <p>Daoist Reed said, "The marriage divination... you still have to wait a bit; it's not easy to calculate, but once it's done it'll definitely be very accurate."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Then why did Brother Reed call me today?"</p>

    <p>Daoist Reed: "Senior Immortal, do you remember how you gave me your birth data when you came to me for fortune-telling before?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei nodded. "Mm... it seems that was the case..."</p>

    <p>Having said that, that had been at least several hundred years ago!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei remembered that back then he had wanted to know what his fortune was like, so he had left his birth data with Daoist Reed.</p>

    <p>And Daoist Reed had a habit of keeping the information of regular customers for later use.</p>

    <p>Daoist Reed: "This time before I helped perform a divination for your friend, I used the wrong data, and accidentally used yours. I didn't realize it until I had finished the divination..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei frowned slightly. "Wrong?"</p>

    <p>This was quite a low-level mistake, and it was basically impossible for a veteran diviner like Daoist Reed to make such a mistake. Generally, accidentally using the wrong data for fortune-telling was the type of situation that foreboded something.</p>

    <p>Daoist Reed had pretty much the same thought as Lord Diulei. "I thought that this mistake might be some kind of omen, so I helped you divine your luck."</p>

    <p>"What was the result?"</p>

    <p>"It shows that a bloody disaster is going to befall you."</p>

    <p>"Very inauspicious?"</p>

    <p>"Wrong! <em>Extremely </em>inauspicious!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"It looks like it's about life and death!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei broke into a sweat. "Did you divine wrong?"</p>

    <p>On the other end of the phone, Daoist Reed shook his head. "Impossible, I did it three times! I was also doubtful at first and wondered if there was something wrong with that round since I had helped you divine your fortune once before that, and it showed that you would be blessed in spirit and body for the next one thousand years. Thus, logically speaking, it's indeed very unlikely for an inauspicious divination to appear now. Moreover, when I did the second and third divinations, I even used my imperial divination magic device."</p>

    <p>Daoist Reed was very confident in the accuracy of his divination. "This divination device is outstanding, and I've never made a mistake when I use it."</p>

    <p>"What kind of magic device is this?"</p>

    <p>"It's a magic sword called Fortune-Evading Sword <sup>1</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is a homophone of the name of the Chinese TV presenter Bi Fujian ..)</dfn>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"This sword foretells bad, not good luck. If it's a smooth and auspicious divination, the sword won't move at all... but the bleaker the divination, the more the sword trembles! When I tested it out for you today, this sword was like a vibrator on the highest setting!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Then Brother Reed, do you have any way to dispel it?"</p>

    <p>Daoist Reed sighed and looked a little troubled. "If it's very inauspicious, I still have ways... but this is extremely inauspicious... Senior Immortal, brother, I have something I don't know whether to say or not..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Brother Reed, feel free to say it."</p>

    <p>Daoist Reed: "Please pay me for the divination right now! Then just wait to pass away in peace. I'm afraid that if I wait any longer, I won't get it..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>After hanging up the phone, Lord Diulei gazed at the screen as he fell into deep thought for a long time.</p>

    <p>To be honest, it wasn't like he didn't understand the implications of an extremely inauspicious divination; this was a divination of imminent death and was the kind of divination that wasn't any different to a hospital's notice of terminally ill patients.</p>

    <p>But no matter how Lord Diulei thought about it, he couldn't understand why he was suddenly in danger of an imminent death.</p>

    <p>This wasn't good...</p>

    <p>If this was the case, he couldn't go home now! An extremely inauspicious divination came true within twenty-four hours of the prediction! Furthermore, the bad luck would bring disaster to everything around him... If he went home now, even Xiao Yin might suffer!</p>

    <p>What should he do?</p>

    <p>Go look for Brother Ling?</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was about to make a phone call when, with a whooshing sound, sword qi unexpectedly attacked him from afar at that moment!</p>

    <p>This sword qi acted as a warning. It was extremely fast and brushed past Lord Diulei's ear, taking off a few strands of his black hair.</p>

    <p>Who was it?!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei looked in the direction that the sword qi had come from.</p>

    <p>In the moonlight, he saw a very evil-looking young man, standing high above on a street light, who was staring at him with a gloomy face.</p>

    <p>The young man gave a sneer and said calmly, "I, am Evil Sword God..."</p>

    <p>"Sword God..."</p>

    <p>"God..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Psycho..."</p>
