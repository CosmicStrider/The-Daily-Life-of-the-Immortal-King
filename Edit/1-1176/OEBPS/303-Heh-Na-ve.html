  <h1>Chapter 303 Heh, Naïve...</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Fifteen minutes ago...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling and his group rushed to Linglang Pavilion, they discovered that Fang Xing wasn't there, and had disappeared with the Taoist in red.</p>

    <p>"It's an intrinsic spirit field!" After perceiving their surroundings, the silver unicorn instantly came to a conclusion. "The intrinsic spirit field has a special magnetic field that can only be perceived by people who also have intrinsic spirit fields, so I'm sure of it."</p>

    <p>After Immortal Toya's generous medical treatment and coupled with the silver unicorn's strong recovery ability, it had been able to move again after just a short while. The slit-eyed girl whom it was carrying on its back was still unconscious.</p>

    <p>"So, we weren't mistaken when that Taoist in red blew off the palace roof just now?" asked Dharmaraja.</p>

    <p>Before they had arrived, they had already sensed from afar on the flat top of Yuntai Pavilion the aura of a battle. It was Lord Diulei who had first noticed in the distance a Taoist in red blowing apart the roof of the palace.</p>

    <p>The discomfited look on the Taoist's face at that time had just been like the online kaomoji: (╯‵□′)╯(┻━┻</p>

    <p>"That person is Master of Immortal Mansion, Cheng Yu." The silver unicorn narrowed its eyes. "However, I never expected that this person would also have an intrinsic spirit field."</p>

    <p>When it said this, the silver unicorn was struck with melancholy. It took a very long time for a cultivator to build up a source of spirit energy in order to create an intrinsic spirit field. Without this, everything was just hot air. The silver unicorn had cultivated for a very long time in order to be able to create an intrinsic spirit field! But now, even Itinerant Immortals could open an intrinsic spirit field, as if they were opening a market — this was really unscientific!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>A group of people sat on the ground inside Linglang Pavilion. The palace roof which the Taoist in red had destroyed earlier was visibly restoring itself with the nomological power of regeneration.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sat crossed-legged on the ground and opened his Heavenly Eye.</p>

    <p>Activating the Heavenly Eye at maximum power, he stared at the sky, and finally, a scene of the intrinsic spirit field was projected into the air.</p>

    <p>When it saw this, the silver unicorn's hair all stood on end; how come it hadn't known that the Heavenly Eye could actually be used to look inside an intrinsic spirit field?</p>

    <p>Seeing the silver unicorn's pale and stunned expression, Lord Diulei couldn't help laughing. "Brother Ling's Heavenly Eye is very special, and can pierce through nothingness, or what we often call the essence of things. It's a little complicated trying to explain it. You know the radio, right?"</p>

    <p>The silver unicorn: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Brother Ling's Heavenly Eye is like a radio, it can pick up frequency modulations."</p>

    <p>To one side, Immortal Toya promptly agreed. "Actually, this is a normal operation for Senior Ling. Just sit down, it's nothing particularly surprising."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Only its idol image as a holy beast prevented the silver unicorn from cursing out loud.</p>

    <p>It now wondered heavily whether it had been completely living inside a dog's stomach for the past eight thousand years! That was just like its master, so formidable!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Everyone watched what was happening inside the intrinsic spirit field as the Taoist in red and a girl engaged in fierce battle.</p>

    <p>The scene shocked everyone present. The jaws of Dharmaraja, Luo Chuang and the rest dropped open. They saw that even Ling Zhenren's stiff poker face had turned considering.</p>

    <p>"Is this... is this Brother Fang Xing? How did he suddenly become a cute little sister?"</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja sucked in a sharp breath... it turned out that this was the most powerful cross-dressing big shot!</p>

    <p>From the scene projected by the Heavenly Eye in that moment, the maiden Fang Xing had combined the powers of two supreme spells and was locked in a fight against hundreds of spirit swords, and even had the upper hand.</p>

    <p>This scene stunned everyone, since it was also the first time they had seen Fang Xing like this.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei furrowed his brow. "I never knew Brother Fang Xing had this other side to him. But how on earth did this happen?" His feelings were in a bit of a turmoil — how could a brother whom he had known for years suddenly become a younger sister... It was a hit not just to the eyes, but also to his heart.</p>

    <p>"That indeed is Brother Fang Xing."</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren had seen a lot and knew much. "This is probably Immortal She Pi's specialty from back then, the White Night Spell, enhanced by Immortal Zhenyuan's specialty, Immortal Mode. The combination of these two supreme spells has a devastating effect."</p>

    <p>Staring at the scene, the silver unicorn couldn't help trembling; it finally knew why the three Immortal Mansion key female elders had perished in an instant. Boosted by two supreme magic spells, this tough girl had already broken through to True Immortal level, and even ten Itinerant Immortals together wouldn't be her match.</p>

    <p>The silver unicorn could also feel the power of an intrinsic spirit field coming from this girl; clearly, she was someone who could call forth the field. It was likely that she had killed those three elders with it, and had been drawn into a fight with the Master of Immortal Mansion during the field's cooling-off period.</p>

    <p>Most of the people here could guess what had happened without the silver unicorn needing to offer its speculation.</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren sighed as she gazed at this scene. "Senior Immortal said before that Brother Fang Xing had been adopted as a child, so I've been trying to figure out his origins. It's now clear that he isn't so simple — he is Immortal She Pi's child from back then, and from the looks of it, he inherited some of Immortal She Pi's core strength."</p>

    <p>Everyone was dumbfounded at this conjecture.</p>

    <p>"If that's the case, then everything makes sense."</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren sighed deeply when she said this; she knew a lot about what had happened back then. "A lot of media at the time had reported that Immortal She Pi had been led astray by someone. Looking at it now, it seems that this person was the Master of Immortal Mansion."</p>

    <p>In the end, this was about Fang Xing's longstanding grudge against the Master of Immortal Mansion.</p>

    <p>And this time, Fang Xing had taken the opportunity to get even with him.</p>

    <p>At that moment, the silver unicorn who had been silent all this time suddenly cried out in surprise. Seeing the Master of Immortal Mansion produce his Heavenly Materials sword, its pupils abruptly shrank. "I've seen this sword before; the master spent a hundred years creating this spirit sword, and it's very bizarre! Your friend is in danger!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised his eyes as he looked at the scene in front of him and gazed composedly at Fang Xing in a feminine form.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling wasn't a person of that generation back then, so anything he knew in relation to Immortal She Pi's various sins was the little that he had heard in Lao Gudong's history classes. Actually, he wasn't qualified at all to make any judgements.</p>

    <p>He neither liked Fang Xing nor hated him.</p>

    <p>As for how they were stuck with each other, Wang Ling thought it must have been doomed fate when he had killed the Tuntian Ha back then...</p>

    <p>Hence, he let out a heavy sigh in his heart as looked at this scene.</p>

    <p>This doomed fate would be slowly addressed in the future.</p>

    <p>But no matter what happened then, Fang Xing now was still his brother!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, do you have a solution? Brother Fang Xing can't hold on much longer!" Lord Diulei shouted worriedly.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Fang Xing was gradually turning back into a young man after finally letting go of both his spells.</p>

    <p>The silver unicorn knitted its eyebrows. "To save him, we have to break the intrinsic spirit field! But that's too hard!"</p>

    <p>"Not at all!" Luo Chuang said excitedly. "Lord Jingke can definitely do it! This is Ling Zhenren's spirit sword, after all!"</p>

    <p>"Master's spirit sword?" The silver unicorn was startled.</p>

    <p>"It's that peach wood spirit sword which the Master of Immortal Mansion seized the other day," explained Luo Chuang.</p>

    <p>The silver unicorn was enlightened. "But I remember that the master already put layer on layer of seals on it."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, the corner of Wang Ling's mouth couldn't help twitching.</p>

    <p>The Master of Immortal Mansion wanted to lock Jingke up with those trash seals?</p>

    <p>Heh... too naïve!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>With just a snap of Wang Ling's fingers, a space channel instantly opened up in the intrinsic spirit field, and that familiar brown spirit poured forth out of the darkness...</p>
