  <h1>Chapter 662 Long Johns</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Texting for help was the only thing Zhuo Yi could think of at that moment.</p>

    <p>Since the other side was bent on their vendetta and tailing them, this proved that these people weren't weak. There was never any room for discussion with this type of utterly ruthless people.</p>

    <p>The truth was that since assuming the position of Director of the General Administration of 100 Schools, Zhuo Yi had always been on guard against something like this. General Yi and Secretary Dakang had looked for him previously and wanted to dispatch experts as bodyguards to protect him, but Zhuo Yi had tactfully declined. These experts would be chess pieces of the higher-ups who might investigate him; if they found his shifu Wang Ling, everything would be over.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi knew his shifu was a person who liked to stay low-key, so he had declined expert protection from the start. General Yi and Secretary Dakang had initially been strongly against his decision. In the end, Zhuo Yi had no choice but to look for help from Wang Ling. And what could Wang Ling do? Naturally, he looked for Father Wang... In the end, Father Wang just sent a message, and instantly there was no longer any sound from the higher-ups.</p>

    <p>As for his own safety, Zhuo Yi actually felt that there was absolutely nothing to be worried about... Because in this type of situation, he could send out messages for help!</p>

    <p>In fact, he already had several messages like this stored inside his phone.</p>

    <p>He even took into account the possibility that the pursuers might carry a signal blocker on them to block calls for help. Zhuo Yi had even prepared a small signal transmitter; this was a separate base station which he had set up at the staff apartment and which could be remotely controlled by the signal transmitter to send a distress signal.</p>

    <p>But since he could send the text as usual now, there was actually no need to use this back-up.</p>

    <p>The driver stopped the car in an empty place: it was a desolate, suburban park which had yet to be developed.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi and Zhong Lang had barely gotten out of the car when they felt dense killing intent coming from the van...</p>

    <p>Sure enough, the people inside didn't have friendly intentions!</p>

    <p>The door of the van opened and a gloomy-looking cultivator emerged in front of Zhuo Yi and Zhong Lang. The cultivator was dressed differently from a regular cultivator, and looked a bit like the inhabitants of Sun Island.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi deduced that this was a cultivator who had probably come back after learning ninjutsu on Sun Island. It was the trend now to train in both ninjutsu and cultivation techniques, and there were more and more ninjutsu techniques that had switched to spirit energy as the foundation for their use.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi didn't think it was strange at all that there were cultivators in the Demon Hunters Association who trained in two fields since the General Administration already had a lot of evidence on the Demon Hunters Association colluding with foreign dark forces.</p>

    <p>They had been tracking down the rest of the Demon Hunters Association's executive management previously. Looking now at this man who had appeared in front of them, Zhuo Yi instantly understood: a considerable number of the senior members of the Demon Hunters Association had probably been sent abroad to study, hence why there had never been any information on them at home.</p>

    <p>And it was this group of senior members that was the true core of the entire Demon Hunters Association.</p>

    <p>As for the executive management in Huaxiu, including Elder Zuo Wu, President Bai might have never used them as the real backbone of power from the very beginning.</p>

    <p>"Finally ready to come out..."</p>

    <p>The gloomy young man stared at them. "I am here on orders from Elder Ji Xing of the Demon Hunters Association: please come with us."</p>

    <p>"You studied abroad, right? It can't be just you from the Demon Hunters Association; did that Elder Ji Xing also return from studying abroad?" Zhuo Yi asked.</p>

    <p>"Small talk? There's no harm in telling you; in any case, the both of you will be dead men by tomorrow."</p>

    <p>The gloomy young man smiled. "This time, Elder Ji Xing called for us to gather here from abroad. Today was supposed to be the day you die, but because of a slight problem in the organization, our official operation will be carried out tomorrow."</p>

    <p>Official operation?</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi frowned.</p>

    <p>From the young man's tone, the other side didn't intend to kill him yet; they wanted to catch him first before killing him tomorrow. Coupled with the frenetic movements of foreign dark forces in the last few years, Zhuo Yi felt like he had some idea of what the other side's objective was - it was very likely that this Demon Hunters Association wanted to seize him and Zhong Lang first and then find a suitable place tomorrow for a public execution.</p>

    <p>As for the location, Zhuo Yi also had his own conjecture.</p>

    <p>It would either be the General Administration of 100 Schools or Number 60 High School...</p>

    <p>Truly a terrible bunch of ruffians!</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi's heart was a little uneasy. This was just a Demon Hunters Association, a small organization under the foreign dark power Night Chief, yet it actually possessed so much strength and so many expert fighters trained in dual arts. Given this was the case, how terrifying was the genuine Night Chief?</p>

    <p>This gloomy young man alone who stood in front of them already surpassed the Soul Formation stage, and Zhuo Yi felt far more pressure than when he was in front of Lord Diulei! Roughly five Lord Diuleis?</p>

    <p>Even as Zhuo Yi thought this, the one thing he could be sure was that this man's cultivation had yet to reach Itinerant Immortal level.</p>

    <p>Cheng Yu, the Master of Immortal Mansion, was at the peak late Itinerant Immortal level, which was also known as Half-Step True Immortal level. Compared with the Master of Immortal Mansion, this young man's strength fell far short. Moreover, the Master of Immortal Mansion also had an intrinsic spirit field, which could boost his combat strength to a level comparable with a True Immortal.</p>

    <p>"What is Director Zhuo thinking about? How to handle your remains tomorrow?" This soldier with dual training from the Demon Hunters Association didn't make a move, and just bantered like this from beginning to end.</p>

    <p>When all was said and done, Zhuo Yi and Zhong Lang were only at the Golden Core stage, and this Demon Hunters Association soldier thought nothing of their strength at all.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi gazed at the young man and gave him a kind warning. "If you leave now, you might still live... if you try to leave later, you really won't be able to."</p>

    <p>The Demon Hunters Association soldier: "???"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Given your weak chicken strength, even if I arrest you and put you in Songhai First Prison, there's no way you'll be locked up in the special cell with the bigwigs. You're just not good enough."</p>

    <p>The gloomy Demon Hunters Association soldier looked at Zhuo Yi coldly and grit his teeth. "You want to die?"</p>

    <p>He released his aura all at once along with his ire, and it was almost like an invisible roar.</p>

    <p>Tremendous spiritual pressure crashed down, and both Zhuo Yi and Zhong Lang felt their bodies sink until half their legs were already stuck in the ground.</p>

    <p>"So nervous..." Zhong Lang frowned. "Brother Zhuo, are these long johns really useful? Why do I feel that the pressure from the other side is so heavy? It's like I can't breathe!"</p>

    <p>"It's not that bad."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi raised an eyebrow and reached out to grip Zhong Lang's collar for a look.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "You're wearing it inside out..."</p>

    <p>Zhong Lang: "..."</p>
