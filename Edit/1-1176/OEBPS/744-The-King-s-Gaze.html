  <h1>Chapter 744 The King's Gaze</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Since this Sea And Sky Array had been instantly activated, it was almost impossible to put the brake on it halfway through its operation, and given the current situation, there were only two options.</p>

    <p>The first was to track down the core pattern and destroy its foundation, making the main array unstable and causing it to collapse. As long as the cell summoning array was active in the fake remains, the summoned cells would continue to be transported over in an unending stream. But the Sea And Sky Array was too big, and its patterns were so incredibly complicated that it was almost impossible to find the core pattern in a short period of time.</p>

    <p>The second solution was to think of a way to move the array to another location before destroying it with a large-scale spell. This method currently looked like the most feasible one, but it would cause severe damage to the real remains.</p>

    <p>At the fake remains, Lord Anxiang, who had summoned the cells with the Cells At Work Spell, glanced at the dozen or so Night Chief members next to him whose bodies had completely withered.</p>

    <p>In order to save their lives earlier, Lord Anxiang had come up with this countermeasure of summoning cells, but it caused immense damage to the body beyond just shortening the lifespan.</p>

    <p>So when he had said earlier that the spell would shorten their lifespans, that had just been on the surface.</p>

    <p>Under normal conditions, summoning one or two cells for battle did indeed consume some vitality, which was harmless.</p>

    <p>But to produce such a huge army of white blood cells and red blood cells, the problem wasn't as simple as just burning up life. In a summons this powerful, the entire body cell system was ultimately sacrificed as all the organs inside the body were used up - every single drop of energy would be completely burned up.</p>

    <p>As the array caster, Dark Fragrance could naturally control the array to protect himself and ensure his own safety.</p>

    <p>He and Ghost Head Blade had received Night Ghost Spirit Emperor's secret instruction earlier on to use particular means in particular situations.</p>

    <p>This move was like smashing a pot that was already cracked, which would create a knotty problem for Huaxiu Alliance.</p>

    <p>This was because destroying the Sea And Sky Array would unavoidably damage the real remains.</p>

    <p>All these years, Huaxiu nation had relied on the excuse of protecting Beast King's Remains to take firm control of the entrance to the secret land, Devil Valley. If they didn't handle this Sea And Sky Array properly now, it would stir up international public opinion and other nations would undoubtedly take advantage of this to apply to the International United Cultivators Association for joint management of Devil Valley.</p>

    <p>That would truly be the point of no return.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At that moment, thick fog rolled through the part of the forest that was within the Sea And Sky Array's range.</p>

    <p>This was a sign that the array had already been activated, and many of the lead teachers started to arrange for their students to return to the "Rainbow Glass Box." The biggest priority right now was to evacuate the students, after which the teachers could fight without any worries.</p>

    <p>The summoned cells were enormous, and every single one of them was extremely formidable. Even the weakest one was at the Golden Core stage. Even if the Foundation Establishment students worked together, they would just be walking to their deaths.</p>

    <p>Hovering in the air, the head of state looked down at the massive Sea And Sky Array, which directly covered one seventh of this eastern forest.</p>

    <p>While one seventh didn't sound very large, this stretch of forest contained many extinct resources. The section which had been opened to the students today was just the tip of the iceberg, and was not even a seventh of a seventh of the forest.</p>

    <p>Destroying the core array pattern was the best way of preserving the remains as much as possible.</p>

    <p>But this Sea And Sky Array had obviously been specially modified. An array expert could fiddle around with the array pattern structure and set up many fake patterns to conceal the real one. Furthermore, these fake patterns were no less complex than the real one, and like fake wires on a bomb, the slightest misstep would cause a chain reaction.</p>

    <p>Unless the array could be destroyed in one go, even the head of state didn't dare act casually. He could see how tricky the fake array patterns were; if he destroyed the wrong one, the fake patterns might rapidly increase and spread out.</p>

    <p>Seeing that the students in the forest had been safely evacuated to the Rainbow Glass Box, the head of state breathed a sigh of relief. Unfortunately, the military tents below would all go to waste this time.</p>

    <p>The kids had evacuated so quickly that they hadn't had time to take the tents down.</p>

    <p>"Is there a way to lock onto the core?"</p>

    <p>The Huaxiu Alliance command center received his question.</p>

    <p>President Qi heaved a sigh. There wasn't a way for the time being. If he was on the scene, he might have been able to use the Brain Deduction Technique to look for the real core array pattern. Since the calculations were all run in the brain, there wouldn't be the least bit impact even if the wrong array pattern was destroyed.</p>

    <p>But if they wanted to find the correct array pattern, apart from discerning it correctly with the Heavenly Eye, Wang Ming was now their only hope.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was President Qi's disciple, and was naturally aware of the pros and cons of the situation: they had to find the core array pattern in order to preserve the remains to the fullest extent.</p>

    <p>Inside the military tent, Zhai Yin, who had activated Vanguard Blade, was fighting toe to toe with Ghost Head Blade, who was a very tough opponent. Although it had been less than a year since Wang Ming and Zhai Yin started living together, their coordination had unwittingly moved up a level after being around each other day and night.</p>

    <p>If it wasn't for the fact that Wang Ming was trapped in the military tent, he would be able to cover all of the Sea And Sky Array with his Brain Deduction Technique.</p>

    <p>Aware of the meaningful look in Wang Ming's eyes, Zhai Yin changed her attack pattern and deliberately revealed an opening.</p>

    <p>Burning with his killing intent, Ghost Head Blade went all out to kill Zhai Yin first.</p>

    <p>In the next moment, his pitch-black dagger body smashed through the layers of the barrier which he had set up himself, instantly creating a gap.</p>

    <p>Building on this momentum, Zhai Yin cracked the barrier open!</p>

    <p>"We did it!"</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin whooped.</p>

    <p>She stayed by Wang Ming's side and continued to protect him.</p>

    <p>Almost the instant the barrier broke, Wang Ming was already sitting cross-legged as he exerted the full power of the Brain Deduction Technique and summoned the Heavenly Materials sword as he tried to lock onto the specific location of the core array pattern.</p>

    <p>It was also at that moment that the army of white blood cells and red blood cells were transported over from the fake remains as they started to come out of the ground like mushrooms after the rain.</p>

    <p>This was inevitably a massive hindrance in Wang Ming's search for the core array pattern.</p>

    <p>"There's so many of them..."</p>

    <p>Many of the teachers who had stayed behind cried out in surprise. Now that they no longer had to worry about the students, they followed Wu Zhenjun's command to stay behind and protect Wang Ming - as soon as Wang Ming found the core array pattern, they would gather all their firepower to destroy it in one go.</p>

    <p>But the sheer size of this army of white blood cells, red blood cells, and even macrophages, made one feel like they were standing in an ocean of people - this was truly a massive amount of summoned cells!</p>

    <p>There were more than ten thousand of them...</p>

    <p>While most of the cells didn't have high realms, they would be very troublesome to deal with given how massive their numbers were.</p>

    <p>That Lord Anxiang had also already been transferred over from the fake remains through the Sea And Sky Array, and he met up with Ghost Head Blade.</p>

    <p>"Brother Dark Fragrance is truly amazing." Looking at the vast army, Ghost Head Blade praised him from the bottom of his heart.</p>

    <p>"It's just a petty thing," Dark Fragrance replied.</p>

    <p>The two of them stood watching at a distance.</p>

    <p>They didn't notice a clone of Wang Ling standing not far from them, who was gazing at this cell army with dead fish eyes.</p>

    <p>The teachers were all discussing telepathically how they were going to split up to confront the enemy.</p>

    <p>The next moment, something happened which no one could have imagined.</p>

    <p>The cells that had just come out of the ground actually went back down...</p>

    <p>They had petrified looks in their eyes, like they were feeling threatened.</p>
