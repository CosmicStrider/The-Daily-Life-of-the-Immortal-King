  <h1>Chapter 328 Er Ha's Boring Dog Life </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Although it was just a simple clash of auras, it was already obvious to Killer Taoist that Taoist Taotie's cultivation was far more advanced than before, even several times over. Just now, Taoist Taotie had held back some of his strength; if he hadn't, both Killer Taoist and Bandit Evil would have been finished here.</p>

    <p>Then, the questions now were:</p>

    <p>One, who on earth was Black Gauze?</p>

    <p>Second, what was Gorgeous Itinerant's great weapon?</p>

    <p>Killer Taoist and Bandit Evil were puzzled by these two things.</p>

    <p>"The only thing that I'm sure of is that this Black Gauze definitely wasn't in the murder industry... back then, after shifu and Senior Taoist Taotie parted ways and withdrew from the assassination circle one after another, I obtained a registry of names. From the moment that the international ranking list of killers was set up, the record clearly shows that there has never been anyone named Black Gauze."</p>

    <p>Killer Taoist took a deep breath. "As for that supreme weapon which Taoist Taotie said shifu hid away... we've followed him for so long, have we ever heard him mention it?"</p>

    <p>Bandit Evil shook his head. "No... But isn't shifu's great weapon his collection of chalks?"</p>

    <p>Killer Taoist: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was an unusually idle Saturday.</p>

    <p>After spending the morning in the chat group and browsing online posts discussing the Shuigou Sect incident, Wang Ling only felt that his eyes were a little tired. These two days had almost entirely revolved around the Shuigou Sect incident, and even the furor around Immortal Mansion had been pushed aside.</p>

    <p>Now that Wang Ling thought about it carefully, he suddenly felt that the Master of Immortal Mansion was also unfortunate. He had built such a large dark force and had collected spirit swords from all over the world. His ultimate ambition had been to create a supreme spirit sword of his own, but before the sword was even half done, Immortal Mansion had collapsed... it wouldn't have been so bad if things had stopped there, since at the very least, Immortal Mansion had already been recognized in and outside the country as the largest dark force in Huaxiu's history.</p>

    <p>However, this largest dark force had only grabbed the headlines for a few days before it had been replaced by Shuigou Sect which had come out of nowhere... this was a bigger tragedy for Immortal Mansion than it had been for Wang Feng <sup>1</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A reminder about the joke that
any news about singer Wang
Feng seem to end up being
eclipsed by a bigger topic in
the media.)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling was already tired of reading the conjecture and comments online about Shuigou Sect. Some people speculated on the origins of this dark force, some seized the opportunity to campaign for a boycott of dark forces, while others @'ed official Weibo sites of various light forces and strongly requested that they declare their positions.</p>

    <p>This was similar to when a natural disaster had occurred in a particular place, and a group of netizens had zealously requested that a particular celebrity donate to help relief efforts...</p>

    <p>At this point, no one wanted to be associated with Shuigou Sect, and the light forces had their own considerations. The interplay of interests between forces was far more complicated than netizens could imagine.</p>

    <p>Moreover, at this time, there would always be people saying that the greater the power one had, the greater the responsibility. Wang Ling himself was reserving judgment on this statement.</p>

    <p>Because from such a verdict, it felt like that meant he had to help wipe all of mankind's asses for them...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Even Er Ha was feeling a little depressed because of the Shuigou Sect incident these two days. This was because Father Wang now had to pick Wang Ling up after school every day, which directly resulted in two hours less of Er Ha's afternoon walk. Originally, it was Father Wang who would take it for a walk after dinner. Once in a while, when he had a deadline, Mother Wang would do it.</p>

    <p>In the Wang family's small villa, Father and Mother Wang had the same rules for Er Ha as for Wang Ling; from beginning to end, it was the policy of learning to be low-key.</p>

    <p>The couple knew that Er Ha's previous identity hadn't been simple; it was a great demon king, which was all the more reason to not be remiss... hence, Father and Mother Wang actually regarded Er Ha as an ordinary akita, and when they went on walks, they normally put it on a leash.</p>

    <p>Not allowed to go out, Er Ha could only lie down in the Wang family's garden and look up at the sky.</p>

    <p>In fact, its dog days were really quite idle, unlike when it had been a demon king before, and had had to handle annoying clan matters daily... Life might seem boring now, but for Er Ha, it was pretty comfortable.</p>

    <p>It remembered watching the news with the old man a while ago as they followed an interview with today's university students.</p>

    <p>In front of the camera, these Golden Core students had bitterly criticized university teachers for being too strict. Whoever said that things would ease up once they got into a Golden Core university had been spouting empty nonsense; the training every day was worse than the college entrance exam, and they were dog tired...</p>

    <p>But to be honest, Er Ha didn't think it was that tiring to be a dog...</p>

    <p>As evening approached, it was feeling bored as it lay in the garden.</p>

    <p>Grandfather Wang had gone out on Sheep, Mother Wang was out buying groceries, Father Wang was still writing in his room, Little Master Ling was still doing his homework... There was no one to take Er Ha for a walk.</p>

    <p>So it could only lay about in the garden... couldn't it just carry its own leash and walk itself?</p>

    <p>Yawning, Er Ha was just about to switch positions, but as it lifted its head, it abruptly noticed a figure that had suddenly appeared on the road outside the Wang family's small villa. Immediately, all its dog fur stood on end.</p>

    <p>Er Ha thought it had pretty sharp senses and that they were by no means dull. The opposite side of the road had clearly been empty a few seconds ago; how could someone just suddenly appear?</p>

    <p>It got up, claws digging into the ground and its gaze alert as it stared ahead, already going into combat mode.</p>

    <p>But it didn't make a move, because the man wasn't giving off any killing intent.</p>

    <p>The man approached the Wang family's small villa slowly. As he drew closer, Er Ha realized that it was a balding middle-aged man with a receding hairline. He was wearing a rather casual white coat, floral underpants, and flip-flops, and this understated style caused Er Ha to go on high alert... This person's movements were truly frightening â€” he didn't make the slightest sound as he moved; it was as if he was walking on air.</p>

    <p>The man stood at the the villa gate and stared at Er Ha. He paused, then smiled slightly. "Relax, I'm not here to look for trouble. A friend pointed me in this direction; I have something I want to consult Ling Zhenren on."</p>

    <p>Who was he...?</p>

    <p>Er Ha's eyes were fixed on the man. Although the person wasn't emitting any killing intent, it could sense how dangerous he was. From the man's remarkable movements, it wasn't difficult for Er Ha to determine that this person was likely a killer or a wandering gentleman thief by trade.</p>

    <p>The middle-aged baldie stared at Er Ha with a harmless smile on his face. "Crackers Balls <sup>2</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(A snack by the Want Want Group..)</dfn>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha suddenly felt a little tired. Why was everyone who visited the villa all idiots?</p>
