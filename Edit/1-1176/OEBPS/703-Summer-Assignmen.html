  <h1>Chapter 703 Summer Assignment</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It could be said that General Yi's answer was unexpected, but it also made sense...</p>

    <p>In fact, given this explanation, the head of state immediately realized that many things about General Yi which he hadn't understood before could now be explained. No wonder when he recommended before that General Yi participate in the program "If You Are The One" to look for a partner, General Yi had adamantly refused... It turned out that he wanted to continue perfectly with the Boundless Sword Dao...</p>

    <p>After confessing his "secret," General Yi chuckled, his face triumphant as he stood at the door of the villa. "Excuse me, Your Excellency, shouldn't you come out now? And clearly explain your own identity while you're at it. This is part of our agreement."</p>

    <p>On the other side, the head of state was already standing behind the door. "Open the door..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>General Yi straightened his clothes, floated over, and opened the door.</p>

    <p>The result was that he was utterly gobsmacked by the person standing in front of him.</p>

    <p>H- H- Hea... Head of state?</p>

    <p>Really...</p>

    <p>It turned out that the person in the dark whom he had come to blows with was the head of state!</p>

    <p>General Yi immediately felt like there was blood lodged in the pit of his stomach which he couldn't spit out...</p>

    <p>- Wait, was it because he had opened the door the wrong way?</p>

    <p>General Yi slammed the door shut, and then opened it again.</p>

    <p>Okay, it was confirmed that this person was without any doubt the head of state himself...</p>

    <p>It was impossible for him to be an impostor; General Yi was very familiar with the head of state's aura.</p>

    <p>"Leader, why are you here?" General Yi straightened almost instantly and even stopped floating as both his feet directly touched the ground. He scratched the back of his head, an awkward expression on his face.</p>

    <p>Not far away, the driver in the car and the people in the supply van behind him were shocked when they saw this. From this angle, they couldn't see exactly who was standing inside the door... But there really weren't many people who could make General Yi talk to them with both his feet on the ground!</p>

    <p>The head of state chuckled. "It's a long story, let's go in and have a chat."</p>

    <p>General Yi nodded weakly. "Alright, Your Excellency... also, the matter just now..."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, it won't go any further than this villa." The head of state said, "Also, I have to apologize. This time, I took the opportunity to secretly feel out Little Yiyi; I even had doubts about you before..."</p>

    <p>"What sort of doubts did Your Excellency have?" Hearing these words, General Yi couldn't help breaking into a cold sweat.</p>

    <p>"Before, I introduced you to so many pretty old ladies, but you didn't like any of them... Actually, I've always wondered if there was a problem with your orientation."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"But after feeling you out just now, it seems that you accepted this compromise for the sake of abiding by your shifu's command." Saying this, the head of state patted General Yi on the shoulder and sighed deeply. "Little Yiyi, holding back all these years has been hard on you!"</p>

    <p>Hearing this sentence, tears welled up in General Yi's eyes despite himself.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the afternoon, it was Teacher Pan's chemistry class. Because Teacher Pan had asked for leave today, Lao Gudong would be taking over this period.</p>

    <p>However, Lao Gudong didn't use this opportunity to give a history lesson because he had already worked out his class schedule. He preferred to go at his own pace and wouldn't take over extra class time. For this sudden surplus of time, Lao Gudong would talk about something else.</p>

    <p>It so happened that the summer camp and the final exams were coming up, so he could spend the extra time talking about these two matters.</p>

    <p>After the final exams were the holidays and then the second semester.</p>

    <p>And it was only at this time that a lot of people realized: in the blink of an eye, there was only a semester left of Grade One...</p>

    <p>The trials of Grade Two were imminent.</p>

    <p>Life in Grade Two would be much more tiring compared with Grade One. If you wanted to relax in Grade Three, it was very important to lay a good foundation in Grade Two. And most important of all, students would be streamed into different classes in Grade Two according to their results in the final exams.</p>

    <p>Almost every year, there would be students from the elite classes who would be replaced by some students from the normal or even remedial classes due to their poor grades in Grade One. While this rarely happened, it would be absolutely disgraceful to be demoted from an elite class.</p>

    <p>One elbow propped up on the lectern, Lao Gudong said very meaningfully, "Actually, the grades in our class are pretty stable, and there isn't one especially poor kid, although Old Pan said that you were the worst class she ever had, at the start of school."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, Lao Gudong changed the subject. "Of course, the most stable person in our class is Student Wang Ling, who had just had a narrow escape."</p>

    <p>A lot of people couldn't help turning to look at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong: "Student Wang Ling's grades are almost always in the middle every time; if he's not ranked seventh, then he's eighth. One word: stable! Teacher Pan has also given Student Wang Ling a nickname in the office: Wang Wenjian<sup>1</sup>."</p>

    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Wang Wenjian is a live stream gamer. "Wen" ç¨³ also means "steady.")</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Actually, as long as everyone can demonstrate a steady level like Wang Ling in the Grade Two entrance exam... no one will be transferred out." When Lao Gudong said this, he even teased slightly, "If a student comes to my snack kiosk to buy something after being transferred out, I'll give him a fifty percent discount."</p>

    <p>When he said this, all the students looking at him in the class roared with laughter.</p>

    <p>Of course, it was still a little early to talk about this subject. After all, there was still one more semester to go. If someone who hadn't worked hard in the first semester made the most of the second semester and did their best, everyone could still happily be together in Grade Two.</p>

    <p>After that, Lao Gudong quickly switched to a mundane topic: the summer assignment.</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong slowly opened his mouth. "This year's summer assignment is a little difficult, but I believe that everyone will definitely be able to complete it."</p>

    <p>Of course, the summer assignment Lao Gudong was talking about was more than just about doing homework... The summer homework at Foundation Establishment high schools were nothing like those at regular high schools. Based on the experiences of Number 60 High senior graduates from previous years, the summer assignment basically involved students forming small groups to come up with research topics related to cultivation and perform experiments.</p>

    <p>Thus, when Lao Gudong said this, everyone basically had some idea in their hearts already.</p>

    <p>It was just that this year's summer assignment wasn't anything as simple as a mere research topic...</p>

    <p>"Considering how much more rampant criminals have become recently, all our Number 60 High teachers voted and have decided to set this year's summer assignment as: developing a killing technique. This is an individual research project, not to be carried out in groups. Simply put, you'll be designing a killing move for yourself..." Saying this, Lao Gudong narrowed his eyes enigmatically.</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Wang Ling stared at his own palm, lost in deep thought...</p>
