  <h1>Chapter 477 Er Ha's Thoughts </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Because he had been busy with exams lately, Wang Ling's attention had rarely been on other things, but now that he had taken two exams, he instantly felt a lot less stressed; one exam taken was one exam less - a lot of kids at this age shared Wang Ling's line of thinking. There were times when they had yet to finish all their exams, and maybe had just the last one left, but they would already begin to offload their burdens in high spirits at home.</p>

    <p>So after Wang Ling calmed down and thought back on things carefully, he realized that something indeed didn't seem right with Er Ha.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the first time Wang Ling felt that something was wrong was back when Er Ha had finished cultivating and had watched Daoist Guang's live stream in the small garden from beginning to end before directly giving Daoist Guang a large wave of floating red gifts... Wang Ling calculated that the gifts all added up to at least a thousand yuan in total! That was equal to his pocket money for a month!</p>

    <p>First of all, where had all that money come from? Wang Ling felt that he had to find out.</p>

    <p>Secondly, he also realized that Er Ha had been especially diligent in cultivating recently.</p>

    <p>If it had been a week ago, the guy would still have been lying asleep in the garden until the sun was at its peak at noon... Of course, that might have had a little to do with its narcolepsy, and while a single immersion in "holy beast blood" could help alleviate the symptoms, Wang Ling felt that it wasn't scientific to believe that it could transform Er Ha's indolent nature into a diligent one.</p>

    <p>Was it because of the inheritance talisman?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling pondered deeply at the table with his chin in his hands.</p>

    <p>But the issue was that the inheritance talisman also didn't have the effect of making a lazy dog diligent!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had the faint feeling that Er Ha was hiding something from him.</p>

    <p>And that it was a huge matter.</p>

    <p>The point was that, judging from Er Ha's current behavior, it probably wanted to solve it by itself.</p>

    <p>Although it was good of a dog not to cause its owner trouble and to ease its owner's worries, since they had a spirit beast contract, Wang Ling felt that he should act accordingly as Er Ha's owner. If anything should happen to it, he couldn't let Er Ha handle it on its own.</p>

    <p>However, Er Ha had a reason for not talking about it, and Wang Ling couldn't force it to tell him because it would make him appear domineering and a little inconsiderate of his dog.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that although he usually had a stiff face, he was in fact very gentle (denials not accepted).</p>

    <p>The old man was busy tending to his plants and flowers until a little past ten o'clock. Only then did he prepare to go out on Sheep to buy fish.</p>

    <p>The kitchen showdown between the old man and Jiang Haifu, the head of Kitchen Knife Sect, had yet to happen; during this time, the old man was experimenting with recipes for the showdown, and was preparing to invent a new fish dish. Since he was studying fish dishes, then naturally he would need to buy fresh fish as an ingredient. Frozen fish from the fridge would definitely lose out in terms of freshness.</p>

    <p>When it came to cooking, as long as a person put their heart into it, everyone could feel it.</p>

    <p>Why had season three of <em>A Bite of China </em>been castigated and ridiculed despite the high ratings for seasons one and two? The audience weren't fools as they could tell whether or not the people cooking were passionate about it.</p>

    <p>When the old man went out, he would usually take Er Ha with him.</p>

    <p>But in the last two days, he had noticed that Er Ha didn't seem to be at home.</p>

    <p>"Why is it always out recently?" The old man scratched his head, a little confused as he remembered that their dog didn't use to act like this.</p>

    <p>Mother Wang couldn't help laughing and said, "Dad, Er Ha isn't an ordinary dog, it also wants to cultivate. We can't treat it like a normal pet."</p>

    <p>"Right right right, it's a spirit dog. I almost forgot." The old man patted his head. "But I heard that a spirit beast actually eats a lot. We still save money with ours in the end!"</p>

    <p>Mother Wang nodded. "There are many students at Ling Ling's school who care for it. There's a Student Guo whose family runs a spirit beast store and he sends us customized dog food every week."</p>

    <p>"No wonder this dog food is different from the ones sold outside." Speaking up to this point, the old man specially urged Mother Wang to calculate the cost and pay Guo Hao back later.</p>

    <p>The old man felt that while generosity was generosity, it wasn't good to accept something for nothing.</p>

    <p>Even if Guo Hao didn't want the money, some of it had to be paid back to him.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, dad. I gave them money last time, but the store assistant at Student Guo's family's store refused to accept it. I visit their store once a week and buy some dog food, cat food and other things which I deliver to the shelters." The shelters Mother Wang was referring to was in fact a charity initiative under the Pet Trainers Guild which offered shelter to many homeless spirit beasts, most of which were cats and dogs.</p>

    <p>After living all these years, Mother Wang was after all well versed in the ways of the world and knew how to handle things tactfully.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao wasn't willing to take the money, but Mother Wang visited his family's store every week, and discerning individuals could tell what Mother Wang's intentions were. Those store assistants who handled the purchases got to know Mother Wang over time and felt that she was very wise!</p>

    <p>This was a direct representation of the Wang family's image.</p>

    <p>"Well done, Dongmei!" The old man couldn't help praising her.</p>

    <p>Actually, Mother Wang didn't have any other reason for doing this.</p>

    <p>Kindness could be passed on. Guo Hao had his own good intentions. What Mother Wang was doing was to pass on that kindness.</p>

    <p>Listening quietly to the conversation between Mother Wang and the old man from upstairs, Wang Ling felt warm in his heart.</p>

    <p>It was said that behind every strong man had to be an even stronger woman. Wang Ling felt that no matter how high his realm was or how powerful he was, the person propping this family up right now wasn't him, but Father Wang.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the image of Father Wang as a father forever loomed tall in Wang Ling's mind.</p>

    <p>And as the woman behind this powerful man, Wang Ling's image of Mother Wang in his imagination had become even more sublime.</p>

    <p>Although Mother Wang might not be aware of it, she had indeed groomed Lao Gudong and Daoist Taotie, these peak Itinerant Immortal epic-level killers, through her unfinished novel.</p>

    <p>Therefore, even if Mother Wang was only a housewife, she was a very strong housewife!</p>

    <p>Never look down on housewives...</p>

    <p>Because you never knew what a housewife did when she wasn't doing housework!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>While Wang Ling was feeling deeply moved in his heart, he heard the old man say, "But our dog staying out all day is no small thing. I had a colleague who also raised a small thing at home, but it was a cat. He didn't pay attention for a bit, and it brought a litter back."</p>

    <p>Mother Wang clapped a hand over her mouth in astonishment. "Er Ha wouldn't do such a thing, right..."</p>

    <p>"It's hard to say, sometimes feelings can sprout and it could fix its attention on a gorgeous female dog. So my advice is to simply proceed and take things all the way through."</p>

    <p>As he spoke, the old man imitated a pair of scissors with his hand. "Directly neuter it!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Ling and his mother in near unison sang a song in their hearts dedicated to Er Ha.</p>

    <p><em>Come back soon...</em></p>

    <p><em>You can't afford to be neutered <sup>1</sup> </em><em>...</em></p>
