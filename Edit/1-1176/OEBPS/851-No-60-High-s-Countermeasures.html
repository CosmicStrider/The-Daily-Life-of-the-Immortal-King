  <h1>Chapter 851 Number 60 High's Countermeasures</h1>

  <div>

    <p>There was a saying: soldiers should be like father and son when they go into battle...</p>

    <p>Because Li Hao invited his own father Li Diao to fight with him, DG High School successfully earned a new nickname: "Shameless."</p>

    <p>Parents essentially shouldn't be eligible to compete, but DG High School straightaway approved Li Diao's school admission, which meant that Li Hao's father Li Diao was now also a student at DG High School, as well as a foreign one.</p>

    <p>Songhai city had always been open to foreign students, and Li Diao met the relevant policy conditions, which was what allowed Li Hao and his father to be so shameless... According to the diplomatic privileges which foreign students had when studying abroad, Li Diao was free to apply to transfer schools, which was different from Li Hao's direct application.</p>

    <p>To put it bluntly, Number 60 High could reject Li Hao's unsolicited application, but it was in order to make DG High realize the error of its ways that Number 60 High accepted this unconventional challenge. However, Number 60 High didn't have the right to reject Li Diao's application, unless he failed the qualification test and was directly eliminated...</p>

    <p>In order to deal with this behavior of forcefully pulling in foreign aid, Number 60 High held an emergency discussion meeting of all the teams.</p>

    <p>This time, there were eight teams made up of elite students.</p>

    <p>It was Wednesday, August 16th.</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong was presiding over the meeting in the meeting room attached to the headmaster's office.</p>

    <p>Team 2's Guo Hao opened his mouth. "Our Team 2 should be the one to fight Li Hao!"</p>

    <p>Very quickly, someone said, "Let our Team 1 fight him!"</p>

    <p>"No, our Team 4 should be the one to go up!"</p>

    <p>"You must let our Team 2 fight!"</p>

    <p>Everyone was talking at once in the meeting room. Lao Gudong coughed lightly, and the room swiftly quieted down. "Stop arguing! One plan here, one plan there, who on earth should we listen to? If we don't win, it's my latiao that I'll lose."</p>

    <p>A boy with small eyes from Team 4 asked, "Teacher, then you should choose a stronger team, right? Or change the lineup. That Li Hao wants to bring his own father to the fight - if you send Team 3 up, there's no way Classmate Fang Xing can do it by himself! Classmate Wang Ling has always just been a mascot!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Team 4 Captain, how can you say that?" Guo Hao refuted. "We might be arguing who should go up because we're afraid Wang Ling will get hurt, but though he looks fragile, he's not as weak as you think. If you're not convinced, why don't you PK him?"</p>

    <p>"Don't mind me, bro! I didn't think it through..." The boy with small eyes was instantly terrified.</p>

    <p>Although he didn't acknowledge Wang Ling's strength, he thought that what he said just now indeed was a little inappropriate. He almost forgot that after the spirit sword exchange meet, plus a narrow escape from the space rift, Classmate Wang Ling had already become Number 60 High's male koi fish <sup>1</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Koi fish are a symbol of good luck in Asia.)</dfn>

    <p>And now, he was the school's favorite.</p>

    <p>"Whatever the case, Li Hao and his father are being very shameless." Lao Gudong chewed on a piece of latiao. "So we're not rushing into this battle to win, but to show everyone how shameless they are."</p>

    <p>"... Teacher, are you saying that we should let Team 3 lose on purpose?"</p>

    <p>"We can lose, but we don't have to."</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong shook his head. "Li Hao and his father will be coming with the intent to kill this time. They won't let Student Wang Ling and Student Fang Xing off so easily. So, our plan is to have Student Wang Ling stall Li Hao's father so that Student Fang Xing can beat Li Hao as quickly as possible. As long as Li Hao is defeated, we win."</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, Lao Gudong took out a packet of latiao from his pocket. "This packet of latiao is called 'shen tui deng yan <sup>2</sup> ' latiao. Student Wang Ling can eat one before the start of the match; when you're beaten up, you'll recover quickly from your injuries. One packet of latiao will stall Li Hao's father for three minutes, so Student Fang Xing must defeat Li Hao in three minutes."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Literally translates to "stretch
legs and widen eyes," and is
the name of a fictional pill
which can cure or resurrect a
person.)</dfn>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong: "This plan is also called 'Operation Sacrifice Mascot Wang Ling.'"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>In the end, he was still a mascot...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was Thursday, August 17th.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High's interview test for transfer students began and all the elite students were ready for action. Today was a very solemn day for everyone, because it concerned the reputation of the whole of Number 60 High School as well as the whole of Huaxiu's local cultivation education system.</p>

    <p>Losing to Li Diao was fine since he had an unfair advantage, but they absolutely couldn't lose to Li Hao!</p>

    <p>The war could be lost, but Li Hao had to die!</p>

    <p>Early that morning, a lot of students from Number 60 High's regular classes and even remedial classes posted all kinds of memes they had made on every major school's Tieba to cheer on the elite students.</p>

    <p>This produced a large, united response in the school circle: Number 59 High's Tieba, Reliance High's Tieba, Prime Elevation High's Tieba, God Vision High's Tieba... one by one they spontaneously responded to cheer on Number 60 High School's elite students.</p>

    <p>The main thing was that schools which initially had conflict or rocky relationships with each other inadvertently came together because of this incident.</p>

    <p>DG High's act of discrimination thus had monumental and progressive significance...</p>

    <p>Huaxiu's local cultivation schools drew closer to each other thanks to DG High School...</p>

    <p>In the lounge for the elite classes, Wang Ling and his fellows were waiting to be called for their turns in the 2v2 battle. Sun Rong and Chen Chao as Team 1 would go up first to fight Tang Jingze and Wu Yang.</p>

    <p>But it was clear that most people's attention weren't on this match, because there was a new image on the split screen from the lounge for transfer students on the other side.</p>

    <p>An imposing and burly, blond and blue-eyed man stepped into the lounge with a teenager who was also blonde, instantly attracting the attention of the whole lounge.</p>

    <p>"Li Hao and his father?"</p>

    <p>In the lounge, someone raised an eyebrow. "Two Golden Lion Kings <sup>3</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(From the novel "The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber..")</dfn>

    <p>"His father sure is big." Someone sighed.</p>

    <p>Everyone's eyes were filled with anger.</p>

    <p>It wasn't just the students in the lounge for elite classes, but the people in the lounge for transfer students disliked Li Hao and his father just as much.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Fang Xing, what do you think your chances of winning are?" someone asked Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>Li Hao's giant of a father made them feel more stressed. As Team 3's "main force," Fang Xing was in fact helping Wang Ling out by drawing a lot of the attention.</p>

    <p>"Play it by ear." Fang Xing smiled slightly, his expression as gentle as always.</p>

    <p>Actually, he was also very, very curious to know how long Li Hao's father could last against Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>But there was one thing that he could be sure of â€” if they won this match, he definitely would have to be the one to shoulder the wok.</p>

    <p>As the group of students were talking it over, Guo Hao suddenly exclaimed, "WTF! I received a photo of Li Hao!"</p>

    <p>Su Xiao was blank. "He's already here, why are you so flustered?"</p>

    <p>"It's not that!"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao held up his phone screen for everyone to see. "Look..."</p>

    <p>The Li Hao on the screen was that very burly and huge middle-aged man who had just entered the lounge for transfer students.</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling was shocked.</p>

    <p>Some students looked like parents...</p>

    <p>But this was too much!</p>
