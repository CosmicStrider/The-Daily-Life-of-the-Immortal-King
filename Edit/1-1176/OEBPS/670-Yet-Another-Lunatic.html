  <h1>Chapter 670 Yet Another Lunatic</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon's mentality had already collapsed.</p>

    <p>He had never encountered a situation as difficult as this before. His "Lightning Poisonous Dragon Drill" was his pride and joy, a great killing move that would make waves in the world! Of the fifteen Demon Hunters Association overseas returnees, Elder Ji Xing was undoubtedly the strongest, followed by Elder Yaren, who was famous for his Body Transformation Spell.</p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon was ranked fourth overall; third was that Elder Mingren who, after just arriving on Sun Island, had taken the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox into seclusion after its fur was all shaved off by a scary Huaxiu hairdresser...</p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon was only ranked fourth, but in terms of inhibition, his "Lightning Poisonous Dragon Drill" had a natural inhibitive effect on Elder Yaren's Body Transformation Spell!</p>

    <p>That was to say, while Elder Yaren had a strong self-healing ability, it would still be greatly impaired in the face of the "Lightning Poisonous Dragon." But what Elder Poisonous Dragon had used just now was his most powerful move, "Ninjutsu. Lightning Poisonous Dragon Drill Tenth Form: Aisin Gioro Right Hand Screw Rule"!</p>

    <p>In order to use this technique, he hadn't even hesitated to combine spirit energy with "chakra" as a second energy source, which was found only on Sun Island and which he had yet to completely master.</p>

    <p>Given that spirit energy and chakra weren't compatible, a price definitely had to be paid for using this skill.</p>

    <p>This was precisely what Lord Diulei had been thinking about earlier.</p>

    <p>After that incredibly powerful killing move, Elder Poisonous Dragon looked very unwell. He was a very thin person to begin with, but it was as if his energy had been drained dry by that move, reducing him to nothing but skin and bones.</p>

    <p>His eyes had sunk in deeply and his body was covered in a fine sheen of sweat; even his hair had instantly turned gray, making him look decades older.</p>

    <p>"As expected, he paid the price for it?" Chin in his hands, Lord Diulei then took out his little notebook and recorded down what he had seen. This was the aftereffect of a cultivator using a technique after combining the two incompatible energy sources of spirit energy and chakra. Information on the aftereffects which had been circulating online all this time was inaccurate; now, he finally had a real case which he could observe up close!</p>

    <p>It was just that Lord Diulei still couldn't understand why a combination of the two energy sources would cause so much damage to the body.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin walked over slowly and crouched down to look at Elder Poisonous Dragon, who was as frightened as a weak maiden targeted by a hoodlum.</p>

    <p>"Stay back! If you come any closer... I'll... I'll call the police!" Elder Poisonous Dragon took several steps back and shrunk into one corner of the wall. He was so weak that he already could no longer remain standing... The technique just now had been more harmful than he'd expected.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>Examining Elder Poisonous Dragon's condition, Xiao Yin in the end chewed on his fingernails and said, "He probably used the fat in his body as a medium, which is why he's this skinny now."</p>

    <p>"So it's a spell which converts fat into chakra, which incidentally serves as a flexible medium so that it doesn't clash with spirit energy?" Lord Diulei instantly understood and also noted this down since it was a very important discovery.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin crouched down and poked Elder Poisonous Dragon, who was shivering in the corner. Elder Poisonous Dragon had already fainted dead away and was muttering nonsense as if he was having a nightmare.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin sighed - yet another lunatic...</p>

    <p>Also, he realized something very important â€” it never ended well for anyone who came looking for trouble at Thunder's villa.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin pinched Elder Poisonous Dragon's face, and after confirming that the other party had passed out completely, he turned to look at Lord Diulei. "Should I call Little Master?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei gave a heartfelt sigh. Xiao Yin had already become an old hand at this.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, Zhuo Yi was dealing with Elder Yin's body when he got a call from Lord Diulei. Elder Yin had fallen to the ground, foaming at the mouth, and died from being poisoned. Neither Zhuo Yi nor Zhong Lang dared go near him.</p>

    <p>Because Elder Yin's body was still poisonous, it had to be handled with extreme caution.</p>

    <p>This was like encountering a viper in the desert; after killing it, you had to bury the head completely. This was because even though it was dead, its mouth still contained venom. If you were careless and pricked yourself on its fangs, you would also die.</p>

    <p>After all, the poison in this Elder Yin's body killed even him...</p>

    <p>So after Elder Yin died, Jingke, who had possessed Zhuo Yi, directly contained the driver of the van and then separated from Zhuo Yi and turned back into a peach wood sword.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi didn't dare touch Jingke directly until he put on a pair of white gloves in reverence.</p>

    <p>He had prepared these white gloves long before, in the event that when he fought alongside Lord Jingke one day, he would look a little more polite about it.</p>

    <p>"Looks like I guessed right. Someone really went after you, Senior Immortal," Zhuo Yi said on the phone.</p>

    <p>"Fortunately, it wasn't a big deal. We've taken care of this person," Lord Diulei replied.</p>

    <p>"I questioned the van driver just now; the person who went after you is an elder named Poisonous Dragon, ranked fourth among the fifteen Demon Hunters Association elites who returned from abroad." Zhuo Yi tsked. "How did Senior Immortal deal with him?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei laughed. "He couldn't do anything to us at all! Then he exhausted himself!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Brother Zhuo, what's the situation like over there? Do you need any help?"</p>

    <p>"Not for now."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi shook his head. "Since this Elder Yin's body is extremely toxic, we can't directly approach him. I already called the municipal office just now and I've asked them to close off this section of the road for the time being to passersby. The anti-chemical protection unit is on their way, and they'll be responsible for dealing with Elder Yin's body."</p>

    <p>"Then that's good. We've already restrained this Elder Poisonous Dragon. We'll wait for Brother Zhuo to come and handle this," Lord Diulei said.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Very well, Senior Immortal, after the anti-chemical protection team gets here and I've sorted out Elder Yin's body, I'll head over."</p>

    <p>The call then ended.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi sighed deeply and felt that he was suddenly very busy.</p>

    <p>Also, for some reason, he had a bad feeling.</p>

    <p>He looked at the end of the road, concerned about the late arrival of the anti-chemical protection team...</p>

    <p>It was clearly quite a while already since he had gotten the municipal office to inform the nearest police station to send an anti-chemical protection team to deal with this emergency. Logically speaking, they shouldn't be this slow.</p>
