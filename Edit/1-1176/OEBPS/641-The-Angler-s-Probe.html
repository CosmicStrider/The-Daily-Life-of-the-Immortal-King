  <h1>Chapter 641 The Angler's Probe</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After spewing the rotting liquid, the scavenger kun gradually calmed down. The Puppet Spell was an evil spell that was completely banned among human cultivators, given how malicious it was in principle: what it consumed wasn't the energy of the spellcaster, but the energy of the living being under the spell, who would continue to produce "energy" at the cost of their lifespan until they were dried up.</p>

    <p>When this spell first became prevalent thousands of years ago, those that were under the spell were slowly squeezed completely dry of all their energy by the spellcaster before they ultimately died, while the spellcaster wasn't the least bit harmed!</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan couldn't be sure whether this scavenger kun was being controlled through the Puppet Spell, but what was certain was that this particular spell worked pretty much in a similar way.</p>

    <p>As he pondered, a golden light flickered in the sky, and Er Ha and Xiao Yin plummeted down through the air, wrapped in Wang Ling's golden light shield.</p>

    <p>Since Er Ha's last visit to the demon world, Wang Ling had reset Lord Ma so that everyone who was transported through Lord Ma would have Wang Ling's golden light shield cast over them (except those whom Lord Ma flushed away).</p>

    <p>Er Ha and Xiao Yin landed in front of the giant body of the scavenger kun.</p>

    <p>"Senior Dog! What are you doing here?" Immortal Zhenyuan had a pleasantly surprised expression on his face.</p>

    <p>Er Ha was shaken as it stared at the scavenger kun which looked as if it was sleeping on the ground.</p>

    <p>They had been a step too late after all, but Zhenyuan looked fine, so the situation wasn't too terrible.</p>

    <p>"I had a feeling that the angler might come after you, so I decided to come and take a look."</p>

    <p>Er Ha nodded, and suppressed the shock it was feeling in its heart as it gave a knowing look. "Also, I specially made a weapon for you." With that, Er Ha lifted its eyes and motioned for Xiao Yin to hand over the "Three Views-Shattering Hammer."</p>

    <p>They had agreed on this operation in advance.</p>

    <p>When Xiao Yin passed the hammer over, he looked Immortal Zhenyuan up and down with a strange expression.</p>

    <p>This was Immortal Zhenyuan, the legendary cultivator in today's world of human cultivators?</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin felt that this red-haired young man in front of him wasn't that remarkable. In any case, he was definitely far inferior to Master. Otherwise, why couldn't he even tell that Er Ha next to him was pretending to be a senior?</p>

    <p>"Senior Dog, who is this lovely girl?" Immortal Zhenyuan looked at Xiao Yin.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "He's<sup>1</sup> my servant. I usually take him out for a walk. We just so happened to be coming by this way today, so I brought him along in passing."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A reminder that the vocalization of 'ta' as a third-person pronoun in Chinese doesn't distinguish between genders.)</dfn>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "I..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "See the collar around his neck?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>Fuck! He had brought this on himself!</p>

    <p>"I see!" Immortal Zhenyuan wore an enlightened expression.</p>

    <p>Earlier, he had thought it was a little strange that the girl had a collar around her neck, but after Er Ha's explanation, Immortal Zhenyuan completely figured it out.</p>

    <p>He scratched the back of his head and couldn't help giving praise. "That's just like Senior Dog. I see people walking their dogs all the time, but this is the first time I'm seeing a dog walk a person!" But although it was his first time, Immortal Zhenyuan didn't think it was strange at all.</p>

    <p>Strength had always been king in the cultivation world, and cultivators would choose to raise spirit beasts as pets. However, there was no rule which said that a strong spirit beast couldn't sign a reverse labor contract to hire a cultivator.</p>

    <p>Given Senior Dog's realm, it was normal for it to have several human servants, right?</p>

    <p>Still, Zhenyuan thought that this fair-faced girl's aura didn't feel human, and even less like a spirit beast...</p>

    <p>But Zhenyuan didn't dare ask too many questions. After all, it was their first meeting, and in front of Senior Dog to boot; if he raised too many questions, it would just look a little rude.</p>

    <p>"So it has stopped?" Er Ha looked at the huge monster in front of it and asked about the situation.</p>

    <p>"Yes, Senior Dog! This space fissure formed not very long ago, and I only noticed it when I was about to mend the rifts. I was going to plug up this crack, but this vicious thing came out of it. Just like what we saw at Demon Saint's Holy Palace the last time, there was a fishing line in this monster's belly. I cut it off with my life bonded magic weapon, Red Moon Blade Disk," Immortal Zhenyuan explained in detail.</p>

    <p>As he spoke, a reddish-gold blade disk the size of a millstone spun slowly behind him. This was the first time that Er Ha saw Immortal Zhenyuan's life bonded magic weapon.</p>

    <p>In fact, this Red Moon Blade Disk had shrunk down to this size; Immortal Zhenyuan could freely control its size.</p>

    <p>"Is there anything left of the cut string?" Xiao Yin was curious.</p>

    <p>"Part of it is still attached to this evil creature; the rest has already been swallowed up by the space fissure, and has probably been retrieved... I think it's similar to the Puppet Spell, and yet not. If it really was a pure Puppet Spell, controlling such a huge monster would be a little difficult."</p>

    <p>Resting his chin in his hands, Immortal Zhenyuan looked at Er Ha. "Does Senior Dog know what kind of spell this is?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha pretended to think about it deeply. "Hm, of course I know..."</p>

    <p>On the side, Xiao Yin looked like he was watching a great show. Er Ha had overreached in its acting, and Xiao Yin was dying to see what Er Ha was going to say.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "I know, but there's no need for me to say it myself. I'll let my servant, Xiao Yin, do the explaining..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..." You fucker!</p>

    <p>"What does Teacher Xiao Yin think?" Immortal Zhenyuan asked very carefully, even using an honorific.</p>

    <p>This Miss Xiao Yin might indeed be Senior Dog's servant, but who was Senior Dog? Even if Miss Xiao Yin was a servant, her identity definitely wasn't one Immortal Zhenyuan could mess with.</p>

    <p>Holy beasts and vicious beasts were originally archenemies, and while Xiao Yin hadn't had much contact with vicious beasts, he had already been aware of them from a very young age. That was when the holy beasts hadn't become extinct yet, and Dog Saint had yet to be turned into hot pot... It was a time when everything had been pretty good.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin gazed at the scavenger kun that looked as if it was fast asleep and frowned.</p>

    <p>The Puppet Spell, huh...</p>

    <p>This shouldn't really be possible; targets controlled by the Puppet Spell usually weren't too big. Several thousand years ago, the people who were adept in this art knew how to use the "Performance of a Hundred Puppets" technique, which meant that they could control a hundred puppets at the same time. Ultimately, however, these puppets were very small in size.</p>

    <p>It would be very difficult to achieve your goal by using the Puppet Spell alone to control such a huge vicious beast.</p>

    <p>"It's the Puppet Gu Spell<sup>2</sup>."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Refers to the 'gu' poison drawn from venomous bugs and typically used in black magic.</dfn>

    <p>Xiao Yin looked up and said all of a sudden.</p>

    <p>He had thought of a black magic spell that could boost the strength of the Puppet Spell to its absolute limit...</p>
