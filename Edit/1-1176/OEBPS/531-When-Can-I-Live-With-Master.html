  <h1>Chapter 531 When Can I Live With Master </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Frankly speaking, this was actually a pretty big misunderstanding... but Er Ha didn't think it could be blamed for it! People staring at you with evil intentions the moment you entered - anyone would misunderstand! The most important thing was that when Er Ha ran, this bunch had been hot on its heels - it would have been weird if it hadn't run!</p>

    <p>At that moment, it recalled a foreign prank show where a hundred people would be waiting around a street corner, and when a pedestrian crossed the street, they would straightaway rush out and chase the person. This was when instinct took over; although the person didn't know exactly what was going on, the first thing anyone would think of was to protect themselves!</p>

    <p>When the little captain drove Er Ha to Lord Diulei's front door, Er Ha was still feeling very embarrassed; who would have thought it would encounter this sort of hiccup on its first visit here?</p>

    <p>When it entered the villa, it saw the little captain pull Lord Diulei into one corner to give an account of what had happened earlier.</p>

    <p>"Mr Thunder, your dog..."</p>

    <p>"Oh, it isn't mine, it's my fellow brother's dog. It's a guest at my place today."</p>

    <p>"I see..."</p>

    <p>The little captain rubbed his head. "I think there's something mentally wrong with your brother's dog. When we were going to welcome it earlier, it looked like it got scared, and we chased it for a long time until we brought it over here."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei broke out in a sweat.</p>

    <p>Actually, he himself hadn't thought things through properly. Because the furor from the recent Demon Hunters Association incident had yet to subside, Brother Dog might appear indifferent, but as long as it was outside, it actually would always be on high alert and would be suspicious of any unfamiliar gaze on it. If Lord Diulei had known earlier, he wouldn't have had those guards assemble such a huge team - he should have just asked them to give a greeting straightaway and let Er Ha in!</p>

    <p>"Thanks for your trouble." Lord Diulei very courteously took out a pack of immortal spirit cigarettes. "Please share this with your fellow brothers later!"</p>

    <p>These cigarettes were actually quite expensive and ordinary people couldn't afford them, but Lord Diulei didn't have a habit of smoking. However, the companies he collaborated with on the forum would give him cigarettes during festival season, so they had piled up at home. He wasn't in any rush to deal with them, so he simply used them as gifts for other people.</p>

    <p>The little captain wasn't reserved at all as he grinned and directly accepted the cigarettes. "Thank you, Mr Thunder." This was actually a pretty common thing in an upscale villa estate - these cigarettes might be very expensive, but for the wealthy staying there, these were just equivalent to giving out a dozen or twenty tips.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei waved his hand. "It's nothing. If my friend's green-furred dog comes again, you can just let it through. It'll find my place itself."</p>

    <p>"Very well, Mr Thunder."</p>

    <p>The little captain nodded, then abruptly thought of something as he said, "Oh, by the way, Mr Thunder, the villa estate has a pet center which offers owners' pets free medical assistance and psychological counseling services."</p>

    <p>"Mm..." Lord Diulei nodded. Of course he knew of this pet center!</p>

    <p>But there was no way he could directly say that there was something mentally wrong with his brother's dog!</p>

    <p>So Lord Diulei simply said, "You don't have to worry too much about this. Have you heard about the recent incident with the Demon Hunters Association? That's the reason why my brother's dog was so wary; it's just for these few days."</p>

    <p>"So it's like that!"</p>

    <p>The little captain immediately understood, and then sighed. "But Mr Thunder, I recommend that it would still be better for it to get psychological counseling. Sometimes it's not good to be so stressed!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei didn't want to go on chatting with him since he knew the villa estate's pet center was running a campaign. Free medical treatment and consultations were good and all... but some of their special services weren't free! Like hair treatment, dyeing and perming.</p>

    <p>In his experience, if he continued talking with this little captain, the topic would shift to "getting a VIP card."</p>

    <p>And so, he could only politely and tactfully decline. "I should attend to my guest. Little captain, don't let me interrupt your work. Also, the pet center might not necessarily be able to do anything for Brother Dog's state of mind."</p>

    <p>The little captain: "Why not?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei made up an excuse. "It was bitten by a dog before!" He said it so earnestly that even he himself almost believed it!</p>

    <p>The little captain: "..."</p>

    <p>When he came back to his senses, Lord Diulei had already disappeared.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When Er Ha entered the villa, it noticed a hole in the floor...</p>

    <p>It was Xiao Yin who had punched the floor open the last time Wang Ling was here. Instead of repairing it, Lord Diulei had just left it as it was, then embellished the rim of the hole slightly so that it was pleasing to the eye at least.</p>

    <p>When Er Ha stuck its head inside for a look, it happened to see Xiao Yin sitting crossed-legged on the broccoli sofa in the basement! No wonder he hadn't seen the text message! On the coffee table in front of the sofa lay a crispy noodle snack packet which Little Master Ling had enchanted before.</p>

    <p>Just as Er Ha jumped down through the hole, Xiao Yin exhaled in that moment and muttered to himself, "Mm... cultivation complete!"</p>

    <p>So fast?</p>

    <p>Er Ha was startled.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin laughed aloud. "Master's crispy noodle snack is really effective! I can feel how much more vigorous my spirit energy is!"</p>

    <p>Saying that, Xiao Yin shook the crispy noodle snack on the table, which had already been tied up with a rubber band.</p>

    <p>"I was planning to cultivate today, but when I heard you were coming to see me, I only had a mouthful - I never thought it would still take me so long to digest Master's crispy noodle snack!" Xiao Yin licked the powder off his fingers.</p>

    <p>The corners of Er Ha's eyes twitched. "Why don't you just finish it in one go?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin shook his head. "In one go? How can I? I have anime to watch tonight!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha almost puked blood when it heard this. "..." This guy was already becoming a shut-in!</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin counted on his fingers. "Think about it, every day I have to make the time to eat, watch anime, read manga and also research how to make Master like me eeeeeeven more! Finally, I still have to make time for Thunder to brush me, and now I have to make even more time to digest the crispy noodle snacks Master gave me in order to accelerate my cultivation! Aiya, there really isn't enough time!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "How much money do you spend a month?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin waved his hand. "Not much, not much, just a few million."</p>

    <p>When he said this, Xiao Yin glanced at Er Ha. "By the way, when can I move to live with Master?"</p>

    <p>"Live together? Forget it..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha let out a sigh. "He can't afford you..."</p>
