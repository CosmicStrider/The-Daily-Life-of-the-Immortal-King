  <h1>Chapter 377 Pushing Large Butterfly </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Lying on the ground, Er Ha finished filling in the registration form, and Wei Zhi helped it hand the form to the receptionist at the front desk. When he saw the writing on it, he was extremely astonished; it was in a slender goldstyle <sup>1</sup> that many people might try to emulate but not necessarily achieve. Although the words had been written with a dog's paw, they were very neat, so much so that they looked like they had been printed.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The "slender gold" style of calligraphy invented by Emperor Huizong refers to how his writing resembled twisted and curved gold filament.)</dfn>

    <p>"How did you make it so perfect?" Wei Zhi was now more and more curious about Er Ha. He felt that this was definitely a dog with a story to tell!</p>

    <p>"I practice assiduously." Er Ha's answer was just three words.</p>

    <p>As it spoke, Er Ha's eyes seemed a little pleased, but it didn't show much excitement on its face. It didn't know whether it was because it had been with Ling Zhenren for so long, but Er Ha felt that it was obviously using a lot less facial expressions, and it was tending slightly toward using a poker face.</p>

    <p>"You're really interesting. If it's possible, I'd really like to meet your owner," Wei Zhi said.</p>

    <p>"If there is an opportunity."</p>

    <p>Er Ha's reply was very polite.</p>

    <p>From this response, Wei Zhi instantly understood that there was no way this bizarre green-furred akita would ever help him meet its owner.</p>

    <p>But Wei Zhi felt that he would still be able to find its owner even without its help! The owner's name and home address were on the registration form it had just filled in! When he helped Er Ha submit the form, Wei Zhi sneakily took a photo! He could search for the address himself!</p>

    <p>What kind of person could raise such a bizarre akita... Wei Zhi was more and more curious!</p>

    <p>Seeing Wei Zhi's "triumphant" expression, Er Ha couldn't help laughing in its heart on the side.</p>

    <p>In the end he was still a youngster.</p>

    <p>Too young!</p>

    <p>Er Ha had in fact been aware of Wei Zhi secretly taking a photo, but it wasn't worried at all... because this type of information lifted on the sly would definitely be affected by the "Great Shielding Spell" and became a lump of mosaic tiles.</p>

    <p>After waiting in front of the reception desk for a while, a staff member quickly entered Wei Zhi and Er Ha's data into the computer before giving them two number plates. "Please proceed to the test hall up ahead and wait for your turn to be tested."</p>

    <p>Er Ha held the number plate in its mouth; it was number 177, and Wei Zhi was number 176.</p>

    <p>After a clear look at the number plate, Er Ha raised its head. Its mouth glowed with faint spirit light, and then it used the "Space Swallowing Spell" to put away the number plate, since it would be in the way if it hung off Er Ha's body.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi was even more amazed when he saw this scene. "What spell is this?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha replied, "Nothing much... it's a very common spatial spell so that I can store things in my mouth."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Wei Zhi swore. "The Mouth Escape Technique <sup>2</sup> ?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(An online term that can mean variously to persuade someone with your words or talk your way out of things.)</dfn>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>A person and a dog made their way toward the test hall. The assessment center was very big, and it was very easy for anyone who was here for the first time to get lost. But Er Ha appeared quite calm as it strode forward without the slightest bit of hesitation.</p>

    <p>"There's a map over there, shall we go take a look?" Wei Zhi asked.</p>

    <p>"No need." Er Ha shook its head.</p>

    <p>Before making their way to the test hall, Er Ha had already remembered the aura of the man who had been in front of Wei Zhi in the queue. Now it just followed that person's aura. The man had already arrived at the test hall and his aura had already settled down, so there was absolutely no mistake.</p>

    <p>While this wasn't Wei Zhi's first visit to an assessment center, it was in fact his first time at this particular one. He followed behind Er Ha, and finally, they really did reach their destination.</p>

    <p>After that, his regard for Er Ha increased even more.</p>

    <p>Able to speak, to write, to use the Mouth Escape Technique and to even navigate... This was simply a must-have pet for home or travel!</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wei Zhi had already made up his mind — when he went back, he would get a dog!</p>

    <p>When they arrived at the test hall, there were a lot of people waiting in line. Er Ha's gaze swept over the ten-odd people in front of it. The assessment wouldn't be as quick as filling in the form had been, so it would probably have to wait a while. However, those in line could watch live images of the spirit beasts currently being tested on crystal screens in the center of the test hall.</p>

    <p>These images were only broadcasted with the owners' consent; without their permission, they wouldn't be played publicly.</p>

    <p>But most of them had full confidence in their spirit beasts, so they all gave their consent - this was an opportunity to show off publicly and to satisfy their vanity. As long as their soul pets were strong enough, the owners would also be acclaimed.</p>

    <p>Er Ha gazed at the crystal screen for room number 2 in the test hall; it was showing images of a brawny rabbit which was currently being tested. At a height of one hundred and sixty centimeters, the rabbit was unusually large and packed with muscle from head to toe. It was wearing boxing gloves on both hands, and looked quite terrifying. But maybe because of its owner's bad taste, the rabbit's ears were tied into a bow.</p>
    
    <p>"Muscular Spirit Rabbit?"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi recognized the breed at a glance, and then began to analyze this rabbit. "The color of its coat is not bad! And its muscles are well-developed! I'm guessing it's at least fourth class. It's a strength-type spirit beast good at quick attacks. It's already a sixth-class beast as an infant, and the highest level it can advance to is third class. But raising one is pretty difficult since this type of spirit rabbit is particularly vulnerable to illness as an infant. The advantage is that once you've nurtured and raised it, it's very loyal and can be used in all kinds of combat."</p>

    <p>Er Ha nodded its head slightly. It hadn't expected Wei Zhi to know so much despite his young age.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi crouched down beside Er Ha and smiled slightly. "I'll tell you a secret..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "???"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "This rabbit has already been neutered."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi sighed and said, "Besides being particularly vulnerable to illness, this is the second biggest flaw of this kind of rabbit — it has a very lusty appetite. If you don't control it and you let it roam free for a year, it'll bring back an army coalition for you."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Just like that, one person and one dog made inane conversation in front of the doors; during this time, Er Ha tried to speak as little as possible and did its best to be an inconspicuous dog. However, because of the waves Wei Zhi had stirred up earlier, most of the people who had come for the test today were impressed by Er Ha; they had still been pointing Er Ha out right up until it had been about to enter the test hall.</p>

    <p>Soon, it was finally Wei Zhi's turn.</p>

    <p>"Brother Dog, I'm going first!" Wei Zhi crouched down and rubbed Er Ha's head, taking the opportunity to grope it.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Very quickly, the scene of Wei Zhi and his spirit butterfly taking the test was projected on a screen.</p>

    <p>The first session was the strength test.</p>

    <p>A strength testing machine had been set up in the center of the test room which would give a corresponding strength value after one blow by the spirit beast.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi's butterfly flew over unhurriedly and stopped in front of the testing machine.</p>

    <p>Everyone watched this scene...</p>

    <p>Two seconds later, they all heard a fierce explosion.</p>

    <p>Er Ha was startled when it saw the value revealed by the testing machine. Such a small spirit butterfly... actually had a strength of two thousand <em>jin </em>...</p>

    <p>"What the hell, what kind of butterfly is this?" someone next to Er Ha exclaimed.</p>

    <p>Another person who was staring at the screen said hesitantly, "It looks like... a Pushing Large Butterfly <sup>3</sup> ?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(The Chinese adaptation and loose transliteration of the name of the butterfly Pokemon Butterfree is 'badahu.' The author has used a homonym for 'ba' which means 'push .. ')</dfn>

    <p>"Pushing Large Butterfly?"</p>

    <p>"That's right. The pupa of this butterfly species is very, very thick, and it's as large as a basketball. They have to push their way out of the pupa layer by layer; that's why they're called Pushing Large Butterflies."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..." Were they onions?</p>
