  <h1>Chapter 279 Wang Lost On a Journey<sup>0</sup> </h1>

  <div>
  
    <dfn><sup>0</sup>(This is a play on the title of the movie 'Lost On A Journey,'人在囧途. At the same time, 囧 is used as an emoticon to represent embarrassment, sadness, frustration etc.)</dfn>

    <p>Sometimes, coincidences like this just happened.</p>

    <p>Of course, Wang Ling preferred to call it "doomed fate."</p>

    <p>Given the way Fang Xing behaved toward him, he guessed that this guy had already recognized him. If what Lord Diulei said was true, and Fang Xing had been the first witness at the scene, then he would definitely have seen Wang Ling kill the demon king in one strike and Cailian Zhenren cuddling him.</p>

    <p>But at that time, Wang Ling had just been a small shota!</p>

    <p>What was more, he remembered that in the last few years, he had been using a technique to mold his face and moderately change his appearance. Yet Fang Xing had recognized him?</p>

    <p>He couldn't quite figure it out.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei had thought that they would be very happy to see each other, but now he could clearly sense that something wasn't right with Wang Ling after seeing Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei saw this Ling Zhenren, who always had on a poker face, reveal a rare hint of awkwardness in his expression, and the other man came over to hide behind his back, using it to shield him from Fang Xing's gaze.What was this?</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was at a bit of a loss.</p>

    <p>Next to Fang Xing, Cailian Zhenren smiled unperturbedly.</p>

    <p>Staring at his face, she was completely entranced... to describe him in her native dialect, this boy was such a hunk <sup>1</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(贼俊 or 'zeijun' is from a Northeast Chinese dialect.)</dfn>

    <p>"So you were there six years ago?" Cailian Zhenren was surprised. "All these years, I've actually been looking for witnesses from back then; I never thought that the very first one would actually be Student Fang Xing."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing scratched his head with some embarrassment. "Actually, that day six years ago, we were preparing to relocate our noodles shop. Just as we were about to move out, a toad fell from the sky."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>"Wait a minute!"</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja asked, "Then why did Brother Fang Xing move back there?"</p>

    <p>Fang Xing laughed. "My dad said that the toad invited wealth; wherever a toad lands, riches will follow."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>"That's why we moved back in after the government completed the post-disaster reconstruction. It was only recently that I came to Songhai city and transferred schools, and I help with my family's business when I have the time," Fang Xing said.</p>

    <p>Everyone nodded. "So that's it!"</p>

    <p>Anyone who became part of the chat group had to have a clean family background at the very least. Since Lord Diulei had approved him, everyone else in the group naturally had nothing else to say.</p>

    <p>"If you have anything else you want to talk about, we can do it after we get on the train. From now on, Fang Xing is our brother." Lord Diulei put his hands on his hips, grinned with a mouth full of white teeth, and said, "And one more thing: Brother Fang Xing and Ling Zhenren are currently studying at the same high school."</p>

    <p>When he said this, Wang Ling remained expressionless, but everyone else exclaimed in surprise.</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang: "Is it the trend nowadays to study in high school?"</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja was clearly excited as he stared at Lord Diulei and asked, "Senior Immortal, is Ling Zhenren and Brother Fang Xing's school still short of people? I also want to be a transfer student!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei laughed. "There's no way the school will take in students who look too old, right?"</p>

    <p>"That's right, that's right!" Cailian Zhenren tidied up her appearance. "If they're looking for students, it's probably someone like me!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "It doesn't take in busty aunties either."</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>...Lord Diulei had booked train tickets with consecutive numbers, and their seats were in the last three rows of carriage number four. Cailian Zhenren chose to sit in the first row by herself, while Wang Ling straightaway chose the window seat in the last row, perfectly hiding himself in the corner.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei had initially been sitting in the middle next to Wang Ling, but Wang Ling hadn't expected that Fang Xing would ask to switch seats with the other man once they got on the train. After they switched, Fang Xing then looked brightly at Wang Ling and smiled happily.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, Classmate Wang Ling, I won't tell anyone your secret." He looked at Wang Ling as he passed his words on telepathically.</p>

    <p>This astounded Wang Ling — he hadn't expected the other party to be capable of using the "Mind-Reading Ability." Even Lord Diulei had yet to master it.</p>

    <p>To Wang Ling, Fang Xing this person was an unpredictable element. Even if Lord Diulei had thoroughly investigated his family background, he felt that he still needed to pay special attention to this person.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei sat next to them with an awkward expression, and the air felt unusually cold.</p>

    <p>They were schoolmates, shouldn't they be caring toward each other??</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei sighed in his heart; no wonder people would poison their roommates nowadays <sup>2</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is sadly a reference to a
handful of actual student
cases in China.)</dfn>

    <p>At that moment, Lord Diulei's imagination started to run wild — he couldn't picture what it would be like if Wang Ling and Fang Xing graduated high school, got into the same university, and ended up in the same dormitory... He felt that if they lived together, they would never need to turn the air-con on in summer, or could even do without a fridge — the entire room would just be like an igloo!</p>

    <p>And so, to break the awkwardness, Lord Diulei hurriedly smoothed over the situation once he saw an opportunity. "Brother Fang Xing, what did you bring with you?"</p>

    <p>He noticed that Fang Xing this time hadn't come barehanded, and actually had on a backpack.</p>

    <p>"Nothing much, actually," Fang Xing replied. "We're going to teach the dark forces in Winter city a lesson, so I thought seniors in the group would definitely be bringing their own individual magic treasures in preparation. I don't have any magic treasures that I can bring with me, and I'm not going to teach fish how to swim in front of seniors. Actually, I just have snacks in this bag."</p>

    <p>"Snacks?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei smiled. "Brother Toya has fasting pills on him; if we get hungry, we just need to eat a pill!"</p>

    <p>"No, our family's noodles are not the same as fasting pills. Not only can they sate your hunger, they can also quickly replenish strength and spirit energy." After saying that, Fang Xing directly took out a wrapped noodle box — only his family's noodles shop used this packaging. "When you're eating, you just need to pour some spirit energy into the packaging, and the noodles will automatically heat up. Oh, by the way, apart from replenishing your strength and spirit energy, it can also rapidly heal any external injuries you might have!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei twitched his lips. "..." Was this the freaking senzu bean <sup>3</sup> ?!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(This is from 'Dragonball..')</dfn>

    <p>After hearing Fang Xing's introduction, Dharmaraja, who was sitting in the front row, was very interested, and he turned around to ask, "Brother Fang Xing, it sounds good, but it's a little troublesome to eat noodles; do you have a simpler version?"</p>

    <p>"I do!"</p>

    <p>After saying that, Fang Xing directly took out a sparkling packet. "This is our family's crispy noodle snack. You don't need to heat it up, you can straightaway open it and eat it!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Was it his imagination?</p>

    <p>It seemed like Ling Zhenren's throat had bobbed just now...</p>

    <p>Brother Ling!</p>

    <p>Pull yourself together! Brother Ling!</p>
