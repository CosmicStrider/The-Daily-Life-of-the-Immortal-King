  <h1>Chapter 475 Wei Zhi's Worry </h1>

  <div>

    <p>They had originally met at the assessment center and then had experienced so many things together. For Wei Zhi, he and Er Ha shared a fate that was already no longer so shallow; they could even bump into each other online, which seemed a little incredible.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi couldn't help sighing with feeling as he directly typed a string of words into the private chat window on the spellmaster platform: "Online marriages are connected by a single line <sup>1</sup> , our meeting was fated."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is adapted from the
online phrase "The Internet is
connected by a single
communication line" which is
generally the first half of a
sentiment denoting
friendship.)</dfn>

    <p>Er Ha stared at these words, feeling like it had heard them before, and was immediately stunned. "Do you also watch Lord Island's live stream?" When it was typing, Er Ha took extreme care to clearly differentiate between the nickname "Lord Island" and the Daoist name "Daoist Guang." Given that most people didn't know Lord Island's true identity, Er Ha naturally wouldn't let it out.</p>

    <p>"That's right, wasn't this a line Lord Island said before? This Lord Island is so awesome! He's a new live streamer, but it hasn't even been a week since he started and there are already several million viewers," Wei Zhi said in the chat window.</p>

    <p>Er Ha hadn't expected Daoist Guang's live stream to attract so much attention; almost everyone around it was watching it.</p>

    <p>It realized that actually, it had a lot to talk about with Wei Zhi. It didn't know whether or not it was because Wei Zhi was frequently in contact with spirit beasts, but it felt that Wei Zhi gave off a sense of empathy.</p>

    <p>One of the most important indications that you could become friends was being able to talk.</p>

    <p>So if you really had to say it, Er Ha felt that it had three friends now: one was Guo Hao, one was Xiao Yin and the last was Wei Zhi.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao was a good pal who generously supplied Er Ha with dog food tailored for it.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin and Er Ha were of the same kind, and it could tease this naive person.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi was a person whom Er Ha had already had an adventure with. You could say they had things in common, which was the most crucial point! This person was Guo Hao's legendary uncle! Though this uncle obviously wasn't a biological one, he was still one of Guo Hao's many uncles!</p>

    <p>In Er Ha's opinion, Guo Hao's uncles were no less mysterious than Lord Diulei's friend, the all-powerful Little Black who ran a secret laboratory on the border, and the Immortal Zhenyuan whom everyone had heard of but never seen.</p>

    <p>As for Wang Ling... the reason why Er Ha didn't include Little Master Ling in its circle of friends was much simpler.</p>

    <p>Little master was forever little master; the distinction had to be clearly made!</p>

    <p>A friend was for sharing your feelings with and the little master was a big thigh to hug...</p>

    <p>Er Ha was thoroughly clear on this point.</p>

    <p>"When did you become a spellmaster and start taking in disciples? Aren't you a pet trainer?" Er Ha started to ask after they had exchanged greetings.</p>

    <p>"It's a side business; there are also different types of spellmasters. As pet trainers who, after all, are very familiar with spirit beasts, a lot of us serve as spellmasters who specialize in teaching skills to spirit beasts."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi said, "Besides, you've also seen my place. Do you think I don't need money to set up that high-tech green environment? I also have several rooms that have yet to be optimized, and all of these need money! My monthly electricity bill alone is so high."</p>

    <p>Er Ha was surprised. "Isn't your family quite rich?"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "I'm someone with a dream."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "Don't look at my situation right now, the money I'm earning is at least enough for me to live on. But when all is said and done, I'm raising so many animals. It isn't just Pushing Large Butterfly, I also have to take care of the other spirit beasts that I have contracts with! The electricity bill is peanuts if you think about how much I spend on food...</p>

    <p>"I set a goal for myself, which is to form contracts with at least two spirit beasts every year. At the beginning of this year, I formed a contract with a spirit python called Big Snake End, and this guy can really eat! So in the later half of the year, I formed a contract with Pushing Large Butterfly. Do you know why?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Why?"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "Because it doesn't eat much!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>If things continued like this, Wei Zhi felt that he would quickly become so poor that he would have to change from raising spirit beasts to raising insects... though spirit bugs were also classified as spirit beasts.</p>

    <p>Compared with large spirit beasts, a lot of pet trainers felt that these smaller spirit bugs were actually tacky and embarrassing.</p>

    <p>Of course, there were spirit bugs that were larger in size, but Wei Zhi's current problem was how costly his food expenses were. The larger the spirit beast, the more it ate, which would probably be no less than his Big Snake End.</p>

    <p>Since he had chosen to form contracts with spirit beasts and become the number one pet trainer one day, Wei Zhi felt he should be responsible for the spirit beasts he had contracts with.</p>

    <p>"So you're doing this side business for money?" Er Ha hadn't thought that given Wei Zhi's identity, he would actually be short of money.</p>

    <p>"Yes, that's why I have several jobs at the moment. I work mainly as a pet trainer, but I'm also a spellmaster in the field of spirit beasts, and I specialize in teaching other people's spirit beasts how to cultivate skills." Wei Zhi sighed and typed with a plaintive air, "Sometimes, I also do power leveling..."</p>

    <p>"Power leveling?"</p>

    <p>"Helping other people take their spirit beasts out to cultivate until they've gone up one level before coming back!" Wei Zhi said. "I can make a fast buck with this! But it's also the least used service! For professional pet trainers like us, we can only rely on these types of methods to make money since our realms aren't very high. That's why food expenses are such a big problem!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>As someone who had once been the tenth generation leader of the Tuntian Ha clan, Er Ha was actually well aware from experience why spirit beasts could eat so much.</p>

    <p>In those days, the entire Toad clan had had to consume more than a hundred million tons of flies each day. Furthermore, these flies were different from the ones in the human world: they were gigantic monster flies, and each monster fly was as big as an elephant.</p>

    <p>Cultivators were particular about fasting: the higher their realm, the less they would eat.</p>

    <p>But spirit beasts were quite the opposite, and they actually ate a lot. Why had Lord Diulei put so much money into Xiao Yin's e-wallet? Most of it was actually for Xiao Yin's food expenses so that he could use it to order take-out.</p>

    <p>From this comparison, Er Ha immediately realized that its appetite seemed pretty small since it ate almost the same amount as an ordinary domestic spirit dog - it didn't know whether or not this was because it was cultivating the "Demon King Heart Sutra" as modified by Little Master Ling...</p>

    <p>"By the way, Brother Dog, did you really look for my little disciple's store because you wanted to learn a level five spirit technique?" Wei Zhi asked.</p>

    <p>Er Ha tapped on the keyboard: "Oh, no... I don't have any level five spirit techniques, I just wanted to tease him a bit, that's all."</p>

    <p>"That's what I thought..." Wei Zhi nodded.</p>

    <p>Given Er Ha's character, he didn't think there was anything illogical about it.</p>

    <p>However, he couldn't help sighing as he replied, "High-class beast spells nowadays are too hard to come by. A level five spirit beast skill volume, with copyright and shares included, can buy two apartment units in Jinghua's first ring! The only level five skill volume I've ever seen in my life was a spirit beast transformation spell; it's a little like a cultivator's magical transformation spell, except that this spell can even imitate aura."</p>

    <p>"Oh?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha tsked. "Is there such a thing?"</p>

    <p>"Didn't my disciple recommend their store's 'Crying Attack'? Actually, this close combat spirit technique is part of a set with the spirit beast transformation spell I mentioned just now. They were both created by a person called Crying Old Immortal. And this person is the vice president of our Pet Trainers Guild," Wei Zhi explained.</p>

    <p>Er Ha nodded. "I see... what is this spirit beast transformation spell called? I'll take a look at it later."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "It's called 'Little Ying's 100 Transformations <sup>2</sup> '!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(The character 'ying' is the
kanji for 'sakura.' This refers
to the "Cardcaptor Sakura"
manga and anime magical girl
series ..)</dfn>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>
