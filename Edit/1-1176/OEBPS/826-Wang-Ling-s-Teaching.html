  <h1>Chapter 826 Wang Ling's Teaching</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was always difficult for people to believe in things beyond their ken. More often than not, they preferred to believe in things that were within their ability to understand.</p>

    <p>So when King of Killers got up from the ground, he had a terrible feeling - Lord Diulei's sudden appearance, as well as this level of strength, couldn't be described in words; it was already far beyond his reckoning.</p>

    <p>With a mere flick of his finger, Lord Diulei had in a split second sent him flying through a dozen mountains...</p>

    <p>Marshal Jiang also felt that this scene was inconceivable.</p>

    <p>In that moment, he took a deep breath...</p>

    <p>While they had concluded in their discussion on the immortal warship that this Lord Diulei wasn't a simple person, seeing this explosive power with his own eyes still made this renowned Battle Saint shudder.</p>

    <p>If it wasn't for Ultimate King of Killers, the Ten Generals might never have any idea at all what kind of expert Lord Diulei was.</p>

    <p>Yet at the same time, Marshal Jiang had some doubts.</p>

    <p>Logically speaking, Lord Diulei had already hidden himself very well.</p>

    <p>So why had he chosen to expose himself in front of everyone on such an occasion today?</p>

    <p>Of course, perhaps it wasn't as complicated as Marshal Jiang imagined...</p>

    <p>Today was the Office of Strategic Deception's sect celebration, and a person had come to make trouble. As the sect leader, it was in fact reasonable for Lord Diulei to act.</p>

    <p>This was how Marshal Jiang explained it to himself.</p>

    <p>Ultimate King of Killers admitted that he had never been in as difficult a situation as this before. After smashing through a series of mountains, his crash landing kicked up dust as far as the eye could see. When he got up from the ground, he could even feel his legs shaking uncontrollably.</p>

    <p>One had to know that this was Blademaster's body. Even without deliberately putting up a protective barrier, his body was protected by sword qi.</p>

    <p>Logically speaking, falling to the ground shouldn't hurt.</p>

    <p>But that finger just now had directly flicked his soul.</p>

    <p>Blademaster's body looked unscathed, but Ultimate King of Killers felt like he was dying.</p>

    <p>When Ultimate King of Killers raised his head, a ghostly figure appeared in front of him, causing him to break into a cold sweat.</p>

    <p>"Still want to continue?" Lord Diulei said lightly.</p>

    <p>Ultimate King of Killers couldn't follow his movements at all; it was the same with that forehead flick just now.</p>

    <p>Ultimate King of Killers seriously wondered if he was blind.</p>

    <p>As King of Killers and number one in the Dark Network, it was impossible for him not to be able to use even a simple eye technique to capture motion.</p>

    <p>But reality proved that Lord Diulei's moves were indeed so fast that King of Killers's eyes just couldn't keep up.</p>

    <p>Ultimate King of Killers had to admit that of all the opponents he had ever encountered, this guy was the strangest!</p>

    <p>This Lord Diulei's aura had clearly been at the Soul Formation stage before this; that wasn't fake at all...</p>

    <p>But all of a sudden, it was like he had become another person.</p>

    <p>So, had he been deliberately hiding his strength previously?</p>

    <p>As King of Killers all these years, he had seen too many experts, and could practically tell at a glance whether they had deliberately hidden their strength. This could be considered an innate and special ability he had as Ultimate King of Killers, given his experience of the world: "know yourself and your enemy, and every victory will be yours."</p>

    <p>For the sake of his revenge today, he hadn't even hesitated to cooperate with Night Chief.</p>

    <p>Dealing with the Ten Generals one by one and humiliating them was the one thing he had been exceedingly confident he could do.</p>

    <p>He was Ultimate King of Killers.</p>

    <p>He would never follow through on a losing proposition, nor would he be unprepared.</p>

    <p>But he never expected this Chief of the Office of Strategic Deception, the man known as Great Death-Courting Senior, to be a hidden variable...</p>

    <p>"Still want to continue?" Lord Diulei asked again.</p>

    <p>"Interesting... truly interesting. It's been a long time since I've run into someone so interesting!" As King of Killers let out a wild laugh, he already had a countermeasure in mind. The first thing he needed to do now was restrict his opponent's movements. He felt that the reason for his defeat had a lot to do with his inability to see his opponent's movements clearly.</p>

    <p>Since the other party's strong point was his speed, then he didn't have to fight him head-on; he could just keep his distance, thus narrowing down the other party's attack options...</p>

    <p>This was standard combat mentality.</p>

    <p>Ultimate King of Killers had experienced countless battles. He was able to quickly adapt to different battle situations, and had experienced things that many people hadn't - this was also why Ultimate King of Killers was hard to catch.</p>

    <p>Ultimate King of Killers had once served in Magnificent Immortal, during which time he cultivated a formidable ability to evade detection.</p>

    <p>Actually, Ultimate King of Killers also had another nickname: Shame of Magnificent Immortal.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at Ultimate King of Killers, utterly serene. He still had plenty of time.</p>

    <p>Upon entering the arena and up to that forehead flick, it had only been thirty seconds.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Ultimate King of Killers was controlling the intrinsic spirit field as he tried to stay as far away as possible. Wang Ling could feel an added pressure on his shoulders all of a sudden.</p>

    <p>"Gravity restriction, huh..." Wang Ling raised his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>It was clear that Ultimate King of Killers was trying to restrict his movements.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, however, this gravity wasn't any use on Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Ultimate King of Killers had completely no idea about the kind of player he was facing.</p>

    <p>Putting some distance between them as he stood in the sky, he continued to cast extra effects on himself.</p>

    <p>"Boundless Sword Dao · Eight-Chi Sword Circle!"</p>

    <p>"Boundless Sword Dao · Increased Sword Strength!"</p>

    <p>"Boundless Sword Dao · Enhanced Sword Edge!"</p>

    <p>"Boundless Sword Dao · Sword Qi Damage Rebound!"</p>

    <p>"Boundless Sword Dao · Anti-Demon Stance!"</p>

    <p>"Boundless Sword Dao · Anti-Injury Sword Qi!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In a short ten seconds or so, Ultimate King of Killers borrowed General Yi's body to do whatever he wanted, casting more than ten extra augmentation effects on himself.</p>

    <p>This was power derived from Boundless Sword Dao. Looking at this, Wang Ling was a little apprehensive, not because he was afraid, but because the extra sword qi effects were like a dense cobweb wrapped around Ultimate King of Killers. Wang Ling, who had trypophobia, felt like he was going to go crazy at this sight!</p>

    <p>"You applied so many BUFFs, is this a last-ditch effort?"</p>

    <p>"I underestimated you before... But if you die from the next attack, don't blame me. I'm Ultimate King of Killers, I don't kill just nobodies," Ultimate King of Killers said darkly.</p>

    <p>He no longer held back. Originally, he had planned to slowly torture Battle Saint to death in this intrinsic spirit field, but he never expected this variable to show up.</p>

    <p>If this battle dragged out any longer, he would be at a disadvantage.</p>

    <p>The target of his revenge was the Ten Generals to begin with. As for the chief of the Office of Strategic Deception, he had simply promised Night Chief that he would get rid of him in passing. In other words, he initially could have given this Great Death-Courting Senior a quick death.</p>

    <p>But Ultimate King of Killers now vowed that if he won this battle, he would let this chief keep his pathetic life, then use everything he had learned in his life as a killer to torture the man for eighty-one days...</p>

    <p>"I'll torture you to death!"</p>

    <p>As before, King of Killers swung with all his strength, and the sword immediately expanded in the air to take the form of a sword pillar connected to the sky, which pressed forward with devastating force.</p>

    <p>This sword attack had overwhelming momentum.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, however, merely sighed.</p>

    <p>It was just a sigh, but it produced an extraordinary purifying sound wave which spread out in all directions from Lord Diulei's body like the cries of millions of birds; it was so shocking it could numb a person's scalp.</p>

    <p>In a split second, the attack turned into streams of air that dissipated into nothingness...</p>

    <p>Even the ten or so sword qi effects which encircled King of Killers's body vanished in a blink of an eye!</p>

    <p>"This is..."</p>

    <p>Both Battle Saint and King of Killers were dumbstruck.</p>

    <p>"It's just Kenbunshoku Haki <sup>1</sup> with an added unusual sound wave effect."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A form of Haki that allows the
user to sense the presence of
others, even if they are
concealed from view or too far
to see normally in "One
Piece .. ")</dfn>

    <p>Using Lord Diulei's body, Wang Ling replied, "I call it Unusual Sound Wave Kenbun Technique."</p>

    <p>Marshal Jiang: "..."</p>

    <p>King of Killers: "..."</p>

    <p>"You had your shot; it should be my turn now, shouldn't it?" In the next second, Wang Ling's gaze was fixed on King of Killers.</p>

    <p>At this look, Ultimate King of Killers was so scared that he broke into a cold sweat from head to toe, and even his underwear was soaked...</p>
