  <h1>Chapter 179 Lie Mengmeng, Someone Has Stolen Your White Bunny Slippers! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Of all the school military training exercises that had been held before, there had never been one like this.</p>

    <p>This time, Number 59 High School and Number 60 High School, these two schools that had long been tangled in a grudge match, were finally going to team up and fight on the same side. Currently not many people knew this information, and it was thanks to Tang Jingze and He Bufeng that Grade One, Class Three had learned of this "survival contest" in advance; everyone's expressions showed that they were looking forward to it.</p>

    <p>"What are the specific rules?" someone asked He Bufeng.</p>

    <p>"Mm, the survival contest this time is slightly different from the previous spirit sword exchange meet; the terrain will be much wider. Secondly, after entering the map, everyone will be bare-handed. The use of spirit swords and any magic treasure is forbidden. What we will have to do is collect the magic treasures randomly distributed on the map and then defeat the people from the other schools," He Bufeng explained. "Of course, the quality of the magic treasure you pick up all depends on your luck."</p>

    <p>At this point, Tang Jingze let out a sigh. "So this actual combat exercise, compared with the previous spirit sword exchange meet, is more a test of your ability to adapt to a situation. Of course, luck plays a factor. If someone finds a pair of immortal-grade shoes and can run all over the map, or if someone finds a top-grade immortal sword at the very beginning and initiates a large-scale massacre, even we might be helpless..."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>"Who are our opponents this time?" asked Su Xiao.</p>

    <p>"They're all from Peiyuan district. Jinyuan High School and Reliance Girls' High form one alliance while Jiancai High School and Shenye High School are an alliance," Tang Jingze said.</p>

    <p>Hearing the names of these high schools, Chen Chao's eyes suddenly dimmed. "Even Shenye High School is taking part... that's the key high school designated for children of the Xiao clan."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao shook his head. "I don't think this Shenye High School is anything important. I have an uncle who works there that told me that children of the Xiao clan in Shenye High School are from branch families. Jinyuan High School's overall strength is quite similar to ours, so instead, the crux will be Reliance Girls' High and Jiancai High School."</p>

    <p>Tang Jingze raised his eyebrows. "What do you mean?"</p>

    <p>"I have an uncle who works as a security guard at Reliance Girls' High, and an uncle who works as a phys ed teacher at Jiancai High School. They told me before about the situations there," Guo Hao said gravely. "This Reliance Girls' High has a high level of overall strength. Their principal is the head of the prefecture-level Reliance Sect, and is also nicknamed Principal Reliance. This principal is an expert at earth and wood techniques, and can easily adapt to any kind of terrain."</p>

    <p>"Then what about Jiancai High School?"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "That's Lin Xiaocong's school; it's a key high school which his father, Lin Sicong, has invested in. Quite a few of the Lin family's children study there. The most distinctive thing about them is that they're especially wealthy."</p>

    <p>This was a revelation to everyone who heard it. Not many people would have an impression of Jiancai High School. But when it came to Lin Xiaocong, there probably wasn't anyone who didn't know this famous rich second generation or his Fish-Slaying Sword, which was one of a kind.</p>

    <p>Most importantly, this Lin Xiaocong not only had a superior family background, he also worked especially hard... he had been ranked number one in the second mock spirit sword exam this year.</p>

    <p>This time, they would also be dealing with the rest of the children from the Lin family. It was easy to guess that for the sake of his family's performance in the military training, Lin Xiaocong would go all out in instructing them from behind... it could be said that the military training this time was going to be a challenge for both Number 59 High School and Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, both schools were on the candidate list to be upgraded to key city high schools, and this battle would be very important in ultimately determining whether they would be upgraded or not.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling wasn't very interested in the contest. Instead, when he heard that they wouldn't be able to use spirit swords in this actual combat exercise, he breathed a relieved sigh.</p>

    <p>There was no way he wanted Jingke to go ballistic again...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling got home after school in the evening, he saw that the pair of white bunny slippers at the door were gone.</p>

    <p>Had Lie Mengmeng come?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought it was strange that the slippers were gone as he hadn't sensed Lie Mengmeng's aura in the house.</p>

    <p>He looked up and saw a young man sitting on the sofa and chatting with Father Wang as they drank tea. When he entered, he even heard the young man give a wicked-sounding laugh. The moment he caught sight of him, his heart suddenly froze... because this person was actually Zhuo Yi!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling couldn't help roaring in his heart... Lie Mengmeng, someone has stolen your white bunny slippers!</p>

    <p>When Zhuo Yi saw Wang Ling, his eyes lit up, and before he could betray any more emotion, he turned so that his back was facing Father Wang.</p>

    <p>When Father Wang on the sofa saw that Wang Ling had returned home, he instantly introduced Zhuo Yi with great delight. "Ling Ling, let me introduce you. This is the biggest fan of my latest book. He's also your school senior and the youngest director of the General Administration of 100 Schools. He's also the person who personally recaptured that killer who escaped from Songhai First Prison recently!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Actually, Zhuo Yi had wanted to pay the Wang family a visit for a long time, but hadn't had the courage to do so.</p>

    <p>So this time when he had come to visit the Wang family, he had made sure to be amply prepared.</p>

    <p>Before his visit, he had asked Lord Diulei some questions including what his little shifu liked, what his personality was like, and how to get along well with him...</p>

    <p>Actually, when Zhuo Yi had asked these questions, Lord Diulei had thought that it was very strange. In his mind, Zhuo Yi was Wang Ling's eldest disciple. Why would this eldest disciple come running to ask questions about his own shifu?</p>

    <p>â€” This definitely must be because they had a turbulent relationship!</p>

    <p>Thus, with the intention of helping them make peace, Lord Diulei had told Zhuo Yi many things about Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi now knew that Wang Ling liked to keep a low profile, which was why he usually disliked putting himself forward publicly. Moreover, although Wang Ling appeared to be Zhuo Yi's school junior on the surface, the truth was that he was a deeply secretive big boss... and it wasn't just Wang Ling; the other people in the Wang family's small villa were also all great seniors who lay low in the cultivation circle!</p>

    <p>Now Wang Ling knew... he had been betrayed by Lord Diulei!</p>

    <p>He couldn't help wanting to sigh in his heart; he hadn't expected that there would actually be a traitor in his small circle of cultivation friends!</p>

    <p>Staring at Zhuo Yi, he was silent for a very long time and his brain hurt.</p>

    <p>Just as it felt like the air was about to turn heavy, Zhuo Yi suddenly spoke to Father Wang. "Brother Wang, this time I brought some gifts."</p>

    <p>"Just come if you're coming, you don't have to bring anything." Father Wang felt a little embarrassed.</p>

    <p>"What must be done should be done." Zhuo Yi took out his storage bag. He had prepared a top-grade cigar for Father Wang and a bottle of youth-retaining skin lotion for Mother Wang. And then, he took out a huge head of broccoli.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi felt quite proud as he held it in both hands. "I heard that Old Senior Wang especially liked broccoli, so I spent a huge amount of money to buy this from a great senior."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Finally, he rummaged through his storage bag and took out a box of crispy noodle snacks in a variety of flavors.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was slightly startled for a moment as he stared at this box of crispy noodle snacks.</p>

    <p>Hm, very well...</p>

    <p>He would accept this disciple!</p>
