  <h1>Chapter 992 Imposter Ling Zhenren</h1>

  <div>

    <p>There didn't seem to be anything wrong with these two faces, but they gave people an utter sense of wrongness. Wang Ling and Fang Xing suddenly showing up, Wang Ling's dead fish eyes turning into ones with double eyelids... even their personalities had changed drastically.</p>

    <p>How could the real Ling Zhenren be a chatterbox?</p>

    <p>As Wang Ling's friend for many years, Lord Diulei almost immediately noticed this abnormality.</p>

    <p>Was this double-eyelid, talkative Ling Zhenren another clone, like Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch?</p>

    <p>This was Lord Diulei's theory, but when his gaze turned to the "Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch" clone sitting on the side, the latter had a face full of hostility.</p>

    <p>Clones, for the most part, were connected telepathically.</p>

    <p>It was clear that Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch couldn't sense this talkative Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"These two aren't our people! They're enemies!" Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch immediately got up and released his aura to suppress them.</p>

    <p>But at that moment, Miss Bai Qiao on the side suddenly stood up and also released her aura. However, this pressure wasn't targeted at Wang Ling and Fang Xing, but the Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch clone.</p>

    <p>A high-level clone had its own autonomous will and thoughts, and could still act according to the original body's way of thinking even without the latter present. However, Bai Qiao was different: she was one part scabbard spirit and one part sword spirit.</p>

    <p>Thus, the moment Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch made a move, Bai Qiao's "protect master spirit blade" mode was instantly activated. This wasn't a conscious act on her part, but a subconscious reaction.</p>

    <p>Even Bai Qiao herself didn't react to her own move.</p>

    <p>"Stop, I can't control my body!" Bai Qiao yelled at Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch. Her ahoge was chock full of energy and glowed radiantly like a holy sword.</p>

    <p>"Damn it..."</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch's eyes darkened and he ultimately decided to give up. He glared at the two imposters belligerently.</p>

    <p>"Dao Monarch, what's going on?" Dharmaraja and Luo Chuang were dumbfounded and everyone seemed to be at a loss.</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao and Wang Ling's bond had deepened after Bai Qiao and Jingke fused together and transformed into Jingbai. The "protect master spirit blade" mode was without doubt the best proof of Wang Ling's identity. However, a clone Wang Ling had created himself was saying that these two people at the meeting were imposters...</p>

    <p>What the hell was going on?</p>

    <p>Were they replicas?</p>

    <p>This sort of technology did indeed exist in the cultivation world. The human replica magic treasure Head of State 001 was the best example of the cultivation replication technique.</p>

    <p>But anything that was replicated was ultimately a fake and was still different from the original body; they weren't magic treasures that could be forced to form a contract with the original bodies.</p>

    <p>So, what was with this current situation?</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei stood up and gazed at Wang Ling and Fang Xing. "Brother Ling, Brother Fang Xing, are you real?"</p>

    <p>"Hasn't Miss Bai Qiao confirmed our identities? Of course we're the real deal." Fang Xing tossed back her long hair; her female form was full of flirtatious expressions, which was usually very rarely seen.</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang and Dharmaraja were both secretly dazzled... They never expected Fang Xing to actually be so outrageous in her female form.</p>

    <p>"Given Miss Bai Qiao's reaction, both of you indeed don't seem to be imposters, and your auras are just as familiar." At that moment, Lord Diulei suddenly spoke.</p>

    <p>"Senior Immortal..." Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch was incredibly anxious. He was already certain that these two were imposters, but with Bai Qiao protecting her master, it was useless even if he wanted to act.</p>

    <p>"It's fine, Dao Monarch, I'll handle this." Lord Diulei waved his hand, and Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch could only hold himself back. After all, he was here to help the Office of Strategic Deception grow, and couldn't go over the boss's head.</p>

    <p>"Count yourself lucky!" Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch hmphed.</p>

    <p>He tried his best to compose himself as he stared hostilely at these two imposters in front of him.</p>

    <p>Thoughts flew threw Lord Diulei's mind; as the person with the highest realm at the moment, he had to make some decisions like a sect leader. His gaze sweeping over Wang Ling and Fang Xing these two suspected imposters, he finally took a deep breath and said, "Brother Ling, we're as close as brothers, and everyone knows your character very well. Why have you become so lively today? It's simply as if you're another person..."</p>

    <p>"People change. I know I don't talk much usually, but it's chapter 992 already! In two years, the author has only written 992 chapters... Because of this glacial update rate, I have less than twenty lines in the entire book. I'm tired as well!" Chatterbox Ling gave a deep sigh and was extremely bitter.</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Chatterbox Ling: "So after some reflection last night, I decided that I have to talk more in the future! As the protagonist of this book, how can I not speak? To change, I have to take it a step at a time; I know this may be hard for me, but I hope everyone will still support me as always!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei glanced at Fang Xing at the side. "Then, did Student Fang Xing also have plans of changing yourself after some reflection?"</p>

    <p>"That's right."</p>

    <p>Female Fang Xing nodded. "All of you know that I've admired Wang Ling for a very long time. I've decided that from now on, I'll stay in my female form and spend my life with him. We're getting married tomorrow!"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "???"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Why... why the rush?"</p>

    <p>Female Fang Xing: "Time waits for no man. Do I have to wait until I'm old and withered before I can get married?"</p>

    <p>Everyone was deeply struck by her words and couldn't regain their senses for a long while.</p>

    <p>"I understand."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei sighed again and looked at Wang Ling and Fang Xing. "Since the both of you have decided to change yourselves, we can only respect your decision. We'll start the meeting at once - does everyone want some light refreshments? We can eat while we talk."</p>

    <p>"Mm, that's a good suggestion." Wang Ling nodded.</p>

    <p>"Since Brother Ling has agreed, bring in the refreshments!" Lord Diulei clapped his hands.</p>

    <p>Some female disciples of the Office of Strategic Deception emerged from behind the screen in the conference room to serve the refreshments.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was startled at what he saw. "This is..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Crispy noodle snacks in various flavors. For Brother Ling's sake, I especially recruited chefs from the North Sea to fry fresh crispy noodle snacks every day and to use different dips so that you can have a different flavor each time you come! Brother Ling, don't you like it..."</p>

    <p>"No... I - I like it very much."</p>

    <p>"Then try it and see?"</p>

    <p>"Alright..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling broke off a chunk of crispy noodles, put it in his mouth, and chewed.</p>

    <p>A few seconds later...</p>

    <p>There was the sound of retching in the meeting.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei chuckled and stood up. "Everyone! These are imposters! Beat them up!" The real Brother Ling would never ever throw up crispy noodle snacks!!!</p>
