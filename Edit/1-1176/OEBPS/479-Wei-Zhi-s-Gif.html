  <h1>Chapter 479 Wei Zhi's Gift </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Er Ha's face was very composed and its eyes were a little indifferent when it looked at Marshal Jiang in front of it.</p>

    <p>It had to be said that Marshal Jiang's acting was in fact quite realistic. If Er Ha hadn't known that this Battle Saint's cultivation was superb and that he wouldn't deteriorate to the point of dementia, it would have almost believed him!</p>

    <p>"You can tell I'm teasing you?" Marshal Jiang was amused. He crouched down and rubbed Er Ha's head. On the alert, Er Ha dodged him, but then discovered it was as if there was some gravitational force in Marshal Jiang's palm which was involuntarily pulling its head toward his hand!</p>

    <p>Fuck! Absorbing Palm?</p>

    <p>Er Ha was alarmed as it knew that this old man was probably feeling it out again!</p>

    <p>But it couldn't avoid it at all; after all, this was one of the Ten Founding Generals, and more than that, this was the Battle Saint who had punched a demon god back then. Er Ha was completely unable to put up resistance in front of such a person. At this time, it felt some regret in its heart; if it had known that this would happen, it should have arranged to meet Wei Zhi elsewhere. It shouldn't have come here!</p>

    <p>Er Ha felt that this casually dressed old man was very dangerous!</p>

    <p>The moment he had drawn Er Ha's head to his palm, Marshal Jiang couldn't help sighing on the spot: this dog was already a class higher than the last time he had seen it.</p>

    <p>But how long ago was that?</p>

    <p>It hadn't even been a week...</p>

    <p>From third class to second class?</p>

    <p>When Marshal Jiang loosened his grip, he couldn't help rubbing Er Ha's ears as he communicated telepathically: "If it's possible, invite your owner to come here next time and we can have tea together. If he isn't free, then it's fine..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha abruptly raised its head, its expression slightly stunned.</p>

    <p>"Don't be nervous... I can more or less guess your identity, but I won't do anything to you."</p>

    <p>Marshal Jiang's eyes crinkled as he smiled and looked at Er Ha. "I don't know how many demon kings and demon gods have died by my hand... After that, whenever I stepped up to fight, those demon kings and demon gods would be so scared that they would break out in a cold sweat, and some would even collapse on the spot from fright. This is because my Battle Saint aura has already generated a type of natural deterrent to demon qi.</p>

    <p>"But there's no demon qi on you. This proves that you're already on the right path of using spirit energy. Your owner is indeed skilful if he can wash away your demon nature."</p>

    <p>"..." Er Ha was suddenly afraid to say anything.</p>

    <p>"Of course, I'm just curious..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "He's very busy."</p>

    <p>That was the truth! His little master was indeed very busy! Busy with midterm exams!</p>

    <p>Er Ha was well aware that given the level of the person in front of him, he would be able to tell if it was lying at a glance.</p>

    <p>Since it had already been exposed to this extent, Er Ha now decided to play it by ear as much as possible...</p>

    <p>Who knew Marshal Jiang didn't seem to care. He shrugged, then directly stood up. Seeing Marshal Jiang talking and laughing with a dog at the apartment entrance, the two security guards in the security booth couldn't help opening the window to greet him. "Uncle Jiang, you're back?"</p>

    <p>"Mm, I had coffee with Old Yi."</p>

    <p>"General Yi is also in Songhai city?" The security guards were stunned.</p>

    <p>"Heh! He's not like me, I'll retire when I say I'll retire. He's so free the whole day, so he was looking for something to do."</p>

    <p>On the side, Er Ha listened quietly. It knew that General Yi had probably come for Evil Sword God and wouldn't leave Songhai for a while yet.</p>

    <p>Er Ha watched the old man deftly fish out an access card from his pocket and hold it up to the sensor pad of the iron gate while he chatted with the security guards. The iron gate instantly let out a crisp "beep beep beep" sound and then opened with a click.</p>

    <p>Marshal Jiang entered first, then stretched out his hand to hold the iron gate open as he looked at Er Ha. "Don't just stand there, come in!"</p>

    <p>When the two security guards saw this scene, they couldn't help trembling and their foreheads instantly beaded with sweat... Marshal Jiang himself was holding the gate open - this dog was so awesome!</p>

    <p>"Uncle Jiang... do you know this dog?" one of the guards wiped at his sweat and asked weakly.</p>

    <p>"It's Wei Zhi's friend, it's looking for Wei Zhi," Marshal Jiang said.</p>

    <p>The two guards understood immediately.</p>

    <p>"It... doesn't come here often, right?"</p>

    <p>"Hard to say, friends dropping by to visit each other is normal." Marshal Jiang looked at Er Ha, then pointed at it as he fixed his eyes on the two guards. "Remember it, and let the other brothers know later - only this dog is allowed to enter our family apartment from now on."</p>

    <p>Er Ha's eyes followed the direction Marshal Jiang was pointing in and felt overwhelmed.</p>

    <p>"Ah?"</p>

    <p>The two guards were taken aback â€” they were shocked! The first time Battle Saint Jiang Lei was using this privilege was actually for a green-furred dog!</p>

    <p>Marshal Jiang glanced at the two men and said, "What damn 'ah'! If anyone else forgets their access card, keep them locked outside as per regulations, and then either wait for me to open the gate or have their acquaintance come down and help them do it. Am I clear?"</p>

    <p>"Ye... yes..." Er Ha saw that the two guards were already completely stupefied at this point.</p>

    <p>While this manner of speaking sounded a little like a command, Er Ha thought that it carried even more of the flavor of life and really looked like a neighborhood committee old man casually saying hello. After that, Marshal Jiang didn't hang around any longer, and was about to turn around and head for the apartment's residential committee office.</p>

    <p>Before leaving, Marshal Jiang thought carefully for a bit and couldn't help turning his head to stress something to the two security guards.</p>

    <p>He made it clear that he wasn't pulling any strings, and that this was in response to the recent national crackdown on illegal spirit beast trade as well as calls for animal protection.</p>

    <p>...What damn animal protection...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi showed up soon after Marshal Jiang left.</p>

    <p>"Brother Dog!" As soon as Wei Zhi got to the ground floor, he saw that green figure next to the security room and waved from a distance as he called out a greeting.</p>

    <p>The Pushing Large Butterfly had also come with Wei Zhi to pick up Er Ha. It couldn't talk and remained unmoving on Wei Zhi's shoulder. Only when it saw Er Ha did it flutter its wings in greeting.</p>

    <p>Er Ha ran over, and when it reached Wei Zhi, he pulled it aside.</p>

    <p>It noticed that Wei Zhi was smiling like an open lotus flower. "Brother Dog, you're awesome! Uncle Jiang personally gave you privilege! If anyone else found out, I don't know about outside the apartment, but inside here, you can really boast about it for a lifetime."</p>

    <p>Er Ha thought it was a little strange. "How do you know about that?"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "Uncle Jiang told me. He knew I was coming down and told me telepathically. In the apartment, any time Uncle Jiang wants to get hold of someone, he basically doesn't use the phone, and just directly contacts them telepathically."</p>

    <p>Er Ha broke into a sweat; there were times when a high realm was indeed really convenient...</p>

    <p>"Let's go up first!"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi pressed the elevator button and looked at Er Ha. "Since before, I've already been thinking about giving you a gift. I happened to get my hands on something which I think you will like very much!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha was dazed when he heard this.</p>

    <p>Wanted to give it a gift?</p>

    <p>What kind of gift?</p>

    <p>Flies?</p>

    <p>But the problem was that even if Marshal Jiang had seen through its identity, Wei Zhi still hadn't...</p>
