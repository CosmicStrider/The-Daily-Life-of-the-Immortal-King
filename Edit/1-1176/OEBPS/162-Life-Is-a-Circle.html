  <h1>Chapter 162 Life Is a Circle </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't actually think that he was a stingy person â€” spend money when you should spend it, and don't waste a single penny when you shouldn't. This was the economic view of consumption which Father and Mother Wang had imparted to him. A haircut was just a trivial thing. In contrast, Wang Ling preferred to spend the money saved on the haircut on crispy noodle snacks.</p>

    <p>He had heard that Small Raccoon had recently launched a new flavor: indigowoad root and wasabi. Wang Ling planned to buy a packet to try. If he could save money on this haircut, he could buy more packets!</p>

    <p>In the hairdresser's, after some silence, a disbelieving expression appeared on the face of the apprentice fellow whom Wang Ling had pointed out, and he bowed solemnly. "Thank you for your trust! I will definitely give it my best!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded indifferently, then found a place to sit.</p>

    <p>The people around them gave him strange looks... because this apprentice hairdresser was a very scary existence that was no less terrifying than a new hospital intern nurse; the only difference was that one person stuck a needle in you, while the other worked on your scalp.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was probably the only person who had the guts to let this apprentice cut his hair...</p>

    <p>This was likely the first time that this apprentice fellow was cutting a customer's hair. His fingers clenched around an electric razor, and there were a few drops of cold sweat on his temple; he was clearly nervous, like an inexperienced little sister about to lose her virginity. "I... I'm going to start."</p>

    <p>It was just a buzz cut; he only needed to cleanly shave the hair on the sides and the back... it wasn't that difficult!</p>

    <p>The apprentice fellow comforted himself. But when the electric razor touched Wang Ling's scalp, his hand shook!</p>

    <p>In a flash, he shaved the back of Wang Ling's head completely bald...</p>

    <p>Fellow: "..."</p>

    <p>Boss: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling touched the bald patch and shook his head. Then, the hair in that area grew at a rapid rate visible to the naked eye, quickly going from Jason Wu <sup>1</sup> to a Saiyan <sup>2</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Jason Wu is a Taiwanese-born
fashion designer who tends to
spot a very short buzz cut.)</dfn>
    
    <br/>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(The Saiyan race in the
'Dragonball' series have long,
thick hair ..)</dfn>

    <p>The boss and all his little fellows were stunned. "..." Fuck! There was this type of operation?</p>

    <p>After an hour or so, Wang Ling walked smoothly out of the hairdresser's.</p>

    <p>The boss quickly pulled him to a stop: "Perfected One, don't go!"</p>

    <p>Then, the boss took out two hundred yuan from his pants pocket and thrust it into Wang Ling's hand.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "???"</p>

    <p>The boss pointed to the hair all over the floor behind him and looked gratefully at Wang Ling. "This is my thanks for the hair that Perfected One has supplied my shop with... an Immortal's hair is just too good; we can turn it into high-quality wigs! This two hundred is the market price for hair. Perfected One, please come again whenever you're free!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling went home after getting his haircut, his pocket full of half-priced crispy noodle snacks from the market; he had made a cool two hundred yuan just for his hair, so he had been able to stock up on more crispy noodle snacks.</p>

    <p>When he got home, he found that there were a lot of people in the house today.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei and Song Qingshu were waiting in the living room; the old man had politely given each of them a bowl of sweet mung bean soup. He was prone to making sweet mung bean soup in summer to cool the body down. Old Man Wang's sweet mung bean soup had been a top-class restaurant dish in his youth. He had only made a limited amount each day, and it had been very difficult for customers to get a bowl.</p>

    <p>But unfortunately, these two guys didn't know to cherish or be grateful for it. They stared at their bowls of sweet mung bean soup and began to wonder about the meaning behind the mung beans; during this time, they even clearly determined the number of mung beans that were in the bowl.</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu actually had never had this defective habit before, but after following Lord Diulei around for the last few days, he had been led astray...</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling!" Seeing Wang Ling, Lord Diulei politely saluted with clasped fists, while Song Qingshu next to him also stood up to salute him solemnly and address him as Ling Zhenren.</p>

    <p>The old man didn't care about Wang Ling's matters; he still wanted to watch his TV series! Seeing that Wang Ling had come, he hurriedly waved his hand and said to the two people, "Well... there's still some sweet mung bean soup in the pot if this isn't enough for you, go ahead and have a chat together."</p>

    <p>"Okay, thank you, Great Senior!" Lord Diulei nodded solemnly.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he was thinking to himself: I must bring this sweet mung bean soup home later and carefully study the mystery in it! If I drink it, I might have hope of reaching the Void Refinement stage!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei sat on the sofa and looked at Wang Ling as he spoke. "Brother Ling, I've come to see you because I have some good news! Thanks to Little Song this time, I know the whereabouts of the maker of the stone ghost mask!"</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu added, "I just provided a bit of a lead. Based on that, it was Senior Lord Diulei and that Senior Black who locked onto the maker's location."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Wang Ling nodded. Song Qingshu had made good on his promise and hadn't broken it. Finding the maker of the mask meant that very soon, this matter with the stone ghost mask would come to an end. As for Mo Immortal Castle's intent to use it in a dark ascension to power, this plot would be completely foiled.</p>

    <p>Of course, this was the ideal scenario.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was actually very curious about the identity of the mask's maker.</p>

    <p>"According to the coordinates which Little Black sent, the maker is actually not far from here." Lord Diulei opened the message from Little Black, which clearly indicated that it was a total distance of eight hundred kilometers away.</p>

    <p>An ordinary cultivator would be able to reach it in twenty minutes on a flying sword.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling cupped his chin as he looked at the coordinates sent by Little Black, then slowly frowned. The more he looked at it, the more familiar it seemed...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei solemnly vowed, "Brother Ling, rest assured, Little Black verified this was the place after checking it several times. Combined with my Great Tracking Power, there is absolutely no mistake!"</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling had a bad premonition for some reason, and his eyelid began to twitch once again.</p>

    <p>Disaster level, one star. Who knew what on earth was going to happen...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had Lord Diulei and Song Qingshu put their hands on his shoulders, then with a " poof ," the three of them teleported to the coordinates.</p>

    <p>And then, an old-school restaurant that looked like it was on the verge of collapsing appeared before them.</p>

    <p>Looking at the huge words "Midnight Dining Hall" inscribed on the horizontal board hanging on the restaurant door, Wang Ling sunk into deep thought. Damn! Why was it this place?!</p>

    <p>Did the boss use to be a smith? From a smith to a cook... Wang Ling thought that this was even more outlandish than a transdimensional singer!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei, who saw the twitch in Wang Ling's eternally poker-faced expression, couldn't help being curious. "Brother Ling, it seems like you've been here before?"</p>

    <p>Before the three people entered the shop, they could already hear the melodious singing inside: That is the girl I deeply love and miss day and night...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling couldn't help sighing in his heart; it turned out that life was a damn circle!</p>
