  <h1>Chapter 689 Poor Student Wang Ling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Director Shi was dumbstruck. How could there be a parent like this in the world...</p>

    <p>Disbelievingly, she looked at the phone number in the address book of parents' contacts and confirmed that she hadn't called the wrong number. But she felt like she had just called a fake dad! The word in school all this time was that Wang Ling's family situation was very tough and he had a cold personality. Now that Director Shi thought about it, she felt that this was inevitably tied to his upbringing.</p>

    <p>Student Wang Ling's family situation was a little wretched!</p>

    <p>At that moment, director of education Director Shi's maternal instincts overflowed. She suddenly felt that she hadn't cared for Student Wang Ling enough. Since he was in the elite class, his academic grades definitely weren't bad... but they also had to pay attention to the psychological aspect. Number 60 High's education style advocated two points: the education of their students and teaching!</p>

    <p>And educating the students was still far more important than teaching!</p>

    <p>It wasn't right for teachers to blindly chase grades; the students' psychological education was equally important. Headmaster Chen had stressed this point many times at staff meetings.</p>

    <p>Now that Director Shi was on the phone, her mind was full of regrets. She didn't know whether Wang Ling was still alive or not. Either way, Director Shi and the other Number 60 High teachers at that moment all shared the same somber mood.</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, not long after the old secretary's phone call of commendation, the office of the General Administration of 100 Schools received the grievous news about Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This time, it was Headmaster Chen himself who called Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Since something had happened to a student, Headmaster Chen was accountable in his position as headmaster.</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen sounded very sorrowful on the phone, but Zhuo Yi still didn't know which student had been taken. "Student Zhuo Yi..." This was Headmaster Chen's familiar address for this old graduate.</p>

    <p>"I understand the situation, headmaster..." Zhuo Yi's voice was also very gloomy.</p>

    <p>After the collective deaths of the team of overseas returnee elites from the Demon Hunters Association, no one expected President Bai to strike yet again, and furthermore kidnap a student.</p>

    <p>"I am already prepared to resign."</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen sighed deeply. "If this lapse in my judgment leads to this student's unfortunate end, I'll feel guilty for the rest of my life..."</p>

    <p>"Headmaster..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was moved. "Calm down first, headmaster. Why don't we think of some possible solutions? Perhaps that student is still alright..."</p>

    <p>"That student is only at the Foundation Establishment stage, there's no way his body would have been able to withstand being drawn directly into a space fissure!" Headmaster Chen was very agitated.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "May I ask exactly who this student is, Headmaster Chen?"</p>

    <p>"You've seen him before."</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen replied, "It's that Student Wang Ling from Grade One, Class Three."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi exclaimed loudly in his heart: Crap! Shifu's been caught by a monster!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Half an hour before the incident, Wang Ling had already sensed an abnormality at the school gate. It just so happened that school was over. Grade One classes were the earliest to end. Usually, the students would linger in class after school to discuss homework before leaving.</p>

    <p>With his King's Eye, Wang Ling had seen a deeply hidden space trap. As long as students walked out of the gate, they would be sucked into the space.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, this bull-headed person still came...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p>In this world, there would always be some people who wouldn't listen. Wang Ling felt that he had already been very benevolent.</p>

    <p>When he was sucked into the space, Wang Ling was expressionless. The tear in space didn't have any impact on his body. Also, the instant he was sucked into the space, Wang Ling had already cast a spell to get rid of the space trap and directly plug the crack so that he was the only person to be swallowed up.</p>

    <p>After he landed, Wang Ling surveyed his surroundings carefully.</p>

    <p>This was a completely independent and unusual space. Wang Ling's first assumption was that this was probably the inside of a magic artifact.</p>

    <p>The entire space was a snow-white world that seemed endless.</p>

    <p>President Bai had used a technique to combine the magic artifact with his own body to partition off this space.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling dusted off his school uniform. This was space debris from when he fell through the space fissure. When the space fissure formed, it sucked in drifting matter from other spaces, and this matter ultimately broke down into incredibly dirty debris and fine particles.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was a bit annoyed because this stuff was hard to wash off... Who knew if enchanted detergent would be able to wash clean his dirty school uniform.</p>

    <p>While Wang Ling was pondering this, there was a slight distortion in the air in front of him, and a young man with a deathly white face and carrying a black umbrella stepped out of the distortion.</p>

    <p>This person was none other than President Bai.</p>

    <p>President Bai's aura was already different from what Wang Ling had felt before.</p>

    <p>"We should resolve our grievances today." President Bai let go of the small black umbrella, which then hovered behind him, and his whole face was revealed.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Ling saw a dark black dot between President Bai's eyebrows.</p>

    <p>This was the mark of a soul exchange.</p>

    <p>As the Heavenly Dao had said, there was a balance to all things in the world, and the principle of equivalence exchange was an eternal and inviolable rule. To boost his power, President Bai could only rely on this "shortcut" of selling his soul and sacrificing his lifespan to make himself stronger.</p>

    <p>President Bai stared at Wang Ling, full of confidence in his increased strength. "I've already thoroughly investigated your strength; you're a True Immortal, aren't you?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Your Excellency has repeatedly thwarted my Demon Hunters Association's plans, I won't let you off so easily." President Bai's tone was grim. His eyes were fixed unwaveringly on Wang Ling as he gnashed his teeth in rage. "In order to deal with Your Excellency, I gave up a thousand years of my life without exception in exchange for this chance to boost my strength..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling cocked an eyebrow. He had indeed heard Mr Lu mention before that President Bai had a very powerful recovery ability to begin with, and that his self-healing ability was more terrifying than Elder Yaren's. It was an instant kind of self-healing, where he might already recover even while still being attacked.</p>

    <p>Now that President Bai's whole body had been enhanced, Wang Ling felt that the other party's self-healing ability was probably stronger than before.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling remembered that he had used one slap to deal with the Old Devil.</p>

    <p>And two slaps to deal with Evil Sword God...</p>

    <p>Here, now, was the question...</p>

    <p>How many times would he have to slap this President Bai to deal with him?</p>

    <p>For now, Wang Ling wasn't sure, and only felt a little twitchy.</p>

    <p>It was almost time for the final exams, and he still had a lot of homework to do when he went home as he hadn't finished it yet!</p>

    <p>So troublesome!</p>
