  <h1>Chapter 122 I Don't Want Such A Plot Twist! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>In front of the old Taoist in white, Wang Ling took five seconds to calm his thoughts and then struggled to determine something.</p>

    <p>This Third Saint had mistaken him for someone else...</p>

    <p>This Teacher Killer with the Taoist name Killer Taoist was an eccentric person who was number one on the international ranking list of killers.</p>

    <p>This wasn't the first time that Wang Ling had heard of him; the most recent was when that Shadow Stream 36D maiden had attempted to strike at Number 59 High School.</p>

    <p>Looking at the old Taoist in white in front of him who seemed to have forgotten all of his enmity, Wang Ling was a little speechless.</p>

    <p>Who the hell could have known that his blinking would be mistaken for Killer Taoist's unique skill?</p>

    <p>Furthermore, after the old Taoist had assumed that he was Killer Taoist, what the heck was with his shy expression, as if he was some innocent little sister?! Fuck! Don't tell him this guy was actually gay?! He didn't want this plot twist!</p>

    <p>Seeing that Wang Ling hadn't said anything, Third Saint took it in his heart as silent agreement. He was as excited as an elementary school student about to go on a spring excursion, and his smile was like a brilliant chrysanthemum. "Senior Killer Taoist! It really is you!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"I've long heard about your godly art of killing people with a wink; this time, I'm much obliged to you for being able to witness it for myself!" The old Taoist in white sighed, ashamed of his inferior skills.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at the old Taoist's bleeding arm, which had been injured by the aftershock. With this recent excitement, the wound was now like a fountain gushing blood. This amount of blood... the old Taoist was lucky he was at the Soul Formation stage, since anyone else would have already died!</p>

    <p>"Senior, are you worried about my injury? It's fine, this is nothing, this is the result of my inferior skills..."</p>

    <p>As he stared at the old Taoist in white, Wang Ling desperately wanted to say, "You're freaking overthinking it"...</p>

    <p>The old Taoist took out some medicinal powder which he had on him and sprinkled it on the wound. The bleeding quickly stopped, but the pain from his broken arm and the excitement of believing that Wang Ling was Killer Taoist had caused his face to go red and then white, like the face of a <em>Hua Dan </em><sup>1 </sup>, which looked very strange.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A Hua Dan (花旦, "flowery
role") is the role of a lively,
vivacious woman in Chinese
opera.)</dfn>

    <p>"We were following orders this time, but if we had known that Senior Killer Taoist was here, we definitely wouldn't have made a move! Cruelty has always been the foundation of our belief as the Ten Saints, and only the ones more brutal than us are worthy for us to learn from! Back when Senior Killer Taoist reigned at the top of the cultivation world, we were still just hungry young saplings!" As the old Taoist spoke, the corners of his eyes glinted; he was so choked with emotion that he actually couldn't help tearing up.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>The tears were genuine, and so was the emotion. Wang Ling knew that the old Taoist had spoken from his heart. If it had been even the least bit fake, Wang Ling's Mind-Reading Ability would have instantly picked up on it.</p>

    <p>In the face of an enemy who had no killing intent whatsoever and had also lost the ability to fight, who was just running off at the mouth emotionally, Wang Ling knew that he couldn't really make a move...</p>

    <p>The most bizarre thing to him was that until now, he hadn't given any sort of definite reaction to this plot development! This was all wishful thinking on the old Taoist's part!</p>

    <p>It was very obvious that the old Taoist in white had already completely fallen into his boundless imagination and was utterly unable to escape from it. "...Elder brother and second brother's deaths were unjust! If they had known that Senior Killer Taoist was here, I don't think they would have made a move!"</p>

    <p>Hearing the words of the old Taoist in white, Wang Ling frowned. Frankly speaking, this was quite the headache for him now.</p>

    <p>Maybe he should have just killed this whole bunch of people at the very beginning and pass the blame on to Lord Diulei that guy, so that there wouldn't be so many of these ridiculous misunderstandings...</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling really rarely killed people unless they were truly a threat. This was also the teaching which Father and Mother Wang had imparted to him since his childhood.</p>

    <p>The immense power he had been born with was for self-preservation, not for recklessly trampling on lives... otherwise, what was the difference between him and those protagonists in novels who indiscriminately killed people as if they were flies for a bit of fun?!</p>

    <p>If he killed Third Saint, there would still be Fourth Saint and Fifth Saint — one after another, they would come to find trouble with him. Wang Ling frowned; there definitely had to be a better way of resolving this than just simply brutal killing.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Third Saint spoke up again. "Senior, are you still worried about the stone ghost mask?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised his head and looked seriously at the old Taoist in white. He wanted to hear what he thought.</p>

    <p>The old Taoist in white smiled. "Senior, don't worry, we won't fight for the stone ghost mask anymore. When I return this time, I will explain it clearly to them; even if it means disobeying the Lord of the Castle's orders, we will no longer participate in this operation to obtain the stone ghost mask."</p>

    <p>It was a very sincere remark, and Wang Ling couldn't detect any flaws in it, so he nodded in satisfaction.</p>

    <p>Seeing him nod, Third Saint knew that he wasn't angry, and he heaved a sigh of relief. "After the end of this matter, I will choose to retire and will no longer participate in any sort of conflict. Consider this my self-punishment for offending you, senior."</p>

    <p>With that, he gripped his broken arm and bowed to Wang Ling. "This time, we have really caused you offense! Please forgive us, senior!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..." Two of the other party's top generals had died as a result of the backlash he had caused, yet he was being apologized to instead; at this point, he already didn't know what to say.</p>

    <p>His current mood was quite complicated...</p>

    <p>Third Saint: "Then I won't bother you anymore, senior... but before I take my leave, can you grant me a small request?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked doubtful. "?"</p>

    <p>A spirit light flashed in the old Taoist's left hand and a marker pen instantly appeared. He then handed it to Wang Ling, immediately turned around and pointed to his back. "Senior, please be sure to sign your name here!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought for a moment, and in the end still took off the pen cap and wrote: <em>Devotion to the nation </em><sup>2 </sup>.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(The mother of the famous
patriotic general Yue Fei in
the Song dynasty once wrote
these four characters on his
back ..)</dfn>

    <p><em>Signed by Killer Taoist, as a gift...</em></p>

    <p>The curtain dropped on this chaotic scene, Wang Ling called his clone back, and Lord Diulei returned home after attending the parent-teacher conference in place of Father and Mother Wang.</p>

    <p>The head of security at the gate had already regained consciousness and the saliva froth at the corners of his mouth had already dried up; when he saw that Lord Diulei had returned, he immediately grabbed his sleeve and said a little deliriously, "Senior Immortal! Senior Immortal, be careful! Lei Feng said he was going to tear your house down!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>When he got home and found the fighting lion wrapped head to toe in "special effects," he couldn't help feeling shocked.</p>

    <p>What had happened in the last two hours?!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei checked the cinnabar inventory in his villa, and instantly wanted to cry, but had no tears left to shed — Wang Ling had actually used all of it up! There wasn't even residue left! Lord Diulei had blended cinnabar and black dust powder together, and based on the current market value of the latter... Wang Ling's talismans had cost him more than a million yuan in one go!</p>

    <p>This was something the other person had absolutely taken wicked delight in doing...</p>

    <p>He decided that the next time Wang Ling visited, he would squirrel all the cinnabar away beforehand to prevent this reckless spender from using it all up!</p>
