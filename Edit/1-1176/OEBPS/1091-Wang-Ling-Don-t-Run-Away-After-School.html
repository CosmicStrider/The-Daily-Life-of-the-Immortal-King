  <h1>Chapter 1091 Wang Ling! Don't Run Away After School!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The unexpected love confession caught Wang Ling off guard and he spurted out a mouthful of watermelon juice. At that moment, that poker face which had never been ruffled before finally cracked to reveal an extremely dismayed expression.</p>

    <p>But the change in expression was too quick for a lot of people to notice.</p>

    <p>Everyone was speechless at this dramatic plot twist...</p>

    <p>Xia Ming was stupefied, and so were his fans in the corridor. They didn't understand how this astonishing reversal had happened - Classmate Sun Rong actually liked Wang Ling?</p>

    <p>A lot of people didn't expect this outcome today, but it did make sense - after all, as early as the start of Senior Grade One at Number 60 High, Wang Ling and Classmate Sun Rong had gone on a date at the Xiao Family Compound, and although they had been the target of an assassination attempt by Shadow Stream, they had managed to avoid disaster.</p>

    <p>After that, their relationship hadn't developed further; of course, the reason could be that the author himself couldn't be bothered to write about it... In short, if something like this happened again, no one would be surprised.</p>

    <p>Because there was precedent.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling grabbed a tissue to wipe the watermelon juice at the corner of his mouth. There were too many people watching and talking right now; it was somewhat unrealistic to think that he could directly use magic to erase their memories, since surveillance had been set up in the classrooms and corridors - traces of the spell would definitely be recorded.</p>

    <p>When all was said and done, Wang Ling still felt that it was his responsibility— he hadn't been careful enough when designing Single's Curse: what a person said would be completely opposite to what they felt, but conversely, this could be used by someone to confess to him.</p>

    <p>At that moment, the entire scene sank into dead silence after Sun Rong's resounding confession. A number of busybodies then started to clap to a beat on the side.</p>

    <p>"Together..."</p>

    <p>"Together!"</p>

    <p>"Together!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>As a low-key person, Wang Ling never expected to be pushed into the limelight yet again.</p>

    <p>Onlookers were forever fond of blowing things out of proportion in order to enjoy a good show. Even if Xia Ming had a lot of supporters in the crowd at first, they just changed and went with the flow as they started to wish this couple well.</p>

    <p>"That's enough!" In the tumult, Xia Ming, who had been standing tall and dignified on the dais, finally exploded with a loud howl at that moment.</p>

    <p>He trembled slightly, and his mood was a complicated mess. His nerves, which had been stretched taut the whole day, finally snapped at that moment after this dramatic rollercoaster of a plot twist.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling!"</p>

    <p>Xia Ming glared at Wang Ling, his body shaking with anger. "Let's duel! If you have the guts, don't run away after school!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>And so, that day, a fight between the two men officially unfolded. The matter spread in such a rowdy manner that even the teachers heard about it. Apart from some inflexible teachers like Teacher Pan, most of them looked the other way when it came to the students' relationships. As long as they didn't cross the line, it was very normal for boys and girls to have good feelings for each other.</p>

    <p>Who hadn't been young once?</p>

    <p>Some teachers were discussing it in the office; if it was any other student, they wouldn't just sit by and watch. However, Sun Rong's presence complicated the situation a little.</p>

    <p>"Student Sun Rong has always been reserved; why was she so frank and straightforward this time?"</p>

    <p>"She met the person she truly likes; that's youth." Lao Gudong laughed. "But I didn't expect Xia Ming that kid to actually have the courage this time to declare war on our class's Wang Ling. That kid has always been very timid; it looks like Student Sun's confession to someone else was a heavy blow to him."</p>

    <p>"Then... What is Student Wang Ling's attitude?" the female teacher asked, eager for gossip.</p>

    <p>What other kind of attitude could Wang Ling have? Naturally, he was as dead-looking as ever.</p>

    <p>Teachers familiar with Wang Ling actually knew what kind of person he was — this was a very "average" child, whose grades were always right down the middle. He didn't improve, nor did he slide backward; he was typically reticent, and didn't say more than ten words a day.</p>

    <p>But a high-profile young lady like Student Sun Rong actually liked this sort of stoppered gourd.</p>

    <p>When the teachers thought it over, they suddenly felt that underlying this was actually the Yin and Yang principle of things turning the other way once it hit a peak.</p>

    <p>"Nothing will happen with Wang Ling." When the discussion was in full swing inside the office, Teacher Pan pushed up her gold-rimmed glasses and suddenly said those words.</p>

    <p>There were perhaps very few boys who could resist Student Sun Rong's sugar-coated bullets, but Teacher Pan knew Wang Ling very well.</p>

    <p>It was by no means an easy thing to truly sway Wang Ling's heart.</p>

    <p>"What should we do? Step in and stop the fight after school?" Lao Gudong asked shrewdly as he drank his coffee.</p>

    <p>"They won't fight," Teacher Pan said with certainty. "If they do wrong, just punish them according to school regulations."</p>

    <p>All the teachers in the office were silent as they looked at Teacher Pan's serious expression, and they didn't say anything else. Only when Teacher Pan left with a stack of test papers in her arms a few minutes later did the office turn lively once more.</p>

    <p>"Teacher Wang!" A female teacher rushed over to Lao Gudong.</p>

    <p>"???"</p>

    <p>"What snacks do you have to sell?"</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong opened his drawer. "Anything you want."</p>

    <p>"I want to buy a bag of popcorn! I want to go watch the duel!" said the female teacher.</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong: "..."</p>

    <p>It didn't matter if it was just one person, but the whole office was instantly fired up. "I want two bags! And two hundred on Xia Ming while I'm at it! Xia Ming has to win!"</p>

    <p>"I bet on Xia Ming too! Xia Ming gets good grades in all his subjects, and his score in body techniques is excellent! I bet one thousand!"</p>

    <p>"Are all of you betting on Xia Ming?" Lao Gudong found it unbelievable.</p>

    <p>In just a few minutes, the odds were already almost 1:100 in Xia Ming's favor...</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong silently took out fifty yuan in small change from his pocket and stirred the pot. "All of you are betting on Xia Ming? Then, I'll support my class's Wang Ling."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Like Teacher Pan said, Wang Ling had always loathed being in the limelight. If it was just Sun Rong's confession, he could actually still think of a way to deal with it. However, he hadn't expected things to develop to the extent of a duel...</p>

    <p>And now, the entire school knew that he and Xia Ming were fighting for love.</p>

    <p>Accepting the challenge would only strengthen Sun Rong's feelings for him.</p>

    <p>Not accepting the challenge would earn him the scorn and disdain of all the boys in school.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling found it hard to decide in this situation, since he would still be pushed into the limelight, whether he fought or not.</p>

    <p>Thus, compared with being disdained by the whole school, Wang Ling still decided to accept the challenge.</p>

    <p>But it was really tiring to fight a fake match...</p>

    <p>For Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>Xia Ming was just too weak, and wouldn't be able to take a single blow at all...</p>
