  <h1>Chapter 773 President Bai's Patron</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"This Heavenly Dao Treasure Box is made from a special material. I've already tried breaking it many times, but it's never the least bit damaged; it can't be destroyed at all." Devil King shook his head.</p>

    <p>As Devil King had said, the Heavenly Dao Treasure Box contained a secret that could revive the extinct holy beast race.</p> 
    
    <p>This was enough to prove that the thing hidden inside the Heavenly Dao Treasure Box had the power to change fate.</p>

    <p>To open the box, Devil King had been persistently searching for the password, and based on what he knew about Heavenly Dao, he had been looking for clues in this assigned game.</p>

    <p>Opening the box naturally wasn't going to be that easy.</p>

    <p>"You can put in the password over and over again, but I don't know how long it is. I've tried hundreds of thousands of combinations over a thousand years ... None of them worked." Devil King sighed, his face a little despairing.</p>

    <p>"Have you tried GCM?" Wang Ming said.</p>

    <p>Devil King quickly searched his memory and then replied, "I tried this combination on the 14,522,356th time. Didn't work."</p>

    <p>Everyone: " ... "</p>

    <p>It was over. Even this wasn't the password ... It looked like breaking open the Heavenly Dao Treasure Box was a lot more complicated than they had imagined</p>

    <p>"Is it a mix of numbers and English?" Wang Ming asked.</p>

    <p>"I don't know for sure; it's also possible that it might be Eastern or Western cultivation runes," Devil King said. "But after exploring this game world all these years, I'm fairly certain the password is a mix of English, numbers, and Eastern cultivation runes, even if I haven't been able to completely decipher the clues."</p>

    <p>"Then when will we be able to crack it?" There was already some despair on Xiao Yin's face.</p>

    <p>He thought of the tale of Fengxian prefecture in the story "Journey to The West." Because the marquis of the prefecture offended the Jade Emperor, the entire prefecture was punished with a drought. It wouldn't rain until the chicken ate up all the rice, the dogs licked up all the flour, and the candles melted all the golden locks ... In a sense, the Jade Emperor in the story deliberately made it difficult for the marquis; this tricky problem presented by the person who had given Devil King this box was no different.</p>

    <p>If it was just a combination of numbers and English, Devil King might have been able to decipher the password earlier on.</p>

    <p>However, cultivation runes were actually mixed into it. Trying to solve this puzzle using his current train of thought would probably take him another ten thousand years.</p>

    <p>"Can Your Majesty Beast King specifically describe what the person who gave you the Heavenly Dao Treasure Box looked like?" Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>Devil King recalled carefully, "The senior wrapped himself up very tightly and came well prepared. He wore a Daoist robe made from a material I had never seen before. My Devil Valley contains all the resources in the world, but I actually didn't recognize the material at all ... "</p>

    <p>When Devil King said this, Zhuo Yi and Xiao Yin instantly thought of the girl in ancient attire whom Wang Ling had rescued from the belly of a kun. She was now still in a deep coma, and was being treated at Immortal Toya's place.</p>

    <p>The Daoist robe she wore was made of a material that they had never seen before, and looked like quite an old style ...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi and Xiao Yin both wondered whether there was a connection between the two.</p>

    <p>"Does he have any distinguishing features?" Wang Ming continued with his questions.</p>

    <p>"No."</p>

    <p>Devil King shook his head. "That senior didn't want me to see him clearly. He was completely covered up in that Daoist robe, including his face and torso. When I used the Holy King Eye, he looked blurry, as if I was very short-sighted. The only thing I can be sure of was the look in this senior's eyes."</p>

    <p>"What kind of look?" Everyone's curiosity was piqued.</p>

    <p>"This senior had dead fish eyes," Devil King said.</p>

    <p>Everybody: " ??? "</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In Night Chief's general HQ, President Bai, who had returned from the grave, had started his grand plan for revival.</p>

    <p>He locked Night Ghost Spirit Emperor up in the soul repository, and then directly declared his identity to everyone here.</p>

    <p>He was Bai Zhe, President Bai of Night Chief. Not Night Ghost Spirit Emperor!</p>

    <p>Anyone who disobeyed him would die.</p>

    <p>Now that he had Night Ghost Spirit Emperor's body, he was a level nine True Immortal. This powerful body combined with the Creation Art took his formidable self-healing ability to even greater heights.</p>

    <p>As Night Ghost Spirit Emperor had said, President Bai was ambitious - he would never be willing to live in someone else's shadow.</p>

    <p>In fact, Night Ghost Spirit Emperor had been on guard against this since early on.</p>

    <p>The best evidence of this was that when President Bai had initially gone looking for revenge by picking a fight with Wang Ling, Night Ghost Spirit Emperor deliberately hadn't stopped him.</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor's heart was as clear as a mirror that President Bai was in no way a match for that youngster.</p>

    <p>He had wanted Wang Ling to do the dirty work and take down this mutinous President Bai, who was a blight on Night Chief; he had never thought that he would still be one step behind in the end, as Bai Zhe covertly used the power of Outer Dao to seize the opportunity for a counterattack.</p>

    <p>"Any new developments?"</p>

    <p>Inside Night Chief, President Bai propped his head up on one hand as he sat on the throne and stared at the rows of technical staff in front of him, his voice deep.</p>

    <p>He was looking into all information related to Wang Ling - even a picture or the smallest clue would be good ...</p>

    <p>He wanted to find out about everyone connected to Wang Ling: his family, his friends ...</p>

    <p>And then, he would retaliate in full force.</p>

    <p>Being killed off in revenge wasn't the most painful thing. He would make that youngster experience a deeper level of pain ...</p>

    <p>"Yes, Lord Night Ghost Spirit Emperor ... "</p>

    <p>An intelligence officer in the front replied. But as soon as the words left his mouth, the technician's face abruptly changed as he realized his error. President Bai had previously already made it clear that he wasn't Night Ghost Spirit Emperor now, but should be called: Venerable Bai.</p>

    <p>But out of long habit, this poor intelligence officer had still failed to correct himself the moment he opened his mouth, resulting in this slip of the tongue.</p>

    <p>Almost instantly, the whole of Night Chief HQ was enveloped in low pressure.</p>

    <p>"I'll say it once more ... I, am Venerable Bai ... " President Bai said in a low voice.</p>

    <p>With just one crook of his finger, the space around the technician who had misspoken instantly split open and his head was swallowed whole.</p>

    <p>But in the next moment, golden light swirled around the stump of his neck, and the technician's head which had already been cut off reappeared on his body.</p>

    <p>The resurrected technician was panic-stricken and felt his neck. There wasn't the slightest trace of a split. Everything was intact.</p>

    <p>Everything that had just happened seemed like a dream.</p>

    <p>He thought he was dead, but he came back to life?</p>

    <p>"Killing a man over a trifle - too excessive, Bai Zhe ... " Following the technician's resurrection, a young-sounding voice rang out in the air.</p>

    <p>This voice instantly caused President Bai to stand up from the throne.</p>

    <p>There was no mistake. This was the voice of His Excellency Dao Master!</p>

    <p>The man who had originally passed on the power of Outer Dao to him!</p>
