  <h1>Chapter 117 If the World Insults Me, Curses Me, Betrays Me, What to Do? </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Given Wang Ling's current realm, even his clone possessed immense energy, and in order to control such energy, he would inevitably have to use his original body's spiritual force.</p>

    <p>How the fuck was he going to be able to binge watch his TV show comfortably?!</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling sensed those ten Soul Formation auras outside, it felt like he had been duped by Lord Diulei once again.</p>

    <p>He had thought that all he would be doing was guarding the stone ghost mask for a bit until Lord Diulei returned from the parent-teacher conference, which was why he had just sent a clone.</p>

    <p>Who would have thought that Landscape Manor that bunch would actually dispatch ten people, and furthermore all of them were at the the Soul Formation stage...</p>

    <p>Of course, if his real body had been here, he would have had absolutely nothing to worry about.</p>

    <p>The problem was that this was just a clone, which had one fatal weak point — when it was under extreme attack, its protection mechanism would kick in and it would instantly crumble to fine dust.</p>

    <p>At present, there were still two hours before the students of Number 60 High School were finished for the day, and three hours before the TV show aired. This meant that Wang Ling had two hours to use this clone to get rid of these ten Soul Formation cultivators. After that, he could call his clone back and then happily go home to wait for the start of the TV show.</p>

    <p>He cupped his chin in his hand and thought for a bit.</p>

    <p>After two minutes, he had come up with a more reliable solution.</p>

    <p>In the current situation, the only way he could lower the risk of his clone disappearing was by ensuring that these people didn't touch it. If it vanished, the fighting lion would be powerless to stop these ten Soul Formation cultivators from grabbing the stone ghost mask.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling searched high and low in Lord Diulei's villa for a long time before finally finding the materials for making a talisman — cinnabar, yellow talisman paper, spirit water and a writing brush.</p>

    <p>Drawing talismans was a fundamental cultivator skill, and these were essential talisman utensils in almost every household. When Wang Ling noticed that black dust powder had been mixed into Lord Diulei's cinnabar, he couldn't help sighing... mixing black dust powder into the cinnabar could greatly increase the odds of successfully making a talisman. On the market, each gram of black dust powder could sell for up to twenty thousand HNY.</p>

    <p>This was truly extravagant...</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling didn't really care whether there was black dust powder or not. Even without these supplementary materials, his success rate at making talismans was over ninety-nine percent. It was only when he was making the more rare and powerful talismans that there was a small chance he could fail.</p>

    <p>This time, Wang Ling was going to draw a functional talisman with the ultimate aim of boosting the fighting lion's prowess.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya's fighting lion was already on par with a cultivator at the the Soul Formation stage. What Wang Ling needed to do now was to carefully package it by adding special effects <sup>1</sup> — it would be best if the lion could give a formidable first impression.</p>

the hair soft and shiny.)</dfn>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>A limousine was parked outside the villa in Wenxian Garden. A tall man in a suit was the driver and Song Qingshu sat in the front passenger seat.</p>

    <p>In the back of the limo, the Ten Saints sat in a circle with their legs crossed. The space inside the car had been enlarged using the Space Expansion Skill so that it was as big as a sports field; it wouldn't have been crowded even with another hundred people inside.</p>

    <p>Currently, these ten Soul Formation cultivators were setting up an array together, which made for a pretty amazing scene.</p>

    <p>"Lord Director, what are the Ten Saints doing?" asked the driver subordinate.</p>

    <p>"They're setting up a Heaven and Earth Spirit Awakening Array." Song Qingshu narrowed his eyes.</p>

    <p>A cultivator's spiritual sense was similar to a cellphone signal; the higher a cultivator's realm, the more sensitive they were to nearby spiritual signals. This Heaven and Earth Spirit Awakening Array being set up by the Ten Saints could cause these spiritual signals to converge into one universal stream channeling down from the cosmos and connecting heaven and earth, thereby creating a blanket effect and rendering the signal invisible. Hence, in this spirit array, even a person with the highest realm would relax their guard and could be monitored without being aware of it.</p>

    <p>Legend had it that this Heaven and Earth Spirit Awakening Array was an ancient array that had been used by senior cultivators on the cultivation battlefield to monitor demon race activity. If necessary, it could be used as an offensive manoeuvre to gather and launch spiritual pressure. This pressure falling from the heavens would have the gargantuan might of a satellite laser cannon!</p>

    <p>Nowadays, however, there were fewer and fewer people who could run this array.</p>

    <p>To activate this array, a person's realm had to be at the the Soul Formation stage or higher. Furthermore, at least three people were required to set up the array together — the more people there were, the more powerful the array would be.</p>

    <p>In the front passenger seat, Song Qingshu watched this scene on a monitor screen and couldn't help exclaiming repeatedly in his heart — that was the Ten Saints for you... not only did they know about such an ancient array, but they were also so skilled at running it!</p>

    <p>At that moment, an old man with a goatee inside the array said calmly, "Director Song, Lord Diulei has left."</p>

    <p>This was the leader of the Ten Saints, with the Taoist name Great Saint...</p>

    <p>"Left?"</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu frowned. "Given Lord Diulei's personality, it's impossible that he would leave the stone ghost mask unattended in the villa. He definitely has to have some other defensive measures in place... Senior Great Saint, do you see anything else?"</p>

    <p>The goateed old man nodded. "It is as Director Song expected. Although this Lord Diulei has left, there is a youngster and a fighting lion still inside the villa."</p>

    <p>"Why is there a fighting lion?"</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu's eyebrow twitched. This fighting lion wasn't a typical soul pet, since they were bred and trained by the Xiao Clan. To be able to borrow a fighting lion... did this mean that Lord Diulei and the Xiao Clan had a close relationship?</p>

    <p>The goateed elderly Taoist smiled coldly. "Shall I get rid of this beast?"</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu: "I think... we have to take the impact of our actions into account. If we kill this fighting lion out of hand, I don't think the Xiao Clan would let this matter go. What is your opinion, Senior Great Saint?"</p>

    <p>"It seems that Director Song still doesn't quite understand how we work."</p>

    <p>The goateed elderly Taoist shook his head.</p>

    <p>"Director Song is familiar with Taoist Hanshan and Taoist Deyun? They once fought each other, and a well-known saying emerged from this confrontation..."</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu suddenly understood. "Is that the saying, 'If the world defames me, betrays me, insults me, laughs at me, despises me, humiliates me, hates me, cheats me, how should I handle it'? Of course I know it... I also know that the second part of the saying is, 'Just tolerate him, let him, leave it to him'..." <sup>2</sup></p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is adapted from a
conversation between two
well-known monks in the
Tang dynasty, monk Hanshan
and monk Shide ..)</dfn>

    <p>But before he could finish speaking, the goateed elderly Taoist directly waved his hand and interrupted him. "No, that isn't it."</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu was a little puzzled. "Senior Great Saint, please instruct me."</p>

    <p>"I wouldn't dare teach you, Director Song, you are an administrator appointed by the Lord of the Castle. In official matters, your position takes precedence over our realms. We will all follow your instructions and arrangements." The elderly Taoist smiled. "But for the smooth execution of our assignments in the future, I think it's still necessary to explain to Director Song how our Ten Saints operate..."</p>

    <p>The dialog between Taoist Hanshan and Taoist Deyun was already common knowledge.</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu was really quite curious about the different interpretation which this goateed elderly Taoist, leader of the Ten Saints, had of this saying.</p>

    <p>"The world insults me, curses me, betrays me, what to do? Actually, the answer is quite simple."</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu's eyes were fixed on the monitor screen. The elderly Taoist sitting with his legs crossed stroked his goatee as he slowly said, "You just need to mess him up, play him, laugh at him, chop him up, deal with him, beat him up, then wait for several years before you visit him at his burial mound!"</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu: "..."</p>

    <p>After saying that, the elderly Taoist stroked his goatee with satisfaction. "This is how we Ten Saints do things! It's just a beast. Who cares whether it's from the Xiao Clan or not, we have absolutely nothing to fear."</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu:"..."</p>
