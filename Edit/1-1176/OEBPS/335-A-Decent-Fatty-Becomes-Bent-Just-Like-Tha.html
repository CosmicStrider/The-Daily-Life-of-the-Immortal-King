  <h1>Chapter 335 A Decent Fatty Becomes Bent Just Like That </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was only later that Wang Ling would find out that Luo Chuang's metalware store and Kitchen Knife Sect had a close partnership. Kitchen Knife Sect's F&amp;B business covered the entire country; they had more than one hundred establishments in Songhai city alone, and almost all their table knives had been bought from Luo Chuang.</p>

    <p>Then, the old man assigned Wang Ling a task: to take his kitchen knife, preserved for many years, to Luo Chuang's metalware shop for maintenance. It just so happened that the Heavenly Materials sword which Wang Ling had given to Luo Chuang to research was still there, so he could also pick it up at the same time. In the process of making this sword, the Master of Immortal Mansion had happened to synthesize the material that could restrict Wang Ling's strength. Hence, Wang Ming had recommended that Wang Ling take it back as soon as possible and entrust it to him.</p>

    <p>When he was about to leave, Wang Ling didn't forget to tuck the voucher for free maintenance into his pocket. Even though he didn't think Luo Chuang would ask him to pay, Wang Ling didn't like to owe people favors without good cause since relationships could change easily. Moreover, this fatty was a sly businessman; owing someone like him a favor often meant going bankrupt in the end...</p>

    <p>Since he had already been to Luo Chuang's store once before, Wang Ling already roughly knew its location, so he could just teleport there directly.</p>

    <p>When he appeared in the store, Luo Chuang was carefully inspecting an ancient jade with a wearable magnifying glass; he was utterly absorbed in it, his face suffused with a radiant pink blush. Only then did Wang Ling recall that apart from being a smith, Luo Chuang was also an antiques collector.</p>

    <p>Looking at Luo Chuang's focused expression, the man most likely had dredged up some worthwhile treasure.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't disturb him, and just waited on one side. He had teleported in without a sound, and Luo Chuang hadn't noticed his presence in the slightest.</p>

    <p>About ten minutes later, Luo Chuang picked the jade up with two fingers and held it up to the ceiling light as he lavished it with praise. "Nice! I really hit the jackpot this time! If only Ling Zhenren was here, he would definitely be interested in this."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>After another thirty seconds, Luo Chuang took off the wearable magnifying glass, and then saw Wang Ling standing in front of him with a kitchen knife in hand...</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang: "..."</p>

    <p>He was so frightened that all the hair on his body stood on end; who asked Wang Ling to be so good at concealing his aura? Luo Chuang hadn't sensed him at all â€” but when had Wang Ling arrived?</p>

    <p>"Ling... Ling Zhenren, why are you here..." Luo Chuang asked. He wasn't in the mood to think about it as he wiped at his cold sweat and settled his nerves with great effort.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling just silently gave him the gold voucher and the kitchen knife.</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang instantly understood, and nodding, he accepted the kitchen knife. "Don't worry, Ling Zhenren, leave this knife to me. You get VIP service; I'll work around the clock tonight and send it to you in the morning tomorrow!"</p>

    <p>"Mm." Wang Ling nodded with satisfaction.</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang very carefully placed the knife in a magic weapons case. This case was also a type of storage space treasure, but unlike the others, there were a lot of smaller spaces inside. Luo Chuang used this case especially for the repair or maintenance of objects. Whether it was for one or the other, the object needed to be washed clean first, and this case actually had an in-built wash function.</p>

    <p>After Luo Chuang placed the old man's knife in one of the spaces inside the case, Wang Ling saw him pour a scoop of gold powder into the case before locking it. Instantly, the sounds of a washing machine came out of the case...</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang: "I designed this magic treasure case based on the washing machine! It's very useful! The only problem is that I forgot to include a noise reduction function when I designed it in the beginning."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>After putting away the kitchen knife, Luo Chuang patted his head as he suddenly remembered the Heavenly Materials sword. "That's right, I'll give you back the sword you left with me to analyze its material composition." After saying this, he opened the cabinet on the right and took the sword out; he had already wrapped the whole thing up. Wang Ling had been worried about the detrimental effect the sword substance would have on him, and he had let Luo Chuang know earlier on, which was why this Heavenly Materials sword was now wrapped up tightly like a mummy.</p>

    <p>Are you done with your research? Wang Ling took the sword and asked telepathically.</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang shook his palm-leaf fan and waved his hand. "Ever since meeting Lord Jingke, all the other spirit swords I've seen are invariably mediocre and dull. The materials used in this Heavenly Materials sword are indeed precious, and it even contains a substance I've never heard of before. But that's all there is to it... Furthermore, this sword doesn't have a sword spirit, and there is no meaning in researching a sword without one."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded in agreement with this view; that was true.</p>

    <p>Once he mentioned Jingke, Luo Chuang turned starry-eyed, and even the way he spoke turned passionate. "A spirit sword must spawn a sword spirit to be deemed valuable. This sword spirit has to be stronger or cuter than Lord Jingke... otherwise it'll never catch my attention!""..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Wang Ling sighed in his heart: A decent fatty had become bent just like that....</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stored the Heavenly Materials sword in his vision field.</p>

    <p>This instantly made Luo Chuang recall the scene of Wang Ling blowing up Immortal Mansion's spatial wall with his Heavenly Eye.</p>

    <p>Ling Zhenren's Heavenly Eye had to be of a very high grade, right?</p>

    <p>He didn't know exactly what level Wang Ling's Heavenly Eye was at. There actually hadn't been any clear-cut upper limits to the Heavenly Eye since ancient times. After opening the Heavenly Eye at the Soul Formation stage, cultivating it depended on two things: one was talent, the other was luck.</p>

    <p>If Ling Zhenren looked at that jade with his Heavenly Eye, perhaps he could pick out something unusual about it!</p>

    <p>At the thought of this, Luo Chuang abruptly came up with a bold idea.</p>

    <p>Gazing at Wang Ling, he took out the ancient jade which he had been examining earlier and passed it to him. "Ling Zhenren, would it be possible for you to take a look at my ancient jade with your Heavenly Eye?"</p>

    <p>What was this?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling accepted the ancient jade, his brow knitted.</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang: "I bought this with three immortal gold bars from the secondhand cultivation antiques mart. There's no middleman involved, so sellers keep all the profits and customers can save some money; the mart leads in trade volume by a mile <sup>1</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is adapted from the tagline for a secondhand car app ..)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang said truthfully, "The old man who was selling it didn't know anything, but I thought that this ancient jade was very unusual. After my cursory inspection just now, I think I might have discovered a heavenly fissure in it... I hope you'll be able to help me take a closer look."</p>

    <p>Heavenly fissure?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was instantly startled when he picked up the jade... Was this thing a freaking fragment of the Xuanyuan Sword?</p>
