  <h1>Chapter 1159 The Correct Posture for Shouldering a Wok</h1>

  <div>

    <p>As Wang Ling's cotton-padded jacket, Zhuo Yi was naturally aware of how important the task of shouldering the wok was. This time, however, he felt that it would be hard to place this wok on him. First of all, he hadn't left the command center. Secondly, even if he fought Human Devil, there was just too big a disparity in fighting strength; Human Devil was too strong, and it would be impossible for Zhuo Yi to get rid of him with his own strength.</p>

    <p>But Zhuo Yi, who was well-versed in the ways of carrying a wok, was well aware that even if he didn't do it, the wok might end up on his shoulders in the end anyway.</p>

    <p>It was fine, as long as he didn't admit to it...</p>

    <p>Under Old Huang's and President Qi's gazes, Zhuo Yi did his best to maintain a calm expression. A few minutes later, there was new information from the Mahjong Squad. When the image on screen switched over to the scene, a figure with green hair suddenly popped up in Zhuo Yi's view...</p>

    <p>"This is?" Headmaster Chen felt that this person looked somewhat familiar, but he couldn't say why.</p>

    <p>That was right... This was Er Ha's first public appearance in human form. No one could have imagined that the green-furred akita would actually be able to cultivate a human form in a few short months.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi remembered that Er Ha and Xiao Yin were supposed to be working together, but only Er Ha was making an appearance - perhaps to protect Xiao Yin's "holy beast" identity.</p>

    <p>"Who is this?" There was a wary look in Old Huang's eyes.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Lord Diulei instantly communicated with President Qi. "This is Mr Chong Erhe, a member of the General Office of Strategic Deception's Goon Squad."</p>

    <p>"Mr Chong Erhe?" Old Huang mused. He didn't recall seeing this name on the list the other day.</p>

    <p>President Qi secretly explained to Huang Feng telepathically, "It's like this, Old Huang: There are in fact some covert names mixed into our retinue this time. These people were appointed by the head of state himself. Even we don't know what the names are; only the head of state does. This is to prevent the true name list from being stolen so that the enemy can't take precautions against the members on the list and will be caught off guard..."</p>

    <p>Huang Feng nodded his head and instantly understood. "It's just like the head of state to plan this far ahead."</p>

    <p>He had planned to find out who was responsible for this, but since it was the head of state who had appointed these hidden members, he couldn't do anything about it.</p>

    <p>"But what is Mr Chong Erhe's background?"</p>

    <p>"He's one of the experts of the General Office of Strategic Deception, and is more powerful than an Itinerant Immortal. Moreover, his techniques are highly effective when it comes to eliminating evil spirits, which is why he was able to destroy Human Devil when the latter's defenses were down."</p>

    <p>"I see."</p>

    <p>Old Huang felt that he finally understood the whole story, and he thanked Er Ha, who was on the screen. "Thank you for your help this time, Mr Chong Erhe! If it wasn't for you, Human Devil would have continued with his secret mischief, and might have caused irreversible damage to Nine Dragon Mountain's environment."</p>

    <p>Chong Erhe was Er Ha's human alias, and was actually a recombination of the radicals in Er Ha's name<sup>1</sup>.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Er Ha 二蛤 and Chong Erhe 虫二合)</dfn>

    <p>Er Ha was well aware that very few people knew about his human form.</p>

    <p>An alias would also help hide his identity.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei had already set up everything for him, like an ID card and whatnot...</p>

    <p>He was now a dog with a proper identity! And his registered residence was in Songhai city! How many people nowadays were jumping around because of residency issues? But he as a dog had a residency permit!</p>

    <p>Originally, he could only silently help mankind out behind the scenes as a dog.</p>

    <p>This could be considered Er Ha's first time stepping out from behind the scenes and onto the stage.</p>

    <p>He couldn't help but feel a little excited. "Old Huang, I'm flattered. In fact, this isn't entirely my doing."</p>

    <p>When Er Ha said this, the atmosphere in the command center instantly froze. Stunned, Zhuo Yi looked up... As the scapegoat who had been fighting hard on the front line all this time, he was abruptly aware of the subtle implication in Er Ha's words.</p>

    <p>"Director Zhuo - he was the one who arranged everything," Er Ha said at that moment.</p>

    <p>It was an unexpected answer that nevertheless made sense...</p>

    <p>The expressions on everyone's faces changed. Many of the headmasters present turned to look at two people.</p>

    <p>One was Headmaster Chen of Number 60 High.</p>

    <p>The other, of course, was Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Director Zhuo...</p>

    <p>How many people were there in the world who could do this title proud?</p>

    <p>Things had already come to this point, but Headmaster Chen conversely remained composed. Zhuo Yi's career path was endless - this was also strong motivation for Number 60 High. When Number 60 High was renovated, the old stone sculpture at the school gate would be changed into a life-sized statue of Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>It was also the greatest blessing for Number 60 High to be able to produce such an excellent student. As the current headmaster of Number 60 High, it was impossible for Headmaster Chen not to brag.</p>

    <p>Under everyone's gazes, he simply shrugged his shoulders and adopted a breezy attitude. "Everyone, you're too kind. The students of our Number 60 High have always been this outstanding."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, the other headmasters secretly felt sour in their hearts.</p>

    <p>These words sounded so shameless...</p>

    <p>But they couldn't find a reason to refute it.</p>

    <p>And as an involved party, Zhuo Yi clearly looked distressed...</p>

    <p>He knew things would end up like this!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, after the mountain spirit fell silent once more, the attack on Fire Peak picked up again.</p>

    <p>It was just that this time, no one dared to use the Spirit Summoning Technique in battle again.</p>

    <p>The four high schools at the bottom decided to fight to the death, and gathered all their strength to launch a single combined attack on Number 60 High on the mountaintop. No matter how many people they lost, they would wipe out Number 60 High first!</p>

    <p>"The combined attack has started."</p>

    <p>Based on Number 60 High's initial strategy, they would still focus on defense. Even in the face of an attack from four schools, everyone was full of confidence. However, something was clearly wrong with one person.</p>

    <p>It was Xia Ming.</p>

    <p>Xia Ming now felt that he clearly understood what it was like to have great power.</p>

    <p>Power was admittedly good, but if he couldn't control it, and ultimately wound up hurting the person he liked... Xia Ming felt that he might as well not have this sort of power. He had frozen when he saw the giant hand of Fire Peak's mountain spirit stretch out of the ground. He hadn't wanted to believe that he was the one who had created the scene in front of him with his own hands.</p>

    <p>The mountain spirit had gone back to sleep, but Xia Ming no longer had the courage to use his power.</p>

    <p>He was afraid it would go out of control again.</p>

    <p>When he was feeling anxious, he felt a warm hand suddenly land on his shoulder.</p>

    <p>Who was it?</p>

    <p>He turned his head slightly, and was surprised to see Wang Ling standing behind him...</p>
