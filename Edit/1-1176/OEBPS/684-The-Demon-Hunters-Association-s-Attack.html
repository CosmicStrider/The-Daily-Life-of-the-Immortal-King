  <h1>Chapter 684 The Demon Hunters Association's Attack?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Anyone at Number 60 High could see that Uncle Qiu had already been there for a long time. This was an uncle who had witnessed Number 60 High's history of hardships. Some said that one of the reasons why Number 60 High could stand firm in the face of so many disasters was Uncle Qiu.</p>

    <p>In fact, there had been no shortage of legends about Uncle Qiu all these years. In Number 60 High's Tieba circle, at least, there were numerous legends about him. Many people thought that Uncle Qiu was a hidden expert with a mysterious identity. Moreover, there were several times when people had even seen Uncle Qiu crack eggs in the shape of the yin yang symbol when he was making pancakes...</p>

    <p>This was precisely why legends about Uncle Qiu popped up one after another, and they could be found online.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling hadn't attended this school for long, but he had also already eaten Uncle Qiu's pancakes. Furthermore, they were currently the best thing Wang Ling felt that he had ever eaten apart from crispy noodle snacks. The point was that this five-yuan pancake had plenty of filling, which included sweet sauce, chili, egg, crackers, youtiao, tenderloin, sausage and anything else.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling arrived at school that morning, he happened to see Chen Chao buying a pancake, so after thinking about it, he also took out five yuan to buy one.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling! Are you also buying a pancake?" Chen Chao greeted him as he chewed on his freshly made pancake.</p>

    <p>Today, Uncle Qiu had a special "buy one egg and get one free" offer. Just like when he had made the pancake for Chen Chao earlier, he directly cracked two eggs... in the end, four eggs yolks came out! Both these eggs were actually double-yolked!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Uncle Qiu was stunned, and so was Chen Chao... What kind of operation was this?!</p>

    <p>Uncle Qiu laughed. "This student is pretty lucky!"</p>

    <p>After spreading out the pancake, Uncle Qiu asked, "Student, do you want youtiao or crackers?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling took out a crispy noodle snack packet from his pocket and opened it, then divided the contents in half before giving one portion to Uncle Qiu.</p>

    <p>Uncle Qiu: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The morning at Number 60 High today was more peaceful than expected.</p>

    <p>It had already been a whole night since word of the Demon Hunters Association's planned attack had broken yesterday. Last night, Number 60 High had sent out a lot of teachers to make emergency home visits and to do a lot of coordinating and to appease parents. Even then, there were still one or two parents who decided that their children would take a leave of absence and so didn't attend school today.</p>

    <p>As for how many parents would choose to transfer their children out after this incident, this wasn't something Wang Ling couldn't calculate. He had chosen Number 60 High in the very beginning because he wanted to live a peaceful study life. This was because in every respect, whether it was the school's location, campus history or overall assessment, Number 60 High in fact seemed very average compared with other ordinary high schools.</p>

    <p>But the absurd part was that the things which had happened since the semester started ten or so weeks ago didn't make Number 60 High seem like an average school at all...</p>

    <p>Would the Demon Hunters Association's attack proceed smoothly?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought that this was a question mark.</p>

    <p>Because his eyelid warning had already stopped...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, Father Wang was still fighting Singers Institute, the live streamer who stole songs, and fans on both sides were blowing the matter up. In addition to the fan viewers who supported Father Wang and were boycotting this thieving live streamer, there was also a key figure who was directly causing this battle to enter a white-hot state.</p>

    <p>This person was none other than Daoist Guang who had just become a live streamer and entered the live stream circle in recent weeks.</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang was the all-round big brother on the Cultivation Broadcasting platform. He had amassed millions of fans in a few short weeks, directly creating a new record in the website's history. Now, as long as Daoist Guang started live streaming, he would hit over ten million views in less than ten minutes.</p>

    <p>Why was Daoist Guang so popular? While timing and luck played a role, another factor was that his island was something he had created himself and he could come up with all sorts of new material for a survival broadcast series to live stream to the audience every day. He could even create bogus spirit beasts on the island out of clay to bring out the best in the program.</p>

    <p>It was very normal for a live streamer to create effects for their program to begin with. However, the live streamer should also use their own actual abilities to do so; relying on crooked methods and a mixed bag of tricks in the end wasn't right.</p>

    <p>Knowing that Father Wang's song had been infringed, Daoist Guang's attitude was very clear. He directly changed the title of his live stream room to "Langya Broadcasting Platform's 'Shadow Fool - Dean' Stealing and Lip-Syncing Songs!" and even publicly expressed on Weibo how he felt about the issue of stealing and lip-syncing songs - this became the fuse that ignited the whole incident.</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang knew that this Senior Wang was Ling Zhenren's father; how could this senior be an ordinary person? Daoist Guang didn't even need to think about it before he sided firmly with Father Wang.</p>

    <p>However, he couldn't use this explanation with outsiders. Therefore, after obtaining Father Wang's permission, Daoist Guang directly made public some information.</p>

    <p>That was, the person who was currently ranked number one on his fan list with the ID "Has Three Days And Two Sleeps Been Updated," and whom many of the water friends in the live stream room called "Brother Sleep," was the famous guru writer "Wang Situ" himself.</p>

    <p>When the news came out, it wasn't just the live stream circle, but the novel circle also exploded.</p>

    <p>"Damn, it turns out this guy is Wang Situ?"</p>

    <p>"My god... so Wang Situ is Lord Island's fan, too?"</p>

    <p>"Haha, that live streamer is finished. Not only did he do Wang Situ wrong, he even offended Lord Island. Wang Situ's given Lord Island so many gifts, their relationship certainly isn't an ordinary one!"</p>

    <p>This gave Daoist Guang, as a live streamer on another platform, a better reason for helping to crush that thieving live streamer "Singers Institute."</p>

    <p>Nowadays, Daoist Guang was the big brother of the Cultivation Broadcasting platform, while Father Wang was a very famous Internet guru. For these two people to join hands to crush a live streamer was basically a declaration that the live streamer was already done for.</p>

    <p>Staring at the screen, Lie Mengmeng sighed. "This person is also obstinate. Wouldn't this have been over if he had apologized early on?"</p>

    <p>"You don't understand, some people won't shed tears until they see the coffin." Father Wang sighed. "If you don't believe me, take a look..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang opened the live streamer's live stream room to show the other side sitting there as if nothing had happened as he didn't respond at all to the issue of stealing and lip-syncing songs.</p>

    <p>"This man really has the nerve..." Lie Mengmeng was speechless.</p>

    <p>"He's good at playing dead. He did the same last year and played dead when he ran into trouble. The people slamming him then got tired after some time and slowly stopped investigating. But the problem is that he's never encountered a stubborn enough person." Father Wang laughed. "He dared steal the song I gave to my wife, it looks like this guy doesn't want to live anymore..."</p>

    <p>"How do you want to deal with him?" Lie Mengmeng asked.</p>

    <p>Father Wang drew his thumb across his throat. "Shut him down."</p>
