  <h1>Chapter 982 Wang Ling's Management Status</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The array in the blind alley glowed with light, which was followed by a force that pulled Fang Xing in.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing followed Bai Youquan into another world.</p>

    <p>To his surprise, inside wasn't the base he had imagined, but a world newly created.</p>

    <p>Everything here was inverted, like a mirror reflection.</p>

    <p>"Could this also be the power of DGL<sup>1</sup>..." Fang Xing thought.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(DGL is a nicknamed used by netizens to mock a LoL team called LGD for its inconsistent game results.)</dfn>

    <p>Bai Youquan looked at him from the side and gave an enigmatic smile. "Classmate Fang, welcome to the world our master set up: the Palace of Mirrors."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing then saw Bai Youquan take out the cremation urn which he had given the latter earlier, take out a very small portion of ash, and then sprinkle it on the ground like Brother Salt<sup>2</sup>. In an instant, the embryo of a spirit plant suddenly emerged from the ground.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Referring to the video of a Turkish chef flamboyantly sprinkling salt on a steak which went viral..)</dfn>

    <p>The stamen of this spirit plant was a human-looking baby that was now only about the size of a sweet potato. The flower stem was very thick and the plant was firmly rooted in the ground as it seemed to absorb the spirit power beneath the surface to nourish itself.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing noticed that the Palace of Mirrors was a complete reversal. Spiritual qi was now being consumed at a very quick rate on Earth, and researchers were all racking their brains to solve this problem. However, the spiritual qi inside this Palace of Mirrors was unimaginably rich.</p>

    <p>"Come, I'll take you to His Lordship," Bai Youquan said to Fang Xing after planting this spirit plant at the entrance.</p>

    <p>"Then, this flower?"</p>

    <p>"Leave it; after twenty-four hours, I'll bring you back to harvest your dad."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, after confirming that Fang Xing had been abducted, Wang Ling and the others started to do a preliminary search.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing's aura had completely vanished, as if he had disappeared off the face of the planet. The problem, however, was that no one could just vanish into thin air; even if someone did disappear, there was still the last place they were seen before it happened.</p>

    <p>"I've already contacted my friend; he'll use national AI face recognition technology to determine the positions of all the players," Guo Ping said.</p>

    <p>"Perhaps it doesn't have to be that troublesome." Wang Ming shook his head and said, "How many surveillance cameras are there across the country?"</p>

    <p>"Even if you rule out the ones that are currently broken or under maintenance, there are over three hundred million..." Guo Ping said. This was Huaxiu's Divine Eye Project, which had initially been set up to prevent crime.</p>

    <p>Almost all public places (not including toilets and some relatively private venues) were covered by the Divine Eye Project's road cameras, which were exceptionally clear; after zooming in, even the fine hairs on your face could be clearly seen.</p>

    <p>Thinking about what Wang Ming said, Guo Ping realized that he was looking at it the wrong way. "Are you saying that we should check the damaged cameras or those being serviced?"</p>

    <p>"Since there are broken cameras and those under maintenance, we might get results more quickly by starting with these in Songhai city. That gang shouldn't be stupid enough to brazenly make Fang Xing disappear."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Guo Ping nodded hurriedly. "Alright."</p>

    <p>The Divine Eye Project was laid out on a massive scale, but the proportion of damaged cameras and those under maintenance was very low: it was less than 5% throughout the country, and even less in Songhai itself.</p>

    <p>"Then we'll start with the damaged ones. I'll arrange it." As Guo Ping spoke, he gazed at Wang Ling; he had noticed that Wang Ling had remained as still as a log since the beginning.</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren, what are you..."</p>

    <p>"He's confirming some things. His soul should have already left his body; it's best that you don't bother him in this state," Wang Ming warned.</p>

    <p>"Why..."</p>

    <p>"This is management mode; even when his body is without its soul, half the world still can't beat him..."</p>

    <p>"I see..." Guo Ping nodded thoughtfully. When he had entered earlier, he thought that Wang Ling's skin was especially good. After learning that the energy string with which he had used to travel through space was Wang Ling's hair, Guo Ping's interest in Wang Ling had skyrocketed right away!</p>

    <p>Until now, it hadn't been easy to get close to Ling Zhenren, and Guo Ping almost couldn't resist the urge just then! He actually... actually wanted to pinch Ling Zhenren's face!</p>

    <p>Sure enough, cute boys really made it easy for people to "commit crimes"!</p>

    <p>"Teacher Guo, are you thinking of something vulgar and disrespectful about my little brother?" Wang Ming was aware of how eccentric Guo Ping was. As a qualified and perverted bro-con, Wang Ming was doing his best to remain level-headed.</p>

    <p>Guo Ping wheedled, "Ling Zhenren isn't around right now. Don't you want to do an up-close study of the human body?"</p>

    <p>"Study of the human body..." Hearing this, Wang Ming sucked in a cold breath of air. He never expected Guo Ping to actually put it in such a tactful and natural way; the main point was that it sounded pretty damn reasonable!</p>

    <p>They were both scientific researchers, and a study of the human body up close was vital!</p>

    <p>But no way!</p>

    <p>Wang Ming felt that he had to keep calm - how could he let another researcher touch his little brother?!</p>

    <p>"Teacher Guo, please stop right there with your outrageous thoughts about my little brother." Wang Ming was so agitated that he stood up and knocked the teacup off the table with his elbow. The teacup fell to the floor, but it didn't break given the material it was made from, and instead rolled over to Wang Ling's feet.</p>

    <p>Then, when the teacup touched Wang Ling's shoe, an astonishing thing happened...</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>A shock wave blasted out with Wang Ling in the center. Then, lasers shot out of Ling Zhenren's eyes as he sat docilely in his chair, and the teacup shattered...</p>

    <p>With one gust of wind, not even ash remained...</p>

    <p>"Teacher Guo, do you still want to try it..." Wang Ming hesitated.</p>

    <p>"Well... Let's postpone this investigation for now... We can always try later..." Guo Ping pulled his neck in and drew his hand back...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, Wang Ling's soul appeared on Divine Dao Star. Divine Dao Star was located far from Earth, but Wang Ling had already been here once and left his aura here, so he could come back anytime.</p>

    <p>It hadn't been half a month since Star Lord of Divine Dao Star had been beaten to a pulp, and he hadn't fully recovered.</p>

    <p>Jingke's attack previously had been a little fierce, and as long as the injury was caused by Jingke, it wouldn't heal so easily.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling went over this time, Star Lord was still wrapped up in bandages as he lay in bed with one leg raised.</p>

    <p>The divine messenger-turned-throne had been hacked to pieces by Jingke and Bai Qiao's fused personality Jingbai - the word "tragic" didn't even begin to describe it.</p>

    <p>In any case, after going through all that, the residual effects had been completely beaten into Star Lord's body. He didn't even keep goldfish in his fish tank anymore; when he looked at those dead fish eyes, it felt like Wang Ling was looking at him, and his dreams every day frightened him into a cold sweat.</p>

    <p>This time, Wang Ling appeared without any warning. He floated in the air and stared at Star Lord...</p>

    <p>Star Lord was so scared he pissed his pants.</p>

    <p>WTF! The... The Grudge!</p>
