  <h1>Chapter 309 Dharmaraja's Girlfriends </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was June 27th, the tenth Tuesday of the semester.</p>

    <p>In the wee hours of the morning, all the trains had stopped running. Wang Ling, Lord Diulei and the others returned to Songhai city on the last spirit bus.</p>

    <p>With regards to the Immortal Mansion incident, Zhuo Yi had actually already had some idea about it. It was only after Lord Diulei explained it to him for a long time that he finally clearly understood the situation.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was the one who personally bought their spirit bus tickets back to Songhai city.</p>

    <p>He also personally handled the secret transport of the silver unicorn to ensure that no one else would find out about it.</p>

    <p>After that, he had to stay behind to deal with the mess that Immortal Mansion had made.</p>

    <p>It was during this time that Wang Ling finally realized the advantage of having Zhuo Yi around. Although he had taken in Zhuo Yi on a whim to begin with, Zhuo Yi this disciple had truly proven his worth.</p>

    <p>At the very least, he was far more considerate than Wang Ling had imagined.</p>

    <p>But while these trivial matters could be left to Zhuo Yi, there were still some bigger issues which the group had to work together to settle.</p>

    <p>On the spirit bus, everyone was thinking about Fang Xing's problem.</p>

    <p>Because until now, he had yet to wake up.</p>

    <p>"When we get back, I'll visit Brother Fang Xing's parents in person. They must be very worried right now..." Lord Diulei rubbed his forehead as he felt a headache coming on, because Fang Xing had told his parents that he would be going on a study exchange this time. It was going to be difficult to explain to his foster parents why he was now in a coma.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei had met the Fang couple before. They were sincere people who made a honest living with their noodles shop, and they had doted on Fang Xing since he was a kid. If they saw their child come back after a "study exchange" in a coma, it would be surprising if they <em>didn't</em> want to strangle Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>"If my calculations are correct, the Heavenly Materials sword will definitely give me a solution. But I can't draw any conclusions until after I've gone back and carefully analyzed the materials in the sword with my tools." Luo Chuang sighed.</p>

    <p>The Heavenly Materials sword was in his hands now. Wang Ling had personally broken into Cheng Yu's intrinsic spirit field to get it, and had brought it out along with the other thousand-odd spirit swords before handing Cheng Yu over to Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Apart from the Heavenly Materials sword, all the other swords had been handed over to the government.</p>

    <p>"All right, we will have to trouble Brother Luo!"</p>

    <p>"It's nothing. Once I have news, I'll let you know right away," said Luo Chuang as he nodded gravely.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya also suggested, "Brother Fang Xing can stay on my Chrysanthemum Island for the next two days. On one hand, it'll make it easier for me to take care of him. On the other, I also want to try some new methods; perhaps one of them will be able to wake him up."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at Fang Xing's face a little blankly.</p>

    <p>It could be said that Fang Xing's coma was the largest variable in the campaign to annihilate Immortal Mansion's core headquarters this time. It was because of this variable that the plot of Er Ha's dream, where a Taoist in red tried to kill a fat man with a hundred swords, hadn't materialized. If they had followed the script, the person who should be in a coma now would be either Luo Chuang or Dharmaraja.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling knew there was no point in debating this now.</p>

    <p>The other prickly problem in front of them right now was that Ya Xuan girl who was still asleep.</p>

    <p>This girl had fallen into a deep sleep after they had gotten on the spirit bus, and she was even drooling...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Brother Ling... are you sure you've cured her?"</p>

    <p>Why did he feel that this girl was still a little stupid?</p>

    <p>"..." This time, it was Wang Ling's turn to drop his forehead into his hand. His Great Purification Spell might have expelled the poison that had been in the girl's body, but that didn't mean it would directly remove her personality... It was possible that even when she woke up, she would still be an "idiot."</p>

    <p>"So, is anyone willing to take her in...?"</p>

    <p>Hardly had Lord Diulei said this when all the men in the bus turned to look away.</p>

    <p>With Wang Ling, it naturally didn't need to be said — there was no way he would take anyone in.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya was already taking Fang Xing. Luo Chuang and Dharmaraja, these two damn fat nerds, were both avowed bachelors.</p>

    <p>In the end, Cailian Zhenren sighed. "Then leave her to me for the time being... But then again, why are all of you so reluctant? Aren't you still single? You're old already, it's time to think for yourselves, and raise children to provide for you in your old age!"</p>

    <p>"Nope!"</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja waved his hands and smiled. "Zhenren, you have a boyfriend, of course you don't know the advantages of living alone. When you're single, you can eat whatever you want. On weekends, you can stay at home all day watching DVDs, drinking and sleeping. You don't have to clean your room! And most importantly, I'm not lacking in girlfriends!"</p>

    <p>As he said this, everyone in the bus was startled. "When did you get a girlfriend?"</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja: "I have different types! Except it's a little troublesome, because I have to blow them up for use..."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>The corners of Cailian Zhenren's lips twitched. "...You deserve to be a damn single dog for a thousand years!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling got home, it was six o'clock in the morning. Since he wasn't a talkative person at home, the Wang couple were unaware of the fact that a clone of his had gone to school in his place. The only one who had noticed this abnormality was Er Ha, whose sense of smell had become increasingly sensitive almost every day after becoming a dog.</p>

    <p>When it had been a toad, Er Ha had trained its tongue, which in the toad world was also known as "oral techniques." Now that it was a dog, training its nose was what it did every day.</p>

    <p>Little Master Ling's real body and his clone had different scents, and Er Ha could clearly detect this. If it was Little Master Ling's real body, his skin would give off a light fragrance!</p>

    <p>Mm... Er Ha would never mistaken the scent!</p>

    <p>Hence, when Wang Ling teleported back to his room that morning, Er Ha, who had been lying on a mat on the first floor, almost immediately opened its eyes.</p>

    <p>It knew that Little Master Ling was back.</p>

    <p>And from the subtle aura that permeated the air, Er Ha thought that Little Master Ling didn't seem very happy.</p>

    <p>Indeed, Wang Ling was a little preoccupied that day, and he didn't know why. When he passed Class Two in the morning, he even stared blankly at a particular seat inside the classroom that was empty — this was Fang Xing's seat.</p>

    <p>The Great Purification Spell hadn't been able to purify the strange qi inside Fang Xing, which made Wang Ling feel very concerned.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, Luo Chuang was extremely efficient. When Wang Ling opened his messages after school, Lord Diulei had already sent him a screenshot. It was from Luo Chuang, and was a list of the materials which the Heavenly Materials sword was made of, even including those that were just trace elements.</p>

    <p>Some of the materials in this list were very familiar to Wang Ling while there were others he had never seen before.</p>

    <p>He thought for a bit, and then simply sent this screenshot to Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>In less than three seconds, Wang Ling felt his wristwatch vibrate violently... his idiotic elder brother had actually replied in one second!</p>

    <p><em>— Hehe, I knew you missed me!</em></p>

    <p>This was what Wang Ming had written in his reply message.</p>

    <p>Looking at it, Wang Ling wanted to smash his watch.</p>
