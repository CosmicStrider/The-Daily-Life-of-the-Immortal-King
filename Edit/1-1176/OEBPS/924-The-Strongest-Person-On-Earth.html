  <h1>Chapter 924 The Strongest Person On Earth</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The person sitting on a golden throne in the center of the hall had a tall and erect posture and an electric gaze as he looked down at them. He had changed his appearance completely to look like an Earthling.</p>

    <p>"I've been waiting here for you for a long time." Star Lord of Divine Dao Star opened his mouth - he had already mastered Earth's language.</p>

    <p>His Northeastern accent switched to a normal one as the atmosphere gradually turned serious.</p>

    <p>"The rebellion today is the consequence of your expansion and engulfment - I'd like to see what happens to you after this." Bai Qiao's pupils contracted as her gaze turned sharp. At the same time, she directed her spirit energy little by little to the ahoge on her head.</p>

    <p>"Resistance is futile; as the strongest person on Earth, you're nowhere near as strong as I am. Even if you have no care for yourself, you should think about the children who were dragged into this with you - they're just a bunch of high school students, and could have lived modestly on Divine Dao Star. Now, thanks to you, they have to die." Star Lord sneered mockingly, and the expression on his face turned colder.</p>

    <p>Sitting high and mighty on his throne, he didn't move as his eyes emitted intense godly power which swept forward, and Bai Qiao felt a heavy sense of oppression.</p>

    <p>If it wasn't for the halos on her, Bai Qiao didn't know if she would have been able to withstand such pressure.</p>

    <p>"How interesting - you actually refined the hair on your head into a magic artifact. Among all the many planets I've plundered, there was a group on the Mocking Star which you resemble very closely; could you be a distant relative?" After feeling things out with godly pressure, Divine Dao Star's Star Lord made a derisive sound.</p>

    <p>"Come down and fight me!"</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao hmphed, full of battle spirit.</p>

    <p>"I am Star Lord of Divine Dao Star - I am God! I should naturally sit up high on my throne. For me to come down to you... you're not worthy," Star Lord said in a soft, cold voice.</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao's face was calm as she chuckled. "Since you are already well acquainted with Earth's culture, you should know that there are some things you shouldn't be so sure about. The quicker you raise a FLAG, the quicker you die."</p>

    <p>"Impudent! You dare curse Star Lord?!" snapped a Divine Dragon standing next to Divine Dao Star's Star Lord. The man wore a black bamboo hat and an iron mask; this was Star Lord's personal servant.</p>

    <p>This man had the most vibrant aura in all of Star Lord's Divine Palace apart from Star Lord himself.</p>

    <p>"I'm talking to your master. You pervert wearing an S&amp;M mask, you're very rude." Bai Qiao's poisonous tongue hadn't withered in the least as she lashed back with a snort.</p>

    <p>"You insolent, arrogant peon! There is no need for His Excellency Star Lord to personally deal with someone like you at all!" The servant was so infuriated that he clenched his teeth. He took off his hat, and a powerful, bloody aura gushed forth from all his pores. A golden-red pattern of lines spread out over his body, and in a moment, the cry of a dragon rang out in the inner hall.</p>

    <p>"Roar of the Dragon God?" Bai Qiao's eyes turned cold and her ahoge swung out. Enhanced by the infinite halos, her ahoge turned into a piece of silk which lashed out.</p>

    <p>This blow was as heavy as three hundred thousand catties, and the servant screamed as half his body was whipped to shreds and he was sent flying.</p>

    <p>The dozen or so BUFFs Wang Ling had given Bai Qiao weren't just for show! The servant suffered heavily from the unexpected and lethal pain. With a spray of blood, he flew back and crashed into a palace pillar, breaking it right through the middle.</p>

    <p>This scene made Star Lord frown. He raised his hand, and with a mere flick of his finger, time seemed to reverse itself.</p>

    <p>The injuries of the servant who had been swept away healed and he returned to his former position, while the palace pillar which had been broken was also restored.</p>

    <p>Star Lord was a little displeased that his servant had disgraced him. He frowned and stared at the servant. "Hurry up and withdraw, you good-for-nothing!"</p>

    <p>The servant's injuries had recovered, and even his memory of how he had gotten them had disappeared. However, when he saw Star Lord flare up, the servant instantly realized that he had probably attacked and lost just now.</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao looked at Star Lord. "Reversing time?"</p>

    <p>"I'm a god; naturally, I can do anything," Star Lord said lightly, as if it was nothing. "Mastering time is the same as mastering everything... It isn't just time, but I have mastered all the Dao in the universe. This is Divine Dao. While I only have one, it is equal to everything, and no one can match it."</p>

    <p>"The power of Divine Dao?"</p>

    <p>Behind Bai Qiao, Wang Ling lowered his eyes.</p>

    <p>He had never heard of this kind of power.</p>

    <p>He knew of Heavenly Dao and Outer Dao.</p>

    <p>But what on earth was Divine Dao?</p>

    <p>The universe was so big; there were things that even Wang Ling didn't know.</p>

    <p>Sitting on his throne, Star Lord gave a cold and dark smile. "Compared with Divine Dao, Heavenly Dao and Outer Dao are mere drops in the ocean. My one Divine Dao is equal to ten thousand Heavenly Dao. If I develop a second one, and a third and fourth... Who in the universe can stop me? I am a king, and I'm a genius! I comprehended Divine Dao on my own, which is why I have all of this!"</p>

    <p>"You're too full of yourself." Bai Qiao took a deep breath and struggled to remain cool while Star Lord spoke.</p>

    <p>In front of Star Lord, she was under serious pressure she had never felt before.</p>

    <p>Divine Dao was really too intense!</p>

    <p>One Divine Dao was equal to ten thousand Heavenly Dao...</p>

    <p>"So, you plan to conquer the universe with this one Divine Dao?" Bai Qiao stared at Star Lord.</p>

    <p>"I certainly plan to develop a second and third one, but so far, with this one Divine Dao alone, I already rule practically the entire universe." Star Lord chuckled. "I'm a genius. I can cultivate whenever I want, but conquering the universe is more interesting."</p>

    <p>"You rash thing, take this!" Bai Qiao's ahoge swung out to the front. A divine light rose from the top of her head and turned into a huge golden sword which sliced down at the high throne.</p>

    <p>Star Lord's eyes were cold.</p>

    <p>He sighed in his heart. Earth was indeed the weakest planet he had ever besieged. The strongest person was only capable of this much; he was incomparably disappointed.</p>

    <p>"A petty trick. You actually want to fight me with something so unsightly." He parried this huge golden sword with his little finger, and then flicked it away.</p>

    <p>The fallout from Divine Dao bombarded Bai Qiao and even destroyed the multiple BUFFs on her. Bai Qiao's ahoge was so shaken it wilted and split in two, which made her very twitchy.</p>

    <p>"Are you done yet?! Boss!" At that moment, Bai Qiao finally couldn't help looking at Wang Ling behind her.</p>

    <p>"Five more seconds."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling returned Bai Qiao's gaze.</p>

    <p>Five...</p>

    <p>Four...</p>

    <p>Three...</p>

    <p>Two...</p>

    <p>One...</p>

    <p>Analysis of Divine Dao, complete.</p>

    <p>When Divine Dao aura burst forth from Wang Ling, Star Lord's expression finally changed â€” dammit! He knew something wasn't right about this guy with the dead fish eyes!</p>
