  <h1>Chapter 1097 Poor Student Wang Ling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Rather than fright, it was dismay that jolted Wang Ling back to his senses.</p>

    <p>This Xiang Yiyun should also be placed on the list of people he had to be wary of.</p>

    <p>Looking at school doctor Xiang Yiyun's wicked smile, Wang Ling sank into thought as he confirmed that this school doctor had noticed something — he knew that Wang Ling had been pretending to be dead, and he had deliberately set up that performance just now. But it shouldn't be possible for him to see through Wang Ling's technique; more likely, he had made a guess based on his many years as a doctor.</p>

    <p>In short, this Xiang Yiyun was a dangerous person — it would be better to pay closer attention to him from now on.</p>

    <p>Bending down, Xiang Yiyun checked Wang Ling's condition again, then confirmed with the teachers around them, "It's fine now, it was because of the stress just now. Young people have healthy bodies, and will recover on their own. An older person with a lower realm, on the other hand, would need help."</p>

    <p>"Mm, it's good that Student Wang Ling is alright." The teachers, whose hearts had been in their mouths, finally relaxed.</p>

    <p>Only that male teacher who had been ready to give first aid looked sullen.</p>

    <p>"What's wrong, Teacher Li?"</p>

    <p>"Ai, I still don't know — should I stick my tongue in when giving CPR? How about Student Wang Ling lie down again and we do an in-depth study?"</p>

    <p>Everyone and Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Even a joke has its limits. Wang Ling is my student, and I'll be taking him back. Everyone else can go worry over Student Xia Ming." Teacher Pan stepped out once again at a critical moment. Of course she knew that this Teacher Li was actually joking, but Teacher Li Renyong had a bad habit of cracking jokes at the worst time.</p>

    <p>Thus, Wang Ling was brought back to the office under Teacher Pan's protection.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan took a form out of a drawer and handed it to Wang Ling. At the very top was the title "Domestic Violence Questionnaire."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Student Wang Ling, I actually let your parents know to come to school this time, but I never expected them to not seem worried about you at all." Teacher Pan heaved a sigh and looked earnestly at Wang Ling. "Tell me the truth: do your parents normally act violently against you at home?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan: "Don't be afraid, I'm here! If someone hurts you at home, you must be brave and tell me!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling wanted to cry but had no tears to shed: "..." Violence... not at all! Father and Mother Wang had simply doted on him since young, and basically treated him as the apple of their eye.</p>

    <p>Conversely, it was Wang Ling who felt a little apologetic when it came to his parents' devoted care.</p>

    <p>But indeed, Father and Mother Wang were helpless to do anything else — not long after Wang Ling was born, the whole family relocated to a villa in a remote suburb in order not to create trouble for their neighbors.</p>

    <p>Imagine if you lived with a nuclear bomb in your arms every day — you would be on edge the whole time, too.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling shook his head.</p>

    <p>It was impossible to confess to something which never happened.</p>

    <p>Father and Mother Wang were very good to him — if Father Wang didn't look for excuses to dock his pocket money, that would be even better!</p>

    <p>It was obvious that there was some misunderstanding, and Wang Ling just needed to make things clear. He also didn't expect Teacher Pan to show him so much care at the beginning of the semester.</p>

    <p>This was a good thing. At the very least, it proved that Teacher Pan had a sense of responsibility as a teacher of the people. For Wang Ling, however, this excessive care was troublesome.</p>

    <p>He just wanted to finish out his high school life peacefully as an ordinary high school student.</p>

    <p>"Student Wang Ling, don't be afraid. Cold violence is also violence," Teacher Pan said very earnestly.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Not good at expressing himself with words, Wang Ling could only bend his head and start filling in this questionnaire. He used excellent, high school exam composition skills to write an essay describing Father and Mother Wang's meticulous care for him growing up.</p>

    <p>Every exam essay had a format. By analyzing and summarizing what they were, Wang Ling could predict beforehand what style the exam marker preferred: emotion, creativity, an emphasis on flowery language, or something close to real life.</p>

    <p>In Teacher Pan's case, Wang Ling sensed that she preferred to see more emotion, so he wrote a chicken soup essay in the [Words From the Heart] section of this questionnaire.</p>

    <p>As a result, beautiful words were peppered throughout Wang Ling's essay.</p>

    <p>1: My parents are like candles that are warm and give off light, showing me hope and warmth, while I am like a small flame, so weak that I may be accidentally blown out. (Alluding to Father Wang docking his pocket money)</p>

    <p>2: My father's love is like a towering mountain as well as a flourishing tree, which protects me from the wind and rain. I, on the other hand, am like a bird in the tree, although the branches will sometimes scrape my feathers. (Alluding to Father Wang docking his pocket money)</p>

    <p>3: My dearest father, we can't be apart for even a moment. Our family is like the Three Auspicious Treasures, although there are times my father's love is as stifling as Lord Laozi's immortal-binding rope <sup>1</sup> and stresses me out. (Alluding to Father Wang docking his pocket money)</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Referring to "Journey to the West..")</dfn>

    <p>Teacher Pan's eyes immediately turned red after she read this essay.</p>

    <p>She was practically sobbing as she said to Wang Ling, "Student Wang Ling, I understand, you can relax. It's already late; hurry on home."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't know whether Teacher Pan had correctly picked out his meaning, but he believed that there shouldn't be any problems since he had already written it so emotionally. Plus, he also secretly complained about Father Wang docking his pocket money.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>However, not long after Wang Ling returned home, Teacher Pan snapped a photo of his reflection and posted it in Number 60 High's teachers' group.</p>

    <p>[Number 60 High's Teachers' Administrative Group]</p>

    <p>Talismans - Teacher Pan: [Photo] Our class's Wang Ling wrote this. Everyone, have a look.</p>

    <p>PE - Teacher Ye: Ah? Teacher Pan, did you suspect that Student Wang Ling was being abused at home?</p>

    <p>Talismans - Teacher Pan: That's right, so I had him fill in the questionnaire. But from the questionnaire, it seems that Student Wang Ling has never been abused at home; he even left such a moving essay, which made me cry. This kid knows how to be grateful and knows that his parents don't have it easy - this is so rare. It's unfortunate that this is a private inquiry and this essay has to be kept confidential, otherwise I would share it publicly.</p>

    <p>PE - Teacher Ye: I finished reading it, it's well-written.</p>

    <p>History - Teacher Wang: Not bad, not bad. Such a high level of understanding and line of thinking - this is indeed a good kid. I teach Wang Ling and he's always well-behaved in class. No wonder Student Sun Rong likes him.</p>

    <p>School Doctor - Xiang Yiyun: I have a different opinion; I think Student Wang is hinting at something in the essay.</p>

    <p>All the teachers: ???</p>

    <p>School Doctor - Xiang Yiyun: Look, he compares his parents to candles and his father to a branch, and then brings up the immortal-binding rope at the end...</p>

    <p>Teacher Ye swiftly replied: Are you saying... wax play, whipping and bondage?</p>

    <p>School Doctor - Xiang Yiyun: [covers face] I didn't say that... I was just joking...</p>

    <p>Looking at the screen at that moment, Teacher Pan's relaxed expression tensed up once more.</p>

    <p>Was that a hint?</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan thought that it was possible.</p>
