  <h1>Chapter 208 The Old Devil's Invasion Plan </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue noticed that ever since the old devil had come into contact with modern technology, he seemed to have suddenly changed a lot. The Friends Circle <sup>1</sup> contained a lot of rumors, and the old devil, who had only just encountered modern technology, indeed lacked the ability to differentiate between them. As a result, the current old devil gave Jiang Liuyue the impression that she had an old father who believed everything in his phone's Friends Circle.</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue had always thought that astrology was exaggerated... but given the old devil's identity, she didn't dare contradict him.</p>

    <p>After a moment's silence, she could only change the topic. "Lord Devil Emperor, have you already made plans for that student military training which is coming up?"</p>

    <p>"Of course, I've already planned everything out." Inside the stone ghost mask, the old devil smiled coldly. "My venerable self checked online, and the last time the Gate Between Worlds descended was six years ago?"</p>

    <p>"That's right, Lord Devil Emperor," Jiang Liuyue answered pragmatically. "But not long after it descended, the demon army withdrew their troops for some unknown reason. The outside world has varying opinions on this past incident. However, there is a limit to how reliable current information is when it comes to the truth. The government claims that the demon emperor in the Gate Between Worlds was afraid of General Yi, and so decided to retreat."</p>

    <p>"That's impossible." The old devil's denial sounded straightaway from the stone ghost mask. "Yi Jianchuan and my venerable self have known each other for a very long time, and I am well aware of his capabilities. No matter how powerful he is, it's impossible that it was to the point of making the demon emperor of the Gate Between Worlds scared enough to retreat..."</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue was bewildered. "Lord Devil Emperor, why are you suddenly bringing up the Gate Between Worlds?"</p>

    <p>"Because this is also part of my grand plan to absorb vital essences."</p>

    <p>The old devil answered, "The full moon is in two days. My venerable self knows a magic array which can gather pure negative energy to summon the Gate Between Worlds. I'll use it as a cover, so when it descends on the world, that's when I'll carry out my plan."</p>

    <p>The old devil didn't want to reveal himself before returning to his full strength. If he summoned the Gate Between Worlds, it was only logical that the demon race from the Gate would be blamed for whatever happened after that.</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Jiang Liuyue completely understood; this was a plan to create a diversion.</p>

    <p>But would they be able to carry it out smoothly this time...</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue didn't dare raise a flag<sup>2</sup>, but in her heart she started to worry. </p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(To 'raise a flag' is to jinx something)</dfn>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was June 14th, the eighth Tuesday since the start of the semester.</p>

    <p>The day of the six schools' combined military training exercise had finally come.</p>

    <p>Students from the six schools of Peiyuan district would be gathering together, including students from four key high schools. The hype around this combined military training exercise thus wasn't small, and it drew a lot of attention.</p>

    <p>The chief commander responsible for leading the group this time was still Lao Gudong. When Wang Ling arrived at school in the morning, he saw dozens of buses lined up along the street outside the school gate.</p>

    <p>At the moment, Lao Gudong was still in the morning meeting with the teachers-in-charge, while students from each class queued at the school gate under the direction of their sports committee member.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High School's front gate still had that old stone sculpture with its indistinct features, those pitifully few palm trees, and a crowded front square. At the moment, there were more than three hundred students lined up at the gate.</p>

    <p>In the queue, Guo Hao looked around surreptitiously. "I heard that the military instructors who will be leading each class have already arrived at the school..."</p>

    <p>"Then where are they?" Su Xiao asked in a whisper.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Sun Rong just came back from Number 59 High School, and I imagine she would have gathered a lot of important data after several days on exchange. She might be sharing her intelligence at the teachers' morning meeting. I heard that those instructors went with Classmate Sun Rong to the meeting..."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao said, "I heard from one of my uncles that the instructors this time are gold-medal instructors whom Classmate Sun Rong invited using Huaguo Water Curtain Group's connections. Every one of them is supposedly a cultivator with a very high realm; they're also old soldiers who stood against the first wave of the demon race's invasion from the Gate Between Worlds in the past."</p>

    <p>"Are they that amazing?"</p>

    <p>"Also, they all share an important characteristic â€” every one of them is an experienced alchemist..." As soon as Guo Hao said this, it was as if Wang Ling could sense a hint of a familiar aura in the crowd, and for some reason, he suddenly had a bad feeling.</p>

    <p>As expected, a ray of light flashed toward them from a distance, and in an instant, Wang Ling saw a cool-looking figure drop down from the sky.</p>

    <p>It was a slender, handsome man with gray hair dressed in traditional attire...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When Immortal Toya appeared, his pose was just too cool, like that of an action movie star. Each movement dazzled the eye; even the way he dropped down from his flying sword was incomparably cool.</p>

    <p>Of course, cultivators with higher realms wouldn't have taken any notice of his movements. Nowadays, cultivators who made movies didn't need hanging wires; those who trained in physical skills would look cool no matter how they moved.</p>

    <p>However, in front of a group of Foundation Establishment high school students, Immortal Toya's beautiful movements along with his noble and attractive looks stirred up quite an uproar in the small square as soon as he appeared.</p>

    <p>Standing in the queue, Wang Ling was expressionless, his face as calm as an ancient well.</p>

    <p>But to be honest, he was feeling a little disturbed in his heart; he had completely never expected that the person who would be leading them would actually be Immortal Toya.</p>

    <p>This was enough to prove how much importance Headmaster Chen had attached to this combined military training exercise for six schools. To emerge victorious in the military training, forty percent of it would rely on an outstanding instructor. As for the remaining sixty percent, fifty percent relied on performance and ten percent on luck.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya in fact didn't come cheap. Just blithely accepting an anime cosplay event would earn him millions of yuan. If someone wanted him to customize an elixir for them, apart from the booking fee to make an appointment with him, they would also have to prepare at least one billion for the refinement of the elixir... this was how much an excellent alchemist cost.</p>

    <p>Even if the school had used Huaguo Water Curtain Group's connections to invite Immortal Toya to act as an instructor this time, Wang Ling thought they probably still had had to spend a huge amount of money behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>While he was thinking about this, Immortal Toya was already walking over to them. His snowy-white attire fluttered as he moved, revealing tantalising glimpses of his collarbone, and the girls nearby couldn't help getting nosebleeds.</p>

    <p>When he had landed in the small square, the young man completely hadn't sensed that his most respected Senior Ling was also in the crowd in queue.</p>

    <p>So, when the gray-haired young man approached Grade One, Class Three's queue and met Wang Ling's gaze for a split second, his mind instantly went blank.</p>

    <p>Ling... Ling Zhenren?</p>

    <p>What the hell?!</p>

    <p>Why would Ling Zhenren show up here?</p>
