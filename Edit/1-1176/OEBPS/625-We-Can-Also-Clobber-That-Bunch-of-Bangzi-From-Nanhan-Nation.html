  <h1>Chapter 625 We Can Also Clobber That Bunch of Bangzi From Nanhan Nation!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The design of this "Three Values-Shattering Hammer" was a little weird and avant garde, but since it was in <em>Eight Classes of Divine Weapons </em>, this was proof enough of how extraordinary this little hammer was. In addition, this type of limited use magic weapon often generated more extreme and terrifying bursts of explosive power than a permanent weapon.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling carefully examined the finished product and determined that its quality was quite remarkable. This Three Values-Shattering Hammer was a first-class holy weapon; however, Wang Ling reckoned that after he did some slight modifications, it would be capable of exhibiting power at a world-defying level.</p>

    <p>The flip-top section in the middle of the hammer wasn't a superfluous design, but was actually a recess into which energy could be poured. This was an important reason why Wang Ling had specially chosen this hammer as a defensive magic weapon for Immortal Zhenyuan, as he would be able to pour his "primordial qi" into this hammer.</p>

    <p>If the primordial qi which Wang Ming had detected on Drought Star truly belonged to a prehistoric vicious beast being reared by that mysterious angler, using spirit energy in battle would only end in disaster. Both primordial qi and spirit energy were energy sources, but spirit qi was nothing in the face of primordial qi.</p>

    <p>Although Immortal Zhenyuan's body could generate some primordial qi, his main energy source was still spirit energy, which Wang Ling had already confirmed in the fight against Wind Spirit on Drought Star the last time. In contrast, those unknown prehistoric vicious beasts could freely switch between energy sources depending on their environment, and could use primordial qi entirely as their main source of energy. If a showdown really happened, Immortal Zhenyuan definitely wouldn't be their match.</p>

    <p>The main thing still was that Wang Ling had no idea what that mysterious angler was planning, but it was good to be prepared, just in case.</p>

    <p>This Three Values-Shattering Hammer would be a great help to Immortal Zhenyuan.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised an eyebrow and filled the hammer full with primordial qi.</p>

    <p>When the energy reached a saturation point, Er Ha saw that the middle section of the hammer's head was swollen as if with air.</p>

    <p>"This hammer can be used ten times at most."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling gave the hammer to Er Ha and said telepathically, "You and Xiao Yin take this hammer to Drought Star together."</p>

    <p>Er Ha was blank and cocked its head. "Why him?"</p>

    <p>It was baffled by Wang Ling's words, and didn't understand his thinking.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling's heart was as clear as a mirror; in theory, holy beasts and these prehistoric vicious beasts were on the same level. The reason the prehistoric vicious beasts were called as such was because these vicious beasts had very low spiritual intelligence but were incomparably deadly. Holy beasts, on the other hand, just happened to be the opposite — they cultivated very slowly, but they were spiritually enlightened as soon as they were born.</p>

    <p>The characteristics of the prehistoric vicious beasts and the holy beasts were like a drawing of the Eight Trigrams <sup>1</sup> ; each had their own merits.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The fundamental principles of reality in Daoist cosmology, seen as a range of eight interrelated concepts.)</dfn>

    <p>The reason why Wang Ling wanted Xiao Yin to track down the prehistoric vicious beast had to do with this balance.</p>

    <p>Prehistoric vicious beasts were extremely sensitive to holy beast blood, so Xiao Yin's presence would be a strong deterrent.</p>

    <p>For another thing, Xiao Yin could take this opportunity to leave its holy beast blood on the prehistoric vicious beast and track it later.</p>

    <p>Holy beast blood wasn't an ordinary thing, and Xiao Yin could completely use it as a tracker. Wang Ling had already noticed this earlier on after Xiao Yin gave Er Ha his holy beast blood for a medicinal bath.</p>

    <p>Er Ha stared at this little hammer. "Are there any instructions?"</p>

    <p>"There are." Wang Ling flipped open <em>Eight Classes of Divine Weapons </em>again. The instructions for all the magic weapons were in the second half of the book, similar to how ancient records had a dictionary at the back with the words listed in alphabetical order.</p>

    <p>The reason why Wang Ling had chosen this magic weapon at the very beginning was because of its ability to store energy, but even he didn't know exactly how to use it.</p>

    <p>When master and servant turned to the page of instructions, they started to read up on the little hammer's specific functions.</p>

    <p>Written in the instructions:</p>

    <p><em>Eight Classes of Divine Weapons - Instructions from the weaponsmith developers of the "Three Views-Shattering Hammer"</em></p>

    <p><em>Instruction One: Design Purpose</em></p>

    <p><em>In an era where more and more permanent magic weapons are being designed, limited use magic weapons have been neglected. Under Passion Luo's guidance, our weaponsmith design team created this valiant limited use magic weapon, Three Views-Shattering Hammer. It can store massive amounts of spirit energy which can be used as reserves in battle against a powerful enemy. The hammer has formidable potential not found in permanent magic weapons; the product's biggest advantage is its explosive power and the number of times it can be used. When it's fully charged with energy, it can be used up to ten times, which far exceeds what a conventional limited use magic weapon is capable of.</em></p>

    <p><em>Instruction Two: Product Use (Magic design inspired by the famous humble master: Emperor Rang, Yan Junze <sup>2</sup> </em><em>)</em></p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(A well-known LOL player with the ID Letme. His nickname Emperor Rang ("rang" which means "to let") refers to how he's able to turn most top lane match-ups into an even match, even in losing match-ups.)</dfn>

    <p><em>1: Passive Effect "Forced Fairness"</em></p>

    <p><em>When the product is used for the first time, whoever wields the hammer automatically triggers the forced fairness effect. The more powerful the energy source, the greater its suppressive force, and the opponent becomes caught in a fair confrontation. Unable to demonstrate their true strength, they are thus easily defeated in a fight. During an attack, the enemy's magic is weakened several times over, thus incapacitating them and making the hammer's user seem even more destructive.</em></p>

    <p><em>2: Active Skill Effect "The Rang: All Living Things Are Equal" (This skill reduces the number of times the product can be used by one)</em></p>

    <p><em>The corresponding chant needs to be recited when using this product skill. When "The Rang: All Living Things Are Equal" effect is triggered, the level playing field will be forcefully expanded and enemies in the vicinity will enter an incapacitated state where their strength will be kept on the same level as that of the hammer's user, or even below that. At the same time, the light of "All Living Things Are Equal" will strongly impair the opponent's three views, causing them to lose the desire to attack.</em></p>

    <p><em>3: Active Skill Effect "The Rang: The Ultimate Hammer" (This skill reduces the number of times the product can be used by one)</em></p>

    <p><em>When "The Rang: The Ultimate Hammer" effect is triggered, the wielder of the hammer strikes the ground, toppling the three views of the opponent as well as forcefully entering a golden body state. In this state, all living things become silent and the hammer's user is completely immune to all physical and magical attacks for ten seconds (can be voluntarily lifted with a thought). When this skill is active, the light of the golden body emitted by the hammer's user can dispel their teammates' uncertainty and rashness, and force them to calm down in a Buddha-like manner before returning to their peak fighting strength.</em></p>

    <p><em>Summary of Instructions: This product was designed in heartfelt defiance of the current trend. During the initial design stage, our team of developers visited the "RNG team," the champions of that season's LOL tournament, and exclusively interviewed one of the team members, humble master Emperor Rang, Yan Junze. Ultimately, the product we designed was a magic treasure to commemorate RNG's victory - reality proved that we were capable of clobbering <sup>3</sup> </em><em>that bunch of bangzi from Nanhan nation!</em></p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(The term used in Chinese is 錘翻 which literally translates to "hammer flip," hence the design of the hammer ..)</dfn>
