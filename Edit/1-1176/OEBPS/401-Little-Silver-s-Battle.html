  <h1>Chapter 401 Xiao Yin's Battle </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Junior Brother Han thought that anyone who calmed down and used their brain to think it over would definitely realize that something was wrong. After all, it was indeed quite difficult to connect a third-class green-furred dog to a silver-haired young man, since spirit beasts in their human forms usually had something in common with their original bodies.</p>

    <p>But in this current situation, Junior Brother Han couldn't get a word in edgewise.</p>

    <p>It couldn't be helped... in addition to strength, the cultivation circle had always focused on seniority. Some old-timers just liked to direct from the top of the hill of "seniority," which made the juniors feel very helpless. These seniors who preferred to look at problems through their experience tended to be pedantic, dogmatic and stubborn.</p>

    <p>Although Junior Brother Han thought it was a trap, he indeed couldn't think of a reason to disagree with his senior brother, because the notion of transferring a spirit marker truly was a little fanciful... and it indeed couldn't happen in theory.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin stood on the empty construction site; he had already confirmed that there was no one else here.</p>

    <p>He could clearly sense the two cultivators from the Demon Hunters Association who had been tailing him standing outside the iron gates. One was at the Soul Formation stage and the other at the Nascent Soul stage.</p>

    <p>After scouting out their realms, Xiao Yin instantly felt deeply disappointed — they were so weak it was embarrassing!</p>

    <p>Generally speaking, in a situation with unequal realms, the most difficult thing to do was the legendary "show mercy," but apparently Xiao Yin didn't have to worry about this problem at all today... he recalled the instruction Lord Diulei had conveyed earlier, and that was to kill these two elders of the Demon Hunters Association without revealing his identity.</p>

    <p>This meant that he could exterminate them without worries.</p>

    <p>As for whether they could use these two elders to lead them back to the president of the Demon Hunters Association, that had nothing to do with Xiao Yin.</p>

    <p>So, how to kill these two in the most painful and wretched way possible?</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin narrowed his eyes and smiled slightly as he cupped his chin and pondered.</p>

    <p>News about the Demon Hunters Association had spread throughout the city in the last two days, so it was impossible that Xiao Yin didn't know what had happened. Besides, the reason why holy beasts had died out previously was due to the workings of organizations similar to the Demon Hunters Association which disregarded life for the sake of profit and viewed living things as mustard grass which they slaughtered indiscriminately.</p>

    <p>This type of people deserved to be put to death.</p>

    <p>While he was pondering, Xiao Yin's ears suddenly moved; a bright ball of light shot up into the sky like a firework outside the large iron gates.</p>

    <p>In the next moment, rays of light extended out of the ball and turned into hooks that lunged at him.</p>

    <p>"A trapper ball?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin could tell what this ball of light was with one glance.</p>

    <p>A trapper ball was a once-off magic treasure commonly used to capture spirit beasts. If it failed, then it would be nullified. Additionally, it was expressly stipulated by law that only qualified pet trainers were allowed to possess and use this type of magic treasure.</p>

    <p>"Tch, want to catch me with a trapper ball?" Xiao Yin's face was as unruffled as the surface of an ancient well and he wore a long-suffering expression as he blinked, his delicate eyelashes sweeping down. Without even waiting for those hooks to latch onto him, he directly stretched out his hand to catch the trapper ball.</p>

    <p>In the end, the old Taoist had barely sent out this trapper ball when Xiao Yin squashed it to death in the air before it could even do its thing.</p>

    <p>The light of the trapper ball vanished, signaling a failed capture.</p>

    <p>The two elders of the Demon Hunters Association had charged through the iron gates right after releasing the trapper ball, but Xiao Yin had really been too quick. As soon as they landed, they saw that the ball was already in the silver-haired youth's hands.</p>

    <p>"What a spicy chicken <sup>1</sup> ..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(''Spicy chicken" is 'la ji' in Chinese, which is also a homonym for "trash .. ")</dfn>

    <p>Xiao Yin sighed in his heart and directly crushed that trapper ball into powder.</p>

    <p>The old Taoist was utterly stunned. "Impossible!"</p>

    <p>This trapper ball was the best of its kind, and even had an eighty-five percent success rate of capturing a second-class spirit beast.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin curled his lip and didn't say anything.</p>

    <p>Want to catch him with a trash ball... where did they get their confidence?</p>

    <p>The old Taoist stared at Xiao Yin. "Very well, you green dog, it appears you do have some skill."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "Why am I a dog???"</p>

    <p>The old Taoist: "Hmph! Don't think you can pass yourself off as a first-class spirit beast just by eating pills that can turn you into a human being... This old man is sharp, I saw through it already earlier on!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>Watching this scene from the side, this Junior Brother Han nearby was greatly shaken; for the young man to be able to catch the trapper ball so easily, it was already clear that he had an unusual identity.</p>

    <p>"Senior brother, I think there's something odd about this person. How about we withdraw before we make a decision?"</p>

    <p>The junior brother had good intentions in giving this reminder, but the old Taoist wasn't willing to listen. "Again! This time, I'll make sure he can't avoid it!"</p>

    <p>As he spoke, the old Taoist performed some hand seals and launched another ball of light from his hand.</p>

    <p>"There's no way I won't catch you this time!" The old Taoist smiled sardonically. This was an updated version of the previous trapper ball. It wasn't just faster and had a higher success rate of capture; more importantly, it had an "invisibility" effect.</p>

    <p>This ball was obviously part of the old Taoist's collection, and he wouldn't use it so casually unless the situation was critical. The price of an ordinary trapper ball was a thousand immortal gold bars. As for this collector's item, Xiao Yin was guessing that it probably cost over ten thousand immortal gold bars.</p>

    <p>Catching spirit beasts was also a game that burned money.</p>

    <p>However, outside of the old Taoist's expectations, it wasn't even half a second after he had released the ball when this silver-haired youth actually caught it again.</p>

    <p>The old Taoist was so alarmed he took one step back. "You..."</p>

    <p>"Don't you have other techniques?" Xiao Yin looked at him with some disappointment.</p>

    <p>This was definitely the least aspiring Soul Formation cultivator that Xiao Yin had ever seen. Relying on a once-off magic treasure and burning money in a fight was, in Xiao Yin's opinion, extremely hopeless behavior!</p>

    <p>"Impossible! You're just a spirit beast! There's no other magic treasure more effective than a trapper ball for dealing with a spirit beast!" The old Taoist was so furious that he was trembling all over. "Junior brother! Take out our trump card!"</p>

    <p>"Senior Brother Canglan..."</p>

    <p>"I'll take responsibility for the loss!"</p>

    <p>The old Taoist snarled; things had already come to this point, and he knew there was no turning back.</p>

    <p>Then, the junior brother next to him helplessly took a trapper ball studded with crystals out of their storage bag. This was their last trump card. This trapper ball was also the most advanced of its kind — the master ball! It had a success rate as high as one hundred percent at capturing a first-class spirit beast!</p>

    <p>"Go! Master ball!" the old Taoist roared!</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>A brilliant light burst forth from the master ball.</p>

    <p>Then, with a sigh, Xiao Yin reached out again to choke this ball of light to death in the air...</p>

    <p>"No way... that's impossible!" The old Taoist widened his eyes. This master ball was already their last and most powerful trump card! It had a success rate as high as one hundred percent at capturing a spirit beast - how could it be blocked so offhandedly?</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin held the master ball between two fingers, and the corners of his mouth couldn't help twitching.</p>

    <p>Indeed...</p>

    <p>This master ball was very strong and very rare.</p>

    <p>Even when it was used to catch a first-class spirit beast, its success rate was as high as one hundred percent.</p>

    <p>However, the problem was that he was a holy beast...</p>
