  <h1>Chapter 1015 Punishment by Ordeal</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The basement of the cultivation department store was a food street. Mother Wang chose a chain restaurant that looked reasonably clean and tidy and ordered a table of dishes. This wasn't Mother Wang flaunting her wealth - she really was starving!! She had also experienced this when she was pregnant with Wang Ling: she would eat a lot and crave spicy food in particular.</p>

    <p>"Don't be shy." Mother Wang smiled at Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi, and then started eating. Wang Ling ordered a glass of lemonade and then watched Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi fall on the food like starving wolves. They were more prone to hunger because of the restrictions on their magical powers. It was because of this that Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi had been hungry since coming back from the Palace of Mirrors the day before yesterday.</p>

    <p>Looking at Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi's situation, Wang Ling realized that Gu Shunzhi truly was incorruptible - as a keeper of cosmic order, he could be this ruthless even toward his fellow countrymen.</p>

    <p>It was going to be like this for two years. This was just punishment by ordeal - even a mortal cultivating to become immortal wouldn't be this wretched!</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling remembered that Number 60 High's first extension should be completed by the end of the summer break. The first round of building investments from Sun Rong's Huaguo Water Curtain Group had already come in, and a student dormitory would have been built behind Number 60 High's sports field. This was a typical feature of a key city school, and since Number 60 High wanted to be upgraded to a key city school, a school building for accommodation was a must.</p>

    <p>That was to say, Wang Zhen's and Liu Qingyi's lives would become a little easier after the summer vacation, so they wouldn't need to consider the problem of renting an apartment anymore. It was Gu Shunzhi who had set up their identities on Earth, and who had gotten them into Number 60 High to study; a cheap place for shelter was better than renting an apartment in such a big city.</p>

    <p>It was really hard to believe that two children from rich families in the Domain of the Gods had to live like this after coming to Earth.</p>

    <p>Was this an X-Change <sup>1</sup> in the cultivation world?</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>("X-Change" is a Chinese
documentary series in which
kids switch families for 7
days ..)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling suddenly felt it was interesting.</p>

    <p>"Are you in trouble?" Like most middle-aged women, Mother Wang liked to chat with others while eating. Most importantly, Wang Ling realized that when Mother Wang talked to people, she could always get to the point. This had a lot to do with her experiences in life and her writing.</p>

    <p>Mother Wang had read many stories before she quit writing.</p>

    <p>When they heard Mother Wang's words, Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi looked depressed.</p>

    <p>It could only be said, as expected of a great senior from that villa.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, Ling Zhenren's biological mother was amazing.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi had high cultivation, they still lacked experience compared with Mother Wang. Profound cultivation was useless - they hadn't struggled enough in society. Hundreds of years would sometimes go by when cultivators went into seclusion, and they couldn't keep up with the news at all.</p>

    <p>Children like them from rich families in the Domain of the Gods grew up surrounded by their families. In a society that worshipped money, they were muggles without it... Thus, Gu Shunzhi had put a lot of thought into placing them on Earth to temper them.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi was from a de facto imperial family in the Domain of the Gods, but unlike Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi, he was also a keeper of order on top of that. He, who worked hard to maintain order everywhere in the universe, was a lot more mature than Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi.</p>

    <p>"We're looking for jobs, but no one wants us..." Wang Zhen made a pained sound.</p>

    <p>A Foundation Establishment cultivator could consider delivering takeout or parcels on a flying sword.</p>

    <p>But the problem was that according to the Earth IDs which Gu Shunzhi had given them, they were still in high school!! They were minors!! Like Wang Ling, they were only sixteen years old! No workplace dared hire them... Plus, they didn't know where to go to look for a job...</p>

    <p>It would have been fine if they weren't on record as high school students.</p>

    <p>But the problem was that they were now high school students registered with the General Administration of 100 Cultivation Schools. As long as their profiles showed up in a search of the online student registry, even a small enterprise wouldn't hire them.</p>

    <p>"What about Little Lei?" Mother Wang thought of Lord Diulei. "He should be able to help you."</p>

    <p>"But he doesn't pay us... We want to improve our lives..." As a little princess, Liu Qingyi felt aggrieved from the bottom of her heart. She never imagined that there would be a day when she would end up like this with Wang Zhen. Not only was he her fianc√© on paper in the Domain of the Gods, he was also the person she hated the most!!!</p>

    <p>And because of a misunderstanding, she and this trash had come to the world below to escape marriage; in the end, they were discovered by Gu Shunzhi, who had sentenced them on the spot.</p>

    <p>It would be two years before they could return to the Domain of the Gods...</p>

    <p>Reasonably speaking, two years wasn't long for cultivators used to going into seclusion, but Liu Qingyi and Wang Zhen now felt like time was crawling by.</p>

    <p>In their seclusion rooms in the world above, they had WIFI and air conditioning, and didn't have to worry about food or clothing - now, even housing was a problem for them in the world below.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi had no one to blame but themselves.</p>

    <p>For second generation individuals used to comfortable lives in the Domain of the Gods, it was likely impossible for them to bow their heads and live on someone else's charity. Thunder was a warmhearted person and would certainly be willing to help them, but there weren't any other options if they wouldn't accept it.</p>

    <p>Mother Wang turned to look at Wang Ling. "Ling Ling, they're your classmates. Why don't you think of something?"</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi and Wang Zhen perked up instantly.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen: "I can be your underling!!"</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi: "I can be your hired muscle! I'll even warm your bed!!"</p>

    <p>Mother Wang: "Miss, calm down..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>The two of them weren't willing to rely on someone else, but if the other party was Wang Ling, they were convinced one hundred percent. To be able to follow the big boss was a blessing!</p>

    <p>He might reward them with crispy noodle snack packets, and they would rise by leaps and bounds!</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling really had thought of a job.</p>

    <p>It was work that had no age restrictions, nor was it dependent on realm. It didn't matter that they were students. Besides, given Wang Zhen's and Liu Qingyi's talents, they were absolutely qualified for this job.</p>

    <p>So that night, Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi received new assignments.</p>

    <p>Er Ha took Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi to the family apartment.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi was already waiting for them at the entrance.</p>

    <p>He was topless and wore a large pair of pants. There was a sea salt popsicle in his mouth, and a Pushing Large Butterfly rested on his shoulder.</p>

    <p>Seeing that Er Ha had arrived, Wei Zhi immediately waved excitedly. "Brother Dog!"</p>

    <p>"Mm, as I mentioned on the phone, I'll leave these two to you," Er Ha said. Its job was done.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi said hello to Wei Zhi.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi smiled and said, "From now on, you'll be taking care of spirit beasts with me. Starting as junior pet trainers, you'll be paid six thousand each during the probation period; taking out the rent, it's three thousand yuan. If you work long enough, your pay will increase. Senior pet trainers can earn tens or even hundreds of thousands of yuan a month. If you work hard, you'll definitely be able to make a living for yourselves."</p>

    <p>"Then we will have to trouble you!" Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi accepted gladly.</p>

    <p>To be able to rely on themselves to earn a living meant that they wouldn't need to rely on others.</p>

    <p>Besides, it was Wang Ling who had arranged this job for them, which made it more tolerable.</p>
