  <h1>Chapter 144 The Obsessiveness of a Scapegoat! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Zhuo Yi had never imagined that he would meet Wang Ling here. After he had received a phone call from his subordinate, he had gone down right away.</p>

    <p>"Mr Zhuo, these are the two men who damaged your car and refuse to pay for it. Don't you think they're going too far? Do you want me to call the law..." The man in sunglasses was about to ask whether he should call the lawyer, but before he could finish speaking, he realized that Zhuo Yi's eyes were shooting daggers at him.</p>

    <p>This scenario was a tad off!</p>

    <p>A few drops of sweat rolled down the face of the man in sunglasses. "..."</p>

    <p>"Do you know who this person is?" Zhuo Yi pointed at Wang Ling. "He is my<em>shifu </em>! So what if <em>shifu </em>damaged it? He just gave it a love tap!"</p>

    <p>The man in sunglasses: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Face full of excitement, Zhuo Yi went forward and held Wang Ling's hands. "<em>Shifu </em>, this disciple has been hoping day and night, and finally I get to see you!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling knew he was being thoroughly coerced by Zhuo Yi. There were plenty of old ladies who committed pengci these days, but for Zhuo Yi to pengci him into becoming his <em>shifu </em>was truly novel and gracefully done.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had heard a story not long ago about a little girl who had bumped into an old lady on her way to school. The girl had kindly helped her up, but the old lady had stubbornly insisted that the little girl compensate her... at that moment, the little girl had calmly stood up, slapped the old lady and said, "I'm underage, anyway!" before she left...</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Ling in fact really wanted to emulate the little girl.</p>

    <p>Hm... he was only sixteen years old, so technically he was also underage!</p>

    <p>However, this guy would definitely die with one slap from him.</p>

    <p>"I've long heard of Mr Zhuo, but I never thought you would actually be Brother Ling's disciple." Lord Diulei clasped his fists in salute as he tried to defuse the awkwardness of the situation.</p>

    <p>"This senior is..."</p>

    <p>"I am Lei Mouren, my Tao name is Lord Diulei." Lord Diulei clasped his fists in greeting at Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>"Senior is Lord Diulei!" Zhuo Yi was instantly excited. This was the legendary Great Death-Courting Senior! If it hadn't been for the current situation, Zhuo Yi would have knelt to worship this boss...</p>

    <p>"I've heard so much about Senior Immortal, I never thought I would meet you here today."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei rubbed his head a little self-consciously. "Am I so well-known? Where did Mr Zhuo hear of me?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi thought for a bit, then immediately answered, " <em>Cultivation Story-telling Session </em>, <em>Bosom Friend of Five Hundred Years </em><sup>1 </sup>!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(These are adapted from the
titles of popular Chinese
magazines.)</dfn>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Why is Mr Zhuo here today?"</p>

    <p>At this, Zhuo Yi looked around cautiously, then pointed at Number 2 Hospital Building next to "Nightshift Nurses" and said in a very low voice, "I'm here on behalf of our General Administration of 100 Schools to visit an old leader: the former chief of the Cultivation Police, Old Chief Chen."</p>

    <p>Then he pointed to his own head and shook it.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Is there something wrong with his brain?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi and the man in sunglasses: "..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "...It's dementia."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised his eyelids slightly; not long ago, the old man's dementia had been treated with much difficulty, and he had never expected to encounter another case today. Sure enough, mental illness was truly a difficult problem for both cultivators and ordinary people! The fact of the matter was that it just couldn't be cured with medicine...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei gave Number 2 Hospital Building a look and frowned deeply. "I've met this Old Chief Chen before. Two years ago, in a move to uphold the rights of the laborers at Wind Factory <sup>2</sup> , he stormed the factory alone and flipped a dozen or so excavators over."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(The Wind Factory is taken
from the Chinese TV series 'In
the Name of the People.')</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"I've always felt that Old Chief Chen and I actually have quite similar temperaments," Lord Diulei said. "I'll ask Brother Toya later if he has any special treatment methods you could try."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Zhuo Yi immediately bowed. "On behalf of Old Chief Chen, I thank Senior Immortal for your help!"</p>

    <p>"Don't worry about it, it's not a big deal." Lord Diulei smiled slightly.</p>

    <p>Today, Zhuo Yi felt that his luck was through the roof. He had unexpectedly met the two seniors whom he had admired for a long time all at once. However, he also realized that when these two great living beings were actually standing in front of him, he didn't have the courage to even open his mouth and ask for their WeChat IDs!</p>

    <p><em>I've only just met them, I can't make a fuss about wanting to add them on WeChat...</em></p>

    <p><em>What if seniors think I'm being disrespectful and I give them a bad impression?</em></p>

    <p><em>What if seniors refuse my request, how embarrassing would that be?</em></p>

    <p><em>What if seniors don't use WeChat, then wouldn't this be too impudent?</em></p>

    <p><em>What if...</em></p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi struggled in his heart for an instant.</p>

    <p>At that moment, the sound of sirens could be heard outside the hospital, and four police cars drove into the parking lot to immediately surround them.</p>

    <p>The chief security guard knew Zhuo Yi's identity, so he pushed through a gap to approach Zhuo Yi and explain the current situation to him.</p>

    <p>It was still about the matter of the little tricycle chasing the Maybach.</p>

    <p>The chief security guard heard that the tricycle had flown past the Maybach on the motorway at a super fast speed... the traffic police team had then checked traffic camera footage before tracking the tricycle down here.</p>

    <p>"It looks like they have a bone to pick with us, Brother Ling."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei's eyes were as calm as water. A mere handful of police officers couldn't scare him at all!</p>

    <p>Though he wasn't afraid, the incident was indeed very troublesome.</p>

    <p>In a lawful cultivation society, not everything could be settled with just one's realm. When it came to the violation of traffic rules, whether it was immortal swords or cars, even Soul Formation cultivators would still get demerits, and the ones who should go to jail went to jail... Lord Diulei was very famous in online cultivation circles, but that wouldn't move these police uncles.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was also feeling very jittery.</p>

    <p>"Sheep," the little tricycle, was like a small child, and her temperament was a little volatile. Sometimes when she was being naughty, she couldn't be controlled at all.</p>

    <p>Looking at this bunch of traffic police officers yelling at them, Wang Ling was instantly a little anxious.</p>

    <p>In contrast, next to them, Zhuo Yi's eyes lit up! — The opportunity to showcase himself had come!</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi asked, "Are <em>shifu </em>and senior worried about this incident?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Can you handle it?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi gave them a thumbs-up: "It's just a bunch of police uncles! It's a piece of cake! Watch my performance, senior!"</p>

    <p>Just then, the traffic police captain who had been on the motorway had already gotten out of the police car, and with an aggressive " <em>pa </em>," he slammed the door shut.</p>

    <p>With a few police officers trailing behind him, he immediately found the tricycle suspected of speeding, then swept his gaze over the people around him. "Whose cart is this?"</p>

    <p>Under Zhuo Yi's stare, the man in sunglasses completely didn't dare to speak. "..."</p>

    <p>"It's mine!"</p>

    <p>Then, in the next moment, Zhuo Yi held his head high and stepped forward!</p>

    <p>At that moment, both Wang Ling and Lord Diulei could sense the brilliant divine light which radiated from Zhuo Yi's being!</p>

    <p>Not only could he carry a white wok, he could also carry a black wok...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought that this was probably the obsessiveness of a scapegoat <sup>3</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(背锅侠 literally translates
into 'a knight who carries a
black wok on his back.'
While we've translated it as
'scapegoat' here, the phrase
in Chinese tends to be used
in a more humorous than
negative way to describe someone who 'heroically' takes the blame for something.)</dfn>
