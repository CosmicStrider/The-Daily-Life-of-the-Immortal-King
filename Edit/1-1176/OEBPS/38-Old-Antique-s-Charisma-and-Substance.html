  <h1>Chapter 38 Lao Gudong's Charisma and Substance </h1>

  <div>

      <p>In the student exchange meet between the two schools, interaction between the students was certainly a part of it, but discussion among teachers was also important.</p>

      <p>Before eight o'clock in the morning, Lao Gudong, as the teacher leading the team from Number 60 High School, was dragged to a meeting.</p>

      <p>Looking around the meeting venue, there wasn't a single teacher that he knew. From the murmurs in the air, he could vaguely hear the other teachers talking about him. They were saying he was just some bookworm who taught the theory of history course, who had no skill apart from teaching and so on...</p>

      <p>In fact, whether he was a teacher now or a student back then, those students who specialized in flying swords or Dao talismans always looked down on the students who learned theory of history.</p>

      <p>Even though Lao Gudong was now a teacher, the teachers who taught the flying swords and Dao talismans courses similarly looked down on the teachers who taught history, and always felt that these people were very dull, and didn't have real talent or learning.</p>

      <p>Privately, he had always viewed these discriminatory stances as "stereotypes."</p>

      <p>He couldn't help recalling his time as a student.</p>

      <p>He was no stranger to gossip or slander, so even if he was hearing it again now, his expression was very calm. He just sighed at how time had flown by, and he would never be able to return to his salad days.</p>

      <p>The topic of discussion at the morning meeting for the teachers of both schools was naturally the hotly debated dissolution of one branch of the Pengci Gang reported in the morning newspaper.</p>

      <p>This was a very big issue because the Peiyuan district branch of the Pengci Gang, which had always caused the local cultivation police so many problems, had now collapsed in one night. One person told ten, ten told a hundred, and soon all the students and teachers knew about it.</p>

      <p>"Teachers, settle down! We're going to officially start the meeting now."</p>

      <p>The teacher chairing the meeting was Number 59 High School's Director Xie. "Looking at your heated discussion, I'm sure everyone has heard. This incident happened very suddenly. Although currently there are still a few pengci groups in Peiyuan district that are taking advantage of the situation to cause mischief, we now no longer have to worry about students going out and encountering pengci. The focus of this meeting, which is also the first thing the General Administration of 100 Schools passed down to us as soon as this incident happened, is mainly to listen to your opinions on Madam Dong's reorganization of the dissolved Pengci Gang in our district into the 'General Administration of Harmony.'"</p>

      <p>Director Xie's words stirred up heated discussion again, as the teachers whispered to one another with unusual fervor.</p>

      <p>Director Xie then noticed Lao Gudong, and saw this theory of history teacher from another school looking especially serene as he quietly listened to the other teachers' opinions, nodding his head and smiling gently... for some reason, this made Director Xie's face burn hotly.</p>

      <p>Some approved of the General Administration of Harmony, and felt that it would be a beneficial existence; one male teacher nodded. "The Pengci Gang indeed committed a lot of crimes in the past, disrupting society and civil harmony, as well as causing teachers and students in the surrounding areas to suffer disastrous financial losses. But now that it has been reorganized into the General Administration of Harmony, and specializes in dealing with the Pengci Gang and supervising the delinquents in society, I think this is good!"</p>

      <p>A female teacher snorted as she objected. "How is it good! It's just another way to harass people. When I was on the way to work this morning, an old lady told me off for running a yellow light, and stopped me to lecture me for a long time, until my spirit sword ran out of electricity, almost making me late for work!"</p>

      <p>A female teacher next to her was immediately startled. "Teacher Lin's spirit sword... runs on electricity?"</p>

      <p>"That's right! Lately I've been up until late every night doing my marking, so I really don't have any energy. My new Chanel electric-powered spirit sword is good, it saves me a lot of spirit energy, so I can go to work in high spirits every day!"</p>

      <p>The female teacher proudly stroked her hair, then held out one palm. "The most important thing is to charge it for five minutes, it'll power the sword for two hours! I strongly recommend it to everyone!"</p>

      <p>"Really? That's too awesome! Where did you buy it from?"</p>

      <p>"You can buy it at Tianmiao and Jingxi <sup>1</sup> !"</p>

      <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Tianmao (TMALL) and Jingxi (now known as Jingdong(JD)) are Chinese e-commerce websites.)</dfn>

      <p>"Is it very expensive?"</p>

      <p>"With Tianmiao you can buy on credit, with Jingxi you can use IOUs! All these things are very useful!"</p>

      <p>"..." Director Xie's face instantly turned black.</p>

      <p>This bunch of people... they were actually so careless and unruly in the presence of outsiders at a meeting! What kind of image was this?!</p>

      <p>Director Xie Huaichun secretly glanced at Lao Gudong, who seemed like someone already accustomed to the gales and billows of life. She couldn't help the corners of her mouth curling up.</p>

      <p>Fortunately, this teacher from another school hadn't said anything. Otherwise, it really would be an embarrassment!</p>

      <p>Trying hard to control her anger, Director Xie reminded them in a low voice. "...Please pay attention, teachers. Don't stray from the point... this is a direct order from the General Administration of 100 Schools, I hope everyone will take it seriously."</p>

      <p>The director still had authority — at Director Xie's words, a few of the boisterous female teachers suddenly quieted down. At the same time, they gave Lao Gudong a grateful look.</p>

      <p>It was only when teachers from other schools were present that Director Xie would speak so evenly. If it had been a normal meeting, she would have already unleashed her prehistoric powers <sup>2</sup> early on, radiating intimidating pressure all around.</p>

      <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is a Chinese Internet meme based on swimmer Fu Yuanhui's comment in an interview, when she exaggeratedly told the reporter that she had used her 'prehistoric powers' after achieving a personal best in the pool at the Rio Olympics in 2016.)</dfn>

      <p>Before Wang Ling had set foot in Number 59 High School, the thing that had been most vulnerable to damage in the school was the table in the Teachers' Meeting Room. Every time Director Xie got so pissed off that she couldn't control her immense pressure in a meeting, a table leg would definitely be broken.</p>

      <p>This long rectangular table in front of Lao Gudong now had arrived just two days ago.</p>

      <p>Seeing that things had calmed down, Director Xie secretly sighed.</p>

      <p>She felt a sense of dread whenever she thought of the chaotic student exchange meeting which Tang Jingze had presided over yesterday.</p>

      <p>Fortunately, however, not everyone could have a magnetic field like Sun Rong's.</p>

      <p>Additionally, Lao Gudong couldn't imitate that National School Beauty level of electromagnetic attraction.</p>

      <p>However, Wang Ling had always felt that for a fatty, Lao Gudong had his own personal charisma.</p>

      <p>Before Lao Gudong came to Number 59 High School, Director Xie had thoroughly investigated this fatty — he had been teaching in Number 60 High School for over a decade, and was the teacher with the best reviews every year. Apart from his abiding gentleness, anytime and anywhere, in front of and behind people... she just couldn't understood why the students were so drawn to him.</p>

      <p>In fact, the main reason was his deft ability to switch between his two personas.</p>

      <p>Usually, he would start out in "gossip mode" in front of the students, and liked to maintain an approachable, kindly and teasing persona. However, that didn't mean that he was inherently an aloof person... for example, at this teachers' regular meeting, he had started out in his second persona, "artsy mode."</p>

      <p>What was an artsy youth?</p>

      <p>He would say something inexplicable, do something indescribable, be indifferent to people and speak reason very briefly... at first, it would seem like nothing, but after mulling it over, one would instantly feel it made a hell of a lot of sense!</p>

      <p>To be honest, Wang Ling actually liked Lao Gudong's second persona more, because he could always learn plenty of quotable words from it.</p>

      <p>However, this sharply different side usually didn't come out very often.</p>

      <p>Hence, the moment Lao Gudong had gotten up early to leave the school dormitory, Wang Ling had been secretly observing him using his Heavenly Eye...</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>It was very obvious that after Director Xie had rectified the teachers' behavior, the focus of the whole meeting shifted to this teacher from another school, Lao Gudong.</p>

      <p>The meeting venue was quiet, and no one dared to speak.</p>

      <p>The early morning breeze blew gently through the window, sweeping over Lao Gudong's watermelon head and brushing the neat fringe on his forehead...</p>

      <p>Director Xie stared blankly for a bit; unexpectedly, she felt that this fatty was somehow still very handsome in a certain sense...</p>

      <p>Lao Gudong gazed fixedly at the polished tabletop, which happened to reflect Director Xie's image.</p>

      <p>At this scene, Director Xie couldn't remain composed: why is he staring at my reflection? Don't tell me... he's interested in me? Likes me? Otherwise, why is he staring at me?</p>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p>Lao Gudong was looking blankly at the table; Wang Ling didn't even have the strength to be mocking. This was clearly out of respect! Who would stare non-stop at someone else's face at a meeting? How rude would that be?!</p>

      <p>Faced with this Director Xie Huaichun, Wang Ling's mood now was very complicated, because this evidently was another old girl in love making up her own scenarios...</p>

      <p>...Wait!</p>

      <p>Why did he think... another?</p>

      <p>Lao Gudong had always been the type of person whose appearance could withstand scrutiny, and he was the type who looked more handsome with every additional glance. This was what Wang Ling meant by his charisma and substance.</p>

      <p>Who understood substance? The substance of artsy youths... how could common people understand? His substance also wasn't something Sun Rong could imitate — their strategies were different. The target of Sun Rong's strategy was passersby, the target of Lao Gudong's strategy... was aunties.</p>

      <p>Then.</p>

      <p>Five minutes passed...</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>Director Xie still hadn't asked any questions, and only felt her face grow even hotter when she looked at Lao Gudong. She was just like her name <sup>3</sup> , truly like a maiden in search of love.</p>

      <dfn><sup>3</sup>(The pinyin in Director Xie's name Huaichun translates to "longing for love.")</dfn>

      <p>Lao Gudong had already been gazing at the tabletop for quite a long time, which made her blush with complete shyness... this was the first time that she had been stared at by a man for so long.</p>

      <p>And just like this, everyone followed Director Xie and looked at Lao Gudong quietly. Some of the sharp-eyed female teachers wondered why Director Xie's face seemed a little red...</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>Ten minutes passed...</p>

      <p>There was still no sound; one could have heard a pin drop in the whole meeting room.</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>Then once again.</p>

      <p>Twenty minutes passed...</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

      <p>Lao Gudong's hair was still fluttering wildly in the breeze. With soft, tender eyes, he looked at Director Xie. "Director Xie, is there something you want to ask me?"</p>

      <p>She was immediately startled by his slightly magnetic tone. Only then did she realize... she actually hadn't asked Lao Gudong any questions yet!</p>

      <p>Director Xie immediately couldn't help her face turning red as she showed the bashful expression of an old girl. "Ah~ Lao Gudong, I'm really sorry..."</p>

      <p>All the teachers were stunned...</p>

      <p>What had they just seen?</p>

      <p>What had they just heard?</p>

      <p>What the heck was with this breathless "ah" sound?</p>

      <p>This middle-aged spinster with a long career, who was experienced in dealing calmly with all types of situations, had actually apologized?! And even blushed?!</p>

      <p>Furthermore, her infatuated and enchanted expression was for a fatty who taught history... what the bloody hell?! Was this love at first sight? This fucking plot development was a little incomprehensible!</p>

      <p>Wang Ling was already stupefied. "..."</p>

      <p>He could only say, Lao Gudong really was Lao Gudong... this wasn't Blooddrop Cave <sup>4</sup> , but just like this, Lao Gudong had unexpectedly cracked the toughest nut at Number 59 High School...</p>

      <dfn><sup>4</sup>(In the famous Chinese novel 'Zhu Xian,' Blooddrop Cave is where the protagonists Zhang Xiaofan and Bi Yao fell in love with each other.)</dfn>

      <p>Lao Gudong calmly nodded, still maintaining the cool air of an artsy youth.</p>

      <p>Now, he felt that the time was completely ripe.</p>

      <p>The current scene was slightly awkward, and it was time for the artsy youth to come to the rescue...</p>

      <p>Turning his head slightly, Lao Gudong slanted a gaze out the window.</p>

      <p>In that cool, penetrating breeze, the words he said then shook everyone's hearts.</p>

      <p>"Today's wind is truly dazzling..."</p>

      <p>In the meeting room, the teachers got goosebumps all over.</p>

      <p>Apart from Lao Gudong and Director Xie, who were enchanted by the artsy atmosphere, the other teachers acutely felt the already cold temperature in the meeting room drop even further...</p>
