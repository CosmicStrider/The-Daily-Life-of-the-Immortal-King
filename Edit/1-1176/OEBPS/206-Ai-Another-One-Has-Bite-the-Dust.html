  <h1>Chapter 206 Ai, Another One Has Bite the Dust... </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that it had really been dangerous, and he had arrived just in time. If he had been several seconds late, the scene which his Heavenly Eye had predicted would have instantly come true, and Lord Diulei would have collapsed in a large puddle of ketchup.</p>

    <p>Now that he had seized the spirit sword Abyss Avoidance, which was contracted to the young man from Immortal Mansion, Wang Ling only needed a rough sense of this magic sword's strength to immediately realize that this wasn't just any ordinary sword.</p>

    <p>In terms of overall battle ability, this magic sword was more powerful than the old devil's dagger which Wang Ling had crushed two days ago. Furthermore, this sword could truly move astonishingly fast.</p>

    <p>Previously, when Wang Ling had caught that old devil's ancient magic sword barehanded, he hadn't had to use his Heavenly Eye to track its trajectory; this time, however, he had needed to open it.</p>

    <p>There was no doubt that the Golden Flash lived up to its name; any sword that could be included in the historical cultivation list of swords would be far from ordinary.</p>

    <p>What was regretful was that this time, it had encountered Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>This battle had unexpectedly become a major upset; the woman he had sworn to bring back with him had run away, and even his spirit sword had been seized... at that moment, the young man from Immortal Mansion looked a little discouraged.</p>

    <p>He pushed back the hood of his cloak to reveal short, bright red hair. His forehead was beaded with sweat, and he looked a little worn out.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Lord Diulei both noticed that in the middle of this young man's forehead, there was a red dot the size of a rice grain.</p>

    <p>They instantly realized that this young man had signed a spirit contract. This was a method used by ancient sects to control their disciples by binding their souls to prevent them from ever betraying their sects.</p>

    <p>This method in fact still existed now, but when light sects accepted disciples now, to safeguard their legitimacy, they signed a sect contract that was only binding for fifty years; they would never use their disciples' souls to threaten them.</p>

    <p>Thus, establishing a spirit contract was actually illegal now.</p>

    <p>However, this was what the dark forces practiced.</p>

    <p>In order to crack down on dark forces operating illegally, Huaxiu nation had time and time again over the years channeled all their efforts and strength into wiping out pornography and drug-trafficking. But each time a dark force was reported on the news as having been dismantled by the government, it was actually just a small-scale operation. What was more, the dark force wouldn't have even been considered a prefecture-level sect back then; at the most, it would have just been a small gang organization.</p>

    <p>But after several confrontations with Immortal Mansion, Lord Diulei this time had a bad feeling that this dark force was definitely a big fish, and was likely involved in a lot of shady interests and despicable dealings behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling fixed his eyes on the young man. Although the former didn't make a move, this atmosphere made the young man nervous. To easily neutralize his fifty-fold crescent sword qi and even catch his Golden Flash... this was enough to prove that he and this teenager in the big white bunny pajamas were at completely different realm levels.</p>

    <p>The young man drew back into the golden circle which he had marked out earlier and backed up against that hawthorn tree. He glared daggers at Wang Ling and smiled provokingly. "Even if you've stolen Abyss Avoidance, you won't have its heart! It's ranked number one as the fastest sword, and it's also extremely loyal! It would rather self-destruct than ever betray its owner!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded to himself. Without even the need for a hand seal, he just called out softly in his heart, and a brown spirit light instantly glowed in his hand.</p>

    <p>Then, as the spirit light subsided, it took the form of a brown spirit sword.</p>

    <p>The young man from Immortal Mansion squinted for a better look.</p>

    <p>He was then stunned by what he saw — this was such a powerful teenager, but his sword was actually a peach wood sword?</p>

    <p>Without a word, Wang Ling placed Jingke over Abyss Avoidance.</p>

    <p>Instantly, this young man felt his vision waver, like he had been struck hard in the head. After he came back to his senses, he was dumbfounded when he realized that his connection with Abyss Avoidance had been broken!</p>

    <p>"That's impossible! Impossible!" The young man raised his eyes and stared at Wang Ling. "What did you do to Abyss Avoidance?"</p>

    <p>He still didn't understand what on earth had happened, but on the side, Lord Diulei had seen everything and knew what was going on.</p>

    <p>"You're wrong. My brother didn't do anything to your sword. It was probably his Jingke who did something..."</p>

    <p>Jing...ke? Was that the peach wood sword's name?</p>

    <p>The young man was wide-eyed and had a stunned expression on his face. "I've never heard of this sword on the historical cultivation list of swords."</p>

    <p>"No kidding!" Lord Diulei laughed. "His father bought this sword from the bird and flower market."</p>

    <p>The young man from Immortal Mansion felt like his three views had been upended once again. "..."</p>

    <p>"It's very shocking, right?" Lord Diulei looked at him and spread his hands. "When I heard about this back then, I was as astonished as you. But this is the truth. Actually, it makes sense. Just think about how many cultivation masters in the past casually walked down the street and were able to pick up ancient rare books and treasures — sometimes, this type of thing depends on your immortal fate."</p>

    <p>"What you're saying is completely unscientific!"</p>

    <p>The young man from Immortal Mansion flipped out and roared at him in fury. "It's just a peach wood sword from a rundown place. How can it cause my Abyss Avoidance to switch owners so easily?"</p>

    <p>"Brother, you should be familiar with the sword spirit pheromones theory, that spiritual swords can be mutually attracted to each other. It has nothing to do with betrayal. All living things have feelings, and so do sword spirits," Lord Diulei said. "Between sword spirits, as long as their pheromones are compatible with each other, sometimes it's just a matter of seconds. Brother Ling's Jingke has attracted plenty of female sword spirits..."</p>

    <p>"But my Abyss Avoidance is male! Male! Male!" The corner of this young man's mouth twitched, and he was so angry he repeated the important word three times.</p>

    <p>"Oh, so it's male."</p>

    <p>Realization immediately dawned on Lord Diulei. "You know that you can't explain the pheromones between spirit swords using common sense. This Jingke in my Brother Ling's hand is an aggressive gong ."</p>

    <p>After he said this, Jingke's blade trembled slightly...</p>

    <p>The young man from Immortal Mansion: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"So from the very beginning, it has little to do with gender." Lord Diulei rubbed his jaw and spoke earnestly. "My Brother Ling's Jingke devours both men and women. Whether it's a male or female sword spirit, it can ensnare both."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>At that moment, the young man from Immortal Mansion could really feel his three views crumble to nothing; it was as if everyone present could vaguely hear this young man's inner world philosophy collapse.</p>

    <p>He shook his head repeatedly and muttered non-stop as if he had been possessed by a demon. "I don't believe it... I don't believe it..."</p>

    <p>Then, this red-haired youngster retreated a few steps and finally burst into tears as he straightaway dashed off in one direction.</p>

    <p>This was probably the legendary "run away in tears"...</p>

    <p>That young man hadn't run too far away when Song Qingshu, who had been a bystander the whole time, came forward to stand next to the other two people. He asked with extreme curiosity, "Senior Immortal, the sword spirit pheromones theory you just mentioned... is it true?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Of course it was just something I made up."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu: "So the connection between the sword Abyss Avoidance and that young man is actually still there?"</p>

    <p>"Of course," said Lord Diulei. "Abyss Avoidance is extremely loyal to its owner, how can their connection be broken so easily? That was just Brother Ling's camouflage magic. Anyway, this Abyss Avoidance is already in our hands. Once that person has gone back, Brother Ling will track him, and we'll then know Immortal Mansion's specific location."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>For some reason, Song Qingshu suddenly felt a little sorry for that young man from Immortal Mansion — he had been completely taken in by these two people's routine!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "That's why it's no use having a high cultivation realm. The biggest problem with immersing yourself in cultivation is that you're easily fooled because you don't have enough life experience. My nickname Smooth Talker from back then isn't an empty title! But it seems that I fooled him a little too well — I wonder if that person will be able to find his way home..."</p>

    <p>Looking in the direction that the young man from Immortal Mansion had run off crying in, Lord Diulei couldn't help sighing. " Ai , regretfully, another one bites the dust..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Song Qingshu: "..."</p>
