  <h1>Chapter 155 A Lewd Female Cultivator </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Everything came to an end for the moment.</p>

    <p>Ah You had been killed and for the time being Song Qingshu could rest easy.</p>

    <p>However, Mo Immortal Castle's revenge had in fact only just began. Song Qingshu was well aware that since he had badly injured Ah Zuo and killed Ah You, the Lady of the Castle wouldn't let him go so easily. More powerful killers would probably appear after this, but he already no longer had anything to fear... after all, he was a man with long johns!</p>

    <p>Besides, his soul brand had been washed clean with Senior Wang's house OMO laundry detergent, so it would be more difficult than Mo Immortal Castle had expected to find him now.</p>

    <p>"It seems like I've never been able to do anything bad successfully since young. If I'd known sooner, I would never have joined the dark side." Song Qingshu sighed in his heart, then took out a bottle filled with a purple liquid. This was a bottle of body-dissolving fluid.</p>

    <p>He poured all the fluid over Ah You... a pungent odor filled the air and the shredded red cheongsam on the corpse started to disintegrate. The cheongsam was originally a body armor immortal treasure, but it still couldn't resist the powerful corrosive effects of the body-dissolving fluid. Nonetheless, the fluid also had its limits — it was able to eat through the cheongsam, but the body remained completely intact.</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu was bewildered. The body-dissolving fluid could instantly break down even the bodies of Nascent Soul cultivators, but unexpectedly it was of no use on Soul Formation cultivators.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, the disparity between the bodies of Nascent Soul cultivators and Soul Formation cultivators was too great even though it was only a difference of one realm level.</p>

    <p>Thinking about how he had been stuck at his realm for a long time, Song Qingshu couldn't help lamenting in his heart.</p>

    <p>"Is there any more body-dissolving fluid?" Lord Diulei asked when he saw the situation.</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu held up a bottle. "There's only one left..."</p>

    <p>"Give it to me." Lord Diulei took the bottle, then opened it and sprinkled some fine powder inside before shaking the bottle to mix it in.</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu's face was full of surprise. "Senior... may I ask, what is that powder?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Of course it's your Senior Wang's home OMO washing powder."</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu: "..."</p>

    <p>After the washing powder had completely dissolved in the body-dissolving fluid, Lord Diulei poured the liquid over the corpse once again. This time, the woman's corpse straightaway turned into spirals of vapor that quickly started to evaporate. Furthermore, that pungent odor also disappeared to be replaced by a soapy fragrance!</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu couldn't help giving Wang Ling a thumbs-up; Senior White Rabbit Wang was really awesome!</p>

    <p>Senior Wang, does your family's toilet cleaner have the same effect?</p>

    <p>Can your insecticide directly poison a Soul Formation cultivator?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>The three people stood over Ah You's corpse and waited for it to completely vanish. At the same time, spirit light suddenly flickered next to the corpse and several items appeared.</p>

    <p>These items had originally been hidden in Ah You's earring storage space, but after the body-dissolving fluid had corrupted the storage space, the things inside it had dropped by the body, like the items dropped in video games.</p>

    <p>Perhaps because it had been a short-term assassination assignment, the woman hadn't actually brought much with her.</p>

    <p>Among the items was a black and unusually shaped weapon: it looked like a magic sword with a hilt, but the body was very strange as it was made up of seven black balls linked together.</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu had a stupefied look on his face as he held this black magic sword. "Are Soul Formation female cultivators nowadays so lewd that they will even carry vibrators on them?!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>It was Lord Diulei who recognized it. "...This is the Seven Stars Sword."</p>

    <p>"Seven Stars Sword?"</p>

    <p>"I saw it in an old book. It's a first-class holy weapon, and one of the three magic objects which Immortal Zhenyuan used, along with the Purple Gold Gourd and the Golden Canopy Rope. I would never have thought that this person would have it on her," said Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan...</p>

    <p>Hearing this name, Song Qingshu couldn't help but pull his neck in.</p>

    <p>This was a legendary figure from the same era as the legendary Devil Emperor Gua Pi. The first time that the Gate Between Worlds had come to Earth and the human cultivators had fought valiantly against the massive invasion of the demon race, it was Immortal Zhenyuan who had found a way to shut the gate.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei cupped his chin as he pondered. "Legend has it that the Seven Stars Sword has the ability to move mountains, and can direct the strength of the earth for its own use."</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu: "Then why didn't she use it?"</p>

    <p>"A first-class holy weapon is already extraordinary in itself; for Soul Formation cultivators to be able to use a fourth- or fifth-class grade holy weapon is already their upper limit," said Lord Diulei. "It's worth investigating why this woman had this Seven Stars Sword on her."</p>

    <p>As they spoke, the both of them looked over the other items that had dropped on the ground.</p>

    <p>Apart from the Seven Stars Sword, there were some unfamiliar elixirs as well as a bottle filled with a purple potion.</p>

    <p>This purple potion was the body-dissolving fluid. The woman's original plan had clearly been to deal with Song Qingshu and then directly destroy his corpse. Most unfortunately for her, she had not expected an ending like this.</p>

    <p>Eyes sweeping over the ground, Lord Diulei saw that there were no other valuable items. Losing interest, he returned his gaze to the Seven Stars Sword as he picked it up and studied it carefully.</p>

    <p>The Seven Stars Sword was the only unexpected bonus.</p>

    <p>After asking for Wang Ling's opinion, Lord Diulei didn't hesitate to directly pocket it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling paid no mind to these insignificant first-class holy objects — his body had long become holy itself, and there were almost no magic weapons in the world that could harm him.</p>

    <p>However, among the things scattered on the ground, there was still one object which Song Qingshu and Lord Diulei had ignored, but which had drawn Wang Ling's attention.</p>

    <p>He crooked his finger, and the object flew straight into his hand.</p>

    <p>It was a palm-sized bronze medal that was only as thick as a coin. The medal was engraved with a lotus flower, which Wang Ling thought probably symbolized the woman's identity or the actual organization she belonged to.</p>

    <p>He remembered the woman yelling that she was from Immortal Mansion...</p>

    <p>Was this Immortal Mansion's token?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't dare to assume that this was the case. It was a pity that the woman was already dead; Song Qingshu had been too heavy-handed and had caused her brain to directly explode. Otherwise, Wang Ling could have used his Memory Probe Spell to look for clues.</p>

    <p>Staring blankly at the the bronze medal in Wang Ling's hand, Song Qingshu asked them, "Do both seniors know what kind of organization Immortal Mansion is?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling frowned; he had a hunch that this organization wasn't so simple...</p>

    <p>Besides, his sixth sense was always right.</p>

    <p>"I think I've heard of this organization before; if I had to make a guess, the reason why this woman has the Seven Stars Sword is very likely closely linked to this organization." Lord Diulei narrowed his eyes. "I'll investigate this in more detail. But before that, I would like to ask Brother Ling..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "?"</p>

    <p>"Do you have more long johns? As your brother, hurry up and give me two pairs!"</p>
