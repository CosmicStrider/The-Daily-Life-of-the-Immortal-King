  <h1>Chapter 1140 Poor Zhu Hanyun</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Under that huge mental pressure, the eyes of the boy from South Sea Sky High almost instantly turned red. His tears immediately gushed out and wouldn't stop, no matter what he did. Crying in front of so many people was indeed very embarrassing, but the boy was full of despair; he himself didn't know why Gu Shunzhi appeared so frightening and could glare him into crying.</p>

    <p>But when he gradually calmed down and thought about how he had actually cried in front of so many people, he was immediately seized with heartfelt sorrow and cried even more wretchedly...</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi realized he had overdone it, and immediately started to silently recite the Mind Calming Scripture, which he had developed himself, to help control the boy's mood.</p>

    <p>This mental technique had a mystical "radiation" effect; as long as someone was using it, the people around them would calm down and then automatically enter "sage mode," and instantly delete all those dirty videos from their phones.</p>

    <p>"Calm down a bit. We haven't confirmed yet that you're a suspect. We have to catch the murderer before we can move on to the next round, and we don't have much time left. If you aren't the murderer, then we need you to cooperate even more." Helpless, Gu Shunzhi could only comfort him.</p>

    <p>What Gu Shunzhi had to do his best to learn now was to be patient. In fact, studying at Number 60 High with Wang Ling would be immensely helpful for his future "the only koi fish in the cultivation realm" mission.</p>

    <p>As Gu Shunzhi stealthily activated the Mind Calming Scripture, the boy from South Sea Sky High finally calmed down.</p>

    <p>He felt that what Gu Shunzhi said made sense; including him, there were still ten other suspects. Cooperating with the investigation was the quickest way to clear himself of suspicion and uncover the real murderer.</p>

    <p>Seeing the boy wipe his tears, Gu Shunzhi used a gentle tone to guide him. "Tell us: what did you use magic for in the last thirty minutes?"</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi had gathered the perception-type students together to use their abilities to pick out people who had used magic in the last thirty minutes, and he then ruled out those who could prove that they had used healing spells to treat their comrades.</p>

    <p>The remaining ten suspects now had to clearly explain why they had used magic so that the timeline could be checked and they could be cleared of suspicion.</p>

    <p>Thus, the boy whom Gu Shunzhi had frightened into crying started to speak. "My name is Nan Yixiu, and I'm a Senior Grade One student at South Sea Sky High. Before Zhu Hanyun's body was discovered, I used a perception spell."</p>

    <p>"Perception spell?" Gu Shunzhi smiled slightly. "Can you be more specific?"</p>

    <p>Nan Yixiu's face clearly turned red at this question, and everyone instantly understood... It seemed that this boy had used his perception magic for something embarrassing.</p>

    <p>Nan Yixiu: "I actually didn't do anything bad... It was just that when I was gathering information, I suddenly got a little curious."</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi smiled. "The only thing you can do right now is clarify the matter."</p>

    <p>Nan Yixiu knew he couldn't escape this. "It's like this: It's very normal to gather information during a competition, right? This is our South Sea Sky High's advantage; we're well-known for our perception magic. So, I was thinking of looking around discreetly for information while everyone was resting. Then, I accidentally saw some female students..."</p>

    <p>Everyone around him instantly let out "oh" sounds.</p>

    <p>Many of the boys sighed inwardly over the convenience of perception magic - it could even save them time looking online, and directly broadcast a live show!</p>

    <p>But Huaxiu Alliance actually had a lot of spell bans which applied to perception cultivators, and cultivator homes now were usually fitted with anti-intruder systems. In other words, if cultivators sent out mental feelers, they would trigger the alarm system.</p>

    <p>Using perception to peep on others was illegal.</p>

    <p>But during a competition... No one would get twisted up over such an issue; the most a person would suffer was moral condemnation for a while.</p>

    <p>It was for this reason that a lot of the boys were filled with righteous indignation: <em>How could you keep it to yourself?! Why didn't you bring me along?!</em></p>

    <p>Nan Yixiu couldn't help flushing at all the fingers pointed at him. "I really was only probing for information to begin with, but I never thought that the students from Number 8 Jade Girls' High would be next door."</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi: "Number 8 Jade Girls' High?"</p>

    <p>At that moment, Gao Tianming, who had been watching all this time, suddenly spoke up. "It's a girls' school that's famous for cultivating the Jade Woman Heart Sutra. During dual cultivation, the sutra generates a powerful self-healing ability, which is Number 8 Jade Girls' High's advantage."</p>

    <p>"Jade Woman Heart Sutra? Shouldn't this be cultivated between a man and a woman?"</p>

    <p>"No, the technique has already been improved on so that two girls can also cultivate it without needing to draw on a guy's help. The cultivation method is the same - two people strip naked and lie one on the other."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>After Gao Tianming said this, Nan Yixiu's face turned even redder. He never expected to see such an erotic scene in his first intelligence probe.</p>

    <p>His mind had been a mess, and Nan Yixiu said that he immediately dispelled evil thoughts and went out to cool his head.</p>

    <p>"At the time, I just wanted to go out and cool down a little. You also know I'm not a peeping tom - I also wondered whether I should go next door to apologize." Nan Yixiu rubbed the back of his head in embarrassment.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi said, "Go on."</p>

    <p>Nan Yixiu continued, "I never expected to see Zhu Hanyun lying on the floor when I left my room."</p>

    <p>"You saw him on the floor as soon as you left your room?"</p>

    <p>"That's right; I saw a person lying in front of a door in the distance. That door was shut tight, and I only knew it was Zhu Hanyun when I got closer. At the time, I thought he had a fight with his roommate and had decided to sleep outside."</p>

    <p>"There wasn't any blood at the time?" Gu Shunzhi questioned him closely about the details.</p>

    <p>"No blood." Nan Yixiu nodded his head and said.</p>

    <p>Realization hit Gu Shunzhi.</p>

    <p>If there had been no blood then, there was only one explanation — the Construction Spell had been cast when Zhu Hanyun was knocked unconscious. That was to say, when the Zhu Hanyun who was lying on the floor had been "constructed," he had only been unconscious. Now that he was lying in a pool of blood, someone had definitely attacked this Zhu Hanyun "stage prop" later.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Nan Yixiu elaborated further. "I was so scared. At first, I was going to look for someone to find out what happened. But when I thought about how I was the first person to find Zhu Hanyun lying on the floor, I really wouldn't be able to explain it if I wound up being suspected of knocking him out — it would be very likely that I would be disqualified from the competition."</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi raised his eyebrows. "So what did you do?"</p>

    <p>"I used a Wood Transformation Spell to turn my right arm into wood. I then grabbed Zhu Hanyun by the throat and left behind some wood shavings to try and frame Number 1 Demon-Subduing High... Their school is good at using puppets, so leaving shavings behind would be normal." When Nan Yixiu said that, the students from Number 1 Demon-Subduing High were instantly infuriated.</p>

    <p>"How vile!" A student from Number 1 Demon-Subduing High stepped forward and snorted disdainfully.</p>

    <p>"Don't talk about other people, you're also a suspect." Gu Shunzhi looked at this young man. "Nan Yixiu's done explaining the situation. Let's hear it: what did you do?"</p>

    <p>The young man curled his lip, but at a meaningful glance from Gao Tianming, finally decided to tell the truth. "When I got here, there was no one around Zhu Hanyun, and he wasn't bleeding either. But then I saw the wood shavings on his neck... I thought that someone from our school had quarreled with him and knocked him out, so I..."</p>

    <p>"What did you do?" Everyone had started to become very curious.</p>

    <p>"I used the Star Flame Spell to burn up the wood shavings, and tried to shift the blame to Balance Flame Middle School. After all, they're good at fireball spells. If there were burn marks on the body, they should be the first suspects... At the same time, all traces of the wood would be perfectly covered up."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Hearing that, practically everyone was stupefied.</p>

    <p>In other words, this body of Zhu Hanyun's, which had been created with the Construction Spell, had already been grabbed by the throat and set on fire, but both incidents still couldn't explain where on earth the blood had come from...</p>

    <p>Who the hell knew what Zhu Hanyun went through before he wound up lying in this pool of blood...</p>
