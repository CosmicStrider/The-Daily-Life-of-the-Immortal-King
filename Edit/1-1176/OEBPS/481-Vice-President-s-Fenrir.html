  <h1>Chapter 481 Vice President's Fenrir </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Er Ha stared at this holy beast bone for quite a while and couldn't help swallowing its saliva at the lingering smell of holy beast blood which the bone gave off. It wasn't interested in the bone itself - it was the fragrance of the leftover holy beast blood on it that was too appetizing!</p>

    <p>Holy beast blood had a unique scent; even spirit beasts with a bad sense of smell could detect it. In the beginning, you wouldn't feel anything, but it wouldn't take long for you to become addicted! Perhaps it was because Er Ha had soaked in Xiao Yin's holy beast blood, but it thought that it was now more sensitive to it...</p>

    <p>"You really want to give this to me?" Er Ha looked at Wei Zhi.</p>

    <p>It was obvious that the vice president of the Pet Trainers Guild, Crying Old Immortal, and Wei Zhi didn't know this bone's origin, otherwise they definitely wouldn't think it was an ordinary beast bone and give it away so easily.</p>

    <p>This was mainly because so much of the holy beast blood on this bone had dissipated. Er Ha felt that if it hadn't cultivated to its current level during this time, it probably also wouldn't have been able to smell it.</p>

    <p>Its face was almost pressed up against the glass tank... It could only smell it this close!</p>

    <p>"It's just a bone." Wei Zhi spread his hands with an indifferent air. "It was something I won to begin with, so it's no loss to me. But the vice president regretted it for a long time..."</p>

    <p>"Wh... why?"</p>

    <p>"He has a Fenrir at home that howls its head off every night, but it will calm down as long as the vice president throws it this bone. I heard that this Fenrir treats it like a real lollipop!"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi's lips curled up as he laughed. "I'm guessing that the vice president will have to rely on sleeping pills for the Fenrir this time."</p>

    <p>"Is it that serious?"</p>

    <p>"Hm, it's because that Fenrir is in heat."</p>

    <p>Suddenly, Er Ha felt that it would be a little unkind to accept this bone so brazenly.</p>

    <p>"How about... I just give it back to him?" But even as Er Ha said this, it still opened its mouth and engulfed the entire bone using the Toad clan's Space Swallowing Spell.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "..." <em>Brother Dog, you really are something!</em></p>

    <p>Er Ha was very familiar with this action; almost every human cultivator would have used it as children when they received money during the Chinese New Year - they would say it wasn't nice to accept red packets while tucking them into their pockets... this was a typical case of the mouth saying "no" but the body being honest.</p>

    <p>When Er Ha put the "Bone King" away in its mouth, it had already decided to go look for Xiao Yin to find out about the bone's origin. The most Er Ha could do was determine that it was the bone of a holy beast from the blood on it; however, there was currently no one in the world who knew holy beasts better than Xiao Yin.</p>

    <p>But there was still one thing Er Ha was curious about, and it looked at Wei Zhi and asked, "I recall that Fenrir this type of dog isn't from our country?"</p>

    <p>"It's a spirit beast from western Europe, but while we call it a spirit beast, over there they are used to calling it a demon beast." As a professional pet trainer, Wei Zhi was very familiar with the culture.</p>

    <p>Er Ha was well aware that even if Wei Zhi and Crying Old Immortal didn't know the origin of this holy beast bone, as pet trainers, there was no way that they wouldn't know about holy beasts.</p>

    <p>But on one hand, the scent on this holy beast bone was too faint, and on the other hand, no one would have considered it at all; the announcement that holy beasts were extinct had already been around for a very long time, and could be traced back to a thousand years ago at the earliest.</p>

    <p>After so many years, even Crying Old Immortal himself probably wouldn't believe that the bone he had picked up on his travels actually belonged to a holy beast.</p>

    <p>Listening to Wei Zhi explain the differences in local and foreign names for the concept of the "spirit beast," Er Ha thought it needed to learn a little more about history abroad.</p>

    <p>It really knew too little about foreign history, but most importantly, it didn't even understand everything about the history of its own country!</p>

    <p>Nearly five thousand years had passed since the founding of Huaxiu nation; rounding it up... would be a hundred million years <sup>1</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A comical way of expressing exceedingly large amounts..)</dfn>

    <p>Huaxiu was a country with a long history and an established culture. A multitude of talents had come together and the people were united in one heart in this land of ceremony and propriety. During the first invasion from the Gate Between Worlds back then, these Huaxiu cultivators who stood together had in fact taught those invading demon kings and demon gods a harsh lesson - and the cultivators had had plenty to teach them!</p>

    <p>Thinking this, Er Ha muttered to itself for a moment before asking, "By the way, is there any concept of the holy beast overseas?"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi nodded his head. "Yes! But the name they use is different. Foreigners call them soul beasts... They appear to still have some living soul beasts, while our holy beasts are completely gone..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha let out a sigh. All because of a rumor back then, the holy beasts were wiped out just like that. They were really pitiful...</p>

    <p>"What rank is the vice president's Fenrir?" The only thing Er Ha remembered was that spirit beast (demon beast) assessment standards were the same whether locally or abroad.</p>

    <p>"It's an eighth-class cub, only three hundred years old. But a Fenrir has a long lifespan and if raised well, can mature to attain the highest class, first class."</p>

    <p>"Just eighth class..." Er Ha instantly breathed a heavy sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>Luckily it was just eighth class...</p>

    <p>Although it was already three hundred years old, its spiritual intelligence was limited at the eighth class, and its IQ would only be that of a two- to three-year-old human child.</p>

    <p>Forget the holy beast bone; even if Er Ha pulled Xiao Yin that guy over to stand in front of this Fenrir, it wouldn't be able to recognize him as a genuine holy beast.</p>

    <p>As things stood, Fenrir would definitely complain about this "Bone King" falling into Er Ha's hands.</p>

    <p>Actually, Er Ha had been worried earlier that this Fenrir might tell Crying Old Immortal about how precious this bone was.</p>

    <p>But now its misgivings were completely dispelled. In Crying Old Immortal's eyes, this young Fenrir would probably resemble a child whose toy had been taken away.</p>

    <p>Er Ha couldn't help but tease, "By the way, this foreign demon beast is really early; it's only three hundred years old and it's already in heat?"</p>

    <p>"Tch, you've never seen it." Wei Zhi gestured with his hands. "Even just three-hundred-years old, a Fenrir is already the size of two fully grown spirit lions!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "So big?"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi nodded. "A fully grown Fenrir can at most be the size of a villa! But a fully grown Fenrir can learn to control its size and is very loyal! The most difficult thing about it is when it's in heat."</p>

    <p>Saying this, Wei Zhi couldn't help tsking. "Brother Dog, you've never seen it... Last time I dropped by the vice president's house, I was shocked by its thing down there! Too big! Too enviable!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi couldn't help sighing. "To deal with Fenrir's heat, the vice president actually had a lot of female Fenrir dolls custom made for it... but it used them until they all broke..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha was silent for a bit before it said, "Send me one later..."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi burst out laughing. "Brother Dog, it's not that I'm looking down on you as a fellow brother, but those dolls were made to order for Fenrir; you definitely wouldn't be satisfied when you use it! There wouldn't be any substance to it."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "You misunderstand; I just want to get a friend of mine to reinforce it so that it's guaranteed to remain durable forever..."</p>

    <p>The method Er Ha was talking about was to actually have Little Master Ling enchant the doll; extras were unnecessary, it only needed to be fully durable and tough - this was the only thing Er Ha felt that it could do for that poor Fenrir.</p>

    <p>When it thought about it, it was obvious that an indestructible doll in exchange for a "Bone King" was a good deal!</p>
