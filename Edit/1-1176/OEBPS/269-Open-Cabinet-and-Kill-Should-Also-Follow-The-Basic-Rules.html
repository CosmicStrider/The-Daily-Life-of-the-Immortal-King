  <h1>Chapter 269 "Open Cabinet and Kill" Should Also Follow The Basic Rules! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>As Lie Mengmeng had said, the zombies in the Escape game fell into three categories, from minions, to fatties, to Voldemorts as the highest level. As depicted in typical zombie movies, the zombies here lacked intelligence. The reason why Voldemorts were ranked top in the game wasn't just because they were extremely fast; the key point was that they had some intelligence and could gauge how dangerous a situation was.</p>

    <p>Hence, the instant the Voldemort locked eyes with Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>This Voldemort's thoughts started to spin, the images flashing continuously through its mind like a film roll. People often said, no matter your species, that your best memories would flash before your eyes before you died...</p>

    <p>However, this Voldemort quickly came to its senses, and at the same time, it started sweating like a fountain as it avoided Wang Ling's gaze.</p>

    <p>The other party was just a teenager and didn't seem deadly... but it instinctively felt that this teenager was very dangerous, and that it was going to die!</p>

    <p>In that moment, the Voldemort felt an immense sense of oppression. Each step that Wang Ling took toward it was like invisible pressure, and it felt a phantom force wrapped around its neck... hence, in the next instant, the Voldemort made a decision â€” hide in the cabinet!</p>

    <p>As for why it wanted to hide in the cabinet...</p>

    <p>This was because the game was designed so that the cabinet was basically a safe zone in the early stages of the game, except when the game had set up a "open cabinet and kill" trap <sup>1</sup> as part of the plot.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Basically when a player hides in an enclosed space only to be discovered by the enemy and killed ..)</dfn>

    <p>Hence, the Voldemort thought it would be safe to hide in the cabinet.</p>

    <p>But very quickly, it died...</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng wasn't able to clearly see how it died.</p>

    <p>All he saw was Wang Ling open the cabinet with spirit energy from two or three meters away and curl his hand into a fist, and with a " pop ," green blood had exploded directly out of the cabinet.</p>

    <p>Although Lie Mengmeng didn't understand exactly what had happened, he could basically guess... this was probably the legendary "open cabinet and kill"...</p>

    <p>But the plot seemed to have been reversed!</p>

    <p>According to gameplay, wasn't it the zombies who were supposed to open the cabinet?</p>

    <p>This "open cabinet and kill" should also follow the basic rules!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After dealing with this Voldemort, Wang Ling placed each of his hands lightly on Luo Chuang and Lord Diulei's shoulders for just a moment, and the repercussions from depleting their spirit energy without realizing it wasn't being replenished instantly disappeared.</p>

    <p>"Recovered!"</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang squeezed his hand, and in his heart marveled at Wang Ling's prowess once again.</p>

    <p>The circle had always called Wang Ling Perfected Being, but he had once questioned what Wang Ling's true realm was... now, speaking of true strength, Wang Ling was far from being as simple as a Perfected Being.</p>

    <p>For the vast majority of cultivators, realm represented everything, but in truth, this wasn't right. Each cultivator had their own latent source of power which wouldn't be triggered ordinarily, but could burst out in crucial moments. As a result, legends about all kinds of trump battles flourished in the cultivation world.</p>

    <p>As for how immense Wang Ling's latent power was... it was a mystery to both Luo Chuang and Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked up ahead. The initially empty corridor was full of broken bodies, and the walls were stained with fresh blood from the explosion, which made for an incredibly shocking scene.</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng didn't know exactly what had happened... he only knew that it seemed he and Wang Ling had gotten embroiled in some sort of trouble. Furthermore, it had to do with the cultivation world, which he wasn't a part of at all. But the main point now was that no matter what happened, they couldn't escape.</p>

    <p>He frowned with a look of concern.</p>

    <p>"Brother Song, just treat this as a game. Leave the rest to us." Lord Diulei consoled him.</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng swallowed, and his throat bobbed. He said, "We've cleared all the minions on the first floor. Let's check out that madwoman's husband's ward first and see if there are any other clues in there."</p>

    <p>Both Lord Diulei and Luo Chuang nodded, and led by Lie Mengmeng, the team headed toward the second floor.</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng was the only person who had played the trial version of the game. Even though it had used an abridged plot, the game map was the same, so he was relatively familiar with the environment.</p>

    <p>On the way, he somehow felt his steps becoming a lot lighter. As he walked, it felt like there was a force under his feet that was supporting him, and his steps had changed, and felt springy soft. Furthermore, he also noticed that the needle puncture on the back of his hand from when he had been stabbed outside the hospital had unexpectedly already healed.</p>

    <p>The truth was that this was due to the sheen of protective light that Wang Ling had cast over him.</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng had on the long johns, but his head, hands and feet weren't protected. Wang Ling didn't know what sort of accident could happen in their current situation, so he had simply and directly wrapped Lie Mengmeng in a layer of protective light.</p>

    <p>As long as nothing pierced this membrane of light, there would be no need to worry about Lie Mengmeng's safety at all.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When they got to the top of the stairs on the second floor, Lie Mengmeng, who was holding the night vision camera, looked at one wall and thought it was strange; there was an ornamental circle on it, when the wall had clearly been white in the trial version.</p>

    <p>"Hm... I don't think I've seen this before." He pointed at the design circle.</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang also noticed it, and his eyes immediately narrowed slightly.</p>

    <p>This was because this wasn't a simple design circle.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at it carefully, and saw that its seemingly disorderly design was actually an organized assembly of interlocking elements that came together to form an array pattern. This was a complex operation that was only used in setting up a large magic array.</p>

    <p>He now understood the trick of this game combined with the illusion spell.</p>

    <p>When that USB from before was plugged into a computer, the notion that a person passed into the powerful illusion reflected through the computer screen was just a camouflage; the real endpoint was this Taoist magic array which had been embedded in the game. This kind of array could turn an unreal world into an independent space.</p>

    <p>So in other words, the game world which they were in now had actually become a real space after being altered by the magic array; it was similar to a small world, but its space architecture and nomological laws were simpler.</p>

    <p>And based on this array pattern, Wang Ling could already confirm Luo Chuang's speculation.</p>

    <p>They weren't the only ones who had been sucked into this game space.</p>

    <p>This was a parallel space created by the array, and there were other people experiencing the same environment in a different space.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared contemplatively at this array pattern while Luo Chuang and Lord Diulei were also lost in deep thought.</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang stretched out his hand to gently touch the array, feeling its uneven surface.</p>

    <p>He frowned. "Where have I seen this before?"</p>
