  <h1>Chapter 764 One Of Number 60 High's Great Weapons</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Zhuo Yi felt it had to be said that the old man's desire to live was very strong.</p>

    <p>Far stronger compared with Wuji...</p>

    <p>He was just a tree goblin, after all; of course he would be afraid of fire. Although Zhuo Yi didn't know exactly what the Flame of Purification was, he knew that since it was something from <em>shifu </em>, it definitely wasn't ordinary!</p>

    <p>At that very moment, the old man's eyes were still fixed on the small white flame, tense and nervous.</p>

    <p>The old man couldn't understand how such a godly thing could have fallen into the hands of a mere Golden Core cultivator.</p>

    <p>This was the Flame of Purification!</p>

    <p>This was extreme, legend-rank Yin fire. During a lunar eclipse, when the sun and the moon overlapped, the Flame of Purification would encircle the moon's rim. This was godly fire born of heaven and earth, and the conditions for collecting it were extremely harsh. Because it was extremely difficult to collect, the only person to currently have a large reserve of the Flame of Purification was the Itinerant Immortal who had first discovered it.</p>

    <p>Daoist Name: Emperor Yanyue.</p>

    <p>This was a True Immortal Almighty, but he didn't have a fixed residence and instead roamed all over the place.</p>

    <p>However, as far as the old man knew, another theory had actually emerged over the years which said that Emperor Yanyue had taken in a disciple and had passed down the Flame of Purification he had collected all those years ago to his own disciple.</p>

    <p>If this was true...</p>

    <p>Then everything would make sense.</p>

    <p>Thinking this, the older man suddenly looked up at Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Was it possible that this person was Emperor Yanyue's disciple?</p>

    <p>"My name is Qin Lang. I was impolite earlier..." The old man saluted them with clasped fists.</p>

    <p>Although he had been hiding in the forest all these years guarding the tomb for Beast King, he had always followed matters in the outside world closely. The Imperial tree's root stalks were so long that they could pierce the sky of the outside world, and the way that Qin Lang obtained information was by communicating with the small tree goblins in the outside world, who were responsible for acquiring information and bringing it back to him.</p>

    <p>He had thus known early on that Huaxiu Alliance was arranging for people to explore Beast King's Remains, so he had been especially vigilant and had concealed this forest of Imperial trees in the western region. Yet, it had still been discovered.</p>

    <p>That was when he had been amazed to discover Xiao Yin's existence...</p>

    <p>He was dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>He had never, ever expected a holy beast to have survived the holy beast calamity back then.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Although Huaxiu Alliance currently still hadn't given up on finding Wang Ming, the summer camp had to carry on as usual. Because Wang Ming wasn't around, Lao Gudong replaced him as lead teacher for Wang Ling's group.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, because Zhai Yin was still immersed in grief at Wang Ming's disappearance, her group was also handed over to Lao Gudong.</p>

    <p>Including his own group, Lao Gudong was now looking after three groups on his own...</p>

    <p>It was already twelve hours since Wang Ming disappeared, and it was now past seven o'clock in the morning.</p>

    <p>There were classrooms in the Rainbow Glass Box especially reserved for the lead teachers' use. Lao Gudong was sorting out the schedule for today.</p>

    <p>Official activities started at eight thirty in the morning, and the first one was an observation and learning class on spirit plants that was one and a half hours long. The specific content of this lesson was different from that of yesterday's tour of the base station, and was an advanced program. This was mainly because over the last few years, more and more students every year were choosing the battle department for their college major after high school. Thus, Huaxiu Alliance had taken pains to specially organize this spirit plant program this time in the hopes of stirring up interest in the research of spirit plants and medicinal herbs. When they entered the pharmacology department in university, students could learn alchemy and medicinal skills.</p>

    <p>In the classroom inside Rainbow Glass Box, someone asked Lao Gudong, "Teacher, teacher! What are we going to do in the advanced program?"</p>

    <p>"There is a story about Shennong <sup>1</sup> who tasted hundreds of herbs in the past, so in this advanced program, we want all of you to build on yesterday's lesson and understand exactly how spirit plants might mutate," Lao Gudong said.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Farmer God, creator of agriculture..)</dfn>

    <p>Drug mutation was a technical term.</p>

    <p>Roughly speaking, it had to do with how some spirit plants changed under particular conditions. For example, some spirit plants weren't poisonous when they were dry, but once they were exposed to rain or dew, they would become highly poisonous. This also applied to some poisonous spirit plants that under specific conditions, could transform into non-poisonous varieties.</p>

    <p>However, all these drug mutations had to be tested for manually.</p>

    <p>Every year, Huaxiu's Cultivation Academy of Science would specially recruit a group of cultivators who trained themselves to withstand poison all year round to carry out these manual tests. This was a limited high-paying occupation, known as Shennong. They only worked twenty-four hours every year, but the money they earned in this period was enough to put a down payment on a house in Jinghua city's inner ring!</p>

    <p>This job also required very high qualifications, and applicants were strictly screened by the government.</p>

    <p>It was actually a little early for Grade One newbies to learn about drug mutations, as this was something that Grade Three students would learn.</p>

    <p>But the summer camp this time was a rare one, and the schools definitely wouldn't miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p>

    <p>To Wang Ling, this felt a little like promotional training.</p>

    <p>"During this one-and-a-half-hour observation and learning class on spirit plants in the morning, you will have to understand how spirit plants can mutate. Then at noon, we will supply you with some raw spirit plants that have already mutated: some will be poisonous, some not. You will then have to cook these spirit plants based on what you have learned," Lao Gudong said.</p>

    <p>"Are we going to eat them ourselves?" someone asked weakly.</p>

    <p>"Yes, you will." Lao Gudong nodded. "But to promote friendship between schools and to facilitate friendly interaction between students, Remnant Senior High School will be responsible for tasting our food, while we will eat theirs."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>It turned out that they would be exchanging food!</p>

    <p>Everyone was enlightened.</p>

    <p>"By the way, please take this cook seriously, as it will count to the group score."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"The specific rules are as follows: once the cook is over, students from two schools will swap dishes for the tasting. There are hidden points and basic points. You need to analyze whether these dishes can be eaten or not based on the situation. You'll get five points for an accurate judgment, and lose five points for an incorrect one. These are hidden points, and a specialist teacher will be responsible for assigning them.</p>

    <p>"As for the basic points, for every student on the other side who collapses from poison, our side will get five points. The lowest group score is zero, and the highest is two hundred."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>After he finished speaking, everyone present instantly fell silent.</p>

    <p>Someone then asked, "Teacher... then wouldn't we poison someone to death..."</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong: "All the spirit plants for this cook have been carefully selected and are not overly poisonous; at most, you'll end up in a coma, and you'll excrete the poison later through your sweat. Depending on your individual physiques, some students may be in a coma for up to three days at most. If you are unfortunate enough to collapse from being poisoned, remember to update your summer camp diary after waking up, and include an account of being poisoned while you're at it... After all, we teachers aren't demons."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong: "Oh, that's right; at the cooking stage, you have one chance to get outside help. You can call a teacher or a parent for help."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Chen Chao immediately perked up. "Mother Juan! Who has Mother Juan's phone number?!"</p>
