  <h1>Chapter 584 The Return of the King</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In the peace consulate, Elder Wen looked unperturbed. Now that he had confirmed that the three of them didn't dare do anything to him, he was very reassured... it didn't matter how cheekily he behaved from now on.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Daoist Horse Face was feeling hateful regret.</p>

    <p>If they had known earlier, they wouldn't have arranged to meet in the peace consulate; if only they had found another venue specially for the peace talks.</p>

    <p>At the moment, the envoys from the other three territories looked at each other in dismay; they were wondering in their hearts whether Demon Saint's restriction truly existed or not. Since ancient times, no one had had the guts to cross this line, so there had been no way to confirm if it was real. The problem was that even if they didn't know for sure, this wasn't a line they dared cross!</p>

    <p>Daoist Horse Face couldn't take it. "Wen He, don't be a bully! The peace consulate is made available to us for the purpose of negotiation, but you actually dare treat it as your house? You... you, you're shameless!"</p>

    <p>"???"</p>

    <p>Elder Wen was stunned.</p>

    <p>From the moment he had entered, the other three had had conspiring looks of people up to no good. In broad daylight before heaven and earth, they had been about to do something unsavory to this thousand-year-old toad who was full of bright hope for the future, something indescribable like bondage and wax play...</p>

    <p>Yet now they were firing back by saying that he was being shameless; this operation was stupefying enough to make ghosts and gods weep.</p>

    <p>Elder Wen: "If you can't wait, the three of you can leave first. In any case, I'm going to live in the peace consulate. There's nothing in the convention to indicate that this isn't proper. The original purpose of the consulate is to uphold justice, negotiate conflict and offer asylum to demons in need."</p>

    <p>The envoys from the other three territories were unable to respond. "..."</p>

    <p>It was at that moment that something hit Daoist Bronze Turtle, who stared at Elder Wen and smirked. "Wen He, did you just bring the larvae eggs and not the incubation potion? If you want to incubate them, you need the specially-made incubation demon potion."</p>

    <p>"What a blunder!"</p>

    <p>Elder Wen patted his head.</p>

    <p>The incubation demon potion was an important component for incubating the large meat flies.</p>

    <p>He was getting on in his years, after all.</p>

    <p>There were indeed times when he couldn't attend to every single thing.</p>

    <p>Daoist Horse Face burst into laughter. "Hahaha! Wen He, are you a fool? Without the incubation potion, the larvae eggs you brought here are no use at all, and we can waste time with you!"</p>

    <p>If he had these larvae eggs, Elder Wen could linger for an infinitely long time. Meat flies hatched very fast and they only needed demon qi to grow. For the Toad clan, they were an important food source which not only replenished their demon energy but were also rich in nutrients.</p>

    <p>Elder Wen had brought a lot of larvae eggs with him; as long as he could use demon qi here, he could help the large meat flies to hatch and grow to become his source of sustenance. In theory, they would be like a perpetual motion machine that would run forever!</p>

    <p>Daoist Witch Demon couldn't help laughing. "Elder Wen, you're a real dotard. The incubation demon potion is so important yet you forgot to bring it. You might as well go back to your clan to get it."</p>

    <p>This was a blatant jeer.</p>

    <p>However, Elder Wen's expression was more composed than the three could imagine.</p>

    <p>He couldn't be any clearer on what leaving the consulate would mean for him.</p>

    <p>The three of them were looking forward to him leaving so that they could promptly attack him.</p>

    <p>"It's fine. Certainly, I didn't bring any incubation demon potion with me, but since the three of you envoys are willing to waste time with me, then let's do so."</p>

    <p>Elder Wen waved his hand airily and took out his phone in the next second. "I'll order a delivery and have it brought here."</p>

    <p>The envoys from the three territories: "..."</p>

    <p>Really...</p>

    <p>He had just forgotten something...</p>

    <p>Making such a big deal out of it!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, a golden light fell from the sky in front of the Tuntian Ha clan's original dwelling, Sprout Village; Er Ha had successfully landed here.</p>

    <p>It looked at the slightly glowing golden light on its green fur and was startled.</p>

    <p>Wasn't this Little Master Ling's golden light shield? Why did Er Ha have it?</p>

    <p>Could it be when Lord Ma sent it here, the golden light shield was automatically cast?</p>

    <p>Er Ha was a bit baffled. It hadn't told Little Master Ling about its plan to come to the demon world and thought it had hidden it very well.</p>

    <p>However, if it really was Little Master Ling who had specially arranged this golden light shield...</p>

    <p>This thought pulled at Er Ha's heartstrings as warmth suddenly flooded its heart.</p>

    <p>There were times when Er Ha couldn't help feeling that to have Wang Ling as its owner was truly a blessing.</p>

    <p>Whatever...</p>

    <p>In the current situation, Er Ha would just assume it was a subsidiary effect of using Lord Ma when it was sent here.</p>

    <p>It was better to have the golden light shield than not at all. At its current realm, even if it let loose all the power of Sword Dao in its body, it would barely reach just under Itinerant Immortal level. But while Er Ha couldn't rival an itinerant immortal, it was still a lot more powerful than an ordinary demon king. However, even if that was the case, the demon world was still a dangerous place, and this golden light shield made Er Ha feel a lot more at ease.</p>

    <p>Er Ha lifted its head and looked up ahead in the direction of the Tuntian Ha clan's Sprout Village. However, the village was unexpectedly empty and not even half a shadow of a toad could be seen.</p>

    <p>"Where is everyone?" Er Ha was even more perplexed.</p>

    <p>Right at that moment, Er Ha felt a vibration and suddenly sensed an aura lunging toward the back of its head.</p>

    <p>It tilted its head lightly to avoid it and happened to see a gleaming-faced young man standing behind it.</p>

    <p>This was... Wen Yu?</p>

    <p>Er Ha was able to determine the young man's identity just from his aura.</p>

    <p>It never expected the small toad that had followed Elder Wen around back then to have grown up in the blink of an eye, and to have unexpectedly already cultivated a human form!</p>

    <p>Wen Yu frowned deeply as he stared at the green-furred dog that was standing at the entrance to the village. The aura that had shot out just now had just been a probing strike, but this green-furred dog's reaction stunned him; the other party had dodged it so easily, as if this sneak attack was nothing and as if it had already detected his aura.</p>

    <p>Of course, all of this wasn't important - the most important thing was that there wasn't the slightest trace of demon qi on this green-furred dog... what flowed over it instead was pure spirit qi!</p>

    <p>This was a spirit beast from outside the demon world!</p>

    <p>"Who are you?" Wen Yu's expression suddenly turned wary as he released his aura to try and oppress it.</p>

    <p>However, Er Ha just walked quietly to the young man, completely unafraid of his vigor. It just sighed in its heart: this tiny thing back then was unexpectedly so strong now...</p>

    <p>In some sense, Er Ha thought that Wen Yu was more talented than it had ever been back then, and it felt a little gratified by this.</p>

    <p>Because it had the golden light shield on it, Wen Yu's aura wasn't the slightest bit of use.</p>

    <p>Er Ha walked step by step until it was in front of Wen Yu, who was promptly on his guard. Something told him that this dog was very dangerous.</p>

    <p>Then, Er Ha merely raised its head to look at him, but it was enough to make Wen Yu's mind go blank.</p>

    <p>"Where is everyone else in the village?"</p>

    <p>The moment Er Ha spoke, Wen Yu was immediately stunned.</p>

    <p>Because... this was the tenth generation leader's voice!</p>

    <p>The rims of Wen Yu's eyes almost instantly reddened. "You are..."</p>

    <p>"I didn't die, child."</p>

    <p>Er Ha looked up at the young man in front of it with an extremely determined look. "Your king is back!"</p>
