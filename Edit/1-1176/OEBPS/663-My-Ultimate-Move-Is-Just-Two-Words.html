  <h1>Chapter 663 My Ultimate Move Is Just Two Words!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The Demon Hunters soldier didn't think that these two foolish Golden Core cultivators would actually look down on him. He could clearly crush them to death with just the slightest force, yet they actually dared provoke him to his face?</p>

    <p>"Elder Yin Zhiping, Elder Ji Xing's order is to take them back..."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, I know. I won't kill them." The gloomy young man narrowed his eyes at Zhuo Yi. "But I still have to teach them a lesson first. Since Elder Ji Xing wants them alive, I'll just beat them half to death first."</p>

    <p>The Demon Hunters soldier called Yin Zhiping waved his hand and called lightly, "Little Rongnu!"</p>

    <p>A zigzag bayonet flew toward him in a stream of black light and settled in his hand.</p>

    <p>When the driver of the van saw this, he thought that this was bad.</p>

    <p>Because this was none other than Elder Yin Zhiping's life bonded magic treasure. This zigzag bayonet had taken countless lives. Because of its special design, once it pierced the body, it would directly damage the meridians and instantly paralyze the nerves!</p>

    <p>What was even more frightening was that the injuries caused by the bayonet would bleed continuously for a short period of time and wouldn't stop!</p>

    <p>"Go!"</p>

    <p>The Demon Hunters soldier called "Elder Yin" just lifted his hand and this black zigzag bayonet instantly darted out like a dragon in the water. "To temper this bayonet, I slaughtered eighty-eight Western dragon-type devil beasts called Rong Dragons for their brains. The bayonet is covered in deadly poison; given your realms, if you force yourselves to bear it, perhaps you might last ten minutes?"</p>

    <p>Elder Yin sneered cruelly. "But you should be glad; since it's an order from Elder Ji Xing, I won't let you die so easily..." He had this poison on the bayonet under control; when these two were publicly executed tomorrow, they would suffer acute, unbearable pain from the poison. It would be an experience worse than death.</p>

    <p>The confident party frequently took sadistic pleasure in this type of "strong bullying the weak" showdown. Elder Yin had spent a lot in order to temper this "Little Rongnu" back then as well as to make it his life bonded magic treasure.</p>

    <p>Elder Yin felt that he was giving these two foolish Golden Core cultivators the highest honor by letting them experience the pain of death under his life bonded magic treasure.</p>

    <p>It had to be said that Little Rongnu's lunge forward was incredibly fast, and Zhuo Yi knew that he wouldn't be able to ward it off at all with his current realm.</p>

    <p>So the moment he saw Elder Yin take out this bayonet, he immediately had Zhong Lang, dressed in the long johns, cover him as a meat shield!</p>

    <p>Zhong Lang: "Brother Zhuo???"</p>

    <p>Little Rongnu's power was truly formidable. The moment it came lunging over, it kicked up a mighty wind like the roar of a dragon.</p>

    <p>It could only be said Little Rongnu was worthy of its name.</p>

    <p>"In the end they're just Golden Core cultivators, so naive." The moment Zhuo Yi put Zhong Lang in front of him as a meat shield, Elder Yin sneered endlessly in his heart. How could the body of a mere Golden Core cultivator be a match for Little Rongnu's attack?</p>

    <p>Impale them!</p>

    <p>Elder Yin Zhiping sneered.</p>

    <p>Little Rongnu drew close in the next instant, but just when its tip was less than half an inch away from Zhong Lang's body, the latter emitted a powerful golden light.</p>

    <p>The strength of the enchanted long johns exploded once again at that moment!</p>

    <p>As expected, shifu's long johns were still so powerful...</p>

    <p>While Zhuo Yi exclaimed inwardly, he felt a little nervous at the same time.</p>

    <p>Although he had already sent the text message, he didn't know whether shifu had seen it or not... If shifu didn't see it, Zhuo Yi was still going to die!</p>

    <p>"Meat shield" Zhong Lang was even more shocked; he completely never expected that the long johns which he had put on inside out in a fit of desperation could actually exhibit such strong defense.</p>

    <p>What on earth was the origin of these long johns?</p>

    <p>Zhong Lang was also lost in thought at that moment.</p>

    <p>In the outside world, there was always gossip and rumors about Zhuo Yi, and many people speculated that there was an Almighty directing the scenes from behind Zhuo Yi who was no weaker than the Ten Founding Generals; who that Almighty was, however, had always been a mystery.</p>

    <p>Was this Almighty the big shot who had made these long johns?</p>

    <p>While Zhong Lang was contemplating this, a disbelieving Elder Yin Zhiping launched a second attack.</p>

    <p>The result was still the same as the long johns glowed with a golden light which blocked Little Rongnu's attack.</p>

    <p>Elder Yin Zhiping was hugely astonished. Two mere Golden Core cultivators actually had such powerful robes?</p>

    <p>At that very moment, Zhuo Yi's heart was already on the verge of crumbling.</p>

    <p>They were just barely able to stall the enemy for a while now with the long johns, but it was clear that this wasn't a long-term solution; in the end, it was just an enchanted pair of long johns!</p>

    <p>But just as Zhuo Yi was agonizing over this...</p>

    <p>The next moment, he suddenly saw a brown spirit light on the horizon flying swiftly in his direction.</p>

    <p>That was...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi's eyes instantly opened wide.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Elder Yin's expression was very unsightly.</p>

    <p>"Where the hell did you get that Daoist robe you're wearing?" Elder Yin frowned deeply, aggravated by his two failed consecutive strikes.</p>

    <p>He gazed at Zhuo Yi with a shrewd expression. "It may be strong, but it seems there's only one pair."</p>

    <p>Elder Yin had read the situation astutely, and in the next moment, he adjusted his attack and aimed Little Rongnu at Zhuo Yi with the intent to attack him first. "I'll deal with you first..."</p>

    <p>But to Elder Yin's surprise, this Director Zhuo directly pushed aside the "meat shield" in front of him and walked over to Elder Yin step by step, as if he had suddenly taken the wrong medicine.</p>

    <p>Something was wrong!</p>

    <p>This vigor wasn't right!</p>

    <p>It shouldn't be like this!</p>

    <p>Elder Yin had the vague sense that something was wrong... Was this some sort of ploy?!</p>

    <p>Almost involuntarily, he took a slight step back, his heart full of doubts. This Golden Core cultivator had clearly still been hiding behind someone else a few seconds ago; how did he suddenly change into a different person?</p>

    <p>"Do you still have some life-saving magic treasure on you that you haven't used?"</p>

    <p>Elder Yin now eyed Zhuo Yi with extreme wariness.</p>

    <p>"I used it already; roughly five to six minutes ago, I sent a text message which cost me ten cents." Zhuo Yi looked at him and smiled.</p>

    <p>"Calling for help?" Elder Yin's face darkened in an instant.</p>

    <p>In theory, help shouldn't be able to arrive so quickly...</p>

    <p>But it was at that moment when Zhuo Yi suddenly stretched out his hand to the sky and gave a long cry. "â€” Come, sword!"</p>

    <p>Then, Elder Yin saw a brown spirit beam fall from the sky...</p>

    <p>But instead of turning into a spirit sword in Zhuo Yi's hand, it turned into a membrane of light which settled over his body.</p>

    <p>"Where is your sword?"</p>

    <p>"Ah... It's inside me!" These were Zhuo Yi's last words before Jingke possessed him.</p>
