  <h1>Chapter 402 It Was Really a Sudden Death... </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Xiao Yin had thought that it would be an interesting fight at first. Although the gap between their realms was certainly a little big, he could at least get a bit of a workout from it... However, this old Taoist was too weak! He had just been throwing trapper balls from beginning to end, which greatly disappointed Xiao Yin.</p>

    <p>In the end, this was also because of the effect which the current era of peace had had on cultivators... they lived such easy and comfortable lives that they had no resolve at all to temper actual combat skills. In Xiao Yin's view, just possessing a realm was useless; actual combat skills and realm were equally important. In the past, if a Soul Formation cultivator couldn't throw a hundred punches in a second, he would be too embarrassed to let his realm out.</p>

    <p>Of course, if you could perform a seckill<sup>1</sup> with a single punch... you could totally ignore any and all criticism.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The common Chinese gaming term to mean killing an enemy within seconds.)</dfn>

    <p>Although it could be said that there were many great cultivators in this era, you had to admit that the weakening of actual combat skills among modern cultivators had already become a trend, just like an aging population.</p>

    <p>In the past, it had all been about spells and combat skills, but these had fallen to the wayside as more and more cultivators chose to use magic treasures... In short: more and more inferior cultivators were popping up.</p>

    <p>In previous eras, the strong were honored and their strength was supreme.</p>

    <p>But in this day and age, realm wasn't in fact the only criterion... From what Xiao Yin could see, if the criteria important to modern cultivators were ranked in order from the top down...</p>

    <p>They would more or less be... intelligence, realm, then money...</p>

    <p>Could you live without realm in this era?</p>

    <p>Of course you could! You just needed to be an honest person and live a law-abiding life.</p>

    <p>Could you live with money and no realm?</p>

    <p>Of course you could! Money was omnipotent in any age, and would make the devil turn millstones. There were plenty of rich households nowadays who threw their money at all kinds of resources and treasures in order to enhance their children's physique. Lin Xiaocong, that famous second generation kid who previously had always been mentioned in high school circles, was a good example.</p>

    <p>Then, the last question was: Could you live without intelligence...</p>

    <p>Staring at the old Taoist in front of him who looked like he already had one foot in the grave, Xiao Yin couldn't help sighing in his heart.</p>

    <p>If this old Taoist was half as intelligent as his junior brother, he wouldn't have fallen to this fate today.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin blinked; his eyelashes were very long, and people often mistook him for a girl just by his eyes. The moon shone on his long silver hair so that it glowed with radiance, and coupled with the white shirt he was wearing, he gave off a holy and pure air from a distance.</p>

    <p>Then, in front of these two cultivators of the Demon Hunters Association, Xiao Yin started to release his aura...</p>

    <p>The old Taoist who was the leader rubbed his eyes, and his expression quickly changed at this aura. "Be careful, junior brother!"</p>

    <p>The spiritual pressure was like a great Demacian magic sword falling from the sky<sup>2</sup> to directly pierce their heads!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Demacian Justice is a skill utilized by the character Garen in League of Legends, in which he falls from the sky with a magic sword ..)</dfn>

    <p>These fellow brothers instantly couldn't withstand the boiling of their qi and blood, and Junior Brother Han who was slightly weaker directly vomited a mouthful of blood.</p>

    <p>"He's going to do something big!!" The old Taoist's face changed dramatically.</p>

    <p>From his experience, a mighty spiritual pressure usually descended first before an ultimate move was released.</p>

    <p>Hearing his words, Xiao Yin was speechless. This was nothing - he hadn't even released twenty percent of his qi!</p>

    <p>"Both of you are completely unworthy of my ultimate move." Xiao Yin couldn't help yawning; this fight was too boring.</p>

    <p>When all was said and done, there were too few people nowadays who could force him to unleash his intrinsic spirit field.</p>

    <p>So even until now, Xiao Yin's battle with Wang Ling back then was still fresh in his memory.</p>

    <p>He had lived for eight thousand years, and it was only in that one battle that he had distinctly felt a suffocating sense of suppression.</p>

    <p>Holy beasts would never yield easily to humans, but because of that battle, Xiao Yin had taken the initiative to choose Wang Ling himself.</p>

    <p>"Let's finish this." Thinking this, Xiao Yin's expression turned firm; he had no plans to continue playing with these two people.</p>

    <p>Then, his pupils contracted slightly; the spiritual pressure in the air suddenly increased, and a fierce and massive wave rolled out from Xiao Yin at the center. The ground split open, and the bricks and roof tiles around the site floated up as if they were weightless.</p>

    <p>As the pressure continued to increase, a silver symbol appeared between Xiao Yin's eyebrows.</p>

    <p>"Itinerant Immortal Mark!" exclaimed the two fellow brothers.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the old Taoist was bathed in cold sweat. The situation was completely out of his expectations; to be honest, he had already sensed that something was wrong when Xiao Yin had caught the master ball. He should have listened to his junior brother earlier. Maybe they really had the wrong person, and maybe the soul marker really had been tampered with...</p>

    <p>Hence, it was likely that this young man was an expert who had switched places with the green-furred dog. His realm was perhaps higher than the Soul Formation stage, maybe even at the Void Refinement stage... But there was no way that the old Taoist could have expected the silver-haired young man standing in front of them at this moment to be an Itinerant Immortal.</p>

    <p>There were other realms above the Soul Formation stage like the Ascension and Void Refinement stages, but at the same time, there were three main realm phases known as Perfected Being, Itinerant Immortal and True Immortal.</p>

    <p>The moment the Itinerant Immortal Mark had blossomed, the old Taoist had already understood that this wasn't something that he, a Soul Formation cultivator, could contend against. Even if he had ten, twenty, a hundred trapper balls... in the end they would all be crushed!</p>

    <p>"Goodbye, the two of you!" Xiao Yin smiled slightly. He didn't even use any spells, because he didn't need to at all.</p>

    <p>His pressure alone was enough to force the old Taoist and his junior brother to their knees on the ground as they twitched all over.</p>

    <p>"You're not a spirit beast?"</p>

    <p>The old Taoist was unreconciled to this fact. He clenched his teeth, his expression both a little resentful and remorseful.</p>

    <p>This was because even a first-class spirit beast could only cultivate until the Void Refinement stage at the most; there was absolutely no way it could become an Itinerant Immortal! Itinerant Immortal was the general term for the phase between the Fusion stage and the Ascension stage, so there was no spirit beast in this world that could ever cultivate to the level of Itinerant Immortal and consolidate the Itinerant Immortal Mark!</p>

    <p>"SInce you're going to die, let me show you something." Xiao Yin spread his hands; to let someone die with regrets was very shameful behavior. Since the two men were going to die, he thought that there was no harm in revealing his identity a little.</p>

    <p>Then, in the next moment, old Taoist Canglan and his Junior Brother Han saw an image of a holy beast appear behind Xiao Yin: it was a white unicorn with outspread wings, poised for flight!</p>

    <p>This image flashed in front of them for less than a second...</p>

    <p>But the old Taoist already understood Xiao Yin's identity in that moment.</p>

    <p>He widened his eyes in disbelief!</p>

    <p>"Bzz!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin increased his spiritual pressure.</p>

    <p>Unable to withstand this overwhelming pressure, the old Taoist and his Junior Brother Han instantly bled from the seven orifices of their heads and died suddenly on the spot.</p>
