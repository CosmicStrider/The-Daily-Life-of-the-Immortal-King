  <h1>Chapter 365 This is Not Safe for Children to Look At! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was July 4th on the eleventh Tuesday of the semester.</p>

    <p>At the end of the Shuigou Sect incident, Lao Gudong and Taoist Taotie had bridged centuries of hostilities to resolve their differences, and Lao Gudong was unable to escape burning incense in front of Black Gauze's grave.</p>

    <p>Hence, the same day that this incident wrapped up, Lao Gudong applied for leave for a whole week, thus using up all his annual leave. One after another, the students at Number 60 High School whined incessantly about it; they could no longer pick up gossip, nor could they sneakily do their homework during the history class...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling would later learn from Killer Taoist that the main members of Shuigou Sect had actually been Taoist Taotie's former subordinates from Qiongchi Sect. They held him in very high esteem, and were at his beck and call... They had turned the whole of Songhai city upside down for the sole aim of forcing Lao Gudong to make an appearance.</p>

    <p>Naturally, the entire plan hadn't gone smoothly, like with that blaze which had broken out on June 29th. Actually, it had been a Qiongchi Sect member who had been testing out the spirit fruit, and had suddenly gone crazy. That had been the first trial version of the spirit fruit, and it had been unstable. The current spirit fruit was the second version which had been meticulously developed by Taoist Taotie.</p>

    <p>There had been a significant improvement in the safety performance of the second version, so that those at even just the Foundation Establishment stage wouldn't go berserk after taking it; furthermore, it also had an antidote, so it was completely safe.</p>

    <p>But in order to ultimately force Lao Gudong to show up, Taoist Taotie had simply put on a full show, and had personally set up the magic arrays for stockpiling spirit power himself, even if later, Wang Ling and Fang Xing had secretly taken them apart.</p>

    <p>Later, this would become an unsolved mystery.</p>

    <p>To just say 'disappear' and the arrays disappeared just like that... it was no less terrifying than your brother saying that he had slept with your wife.</p>

    <p>This entire thing, of course, had been a sham meticulously planned by Taoist Taotie. However, one thing had been real, and that was Shuigou Sect's hierarchy: whoever was ugly could become a member. This was a bizarre rule which Taoist Taotie had come up with after he had become disfigured back then, and was something that hadn't changed until now...</p>

    <p>After the entire incident came to an end, there were naturally some who were happy and some who were worried.</p>

    <p>In the heart of Songhai city, on the top floor of a large office building.</p>

    <p>The Lord of the Castle stared at Taoist Taotie, who was sitting on the sofa and wearing a face mask, with an unsightly expression on his face. Next to him, the Lady of the Castle had also lowered her head in silence, not daring to speak at all.</p>

    <p>"Senior, this is a breach of contract!" There was a deep look in the Lord's eyes; he was so infuriated that he couldn't even drink his favourite milk.</p>

    <p>Taoist Taotie waved his hand casually. "No, it isn't a breach of contract; I just decided on my own to put an end to our collaboration here. As for Gorgeous Itinerant's great weapon, I've already found it for you."</p>

    <p>The Lord's complexion improved a little. "Really, senior?"</p>

    <p>Taoist Taotie nodded his head. "I've already instructed someone to send it to your phone."</p>

    <p>Upon saying that, he stood up, and glanced at the Lord before he took his leave. "Your luck has been pretty good so far, and you haven't done anything yet to make anyone come after you. But I still want to give you a piece of advice: there are times when it would be wise to quit while you're ahead... If you persist stubbornly and go astray, you'll fall deeper and deeper into it."</p>

    <p>This was obviously a warning.</p>

    <p>The Lord laughed. "Thank you senior for the kind reminder. This junior knows how to conduct himself properly in this cultivation world."</p>

    <p>As soon as the Lord finished saying the words, Taoist Taotie turned around and vanished into thin air. Following his departure, the tense atmosphere instantly disappeared, and the Lady of the Castle relaxed slightly.</p>

    <p>The Lady of the Castle: "Lord, what are we going to do now that Taoist Taotie is no longer working with us..."</p>

    <p>"It's not a big deal."</p>

    <p>The Lord of the Castle shrugged and said, "In terms of brute strength, we can't compare with Immortal Mansion. In terms of scale, we also can't compare with the Gua Pi Army. But our Mo Immortal Castle has its own strength, and that is our formidable information network. If we can make good use of it, we can exchange information for many valuable resources. Even if we no longer have a patron, we can always find a new one."</p>

    <p>The Lord raised an eyebrow and continued, "And this time, we did gain something."</p>

    <p>The Lady of the Castle: "Do you mean Gorgeous Itinerant's great weapon? But... is it reliable? What kind of great weapon can be transmitted through the phone?"</p>

    <p>The Lord narrowed his eyes. "Perhaps it's a virus program? There are quite a number of well-known killers in the murder industry who are adept in planting viruses in magic treasures and causing them to malfunction."</p>

    <p>Curious, the Lord unlocked his phone; in line with what Taoist Taotie had said, he had received an anonymous email.</p>

    <p>But the email didn't contain a virus program as he had expected; instead, it was a photo snap, the kind that would self destruct three seconds after it was opened.</p>

    <p>Opening the photo snap, the Lord's entire being was stunned - it was actually an image of a topless Gorgeous Itinerant.</p>

    <p>At that moment, the Lord instantly realized what on earth Gorgeous Itinerant's great weapon was...</p>

    <p>"This is...?"</p>

    <p>Extremely curious, the Lady of the Castle Lady drew closer to take a look.</p>

    <p>The Lord shut his phone at lightning speed as fresh blood gushed out of his nose, the dark red color matting his whiskers.</p>

    <p>The Lady of the Castle: "Lord, you..."</p>

    <p>The Lord of the Castle: "This is not safe for kids to look at!"</p>

    <p>The Lady of the Castle: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling arrived at school that morning, he found many students in class absent. Chen Chao, Guo Hao, and even Su Xiao hadn't come to school.</p>

    <p>With their spirits sealed, the students who had eaten the fruit needed some time to get back on their feet, and Teacher Pan this morning was clearly bitter about this. The midterm exam was coming up, and she had planned to do an intensive review of the talismans course, but she had to delay this plan due to the Shuigou Sect incident.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, since so many of the students were absent, there was no way for them to hand in their homework.</p>

    <p>This morning, Grade One, Class Three was thus especially tranquil without Chen Chao's acidic remarks and Su Xiao's obsequious attitude, and even more without Guo Hao's gossip to listen to.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had been sitting in class bored stiff for a while when a familiar figure popped up at the front door; it was the PE teacher, Ye Han.</p>

    <p>Teacher Ye knocked on the door, dressed in his tracksuit and holding a blue notebook in his hand as usual. "Teacher Pan?"</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan was marking exam papers, and lifted her head to look at Teacher Ye curiously. "Old Ye, why are you here? Have you learned how to steal class time for yourself now?"</p>

    <p>Teacher Ye: "..."</p>

    <p>The small number of students in the class who heard this surreptitiously cast gloomy looks in Teacher Pan's direction - this was a typical case of taking advantage of honest people!</p>

    <p>Teacher Ye: "It's like this, I signed Wang Ling up previously to represent our Number 60 High School in the race event at the sports meet, so I need to have a brief meeting with him to explain some things."</p>

    <p>"Oh, I see."</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan turned to look at Wang Ling. "Mm, come back as soon as possible. In five minutes, I'm going to have everyone write down talisman formulas from memory. If you can't catch up, you'll have to do it again in my office later."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Teacher Ye almost coughed up blood when he heard this. Nowadays, a PE teacher was nowhere as lethal as a teacher-in-charge...</p>
