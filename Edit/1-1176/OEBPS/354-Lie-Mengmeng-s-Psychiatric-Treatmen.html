  <h1>Chapter 354 Lie Mengmeng's Psychiatric Treatment </h1>

  <div>

    <p>At the same time, Lie Mengmeng was conducting his psychiatric treatment in an orderly fashion.</p>

    <p>It was Secretary Dakang from the Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools who had instructed for this to be carried out.</p>

    <p>The severity of the Shuigou Sect incident lay not just in the fact that the students who had ingested the fruit could ultimately generate a spirit explosion; it could also be very traumatising. Psychiatric treatment thus was undoubtedly necessary.</p>

    <p>Not only would Lie Mengmeng tell them that there was no shortcut in cultivation; he would also warn them of the error of their ways in eating the fruit so that they could reflect on it.</p>

    <p>Six students had been divided between wards 12 and 13.</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng entered a ward with a roll of names. "Students Guo Hao, Chen Chao and Su Xiao, please get ready, the psychological counselling is about to begin. This is compulsory for everyone, please cooperate."</p>

    <p>There was no response to his words in the room; it could even be said that the atmosphere wasn't the least bit tense.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng's lips twitched, and he struggled to keep the smile on his face.</p>

    <p>Looking away from the roll of names, he lifted his head and caught sight of Guo Hao and Chen Chao, each of them with a game console in their hands. Both of them were probably playing some online game, and were so absorbed that their faces had turned very red, while Su Xiao was sitting by a bed and watching them.</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng put his hands on his waist and pointed at one of them as he pretended to be angry. "Can you be a little serious... put your game consoles away!"</p>

    <p>"We just ate some fruit, the teachers are making a fuss over nothing." Guo Hao reluctantly put his game console away, and when he looked up and met Lie Mengmeng's gaze, he was instantly astonished. "Doctor Song? Why is it you?"</p>

    <p>It was only now that Lie Mengmeng finally saw his face clearly.</p>

    <p>Instinctively, his eyes welled up. "..."</p>

    <p>Damn it! Why was it him!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>To this day, Lie Mengmeng had been unable to forget when Guo Hao had personally showed him how to conduct an anal exam during Number 60 High School's physical examination for the military training... Even when he slept, he would dream of his ass being demolished - the psychological trauma was too deep!</p>

    <p>"Haha, I never expected to run into Doctor Song here again today."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao scratched his head and laughed like a fool. "Are you going to give us psychological counselling?"</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng heaved a bitter sigh. "That's right..."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "So, are you doing part-time work again? Short of money again?"</p>

    <p>"..." Lie Mengmeng instantly took an arrow to the knee.</p>

    <p>Damn! Cut me some slack!</p>

    <p>He put his hands on his waist and straightened his back with difficulty. "I'm qualified, alright?!"</p>

    <p>Although it had been many years since he'd graduated from university, he had studied under a great teacher, and he felt that he would never forget whatever knowledge of psychology he had gained in university back then, no matter how many more decades went by. The most crucial thing was that he hadn't neglected his psychology studies all these years, and had obtained certification as a qualified psychiatrist; otherwise, the city office wouldn't have assigned him this task.</p>

    <p>In the last few years in particular, the country had become obsessed with certification; in the most extreme case, you needed certification to prove that your mother was your mother.</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng laughed. "So? Want to see proof of my qualifications?"</p>

    <p>"It's fine, it's fine - this isn't like several years ago, when things were really chaotic. For example, some people even became kindergarten teachers without any qualifications, and ruined the flowers of our motherland in particular! " Guo Hao sighed and waved his hands.</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng forced a smile. "How unexpected that you this little fatty would understand things so well!"</p>

    <p>"My uncle told me."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao sighed and pointed bitterly at his own face. "I really wonder if it was those crappy teachers who ruined my face when I was younger."</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng: "..."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao shook his head and patted Guo Hao's shoulder. "Lao Guo, don't lose heart; actually, you're not that ugly... you're even quite pleasant-looking."</p>

    <p>Su Xiao also nodded his head. "It's not like you won't be able to get a wife in the future anyway; good looks don't count for much. Don't you still have your parrot Er Dan? Why haven't we seen it around recently?"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao dropped his forehead into his hand. "...It also ate the fruit. It's now being examined at the vet."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "..."</p>

    <p>Su Xiao: "..."</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Roughly five minutes later, Lie Mengmeng's psychological counselling officially began.</p>

    <p>He called the three of them together and started with the first step.</p>

    <p>Deftly twirling a pen in one hand, he lowered his head to look at the medical records which he was holding in the other, then looked at them and asked, "Why did you eat the fruit?"</p>

    <p>This was actually an important question. On the way to the hospital earlier, every teacher-in-charge had asked a similar question. In the end, they discovered that some of the students truly hadn't eaten the fruit as a shortcut in cultivation for the sake of growing stronger... instead, they completely hadn't understood what was going on, and had accidentally eaten it.</p>

    <p>So before the official psychiatric treatment, Lie Mengmeng felt that it was necessary to be clear on the situation.</p>

    <p>After all, this psychiatric treatment was aimed especially at those students who had deliberately eaten the fruit for the sake of power.</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng pointed at Chen Chao. "You speak first."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao nodded his head. "I have a friend... when I went back home after school that day, I texted him to ask how I could get stronger quickly in a short period of time. He told me it would be hard to do in a short time frame - unless I had a cheat. I only needed to eat the fruit, and I would obtain endless power. Then, he demonstrated how to eat it. Later, I realized that I didn't need this thing... If I wanted to get stronger, I definitely couldn't eat a fruit no one knew anything about."</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng's lips twitched. "And then?"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao let out a sigh. "But my mom didn't know; she thought that a relative had sent us this fruit. She straightaway cut it up and put a dish of it on my table. When I ate it, I thought it was just regular fruit."</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng: "..."</p>

    <p>He took a deep breath and looked at Guo Hao. "Then what about you...?"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "My case is pretty much the same. Everyday after school, I give Er Dan some slices of fruit to eat: I eat the skin, it eats the flesh. This way, the both of us fell into Shuigou Sect's trap."</p>

    <p>"So you're all saying that you ate the fruit by mistake?"</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng was surprised, and turned to the last person, Su Xiao. "And why did you eat the fruit?"</p>

    <p>Su Xiao smiled awkwardly and scratched his head. "I was hungry!"</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng: "..."</p>
