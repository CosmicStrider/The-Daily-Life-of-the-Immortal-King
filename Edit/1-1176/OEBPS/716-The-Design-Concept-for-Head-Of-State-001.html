  <h1>Chapter 716 The Design Concept for Head Of State 001</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The Rainbow Glass Box smoothly took all the teachers and students as well as Huaxiu Alliance's officially appointed team of experts and the members of the medical team who had been in the square through the space fissure.</p>

    <p>After being sucked into the world of the glass box, Wang Ling discovered that the inside of the glass box had already been arranged into dormitories.</p>

    <p>This Rainbow Glass Box wasn't just a magic artifact for shuttling through space, but was a magic treasure that could also be used as a dwelling. The moment they entered the Rainbow Glass Box, a lot of the students suddenly understood why they hadn't been told to bring tents in the school notice previously - it turned out that they would be staying inside this magic treasure.</p>

    <p>Since the space was large enough, the whole interior space of the glass box was divided into more than a hundred areas, which made up only a small part of the interior space.</p>

    <p>The lead teachers would be responsible for handling the daily roll call as well as organizing the duties in each area. To foster mutual accountability, moreover, all the dormitories were for two people each.</p>

    <p>Of course, boys and girls were still separated...</p>

    <p>"I brought my own tent..."</p>

    <p>Some of the students were a little disappointed - what summer camp, it was definitely less fun if they didn't stay in tents!</p>

    <p>But in the end, there were also sensible students. "Let's just follow the teachers' arrangements. Although there aren't any high-level spirit beasts in the remains, it's still very dangerous. If we stay in tents, the teachers can't watch over us, and something could easily happen."</p>

    <p>After all, it was all about the students' safety. At the very least, they would be much safer inside the Rainbow Glass Box than moving around outside.</p>

    <p>Besides, the students were originally meant to do some sightseeing while traveling inside the Rainbow Glass Box during this trip. When the time came, the whole Rainbow Glass Box would reportedly become transparent, and all the students would be able to see the scenery outside.</p>

    <p>This reminded Wang Ling of when Father Wang and Mother Wang had taken him to the spirit beast wildlife park as a child. In the wildlife park, everyone sat on a special bus and weren't allowed to get off; they could only do some sightseeing from the bus.</p>

    <p>So in some sense, this trip wasn't that different in essence.</p>

    <p>As the box shuttled through space, the dorm assignments were completed.</p>

    <p>The major areas in the box had already been allocated previously. Each lead teacher didn't have that many students under them, so the dorms were assigned very quickly. It was fine as long as the male and female students were separated fairly.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming's zone was Zone 36. When the dorms were allocated, Chen Chao and Guo Hao were assigned to one room, but Wang Ling's name was never mentioned...</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Ling already had a bad feeling.</p>

    <p>In the end, he saw Wang Ming smile at him. "Finally, Student Wang Ling will room with me."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>He knew it!</p>

    <p>However, after Wang Ming finished speaking, Wang Ling noticed that a lot of people were giving him envious looks.</p>

    <p>"Gosh, Wang Ling's so lucky! Come to think of it, Wang Ling's luck has always seemed pretty good. As expected of our class mascot!"</p>

    <p>"That's right, that's right... he just so happens to be rooming with the teacher, I still have a lot of questions to ask the teacher! Wang Ling really hit it big!"</p>

    <p>Many people couldn't help whispering their comments to one another when they heard the final dorm assignment list.</p>

    <p>In a flash, Wang Ling once again became the center of crazy discussion...</p>

    <p>Actually, Wang Ling could understand the sentiment. After all, the lead teachers selected by Huaxiu Alliance to participate together in the "summer camp" this time were definitely the cream of the crop.</p>

    <p>There had always been a saying in the cultivation world that it was better to be instructed by a famous teacher than to cultivate painstakingly for a hundred years...</p>

    <p>Actually, Wang Ling felt a little aggrieved, because when it came to cultivation, Wang Ming this idiot was hardly a famous teacher!</p>

    <p>Also... before the summer camp even started, this idiot had already made him public enemy number one.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Lao Gudong's voice came over the broadcast. "Students, we are coming to the end of our space journey and we will pass through the space tunnel into the secret land of Devil Valley shortly. Will all teachers and students as well as personnel participating in the operation this time get some rest in your assigned dorms for the time being. The Rainbow Glass Box will reach Beast King's Remains' central safe zone in two hours. Our first stop will be a base station in the central safe zone which we will visit for a tour."</p>

    <p>This camp would only last five days in total, and it was impossible to completely cover all of Beast King's Remains in that time. Because Beast King's Remains wasn't open for a fixed amount of time, and moreover it was for a very short period, currently less than half of Beast King's Remains had been explored by official scientific teams, and the entire western half of the map was black.</p>

    <p>The base station in the central safe zone had been temporarily set up the last time people had entered Beast King's Remains; it contained many simulated samples of extinct resources and explanations of their features, which made the place a little like an exhibition hall.</p>

    <p>This was the first stop chosen for the summer camp, mainly so that the students could better understand what the resources in the remains were like and to learn the best way to determine which plants were poisonous since they would naturally have to depend on themselves.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After that, everyone went back to their assigned dorms.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling went off with Wang Ming, while the head of state pretending to be Head of State 001 and who had been invisible the whole time followed behind Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>For some reason, Wang Ling felt that there was something off with this Head of State 001, but he couldn't be completely sure.</p>

    <p>After all, this was the first time he had ever heard of a humanoid magic treasure.</p>

    <p>He was just amazed at how lifelike this humanoid magic treasure was...</p>

    <p>All the dorms had the same configuration. Each one was very large and had its own bathroom. Most importantly, the dorms had floor-to-ceiling windows so that everyone could look at the scenery as the Rainbow Glass Box flew past.</p>

    <p>When they reached the door to their dorm, Wang Ming gave an order to Head of State 001: "Alert Mode!"</p>

    <p>Then, Head of State 001 very obediently stood in an imposing manner by the door.</p>

    <p>"Not letting him in?" Wang Ling raised his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>"This is the dorm for us two brothers, why should we let a humanoid weapon in... Furthermore, let me tell you, this Head of State 001's two eyes are both recording devices; it'll also film us taking off our underpants inside!" Wang Ming said and sighed.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Saying that, Wang Ming mulled for a bit, chin in hand. He also thought that leaving Head of State 001 at the door was a little strange.</p>

    <p>So he gave another order: "Patrol Alert Mode!"</p>

    <p>Hearing this command, Head of State 001 started to move.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming had fixed the area where the personnel were staying as Head of State 001's patrol range.</p>

    <p>After seeing "Head of State 001" walk off, Wang Ming looked at Wang Ling and said, "You probably noticed it already, right? A few people have snuck in on this trip this time, and are part of the medical personnel. I'm sending 001 over to check if there any movements on their end."</p>

    <p>"What if there's a fight?" Wang Ling was curious.</p>

    <p>"There won't be; Head of State 001 wasn't initially designed for fighting," Wang Ming swiftly replied.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "???"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "Although Head of State 001 does have weapons on it, these are used for protection and defense. In accordance with our country's philosophy, peace naturally is our eternal and unchanging theme!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "So the slogan we designed at the time for this Head of State 001 was... use the bulkiest thing to endure the fiercest beating!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
