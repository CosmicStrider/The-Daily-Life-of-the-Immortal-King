  <h1>Chapter 522 Grade Twelve Spell </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling's protective golden light was so strong that even a Venerated immortal couldn't breach it.</p>

    <p>Although Wind Spirit was blown back, he wasn't heavily injured. That had just been an experimental attack just now, to test how powerful the golden light shield was. In the end, not only was he sent flying, even his entire left arm turned numb!</p>

    <p>"What an amazing golden light shield..." Wind Spirit marveled in his heart.</p>

    <p>Good thing he had been smart enough not to go all out!</p>

    <p>Otherwise, the backlash from the golden light shield would have given him a taste of his own medicine.</p>

    <p>The energy inside Wind Spirit churned abnormally when he was in berserker mode, and black wisps started to coalesce and recreate the arm which Wang Ling had destroyed earlier.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling wasn't the least bit surprised. If this person had had a human body, it would have been impossible for the arm Wang Ling had torn apart earlier to be restored, especially with the "major damage" effect on it.</p>

    <p>However, Wind Spirit was essentially a highly dense, transformed energy being, so being able to use his dense energy to shape new limbs wasn't anything strange.</p>

    <p>Rubbing his newly grown right arm, he gazed at the red-haired young man in the air and laughed coldly. "Zhenyuan, are all you human cultivators this cowardly? You actually need to rely on a dog to save you?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>The corners of Loopy Dog's eyes couldn't help twitching.</p>

    <p>Bloody hell!</p>

    <p>This guy was discriminating against animals!</p>

    <p>"Don't talk about Senior Dog like that!" Immortal Zhenyuan shouted sternly in the air. "After entering the modern age, humans and spirit beasts hold fast to the principle of peaceful coexistence as reflected in the spirit beast contract, which is also based on equal cooperation. At the very least we're living things, but you're not!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded his head and thought that this was quite frank.</p>

    <p>Put simply: You're not human!</p>

    <p>These words were absolutely correct, but they thoroughly infuriated Wind Spirit. "Don't forget who was the one who created me!"</p>

    <p>He whistled sharply, and an enormous spirit wave surged up at the piercing sound. The violent turbulence kicked up dust, and the landscape changed into a raging storm.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked up — Drought Star's sky was a bleak gray without a trace of light. There wasn't any water either, but at that moment, a huge and vast bank of rain clouds started to gather, and it looked like a rainstorm might happen at any moment.</p>

    <p>A Venerated Immortal's mood could trigger unusual natural phenomena.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Ling came to a second realization.</p>

    <p>It was a very small discovery, but it had to do with the concentration of the primordial qi that was produced in a Venerated Immortal's body.</p>

    <p>Because Wang Ling's own primordial qi was so dense, it could directly cleanse his mind. Even with the talisman's suppression, when the concentration of the primordial qi was at what passed as a normal level for Wang Ling, he always had on a poker face and couldn't smile even if he wanted to.</p>

    <p>With the talisman on, the primordial qi and spirit energy now each took up fifty percent of his body. If he wanted to express his emotions freely, Wang Ling would have to suppress his primordial qi until it was fifteen to twenty percent, according to Wang Ming's calculations.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling remembered that the first version of the talisman seal which Wang Ming had created had been able to keep his primordial qi down at twenty five percent. However, its effectiveness had steadily declined over the years!</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan was unable to refute Wind Spirit since it was true that he was the one who indeed had created Wind Spirit. It could be said that this Wind Spirit's mind harbored all the darkest parts of Immortal Zhenyuan's heart.</p>

    <p>But be that as it may...</p>

    <p>It was also a fact that this Wind Spirit wasn't a regular "living thing."</p>

    <p>If they didn't eliminate him, he would definitely be a problem in the future.</p>

    <p>But Wind Spirit didn't think this way; because the inner demon was a part of Immortal Zhenyuan that had broken off, it subconsciously believed that it was a human being...</p>

    <p>So when he heard the red-haired young man's impassioned defense of "Senior Dog," Wind Spirit almost instantly flew into a rage.</p>

    <p>Invisible, Wang Ling could clearly see streams of black air emerge from Wind Spirit's body to envelop him.</p>

    <p>This was precisely the vicious tendencies produced by the inner demon: it contained arrogance, envy, fury, sloth, greed and lust.</p>

    <p>To deal with these types of unclean things, the Great Purification Spell was usually Wang Ling's first choice.</p>

    <p>But that wasn't possible today...</p>

    <p>Because it had to be Immortal Zhenyuan to personally kill Wind Spirit himself; Wind Spirit had said before that if he killed himself or was killed by someone else, Immortal Zhenyuan's cultivation would be severely damaged.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling had to thrash the other party to the point of near death first before getting Immortal Zhenyuan to finish him off...</p>

    <p>Behind Er Ha, Wang Ling was feeling a bit disgruntled: wasn't this just another familiar round of "grade control"?</p>

    <p>What was the most difficult mark to get in an exam?</p>

    <p>Sixty points, and the average score.</p>

    <p>And in a showdown between cultivators...</p>

    <p>The most difficult thing to do was to beat up the other party just shy of death...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wind Spirit knew that the green-furred dog in front of him wasn't that simple. If he couldn't break through that golden light shield, a hand-to-hand battle would definitely be impossible.</p>

    <p>He narrowed his eyes and decided to straightaway use his killer move and destroy everything here...</p>

    <p>"Zhenyuan... I won't show you any mercy today."</p>

    <p>A berserk Wind Spirit yelled at that moment, the sound hurtling out to shake the whole planet. The turbulent dark energy spun around him like a vortex, as if he was standing in the eye of a storm.</p>

    <p>After a few seconds, the dark energy circling him actually began to solidify!</p>

    <p>"He's actually absorbing it?" Immortal Zhenyuan stared blankly at this scene.</p>

    <p>In his past few confrontations with Wind Spirit, it had been very hard to fight him in close quarters when he was in berserker mode.</p>

    <p>Wind Spirit would twine all that dark energy around his fists to boost his strength, and then use his "Ripple Overdrive Technique<sup>1</sup>" to wipe the field...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A technique in the series "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure"; energy from a person's body manifests as ripples that can be used to attack or defend ..)</dfn>

    <p>But Immortal Zhenyuan was seeing this technique for the first time today; he had no idea what the other party was going to do.</p>

    <p>After absorbing all the dark energy, Wind Spirit's body directly turned black in color.</p>

    <p>Er Ha's eyes opened a crack, and it was hugely alarmed when it saw this completely black Wind Spirit — wasn't this like their Little Black?</p>

    <p>Wind Spirit laughed sinisterly as he looked at Immortal Zhenyuan. "Zhenyuan, have you ever seen a grade twelve spell?"</p>

    <p>Grade twelve?</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan was stupefied; the most powerful killing move he could use right now was only grade eleven!</p>

    <p>And this was a move that was enhanced by his two Heavenly Dao!</p>

    <p>This was his trump card which he would never use unless it was a last resort — it was powerful enough to annihilate a planet!</p>

    <p>"Grade twelve..." It was hard for Immortal Zhenyuan to imagine it.</p>

    <p>Before long, Wang Ling noticed Wind Spirit's color turn back to normal from black, and a small sphere the size of a marble hovered above one fingertip; it was easy to miss unless you looked carefully.</p>

    <p>Wind Spirit had absorbed all the dark energy from his berserker mode and condensed it into a small black sphere.</p>

    <p>Although it was very small...</p>

    <p>Although it didn't seem very powerful... this was precisely a misconception!</p>
