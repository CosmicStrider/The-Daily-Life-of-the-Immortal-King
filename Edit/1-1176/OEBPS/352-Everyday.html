  <h1>Chapter 352 Everyday </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Following Director Li's lead, Wang Ling straightaway took the fire escape on the thirtieth floor up to the hospital's rooftop.</p>

    <p>It was a wide area equipped with fitness facilities. The hospital patients usually had one to two hours of outdoor activity daily. The area was enclosed on all sides with a thick metal fence several times the height of a person in order to prevent patients from jumping off the building. Several years ago, there had been a number of cases where mental patients had jumped off the building during the outdoor activity.</p>

    <p>If you wanted to further discuss this issue, you'd have to talk about the Gate Between Worlds from six years ago. Before it had descended, there had actually been a lot of omens, such as animals behaving strangely, but no one had paid any attention to them; since the Spirit Energy Information era, natural disasters could be predicted several days in advance with the use of scientific instruments.</p>

    <p>It just so happened that in the days leading up to the descent of the Gate Between Worlds, everything had been dead quiet, without even a single wisp of cloud in the air. There were some whose cats and dogs had kicked up a fuss, but in the end, they had just smacked their pets with their slippers...</p>

    <p>One day before the gate descended, the mental patients who had been on Second Hospital's rooftop for the outdoor activity suddenly had had petrified looks on their faces before they started laughing like crazy, as if they were following a script.</p>

    <p>At the same time, they had all charged forward madly, and in the end had rushed off the rooftop as one by one they did the Leap of Faith <sup>1</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A maneuver in the video game 'Assassin's Creed' when a player jumps from a high place)</dfn>

    <p>Based on expert analysis after the incident, mental patients were much more sensitive to fluctuations from the Gate Between Worlds! This was the reason for their extreme response on the rooftop.</p>

    <p>Since then, the people thoroughly believed the old saying: <em>Mental patients have their own way of thinking! </em>...</p>

    <p>It had already been six years since the Gate Between Worlds descended.</p>

    <p>Standing on the rooftop, Wang Ling still couldn't forget his shock when as a child he had watched the news broadcast play the surveillance footage of those mental patients going mad and jumping off the building.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that that incident had actually been quite traumatic for him. A high cultivation realm was one thing, but mental development was another.</p>

    <p>That year, he had only been ten years old.</p>

    <p>So in every sense, he actually really admired how Father and Mother Wang had taught him.</p>

    <p>Many people had yet to nurture their three views at the age of sixteen, and would still be feeling lost. The best example would be Xiao Yuncheng, who thought he had become powerful after he had eaten the fruit, and consequently had lost his sense of self.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't necessarily think he himself was very mature - there were times when he could be quite childish in doing something. But he was proud at feeling that his three views were still healthier than many of his peers.</p>

    <p>He had always felt that comparing himself with those cultivators who had truly reached the peaks of their realms step by step was unfair to them; he still had so much more to learn. His parents had already given him good psychological grounding since young; now, he had to find his own way.</p>

    <p>There were some who had yet to figure out the meaning and beauty of life despite already being alive for more than half their lives.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had always thought that there had to be a meaning for his inherent realm; this was what he had been searching for all this time in his everyday life.</p>

    <p>What was an everyday life?</p>

    <p>He felt that a classic line put it best: "Every day that we go through might be a series of miracles that happen <sup>2</sup> ."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is a line from the Japanese manga series 'Nichijou')</dfn>

    <p>Mm, back to the story.</p>

    <p>Director Li had brought him to the rooftop for a specific reason.</p>

    <p>To be frank, the moment Wang Ling had set foot in the building, he had already sensed faint, abnormal fluctuations which were very clearly coming from the hospital's rooftop.</p>

    <p>Seeing Wang Ling's slight frown and the considering expression on his face, Director Li nodded his head. "It looks like <em>shifu's </em> speculation was absolutely correct." When Immortal Toya had come to the hospital earlier, he had also sensed that something was obviously wrong, but his perception wasn't as precise as Wang Ling's.</p>

    <p>Someone had already started something up here.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling walked to the center of the rooftop and gazed at the ground beneath this feet.</p>

    <p>An invisible magic array, its function unknown, had been put down here. Furthermore, it was a very sophisticated setup.</p>

    <p>Of all the magic arrays that he had encountered so far, Wang Ling felt that this was at least in the top three.</p>

    <p>There were quite a number of array experts in cultivation history, such as the legendary Immortal Zhenyuan, while in modern history, Immortal She Pi's array expertise was second to none.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling crouched down and touched the ground. He tried pushing spirit energy into the magic array to make it collapse, but failed; it was like a clay ox entering the ocean - it didn't have the slightest effect.</p>

    <p>Unraveling an array was like dismantling a bomb - it required expertise.</p>

    <p>You had to crack the array's code by deciphering and analyzing its structure in order to discover its core array pattern before you could destroy it. But the tough part for Wang Ling now was that this magic array was invisible and covered in layers and layers of protection - it wasn't that he couldn't crack the code; it was just that it would take some time.</p>

    <p>Hm, very troublesome.</p>

    <p>It would have been great if they had a magic array expert right then.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought in his heart.</p>

    <p>At the very least, it would save him a lot of hassle.</p>

    <p>Just as he was thinking this, Wang Ling suddenly heard soft footsteps coming up the corridor behind them.</p>

    <p>Who was it?</p>

    <p>He turned his head for a look.</p>

    <p>Director Li was startled by Wang Ling's response. When he also turned to look, he saw a bright youngster in a tracksuit slowly approach them.</p>

    <p>Director Li instantly broke out in a cold sweat; he had forgotten to lock the door to the rooftop just now, and unexpectedly, someone had come up here. Furthermore, he hadn't noticed at all! This person's aura was so faint and didn't match his sunny appearance at all; it gave Director Li a bad feeling in his bones.</p>

    <p>"Who are you? You're not supposed to be here." Director Li stared at the newcomer.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing walked out from the shadows and raised both his hands with a wide smile. "Senior Immortal Toya asked me to come and take a look."</p>

    <p>"Our people?" Director Li raised his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>"I'm Fang Xing, I only joined the chat group recently. Director Li probably hasn't met me yet." Fang Xing gave his trademark smile.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought that this smile was Fang Xing's most distinctive trait; it was very bright, and every time he smiled, the corners of his mouth always curved up in the same way. It was hard to tell whether it was fake or not.</p>

    <p>"So you're Brother Fang Xing." Director Li breathed a sigh of relief after Fang Xing introduced himself.</p>

    <p>Although Director Li hadn't met Fang Xing before, he had heard from his <em>shifu</em>Immortal Toya that the youngster had played a significant role in the arrest of the Master of Immortal Mansion previously, and that he was very strong.</p>

    <p>Of course, that was all Director Li knew. After the Immortal Mansion incident, everyone involved had agreed never to mention Fang Xing's true identity again.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had never expected that Fang Xing would actually come here.</p>

    <p>"The person with the mask ahead of us is Classmate Wang Ling, right?"</p>

    <p>Fang Xing smiled. "Your disguise can't fool anyone. Next time, it'd be better for Classmate Wang Ling to wear sunglasses as well, otherwise anyone can tell who you are with one look at your eyes!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Director Li: "Ling Zhenren discovered an invisible array here, but it seems a little hard to decipher. Since Brother Fang Xing is already here, how about we help protect Ling Zhenren together?"</p>

    <p>"An invisible array?"</p>

    <p>Fang Xing touched his jaw. "I have some understanding about arrays, how about I take a look at it? Actually, I'm an expert in arrays."</p>

    <p>Director Li: "Does Brother Fang Xing study arrays?"</p>

    <p>Fang Xing grinned. "That's right - my dad was into them, so I inherited it from him."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Wang Ling suddenly dropped his forehead into his hand; it was only then that he remembered that Fang Xing was Immortal She Pi's son.</p>

    <p>If Fang Xing hadn't said anything, Wang Ling would have almost forgotten.</p>

    <p>Earlier, he had said that it would have been great if they had an array expert; he had never thought that one would actually show up.</p>

    <p>For the first time in his life, Wang Ling also thought that his mouth was very "bright."</p>
