  <h1>Chapter 736 The Village's Last Hope</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Because of this operation to close the net, there was a lot of noise on Wu Zhenjun's end, and many of the lead teachers surrounded the two military tents. A lot of student bystanders who didn't know the truth went over to look.</p>

    <p>"What happened? Are the teachers putting on an impromptu performance?" someone asked.</p>

    <p>They had no idea at all that people from the foreign rebel party Night Chief had infiltrated their ranks.</p>

    <p>By the time most of the students came back to their senses, the situation was already effectively under control.</p>

    <p>"Everybody, don't cause more trouble, carry on with what you should be doing! This has nothing to do with you." Unprompted, a few of the lead teachers in the front maintained order since more and more students were gathering around, and unexpected danger might surface.</p>

    <p>Holding a bowl of salted vegetable soup each which they had gotten from Zhai Yin, Guo Hao and Chen Chao watched from afar as they drank the soup contentedly.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao elbowed Guo Hao. "What's going on? Does your uncle have any information?"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao frowned and replied, "It might have something to do with a foreign power."</p>

    <p>"Foreign power?" Chen Chao was puzzled.</p>

    <p>"Yeah." Guo Hao nodded. "Every year, there will be some foreign forces who sneak into the remains. I heard from one of my uncles before that the country is prepared to come down hard on them, but I didn't expect it would be this harsh... Using sound artifacts like this can be considered pretty crazy."</p>

    <p>Next to them, Su Xiao pursed his lips and asked in disbelief, "Do they sound that bad?"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "Do you know why something always happens in music talent shows every year? Those foolish-looking ones who think they sing very well go up on stage and show off their vocals, but in the end, the judges almost flip the table at their singing..."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "Why?"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao sighed. "Because it's the sound artifacts that give them confidence!"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "..."</p>

    <p>Su Xiao: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Saying this, Guo Hao was suddenly curious. "Do you think anyone in our class can sing well? Isn't there a 'Classes Sing Well' activity at the beginning of the next semester? Someone has to be a lead singer!"</p>

    <p>At that moment, all eyes turned to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Because Wang Ling had sung in class with a guitar before, and it had been good!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao clapped Wang Ling on the shoulder. "It's decided, it'll be you, Wang Ling! In any case, you normally don't say much, it'll be good for you to have a few more lines!"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "This subject seconds that!"</p>

    <p>Su Xiao: "This subject seconds that!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>President Dylan had no idea that they had actually been targeted from the very beginning... And the other side was actually treating them in such an inhuman way. Although he had long heard that the song which Wu Yifan Daoist Wu had sung in the shower was a major killer weapon, he hadn't expected Wu Zhenjun, who was Daoist Wu's disciple, to be so cruel as to record his own shifu's raw vocal!</p>

    <p>Instantly, President Dylan's face changed dramatically. "You... If you dare sing, at worst we'll all die together!"</p>

    <p>Irascible Dharmaraja Daoist Wu, the melody master, was exceptionally lethal... No one would try to take him on so easily, not even President Dylan.</p>

    <p>This was a major killer weapon...</p>

    <p>And the recording only needed to be combined with an amplifier magic artifact to be used.</p>

    <p>As for President Dylan's words, Wu Zhenjun had already made preparations earlier on, and he gave the signal again. "Skr! Skr! Skr!"</p>

    <p>As soon as Wu Zhenjun gave the signal, President Dylan saw the other medical personnel in the tent take out earplugs that they had prepared beforehand and put them in their ears.</p>

    <p>President Dylan: "..."</p>

    <p>Motherfucker! It turned out that they were well prepared!</p>

    <p>At that moment outside the military tent, a sound isolation barrier had already been set up.</p>

    <p>Now, when they broadcasted this raw vocal, everyone else wouldn't be affected.</p>

    <p>Stun this gang first!</p>

    <p>With a smile, Wu Zhenjun directly threw an audiovisual magic ball into the military tent. The moment it hit the ground, it shattered like brittle glass, and the voice of the legendary melody master Wu Yifan was finally released...</p>

    <p>It was just a shower recording, but the moment the glass ball hit the ground, it actually became an intense force that could shake the air, as it turned into visible sound waves on the spot which spread in pulsing waves.</p>

    <p>One by one, the Night Chief cultivators all covered their ears and collapsed as they writhed on the ground in pain.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>A few minutes later, the Night Chief members who had been disguised as medical personnel were all trussed up and carried out one after another. The immortal rope restraints on them had been specially sent by Huaxiu Alliance this time. The more they struggled, the tighter the ropes became, plus they had the effect of suppressing spirit energy.</p>

    <p>"Done." Wu Zhenjun dusted his hands.</p>

    <p>This incident had come to an end, which was a huge relief to Wu Zhenjun; at least the students were no longer in danger.</p>

    <p>Because of his black face, no one could tell whether he was angry or not. He stared coldly at President Dylan. "You're in our custody for now. I suggest you confess the truth. We've already applied to the international prison to take you in, and we should receive a reply very soon."</p>

    <p>When it came to foreign criminal invaders, Huaxiu had specially applied to establish an international prison more than ten years ago. There were three international prisons in the world, and one of them was located in Jinghua city in Huaxiu.</p>

    <p>In fact, that international prison which had been built more than a decade ago was for this plan today.</p>

    <p>President Dylan grit his teeth, unwilling to cooperate. He had thoroughly underestimated Huaxiu Alliance's determination this time.</p>

    <p>President Dylan felt he should have been more cautious from the moment he learned of the fake remains. Although they had infiltrated the remains this time, they had been closely monitored by the other side the whole time.</p>

    <p>This was a severe lapse in tactical planning...</p>

    <p>As commander of Night Chief this time, President Dylan was certainly to blame.</p>

    <p>But it wasn't over yet, and they could still seize an opportunity.</p>

    <p>Because just now, President Dylan had noticed that one person hadn't been caught...</p>

    <p>It was none other than the girl killer who had made waves when she had officially joined the Dark Network recently, and who was reputed to be the third disciple of Numinous Mother: "Ghost Head Blade."</p>

    <p>President Dylan narrowed his eyes and his thoughts churned.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, it had been a very good decision to hire Ghost Head Blade at such a steep price, even though she was ten times more expensive than the rest of the Dark Network members.</p>

    <p>But as expected, there was a reason why the price was so high.</p>

    <p>For now at least, Ghost Head Blade had become Night Chief village's last hope...</p>

    <p>But that said, Ghost Head Blade had still been next to him the moment that sound wave magic ball had been thrown in! How on earth had she escaped?</p>

    <p>President Dylan was astonished by Ghost Head Blade's swift response.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>While Wu Zhenjun counted heads on one side, a cold blade flew out from the side of the military tent which Wang Ming was in toward the latter's thigh at a strange angle...</p>
