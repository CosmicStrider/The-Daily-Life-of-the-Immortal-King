  <h1>Chapter 184 Winner Winner Chicken Dinner! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>On June 9th, Song Qingshu, who was now officially working as a housekeeper at Lord Diulei's villa, discovered that the hawthorn seed had sprouted. Although it was just a sapling, it would grow ten times faster in spirit soil, or even more rapidly than that.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei had researched and developed this spirit soil himself. Compared with soil from elsewhere, it was a hundred times more nutritious for spirit plants. This was spirit soil that could even bring a cooked broccoli back to life, to say nothing of a hawthorn seed.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei had always felt that his spirit soil was the culmination and best representation of his research, and was also a pivotal step for him toward becoming the father of hybrid spirit grass in the future.</p>

    <p>Despite the fact that no one knew what would happen after this hawthorn tree had matured, and whether that girl who had played in the mud with Boss Tan would keep her word, in the end, the person who created the problem should be the one to fix it. Judging from all the clues at hand, this girl was their only hope for a breakthrough.</p>

    <p>Of course, even Lord Diulei could never have expected that as twin magic weapons, the other stone ghost mask would be in Master of Shadow Stream Jiang Liuyue's hand. In fact, things had become even more complicated. This was already no longer as simple as just sealing the stone ghost mask away... because the commander of the Gua Pi Army, Devil Emperor Gua Pi, had struck a deal with Jiang Liuyue and was about to return to the cultivation world.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the past two days, a scene had flashed through Wang Ling's mind a couple of times, but it was always too short for even him to see much. It was the image of a man leaning against a wall and sitting in a pool of blood. His white clothes were soaked in it, and he had his head lowered and eyes shut as he gasped harshly for breath...</p>

    <p>This was the Heavenly Eye's prediction ability at the highest level, which was more specific than the simple twitching of Wang Ling's eyelid. While they both functioned similarly as a warning system, the difference was that his twitching eyelid was directed at him, and foretold how he would be affected by a particular event. On the other hand, the visual omen which the Heavenly Eye showed him was directed at the people around him.</p>

    <p>The Heavenly Eye's visual omen would usually flash through his mind up to three times, and each time the picture would become clearer. So far, the scene had flashed twice, and Wang Ling could clearly see the man's surroundings and the blood that was everywhere. He likely would have to wait for the next time to truly see that man's face clearly.</p>

    <p>The breeze from the bedroom window ruffled Wang Ling's hair. Raising his eyes slightly to look out the skylight, he felt a little uneasy.</p>

    <p>Actually, at that very moment, he just knew that something had already happened.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, after Jiang Liuyue had made a deal with Devil Emperor Gua Pi, they had officially started their "cohabitation" in that strategic convenience mart which she had been using to cultivate in seclusion.</p>

    <p>After a night of instruction, Jiang Liuyue had more or less grasped how to use the recovery technique. When she started using it, she could distinctly sense a current of cosmic power. It was only after she understood it more fully that she realized that this was a magic skill that drew directly on spirit energy from beyond the world to accelerate the recovery of one's realm. However, its drawback was that it would shorten one's lifespan, so it was a forbidden technique.</p>

    <p>A year of one's life for a year of cultivation strength...</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue couldn't help mocking herself in her heart. Although it was a forbidden skill, it unexpectedly still obeyed the law of spirit energy conservation.</p>

    <p>A cultivator at the Soul Formation stage had a lifespan of two thousand years. After regaining her former realm with this recovery technique, her lifespan would be reduced by six hundred years.</p>

    <p>However, she was well aware that she didn't have any other choice.</p>

    <p>After running through the recovery technique's heart sutra twice, she felt that she had already become more skilled at using it than before.</p>

    <p>Next to her, Devil Emperor Gua Pi was looking things up on Jiang Liuyue's wristwatch. It had taken her a pretty long time to teach him how to use it, since "old people" were usually slow to absorb new things.</p>

    <p>Because he was trapped inside the stone ghost mask, Devil Emperor Gua Pi couldn't scroll through pages on the watch. At the moment, he could only release a cloud of black smoke to speak, so the watch's built-in voice function proved very useful. Through his non-stop vocal queries, Devil Emperor Gua Pi thus learned about current developments in modern-day Huaxiu nation.</p>

    <p>"Nowadays, even an immortal sword requires a license plate, and under an odd-even license plate regulation <sup>1</sup> as well? Once my venerable self takes over the world, I'll immediately get rid of this lame regulation...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(As a way to ration road space in China, this policy stipulates that drivers can only use the roads on alternate days depending on whether their license plates end in an odd or even number.)</dfn>

    <p>"Oh wow, this four-wheeled machine is damn cool, when will my venerable self get to drive some of them?"</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue had already started to get used to his successive exclamations.</p>

    <p>At the very beginning, she had wondered if she had brought back a country bumpkin... but after thinking about it again, she then felt that this Devil Emperor Gua Pi was also a pitiful person.</p>

    <p>After all, this old devil who had been trapped for a thousand years was encountering the advanced technology of the human world for the first time.</p>

    <p>As Jiang Liuyue was sighing in her heart, suddenly there was a knock at the door to the convenience mart, and she heard the voice of a strange man. "Hello! Is there anyone here? Your takeout is here!"</p>

    <p>"Takeout?" Jiang Liuyue had a suspicious expression on her face.</p>

    <p>In the black smoke, Devil Emperor Gua Pi laughed. "It was my venerable self who ordered it. Previously, I saw an app on your watch called Riceball <sup>2</sup> Takeout. There are so many things to eat on it!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Riceball, or 'mituan' in Chinese, is a riff on the Chinese food delivery app 'Meituan .. ')</dfn>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue: "I thought that at your current level, you wouldn't need to bother to satisfy food cravings at all..."</p>

    <p>Devil Emperor Gua Pi: "Cultivators can survive without food or drink for several days since they can draw on natural spirit energy, but it's normal to want to eat good food. In order to cut down on costs, those old-fashioned cultivation sects in the past tricked their disciples into enduring their hunger, which was wrong!"</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue: "..."</p>

    <p>Devil Emperor Gua Pi: "Also, weren't you injured? You must have nutrition to replenish your strength. Only then will you be able to recover from your wounds!"</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue: "...But senior, it doesn't seem like you can eat anything in your current state."</p>

    <p>Devil Emperor Gua Pi swiftly replied, "You don't have to worry about that, just help my venerable self open the door."</p>

    <p>Suspicious, Jiang Liuyue went to the door.</p>

    <p>When she opened it, she saw a young brother in white carrying four square delivery boxes and standing respectfully at the door. "Hello, this is the takeout you ordered: two hundred super-hot chicken wings."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>She had just accepted the takeout boxes when she saw a stream of black smoke swiftly dash out of the convenience mart with a whoosh!</p>

    <p>Before that young delivery brother could react, that stone ghost mask directly grabbed his face and stabbed into it with the two hooks on its sides.</p>

    <p>Two minutes later, Devil Emperor Gua Pi completed the soul exchange and used the body of this young delivery brother to stand up.</p>

    <p>He took off the mask and stretched out his arms as he felt a little moved in his heart; it had been too long since he could remember how it felt to own a body.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, this body had a very large flaw; it was only at the Foundation Establishment stage, and in half an hour at the most, he would have to return to the stone ghost mask.</p>

    <p>Of course, he was indifferent to all of this.</p>

    <p>At that very moment, all of Devil Emperor Gua Pi's attention was on those four boxes of super-hot chicken wings.</p>

    <p>This old devil who had been trapped in the mask for a thousand years stared at the four large boxes of chicken wings in Jiang Liuyue's hands and couldn't help swallowing his saliva. His voice was even choked with emotion as he spoke. "...I was sealed away for more than a thousand years and couldn't even have a chicken leg. This time, I can finally eat meat again!"</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue: "..."</p>
