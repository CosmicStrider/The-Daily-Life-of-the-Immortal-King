  <h1>Chapter 794 Tusheng Technology</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Green Sect Enterprise Investment Committee was in essence a foundation. Although it hadn't been long since it was set up, it had already helped many new small and medium enterprises by acting as a bridge to connect them with newly established light force sects and recommending investment opportunities as well as analyzing the market, thereby creating a win-win result in the short term.</p>

    <p>It should be noted that these angel investors were all small and medium enterprises, as the large financial groups wouldn't use an intermediary.</p>

    <p>Enterprises nowadays all paid particular attention to compound interest and wanted to see huge windfalls in the short term. As long as the background capital chain was strong enough, this would greatly alleviate uncertainties about the future.</p>

    <p>Thus, it was extremely favorable for some small and medium enterprises to invest in new sects. They would invest in one or two sects with more potential at the development stage and take control of a certain number of shares. If this sect expanded in the future, the returns would be extremely considerable.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei had learned a little about the investment committee previously. If the sect could attract the attention of these bosses, pulling in one or two billion as investment capital would actually be very easy. Some affluent enterprises could even invest several billion in a sect's initial start-up... but this money was all in HNY!</p>

    <p>This was the first time Lord Diulei and Zhuo Yi had heard of an enterprise directly investing with immortal gold.</p>

    <p>After conversion to HNY, this investment was worth a full four billion.</p>

    <p>Did this boss have a mine at home?</p>

    <p>"A billion immortal gold, this person absolutely owns a mine." Cailian Zhenren and the others were also stunned by this number.</p>

    <p>"I think we should be more cautious about this."</p>

    <p>Er Ha folded its arms and wagged its tail.</p>

    <p>"What Brother Dog says makes sense." Lord Diulei nodded.</p>

    <p>Although Lord Diulei had anticipated that the sect's framework would definitely attract genuinely interested investors, a billion immortal gold was really too exaggerated and felt a little like deliberate bait.</p>

    <p>"Is there any related information on this company?" Lord Diulei asked Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>After returning from the remains, he had asked Zhuo Yi to help take charge of matters to do with the enterprise investment committee. Given Zhuo Yi's position in the General Administration of 100 Schools, it was easy for him to make inquiries with his colleague in the other department, otherwise this process would have taken longer.</p>

    <p>"All the companies are thoroughly audited before Green Sect Enterprise Investment Committee settle on them. The full name of this enterprise is Tusheng Technology, which has branches in and outside the country. Its main business is to foster interest in children cultivation."</p>

    <p>"Children cultivation?"</p>

    <p>This was a pretty novel concept to many of them, since none of them had kids.</p>

    <p>But the fact of the matter was that children cultivation wasn't a new concept.</p>

    <p>"Children cultivation has been an up-and-coming industry in the last few decades. It has branched out into various areas and is aimed at fostering children's interest in cultivation when they're very young and unearthing their cultivation potential. Tusheng Technology has made significant contributions in the field of psychological coaching and in helping preschool children build their foundations," Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>There naturally wasn't much that needed to be said regarding psychological coaching: through a one-or-one or whole class psychological coaching course, the aim was to subtly guide children who weren't overly interested in cultivation toward becoming more keen. Scientific data showed that even if a child wasn't very gifted in cultivation, a strong passion for cultivation at an early age would benefit them hugely later in life.</p>

    <p>As for helping preschool children build their foundations, this was Tusheng Technology's other signature industry. It was mainly to help preschool children build a solid foundation before they reached the Foundation Establishment stage, and to prevent the occurrence of unstable foundations. An unstable realm foundation would cause a person to be stuck at a bottleneck for a long time when breaking through from level nine Qi Condensation stage to the Foundation Establishment stage; their realms could even regress after they advanced to the Foundation Establishment stage.</p>

    <p>Tusheng Technology targeted this field in particular, and had developed various products and related courses to help lay a firm foundation, which won widespread approval from parents.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi said, "Tusheng Technology made use of its achievements in these two fields to set up branches at home and abroad. They were financed through multiple rounds of angel investments by other firms, and finally managed to become a listed company in Huaxiu nation. This is a genuine state enterprise. It's only that it's a fairly young company, so it isn't yet as well-known as Huaguo Water Curtain Group. However, looking at the growth of its annual profits, it will definitely become a Fortune 500 corporation two years from now at the very latest, on par with Huaguo Water Curtain Group."</p>

    <p>"So it looks like this Tusheng Technology is pretty reliable?" Listening to Zhuo Yi's description of Tusheng Technology, each and every one of them had glazed expressions.</p>

    <p>"It's a certified company, so there shouldn't be any problems. However, the amount they want to invest is indeed a bit unusual." Zhuo Yi lowered his head as he mused.</p>

    <p>This company had all the qualifications, and furthermore had obtained outstanding achievements in the field, yet Zhuo Yi had a bad feeling for some reason.</p>

    <p>With an angel investment of a billion immortal gold, Tusheng Technology would hold roughly seventy to eighty percent of the shares of the General Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>While Lord Diulei's start-up capital wasn't small, it was far from a billion immortal gold.</p>

    <p>With a billion immortal gold, he could set up seven or eight sects...</p>

    <p>"Anyway, I think we need to be cautious; what do all of you think?" asked Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>"I couldn't agree more."</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren nodded. "An investment is admittedly a good thing, but sometimes it carries risk. We and the other party are still pretty much strangers at this point. Even if they are interested in our sect, putting in such a huge amount at one go really doesn't seem right."</p>

    <p>"To be a little cautious is a good thing." Dharmaraja also nodded.</p>

    <p>"Alright! Brother Zhuo, we'll have to trouble you to contact your colleague to arrange a time with this investor to take a look at some of the sites we've selected for the sect," Lord Diulei said after thinking for a while before turning to look at Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>No matter what, it wouldn't be proper to directly reject the other party now that they had shown up in all "sincerity" with this investment.</p>

    <p>Tusheng Technology could be considered a large company, that for some reason was suddenly inspired to invest in a new sect, which was very fishy. Whatever the case was, however, they should still meet the relevant person-in-charge before anything else.</p>

    <p>At the very least, they had to learn the other party's intention.</p>

    <p>"When?" asked Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>"Let's make it tomorrow morning," said Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>The reason why he had set it for tomorrow was because he wanted to call Wang Ling over to check the situation out together.</p>
