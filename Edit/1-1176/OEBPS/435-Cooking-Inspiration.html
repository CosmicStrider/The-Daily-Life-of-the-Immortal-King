  <h1>Chapter 435 Cooking Inspiration </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It wasn't like Lord Diulei hadn't heard of Wang Ming, but it was his first time meeting him.</p>

    <p>From quite a while back already, he had heard Wang Ling mention him several times during their chats; each time he did, moreover, there was always some sort of unspoken resentment in his words.</p>

    <p>It was hard to describe this tangled type of love and hate.</p>

    <p>To be honest, Lord Diulei thought that Zhai Yin was being a little excessive... This was Brother Ling's cousin! Even though his cultivation wasn't as high as Brother Ling's... how big could the gap be?</p>

    <p>Although Lord Diulei hadn't sensed any aura on Wang Ming either, he felt that anyone who had a connection to Brother Ling wouldn't be so simple! Just look at the old seniors in the Wang family's small villa; even a broccoli contained insight on the Heavenly Dao! Put simply, these were people who had been cultivating for several thousand years, and it wasn't hard to see whether they were strong or not.</p>

    <p>And so Lord Diulei was a little unhappy at Zhai Yin's attitude. But he couldn't say anything, because he felt that these two right now were like a pair of lovers flirting with each other!</p>

    <p>Standing behind Wang Ming in the research institute, it strongly felt like there was some unexplainable asura field <sup>1</sup> between them... too scary!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The asura is a Buddhist mythical being that at one point in tales was focused on war. The term 'asura field' is used to describe a wretched battlefield.)</dfn>

    <p>He didn't even dare speak; in fact, he was a little afraid that a fourth person might scuttle out at that moment to loudly proclaim something like "I was clearly here first <sup>2</sup> ."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is a line from the Japanese anime 'White Album 2' based on a Japanese adult visual novel.)</dfn>

    <p>But Wang Ming and Zhai Yin were already used to this type of situation.</p>

    <p>Taking Lord Diulei's presence into account, Wang Ming finally, for the first time ever, chose to alleviate this seemingly embarrassing atmosphere.</p>

    <p>He explained the space assessment process. "There's no need to doubt this machine's performance, I carried out several tests. Do you see that fine thread-like electrical line on the outside of the glass dome? I call it a dimension line. Once it's linked to the Daoist robe, you can obtain rough data related to it as well as use the leftover sword qi on it to accurately determine the related dimension coordinates."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei gazed at the dome with a slightly amazed expression. Actually, it wasn't like he had never heard of space tracking technology, but he had thought that it would still be another century before it was possible! But Wang Ming was far more incredible than he had thought! In theory, it would take at least several hundred years to invent this scientific apparatus, but Wang Ming had actually already developed a prototype.</p>

    <p>Although the machine did indeed take a long time to warm up, this was a small flaw that still couldn't outweigh Wang Ming's groundbreaking contribution to scientific research.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ling was done reviewing his homework for the moment, and including the times when he hadn't been able to resist checking the news on his wristwatch, it had taken him slightly under ten minutes. He had memorized the key revision points for the midterm exams which Teacher Pan had mentioned in class today.</p>

    <p>No matter what, study was always the most essential thing... There were even times when Wang Ling felt that the monthly tests were more important than the Three Thousand Great Spells.</p>

    <p>The reason was very simple...</p>

    <p>It was because man only cherished what was acquired through great effort. For Wang Ling, the Three Thousand Great Spells had been with him since young and had taken shape as he grew and his brain cells developed - the actual time he spent on cultivation was probably less than preparing for the monthly tests.</p>

    <p>Putting down the review materials, Wang Ling took a look at the news; whether it was the private chat window or the group chat, there was nothing.</p>

    <p>After all, Daoist Guang's tattered Daoist robe was very old, and Wang Ling didn't think that using a scientific apparatus to trace the leftover sword qi on the robe back to the corresponding space coordinates was an easy task.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling still had faith since he knew that Wang Ming had already developed a pertinent instrument for assessing space, even if it might not be completely perfect and was just a prototype.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling believed that if Wang Ming couldn't do it, then no one else on earth could!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After Wang Ling was done with his homework, Grandfather Wang called him to come downstairs. Previously, Grandfather Wang and the head of Kitchen Knife Sect, Jiang Haifu, who was also Wang Ling's yearmate Jiang Bai's father, had arranged to compare their culinary skills in a match.</p>

    <p>Since the stipulated date was quickly approaching, the old man had been working as fast as possible these days to whip up a lot of new dishes as he planned to showcase his skills in front of Jiang Bai's father. He had thus called for Wang Ling to come and sample his new dishes. This time, he had invented two brand new dishes!</p>

    <p>The old man was actually quite a dedicated person, especially during his younger days, when he would give his all to become champion in any cooking-related event!</p>

    <p>After living for so long, he had never been defeated in any cooking competition he had participated in to date!</p>

    <p>At his emphatic request, Wang Ling, Father Wang, Mother Wang as well as Er Ha gathered together.</p>

    <p>"Jiang Haifu is the head of Kitchen Knife Sect and one of the biggest names in the food and beverage industry; Kikkaro Restaurant is his family business... Dad, will you be alright?" Father Wang sat obediently at the dining table as he hesitantly voiced his doubts. He had been happily battling the troll earlier, and after cursing out the other party's family, had been planning to curse out eighteen generations of his ancestors when the old man had called him to come downstairs.</p>

    <p>The old man rapped the table with the metal ladle in his hand. "What? Looking down on this old Kikkaro Restaurant employee? In any case, I was the head chef at their flagship restaurant for over thirty years, I created a lot of their dishes!"</p>

    <p>Father Wang was silent. "..."</p>

    <p>Then, everyone watched as the old man lifted the lid off the first dish on the table...</p>

    <p>It was a rich meat broth with a very clear soup; furthermore, it was overflowing with spirit power, and the aroma could lift the spirits.</p>

    <p>Father Wang could hardly wait to ladle a spoonful to drink! His fatigue was actually swept away in a flash!</p>

    <p>"What's this, dad?" Father Wang stared at the old man like he had performed a miracle.</p>

    <p>The old man pinched his whiskers and smiled. "To deal with an exceptional person, you naturally need to use exceptional means! You might think this is just a pot of broth, but the meat inside is actually spirit monkey guts and organs! I've been looking for this since before, but I never thought that my friend would be able to help me find it."</p>

    <p>When she heard this, Mother Wang drank a mouthful of the soup, then sang its praises. " <em>Ai </em>? It's really good!"</p>

    <p>"Amazing, amazing!" Father Wang couldn't help giving a thumbs up. "Dad, where did you get the inspiration to create these dishes?"</p>

    <p>The old man looked at Father Wang. "Actually, cooking is similar to you writing novels, it draws from life. Wasn't there a live streamer called Baboon who was banned two days ago? That was where I got the inspiration for this dish. I call it Baboon Head Soup."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "Then the inspiration for the second dish..."</p>

    <p>Grandfather Wang: "My inspiration for the first dish was from the program<em>Man vs. Wild: Rise of the Planet of the Baboons </em>! And I got the idea for the second dish from the second season, <em>Man vs. Wild: Hit The Snake At Seven Inches <sup>3</sup> </em>!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(This refers to hitting a snake where its heart is located, thereby guaranteeing a kill ..)</dfn>

    <p>Mother Wang and Father Wang: "..."</p>

    <p>Grandfather Wang: "That's why I call the second dish Snakeskin Soup!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
