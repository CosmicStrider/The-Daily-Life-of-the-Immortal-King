  <h1>Chapter 372 Society of Saints </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling naturally had his own reasons for needing so much holy beast blood. In a sense, Er Ha's narcolepsy had a lot to do with it cultivating the revised version of the "Demon King Heart Sutra." Although Wang Ling didn't know whether to call this a side effect, this kind of narcolepsy wasn't a good thing.</p>

    <p>That was because once Er Ha slept, it slept like the dead, and would be completely unconscious for a while.</p>

    <p>According to written accounts from ancient times, the blood of a holy beast had a miraculous effect on this type of condition. As long as Er Ha was immersed in this blood, this unique type of narcolepsy could be alleviated.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling was the slightest bit unhappy...</p>

    <p>...Because this holy beast blood had cost him twenty packets of crispy noodle snacks; this was truly a great loss!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was initially going to review his classwork while Er Ha slept, but he suddenly heard Father Wang calling him from the first floor.</p>

    <p>When he went downstairs, he found Mother Wang actually slumped over the table asleep, and Father Wang was taking off her apron.</p>

    <p>Mother Wang had been out and about on her feet the whole of today, and along with the old man, had prepared a full table of dishes in the evening, which had taken a lot out of her. After very carefully removing Mother Wang's apron, Father Wang lifted her in a princess carry and then turned to Wang Ling and whispered, "Send us upstairs..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded his head, then put his hand on Father Wang's shoulder and sent them straight to their bedroom on the third floor.</p>

    <p>A human elevator... was really awesome.</p>

    <p>On the side, the old man couldn't help exclaiming, "This ability is really very useful."</p>

    <p><em>Grandpa, aren't you tired?</em></p>

    <p>Wang Ling cocked his head and looked at the old man as he asked the question telepathically.</p>

    <p>"I'm fine. It's mainly your mother who was exhausted today. She bought so many groceries and had to put them in the cart by herself; when all is said and done, I'm already old..."</p>

    <p>The old man sighed. "When I worked at Kikkaro Restaurant back then, I did everything myself, from selecting the ingredients, loading and unloading them, to carrying them into the kitchen in the back to be cooked. Now, I can't do all this on my own anymore."</p>

    <p>As he said this, the old man's eyes were fixed on the TV screen, and Wang Ling saw a male news anchor say in the standard broadcast voice, " <em>Chasing Breasts Day and Night <sup>1</sup> </em>... is about to start!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is a pun on the title of the Chinese TV drama 白夜追凶, which translates to 'Chasing Violence Day and Night.' The Chinese word 'xiong' is a homonym for both 'violence' and'breast .. ')</dfn>

    <p>So it turned out that the old man was watching <em>Chasing Breasts Day and Night </em>!</p>

    <p>This was a TV drama that had been popular recently, and was about twin brothers who were looking for their mother. Their mother had left when they were very young, so their impression of her was very limited; they only vaguely remembered seeing a plum blossom mark on her breast while they were nursing. One day, after obtaining clues on their mother in a particular city, they quickly started looking for her day and night: one person would act during the day, and the other at night, and the drama was about the various methods they used in their search for their mother. Later, after they found her, the two brothers worked together to write a guide for single dogs called <em>100 Ways to Undress </em>...</p>

    <p>The old man had been waiting in front of the TV for a long time, and he couldn't help saying, "TV stations nowadays aren't on time with their broadcasts at all. They especially like to repeat their ads; they can air one three times in a row."</p>

    <p>Immediately after he said this, the TV aired yet another ad, and the old man clicked his tongue. "The Society of Saints again... I've watched this ad at least thirty times on TV recently."</p>

    <p>Society of Saints?</p>

    <p>The name sounded familiar to Wang Ling; he seemed to have heard it mentioned a lot recently on his way home from school.</p>

    <p>There were also ads for this Society of Saints along the road.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling briefly watched the introduction to this society in the TV ad: a member of the Society of Saints was competing in a tug-of-war with a group of Grade Three Foundation Establishment students. No matter how hard these students pulled, the Society of Saints member was as firm as a rock and didn't budge an inch. Then, with a light yank, this member scored an easy victory.</p>

    <p>At the end, the ad directly announced this member's profile.</p>

    <p>His name was Chu Yuanhao, a freshman from Jiancai High School.</p>

    <p>Age: 16</p>

    <p>Stage: Peak late Foundation Establishment stage</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's gaze turned sharp at this information. A freshman at the peak late Foundation Establishment stage actually won in a tug-of-war against ten high school students at the same level?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't think this was a fake ad since the crackdown on false TV advertising was now very severe. Furthermore, after the Shuigou Sect incident, there wouldn't be any organizations audacious enough to commit fraud - that would just be courting death.</p>

    <p>And generally speaking, any institutions that could advertise on TV were mostly light forces that had been sanctioned by the state.</p>

    <p>After watching the ad, Wang Ling thought at first that this Society of Saints was a private education institute.</p>

    <p>But the string of white characters at the end of the ad completely changed his mind.</p>

    <p>It said in white — <em>Society of Saints is officially open! We welcome talented people from schools all across the nation!</em></p>

    <p>That was to say, this Society of Saints was not a private education institute, but a national-level talent agency looking to attract capable and accomplished people from various schools to groom in particular. The spokesperson in the ad, Chu Yuanhao, was incomparably strong, and obviously met the Society of Saints' standard for eligibility.</p>

    <p>According to the general standard in the modern cultivation system, a peak late Foundation Establishment cultivator would usually have a maximum strength of roughly two thousand <em>jin </em>, but Wang Ling had always thought that there were still people in the world who were endowed with talent beyond the ordinary.</p>

    <p>This Society of Saints ad had indeed confirmed Wang Ling's way of thinking: there really were other people in the world with marvelous powers.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was July 5th and the tenth Wednesday of the semester.</p>

    <p>That morning, Grade One, Class Three had finally recovered its previous liveliness. Chen Chao, Guo Hao, Su Xiao and the others had returned to school. Although their spirits were still sealed at the moment and they couldn't used spirit energy, Teacher Pan had felt that their studies couldn't be delayed any longer.</p>

    <p>Hence, she had taken pains to call their parents one by one and mobilize them with regard to the midterm exams. It was thus thanks to her that all the students of Grade One, Class Three were present today. The students from other classes whose spirit energy had been sealed were still at home resting and would only return to school the following week...</p>

    <p>After about ten minutes, Teacher Pan entered the classroom. When she saw that everyone was present today, she nodded with great satisfaction.</p>

    <p>She stood on the dais, smiling innocently. "Wow! Why do I find every student in my class today so cute?!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Some of you are recovering, but you actually came to school yourself for the sake of learning - as your teacher, I'm very touched!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>It would have been better if she hadn't said it - Wang Ling could already feel the class brimming with resentment.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan looked around and smiled, then took out a pile of test papers from who knew where. "Since my cute students like studying so much, how about we do two review papers first?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
