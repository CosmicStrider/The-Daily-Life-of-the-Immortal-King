  <h1>Chapter 418 Senior Immortal Does Have a Problem, and It's a Big One </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Bathe together...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei took a deep air as he struggled to keep his cool.</p>

    <p>He had watched Jin Shi and Yin Shi grow up; they basically had no contact with the outside world, so it was Immortal Toya who saw to their education. In addition to cultivating, they typically spent their time studying. They were smart and pure kids, and wouldn't do anything corrupt.</p>

    <p>But then again, had Immortal Toya forgotten to teach them about this aspect? Lord Diulei rubbed his chin while he walked and pondered; he felt that men and women were different... They shouldn't be too close even if they were biological siblings!</p>

    <p>At this point in time, he was suddenly reminded of his younger sister, Thunder Goddess. Unlike the obedient Yin Shi, his little sister was quite violent and a sadist!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei deeply felt that if there were any more girls like his sister nowadays, there wouldn't be enough beds in German orthopedics...</p>

    <p>While his imagination ran wild, Jin Shi and Yin Shi led the young man in white on a winding path through the secluded black bamboo forest. Not far up ahead was a young man who looked like an idol, with a large gourd on his back. He was calm and composed as he stood by the lake; it was clear he had been waiting for a while.</p>

    <p>"Shifu, shifu! We've brought Senior Immortal over!" Jin Shi and Yin Shi stepped forward and bowed.</p>

    <p>"Mm, well done." Immortal Toya rubbed their heads. "Previously, I planted spirit mandarins without peels in this black bamboo forest; once they are ripe, the peels will fall off by themselves. In fact, these fallen peels are important medicinal ingredients. Your task today is to sweep the ground and gather these mandarin peels. When you're done, wait for me at the Cultivation Mind Pavilion on the island."</p>

    <p>"Yes, shifu!" The two said in unison.</p>

    <p>"Mm, follow the paper crane as usual. If you encounter any danger that you can't handle, tear it up, and I'll be there immediately." Immortal Toya then raised his hand, and in his palm appeared a paper crane to guide the way. The siblings understood, and bowed as they took their leave to follow the crane.</p>

    <p>While Immortal Toya had picked these siblings up, he had always treated them as his own children. Though he didn't have biological children of his own yet, he already felt like a father.</p>

    <p>Actually, he had deliberately sent Jin Shi and Yin Shi to greet Lord Diulei in order to sound out the situation.</p>

    <p>His assumption was that if Senior Immortal really was secretly married and had a kid, he would definitely have complicated emotions when he saw Jin Shi and Yin Shi!</p>

    <p>And it was as Immortal Toya had expected... After sending Jin Shi and Yin Shi away, he saw this young man in white cup his chin, lost in thought; his brow was furrowed, and his expression looked a little complicated.</p>

    <p>It appeared that Senior Immortal really did have a problem, and it was a big one! Immortal Toya was alarmed. He had never thought that Senior Immortal was the kind of person to fool around outside, but seeing the signs right now, it really looked very suspicious.</p>

    <p>Obviously, Senior Immortal had been under too much pressure in the last few days!</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya couldn't help sighing in his heart; it was rare to see such a moody expression on Lord Diulei's face.</p>

    <p>But since he didn't have any direct evidence, it was like Dharmaraja had said: he could only ask him in a roundabout way!</p>

    <p>"Senior Immortal?" With a smile on his face, Immortal Toya called the young man in white, rousing him from his deep contemplation.</p>

    <p>"Oh! Excuse me, Brother To, I was distracted by something when I saw Jin Shi and Yin Shi!" Lord Diulei rubbed his head and grinned.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "It's fine, Senior Immortal, I understand..."</p>

    <p>The pressure of being a father was undoubtedly huge!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "???"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya pointed at an immortal boat on the bank of the lake: "Senior Immortal, let's get on the boat before we talk any further."</p>

    <p>"Alright." Stepping forward, Lord Diulei realized that this was a brand new immortal boat, and once they were onboard, he couldn't help asking, "By the by, did you buy this immortal boat recently?"</p>

    <p>"That's right, I bought it very cheap!" Immortal Toya nodded, and then his expression suddenly changed as he whispered, "That's because the owner of the immortal boat shop hooked up with another woman and had a kid. After the divorce, he was in a hurry to sell off and break up his assets."</p>

    <p>"Brother To, you really lucked out this time."</p>

    <p>It was obvious that the young man in white didn't get the hint in his words.</p>

    <p>...Was his question not clear enough?</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya clutched his head as he thought it over; he decided to take a different approach.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Since this immortal boat was fully automatic, the route had already been set, and it would immediately start moving after its owner activated it with magic.</p>

    <p>It took about fifteen minutes to get to Chrysanthemum Island in the middle of Yunlan Lake from the banks of the lake.</p>

    <p>Halfway there, Immortal Toya suddenly said, "Senior Immortal, do you know the story about this lake?"</p>

    <p>"What story?" Lord Diulei perked up, curious.</p>

    <p>"Before my ancestor officially acquired this land, this Yunlan Lake was Nalan Clan territory under the control of a remarkable and reputable leader. My ancestor took a fancy to Yunlan Lake's fengshui and wanted to build an island here as a base to refining elixirs. Back then, he had tried negotiating with the Nalan Clan many times but to no avail, until one day, something happened..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "???"</p>

    <p>"The great leader of the Nalan Clan had been cuckolded!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>"His wife had another man on the outside, and not only that, she got pregnant," said Immortal Toya said. "At that time, husband and wife had already been married for several decades, but they never had children, which was a heavy blow to the Nalan leader."</p>

    <p>"What happened after that?"</p>

    <p>"His wife was pressured into marrying the man because of the baby, and in extreme humiliation and pain, the leader divorced her... Not long after that, he and my ancestor made a deal, and he let go off Yunlan Lake and its surrounding estate at a low price."</p>

    <p>At this point, Immortal Toya abruptly turned his head toward Lord Diulei and asked, "Senior Immortal, have you heard of Nalan Buddhist Temple?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei nodded his head. "Mm, I think I've heard of it."</p>

    <p>"It's said that it was the Nalan leader who built this hall... After divorcing his wife back then, he was so miserable that he tried killing himself many times, and was continually rescued by an expert. Finally, disillusioned with the world, he listened to that expert's instruction and build a Buddhist temple far from his hometown in a remote mountain village."</p>

    <p>"I never knew there was this kind of story..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei clicked his tongue. "By the way, who was this expert who saved his life several times?"</p>

    <p>"That person is the Taoist founder of the Sunflower Manual, Zen Master Sunflower."</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, Immortal Toya paused. "...After the Nalan leader converted to Buddhism, he also cultivated its art, and gave himself the Taoist name: Nalan Yanran<sup>1</sup>."</p>
