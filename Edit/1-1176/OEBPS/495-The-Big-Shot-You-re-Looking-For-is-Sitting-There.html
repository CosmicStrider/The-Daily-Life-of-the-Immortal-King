  <h1>Chapter 495 The Big Shot You're Looking For is Sitting There </h1>

  <div>

    <p>This mousepad struck Mr Lu's face, the throw almost killing him on the spot... It was a good thing Wang Ling had just thrown it carelessly and hadn't exerted his full strength.</p>

    <p>Mr Lu had never met Wang Ling before, and had absolutely no idea how strong the "master" that the silver-haired young man had mentioned was. However, after Wang Ling's throw, Mr Lu could now be considered thoroughly enlightened. It was very obvious that the teenager who was currently playing a game was an absolute senior big shot.</p>

    <p>A mousepad had almost directly sent him to hell; who knew what terrible things could happen if this senior truly got angry...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin looked at Mr Lu, who was lying on the ground and twitching slightly. Mr Lu's Spell of Creation and Rebirth was still being inhibited by Xiao Yin's thick phlegm. His wound wasn't irreparable, it was just healing at a snail's pace, so it looked like a "serious injury."</p>

    <p>When Mr Lu looked up, his face was covered in green tree blood. It was clear that Wang Ling hadn't thrown the mousepad lightly just now; the swelling on his face was even bigger than before, and looked like a severe internal injury.</p>

    <p>If it hadn't been for Xiao Yin's phlegm, Mr Lu would have recovered easily. Xiao Yin counted on his fingers. From this point, it would still be another twenty minutes before the inhibitory effect of his phlegm disappeared.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin began to worry about Mr Lu's condition. "I say, are you really alright?"</p>

    <p>"I... have broken ribs... But I can... just about endure it..." Mr Lu struggled to speak as he lay face down on the floor and made the OK sign with his hand.</p>

    <p>This level of injury was already his limit. If Wang Ling hit him again before he was fully recovered, Mr Lu was certain he would die.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin comforted him quietly. "You managed to survive a blow from Master, so you're actually quite tough... given your current state, it's better for you not to move. Once my phlegm... ah, no, I mean my saliva - once the effect of my saliva wears off, you can use your Spell of Creation and Rebirth."</p>

    <p>"..." Lying on his stomach, Mr Lu looked heartbroken.</p>

    <p>Whether it was phlegm or saliva, it was in fact no longer important...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin crouched down beside Mr Lu and couldn't help asking, "You said before that you came here to kill the green-furred dog?"</p>

    <p>Mr Lu nodded. "That's right... I had two assignments in total today; killing the green-furred dog was one of them. But it seems I got it wrong."</p>

    <p>"You didn't."</p>

    <p>At a loss for words, Xiao Yin pointed at Wang Ling. "My master is also the owner of that green-furred dog."</p>

    <p>Mr Lu: "..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin had just been asking randomly, but he realized that he had asked something interesting.</p>

    <p>"Just now, you said you had a second assignment?"</p>

    <p>At this point, Mr Lu had already decided to switch sides, and he didn't plan to hide anything at all - he had to send that swindler President Bai to jail!</p>

    <p>"President Bai gave me the first assignment. The second assignment is from the intelligence organization working with President Bai, called Mo Immortal Castle."</p>

    <p>"Mo Immortal Castle?" This name stunned Xiao Yin; he vaguely remembered hearing Lord Diulei talk about this organization.</p>

    <p>"What did they want you to do?"</p>

    <p>"They said that there's an expert, who looks like a teenager, that has been opposing them all this time. Thus, they negotiated with President Bai to send me to test this expert's skill," Mr Lu explained in detail. "According to the information provided by Mo Immortal Castle, that expert lives in a villa on East Huang Road."</p>

    <p>A villa on East Huang Road...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was dumbstruck once again.</p>

    <p>East Huang Road was very long, and if Mr Lu had mentioned just the road itself, Xiao Yin would have thought nothing of it. But speaking of a villa on East Huang Road, he reacted almost immediately.</p>

    <p>A villa in such a remote place... what other family could it be...</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, Mr Lu laughed mockingly as he lay face down on the floor. "I can barely walk in my current state, it's definitely impossible for me to go pick a fight with that young-looking expert..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin's lips twitched and he couldn't help dropping his forehead into his hand as he looked at Mr Lu. "Actually... I know the young-looking senior expert you're talking about..."</p>

    <p>"You know him? Who is he?" Mr Lu asked incredulously.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin pointed at Wang Ling once again. "It's the person who hit you with a mousepad just now..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Mr Lu already couldn't help swearing in his heart.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At that moment, the water friends match which Daoist Guang had organized had already officially started.</p>

    <p>There were a lot of people gathered in the live stream room. The wave of activity generated by this custom water friends match directly led to yet another surge in popularity for Daoist Guang; the number of people watching the live stream had already reached five million.</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang had achieved this number after live streaming for just a few hours two days ago. Some people even predicted in the bullet messages that Daoist Guang's live stream numbers today might directly break ten million...</p>

    <p>What was the concept of ten million?</p>

    <p>If Daoist Guang really achieved this number, he would directly make history as the fastest live streamer to hit ten million viewers on the cultivation live stream platform.</p>

    <p>"Daoist Guang is pretty awesome." Lord Diulei took a look at the audience numbers and tsked in his heart. He recalled when he had first set up the cultivation forum back then; it had taken him several years of operation before the number of daily active users on the forum hit a stable ten million. In a little over a week, Daoist Guang had broken five million while today, it might very well break ten million...</p>

    <p>In addition, based on the current rate of advancement and level of user activity on the cultivation live streaming platform, it was possible that Daoist Guang's live stream viewers might in fact surpass one hundred million in the future.</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang had always said that he wanted to study how to make figurines. After turning his audience into his believers, he would have them put his figurines up in their homes and burn incense to the figurines whenever they were free...</p>

    <p>The bullet messages in the live stream room were unusually lively. Daoist Guang had already landed, a rifle in his hand. He was looking around for a katana as he walked along, and Lord Diulei could hear him say, "Ladies and gentlemen, please rest assured. If I find a katana, I'll throw this lousy gun away immediately. You can now place your bets and see how many water friends I can kill today."</p>

    <p>The live stream lagged a little, so Daoist Guang in fact didn't need to worry that some of the water friends taking part in the match would be watching the live stream with a secret plan.</p>

    <p>The bet was already open, but now wasn't the time for Lord Diulei to place his wager; he and Wang Ling were still drifting in the air while on the other side, Daoist Guang had already picked up some basic equipment.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had chosen a very strange angle, and they touched down at a distant military base on the map; players called this place an "airfield."</p>

    <p>Actually, they had landed a little late.</p>

    <p>Upon landing, Wang Ling noticed that there was already a kill notification in the top right corner of the public screen.</p>

    <p><em>Player "TTXS" has used "UZI" to killed player "CHENsongBAI"...</em></p>

    <p>TTXS...</p>

    <p>The ID made Wang Ling's lips twitch despite himself.</p>

    <p>DAY DAY GO UP <sup>1</sup> ?</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(TTXS is an acronym of the pinyin for 天天向上 "Tian Tian Xiang Shang,' which literally translates to "day day go up." The full phrase "good good study, day day up" is a deliberate literal mistranslation of the classic saying "study diligently and make progress daily..")</dfn>

    <p>Who was this guy...</p>
