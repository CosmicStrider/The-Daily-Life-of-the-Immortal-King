  <h1>Chapter 219 You Are Already Dead... </h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Xiao Yuncheng?"</p>

    <p>In the dark, Chen Chao immediately frowned when he heard the youth in purple introduce himself.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming turned his head to looked at him. "Do you know this person?"</p>

    <p>"Several years ago when I was in junior high, I participated in a five-kilometer marathon as a school representative. I believe it was this person who beat me. Though I placed second, the difference was really too great." Chen Chao sighed and said, "I learned later that this Xiao Yuncheng was a disciple who was ranked first in the Xiao family's outer sect. If he can smoothly enter a good university in two years' time, there'll be absolutely no problem for him to be promoted to the inner sect."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared expressionlessly at this youth in purple; this person was very talented, and stronger than the majority of Number 60 High School's Grade One students. Putting himself completely aside, the only other person from the elite class who could probably fight this Xiao Yuncheng on the same level was Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>After "killing" all the five students from Reliance High School, the youth in purple began searching through their storage bags.</p>

    <p>He fixed his eyes on one of the eliminated disciples. "Have you already picked up what was in the airdrop?"</p>

    <p>The eliminated disciple was very tough. "Hehe, the dead can't talk... go search it yourself~"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yuncheng shrugged helplessly; he could only personally confirm it himself. When he turned his head, the five disciples of Reliance High School had already disappeared.</p>

    <p>When the green fog which represented an elimination came out, the small world's elimination rule would take effect: any student that gave off the green fog would automatically be sent away after one minute.</p>

    <p>" Ai , what a bunch of crap."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yuncheng sneered in his heart as he searched the airdrop box.</p>

    <p>After a while, he revealed a slightly startled expression. "This is...?!"</p>

    <p>Then, he quickly put whatever had been in the airdrop box into his own storage bag.</p>

    <p>"It seems there was something good in the airdrop box!" At a distance, Chen Chao saw the youth in purple rapidly direct spirit light into his storage bag. His movements were so quick that Chen Chao couldn't see exactly what he had taken.</p>

    <p>Following that, he again heard Xiao Yuncheng grumble. "Hm? There's a large snack gift pack in here?"</p>

    <p>He took out a delicately wrapped gift box, opened it, and searched inside for a moment before pulling out a pack of crispy noodle snacks and throwing it on the ground disinterestedly. "Shit! Why is this airdrop box full of trash..."</p>

    <p>At these words, Wang Ling's face instantly darkened.</p>

    <p>That was an aura that Xiao Yuncheng had never sensed before.</p>

    <p>He felt eyes fixed on his back.</p>

    <p>In the next moment, an unusual scene unfolded above the ruins. Black clouds rolled in like a shroud and lightning like silver serpents danced in the air.</p>

    <p>Pale with fright, Xiao Yuncheng raised his head. This was the small world's godly punishment exercise.</p>

    <p>For the survival system this time, the godly punishment bombardment zone would indeed randomly appear on the map, but there was supposed to be a public reminder five minutes before the godly punishment fell.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yuncheng didn't understand â€” how had he suddenly wound up in this godly punishment zone?!</p>

    <p>Hurriedly, the youth man in purple was about to go and hide in a nearby stone temple to avoid the godly punishment.</p>

    <p>But it was too late.</p>

    <p>Like justice raining down from above <sup>1</sup>, this godly punishment caught Xiao Yuncheng completely off guard.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This phrase is from the game "Overwatch.")</dfn>

    <p>By the time he came back to his senses, he saw a wisp of green smoke already drifting up from his body...</p>

    <p>Under that godly punishment's tremendous pressure, the small world had unexpectedly already deemed him dead!</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>In the dark behind the stone wall, Wang Ming stared at Xiao Yuncheng who was already starting to fade, and covered the wry smile on his face.</p>

    <p>It was clear as crystal in his heart.</p>

    <p>This was a murder that had been committed all because of a pack of crispy noodle snacks.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Before Xiao Yuncheng had vanished, in the conference room in the outside world, many screens were flashing.</p>

    <p>The old Secretary, Zhuo Yi and the headmasters of the six schools were all watching the survival contest.</p>

    <p>"Purple attire, is that the Shenye High School uniform? That young man is doing well," the old Secretary praised. "Was that one-on-five fight just now recorded?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, we have specialists who will compile these wonderful fight scenes into a highlight reel," Zhuo Yi replied.</p>

    <p>Headmaster Sun of Shenye High School smiled. "Old Secretary, you're too kind, that child is our school's Xiao Yuncheng."</p>

    <p>The old Secretary stroked his chin. "Is he a Xiao family disciple?"</p>

    <p>Headmaster Sun nodded. "He's currently the number one disciple in the Xiao family's outer sect. To come this far has actually not been easy for him."</p>

    <p>The old Secretary: "Why do you say that?"</p>

    <p>Headmaster Sun: "An outer sect disciple of the Xiao clan doesn't receive as many resources as inner sect disciples. I know quite a bit about Xiao Yuncheng, this student. He has no grandfather, sister, or confidante in his circle. Because of his spirit root, he is unable to delve deep into the art of alchemy which the Xiao clan is very proud of. He doesn't have the usual habit of frequenting auctions or the underground market, and instead is wholeheartedly absorbed in cultivation... don't you think it's been very hard for this student?"</p>

    <p>Headmasters: "..."</p>

    <p>"This boy indeed hasn't had it easy."</p>

    <p>The old Secretary looked at the screen, his eyes fixed on Xiao Yuncheng who was now searching the airdrop box. He then saw the young man take out a snack gift box, and then pull out a pack of crispy noodle snacks from it, which he then threw on the ground in disappointment.</p>

    <p>Almost at the same time, everyone in the conference room saw Xiao Yuncheng's back unexpectedly emit green smoke...</p>

    <p>How did he die?!</p>

    <p>No one could see clearly how this had happened. Headmaster Sun stood up agitatedly. "Can the killer's profile be brought up?"</p>

    <p>"The broadcast image will automatically switch to the scene of the fight. In a case like this, if someone had chosen to secretly assassinate him from a distance, the image can't be traced," Zhuo Yi replied as he shook his head.</p>

    <p>"How can that be..."</p>

    <p>Headmaster Sun sat down, a little dazed. He felt like tearing his hair out; Xiao Yuncheng was the main force of his Shenye High School! He hadn't even made it into the last nine thousand before he had actually been dispatched just like that!</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi stared at the thread of green smoke coming out of Xiao Yuncheng's back on the screen, and it seemed that he had realized something.</p>

    <p>In fact, he had neglected to mention a point just now. There was actually a second circumstance that could explain the wisp of green smoke drifting out of Xiao Yuncheng's back: to avoid things from becoming too serious while the students fought in this survival contest, General Yi had also specially set up an automatic assessment mechanism in the small world. When the world determined that a person was in a situation where death was inescapable, the smoke would waft out automatically.</p>

    <p>Judging from Xiao Yuncheng's action of throwing the crispy noodle snacks away, Zhuo Yi at that moment in fact had already completely understood.</p>

    <p>He knew that Wang Ling was nearby.</p>

    <p>Only his shifu had the power to influence the small world's nomological forces, directly determining that person's death.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi cupped his face in his hands as he stared at the screen with a face full of smiles: as expected, shifu was so powerful!</p>
