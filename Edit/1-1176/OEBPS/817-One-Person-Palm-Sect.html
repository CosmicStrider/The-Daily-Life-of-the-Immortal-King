  <h1>Chapter 817 One-Person Palm Sect</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The sect leader of Sand Sculpture Sect was instantly struck dumb by this move.</p>

    <p>This was...</p>

    <p>Lu Youming widened his eyes, a petrified look on his face. Although he wasn't certain whether that move just now was exactly the one that he was thinking of, he believed that he hadn't seen wrong.</p>

    <p>Sect Leader Sun, who had just escaped the reporters' clutches, also wore a look of deep astonishment. "This is..."</p>

    <p>Sect Leader Lu's eyes darkened and telepathically said two words, "Word Magic..."</p>

    <p>Word Magic??</p>

    <p>Sect Leader Sun felt like his head was buzzing, as if it had been struck by a thunderbolt, and he was rooted to the spot in a daze.</p>

    <p>Wasn't this the legendary Dao Magic of God that you would naturally comprehend once you reached the highest realm?</p>

    <p>Sect Leader Sun sucked in a cold breath of air. Was this Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch... a Venerated Immortal??</p>

    <p>Well...</p>

    <p>Although they were noble sect leaders of Sky-level sects, there was, in the end, a limit to both Sect Leader Lu's and Sect Leader Sun's worldviews; they had never encountered the Domain of the Gods, so naturally they regarded the Venerated Immortal level as the highest realm.</p>

    <p>But Sect Leader Sun couldn't be blamed, since most cultivators were also unaware of this fact; this was the so-called being unable to see the wood for the trees.</p>

    <p>"Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch is too strong..." Someone sighed.</p>

    <p>With this sort of ability, he was actually only a team leader in the sect - then what was the Office of Strategic Deception's overall fighting strength like? It was truly hard to picture...</p>

    <p>"I surrender..." Sect Leader Ni of Sand Sculpture Sect naturally wasn't a fool. That could be considered his killer move just now, but the other side had neutralized it so easily.</p>

    <p>His strength wasn't on the same level as Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch's at all.</p>

    <p>So he might as well simply surrender and step down himself, which conversely would make him look even more dignified.</p>

    <p>From the machine room, Lord Diulei spoke to Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch using remote telepathy. "Dao Monarch, you can rein in your strength now, it's almost time! No matter who goes on next, you can throw the match."</p>

    <p>"Mm, alright." Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch nodded.</p>

    <p>The immortal warship had already been hovering overhead for quite some time... when all was said and done, it was the Ten Generals who were on it.</p>

    <p>They represented Huaxiu nation's largest official administrative organization of cultivators, and dragging things out for too long indeed wouldn't be good.</p>

    <p>"Sect leaders, are there any other challengers?" It was clear that Wang Han had also received a message from the machine room, and had decided to speed up the proceedings of the exhibition match.</p>

    <p>However, none of the Sky-level sect leaders below the stage dared to step up. Instantly, the scene fell into a slightly awkward silence.</p>

    <p>"Did I use too much strength..." Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch pursed his lips, his good-looking phoenix eyes scanning the crowd.</p>

    <p>After a few minutes, someone in the crowd finally raised his hand. "May... I challenge you, please?"</p>

    <p>All eyes turned toward this voice. It was a young man who didn't look very old, but he was wearing a very tattered and unfashionable Daoist robe whose only purpose was to keep him warm.</p>

    <p>The truth was that this was already the most presentable outfit the young man owned...</p>

    <p>"Of course." Wang Han nodded. "May I ask which sect this brother is from?"</p>

    <p>All the sect leaders gathered on the northern square had guest numbers, and this young man was no exception. There was a badge on his chest, and a pendant, which was a gift from the Office of Strategic Deception, hung around his neck.</p>

    <p>The young man smiled in embarrassment. "I am Su Xing, sect leader of Palm Sect."</p>

    <p>"Sect leader of Palm Sect? Are you sect head? Or sect leader <sup>1</sup> ?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>("Palm Sect" 掌门 in Chinese
can also mean "sect head .. ")</dfn>

    <p>"No... my sect is called Palm Sect," replied Su Xing.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>For a moment, everyone was blank.</p>

    <p>Palm Sect...</p>

    <p>What kind of sect was this? Why had they never heard of it before?</p>

    <p>Many of the sect bigwigs present privately shook their heads.</p>

    <p>But in the arena, Wang Han had already identified this sect leader by his guest number.</p>

    <p>It was confirmed... that he was a sect leader of a Dust-level sect.</p>

    <p>"Has President Lu ever heard of this sect?" Sect Leader Sun of the Alliance asked.</p>

    <p>"I seem to have... I heard it was one of the most pitiful sects last year..."</p>

    <p>Lu Youming nodded slightly. "When the sect was first established, it was a Black-level sect. But poor sect management later led to a drop in disciples year after year. It dropped from Black level to Yellow level. The sect changed location several times as it had to sell the land to pay off its debts, and it then bought a new place to settle down in. I thought this sect would close down; I never thought that it would actually still be around, or that it would actually become a Dust-level sect..."</p>

    <p>Dust-level sects were the lowest ranked, and their disciples mostly did manual labor.</p>

    <p>For example, a lot of sect construction, building relocation, weeding, and other similar type of work in top-level sects were outsourced to Dust-level sects as a cheap labor force.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the criteria for the establishment of a Dust-level sect were also the lowest: as long as the sect leader had reached the Foundation Establishment stage and could recruit ten people, he could establish a sect.</p>

    <p>In addition, he only needed to pay the Huaxiu Alliance membership fee every ten years.</p>

    <p>But given Su Xing's dire straits, he already couldn't even meet the first criterion for the number of sect members required, let alone see if he could pay the Huaxiu Alliance membership fee, given the sect's current management situation...</p>

    <p>And Su Xing's next sentence completely confirmed Lu Youming's conjecture.</p>

    <p>Su Xing: "Ha ha, I'm the only one left in our Palm Sect now... If I don't solve the problem of sect numbers before I pay the fee, Palm Sect will disappear."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>"May I ask, what does your sect do?"</p>

    <p>"We're the Palm Sect, so of course, we clap," said Su Xing. "Applauding is also hard work - you can't have people not clapping when leaders make speeches on major occasions, so our Palm Sect specializes in this."</p>

    <p>After Su Xing said this, realization dawned on everyone. "... So you're a water army paid to clap."</p>

    <p>"Think of it however you like."</p>

    <p>Unconcerned, Su Xing shook his head and scratched his itchy crew cut - it had already been a while since he last bathed.</p>

    <p>"How come you're the only one left in Palm Sect..." Someone was curious.</p>

    <p>"A celebrity previously requested that we go applaud for him, and wanted the five of us to create the effect of a magnificent army. The other four clapped so hard that they died. After that, I was the only one left..."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>At that moment, Su Xing gazed at the arena. "So, can I go up? I'm counting on selling this first-class holy artifact to pay off my debts and make a comeback."</p>

    <p>"Of course..."</p>

    <p>Wang Han cleared his throat. "Sir, you can make the first move..."</p>

    <p>"Oh!"</p>

    <p>No sooner had Wang Han said the words when Su Xing's figure instantly disappeared! He was so fast that no one present saw him clearly.</p>

    <p>No one had expected a Dust-level sect leader to actually be this strong!</p>

    <p>When Su Xing reappeared, he was already in front of Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch.</p>

    <p>With a sound like the clap of thunder, his palm whistled through the air, headed straight for Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch's face...</p>

    <p>The power of Heavenly Dao?</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch wore an unruffled expression, but the moment the palm came at him, he had already turned serious inside.</p>
