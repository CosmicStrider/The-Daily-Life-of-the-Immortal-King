  <h1>Chapter 239 Open the Door! Let Jingke Out! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Dharmaraja actually knew very well that there were in fact plenty of experts in the cultivation circle who preferred to retreat behind the scenes. Just like how there would be people in the secular world who would give up all fame and fortune for the sake of pursuing immortality, it was natural that there would be old seniors in the cultivation circle who envied the ordinary life of a common person and planned instead to live in seclusion.</p>

    <p>These reclusive seniors generally felt that in the end, the path of cultivation was an empty one — a long life was meaningless, and there were times you would become tired of living.</p>

    <p>The most terrible thing of all would be if you truly couldn't die or be killed.</p>

    <p>The reason why Dharmaraja admired Father Wang so much was that this senior had completely chosen to assimilate into the secular world and had penetrated deep to the very bottom of society as a way to make money and live in the ordinary world.</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja felt that he wouldn't have been able to do it. Many cultivators had jobs in the ordinary world, but most of them worked for peers in the cultivation circle. For example, he used the godly thunder inheritance to repair magic artifacts, and he earned in cultivators' coin.</p>

    <p>But with just one book, Father Wang had been able to kill two birds with one stone. Dharmaraja found this particularly astonishing.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, a great senior was in the end a great senior, who shone wherever he went!</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja respectfully picked up the tea which Grandfather Wang had given him. When he saw his face reflected in the steaming tea, he was instantly silent.</p>

    <p>He knew that when Lord Diulei had visited the Wang family's small villa, Grandfather Wang had given him a bowl of tomato egg drop soup and a broccoli — to this day, the other man had yet to uncover the meaning of Tao in them. Now, this old senior had given him a cup of tea... what did this tea mean?</p>

    <p>The scene fell into silence. Unwilling to drink the tea, Dharmaraja stared blankly and quietly at it for a long time.</p>

    <p>He wanted to take this cup of tea back with him and study it...</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja sat in the Wang family's small villa until noon. Looking at the time, Mother Wang would be returning any minute now with groceries, so the old man had insisted that Dharmaraja stay for lunch. Overwhelmed by the old man's invitation, Dharmaraja hadn't dared refuse.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It wasn't long when Dharmaraja noticed the noise at the door and saw a woman carrying several bags of groceries open the door and shut it behind her quickly like a spy.</p>

    <p>The old man was startled by the noise. "What's going on?"</p>

    <p>Listening at the door, Mother Wang made a shushing gesture and whispered, "Dad, I think someone's following me."</p>

    <p>"Following you?" Grandfather Wang frowned.</p>

    <p>"Yes." Mother Wang nodded. "It felt like it was for quite a while. I already sensed it when I was shopping, like a pair of eyes staring at me non-stop."</p>

    <p>After saying this, she turned to look at Dharmaraja. "Eh? Who are you?"</p>

    <p>"I'm here especially to deliver a spirit sword which I fixed for Senior Ling, as he requested. I am very glad to meet the seniors, it's nice to meet you!" Dharmaraja bowed to Mother Wang.</p>

    <p>Mother Wang suddenly understood. "So you're Dharmaraja! Ling Ling's mentioned you!"</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja was very moved, and a thin layer of moisture fogged up his goggles. He hadn't expected that Senior Ling would in his life ever mention him to the other great seniors! What kind of glorious honor was this?!</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja wiped excitedly at his tears. Seeing Mother Wang look outside worriedly, he also took a look through his goggles with his Heavenly Eye and discovered a figure sneaking around on the roadside. "Seniors, I see him!"</p>

    <p>That person was wearing a pair of sunglasses and a gray windbreaker, and there was a dangerous aura around him.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The man in sunglasses instantly raised his head as soon as Dharmaraja's Heavenly Eye locked onto him. He was fully aware that he had been found, but he didn't show the slightest panic.</p>

    <p>His gaze was bland when he met Dharmaraja's eyes. A few seconds later, Dharmaraja opened his eyes in shock. "Ah! Not good!"</p>

    <p>The other party's return gaze had forced him to take several steps back, and when he took off his goggles, Dharmaraja realized that his eyes were bleeding! — This was an expert!</p>

    <p>"Looks like it's a master." Grandfather Wang sighed quietly.</p>

    <p>It was very clear that the person who had been following Mother Wang wasn't anyone good.</p>

    <p>"Damn it..." Dharmaraja took out a pill which he had on him for calming fluctuations of spirit energy and quickly swallowed it. Then he used the godly thunder inheritance to protect his injured eyes.</p>

    <p>He realized that the man outside not only had formidable strength, he was also very cunning. The attack from the other man's gaze just now had directly pierced his head, straightaway numbing his visual nerves and causing intermittent bleeding.</p>

    <p>If it hadn't been for the pill and the godly thunder inheritance, Dharmaraja felt that if it had been someone else, their Heavenly Eye would have been crippled!</p>

    <p>After this first exchange, Dharmaraja could already gauge the other person's strength. He had already lost in a battle of auras and knew that this wasn't a fight he could win at his level.</p>

    <p>Moreover, he had noticed that this man's Heavenly Eye was very unusual and gave off a strong repelling force! Although he couldn't be one hundred percent sure, Dharmaraja felt that the man had probably refined his Heavenly Eye into a magic weapon, thus increasing its lethality.</p>

    <p>As for this method of turning a body part into a magic weapon, he had heard from Lord Diulei in the chat group that this was practiced by a dark force that recently had been looking for trouble with Senior Wang's family.</p>

    <p>So he confirmed that this man was probably from Immortal Mansion.</p>

    <p>But now... what to do?</p>

    <p>Did the seniors in the Wang family's small villa have to deal with it personally now?</p>

    <p>As Dharmaraja sat on the floor to catch his breath, he turned to look at Grandfather Wang and sighed softly. "I'm sorry, senior! This man is really too strong!"</p>

    <p>He was a little upset because he had wanted to show off his strength in front of so many seniors.</p>

    <p>"No, you've already done very well." The old man smiled faintly. "You are our guest. Besides, the man's objective is obviously us. We should solve this problem ourselves."</p>

    <p>The old man's voice dropped in tone, and had a magnetic quality to it.</p>

    <p>At the moment, Wang Ling was participating in the school's military training, and even Er Ha had been picked up by their teacher-in-charge and wouldn't be back for a while.</p>

    <p>Perhaps in the eyes of those who had ulterior motives when it came to the Wang family, this was the perfect time to cause trouble.</p>

    <p>"Dad..." At this moment, father and daughter-in-law exchanged looks and had the same thought.</p>

    <p>"There's no other way..."</p>

    <p>The old man sighed in his heart. Since the other party had deliberately come to make trouble, then a fight couldn't be avoided.</p>

    <p>With his hands behind his back and his gaze lowered, there was a sense of something mysterious in his eyes.</p>

    <p>Was Old Senior Wang about to make a move?</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja was extremely awed.</p>

    <p>However, he realized that things weren't that simple.</p>

    <p>Grandfather Wang went quietly to the door and put his hand on the doorknob.</p>

    <p>Almost the instant he opened it, the old man quickly looked up toward the second floor and shouted with strong resolve, "Open the door! Let Jingke out!"</p>

    <p>Before Dharmaraja could regain his senses, he saw a brown sword shadow fly out of the front door of the Wang family's small villa with a whoosh like a firework.</p>
