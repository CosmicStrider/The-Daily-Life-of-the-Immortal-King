  <h1>Chapter 451 How to Verify Evil Sword God's Identity? </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Usually at this time, Warden Liang would have long gotten off work and returned home, but he didn't dare to do so. That was because he had received a call from Zhuo Yi earlier on saying that General Yi would be coming. The problem was that General Yi hadn't specified a time, so Warden Liang could only wait, which had left him feeling ill at ease all day.</p>

    <p>It was plain to see that General Yi really wanted to handle this matter as quietly as possible and didn't want it to get out.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Warden Liang was also very doubtful...</p>

    <p>Was that youngster they had arrested really Evil Sword God?</p>

    <p>He didn't dare believe it...</p>

    <p>After all, that was a person who had gained notoriety as the number one devil well before the old devil. After murdering his own <em>shifu </em>, Evil Sword God's infamy had spread far and wide in previous generations of the cultivation circle.</p>

    <p>Over the last several hundred years after that, it was as if Evil Sword God had faded from public view, but in fact there would be several cases every year of swordmasters all over the country being mysteriously killed. These cases all had one thing in common: all the victims had died from the same sword qi...</p>

    <p>These cases were all on file and still remained unsolved.</p>

    <p>Those familiar with Evil Sword God would naturally be able to guess who was behind these incidents. In the last century, General Yi had never stopped looking for traces of this stupid junior brother of this, but Evil Sword God was really too cunning.</p>

    <p>After one hundred years of hide and seek, he was suddenly captured... Anyone's scalp would feel numb at this news.</p>

    <p>This was Evil Sword God...</p>

    <p>How could it be so easy to deal with him?</p>

    <p>However, Zhuo Yi as the main person-in-charge had already given an official explanation: Evil Sword God had been arrested by a great senior at Secretary Dakang's request.</p>

    <p>As someone with so many years of experience, Warden Liang's analysis of this cryptic answer was that it was definitely an exaggeration.</p>

    <p>It was probably only half-true...</p>

    <p>While he was pondering this, the prison officer guarding the entrance gave him an internal call.</p>

    <p>Warden Liang instantly knew that General Yi had most likely arrived, and he picked up the phone. "Have General Yi wait in the reception hall first, then notify the administration department and have them bring him here."</p>

    <p>The guard nodded. "Understood."</p>

    <p>Suddenly, Warden Liang was struck by something, and he hurriedly asked, "By the way, help me check the special prison cell as well as the situation of the other two."</p>

    <p>The old devil and the Master of Immortal Mansion Cheng Yu had been put in detention for beating up Evil Sword God in the prison cell.</p>

    <p>If nothing unexpected happened, Warden Liang guessed that these two were now planting vegetables in the prison's back garden; they had to plant ten thousand seeds before they were done.</p>

    <p>With the Spirit Shackles on, they couldn't cycle spirit energy as usual and were no different to regular people, so planting ten thousand seeds was actually a little difficult.</p>

    <p>Warden Liang wasn't able to verify whether or not the youngster that had been captured was truly Evil Sword God, but if it was true, then as warden, he couldn't not do anything.</p>

    <p>It was true that Evil Sword God had committed many types of evil; you could say he would fit right in here.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>General Yi didn't wait long in the reception hall before Warden Liang rushed over with a team; behind him were a dozen or so prison officers, which looked quite extravagant.</p>

    <p>"Greetings, General Yi."</p>

    <p>The moment Warden Liang saw the old man with hedgehog hair, he immediately put on a smile.</p>

    <p>General Yi nodded and then floated down to sit in a chair as he crossed his arms. "Forget the courtesy... get rid of that bunch behind you first, and then show this old man the evidence you obtained last night."</p>

    <p>"Very well!" Warden Liang waved his hand and dismissed the people behind him, then he took out an evidence bag and directly pulled the Heaven-Cleaving sword out of it.</p>

    <p>Taking the proffered sword, General Yi narrowed his eyes as he carefully examined it. Honestly speaking, the instant Warden Liang had taken it out of the bag, General Yi had already known in his heart that it was without doubt the genuine article.</p>

    <p>Putting aside the fact that this sword's appearance was exactly the same as in his memory, the sword qi wrapped around it was also extremely nostalgic.</p>

    <p>"It really is the Heaven-Cleaving sword..." General Yi whispered in his heart.</p>

    <p>Warden Liang caught the slight change in General Yi's expression. "General Yi, is there something wrong with this sword?"</p>

    <p>"No, this is the real sword! It is indeed the same as the one in my memory. This was the sword that my <em>shizun </em>Fan Rui used back then," General Yi said honestly.</p>

    <p>He lifted his head to look at Warden Liang. "When that youngster was caught earlier, did he have any tattoos?"</p>

    <p>"We've already done an inspection, and his entire body is clean; there weren't any tattoos." Warden Liang shook his head. "However..."</p>

    <p>"However what?" General Yi frowned.</p>

    <p>Warden Liang said, "According to Director Zhuo Yi, the tattoos on this person only disappeared after he was defeated. Before that, not only did he have tattoos, he also had dark eye shadow."</p>

    <p>The corners of General Yi's mouth twitched... Hearing this, he was more or less certain that this youngster was without doubt his stupid junior brother.</p>

    <p>The reason why the Heaven-Cleaving sword was so powerful was because of its dark and chaotic character. General Yi remembered that it had taken his <em>shifu</em>Fan Rui a lot of effort to subdue the sword back then.</p>

    <p>At this thought, General Yi said gloomily, "To seize control of this sword, my junior brother Evil Sword God didn't have any qualms using forbidden spells to forcefully change the contract... in the end, the dark and chaotic power of the Heaven-Cleaving sword invaded his body, turning him evil. The tattoo and eye shadow were signs of that."</p>

    <p>Warden Liang: "Then the person inside... is really Evil Sword God?"</p>

    <p>"It appears so..."</p>

    <p>General Yi sighed. "My junior brother had always been someone who thought highly of himself, but he wasn't someone who would wilfully slaughter the innocent. After considering it carefully, I believe he had already been planning to grab the sword since the hostage case, after losing himself to the dark and chaotic power that had invaded his body."</p>

    <p>Upon saying that, General Yi floated out of the chair and looked at Warden Liang. "Let's go, take this old man to see him! I'll verify his identity one last time..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Several minutes later, the two of them appeared at the special prison jail. The youngster who had been unconscious earlier had already come back to his senses. He had a panicked expression on his face and shrunk back into a corner as he trembled with fright.</p>

    <p>"Who are you? Why did you arrest me? My <em>shifu </em>, my <em>shifu </em>is Sword Immortal Fan Rui!" The youngster screamed.</p>

    <p>Outside the room, General Yi narrowed his eyes. "How long has he been like this?"</p>

    <p>Warden Liang answered, "He's been like this since he woke up. Director Zhuo also came by earlier and said that he's completely different to what he had been like in battle... I had someone examine him, as our initial suspicions were that he had multiple personality disorder."</p>

    <p>"Hm."</p>

    <p>General Yi nodded his head. "Let me test him then..."</p>

    <p>After saying that, General Yi directly threw the Heaven-Cleaving sword over.</p>

    <p>Warden Liang broke out in a sweat. "General Yi, this..."</p>

    <p>General Yi pinched his moustache. "Calm down, he's in Spirit Shackles and can't use his spirit energy."</p>

    <p>After a few minutes, the youngster shaking in the corner eventually gathered up his courage to grab the sword off the floor.</p>

    <p>Then, Warden Liang felt like he was seeing a completely different person. The youngster pointed the tip of the sword at General Yi and laughed loudly. "Yi Jianchuan! I, Evil Sword God, am here. Let me out, and we'll have a showdown!"</p>

    <p>"We'll have a showdown..."</p>

    <p>"Have a showdown..."</p>

    <p>"A showdown..."</p>

    <p>"Showdown..."</p>

    <p>"...Down..."</p>

    <p>"..." Warden Liang was stupefied. ⊙∀⊙?!</p>

    <p>At the same time, General Yi couldn't help rubbing his head as he listened; while he had gotten his confirmation, he was also a little ashamed...</p>

    <p>This dumbass!</p>
