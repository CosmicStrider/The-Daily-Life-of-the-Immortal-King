  <h1>Chapter 306 Ling Zhenren's Exclusive Sealed Lips Package </h1>

  <div>

    <p>The construction of an intrinsic spirit field was actually a complicated procedure, and the key was the spirit energy source. This source could be regarded as the trunk of a tree, out of which grew many complicated and forked branch routes. In addition to the spirit energy source, modeling of the environment was also a critical element.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had carefully done the calculations and come up with his own conclusions during the previous confrontation with the silver unicorn as well as through careful observation of the intrinsic spirit field discharged by Cheng Yu, Master of Immortal Mansion.</p>

    <p>He could solve the difficult exercises in <em>On Talismans </em>in three minutes; analyzing the formula for constructing the intrinsic spirit field was also only just a matter of minutes.</p>

    <p>Cheng Yu fell to his knees in despair, white as a sheet. He couldn't use any Dao talismans when trapped inside someone else's intrinsic spirit field. Unless he had a powerful magic treasure to destroy the spirit field, he knew that there was already no way for him to escape.</p>

    <p>Besides, what could he do with his badly injured body?</p>

    <p>"Master of Immortal Mansion, do you have anything to say?" Lord Diulei said as he gazed at Cheng Yu.</p>

    <p>"I..." Cheng Yu opened his mouth, but couldn't say a single thing.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei looked at him calmly. "You have the right to remain silent; anything you say will be used against you in a court of law!"</p>

    <p>It could be said that all the people standing here were witnesses to the fall of Immortal Mansion. They had watched without sympathy as the hair of this spirit sword collector maniac had instantly white after he had been driven round the bend from his contracts with all his spirit swords being forcibly terminated. Jingke had already given this Master of Immortal Mansion the most appropriate punishment.</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren heaved a sigh. Dealing with this master as well as the mess which Immortal Mansion had left in its wake was now another big problem.</p>

    <p>Lawyers would also be required outside Immortal Mansion to determine the nature of this group of female disciples. They had been abducted and brought in as children, but while their ignorance could be forgiven, Cailian Zhenren's guess was that they would at least be sent to labor camps.</p>

    <p>But then again, even though they lacked a lot of knowledge about modern cultivation and had very limited understanding of modern society, each of these inner sect female disciples who had been educated in isolation had potential.</p>

    <p>This was a huge Soul Formation resource. If used properly, it could become a new force for their national military.</p>

    <p>Before becoming the manager of Lord Diulei's cultivation forum, Cailian Zhenren had been in the Women's Special Forces for a while.</p>

    <p>In her opinion, if this group of female disciples were sent for training, by next year, they could film a <em>Phoenix Nirvana <sup>1</sup> </em>drama.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is a Chinese drama about
a women's special operations
force ..)</dfn>

    <p>"Brother Ling, is there any way to constrain him?" Lord Diulei was still a little uneasy.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded and raised his hands to cast the Great Sealed Lips Spell.</p>

    <p>A very long time ago, when cultivators used techniques, they had to recite chants in addition to performing the hand seals, which thus gave rise to the "Great Sealed Lips Spell." This trick not only sealed the mouth, but also blocked the release of spirit energy in the body, thus acting like a true gag order.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, however, actually enhanced the spell when he cast it, by removing the "sealed lips" rule. This was to prevent the Master of Immortal Mansion from feigning death in subsequent interrogations.</p>

    <p>Ling Zhenren was the only one to own this exclusive sealed lips package.</p>

    <p>Cheng Yu knelt on the ground, genuinely terrified.</p>

    <p>As Master of Immortal Mansion, his knowledge and experiences weren't superficial. He could see at a glance that the teenager in front of him was casting one of the Three Thousand Great Spells on him.</p>

    <p>It was actually the Three Thousand Great Spells...</p>

    <p>These were the most powerful spells that many cultivators yearned for and scrambled after! Even Immortal Mode and the White Night Spell couldn't compare.</p>

    <p>And what terrified Cheng Yu the most was that this Ling Zhenren was just too skillful, smooth and casual at casting the spell... He didn't even see him perform any hand seals! He could never learn this sort of operation in his entire life!</p>

    <p>What kind of person had he offended?</p>

    <p>"As expected, Brother Ling is amazing..." Lord Diulei heaved a sigh of relief. This way, the Master of Immortal Mansion wouldn't be able to escape by whatever means even if the intrinsic spirit field disappeared.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After that, Wang Ling saw Lord Diulei search the Master of Immortal Mansion before finally finding his spatial magic object for storing magic treasure. It was a token with three words on it —"Another Space Inside."</p>

    <p>Gazing at the token, Lord Diulei sighed. Then he glared at Cheng Yu. "Look at you. How much have you exploited over the years for the sake of your lousy swords?"</p>

    <p>Cheng Yu: "..."</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja: "Senior Immortal, are we handing these things over to the government?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Well... we'll definitely hand them over. But there are some resources that I think we can make use of, like the Dao talismans, the elixirs and so on. We also consumed quite a bit of them on this trip. I think it's only appropriate that we replenish our supplies a little. What do you think? Shall we do an inventory check?"</p>

    <p>Except for Wang Ling, everyone said almost in unison, "We think that what Senior Immortal said makes sense!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Inside Wang Ling's intrinsic spirit field, a bunch of people were taking inventory of magic treasures under a palm tree, while Immortal Toya was still treating Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>After coming out of the intrinsic spirit field earlier, Fang Xing had fallen into a coma, and his condition was worse than Immortal Toya had imagined.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya had already dressed his wounds and had even fed him a few of his precious tonics which he had poured his blood, sweat and tears into refining over several months.</p>

    <p>However, although the bleeding had stopped, the teenager still didn't show any signs of waking up at all.</p>

    <p>"How is he?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling asked telepathically, raising an eyebrow.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya frowned, then shook his head. "I've done everything I can..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Very quickly, Immortal Toya realized how ambiguous his words sounded, and he hurriedly corrected himself. "...Erm, Ling Zhenren, don't misunderstand. I mean that I've already done whatever I can given our limited medical resources for now. To be honest, Brother Fang Xing's wound is a little unusual. For a normal sword wound, after the sword is pulled out, the sword qi wouldn't linger for so long and attack the meridians like this."</p>

    <p>When he said this, Immortal Toya frowned and cupped his chin. "Actually, I don't think this thing can be considered sword qi. It's like a stubborn worm constantly gnawing at Brother Fang Xing's meridians. Furthermore, it's suppressing the production of spirit energy, so the spirit energy is unable to circulate inside his body. This is also the main reason for his coma."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling frowned and opened his Heavenly Eye to scan Fang Xing's body. Just as Immortal Toya had said, he found the mysterious qi flowing through his veins — this wasn't sword qi.</p>

    <p>Generating spirit light in his hand, Wang Ling tried to remove it with the Great Purification Spell, but unexpectedly was unable to do so...</p>

    <p>As expected, did it have something to do with the Heavenly Materials sword?</p>

    <p>As Wang Ling considered this, his eyes suddenly swept over Cheng Yu, who was on his knees, and this Master of Immortal Mansion immediately quivered with fear.</p>
