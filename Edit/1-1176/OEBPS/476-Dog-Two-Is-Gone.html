  <h1>Chapter 476 Er Ha Is Gone </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wei Zhi and Er Ha chatted online for a long time that day. After talking for about an hour, Wei Zhi remembered that they hadn't friended each other yet on their cell phone chat app! They had been chatting in a private chat window all this time.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi now had seventeen contractual spirit beasts under him. In addition to Pushing Large Butterfly, he had nine medium-sized spirit beasts, and the remaining seven were all big ones... the pressure on him was quite intense.</p>

    <p>He was relying on award money from winning various spirit beast competitions arranged by the Pet Trainers Guild and from his job of power-leveling others, and he was even moonlighting as a spellmaster exclusively for spirit beasts. But the money from all this was just barely enough to cover the cost of food. On the other hand, he still needed to pay the monthly electricity bill as well as for supplements to boost his own physical strength.</p>

    <p>Unlike cultivators chasing sage realms who didn't need to eat, it took a lot of physical strength and energy for a pet trainer to train a spirit beast!</p>

    <p>After Er Ha and Wei Zhi friended each other on the chat app, Wei Zhi quickly sent a group photo of his Pet Trainers Guild. In the photo, he was standing right at the front of the group. He wasn't tall and he was pretty fair, so Er Ha picked him out at a glance.</p>

    <p>But it didn't understand why Wei Zhi had sent it this picture...</p>

    <p>"Saw it?" Wei Zhi asked.</p>

    <p>Er Ha nodded. "Yes, I see you..."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "Not me, I meant the fellow in the middle of the first row wearing leather and black sunglasses."</p>

    <p>Er Ha followed Wei Zhi's instructions and found the person he was talking about. This guy's outfit was actually quite chic and modern, completely unlike a cultivator's style - in an era of national cultivation, it wasn't anything strange to see people walking down the streets in traditional attire.</p>

    <p>But usually it was bigwigs like General Yi and those people who, except for public events where they would wear their military uniforms, would dress in the traditional style during their everyday lives.</p>

    <p>Of course, Er Ha thought that this could be a little misleading.</p>

    <p>After all, its Little Master Ling always wore the school uniform...</p>

    <p>Er Ha stared at the fellow in leather. "Who is this person?"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi sighed and said, "He is the Crying Old Immortal I told you about, the vice president of our Pet Trainers Guild. You can see that he's already bald..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>"Our line of work really isn't easy. Too tiring! While most pet trainers enjoy it, it's a real drain on strength and energy! Now that we live in an era of peace, there's nothing for cultivators to fight about... take-out and delivery employees clearly have it easier than us."</p>

    <p>Each profession had its own difficulties, but what Wei Zhi said actually wasn't wrong.</p>

    <p>In an era of national cultivation, basic magic like flying a sword had already long become a common thing. As long as a person could fly a sword, it was in fact quite easy to be a take-out or delivery employee.</p>

    <p>And it was very important to note that the pay in these industries was actually quite high.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi sighed and typed plaintively: "Look at our vice president, Crying Old Immortal. He formed too many contracts with spirit beasts when he was younger and in the end didn't take care of his own nourishment... he directly became bald!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, Wei Zhi felt a bit bitter in his heart.</p>

    <p>He thought of the old man Ma Dongmei meme which was trending online now.</p>

    <p>It was of an old man smiling as he said: Actually, I don't think there's much pressure on pet trainers. Then the words on the side were: A Songhai city 28-year-old professional pet trainer...</p>

    <p>To put it bluntly, many reasons for baldness were actually related to stress.</p>

    <p>Everyone had stress...</p>

    <p>Take Er Ha as an example. Except for Little Master Ling who was preparing for the midterm exams, the most stressed person around it was Father Wang.</p>

    <p>Online authors couldn't stop updating, and also had to deal with trolls and anti-fans, so they were naturally very stressed! Even though readers were generally better now, there were still exceptions.</p>

    <p>For example, one of Father Wang's colleagues who wrote a historical novel, a person called "Teacher Of Water From The Mountains," had had to delay updates when his house had caught fire, and trolls had still cursed him and pressed him for updates. Er Ha thought that this was very uneducated behavior and made them less than even a dog like it!</p>

    <p>Over the years, the pressure on Father Wang had also intensified with the pick up in the rate of his updates, and he would frequently drop hair in the shower.</p>

    <p>Stress along with age would cause his hairline to recede and make him bald.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, when he realized what was happening, forget Bawang shampoo<sup>1</sup>, even One Piece Conqueror's Haki<sup>2</sup> shampoo already wasn't of any use!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The shampoo brand that Jackie Chan used to endorse, one of which claims anti-hair fall.)</dfn>
    
    <br/>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(In the series 'One Piece,' it's said that whoever possesses this type of rare power to dominate the will of others has the qualities of a king.)</dfn>

    <p>Of course, Father Wang perhaps didn't need to worry about going bald...</p>

    <p>In terms of growing hair, Wang Ling could casually touch it and directly turn a lawn into a forest... This was a lot more convenient compared with a live streamer called Sun Yalong who had spent a massive amount of money in particular on hair transplants!</p>

    <p>Where there was stress, it naturally needed a release outlet.</p>

    <p>Cultivating the power of Sword Dao through the inheritance talisman brought with it tremendous internal spiritual pressure. Er Ha only dared to absorb a little at a time, but it was very obvious that a balance between work and rest was very important for smoothly inheriting the power of the "ten-meter sword circle" inside the inheritance talisman from Little Master Ling.</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, Er Ha directly sent Wei Zhi a text. "Brother, shall we meet later? Go out to destress?"</p>

    <p>On the other side of the screen, Wei Zhi's eyes lit up at once.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was July 15th on Saturday in the twelfth week of the semester.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan's Dao talismans exam and the maths exam had already been held at school on Friday yesterday.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that his scores for these two courses would be alright. He had already predicted what the topics would be beforehand and had prepared sufficiently for them. Controlling his marks to get the class average shouldn't be a problem.</p>

    <p>Then Monday was Lao Gudong's history exam and the political science exam.</p>

    <p>The teachers for these two courses in particular liked to keep up with the times; Wang Ling felt that the recent "Immortal Mansion incident" and "the Demon Hunters Association incident" would be used as discussion topics, or even expanded into a series of topics. But even then, the scope was still a little too big; who knew what kind of fanciful things these two teachers would come up with?</p>

    <p>Hence, Wang Ling felt it was a waste of time thinking about it; he could only see how things went during the exam itself.</p>

    <p>He hadn't forgotten to draw up the contract with Xiao Yin. In fact, when Xiao Yin had come all the way the last time to deliver blood, Wang Ling had wanted to create the contract then. But after all, Xiao Yin had just given blood then, and Wang Ling hadn't been in a hurry.</p>

    <p>Whether it was a spirit beast or a holy beast, they had to ensure that they were completely healthy before they entered into a contract.</p>

    <p>That was because when a spirit beast (holy beast) agreed to a contract, it would consume a lot of its spiritual strength.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling knew that Er Ha and Xiao Yin had friended each other online and it seemed that they were quite chatty.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was going to ask Er Ha about Xiao Yin's situation, but when he turned around, he discovered that Er Ha unexpectedly wasn't at home.</p>

    <p>He looked up at the clock. It was nine thirty in the morning.</p>

    <p>Father Wang was writing, Mother Wang was doing some cleaning, the old man was in the backyard gardening... where had Er Ha run off to by itself?</p>
