  <h1>Chapter 201 An Arrow Piercing the Sky... </h1>

  <div>

    <p>In some sense, Killer Taoist and Wang Ming were actually quite similar in character. They both liked to challenge the limits, and while the target that Wang Ming was obsessed with challenging was everyone's Ling Zhenren, the target of Killer Taoist's challenge obsession was his master Lao Gudong.</p>

    <p>The reason why they were similar was because they had one thing in common — they had never once won!</p>

    <p>Looking at senior brother who was in neutral position in front of him, Bandit Evil had been frightened into dropping the flip-flops. He squeezed his blinded eyes tightly shut. He was just an innocent little virgin, why did his eyes have to endure such a piercing image?! Master, come and save me! There's a pervert here, it's your senior disciple!</p>

    <p>Killer Taoist put his flip-flops back on and pulled up his pants with pride. He wasn't the least bit repentant about corrupting their sect's principles. "Junior brother, do you know, I've been looking for a way to defeat shifu all this time. After fumbling around all these years, I finally understand why I've lost to him time and time again."</p>

    <p>Bandit Evil raised his head. "?"</p>

    <p>Killer Taoist: "It was this pair of floral underpants that had been obstructing my way forward!"</p>

    <p>Bandit Evil: "..."</p>

    <p>Killer Taoist: "As the number one killer, how can I be defeated by this addiction? So letting myself hang free was the best solution I could think of."</p>

    <p>Bandit Evil: "..."</p>

    <p>Killer Taoist: "Anyway, what is it that shifu wants us to do?"</p>

    <p>Bandit Evil: "It's the students whom shifu is currently teaching. Now that the whereabouts of the Master of Shadow Stream Jiang Liuyue are unaccounted for, master is worried that this person will organize for killers to come to the school to take revenge. If they really were to act, they would definitely do it quietly; shifu is worried that the kids will fall prey to some trap."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Killer Taoist nodded. "So, shifu wants us to give those people a warning?"</p>

    <p>Bandit Evil nodded. "That would be the best way; shifu has already withdrawn into the background for a hundred years, and he doesn't want outsiders to disturb this calm..."</p>

    <p>Killer Taoist lowered his head and his eyes turned dark. "Got it."</p>

    <p>He took off one of his flip-flops and pulled out a fuse from a crack in the heel. Holding one end, he pulled it suddenly, and with a whistle, clusters of fiery red light instantly scattered in the sky.</p>

    <p>"An arrow piercing the sky, and a thousand troops and ten thousand horses will come<sup>1</sup>?" Bandit Evil was surprised. When had senior brother amassed so many subordinates?</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This line was made popular by the film "Kung Fu Hustle", &amp; basically means lighting a signal flare to call for help)</dfn>

    <p>"There are always hidden guards around a true grandmaster. It was on a sudden whim; I recruited two." Killer Taoist rubbed his nose, and just as he finished speaking, Bandit Evil suddenly saw two shadows drop abruptly from the sky in front of him; it was two men dressed in black with their faces covered, which made them look very mysterious.</p>

    <p>Bandit Evil: "Only two?"</p>

    <p>"That's right."</p>

    <p>Killer Taoist nodded, then turned to the masked men who had landed suddenly as he made the introductions. "One is codenamed Thousand Troops and the other is codenamed Ten Thousand Horses. They are the two subordinates whom I've just accepted as apprentices... I'll send them both out later to issue warnings to people in the murder industry one by one. Come on, say hello to your second martial uncle!"</p>

    <p>The two people saluted Bandit Evil with clasped fists. "Hello, second martial uncle!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Bandit Evil was speechless for a long time.</p>

    <p>He realized that there was a pit in his senior brother's brain<sup>2</sup>!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is a reference to the Chinese novel "There's a pit in my senior martial brother's brain")</dfn>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The combined military training for six schools this time wasn't a small event. Rather than say that this joint military training between several key city high schools and key city high school candidates was a coincidence, it was better to view it as a deliberate arrangement which had been planned early on.</p>

    <p>Everyone knew that Number 59 High School and Number 60 High School were both key city high school candidates. Having these two schools combine together to compete against four key city high schools was a big joke. Headmaster Chen of Number 60 High School and Headmaster Jin of Number 59 High School were from the same sect and both of them were sensitive about their reputations. Given their personalities, the main concern for these two brothers when they got together was to think up all kinds of ways to do things...</p>

    <p>It was June 13th on Monday in the eighth week of the semester.</p>

    <p>As soon as Teacher Pan entered the classroom early in the morning, she began to talk about points for attention related to the combined military training this time. Headmaster Chen and Headmaster Jin had spent the whole night designing a set of guidelines for the military training program's "survival drill" which the teachers-in-charge were required to disseminate in their classes.</p>

    <p>"I believe everyone understands the rules by now. This time, there are over ten thousand students from six schools. At the beginning of the drill, an array will send you to random locations on the map, and the person next to you could be a friend or could also be an enemy. But only the people who remain on the map in the end will win." Teacher Pan pushed up her glasses and said, "So wherever you land, make sure you open your eyes wide! Determine whether it's an ally or the enemy; don't hurt an ally by accident no matter what, or you will lose overall points!"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan: "What I'm telling you now is all important! Take it seriously! Let me tell you, there was a senior student who didn't listen carefully when I was explaining these points for attention, and during the college entrance exam, he filled in the wrong answer sheet and ended up having to repeat a year!"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan: "Also, when you land, magic treasures will randomly appear inside the buildings on the map, and you'll need to look for them yourselves. After you land, don't go looking for useless objects; if it's a weapon, pick it up first — only after that should you look for a storage bag! No matter how good a person's kungfu is, they'll also be afraid of a kitchen knife; close-range combat won't win against someone wielding a magic treasure!"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Su Xiao raised his hand weakly. "Then, teacher... what should someone do if their luck is bad and they don't have any magic treasures...?"</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan: "Do you still have to ask? Don't you know how to hide?"</p>

    <p>Su Xiao: "..."</p>

    <p>"Including Number 59 High School, our two schools have fewer than two thousand students in total who will be participating in the military training this time. If your luck is bad and you're in a situation where there are no magic treasures nearby which you can pick up, it's fine to find a place to hide; don't feed the enemy! Naturally, the best would be to wait until you can get allies to come over as support and bring you equipment. We must do whatever we can to survive — only then will we have greater battle strength in the end!"</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan said solemnly, "All in all, two words: lay low!"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>"There are only two ways to win this type of survival game... either you are as strong as the old devil who can sweep everything away, or you can lay low, don't be impulsive, and save your strength."</p>

    <p>Her hands on the lectern, Teacher Pan looked at the students in the classroom and said gravely, "To sum up in one sentence: hold steady, we can win<sup>3</sup>!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(Originally a system automated script in online games like League of Legends, this has become a popular catchphrase)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>That night, after coming back from school, Wang Ling discovered that the image which had been flashing through his mind previously had become increasingly clear.</p>

    <p>His Heavenly Eye had foreseen a man lying in a pool of blood before. Now, he could confirm for sure that this man was Lord Diulei. He was also very certain that the place the other man was lying in was the back garden of that Wenxian Garden villa.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was suddenly worried for that guy's safety.</p>

    <p>He remembered that he had previously sent him a set of long johns, but he didn't know whether that guy was wearing them or not...</p>
