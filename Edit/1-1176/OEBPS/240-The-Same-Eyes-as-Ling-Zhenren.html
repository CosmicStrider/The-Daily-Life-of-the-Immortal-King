  <h1>Chapter 240 The Same Eyes as Ling Zhenren </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Ten minutes ago, a man in black sunglasses and a gray windbreaker had followed Mother Wang to the entrance of the Wang family's small villa. The man had a sturdy build and wore a beret on his bald head. At first glance, he looked a little like those brawny men in foreign films.</p>

    <p>"This is the place." The man narrowed his eyes slightly behind his sunglasses as he looked at the villa. He pulled open the lapel of his jacket to report the situation into the mike hidden inside. "Chief, I've already found the target location, and it's the same as what the Lady of the Castle said."</p>

    <p>The voice on the other end of the earphone was very low. "Well done, Little Tan. Check out the family's actual situation. Also, the best would be if you can clearly find out what their connection is to that hawthorn tree. This matter concerns my year-end review with the Master of the Mansion, so you mustn't be careless."</p>

    <p>The man nodded. "Don't worry, Chief."</p>

    <p>"According to a summary of the intelligence we collected from various parties, the youngster who fought Little Yue lives in that villa. It seems that he stopped the power of the fifty-fold gold crescent released by Little Yue's Abyss Avoidance with just one finger."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, the man couldn't help the few drops of cold sweat which ran down his forehead. The Little Yue whom the chief was referring to was the genius whom the Lord Master had selected out of ten thousand people to be a trusted aide. During Immortal Mansion's annual meeting back then, Lord Master had personally given Abyss Avoidance to Little Yue.</p>

    <p>This was a spirit sword with a speed that was ranked top on the historical cultivation list of spirit swords!</p>

    <p>"No matter what, you must be careful today. Apart from us, Immortal Mansion's southern, northern and western branches are currently searching for this family's whereabouts. The Lady of the Castle is a spy I had set up much earlier on. Since our eastern branch has obtained this information, we should make good use of it."</p>

    <p>The call ended at this point. The man straightened his beret and heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>Because before he had made the call, he had already used his spiritual senses to perceive that that terrifying teenager didn't seem to be in the villa today.</p>

    <p>But while he had been on the phone, there had been a reckless person inside the villa who had dared to use their Heavenly Eye on him. During the call with the branch chief, he had also opened his Heavenly Eye in retaliation and directly made the other party's eyes bleed.</p>

    <p>"Has their only fighting force disappeared?" The man looked at the villa with a sneer. The man who had looked at him with the Heavenly Eye was the only fighter he had sensed inside.</p>

    <p>Now that that person had been injured, the man was very certain that there were no other unpredictable elements in the villa.</p>

    <p>Did this mean he could do whatever he wanted on this mission?</p>

    <p>However, just as the man stepped toward the door of the Wang family's small villa...</p>

    <p>He noticed that it was actually open.</p>

    <p>Then, he saw a brown sword shadow fly out.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>How fast could a spirit sword be?</p>

    <p>The man called Little Tan felt that his three views were being refreshed at that moment.</p>

    <p>Because his eyes were very distinctive, he had chosen to refine them into a magic weapon the year he had joined Immortal Mansion. When he opened his Heavenly Eye, the power of his pupils was over ten times stronger than an ordinary Heavenly Eye and exhibited the fullest extent of dynamic sight.</p>

    <p>But when the brown sword shadow had streaked out the door, he was dumbstruck to discover that his eyes were unable to track it at all.</p>

    <p>The sword light closed in on him so quickly that he broke out in a cold sweat.</p>

    <p>But when the brown sword shadow was a dozen centimeters away from him, it stopped, and before his eyes, it broke down into faint specks of light that ultimately merged together again into a human figure.</p>

    <p>It was actually a child, with short gray bangs that danced in the wind and dressed in a brown tunic over a white robe, who stared at him coldly.</p>

    <p>Was this... a sword spirit?</p>

    <p>The man looked at this scene somewhat incredulously.</p>

    <p>A sword spirit couldn't appear unless its master was around to summon it through their contract. Otherwise, generally speaking, very few sword spirits had the self-awareness to manifest themselves. The man felt that he had miscalculated — he had only focused on sensing human auras and had overlooked situations like these in which the spirit of a magic weapon might appear.</p>

    <p>Whether it was the sword spirit of a spirit sword or the spirit of a magic weapon, before its real body manifested, this distinctive spirit body was easily overlooked since its aura would be restricted to its weapon vessel.</p>

    <p>But now wasn't the time to think so much.</p>

    <p>Jingke was already coming toward him.</p>

    <p>The man ramped up the power of his eyes to its fullest extent, and his pupils bloomed like a kaleidoscope. With the release of his Heavenly Eye's power, golden knife blades appeared in the air and ultimately merged together into a storm which thrust forward at Jingke like a rotating drill.</p>

    <p>These blades were made from the convergence of spirit energy from the world and from the universe through the power of the man's Heavenly Eye. As products of the spirit energy of heaven and earth, they didn't have destructive power in themselves, but they were exceptionally hard. Coupled with the storm created through the power of the man's eyes, it would be a devastating strike.</p>

    <p>At the shocking sight of this powerful force, Dharmaraja in the villa felt that if this attack hit him, it would leave a gaping hole in his body.</p>

    <p>In the face of this spirit light storm, Jingke's expression never changed. Maintaining his indifferent attitude, he walked step by step toward the center of the storm.</p>

    <p>From his line of sight in the villa, Dharmaraja could completely see Jingke's figure. He thought that the sword spirit's eyes were just like Ling Zhenren's!</p>

    <p>Ding ! Ding ! Ding ding ding ...</p>

    <p>The storm swallowed Jingke up, creating a violent collision, but all of it was blocked out by Jingke's sword light.</p>

    <p>The man was greatly shocked. He had never once thought that his attack wouldn't have the least bit effect at all; just like that, he could see how powerful this sword spirit was!</p>

    <p>He opened his Heavenly Eye wide and at the same time increased the power in his eyes, causing two streams of blood to run down from the corners.</p>

    <p>Jingke stood unmoving in the middle of the spirit light storm as he gazed at this scene.</p>

    <p>Then, with the sound of a snap, a brown sword light shone forth from Jingke's body.</p>

    <p>This scene was like a miracle descending. Jingke actually cut apart that terrifying spirit light storm with ease, as if he was parting the sea to create a safe passage down the middle.</p>

    <p>Seeing the man's flabbergasted expression, Jingke's own expression was unruffled as he walked slowly down that passage toward him.</p>

    <p>Finally, Jingke stopped in front of the man, and the difference in height was very stark.</p>

    <p>The man was built very sturdily and was one hundred and ninety centimeters tall, while Jingke wasn't tall at all as he only reached a point slightly above the man's waist.</p>

    <p>Whether from far or up close, this was just a child.</p>

    <p>However, even without an oppressive aura, just looking at the brown sword light on Jingke's body as the sword spirit approached him frightened the man so much that he had already broken out in a cold sweat. He was scared out of his wits, and even his knees couldn't help but tremble.</p>

    <p>He felt that his many years of cultivation had all been in vain— in a critical moment like this, it wasn't of any damn use!</p>
