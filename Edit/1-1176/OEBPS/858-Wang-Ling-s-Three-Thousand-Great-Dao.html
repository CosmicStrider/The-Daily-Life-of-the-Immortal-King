  <h1>Chapter 858 Wang Ling's Three Thousand Great Dao</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The enlightenment process wasn't as complicated as Er Ha had imagined.</p>

    <p>Book of Sage Immortal...</p>

    <p>Er Ha was reflecting on this name's meaning, which vaguely reminded it of Taoist scriptures. But Book of Sage Immortal now had Little Master Ling's Great Fortune Spell; that was to say, was this Book of Sage Immortal extremely lucky? Er Ha was wondering if it could use the iPad to place bets...</p>

    <p>This gave Er Ha a bold idea.</p>

    <p>But actually, it had to do with Wei Zhi, who was now Er Ha's friend. Because of the spirit beasts he was raising, Wei Zhi was fast becoming poor. So Er Ha had come up with a rotten idea previously, which was to have Wei Zhi go to the gym and take on several spirit beast challenges. Er Ha would then place bets and Wei Zhi himself would control the results.</p>

    <p>But Wei Zhi wouldn't do that.</p>

    <p>After all, his reputation would be damaged if he was found out.</p>

    <p>But with this iPad, Er Ha felt that Wei Zhi didn't even need to do anything and they could make money by placing bets on other pet trainers!</p>

    <p>With that in mind, Er Ha wagged its tail and crouched down cutely on the side.</p>

    <p>It had to be as obedient as possible in the next few days if it wanted Little Master Ling to give his consent!</p>

    <p>This was all for Wei Zhi!</p>

    <p>How did that saying go? A dog would do anything for a friend! Without hesitation!</p>

    <p>"My lord, please command me." Book of Sage Immortal opened its mouth.</p>

    <p>Using his Memory Sketch Skill, Wang Ling quickly drew an image of Gu Shunzhi and said telepathically to Book of Sage Immortal, "I want all the information on this person in one minute."</p>

    <p>"Understood, my lord! Just give me thirty seconds!"</p>

    <p>Book of Sage Immortal nodded, then its body emitted a golden light which was very soft and not at all piercing.</p>

    <p>On the thirtieth second, Book of Sage Immortal's light disappeared. "My lord, I have looked for traces of this person in this universe. Gu Shunzhi is a person from this seventh universe, from the year 5800. According to the timeline, this person is related to Gu Cheng, the young master of the Gu family on Nine-fold Domain of the Gods. He is Gu Cheng's legitimate son."</p>

    <p>1,400 years later...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling lowered his head, lost in thought.</p>

    <p>A person from 1,400 years in the future. Furthermore, he was indeed related to the Domain of the Gods.</p>

    <p>Obviously, just finding out who he was wasn't helpful; Wang Ling still didn't know what the other party's objective was.</p>

    <p>Book of Sage Immortal: "My lord, would you like me to expand my search range?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha was shaken. "It can still be expanded? Woof?"</p>

    <p>"This is just information from the seventh universe, and doesn't mean that there aren't traces of Gu Shunzhi in other universes," Book of Sage Immortal replied in a measured way. "Additionally, according to the information obtained from the timeline, this person's father is powerful, and is the second strongest in the Domain of the Gods. The strongest is his grandfather, whose Daoist name is Star Monarch Gu Yuan. But Star Monarch Gu Yuan embarked on interstellar travel a long time ago, so all Gu family matters are handled by Gu Shunzhi's father Gu Cheng. But Gu Cheng isn't married right now."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sweated. "..." Unexpectedly, the situation was a lot more complicated than he had imagined.</p>

    <p>Generally speaking, most of the people who traveled back to the past from the future wanted to correct a past mistake. But this was risky, because correcting a past mistake could affect the sequence of events in the future. You might fix one mistake, but this might lead to the appearance of even more mistakes. This was Time Heavenly Dao's "butterfly effect."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling also had methods for going back in time, but he hardly used them. Even if he went back in time, he wouldn't choose to go back very far. If he made a mistake, going back 30 seconds was enough... This duration of 1,400 years was a little long.</p>

    <p>But Gu Cheng wasn't married yet, and after coming back to the past, Gu Shunzhi didn't go to Nine-fold Star either.</p>

    <p>Then, Gu Shunzhi's purpose for coming here...</p>

    <p>Could it be possible that it was for Wang Ling?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was at a loss.</p>

    <p>"Keep investigating."</p>

    <p>He frowned and spoke telepathically to Book of Sage Immortal.</p>

    <p>"Very well, my Lord. This time, I will need five minutes to search the other nine universes in one go," Book of Sage Immortal said.</p>

    <p>"Wait! You said that Gu Cheng is very strong! Then how strong is he? As strong as our little master? Woof?" Er Ha asked.</p>

    <p>Book of Sage Immortal was silent, and then stared at Er Ha with a pair of fish eyes. "Gu Cheng is a powerful person who was also born with three thousand Dao."</p>

    <p>Er Ha was alarmed.</p>

    <p>He was actually also born with three thousand Dao...</p>

    <p>Were these three thousand Dao a freebie given away now when you bought eggs at the supermarket?</p>

    <p>Er Ha felt that Little Master Ling's strength was already very terrifying!</p>

    <p>Now there was this Gu Cheng...</p>

    <p>He was also born with three thousand Dao - could he be as powerful as Little Master Ling...</p>

    <p>But just as Er Ha was thinking this, Book of Sage Immortal said, "However, do you know why I can search the other nine universes for information?"</p>

    <p>"???"</p>

    <p>Er Ha shook its head, and was indeed puzzled.</p>

    <p>Although Er Ha had currently mastered the power of Sword Dao, which was also a type of Heavenly Dao, its understanding of Heavenly Dao was ultimately much more shallow compared with what its master knew. The only thing Er Ha knew was that according to the Heavenly Dao order of things, each universe shouldn't interfere with each other, reasonably speaking - but Book of Sage Immortal could search for clues in the other universes, which indeed hugely astonished Er Ha.</p>

    <p>"Each of the ten universes has its own cosmic order; they have completely different stories and completely different worlds. There are even some universes where there's so little spirit energy that ordinary people make up the majority of that universe, while cultivators can only struggle to survive in the cracks." Book of Sage Immortal said, "Thus, the Three Thousand Great Dao in each universe are different. Great Dao evolves out of the truth of the universe, and the cosmic order determines what the Great Dao will be.</p>

    <p>"Gu Cheng is innately powerful. He was born at the tail end of the seventh universe and was acknowledged by the seventh universe. So when he was born, he already had the Three Thousand Great Dao. But the Heavenly Dao that Gu Cheng has mastered is limited to the seventh universe."</p>

    <p>At that point, Er Ha's eyes opened wide; it seemed to already know what Book of Sage Immortal was going to say.</p>

    <p>But this conclusion was so mind-blowing that its entire being was petrified.</p>

    <p>Book of Sage Immortal's fish eyes were fixed on Er Ha. "So... do you understand?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha slowly nodded, and seemed to understand a little.</p>

    <p>The next moment, Book of Sage Immortal announced, "The reason why I can survey all the other universes is because my lord not only has the Three Thousand Heavenly Dao of the seventh universe - he has the Three Thousand Heavenly Dao of each of the ten universes..."</p>

    <p>After Book of Sage Immortal said that, all Er Ha's fur stood on end.</p>

    <p>It could only be said...</p>

    <p>As expected of Little Master Ling?</p>

    <p>The Three Thousand Heavenly Dao of each of the ten universes...</p>

    <p>What kind of concept was that?</p>

    <p>Er Ha couldn't imagine it...</p>

    <p>Besides Er Ha...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was also shocked.</p>

    <p>Because this...</p>

    <p>... Was also something he was only finding out now.</p>
