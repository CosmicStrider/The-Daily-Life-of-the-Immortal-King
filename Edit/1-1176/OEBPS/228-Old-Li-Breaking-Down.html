  <h1>Chapter 228 Old Li, Breaking Down </h1>

  <div>

    <p>After Huaxiu nation had detected the fluctuation from the Gate Between Worlds two days ago, the whole country had entered a class A emergency state of defense. Taking into account the possibility that the Gate Between Worlds might be forcibly summoned by criminals, passengers taking the subway in the last few days could be randomly stopped by the police asking to check their water meter <sup>1</sup> , and only after relevant information on their identities were verified were they allowed to go.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is a colloquial term used
to describe how police can
barge into a home under false
pretences.)</dfn>

    <p>However, no one could have thought...</p>

    <p>The matter of the Gate Between Worlds would already be over before it had even begun...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at the demon king's huge arm on the ground. Finally, he opened his Heavenly Eye and put the arm away in the Eye's vision world.</p>

    <p>The demon king's arm would be too obvious if left here, and it would be suspicious if outsiders found it.</p>

    <p>Having done all this, he sighed slightly with relief, then turned his head and noticed Er Ha looking like it had nothing to live for anymore.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..." What are you doing?</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "I'm thinking about my sorrowful first life..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Wang Ming: "..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha slowly went to Wang Ling's feet and used its dog paw to touch the edge of the deep pit created from where the troll's huge arm had crashed to the ground; there still seemed to be some lingering warmth. "I'm bitter, I'm really bitter. I shouldn't have rushed recklessly into the human world in the beginning. If I hadn't rushed in, I wouldn't have been killed by a punch, and I also wouldn't have fallen to such a grievous point..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..." This guy was now so agitated that even its accent had come out...</p>

    <p>Wang Ming bent down to rub the dog's head gently. "We shouldn't have let it see this scene..."</p>

    <p>Actually, he could really understand what it was feeling.</p>

    <p>He remembered that in the novels he had read before, those protagonists who were reborn in different worlds would begin to adapt to their new lives, wholeheartedly resolved to live beautifully and happily in these alien worlds...</p>

    <p>Obviously, Er Ha was a more sensible toad.</p>

    <p>The demon king's arm had reminded it of its children and grandchildren on the other side in the Gate Between Worlds.</p>

    <p>But now with its dog body, Er Ha felt that even if it went back to the demon world, it wouldn't be able to explain itself even after jumping into the Yellow River <sup>2</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is adapted from the
colloquial phrase 'Even
jumping into the Yellow River
won't wash you clean,'
meaning that there's nothing
a person can do to remove
whatever stigma is on him ..)</dfn>

    <p>Moreover, to showcase the identity of the Tuntian Ha king, during each toad king's reign, exclusive currency with the toad king's image on it would be issued.</p>

    <p>Er Ha felt that even if it was able to explain itself clearly, return to the toad clan and then become the toad king again... they wouldn't go as far as to put a dog's head on their money, right?!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At this moment in the desert, the poisonous circle had already shrunk a second time.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming raised his eyes to look around. After the first contraction, the toxic fog had still been very far away. Now, it had rolled in into perceivable range, enough so that the term "close at hand" could be used to describe the distance. The next wave would completely cover the ruins and the border towns.</p>

    <p>"We have to go, otherwise we'll be poisoned by the third wave and die." Wang Ming frowned and jostled the person on his back; Chen Chao had yet to regain consciousness.</p>

    <p>Want to wake him up?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised his eyes to look at Wang Ming and asked telepathically.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming nodded. "Wake him up, otherwise it will be hard for us to move around."</p>

    <p>Okay...</p>

    <p>Then the only thing they could do was force him to wake up.</p>

    <p>In the next moment, Wang Ling raised his hand...</p>

    <p>When he saw this, Wang Ming was scared into breaking out in a cold sweat. "â€” Hang on!"</p>

    <p>After this incident with the Gate Between Worlds, he now had a new understanding of his little brother's prowess. Even with the Dao talisman seal on, Wang Ling could actually still exert a tremendous force of one billion jin with a single arm... if this slap wasn't on point, Chen Chao's head might be directly sent flying.</p>

    <p>Hence, Wang Ming stopped this palm before it fell. "Let me do it... if you did it, Chen Chao might not see the sun rise tomorrow."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the top of a tall building in the center of the city in the little world, Immortal Toya looked at the number above Pingding Mountain; there were currently eight thousand people left.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya looked in the direction of the desert. "It seems that Senior Ling has settled the matter over there."</p>

    <p>The corner of Old Li's mouth twitched. "Senior Ling actually... shut the door single-handedly?"</p>

    <p>Standing in this position, the two men had been able to clearly see everything from the top.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya held a hand to his forehead. "I've realized that I've seriously underestimated Senior Ling's true strength..."</p>

    <p>"...So have I." Old Li's eyes were just thin slits, and he couldn't stop sweating. "I heard from Secretary Dakang that six years ago, the ten of them, the founding generals, had had to use their combined strength before they could close the Gate Between Worlds... Even if the rumor is that they hadn't used the fullest extent of their strength back then, it still seems that Senior Ling shut it too easily. This door isn't fake, is it?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "That can't be it... because the conference room in the outside world reported just now that the fluctuation from the Gate Between Worlds which they had detected before has indeed disappeared."</p>

    <p>"If that's true, Senior Ling is really too terrifying..." Old Li heaved a sigh.</p>

    <p>He had predicted what Wang Ling's true realm was before, but now seeing it with his own eyes again, it was more terrifying than he had imagined.</p>

    <p>He felt that even if he spent his whole life struggling to do so, he had no hope of catching up to such a realm.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya and Old Li were both silent as they gazed into the distance.</p>

    <p>As chief commander and deputy commander of the military training this time, both of them shared a tacit understanding at this moment to choose to suppress this incident.</p>

    <p>This was a wise choice, and in a sense showed their respect for Senior Ling.</p>

    <p>If this senior discovered that they had spread word of this thing, they would definitely die very miserable deaths...</p>

    <p>"But now doesn't seem to be the time to take it easy. Senior Toya should have noticed it too, right?" Old Li had yet to relax as he looked into the distance with a solemn expression.</p>

    <p>"Mm, I noticed that something snuck in." Immortal Toya stroked his white chin and nodded. "I had actually already smelled it before entering the small world. It's an off-putting smell, and the aura is very evil. Compared with these children's vitality, it's as filthy as university squat toilets that haven't been washed for years after use."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Old Li: "Before entering the small world, Senior Toya had already smelled it?"</p>

    <p>"Otherwise?" Immortal Toya narrowed his eyes and smiled. "I've been cultivating alchemy for years, and my five senses are constantly exposed to panaceas, so they're exceptionally sensitive. My sense of smell in particular is even more sensitive than the noses of some spirit dogs. The old Secretary has been sending me out to work in narcotics. A few months ago, there was an organization called Saint Cavalry that had been selling fake milk powder, and I was the one who personally detected it."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>After listening to Immortal Toya, Old Li silently dropped his head and became lost in thought.</p>

    <p>Was he the only normal person in this circle...?</p>
