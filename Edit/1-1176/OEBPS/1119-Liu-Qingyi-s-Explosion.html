  <h1>Chapter 1119 Liu Qingyi's Explosion</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Like the rest had said, Wang Ling had no choice but to act at this critical moment, but after so many years of training, he felt that his acting was just what it was.</p>

    <p>Like when Guo Hao had taken him to shoot a film during the summer break; he had acted with his poker face as usual, but it was a natural one, so it didn't look too awkward. As long as he didn't have any lines, Wang Ling thought that he acted better than most idol wannabes — at least his acting was natural!</p>

    <p>If a good voice actor was hired and Wang Ling lip-synced, he could even debut as a C-list star!</p>

    <p>Putting on the sunglasses to open the mental link, Wang Ling saw the opponent at the first checkpoint. It was a man with very feminine features, who looked like one of those CG characters in a shoddy online game. The armor he wore glowed with a faint green light, which reminded Wang Ling of that earworm: "Green, green, Gu Tianle turns green<sup>1</sup>."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Refers to actor Gu Tianle's
endorsement ad for the
Chinese online game "Legend
of Moon.")</dfn>

    <p>"My last name is Jiang and I'm an architect." Contrary to Wang Ling's expectations, the opponent at the first checkpoint didn't attack right away — Wang Ling still had to freaking trigger the plot first! He guessed this was a plot which should have been downloaded from some game... Since it was being used by the military in a training battle simulation, Magnificent Immortal should have paid royalty fees for it.</p>

    <p>"Are you the one who has come to challenge me..." This architect with the surname Jiang glared hotly at Wang Ling with clear hostility. "Please answer the three following questions. If you can answer them correctly, I'll let you pass!"</p>

    <p>So said architect Jiang.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "???"</p>

    <p>Before Wang Ling could start mocking him inwardly, this architect went on without waiting for a response, "Of the waste products discharged during industrial manufacturing which are used to produce the main raw materials for construction work, which ones can't be turned into such raw materials?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "???"</p>

    <p>Without even giving him time to think, this architect Jiang suddenly became enraged less than two seconds after asking this question. "I knew it, you can't answer the question — you're just like that vile woman. She clearly plagiarized my design and said it was her own work, and even accepted an award for it<sup>2</sup>! Taste my fist!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Could be an oblique reference
to actress Jiang Yiyan whose
Architecture Masterprize win
drew criticism ..)</dfn>

    <p>He threw a punch at Wang Ling's face; not only was it completely out of the blue, he also didn't hold anything back.</p>

    <p>Even if this was a training simulation in a mind space which couldn't cause any physical injuries, the brain would still produce a sense of pain when a person was hit since the cranial nerves were connected to the space.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, this opponent in this mind space simulation couldn't be considered very strong. Following the trajectory of the man's punch, Wang Ling could easily see through the other party's attack pattern, and he used his simple body movements to make it seem like he was dodging the attacks by luck.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he pondered Teacher San Yuan's words.</p>

    <p>Each opponent had their own weakness. So, what was this architect Jiang's shortcoming? Wang Ling mulled and observed this architect's movements, and suddenly noticed that the man's lower half seemed unusually stable.</p>

    <p>No matter how his fist techniques changed, his lower half was an extremely stable triangle.</p>

    <p>A triangle was the most stable structure which architects were naturally fond of; it was evident that the architect in front of him was a big fan of the triangle.</p>

    <p>The more manic he acted, the easier it became for him to reveal an opening. Gazing at the other party's lower half, Wang Ling seized an opening.</p>

    <p>On the other side, everyone else almost had the same idea as Wang Ling, and they started to use their individual skills to attack the architect's lower half.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao used a sweep kick, which was a simple but extremely effective restraining method. After throwing the other party off balance, Chen Chao seized the opportunity and used a series of combo punches to directly clear the first checkpoint.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao's method for clearing the checkpoint was a little more complicated than Chen Chao's. Since Guo Hao was heavier, agile methods like the sweep kick didn't work for him at all. After some thought, Guo Hao used his Ground Roll Technique, which was a condensed version of the Meatball Tank — it wasn't as powerful, but was excellent for limiting movements.</p>

    <p>For the time being, these two had used some relatively normal melee restraining methods; in comparison, Wang Ling put Xia Ming and Li Youyue into the Showboat Group.</p>

    <p>They shared the same trait — they were eager to excel. Because of that, they basically flaunted their methods for restraining the other party.</p>

    <p>"Foul Wind Heavenly Destruction Kick!"</p>

    <p>"Demon Tornado Kick!"</p>

    <p>They displayed their powerful kicking techniques in unison.</p>

    <p>As for Sun Rong —</p>

    <p>She didn't fight at all at the first checkpoint; she cleared it on the spot after reacting swiftly and answering the architect's question correctly.</p>

    <p>A top student was a top student — as expected of the most formidable young miss of Number 60 High's delegation!</p>

    <p>Outside, San Yuan gasped in admiration as he observed how the others passed the checkpoint. The only ones left now were the real big shots — Wang Zhen, Zhenyuan, Gu Shunzhi and Liu Qingyi — who still hadn't made a move.</p>

    <p>They had all been waiting for Wang Ling to act first. This was their first performance and they were still a little inexperienced... They clumsily imitated Wang Ling's posture and even launched attacks at the exact same angle, dumbfounding San Yuan once again.</p>

    <p>These few were clearly new transfer students, but they were unexpectedly so coordinated...</p>

    <p>It was said that there were hidden dragons and crouching tigers in Number 60 High this year, and San Yuan felt that these new transfer students were actually pretty mysterious. He had heard that these people had gotten outstanding results in the entrance test, but seeing it with his own eyes now, San Yuan's spirit was roused by the wonder he felt.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High was one to look out for this year!</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi had initially been copying Wang Ling's movements, but it seemed that she hated how cowardly it felt. Perhaps she was recalling how she and Wang Zhen clashed while boarding at Wei Zhi's place, but her fury exploded all of a sudden!</p>

    <p>This Wang Zhen never once paid attention to what he did! When he was done with the toilet, it was always clogged with tissue! When he brushed his teeth in the morning, he never put the toothpaste cap back on!</p>

    <p>The most abominable thing was his thunderous snoring at night! Which always disrupted her rest! It was impossible for her to like this hateful man!</p>

    <p>At this thought, Liu Qingyi grit her teeth angrily. In any case, it was just attacking the lower half of the other party's body. Furthermore, it was a man — did it have to be so complicated?</p>

    <p>And so, Liu Qingyi directly kicked this architect with the surname Jiang in front of her.</p>

    <p>This was a move which all girls knew how to use: Sterilizing Kick!</p>
