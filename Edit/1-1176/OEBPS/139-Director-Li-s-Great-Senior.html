  <h1>Chapter 139 Director Li's Great Senior </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It had to be said that Little Black was truly Little Black. As an excellent, world-class monkey coder, he very quickly found the whereabouts of several students mentioned in the notebook.</p>

    <p>There were three students being treated in isolation at Songhai city's Second Cultivation Hospital. The cost of isolation treatment was extremely high, and to prevent this matter from being exposed, Mo Immortal Castle was covering all medical expenses during this period. Furthermore, they had also given the victims' families a token amount as hush money. But that couldn't hide the harm which human experiments brought to society!</p>

    <p>The isolation treatment ward was in a separate area of Second Hospital; unless one went through hospital procedure and had the relevant authorization, even relatives who wanted to visit wouldn't be able to enter.</p>

    <p>But Lord Diulei had his own unique technique for getting in to visit these patients.</p>

    <p>Because when Little Black had investigated this hospital, it so happened he had found out that the director was in fact Immortal Toya's disciple, Li Miaozhen!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was May 30th on Sunday in the fifth week of the semester.</p>

    <p>It was a bit cold today, which was alright for cultivators, but ordinary people at the very least had to change out of their short sleeves into long-sleeved shirts, otherwise Songhai city's particular brand of cold would definitely make them sick.</p>

    <p>Weather forecast temperatures dropped and rose at abrupt intervals, indicating that Songhai city had officially entered its erratic mode this month. Temperatures fluctuated — sometimes it was as sultry as deep summer, sometimes it was as cold as chilly winter. However, most of Songhai city's residents were already long used to the differences in temperature.</p>

    <p>Because Immortal Toya had given him a call, Director Li had already been waiting for Lord Diulei early on at the front gate of Second Hospital's separate medical compound.</p>

    <p>They had arranged to meet at about eight o'clock in the morning. Director Li was wearing a white coat with his hospital ID around his neck; underneath that was a thick vest. The cold wind that blew in from the Frozen Sea was at its most violent between eight and nine in the morning.</p>

    <p>Standing in front of the gate, Director Li rubbed his hands together and rolled his eyes at the sky — how many times already had summer failed to come?!</p>

    <p>While he was sighing sorrowfully in his heart, two figures appeared in the distance as they approached the separate medical compound.</p>

    <p>It was Lord Diulei and Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>That morning, Wang Ling had initially planned to take advantage of the time that the old man was away on holiday to reinforce his tricycle. But to his surprise, a man in white had appeared at the door of the Wang family's small villa early in the morning, a sinister smile on his face...</p>

    <p>Lei Mouren had wanted Wang Ling to go to the hospital with him.</p>

    <p>In exchange, he would have a friend help Wang Ling reinforce the tricycle...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling carefully thought it over. This kind of trade actually wasn't bad for him. For one thing, he could save some money. Furthermore, he could avoid contact with other people... these days, finding a repair shop was like walking into a hairdresser's; once you entered, some directors or managers would pop up and begin to try selling their service memberships to you.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had always disliked this.</p>

    <p>Hence, after thinking it over carefully, he was forcibly dragged into coming here by Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>When Director Li saw Lord Diulei personally pedaling a freight tricycle with a teenager sitting in the back, his expression instantly turned a little strange. He didn't wait for the tricycle to draw closer before he immediately went over to greet them as he bowed to Lei Mouren. "Hello, Senior Lei, my master has informed me of the situation." Then, he looked at Wang Ling. "And this is...?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei gave it serious thought for a while, then patted Wang Ling on the shoulder before replying, "This is... our cultivation forum's boss of strength, Ling Zhenren."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"This is the legendary Ling Zhenren?"</p>

    <p>Director Li was shocked and he hurriedly bowed to Wang Ling. "I've long heard of this name Ling Zhenren from my master. I never thought that you would be so young!" This wasn't a strange remark to make. After all, there were just too many ways to maintain one's youth these days, especially for a cultivator. But to maintain an appearance as good as Wang Ling's... Director Li had to admit that this was the first time he had seen anything like it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling did nothing more than nod to this hospital director in greeting.</p>

    <p>Nonetheless, Director Li seemed a little overwhelmed by it.</p>

    <p>Guiding the two people to the the separate compound's entrance, Director Li said hello to the chief security guard. "These are my friends."</p>

    <p>The chief security guard stuck his head outside the security box and saw a man on a tricycle with a youngster riding in the back. But the chief didn't think much of it, and directly opened the gate.</p>

    <p>Actually, it was risky for Director Li to bring these two people in, because the hospital's higher-ups had said early on that apart from a patient's immediate family members or related medical staff, no one else was permitted entry.</p>

    <p>But the hospital was that kind of place where, as long as you had connections, you could automatically go anywhere... when all was said and done, it was a society of connections.</p>

    <p>"Is there a place to park?" Lord Diulei asked the chief security guard upon entering.</p>

    <p>The chief security guard's black face was full of question marks <em>. </em>"???" <em>You're on a tricycle!</em></p>

    <p>But because Director Li was here, it wouldn't be good for him to say anything bad, so he pointed ahead of them. "Go straight for about one hundred meters and turn left, that'll be a parking lot."</p>

    <p>"Thank you!" Lord Diulei gave him a fist salute before he charged straight ahead and turned to drift the tricycle into the parking lot. Finally, after looking around, he stopped between a Maybach and a Maserati.</p>

    <p>Director Li struggled to keep up behind him. This tricycle was unexpectedly so fucking fast!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling calmly got off and smoothed down his clothes, his heart as unruffled as the bottom of an ancient well.</p>

    <p>After all, he was the one who had personally blessed this tricycle!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>There were two buildings in Second Hospital's separate compound. Director Li led the two people to one which had a very imposing fountain at its entrance.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling noted the building's distinctive black color.</p>

    <p>Director Li stood at the entrance with his hands behind his back as he gave them a short introduction. "This is the VIP isolation building that our Second Hospital opened independently for critical patients. My great senior personally invested in its establishment. Even the reinforced concrete used in its construction was specially customized by combining it with spirit herbal paste. Staying in the building helps to greatly delay the progression of a patient's illness. We can give even terminally ill patients enough time to be treated."</p>

    <p>When they entered the building, what caught their eye was a dazzling line-up of brocade banners and certificates with phrases like "Magic Hand,""City Advanced Unit" and so on.</p>

    <p>A wall had been specially set up for the certificates, which were hung in a uniform pattern on it.</p>

    <p>Most obvious of all was a portrait of an old man with a mustache displayed in the middle of these certificates. His eyes were narrowed slightly, and he had a kindly air about him.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "This is...?"</p>

    <p>Director Li instantly looked a little excited. "This is my Great Senior Li Shizhen<sup>1</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The name Li Shizhen as
used here is a homophone
of the name of a
distinguished Chinese
medical scientist, most
well-known for writing the
'Compendium of Materia
Medica,' which is a
meticulous and
well-organized
encyclopaedia of medicinal
plants and herbs.)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"This is the man who established this building, bringing hope to countless patients!"</p>

    <p>Director Li excitedly pointed to a plaque behind the door which Wang Ling and Lord Diulei hadn't noticed when they had first entered the building. "The plaque was personally inscribed by my great senior, and bears the name of this building!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling turned to take a look.</p>

    <p>Instantly, several large golden words came into view...</p>

    <p>Night Shift Nurses <sup>2</sup> !</p>

novel that was made into an

    <p>Wang Ling and Lord Diulei: "..."</p>
