  <h1>Chapter 729 What the Hell? So You Were Also Captured by That Great Master?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>These were almost deformed humanoid platelets manipulated by humans, and they were obviously the sort with low IQ. Their massive and deformed states directly led to abnormalities in their brains. Usually, a cell summoned to take human form by the Cells At Work Spell should look like the parent platelet summoned by Lord Anxiang, a very pretty little lolita.</p>

    <p>What was very clear was that the lives of these Night Chief cultivators were generally messy and they didn't take very good care of themselves, thus resulting in this current situation.</p>

    <p>Whether it was cultivators or ordinary people, they needed to pay attention to their health in their daily lives. While cultivators could go without eating or drinking for days, this in fact consumed a lot of energy, and it wasn't like there weren't any side effects. This was the so-called work-life balance, which was the true path of virtue.</p>

    <p>But then again, it wasn't like these deformed, abnormal platelets didn't have any good points; despite their low IQ, they had unexpectedly remarkable defensive effects.</p>

    <p><em>It looks like when I use this spell again in the future, I'll have to find several fat shut-ins to work with me...</em></p>

    <p>Lord Anxiang pondered this thought in his heart as he looked at this scene.</p>

    <p>"Lord Anxiang, will we be able to hold them off?" someone asked nervously.</p>

    <p>They could already hear the constant explosions above their heads, and from beginning to end, the pressure of a True Immortal pushed down on their hearts with the weight of a thousand pounds.</p>

    <p>The legendary head of the Ten Founding Generals â€” Explosion Saint General Bai...</p>

    <p>The Night Chief and Dark Network members hadn't expected Huaxiu nation to ramp up their efforts and actually get the head of the Ten Founding Generals to personally come and wipe them out.</p>

    <p>If it wasn't for the remarkable self-healing ability of these abnormal platelets, they really wouldn't have been able to withstand this kind of pressure.</p>

    <p>And not only that, in addition to Explosion Saint, the three prison bigwigs who were caught a while ago - the Old Devil, Master of Immortal Mansion Cheng Yu and Evil Sword God - were also waiting for them outside...</p>

    <p>It could be said that a lot of experts had gathered for this battle.</p>

    <p>In order to protect the real remains and at the same time destroy this foreign force, Huaxiu had spared no effort this time.</p>

    <p>And given their attitude, it was likely that Huaxiu wanted to get rid of them in one fell swoop!</p>

    <p>"It's not over yet."</p>

    <p>Their opponents were indeed tough, but Lord Anxiang and the Night Chief members didn't want to give up just like that.</p>

    <p>Lord Anxiang actively managed the magic array and focused his energy. "It's almost done... The summoning to activate the white blood cells, macrophages and red blood cells is almost complete... I just need a little more time..."</p>

    <p>He just had to successfully summon these activated cells to fight.</p>

    <p>The white blood cells were very strong fighters. Coupled with the halo of the parent platelet, they had an extremely strong recovery ability and could render normal physical attacks ineffective.</p>

    <p>Except for the Old Devil and Explosion Saint, almost everyone else on the scene used swords.</p>

    <p>The white blood cells would be able to fend off most of them.</p>

    <p>As for magical damage, the Night Chief members could only rely on the activated macrophages that were being summoned to absorb them.</p>

    <p>That would be when they would fight back and then escape.</p>

    <p>Of course, even if this final plan succeeded and they could escape, some people would definitely have to be sacrificed.</p>

    <p>As for who the unlucky one would be, that would depend on serendipity and each person's own luck.</p>

    <p>Of course, this was a story for later.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, General Bai, Songhai First Prison's Mahjong Squad and all the other Huaxiu Alliance cultivators were locked in a bitter struggle.</p>

    <p>A lot of the Huaxiu Alliance cultivators had their movements restricted by the platelets' mucus, since if one of them got stuck, the others were bound to try and help.</p>

    <p>This kind of fluid was extremely sticky, and using a water talisman to wash themselves clean seemed to be the best solution at the moment.</p>

    <p>But the problem was that no one had anticipated this sort of situation this time, and the entire Huaxiu Alliance squad in the fake remains hadn't brought enough water talismans.</p>

    <p>In a moment like this, a spellmaster was needed to draw talismans on the spot.</p>

    <p>Instantly, a lot of people turned to look at the Old Devil.</p>

    <p>In the air, General Bai once again released several giant mushroom eggs to burst through the bodies of the seven deformed platelets.</p>

    <p>Looking at the current state of battle, now wasn't a good time to cast a lethal explosion spell with a wider range since some of the Huaxiu Alliance members were trapped in the mucus. He had to wait until everyone had been rescued.</p>

    <p>"I'll hold them here, you go and draw the talismans."</p>

    <p>While the seven platelets were regenerating, General Bai spoke telepathically to the Old Devil in the far distance.</p>

    <p>The Old Devil pointed to himself in disbelief at being singled out. "My venerable self???"</p>

    <p>He was Devil Emperor Gua Pi!</p>

    <p>A grand devil emperor actually lowering himself to draw talismans... He would definitely become a joke if this leaked out!</p>

    <p>"One talisman, five points!"</p>

    <p>"No problem, boss!" The Old Devil was instantly fired up!</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The Huaxiu Alliance squad hadn't brought many water talismans, but they carried quite a bit of materials for drawing talismans on them. Materials for making talismans were essential in order for cultivators to survive in the wild, and it was precisely for use in this sort of situation. There were many times when a cultivator didn't know what kind of talisman would be needed, so they brought these materials with them just in case.</p>

    <p>There was always the possibility of failure, but if you could find a cultivator who was a spells expert... then it was the best of both worlds.</p>

    <p>Both quality and success would be guaranteed.</p>

    <p>But the current problem was that it had already been a very long time since the Old Devil had drawn talismans...</p>

    <p>From the day he became a devil, this sort of low-level work had always been done by the subordinates around him.</p>

    <p>The Old Devil had never imagined that he would one day fall low enough to help other people draw talismans...</p>

    <p>While the Old Devil was thinking this, some of the Huaxiu Alliance members had already prepared the materials: spirit water, cinnabar, the talisman paper and brush, and even a little table to draw the talismans on.</p>

    <p>"Both of us are unfortunate and stranded <sup>1</sup> ; working to earn points is the most important thing for us." Master of Immortal Mansion Cheng Yu landed next to the Old Devil and sighed.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A line from the well-known
epic poem "Song of the Pipa"
by Chinese poet Bai Juyi ..)</dfn>

    <p>For some reason, he actually felt envious.</p>

    <p>For them, points might mean their freedom in the future.</p>

    <p>Although each of them might be sentenced to over several thousand years, they could accumulate points little by little, which would add up.</p>

    <p>The Old Devil picked up the talisman brush and said with a bitter smile, "Has this ever happened to my venerable self before? I'll treat it as gaining experience..."</p>

    <p>At that moment, the Old Devil suddenly understood Wang Ling's mindset a little.</p>

    <p>The mindset of an expert who studied and did things low-key...</p>

    <p>The Old Devil couldn't help muttering to himself, "So that young big shot who scared my venerable self half to death back then tempered his mindset in this kind of environment to ultimately become a bigwig..."</p>

    <p>The Old Devil was just speaking in passing, but when Cheng Yu heard it, he was dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>When they had been sent to prison one after another previously, they had never mentioned how they had been caught. The most important factor was in fact that young big shot.</p>

    <p>Hence, when Cheng Yu heard this, he instantly felt something wasn't right.</p>

    <p>Young big shot...</p>

    <p>"Hold on!"</p>

    <p>Cheng Yu couldn't help speaking telepathically to the Old Devil.</p>

    <p>The Old Devil: "???"</p>

    <p>Cheng Yu stared at him. "The young big shot you're talking about, who is he... Don't tell me it's the same guy who grabbed me?"</p>

    <p>At that time, the Old Devil also wore a stunned expression. "..."</p>

    <p>What the hell?!</p>

    <p>It turned out that this guy had also been caught by that great master...</p>
