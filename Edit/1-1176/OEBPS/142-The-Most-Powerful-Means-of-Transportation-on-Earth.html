  <h1>Chapter 142 The Most Powerful Means of Transportation on Earth </h1>

  <div>

    <p>The tall man in a suit finally listened to Song Qingshu's instructions and got out of the car.</p>

    <p>He held a hammer in one hand.</p>

    <p>At the same time, there was a functional type armor-penetrating talisman in his other hand.</p>

    <p>He really didn't know why Great Death-Courting Senior this cultivation grandmaster would ride a tricycle to the hospital... the man in a suit felt that he wasn't intelligent enough to fully understand how Great Death-Courting Senior's mind worked; they weren't on the same level at all whether in terms of realm or their way of thinking.</p>

    <p>"Three supreme Taoist gods; Taoist ways are unpredictable <sup>1</sup> !" The man in a suit walked up to the slightly decrepit tricycle. He raised his hand as if it were a sword, and with a light shout, he swiftly stuck the armor-penetrating talisman onto the hammer.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is adapted from
something Liu "PDD" Mou, a
former League of Legends
professional player, jokingly
said in a Bilibili video.)</dfn>

    <p>Ding! In a flash, the power of the spirit talisman flooded out and the hammer suddenly became larger as it was wrapped in a golden sheen. This was originally an ordinary hammer, but after being reinforced magically by the armor-penetrating talisman, it was as mighty as a spirit weapon.</p>

    <p>Satisfied, the man in a suit holding the hammer sneered. One blow from this, and the rundown little cart would be smashed into iron sheets!</p>

    <p>But just as he was about to mess up Wang Ling's little tricycle even more, he heard a young girl's voice. "What are you going to do to me?"</p>

    <p>Very quickly, horror sprung up in his heart!</p>

    <p>Because he realized that the voice seemed to be coming from the tricycle... bloody hell! This rundown tricycle can actually talk?</p>

    <p>The man in a suit broke out in a cold sweat as he stared woodenly at this little gray and black tricycle; the paint was already peeling off, and there was rust on its handlebars. It was altogether nothing special to look at... but the man in a suit realized he had made a mistake — he should have known that any transportation vehicle that Great Death-Courting Senior used would definitely be out of the ordinary!</p>

    <p>"I advise that you don't have delusions about me."</p>

    <p>At that very moment, the cute, girly voice rang out again from the tricycle, and the man in a suit man collected his thoughts.</p>

    <p>Wasn't this voice... too soft and cute?! As if it was... a lolita's voice.</p>

    <p>He really could never have imagined that such a voice could come out of this little rundown tricycle. The critical thing was that because it was too sweet and too pleasant-sounding, he couldn't sense any lethal intent at all.</p>

    <p>Maybe it was just an invisible navigation system which Great Death-Courting Senior had set up? As a bluff?</p>

    <p>While he was making guesses, he also became deeply conflicted about whether to smash the tricycle or not.</p>

    <p>After a moment's deliberation, he narrowed his eyes and finally raised the hammer — a man should be decisive! The outcome would be decided with one blow!</p>

    <p>Bang!</p>

    <p>The reinforced hammer smashed down onto the tricycle's head with a powerful boom, but only created a string of sparks.</p>

    <p>The man in a suit was shocked as he realized that there was an invisible shield on this tricycle!</p>

    <p>Conversely, the counterforce threw his entire body backward to crash heavily into a black limousine behind him. The huge impact directly triggered the limousine's anti-theft function and its alarm started to blare.</p>

    <p>"Damn it..."</p>

    <p>The man in a suit shook off his dizziness before getting up from the ground. This sudden backlash had been so powerful that it had numbed his hukou <sup>2</sup> , robbing him of a good opportunity to destroy the tricycle with the hammer.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(The hukou is the acupuncture
point between the thumb and
the forefinger ..)</dfn>

    <p>"I'm so cute, but you actually still hit me... as expected, you don't have a girlfriend, right?" The tricycle's cute, girly voice sounded again.</p>

    <p>This time, the man in a suit shuddered violently. What the hell kind of evil spirit was this?</p>

    <p>The car's alarm behind him had drawn the attention of the security guards patrolling the surrounding area. He heaved himself to this feet with great effort and then hurried to get into his car. Struggling with the piercing pain in his skull, he stepped on the accelerator and swiftly fled the scene.</p>

    <p>Right now, he couldn't focus on so many things... he didn't even have time to think about what the hell was up with that tricycle.</p>

    <p>The only thing he could think of was how badly his head hurt! He suspected that the backlash just now might have given him a concussion.</p>

    <p>What a joke!</p>

    <p>At the very least, he was at the Golden Core stage!</p>

    <p>To suffer a concussion because of backlash from a rundown tricycle... who would believe it?</p>

    <p>He sped for the hospital gate and didn't even stop to pay the parking fee; with a " bang ," he directly hit the boom barrier and rushed out.</p>

    <p>The chief security guard was frightened badly by this sudden event, and so angry that he banged his table and jumped to his feet. There was a saying that the more money someone had, the stingier they were! That was indeed true! The son of a bitch was driving a Maybach, but he didn't even stop to pay the parking fee!</p>

    <p>However, what made the chief security guard even more terrified was that as he watched the Maybach zoom out of the hospital compound...</p>

    <p>A tricycle followed behind it at a meteoric speed...</p>

    <p>— And there was no one fucking driving it!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On Baohua Road in front of Second Hospital, the man in a suit zoomed onto the motorway.</p>

    <p>After a few calm minutes, he felt that the pain in his head had subsided quite a bit — however, it was very clear that he hadn't sensed how serious his situation was.</p>

    <p>He glanced at his rearview mirror.</p>

    <p>And instantly his face was leached of all color.</p>

    <p>Fuck! That tricycle was actually chasing him! — Was this cart made on Cybertron?!</p>

    <p>Vroom! The engine roared, and the man in a suit accelerated, but the tricycle behind him was still in close pursuit.</p>

    <p>In this way, a Maybach and a tricycle performed The Fast And The Furious on the motorway.</p>

    <p>The man in a suit realized that when he sped up, the tricycle also accelerated...</p>

    <p>His Maybach was almost at its maximum speed — three hundred kilometers an hour!</p>

    <p>The most frightening thing was that the tricycle could clearly still go faster than that. The distance between them was gradually closing!</p>

    <p>Not far away, a traffic police captain was leaning idly against a parked police car as he pulled out a new speed camera from his pocket... Swish! Swish! Two meteorites instantly streaked past in front of him!</p>

    <p>Bang!</p>

    <p>The captain was stunned when he realized that the speed camera in his hand had exploded!</p>

    <p>"Fuck! Drag racing early in the morning? Want to die?!"</p>

    <p>The traffic police captain shouted after the two passing meteorites and quickly took out his intercom. "Attention all units! There are two cars racing on Hu An Highway at speeds which exceed the maximum limit! Intercept them without delay!"</p>

    <p>Very quickly, news came over the intercom in reply. "Reporting, Captain! The cars are too fast to be intercepted!"</p>

    <p>"Can you clearly see the model? Inform the city bureau that we want the traffic camera footage so that we can check their license plates!"</p>

    <p>"The first is a Maybach... the other one..." Just then, several traffic police officers on the other end of the intercom started yelling. "Fuck! Captain, it's a tricycle! A tricycle is chasing the Maybach!!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Reporting, Captain! The tricycle has passed the car!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
