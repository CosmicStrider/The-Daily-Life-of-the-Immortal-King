  <h1>Chapter 650 The First International Knife Maintenance Competition</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After applying a drop of the medicine, Immortal Toya waited quietly for the test result. The "spirit purity" acupuncture point on the chest was where the spiritual qi was the most concentrated on the surface of a cultivator's body. Therefore, the test medicine had to be dropped on the chest, and usually the result would come out in five minutes.</p>

    <p>The result would very clearly demonstrate if the girl in gray's coma was a result of being poisoned.</p>

    <p>But five minutes later, there was no change to the place where the medicine had been applied.</p>

    <p>"Failed?" Xiao Yin tilted his head.</p>

    <p>"No, it was successful. It's just that this girl is a little special... The qi generated by the medicine is actually clear..." Immortal Toya's face changed, revealing some amazement.</p>

    <p>He had never encountered this before...</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, Immortal Toya clearly remembered that his family's ancestral texts indeed did seem to mention the possibility of the medicine producing a clear result. But he had read this ancient book when he was very young... In addition, there hadn't been a case of a clear result like this for a thousand years. Hence, Immortal Toya couldn't quite remember the explanation for this result, and needed to look through it again to find out.</p>

    <p>"No choice, I can only bring this girl back to my place first, Senior Ling." Immortal Toya sighed.</p>

    <p>Although Immortal Toya had already expected since the beginning that this unknown girl's coma would be a very tricky problem, it never occurred to him that he would be confronted with an illness that he might have never encountered in his many years as a doctor.</p>

    <p>After that, Immortal Toya used a spell for guiding objects to lead the girl downstairs before carefully placing her in the passenger seat and fastening her seatbelt.</p>

    <p>Once she was on Chrysanthemum Island, the girl in gray would face a full round of thorough testing.</p>

    <p>Of course, Immortal Toya couldn't do it on his own; he still understood the principle that men and women shouldn't be intimate with each other. He would need the cooperation of Cailian Zhenren, who had some medical expertise.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya immediately gave Cailian Zhenren a call. "Hello? Is that Cailian Zhenren? I've just picked up a female patient from Senior Ling's place who's currently in a deep coma..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya gave a brief account of his preliminary result.</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren: "I understand. It just so happens that the recovery medicine you gave Ya Xuan the last time is running out; how about I take her to the island to stay for a while? I'll also be able to help you then."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya nodded. "That'll be great, Cailian Zhenren! Thanks very much!"</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren: "Don't say that, Immortal! Senior Ling's problem is our problem!"</p>

    <p>The people in the chat group were in fact more or less aware of this girl's situation. Because of her mysterious identity and the fact that her gray traditional attire seemed a little strange, this bunch was very curious about her.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, even after pooling all their abilities together, no one could uncover her identity or even clearly determine the origin of the traditional attire she was wearing.</p>

    <p>"That being said, do you have a picture of the girl?" Cailian Zhenren asked.</p>

    <p>"Yes! Just a minute, Zhenren, I'll take a picture for you!"</p>

    <p>Lowering his phone, Immortal Toya turned on the Beautycam and took a picture of the girl reclining in the passenger seat at a forty-five degree angle. "Zhenren, here's the picture!" When he sent it, Immortal Toya couldn't help murmuring to himself over the girl's beauty.</p>

    <p>On the other end, Cailian Zhenren saw the photo and was silent for a moment. Xiao Yin had mentioned before in the group that the girl was very pretty, so Cailian Zhenren had been looking forward to seeing how beautiful the girl was.</p>

    <p>Well...</p>

    <p>Indeed, she was really pretty!</p>

    <p>But!</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren: "Not bad, but still lacking in some places."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "What do you mean, Zhenren?"</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren flipped her hair. "Do you know the difference between the Mariana Trench and a grassy plain?"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At noon, there was an extra pair of chopsticks at the Wang family's small villa, which had been specially prepared for Xiao Yin.</p>

    <p>Mother Wang had always liked Xiao Yin a lot since their first meeting. Although Mother Wang herself wasn't someone who paid special attention to looks, it was undeniable that good looks indeed boosted a person's appeal!</p>

    <p>"Why haven't I seen Old Senior Wang recently?" Xiao Yin sat at the dining table. Because Wang Ling was sitting opposite him, Xiao Yin was especially earnest as he placed his hands on his thighs in a docile pose.</p>

    <p>"Grandpa has been in seclusion lately," Er Ha replied mysteriously.</p>

    <p>The appointed time for the battle between Grandfather Wang and the head of Kitchen Knife Sect was just around the corner. Grandfather Wang had pretty much finished developing his recipes in the last few weeks, and apparently had been practicing his knife skills recently. Furthermore, he was practicing his skills at his old workplace, "Kikkaro Restaurant." For the sake of honing his knife skills, Grandfather Wang had been leaving the house every day before dawn for the past few days. Er Ha stood guard at the door, so was immediately aware of his movements.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded. Although he had been busy with the midterm exams for a bit and was going to be troubled with the summer camp soon, he had always been mindful about his grandfather's affairs.</p>

    <p>When it came to cooking, there had never been a day when his grandfather's passion for it waned, even though he was getting on in years.</p>

    <p>Speaking of which, Wang Ling remembered that when Grandfather Wang was young, he had also been a famous chef at Kikkaro Restaurant. No one could match him in the "Splitting Wind Knife Technique" he created, and he had won all kinds of awards all over the country for his exquisite knife skills.</p>

    <p>Now, all these awards were locked away in the old man's place in the countryside.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling remembered going to see them once when he was very young. Medals, trophies and certificates had been spread out everywhere. Furthermore, those medals were made from genuine immortal pure gold!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling remembered as a child how some people had advised the old man to sell off his medals in order to buy a house in the city. Given the capital which the old man had accumulated in his youth, selling off a medal could have netted him a down payment for a house in the center of Songhai city, but that wasn't possible now...</p>

    <p>Of course, of all the old man's achievements, the most impressive one had to be for the "First International Knife Maintenance Competition" which he took part in at the age of thirty. He won the international prize with the "Splitting Wind Knife Technique" once again, and was also given a title... As for the title, Wang Ling couldn't quite remember it, since this was a story he had heard when he was young.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling turned to Mother Wang to ask telepathically, a puzzled look in his eyes.</p>

    <p>Laying out the tableware, Mother Wang said, "You don't remember? When your grandfather participated in the First International Knife Maintenance Competition back then and directly won the championship with his knife skills, the event organizers gave him the title 'Clear Sky Knife Luo.'"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded. Right! That was it! Clear Sky Knife Luo<sup>1</sup>!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Adapted from "Clear Sky Douluo," one of the titles of the protagonist Tang Hao in the famous Chinese novel "Douluo Dalu.")</dfn>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>
