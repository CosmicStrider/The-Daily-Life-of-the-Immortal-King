  <h1>Chapter 423 Xiao Yin's "Romantic Encounter" </h1>

  <div>

    <p>While this weekend was very lively for Wang Ling, Xiao Yin was bored to death.</p>

    <p>After becoming obsessed with human chat gadgets, Xiao Yin had his phone on him almost all the time. Holy beasts didn't need to rest at all; as long as Xiao Yin wanted to, he could stay awake for hundreds, even over a thousand years... Destroying the liver from staying up all night was something that would never happen to him, but even if he damaged his liver, his holy beast heart would restore it instantly.</p>

    <p>However, today's chat group was very strange because unexpectedly, no one was saying anything; in the past, even if everyone in the group was busy, they would occasionally send emojis or fight memes or something!</p>

    <p>In Lord Diulei's house, Xiao Yin sat cross-legged on the sofa, eyes fixed on his phone screen.</p>

    <p>He sent a sticker from "Playful Blue Moon <sup>1</sup> ," which had been popular online recently.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A Chinese RPG Game.)</dfn>

    <p>Then, he held the phone and stared at it for a few minutes... not a single person responded!</p>

    <p>"Ah! How boring!"</p>

    <p>With no one to chat to, Xiao Yin felt a deep sense of lonely despair.</p>

    <p>But a few minutes later, an unfamiliar ID called "Immortal Two" suddenly added him as a close friend, and the profile picture was actually of a women's kiss mark... Furthermore, the reason Immortal Two had given for applying to be friends was: <em>I'm crazy about your blood...</em></p>

    <p>Xiao Yin's gaze froze slightly.</p>

    <p>His identity couldn't have been exposed, and he had only applied for this account on the penguin social chat recently; its level was in fact very low. Furthermore, he wouldn't actively add other people, and generally, no one would seek to add this kind of low level account.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin scrutinized the account information for "Immortal Two" and found that this person's level was actually three crowns! â€” This was already higher than the levels of many of the people in the chat group!</p>

    <p>Additionally, this person's signature was: <em>How I long for a mouth from the past and the temperature on the tip of the tongue...</em></p>

    <p>" <em>Ss </em>..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin's hands trembled. Could this be the legendary human... romantic encounter?</p>

    <p>No way...</p>

    <p>It couldn't be a coincidence, right?</p>

    <p>Previously, when Xiao Yin had been bored, he had looked up ways to entertain himself online, and had seen all kinds of answers on the Internet, like binge-watching shows and playing games... While he could kill some time with the former, games were really boring for Xiao Yin.</p>

    <p>For a liver god like him who almost never needed to sleep; even if usually he might not be lucky when drawing cards, he had all the time in the world for it! When it came to time, who could afford to squander it the way he could?</p>

    <p>So in comparison, Xiao Yin still preferred chatting as well as browsing Zhihu<sup>2</sup> and the cultivation forum for the latest gossip or scoop.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(The Chinese used here is a homophone for the Chinese social Q&amp;A website.)</dfn>

    <p>Everyone had different preferences when using the Internet, and even holy beasts were no exception.</p>

    <p>Besides the above, Xiao Yin had seen another application which was the so-called "Shake"; as long as people in the same city shook their phones at the same time, it was possible to be linked to a chat account of a "predestined person," leading to many indescribable stories happening...</p>

    <p>But that wasn't right!</p>

    <p>He hadn't shaken his phone! Why had it come to him?</p>

    <p>Folding his arms, Xiao Yin stared at the screen. He felt his heart race, and suddenly he was a little nervous.</p>

    <p>Hm... There was a first time for everything! He should maintain a level state of mind!</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin admonished himself in his heart, and then stretched out his hand to press the "Accept" button.</p>

    <p>While he was thinking about what to say, in the end, this "girl" actually sent him red lips straightaway with three words for him: <em>Shall we date...</em></p>

    <p>"Oh my god..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin abruptly sucked in a breath. Were all human little sisters this straightforward nowadays?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, after successfully adding Xiao Yin's username, Er Ha directly lay on the floor and clutched its belly as it laughed so hard it became a dog ball.</p>

    <p>Holy beasts were only like this! They were truly terrible at detecting scams! When all was said and done, Xiao Yin hadn't been in the world for long, and so was easily deceived.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling watched this drama unfold but did nothing to stop it, because in his view, this was practical education following formal entry into human society on how "old-timers," equipped with a particular awareness of scams, would treat "newbies."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was obviously the newbie in this education class.</p>

    <p>As long as Er Ha didn't go too far, Wang Ling thought that there was no harm in teasing Xiao Yin a little.</p>

    <p>Er Ha stared at the screen. It had already been a full five minutes since he'd sent the message, but Xiao Yin still hadn't replied. Er Ha looked at the time and guessed that Xiao Yin was surfing the Internet to find out how to respond.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, after a while, Xiao Yin sent a message: "Sorry, miss, I received a delivery just now..."</p>

    <p>Just now, Xiao Yin had learned how to deal with a situation like this on the Internet, but by the time he had found something, he realized that a lot of time had passed.</p>

    <p>Then, Xiao Yin checked the Internet yet again and discovered that usually in a situation where it took a man a very long time to reply to a girl's message, it could greatly reduce her favorable impression of him!</p>

    <p>So he just made up a random story...</p>

    <p>" <em>Ai </em>, still young!"</p>

    <p>The moment it saw the message, Er Ha sneered. It knew Xiao Yin was definitely lying, and was most likely feeling very nervous right now.</p>

    <p>Although it didn't know exactly what Xiao Yin had been looking for on the Internet, it didn't panic. It straightaway wrote the next message and sent it to Xiao Yin: "It's fine, I was taking a shower just now! The soft foam ran through my black hair, and now it feels silky smooth <sup>3</sup> ..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(The second half of this sentence is a line from a Chinese ad for Dove chocolate ..)</dfn>

    <p>Gripping his phone with both hands, Xiao Yin's Adams apple inexplicably bobbed. "Can you let me hear the fairy's voice...?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha chuckled. Xiao Yin was clearly feeling out its gender with this question.</p>

    <p>It had asked Wang Ming to help it set up this account, which was a limited type with an auspicious number and a level of three crowns. Additionally, it had various unimaginable functions and permissions, such as preventing people from recalling their messages... In fact, Wang Ming had initially prepared this account for Wang Ling, but Wang Ling had turned his back on how high-profile it was, so he had never used it. Wang Ming had kept it up until now.</p>

    <p>This account had been inactive for many years, but after falling into Er Ha's hands recently, it was now being exploited to its fullest.</p>

    <p>Er Ha remembered that this account had a "super voice converter" function. Any voice modified by an ordinary voice converter didn't sound natural, and they mostly sounded the same, so it was easy to tell that it had been modified. However, this voice converter was powerful enough to pass a fake voice off as genuine.</p>

    <p>After turning on the voice converter, Er Ha directly pressed the voice button and recorded a message: <em>Little brother, would you like to see my leg?</em></p>

    <p>Then, it extended its claws...</p>

    <p>In a flash, that initially deep voice instantly turned into an adorable girl's voice!</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin's heart trembled and he felt his beast blood boil!</p>

    <p>The next moment, the "fairy" actually directly sent him a flash pic...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin knew that a flash pic couldn't be saved and could only be viewed for five seconds before it was automatically deleted... And most flash pics were usually racy!</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin swallowed and clicked open the flash pic.</p>

    <p>Then...</p>

    <p>A dog leg with green fur all over it appeared before his eyes...</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
