  <h1>Chapter 1005 Listen, Would A Human Say That?!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Elsewhere, with Book of Sage Immortal's participation, the Office of Strategic Deception's offense went more smoothly than expected. Lord Diulei had perfectly suppressed the two imposters with the Royal Scepter which Zhuo Yi had discovered in the birthday gift boxes, but their lips were sealed tight, and so far they had refused to say a single word.</p>

    <p>"We have no other choice." Lord Diulei shook the scepter and furrowed his brow. "Someone, torture them!"</p>

    <p>"Senior Immortal... are we really going to torture them... Isn't that a bit inhuman?"</p>

    <p>At that moment, it was as if Judge Bao had possessed Lord Diulei. "Since these two imposters are so stubborn, we need to torture them! Someone, remove his purple and gold crown and strip him of the imperial robe <sup>1</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(An iconic line by Judge Bao.)</dfn>

    <p>"Senior Immortal, it seems our sect doesn't have a dragon head guillotine <sup>2</sup> ..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Purportedly used by Judge Bao
to punish those related to the
emperor by cutting them at
the waist.)</dfn>

    <p>"Who said we'd be using a dragon head guillotine?" Lord Diulei shook the scepter. "Someone! Put headphones on them and play Irascible Dharmaraja's song! Tie them up and place them in front of the screen, and replay that basketball video <sup>3</sup> ten thousand times!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(Referring to Cai Xukun's promo as an NBA ambassador.)</dfn>

    <p>"Too cruel..." Everyone couldn't help sighing.</p>

    <p>... Listen, would a human say that?!</p>

    <p>" <em>Ai </em>, who knows if these two will be able to take such torture."</p>

    <p>In Wang Ling's bedroom at the Wang family's small villa, Zhuo Yi couldn't help sighing ruefully at the scene being played by Book of Sage Immortal. But things had already come to this point, and it wasn't possible for him to intercede on behalf of these two imposters; to sympathize with the enemy was to be cruel to yourself.</p>

    <p>"According to my calculations, there's a 32% chance that the two imposters will surrender and confess under torture."</p>

    <p>Book of Sage Immortal said, "However, there is also a 68% chance that the two will choose to surrender if Lao Gudong Jiao is involved."</p>

    <p>"Senior Wang? Didn't they go back to their hometown?"</p>

    <p>"Mr Wang did indeed go back, but not just to honor his ancestors." Book of Sage Immortal didn't say anything else after that.</p>

    <p>But Zhuo Yi heard the implication in its words.</p>

    <p>Although he didn't know why Father Wang had gone back, it was clear to him that it was for something momentous.</p>

    <p>As expected, <em>shifu's </em> family wasn't ordinary.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>As Book of Sage Immortal said, Father Wang had indeed returned to his hometown.</p>

    <p>The Wang family's ancestral home was a sea village which actually wasn't far from Songhai city. As a village by the sea, it was the most abundant in seafood and sea salt oranges. There was an orange orchard at Old Man Wang's place, which he usually attended to himself. However, since his stay at the Wang family's small villa was a little longer this time, he had gotten someone else to watch the orchard.</p>

    <p>For Old Man Wang, his retirement was quite cozy — his children all had their own jobs and were living well, and he had grandchildren. As an old man, he had practically no regrets.</p>

    <p>The only one he had was that he had no partner to grow old with him.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's grandmother had died early, before Wang Ling was born, and he had only heard about his grandparents' love story from his dad. He didn't know whether there were parts of it that were exaggerated, but his grandparents' feelings were absolutely an example for young people.</p>

    <p>Looking at what happened with Old Man Wang and Teacher Pan previously, Old Man Wang had been a Casanova when he was younger — he had dated countless girls, but in the end, he chose his most beloved person to spend his life with, and that was Wang Ling's grandmother.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had always been deeply curious about his grandma since young.</p>

    <p>But there was a limit to how much he knew of her.</p>

    <p>To not be too nosy about one's elders was the most basic courtesy that a junior could extend to them, so Wang Ling wouldn't deliberately search out information on his grandma.</p>

    <p>Old Man Wang was a "lord" in the sea village — this didn't mean that he was a tyrant, but that he was popular and respected by the villagers. As a young man, he had once served as the sea village's keeper of records. This was a high-ranking position in the village, and Old Man Wang had been able to assume this position despite his low realm purely because of how popular he was.</p>

    <p>And electing Old Man Wang indeed proved to be a smart decision.</p>

    <p>During his time in office, the sea village opened a market in every city which showcased the various types of dishes which Old Man Wang developed using sea salt oranges. Taking advantage of its geographical location, the sea salt oranges which the village exported were very sweet and large, and were a hit in the cultivation farmer's markets.</p>

    <p>So, how popular were the sea salt oranges exported by the sea village in those days?</p>

    <p>All kinds of people who saw the sea village's orange sellers on any train platform would go so far as to risk being hit by the immortal sword express as they crossed the tracks to buy the oranges <sup>4</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>4</sup>(Refers to a well-known Chinese short story..)</dfn>

    <p>Even to this day, the sea salt oranges exported by the sea village still took up a large share of the market, making the sea village one of the ten most affluent villages in Huaxiu nation.</p>

    <p>When Old Man Wang retired afterward, he dove wholeheartedly into the culinary arts, a field he had always been the most interested in since young, and continued to develop new dishes all these years.</p>

    <p>Although he didn't have a partner to accompany him, he actually didn't feel lonely in the village. His neighbors Old Second Wu and Old Liang were his mahjong partners, and they would play mahjong together whenever they were free. Conversely, the reason why Old Man Wang decided to stay at the Wang family's small villa was because he was too popular.</p>

    <p>If someone had to be blamed, it would be the old women who drooled over Old Man Wang for so long... They would come over every now and then to nag him about taking care of himself, which he found a little unbearable — the village had even once arranged a matchmaking meet exclusively for him.</p>

    <p>Sheep stopped one hundred meters from the village entrance, and Father Wang and the others got off.</p>

    <p>Until now, Father Wang was actually still skeptical about the matchmaking issue. "Dad, was it really as exaggerated as you say?"</p>

    <p>"You've never experienced it, of course you wouldn't understand." Old Man Wang still felt some lingering fear whenever he thought of the matchmaking interviews which the village had arranged for him.</p>

    <p>The point was that he couldn't lose his temper in front of the villagers!</p>

    <p>They meant well. On top of that, he usually gave the impression of being an affable person in the village — how could he get angry? Furthermore, even if Old Man Wang lost his temper, it wouldn't seem like it, given his temperament; instead, it looked more like he was throwing a tantrum...</p>

    <p>After hiding out at the Wang family's small villa for half a year this time, Old Man Wang felt sure that the matchmaking interviews which the village had arranged for him should have already been shelved, which was why he was only brave enough now to come back for a visit with Father and Mother Wang.</p>

    <p>In the end, they had just gotten off a hundred meters from the village entrance —</p>

    <p>Father and Mother Wang were just about to help Old Man Wang off, when a broadcast rang out in the village.</p>

    <p>"Attention, comrades! Old Wang has returned to the village! He's one hundred meters outside the village entrance! Let us respectfully welcome Old Wang back!"</p>

    <p>The voice resounded loudly throughout the sea village.</p>

    <p>Old Man Wang was so frightened, he almost fell off the tricycle...</p>
