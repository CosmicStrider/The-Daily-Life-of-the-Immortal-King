  <h1>Chapter 1161 Wang Ling's Fan Club, Founded!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was actually none other than Xia Ming who came up with this idea, and most of the team members eagerly supported it... There was in fact some opposition, such as from Chen Chao. For one thing, he thought that setting up a fan club or whatnot was too eye-catching, and for another, he had the vague feeling that Wang Ling didn't like this sort of conspicuous attention.</p>

    <p>It had to be said that as the "emperor of truth," Chen Chao was indeed the sort of good brother that was hard to come by. The problem, however, was that the majority of the team members were Wang Ling's fans... As the minority, Chen Chao was naturally overruled.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling's fan club. What is this... Who is Wang Ling?" Nan Yixiu was befuddled. Searching his memory, he realized that he had no information at all on Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"It's that lucky student with the dead fish eyes," Zhu Hanyun said at that moment. He would never forget Wang Ling's appearance, since it was because of Wang Ling that he broke one of his arms. At his reminder, a lot of people recalled who Wang Ling was.</p>

    <p>"Oh, it's him..."</p>

    <p>"I remember him. He's Number 60 High's mascot."</p>

    <p>Some people gathered round to have a clear look at the rules for joining Wang Ling's fan club written inside the paper airplane.</p>

    <p>1. After joining the fan club, you will receive a godly exam halo — your mom will never have to worry about your studies again</p>

    <p>2. You must cherish the club's designated mascot: Classmate Wang Ling</p>

    <p>3. You must proactively protect the mascot</p>

    <p>4. If you betray the club, you will be cursed to fail so that any match or exam you participate in will never go well</p>

    <p>5. The club will collect 2.5 yuan every month from each member. If you don't pay, you will be punished as per rule number 4</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>"Exams and matches won't go well? Can it be that evil?" Someone questioned the veracity of the rules.</p>

    <p>"What should we do? Should we join or not?"</p>

    <p>"There's no other way. We can't ignore Brother Zhu's arm injury — let's join first. Classmate Sun Rong from Number 60 High is the young miss of Huaguo Water Curtain Group, and knows how to mix medicine; she should be able to help Brother Zhu's arm injury heal quickly," said Nan Yixiu.</p>

    <p>While there were some who were still unwilling to join the club, only the team captain of each school could make the final decision. Everyone followed the team captain's lead, and if a problem arose later, it was also the team captain who would shoulder the responsibility.</p>

    <p>It was only the first day of the survival battle, but many people had already been quickly eliminated.</p>

    <p>The team captains of the four schools thus used magic a few minutes later to send the signal for their surrender via Morse code, before the group immediately started up the mountain.</p>

    <p>Most people in this group of over forty members didn't take the rules seriously, especially Nan Yixiu, who saw it as nothing more than just playing house. Once they had rested and reorganized their troops, they could immediately surround Number 60 High and swallow them up.</p>

    <p>At that time, Nan Yixiu actually didn't realize how serious the issue was...</p>

    <p>These rules had been personally drawn up by Gu Shunzhi; as the keeper of cosmic order, what he valued most were rules.</p>

    <p>This might seem like an unimportant game, but the context of the rules was real.</p>

    <p>In other words, betraying the fan club would really lead to severe consequences.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling knew that setting up this fan club was in fact one of Gu Shunzhi's ploys.</p>

    <p>It would be too obvious if the Almightys in their team took direct action</p>

    <p>But they could cast some simple bad luck curses.</p>

    <p>They could use this curse to eliminate those who disobeyed the rules, and nobody would notice anything at all.</p>

    <p>What was more, this even saved on them needing to put up special defenses.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>That first night, Number 60 High, along with the four-school alliance led by South Sea Sky High and Titan High School, successfully occupied Fire Peak.</p>

    <p>But it clearly wasn't a very peaceful night.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong helped to wrap Zhu Hanyun's arm with a bandage smeared with a herbal paste which she had produced with the automatic pill maker. She first made pills out of the medicinal ingredients, and then pounded the pills and mixed them with water to create the herbal paste.</p>

    <p>"This is a special bone recovery paste. Your injury will have completely healed after six hours." Sun Rong patiently helped change Zhu Han's bandages, causing the surrounding boys to become green with envy. As the future successor of Huaguo Water Curtain Group, Sun Rong paid more attention to her image in front of outsiders.</p>

    <p>Since they had decided to form an alliance, they should help each other out.</p>

    <p>Zhu Hanyun had thought at first that Sun Rong would be an aloof young lady, but after this encounter, he found Sun Rong much warmer than he had imagined.</p>

    <p>What should he do? Could he join another fan club?</p>

    <p>He wanted to join Sun Rong's fan club.</p>

    <p>"Brother, don't overthink it — our team captain treats everyone the same." At that moment, Chen Chao came over and patted Zhu Hanyun's shoulder. When he saw how Zhu Hanyun's thoughts seemed to be running wild after Sun Rong redressed his wound, he knew this guy must have misunderstood something...</p>

    <p>As the school's goddess, Sun Rong indeed treated everyone with basically the same degree of warmth. If there was someone she was more passionate about... it would be Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But Chen Chao felt that he understood what Sun Rong and Wang Ling's relationship was like.</p>

    <p>After all, the both of them had experienced that assassination attempt together at the Xiao Family Compound; they could be said to have gone through life and death together.</p>

    <p>A friend in need was a friend indeed — only those who had experienced this for themselves truly understood how it felt.</p>

    <p>Zhu Hanyun wasn't a fool. Looking at Chen Chao, who seemed to be pondering something, he felt that this was a man with a story to tell. "You... are you also chasing Classmate Sun Rong?"</p>

    <p>"I was."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao said lightly, "But I realized later that Classmate Sun Rong has too many pursuers, so I gave up. People should be more pragmatic. Furthermore, people often fall in love in a fit of sudden impulse. After calming down and thinking about it, I realized that Classmate Sun Rong might not really suit me."</p>

    <p>"You're so pragmatic..." The corner of Zhu Hanyun's mouth twitched. "So, Classmate Sun Rong has someone she likes?"</p>

    <p>"Did you watch the video from the other day?" asked Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>He was referring to the video of Xia Ming and Wang Ling's duel. However, this video was later blocked online, and was no longer available now.</p>

    <p>"Video? What video?"</p>

    <p>"It's nothing... It's fine if you didn't watch it. In any case, I think Classmate Sun probably does have someone she likes." At that moment, Chen Chao's gaze shifted to Wang Ling. While he didn't say it directly, the implication was clear.</p>

    <p>"So it's like that."</p>

    <p>Zhu Hanyun stood up with a disappointed expression on his face.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao was taken aback. "Are you going to duel him?"</p>

    <p>"No." Zhu Hanyun shook his head. "I've already joined the fan club; how can I be so rude to Classmate Wang Ling? Since Classmate Sun likes him, he must be an outstanding person. I've decided — I'll protect Classmate Wang Ling at all costs! At least, I'll make sure that he survives this competition and make it through to the end!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "???"</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Ling abruptly had a feeling —</p>

    <p>It seemed that this competition... had already gone off track thanks to Gu Shunzhi and his gang...</p>
