  <h1>Chapter 232 Throwing a Cup as the Signal! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>To maintain his low-key style in the chat group, the online profile picture which Wang Ling had chosen was actually very old-school; it was of a man with a cigarette in his mouth and wearing a black hat, with skin that was whiter than a ghost. The profile picture had also been modified with the classic filter.</p>

    <p>The modern view would be that this picture wasn't trendy.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sucked in a sharp breath... he had thought that he was already inconspicuous enough, yet General Yi had still noticed him.</p>

    <p>For the first time, he felt that he had completely and utterly miscalculated.</p>

    <p>He had been on guard against so many people, but he had had no idea at all that the one he should have been the most wary of was now by his side.</p>

    <p>Moreover, it could be said that General Yi's insight was completely beyond Wang Ling's imagination.</p>

    <p>"The reason why this old man is interested in this person is purely because of this profile picture." General Yi stroked his moustache and said, "There are many friends in my Friends Circle who like to disguise themselves to flirt with the juniors. They all use pretty much the same method, choosing a silly-looking profile picture with a silly-sounding online name to hide their identities."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>General Yi: "Consider this a piece of life knowledge which this old man is passing on to you. When you're online in the future, don't ever judge others by their profile pictures or online names; there might be big shots behind them. For example, I used to have the name Blossom Never Withering, Elder Brother's Pose <sup>1</sup> ."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is based on a popular
pattern for creating online
names consisting of 8 Chinese
character divided into two
4-character phrases)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"If you meet someone who might potentially be a big shot, don't hurry to curry favor with them, otherwise it will backfire on you."</p>

    <p>General Yi was very serious as he said, "In this situation, the most ideal thing to do... is to first quietly upgrade your membership by adding ten yuan!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>About ten minutes later, General Yi's non-stop chatter finally subsided.</p>

    <p>"Don't mind me nattering on. What this old man is teaching you are the communication skills of modern cultivation. As long as you can grasp them, becoming immortal won't be just a dream." General Yi said, "Like in the past, this old man knew a junior with the surname Song who randomly started hanging out in a cultivation chat group. In just five months, his realm had improved by leaps and bounds, and he's become a new person. So all this isn't some old man's nonsense. They're all case studies!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>After the conversation ended, the underground space instantly lapsed into silence.</p>

    <p>A long silence...</p>

    <p>In the end, it was still General Yi who broke it. "I've already felt that that devil is a little bit impatient, and the Body-Turning Array is about to be activated. After that, as long as we successfully activate the Five Elements Great Array, we can ensure that this devil can't use any kind of magic weapon to escape, and we'll use the boiled frog method to exhaust him to death!"</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling was shocked again.</p>

    <p>Boiled frog...</p>

    <p>This General Yi had even thought of the same attack method as Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>"This old man and the one hundred instructors outside agreed earlier that I would throw a cup as a signal; they'll act as soon as they hear it."</p>

    <p>For some reason, when he spoke about throwing a cup, General Yi's unperturbed face actually flushed a little, and he seemed a little excited. "The inspiration for throwing this cup actually comes from Cailian Zhenren in the chat group..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at General Yi with contemplative eyes. Now that all his plans had been uncovered, the old devil was already completely trapped. If General Yi's plan went smoothly, the life of this terrifying devil, who struck fear in the hearts of the people of Huaxiu nation, would today come to an end.</p>

    <p>But would the plan truly proceed smoothly?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In an underground space elsewhere, all the preparations for the operation of the array had been completed.</p>

    <p>Once the array was infused with enough spirit energy, it would be activated, and the Body-Turning Spell would be used to drive it.</p>

    <p>But before this last step, the old devil hesitated. He stood in front of the array with his chin in his hand as he pondered and delayed making a move.</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue asked from the stone ghost mask, "What's wrong, Lord Devil Emperor?"</p>

    <p>The old devil couldn't help frowning. "My venerable self feels that something doesn't seem quite right..."</p>

    <p>First of all, he had discovered that the Gate Between Worlds hadn't landed smoothly. He had been concentrating on setting up the array earlier, and hadn't had time to focus on what was happening with the Gate.</p>

    <p>The only thing that he was certain of was that in this small world, without the Ten Founding Generals to combine their strength to close the door, there was absolutely no one who could close that large door on their own...</p>

    <p>So, he attributed the situation with the Gate Between Worlds to insufficient demon energy.</p>

    <p>But he had sacrificed ten devil spirits at the Void Refinement stage for it, so how could the demon energy not be enough?</p>

    <p>The old devil was feeling very conflicted in his heart now.</p>

    <p>Except for that incident, everything else was proceeding too smoothly.</p>

    <p>From entering the small world to opening up the underground space to setting up the array, there actually hadn't been the slightest obstruction.</p>

    <p>"You don't know, but my venerable self had once been duped by my wife in a past situation that was a bit similar to this one. At that time, my venerable self had planned to seize Huaxiu's National Palace with the Gua Pi Army, but I hadn't expected that old man Yi Jianchuan to use the empty city strategy <sup>2</sup> , so my army was annihilated in an instant."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This involves deceiving an
army into thinking that an
empty location contains traps
or an ambush so that they
decide to withdraw.)</dfn>

    <p>The old devil frowned and said, "In fact, before attacking the city, my venerable self had already picked up on some hints, so I canceled the plan. But my silly wife insisted that I press on, and in the end I was stuck in a dilemma."</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue was also surprised. "...So Lord Devil Emperor thinks this is a trap?"</p>

    <p>"It's very likely."</p>

    <p>The old devil said, "Like in the previous siege, before attacking the National Palace, all my plans had proceeded smoothly without the slightest hitch. And it's the same this time... except for something going wrong with the Gate Between Worlds, everything else has just been too easy. This is a little world created by Yi Jianchuan that old man, and he knows me inside out. I've already been here for quite a while, yet he actually hasn't made a single move.</p>

    <p>"And now that I think about it carefully, I had obtained this skeleton a bit too easily, as if it had already been prepared for my venerable self..."</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue: "Could it be that Lord Devil Emperor is thinking too much?"</p>

    <p>Staring at the Ancient Almighty's glowing skeleton in front of him, the old devil sighed slightly. "I hope so... but the one hundred people out there make me uneasy. If they join hands to set up a great array, even my venerable self wouldn't be able to escape it."</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue shook her head. "This junior thinks Lord Devil Emperor is overthinking it. Lord Devil Emperor is only one step away from being completely reborn. Once you are resurrected, who in this world can defeat you?"</p>

    <p>The old devil considered Jiang Liuyue's words carefully, and finally nodded his head. "Yes... there is always risk in the pursuit of riches and honor; it seems that my venerable self is being timid."</p>

    <p>Saying that, the old devil's fingertips glowed with spirit light, and robust spirit energy spread out to envelop the skeleton.</p>

    <p>The Body-Turning Array had been activated.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, in an underground space elsewhere, General Yi received the signal almost a split second later that the old devil had activated the array.</p>

    <p>"It's been over a thousand years... as expected, the key to victory is that mine which this old man buried in the Palm Sword. Speaking of which, have you heard of Stein's Gate <sup>3</sup> ?" General Yi sighed and looked at Wang Ling.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>("Steins;Gate" is a visual novel
game that was later adapted
into manga and anime ..)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling was startled; he had read in ancient texts that it was a door that allowed a person to travel back and forth freely to change the timeline.</p>

    <p>Who would have thought that to deal with the old devil, Huaxiu nation would actually use this trump card?</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling felt that it was a little strange, because legend had it that Stein's Gate had been sealed by Huaxiu's founding father long ago... without him, how could the seal have been undone?</p>

    <p>"Back then, we had to try everything we could to send the chip back to the past so that we could monitor that devil." Speaking of this, General Yi's gaze instantly became serious.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling also frowned as he looked in one direction; he had felt a strange fluctuation of spirit energy.</p>

    <p>Had it started?</p>

    <p>"Now is the time to throw the cup and finally tighten the net..." General Yi narrowed his eyes, then stuck his right hand into his clothes to finally pull out a long string of pink bras which he flung hard onto the ground.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>What fucking throw a cup as the signal!</p>

    <p>It turned out to be breast cups?!</p>

    <p>Wait!</p>

    <p>Why did you have bras in your shirt?!</p>
