  <h1>Chapter 273 Unquantifiable Data </h1>

  <div>

    <p>When Lie Mengmeng woke up, he found himself lying in Wang Ling's bed. Wang Ling was sitting at his table and going through his study materials seriously.</p>

    <p>Ah? What was going on? Lie Mengmeng remembered that he had been playing a game with Wang Ling just now... how had he fallen asleep? He got up and rubbed the skin between his eyebrows, and felt a slight headache.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sat with his back to him and kept silent.</p>

    <p>When they had left the game space, he had completely erased Lie Mengmeng's memory of it.</p>

    <p>Now, Lie Mengmeng's recollection stopped at just before they had been about to play the game.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had cut out anything to do with the Itinerant Immortal Almighty's scheme. There would be a lot of repercussions in the aftermath, and Lie Mengmeng was just an ordinary person; Wang Ling didn't want to get him involved.</p>

    <p>At that moment, there was a knock on the door. A few seconds later, Mother Wang opened it and came in bearing fruit, then saw that Lie Mengmeng was awake. "Little Song, you're awake? I heard from Wang Ling just now that you suddenly fell asleep while the two of you were playing a game."</p>

    <p>"I... I fell asleep?" Lie Mengmeng pointed one finger at himself with a face full of disbelief.</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng: "..."</p>

    <p>Mother Wang: "Look, sometimes you young people will get pimples from staying up all night. When you get one, you squeeze it, but if you don't do it properly, it becomes infected, and if you happen to contract a contagious disease after that, you die... it seems there was a young man who died like that a while ago."</p>

    <p>Frightened, Lie Mengmeng rubbed his face. "...Elder sister, where did you hear about that?"</p>

    <p>Mother Wang: "WeChat Moments... The heading even said that ninety-nine percent of Huaxiu nation had already read it! How can this not be true?"</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng: "..."</p>

    <p>Mother Wang: "In short, you must take care to rest in the future. If you are tired, don't try to endure it!"</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng: "Elder sister, you're right... I'll be careful."</p>

    <p>Mother Wang: "From today onward, I'm going to organize a plan for you and my husband in order to fully regulate your nutrition intake and the overall development of your health!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng didn't dare object at all, then he suddenly recalled the game. "Elder sister, can I ask, have you seen the USB which Wang Ling received previously?"</p>

    <p>Mother Wang pointed to the trashcan at Wang Ling's feet. "A USB? I threw it away... Ling Ling said that you suddenly fainted, then you fell directly on it, and it was crushed.</p>

    <p>"Oh, my chicken soup!" After her earnest advice, Mother Wang looked at her watch and remembered that her chicken soup was still stewing, so she hurriedly went downstairs.</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng took a look at the completely broken USB in the trashcan, and instantly his legs turned weak as he fell to his knees in tears. Every organ in his body throbbed with dull pain... What did I do?!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at Lie Mengmeng out of the corner of his eye, and did feel a little apologetic in his heart.</p>

    <p>Because he was the one who had deliberately trampled over this USB...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, there was an explosion at the Taoist temple on the top of Ninth Boundary Mountain between Songhai city and Jinghua city.</p>

    <p>Black smoke billowed out of the windows and doors of the Taoist temple...</p>

    <p>It was Tan Qian who supported the eastern branch chief as they came out.</p>

    <p>Fuck!</p>

    <p>Just now... what happened?</p>

    <p>The eastern branch chief coughed fiercely, long tendrils of smoke trailing from his mouth and nose.</p>

    <p>Before the explosion, he had seen that mosaicked image on screen suddenly emit a light brown spirit light. Shortly after that, a loud " bang " had resounded throughout the room, and just like that, the entire screen had suddenly exploded...</p>

    <p>Tan Qian was the only one who was very clear in his heart.</p>

    <p>Even though he hadn't been able to see what was behind the mosaic tiles, he had seen that familiar spirit light before... with one glance, he had already been able to tell that Lord Jingke was coming!</p>

    <p>Thus, the moment he had seen the spirit light, he had already had a feeling, and had very tactfully retreated a few steps.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, not long after he stepped back, the screen in front of the chief had suddenly exploded...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After casting a purification talisman on himself to wipe clean the dirt on his body and face, the miserable eastern branch chief changed into a new suit.</p>

    <p>He was still in shock from the explosion. He could tell that it hadn't been a problem with their equipment, but with what had happened inside the space, which had created an impact that had resulted in the space exploding. Fortunately, he had a strong realm and had been wearing protective robes; except for getting a little dirty, everything else was minor issues.</p>

    <p>Of course, given the flash of power from that explosion just now, anyone under the Nascent Soul stage would have been finished.</p>

    <p>But what on earth had happened just now?</p>

    <p>To actually be able to destroy the space so quickly within the great array personally created by Master... the identity of the person who had destroyed it absolutely wasn't simple!</p>

    <p>"Has everything been sorted out?" The eastern branch chief had doubts, and more than that, was shocked in his heart.</p>

    <p>Tan Qian nodded his head and replied, "Apart from our eastern branch, the situation in the southern, western and northern branches is pretty much the same; the screens all exploded at the same time in front of the three branch chiefs."</p>

    <p>"All exploded?" The eastern branch chief was aghast.</p>

    <p>"Yes... all of them," Tan Qian answered.</p>

    <p>What kind of thing was this, that could actually destroy all the parallel spaces in an instant?</p>

    <p>The eastern branch chief felt his hair stand on end. "Has Master... sent any messages?"</p>

    <p>"He has."</p>

    <p>Tan Qian handed him a sheet of paper. "This is an assessment report which Master just sent over through the one thousand li talisman. It's a record of the fluctuation values that were generated in the space before the explosion."</p>

    <p>The eastern branch chief took the report and carefully examined some of the data.</p>

    <p>"Master's theory is that a magic treasure, most likely a spirit sword, was used to cut through the core array pattern, thus directly eliminating the array spirit and destroying the space," said Tan Qian.</p>

    <p>"So that's what happened..."</p>

    <p>The eastern branch chief heaved a sigh.</p>

    <p>"The annotated numbers in the report were calculated using modern precision instruments along a magic treasure power index. The average index for the weakest spirit sword at the Foundation Establishment stage is between one thousand and five thousand. If it's a Core Foundation spirit sword, the index is over ten thousand, even tens of thousands... as for spirit swords at the Nascent Soul stage and the Soul Formation stage, the index would be in the hundreds of thousands. Master also said that for a spirit sword to be able to destroy this space, it had to be more powerful than a Soul Formation sword... at the very least, it would be a first-class holy weapon. The power index for a first-class holy weapon is usually above a million."</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, Tan Qian took a deep breath and pointed to the report. "The power index for the spirit sword which destroyed the space just now is at the bottom of the report..."</p>

    <p>The eastern branch chief followed Tan Qian's finger down the sheet.</p>

    <p>What he saw at the bottom weren't numbers, but a string of nine question marks...</p>
