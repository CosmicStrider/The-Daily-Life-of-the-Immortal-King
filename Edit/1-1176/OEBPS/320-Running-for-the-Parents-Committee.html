  <h1>Chapter 320 Running for the Parents Committee </h1>

  <div>

    <p>As reality showed, people had a deeply-rooted fear of the unknown.</p>

    <p>From Wang Ling's point of view, the reason why the Shuigou Sect incident had drawn so much public attention was completely because based on the clues which the cultivation police across Songhai city had gathered, the people knew almost next to nothing about this dark force which had suddenly appeared in their midst.</p>

    <p>The most significant reason was that until now, there had been no news on those twelve missing students.</p>

    <p>Thus, in light of this Shuigou Sect causing chaos and how grim the current situation was, many parents had even set up an interim parents committee to protect the flowers of the motherland, and spontaneously formed protection groups that were responsible for taking students to and from school during this time.</p>

    <p>It should have been a good idea.</p>

    <p>But then, students started circulating a set of screenshots in WeChat Moments in the afternoon...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Have you guys seen the screenshots in WeChat Moments?" Guo Hao suddenly said after class.</p>

    <p>"What screenshots? Let me take a look!"</p>

    <p>A few people sneaked their phones out from their desks; in the end, when they saw what was inside Guo Hao's WeChat Moments, their expressions twitched violently.</p>

    <p>Lazy to use his watch, Wang Ling focused his gaze, and from a distance, looked directly across to where Chen Chao was flipping through the screenshots.</p>

    <p>They were screenshots from the parents chat group of several parents running for the position of president of the parents committee this time.</p>

    <p>The first screenshot:</p>

    <p>Number 7 Tang Zhiqun's mother: "Hello everyone, I am Number 7 Tang Zhiqun's mother! Currently, I am in charge of HRD at the internationally renowned cultivation restaurant, Kikkaro Restaurant. I am actually also the restaurant manager. Before that, I was in charge of a top-rated restaurant kitchen for over thirty years. I'm good at making shredded seaweed stew with tomb grass as well as braised spirit pork shoulder! This is the specialty of our restaurant, and I gave it a nice-sounding name: talking pork leg <sup>1</sup> ! Parents in the group, if you have the time, come and try us out for free! Cough cough ... I've said a lot, but I just want to prove that I'm good at interpersonal communication. Furthermore, I have outstanding management skills. I am honored to represent our Little Tangtang to run for president of the committee, and I hope that you will vote for me!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is the pseudonym of a Chinese web novelist..)</dfn>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared blankly at this screenshot. "..."</p>

    <p>The second screenshot:</p>

    <p>Number 26 Shen Husheng's father: "I am Number 26 Shen Husheng's father. I am also here to run for president of the parents committee. My wife and I are PhD graduates of Black Ox University in Black Ox Treasure Town. This university was Old Demon Han's former residence which was built by his inheriting disciple, Han Meimei. I believe that I don't have to say too much about its background. At present, my wife and I run an education franchise in Songhai city, Jinrui Education. Earning two billion a month is more than we can take! I especially want to do all that I can for the children. If you vote for me, you can use my name at our education institute, and your kids will be attend to our remedial classes at a ninety percent discount!"</p>

    <p>Everybody: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>And then, the third screenshot:</p>

    <p>Number 17 Liang Huihuan's mother: "Teachers and parents, I am Number 17 Liang Huihuan's mother. I graduated from Mi nation's Mashen Cultivation Academy of Science and Engineering, and I'm currently serving at Songhai city's Baida Cultivation Pictures Fund Management Company. His father is the CEO of the company. The reasons why I am volunteering to run for the parents committee are as follow: 1. I served as president of the parents committee when my child was in kindergarten, primary school and middle school; 2. I can be on call at all times due to my flexible work schedule; 3. I sincerely wish to offer my humble assistance and do something for the children; 4. Although I am only at the late Golden Core stage, I am prepared to destroy my golden core at any time in order to protect our children! Please vote for me, thank you!"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>The fourth and last screenshot was also the most exaggerated one:</p>

    <p>Number 13 Lin Zihua's mother: "Hello everyone, I am Number 13 Lin Zihua's mother. I graduated from Hafu Cultivation University with a master's degree and I'm now working for Songhai city's Qianduo Antiques Company. I research large amounts of data in the cultivation circle, and every day I handle transactions of cultivation magic treasures and antiques worth hundreds of millions. Zihua's father is the CEO of a shares company. I'm not running for any position in the parents committee. I just want to warn the parents here that if your kids dare bully our Zihua, I'll get his father to make sure your shares crash! That includes Huaguo Water Curtain Group!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Mostly, it was the parents themselves who decided to set up the parents committee, and who volunteered to run it. While most parents had good intentions, these afternoon screenshots were direct examples of the reverse case. These images which had gone viral in the students' WeChat Moments and QQ zones drew astonished exclamations: Only truly shameless people could say this sort of thing.</p>

    <p>In comparison, the parents of Number 60 High School were a lot more harmonious, and the mood wasn't as frantic when they established the parents committee... that was because Huaguo Water Curtain Group had sent out a security notification in the afternoon to every single parent's cell phone to announce that the group would do everything in their power to safeguard all the students of Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>For parents who didn't have the time to take their kids to and from school, they only needed to sign an agreement, and the group would dispatch two cultivators at the Golden Core stage to escort the students to and from school during this time.</p>

    <p>For many of the parents, this notification was far more helpful than the screenshots that had gone viral in the afternoon on WeChat Moments.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had always felt that this was the reflection of true strength: the more powerful a person was, the more low-key they were.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>And so, after school was over that afternoon, Wang Ling couldn't leave straightaway.</p>

    <p>At noon, Teacher Pan had already called up each student's parents to personally come and pick up their kids.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan had distributed temporary numbers to everyone during class, and they all had to wait in the school gym.</p>

    <p>There were teachers standing guard outside the gym at the school gate; until the last student left with a parent, none of the teachers would be able to get off work.</p>

    <p>In school, the students' safety was always the top priority, so in extenuating circumstances, the teachers of Number 60 High School wouldn't complain.</p>

    <p>Each parent also had a number which the teachers of Number 60 High School had texted to them so that they could collect their kids. There was also another important use for this number, and that was to verify the parent's identity in case there were criminals who disguised themselves as parents.</p>

    <p>After the teachers verified the information at the school gate, they would communicate telepathically with the broadcast room, which in turn would broadcast an announcement to the gym.</p>

    <p>"Student number 18 in Normal Class One, your father has arrived! There is a large group at the front gate to escort you home!" The broadcast sounded in the gym.</p>

    <p>There was instantly a lot of booing and hissing in the gym.</p>

    <p>The student whose number had been called stood up with a red face and headed for the exit with his head lowered, feeling ashamed for some reason.</p>

    <p>Sitting next to Wang Ling, Guo Hao couldn't help laughing when he saw the student that had stood up. "That's Fan Su; his father owns Longman Escort Agency. He has always kept a low profile in class, but after this incident, everyone will now know that he's the young master of Longman Escort Agency."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Student number 7 in Normal Class Two, your father and his fellows are already standing at the school gate with their kitchen knives waiting for you!"</p>

    <p>Quickly after that, there was another broadcast. "Student number 8, please follow student number 7 out."</p>

    <p>A thin youngster with a buzz cut walked out of the crowd; he was the Jiang Bai whom Guo Hao had been talking about, and his father was the head of Kitchen Knife Sect. After he stood up, the girl who had been sitting next to him heard the second broadcast and followed him out.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was puzzled when he saw this, and Guo Hao laughed again. "This girl is Jiang Yan; she's in the same class as Jiang Bai."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Chen Chao couldn't help asking, "Is she Jiang Bai's sister?"</p>

    <p>"They're not biological siblings."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao shook his head and explained, "Jiang Yan's father is the head of Kitchen Knife Sect's second brother."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
