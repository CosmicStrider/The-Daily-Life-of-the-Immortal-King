  <h1>Chapter 690 Several Huge Misconceptions In Life</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After using the "Spirit Power Loan Spell" to boost his strength in a short period of time, President Bai obviously now had great confidence in himself. But the truth was that he had had no other choice left except to trade with Night Ghost Spirit Emperor; before the launch of the master plan, he had made a very poor decision over a personal grievance, leading to fifteen members of the Demon Hunters Association's overseas returnee elite team being wiped out.</p>

    <p>After making such a mistake, even if he went back, he wouldn't be able to escape Night Ghost Spirit Emperor's punishment.</p>

    <p>Therefore, President Bai's decision to attack Wang Ling this time was the result of careful consideration. He had to make reparations for his crime by resolving this "major threat" as much as possible before returning to Night Chief's headquarters. Even if he couldn't settle it, inflicting serious injury on the other party would also be good. In any case, since he was putting everything on the line, he couldn't lose.</p>

    <p>Even if his overall battle strength wasn't good, President Bai could use attrition tactics. His powerful self-healing ability was his biggest source of confidence in a war of attrition. President Bai was a very cautious man and also a rather cunning character. This could be seen from the previous confrontations; President Bai would never participate in a fight he couldn't be sure of winning.</p>

    <p>But in all his calculations, President Bai had missed something.</p>

    <p>In this world, not everything could be viewed through the lens of common sense.</p>

    <p>In this separate magic artifact space layer.</p>

    <p>In a blink of an eye, the small black umbrella suspended above President Bai's head powered up and emitted a black light which attached itself to President Bai's spine. His entire figure then flashed directly in front of Wang Ling at an insane speed of a ten-millionth of a blink of an eye, which was already the peak late True Immortal level.</p>

    <p>This small black umbrella was a spatial magic treasure that was just one step away from becoming a world-defying magic artifact, but the power it was exhibiting now was already slightly above what Wang Ling had expected.</p>

    <p>After all, this was a powerful magic artifact made from forty-nine holy beast skins. Even as a first class holy weapon, it was much more powerful than any other holy weapon on the same level. The teleportation ability which it granted its owner through the link was very troublesome. If President Bai completed his skin collection and the umbrella was bumped up to world-defying level, this small black umbrella might have the ability to turn back space and time...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had his own reasons for making this deduction, since the independent space he was in now had been created by this small black umbrella.</p>

    <p>A first class holy artifact usually wouldn't be able to create a separate space. Even in <em>Eight Classes of Divine Weapons </em>, the most that a first class spatial magic artifact could do was move the user long distances back and forth through space.</p>

    <p>But not only was this little black umbrella capable of long-range movement, it could also partition off space to set up an independent space... Its spatial attributes were diverse and complex, and had very comprehensive functions.</p>

    <p>If it was upgraded to world-defying level, all its spatial attributes would be enhanced, and it would be able to turn back space and time and even freeze space!</p>

    <p>This Wuji Umbrella was a dangerous magic weapon. Wang Ling had already planned to retrieve it after this fight was over and give it to Xiao Yin for safekeeping.</p>

    <p>President Bai didn't hold anything back and flashed in front of Wang Ling to hit him in the chest with his palm. "Detachment of the Primitive World Palm <sup>1</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Derived from the "Detachment
of the Primitive World
Technique" in "Naruto .. ")</dfn>

    <p>This was a technique that had also been combined with the Wuji Umbrella's spatial attribute. Once hit with the palm, the point of contact would be directly torn to pieces and absorbed by the space.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had predicted this palm with his King's Eye, so he dodged sideways. President Bai's palm directly warped the air, tearing open a gap in this independent space.</p>

    <p>The gap was then swiftly mended and the space restored through the power of the Wuji Umbrella.</p>

    <p>How dangerous...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed secretly. Fortunately, his response had been quick!</p>

    <p>Otherwise, his school uniform would have been torn!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had always thought that Number 60 High's school uniform was very ugly, so he had never planned to enchant it. Now, he thought it would be better to enchant the uniform a little, at least so that it would never tear or be damaged. Plus, it would always be free of dirt and never need to be washed!</p>

    <p>"I created this technique; is there something wrong with Your Excellency's expression?" President Bai sneered. He hadn't used all of his strength in that palm strike just now, but that youngster's complexion had already turned unsightly.</p>

    <p>This proved that his palm just now was already sufficiently intimidating!</p>

    <p>He had hope in this fight!</p>

    <p>President Bai sneered.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Sometimes, you had to acknowledge that there were indeed several huge misconceptions in life.</p>

    <p>In studying, for example: <em>This lesson isn't important; I'll understand the contents when I read it at home; the exam shouldn't be too hard; if I can't do it, neither can everyone else; I'll do some revision after I finish my homework; the top students can't do this problem, so what if I can't either; there's plenty of time for revision; I'll get some marks for writing down the formula; if I blur out the symbols I'm unsure of, the teacher won't be able to tell; I should be able to pass this time!</em></p>

    <p>The same was true of misconceptions in cultivation: <em>This technique will work; he broke out in a sweat just now, I definitely scared him; this person shouldn't be difficult to deal with; I couldn't beat him before, but I'm stronger now; this person looks very young, he's definitely not stronger than me; the fight's just begun, I can beat him...</em></p>

    <p>Perhaps other people might not be able to understand this feeling, but Wang Ling had a profound understanding of it. He didn't want to be a curve wrecker, but also didn't want to be seen as a poor student. The same was true in cultivation. Wang Ling thus didn't know where on earth President Bai got his confidence from.</p>

    <p>A master would never tell other people that he was very strong.</p>

    <p>This was probably like those curve wreckers who slowly walked out of the exam room every time and said that they hadn't done well... There were always those who were naive enough to believe that these curve wreckers had stuffed up the exam, but when they got the exam paper back, they were still fifty marks behind them!</p>

    <p>President Bai used the Wuji Umbrella's flash teleportation and the "Detachment of the Primitive World Palm" to start a new round of attacks that were swift and violent, with the palm ultimately transforming into countless shadows that flashed intangibly in front of Wang Ling, but he cleanly dodged all of them.</p>

    <p>"Dodging all the time is useless..." President Bai demonstrated his confidence at that moment as his attack speed increased almost a hundred-fold, and still continued to rise.</p>

    <p>President Bai carefully observed Wang Ling's reaction under this increasingly violent offensive. Unfortunately, he didn't see any change in his face; apart from that pinched expression at the very beginning of the attack, the other party maintained a poker face throughout the subsequent offensive.</p>

    <p>Could it be he had been scared silly?</p>

    <p>Was he pretending to be calm?</p>

    <p>President Bai pondered...</p>

    <p>But in the next moment, a palm directly met his, instantly blowing all the thoughts out of President Bai's mind.</p>

    <p>It was just a light palm which didn't seem to have much strength behind it, but not only did its force cancel out the Detachment of the Primitive World Palm's power of space, it also directly sent President Bai flying and made him spit blood on the spot.</p>

    <p>The next moment, President Bai heard Wang Ling's indifferent voice in his mind. "What else can you do? Otherwise, I'm going to go back and do my homework..."</p>

    <p>President Bai: "???"</p>
