  <h1>Chapter 286 Set Off Firecrackers For You Ahead Of Time </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Meanwhile, beneath the long string of palaces along Sanyuan Road, there was a secret underground palace.</p>

    <p>Inside the underground palace, a Taoist in red held a long silver sword in his hand. The sword pulsed with starlight, and a miniature twelve stars array diagram was spread out over the blade. The Taoist in red ran his fingers along the sword, moving smoothly over the twelve stars array diagram.</p>

    <p>As his fingertips slid over Pisces, there was a dull thud, immediately followed by the stars array diagram dimming...</p>

    <p>The Taoist in red frowned slightly. "It seems we have some tough ones invading our Immortal Mansion this time. One of my Twelve Stars Palace Array guardian spirits, Pisces, has just died in combat; both its heads were chopped in half."</p>

    <p>The eastern branch chief, holding a cage in his hands on the side, was stunned. "This bunch of people actually found this place?"</p>

    <p>"Did you really think grabbing this sword was that easy? This cat-and-mouse strategy was for the sake of discovering Immortal Mansion's headquarters." The Taoist in red laughed.</p>

    <p>The eastern branch chief turned pale with fright. "Then what should we do now?"</p>

    <p>"It doesn't matter."</p>

    <p>The Taoist in red waved his hand and stared at the cage in the chief's hand. "Since they've found us, we'll just get rid of all of them, so I don't have to waste my energy breaking the link between this spirit sword and its owner. Once its owner is dead, it'll no longer have a master."</p>

    <p>"If I may be so bold as to ask, does Master have the confidence to deal with this bunch?" asked the eastern branch chief.</p>

    <p>"They're just bugs."</p>

    <p>The Master of Immortal Mansion laughed as he raised the star sword in his hand. "It will take a lot of power and spirit energy to deal with my Twelve Stars Palace Array guardian spirits. The Pisces guardian spirit was clumsy and also the weakest of them all. I don't believe the other guardian spirits are that easy to deal with!"</p>

    <p>Just as he finished speaking, there was yet another sound of an explosion from the star sword!</p>

    <p><em>Boom... boom boom boom...</em></p>

    <p>It was eleven explosions in succession, and the Taoist in red was stupefied.</p>

    <p>After that, he saw all the lights on the star sword extinguished in an instant.</p>

    <p>The Taoist in red: "..."</p>

    <p>The eastern branch chief: "Master, what's happening..."</p>

    <p>The Taoist in red: "It's the new year soon... I'm setting off firecrackers for you ahead of time..."</p>

    <p>The eastern branch chief: "...Master, who are you kidding... there's still six months left to the new year!"</p>

    <p>The Taoist in red: "..."</p>

    <p>For a time, it was an awkward scene...</p>

    <p>After ten seconds, the Taoist in red narrowed his eyes. "Heed my order, raise the alert in Immortal Mansion to the highest level; any suspicious individuals are to be put down without mercy!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Sometimes when he was on a mission with Wang Ling, Lord Diulei felt that he didn't have much of a presence at all. It was like taking a selfie; most people wouldn't take one with a more attractive person. The best, of course, was if the other party could set them off instead.</p>

    <p>And now, he had this feeling... he felt that he was setting Wang Ling off perfectly.</p>

    <p>In less than five minutes, the Twelve Stars Palace Array guardian spirits had been completely annihilated...</p>

    <p>As soon as those spiritual bodies converged into the form of an array guardian spirit on the ground, Wang Ling crushed each of them with one blow.</p>

    <p>Of the twelve guardian spirits, the most unfortunate one had been Virgo; for the spiritual bodies to combine in the correct order, it had taken a long while before Virgo could come down. In the end, it hadn't even finished taking shape before Wang Ling had defeated it in one strike...</p>

    <p>But now wasn't the time to relax.</p>

    <p>When he had been routing these array guardian spirits just now, Wang Ling had noticed that their composition wasn't as simple as Lord Diulei had thought.</p>

    <p>Although these array guardian spirits had been activated by the holy array, there still had to be a magic weapon controlling them from behind. Wang Ling assumed, given the Master of Immortal Mansion's obsession with spirit swords, that the magic weapon manipulating these spirits was probably a spirit sword.</p>

    <p>So in other words, although these array guardian spirits had been crushed for the time being, they weren't really dead. As long as that spirit sword wasn't destroyed, the guardian spirits would make a comeback when the spirit sword was full of energy again.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling directly conveyed his speculation telepathically to Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>"I think Brother Ling's speculation makes sense!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei nodded in enlightenment.</p>

    <p>They had caused quite a bit of a disturbance, which made him a little anxious. "We shouldn't stay here for long... if we remain out in the open, we'll definitely be attacked again by the next round of array guardian spirits. Brother Ling, we have to find a way to sneak into the palace."</p>

    <p>Whether it was a coincidence or not, just as they were about to make a move, the main gates of the palace in front of them opened without warning, and two ladies wearing red veils and blue Taoist robes came out.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's immediate reaction was that these two had to be from Immortal Mansion. To be able to reside in Immortal Mansion's headquarters, they had to hold high positions, and furthermore, their cultivation realms would be very high. At the very least, they had to be a level stronger than the eastern branch chief. Behind the veils they were wearing, they looked about twenty-four or twenty-five in age, but were more than a thousand years old.</p>

    <p>Most cultivators could use youth-retaining techniques, so it was meaningless to judge their ages from their appearances. The most common way of determining a person's cultivation was to use your spiritual senses to perceive how weak or strong their aura was.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's six senses lit up; as soon as these female cultivators had appeared, he had already been able to sense that they had been cultivating for roughly two thousand and six hundred years. They were definitely stronger than the eastern branch chief, yet they weren't qualified to be called Perfected Beings as their innate talents truly weren't up to scratch.</p>

    <p>The two ladies wearing red veils stared at Wang Ling for a while. One of them, who had the typical look of an online celebrity, frowned as she said, "Are you the intruders Master was talking about?"</p>

    <p>The other female cultivator, who had an oval-shaped face, reminded her, "Sister Beauty, be careful... the array guardian spirits were at least at Itinerant Immortal level. These two must have some tricks up their sleeves."</p>

    <p>Both Wang Ling and Lord Diulei were taken aback.</p>

    <p>Beauty?</p>

    <p>Was that a Taoist name?</p>

    <p>It sounded a little odd...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was curious, and turned to look at the lady with the celebrity face. "Beauty... is that your Taoist name?"</p>

    <p>"Is there a problem?" The female cultivator with the online celebrity look hmphed. "Let me tell you, I'm called Beauty, and standing next to me is my younger sister Discount <sup>1</sup> . If you dare say we're not beautiful, we'll break all your three legs!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is from the second half of
a saying, and translates to
"There is no discount for
beauty .. ")</dfn>

    <p>"Tch..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei felt a chill in his crotch.</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling looked these two female cultivators up and down. He didn't know whether it was because his own beauty standards had gotten worse or that there were more and more of these types of faces online nowadays... but he felt that these two were nothing much at all. Their faces weren't as fair as Jingke's, their hair weren't as glossy black as Lord Diulei's, and their legs weren't as long as Fang Xing's...</p>

    <p>Of course, it wasn't like they didn't have any good points at all.</p>

    <p>At least, they could match Dharmaraja's chest circumference...</p>
