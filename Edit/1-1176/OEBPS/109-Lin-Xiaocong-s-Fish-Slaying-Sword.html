  <h1>Chapter 109 Lin Xiaocong's Fish-Slaying Sword </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Early in the morning on Friday May 22nd, Lord Diulei was still watching <em>guichu </em>videos <sup>1</sup> on some bullet screen <sup>2</sup> website.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Guichu videos 鬼畜视频 showcase edited or spliced images and sounds on repeat loops that are often set to background music.)</dfn>
    
    <br/>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(From chapter 74, bullet screens refer to when users can make live comments during a live video stream, and these messages scroll across the screen over the video ..)</dfn>

    <p>He felt that identifying the number of times an image jerked in a <em>guichu </em>video with the naked eye was a very effective cultivation method. Not only did his eyes get a workout, his concentration was also put to the test.</p>

    <p>The most frenzied <em>guichu </em>video on the Internet right now could jerk more than sixty times in a second, and he could catch all of them unerringly.</p>

    <p>While he was cultivating very attentively, he received an untimely call. When he saw that the caller ID was listed as "Unknown Area," however, he knew that it had to be Little Black.</p>

    <p>"Hello, Brother Little Black? Have you found any clues?"</p>

    <p>Indeed, it was Little Black on the other end of the line. "Mm, I basically found all the inside information on Landscape Manor..."</p>

    <p>It had to be said that Little Black was a pretty amazing guy. While the lab was still in the process of being restored, he could still produce results just by using the basic equipment. This was why he was so awesome. Lord Diulei didn't doubt that he could even make the whole earth rise up with just a computer!</p>

    <p>But as he listened to Little Black's explanation, his brow grew more and more furrowed until they twisted into a knot. "You mean... this Landscape Manor is actually just a subsidiary company? The real magnate behind it is Mo Immortal Castle, that famous one-to-one education institution in the field?"</p>

    <p>He had never imagined that Landscape Manor would be associated with Mo Immortal Castle. But if this was the case, the situation was perhaps more serious than he had expected. Because once the stone ghost mask combined with a person, it would not only bestow immense power on this successor, but also a special demagogic ability. It was because of this demagogic strength that Devil Emperor Gua Pi had been able to create his tremendous melon rind empire...</p>

    <p>If the stone ghost mask fell into the hands of this "Mo Immortal Castle," Lord Diulei felt that it was highly possible that they would make use of the mask by combining it with their education resources to control the students.</p>

    <p>He was a little astounded. Who would have thought that there was such a colossal conspiracy at work behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>The only good news right now was that they hadn't gotten their hands on the stone ghost mask yet... but judging from Little Black's report on the situation, it was clear that they weren't going to give up on the mask without a fight.</p>

    <p>"What is the identity of the Lord of Mo Immortal Castle?" Lord Diulei had a very somber expression on his face; he was starting to get a headache.</p>

    <p>Little Black was silent for a moment before he replied, "This is the only thing I can't answer at the moment. They also have an information technology expert on their side, and it will take me a little time to do some digging without leaving a trace."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Lord Diulei nodded. Little Black always covered his tracks after he was done hacking so that it couldn't be traced back to him or to the location of the lab. If he wasn't careful and inadvertently alerted the other party, it would be bad for him.</p>

    <p>"How many more days before you can give me the answer?" Lord Diulei asked.</p>

    <p>Little Black gritted his teeth. "Twenty-four hours, twenty-four hours at most! I'll definitely find out by then, and let you know!"</p>

    <p>"Very well, I'll have to trouble you, my Brother Black!"</p>

    <p>With that, Little Black directly ended the call with the other man.</p>

    <p>In the lab, he turned to take a look around.</p>

    <p>Fifty to sixty percent of the basic equipment had now been restored, but right now Little Black was still feeling a little confused. He knew himself well, and was careful to never leave the slightest trace each time he hacked for information... so the question was, how had the guy who had destroyed his lab find this place the last time?</p>

    <p>No matter how much he puzzled over it, Little Black just couldn't figure it out.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The dulcet tones of the school bell rang out on school grounds. For the students who were immersed in a tense learning atmosphere every week, they were always the most happy about Friday. Pretty much everyone felt excited knowing that the next day was the start of the weekend.</p>

    <p>As Wang Ling entered the classroom this morning, the class was already talking about the second mock national college entrance exam.</p>

    <p>For Senior Grade One students who had yet to truly experience the constant stress or taut nerves a student would get before an exam, the national college entrance exam was huge gossip and a perfect topic for idle conversation. No one knew whether they would be able to perfectly demonstrate three years' worth of learning this one last time before the actual college entrance exam. Number 60 High School's Golden Core college entry rate was within the city's average, but no one knew how many students in the end would actually be able to achieve the corresponding college entry scores.</p>

    <p>After completing the national college entrance exam, students who passed the cut-off score could choose their university based on how high they scored. Depending on their overall result, they would also receive a government-subsidized Super Panacea.</p>

    <p>In the current cultivation education system, after the college entrance exam was over, each student had a two-year long seclusion vacation to absorb the medicinal effects of the Super Panacea. The Super Panacea was a kind of elixir that could gather a large amount of spirit energy from heaven and earth in a short period of time and help students at the late Foundation Establishment stage break through to the Golden Core stage very quickly so that in the future, they could continue their studies at Golden Core universities.</p>

    <p>Of course, this would all come later for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The reason why Grade One, Class Three was discussing the national college entrance exam this morning was that the city results of the second mock exam had been published recently. This time, Number 60 High School's Clan Leader Yu Heng was unexpectedly ranked in the top one hundred students of Peiyuan district! This had instantly become a hot topic in the school.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao had already been gossiping noisily since early morning after getting the news.</p>

    <p>"I heard that Clan Leader Yu's total score in the second mock exam was just ten points off Number 60 High School's alum Senior Zhuo Yi's score back then! He almost broke Senior Zhuo's record!"</p>

    <p>"Only ten points? If it had been the real college entrance exam, he definitely could have broken it! The college entrance exam paper is generally simpler than the second mock exam, isn't it?"</p>

    <p>"Not necessarily." Chen Chao shook his head. "As far as I know, Clan Leader Yu was very strong when it came to the written component. If he tries it one more time, I think he will do very well again in the written component. But his spirit sword mark wasn't as good... when Senior Zhuo Yi graduated from school back then, he scored almost full marks for his spirit sword..."</p>

    <p>"But there's also a rumor that something went wrong with Clan Leader Yu's spirit sword during the exam, so he didn't perform well," Lin Xiaoyu added.</p>

    <p>"Hm? By the way, does anyone know who's ranked number one in the second mock exam?"</p>

    <p>"Who else could it be, it's Lin Xiaocong..."</p>

    <p>"That famous rich second generation who's always shouting 'My dad is Sicong'?!"</p>

    <p>"Who else could it be except for him?" Guo Hao shrugged. "His Fish-Slaying Sword was custom-made exclusively for him by a foreign expert that his father Lin Sicong found, and it's ridiculously strong! Furthermore, it's extremely proficient at skewering seafood. I heard that if you throw this Fish-Slaying Sword into the sea, it can skewer all the mantis shrimp in it!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
