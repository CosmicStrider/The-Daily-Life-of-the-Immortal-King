  <h1>Chapter 1024 Sun Rong's Constitution</h1>

  <div>

    <p>What was the ideal way to spend time with your best friend? It was probably like Lin Xiaoyu and Sun Rong's relationship: going to the bathroom hand-in-hand and strolling arm in arm through the mall with bags of different sizes.</p>

    <p>This was the typical ideal of a best friend.</p>

    <p>Especially during the holidays; was there anything better than going shopping together?</p>

    <p>Lin Xiaoyu and Sun Rong walked arm in arm. Their trip to the mall today was very fruitful. This Huaguo Cultivation Mall was also a large shopping mall chain under Huaguo Water Curtain Group. If you brought Sun Rong along to buy stuff, her face could get you a discount.</p>

    <p>A lot of shop assistants didn't know Sun Rong's true identity, but they were shocked when they saw this girl, who looked like she was still in high school, take out a diamond card from her storage pouch.</p>

    <p>Huaguo Water Curtain Group had released less than a hundred of these diamond cards in the entire country. Cardholders could enjoy a premium Bill Me Later service; that was to say, you could take the item with you right away and pay later, and you could get a discount up to 50%.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, you could pay in all kinds of ways, and even pay in instalments up to twenty years!! More relaxed than Huabei! â€” Mom doesn't have to worry about me becoming an online shopaholic!</p>

    <p>"This time, it's all thanks to Rongrong <sup>1</sup> ! I have so many clothes I want to buy..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A reminder that "rong" is "lotus" in Chinese..)</dfn>

    <p>"It's no big deal; you can take your time paying it back on the card."</p>

    <p>"No problem! I won't take long! After I pair up two more couples next month, I'll get another commission!" Lin Xiaoyu was cheerful.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Actually, Sun Rong had heard about the business Lin Xiaoyu was running. To put it bluntly, she acted as an inter-school matchmaker and introduced individuals with the aim of dating</p>

    <p>Lin Xiaoyu's business, moreover, covered a wide range. There were traces of her in almost all the high schools in Peiyuan district. Style, type, gender... You just needed to tell this Fujoshi Lin what you wanted, and your most suitable match would appear right away. In fact, Sun Rong had always felt that Lin Xiaoyu was awesome; she wasn't any ordinary fujoshi, but a techno-nerd fujoshi! Lin Xiaoyu had specially designed a dating app for this "high school romance matchmaking system"!</p>

    <p>No one could have imagined that this dating app had been created by a high school student who was still at the Foundation Establishment level.</p>

    <p>Lin Xiaoyu's monthly revenue from this app not only covered her tuition fees and living expenses, but could even support a family.</p>

    <p>Feather was a pitiful girl from a single-parent household. Her parents divorced when she was very young, and she had to take care of her mother and older brother.</p>

    <p>Lin Xiaoyu's mother raised these siblings and finally collapsed several years ago after years of toil. As for Feather's brother... Sun Rong remembered that he was disabled after he was unlucky enough to be hit in the spine by an object thrown out on the street when he was very young, causing him to lose all feeling in his lower body.</p>

    <p>He had been too young to undergo rehabilitative surgery back then, and after missing the best time window for treatment, his injury was irreversible and there was no chance that his lower body would recover (Of course, if Wang Ling had been the one who was hit back then, that object would have bounced back and crushed to death the person who had thrown it.).</p>

    <p>Anyone who heard about this household situation would feel pity, but Lin Xiaoyu didn't seem to care. She was a tough girl with a strong heart that even a man couldn't match.</p>

    <p>Worried that her mother would collapse from exhaustion again, Lin Xiaoyu now had an auntie come in to help clean the house and push Brother Lin outside every day to bask in the sun.</p>

    <p>" Sigh , who knows when someone will take a fancy to my big bro," Lin Xiaoyu said as the two girls walked out of the mall.</p>

    <p>It wasn't easy to find a match for a disabled person. As far as Sun Rong knew, however, this Brother Lin had excellent grades.</p>

    <p>He couldn't get into a cultivation college because of his disabled lower body, but in an ordinary school, his grades were among the best and he was a true curve wrecker.</p>

    <p>"Seriously, Feather, do you want to try my family's pills? Who knows, your brother might be able to recover..."</p>

    <p>"When I started earning money previously, I did ask him if he wanted to see a doctor again. My brother refused; he's used to being in a wheelchair." Lin Xiaoyu spread her hands and said, "But that doesn't matter - I believe that as long as I don't give up, I'll definitely be able to find my brother a boyfriend!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "Boy... boyfriend..."</p>

    <p>Lin Xiaoyu: "In any case, he has no feeling in his lower body. If I don't find him a boyfriend, do you think I can find him a girl?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong now seemed to understand why it was very hard to find a match for this Brother Lin.</p>

    <p>The two girls walked to the curb where the Huaguo Water Curtain Group car was already parked.</p>

    <p>Apart from going out shopping together today, the two girls also discussed the summer holiday homework. This wasn't copying homework at all - the two girls were discussing how to write the essays for their summer holiday homework. Like everyone else, they also had to evaluate their classmates after a semester of getting along with one another.</p>

    <p>When it came to evaluating Wang Ling, these two heroines were stumped...</p>

    <p>After talking it over, they decided to come out today to discuss it further.</p>

    <p>Just as they were about to get into the car, a familiar figure atop a streak of light flew in their direction at a speed that stunned them for an instant.</p>

    <p>"Protect! Protect!" the driver in charge immediately bellowed.</p>

    <p>The black car's trunk lid sprung open. It had been expanded with the Space Expansion Skill commonly used in the cultivation world, and all the bodyguards who had accompanied Sun Rong had been stuffed into the trunk. Hearing the command to protect, over ten burly men in black rushed out of the trunk to encircle Sun Rong and Lin Xiaoyu.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At that moment, the killers sent by Lao Gudong who were hiding in the dark also saw this scene.</p>

    <p>"What do we do? That person seems to be a teacher from Number 60 High..."</p>

    <p>"Gorgeous Itinerant said that he would personally pass on the killers' secret know-how to whoever grabs the homework! It's now or never!"</p>

    <p>"Now or never! Go! In any case, we just need to grab the homework. Don't hurt anyone accidentally!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, on another street corner, several youngsters in plain clothes were also paying attention to this chaotic scene.</p>

    <p>"What do we do? The killers seem to be making a move..."</p>

    <p>"Captain Bai said that no matter what they're going to do, we have to stop them! Even if they're offering a senior birthday greetings, we can't let them succeed! It's now or never!"</p>

    <p>The black shadow soldiers responsible for tailing the killers took off the plain clothes they were wearing to reveal night outfits underneath. Someone shouted "Charge!" and they all rushed in Sun Rong's direction...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Just like that, in the blink of an eye, three different forces appeared on the street.</p>

    <p>It was utter chaos...</p>

    <p>"What is this..." Sun Rong covered her small mouth, stunned by the scene in front of her.</p>

    <p>She saw numerous dark shadows flying toward her and Lin Xiaoyu from all sides.</p>

    <p>"..." Lin Xiaoyu realized that Sun Rong seemed to have a constitution which attracted killers...</p>
