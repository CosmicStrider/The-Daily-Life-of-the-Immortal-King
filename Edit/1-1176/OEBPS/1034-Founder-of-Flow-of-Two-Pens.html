  <h1>Chapter 1034 Founder of Flow of Two Pens</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was human nature to love beauty. Although a person was born with their looks, spells, pills and medicine for changing one's appearance based on each individual's aesthetic requirements popped up all the time in the cultivation world; cultivators could get plastic surgery without needing to go under the knife, and it was very safe.</p>

    <p>Youth-retaining pills could optimize your original features to a certain degree, improve the condition of your skin, and give you a youthful appearance. Huaguo Water Curtain Group's youth-retaining pill was the most famous.</p>

    <p>Of course, if you wanted a completely different appearance, you could use face-molding pills. Within half an hour of eating one, your face would become as malleable as plasticine. However, face-molding pills usually weren't sold over the counter. This was something that had to be arranged by a hospital's cosmetic surgery department, and the doctor responsible for molding the face also had to have passed a face-molding evaluation and obtained the relevant qualification certificate.</p>

    <p>Actually, Er Ha wasn't worried about how ugly it would be when it took on a human form - it was worried that its hair would look strange in a human form... There were a lot of men with green hair in comics and cartoons, but it really would look very strange in real life!!</p>

    <p>Of course, not everyone had this fear of looking ugly.</p>

    <p>For example, Little Master Ling was someone who worried that he was too handsome, and had forcibly pulled his looks down to the average level...</p>

    <p>Your face was something you were born with.</p>

    <p>Er Ha stared at Lin Shiyao. Although it had only been a few minutes since encountering her, Er Ha could already sense this attractive curve wrecker's charisma. A group of university students ghostwriting homework, and grandiosely taking orders in the school canteen - this was absolutely a beautiful scene.</p>

    <p>Letting Xiao Yin hang around would interfere with Lin Shiyao's work, so she listened patiently to Xiao Yin's request. Xiao Yin didn't go into detail, and just told the girl that due to some reason, they needed to swap out some of the workbooks and test papers.</p>

    <p>Lin Shiyao accepted the workbooks Xiao Yin planned to use for the exchange, and she was stunned by the neat and utterly beautiful handwriting in them.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, it was in a calligraphy style that Lin Shiyao had actually never seen before.</p>

    <p>And so, Lin Shiyao agreed to Xiao Yin's request. "You can swap out as many as you want."</p>

    <p>She then buried her head in the homework.</p>

    <p>"Thank you!"</p>

    <p>The exchange was a success! Xiao Yin and Er Ha were pleasantly surprised to be able to obtain six fragments all at once.</p>

    <p>Out of the corner of her eye, Lin Shiyao sized up the homework from Xiao Yin: it was four test papers and two workbooks. As she brooded over the beautiful characters, she was abruptly seized by the desire to see what the person with such beautiful handwriting looked like.</p>

    <p>"Who wrote this homework?" Lin Shiyao asked without looking up.</p>

    <p>"To be exact, it was my Master," Xiao Yin answered. He knew very well that the two gremlins, Pen and Eraser, ultimately acted in accordance with Little Master Ling's will. While they helped Little Master Ling finish the homework, there were still some fixed rules:</p>

    <p>1: The homework content had to be something that Wang Ling had already mastered.</p>

    <p>2: The two gremlins Eraser and Pen were unable to help with essay topics that involved expressing emotions.</p>

    <p>Aside from the two inflexible conditions above, Wang Ling could do whatever he liked.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling could even fix what handwriting style to use in the workbooks. Most of the workbooks were written in the "regular square" style. However, some of the topics had to do with expressing emotions and Pen and Eraser had no way of completing them, so Wang Ling would write these sections himself.</p>

    <p>Although there weren't many of these topics, Wang Ling's handwriting caught Lin Shiyao's attention.</p>

    <p>When one Silver and one dog figured out Miss Lin's thoughts, they couldn't help sighing in their hearts.</p>

    <p>It could only be said that as expected of Little Master Ling: he could casually snare a female university student without even leaving the house... Moreover, it was a very beautiful and ascetic female curve wrecker...</p>

    <p>The fact that they could see through Lin Shiyao's thoughts wasn't strange. Xiao Yin was a holy beast while Er Ha was a quasi-holy beast. In addition, this Silver and dog chatted with each other privately every day, and had comprehended the Bright Holy Heart ability long ago.</p>

    <p>Although this ability wasn't as powerful as Wang Ling's "Mind-Reading Ability," which could cover an unlimited distance, one could still read a person's inner thoughts when in close range.</p>

    <p>Actually, Er Ha felt that it wasn't even necessary to use Bright Holy Heart when it came to Lin Shiyao - all the thoughts of this young lady, who was still in her teens, was written on her face.</p>

    <p>"I don't know what you're looking for, but it seems to be inside these kids' high school summer homework, right?" Her chin in her hands, Lin Shiyao tried to come up with a possible action plan.</p>

    <p>Finally, she grit her teeth. "How about this, I'll make you a deal. I'll increase our orders and help gather as much homework as possible. That way, you might find whatever you're looking for more quickly."</p>

    <p>"So it can be done like this..." Xiao Yin pondered, but at the same time was worried whether Lin Shiyao would be able to accomplish the task as promised, since it would be an excessive workload.</p>

    <p>"You don't have to worry about me. Since I've promised to increase the orders, I'm quite certain I can handle it." Lin Shiyao stopped writing and smiled confidently. "Have you heard of Flow of Two Pens?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha was stunned. "???"</p>

    <p>Of course it knew Flow of Two Pens... This was the trick Guo Hao had used to copy homework in Number 60 High before... Furthermore, Guo Hao had even upgraded this move, and unleashed Flow of Five Pens to increase his copying speed.</p>

    <p>"To tell you the truth, I'm the founder of Flow of Two Pens Sect." Lin Shiyao steepled her fingers and formally introduced herself to Xiao Yin and Er Ha.</p>

    <p>"When you join my sect, learning Flow of Two Pens is the basic requirement. I just need to mobilize all my sect disciples and have them use Flow of Two Pens in their ghostwriting, so we can double the original workload."</p>

    <p>Lin Shiyao added, "Of course, Flow of Two Pens is not my biggest strength as sect leader."</p>

    <p>Saying that, she took out all the pens in her stationery pouch, and held them in-between her fingers on both hands... Eight pens in total.</p>

    <p>Fuck! Flow of Eight Pens...</p>

    <p>Er Ha was now utterly convinced of Lin Shiyao's identity as sect leader.</p>

    <p>It could only be said that as the founder of Flow of Two Pens Sect, Lin Shiyao was indeed qualified to undertake this huge task. Doing homework with eight pens... This speed was simply unimaginable. In Lin Shiyao's eyes, these high school exercises were as easy as eating and drinking.</p>

    <p>Using eight pens at the same time, she had already become a human typewriter...</p>

    <p>Then, like a swordsman, she slipped all the pens in her hand back into her stationery pouch. Her movements were like a refined dance performance, so smooth they made one's hair stand on end.</p>

    <p>And so, after this jaw-dropping operation, Lin Shiyao looked at the Silver and the dog in front of her. "I'll help you, but you have to promise me that you'll let me meet the person who has this handwriting. So... do we have a deal?"</p>
