  <h1>Chapter 771 The Long Johns' Importance</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Elsewhere, Wang Ming was still leading the small team's operation to help His Majesty Beast King clear the game.</p>

    <p>The storyline for "Detroit: Cultivation" branched off in a lot of complicated ways, and each choice would affect the way the plot developed.</p>

    <p>The game unfolded according to how the stories of the three main characters intertwined. There were three characters that the player had to operate, Connor being just one of the main characters. The other two storylines revolved around Marcus, the male housekeeper robot, and Kara, the female robot...</p>

    <p>"Everything was as Xiao Yin expected; Beast King deliberately chose the odd answers to make the plot veer off in a bad direction. He never planned to win from the start." After narrowly passing the first storyline, Zhuo Yi let out a sigh. It was obvious that if they wanted to help Beast King clear the game, they couldn't use regular means.</p>

    <p>The second story revolved around the housekeeper android Kara, her male owner Todd, and Todd's little girl Alice.</p>

    <p>According to this storyline, due to the emergence of smart androids, Todd lost his job and then his wife left him. He became an alcoholic, gave in to despair, and even started to take a new type of cheap drug which caused his temperament to turn abnormally violent.</p>

    <p>At the start of the story, Todd had gone to a Membrane Control Life specialty store to pick up his bionic robot Kara, because two weeks ago, she had blown out when he had beaten her with his fists in a fit of rage after taking the drug.</p>

    <p>"How are we going to clear this storyline? Want me to continue crossdressing?" Luo Chuang asked. For some reason, he seemed to be viewing crossdressing in a different light...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was so scared his body trembled. "No... it's fine..."</p>

    <p>He had been badly frightened by Luo Chuang's crossdressing earlier. It really stung the eyes, even more so than Kuxuan crossdressing - at least Kuxuan in women's clothes was still tolerable<sup>1</sup>! But not Luo Chuang! The Silver Grand Champion on the fan rankings was proof that Kuxuan in women's clothes was really cute<sup>2</sup>!</p>

    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Kuxuan, the author of this novel himself, speaking from experience.)</dfn>
    
    <br/>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(On Qidian, a fan who rewards the author a million Qidian coins in one go, equivalent to 10,000 RMB, is given the title Silver Grand Champion.)</dfn>
    
    <p>This ID was very sincere!</p>

    <p>"I downloaded and analyzed the entire storyline earlier: the key point is that Todd will start to beat the little girl under the influence of drugs. Kara will firmly protect Todd's daughter Alice, violating Todd's command not to interfere. Finally, she successfully rebels and takes Alice with her as they escape Todd's place."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said, "The key to the storyline is that both of them have to get out alive, and at the same time we have to be careful not to kill Todd while rebelling against him, otherwise public opinion in the plot narrative will drop and the final outcome won't be very good."</p>

    <p>"So what should we do?" Xiao Yin asked.</p>

    <p>"That's easy," Wang Ming said. "When rebelling against the domestic violence, Kara can choose to use a weapon to kill Todd."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "If it's His Majesty Beast King, he would definitely choose that..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming chuckled. "So I replaced the weapon in this storyline with one that is basically non-lethal. In short, as long as this storyline's NPC traps Todd but doesn't kill him, and then gets Kara to escape with the little girl, then the storyline will develop a happy ending!"</p>

    <p>"What's the weapon?"</p>

    <p>"Unbreakable Seven-Day Love Lock<sup>3</sup>."</p>

    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(From the Chinese cartoon "Killer Seven," and is a head and body lock used on an opponent and which lasts seven days)</dfn>

    <p>"This is..."</p>

    <p>"It's a type of magic treasure that can be used to firmly trap a person. Trap him but not kill him, graceful and no less beautiful."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Since Wang Ming had relied on his skills to "sneak into" Beast King's game world, Beast King wasn't aware of their infiltration. However, Xiao Yin was very worried that Beast King would finally notice as the plot continued to mysteriously change.</p>

    <p>Beast King originally thought that these changes in the plot were associated with the game's latest pack update, but the further the plot developed, the more he felt that there seemed to be many unreasonable instances in it...</p>

    <p>Previously, there was no way that the plot could jump around like this!</p>

    <p>So, it was in the third storyline, which had to do with Marcus, the last of the three main game characters, that Beast King finally sensed that there was a problem.</p>

    <p>Instead of triggering the next mission, he deliberately manipulated his character Marcus into staring at the air on one side.</p>

    <p>Beast King's intuition enabled him to almost immediately detect where Wang Ming and the others were. "I know you're on the side. Since you're already here, then come out. Don't hide any longer."</p>

    <p>Beast King's voice was very low, but it carried tremendous mental pressure which pushed down on Wang Ming and the others.</p>

    <p>"How powerful..." Xiao Yin marveled.</p>

    <p>"I'll bear it."</p>

    <p>To everyone's surprise, Zhuo Yi unexpectedly took the lead and stood at the very front.</p>

    <p>"You can't bear up under it with your realm, can you?"</p>

    <p>"It has nothing to do with realm."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi shook his head. "I'm wearing long johns."</p>

    <p>Everyone looked like they had suddenly seen the light, and their expressions were unsurprised.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming sighed deeply. It seemed that as his stupid otouto's disciple, this Zhuo Yi indeed genuinely loved his shifu. He actually wore the long johns all the time!</p>

    <p>But this incident had certainly taught Wang Ming a lesson when it came to the long johns.</p>

    <p>If there was another excursion next time, Wang Ming felt that it was still more reliable to wear the long johns so that he wouldn't be caught unawares when he encountered danger like this again.</p>

    <p>Since Beast King had already sensed them, Wang Ming and the others didn't plan to continue hiding, and directly revealed themselves.</p>

    <p>Tremendous mental pressure poured over them, like the massive storm stirred up by Typhoon Mangkhut. Everyone felt pressure pushing down on their shoulders, and struggled to even open their eyelids.</p>

    <p>But after Zhuo Yi stepped to the front, this pressure instantly eased.</p>

    <p>Beast King stared at Zhuo Yi in utter amazement.</p>

    <p>This young man was clearly only at the Golden Core stage, yet he could take on the burden of this mental pressure in Beast King's game world?</p>

    <p>No...</p>

    <p>This absolutely wasn't the young man's own strength.</p>

    <p>Beast King had already sensed something wasn't right, and he operated his character "Marcus."</p>

    <p>The next moment, his eyes turned a golden color as they shone with a holy radiance as white as jade.</p>

    <p>"Holy King Eye!" This was Xiao Yin's second time seeing Beast King's Holy King Eye. The first time he had seen it was as a child during the holy beast festival, which was held once every century.</p>

    <p>"Little Master! Be careful!" Xiao Yin warned Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>But in the next instant, Beast King's hand was already reaching for Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>He had already detected the long johns on Zhuo Yi, and had unexpectedly decided to directly stretch out his hand to tear them to shreds...</p>
