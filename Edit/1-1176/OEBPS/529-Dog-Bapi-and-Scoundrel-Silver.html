  <h1>Chapter 529 Dog Bapi and Scoundrel Silver </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling was already very clear on the fact that President Bai had to be apprehended.</p>

    <p>As the main culprit behind the extinction of the holy beasts back then, Wang Ling felt that the phrase "too numerous to count" could already be used to describe this type of grave sin.</p>

    <p>But tracking down and capturing President Bai had to first and foremost take into account Xiao Yin's protection. This didn't refer to just his safety, but also to information on him. Almost everyone already knew that holy beasts were extinct now, and apart from that lot who had participated in the Immortal Mansion operation, there wasn't a single outsider who knew of Xiao Yin's identity.</p>

    <p>After coming back, those who had taken part in the Immortal Mansion incident had in unison chosen to keep quiet about it even in the group, and hadn't leaked any information at all.</p>

    <p>So Xiao Yin's identity was absolutely safe for the moment; if they had to lure the president of the Demon Hunters Association out by revealing Xiao Yin's identity, Wang Ling felt that this would be missing the forest for the trees.</p>

    <p>In truth, Lord Diulei had completely anticipated this reply, and he had actually already guessed that Wang Ling would respond in this way.</p>

    <p>Ling Zhenren was a person who valued sentiment. While people tended to regard it as "fetters" a lot of times, from what Lord Diulei knew of Wang Ling, he had already known this plan wouldn't work when he had thought of it. So why had he mentioned it even when he knew it wouldn't do?</p>

    <p>This was actually because of Xiao Yin's one-sided request.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin had been looking for an opportunity to show himself off for his master.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling texted a reply to reject this plan, Xiao Yin was next to Lord Diulei, and he picked at his snow white foot as he read the text.</p>

    <p>It was very succinct and to the point, and was very much like Ling Zhenren's "unique demeanor."</p>

    <p>It only contained two words, but Xiao Yin was still deeply touched. "I knew Master would definitely refuse!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was surprised. "Then why did you want me to ask?"</p>

    <p>"It was a test!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was very pleased as he hugged himself. He then pulled out a stack of books from under his butt. Lord Diulei took a look at the covers: <em>How To Make Your Master Love You More </em>, <em>100 Ways To Catch A Man</em>, and <em>When A Masochist Meets A Sadist </em>...</p>

    <p>The third book freaked Lord Diulei out. "The hell! Brother Xiao Yin... do you have a thing for Brother Ling?"</p>

    <p>"No, how would I dare..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin pulled his neck back in. "The third book was a gift. The title might look a little suggestive, but the book seems to be about proper specialized university subjects."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "What specialized subjects?"</p>

    <p>"Look at this page."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin opened the book and pointed at the table of contents. "I was just reading 'The Study of Wax Play' in the last few days."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei's lips twitched. "..." Sure enough! Was he not reading enough? Or had it been too long since he'd graduated from university? He had two PhDs! But what was this study of wax play?! Why had he never heard of it?</p>

    <p>"It's very detailed and it even has a profile on the creator of this field of study."</p>

    <p>"Crea... creator?"</p>

    <p>"Mm, his name's translated from English, it sounds like a foreigner. The English translation is: Clear Wax Dance <sup>1</sup> ."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The pinyin for this is a homonym for "Clearlove," which is the ID for Ming Kai, a jungler for the esports team EDward Gaming.)</dfn>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Suddenly, Lord Diulei felt old.</p>

    <p>The online chat was still ongoing.</p>

    <p>"In that case, we can only think of a way to find this informant. We'll also have to tighten security around Mr Lu." Lord Diulei typed swiftly as he put forward his series of plans.</p>

    <p>Apart from finding the informant, Mr Lu's safety had now become very important since he was currently the only witness they had who could step forward to testify against President Bai.</p>

    <p>If something happened to Mr Lu and they weren't able to capture President Bai, this really would be a case of dead men telling no tales.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sent a message back asking Lord Diulei to forward him the original link to the forum post; he would try asking Wang Ming to track down the informant. Little Black might have run out of options, but Wang Ming perhaps still had some other way.</p>

    <p>Since they couldn't think of anything else for now, the only thing they could do was wait for Wang Ming to do a search and come back to them later with further information.</p>

    <p>Before closing the chat window, Wang Ling told Lord Diulei that Er Ha would be at his house shortly to see Xiao Yin. Lord Diulei replied very politely, "Come to think of it, it seems that this will be Brother Dog's first time here, right? Don't worry, Brother Ling! I'll inform the security guards at the gate later to have them send a car and bring Brother Dog to my door!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at the screen as he pondered for a long, long time. "..."</p>

    <p>As expected, a luxury villa district was different!</p>

    <p>It even had a shuttle car for visitors!</p>

    <p>This was yet another classic case of a man being no better than a dog...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It really was Er Ha's first time visiting Lord Diulei's house. Xiao Yin had actually invited it over several times before (this guy already completely treated Lord Diulei's house like his own). Also, judging from Er Ha's online chat with Xiao Yin, the latter had discovered plenty of "little secrets" about Lord Diulei from staying at home the whole day.</p>

    <p>Of course, Er Ha didn't know exactly what these secrets were since Xiao Yin was using them as leverage to get Lord Diulei to brush his hair in his animal form... Not only that, he even had Senior Immortal put in hair conditioner for him.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei already had beautiful black hair to begin with, and he used up roughly two bottles of conditioner at home each month, which was quite a lot. After Xiao Yin came to stay, hair conditioner had become another huge daily living expense for Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>The difference was that he used to buy them by the bottle before, but now he was buying them by the box...</p>

    <p>However, Er Ha didn't think that Lord Diulei usually had any complaints. It seemed that he treated Xiao Yin like a younger brother. Although Xiao Yin was older than Thunder, he actually wasn't as mature in terms of mental development.</p>

    <p>After all, this "Great Death-Courting Senior" was an old veteran who had already been acknowledged in existing circles. In fact, it wasn't too much for an inexperienced silver unicorn like Xiao Yin to address him as "senior"...</p>

    <p>To tell the truth, Er Ha had initially thought that Lord Diulei would have a pretty hard life, but now that it thought about it, this guy seemed to be enjoying himself...</p>

    <p>Keeping this type of scoundrel around who liked to make trouble really wasn't easy!</p>

    <p>So Xiao Yin's online nickname for Er Ha was Dog Bapi <sup>2</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(A reminder that Zhou Bapi is an antagonist in the story "The Chickens Make Noise at Midnight" who would stir the chickens in the henhouse so that the rooster would crow earlier than usual, forcing his laborers to get up earlier for work..)</dfn>

    <p>In return, Er Ha called Xiao Yin Scoundrel Silver.</p>

    <p>A silver unicorn and a dog, happily mocking each other...</p>

    <p>They were now both spirit beasts signed to the Wang family's small villa's "Ling Zhenren" under "Ling Zhenren's Crispy Noodle Snacks Studio"... The studio name was real and wasn't something that Er Ha had made up, since it was written in the spirit beast contract!</p>
