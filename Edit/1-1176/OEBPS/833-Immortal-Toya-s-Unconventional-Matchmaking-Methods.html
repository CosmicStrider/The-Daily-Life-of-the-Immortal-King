  <h1>Chapter 833 Immortal Toya's Unconventional Matchmaking Methods</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Immortal Toya never thought the truth would turn out to be like this...</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "So... the real reason why Miss Liu has been chasing Wang Zhen, is all for beating him up?"</p>

    <p>Miss Liu kneaded her legs with an "as it should be" expression on her face. "Of course! Otherwise?"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "..."</p>

    <p>Miss Liu: "Wang Zhen that guy doesn't think I'm pursuing him, does he? That's so narcissistic! It's true that my Liu family isn't ranked as high as the Wang family, but he should know that back then when our Liu family was strong, we were able to make it into the top three on the list, and almost overthrew the Wang family so that they almost fell from their superior position. His Wang family is indeed amazing - it's said that the Wang family's very first head was the founder of Nine-fold Star. But the Wang family now isn't superior enough to rule, and there's a big gap between them and the Gu family ranked first. His Wang family should have the clearest idea of the reason for this! Isn't it because their younger generations never thought about moving forward, relying instead on their family's hegemonic position to piss around until they die? They think their family can rule forever! In the end, the Wang family's power collapsed at some point, which was when they fell into a slump. Only then did the Wang family really take things seriously."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "Eh..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya didn't quite understand the power struggle between families on Nine-fold Star, but he was quite interested in it as he listened to Miss Liu. The most crucial thing was that he realized he couldn't interrupt her at all. Miss Liu had been in a coma for too long, and had never been able to give vent to the depression she had suppressed in her heart for so long. Now that she was talking about it, she couldn't stop.</p>

    <p>"But by the time the Wang family started to take it seriously, it was already too late. In the beginning, the gap between the Gu family and the Wang family wasn't big. When the Wang family fell into a slump, the Gu family was able to surpass them several times, and finally took the supreme position, knocking the Wang family off their pedestal."</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi chuckled, an unbridled look in her eyes. "And so the Wang family will ally with our Liu family through marriage. The word outside is that when our Liu family found out about the marriage alliance, we were like a grandson seeing his granddad, and so happy to hug the Wang family's thigh. But in my view, we are the granddad and the Wang family the grandson! And this Wang Zhen is completely a little brother!"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "..."</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi: "So my number one reason for coming to the world below this time is to kill Scoundrel Cao <sup>1</sup> ... no, kill Scoundrel Wang!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Refers to Cao Cao, the
Chancellor of the Han Dynasty
who laid the foundations for
the future kingdom of Wei ..)</dfn>

    <p>When Miss Liu said this, Immortal Toya noticed that her legs seemed to be pretty much recovered. She was now doing forward bends on the bed and was so flexible that her elbows could touch her toes.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya sighed and felt that it was such a pity. This was such a nice girl! Also, she wasn't an A-cup! They looked pretty impressive! She had fair skin and curves! Furthermore, she was so remarkably flexible, you were certain to unlock many new positions!</p>

    <p>"Miss Liu, you just woke up, so it might take some time for your lower half to recover. I'll go get you a cup of tea for your blood circulation, which will speed up your recovery," Immortal Toya said.</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi didn't act like a stranger. "Thank you for taking care of me for so long! I'll be sure to pay you back later!"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya laughed. "With pleasure!"</p>

    <p>In fact, pouring tea was secondary.</p>

    <p>It was just that Immortal Toya needed to tell the other side that she had woken up...</p>

    <p>In exchange for information on the Domain of the Gods, he had promised he would notify Wang Zhen if he had any updates or information on Liu Qingyi.</p>

    <p>And then there was one more thing...</p>

    <p>As the saying went, better to tear apart ten temples than a marriage.</p>

    <p>Although they had no feelings for each other now, they really were a good match... Immortal Toya wanted to set them up.</p>

    <p>Having come this far, they couldn't be pulled together through normal means.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, Immortal Toya could see that both of them were a bit of the tsundere type...</p>

    <p>What was the best way to deal with a tsundere?</p>

    <p>Play hard to get!</p>

    <p>But whether this succeeded or not would ultimately still depend on these two people's fate!</p>

    <p>Leaving the treatment room, Immortal Toya looked up at the sky and sighed. He suddenly recalled that he wasn't a matchmaker, but an alchemist...</p>

    <p>Well...</p>

    <p>Whatever. In this world, there were a lot of people who were distracted from their work by other things.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Ten minutes later, Wang Zhen learned that Liu Qingyi had woken up. Furthermore, Immortal Toya relayed what she said after waking up, word for word, to Wang Zhen.</p>

    <p>On the other end of the call, Wang Zhen's hand trembled as he gripped Wei Zhi's landline phone. "She... she really said that?"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi's face was dotted with sweat at this scene. It was a good thing Wang Zhen's strength was already sealed, otherwise Wei Zhi would have to directly write off his landline.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "Yes, that's exactly what Miss Liu said to me just now, word for word. You can relax now, Mr Wang Zhen, Miss Liu doesn't have any feelings for you, and even wants to kill you."</p>

    <p>In the end, contrary to Immortal Toya's expectations, Wang Zhen blew up. "Fuck! What rubbish is this woman spouting?! How can my Wang family be the grandson? How can her Liu family be the granddad? If it wasn't for the financial aid from my Wang family back then, her Liu family wouldn't even be able to rank in the top ten!"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "Calm down first, Mr Wang Zhen, maybe Miss Liu was a little out of it after waking up."</p>

    <p>"Hehe! This woman is simply playing with fire!"</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen banged his fist on Wei Zhi's sofa. "You! Give her the phone! I'll talk to her myself!"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "But Mr Wang Zhen, didn't you say that you didn't want her to know you're here in the world below..."</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen: "I thought she had a crush on me, I never thought that she wanted to kill me! Where does she get the guts? It looks like all the times I was ambushed in the world above was her doing! I have to get even with her! If I don't teach her a lesson, will she think I'm a pushover? Or you don't have to give her the phone; just tell her, we'll have an outright duel if she thinks she's up to it! Since she's a girl, I'll fight her with just one hand and one leg - I'll still beat her! If we duel, let Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch be our witness!"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen: "Don't space out! Go and tell her now!"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "Alright..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Several minutes later.</p>

    <p>In the treatment room, Miss Liu was so angry that she directly got out of bed, her soft breasts shaking violently. "Did... did he really say that?"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "Yes, that's exactly what Daoist Wang Zhen said to me just now, word for word. You can relax now, Miss Liu, Daoist Wang Zhen doesn't have any feelings for you, and even wants to fight you in a duel."</p>

    <p>Everyone knew that it was human nature to repeat things.</p>

    <p>Everything was going according to Immortal Toya's plan.</p>

    <p>Miss Liu blew up. "Fuck! What rubbish is this man spouting?! When did my Liu family receive any assistance from the Wang family? That was a loan! Do you know what the turnover on a loan is? Our Liu family still had to pay back the money with interest! And we paid it off long ago! It's just a duel, right? Fine! Let's see who kills who! Immortal Toya, can you recommend a place? The best is if Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch's around, in case this dick pulls some dirty trick!"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya thought for a while before saying, "How about... Number 60 High School?"</p>
