  <h1>Chapter 389 Your Good Friend Zhuo Yi Is Online! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>The twelve Golden Core cultivators in the wooden house in this backstreet were some of the main core members of the Demon Hunters Association. At this stage, however, the root of this association had yet to be completely disposed of since its head hadn't been caught.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi and Er Ha's original plan had been to wipe out all the core members in one go, but they had underestimated how cunning this gang of pet traffickers was.</p>

    <p>What was worse, the violent sounds of fighting in the wooden house and the wretched screams of these association core members as they had fallen to the floor had already attracted the attention of many people in the backstreet.</p>

    <p>Some of the pet traffickers had sensed that something was wrong, and were already getting ready to pack up and run. Unfortunately for them, Wei Zhi had made ample preparations.</p>

    <p>Er Ha looked out a broken window; even from the backstreet, it could already hear the loud sirens coming from outside.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi had called the police earlier, and this seemingly peaceful little town was now already heavily surrounded.</p>

    <p>Even now, large numbers of SWAT officers holding anti-explosion magic shields were pushing deeper into the backstreet.</p>

    <p>This was probably the biggest case of spirit beast trafficking this year. Although currently, the head of the organization had not yet been caught, and some of the core members had fled, Er Ha felt that they couldn't run for very long.</p>

    <p>But now it was faced with a new problem, and that was how to get out of here...</p>

    <p>In a situation with so people around, its fur was too eye-catching. If the SWAT teams pushing deeper into this backstreet searched this house and found these twelve Golden Core cultivators lying on the floor... Er Ha reckoned it would be in the headlines the next day.</p>

    <p>It was wondering how it was going to leave when it suddenly smelled a familiar aura in the crowd.</p>

    <p>Roughly two or three minutes later, Er Ha saw a familiar figure... Zhuo Yi had come!</p>

    <p>As usual, Zhuo Yi was wearing a three-piece suit with his hair slicked back in the typical manner of an elite public figure of society.</p>

    <p>"Is this your friend?"</p>

    <p>When Wei Zhi saw Zhuo Yi, he was a little surprised as he felt that this man was familiar for some reason, but for one moment, he couldn't place his finger on it.</p>

    <p>But when he saw the symbol of the General Administration of 100 Schools on Zhuo Yi's chest, Wei Zhi suddenly remembered... Wasn't this person the leader who was the talk of the town recently? He was the youngest director of the General Administration of 100 Schools in history! He was the man who had become famous after using an air attack to defeat a demon king back then.</p>

    <p>Now that Wei Zhi thought about it, there was something a little odd about this man who had shown up at almost every major incident recently — too suspicious!</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi hurried over with a travel bag on his back which had obviously been prepared for Er Ha.</p>

    <p>" <em>Shifu </em>asked me to pick you up."</p>

    <p>As soon as he entered the wooden house, Zhuo Yi straightaway opened the travel bag. From this single simple sentence, Er Ha already knew why Zhuo Yi was here.</p>

    <p>The man and the dog shared a tacit mutual understanding.</p>

    <p>Er Ha didn't have to be polite with Zhuo Yi, and it dove directly into the travel bag; it could already sense the approach of other auras - if any outsiders saw this scene, it would be very troublesome.</p>

    <p>Watching this from the side, Wei Zhi's expression indicated that he didn't quite understand what was going on, but it was awesome anyway.</p>

    <p>This <em>shifu </em>... had to be Brother Dog's owner, right?</p>

    <p>Who on earth this <em>shifu </em>was, was something that Wei Zhi was really curious about.</p>

    <p>To be the <em>shifu </em>of Zhuo Yi, the currently popular director of the General Administration of 100 Schools, and to have such a fantastic dog... all of this started to make Wei Zhi wonder about the power of the great senior behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>After all, not just anyone could learn to cast forty-nine consecutive top-grade auxiliary spells.</p>

    <p>After putting Er Ha into the travel bag, Zhuo Yi finally sighed in relief as he directly put it on his back. Then he straightaway stepped forward with a slight smile on his face to shake hands with Wei Zhi. "Are you comrade Wei Zhi, who reported this illegal trafficking of spirit beasts?"</p>

    <p>They had barely shaken hands when Wei Zhi saw a mob of reporters pour in from behind. As soon as they entered the house, the cameras went off in flashes of light.</p>

    <p>Even Er Ha in the travel bag was alarmed by the situation, let alone Wei Zhi... it was a good thing that Zhuo Yi had shown up earlier on!</p>

    <p>"Mm, that's right... I was the one who called it in." Since Wei Zhi couldn't hide inside the bag like Er Ha, he could only reply as thus.</p>

    <p>The group of reporters then filmed Zhuo Yi and Wei Zhi shaking hands for several seconds.</p>

    <p>After that, a female reporter from <em>Cultivation Daily </em>asked, "Director Zhuo Yi, how is it that the moment something major occurs, you are able to rush to the scene to direct operations? This spirit beast trafficking incident this time doesn't seem to be under the jurisdiction of the General Administration of 100 Schools. Director Zhuo, don't you think that you've overstepped your boundaries?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi frowned and stared at the female reporter with a solemn face. "What this female comrade has said is incorrect... whatever the time or place, as long as the people need me, I should be there."</p>

    <p>Listening to his words, the group of reporters behind them started to take notes.</p>

    <p>The female reporter who had asked the question sighed secretly. This wasn't the first time she had come into contact with Zhuo Yi. She actually thought she had run fast enough in order to be the first to bring the latest news... But she had never expected Zhuo Yi to rob her of every major event headline this year.</p>

    <p>This current leader of the General Administration of 100 Schools was too diligent!</p>

    <p>"Then... is it possible for Director Zhuo to please give us the latest updates on this incident?" the female reporter asked.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi cleared his throat and faced the video cameras and incessant flashes of light. "This is the biggest reported case of illegal spirit beast trafficking this year. Furthermore, based on our investigation, this organization is called the Demon Hunters Association. Some of the criminal suspects are on the run, and specific details will be released in the news to the public later. I believe that with great efforts made by the police, this case will be solved very quickly. You can't run from the long arm of the law."</p>

    <p>"Director Zhuo, who was the one to defeat these criminal suspects lying on the floor?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi instantly perked up at this question, and he hurriedly stepped forward to grip Wei Zhi's hand again. "If you want to thank someone, thank this little brother who reported it! He was the one who defeated all these people! By the time I showed up, they were already down!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi almost spat blood — this was telling blatant lies with your eyes wide open!</p>

    <p>"What's more, looking at the conditions of these twelve criminal suspects after engaging in battle with this person who reported them, they look haggard and gloomy, as if they've been sapped of their strength. So I suspect..."</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, Zhuo Yi looked at Wei Zhi. "This little brother used the legendary... Essence-Absorbing Skill <sup>1</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(In Chinese, 吸精 can mean "to absorb essence" or "to suck in semen" (i.e. a blowjob) ..)</dfn>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "???"</p>

    <p>Essence... Essence-Absorbing Skill?</p>

    <p>The reporters behind them were all astounded.</p>

    <p>The female reporter was very excited. "Lighting! Lighting! Make sure to take lots of photos! Sound, turn on the equipment! Stuff the microphone into this person's mouth!"</p>
