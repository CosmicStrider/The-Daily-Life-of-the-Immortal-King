  <h1>Chapter 521 Immortal Zhenyuan's Three Views Are Refreshed </h1>

  <div>

    <p>This air cannon was released from in front of Er Ha. From what Immortal Zhenyuan could see, this senior dog hadn't budged an inch. Shrouded in the golden light shield, it floated in the air with its eyes closed as it exuded an air similar to a supreme demon king.</p>

    <p>Startled by this imposing bearing, the red-haired young man's thoughts were actually cut off at that moment.</p>

    <p>When he had been quietly speculating on Er Ha's identity earlier, Immortal Zhenyuan had come up with several likely possibilities, based on his years of rich experience, but he hadn't dared confirm his guess.</p>

    <p>Initially, he had thought that this senior dog was probably at peak Venerated Immortal level, but he had immediately discarded this idea after that air cannon.</p>

    <p>Because he could already hear Wind Spirit's wretched shriek from inside the abyss.</p>

    <p>He couldn't help sucking in a cold breath of air.</p>

    <p>Wind Spirit was his inner demon and they shared the same origin; they were both at middle Venerated Immortal level.</p>

    <p>Even if this senior dog had reached peak Venerated Immortal level, it shouldn't be able to make Wind Spirit release such a bitter cry with a mere air cannon.</p>

    <p>This was far beyond the strength of a Venerated Immortal.</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan was stupefied as he gazed at Er Ha, who still had its eyes closed, unperturbed.</p>

    <p>Honestly speaking, this imposing manner intimidated him, and Immortal Zhenyuan felt that his three views had been refreshed.</p>

    <p>Before meeting Er Ha, the red-haired young man had always thought that he had reached the ultimate realm among current cultivators; who could have thought that there actually really was a higher realm than Venerated Immortal.</p>

    <p>To break through to the Venerated Immortal realm, one had to undergo the Samsara Spirit Tribulation, which consumed a tremendous amount of natural spirit energy. Looking at the current concentration of spirit energy in this age, what the scientists had said was indeed true: no one could cultivate to Venerated Immortal level, let alone to higher stages.</p>

    <p>As for why Immortal Zhenyuan himself had been able to cultivate up to now, one reason was certainly because of his advanced cultivation skills, but actually, luck had also been a major factor — he had discovered an energy substitute with a higher density than spirit energy, and he had used this form of energy to get to this point.</p>

    <p>It had been an extremely painful process compared with using spirit energy, and Immortal Zhenyuan had felt like dying when he had "installed" this new energy system in his body.</p>

    <p>It was at this time when his inner demon, whom he now called "Wind Spirit," had been separated from his body.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Hit by Wang Ling's cannon, Wind Spirit was pushed several hundred meters deeper into the bottom of the abyss.</p>

    <p>He was still alive and breathing, though one of his arms was broken.</p>

    <p>Wind Spirit clenched his teeth and immediately used a healing spell to heal his injury, but it took a very long time!</p>

    <p>Was this a "major damage" effect?</p>

    <p>He had never expected this spell to have this sort of attribute, much less that it would be a dog to release this grade ten spell, which had effortlessly engulfed the God Elimination Blade.</p>

    <p>This definitely wasn't the strength of a Venerated Immortal.</p>

    <p>A Venerated Immortal couldn't deal very much damage to him, but that attack just now had almost killed him!</p>

    <p>When Wind Spirit flew out of the abyss, battered and filthy, Immortal Zhenyuan was once again shaken by what he saw.</p>

    <p>Wind Spirit had sustained heavy injuries; his mouth and nose were bleeding, and most crucially, his right arm had been directly blown apart by that attack!</p>

    <p>Immaterial, Wang Ling stood behind Er Ha as he stared carefully at Wind Spirit in front of him. This energy being was a manifestation of Immortal Zhenyuan's inner demon, and it was gradually growing more and more substantial; it exuded an evil feeling, one that was far heavier than Evil Sword God's.</p>

    <p>After all, both their strengths weren't at the same level.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling hadn't instantly killed Wind Spirit in one strike and had instead held back. For one thing, it was his first time meeting a Venerated Immortal and he wanted to test the other party a little. However, he didn't want to expose his identity in front of Immortal Zhenyuan, so this inner demon was simply a golden opportunity for him to try some things out.</p>

    <p>This was a type of energy being that had manifested into a spirit; it stood outside of the three realms and the five elements <sup>1</sup> ... It was something that shouldn't exist in this world, so Wang Ling wouldn't feel guilty if he truly destroyed it.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Basic tenets of Daoism..)</dfn>

    <p>After that friendly and easy probe just now, Wang Ling did find a difference between a Venerated Immortal and a True Immortal; he had sensed the primordial qi in the God Elimination Blade just now, though it was far weaker than his.</p>

    <p>Why were Wang Ling's spells so destructive?</p>

    <p>Because it was a mix of primordial qi and spirit energy.</p>

    <p>As Wang Ming had guessed, Venerated Immortals had the primordial qi inside their bodies, though their spells still mainly relied on spirit energy as a medium.</p>

    <p>If the medium was different, the spell's effect would also be completely different.</p>

    <p>The atmosphere at that moment was exceptionally heavy, and Wang Ling had Er Ha keep its eyes shut to prevent their covers from being blown.</p>

    <p>This Wind Spirit hadn't yet fully materialized and it was hard to make out his face, but Wang Ling could feel the other party's gaze brimming with resentment and his entire body radiating vicious hostility.</p>

    <p>If Er Ha met this gaze head-on, its legs would definitely turn to jelly; Wang Ling had a customary term for this expression: the "Soft Legs Stare."</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling was completely unaffected by this gaze. Essentially, this oppressive gaze was meant to arouse dread, but the issue was that the primordial qi inside Wang Ling's body could help him control his mood; he couldn't feel fear even if he wanted to.</p>

    <p>So in a normal situation, just avoid eye contact and maintain a steady frame of mind.</p>

    <p>Er Ha closed its eyes; since even its mind was covered in the golden light shield, there wasn't anything worth worrying about at all.</p>

    <p>It wasn't long before Wind Spirit, who was cradling his broken arm as he hovered in the air, couldn't help clenching his teeth when he found that his Immortal Eye Oppression had no effect at all on this dog.</p>

    <p>The main point was that this dog didn't even open it eyes!</p>

    <p>A dog was actually looking down on him!</p>

    <p>As Wind Spirit's hostility increased, Wang Ling sensed an abnormal spirit energy rolling about in the other party's body as his aura soared.</p>

    <p>"Senior Dog, be careful, this Wind Spirit was formed from my inner demon and this hostile air will cause him to go berserk..." Immortal Zhenyuan warned.</p>

    <p>To be honest, he hadn't seen Wind Spirit in such a fury for a long time. Previously, when Wind Spirit hadn't materialized to this level yet, Immortal Zhenyuan had had several chances to annihilate him, but each time at the critical moment, Wind Spirit would go berserk!</p>

    <p>Wind Spirit's combat strength was extremely strong in this state... every time it came to this moment, Immortal Zhenyuan had had no choice but to avoid fighting him.</p>

    <p>This was because Immortal Zhenyuan had to be mindful of one important thing in dealing with Wind Spirit — he couldn't take any heavy injuries, otherwise this inner demon could simply swallow him up.</p>

    <p>"Watch out, Senior Dog!" the red-haired young man shouted.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wind Spirit had already launched his second round of attack!</p>

    <p>He charged over!</p>

    <p>He struck the golden light shield on Er Ha with one punch!</p>

    <p>Then!</p>

    <p>He was directly sent flying!</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan: "Never mind, Senior Dog, pretend I didn't say anything..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>
