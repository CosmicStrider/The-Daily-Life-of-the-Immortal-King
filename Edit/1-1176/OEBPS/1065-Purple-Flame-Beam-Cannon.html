  <h1>Chapter 1065 Purple Flame Beam Cannon</h1>

  <div>

    <p>No job was easy, but not everyone could be actors. Some might persist at it for decades purely because they loved acting, but still wound up as just obscure extras in the end. The career formula that had never changed was hard work + luck.</p>

    <p>Thus, when Tong Ling looked at Wang Ling lying on the ground, he had a strange urge to teach this junior a lesson and make him understand how cruel reality was.</p>

    <p>Of course, the main thing was that Tong Ling found himself envying Wang Ling's face, which made him indescribably annoyed. If he knew Wang Ling's face was already the modified "low-key" version, Tong Ling would probably cough up blood on the spot.</p>

    <p>Tong Ling was playing the role of a demonic Zhuo Yi. Furthermore, their features were pretty similar, and only some delicate brush-ups with makeup was needed to make his face practically identical to Zhuo Yi's. As for the other actor also playing Zhuo Yi, the production crew had found a doppelganger actor from somewhere.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling was lying on the ground, his King's Eye was still active. Even out of his line of sight, his surroundings appeared clearly in his mind like a hologram. The stage name of the doppelganger actor playing Zhuo Yi was Zhuo Fan. He really looked a lot like Zhuo Yi - and he had been born with those looks, not because he had deliberately gotten plastic surgery done to look like Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>In Number 60 High's exhibition room, there was a wall for famous alumni, on which hung Zhuo Yi's picture. It had been taken before he graduated, and he still looked very young.</p>

    <p>And the actor whom the production crew had found looked precisely like that young Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, their auras were completely different, so it actually wouldn't be difficult for Wang Ling to tell them apart if he wanted to.</p>

    <p>Filming of this scene had been delayed for a long time because they couldn't find another willing soul to brave death. The doppelganger actor Zhuo Fan had already finished shooting the scenes of Zhuo Yi before his demonic transformation; now, the crew finally had a chance to film the scenes that came after.</p>

    <p>"Brother Tong, please suck on this black pill during the fight." Before the shoot, a little brother from the props team presented him with a pill. This pill was called Film and Television Special Effects Pill, which was specially produced for film shoots.</p>

    <p>It tasted horrible, however, and left many actors traumatized, but it was vital for the excellent special effects that it produced during filming.</p>

    <p>As long as one had this pill inside their mouth, a person would begin to release thick roiling qi, and even their pupils would change color, making them as terrifying as a fiend.</p>

    <p>"So troublesome - can't you add in the special effects?"</p>

    <p>"We'll have to trouble Brother Tong. With this black pill, the special effects will look more realistic. If you don't want it, I won't be able to explain it to the director..." The props little brother was also helpless.</p>

    <p>Given that filming was about to start, Tong Ling had no time to argue with the props team. Frowning, he took the pill in the end and popped it into his mouth.</p>

    <p>In the blink of an eye, the black special effects pill transformed Tong Ling's body dramatically â€” black qi started to curl all around him. Even his hair and nails grew longer and his muscles expanded, turning him into an unexpectedly burly man.</p>

    <p>This wasn't Tong Ling's first time taking the special effects pill, but the changes it wrought still startled him.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, Brother Tong, this pill will lose its effect after three days! You'll return to normal after that!" The props little brother smiled.</p>

    <p>"Bastard! Three days..."</p>

    <p>When Tong Ling roared, black smoke poured out of his mouth and charged heavily at the props little brother like a dragon.</p>

    <p>Seeing this, Tong Ling wanted to cry but had no tears to shed. His image! It was really ruined this time!</p>

    <p>His life was really so hard!</p>

    <p>"ACTION!"</p>

    <p>Following the chief director's instruction, Tong Ling started acting out his demonic state.</p>

    <p>It was a scene with no lines; it was basically just roaring and blowing up the surroundings.</p>

    <p>This was the embodiment of the work Tong Ling did.</p>

    <p>The truth was that Tong Ling was a genuine action star, and almost all his roles involved fighting. In addition, he had a high realm at the Nascent Soul stage, and he could cast a lot more spells at this level. During his extensive travels all these years, he had learned a varied assortment of spells in line with the requirements of each production crew. His knowledge was profound, thus making him a favorite in show business.</p>

    <p>Following the script, Tong Ling closed his eyes and hovered in the sky. He struck some chuuni poses, then a spell started to form in his hand.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling lay unmoving on the ground.</p>

    <p>But very quickly, his body sensed something peculiar - for some reason, his eyelid, which hadn't twitched in a long time, began to twitch at that moment.</p>

    <p>An eyelid warning?</p>

    <p>Was something dangerous about to happen?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had detected something strange, but didn't show it. He was currently acting as a man who had died with his eyes wide open. He gazed at Tong Ling wrapped in surging demonic qi in the air, and there wasn't the slightest change in his expression.</p>

    <p>"Not bad. Where did you find this extra? He's very promising..." Looking at this scene, the chief director couldn't help praising this performance.</p>

    <p>"My nephew's classmate." The executive director laughed aloud.</p>

    <p>"So it's someone that kid Guo Hao found? He finally found someone reliable. The last few people he introduced were always moving and weren't any good. In the end, they're youngsters who haven't seen much of life and are too restless!"</p>

    <p>"Chief Director is right..."</p>

    <p>"This kid is not bad." The chief director once again praised Wang Ling. "And he's also pretty good-looking... Why do I feel like the more I look at him, the more I like him?"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>"Is he usually as dead as this at school?" At that moment, the chief director turned to look at Guo Hao.</p>

    <p>"That's right, Director, he sits next to me. When my uncle told me he was looking for an actor to play a dead man, to be honest, the first person I thought of was him! No one is more suited to play a dead man than him!" For some reason, Guo Hao said this very proudly</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Dozens of seconds later, Tong Ling finally launched his first attack, which was a lethal spell called Purple Flame Beam Cannon.</p>

    <p>The name sounded very awesome, and when it was released, its momentum was astonishing.</p>

    <p>The beam shot down as if from a railgun. When it hit the earth, it created a massive light wave explosion which kicked up dust and rubble in its wake, and thick smoke filled the air.</p>

    <p>Before filming began, Tong Ling had wanted to tease Wang Ling. He deliberately controlled the angle of the beam cannon so that some of the rubble from the explosion would fall on Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Tong Ling was unexpectedly cheerful at seeing how he was dirtying this young man.</p>

    <p>But he very quickly realized that there seemed to be something wrong.</p>

    <p>Who knew what had gone wrong -</p>

    <p>His Purple Flame Beam Cannon actually wasn't stopping!</p>
