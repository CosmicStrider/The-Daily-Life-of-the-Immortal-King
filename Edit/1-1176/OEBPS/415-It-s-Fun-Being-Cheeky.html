  <h1>Chapter 415 It's Fun Being Cheeky! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't expect a single ring to actually cause such a huge misunderstanding, but it was Lord Diulei's fault for being careless enough to put the ring on his ring finger. Wang Ling felt that the other man had probably neglected to think about the impact the ring would have after he received it.</p>

    <p>Luckily, Wang Ling hadn't been implicated in this matter; if he came out now to speak for Lord Diulei, it would conversely make people suspicious.</p>

    <p>This group of people had never lacked imagination, and always eagerly looked forward to a show, especially Dharmaraja... This kind of cultivator who specialized in thunder and lightning spells was usually wild and unruly by nature, and brimmed with enthusiasm on par with a neighborhood committee of aunties.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, it was still Lord Diulei who would have to justify himself. If he couldn't give a good enough reason, it was very likely that his image in everyone's hearts would collapse... because usually, something like a secret marriage happened when someone turned "from delight to dad" <sup>1</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A direct translation of the Internet phrase 喜当爹,used to ridicule guys who are cuckolded in the sense that the girls they like end up pregnant with someone else's child, usually the Mr Perfect-type, and they wind up raising the kid.)</dfn>

    <p>Gossip Room.</p>

    <p>The gossip was still ongoing...</p>

    <p>Just because of one ring, the people in the chat group were in discussion for a long time. While Lord Diulei's realm had currently come to a standstill at the peak late Soul Formation stage, he was only one step away from advancing his realm through enlightenment on the way of Tao. Nevertheless, he was still popular and widely known in the cultivation circle due to his character setting as a person of justice and the "death-courting spirit" of someone who wouldn't submit to force.</p>

    <p>Because of that, everyone in the group was especially concerned. If someone with hidden motives in the cultivation circle used this hidden marriage to attack this character brimming with justice, the aftermath would have a very severe impact.</p>

    <p>It wasn't like Wang Ling didn't understand this. It had been quite a number of years since this chat group had been established, and they had all met each other outside the chat. They had experienced all kinds of hardships together, so their feelings were genuine.</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja: "Everyone, whatever the truth is, let's keep quiet for the time being until we have enough evidence. Maybe Senior Immortal finds it a troubling matter to mention! Blatantly asking him about it to his face isn't good! It's not giving him face!"</p>

    <p>Staring at the screen, the corners of Wang Ling's lips twitched. "..." <em>You pulled so many people in to chat about it, and you actually still want to consider 'face'? Isn't this being too particular?!</em></p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren: "What do you mean, Dharmaraja?"</p>

    <p>Lightning Dharmaraja: "The best way to handle this is to ask him in a roundabout way... In addition, we have to collect as much evidence as possible. The best case scenario would be if Senior Immortal told us himself, otherwise we can use the evidence to ask him personally. What we have to do now is to look for and obtain the hammer <sup>2</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is a literal translation of the online catchphrase 求锤得锤,which refers to a phenomenon, usually in the entertainment industry, of someone spreading news and only releasing evidence to support it after calls are made for them to do so.)</dfn>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>"Senior Immortal's secret marriage is neither a major nor a minor matter; fortunately, we few are the only ones who know about it. If people outside hear about it, it would be a very wretched end for Senior Immortal..."</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, Dharmaraja paused, and shortly after that, shared a map of the area around his place.</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja: "Looking at the direction Senior Immortal is headed in, the next person he'll be seeing should be you, Immortal Toya."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya sighed. " <em>Ai </em>, I was just about to refine elixirs... But Senior Immortal's matter is more important. Don't worry, everyone, I'll definitely be careful in my responses."</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja frowned. "There is one more thing that everyone needs to pay attention to. As we all know, Senior Immortal usually has the best relationship with Ling Zhenren, and Brother Xiao Yin is currently staying at Senior Immortal's place for the time being... In order not to alert Senior Immortal, I excluded Ling Zhenren and Brother Xiao Yin when I set up this chat."</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling stared at the screen, his face twitching involuntarily.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing: "???"</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren: "???"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "???"</p>

    <p>Lightning Dharmaraja: "What's going on? Why is everyone sending question marks?"</p>

    <p>Fang Xing couldn't help laughing as he typed swiftly: "Dharmaraja, look at the group members again. Ling Zhenren is in this group."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Instantly, icy cold sweat broke out all over Dharmaraja's body, straightaway drenching his back.</p>

    <p>He opened the group's members list, and sure enough, saw that Wang Ling was in the group. He was so frightened he almost threw his phone away... He had forgotten that Wang Ling's profile picture was blank, so when he had added people, he hadn't checked carefully, and so had included Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Fuck! He really was here!</p>

    <p>Recall!</p>

    <p>Recall quickly!</p>

    <p>If Ling Zhenren saw the message above, it would really be too awkward!</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja wanted to weep but had no tears to shed. He simply wanted to cry over his stupidity! And by the time he wanted to recall what he had said... it was too late.</p>

    <p><em>System hint: You can't recall chat content over two minutes old...</em></p>

    <p>It was all over... Game over!</p>

    <p>When he saw that he was unable to recall his message, Dharmaraja continued to sweat as he flooded the screen with a series of emojis to push his previous message up.</p>

    <p>This was too awkward!</p>

    <p>From the screen, everyone could feel how flustered Dharmaraja was.</p>

    <p>After sending three emojis of teary smiles in a row, Dharmaraja weakly asked, with a last glimmer of hope, "Anyway... Senior Ling hasn't been speaking all this time, he's probably not online now, right?"</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren sent several candle emojis. "Dharmaraja, my condolences."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing copied her message. "Dharmaraja, my condolences."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "Dharmaraja, is this your first day in the group... Ling Zhenren is probably lurking like he always does."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja felt his embarrassment cancer <sup>3</sup> flare up. It hadn't even been ten minutes since this chat group had been set up, and Senior Ling usually only took a look once in a while... Even if he was a lurker, he couldn't lurk all the time!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>('Embarrassment cancer' is an online term used to describe how people unconsciously want to avoid an embarrassing situation.)</dfn>

    <p>Dharmaraja wiped at his cold sweat and still felt that he had a lifeline. "Impossible... I can't be that unlucky..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Just then, a familiar ellipsis appeared! — This was the ellipsis exclusive to Ling Zhenren, and not only was it in large font, it was also in bold!</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja looked at the profile picture and was already feeling a little hysterical: Mm, blank... Senior Ling was truly lurking! Wonderful!</p>

    <p>"..." Cailian Zhenren.</p>

    <p>"..." Immortal Toya.</p>

    <p>Even Nine Times Man couldn't take it anymore. "Senior Dharmaraja, there is no harm in apologizing?"</p>

    <p>In the whole chat group, only Immortal Toya and Wang Ling knew the real identity of Nine Times Man; this was actually Blademaster General Yi's side account.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya sighed in his heart. It was obvious that General Yi was surreptitiously telling Dharmaraja what the first thing he had to do was, after offending his seniors: sometimes it was better to be frank rather than coy.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, it was clear that Dharmaraja hadn't grasped this.</p>

    <p>A minute later...</p>

    <p>There was a message from Lightning Dharmaraja: "Everyone, I am truly sorry: it was my little brother sending messages with my account... I'm sorry to have troubled everyone!"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Soon after that, everyone saw Wang Ling send a series of "kitchen knife" emojis. There were exactly six of them, wonderfully consistent with his ellipsis<sup>4</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>4</sup>(In Chinese, the ellipsis consists of six dots..)</dfn>

    <p>Fang Xing: "Dharmaraja, farewell..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "We will remember you."</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren sighed. "Everyone remember, Master Dharmaraja was a decent man when he was alive..."</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja screamed in misery. "Senior Ling... I was wrong!"</p>
