  <h1>Chapter 940 Cosmic Brain King Clan</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At the same time, in an unknown spirit world, a 3D image of Group Leader Detention Island was being projected in the middle of a room. Every group leader was marked on it with a red dot, and these were all group leaders who had been detained.</p>

    <p>They had been imprisoned on this Detention island which saw no sun for various reasons. Some hadn't met their performance quota, while some had leaked key information on their organization. Although some of them had done it accidentally, they still had to be punished.</p>

    <p>This was the reason why the Governor of Dark Network could remain all-powerful for so many years and hadn't been toppled.</p>

    <p>"Look, Lord Brain King, someone has snuck in," said an octopus-like monster in front of a massive computer screen.</p>

    <p>No one would expect this to be the Governor of Dark Network's true form.</p>

    <p>The computer screen was part of a mainframe with thousands of ports which the Governor's tentacles were plugged into.</p>

    <p>That was right, the Governor's true form was in fact a mechanical octopus which wasn't from Earth, but had been completely created out of Lord Brain King's mouth.</p>

    <p>An image of a brain appeared on the screen as a deep and impressive voice rang out. "It looks like this place has been discovered... We're one step closer to our grand plan, we must in no way alert the enemy."</p>

    <p>"It looks like Lord Brain King already anticipated this. It is this subordinate who is slow-witted."</p>

    <p>"All the people locked up on Detention island are the people we wrongly selected over the years. None of them are the smartest people I'm looking for on this planet."</p>

    <p>"But in the end, these are just losers who vent their feelings online; why is Lord Brain King focused on them?"</p>

    <p>"That's not right."</p>

    <p>The brain on the screen flickered and said in a low voice, "There's something called a bullet message culture on Earth, but it has now become a hotbed of trolls and keyboard warriors.</p>

    <p>"I've long heard that there are a wealth of masters behind these bullet messages, so I've always believed that the smartest people on Earth are definitely in this group of keyboard warriors.</p>

    <p>"In the last few years, the reason I asked you to continue expanding the water army was to find these intelligent people. Devouring the wisdom of the smartest people will pave the way for my gaining a foothold in the universe. That Divine Dao Star has devoured many planets, but my Brain clan has yet to collapse because my ability to calculate things far surpasses that of Divine Dao Star's Star Lord."</p>

    <p>"Your Highness is wise, this subordinate is unworthy."</p>

    <p>"The stars of my Brain Clan knew that Divine Dao Planet's Star Lord was plotting against us, which is why we've been fighting a guerrilla war all this time. Now, Divine Dao Planet wants to establish diplomatic relations with Earth; presumably, Star Lord must have been impressed by the intelligence of the Earthlings. I was already going to give up hope on Earth, but it now looks like it will be a huge loss if we don't find these wise men."</p>

    <p>"But Lord Brain King, this subordinate thinks we might have made a mistake... The smartest person might not necessarily be among these trolls who can only post bullet messages and dislikes."</p>

    <p>"Are you questioning this king's authority?"</p>

    <p>The big brain on the screen hissed with sound, releasing brain waves that rippled out like a magical pulse and making the mechanical octopus quiver.</p>

    <p>"Your Highness, please calm down, it is this subordinate who is slow-witted."</p>

    <p>"We don't need to pay attention to these invaders for now; I have a feeling that we'll be able to find a wise man very soon."</p>

    <p>Brain King said, "Also..."</p>

    <p>The mechanical octopus: "???"</p>

    <p>Brain King: "When I'm speaking, can you not lick the screen? Even if you are a standard bootlicker, your behavior is disgusting..."</p>

    <p>The mechanical octopus: "I - I'm so sorry, Your Highness! I worship you too much!"</p>

    <p>Brain King: "No, you have to fix this habit of licking the screen."</p>

    <p>As soon Brain King said that, the image on the screen had already switched to that of a celebrity's picture.</p>

    <p>This was currently the most popular idol on Earth. Not only did he have over one hundred million fans, anything he posted on his Weibo account could be shared over one hundred million times. He was a male celebrity with fair skin that was so soft it was almost translucent. Looking at him from afar, one could only ask, "Can you tell the gender<sup>1</sup>?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The last line of the "Ballad of Mulan.")</dfn>

    <p>"Your Majesty, I was wrong! I will never lick the screen again!" The mechanical octopus felt like puking.</p>

    <p>In that moment, it couldn't control its mouth, and threw up a huge pile of screws...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, Evil Sword God realized he was trapped.</p>

    <p>This Detention Island was so scary. It was filled with disgusting fat shut-ins, and even if they hadn't touched him yet, Evil Sword God still felt nauseated from the bottom of his heart.</p>

    <p>And now, these people were staring at him with hungry eyes and closing in on him from all directions.</p>

    <p>"You... stay away!" Without his eyeshadow, Evil Sword God was very cowardly. Now, besieged by a group of bald and fat shut-ins, some of whom weren't even wearing clothes, he made sounds of resistance.</p>

    <p>But the voice changer was still in effect!</p>

    <p>This directly led to the opposite reaction - some people were already so excited that they got nosebleeds. None of the group leaders imprisoned on Detention Island were female! Now that such a pretty girl had landed here, they naturally had to take "good care" of her.</p>

    <p>"Little sister, come on! Are you playing hard to get?"</p>

    <p>"The more you resist, the more excited we are!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God had clearly underestimated how lethal an effect his crossdressing had on this group of fat shut-ins.</p>

    <p>Adding in the fact that this bunch of group leaders had been imprisoned on Detention Island for too long, they were bursting with all kinds of emotions now and needed to take it out on something; basically, they would be excited as long as it was a woman.</p>

    <p>"Looks like Old Evil is going to give away his first time here..." In the prison van, the Old Devil said a prayer for Evil Sword God at the scene being shared.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Cheng Yu suddenly thought of a serious problem. "Wait a minute, Old Gua, the three of us are sharing minds now. If Old Evil really gives away his first time here, we will feel whatever he suffers..."</p>

    <p>Huang Youliang: "..."</p>

    <p>"Fuck!" As if waking up from a dream, the Old Devil was so frightened that he broke out in a cold sweat.</p>

    <p>If Evil Sword God couldn't protect his "chrysanthemum" on Detention Island, all their chrysanthemums would suffer!</p>

    <p>"Old Evil! Don't give up, Old Evil!" the Old Devil yelled.</p>

    <p>No longer acting like a spectator, thoughts flew quickly through his head as he searched for a way out of this hopeless situation.</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God was about to drown in this group of squishy fatties, like a little white rabbit sinking in mud.</p>

    <p>"Old Evil! Hurry up and punch yourself! You should be fine if you can give yourself a black eye!"</p>

    <p>During this crisis, the Old Devil had an idea.</p>

    <p>"Looks like there's no other way..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this suggestion, Evil Sword God grit his teeth, clenched his fist, and punched himself hard in the eye...</p>
