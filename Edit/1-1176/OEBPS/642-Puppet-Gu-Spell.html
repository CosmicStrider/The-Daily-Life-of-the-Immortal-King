  <h1>Chapter 642 Puppet Gu Spell</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Not the Puppet Spell... but the Puppet Gu Spell?" Immortal Zhenyuan wore an expression of enlightenment and his admiration of "Senior Dog" immediately surged again like ocean waves.</p>

    <p>As expected of Senior Dog; even a servant under him could think of something in a flash. Why hadn't he thought of it?</p>

    <p>Indeed, if it was the Puppet Gu Spell, which was a more sinister spell than the Puppet Spell, controlling such a vicious beast was no longer a fantasy. The Puppet Gu Spell involved enhancing the Puppet Spell with a venom technique. The "string" and "incantation" used to control the puppet weren't the same; for the Puppet Gu Spell, a Gu bug had to be placed inside the body of the would-be puppet, and the strength of its poison combined with the "string" and "incantation" used would boost the Puppet Spell.</p>

    <p>To control such an enormous vicious creature, the Gu bug inside it had to be frighteningly big!</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan opened his Immortal Eye and spirit light shot straight out. He was going to use it to see through the scavenger kun's skin into its body, but very soon, he closed the Immortal Eye when it didn't work.</p>

    <p>This was because the main energy source which drove this scavenger kun was the same as for the baby multi-fanged kun previously; both used primordial qi. The Immortal Eye, which largely used spirit energy as its energy source, thus had no way of penetrating the skin of a body covered in primordial qi.</p>

    <p>"As I thought, it's no good..." Immortal Zhenyuan sighed. Currently, he had too little primordial qi in his body.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin licked his lips. "Want to cut it open for a look?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan suddenly felt that this Miss Xiao Yin was a little scary.</p>

    <p>Cut it open...</p>

    <p>How could it be that easy?</p>

    <p>He had used Red Moon Blade Disk earlier to cut off the fishing line on the back of the vicious creature, and the weapon's blade points had also partly scratched the surface of the scavenger kun's skin, but this seemingly "soft" skin was unexpectedly firm and couldn't be broken.</p>

    <p>His Red Moon Blade Disk was a world-defying magic weapon! Its grade might not be high among world-defying magic weapons, having only just become an eighth-class weapon...</p>

    <p>But this eighth-class world-defying magic weapon was still his life bonded magic treasure, with enough devastating power to very easily split open the immortal body of a True Immortal!</p>

    <p>Yet such a magic weapon actually wasn't the least bit effective against this primordial vicious beast.</p>

    <p>"Since this vicious creature is no longer moving, let's find a way first to plug up the crack." Immortal Zhenyuan frowned slightly; he wanted to close up that unusual space rift first before something untoward happened.</p>

    <p>But just as he was about to make a move, a very aggressive sense of oppression emanated from the space rift.</p>

    <p>"Senior Dog! Something's coming out again!" Immortal Zhenyuan cursed in his heart.</p>

    <p>Er Ha and Xiao Yin were on their guards simultaneously; because of the golden light shield on their bodies, this pressure had a limited effect on them. Looking at the way things were going, however, this rift was probably going to spit out yet another extraordinary thing.</p>

    <p>The baby multi-fanged kun in Demon Saint's Holy Palace and this young scavenger kun in front of them...</p>

    <p>What was it going to be this time?</p>

    <p>At this moment, a faint sense of tension lingered in the air.</p>

    <p>"It's a big one this time!" Xiao Yin tsked. Although the monster in the rift had yet to emerge, he could already feel that the vicious creature inside wasn't simple.</p>

    <p>This pressure might be from an adult primordial vicious beast.</p>

    <p>"Let's try the hammer," Er Ha reminded them at that moment.</p>

    <p>They weren't anxious at all; after all, the hammer which Little Master Ling had just made with his own two hands was here. If they really encountered an unbeatable foe, they could just use the hammer!</p>

    <p>They couldn't do anything else now even if they wanted to... How could they defeat this type of monster?</p>

    <p>As Xiao Yin had guessed, it was a big guy this time.</p>

    <p>The space fissure visibly split open to become wider than before... Then, a rotten-smelling scavenger kun larger than the young scavenger kun from before flew out of the rift!</p>

    <p>This scavenger kun was more than ten times the size of the one on the ground! It flew out of the rift like an aircraft carrier, its massive shadow directly covering them and throwing Er Ha's startled expression into shade.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, this was only half of its body; the other half was still in the space rift!</p>

    <p>This thing... was too big!</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan was hugely alarmed. "It really is an adult scavenger kun..."</p>

    <p>"But this one has only just matured; a true adult scavenger kun is even bigger." Xiao Yin's face was as unruffled as an ancient well. While this vicious beast was large, Xiao Yin wasn't the least bit afraid. Back then, when Dog Saint grew to double its size, it was even bigger than this! If it wasn't because Dog Saint had been careless and was drugged by those cultivators, and couldn't use his double-size mode before he was turned into a spicy hot pot stew... the Holy Dog clan wouldn't have become extinct.</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan, Er Ha and Xiao Yin scattered as they withdrew a little.</p>

    <p>To their surprise, this adult scavenger kun didn't seem intent on attacking; instead, it directly opened its large mouth and looked like it was about to gobble up the young scavenger kun on the ground.</p>

    <p>"Looks like that angler wants to use this adult scavenger kun to swallow up this young scavenger kun on the ground and take it back!" Immortal Zhenyuan guessed the intentions of the person behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>"Then we must not let him succeed," said Er Ha, frowning.</p>

    <p>With the angler choosing a retrieval rather than attack strategy, this was enough to prove that this young scavenger kun on the ground had a secret that the angler didn't want them to find out!</p>

    <p>As for exactly what kind of secret this young scavenger kun was hiding, they wouldn't know until they could cut open its belly!</p>

    <p>"Stay back, senior, let me do it!" said Immortal Zhenyuan, and he rushed forward first.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Alright..."</p>

    <p>In the confrontation with the young scavenger kun, it was already clear that Red Moon Blade Disk's attack was fairly ineffective; it would be practically impossible to do any sort of harm to this adult scavenger kun.</p>

    <p>All their hopes now rested on that little hammer...</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan gripped the hammer tightly. He had never seen one like this before and it wasn't anything special to look at.</p>

    <p>But since it was "Senior Dog" who had created this hammer, it should be effective, right?</p>

    <p>Thinking this, Immortal Zhenyuan lifted this small, pitch-black hammer and swung it directly at the adult scavenger kun.</p>

    <p>"Bang!"</p>

    <p>There was a muffled sound as it hit, and Immortal Zhenyuan was flung back but wasn't hurt.</p>

    <p>The moment he was flung back, the adult scavenger kun that had been struck by the hammer roared explosively with pain and stopped trying to swallow the young kun right away... it had been weakened!</p>

    <p>"This is the 'all living things are equal' effect! Hurry and attack!" Er Ha warned.</p>

    <p>"Okay, senior!" Immortal Zhenyuan grit his teeth and Red Moon Blade Disk started spinning again!</p>

    <p>The moment Red Moon Blade Disk touched the adult scavenger kun this time, it didn't bounce off, and the blades cut ruthlessly into the vicious creature's flesh, like a meat grinder pulverizing meat!</p>
