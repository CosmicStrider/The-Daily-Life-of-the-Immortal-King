  <h1>Chapter 1116 Survival Expert San Yuan</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Tuesday, November 11th.</p>

    <p>After "knowledge of spirit plants" and "knowledge of the opponents," Headmaster Chen gave Wang Ling and the other students participating in the competition the third lesson in the special training class: "combat training."</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen already spent a day covering pretty much all the main points in the first two lessons; it would be up to Wang Ling and the others to go back and memorize as much of the rest of the content in the handouts as possible.</p>

    <p>The body technique exchange meet had been upgraded to a national level competition, and Number 60 High just so happened to be on the cusp of being promoted to a key city high school, so Headmaster Chen really wanted Number 60 High to shine during the competition. If he could raise Number 60 High up a notch during his tenure as headmaster, it would be a huge advantage in his career in the future as well as for the students and teachers here.</p>

    <p>The eight-day battle for survival in the wild would be an arduous assignment.</p>

    <p>Students from 102 high schools across the country were going to be thrown into the massive region that was Nine Dragon Mountain. The national competition this time was going to be a lot more challenging and dangerous than in previous years.</p>

    <p>The body technique exchange meet that had been organized at the district level for several years running was small, so the selected field maps were nowhere as vast as Nine Dragon Mountain.</p>

    <p>Even in a relatively smaller area, students in previous years had still been at risk of being wiped out completely.</p>

    <p>Now, they were going to be thrown onto Nine Dragon Mountain. As long as one of them wasn't careful, the whole team might very well be affected, resulting in their collective "deaths."</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen couldn't share very much when it came to battling to survive in the wild.</p>

    <p>Thus, he used his connections to bring in a special teacher.</p>

    <p>An active soldier from the Magnificent Immortal Special Army Brigade: San Yuan, a man who was dressed like an Embroidered Uniform Guard<sup>1</sup>, and completely wrapped up from head to toe.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(From the word "Jinyiwei," who
were the imperial secret police
force in the Ming dynasty ..)</dfn>

    <p>He wore an iron mask engraved with Magnificent Immortal's mark on the lower half of his face. Looking at the sharp eyebrows and bright eyes that were visible, it was clear that he wasn't covering himself up because he was ugly.</p>

    <p>This probably had to do with some sort of secret agreement where San Yuan couldn't reveal his entire face.</p>

    <p>Looking at him, everyone couldn't help marveling at Headmaster Chen's powerful connections.</p>

    <p>This was a soldier from the Magnificent Immortal Special Army Brigade...</p>

    <p>The most famous special army brigade in Huaxiu!</p>

    <p>It carried out many important missions for the country.</p>

    <p>President Qi had previously borrowed Zhai Yin from the brigade to act as Wang Ming's bodyguard. But that was President Qi, one of the Ten Founding Generals. Given his reputation, transferring someone from the brigade would be very easy.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't expect Headmaster Chen to actually have such powerful connections.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, San Yuan was in fact on leave, and was essentially taking a break; he was clearly giving Headmaster Chen face by agreeing to come and teach.</p>

    <p>"Thank you, Brother San Yuan." Headmaster Chen smiled and patted San Yuan on the shoulder.</p>

    <p>San Yuan had been standing ramrod straight from beginning to end, and upheld the excellent military bearing of the special army brigade. It wasn't just Wang Ling and the students in the special class, but many of the other students who were strolling around leisurely on the sports field after class saw San Yuan's extremely solemn figure from a distance.</p>

    <p>"The people in the special training class are so lucky... They're actually being taught by a soldier from the Magnificent Immortal Special Army Brigade."</p>

    <p>"Is he really from Magnificent Immortal? I thought it was cosplay."</p>

    <p>"Nobody would dare cosplay them; that's just asking to be arrested and reprimanded."</p>

    <p>"Ah! I'm so jealous! I'm just not strong enough to be chosen! Can I take a picture?" As soon as this student took out his phone, San Yuan was already looking right at the camera, and the astonishing pressure of his gaze scared the boy so much he froze and accidentally dropped his phone on the ground.</p>

    <p>Seeing this, Headmaster Chen hurriedly apologized. "I'm sorry, San Yuan. I was careless. I'll text the teachers right now to keep an eye on the students and confiscate their phones for the time being. You can rest assured that the school's cameras were turned off when you arrived, and no images of you will be left behind."</p>

    <p>"Mm, thanks." San Yuan's enigmatic masculine voice came out from under the iron mask.</p>

    <p>Taking a deep breath, he turned to the students. "Today, Headmaster Chen asked me to teach you. Do you know what the key factor is for surviving in the wild?"</p>

    <p>"Food and water," Chen Chao answered.</p>

    <p>"That's right. This is a problem which everyone in the wild has to face." Saying this, San Yuan launched into the content of today's lecture. "But this time, you have a more challenging task. Not only do you have to find the right food and water, you also have to be clever and think of ways to battle the other school teams at the same time. So today, our first lesson is relatively simple: It's about eating. You need to put the food in your mouth at the fastest possible speed and eat it."</p>

    <p>"Eat?" Super Guo laughed. "What's there to learn?"</p>

    <p>"It does look simple, but my course is slightly different. The difficulty will be increased later," San Yuan said. All of a sudden, a sparkling and prickly spirit fruit appeared in a glow of spirit light in his hand. The spirit fruit was large, about the size of a coconut.</p>

    <p>"It's Blue Crystal Fruit!" Chen Chao recognized it immediately.</p>

    <p>They already had a lesson on spirit plants yesterday, so they swiftly recognized the fruit.</p>

    <p>Blue Crystal Fruit was a special fruit on Nine Dragon Mountain. In addition to supplying the body with water and filling the belly, this fruit could also supply the body with spirit energy. Furthermore, when its core was ground into powder and applied to a wound, it had the effect of stopping the pain and bleeding.</p>

    <p>This was an extremely versatile fruit.</p>

    <p>However, Blue Crystal Fruit grew in pretty harsh conditions, and couldn't be found in all areas. When Headmaster Chen spoke about it yesterday, he already had a feeling that any area where Blue Crystal Fruit grew would probably become a war zone as student teams vied for resources during the exchange meet.</p>

    <p>San Yuan said, "In our special army brigade, there are times when we don't have enough fasting pills due to the combat situation, so we also look for suitable resources in the wild to replenish our physical strength. However, many edible spirit plants in the cultivation world are big in size. In order not to waste time in battle, we also undergo severe training in eating quickly. Like this Blue Crystal Fruit, for example."</p>

    <p>When he said this, San Yuan already had a hand on his mask.</p>

    <p><em>Whoosh...</em></p>

    <p>In the blink of an eye, that coconut-sized Blue Crystal Fruit in his hand completely disappeared in the next moment...</p>

    <p>San Yuan: "As you can see, in half a second, I took off my mask, ate the entire Blue Crystal Fruit, and put the mask back on."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "???"</p>

    <p>"Of course, I only reached this speed after extensive training. You don't need to be as fast as our special army. Your learning task today is to consume a Blue Crystal Fruit in five seconds. If you don't meet this deadline, you'll have to start over again!"</p>

    <p>San Yuan waved his hand, and gave everyone a fruit. "Now, begin!"</p>
