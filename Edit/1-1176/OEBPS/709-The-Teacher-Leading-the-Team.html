  <h1>Chapter 709 The Teacher Leading the Team</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Ending the call, Night Ghost Spirit Emperor's tight and uneasy frown relaxed a little. His biggest concern had been Huaxiu's customs; if President Dylan had been stopped there, the master plan would definitely be affected. In order to infiltrate the remains this time, timing was a very important factor. It wasn't hard to guess that Huaxiu's higher-ups would definitely be dispatching a lot of experts to defend the remains. If they didn't seize this window of opportunity, the entire plan would become millions of times harder to carry out.</p>

    <p>But since President Dylan had made it through customs, Night Ghost Spirit Emperor was vastly relieved.</p>

    <p>The only thing that surprised him was the "Ghost Head Blade" whom Dylan had mentioned. He had never heard of an assassin with this name before. And the rumor was that he was actually the third disciple of the legendary ancestral teacher of assassins, Numinous Mother?</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor was extremely curious about this person's identity.</p>

    <p>What kind of person was Numinous Mother?</p>

    <p>She was an ancestral-level assassin whose two disciples were reportedly that Gorgeous Itinerant and Daoist Taotie. Although what they had learned only scratched the surface, they were already two epic superstars in the world of assassins... So who was this Ghost Head Blade?</p>

    <p>In Night Chief's headquarters, Night Ghost Spirit Emperor rested his head on his hand in deep contemplation.</p>

    <p>After a while, he raised his head to look at a lab staff member and ask, "Can you help me investigate this Ghost Head Blade's background on the Dark Network?"</p>

    <p>"Please wait a moment, Lord Spirit Emperor." This staff member nodded slightly.</p>

    <p>A few minutes later, information on "Ghost Head Blade" was printed out and delivered to Night Ghost Spirit Emperor.</p>

    <p>After carefully going through the material, his eyes suddenly lit up. So that was it!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was July 31st on the fifteenth Monday of the semester.</p>

    <p>Conceived by Huaxiu Alliance, personally endorsed by Secretary Dakang from the Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools, and led by the General Administration of 100 Schools, the Beast King's Remains summer camp officially began. Students from the Foundation Establishment high schools selected for the summer camp this time were taken by coach to Peiyuan district's public square.</p>

    <p>At ten in the morning, more than a thousand Foundation Establishment students gathered together.</p>

    <p>In addition, there were a lot of teachers in white Daoist robes who stood along the sides of the square to maintain order.</p>

    <p>These teachers were part of the protection team personally selected by Huaxiu Alliance from different schools across the city, all of whom were wearing the same Daoist robe as arranged by the Alliance.</p>

    <p>Their main role on this trip was to ensure the students' safety.</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen, Old Li and Lao Gudong from Number 60 High School were part of this impressive line-up.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling heard that Teacher Pan was also supposed to come... but had directly given it up since she had a Grade Three Dao talisman class on at the same time.</p>

    <p>Of course, this was just the protection that could be seen on the surface; the Ten Generals of Huaxiu Alliance and the humanoid magic treasure "Head of State Number 001" developed by the Alliance would also be providing protection from the shadows. In addition, President Qi would be giving instructions remotely, and if necessary, the Heavenly E-Satellite could provide backup at any time.</p>

    <p>This formidable defense formation looked solid and impregnable, but for some reason, Wang Ling still felt a little uneasy.</p>

    <p>He didn't think it would be a very smooth trip.</p>

    <p>Not everyone shared Wang Ling's feeling.</p>

    <p>A person in line couldn't help taking a photo and was going to show it off in WeChat Moments, but this student's phone was very quickly confiscated by a black-faced teacher in a white robe. "Didn't your teacher tell you that photos are forbidden during this summer camp?"</p>

    <p>This red-faced student's head drooped; it was obvious that the school teacher had specially stressed this point.</p>

    <p>"Devil Valley" Beast King's Remains was a state-protected secret land to begin with, and in previous years, only teams of experts personally endorsed by Huaxiu Alliance had been allowed to explore and study it. This year, a number of places had been specially opened up for a batch of Grade One students; apart from acting as a cover to fool foreign powers, it was actually also a trial run by the Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools this time.</p>

    <p>For many students nowadays, there were some things that couldn't be learned in the classroom.</p>

    <p>Thus, this was indeed a rare cultivation opportunity. However, as the teachers had explained before the students had set out, they could only use their eyes to observe, their ears to listen, their hearts to feel and their heads to remember everything about this secret land - they weren't allowed to make public anything about it in the outside world.</p>

    <p>But it was very clear that not all the students were honest people...</p>

    <p>After confiscating the first cell phone, this teacher then asked repeatedly, "Is anyone else carrying electronic gadgets on them? Hand them over."</p>

    <p>The whole scene was instantly silent.</p>

    <p>After a long while, this teacher smiled slightly before taking out a U-shaped magnet from inside the lapel of his robe and tossing it into the sky.</p>

    <p>All the electronic gadgets which the students in line had on them such as cell phones, wristwatches, MP3 players and tablets were drawn out by the magnet...</p>

    <p>After confiscating these electronic gadgets, this teacher continued to organize the rows like nothing had happened.</p>

    <p>The other teachers all looked like they were used to it. Among lead teachers like these, there would always be one who was the bad cop. It was clear that in order to handle this bunch of Grade One students as well as those that had "rebellious" written all over them, the teachers had already made preparations early on.</p>

    <p>"So strict?" Chen Chao was stupefied, since his cell phone had been one of the "victims."</p>

    <p>"Serves you right, I already told you not to bring it." Guo Hao's expression was one of incredible foresight. "Before the trip, I sounded things out from my uncle - this time, quite a few of the teachers leading us were transferred over from Jinghua city. That bad cop just now is one of them! Do you know Tianshi Imperial High School?</p>

    <p>These words caught Wang Ling's attention, because Tianshi Imperial High was where Fang Xing had studied before transferring to Number 60 High.</p>

    <p>Back then, after Immortal She Pi's execution, Fang Xing had been directly sent to Tianshi Imperial High to study, and he grew up there. This was an aristocratic school on the surface, but to Wang Ling's knowledge, just because you had money didn't necessarily mean you could get into the school.</p>

    <p>The students there weren't simple, nor were the teachers.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, most of the core members of that Society of Saints, which had previously been recruiting Foundation Establishment elites nationwide, were from Tianshi Imperial High.</p>

    <p>After ten minutes or so, the thousand-over students had been sorted by the teachers into several dozen square formations according to gender, height and school. It looked highly organized, and felt like a contingent of the three armed services. A teacher stood in front of each of the formations that they would be leading.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong and Lin Xiaoyu were in the formation next to Wang Ling's and were led by Lao Gudong.</p>

    <p>At first glance, Wang Ling realized that his formation was the only one that didn't have a teacher standing in front of it.</p>

    <p>Could it be that they hadn't been allocated a teacher yet?</p>

    <p>While he was puzzling over this, he saw a familiar black car slowly come to a halt at a distance next to the public square.</p>

    <p>The moment Zhai Yin got out of the driver's seat, it was as if Wang Ling realized something.</p>

    <p>And as expected...</p>

    <p>He saw a dumbass wearing a white coat pass through the crowd to reach them.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming grinned and laughed shamelessly. "Hello, everyone! I'll be the teacher leading you, Lao Gudong Xiaoer! Just call me Big Brother Daidai <sup>1</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>('Dai' is the Chinese word here for 'lead..')</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
