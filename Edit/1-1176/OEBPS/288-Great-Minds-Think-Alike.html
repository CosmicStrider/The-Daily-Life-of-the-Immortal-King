  <h1>Chapter 288 Great Minds Think Alike </h1>

  <div>

    <p>They changed their clothes inside the palace of these two old aunties, Beauty and Discount. Since these two female cultivators had severed ties with the outside world, the only mirrors they had in the palace were bronze mirrors. Standing in front of the mirror, a single glimpse of his reflection out of the corner of his eye was already enough to make Wang Ling instantly want to die... Hm, no way was he letting anyone else see him like this!</p>

    <p>"Wonderful! Wonderful!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei praised Wang Ling while he clapped his hands. "Brother Ling, it's the first time I realize how cute you are!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was wearing the blue Taoist robes and the red veil which the female cultivators had used to cover their faces. The young man in white had never expected that they would suit Wang Ling so well.</p>

    <p>Before he could fish out his phone to take a picture, Wang Ling gave it a light glance out of the corner of his eye, and it instantly crashed.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei froze with surprise before his expression immediately turned pitiful. A picture of Ling Zhenren in women's clothing wasn't something that happened everyday... as a collector's item, it could be worth cities. Unfortunately, the intent was there, but he didn't have the guts to follow through. He had only wanted to check the time when he had taken his phone out just now... Mm, just to check the time! In the end, this small action had rendered his cellphone completely useless.</p>

    <p>He sighed in his heart, took the phone out of his pocket, and removed the SIM card and memory card. "I just bought this phone."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling glanced at the phone; it was the latest Pear model, which was thirty centimeters long.</p>

    <p>The young man in white then dropped this broken phone on the two female cultivators on the ground. "Sorry we've offended you. This phone is useless now, but it may work again after some repairs... and even if it's beyond repair, it's still more useful than a cucumber."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Brother Ling, we're pretty much good to go... yet I still feel like we're forgetting something."</p>

    <p>As he said this, the young man in white shifted his gaze to the fruits on the altar table in the palace. He crooked his fingers, and grabbed two apples that flew at him before stuffing them down his chest. He then turned to Wang Ling. "Brother Ling, do you want any?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..." Drop dead! ...</p>

    <p>At the same time, in the underground palace, the Taoist in red frowned slightly. "Have you locked onto the intruders?"</p>

    <p>Immortal Mansion's Taoist robes were customized with special materials, and these materials could act as verification codes. After intruders entered Immortal Mansion, the Ice Crystal Array could be used to lock onto their auras and immediately track them down.</p>

    <p>"We have a rough lock on them, but..." replied the eastern branch chief.</p>

    <p>"But what?"</p>

    <p>"There seems to be some people missing."</p>

    <p>The eastern branch chief raised his hand. Spirit light sprung up below his sleeve and several scenes were projected in the air. "Master, these are the pictures that have just been transmitted by the holy array. They are all in different locations. The female cultivator's Taoist name is Cailian, and the man with a gourd on his back is Immortal Toya, who has been the talk of the cultivation world in the last few days."</p>

    <p>"Hm, I know both of them," said the Taoist in red.</p>

    <p>"As for the other three... one is Luo Chuang, the owner of Luo Chuang Metalware whom we tried to capture before but failed; the other one is Lightning Dharmaraja, who currently controls the only remaining holy relic, the godly thunder inheritance. The last one..." The eastern branch chief shook his head as he looked at the image. "I don't recognize this person. I have people looking into his identity at the moment."</p>

    <p>"You said there were people missing?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, Master, there are indeed some who are missing," said the eastern branch chief. "All these people revolve around that Great Death-Courting Senior, and the rumor is that there is a person called Ling Zhenren with him. He is the owner of this peach wood sword."</p>

    <p>"Hehe, that's interesting. These two are probably the toughest of this lot to handle. But these are all minor issues."</p>

    <p>The Taoist in red narrowed his eyes as he looked at the eastern branch chief. "I've now found the sword spirit most suitable for becoming a sword soul. In order to produce the ultimate godly sword, whether it's the sword spirit inside or the sword body, everything about it has to be the best. Since I already have the heavenly materials for the sword, I need an experienced smith to do the final forging."</p>

    <p>Eastern branch chief: "Master, you mean...?"</p>

    <p>The Taoist in red smiled slightly. "Before they come charging in, I want you to capture that Luo Chuang and bring him here."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After stepping past the spatial wall, Luo Chuang and Dharmaraja happened to end up in the same team. As soon as they landed, they could sense the array guardian spirits rising up.</p>

    <p>"This is probably the power of some magic weapon, I'm guessing a spirit sword. Drawing on the power of the holy array, it's summoning the spiritual bodies to come together to form the array guardian spirits."</p>

    <p>With just one glance, Luo Chuang had already guessed it. Gazing in the direction of the array guardian spirit's appearance, he probed for auras with his spiritual senses. "Is that... Ling Zhenren's aura?"</p>

    <p>"Should we meet up with them first?" asked Dharmaraja.</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang analyzed the situation. "We're not in a hurry. I reckon that those array guardian spirits will be killed instantly... Our priority right now is to hide ourselves. This holy array is not an ordinary one, and I'm guessing that Immortal Mansion uses it to search for auras and track down intruders."</p>

    <p>It could only be said that Luo Chuang was Luo Chuang. His vigilance far surpassed an ordinary person's in situations like these. His history of coquettish tomb robbing was not in vain, so even though he was big, he was much more thoughtful in his heart</p>

    <p>The two of them took refuge in the palace on Sanyuan Road, and found a hallway to camp out in.</p>

    <p>Immortal Mansion's group of palaces could be accessed from anywhere. At that time, it had already given the order to capture the intruders, so as these two individuals entered on one side, they could sense countless Immortal Mansion disciples moving around on the other.</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja felt his scalp turn numb. "Do you think there might be something else here?"</p>

    <p>"This isn't a tomb... but of course that doesn't necessarily mean that there aren't any ghosts around," said Luo Chuang.</p>

    <p>"Then should we light a candle in one corner and recite 'To seek the dragon through obstacles' <sup>1</sup> ?" said Dharmaraja.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is part of a recitation
which the protagonist uses in
the Chinese fantasy tomb
explorer movie 'Mojin: The
Lost Legend.' If the candle
goes out, it's a sign that
ghosts are present in the
tomb ..)</dfn>

    <p>Luo Chuang: "..."</p>

    <p>They took shelter in this relatively inconspicuous narrow hallway for a while.</p>

    <p>After a moment, Dharmaraja frowned. "Why are all the disciples of Immortal Mansion female?"</p>

    <p>Hearing his question, Luo Chuang was struck by something. "Dharmaraja, did you notice that those array guardian spirits were focused on attacking just Ling Zhenren even when this bunch of female disciples were blatantly moving around outside? I believe that the Taoist robes they're wearing are probably a marker which helps the holy array to lock onto invaders."</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja: "So, Brother Luo, your meaning is...?"</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang answered earnestly, "I think we can dress up as women."</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja: "..."</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja: "Brother Luo, it's a great idea... but are you sure those Taoist robes will fit us?"</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang: "..."</p>
