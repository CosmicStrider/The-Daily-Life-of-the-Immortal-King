  <h1>Chapter 319 Kitchen Knife Sec </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Before long, the deputy director arrived at Zhuo Yi's office with the report. He was a young and honest man called Zhong Lang, who had entered the General Administration of 100 Schools at the same time as Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Not long after that, Zhuo Yi had become the deputy director, and as Zhuo Yi's colleague, Zhong Lang had become the office head. Now that Zhuo Yi had been promoted, Zhong Lang had naturally became the deputy director.</p>

    <p>"Boss, take a look..." After hanging up, Zhong Lang had hastily made his way to Zhuo Yi's office with the report, which was a detailed summary of the information on the twelve students, covering everything from their great-grandfathers to their hobbies.</p>

    <p>As Zhong Lang had reported, these twelve missing students were a mix of guys and girls, and they had different hobbies and routines. They had absolutely nothing in common, except that they were all very attractive. Furthermore, it was all natural good looks; the information also contained photos of them as kids, and these students had all been very good-looking since young.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi drew in a deep breath. "This should be it... I'm guessing that the head behind Shuigou Sect hates good-looking students, and hence is targeting them."</p>

    <p>"Then what should we do now?"</p>

    <p>"Secretary Dakang has requested that we solve this as soon as possible." Zhuo Yi drew out an individual report on one of the students. "Do you know this Xiao Yuncheng? He's the most distinguished disciple in the Xiao clan's outer sect." Zhuo Yi remembered this person well, because Wang Ling had knocked him out of the survival contest right at the beginning during the combined military training for the six schools.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi let out a sigh. "This bunch of people dared lay their hands on someone from the Xiao clan... they must be insane. If we can't solve this case quickly, I'm worried that the Xiao clan patriarch might blow up our office."</p>

    <p>Zhong Lang: "..."</p>

    <p>"Draft up a quick document in the name of the General Administration of 100 Schools and request that every school in Songhai city explain the specifics of the situation to the students' parents. Until this issue is resolved, parents are responsible for taking their kids to and from school from now on."</p>

    <p>Zhong Lang: "What if some parents object?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Then have them take a paternity test."</p>

    <p>Zhong Lang: "Why?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Because then they definitely wouldn't be the student's real parents."</p>

    <p>Zhong Lang: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi released this announcement at eleven in the morning across Songhai city. After that, teachers started making phone calls like crazy to ensure that they had contacted every single parent. Because the missing group was made up of students from Grade One to Grade Three, almost all the teachers were roped into participating in this call operation once the schools received the notification.</p>

    <p>The schools even offered security or for teachers to take home students whose parents really couldn't come to the school.</p>

    <p>In short, the schools had to provide comprehensive security.</p>

    <p>This was a clumsy method, but it was also a relatively safer one. Shuigou Sect wasn't giving anything away, so it would also be helpful if parents could find some clues while taking their children to and from school.</p>

    <p>By releasing this notification, it could be said that Zhuo Yi, more awesome than any army commander, had mobilized all the parents in the city.</p>

    <p>This issue thus became the new topic of discussion among the students that afternoon.</p>

    <p>One by one, the heads of large sects in the cultivation world announced that they would be personally taking children to and from school... normally, these big shots might not even show up at parent-teacher conferences.</p>

    <p>Many students saw this incident as a rare opportunity; while most of them typically made good friends with some of their classmates, they might not know much about their family situations. This incident would reveal more about a lot of people.</p>

    <p>The whole school seemed to be bursting with excitement because of this issue.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's background naturally went without saying; this young miss had been the center of attention since the start of school. Outside school, it fell to the security teams arranged by Huaguo Water Curtain Group to protect her safety.</p>

    <p>After the first afternoon class, Wang Ling heard a lot of gossip from Guo Hao.</p>

    <p>"Have you heard? Several big shots have shown up in the normal classes," Guo Hao said in a low, enigmatic voice.</p>

    <p>"These people hid themselves very well. If it wasn't for how big this incident is, no one would have known about their backgrounds." Someone laughed.</p>

    <p>"We can't say that." Chen Chao shook his head. "It's because their family backgrounds aren't so simple that they kept quiet about it. With that type of background, for them to get into a normal class at an average school would be a pretty embarrassing matter to bring up. If it was me, I would also be ashamed to admit it."</p>

    <p>"That's true..."</p>

    <p>"In Normal Classes One to Three, there are quite a number of people who are the children of sect leaders. In particular, there's one called Jiang Bai, whose dad is the head of Kitchen Knife Sect."</p>

    <p>"Kitchen Knife Sect... what's that?"</p>

    <p>"This is a sect famous for making gourmet food. In the cultivation world, it's also known as New East Cuisine Academy," Guo Hao explained. "I just gave one of my uncles who works there a call to confirm Jiang Bai's background; there's no mistake."</p>

    <p>"You actually have a uncle who works at Kitchen Knife Sect..."</p>

    <p>"Don't underestimate it, their welfare benefits are great. Apart from receiving a fifth-grade black iron kitchen knife as a gift, sect newcomers can also learn their secret "Ox-Dismembering Knife Technique" for free. They have twenty days of annual leave and even double pay at the end of the year. Newcomers who pass their special cooking exam can be directly promoted to become an elder of the inner sect," Guo Hao said. "Also, sects are all divided into different levels: Sky, Earth, Black, and Yellow <sup>1</sup> . Kitchen Knife Sect as led by Jiang Bai's dad is one of the top five Black-level sects, and they have branches in several different cities."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is the first line in the
Chinese poem "Thousand
Character Classic," a text that
has been used to teach
children Chinese characters
since ancient times.)</dfn>

    <p>Many of the students in Grade One, Class Three were startled by Guo Hao's words. There were hundreds of thousands of sects among the light forces in Huaxiu nation, and tens of thousands of Black-level sects. To be able to make the top five out of these tens of thousands of Black-level sects... it already went without saying how incredible Jiang Bai's dad's Kitchen Knife Sect was.</p>

    <p>So a lot of people were taken aback when they heard this. "If Jiang Bai's family background is so amazing, why are his grades so bad?"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao spread his hands. "That's why this shows that your grades have nothing to do with your family background. Father Jiang is so busy managing his sect that he naturally doesn't have time to care about Jiang Bai's studies. If it wasn't for this aggressive new Shuigou Sect, this head of Kitchen Knife Sect might not have taken action."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao sighed. "So every time Jiang Bai gets a bad grade, the teacher in charge of their class always tells him that if he doesn't study hard, he can only take over the sect <sup>2</sup> ."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
