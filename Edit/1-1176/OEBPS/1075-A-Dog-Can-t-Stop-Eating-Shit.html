  <h1>Chapter 1075 A Dog Can't Stop Eating Shit</h1>

  <div>

    <p>There was a saying that a dog couldn't fix its habit of eating shit...</p>

    <p>While Er Ha's soul had already merged with its body to a very great extent after it turned into a dog, Er Ha still saw itself as a grand demon king of the Tuntian Ha clan, and couldn't discard its identity as a toad just like that. However, Er Ha never thought that when it was out walking on the streets and saw a lump of fresh shit that looked just like ice cream, something in its brain would unexpectedly prompt him to give it a lick.</p>

    <p>It was an instinctive reaction, like when a dog lifted a leg to pee.</p>

    <p>By the time Er Ha realized what it had done, it was already too late.</p>

    <p>It had happened so suddenly. Er Ha had been following Wang Ling all the while, but at the time, Wang Ling's thoughts were preoccupied with finding the nine people who had eaten the frozen dumplings, so he didn't pay attention to what Er Ha was doing.</p>

    <p>Er Ha was extremely glad.</p>

    <p>After all, it was very disgraceful behavior.</p>

    <p>But Er Ha never expected a female lunatic with pica to see through it at that critical moment.</p>

    <p>Even the way Xiao Yin looked at Er Ha was different. "Senior brother..."</p>

    <p>Because Xiao Yin had come later than Er Ha, becoming Wang Ling's second combat pet, he already recognized Er Ha as his senior brother. It was just that Xiao Yin had never called Er Ha as such, and it felt like a stab to the heart when Xiao Yin did it now.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "I..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "Senior brother, you don't have to explain. We all understand."</p>

    <p>The head nurse at the back also chimed in, "A dog can never fix its habit of eating shit... We all understand."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha realized at that moment that it had already jumped into the Yellow River and could no longer wash itself clean.</p>

    <p>Of course, Wang Ling didn't react much to Er Ha's behavior, and just felt a little sick.</p>

    <p>Their priority right now was to save the girl in front of them.</p>

    <p>The girl had a crazed expression on her face. After she analyzed what everyone had eaten in the last few hours, Wang Ling thought she would lunge at him, and completely didn't expect her to huddle in a corner and hug her knees.</p>

    <p>"What's going on?" asked Xiao Yin.</p>

    <p>Apart from the head nurse, the other three at the scene were straight men who naturally didn't understand a young girl's heart.</p>

    <p>After seeing the initially deranged girl suddenly calm down, the head nurse actually understood what the girl was thinking. "She probably got shy, or might be trying to appear a little more reserved."</p>

    <p>"Why?" Xiao Yin was puzzled.</p>

    <p>"Why do so many young girls want to lose weight in the beginning? To look good! Why do they want to look good? Looking at the deeper reason, they want to find a boyfriend to love them! For young teenage girls like these in particular, their requirement in a boyfriend isn't necessarily money - for most of them, it's still looks. When they meet a good-looking boy, they'll subconsciously become reserved."</p>

    <p>The head nurse analyzed it logically: "For example, some girls who usually have a huge appetite will become restrained when they start dating. They'll nibble on their food and look a little bashful, completely different to when they put their feet up and gobble down instant noodles."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"And as another example, sometimes young girls like to hold hands and talk loudly with one another, but when they see a good-looking boy passing by, their voices will suddenly become softer and extremely gentle."</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling, Xiao Yin and Er Ha were suddenly enlightened, and they sighed over the truth of things...</p>

    <p>Although this head nurse was like an old cow who wanted to eat grass, her analysis really made sense!</p>

    <p>But here was the problem: Wang Ling didn't think he was that good-looking... he had even specially modified his face; it was really strange if even this would catch the young girl's eye!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling walked over to the room's light controls, and after turning off some of the lights, the girl's Shadow Image very quickly took form in front of Wang Ling â€” it looked like an ox demon, except that instead of horns, there were two ice-cream cones on its head, and it held a baguette in each hand.</p>

    <p>The appearance was a reflection of the mind - this was certainly the case with this girl's Shadow Image.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling went up in a straightforward manner, pulled its jaws open, and entered to look for this girl's heart demon inside the Shadow Palace.</p>

    <p>Once again, Wang Ling appeared in a world which was like an ink and wash painting. Unlike the undertaker's world, however, this world which the heart demon had invaded wasn't a graveyard, but had mountain ranges made up of snacks. All types of potato chips were piled up together, and there was even a network of endless black chocolate rivers which flowed through the entire world - the smell was very strong as Wang Ling got closer.</p>

    <p>It went without saying that he was amazed by this world's landscape.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Er Ha took a few steps forward, and a huge hotpot mountain appeared in front of them.</p>

    <p>It was a massive volcano, and there were a lot of common hotpot ingredients inside the crater, such as fish balls, beef balls, shrimp dumplings, fish rolls and dried tofu rolls. Although everything was black and white like an ink and wash painting, this food's appearance was very distinct, and smelled good - one couldn't help but drool just approaching it.</p>

    <p>"This..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha felt that things weren't looking good.</p>

    <p>It had thought that since the girl had only eaten a bit of the dumplings, the corrosion shouldn't be so serious; it hadn't expected the heart demon corrosion to be far more severe than they had imagined.</p>

    <p>Perhaps this was the result of being restrained for too long.</p>

    <p>Because she had been dieting to lose weight all this time, the girl had constantly suppressed the natural hunger for food. In the end, she was completely triggered after eating a bit of the frozen dumplings.</p>

    <p>All the food in front of them had high calories, which was taboo for people who wanted to lose weight.</p>

    <p>Er Ha didn't dare approach casually, and waited for Wang Ling to make his decision.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling prepared to start searching for clues to the Shadow Palace in this world.</p>

    <p>In the undertaker's world before, the Shadow Palace had been a cabin. But what about the girl's Shadow Palace? Perhaps it was some type of food? Wang Ling made some guesses.</p>

    <p>He sent out the King's Eye to search the area, only to find nothing.</p>

    <p>There wasn't anything similar to a house in this world; perhaps the girl had hidden her Shadow Palace in some sort of food.</p>

    <p>Following behind Wang Ling during their search, Er Ha eventually noticed that they seemed to be going off-track.</p>

    <p>As they walked, Er Ha realized that Wang Ling was actually heading toward a forest...</p>

    <p>"A forest of crispy noodle snacks..." Wang Ling raised his head to look at this forest of crispy noodle snacks. It was densely packed with crispy noodle snack trees! Crispy noodle snack packets dangled like apples from the branches.</p>

    <p>Er Ha was stupefied...</p>

    <p>Who could top this...</p>
