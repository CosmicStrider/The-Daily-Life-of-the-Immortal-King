  <h1>Chapter 550 The Unperturbed Editorial Office </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng rubbed his eyes and dug out his ears repeatedly to confirm that he wasn't hallucinating!</p>

    <p>Yes! He hadn't seen wrong!</p>

    <p>All the programs now were broadcasting news helping Father Wang to campaign for votes. Whether it was sports athletes, local celebrities or big shots in various industries, all of them had started to campaign for monthly votes for Father Wang on TV... Lie Mengmeng looked at the list of trending topics, and sure enough, this matter had already climbed to the top as a hot search, and it wasn't in just one topic.</p>

    <p>In a short instant, trending topics like "XXX Expresses Support for Wang Situ" and "XXX Begs for Votes for Wang Situ" dominated the list.</p>

    <p>"Why isn't anyone reacting? This is a huge deal!!!" Lie Mengmeng expressed his shock with three exclamation points.</p>

    <p>"What do you mean, captain..."</p>

    <p>"Hm... I can't say too much."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Looking at the strength of a society that had currently joined forces on TV and in the list of trending topics, Father Wang could indeed be said to be unbeatable. What kind of power was it that was holding him up behind the scenes... Lie Mengmeng's imagination had already started to run wild.</p>

    <p>The problem was, he hadn't seen Father Wang do anything!</p>

    <p>It seemed that he had merely sent a text message to one of his big shot fans...</p>

    <p>Looking at it now, this clearly wasn't any ordinary big shot; it was very likely a force with a background and foundation that was stronger than any heavenly-level sect.</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng was very perceptive and he expressed his gratitude immediately. "Thank you, captain!"</p>

    <p>There were some things that you could discern but shouldn't speak about...</p>

    <p>"This is a trivial matter; just remember, you just need to keep calm in the future. Also, if reporters come looking for you to interview Lao Gudong Situ or something, the website's general policy is to reject all of them; Lao Gudong Situ isn't interested in any of this. I'll make a point of it at the meeting tomorrow."</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng: "Mm, okay, captain!"</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng nodded weakly. "Yes..."</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was July 18th on Tuesday in the thirteenth week of the semester.</p>

    <p>The "Summit War" last night between both Pork Shoulder and Pig Feet and Father Wang (Wang Situ) ended with Father Wang proclaimed the victor after he obtained a crushing number of votes which turned the tide by midnight; by the end of the double monthly votes campaign, the monthly votes for the two writers Pork Shoulder and Pig Feet were around three million, while Father Wang was far in front with an outstanding six million monthly votes...</p>

    <p>But the truth was that Father Wang's votes last night had actually surpassed ten million; it was just that the website had kept the remaining four million votes a secret with Father Wang's permission.</p>

    <p>After all, they were all authors on the same website and he should help his peers save some face...</p>

    <p>The impact of this incident wasn't minor; Wang Ling heard people around him discussing it on his way to school that morning. After all, so many celebrities had expressed their support last night!</p>

    <p>Yesterday's trending topics had been about the support from various celebrities; today's topic was [Who Exactly Is Wang Situ]...</p>

    <p>As soon as Wang Ling walked into the classroom that morning, he could hear Guo Hao making a ruckus as he recounted the fierce battle in the "Summit War" last night.</p>

    <p>The students in class weren't just simply bystanders; the vast majority were in fact fans of Father Wang... Wang Ling felt that in some sense, his old man was just as invincible as he was.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao slapped his thigh and sighed feelingly. "Wang Situ is really too strong... That wave last night, tch... The only thing he's lacking now is the support of the head of state!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Guo Hao, have you found out anything?" Su Xiao asked.</p>

    <p>Everyone in class couldn't help turning to look at Guo Hao at the same time.</p>

    <p>"I seem to remember you saying last time that you have an uncle who works at Guodian..."</p>

    <p>"What does Guodian have to do with this? Is the factory director going to take the stage?"</p>

    <p>"Guodian... is short for National Telecommunications and Cybersecurity Administration..." The corner of Chen Chao's lips twitched as he replied<sup>1</sup>.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Chen Chao is referring to 'guo' in the Chinese word for 'national' and 'dian' in 'telecommunications.' However, 'Guodian' is the name of one of China's largest suppliers of electricity ..)</dfn>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Last night, one of my uncles indeed did investigate Wang Situ's identity..." Guo Hao sighed when he brought this up and was a little depressed. "But before he could find out anything, he was caught by his leader and punished; he's been suspended for a week, and is writing a self-reflection at home."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Everyone trembled when they heard this, feeling as if they'd gotten a taste of what the forces which ran society were like... That there was something in this world which Guo Hao didn't know was really amazing!</p>

    <p>Just then, Chen Chao joked, "Actually, I've always wondered if this Wang Situ might be Wang Ling's dad. Hahaha! Even the surname is the same!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
