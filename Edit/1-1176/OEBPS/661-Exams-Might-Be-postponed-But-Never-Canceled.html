  <h1>Chapter 661 Exams Might Be postponed, But Never Canceled!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Body Transformation Spell...</p>

    <p>This spell was a profound truth of an immortal body which was capable of reassembling itself together after autonomously breaking down into equal parts. The higher a person's cultivation realm, the more parts their body could split into. Once a person cultivated to the level of the ultimate profound truth, the body could completely transform into a liquid state.</p>

    <p>Yaren had planned to give Elder Ji Xing a surprise, but unfortunately, as soon as Elder Ji Xing walked into the tent, he drank some of Yaren's transformed body tissue.</p>

    <p>No matter what body part it was, the result was excruciating.</p>

    <p>Moreover, because of this missing body tissue, Elder Yaren's recovery time took far, far longer than usual; it wasn't until the next morning that he was completely restored from his fluid state.</p>

    <p>But the most tragic person was still Elder Ji Xing.</p>

    <p>Elder Ji Xing threw up. He threw up all night until even his makeup cracked from all the puking.</p>

    <p>Given the troop's lack of manpower and Elder Ji Xing's utterly wretched state, the revenge plan that had initially been scheduled for Monday July 24th in the fourteenth week of the semester had to be temporarily abandoned and postponed to another day.</p>

    <p>This was an attack plan tinged with some sorrow...</p>

    <p>But this bumpy road to revenge continued ever on.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was Monday July 24th in the fourteenth week of the semester.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling woke up that morning, his eyelid finally stopped twitching.</p>

    <p>It felt like it had been a very, very long time since his eyelid last twitched in warning.</p>

    <p>This indicated that something bad centered around him was going to happen soon.</p>

    <p>In fact, his eyelid had already started twitching since the early hours of the morning, and it had lasted for a full five hours.</p>

    <p>Disaster level, four stars.</p>

    <p>This was possibly one of the most severe warnings Wang Ling had received since he was a child...</p>

    <p>The last time he had received a five-star warning was when he was ten years old and had been on his way to buy crispy noodle snacks before Er Ha fell from the sky and interrupted him. Even now, this scene from six years ago was still fresh in Wang Ling's memory.</p>

    <p>A five-star warning was a city-level disaster.</p>

    <p>A four-star warning...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought it over, and the first thing that came to mind was school.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High might be in danger!</p>

    <p>It wasn't strange for him to come up this conjecture.</p>

    <p>For one thing, that President Bai was still at large. For another, Wang Ling speculated that Zhuo Yi, who had been in the limelight recently and who had served as commander in successive cases, might very likely become the Demon Hunters Association's new target for retaliation when they failed to find Er Ha as well as to take revenge on Xiao Yin.</p>

    <p>Given how ruthless this bunch from the Demon Hunters Association was, just taking care of Zhuo Yi seemed too petty a deal... But, if they could carry out a revenge attack on this Director Zhuo's alma mater, that was sure to be even more traumatic for him.</p>

    <p>So when Wang Ling's eyelid twitched in warning this time, he almost immediately thought of Number 60 High and Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Whether it was the school or this disciple of his, Wang Ling felt he had to protect them himself.</p>

    <p>What kind of joke was this... Number 60 High's first semester final exams were just around the corner, and something just had to go wrong at this critical moment - at Number 60, the exams might be postponed, but they were never canceled!</p>

    <p>The fact was that Wang Ling had already started preparing for the final exams; if they were postponed, the teachers of Number 60 High would most likely change the exam questions, given their "awesome" personalities, and when the time came, his revision would have been for nothing! Wang Ling had spent a lot of time focused on analyzing exam questions these days! Absolutely no one was allowed to ruin the sacred final exams!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was exceptionally resolute on this point.</p>

    <p>Considering the possibility that Zhuo Yi might be in danger, Wang Ling's thoughts moved.</p>

    <p>Next to the bed, Jingke turned into a brown stream of light with a "xiu" sound and disappeared...</p>

    <p>To be on the safe side, Wang Ling thought it was still better for Jingke to go and guard Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>After all, this enemy was more cunning than most, and a pair of long johns might already no longer be adequate protection.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When he left the staff apartment that morning, Zhuo Yi realized he was being followed.</p>

    <p>He and Deputy Director Zhong Lang were sitting in the same car, and both of them were well aware of the unusual situation behind them. Gripping the steering wheel, the driver deliberately made several detours on Zhuo Yi's instruction, but the gray van behind them still remained steadily close on their tail.</p>

    <p>"Lord Director, Lord Deputy Director... what should we do now?" the driver asked helplessly.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi frowned. "We took so many detours completely different to our usual route. They should have realized by now that we've noticed them, so there's no sense in playing hide and seek like this."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi calmly analyzed the situation. It was clear that the people behind them had come prepared. The other party knew their usual route to work very well, and very likely had a fair amount of information on them.</p>

    <p>Moreover, it just so happened that Zhuo Yi's car was being serviced today, which was why he was following Zhong Lang's car to the General Administration of 100 Schools.</p>

    <p>Just thinking about this was already enough to make Zhuo Yi's back break out in cold sweat.</p>

    <p>Because this meant that the other party had probably already been watching him for a long time...</p>

    <p>As expected, was he the target?</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi sighed.</p>

    <p>"Brother Zhuo, what should we do now?" Zhong Lang asked.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi took out a pair of long johns out from the storage space built into his pocket. "Put this on and get out of the car with me."</p>

    <p>Zhong Lang was startled. "..."</p>

    <p>What was this? It was summer, why wear this...</p>

    <p>"There's no time to explain, this thing can save your life," Zhuo Yi said calmly before he looked at the driver in front. "Mr Driver, after you take us to as empty a place as possible, please go back first. We are their targets; as long as we leave, you'll be safe."</p>

    <p>"Then what about you, Director Zhuo?" The driver was shaken. In fact, he wasn't weak. "If we work together, maybe..."</p>

    <p>"It won't work. If they know our route inside out, they must also know what our strength is like. Coming to pick a quarrel with us so openly shows that they're quite confident in their power."</p>

    <p>Saying this, Zhuo Yi grinned. "Rest assured, I have a way."</p>

    <p>For Zhuo Yi, his first priority now was to protect people and property. As long as the driver drove the car to an open area, they could minimize the damage as much as possible.</p>

    <p>Secondly, Zhong Lang's and this driver's safety were equally important. As a leader, Zhuo Yi felt that he had to take responsibility for them!</p>

    <p>As for his own safety, Zhuo Yi had to consider that, too.</p>

    <p>So after giving Zhong Lang and the driver their instructions, Zhuo Yi immediately took out his cell phone and sent a text message to his shifu Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The content of the message: (:з」∠) Shifu, help!</p>

    <p>It could be only said that Zhuo Yi was worthy of his reputation as the youngest director of the General Administration of 100 Schools in the history of Huaxiu nation... He executed this series of commands and actions without the least bit of sloppiness.</p>
