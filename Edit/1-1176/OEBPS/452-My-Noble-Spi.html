  <h1>Chapter 452 My Noble Spit </h1>

  <div>

    <p>General Yi covered his face with one hand; this was really too shameful!</p>

    <p>He crooked his finger and reclaimed the Heaven-Cleaving sword. That youngster who had been furious and aggressive when holding the sword turned back into a fearful coward as he shrunk back into the corner, his body shaking and completely without any trace of Evil Sword God.</p>

    <p>Warden Liang: "General Yi, is this what Evil Sword God's original character is like?"</p>

    <p>General Yi cupped his chin and shook his head. "No, this old man feels that these are both extreme personalities. If my junior brother was completely normal, he should be somewhere between these two: although he's typically brazen and aggressive, he definitely isn't this timid and won't make trouble out of nothing... So with or without the sword, this old man feels that it's very strange."</p>

    <p>Warden Liang heaved a sigh. "Then it's the same!"</p>

    <p>"What's the same?" General Yi was puzzled.</p>

    <p>Warden Liang: "To tell you the truth, it was Immortal Toya who conducted the personality test on Evil Sword God. Director Zhuo contacted him specifically and had him rush over from Chrysanthemum Island, and his final verdict tallies completely with General Yi's."</p>

    <p>General Yi nodded his head and asked, "Then did he have any way to treat it?"</p>

    <p>Warden Liang: "Immortal Toya said that for a mental disorder, the treatment must fit the malady, and an illness of the mind cannot be cured with medication; at most, it can only help to calm his nerves. There are no drug specialists in this world that can cure a multiple personality disorder. However... it felt to me like Immortal Toya was hiding something; perhaps it was something that wasn't appropriate for me to know."</p>

    <p>"Hm." General Yi nodded his head.</p>

    <p>Warden Liang had occupied the top position at Songhai First Prison for several hundred years, and he was better than anyone else at reading body language; if a person had something to hide, they would be betrayed by their expression.</p>

    <p>General Yi didn't doubt Immortal Toya's medical expertise. It was what the Toya clan had been famous for back then, not losing out to the Xiao clan at all. In addition, from what General Yi knew, Immortal Toya was probably the sole successor of the clan's "Nine Cycles Exquisite Pagoda."</p>

    <p>This was the ancestral magic treasure of the Toya clan and a quasi world-defying magic weapon! This Nine Cycles Exquisite Pagoda not only contained a lifetime's worth of medical research of the entire clan, the pagoda itself was also a very powerful seal-type magic weapon.</p>

    <p>But General Yi had heard that this magic weapon had sustained heavy damage in a great battle a long time ago, to the point that it was still under renovation even now...</p>

    <p>He had only found out about the pagoda being damaged after meeting Immortal Toya for the first time and then getting Old Tang to secretly investigate his background.</p>

    <p>But despite that, General Yi had limited knowledge on how the pagoda had been damaged, and outsiders knew even less.</p>

    <p>Of course, General Yi had his own suspicions.</p>

    <p>He felt that it was probably very likely connected to how, after a short-lived golden era, the Toya clan's situation suddenly changed and they fell into decline...</p>

    <p>Floating in the air, General Yi crossed his arms and said in a deep voice, "There's no need to doubt an evaluation by Immortal Toya. As for whether or not there's a way to cure my junior brother's multiple personality disorder, this old man will personally look for Immortal Toya to ask when I have the opportunity."</p>

    <p>Warden Liang: "May I ask, General Yi, how should I deal with Evil Sword God?"</p>

    <p>General Yi laughed. "Don't misunderstand, I'm not your superior. This old man came this time purely to pay my stupid junior brother a visit. You should know better than this old man about what should be done! Three words: Business is business! Warden Liang should know, I have never bent the law for personal reasons."</p>

    <p>Warden Liang nodded solemnly and replied in a loud voice, "Yes, General! Rest assured, I will handle this justly!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>While General Yi was paying the prisoner a visit, Wang Ling was waiting for the results of Wang Ming's space assessment as well as wondering how to restore Daoist Guang to a corporeal body.</p>

    <p>Currently, spirit lotus root could be used to create a Golden Core body. That bunch of take-out delivery employees who had suffered under the old devil was a good example.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had paid special attention to this matter.</p>

    <p>After Lord Diulei had helped to negotiate with the insurance companies, these unlucky delivery employees had all obtained reconstructed bodies.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, after that incident, they had all become popular online... In the end, this bunch of delivery employees had simply formed a male idol group called "Lotus Root Tyrant"<sup>1</sup> and gone into show business...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The Chinese phrase is a homophone for the Korean word "oppa," which girls use to address guys older than them.)</dfn>

    <p>However, it was obviously far more complicated to rebuild a True Immortal body than a Golden Core body.</p>

    <p>For example, the old devil had attempted to reconstruct his body previously by looking for an Almighty skeleton that was a compatible match.</p>

    <p>But this method carried huge risks and the success rate was only fifty percent. If it failed, that skeleton which had been so hard to find would straightaway disappear...</p>

    <p>Of course, that wasn't the only way to rebuild a True Immortal body; Wang Ling felt that they had to consider this matter at some length.</p>

    <p>He looked at the time; Daoist Guang was still live streaming at that moment.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling opened the live stream room, audience numbers were already over two million people - fully double what it had been before!</p>

    <p>Moreover, Wang Ling discovered that even though Daoist Guang hadn't signed an agreement with the live streaming platform, he had unexpectedly already gotten real name authentication, so his fans could now give him gifts fair and square.</p>

    <p>As soon as Wang Ling entered the live stream room, he could hear Daoist Guang expressing his thanks one after another.</p>

    <p>"Thank you [Light Chaser Fantasy Ghost] for the five flying swords!"</p>

    <p>"Thank you [Love Watching Red Sea In Action] for the ten immortal boats!"</p>

    <p>"Thank you [Paladin's Legendary Love Lolita] for the nine hundred and ninety-nine tyrant immortal knives!"</p>

    <p>"Thank you [School Is About To Start But I Haven't Finished My Homework What Should I Do] for the sixty-six primordial black crystals!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang had already started playing the "Battlegrounds" recommended by Lord Diulei and was waiting for the game to load.</p>

    <p>It was usually at this time that live streamers would chat with their fans.</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang skimmed through the bullet messages randomly and he chose a few questions to read aloud. "May I ask, Lord Island, what is your view on Nanhan blowing a black whistle <sup>2</sup> ?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(To 'blow a black whistle' is to make a bad call.)</dfn>

    <p>Daoist Guang couldn't help sucking air in through his teeth as he felt that this question was a little pointed.</p>

    <p>After reading this question, people immediately set the tone for the bullet messages as countless numbers of them flew across the screen.</p>

    <p>" <em>Bangzi </em>used to be honorable; we are people of quality, let's burn incense for them first!"</p>

    <p>"Need to ask? Just spit on them!"</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang couldn't help laughing out loud when he saw this bullet message. "Everyone calm down... your essence is precious, don't spit so casually!"</p>

    <p>"???"</p>

    <p>A lot of people sent question marks in their bullet messages.</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang chuckled. "Like this Lord Island's spit, for example... I may as well spit on Grandpa Lu <sup>3</sup> instead of that bunch of <em>bangzi </em>!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(A nickname for live streamer and disgraced pro gamer Lu Benwei..)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
