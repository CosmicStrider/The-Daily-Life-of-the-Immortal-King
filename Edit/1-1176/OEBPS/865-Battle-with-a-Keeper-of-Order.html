  <h1>Chapter 865 Battle with a Keeper of Order</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi was utterly thrilled. Wang Ling could see the steam coming off the other party's body. When some cultivators with abundant spirit energy were stirred up, it was very easy for this spirit energy steam phenomenon to occur, the specific signs of which were flushed skin from head to toe, steam exuding from the pores, a surge in adrenaline, and an extremely excited spirit.</p>

    <p>This type of phenomenon wasn't harmful; rather, cultivators could become more focused in battle and experience an increase in explosive strength, speed, strength and resilience.</p>

    <p>At sea, a group of pirates called this phenomenon "Gear Second." Furthermore, their captain developed Gear Third and Gear Fourth by using Gear Second as abase <sup>1</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Luffy's attack techniques in "One Piece.")</dfn>

    <p>But this spirit energy steam phenomenon only appeared in a small group of people. While most cultivators in modern society might only be able to produce it by relying on the effect of drugs, Gu Shunzhi had created it without the assistance of drugs.</p>

    <p>This proved how strong Gu Shunzhi's cultivation base was.</p>

    <p>This man was very powerful.</p>

    <p>He was even stronger than Immortal Zhenyuan and Demon Saint Second Generation Merman... Wang Ling wouldn't know exactly how strong he was until they fought for real, but just from the look of him, Gu Shunzhi was probably several dozen times stronger.</p>

    <p>After all, Gu Shunzhi was the "keeper of order" who maintained order in three universes; it was thus quite reasonable for him to have such strength.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling took a deep breath. He was nothing but curious about what the battle would be like.</p>

    <p>After all, he had never fought a keeper of order before.</p>

    <p>And Gu Shunzhi was probably the strongest of all the keepers of order.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling would be very disappointed if Gu Shunzhi couldn't even defeat his clone.</p>

    <p>The moment Wang Ling fixed his dead fish eyes on Gu Shunzhi seriously, the latter received the signal — he knew the battle had begun!</p>

    <p>A showdown between experts didn't require much communication.</p>

    <p>"I don't know exactly who you are, but don't underestimate me." Gu Shunzhi grinned slightly, then quickly suppressed it — because he was too excited, his bad habit of grinning accidentally leaked out! Smile without showing teeth! He should be serious as a keeper of order, otherwise it wouldn't match his image at all!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling cocked his head, and in that moment, the hair flew up from the top of Gu Shunzhi's head like a dragon in the water and hovered around his body.</p>

    <p>Then, with a soft cry from Gu Shunzhi, these strands of hair actually twined together to form numerous chains.</p>

    <p>This was Gu Shunzhi's life bonded magic treasure, "Three Thousand Chains of Order." These chains were made by directly refining his hair. They could pierce the sky, and were very pliant and resistant.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling saw this scene, his heart was filled with admiration.</p>

    <p>When all was said and done, Gu Shunzhi was the strongest keeper of order, and his methods indeed were quite different. The overall strength of the Three Thousand Chains of Order already surpassed a world-defying magic artifact, and was probably on par with an eight-class divine artifact.</p>

    <p>But this couldn't be all of Gu Shunzhi's strength, and this magic weapon was just a feeler.</p>

    <p>Many cultivators chose to refine parts of their bodies into magic treasures, like that Miss Ah Zuo who had appeared once before and had refined her own fingernails. Another example in the cultivation circle was the famous Daoist Deception, who specialized in refining eye techniques. This person was well-known for refining his own eyes, and his power of sight was exceptionally unusual as it was able to weaken people and turn them into legal lolitas <sup>2</sup> ; by weakening the enemy, he was able to increase his own fighting strength.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A livestreamer with the
username "Goshiki Agiri
Great Deceiver" made some
remarks about
refining/smelting copper,
"lian tong," which has the
same pinyin for "pedophilia"
in Chinese, and which is now also used as a slang term with the same meaning..)</dfn>

    <p>Whether it was fingernails or eyes, these were more common options, and were easier to control.</p>

    <p>It was only hair that was different! It wasn't easy to refine hair given its sheer volume, and each strand had to be refined individually. And even if it was refined successfully, it was extremely difficult to manipulate — to be able to refine three thousand strands of hair into a life bonded magic treasure was ample proof of Gu Shunzhi's extremely precise mastery of spirit energy.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was actually a person who readily acknowledged excellence in others, and he would usually analyze his opponent's strengths in a fight.</p>

    <p>It was only by respecting your opponent that you became more humble. Besides, another advantage of listing their strengths was that when Wang Ling won, it gave him some psychological comfort.</p>

    <p>That list of strengths would tell Wang Ling that it wasn't that his opponent was weak... but that he himself was too strong!</p>

    <p>Even Wang Ling didn't know why he was so strong...</p>

    <p>"Take this..." At that moment, Gu Shunzhi's eyes were fixed firmly on Wang Ling. He stretched out his hand and the Chains of Order made up of three thousand strands of hair cut through the air in the blink of an eye, aiming for Wang Ling's hands and feet.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's brow furrowed when he realized that he actually couldn't grasp the trajectory of the Chains of Order...</p>

    <p>"They're not passing through surface space..." Wang Ling murmured to himself in his heart. This was an unexpected situation: the space which the Chains of Order relied on wasn't surface space, but cosmic space...</p>

    <p>Using his power as a keeper of order, Gu Shunzhi actually linked his life bonded magic treasure to the cosmic spaces of the three universes at the same time.</p>

    <p>Put simply, when the chains pierced the air, they swung through the other universes before circling round back here... only divine artifacts had this sort of power to penetrate space.</p>

    <p>Therefore, when the Chains of Order successfully penetrated cosmic space as it lunged toward him, Wang Ling's serious clone couldn't grasp its movement with his power of sight, and he fell into Gu Shunzhi's trap at once.</p>

    <p>On the outside, the six Great Heavenly Dao were watching the fight, which was on par with a fight between divine immortals; every move and every form seemed to brim with the divine might of Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>Strength Heavenly Dao: "This Gu Shunzhi actually has the upper hand?"</p>

    <p>Time Heavenly Dao: "The battle hasn't truly begun yet... But even if His Excellency Ling's clone isn't that easy to deal with, it's safe to say that given Gu Shunzhi's current fighting strength, His Excellency Ling won't be able to rely on several simple slaps to defeat him."</p>

    <p>The rest of the Heavenly Dao nodded in agreement.</p>

    <p>After all, Gu Shunzhi represented the strongest of all the keepers of order.</p>

    <p>The Chains of Order were now wrapped around Wang Ling's wrists and ankles; each chain contained the suppression of several hundred Heavenly Dao, which firmly prevented Wang Ling from moving.</p>

    <p>"It worked?" Gu Shunzhi didn't look convinced, and he didn't relax at all — he didn't believe that the youngster in front of him only had this much strength.</p>

    <p>But at the same time, Gu Shunzhi was also feeling a little vexed. He had already taken out his life bonded magic treasure, but this still couldn't force the youngster to take out his own life bonded magic treasure to fight him?</p>

    <p>In a showdown between cultivators, if one party pulled out their life bonded magic treasure, the other side should also do the same — even if the latter didn't have any intention of using it in the fight, it was necessary to take it out!</p>

    <p>It was only polite!</p>

    <p>Of course, it wasn't that Wang Ling was being discourteous when he didn't pull out his life bonded magic treasure.</p>

    <p>His life bonded magic treasure was for eating!</p>

    <p>As to what it was, anyone could guess...</p>

    <p>He had already eaten today's portion of his life bonded magic treasure earlier on.</p>
