  <h1>Chapter 446 An Old Immortal Shoulders Responsibility, Magic Without End<sup>0</sup> </h1>

  <div>
  
    <dfn><sup>0</sup>(This is derived from a meme 旭东老仙,法力无边 which loosely translates to Old Immortal Xudong, Magic Without End. Huang Xudong is a Chinese esports commentator; for some reason, anything or anybody he's optimistic ends up failing abysmally, so people joke that he has very strong poison magic.)</dfn>

    <p>When Jingke had possessed his body, it wasn't like Lord Diulei hadn't felt anything. In that instant, it had almost been like using the same body as a big shot - this kind of feeling was too wonderful to be able to describe in detail.</p>

    <p>In any case, he felt that he had gotten stronger!</p>

    <p>Through this event, Lord Diulei had a new and more refined understanding of what "strength" meant... it turned out that you could become stronger without needing to go bald <sup>1</sup> ! As long as you grasped a big gun, you had nothing to fear!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is a reference to the Japanese comic and cartoon series "One Punch Man." After intensive training, the protagonist becomes the strongest person in the world, but at the cost of all his hair ..)</dfn>

    <p>When Jingke had finally deployed the "World-Annihilating Sword" in Lord Diulei's body, the latter had been intimidated by the sword's effect.</p>

    <p>The supreme profound truth of Sword Dao rivalled a blow of heavenly punishment... Who could endure it?</p>

    <p>Although this wasn't a technique he had deployed with his own power, Lord Diulei felt that for his body to be used to discharge this heaven-defying profound truth of Sword Dao in this lifetime, even if it might have cost him his life, was the height of satisfaction. That was because deploying the "World-Annihilating Sword" as a profound truth of Sword Dao had never been something he had ever considered for himself in theory...</p>

    <p>Thus, the taste of the battle just now still lingered with Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>Very few people in their lifetimes would have this type of opportunity to be possessed by a big shot for battle, but as long as they chanced upon it, they were certain to gain immeasurable benefits.</p>

    <p>In terms of Sword Dao, Lord Diulei was only a minor cultivator to begin with, and his specialty was actually secret weapons and physical attacks.</p>

    <p>But this time, Jingke had possessed his body and had performed some crazy, heavy duty operations in it... Even though Jingke had already left his body, the memory still remained.</p>

    <p>If he went and studied this memory carefully later on, it would be of great help in improving his Sword Dao techniques.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, it was very likely that his proficiency and various skills in Sword Dao would surpass his major cultivation of secret weapons and physical attacks within a short period of time.</p>

    <p>In a situation of equal strength, a secret weapon was indeed a good technique because it could both attack and defend and even create an unexpected outcome in battle.</p>

    <p>But in a crushing situation like today's, his Skybomb Grenades simply hadn't been enough.</p>

    <p>This was the limitation of using secret weapons...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei stood at the edge of the deep pit and cupped his chin as he pondered.</p>

    <p>A review in the aftermath of a battle was an absolute must!</p>

    <p>In today's era of peace, how many battles could they fight?</p>

    <p>The scene in front of his eyes dissipated, and the master and servant duo who had been folded over each other in the pit reappeared on the ground in the real world.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei knew that Wang Ling had already canceled the intrinsic spirit field.</p>

    <p>He looked around and realized that that they were in quite a remote location, next to a mountain road on the outskirts.</p>

    <p>They had actually been fighting in a place like this...</p>

    <p>Thankfully, there was no sign of human habitation here. Furthermore, when Evil Sword God had passed through here earlier, all electronic equipment had been destroyed by that demonic sword qi.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had already sent Zhuo Yi a text message, and at that moment, the latter was rushing over as fast as he could. Lord Diulei was waiting by the side of the mountain road to deal with the aftermath.</p>

    <p>Ten-odd seconds later, the Heaven-Cleaving sword's skeleton sword spirit disappeared; after that big battle just now, his spirit power had been exhausted and he could no longer maintain his virtual state.</p>

    <p>As for Evil Sword God, Lord Diulei wasn't worried about him at all.</p>

    <p>All his power of Sword Dao had been taken away by the World-Annihilating Sword, and the sword's seal on Evil Sword God's spirit would remain in effect for a very, very long time.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei turned around to cup his fists as he thanked Wang Ling. "Brother Ling, it was thanks to you..."</p>

    <p>But before he could finish his sentence, Wang Ling's figure turned into a breeze that then dissipated...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "???"</p>

    <p>At this time, a figure approached the scene from not very far away. Lord Diulei gazed in its direction with delight.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Brother Er Ha, why is it you?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha replied, "My little master is doing revision, so he had me come take a look. This place is too remote; I was only able to find it after following your scent for a while."</p>

    <p>"Revision?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was dazed. "Then the one who was here before..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Of course it was my little master's clone!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei couldn't help wiping at his sweat.</p>

    <p>Too brutal... Although Evil Sword God had been defeated by that final move from the World-Annihilating Sword...</p>

    <p>The two slaps which Wang Ling had dealt him had been very real.</p>

    <p>Just a clone...</p>

    <p>Had thrashed Evil Sword God to an inch of his life with mere slaps...</p>

    <p>And activated an intrinsic spirit field in passing...</p>

    <p>As expected, the most abnormal person around him was Brother Ling!</p>

    <p>Too frightening...</p>

    <p>Looking at Evil Sword God lying on the ground, Er Ha also felt a little terrified.</p>

    <p>On the way here earlier, it had used the ability to share sight through the soul pet contract to watch the scene.</p>

    <p>Then, it had seen a massive sword of light thrusting down at Evil Sword God's head.</p>

    <p>The World-Annihilating Sword...</p>

    <p>Er Ha felt that a Sword Dao fanatic like Evil Sword God should probably be content even in death to be stabbed by this kind of technique.</p>

    <p>It sighed and looked around. "Tch, it's a bit dark around here..." Furthermore, the location was a little remote. It was a little worried about Zhuo Yi smoothly finding his way here.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei looked at Er Ha and said, "It's not too bad. When Evil Sword God's demonic nature flared up earlier, all the electronic products nearby were destroyed, but now that Brother Er Ha is here, we can use you as lighting."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "???"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Brother Er Ha, haven't you realized?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Realized what?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Your dog fur is fluorescent!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, about half an hour after the accident, Zhuo Yi arrived at Lord Diulei's location.</p>

    <p>The street lights along the mountain road had already all been destroyed; it was all a vast darkness as far as the eye could see.</p>

    <p>In fact, as early as roughly two hours ago, Songhai city's emergency center had been flooded with consecutive reports from the public.</p>

    <p>They claimed that there was a widespread blackout in their area and that all of their electronic products weren't working.</p>

    <p>At that time, Zhuo Yi had already had a bad feeling.</p>

    <p>After that, more reports were phoned in claiming that someone was throwing out smoke bombs high in the air above Songhai city, covering the sky in roiling dense fog for thousands of miles. Although this dense fog had flowed in from the outskirts, it was still quite troublesome to deal with - since no one knew exactly what the fog was made of, traffic police patrolling the air didn't dare approach it at all.</p>

    <p>At the moment, the area with the dense fog had already been sealed off and no one was allowed to approach it as an emergency evacuation was carried out.</p>

    <p>In the evening, Zhuo Yi's WeChat Moments was very lively. Warden Liang from Songhai First Prison as well as the cultivation police chiefs and deputy chiefs of the different districts sent in complaints one after another...</p>

    <p>As Zhuo Yi consoled them in WeChat Moments, he was also making his own guesses.</p>

    <p>He speculated that this evening's series of events were probably all related.</p>

    <p>After going through several major incidents, it felt like Zhuo Yi could now sense in advance when one was about to happen; he would feel muddleheaded and uneasy the whole day...</p>

    <p>He had been feeling this way since this morning! Furthermore, it had been a very strong feeling!</p>

    <p>So that evening, Zhuo Yi didn't leave work for a very long time as he sat in his office at Songhai's General Administration of 100 Schools and quietly monitored the activity in his WeChat Moments.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, not long after that series of reports had been phoned in...</p>

    <p>He saw a text message from his <em>shifu </em>Wang Ling.</p>
