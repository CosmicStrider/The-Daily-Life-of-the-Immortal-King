  <h1>Chapter 300 Hundred Swords Demonstration! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It had all happened in a flash. These two snake scales moved too fast, at a speed no less than first-class spirit swords. It had taken Master of Immortal Mansion Cheng Yu two rounds to make out the true appearance of these two lights.</p>

    <p>The eastern branch chief died with his eyes wide open; blood streamed from the two fist-sized wounds in his chest, and he fell directly from the cloud in the sky.</p>

    <p>Cheng Yu stared in extreme astonishment at the young man in front of him. Incredibly, the other party had actually had the arrogance to attack first and humiliate him by killing another one of his subordinates right under his nose.</p>

    <p>As to the origin of these two scale plates, Cheng Yu had his own speculation.</p>

    <p>When Immortal She Pi had shaken the world back then, there had been rumors that went so far as to say that the snake scales that had appeared on his body as a result of cultivation were a living magic treasure. That was why this person who had been viewed as monster-level had also had another name, "Living Magic Treasure."</p>

    <p>That was also the main reason why he had been executed in the end; in the eyes of most people, this was a demon that couldn't be allowed to exist.</p>

    <p>However, Cheng Yu had never thought that two of these snake scales would fall into Fang Xing's hands. Nevertheless, in his eyes, they couldn't be considered trump cards; while they were very powerful, on par with a first-class holy weapon, they weren't as formidable as the intrinsic spirit field.</p>

    <p>Of course, Cheng Yu had his own trump card, but unless he was in a desperate situation, he wouldn't use it wantonly. Instead, in this situation, he planned to play around with Fang Xing for a bit, and find out if the other party still had other magic treasures on him.</p>

    <p>"You're very good, I admire that." Cheng Yu gazed at Fang Xing from above. "I would be willing to accept you as a subordinate; you can let me know whenever you're ready to surrender."</p>

    <p>Upon saying that, he abruptly opened his eyes, and the landscape around Fang Xing suddenly changed as the latter unexpectedly found himself on the top of a glacier.</p>

    <p>He was startled when he realized that countless spirit swords were frozen in the ice around and under him.</p>

    <p>"You are not the only one who has an intrinsic spirit field." Hovering in the air, Cheng Yu gave him a sinister look.</p>

    <p>He had already calculated all his subsequent moves. After activating the intrinsic spirit field once, there was a long cooling-off period, so the other party wouldn't be able to discharge it a second time in the short term.</p>

    <p>Thus, he decided to seize this chance and straightaway get rid of Fang Xing in his own intrinsic spirit field.</p>

    <p>He waved his hand in the next instant, and the glaciers around them all began to shake.</p>

    <p>Countless spirit swords broke free of the layers of ice and gathered in the air behind the figure in red, packed tightly together like sardines.</p>

    <p>Every single one of these one hundred spirit swords wasn't a common item. As they hovered in the air, their bodies cast colorful spirit light as they quietly waited for Cheng Yu's next command.</p>

    <p>Although it had long been rumored that the Master of Immortal Mansion was a spirit sword collector maniac, Fang Xing was still amazed when he saw it with his own eyes. Most importantly, sealing all these swords inside the intrinsic spirit field wasn't something Fang Xing thought Cheng Yu could do by his strength alone.</p>

    <p>"You should have realized it by now, my intrinsic spirit field has the same nomological power of regeneration as the building complex in the outside world. I summoned a familiar to make the buildings and also to shape this spirit field. But after I was done with it, I had it kill itself." Cheng Yu laughed darkly and his words even contained a trace of pride.</p>

    <p>When Fang Xing heard this, he understood: After having the familiar work to the bone for him, the other man had had it kill itself so that no one else could use its power â€” this indeed seemed like the Master of Immortal Mansion's style.</p>

    <p>But Fang Xing's expression remained unchanged. Although the intrinsic spirit field had given him a huge shock, the crux of the matter wasn't this spirit field itself, but the fact that it was enhanced by the nomological power of regeneration, making the spirit field impregnable. Faced with this knowledge, anyone would be filled with a sense of despair.</p>

    <p>Without saying anything more, Cheng Yu's gaze fell on Fang Xing in command.</p>

    <p>Dozens of spirit swords instantly flew out from behind him and thrust forward at Fang Xing at full speed, long tails of spirit light trailing from their hilts. The entire scene was more amazing than any plane air show.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing didn't dare be careless, and several more snake scales appeared in his hand to combat these spirit swords.</p>

    <p>In the blink of an eye, the air was full of the metallic sounds of collision.</p>

    <p>But no matter how many snake scales he had, the most was still only ten plates.</p>

    <p>If Cheng Yu attacked him with this Hundred Swords Demonstration, he wouldn't be able to withstand them.</p>

    <p>It just so happened that the sword array in this intrinsic spirit field was just too abnormal, and Fang Xing hadn't anticipated the Master of Immortal Mansion to possess this technique.</p>

    <p>He was very clear that if his spirit energy continued to be used up this way, he would be the first to fall.</p>

    <p>The intrinsic spirit field contained the nomological power of regeneration and wouldn't break easily. Furthermore, while these spirit swords seemed haphazardly distributed, they had in fact been meticulously arranged based on various types of sword arrays.</p>

    <p>The person who set up these arrays just needed to flick a finger or signal with one eye, and these swords would attack in formation.</p>

    <p>And so, from the very beginning, Cheng Yu treated this like he was watching a play. All the spirit swords inside his intrinsic spirit field added up to over a thousand, and none of them were inferior goods. The one hundred he had just summoned was just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

    <p>Floating high in the air, Cheng Yu appeared very composed. The most excessive thing about this act was that the cloud under him was actually a one-of-a-kind invisible spirit sword; even its hilt was invisible. When he was on this invisible spirit sword, he looked like he was hovering in the air.</p>

    <p>Flying without the use of a magic treasure was something battle sect warriors could do back then. In the Spirit Energy Information era, however, only a True Immortal could do it.</p>

    <p>Cheng Yu raised his hand, and several dozen more spirit swords flew out. He looked at Fang Xing with a mocking expression. "How about it, want to surrender?"</p>

    <p>In that moment, more than one hundred spirit swords were pointed at Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>With one more command, these spirit swords would take aim and fly at Fang Xing at the same time, piercing him and turning him into a sieve. There already wasn't any way for him to defend against this assault by just relying on the ten snake scales.</p>

    <p>"Did you think I only had one trump card?"</p>

    <p>Fang Xing suddenly looked up and smiled as he stared at Cheng Yu.</p>

    <p>"I'll give you time to take it out." Cheng Li laughed coldly; in his view, Fang Xing had already exhausted all his tricks.</p>

    <p>In the next moment, Fang Xing bit his lip, and then he swallowed the ten snake scales which encircled him.</p>

    <p>With a hum, the young man's skeleton abruptly shrunk slightly in size. Her hair grew out and a battle scar gradually appeared on her neck. But the most surprising of all was the radiant black armor that materialized on her body, the dark spirit light which encircled her ample frame forming an indestructible barrier.</p>

    <p>At the sight of this, Master of Immortal Mansion Cheng Yu's face finally changed.</p>

    <p>Fuck... this was the White Night Spell and Immortal Mode!</p>
