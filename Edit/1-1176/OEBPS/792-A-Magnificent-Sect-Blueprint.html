  <h1>Chapter 792 A Magnificent Sect Blueprint</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Establishing a sect sounded like a very inspiring thing to do.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin didn't know what it felt like to be a sect leader, but he could roughly guess that it was probably similar to being a clan elder in a holy beast clan, and was similar to the patriarch in a big family.</p>

    <p>As Lord Diulei had said, modern cultivation society no longer needed sects like in ancient times. People looked for sects back then just to learn a technique which they could depend on during the Warring Period. In the various tussles and contests between sects, the majority of them collapsed. As for the disciples who depended on them, some died defending the honor of their sects, while others wandered about outside before finally switching to a different sect.</p>

    <p>In the modern system, while competition between sects still existed, they would never devolve into an all-out fight. With a regulatory government department now in place, light forces nowadays tended to vie with each other through business.</p>

    <p>Unlike before, disciples now threw themselves at sects not just for backing, but more so to make money and a name for themselves.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin had previously learned about the establishment of modern human sects.</p>

    <p>Put simply, modern sects tended to operate like management companies. Those disciples contracted to these sects were actually like trainees in entertainment companies, and there was no denying that this was becoming the trend in the sect circle now, even if the ranks of inner sect, outer sect, and core disciples still remained.</p>

    <p>This was never mentioned on the surface among the sects, but most of them shared a mutual, tacit understanding.</p>

    <p>A famous star disciple could subsequently reap considerable profits for their sect, and would greatly boost the sect's popularity, website traffic, their annual new recruit numbers, and so on - it was far more dependable than a star's good looks.</p>

    <p>In today's cultivation society, while people still looked at appearance, good-looking people were already a dime a dozen. Thanks to magic and modern cultivation technology, a person born with a face like a raw egg could change so that it was flawlessly white instead.</p>

    <p>Competence was now more important.</p>

    <p>"Have you spoken to Master about this?" Xiao Yin asked as he nibbled his finger.</p>

    <p>This was a habit of his whenever he was pondering something, sometimes to the point of drawing blood.</p>

    <p>But given a holy beast's formidable ability to heal, the split skin would recover in practically seconds.</p>

    <p>"I was just about to talk it over with Brother Ling about establishing the sect. I even thought previously about having him become an honorary sect leader or deputy sect leader. However, looking at his personality, he definitely wouldn't want it."</p>

    <p>"Mm... Master has always been low-key." Head down, Xiao Yin thought for a while before he opened his mouth to suggest, "He definitely won't become a sect leader, but he might agree to being a visiting official?"</p>

    <p>"Brother Xiao, that's a good idea! I'll go talk to Brother Ling later; if he declines, it's fine. As for the deputy sect leader position, I actually have another person in mind." Lord Diulei's expression was a little excited as he asked, "What do you think about Brother Zhuo?"</p>

    <p>"Little Master?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was blank. "Given his position in the group, Little Master is indeed qualified to be deputy sect leader. But he's only at the Golden Core stage, so it might not help in trying to enroll new students. Also, Little Master is a government official, so he probably can't take up a position in an external sect, can he?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei waved his hand. "That doesn't matter. I've already sent the proposal for our sect to a friend of mine. If it's set up, our sect will be a light force that will work closely with the government."</p>

    <p>"Work with them?"</p>

    <p>"Yes." Lord Diulei said, "I probably haven't told Brother Xiao the original reason for establishing this sect, have I? I said earlier that modern sects are already different to those in the past. Most sects now are going the way of management companies - they nurture outer sect disciples like trainees, inner sect disciples as newbie performers, and core disciples as idols. But sooner or later, this model will hit a dead end, and it'll definitely have to be readjusted in the future."</p>

    <p>"Then what about us..."</p>

    <p>"Our sect will be a large, relaxed family which will make the disciples feel at home. When our disciples join the sect, there won't be a classification system based on cultivation progress or overall conditions. All sect disciples will be treated equally and enjoy basic benefits. Those who want to advance just need to complete sect missions to earn prestige points, so even Foundation Establishment disciples will have the opportunity to become an inner or outer sect branch head.</p>

    <p>"Also, our sect will have an 'Achieving Dreams' program, completely different from other sects! For disciples who are weaker in their cultivation but have made massive contributions to the sect, we'll nurture them independently and help them realize their dreams - we'll make the impossible possible! It's precisely because of this program that when the time comes, a government supervisory and investigation office will be specially set up. Brother Zhuo can then serve as deputy sect leader as well as leader of this supervisory group. It won't be a problem at all. Furthermore, Brother Zhuo has been active in the public eye in the last few months; if he joins us, this can help expand our sect's popularity in a short timeframe," said Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin nodded his head, thinking that this was indeed true.</p>

    <p>Although Little Master wasn't strong, it was obvious that he was truly touched by the heavens - he had been involved in almost every major event in the past few months.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was the main person responsible for the establishment of Songhai First Prison's Mahjong Squad.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin heard that in response to the infiltration of a foreign force this time, the Mahjong Squad had done a great service in enabling General Bai exhibit his strength.</p>

    <p>These people should have been given the death penalty, but given their contributions, they could probably get commuted sentences... to several thousand years in prison.</p>

    <p>But the problem was whether they would be able to live for that long...</p>

    <p>So during their incarceration, the Mahjong Squad had to work day and night to complete all kinds of assigned tasks in exchange for redemption points.</p>

    <p>"This 'Achieving Dreams' program sounds great..." Xiao Yin was completely fired up by Lord Diulei's passion.</p>

    <p>Although he didn't know how this program would work, it did sound like a project that would benefit the people, and the government would certainly be interested in it.</p>

    <p>"It's going to be amazing." Lord Diulei laughed.</p>

    <p>Actually, this "Achieving Dreams" program had another name: Project Zhuo Yi, also known as Project Scapegoat.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei had specially designed the program to attract Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>After the sect was founded, a "scapegoat" team would be set up.</p>

    <p>And Zhuo Yi would be its leader!</p>

    <p>"So what about the name of the sect?" asked Xiao Yin.</p>

    <p>"Already registered it."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei chuckled as he passed Xiao Yin the information.</p>

    <p>Hm... he had registered the name of the sect five years ago.</p>

    <p>Since then, he had slowly been working out his plan to establish his own sect.</p>

    <p>Then, Xiao Yin glanced at the name of the sect.</p>

    <p>And almost had a fright.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Gen-</p>

    <p>General Office of Strategic Deception?</p>
