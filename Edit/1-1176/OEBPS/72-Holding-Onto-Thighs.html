  <h1>Chapter 72 Holding Onto Thighs </h1>

  <div>

      <p>Zhuo Yi was famous once more... this time for being the first man in the world to hold onto Secretary Dakang's thighs <sup>1</sup> .</p>

      <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is a riff on 'to hug a thigh,' which is to try and coddle favor with someone more wealthy or powerful.)</dfn>

      <p>This historical scene would be forever etched in the memory of every witness present!</p>

      <p>Not everyone was worthy to hold the old Secretary's thighs. Back then, he had carried guns and millet <sup>2</sup> over a thousand crags and ten thousand torrents <sup>3</sup> to ambush demon gods. This still-renowned old senior, who had performed countless outstanding military deeds for the nation, now unexpectedly had his thighs held up by a junior...</p>

      <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Apparently, 'guns and millet' was a way of describing the Communist war efforts in China.)</dfn>

      <dfn><sup>3</sup>('A thousand crags and ten thousand torrents' describes the trials of a long and tough journey.)</dfn>

      <p>For a moment, many people tried to figure out the implication here.</p>

      <p>Zhuo Yi's performance of the Hundred Steps Flying Sword had long ceased to matter. The instant the old Secretary had been pulled away by some force, the two school leaders as well as security personnel on hand had rushed out to protect him.</p>

      <p>Wang Ling would never forget this scene for the rest of his life.</p>

      <p>Amidst a gentle breeze on the sports field, under tens of thousands of gazes, the old Secretary brushed the dust off his body and slowly got to his feet. With his long leg hair fluttering somewhat garrishly in the wind, he turned his head slightly and whispered to Zhuo Yi, "Little Zhuozi, come look for me later after the end of the event!"</p>

      <p>Everyone was stunned! — He actually wasn't pissed off?!</p>

      <p>Everyone knew his identity as the Secretary of the Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools. This was a powerful position and the top seat in the Alliance. Combined with Zhuo Yi's identity as the Deputy Director of the General Administration of 100 Schools, plus his recent achievements and the results of the public poll... plenty of people felt that this seemingly bizarre scene had in fact been set up by the old Secretary as a hint to everyone that he had found a suitable successor!</p>

      <p>If so, the current situation was very clear, and the successor was very likely to be... Zhuo Yi!</p>

      <p>"...Old Secretary, are you hurt?" The two headmasters had already been scared out of their wits as they had never expected such a mishap to happen toward the end of the exchange meet.</p>

      <p>"Hurt? How can I be hurt?"</p>

      <p>The old Secretary gave a slight smile. "I didn't expect Little Zhuozi's sword wave to be that powerful! Even my pants were torn to shreds... but it's fine, I'll just change them! It's common for spirit energy to go out of control when using an unfamiliar spirit sword. Fortunately, Little Zhuozi was clever enough to direct his gravitational wave at me. Otherwise, the students would have been in terrible danger!"</p>

      <p>So it turned out that all this was Zhuo Yi's response to an emergency...</p>

      <p>Realization dawned on everyone!</p>

      <p>"Don't worry, I'm not angry. On the contrary, I think you should thank Little Zhuozi sincerely." The old Secretary said, "As far as I know, once he started work, he seldom had the opportunity to even touch a spirit sword. And so initially I had planned for him to just casually perform the Sky-Parting Sword. In the end... you insisted on him performing the Hundred Steps Flying Sword! See, didn't his spirit energy go out of control?"</p>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p>"It was a good thing I was here. This sword wave didn't have much of an effect on me, but it would have been a disaster if the students had gotten injured. You should learn from this incident, that there are times when you shouldn't force people to do something beyond their ability, understand?"</p>

      <p>"Old Secretary is right! We will definitely take this to heart and reflect on it!"</p>

      <p>"It was thanks to Little Zhuozi's timely reaction that we managed to avoid even worse damage."</p>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p>Zhuo Yi was dumbfounded as the old Secretary spoke.</p>

      <p>Was he... winning without trying again?</p>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p>On the side, Wang Ling covered his face when he heard all of this. Who could have imagined that the old Secretary could actually rationalize such a weird incident.</p>

      <p>Because Jingke's "one hundred percent hairy legs hanging over shoulders" setting was to automatically pull the man with the hairiest legs at the scene toward it!</p>

      <p>Screw what out-of-control spirit energy!</p>

      <p>Screw what timely reaction!</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>At last, following the unexpected mishap at the very end, the curtain finally fell on the four-day student exchange meet. There was a saying: no discord, no concord. Tang Jingze thought that these words really matched the scene. Although a number of unhappy things had happened these last few days, generally speaking, it would be an unforgettable memory.</p>

      <p>This was something Wang Ling had never experienced before, growing up. He wasn't used to living in a group; even in primary school and junior high, he had found all sorts of excuses to not participate in the spring excursions. But due to a freak combination of factors, he had come to Number 59 High School to participate in this four-day exchange meet. Although there had been plenty of issues, at the very least, Wang Ling was gratified that these hadn't been beyond his ability to handle...</p>

      <p>At Number 59 High School's front gate, the people from Number 60 High School were quietly waiting for the return bus.</p>

      <p>It was already Friday and after school hours. Given security considerations, the school had mapped out proper routes and arranged for a bus to take all the students home safely.</p>

      <p>Wang Ling had always felt this means of transportation to be a pain in the ass, because whether he ran or crawled... he would still be much faster.</p>

      <p>Tang Jingze and his posse had pondered for a long time before feeling that they should send them off. Although they had lost the competition, as elegant representatives of a candidate key city high school, they should make an appearance.</p>

      <p>At the school gate, as the representative of Number 59 High School, Tang Jingze stretched out his hand to Sun Rong. But he only got halfway when Guo Hao intercepted him. "Unfamiliar men and women shouldn't have intimate contact. You need a ticket to shake hands with Student Sun Rong, thirty thousand a ticket, a fair deal!"</p>

      <p>Tang Jingze drew his hand back. "...So expensive?"</p>

      <p>"If you're just saying goodbye, it's no different than if you shake hands with me. I'm the political science representative! I came here to represent the aspirations of the people of both schools!" Guo Hao said.</p>

      <p>On the side, the corners of several mouths twitched violently — lately this fatty was becoming better and better at bullshitting. Wang Ling had always thought that Guo Hao's strongest trait was his rotten mouth, which was even stronger than his "fondness of gossip."</p>

      <p>Tang Jingze initially had just intended to say goodbye, but was suddenly pissed off by Guo Hao's attitude. And so, gripping Guo Hao's hand, he drew in a deep breath and said, "Our school's spirit gathering arrays have already been fixed, you're welcome to come again!"</p>

      <p>Guo Hao: "We won!"</p>

      <p>Tang Jingze: "Our spirit gathering arrays have been further enhanced this time, five times more powerful than before!"</p>

      <p>Guo Hao: "We won!"</p>

      <p>Tang Jingze: "Our school is planning to expand the school dormitory! To install elevators!"</p>

      <p>Guo Hao: "We won!"</p>

      <p>Tang Jingze: "Can you stop just using the results of today's competition... it's not good for the relationship between our two schools!"</p>

      <p>Guo Hao: "Your Director Xie has fallen in love with our history teacher!"</p>

      <p>Tang Jingze:"..."</p>

      <p>Guo Hao: "Your delinquent senior has turned over a new leaf, no doubt because of our Number 60 High School's upright commitment to learning!"</p>

      <p>Tang Jingze:"...Why don't we change the topic?"</p>

      <p>Guo Hao: "Teacher Zhuo Yi from the General Administration of 100 Schools who was on stage today graduated from our Number 60 High School."</p>

      <p>Tang Jingze: "..." Motherfucker!</p>
