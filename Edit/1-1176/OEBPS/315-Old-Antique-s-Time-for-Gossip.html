  <h1>Chapter 315 Lao Gudong's Time for Gossip </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ming left at nine o'clock in the evening. He had wanted to stay the night and engage in heartfelt conversation with Wang Ling, but when he thought of Zhai Yin still standing erect at the front door, he gave up on the idea.</p>

    <p>As a formidable and well-trained military cultivator, Zhai Yin wouldn't feel tired standing at attention for even several days, but Wang Ming would feel a little uncomfortable if he was the reason Zhai Yin spent the night at the front door.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming didn't really like Zhai Yin. He was absolutely rigid in his ways, which was quite different from the Academy of Science's policy of flexible and adaptive strategies. But however much Wang Ming disliked him, the other party was just following orders to protect him.</p>

    <p>When he left the house, he saw Zhai Yin staring at him coldly. It was only when Zhai Yin saw him come out that the man stood at rest. He then made a perfect one hundred and eighty degree turn and walked slowly toward the car to open the door for Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>He stared at Wang Ming, his eyes like that of a poisonous snake in the jungle staring at its prey.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Ming abruptly thought that Wang Ling's dead fish eyes weren't bad. He might have facial paralysis, but at least he wasn't freaking cold!</p>

    <p>"I'll truthfully report what happened tonight to President Qi. I'm also going to verify the information on all the people in this villa one by one, especially that person who pulled you inside," Zhai Yin said, looking at Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>He thought about his earlier embarrassment. When Wang Ling had dragged Wang Ming in, it had been so fast that Zhai Yin hadn't even been able to see Wang Ling's face clearly, and Wang Ming had just disappeared directly in front of him...</p>

    <p>Wang Ming looked at him angrily, refusing to get into the car. "That's my little brother! And my uncle and my aunt! And my grandfather! What are you thinking?"</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin's face was cold. "Even if it's your second eldest uncle <sup>1</sup> , it's useless. Work is work."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(In Beijing, this is used as a vulgarity, like 'fuck your mom.')</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ming's lips twitched gloomily. "..."</p>

    <p>Go and check then! He knew Wang Ling had the Great Shielding Spell, so even if he were to be investigated, everything would just be a huge mosaic.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming really didn't know where on earth President Qi had found this weirdo...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was June 28th on Wednesday in the tenth week of the semester.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling arrived at school in the morning, he heard the news about two of his "acquaintances," one of whom was Tan Qian. He was the younger brother of the owner of that beef noodles restaurant, Boss Tan. He had come to the villa to stir up trouble, but Jingke had ruthlessly dealt with him in an instant. Under Lord Diulei and Boss Tan's assiduous instructions, he had then become a real " erwuzai <sup>2</sup> . "</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Cantonese slang for 'traitor..')</dfn>

    <p>It had to be said that Boss Tan was really far-sighted. From the moment he had seen Tan Qian, he had tried all means and ways to help Tan Qian to be rid of Immortal Mansion as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>This time, Tan Qian would appear in court as an informant on Immortal Mansion. Previously, he had sent a complete map of Immortal Mansion's branch intelligence networks to the local cultivation police stations. It was because of this that the local police stations had been able to launch a campaign to exterminate Immortal Mansion's branch forces.</p>

    <p>This above gossip was from Guo Hao, Guo Hao in Grade One, Class Three.</p>

    <p>During the morning self-study period, the classroom was very noisy as almost all of the discussion was about Immortal Mansion.</p>

    <p>"I heard before that the brother of this informant runs a noodles restaurant?" Chen Chao asked.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao nodded solemnly. "Yes, it's authentic lao tan pickled cabbage beef noodles. I have an uncle who went there to eat their noodles. The boss has a scarred face and an enigmatic look..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Then, in addition to the news on Tan Qian, the second person Wang Ling heard about was Tang Youning. Back then, this vagabond singer who had found it hard to even afford three meals a day had quickly become famous after Wang Ling had given him a song.</p>

    <p>Actually, Tang Youning also had a connection to the beef noodles restaurant's Boss Tan. Back when Tang Youning hadn't been famous yet, he had pretty much been a regular at Midnight Dining Hall.</p>

    <p>"This Tang Youning is really unlucky..."</p>

    <p>Speaking about this person, Guo Hao supported his forehead with one hand and smiled wryly.</p>

    <p>"What happened?"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "After his song Old Boys hit it big, he released several original songs after that, but it seemed they were all eclipsed by other headlines."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"When he released his second song, the younger sister of the Master of Shadow Stream breaking out of prison stole the headlines.</p>

    <p>"When he released his third song, her recapture stole the headlines once again...</p>

    <p>"After that, this was followed by the elimination of Shadow Stream's headquarters, the arrest of the old devil, and the live online broadcast of the old devil's interrogation." After that, Guo Hao couldn't help sighing. "Yesterday was his birthday... thousands of fans were going to celebrate together, and everyone thought that this would make the headlines for sure, but who knew that the thing with Immortal Mansion would happen."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>The class was deep in heated discussion when Lao Gudong stepped into the classroom, a full twenty minutes ahead of the regular class time, and even using part of the morning self-study period.</p>

    <p>The monthly exam was approaching, and this month's exam was very important. It was a joint schools exam, where many schools would be using the same exam paper, so that students could accurately determine their ranking in the entire district. It was no use being king of your own home â€” it was only when you became king of the whole district or even the whole city that you could consider yourself dominant.</p>

    <p>"The teacher setting the paper for the joint schools exam this time is the district history scholar, Teacher Ji Chongkui." Lao Gudong looked up with a face full of rare seriousness.</p>

    <p>When they heard this name, many people in the class couldn't help but gasp.</p>

    <p>This name was way too familiar to them, because this was the most brutal and inhuman scholar in Peiyuan district... Every year, the freshmen who entered high school would hear their seniors in Grades Two and Three complain strongly about this person.</p>

    <p>As for rumors about this teacher, Wang Ling had heard Clan Leader Yu mention them before when Wang Ling had just entered the school. Last year, there had been three thousand freshmen who had taken the joint six schools exam, and in the end, ninety percent of them had failed... Even the best score among the elite students had only been seventy points.</p>

    <p>Therefore, although it hadn't yet been officially determined how many schools would participate in the joint schools exam this time, it was going to be a challenge for both students and teachers given that such a vicious teacher would be setting the paper.</p>

    <p>Hence, for the first time ever, Lao Gudong took advantage of the morning self-study period to enter the classroom ahead of time to announce the tragic news.</p>

    <p>His expression was a little solemn, but it wasn't without his usual confidence; Teacher Ji might be ruthless, but Lao Gudong was very confident in his own teaching.</p>

    <p>Last year, the teacher leading the elite class hadn't been Lao Gudong, hence their very tragic results.</p>

    <p>But this year, they would turn it around.</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong cleared his throat and looked at the students. "Last night, I studied the exam papers which Teacher Ji set. Not only do they contain hard historical concepts, there is also a lot of external knowledge as well as historical knowledge derived from recent hot topics, so a lot of people might find this difficult... In view of the recent hot topic of Immortal Mansion, I'm going to share with you gossip on the dark forces..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>As expected, after talking so much, in the end, he still wanted to gossip...</p>
