  <h1>Chapter 1021 A Case Caused By Copying Homework (2)</h1>

  <div>

    <p>No one could have expected that the all-important Jade Scroll of School History would actually be reduced to jade paper pulp at such a critical time and turned into summer vacation homework. Now that the homework had already been given to every Songhai city high school student, looking for all the pieces of the Jade Scroll of School History would be just like fishing for a needle in the sea.</p>

    <p>In light of this problem, Headmaster Chen had released a radar app in the teachers' group chat which could lock onto the scroll's approximate location. But the scroll had been cut up into so many parts, so the response range was decreased accordingly: only when the scroll was within a range of fifty meters would the app respond.</p>

    <p>And the lead teacher in charge of directing the teachers in the search for the Jade Scroll of School History naturally was Lao Gudong.</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong had a good relationship with the kids and there wasn't any generation gap - he would even bring up the latest memes in class. It could be said that he was the teacher closest to the youngsters.</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen and Director Shi both felt that only Lao Gudong could take up this significant responsibility.</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong clearly lived up to their expectations, and formulated a detailed search plan that very night: "Next, I've divided the teachers into several groups; the listing has been sent to the group chat. Take note, teachers: this has to do with our future benefits. I hope everyone will be meticulous during this summer breakt!"</p>

    <p>Everyone looked at the list, which basically consisted of two-person teams. The division of labor was made very clear.</p>

    <p>Fast food restaurant team, coffee shop team, library team, magic treasures and electronic shops team, spirit sword shops team... and most unbelievable of all, there was even an airport team. That was to say, even if there were students who had arranged to go overseas to copy homework, teachers could stop them on the spot...</p>

    <p>"We don't have enough manpower." Some of the teachers checked the division of labor on the list. Even with all the teachers of Number 60 High sent out, they could only cover one district at most.</p>

    <p>But there were twenty-two districts in Songhai city, and chain stores like fast food restaurants and coffee shops numbered in the thousands. Furthermore, their response range was only fifty meters. How long would their search take?</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, teachers. Please trust my directions, and just do your work to the best of your abilities." Lao Gudong smiled confidently.</p>

    <p>He was naturally well aware that he would have to look for external help in this situation, otherwise it would be very difficult for Number 60 High's teachers to complete this task on their own.</p>

    <p>As for whom to go to for help... first of all, Zhuo Yi absolutely couldn't hear about this - Headmaster Chen had made this very clear when he had appointed Lao Gudong as chief commander.</p>

    <p>Given that Zhuo Yi was a Number 60 High graduate, he might be biased when it came to rating the key city high schools, so he had to steer clear of activities related to Number 60 High for the next few months. Now, more than ever, Headmaster Chen couldn't let him know about the missing Jade Scroll of School History. For one thing, he didn't want Zhuo Yi to be troubled over this. For another, if the matter of their missing Jade Scroll of School History was exposed and the Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools got wind of it, they wouldn't even qualify to be a key city high school candidate!</p>

    <p>Thus, not only did they have to look for the Jade Scroll of School History, they had to do it secretly.</p>

    <p>"Time to showcase my abilities."</p>

    <p>On a rooftop on Number 60 High's school grounds, Lao Gudong's thoughts turned in his mind as he gazed at the setting sun.</p>

    <p>A few minutes later, two figures flashed in front of Lao Gudong.</p>

    <p>They were none other than the two disciples he was proud of, Killer Daoist and Bandit Evil.</p>

    <p>" <em>Shifu! </em>" They dropped to one knee and cupped their fists in a salute.</p>

    <p>"I've told you the specifics of the situation. How many people were you able to gather this time?"</p>

    <p>"After Shadow Stream was taken down and their master caught, a lot of their assassins fled. Junior brother and I never stopped pursuing them until we caught and retrained them. Now is the time to put them to the test. Including the killer-level fellow brothers that have gathered, we have over two thousand people," answered Killer Daoist.</p>

    <p>"Mm, well done. That's enough."</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong nodded. "The point of the operation this time is secrecy. Once you find the summer vacation homework, you just need to steal it; it would be best if the kids don't find out. If you encounter a situation too hard to handle, you can sit tight and let me know, and I'll immediately send over any nearby teachers."</p>

    <p>"Understood." The two nodded, then turned into shadows that dispersed.</p>

    <p>This was Number 60 High's biggest opportunity to be promoted to a key city cultivation high school in a century, and no mishaps could be allowed to happen. Actually, what Lao Gudong cared about wasn't the teacher benefits, but the fact that after Number 60 High became a key city high school... he would be able to set up an official snack counter on school grounds!!! He could sell his snacks openly and aboveboard, and no longer have to sneakily sell them to the kids out of his drawer!</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen had already promised that as long as Lao Gudong could collect all of the Jade Scroll of School History during the summer break, he would be given the right to run the snack counter! â€” <em>Latiao!</em></p>

    <p>At that time, he would bring in a huge amount of <em>latiao </em>!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, after the Palace of Mirrors was destroyed, the black shadow army's plot seemed to have failed, but as Wang Ling had said, this was only the beginning.</p>

    <p>It was what True Immortal She Pi had last said about the secret of "Shadow" that was the key to the entire incident.</p>

    <p>There was a mysterious underground complex in the northern outskirts of Huaxiu nation.</p>

    <p>This was an old tomb that had yet to be discovered: it was hidden very deeply and covered with all kinds of restrictions. After President Bai and the others came back to life, this old underground tomb, that didn't see the light of day, became their base of operations.</p>

    <p>President Bai's eyes were fixed on a black shadow that flickered inside a mirror - this was the Almighty who had resurrected him and Devil Gut Fungus Lord back then, and who was now their boss.</p>

    <p>"What do you want?" The person in the mirror spoke, his voice sounding like it belonged to a youngster.</p>

    <p>"Your Excellency, after constant surveillance, my son has detected a fluctuation of Shadow. Although it's very weak, we can confirm that this is the fluctuation of Shadow that Your Excellency has been looking for."</p>

    <p>"Shadow hasn't truly been born yet - continue monitoring the fluctuation for now. There's no need to look for me until the fluctuation reaches its peak. Also, during this period, don't interfere with the family in that villa. Before the time is right, I need them alive."</p>

    <p>"Yes." President Bai nodded his head. "Also, I have one other thing to report."</p>

    <p>"Speak."</p>

    <p>"A new situation has arisen: earlier, all the killers on the international ranking list suddenly received the highest kill order and have gathered together. I suspect that this might have something to do with the fluctuation of Shadow; perhaps, they are also looking for the source of the fluctuation..."</p>

    <p>"You can handle this sort of petty thing yourself. Just remember to do as I say."</p>

    <p>"Yes..."</p>
