  <h1>Chapter 80 The Terrified Monkey Coder Little Black </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling was in fact well aware that someone was secretly investigating him. Otherwise, there was no way Zhuo Yi would have been able to track him down with his limited skill set after the incident six years ago. But if Wang Ling wanted to catch this person, he had to silently wait for him to give himself away.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had already prepared himself after the last time, when Zhuo Yi had waited for him at Number 60 High School's front gate. He had had a hunch that the person who was hiding behind Zhuo Yi would show himself again...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling rarely turned to Wang Ming for help, but this time he had sent him a text message summarizing the situation.</p>

    <p>Less than five minutes later, Wang Ming had sent him a string of numbers. They were the coordinates for an account login that he had traced through the "Super High School Level Deputy Director" reader ID on the Cultivation Reading Network.</p>

    <p>The mysterious monkey coder <sup>1</sup> behind Zhuo Yi was a first-class computer expert who habitually changed his login coordinates to hide his position whenever he used an online account. Unfortunately for him, his opponent this time was the most powerful brain in Huaxiu nation.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A 'monkey coder' refers to an expert computer programmer.)</dfn>

    <p>Following Wang Ming's coordinates, Wang Ling had then directly used the Great Teleportation Spell and had been instantly transported to a mysterious underground laboratory on Huaxiu nation's border.</p>

    <p>And after that, was this scene now...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had suddenly appeared in the spacious laboratory with both his hands raised and the spirit bomb a huge ball of light in the air above them, ready to explode.</p>

    <p>The man in black skintight clothes had been completely frightened out of his wits. As per Wang Ling's first instruction when he had appeared, the man lectured Zhuo Yi, trembling. He didn't even dare turn his head. Who knew if Zhuo Yi that guy had actually taken his words to heart...</p>

    <p>Fucking big fuck!</p>

    <p>The man had always thought he was investigating an ordinary student — how the hell could he have known that this boy was a cannon who even had a nuclear bomb on him? If that bomb exploded here... it wouldn't be just the lab, even the border would be fucking flattened!</p>

    <p>The man held his hands up. "Great Immortal... I've said whatever you wanted me to say."</p>

    <p>This time, Father Wang had given Wang Ling a do-or-die order: clean up his own mess, or he would never be able to eat his favorite crispy noodle snacks at home ever again...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling silently nodded and withdrew the spirit bomb...</p>

    <p>The talking-to which he had gotten from Father Wang had put him in a bad mood.</p>

    <p>Sensing the sharp decrease in the light and wind pressure behind him, the man finally heaved a long sigh of relief. At least the research which he had painstakingly worked on for decades had been preserved... but without Wang Ling's say-so, the man didn't dare turn his head to look at all.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling gave the man a second instruction to completely erase all investigation records about him.</p>

    <p>The man didn't even dare take a deep breath as he straightaway started working at his computer. Two minutes later, on the kind of wide monitor screen that could be found at a satellite launch site, the massive words "Deletion Success" appeared.</p>

    <p>The man raised his hands again. "Great Immortal, relax... I've deleted all your records, and there are no backups."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was silent for a moment. In the end, however, he still didn't fully trust the man. He stepped forward and a powerful spirit wave rolled out from him as its center. Instantly there were " peng peng peng peng " sounds of things exploding...</p>

    <p>He felt a lot more relieved; at least now he could be sure that he had destroyed all the data chips in this place.</p>

    <p>The man was so frightened that he crouched down on the ground, shivering and covering his head.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling took a look around and realized that monkey coder Little Black unexpectedly had a lot of strange inventions. Among them, the most eye-catching one had to be the big cannon with a muzzle that was a meter wide in diameter. It stood erect in the middle of the laboratory like a chimney with two impressive cannonballs hanging one on each side of it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling pointed to the cannon and spoke in Little Black's mind. "What is this?"</p>

    <p>Little Black covered his head, completely afraid to look directly at Wang Ling. He said timidly, "This is... the Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon <sup>2</sup> ."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(The Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon is a legendary and powerful weapon in the Japanese comic Gintama which, if you haven't guessed already, looks like a penis ..)</dfn>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>What kind of fucking name was this?!</p>

    <p>The more Wang Ling looked, the more suspicious the cannon appeared.</p>

    <p>He raised one hand...</p>

    <p>With a burst of dazzling light, there was a tremendous " boom " sound...</p>

    <p>This huge cannon exploded into bits of flying ash.</p>

    <p>Billows of smoke directly activated the laboratory's fire protection system. The sprinklers spurted on, creating a thick mist of spray...</p>

    <p>When Little Black looked up, he found that Wang Ling had already disappeared.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the destroyed lab, Little Black slumped weakly on the floor. He was completely drenched, his black skintight clothes resembling a swimsuit wrapped around his body. Shivering, he took out a cigarette and silently lit it.</p>

    <p>All destroyed...</p>

    <p>Little Black cradled his head in pain. The inventions he had toiled over, the results from decades of research, the Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon... all instantly destroyed in one fell swoop!</p>

    <p>The most crucial thing was that against Wang Ling, Little Black had felt that he couldn't even hold his ground, let alone defeat him.</p>

    <p>While his realm wasn't the best in the world, Little Black felt that at the very least he still had enough power to shake it. However, Wang Ling's strength had been suffocating... that earth-shattering oppression had grabbed him by the throat, and he had felt close to dying.</p>

    <p>It had already been a very long time since Little Black had felt the kind of true oppression that emerged from the gap between cultivation realms.</p>

    <p>"This person... is so terrifyingly strong!" Little Black puffed on his cigarette, trembling. Who on earth had he been investigating all these years?</p>

    <p>He calmed down after smoking one cigarette. He wanted to call someone to report the situation, but found that even his wristwatch had been destroyed by the spirit vibrations. None of the electronic devices in the lab could be used!</p>

    <p>That person wasn't just a portable human nuclear warhead... he was also a fucking portable EMP!</p>

    <p>Now that he couldn't make any calls and all the equipment was broken, Little Black could only write his report by hand, then find an opportunity later to report the lab damage.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>May 16th, sunny.</p>

    <p>The laboratory has suffered unprecedented damage. According to current estimates, three satellite computers, an Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon, and communications equipment have been destroyed. All data has been destroyed, and initial estimates put the rate of data recovery at close to zero. At the same time, research subjects in other parts of the world who have on them the black technology developed by the laboratory may go out of control. I hope this matter will be given due attention by the organization. In addition, regarding the identity of the person who destroyed the laboratory...</p>

    <p>Having written to this point, Little Black paused. "..."</p>

    <p>Fucking wait! —</p>

    <p>This youngster with terrifying strength... what was his fucking name?</p>
