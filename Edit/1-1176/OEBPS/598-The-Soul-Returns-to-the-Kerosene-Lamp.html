  <h1>Chapter 598 The Soul Returns to the Kerosene Lamp</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The split second his body sunk into the earth, Scorpion King already saw his soul return to the kerosene lamp<sup>1</sup>.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The equivalent of seeing your life flash before your eyes.)</dfn>

    <p>So, was he about to die?</p>

    <p>When he came back to his senses, Scorpion King was profoundly aware of how terrible the "enemy" in front of him was. He couldn't stand up to the other party's power at all; the difference in strength was like between the heavens and an ant. Or maybe, they weren't ants and were just lumps of shit.</p>

    <p>It wasn't just Scorpion King who had this feeling; all the demons buried in the dirt saw their lives flash before their eyes.</p>

    <p>Were they going to die like this?</p>

    <p>Most living creatures, not just human beings, often only knew how to cherish something after losing it; this applied to a lot of things, including one's life. War brought glory to the ruling demon gods of the demon territories and gave them a thrill, but in the end, the pain was still deeply engraved in the bones of the demons.</p>

    <p>Thus, the moment they were buried and thought they were going to die, the first thing the demon kings and the demons in the rear thought of was peace. The demon world had been far from peaceful for nearly a hundred years, and there was conflict everywhere. Tribes could fight over the smallest cultivation resource, going so far as to wage huge battles over it. Prior to that, all the resources in the demon world had been shared equally.</p>

    <p>At that moment, the demon kings as well as the demons under their command reflected: What was it that had caused them to become increasingly selfish?</p>

    <p>If they had a chance to do everything all over again, they would want peace and they would never abet evildoers.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the demon gods of the four inner territories were thinking the same thing.</p>

    <p>If the demon gods of the four great inner territories had banded together earlier on and worked as one to pray and call upon Demon Saint to come, they wouldn't have fallen to this extent.</p>

    <p>Peace was the only thing they needed.</p>

    <p>This torturous reflection from the depths of the soul seemed to last a long time, but in fact it was only a few short seconds.</p>

    <p>This was also one of Zhenyuan's abilities. The spell he had used to bury the demon gods, the demon kings and the demon beasts in the ground was called "Burial Technique." It was originally a secret art of some ancient cultivation sect that reeked with blood and violence. It could be used anywhere that had soil and sand as it used the power of the earth to bind people; just a little more strength would be all it took to bury them alive.</p>

    <p>But Zhenyuan had upgraded this "Burial Technique" so that it wasn't as cruel as the original version. It was used purely as a containment spell. Combined with this interrogation of the spirit spell, "Soul Returning to the Kerosene Lamp," the two spells worked together like golden partners!</p>

    <p>"This 'Soul Returning to the Kerosene Lamp' is a grade ten spell I created myself which can cause people to calmly ponder in their hearts: Where did I come from? Where do I go when I die? Why am I here on earth? Is there an end to the universe? How long is time? Is the Chinese dragon bald or not? How should the word 'honghu' be read<sup>2</sup>? These are all questions to ponder!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This refers to the phrase 'honghuzhi' 鸿鹄志, meaning to have lofty ambitions, which the president of Peking University misread as 'honghaozhi' in his address at the university's 120th anniversary celebration ..)</dfn>

    <p>Er Ha suddenly thought that Zhenyuan was really quite the genius.</p>

    <p>Among all the people it had met, at least, there was no one apart from Little Master Ling who understood cultivation better than Zhenyuan. Er Ha suddenly felt that besides luck, talent was also a major factor in Zhenyuan's advancement to Venerated Immortal level.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Gazing at the demon gods and demon beasts below who one by one came back to their senses from the interrogation of the spirit spell "Soul Returning to the Kerosene Lamp," Er Ha spoke slowly. "Do you have any last words?"</p>

    <p>"You have any last words..."</p>

    <p>"Have any last words..."</p>

    <p>"Any last words..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..." Fuck! Where did this echo come from?! Wasn't this Evil Sword God's trait?!</p>

    <p>Er Ha felt like it had really become the villain this time!</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan: "Oh, that's right, Senior Dog, I forgot to tell you that the heroic spirit throne has a built-in echo effect."</p>

    <p>Er Ha was stunned. Even a built-in echo effect was possible.</p>

    <p>"Everything that has happened up to now, we brought on ourselves. I don't want to repeat myself too much. If Senior Dog will agree to give us a chance, no matter what the final outcome is, we will have no complaints even if we are completely destroyed."</p>

    <p>Venerated Ox of the West opened his mouth, and when he finished speaking, the faces of the other demon gods were dark.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "What else can you fight me with?"</p>

    <p>"Demon Saint!"</p>

    <p>Venerated Ox of the West said resolutely, "As long as senior is willing to let us go, we can summon Demon Saint."</p>

    <p>Er Ha rubbed its head with one dog paw. "Mm, I almost forgot there was this junior."</p>

    <p>On top of the holy pillar.</p>

    <p>Demon Saint: "???"</p>

    <p>"Want to use Demon Saint against me?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha continued to play along with the script, a contemptuous look in its eyes as it snorted coldly. "Is there a need for me to deal with Demon Saint personally? Zhenyuan, let them go..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan's expression was complex. "Senior Dog, are you sure? I trapped them with great difficulty!"</p>

    <p>All the demons: "???"</p>

    <p>"This is to drive them to complete despair!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha played the profound thinker. "Actually, after being in the demon world for so long, I'm a little weary. If this demon world's Demon Saint amuses me, I can certainly spare these rude juniors. Actually, I've never been a warmonger, and I much prefer to spend my days peacefully. If the envoys at the peace consulate hadn't provoked me, I wouldn't have made a move today."</p>

    <p>After saying this, the dog fur on Er Ha's back stood up slightly; even it was disgusted by its own words!</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan sighed. "Senior Dog, you're so benevolent!"</p>

    <p>Daoist Witch Demon: "???"</p>

    <p>Buried in the ground, Daoist Witch Demon couldn't help twitching his lips.</p>

    <p>Why did he recall that it was the green-furred dog that had attacked first... It broke the window with a flying kick and directly smacked Fellow Horse Face silly!</p>

    <p>This script wasn't right!</p>

    <p>Following that, Zhenyuan snapped his fingers and let all the demons loose.</p>

    <p>He looked down at the four demon gods. "I've never fought Demon Saint, but this time Senior Dog is here. As a junior, I should put on a good show. When you convey your will to Demon Saint, be so kind as to let him know not to go easy on me, otherwise it would be impossible for him to defeat me."</p>

    <p>All the demons sweated. Before this absolute power, they were unable to retort at all.</p>

    <p>At this time, Ghost Emperor couldn't help asking, "This red-haired senior, would it be possible for this junior to ask a question?"</p>

    <p>He had mustered up extreme courage to ask this question.</p>

    <p>"Go ahead," Immortal Zhenyuan said.</p>

    <p>"Dare I ask what your Daoist name is?"</p>

    <p>"My Daoist name? In front of Senior Dog, no Daoist name is worth mentioning."</p>

    <p>The red-haired young man narrowed his eyes and smiled. "My Daoist name is Zhenyuan."</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan...</p>

    <p>Hearing this, the mouths of all the demons dropped open; even Second Generation Demon Saint on the top of the holy pillar had a stunned expression on his face.</p>

    <p>It was actually him?</p>

    <p>Wasn't this the Venerated Immortal that only existed in legend in today's world of human cultivators?</p>
