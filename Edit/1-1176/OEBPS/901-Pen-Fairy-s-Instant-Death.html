  <h1>Chapter 901 Pen Fairy's Instant Death</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Let us rewind time back to ten minutes ago, when Boss Jin's meeting just ended and there were ten minutes to go to midnight.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had a general idea of the locations of these three devils, and got Book of Sage Immortal to search for them as quickly as possible. After enlightening Book of Sage Immortal, Wang Ling found that it was indeed really helpful in looking up all sorts of things.</p>

    <p>But this thing still had to be punished - Wang Ling still remembered that it had sold his limited edition crispy noodle snacks to help buy Immortal Toya a ticket.</p>

    <p>Thus, after finding Jingke's scabbard, Wang Ling was still going to give this tablet away...</p>

    <p>Keeping it around would be a disaster sooner or later!</p>

    <p>A few seconds later, Book of Sage Immortal sent over Pen Fairy's location. Like Boss Jin said, Pen Fairy was in the Funan area, and furthermore was committing a crime at that very moment.</p>

    <p>In the meeting room, Wang Ling used the "Great Soul Shift Spell" of the Three Thousand Great Dao to swiftly arrive at Pen Fairy's location.</p>

    <p>It was a boy's room, and Wang Ling used the Great Soul Shift Spell to appear behind the boy. This little brother with a crew cut didn't sense him at all since Wang Ling was currently in a spiritual body. Even Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi as inhabitants of the Domain of the Gods wouldn't be able to see Wang Ling, to say nothing of a high school student.</p>

    <p>The Great Soul Shift Spell could be considered an advanced out-of-body spell that could instantly transport a soul anywhere in the world.</p>

    <p>But the spiritual body couldn't last long; after fifteen minutes, the soul would automatically return to the body.</p>

    <p>But this was more than enough time for Wang Ling to get rid of Pen Fairy.</p>

    <p>It wasn't a difficult enemy to deal with; it was just difficult to find.</p>

    <p>In front of his table, this little brother with a crew cut had no idea at all that he had been targeted by a female ghost. Pen in hand, he was staring at a book and seemed to be racking his brains over a problem.</p>

    <p>"Nannan? Nannan?" From outside came the voice of the little brother's mother. She knocked on the door first before opening it, then placed a plate of fruit next to him.</p>

    <p>Seeing her son doing his revision seriously, the mother smiled benevolently. "Study well, Nannan! If you want to eat anything, just let me know!"</p>

    <p>"Mm, I got it," the little brother replied coldly. Although his eyes were on the book, he was looking at his mother out of the corner of his eye.</p>

    <p>After his mother left, this little brother with the crew cut breathed a sigh of relief. He turned a page in the book he was holding, and only then did Wang Ling realize... there was actually a "hole" inside this little brother's thick revision materials! That was right! A rectangular hole!</p>

    <p>The little brother had placed his phone inside this hole!</p>

    <p>Whenever anyone came by, he would cover it with the page in the front, then flip it back when no one was around...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sweated. This little brother had gone to a lot of trouble to play with his phone.</p>

    <p>He glanced at the name written on the little brother's review materials: Lin Nan.</p>

    <p>Currently a third-year student.</p>

    <p>Different to regular high schools, Foundation Establishment high schools had their college entrance exams in October after the summer break.</p>

    <p>Thus, for the majority of third-year Foundation Establishment high school kids, the summer break wasn't a great one; in addition to actual combat, there was still a lot of theory they had to review, and their parents would usually be keeping a closer eye on them.</p>

    <p>It was very clear that this little brother was afraid of his mother's nagging, which was why he had come up with this little trick of hiding his phone inside his revision materials.</p>

    <p>He was so not serious about studying!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at Lin Nan and sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>There was a time to play and a time to study; striking a balance between work and rest would make one a more effective learner. But be that as it may, Wang Ling in the end wasn't Lin Nan, and thus couldn't comment. After all, each person's situation was different; you weren't that person, so you had no right to rashly judge them.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was very curious to know why Lin Nan had gone to all that trouble to hide his phone. Taking a look, he saw that Lin Nan was talking to his father on the phone.</p>

    <p>A text message caught Wang Ling's eye: "Dad, don't gamble anymore. Come home. Mom needs you. I was first in my whole year in the final exams, and the school specially gave me a Super Panacea. If we sell it, we can definitely pay off your gambling debts. As long as you promise me never to gamble again, and come home and apologize to mom, I'll sell that Super Panacea..."</p>

    <p>He was waiting for news from his father.</p>

    <p>But his father didn't reply even after a long time.</p>

    <p>Seeing this message, Wang Ling had mixed feelings.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Lin Nan, who was waiting for his father's reply, suddenly felt cold and couldn't help shivering.</p>

    <p>Lin Nan picked up the air-con remote on the table. The room temperature was currently at twenty-five degrees. It shouldn't be that cold! So what was up with this chill he was feeling?</p>

    <p>Lin Nan didn't know that at that moment, Pen Fairy had already targeted him.</p>

    <p>A dark spiritual body slowly stretched out from the ballpoint pen he was holding...</p>

    <p>It was a female ghost with long hair who was dressed in red and wore high heels. Her spiritual body flowed out of the pen and slowly coalesced behind Lin Nan. Lin Nan could clearly feel a cold breeze on his neck, but had no idea why.</p>

    <p>When the female ghost stretched out her long red nails toward Lin Nan's neck, Wang Ling slowly raised his hand and pressed down on the ghost's shoulder.</p>

    <p>"You're Pen Fairy, right?" Wang Ling cocked his head and said telepathically.</p>

    <p>The female ghost in red was so scared that all her hair stood on end!</p>

    <p>She hadn't noticed anyone standing behind her at all...</p>

    <p><em>The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind.</em></p>

    <p>"You..." The female ghost turned her head in disbelief, but she was so weak that she couldn't even see Wang Ling's spiritual body. However, the ghost was very sure that there was someone behind her!</p>

    <p>And his hand was already at her neck before she could do the same herself...</p>

    <p>"Let go," Wang Ling said telepathically in a cold voice.</p>

    <p>There was no room for negotiation in his tone, and it was an unadulterated command.</p>

    <p>Helpless, the female ghost was forced to withdraw her nails, and she raised both hands in surrender.</p>

    <p>"What kind of ghost are you..."</p>

    <p>"I'm Crispy Noodles Ghost."</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Ghost? Pen Fairy was blank. She had never heard of this guy.</p>

    <p>"Why are you after him?" Wang Ling continued to ask telepathically.</p>

    <p>He felt like he had never spoken so much before in his life.</p>

    <p>But he was really very curious.</p>

    <p>His gossipy heart had been completely awoken by Guo Hao that guy.</p>

    <p>"I want to kill him because he isn't studying hard, of course!" the female ghost said righteously.</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling was shocked by this reason.</p>

    <p>"Also, before I kill him, I'll help him finish all his homework! I want to make every person who doesn't study hard feel ashamed! Send them to hell with remorse, and I'll -"</p>

    <p>"Bang!"</p>

    <p>Before Pen Fairy could finish speaking, Wang Ling gripped her neck and straightaway crushed her.</p>

    <p>What a boring fight...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>He gave Lin Nan a look.</p>

    <p>Before he left, he did one other thing.</p>

    <p>He erased all the homework Pen Fairy had done for Lin Nan...</p>

    <p>One's homework!</p>

    <p>Had to be done by oneself!</p>
