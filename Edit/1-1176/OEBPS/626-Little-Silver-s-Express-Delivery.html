  <h1>Chapter 626 Xiao Yin's Express Delivery</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Both master and servant stared at the instructions, and then were silent for a long time.</p>

    <p>It had to be said that as a limited use magic weapon, the Three Views-Shattering Hammer indeed had a lot of functions.</p>

    <p>Moreover, Wang Ling couldn't help thinking of a Heavenly Dao called "fairness." The "Great Fairness Spell" which he had mastered was a spell for closing the gap in strength between the spellcaster and the enemy. It had the same effect as this hammer's "all living things are equal" enhancement skill. However, Wang Ling would basically never have the opportunity to use this spell.</p>

    <p>Because for Wang Ling, this was actually a pretty worthless Heavenly Dao spell.</p>

    <p>After all, given his current situation, the overwhelming majority of enemies he faced were weaker than he was. If he used this "all living things are equal" spell, he would be the one to become weak instead, thus making his enemies stronger.</p>

    <p>This spell was meant to be used when facing a strong enemy, so Wang Ling had no opportunity to use it at all.</p>

    <p>He abruptly thought that this hammer was in fact pretty useful.</p>

    <p>Even if it was a limited use magic weapon, it was still a very powerful defensive magic treasure.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, after being filled with primordial qi and used in combination with this type of masterful magic spell, its original power would be greatly enhanced.</p>

    <p>Er Ha put away the hammer with the Space Swallowing Spell and decided to find time to contact Xiao Yin later that night. After all, this was a personal instruction from Little Master Ling; it had to obey.</p>

    <p>The only troublesome thing was that it would have to explain about Immortal Zhenyuan and Drought Star to Xiao Yin, who didn't know the situation.</p>

    <p>In order to find that angler's whereabouts as soon as possible, the fastest way was undoubtedly for Xiao Yin to use his holy beast blood to perform a reverse trace. But they couldn't know for sure if this would be that easy to carry out.</p>

    <p>That evening, Xiao Yin was waiting for an express delivery at the villa. His previous plan to buy a collar had been delayed because of the incident with the Didi Shun Feng spirit car, so in the end, Xiao Yin had opted to buy the collar online.</p>

    <p>At around eight o'clock, the villa's doorbell rang.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin opened the door and saw a courier little brother covered in grime, who offered the parcel with both hands as he stood respectfully in front of Xiao Yin. "Hello, Mr Xiao Yin, Shun Feng God Express at your service!"</p>

    <p>What the heck...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was stunned by this courier little brother's miserable appearance. Looking to the side, he saw a luoyang shovel<sup>1</sup> at the courier little brother's feet, and then, a hole the size of a man behind the courier.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A traditional Chinese tool for specialized use in archaeological digs ..)</dfn>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>Did all Shun Feng God Express couriers not take the usual route?</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin remembered seeing a lot of news online about couriers, and almost all of them revolved around the Shun Feng God Express couriers. These couriers always popped up inexplicably in all sorts of places, and then became heroes in passing... A while ago, an online security company had been infected with a computer virus, and the entire company had been helpless in the face of this crisis. A courier from Shun Feng God Express had been waiting at the entrance for a very long time, and in the end he personally stepped forward to fix the hole in the network, preventing the security details of hundreds of millions of users from being leaked.</p>

    <p>A delivery courier was a really mystical job!</p>

    <p>Or rather, it was only the couriers from Shun Feng God Express who were more mystical...</p>

    <p>"Why didn't you use the main entrance?" Xiao Yin was very curious as he received the delivery.</p>

    <p>He saw the employee ID on the courier little brother's chest; his name was Liang Liang.</p>

    <p>The courier little brother smiled miserably and scratched his head. "One of the owners in this villa estate wanted to celebrate his girlfriend's birthday before, and asked us to come out of the ground with a birthday cake in hand to give her a surprise... In the end, because I wasn't skillful enough, the villa security team dug me out and took me to their office."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>Liang Liang scratched his head. "The security in this estate then blacklisted me."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "It's been really hard on you..."</p>

    <p>"It's fine, it's fine, the customer comes first. Before the new courier for this estate gets here, it's my duty to send every delivery to the door." The words of this courier little brother called Liang Liang were very moving. "Mr Xiao Yin, please rest assured. When I leave, I'll help you fill in the hole behind me so that it looks like I was never here at all."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>Just then, the courier little brother suddenly said, "Oh, that's right, Mr Xiao Yin, I wonder if you can give me a five-star rating? We have some small gifts for you."</p>

    <p>The courier little brother then took out a grading device from his pocket. On it, there were five buttons which corresponded to the five grading options.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin felt he was a very easygoing person himself. Even though he had been blacklisted by estate security, this courier little brother still did his utmost to do the delivery, so Xiao Yin naturally wouldn't give him a hard time.</p>

    <p>Thus, Xiao Yin pressed the five-star button practically without needing to think about it.</p>

    <p>"So, what are your small gifts?" Xiao Yin asked after the grading.</p>

    <p>"The small gifts are automatically determined by the system based on customer purchases. Of course, the customer's details are kept confidential during the process; we couriers actually have no idea at all what the customer bought and we're only responsible for the delivery." Liang Liang smiled.</p>

    <p>"Your service is very considerate!" Xiao Yin marveled and then grandly signed his name on the box.</p>

    <p>Because he had learned human culture not long ago, Xiao Yin's characters didn't actually look very nice, but the two characters "Xiao Yin" were already the best-looking characters he could write.</p>

    <p>After confirming that the parcel had been accepted, Liang Liang took out the gift for the full marks rating. It was a once-off storage spirit bag. Once all its contents were taken out, the bag would turn into flying dust and disappear in an environmentally friendly way with low carbon emissions and zero pollution.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin went inside happily with the collar in his hands.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was pushing his broccoli salad around on his plate as he ate it. When he saw Xiao Yin walk in with the spirit bag and all smiles, he gave a doting smile. He really felt that Xiao Yin was an easily satisfied person.</p>

    <p>"What did they give you?" Lord Diulei couldn't help asking.</p>

    <p>"I don't know, I haven't looked at it yet. He said the gift is determined by the computer system based on the delivery," Xiao Yin replied.</p>

    <p>He put the delivery box on the table, and then injected spirit energy into the small brocade bag in his hand. In several rays of light, a plastic bag flew out of the bag. With its seal broken, the brocade bag instantly turned into flying dust.</p>

    <p>Then, a thin leather whip, a box with six candles inside and a bottle of lubricant appeared in front of Xiao Yin. The scariest of all was Xiao Yin unexpectedly finding a pink string inside the plastic bag, which turned out to be lingerie...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin picked it up and turned to look at Lord Diulei. "What is this?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>
