  <h1>Chapter 905 A Scene of Domestic Violence</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"It's Lord Jingke!" Zhuo Yi got excited.</p>

    <p>All eyes turned to the thin figure in the sky.</p>

    <p>As always, the legendary lord of sword spirits demonstrated his powerful fighting strength - with just one arm, he parried an attack that even Fang Xing, as a warrior goddess, thought was hard to hold off.</p>

    <p>On the ground, Boss Jin and his shop assistant Ling Huan were completely stupefied...</p>

    <p>At that moment, they finally understood why this group of people were able to destroy Pen Fairy the instant the exorcism convention began...</p>

    <p>Their strength wasn't in the same dimension at all.</p>

    <p>"Boss..."</p>

    <p>"Quiet, I need to calm down..."</p>

    <p>At that moment, Boss Jin and his shop assistant took deep breaths.</p>

    <p>When Jingke appeared in the sky, Bai Qiao stared blankly at his arrogant and imperious face. She frowned and secretly exerted all her strength, but realized that her ahoge divine sword wouldn't budge even an inch.</p>

    <p>The boy was astonishingly strong!</p>

    <p>But from his aura, he didn't seem that strong...</p>

    <p>"Step aside, I don't hit children." Bai Qiao glared at Jingke, but there was a very strange feeling in her heart. She was the embodiment of heaven and earth, born of the sun and the moon. Thus, she had the power to comprehend all living things, which was why she could taunt everyone and say such poisonous words when she first arrived at the shop.</p>

    <p>But there were two people she wasn't able to completely see through in all this time.</p>

    <p>One was the teenager called Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>While it sounded like she had taunted him with a lot of poisonous words, they were in fact superficial as she didn't completely understand the teenager.</p>

    <p>And now there was another troublesome character, which was this kid who had suddenly appeared before her eyes.</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao could vaguely sense how she and this child were connected.</p>

    <p>But she was unwilling to admit it.</p>

    <p>She was already used to being free and doing her own thing.</p>

    <p>The world was so colorful and there were still so many games for her to play.</p>

    <p>She didn't have time to play house with a little kid.</p>

    <p>"Come back, with me." Jingke's eyes were fixed on Bai Qiao. That languid tone was the same as ever. He clearly had the body of a kid, but there was an unmistakable sense of authority in his voice.</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao sneered. "Don't tell me what to do! I still have a lot of games to play today! There are still so many novels to read! My favorite author Kuxuan's new book <em>The Only Koi in the Cultivation World </em>is released today! I have to hurry up and subscribe to him! See him crossdress!"</p>

    <p>Everyone was dumbstruck at this sort of lavish reason.</p>

    <p>But in front of this haughty and tough female otaku, Jingke's expression didn't change from beginning to end. His dark gaze never wavered, which gave goosebumps Bai Qiao all over.</p>

    <p>It was said that sword spirits resembled their masters; Bai Qiao could see that this kid looked exactly like his master who was watching the drama from down below.</p>

    <p>That master wasn't easy to deal with, so naturally this sword spirit wouldn't be easy to deal with.</p>

    <p>"Looks like I'll have to get serious, then." Bai Qiao sighed inwardly and her expression turned serious.</p>

    <p>"Treasure House of Hair!"</p>

    <p>The next moment, everyone saw this ahoge divine sword in the sky actually split into countless fine needles. Under Bai Qiao's control, thousands of fine needles rained down on Jingke.</p>

    <p>Jingke had never let down his guard. He waved his sleeves, and two intersecting rays of sword light appeared in his small hands. All the fine hairs which fell like the Tang sect's Tempest Pear Blossom Needles <sup>1</sup> were broken by the brown protective sword light.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(From the book "The Legend of Chu Liuxiang.")</dfn>

    <p>Zhuo Yi couldn't help saying, "From Miss Bai Qiao's reaction after Lord Jingke appeared, it doesn't look like she's ignorant about who he is. Yet every one of her moves when she attacks is deadly, targeting his vital parts..."</p>

    <p>On the ground, Zhuo Yi, Er Ha and Fang Xing sweated as they watched.</p>

    <p>This scene of "domestic violence" was truly terrifying.</p>

    <p>This storm of hair needles hit the earth like thousands of meteors, making a mess of the ground and leaving devastation in its wake. Countless buildings for dozens of li around were instantly destroyed and turned into rubble, which was a frightening scene.</p>

    <p>But this still wasn't all of Miss Bai Qiao's power.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing was keenly aware that the other party's overall fighting strength was above True Immortal level.</p>

    <p>But so was Lord Jingke's.</p>

    <p>This was a battle between sword spirit and scabbard spirit - it would be very hard to predict the outcome until the very last moment.</p>

    <p>However, while the situation looked uncertain, it was clear who was on the attack and who was on the defense.</p>

    <p>Miss Bai Qiao's attacks were becoming more and more violent.</p>

    <p>Their auras exploded, and each wave of spirit power which rippled out in all directions destroyed everything in its path, turning vegetation and houses all to dust. It was like the advent of doomsday. Their spirit power was so strong that it directly transformed into a tangible attack which destroyed everything.</p>

    <p>Jingke was on the defense from beginning to end.</p>

    <p>"What? You won't fight me?"</p>

    <p>Miss Bai Qiao laughed wildly. She was suddenly enjoying the feeling of battle. She had been cooped up at home for too long - it wasn't a bad thing to get out once in a while and exercise her muscles and bones. She actually hadn't planned to be so hard on a kid, but for some reason, the more aggressively she fought, the more excited she felt.</p>

    <p>At some point, she could no longer take her eyes off Jingke, and fierce obsession occupied her mind as the battle went on.</p>

    <p>Actually, Wang Ling understood this type of plot very well. It was like your female deskmate at school who wanted to pinch your thigh all the time. You thought the girl was bullying you, and you even told the teacher. Actually, it was because the girl had a crush on you but didn't know how to express it in words. It was just like the boy in the back row who always pulled on the pigtails of the girl in front of him... So, after getting their thighs pinched, the majority of these inflexible men lost the chance at beautiful relationships...</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao's feelings now were the same.</p>

    <p>The more she attacked, the more she wanted to bully him!</p>

    <p>"Ahoge, go!" Bai Qiao was full of fighting spirit. Her ahoge stretched forward to wrap Jingke up three times over.</p>

    <p>Then, the ahoge on her head took off like a rocket, sending Jingke who had been wrapped up like a ball into outer space to make several loops around the Earth.</p>

    <p>Finally, the ball dropped hard like a meteor...</p>

    <p>"Not good!" Fang Xing sensed that things were bad; if this "meteor" fell, it would definitely be a huge calamity!</p>

    <p>But right at that moment, Jingke's aura finally came out as a strong gravitational force was released from the "rice dumpling" ahoge-wrapped ball.</p>

    <p>No one reacted at all.</p>

    <p>On the other side, however, Bai Qiao was already flying forward with a miserable shriek.</p>

    <p>By the time everyone came back to their senses, Bai Qiao's two white thighs were settled firmly on Jingke's shoulders...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "This is...! 'Jingke Assassinates Emperor Qin'?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha didn't understand. "But Miss Bai Qiao... doesn't have the most hair <sup>2</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(From way back in chapter
71, when the second way
Jingke goes ballistic
involves hairy legs hanging
over the shoulders. Also as a
reminder, Jingke is a
historical Chinese figure
well-known for his failed attempt to assassinate King
Zheng, who later became
China's first emperor,
Emperor Qin ..)</dfn>

    <p>"No..."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing shook her head and theorized emphatically, "The reason why Miss Bai Qiao's ahoge can stretch infinitely is probably because she has absorbed the nutrients from the rest of the hair on her body... Thus, Lord Jingke reckoned that the ahoge is also connected to her leg hair. Also, after this ahoge grows out, it's much longer than what all of us have!! If we put all our leg hair together, it still wouldn't be as long as a single ahoge of Miss Bai Qiao's, would it?"</p>

    <p>Everyone was stunned.</p>

    <p>There... there was still this type of operation...</p>
