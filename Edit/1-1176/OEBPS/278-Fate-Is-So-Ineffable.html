  <h1>Chapter 278 Fate... Is So Ineffable </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It wasn't very long after Toya Immortal had called him when Wang Ling heard an ongoing rumbling sound from the air outside the waiting room... it was actually a helicopter! Furthermore, Wang Ling couldn't be more familiar with the symbol on it. It was a Seven Stars Special Forces helicopter; back then, Lord Diulei had duped him into working for them as a consultant.</p>

    <p>"After the survival contest, General Yi took me on as a consultant for the Seven Stars Special Forces. Who knew it would actually be of use today."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya looked at the sky and raised his eyebrow as he pondered over sending the fighting lion back with the helicopter. "However, I'm only borrowing this helicopter, and I still have to pay the fuel costs. Based on the latest trend of using spirit stones as fuel for its operation, it costs one million HNY per minute."</p>

    <p>After hearing that, Wang Ling's lips twitched violently: "..." As expected, as long as you had money, you could do whatever you wanted!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya used a purification talisman to clean the blood stains off his body. "Senior Ling, Lord Diulei will probably be arriving soon. Ask them to wait for me!" Then, he strode toward the separate dressing room which could be found in the VIP waiting hall.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling glanced at the clock on the wall of the waiting hall; it had already been ten minutes since Lord Diulei had called. As far as he knew, Lord Diulei wasn't in the habit of being late.</p>

    <p>Had something happened on his way here?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's imagination started to run wild... and he couldn't be blamed for his fanciful thoughts, since his eyelid had started twitching again.</p>

    <p>For some reason, he had a sense of foreboding!</p>

    <p>After another two minutes or so, a group of people in traditional dress showed up at the entrance of the VIP waiting hall. Led by a young man in white, they slowly approached Wang Ling, who felt that the song Superstars in Troubled Times <sup>1</sup> was the perfect background track for this scene.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This song is from the
soundtrack of the 1997 Hong
Kong gangster film 'Young
and Dangerous .. ')</dfn>

    <p>Sitting inside the waiting hall, Wang Ling watched Dharmaraja and Luo Chuang come in with Lord Diulei. Also following them was a young lady who was no less attractive than the Master of Shadow Stream. She wore a pink gown and a trademark lotus hairpin in her hair. Wang Ling knew that this had to be Cailian Zhenren.</p>

    <p>Compared with when the Gate Between Worlds had descended six years ago, he felt that she hadn't changed very much. The only difference was that her aura was now steadier. Every single person in the chat group was doing their best to cultivate in their own way, and was making progress every day.</p>

    <p>While he had recognized Cailian Zhenren, she couldn't recognize him. Technically speaking, this wouldn't be their first meeting â€” she had seen him six years ago when he had been ten, and had even given him cleansing lotion then.</p>

    <p>Even now, Wang Ling still remembered this vividly.</p>

    <p>After entering the waiting hall, Cailian Zhenren straightaway started making a ruckus as she asked around, looking quite excited.</p>

    <p>"Senior Ling? Who is Senior Ling? Who is Senior Ling?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Not only hadn't her looks changed, her personality was also still as unrestrained as six years ago...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed in his heart and stood up silently from his seat, and Cailian Zhenren immediately stopped screeching.</p>

    <p>Like most people who saw Wang Ling for the first time, Cailian Zhenren's first impression was that he was so young and full of vigor; it was the kind of boundless vitality which only belonged to youth... how had he managed that?</p>

    <p>"This is Brother Ling!" Lord Diulei made the introductions as he came up and threw one arm around Wang Ling's shoulder.</p>

    <p>"I never thought I'd be able to meet Senior Ling here today. Nice to meet you!" Cailian Zhenren gripped his hand excitedly and looked as if she was going to cry. "I'm just a little excited... sorry, Senior Ling!"</p>

    <p>The moment they shook hands, Wang Ling could clearly sense her internal condition. He had once heard Lord Diulei mention that this was from an injury which Cailian Zhenren had sustained three hundred years ago. Although it could be healed, the rate of recovery was very slow. At her peak, Cailian Zhenren had attained the status of a Perfected Being, but after being injured, her realm had regressed several levels. It was only in the last few centuries that her condition had stabilized and she had started to steadily recover.</p>

    <p>In spite of that, she was currently on pretty much the same level as Dharmaraja sans the godly thunder inheritance.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>So it's just us?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's eyebrows twitched as he telepathically asked Lord Diulei his question.</p>

    <p>"Including Brother Toya in the dressing room, there's seven of us participating in this operation," Lord Diulei said with a smile.</p>

    <p>Seven people?</p>

    <p>Including Wang Ling, that was still just six people.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling hadn't thought that there would be a seventh brother.</p>

    <p>He started to have a bad feeling...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "I forgot to tell you, I recently checked this brother out and decided to have him join our chat group. I've been friends with him for quite a number of years. He went to the toilet just now after entering the waiting hall, he should be back soon... Brother Ling, you'll definitely be surprised when you see him!"</p>

    <p>Just after Lord Diulei finished speaking...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling instantly saw the very last person he wanted to see right now.</p>

    <p>From a distance, he could already see long legs in a pair of blue and white striped track pants...</p>

    <p>A sunny and fair youngster walked toward him with a smile.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing...</p>

    <p>Why would he show up here?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling tried his best to cover up his surprise.</p>

    <p>"Hello, Classmate Wang Ling." Once he had drawn near, Fang Xing was the first to open his mouth and smile at Wang Ling as he tilted his head slightly.</p>

    <p>To Wang Ling, it was a smile with hidden meaning.</p>

    <p>"Let me introduce him to everyone. This is Brother Fang Xing, a fellow whom I met on assignment back then." After saying this, Lord Diulei suddenly laughed. "Actually, Brother Fang Xing and Cailian Zhenren have already seen each other before."</p>

    <p>"Ah?" Cailian Zhenren was doubtful.</p>

    <p>"Do you still remember the demon king which dropped from the Gate Between Worlds six year ago?" Lord Diulei asked.</p>

    <p>From her expression, Cailian Zhenren was recalling the event, and following that, she immediately nodded. "Oh! I remember, back then, the demon king landed directly on top of that century-old flagship store which sold crispy noodle snacks, frightening a ten-year-old shota!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Number 3600, Spirit Stream Road. That was the address of that century-old flagship store which sold crispy noodle snacks." When Lord Diulei said this, he paused. "The noodles shop which belonged to Brother Fang Xing's family was next door. When that demon king landed that year, you could say that Brother Fangxing was the first witness at the scene."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
