  <h1>Chapter 494 Mr Lu, Tenacious at Staying Alive </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Because Mr Lu had planned to tender his resignation back then, President Bai had decided to present him a gift before that and make use of their relationship to persuade him to stay.</p>

    <p>The Tree clan were relatively simple creatures to begin with, and as reality proved, President Bai's plan to get Mr Lu to stay was a success.</p>

    <p>However, this was the start of President Bai's deception...</p>

    <p>This "Gentle Walker sword" was indeed what Mr Lu had taken a fancy to back then, and he had sent all the detailed information on this spirit sword to President Bai.</p>

    <p>But the most suspicious thing about this entire matter was that it was impossible for the human President Bai to be unable to tell the difference between "yao" and "tian." Furthermore, Xiao Yin felt that the grand expenditure of ten million immortal gold to directly purchase the sword was probably something that President Bai had already arranged in advance.</p>

    <p>No one would be so stupid as to spend ten million immortal gold bars on just a ninth-class holy weapon. It was also very likely that the international store had been opened by President Bai himself.</p>

    <p>So this was a transaction in which he had taken money out of his left pocket and put it in his right one to begin with.</p>

    <p>Opening the store hadn't cost President Bai much, not when it meant he could keep such a powerful assistant from the Tree clan by his side - it was a transaction with guaranteed returns.</p>

    <p>There was only one truth...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin stood up, a red bow in his hand <sup>1</sup> . "If my deduction is correct, this is the truth of the matter!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A nod to the series "Detective Conan.")</dfn>

    <p>At present, Xiao Yin didn't have any substantial proof.</p>

    <p>But when Mr Lu followed Xiao Yin's analysis carefully, a lot of things did indeed seem suspicious.</p>

    <p>For example, he had realized previously that this fake Skywalker sword didn't have a sword spirit.</p>

    <p>How could a sword ranked seventh on the list of spirit swords not have a sword spirit?</p>

    <p>But Mr Bai had explained to him that it was precisely because the Skywalker sword was ranked seventh that the process for summoning its sword spirit was more complicated than for an ordinary sword... Mr Lu hadn't had this sword long, so he needed to use it for a period of time until their rapport reached a certain degree before the spirit sword could be summoned.</p>

    <p>This was what Mr Bai had said, and simple Mr Lu had believed it without a second thought.</p>

    <p>But now that he had calmed down and thought about it, Mr Lu indeed thought that this was all just bullshit!</p>

    <p>"My god! I was tricked... what a cunning human!"</p>

    <p>Finally realizing that he had been duped, the tears that filled Mr Lu's eyes flowed uncontrollably down his cheeks.</p>

    <p>As a grand "forest fairy" of the Tree clan who was on the verge of succeeding as a demon god, he had never ever thought that he would actually be tricked to this degree... If word of this incident got out, how would he have the face to face his clan ancestors and the people back home?</p>

    <p>"How long have you been in the human world?" Xiao Yin couldn't help asking.</p>

    <p>"It's already been... two hundred years..." said Mr Lu, wiping at his tears.</p>

    <p>"In the past two hundred years, didn't you properly study Huaxiu's language?"</p>

    <p>"No... what I took were all crash courses..."</p>

    <p>No wonder!</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin couldn't help sighing on the spot when he heard this. "Human culture is broad and profound. Huaxiu's culture alone requires a long period of study. Crash courses are useless; you still have to study the foundation of the culture. Actually, I also haven't been here long."</p>

    <p>Mr Lu was startled. "Exalted immortal, you're also not human?"</p>

    <p>"...When the time is right, you'll know who I am."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin's lips twitched; these words sounded a little strange, though there didn't seem to be anything wrong with them. He pointed back at the villa. "My master is still inside."</p>

    <p>Master...</p>

    <p>Mr Lu's eyes widened; he remembered that this word meant "owner."</p>

    <p>He had already seen and acknowledged Xiao Yin's strength, and one of the two people inside whom he had yet to meet was actually this silver-haired young man's owner? How strong was his master...</p>

    <p>Mr Lu had now already completely lost the desire to fight.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin snapped his fingers and undid the intrinsic spirit field.</p>

    <p>Mr Lu knelt down, head to the ground. "Exalted immortal! My wretched self was deeply tricked and came here on orders. I am willing to become a witness to expose President Bai's repulsive conduct!"</p>

    <p>"...I can't make this decision. It's still better for you to talk to my master!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin pursed his lips. "I'll spare your life for now! You've been in the human world for two hundred years, but haven't carefully studied Huaxiu's culture; it's clear that you suffer from a lack of culture! Nowadays, if you don't study properly, you can't even use the name of the noodles when you eat them..."</p>

    <p>"What... what noodles?"</p>

    <p>"Shit noodles <sup>2</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Biangbiang noodles is a noodle dish popular in China's Shaanxi province. The character for 'biang' is notoriously difficult to write; the substitute character used here in 便便面 'bianbian noodles' can mean to piss or shit.)</dfn>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, the water friends match organized by Daoist Guang had officially started, and everyone was about to parachute down at that moment. Lord Diulei took off his headphones because he had felt both Xiao Yin's and the intruder's auras disappear. He immediately guessed that Xiao Yin had discharged his intrinsic spirit field and moved the battle site.</p>

    <p>The intruder had been harboring a lot of murderous intent. Although it had just been a flash, Lord Diulei knew that this person's origin wasn't simple; his strength wasn't ordinary, and it was likely to be almost at Itinerant Immortal level. The man gave Lord Diulei the same sense of oppression that Cheng Yu, the Master of Immortal Mansion, had back then.</p>

    <p>He felt that this person might not be easy to deal with...</p>

    <p>However, at that moment, the auras of both individuals suddenly reappeared!</p>

    <p>It was just that the intruder's aura had become extremely weak...</p>

    <p>Then, Xiao Yin jumped down directly from the first floor through the hole he had punched open, holding up a badly battered Mr Lu like a chicken. He threw Mr Lu behind Lord Diulei and Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He clapped his hands. "I settled it!"</p>

    <p>"The hell? So fast?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was indescribably stunned.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin gave a thumbs-up and couldn't help giving his praise. "Master's crispy noodle snack is too awesome!"</p>

    <p>At that moment, Lord Diulei noticed that the badly battered Mr Lu was actually sobbing quietly like a lovelorn girl.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "What's wrong with him?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin sighed. "Yet another typical case of a broken heart from being swindled through online shopping."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Mr Lu knelt on the ground and kowtowed to Wang Ling, who was playing the game, and Lord Diulei. "Exalted gods! I was blind as a bat! I am willing to expose President Bai!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was looking at the game map with a calm face. He was completely focused on the game and paid no attention to anything else as he wondered where would be the best place for him to land...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei also put his headphones on again. He knew that when Wang Ling was concentrating, he wouldn't pay attention to anything else. The most important thing to him right now was the game. So it was no use talking about Mr Lu's matter now; everything had to wait until the game was over.</p>

    <p>When Mr Lu saw Wang Ling and Lord Diulei ignore him, he suddenly felt nervous. "Exalted gods! Every word I say is true! Please forgive me, great immortals!</p>

    <p>"Exalted gods, I was wrong! I was really wrong!</p>

    <p>"Exalted gods, I..."</p>

    <p>At this moment, blue veins popped on Wang Ling's forehead and he took out a mousepad and threw it at Mr Lu's face.</p>

    <p>It was too fast, and done almost all in one breath.</p>

    <p>Before Mr Lu could react, the mousepad hit him.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had just randomly thrown it, but Mr Lu was sent flying along with the mousepad to smash into the basement wall. While he didn't go through the wall, he did crack it...</p>

    <p>"..." Lord Diulei heard the noise behind him. Even without turning around, he could already imagine the mess behind him... He was going to have to pay for renovation works once again...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin broke into a sweat; he had forgotten to tell Mr Lu that it was better not to disturb his master when was playing games!</p>

    <p>Looking at Mr Lu, who was embedded in the wall, Xiao Yin called out his name softly. "Mr Lu? Are you... still alive?"</p>

    <p>Mr Lu fell to the floor with a swollen face and gave Xiao Yin a thumbs-up...</p>

    <p>He had survived; like Demon Tyrant Scholar <sup>3</sup> , he was tenacious in staying alive...</p>
