  <h1>Chapter 943 Wang Ling's Help</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Zhuo Yi didn't think he could solve the conspiracy behind this matter with his current means and abilities. His adorable little <em>shifu </em>Wang Ling had just recently given him a new set of equipment, but they were for dealing with cultivators on Earth. The enemy they were currently facing were aliens; not all aliens were as friendly as CJ7 <sup>1</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(An alien in a 2008 Hong Kong-Chinese science fiction film.)</dfn>

    <p>Seeing Zhuo Yi staring at the mobile phone and thinking, Warden Liang couldn't help feeling a little envious in his heart. "Director Zhuo, are you going to call the old Secretary again?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was blank for a bit before he replied, "Mm..."</p>

    <p>The outside world thought that Zhuo Yi's <em>shifu </em>was Secretary Sun Dakang, when in fact Secretary Sun was just Zhuo Yi's old leader; they didn't have a master-and-disciple relationship.</p>

    <p>The moment Zhuo Yi had taken office as Director of the General Administration of 100 Schools, the criticism outside had never stopped, which included the jealousy of his peers and the jeers from online water armies. Zhuo Yi had still been worried about this a while ago.</p>

    <p>But he was at ease now.</p>

    <p>In any case, when he was feeling downhearted, he had a reason to "tease" his <em>shifu </em>...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi waited for a while as the phone rang, but no one picked up.</p>

    <p>He then sent a text, but after waiting for a long time, there was no reply.</p>

    <p>Was his <em>shifu </em>busy?</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was well aware that usually, if there was no response to his calls or texts, it meant that his <em>shifu </em>was currently busy and didn't even have time to glue himself to the screen.</p>

    <p>In terms of importance, doing homework was more important than screen time, reviewing and researching ways to keep grades down was more important than doing homework, and eating crispy noodle snacks was more important than both of the above.</p>

    <p>It was still more than a month before school started. Needless to say, given his <em>shifu's </em> personality, he was unlikely to be doing revision so early beforehand; "cramming" before the exam was the key to high scores.</p>

    <p>So in short, there would only be one reason <em>shifu </em>wasn't answering his call now...</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, Zhuo Yi put down his phone right away and stopped bothering Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"What's the matter?" asked Warden Liang curiously when he saw the change in Zhuo Yi's expression.</p>

    <p>"Nothing... The old Secretary is busy with an important matter. I can't bother him," Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>"Important matter?" Warden Liang made a guess, and a strange expression appeared on his face. "Did... did the old Secretary find a partner? Has Secretary Sun done it?"</p>

    <p>Everyone knew that almost all the Ten Founding Generals were currently single. After all, when people reached that realm stage, they practically became indifferent to the desires of the flesh. However, for the sake of passing on the Ten Founding Generals' good genes for the benefit of future generations, the head of state had been busy arranging blind dates for them all these years...</p>

    <p>And basically every key office was very clear on the fact that if their department took in a girl that was pretty good, they could directly call the head of state to report it on the internal line.</p>

    <p>When Zhuo Yi suddenly said "important matter," Warden Liang's imagination promptly started to run wild...</p>

    <p>An important matter for the Ten Generals - wouldn't that be the blind dates?!</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "No... Much more important than that..." There was nothing more important in heaven and earth than Wang Ling eating crispy noodle snacks...</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, Warden Liang wasn't on the same wavelength as Zhuo Yi, and got it wrong.</p>

    <p>He had an utterly amazed expression on his face. "... the old Secretary has a child?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"My god, is the old Secretary pregnant?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Pregnant?</p>

    <p>Of course not...</p>

    <p>In this world, the only person who could get pregnant and make others pregnant was Tyrant Song <sup>2</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Refers to the "Pregnancy Gaze" spell in the online novel "Cultivation Chat Group," which causes a person to experience the pain of ten months' worth of pregnancy in ten seconds.)</dfn>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, in the independent space on Group Leader Detention Island, Evil Sword God's interrogation continued.</p>

    <p>There wasn't much more intelligence to be gathered now. Most of the people here had had identical experiences and encounters, so Evil Sword God could only ferret out the location of the person behind the scenes through small details.</p>

    <p>Just as he was feeling at his wits' end, someone in the crowd raised his hand. "I've seen the Governor..."</p>

    <p>"You have?" Evil Sword God dragged the man to the front with his sword qi.</p>

    <p>"I've only seen a rough silhouette of him, but I'm sure that the Governor is human, just like us."</p>

    <p>"Human?" Evil Sword God didn't think so.</p>

    <p>Now that they had confirmed that the other party was an alien and also had some tricks, they couldn't rule out the possibility that the other party was using some special technique to hide himself.</p>

    <p>After Divine Dao Star and Earth had established diplomatic relations, plenty of information on aliens had gradually been transmitted to Earth through Divine Dao Star as a medium. This information was public. The aliens came in all shapes and sizes; they had all kinds of appearances and some were very similar to humans, like the USB cable aliens on Convex Planet.</p>

    <p>The other party could create "power banks" which happened to look similar to humans, and then connect with them. Despite their human-looking appearance, these "human bodies" were just the aliens' hosts. As advanced alien lifeforms, the advantage which this race had was the ability to link up with all creatures to become a "community with a shared future <sup>3</sup> "!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(From the 19th CPC National Congress address..)</dfn>

    <p>So generally speaking, the more things were explained, the more things were hidden.</p>

    <p>Inside the van, the Old Devil and Cheng Yu had the same thought.</p>

    <p>Since this Governor was so adamant in disguising itself as a human, then it was very likely an alien lifeform that looked nothing like a human at all... If they were using broad classifications, it could be tentatively considered to belong to the "atypical branch."</p>

    <p>"Atypical branch..." The Old Devil was thinking.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the scene of Detention Island was being transmitted to the "Governor's" monitor screen.</p>

    <p>It realized that it had underestimated the people who had snuck into this secure space.</p>

    <p>This space had been created by Lord Brain King. Unlike the typical space created with cultivation spells, this was a space built entirely on data. As long as the data wasn't destroyed or corrupted, the space would exist forever.</p>

    <p>So even if this group of people had found some clues, the Governor wasn't afraid. It was impossible for a regular cultivator to destroy this vast space built on data.</p>

    <p>Dimensional data and magic spells could be described as having absolutely nothing in common. Using spells to destroy this place would be utterly ludicrous.</p>

    <p>In fact, Evil Sword God had already tried to use the sword qi to cut open a space, but that powerful sword qi sank into the sky like a basin of water splashing against a gigantic sponge, as it was instantly and completely absorbed.</p>

    <p>"This space is strange. My venerable self can't get out." Evil Sword God frowned; unexpectedly, he couldn't understand the space structure.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, let me think of something." Meanwhile, the Old Devil also had a headache.</p>

    <p>At that moment, the Mahjong Squad seemed to be in trouble.</p>

    <p>As a result, the mechanical octopus codenamed "Governor" was delighted. "Looks like our Brain King clan still stands above Earth cultivators!"</p>

    <p>It sneered.</p>

    <p>But at that moment, it saw a hand as white as jade suddenly appear in the air before its eyes...</p>

    <p>"An enemy attack?"</p>

    <p>It happened too fast for the mechanical octopus to react in time.</p>

    <p>The next moment, this hand suddenly made a grab for something in one corner.</p>

    <p>The Governor blanched, and seemed to realize what the other party was going to do.</p>

    <p>But it was too late.</p>

    <p><em>Crack!</em></p>

    <p>The Governor's base router, which emitted the WIFI signal, was crushed to dust...</p>
