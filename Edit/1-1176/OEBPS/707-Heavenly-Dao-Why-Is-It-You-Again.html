  <h1>Chapter 707 Heavenly Dao: Why Is It You Again?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was July 28th on the fourteenth Friday of the semester. Upon returning home from school, Wang Ling hurried to his room.</p>

    <p>He was preparing something, and that was the birthday gift which he had planned to give to Wang Ming. Wang Ling had actually already thought about it for so long, but hadn't yet been able to figure out what to give Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming's birthday was on Army Day, which was August 1st. It also happened to be the day of the summer camp. The school had organized for them to go to Beast King's Remains, and problems were bound to crop up. Hence, Wang Ling decided to prioritize the birthday gift first before thinking about anything else.</p>

    <p>After all, things should be dealt with one by one.</p>

    <p>The birthday gift, final exams, the summer camp, the mysterious young girl from the kun's belly who was currently receiving treatment to wake her up at Immortal Toya's place as well as the identity of that mysterious angler behind the scenes... He could only tackle these troublesome issues one by one.</p>

    <p>In giving gifts, the best would be to give a person something that was in line with their preferences, but this was the hardest part.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling knew that Wang Ming had very high self-esteem, so he had to be careful that his gift didn't touch Wang Ming's bottom line. For example, Wang Ming was obsessed with cultivation, and Wang Ling in fact had plenty of unconventional methods that could help Wang Ming on the path to cultivation. Unfortunately, Wang Ming himself wouldn't accept them at all.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had a vivid memory from a few years back of Wang Ming thumping his chest and solemnly vowing to Wang Ling that sooner or later, he would open his own path.</p>

    <p>Although he was muggle-born and just a regular person, he could stand shoulder to shoulder with the top cultivators in the world.</p>

    <p>Thus, Wang Ling could basically strike cultivation magic weapons off the list. He had initially planned to forge a permanent defensive artifact for Wang Ming with the three passion stones left over from making the Three Views-Shattering Hammer. But on second thought, he suddenly felt that this wasn't a reliable plan.</p>

    <p>Because Wang Ming would definitely prefer to use the rechargeable magic treasure which he had developed himself.</p>

    <p>After the incident with Lao Gudong and Shuigou Sect, Wang Ming had re-modified the Heavenly Materials sword, which had previously been taken from the Master of Immortal Mansion Cheng Yu, so that it was even lighter. Furthermore, a single full charge this time would be able to last up to half a month. The crucial point was that the sword could be charged very quickly, and only took four hours to become fully charged.</p>

    <p>Apart from that, Wang Ming had also added a device to the sword hilt which displayed the percentage of remaining spirit energy in the sword...</p>

    <p>It could be said that Wang Ming had already modified the Heavenly Materials sword for a modern and scientific age of cultivation. The most extraordinary thing was that not only wasn't the sword's functionality reduced, it had even been upgraded.</p>

    <p>The Heavenly Materials sword possessed a formidable amount of spirit power to begin with. As long as it struck something, even if it was just a scratch, the spirit power sealed inside it would be instantly released.</p>

    <p>During the previous Shuigou Sect incident, Wang Ming had used the Heavenly Materials sword to suppress a Nascent Soul cultivator, who couldn't put up the slightest resistance - this was enough to prove how powerful the sword was.</p>

    <p>After all, the Master of Immortal Mansion had poured close to a hundred years' worth of blood and sweat into forging the Heavenly Materials sword; he had even tried to capture Jingke, to pull the sword spirit out and place it inside the Heavenly Materials sword.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, his plan failed.</p>

    <p>Because the one shortcoming of the Heavenly Materials sword was that until now, it still lacked a sword spirit.</p>

    <p>So when Wang Ling thought about this, he already had an idea.</p>

    <p>Compared with giving a magic weapon as a gift, giving a sword spirit really wasn't a bad idea.</p>

    <p>Whenever necessary, a sword spirit could act as a bodyguard, and could also dial 120 for Wang Ming at any time. If he accidentally ate Zhai Yin's food one day and couldn't be revived... a sword spirit would definitely be able to save his life!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Creating a sword spirit, however, couldn't be done overnight. Furthermore, given the fact that Wang Ming wasn't able to generate his own spirit energy, simply relying on rechargeable spirit energy to spawn a sword spirit was absolutely ludicrous.</p>

    <p>But that didn't mean Wang Ming couldn't have his own sword spirit. Many mass-produced, commercial brand spirit swords on the market had pre-installed sword spirits. Some of them were artificially made while some were spawned naturally using industrial methods. As soon as they met the minimum industrial standard, they were taken to be sold through public channels.</p>

    <p>Sword spirits produced through industrial methods could be identified at first glance and basically all looked the same. As for sword spirits that were spawned naturally, they would automatically turn into the form their masters most wanted when summoned for the first time.</p>

    <p>The concept wasn't that much different to how an artifact spirit was generated, since a sword spirit was a type of artifact spirit to begin with.</p>

    <p>In order for the Heavenly Materials sword to produce a sword spirit to help Wang Ming...</p>

    <p>This required Wang Ling to arrange something with the Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>This was Wang Ling's third time summoning the Heavenly Dao this month with the equivalent exchange array, which was more than in the whole of the year before.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling had been younger, the Heavenly Dao had been eager to make deals with him.</p>

    <p>But now he was very afraid when Wang Ling looked for him...</p>

    <p>Of course, the Heavenly Dao was very happy to trade for Wang Ling's handwritten documents -</p>

    <p>what he was afraid of was Wang Ling giving him crispy noodle snacks yet again.</p>

    <p>The most terrible thing was that whatever Wang Ling used to trade with, the Heavenly Dao couldn't reject it... The core of the array was equivalent exchange, and as the person who summoned the Heavenly Dao, Wang Ling had the right to use whatever he had in an exchange.</p>

    <p>Including crispy noodle snacks...</p>

    <p>Even if what Wang Ling needed was a little more special, he just needed to give enough crispy noodle snacks in exchange.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling used the array to summon the Heavenly Dao again, its embodiment as the three-inch man was directly dumbfounded. <em>Why is it you again...</em></p>

    <p>The golden three-inch man was silent for a moment; several drops of cold sweat were already trickling down his forehead.</p>

    <p>After several minutes, he had to accept reality...</p>

    <p>The golden three-inch man: "What... do you want?"</p>

    <p>"Sword spirit."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling spoke telepathically, his eyes fixed on the golden three-inch man.</p>

    <p>"Sword spirit?"</p>

    <p>The golden three-inch man was dazed before he asked, "For which sword?"</p>

    <p>To the Heavenly Dao, sword spirits actually weren't anything special since they spawned naturally. The most important thing was that all artifact spirits were made from a very small part of the enormous Heavenly Dao system. As long as the golden three-inch man wanted to do so, he could custom-make a sword spirit.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "It's not my sword, I need you to set this up for me."</p>

    <p>The golden three-inch man: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling spoke telepathically: "Can't do it?"</p>

    <p>The golden three-inch man: "I'm not saying I can't... But if it isn't your sword, this exchange will be a little more costly."</p>

    <p>Costly?</p>

    <p>Chin in hand, Wang Ling pondered this before his telepathic voice trembled as he said, "How... how many crispy noodle snack packets?"</p>

    <p>The golden three-inch man: "..." He knew it!!!</p>
