  <h1>Chapter 515 The True Face of Primordial Qi </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Ambition was without doubt good, but there were times when achieving it was often difficult.</p>

    <p>Er Ha thought that at their cores, these brothers shared the same ideals.</p>

    <p>One wanted to thoroughly study the composition of the primordial qi.</p>

    <p>The other was doing his best to control the primordial qi himself.</p>

    <p>At their cores, these two ideas were the same, and had one thing in common: they wouldn't be easy to fulfill.</p>

    <p>Getting down to business, Wang Ming activated his space storage ring with artificial spirit energy and took out the lab assessment report. He had printed two copies and he passed one to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Er Ha jumped onto the desk and moved its head closer to look at the report with Wang Ling. Wang Ling didn't ignore it, but he did check to see if Er Ha shed any fur. Today's misunderstanding was too big, and it had already cast a small shadow on his heart.</p>

    <p>That was because he knew Mother Wang too well; she was an economical housewife who spent what needed to be spent and not a penny more. But after today's misunderstanding, Wang Ling felt that the next time she went to the supermarket, she might buy a whole pile of tissues.</p>

    <p>"What's this? Code? Can't understand it..." Er Ha stared blankly at the assessment report.</p>

    <p>The only thing it could understand was that it looked something like a map. The important thing was that various data coordinates as well as latitudinal and longitudinal lines had been marked on the map. Loopy Still had yet to fully understand language, let alone astronomy and geography... It hadn't even been a few months since it had come into contact with human culture. To be frank, it still had a lot to learn.</p>

    <p>"This is the machine readout, of course you won't understand it. It's good enough if you can read the map. I filled in those coordinates after making some calculations based on the codes. I checked them three times, there's no mistake," explained Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>These codes were actually the space location results generated by the machine after performing a reverse trace on the tattered Daoist robe, though they had still needed to be analyzed in order to obtain exact coordinates.</p>

    <p>"Since there are plenty of records on the many times that the Gate Between Worlds descended on Huaxiu nation, the academy has a lot of information on it.</p>

    <p>"Also, there are plenty of cultivators nowadays who either get spit out or are lucky enough to inadvertently walk out of the Gate. I've already checked their verbal accounts.</p>

    <p>"Putting all the information together, including these verbal accounts and the widely circulated maps of the demon world provided by dealers of rare maps..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming cupped his chin and said, "The coordinates are indeed for a location in the Gate Between Worlds, but it's not in the demon world. Apart from being able to trace the sword qi back to the location, the space assessment machine can in fact make a rough projection of the size of the map with a less than ten percent margin of error. Looking at the geography, it isn't the demon world at all."</p>

    <p>Er Ha's and Wang Ling's eyes couldn't help lighting up at this conclusion.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling lowered his head in thought as he stared fixedly at the map.</p>

    <p>It appeared that Daoist Guang's conclusion had been completely correct.</p>

    <p>There had to be a link between the Gate Between Worlds and the demon world where the space was located. As for why there were so many different coordinates on the map, the answer was obvious.</p>

    <p>That was because the link didn't lead to just one space; there were a lot of fake spaces created by Immortal Zhenyuan. Following this line of thought, Wang Ling even felt that none of these spaces in the link might be the Immortal's Treasure House.</p>

    <p>But the problem was that he had to go check it out himself in order to be sure.</p>

    <p>Er Ha thought that this would in fact be quite hard to do. Currently, the only way to get to the demon world from the human world was through the Gate Between Worlds. No matter how capable Little Master Ling was, there was no way he could instantly create such a gigantic world-defying portal.</p>

    <p>The Gate's configuration was obviously much more complex than the Soul Suppression Ring. Because the ring was small, it was easy to refine one of the highest quality, but the Gate Between Worlds would be a massive undertaking. Er Ha had already seen how complicated Immortal Zhenyuan's blueprint was when Daoist Guang had passed it on to Er Ha.</p>

    <p>In any case, Er Ha felt that based on its current cultivation rate, even if it could refine weapons, it would never be able to create this type of terrifying thing in its lifetime.</p>

    <p>Refining a world-defying magic weapon wasn't something that depended just on a person's realm. Many times, creating a world-defying magic weapon in fact mostly had to do with luck. Er Ha didn't actually believe in luck, but Little Master Ling's Great Fortune Spell did exist.</p>

    <p>While studying the language of human cultivators in the last two months, Er Ha had even seen a paper about luck which said that the reason why many top Almightys now were able to attain their realms was actually because their luck was naturally good.</p>

    <p>So as far as Er Ha was concerned, this Immortal Zhenyuan was actually a monster...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"There are numerous codes here, but most of them are space coordinates."</p>

    <p>Sitting on the bed, Wang Ming crossed his arms contemplatively, an inscrutable expression on his face. "But I did find a very interesting code that didn't stand for coordinates. Rather, it was information."</p>

    <p>"???" Wang Ling raised his head.</p>

    <p>Loopy Dog couldn't help asking, "What kind of information?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming smiled. "That space machine can track down sword qi and scan its surroundings. Out of this swarm of codes, only this code was the most interesting to me; it's about an unknown form of energy."</p>

    <p>When he said this, Wang Ling's pupils shrank slightly as if he had already sensed what Wang Ming was going to say.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming curled his lips as he said, "According to the scan by the space assessment machine, after I cracked the code on this form of energy, I realized that its material structure is very similar to your primordial qi..."</p>

    <p>What the fuck?! Er Ha was stunned. "How can that place have little master's primordial qi?"</p>

    <p>"Although we have yet to collect any from the scene for comparison, I'm guessing the similarity is as high as seventy percent."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said, "Supposing that primordial qi really exists in that space, there are two possibilities: First, it isn't something that only Ling Ling has; it already exists, just not in the human world.</p>

    <p>"The second possibility is more likely: When a cultivator's realm reaches a certain point, the source of their spirit energy will change, and the body will start to produce primordial qi instead as a substitute for spirit energy."</p>

    <p>Em... this explanation made both Wang Ling and Er Ha speechless.</p>

    <p>"Primordial qi can be spontaneously generated?" Er Ha had doubts. A cultivator's spirit energy was formed only after they had absorbed natural spirit qi from their surroundings to be stored in their dantian.</p>

    <p>"I'm guessing that after reaching a certain point in their realms, those Almightys became capable of drawing energy out of their own bodies and no longer needed to rely on spirit energy. This probably has something to do with the biology of their cells."</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling and Er Ha heard this, one person and one dog couldn't help the way the corners of their eyes twitched.</p>

    <p>Extracting energy from cells...</p>

    <p>So the true face of primordial qi was... chakra<sup>1</sup>?!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Chakra in the series 'Naruto' is presented as a form of life energy which everyone produces in their bodies to some degree..)</dfn>
