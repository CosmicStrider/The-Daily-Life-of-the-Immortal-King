  <h1>Chapter 10 The Truth from Six Years Ago </h1>

  <div>

      

  

      <p>Wang Ling perhaps already didn't remember the demon rampage six years ago too clearly, but it was still fresh in Zhuo Yi's mind.</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>The truth was that when cultivator support rushed to the coordinates of the Gate Between Worlds, the reported colossal, cyan-colored toad had already been defeated; there had been a bleeding hole in its white belly as its feet pointed up at the sky, and it was already dead.</p>

      <p>This was a fifth-ranked demon, an all-powerful demon king among all demons!</p>

      <p>Who the hell had done this?</p>

      <p>The cultivators on the battlefield discussed this excitedly.</p>

      <p>"Attention, fellow Taoists! I sense an unusual aura up ahead."</p>

      <p>At that moment, someone suddenly made out a hazy silhouette within the smoke in front of them.</p>

      <p>Another person swiftly cast a cleansing spell to dispel the smoke.</p>

      <p>The spell cleared the smoke and dust away to reveal a ten-year-old child who was trembling (purely out of rage) as he stared at the Tuntian Ha in front of him.</p>

      <p>"Tch, it's just a kid. Fellow Taoist, you're too nervous." A female cultivator with a motherly air embraced the trembling Wang Ling.</p>

      <p>Ten-year-old Wang Ling was just too cute for anyone to resist.</p>

      <p>"Good boy, there's no need to be afraid, big sister will protect you."</p>

      <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

      <p>Looking at the mad woman crushing him against her melon-sized boobs, Wang Ling didn't dare make any type of move. After his earlier outburst of spirit energy, he was still in an unstable state. Even the smallest movement of his fingers would blast her head into outer space.</p>

      <p>"...Fellow Taoist Cailian, please let go of this shota <sup>1</sup> . Look, you're suffocating him."</p>

      <dfn><sup>1</sup>("Shota" is the Japannese word used to describe cute, young boys.)</dfn>

      <p>"Oops, so sorry about that."</p>

      <p>The female cultivator called Cailian promptly released Wang Ling from her melons. "Kid, tell big sister, how did this demon die?"</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>Of course, there had been no way Wang Ling was going to admit that he was the one who had killed the toad.</p>

      <p>At that time, he had just wanted to extricate himself from this troublesome situation as quickly as possible.</p>

      <p>So, he had randomly pointed at a person.</p>

      <p>And that person, who had emerged from the other side of the smoke with dust all over his face, happened to be Zhuo Yi.</p>

      <p>Zhuo Yi remembered back then that he had just been passing by when the blast of a gravitational wave had knocked him down beneath a collapsing building.</p>

      <p>After he had broken free of the rubble, for some reason, he had been recognized as the hero who had killed the demon king.</p>

      <p>Burdened with a heap of undeserved honors and fame exaggerated by public opinion, all these years, Zhuo Yi had reflected on himself — no matter what, he had to stay true to his original will, and avoid being led astray by these empty halos.</p>

      <p>At the same time, he had continued investigating secretly, and it was only last year that the truth of the matter had started to emerge in bits and pieces.</p>

      <p>It was so incredibly vexing!</p>

      <p>No matter what, he had to chase down this person!</p>

      <p>And then, force this man to be his teacher!</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>Wang Ling had never expected that Zhuo Yi would actually investigate him.</p>

      <p>It looked like Zhuo Yi's years of experience at the General Administration of 100 Schools had significantly hardened his wings <sup>2</sup> .</p>

      <dfn><sup>2</sup>("Hardened wings" in Chinese is used to describe someone who has become independent in the sense that they no longer obey or listen to advice from other people who might be more experienced.)</dfn>

      <p>In fact, Wang Ling hadn't left, but had performed the Great Vanishing Spell, which concealed his figure and aura. Taking up a position near Zhuo Yi's supercar, he used his Heavenly Eye to look at all of Zhuo Yi's memories.</p>

      <p>With regard to what had happened six years ago, Wang Ling truly didn't remember it very clearly anymore.</p>

      <p>But now it seemed that it had really become quite a prickly problem.</p>

      <p>Also, Zhuo Yi's one-sided wish to apprentice himself to Wang Ling was a real pain in the ass.</p>

      <p>He needed to find an opportunity to settle this sucky situation in a practical way once and for all, otherwise it would eventually turn into a disaster.</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>Early Saturday morning was typically as peaceful as Wang Ling had expected, but it was just the calm before the storm.</p>

      <p>When he looked in the mirror that morning, he noticed his right eyelid twitching non-stop.</p>

      <p>It would be too naïve to think that it was due to a lack of sleep.</p>

      <p>When Wang Ling's eyelid twitched, it was an omen of coming disaster. Nothing good had ever happened when his eyelid twitched.</p>

      <p>He recalled that six years ago before the demon rampage, his eyelid had twitched the whole night, but at the time he hadn't had any idea what it meant.</p>

      <p>Fortunately, after washing up, his eyelid finally stopped its frenzied twitching.</p>

      <p>He estimated that it had lasted for less than three minutes.</p>

      <p>"Disaster level, two stars!"</p>

      <p>This was Wang Ling's disaster-rating scale, based on how long his eyelid would twitch for.</p>

      <p>Between zero to five minutes: disaster level was two stars.</p>

      <p>From five minutes to one hour: disaster level of three stars.</p>

      <p>From one hour to six hours: disaster level of four stars.</p>

      <p>From seven to twenty-four hours: disaster level of five stars.</p>

      <p>Over twenty-four hours: destruction of the planet.</p>

      <p>Over forty-eight hours: annihilation of the universe.</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>However, it was still within Wang Ling's abilities to deal with a two-star disaster level.</p>

      <p>He glanced at the monster pen and goblin eraser on the table. After he had magically transformed these two stationery items into these two gremlins yesterday, they had spent the whole night finishing off his weekend homework. Now they were drooping in his stationery pouch, fast asleep.</p>

      <p>Everything felt right with the world today...</p>

      <p>Wang Ling looked outside the window; the light of the sun illuminated the world, the breeze sighed through the willows, the Earth was still rotating on its axis, and the universe was still functioning. Never could he have expected the trouble he would encounter on such a peaceful weekend.</p>

      <p>After changing out of his white rabbit pajamas, Wang Ling left his room. Mother Wang had already prepared breakfast — a runny fried egg and two black pepper sausages, as always.</p>

      <p>"Son, come and eat." Mother Wang seemed to be in a very good mood today.</p>

      <p>In an unprecedented move, Father Wang passed Wang Ling a black diamond fork without prompting. "Handle it with care, don't break it."</p>

      <p>Wang Ling made an affirmative sound, and controlling his strength, he carefully pinched the fork with his fingers and raised it.</p>

      <p>Father Wang gave him a cryptic look, and smiled crookedly. "Hurry up and eat, you have a date today, right?"</p>

      <p>Date?</p>

      <p>Wang Ling raised his head.</p>

      <p>"If it's not a date, please explain to me, why is there a Maserati supercar downstairs?"</p>

      <p>Stunned, Wang Ling went to the balcony, only to see Sun Rong waving at him from a distance, a smile as brilliant as a Vileplume's <sup>3</sup> grin on her face.</p>

      <dfn><sup>3</sup>(Vileplume is a poisonous flower Pokemon)</dfn>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p>Motherfucker... why did this person know where he lived?</p>

      <p>Wang Ling felt that the disaster level this time had been tremendously understated.</p>

      <p>When he returned to the dining table, Father Wang's face was brimming with rare joviality.</p>

      <p>"Son, you don't have to explain, your father supports you."</p>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p>Father Wang grinned. "The girl downstairs is so thoughtful, this morning she gave your mother a limited edition L'Oréal youth-retaining elixir. Look at how happy your mother is."</p>

      <p>"..." <em>So you were bribed by a youth-retaining elixir?</em></p>

      <p>"If you don't come home tonight, be sure to stay safe."</p>

      <p>Father Wang gave a small grin. "Stay safe... in every aspect."</p>

      <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

      <p>Right after that, Father Wang surreptitiously took out a box of condoms and pushed it toward Wang Ling, with a gratified "my son has grown up" expression on his face.</p>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p><em>Crack.</em></p>

      <p>Subconsciously, Wang Ling once again broke the black diamond fork in his hand.</p>
