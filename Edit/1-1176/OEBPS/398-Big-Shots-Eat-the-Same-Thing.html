  <h1>Chapter 398 Big Shots Eat the Same Thing </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Taoist Guang's story was actually a little complicated to explain. There were too many secrets involved, so there was no way to explain it in a few words. Moreover, if Er Ha repeated its dream of its soul entering Taoist Guang's space from beginning to end, there was the dubious possibility that it might add something unnecessary to it.</p>

    <p>Hence, Er Ha simply jumped directly onto the table and placed Wang Ling's hands on its head with its paws as it remained relaxed. Er Ha knew that Wang Ling had the ability to retrieve memories, but there were limitations to it. For instance, the direct retelling of an incident by an involved party would definitely be clearer than whatever small news a person might have heard on the grapevine.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Er Ha had chosen this crude but simple way of directly copying and pasting its memory to send to Wang Ling. Searching and retrieving a memory, and copying and pasting it were actually part of a particular technique that regular cultivators would find difficult to learn. However, this didn't mean that Er Ha also couldn't learn it - whatever the case, Er Ha used to be an awe-inspiring demon king.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling watched Er Ha's series of actions on the side without a single expression on his face, and it was only after Er Ha's memory had been completely transmitted over that his expression changed slightly.</p>

    <p>He had no idea that so many things had happened during the time Er Ha had been soaking in the bath.</p>

    <p>Previously, Taoist Guang had been heavy-handed in forcing Wang Ling's soul to form a contract with his space without his permission. This had made Wang Ling unhappy, so he had blacklisted the old man.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling hadn't expected that this Taoist Guang would seize any opportunity available to him, and had found Er Ha through Wang Ling's soul contract with it.</p>

    <p>It could only be said that an old-timer was in the end an old-timer.</p>

    <p>There was no doubt that Wang Ling was very strong, but in the end, he was only sixteen years old. He actually had a long way to go in his cultivation, and at the same time, he lacked a lot of experience.</p>

    <p>Even Wang Ling himself couldn't solve the problem of his lack of experience; this was something that would only come with time. To be frank, his inability to contain his realm was also a problem of time... His realms grew too quickly. Normal cultivators all felt bitter at being unable to break through to the next realm; Wang Ling was the only one who was bitter that he didn't have enough time to adapt to each new realm.</p>

    <p>But he never forgot how to contain his power.</p>

    <p>Like his idiot big brother Wang Ming had said, his body was gradually becoming familiar with the special material inside the Dao talisman seal. When he had touched this substance at the very beginning, he had directly blacked out in the most serious instance. Even after regaining consciousness, he had remained weak for a very long time.</p>

    <p>But now, it could be said that this material was become less and less lethal to him.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought that this could probably be blamed on his immortal physique.</p>

    <p>The "Immortal Mode" supreme spell which Fang Xing had used previously was a kind of technique that could gather the spirit energy of heaven and earth and transform an ordinary physique into an immortal one for a short period of time. However, this technique consumed a tremendous amount of energy and lasted for a very short time... but when used in a real fight, it was actually very phenomenal.</p>

    <p>That was because a person with this physique would be able to freely adapt to their surroundings. Once this spell was cast, a person would be able to fight freely in any type of environment. And the best part was that this was an industry-certified orthodox spell without any side effects. As long as a person had sufficient spirit energy, they could continue to use it at any time; the only drawback was that it was difficult to learn.</p>

    <p>Therefore, from a certain perspective, Wang Ling's situation was even more phenomenal... he had been born with an immortal physique.</p>

    <p>As for the reason why he was starting to resist the "Anti-Wang Ling Matter" which Wang Ming had discovered, Wang Ling guessed that it was because an immortal physique probably went through a period of growth: the older he got, the stronger his body grew in its ability to adapt. And it was obvious that Wang Ling's current immortal physique had probably already succeeded in breaking through the kindergarten stage and was entering the primary school stage - this was also the reason why that substance's restraining effect on him was growing weaker and weaker.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling knew that this wasn't a long-term solution.</p>

    <p>He had to think of other means.</p>

    <p>He didn't know how much longer the effect of the Dao talisman seal would last for... As it stood right now, he would be thankful if it could last until his high school graduation.</p>

    <p>Therefore, when he learned what that Senior Pang, whose Taoist name was "Taoist Guang," had told Er Ha in the soul space, what Wang Ling was interested in wasn't the Gate Between Worlds itself, but rather the Immortal's Treasure House that Taoist Guang had mentioned.</p>

    <p>Rumor was that this was where Immortal Zhenyuan had left all his riches; it was the "One Piece<sup>1</sup>" of the cultivation world!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A reminder that this is a reference to the pirate manga series of the same name..)</dfn>

    <p>Back then, Immortal Zhenyuan had made two bold statements which had spread all over the cultivation world.</p>

    <p>First: he would personally appear to the person able to collect the genuine three items - the "Seven Stars Sword", the "Purple Golden Gourd" and the "Golden Canopy Rope"- and take them as his disciple as well as give out clues to the Immortal's Treasure House.</p>

    <p>Second: In addition to the clues, if a fated person found the whereabouts of the Immortal's Treasure House, they could inherit all the riches it contained.</p>

    <p>These two bold statements had in fact been around for a very long time and had already been circulated widely before Wang Ling was born... It was an ancient signpost, but until now, no one had found the place.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought that there might be something inside this place that might be able to help him.</p>

    <p>For the sake of the Immortal's Treasure House, Wang Ling thought he might as well have a good chat with Taoist Guang. But given this Taoist Guang's identity as a wily old bird, Wang Ling felt that it was better to be cautious when dealing with this kind of person.</p>

    <p>Thus, Wang Ling immediately put together a text message and called out another wily old bird in the current cultivation circle, one that brimmed with justice...</p>

    <p>He had barely sent this message when Lord Diulei replied almost in a second. "Brother Ling, you actually have clues to the Immortal's Treasure House?"</p>

    <p>On the other end, Lord Diulei had been completely shaken after reading Wang Ling's message.</p>

    <p>If this kind of news got out, the entire cultivation circle would tremble at its core.</p>

    <p>There were times when Lord Diulei felt that this Brother Ling of his was very mystical... Why was he always able to speak so lightly about such big matters with a straight face?</p>

    <p>Additionally, there was one thing that Lord Diulei was very curious about...</p>

    <p>According to what he knew of Wang Ling, Wang Ling usually wouldn't bother to get involved in something as big as this. Firstly, he liked to keep a low profile and didn't like to show his face in public. Secondly, he felt it was very troublesome.</p>

    <p>But this time, he had actually mentioned the Immortal's Treasure House of his own accord, and had invited Lord Diulei to go over and discuss it with him.</p>

    <p>Something was definitely fishy...</p>

    <p>Out of curiosity, Lord Diulei sent a message and asked, "Brother Ling, why are you suddenly interested in the Immortal's Treasure House?"</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ling looked at this message and was silent.</p>

    <p>The matter of his aura being suppressed was something that only his few family members knew about, and no matter how familiar he was with Thunder, there was no way Wang Ling would tell him about it - this was his biggest secret.</p>

    <p>Seeing that Wang Ling hadn't replied, Lord Diulei made a quick guess and swiftly sent another message.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Can it be... that the Immortal's Treasure House has a repository of crispy noodle snacks?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was utterly stupefied and couldn't help clicking his tongue; he had completely never expected that even Immortal Zhenyuan would like crispy noodle snacks...</p>

    <p>As expected of big shots... they even ate the same thing.</p>
