  <h1>Chapter 1060 The Truth About Fate Dao</h1>

  <div>

    <p>As the saying went, capture the leader and the bandits will fall. Once Wang Ling took down Bai Youquan, the morale of the prison officers instantly skyrocketed!</p>

    <p>They never expected the legendary Director Zhuo to actually have such hidden depths. If Zhuo Yi hadn't put a stop to this prison invasion, the enemy might have already bored several holes in their barrier! Not only that, the prison would suffer mass numbers of casualties! And if word of this got out, it would definitely drastically affect the cultivation residents of Songhai city.</p>

    <p>What kind of place was the prison?</p>

    <p>It was the most heavily guarded place within Songhai city. If such a place was taken down by criminals, it would no doubt be a severe blow to everyone's sense of security.</p>

    <p>In the Scientific Cultivation era, peace had always been the main tenet of the world; people scorned, resisted, and condemned this sort of criminal behavior.</p>

    <p>Someone once said, "If you believe your country is bad, you can try to build it up. If you think the government is bad, you can strive hard to be an official. If you believe the citizens are lacking in culture, you should start being a highly-cultured citizen from today on to influence the people around you with actual actions. If you find your fellow men ignorant and unenlightened, then try to change others by studying hard. One shouldn't choose to grumble, curse, and escape, or even resort to chaos and violence.</p>

    <p>"On the land which you stand upon, what you are is what it is. If you are out in the light, it will not be in the dark. If you strive for excellence, you will not heed the unfounded rumors and malicious gossip of those who wallow in self-misery. Don't listen to the cynics. If you can do something, do something. If you can say something, say something. If you have heat, then give out light. Even if you are a firefly, you can shine in the darkness.</p>

    <p>"If there is no torch in the end, then you are the only light."</p>

    <p>But unfortunately, there was a minority who didn't understand this rationale.</p>

    <p>They raised bricks, claimed they were powerless commoners, and turned what was originally a peaceful protest into a farce of vandalism.</p>

    <p>Violent behavior should be stopped anytime, anywhere.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, these people of unknown origins were attempting to launch a futile attack on the prison...</p>

    <p>Bai Youquan's soul had been locked in place by the King's Eye. Gritting his teeth, he attempted a last-ditch struggle.</p>

    <p>He was the mastermind of this prison break; naturally, he would do whatever he could to escape.</p>

    <p>The next moment, Bai Youquan writhed on the ground, crying out in pain. With his King's Eye, Wang Ling could clearly see that Bai Youquan was trying to split his soul apart.</p>

    <p>Fate Dao was a special type of Great Dao. People with Fate Dao could borrow fate from the River of Fate to overturn the heavens and change their fate so as to fulfill their goal of attaining immortality and invulnerability.</p>

    <p>This was a Great Dao which could control parallel dimensions.</p>

    <p>This also meant that if Bai Youquan gave up his soul, the soul of another Bai Youquan from a parallel dimension would take over the current Bai Youquan's body.</p>

    <p>This was the truth about Fate Dao.</p>

    <p>Initially, Wang Ling hadn't quite understood how Fate Dao worked,</p>

    <p>But everything was different now.</p>

    <p>Actually, Bai Youquan's idea was doable. His soul had been locked down by the King's Eye, and he just needed to split it apart and swap it out to escape the King's Eye Soul Lock.</p>

    <p>"Trying to use Fate Dao to obtain a new soul from a parallel dimension?" Wang Ling stared at Bai Youquan intently. Bai Youquan's soul quaked at his words, and he felt as though the thoughts had been plucked out of his head.</p>

    <p>"You..."</p>

    <p>Since his objective had been exposed, Bai Youquan's expression turned reckless in his hopeless situation. "So what if you've figured it out? You can't stop me!" He howled the words at Wang Ling before digging open a space tunnel with his bare hands and slipping through it like a fleeing loach. As Bai Youquan fled, he endured the two-fold pain of the splintering and transfer of his soul.</p>

    <p>If it was just a physical injury, he could freely transport a new body from a parallel dimension for his own. Masters of Fate Dao could move around ten thousand parallel dimensions at least. Using these dimensions as their own was akin to having ten thousand lives.</p>

    <p>When necessary, Fate Dao could be fully released so that a single person could even draw on the powers of the people in ten thousand dimensions to enhance themselves.</p>

    <p>However, this was an all-out move, and the ultimate profundity of Fate Dao â€” Return As One.</p>

    <p>Once this was carried out, ten thousand lives would gather in one body. Dying in this form would be permanent.</p>

    <p>Bai Youquan didn't have the guts.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, his Fate Dao was a power that had been bestowed upon him - he could only control one hundred dimensions.</p>

    <p>If he used Return As One and ended up dying, his existence in all the parallel dimensions would be instantly wiped out.</p>

    <p>There would no longer be a person known as Bai Youquan in the entire universe.</p>

    <p>"Hurry up. Hurry up..."</p>

    <p>Enduring the pain of the soul transfer, Bai Youquan allowed his body to float freely in the space tunnel as the spatial storm sliced at it.</p>

    <p>Compared to the pain that was acting on his soul, the torment of his physical body was nothing.</p>

    <p>But Bai Youquan very quickly noticed that something had gone wrong during the soul transfer.</p>

    <p>A force seemed to be stopping him from drawing power from a parallel dimension.</p>

    <p>The next moment, Bai Youquan realized that a crack had unexpectedly appeared in the space tunnel below him, and a golden-red eye was observing him from the middle of it. Instantly, Bai Youquan was sucked into the crack...</p>

    <p>By the time Bai Youquan came back to his senses, he was kneeling once more in front of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Bai Youquan thought that he had already fled thousands of li through the spatial rift, but the King's Eye had recalled his soul in the blink of an eye! Bai Youquan was pulled back in front of Wang Ling! The distance had become a matter of inches! No matter how Bai Youquan fled, he had no way of escaping Wang Ling's pursuit!</p>

    <p>"It's you... You stopped me?" Bai Youquan's soul wasn't replaced with one from another parallel dimension as he had hoped. He stared at Wang Ling incredulously. "You... you aren't Zhuo Yi!"</p>

    <p>Bai Youquan had noticed that something was amiss, but so what? Even if he spoke out, no one would believe the words of a criminal.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised his sword fingers and pointed them at Bai Youquan.</p>

    <p>His voice resounded in Bai Youquan's head. "I've devoured your Fate Dao. Now, you only have one life..."</p>

    <p>"You... you've mastered Fate Dao?" Bai Youquan found it unbelievable. He seemed to have already guessed the identity of the person hiding in Zhuo Yi's body, but ultimately didn't dare voice it aloud.</p>

    <p>"Like it's hard?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling crouched down and stared at Bai Youquan. He then reached out one hand to pinch Bai Youquan's lower jaw. "Speak. Tell me your objective."</p>
