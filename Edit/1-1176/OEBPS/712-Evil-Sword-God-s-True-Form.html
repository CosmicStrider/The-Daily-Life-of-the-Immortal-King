  <h1>Chapter 712 Evil Sword God's True Form</h1>

  <div>

    <p>To be honest, before the launch of this plan, President Dylan had already sensed something very fishy about this business. Given how strict Huaxiu's customs control had been, how could he enter the perimeter so easily?</p>

    <p>There had to be a catch somewhere!</p>

    <p>So, roughly a day before the operation...</p>

    <p>President Dylan received a lead on the remains.</p>

    <p>But according to the information from this lead, although the scheduled opening of the entrance to the remains was in Songhai city, the coordinates were completely different.</p>

    <p>"There are actually two remains?" Staring at the intelligence, President Dylan was lost in deep thought.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, things weren't as simple as he had thought.</p>

    <p>One of these two remains was definitely a decoy.</p>

    <p>Next to President Dylan, a young lady in gothic attire with a machete on her back and wearing a white face mask asked in a sharp voice, "Do we need to change the plan?"</p>

    <p>This young woman wasn't just anyone, and was none other than the rumored third disciple of Numinous Mother with the Magic Hands: Ghost Head Blade. No one, including President Dylan prior to this, would have thought that Ghost Head Blade's real identity was that of a young lady.</p>

    <p>President Dylan pondered, chin in hand. "There's no other way. Right now, we can only divide our group in two. You and I will lead one team to Peiyuan district's public square, and the rest will head to the other remains."</p>

    <p>"How will we get in?" Ghost Head Blade asked.</p>

    <p>"We'll hide ourselves as part of the medical personnel. To avoid giving the game away, I'll send someone to temporarily replace me as Han Di tomorrow," President Dylan said.</p>

    <p>This was a plan within a plan. It sounded foolproof and gave a person a deep sense of security.</p>

    <p>"Ghost Head Blade, remember that your task is to capture that person called Wang Ming alive."</p>

    <p>The girl folded her arms and said in a grim voice, "I can only do my best not to kill him."</p>

    <p>After all, the opponent was just an ordinary person who didn't know any cultivation techniques.</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade was thus utterly contemptuous of him.</p>

    <p>To her, he was nothing but a worm.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At around ten in the morning before the start of the activity in the remains, the antibody vaccinations were all done.</p>

    <p>Everyone sat in the square and waited for the entrance to the remains to open.</p>

    <p>In the square formation of students, Wang Ling stared at Head of State 001 standing motionless beside Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if it was an illusion, but it seemed that he had seen Number 001's eyelids flutter just now... To be honest, this was the first time Wang Ling had seen this type of humanoid magic treasure. Although Wang Ming had introduced this new black technology to him before, Wang Ling still thought that it was a little too realistic.</p>

    <p>Even a micro expression like the fluttering of eyelids was recreated to the extreme... it could only be said, as expected of something developed by Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>Although the overall development of this humanoid magic treasure was the result of everyone's great efforts at Huaxiu's Cultivation Academy of Science, it was Wang Ling who had designed the basic plan of action for the magic treasure.</p>

    <p>The most valuable thing of any magic treasure that one could obtain was its original blueprint, like the original blueprint of the Gate Between Worlds which had fallen into Daoist Guang's hands previously. At that time, although Daoist Guang had used it to wipe his ass, he had been unwilling to throw it away. After washing it clean, it was once again a brand new blueprint...</p>

    <p>In fact, after Daoist Guang used this original blueprint of the Gate Between Worlds to wipe his ass, its estimated value as a collector's item should have gone up.</p>

    <p>After all, this blueprint was once stained with the faeces of a True Immortal!</p>

    <p>Just when Wang Ling's mind was running wild...</p>

    <p>He suddenly looked up.</p>

    <p>He felt the air fluctuate. Although it was very subtle, he still sensed it.</p>

    <p>Was the entrance to the remains finally about to open?</p>

    <p>Looking up at the sky, Wang Ling noticed it turning dark all of a sudden.</p>

    <p>After all, this Devil Valley was Beast King's Remains. Given the king of holy beasts' style, it was completely reasonable for unusual natural phenomena to occur when the entrance to the remains opened.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, he didn't know if it was an illusion or not...</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling felt like the air was suddenly filled with the aroma of spicy hot pot...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, in Border Village Park on Xiling Road, Songhai city. The entire park had been closed for the past few days.</p>

    <p>Because Huaxiu Alliance had already set up the entrance to the fake remains here beforehand, all nearby roads were blocked, as with the real remains. There were only a team of experts, a medical team and a guard escort waiting respectfully at the entrance.</p>

    <p>In a military van that was being driven directly from Songhai First Prison to Border Village Park sat Master of Immortal Mansion Cheng Yu, Evil Sword God, as well as the Old Devil, who was getting used to a fake body after returning the one he had been in.</p>

    <p>Huaxiu's Cultivation Academy of Science had created this fake body, and it was only a while ago that they had helped the Old Devil switch bodies, the original one then returned intact to Jiang Liuyue, the Master of Shadow Stream. This fake body certainly wasn't anywhere as good as the body of an Almighty, but given the current situation, it was already the next best thing.</p>

    <p>Of course, a fake body limited the Old Devil's actions to a certain extent, but as the all-powerful and mighty Devil Emperor from back then, there was no need to doubt his battle experience.</p>

    <p>In the van, the Old Devil felt his flat chest. To be honest... he was still a little unused to the lack of those two lumps of flesh...</p>

    <p>The Old Devil sighed regretfully in his heart, as did the rest of the people in the van.</p>

    <p>There were times when you really only understood how important freedom was after you lost it.</p>

    <p>Master of Immortal Mansion Cheng Yu gazed at the view outside the window. After being locked up for so long, he found even the little spirit sparrows on the roadside especially beautiful.</p>

    <p>"Are, are we really going?" Evil Sword God sat upright and seemed a little nervous. "Killing people, that isn't very good, is it... <em>shifu </em>said, it's wrong..."</p>

    <p>The silent black-haired young man next to him was blank at this scene. "Has he always been like this?"</p>

    <p>The young man's expression was very grim. He wore flexible black armor that clung to his skin. The most conspicuous things on him were two thick boxing gloves inscribed with a pattern of black flames.</p>

    <p>This person was none other than General Bai, who was number one among Huaxiu's Ten Founding Generals and also known as Explosion Saint.</p>

    <p>The Old Devil spread his hands helplessly. "Evil Sword God's mental state has been like that ever since he was separated from his sword."</p>

    <p>General Bai frowned. He had thought Evil Sword God was faking it, but now it indeed did seem like there was something wrong with his mind. If that was the case, it was extremely possible that he would become a burden once the fighting started.</p>

    <p>Resourceful in the face of an emergency, General Bai went online and found a photo from Evil Sword God's arrest â€” wearing eyeshadow, he looked a little like a shamate chuuni young man.</p>

    <p>General Bai then held his phone up and compared the photo with the current Evil Sword God.</p>

    <p>General Bai somehow felt that the current Evil Sword God was missing something...</p>

    <p>A few seconds later, General Bai finally realized what was wrong and then stretched out one hand to rub around Evil Sword God's eyes.</p>

    <p>He used cold fire to burn eyeshadow over both Evil Sword God's eyes!</p>

    <p>After that, General Bai took out a mirror. "Chen Nanxuan, look at yourself!"</p>

    <p>The moment he saw his reflection, Evil Sword God immediately stood up. "How... How can I be so handsome!</p>

    <p>"Be so handsome...</p>

    <p>"So handsome...</p>

    <p>"Handsome..."</p>

    <p>The Old Devil and Master of Immortal Mansion Cheng Yu: "..."</p>

    <p>General Bai: "So, is he back to normal?"</p>

    <p>The Old Devil: "Probably, but his illness hasn't been cured..."</p>

    <p>General Bai: "..."</p>
