  <h1>Chapter 396 What Use Are Crispy Noodle Snacks </h1>

  <div>

    <p>The story sounded a bit odd, but it was indeed true. When Taoist Guang related what had happened in Snow Village, crystal tears even trickled out of the corners of his eyes...</p>

    <p>In life, nothing was more painful than a lack of WiFi when you wanted to surf the Internet, a lack of toilet paper while you were using the toilet, a lack of condiments when you were eating instant noodles, or being unable to finish spending your money before you died.</p>

    <p>"Brother Dog, just take this thing. You only need to convey my request to the senior outside," Taoist Guang said to Er Ha.</p>

    <p>He had already been mentally preparing himself; the Venerated Immortal realm was something that most people might aspire to but were unable to attain.</p>

    <p>While Taoist Guang had already been looking for unconventional ways of passing through the Samsara Spirit Tribulation in earlier years, it had taken him five hundred years to figure out the least dangerous way of getting through the calamity. Furthermore, a very important point was that he needed to have a good person to help him.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Taoist Guang had been thinking about this issue since meeting Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But was Wang Ling really the lucky star he was destined to meet?</p>

    <p>Before leaving the soul space, Er Ha didn't stand on ceremony, and directly swallowed the blueprint using the "Space Swallowing Spell."</p>

    <p>After leaving the space, Er Ha regained consciousness. As soon as it opened its eyes, it saw a silver-haired youngster taking its measure as he gazed at Er Ha curiously.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin stared at Er Ha and made a huge fuss. "Wow, you really woke up! Just now there was the smell of meat coming out of the bucket, and I thought you had already been cooked."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>"How do you feel?" Wang Ling stared at Er Ha and asked telepathically.</p>

    <p>Er Ha closed its eyes and cycled spirit energy through its body. It could clearly feel an unusual spiritual power working inside it, and it felt refreshed.</p>

    <p>After having bathed in holy beast blood, it indeed felt like brand new. Spirit energy flowed through its meridians more smoothly than before, and could be said to be utterly unimpeded. Not only that, Er Ha could even sense something wonderful in the depths of its soul...</p>

    <p>This was a manifestation of the increased rapport between the soul and body.</p>

    <p>Er Ha nodded. "I do feel a lot better." The holy beast blood had definitely sped up the integration between its soul and body.</p>

    <p>But Er Ha then realized a very serious problem!</p>

    <p>Its dog fur had actually turned red!</p>

    <p>"Why did my fur turn red?" Er Ha was already used to having green fur, and it was really very unaccustomed to this red fur which not only looked ugly, but would also easily cause misunderstandings since from afar, it would look like a leg of Jinhua ham!</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin said with a smirk, "After soaking in holy beast blood, this color will only disappear in a month at the very least."</p>

    <p>Pen: "It's not a problem, we have OMO in our house!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "What's that..."</p>

    <p>Pen: "It's a bag of laundry detergent personally enchanted by Little Master Ling. It can turn Africans into Europeans."</p>

    <p>"..." Xiao Yin once again felt that his three views had been dealt a heavy blow.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was greatly relieved to confirm that holy beast blood was indeed effective. However, a single treatment wasn't enough to completely solve the problem of narcolepsy. He speculated that it would take at least three more immersions before Er Ha was completely healed.</p>

    <p>And so, Wang Ling cupped his chin in his hands as he began to look Xiao Yin up and down.</p>

    <p>The expression on his face made Xiao Yin quiver a little.</p>

    <p>Judging from the eyes, there was some warmth mixed into this indifferent gaze, along with a bit of "kindness"... this was the kind of smile that hid malicious intent!</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin already had a bad feeling.</p>

    <p>He saw Wang Ling wave his hand, and a square box appeared out of thin air.</p>

    <p>Then, holding the box carefully, Wang Ling took a deep breath... He seemed to be trying to control some sort of agitation as he did his best to remain calm before he handed the box over to Xiao Yin and said blandly, "Your reward."</p>

    <p>Holding this box of crispy noodle snacks, Xiao Yin sunk into deep thought. "..." He had thought that the reward of twenty packets of crispy noodle snacks had been a joke; he had never expected that in the end, it really was crispy noodle snacks!</p>

    <p>It was fully four thousand milliliters of holy beast blood!</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin felt his liver ache, but very quickly he noticed that Wang Ling seemed to be in more pain than his liver... Who could tell him why Wang Ling's eyes were glued to the crispy noodle snacks, and what the hell was up with that brokenhearted expression?!</p>

    <p>Pen: "This is the reward my Lord promised you, and he's paying in advance. Mr Yin has yet to provide a further six thousand milliliters of holy beast blood - when will it be convenient for Mr Yin to bring it over?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>This was really the first time that Xiao Yin felt so wretched since he was born!</p>

    <p>He cradled the box of crispy noodle snacks, his face full of grievances.</p>

    <p>Crispy noodle snacks...</p>

    <p>What the hell could crispy noodle snacks do?</p>

    <p>Could they improve blood circulation and nourish one's appearance like the youth-retaining elixir?</p>

    <p>Could they clear the meridians like the essence-clearing pill?</p>

    <p>Could they replenish vitality and invigorate qi like the Da Huan elixir?</p>

    <p>Could it help someone who was dying recover like the soul-returning pill?</p>

    <p>Could it promote a breakthrough in realms like the advancement elixir?</p>

    <p>It was very obvious... no!</p>

    <p>What was more, the advancement elixir was just a legend; there was no way it existed. Although there indeed were related written accounts in historical records, no one had been able to produce it up to now. Xiao Yin had long heard that the Xiao clan had spent a lot of money to gather over a thousand of the top alchemists in Huaxiu nation and establish a research lab with the elite alchemists of the Xiao clan as its core.</p>

    <p>But after several decades, they had yet to even figure out the basic formula for the advancement elixir.</p>

    <p>Holding the box with a whole twenty packets of crispy noodle snacks inside it, Xiao Yin pondered...</p>

    <p>When it came to the matter of realms, the highest level among spirit beasts was first class; if first-class spirit beasts wanted to advance to the level of a holy beast, it would be like cultivators undergoing tribulation: it required a tremendous amount of time and a heavy price.</p>

    <p>But there were only a few cases where spirit beasts had become holy beasts as a result of going through this late-stage cultivation - Xiao Yin's understanding was that there weren't more than two cases in history.</p>

    <p>Apart from late-stage cultivation, another kind of holy beast relied solely on the bloodline inherited from a pure, native holy beast.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin belonged to the second kind.</p>

    <p>However, pure, native holy beasts were also divided into various levels. Xiao Yin thought that in the ranks of holy beasts, he was probably in the top tier, and was a sixth-class holy beast. When he was born, he had just been at ninth class; cultivating to reach sixth class had taken him six thousand years.</p>

    <p>That meant two thousand years per level.</p>

    <p>He was now eight thousand years old, which was still a "baby" in the eyes of holy beasts. It was just that for holy beasts, improving their realms was really too difficult.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, holy beasts were almost extinct in the world now. Perhaps there were still other holy beasts around, but they had probably all gone into hiding.</p>

    <p>At least, in the last century, Xiao Yin hadn't sensed the aura of any other holy beast.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Xiao Yin thought that it was likely that he was the only remaining holy beast in the world right now.</p>

    <p><em>I'm so rare... why can't you cherish and love me a little?</em></p>

    <p>When he thought this, Xiao Yin suddenly felt a little sad.</p>

    <p>Seeing how the silver-haired youngster had a wronged expression on his face as he cradled the crispy noodle snacks, Pen couldn't help sighing in his heart: some people just didn't recognize their fortune when they saw it...</p>

    <p>"Brother Xiao Yin, these crispy noodle snacks were all personally enchanted by our Lord; they are invaluable." Pen couldn't resist reaching out to pat Xiao Yin on the shoulder. "Many people want them but can't have them - you struck the jackpot!"</p>

    <p>"Huh?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was stupefied at these words.</p>
