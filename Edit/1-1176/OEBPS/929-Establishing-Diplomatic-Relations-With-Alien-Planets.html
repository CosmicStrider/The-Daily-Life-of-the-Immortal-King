  <h1>Chapter 929 Establishing Diplomatic Relations With Alien Planets</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In the divine realm, countless phantoms roamed the air.</p>

    <p>Jingbai opened a new passage in the air with a flick of his fingers, stepped through, and left. Every single one of the trembling phantoms let out sighs of relief at having survived the disaster. All sorts of emotions tangled together: panic, shudders, joy... Their feelings resonated, and in an instant, soared to a sublime level!</p>

    <p>A golden ball of light slowly coalesced in the sky as petals wafted through the air. Formidable godly power spread out, and the phantoms nearby all kept away, not daring to come close.</p>

    <p>Hundred-Winged God folded his wings and kowtowed to the golden ball of light. "Lord Thousand-Winged God..."</p>

    <p>The ball of light, which was a manifestation of Thousand-Winged God's consciousness, spoke in a voice that shook and echoed incessantly in the divine realm. "Is he finally gone..."</p>

    <p>"He's gone, Lord God..."</p>

    <p>"He's gone, at long last..."</p>

    <p>The godly ball sighed. "I'm also to blame for this. I forgot to tell the Divine Dragons not to provoke Earth. The Earthlings might look weak, but that planet is the most unpredictable."</p>

    <p>Speaking of this, fear still lingered in Hundred-Winged God's heart. "So anyone who assaults Earth, no matter the distance, will be punished?"</p>

    <p>"That's how it is."</p>

    <p>The godly ball broke out in a cold sweat. "You will be in charge of establishing diplomatic relations with both the Domain of the Gods and Earth - don't leave either one out."</p>

    <p>"Yes..."</p>

    <p>"As for the liberation and resurrection of the people, this also has to be done perfectly."</p>

    <p>"Yes..."</p>

    <p>"The most important is crispy noodle snacks! The most important is crispy noodle snacks! The most important is crispy noodle snacks!"</p>

    <p>"Yes..."</p>

    <p>Hundred-Winged God: "Then, in Lord God's opinion... what form should this crispy noodle snack planet take..."</p>

    <p>"Make a planet out of crispy noodle snack ingredients. It cannot be smaller than the sun."</p>

    <p>"Alright..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, Wang Ming, Zhai Yin and the other research staff at the research institute all breathed sighs of relief when the abnormal energy fluctuations on Earth completely disappeared.</p>

    <p>"The data gauges have finally been stabilized..."</p>

    <p>"That was close! I thought that the Earth was going to explode just now! But what on earth is going on?"</p>

    <p>"The abnormal energy is identical to the energy fluctuations six years ago when the Gate Between Worlds descended... Could it be a space leak?"</p>

    <p>"Space leak? Then can we block it with Whisper pads..."</p>

    <p>After surviving this disaster, many of the researchers collapsed on the ground, sweating profusely. Their emotions were complicated as they felt both weak and joyful. Just when the abnormal energy fluctuations in the Earth's core had been about to reach a detonation point, the fluctuations suddenly disappeared.</p>

    <p>In fact, research institutes in all the other nations weren't in any much better state than Wang Ming's. The whole world was in a complete mess.</p>

    <p>But fortunately, this abnormal energy had vanished in time...</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Ming received a phone call from President Qi.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin led him out of the lab to a secure room to answer the call.</p>

    <p>"Little Ming." President Qi's voice sounded from the other end of the call. "Have you figured out the cause of the accident?"</p>

    <p>"Old Qi, I was going to ask you about it; I'm still a little confused here myself." Dropping his forehead into his hand, Wang Ming sighed. "But perhaps there is someone who knows what's going on."</p>

    <p>"Do you mean Guo Ping..." President Qi was Wang Ming's teacher after all, and quickly deciphered his meaning.</p>

    <p>"The rumor is that Uncle Guo Ping is already dead, but I think he may still be alive, and moreover, has found the source of that abnormal energy back then," Wang Ming said. "And while I currently don't have any direct proof, based on my analysis, my guess is that this may be an energy-devouring phenomenon."</p>

    <p>"Go on," President Qi said.</p>

    <p>In fact, he also already had a theory himself, but he wanted to hear Wang Ming's opinion.</p>

    <p>This was the disciple he was most proud of, after all.</p>

    <p>"This energy came out of the Earth's core and expanded outward elliptically, assimilating all spirit qi in its path. My conjecture thus is that this was a premeditated engulfment, and after this abnormal energy covered the whole Earth... I'm afraid something like a black hole would have absorbed the Earth," Wang Ming replied.</p>

    <p>"I was thinking more or less the same thing."</p>

    <p>President Qi nodded. "Tonight, there will be an international video conference of research institutes. You will attend to explain the likely cause of this event."</p>

    <p>"Me? Old Qi, you're not going?"</p>

    <p>"There's something I need to look into. In any case, it's just trivial chatter."</p>

    <p>President Qi said, "Your identity is a secret, so you'll need to hide it well for the video conference tonight. I remember the institute has leopard fetus transformation pills; your face will soften after eating one. Find someone adept to mold your face."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming nodded. "Okay!"</p>

    <p>When it came to face-molding, Zhai Yin was actually pretty skillful, as girls were more careful. Although Zhai Yin handled things casually, after she started learning how to cook in the last few months, Wang Ming realized that she was quite an attentive person - although the food she cooked wasn't edible, it undeniably looked good!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Half an hour before the video conference, Wang Ming had already taken a leopard fetus transformation pill.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin held Wang Ming's face in her hands. "Tell me, what do you want to look like?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming didn't pause to think about it. "Please make me look like Zhuo Yi, but make sure to give me a pair of dead fish eyes, thank you."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>At the international video conference that evening, the experts of research institutes from various countries came together. They were all world-renowned bigwigs in the cultivation black tech industry.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin sat next to Wang Ming. The people she saw on the screen were all familiar faces that had appeared in authoritative magazines on scientific magic treasures.</p>

    <p>"What's the name of that good-looking one with the oval face?" Zhai Yin pointed to a little brother seated in the video.</p>

    <p>The little brother's looks weren't bad, and he unexpectedly reminded Zhai Yin of some actor's familiar face, but she couldn't recall his name at the moment.</p>

    <p>"This phD holder is called Zhai T Lin <sup>1</sup> . He published on a smart paper-writing device in a magazine previously. This writing device can calculate and extrapolate from existing research on scientific magic artifacts to draw inferences, and following a standard pattern, ultimately turn it into a new paper. What a brilliant trick! Such a dashing technique! Even the CNKI <sup>2</sup> wouldn't notice!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Zhai Tianlin is a Chinese actor
who was stripped of his
doctoral degree after evidence
of plagiarism.)</dfn>
    
    <br/>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure..)</dfn>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"I heard when this device was invented, it was already well received at the Spring Festival alone this year! Half the scientific circle congratulated him. However, some experts also say it will have a severe impact on fairness in academia, so until now, this paper-writing device has yet to go on sale."</p>

    <p>"Then... who is that elderly lady with the square face?"</p>

    <p>"That is Teacher Jia Tingyue, the inventor of the transnational underwater tunnel. She's pretty amazing. Actually, she's a foreign citizen with Huaxiu ancestry. When she built the tunnel and crossed the sea to Mixiu nation back then, she settled down there... and never came back..."</p>
