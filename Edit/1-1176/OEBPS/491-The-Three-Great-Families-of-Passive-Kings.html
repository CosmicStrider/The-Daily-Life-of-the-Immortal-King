  <h1>Chapter 491 The Three Great Families of Passive Kings </h1>

  <div>

    <p>No matter what kind of misunderstanding it was, trouble had now fallen on his head, and the first thing he had to do was deal with it.</p>

    <p>Additionally, Master was also in the house, so Xiao Yin had to perform well... he absolutely couldn't allow this person to interrupt his Master while he was playing the game.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin took a deep breath and tried to calm down.</p>

    <p>Thinking carefully, this could be considered his first real fight after Master had brought him into human society once the battle with Immortal Mansion was over. Xiao Yin had even forgotten the names of the fellow brothers sent by the Demon Hunters Association because they had been way too weak so he hadn't paid any attention to them at all.</p>

    <p>He thought this old gentleman in front of him wearing a suit and who looked like an aristocrat had good enough fighting strength, but he couldn't determine the other party's overall battle abilities when they had yet to actually start fighting. Thus, Xiao Yin wouldn't release his beast mode so easily unless he absolutely had to.</p>

    <p>He had fifty percent more fighting strength in beast mode than in his current human form.</p>

    <p>But even so, Xiao Yin still remembered back then in Immortal Mansion how Master had slapped him so hard even his own mother wouldn't have been able to recognize him...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin's body trembled involuntarily at this thought.</p>

    <p>After his feelings had calmed down, he looked at Mr Lu in front of him and asked, "Are you from the Demon Hunters Association?" Although he had guessed this person's identity, Xiao Yin asked the other party a token question for the sake of confirmation; the answer shouldn't be too different from his conjecture.</p>

    <p>Given that he had been engaged in the illegal spirit beast trade for many years, Mr Lu carried the scent of spirit beast blood on him which regular cultivators wouldn't be able to smell. But as a holy beast who was on a higher level than spirit beasts, Xiao Yin was very sensitive to it.</p>

    <p>The strong smell of blood combined with the strong demon qi on the man really made Xiao Yin feel a little nauseated.</p>

    <p>He wondered what kind of monster this person was...</p>

    <p>"Since you know I'm a member of the Demon Hunters Association, you must be the green-furred dog transformed." Mr Lu pointed the Skywalker sword in his hand at Xiao Yin. "My last name is Lu. Under orders from the president of the Demon Hunters Association, I have expressly come to kill you."</p>

    <p>Mr Lu stared at the silver-haired young man in front of him, frowning slightly. He had the vague sense that something didn't seem right, but he couldn't tell where the feeling was coming from.</p>

    <p>Think about it: a green-furred dog whose level they had gotten wrong - even if it had reached first class and could transform into a human being... wasn't it a little abnormal for it to be able to release an "intrinsic spirit field" instantly?</p>

    <p>But now that the fight was at hand, saying anything more was useless...</p>

    <p>He had to get rid of the young man in front of him first. If it really was the green-furred dog, it would turn back into its original form the instant its spirit energy was snuffed out.</p>

    <p>Even if his spirit energy was inhibited by the intrinsic spirit field, Mr Lu had absolute confidence in himself.</p>

    <p>A tree goblin required very little spirit energy; as long as it had light, it had nourishment...</p>

    <p>While Mr Lu didn't have an ability like the intrinsic spirit field, he was especially confident in his endurance.</p>

    <p>Combined with his unyielding "Spell of Creation and Rebirth"... theoretically, as long as there was light - any light would do! - one second of light would extend his life for one hour!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"This little brother, I am sorry to tell you that the intrinsic spirit field's restriction on spirit energy doesn't work on me at all."</p>

    <p>Saying this, Mr Lu chuckled. Now that the real fight was about to begin, there was no killing intent coming off him, and from beginning to end, he had a mysterious smile on his face.</p>

    <p>Then Xiao Yin suddenly felt his feet tied tightly down, as if something had wrapped itself around his ankles and was pulling him into the ground.</p>

    <p>Heh, trapped!</p>

    <p>Seeing this, Mr Lu sneered.</p>

    <p>He hadn't expected this silver-haired young man's intrinsic spirit field to actually be a desert. In a place like this, he had plenty of tricks up his sleeve.</p>

    <p>For example, he could subtly grow vines from his heels to travel silently through the sand and grab the other party and control them, like now.</p>

    <p>This move was called the Fulisha <sup>1</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The 'fuli' 缚力 here means 'binding force,' but 'fulisha' is a homonym of the Chinese transliteration of the name Frieza, who is a villain in the "Dragonball" series, and the joke will become apparent later.)</dfn>

    <p>"Shit... you're from a family of Passive Kings..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was stunned. He didn't think the person in front of him would actually be a tree goblin from one of the three great families of Passive Kings.</p>

    <p>What were the families of Passive Kings?</p>

    <p>They weren't holy beasts, but they were clans with long lifespans.</p>

    <p>Among holy beasts and demon beasts, there were currently three families that had been recognized as Passive Kings: one was the Toad clan, one was the Turtle clan, and the last was the Tree clan.</p>

    <p>These three great clans shared common traits, which were that they were extremely tough, had advanced defensive abilities, and were full of vitality.</p>

    <p>It was hard to kill them through normal means.</p>

    <p>This had already been proven when Er Ha had still been a Tuntian Ha.</p>

    <p>Not only had it been able to survive back then, Teacher Pan had also forcibly performed a fusion and turned it into a spirit dog; you could say that chance and fate had had some hand in this.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was stunned; one reason for it was that he realized that the elder in front of him was a humanoid tree demon, which had the strongest self-healing ability among the three families of Passive Kings. Moreover, they had plenty of skills at hand, and it was generally very difficult to get away when you fell into their trap.</p>

    <p>Secondly...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin found that he just needed to lift his feet slightly, and the vines wrapped around them all broke off! As soft as noodles!</p>

    <p>What was going on here?</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was dazed.</p>

    <p>It wasn't just him; on the other side, Mr Lu couldn't help frowning after he saw this scene as he muttered about how impossible it was.</p>

    <p>"Fulisha!" He grit his teeth and sent another wave of twisting vines out.</p>

    <p>Once again, they snapped off when Xiao Yin lifted his feet...</p>

    <p>Mr Lu's lips twitched as he continued to gnash his teeth. "Gold Fulisha!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin lifted his feet...</p>

    <p>Broken off again...</p>

    <p>"Diamond Fulisha <sup>2</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(In 'Dragonball," Frieza has Gold and Diamond evolved forms..)</dfn>

    <p>And then...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin proceeded to lift his feet...</p>

    <p>The vines proceeded to break off...</p>

    <p>After four rounds, Mr Lu put his hands on his knees as he gasped for breath and secretly whispered "what the fuck" to himself.</p>

    <p>The other party lifted his feet more effortlessly than sweeping orange peels!</p>

    <p>Using this skill in succession drained Mr Lu to some extent, but the spirit energy consumed was very quickly replenished through the power of light.</p>

    <p>"This person... is a little difficult to deal with..." This was the conclusion Mr Lu had come to in his heart after four rounds.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Xiao Yin had also realized something after four rounds.</p>

    <p>When he had eaten the crispy noodle snack previously, he had felt an unusual power take hold of his body. And when he had been restrained earlier, it was this unusual power that had discharged a stream of air which had caused the vines to disintegrate!</p>

    <p>He was now one hundred percent sure that with the support of this unusual power... he was immune to restraints!</p>
