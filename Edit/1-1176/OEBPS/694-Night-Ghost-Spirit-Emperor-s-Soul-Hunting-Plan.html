  <h1>Chapter 694 Night Ghost Spirit Emperor's Soul-Hunting Plan</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This black spear was called the Spear of Fate, which President Bai had bought with his soul and which used his body as a medium for the transformation.</p>

    <p>Not only was this President Bai's most powerful attack, it was also his last one.</p>

    <p>Because he had sold his soul, it would be directly absorbed by Night Ghost Spirit Emperor after this spear attack, and President Bai would become Night Ghost Spirit Emperor's puppet... taking out a high-interest loan like this was very risky to begin with.</p>

    <p>But when President Bai lunged forward, Wang Ling flung Jingke at him at the same time. Compared with the Spear of Fate's gigantic body, Jingke's brown spirit blade was like a tiny and insignificant spark. However, its battle strength was astonishing; when this brown spirit blade approached President Bai, who had transformed into this Spear of Fate, he couldn't help quivering at the looming sense of terror.</p>

    <p>He was going to die!</p>

    <p>This was his first instinct, as he sensed a killing intent which he had never felt before from this brown spirit blade. This was already his final trump card. He had smugly planned to teach this youngster a lesson, but ultimately had been reduced to such a sorry state and death.</p>

    <p>He was bidding farewell to this world in the most tragic way. He might not die, but he had sold his soul to Night Ghost Spirit Emperor for good, and would become his slave â€” this was an outcome even more wretched than death.</p>

    <p>It was over.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling gazed at him and didn't utter a single word, not even telepathically.</p>

    <p>But in that moment when he collided with Jingke, President Bai indeed read this meaning in this youngster's dead fish eyes.</p>

    <p>This battle was already over.</p>

    <p>Several seconds after the collision with Jingke, President Bai saw this initially feeble brown spirit blade abruptly grow in size, transforming into a huge light sword which descended on him with crushing force.</p>

    <p>As they drew closer to each other, President Bai could hear countless stately and hallowed voices in his ears, which contained an immense, world-shattering pressure that violently shook his heart.</p>

    <p>When President Bai and Jingke finally clashed, President Bai's eyes suddenly opened wide and despair was written all over his face.</p>

    <p>World-Annihilating Sword.</p>

    <p>The ultimate sword technique of the power of Sword Dao.</p>

    <p>In his last moment before he perished, it was as if President Bai's mind had cleared. At the same time, he unexpectedly felt a peace he had never felt before. Before the World-Annihilating Sword hit him, he conversely didn't feel any fear, since he knew that once he was struck down by this sword, he wouldn't feel any pain.</p>

    <p>The moment they collided, the entire space created by the magic treasure was smashed open with a violent boom.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling turned the golden light shield all the way up, for fear that his school uniform would be damaged...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, in Night Chief's secret base in Mixiu nation.</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor knew President Bai had died the moment it happened.</p>

    <p>"So, in the end he still lost?" He stared at the soul crystal ball in his hand and watched as President Bai's soul mark gradually faded.</p>

    <p>Second President Dylan standing next to him: "May I ask, Lord Spirit Emperor, how strong is the other party?"</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor frowned, and after a long while, shook his head and said indifferently, "Can't measure it."</p>

    <p>"It looks like the other party is very strong..."</p>

    <p>"Bai Zhe isn't completely dead. He sold his soul to me, but now that I have it, it's only a sliver left." Night Ghost Spirit Emperor chanted under his breath, and an azure soul light instantly appeared in his right palm. This was the soul which President Bai had sold to him, but it was already completely whittled down.</p>

    <p>"Is this broken soul still of any use?"</p>

    <p>"Whether it's just a remnant or not, as long as there is a sliver left, it's still useful to me." Night Ghost Spirit Emperor gave a faint smile, and then directly ingested President Bai's broken soul between his purple lips.</p>

    <p>The moment he finished devouring the remnant soul, he also absorbed President Bai's abilities. He uncovered his right shoulder and took a look; he had initially been wounded by Wang Ling's medicine ball when it had flown one loop around the Earth and then smashed into his right arm, blowing it right off. Even after it had been treated, a scar had remained at the joint.</p>

    <p>But after absorbing President Bai's remnant soul, Night Ghost Spirit Emperor obtained President Bai's powerful self-healing ability, and the fracture was instantly evened out, smooth as ever.</p>

    <p>To make other people's abilities his own - this was Night Ghost Spirit Emperor's strength; Second President Dylan trembled with fear at this scene.</p>

    <p>When he was done absorbing President Bai's remnant soul, it appeared that Night Ghost Spirit Emperor had something else on his mind. After leaning back in his chair for a very long time, he asked languidly, "Hm, by the way, how's it going with the takeover?"</p>

    <p>President Dylan replied, "I've already assumed control of all of the work of the Demon Hunters Association and I'll be leaving for Huaxiu nation in the next few days."</p>

    <p>"Good." Night Ghost Spirit Emperor nodded. "In addition, I'll leave the task of collecting the souls of the elite members of the Demon Hunters Association to you. Especially Ji Xing's and Yaren's souls; the best would be if you can bring their souls back in one piece."</p>

    <p>"Then how should we deal with that youngster who fought President Bai?" asked Dylan.</p>

    <p>"That youngster? Hm... it would truly be a splendid thing if we can eat his soul." Night Ghost Spirit Emperor could feel how strong that youngster was from President Bai's remnant soul. The more powerful a person was, the tastier their soul.</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor already couldn't help drooling at this thought.</p>

    <p>Dylan: "..."</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor wiped at his saliva. "My apologies, I forgot myself."</p>

    <p>Dylan: "..."</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor: "You must be cautious when dealing with this youngster. If we just leave him alone... he'll become Night Chief's biggest bane one day."</p>

    <p>"Then what is Lord Spirit Emperor's opinion?"</p>

    <p>"The strongest person will also have their weaknesses. The reason why Bai Zhe was defeated this time was that ultimately, he didn't hit the other party where it truly hurts. There has always been something strange about Number 60 High, and acting rashly before thoroughly investigating the other party definitely won't produce good results."</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor laughed. "I have some information here which I purchased from Mo Immortal Castle. According to this intelligence, this youngster seems to have an older brother and they have a good relationship. The critical thing is that this older brother isn't a cultivator. I think this can be our point of attack. When you reach Huaxiu nation, apart from supervising the master plan, assign someone to investigate this person."</p>

    <p>"Yes, Lord Spirit Emperor."</p>

    <p>"That youngster's soul is pretty tasty. If we can threaten him this time into willingly offering his soul to me in a trade, that would be too wonderful..."</p>

    <p>"Lord Spirit Emperor, your saliva..."</p>

    <p>"Oh my apologies, I forgot myself again."</p>

    <p>Then, President Dylan heard Night Ghost Spirit Emperor suck his drool back in...</p>
