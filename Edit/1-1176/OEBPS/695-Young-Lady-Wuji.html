  <h1>Chapter 695 Young Lady Wuji</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When Wang Ling opened his eyes again, it was already dusk, and there were several spotlights above his head. He had reappeared at Number 60 High's main gate. The space rift that had appeared earlier had already been sealed off with layer upon layer of seals and barriers. He gave several police officers who had been inspecting the barrier a shock - no one had expected this outcome, that this student who had been swallowed up by this space rift would actually be sent back safe and sound!</p>

    <p>Forget the police officers, even Wang Ling himself was confused.</p>

    <p>He hadn't expected to be spat out in the same place he had been swallowed up, which led to the surrounding police officers looking at him as if they were seeing a "rare animal."</p>

    <p>"What's going on? Didn't they say that he had already been swallowed up?" The police officers scratched their heads, feeling that their overtime tonight was all for nothing...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After being spat out by the space, what unavoidably and naturally followed was the police taking Wang Ling's statement as well as asking all kinds of questions. The whole thing actually wasn't too troublesome, since President Bai had already died after giving up his soul, and as the only witness, Wang Ling could say whatever he wanted.</p>

    <p>But this time, he didn't push everything on Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>It was clear at the moment that behind President Bai, there was an even more powerful expert pulling the strings, and this person was the leader of the foreign power, Night Chief. Given the current situation, Wang Ling didn't really want his disciple to shoulder even this overseas "wok"; that would really be going a little too far...</p>

    <p>It was already midnight by the time Wang Ling got home, and it was Lord Diulei who personally drove him back to the Wang family's small villa. It was all quiet inside as Wang Ling stood at the front door.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei waited in his car at the gate for a while, thinking that the seniors inside the villa would come out to receive them. When no one came out after a long time, the expression on his face was a little awkward. "Brother Ling, it seems that the seniors have already gone to bed."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>The corner of Wang Ling's mouth twitched.</p>

    <p>So Thunder, this fake dad, cared more about him than his own biological parents?!</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, you should also get some early rest. Brother Zhuo and I will handle everything else at the police station." Lord Diulei smiled.</p>

    <p>Because Lord Diulei courted death all year round, he frequently came into contact with the police, so dealing with all kinds of cases was a piece of cake. President Bai's body had been destroyed along with the space, and Wang Ling guessed that Night Ghost Spirit Emperor had absorbed whatever was left of his soul... Of course, while he was clear as a mirror about this, he hadn't told the police everything.</p>

    <p>Because he really wouldn't be able to explain it clearly if he did.</p>

    <p>He was now just a student, and his main priority was the upcoming final exams. If he was foolish enough to tell the police everything, the fact that he was immensely powerful would without doubt be exposed.</p>

    <p>What was more, he had attracted too much attention after this incident today.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed; initially, his aim had been to be a transparent existence, but given all the things that had happened until now, it was a little hard for him to keep a low profile. Wang Ling felt that talk of him directly achieving an SSR result during the entrance exam at the start of the semester had only just started to die down recently; in the end, he was now the focus of attention once again.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling got out of the car, he gave the Wuji Umbrella which he had taken from President Bai to Thunder, to take back and give to Xiao Yin to handle.</p>

    <p>Wuji Umbrella: "Big Brother, hello! Please take care of me! We're one big family from now on!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei knew about retrieving the Wuji Umbrella. Because there were a lot of things the other man would need to follow up on, Wang Ling had directly relayed his memory of the fight with President Bai in the space to Thunder, so the latter couldn't be any clearer about what had happened.</p>

    <p>The moment Lord Diulei accepted the small black umbrella, he couldn't help sighing again. As expected, Brother Ling truly was formidable! He could actually directly invalidate the magic weapon contract!</p>

    <p>This technique was too fearsome... In some sense, he thought that Wang Ling was just like a game administrator, who could directly use his identity to unlock game equipment!</p>

    <p>But gripping the Wuji Umbrella, Lord Diulei looked concerned. From its tone just now, it was clear that this wasn't an honorable umbrella. The most important thing, moreover, was that this Wuji Umbrella currently didn't have a master after its contract had been erased. If something were to suddenly happen on the way home, Lord Diulei felt it would be very hard for him to quell the situation with his own power.</p>

    <p>Given how extraordinary this magic treasure was, he inevitably had to think a little more on the matter. The reason why the Wuji Umbrella was so obedient right now was because Wang Ling was here... Who knew if it would be just as well-behaved when Wang Ling wasn't around?</p>

    <p>Just as he was thinking this, Lord Diulei saw Wang Ling suddenly grab hold of one of his hands.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Brother Ling, isn't this a little too fast? I'm not prepared yet..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..." What was this guy thinking about now...</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Ling fixed his gaze on Lord Diulei and said something to him telepathically, and the latter immediately seemed enlightened.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Everything was as Lord Diulei had expected. The Wuji Umbrella, which had been resting quietly on the passenger seat as Lord Diulei took it back, suddenly moved to directly hover in the air and project a virtual image.</p>

    <p>This was the human form of the Wuji Umbrella: a young maiden with long, pointy ears and long purple hair, her face wrapped with bandages. Her name was Wuji.</p>

    <p>"Was that big shot just now your friend?" asked the Wuji Umbrella's weapon spirit.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei raised his eyebrows. "So what?" His keen intuition was telling him that this Wuji Umbrella was most likely plotting something.</p>

    <p>As expected, this umbrella would act up as long as Brother Ling wasn't around!</p>

    <p>It was fortunate that Lord Diulei had foreseen all of this.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling had grabbed hold of his hand just now, he had actually deposited a spell inside the Soul Suppression Ring. Although the ring was a resurrection-type magic artifact, it also had a space which could be used to store spells.</p>

    <p>"It looks like you're just a Soul Formation cultivator?" the maiden said in a profound voice.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei laughed. "What? Looking down on Soul Formation cultivators?"</p>

    <p>The young lady smiled sinisterly. "No, I was just thinking, if..."</p>

    <p>"Your plan is to use me as a hostage to threaten Brother Ling."</p>

    <p>"You knew?" The young lady was startled.</p>

    <p>Holding the steering wheel, Lord Diulei was unperturbed. "Do you know why Brother Ling touched my hand just now?"</p>

    <p>The young lady shook her head. ???"</p>

    <p>"He put ten flame purification spells in my ring, and said that if you didn't behave, to directly incinerate you." He looked at the young lady. "If you don't believe me, shall we give it a try?"</p>

    <p>The young lady: "You actually thought this far ahead..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Still want to make a move?"</p>

    <p>She smiled humbly, then patted him on his shoulder. "Hahaha!! I was just kidding! Aren't we one big family?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei sighed. "..."</p>

    <p>Women flipped faces faster than flipping through a book...</p>
