  <h1>Chapter 860 Old Man Wang's Knife Technique</h1>

  <div>

    <p>There were quite a lot of people at home today...</p>

    <p>It had been a long time since the Wang family's small villa was this lively. When Wang Ling went downstairs, he saw Liu Qingyi, Wang Zhen and the others sitting very demurely on the sofa. It seemed that prior to coming, these two people had already been warned by those who had visited the Wang family's small villa before. When all was said and done, everyone recognized Father Wang, Mother Wang and even Old Man Wang as "hidden big shots"...</p>

    <p>But the fact was that Father Wang, Mother Wang and Old Man Wang were only at the Physical Build stage... In this current era of national cultivation, the Physical Build cultivator wasn't any different from an ordinary person - at the very most, they were just a little stronger and had better physiques.</p>

    <p>In Wang Ling's view, Father Wang's physique also wasn't great, as he would suffer from hemorrhoids every so often and was unwilling to ask Wang Ling for help. In the last few years, the only time Father Wang had gotten Wang Ling to use magical treatment was for his hair.</p>

    <p>Last year, for the sake of topping the monthly votes ranking three months in a row, Father Wang had exploded with updates, churning out twenty thousand words a day. Authors on other websites angrily called him "Touched (Beast) <sup>1</sup>"... Pulling all-nighters for a long period of time led to an endlessly receding hairline - each time Father Wang had a shower, he would grab a handful of hair and drop it on the floor as if he was cooking noodles soup.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>("Touch" and "beast" are
pronounced the same way in
Mandarin ..)</dfn>

    <p>Furthermore, because of the dry weather then and coupled with his weak health, Father Wang would get hemorrhoids as well as frequent nosebleeds because of the heat inside his body. So, when he took a shower, the dropped hair and dripping blood blended together, and from a distance looked like a pot of old duck vermicelli soup.</p>

    <p>That year, Father Wang couldn't stand it anymore and finally asked Wang Ling for help.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling simply raised one finger and lightly poked Father Wang in between his eyebrows, and all of Father Wang's abnormal conditions directly disappeared.</p>

    <p>While pulling all-nighters now was nothing unusual for Father Wang, he ultimately had the stimulatory cigars which the head of state gave him, so he didn't suffer from any side effects. However, staying up late too often could easily cause hemorrhoids. In fact, Wang Ling had a trick that could make Father Wang's hemorrhoids disappear forever...</p>

    <p>But it was a little violent.</p>

    <p>Well...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had to poke Father Wang in the anus.</p>

    <p>Aside from the fact that there was no way Father Wang would accept it, even Wang Ling couldn't bring himself to do it, so he had never brought it up.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought that if he did use this move, he wouldn't be able to eat crispy noodle snacks anymore...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Old Man Wang and Jiang Haifu were still busy in the kitchen. In the spirit of fairness, a barrier had already been set up outside the kitchen to prevent the cultivators present from peeking into the kitchen with their power of sight.</p>

    <p>However, this barrier couldn't hide anything from Wang Ling's eyes. Old Man Wang and Jiang Haifu were making preparations before they started cooking.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw Jiang Haifu take out a knife, which looked like it had been made from ice. It glittered under the light and was very translucent. Gripping the knife's broad handle, Jiang Haifu held the fish down with one hand and expertly cut into the fish with the ice knife. He then yanked sharply at an angle, and sliced off a delicate and glossy piece of cold fish skin, just like that.</p>

    <p>This was an extremely formidable knife technique.</p>

    <p>It seemed that Jiang Haifu would be presenting a fish dish today.</p>

    <p>But on the other side, it seemed what Old Man Wang was also making a fish dish.</p>

    <p>For today's two-men competition, they were using the same ingredient.</p>

    <p>After slicing off the fish skin, Jiang Haifu immersed it in fresh water to clean it, and then looked at Old Man Wang next to him who was also handling fish skin.</p>

    <p>Old Man Wang wasn't using an ice knife, which greatly surprised Jiang Haifu.</p>

    <p>An ice knife was the best kind for cooking fish skin because it had a lower temperature than a regular kitchen knife, which would preserve the freshness of the fish skin while slicing it without damaging the quality of the meat.</p>

    <p>But the knife Old Man Wang was using was actually a meter-long machete...</p>

    <p>At that moment, Old Man Wang had already removed his shirt, revealing his old but no less firm muscles.</p>

    <p>Yes!</p>

    <p>Muscles!</p>

    <p>Old Man Wang had always had muscles!</p>

    <p>Although Old Man Wang had had dementia a while back, he never gave up exercising. Even though his metabolism was much slower at his age, his body was covered with muscles that would be the utter envy of young men.</p>

    <p>Of course, this wasn't apparent at all when the old man had his clothes on.</p>

    <p>Seeing this, Wang Ling felt it was a bit of a pity.</p>

    <p>If his grandma was still alive, she would definitely be very happy...</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, Wang Ling hadn't been born then. Otherwise, Grandma Wang would definitely still be alive now.</p>

    <p>Grandma Wang had already been laid to rest, and while Father Wang knew that Wang Ling had the ability to resurrect her, he didn't want to bother her... Grandma Wang was a famous jade flower in her village, and when she died, the entire village had been part of her funeral procession.</p>

    <p>If she was casually revived, that place would become a ghost village... it might even attract Daoist ghost hunters.</p>

    <p>Well...</p>

    <p>Back to the main topic.</p>

    <p>Holding a meter-long machete in his hand, Old Man Wang at that moment looked like an executioner on the execution grounds.</p>

    <p>His face was as calm as an ancient well, but his imposing manner inside out completely stupefied Jiang Haifu.</p>

    <p>The old man's eyes then sharpened with focus. He was like a hunter in search of prey, his eyes fixed firmly on that big, plump fish on the chopping board. The fish wasn't completely dead, and it hadn't even been completely scaled. Its eyes glittered with light, and it shook its tail with all its might on the chopping board, as if to tell onlookers that it could still be saved.</p>

    <p>But in front of a chef, this poor fish could in the end only become food.</p>

    <p>This was a fish that could make people happy after they ate it, so in the eyes of both Old Man Wang or Jiang Haifu, it wasn't pitiful at all.</p>

    <p>The old man's stomach then swelled slightly. As if he was gathering his prehistoric powers together, he started to take deep breaths. Jiang Haifu even felt as if the temperature had somehow plummeted several degrees at that moment.</p>

    <p>Old Man Wang clearly wasn't using an ice knife...</p>

    <p>But it gave people a very cold feeling!</p>

    <p>The next second, Old Man Wang silently opened his eyes. "Depression Knife Technique!"</p>

    <p>Then, he slashed at the chopping board!</p>

    <p>However, this slash wasn't aimed directly at the big, plump fish. Instead, it stopped 0.0001cm from the big fish's round, sexy lips!</p>

    <p>In a split second, this originally lively big fish that had thought it could still be saved actually stopped struggling... Even its tail stopped moving.</p>

    <p>Before Jiang Haifu could figure out what kind of operation Old Man Wang had used...</p>

    <p>The big fish actually let out a lament.</p>

    <p>The next second, this big fish directly sat up on the chopping board, then removed its own skin, folded it, and put it on the side... It was already depressed - its eyes were no longer lit up with brimming hope, but only contained a strange light...</p>

    <p>Jiang Haifu and Wang Ling: "..."</p>
