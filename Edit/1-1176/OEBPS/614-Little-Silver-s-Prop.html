  <h1>Chapter 614 Xiao Yin's Prop</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Xiao Yin found it hard to imagine that such an ugly sofa was actually worth half a million. Could it be that the broccoli sofa had been infused with leopard bone? No way, right?</p>

    <p>Forget it... half a million was half a million. He was currently on a diet anyway, and wasn't eating as much takeout. Worst comes to worst, he just wouldn't order devil fruit this month; every time he ordered takeout, half the total cost was from devil fruits.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin felt that he shouldn't be so extravagant and should save a little on his food expenses.</p>

    <p>At this thought, he immediately sighed: It looked like he would have to subsist on Yang's Braised Chicken Rice <sup>1</sup> next month, which was really painful...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Yang's Braised Chicken Rice is one of China's most popular restaurant chains.)</dfn>

    <p>After living with Xiao Yin for a period of time, Thunder basically already understood this "Silver's" character. However, there was one point that had always been beyond Thunder's expectations, and that was this Silver's almost fanatical reverence for Brother Ling.</p>

    <p>To be able to make a holy beast open his heart to accept a master...</p>

    <p>It could only be said that Brother Ling was truly Brother Ling...</p>

    <p>Suddenly, Lord Diulei felt a little sad for some reason.</p>

    <p>Even though Xiao Yin was Brother Ling's contract beast, it was everyone's duty to protect holy beasts. As Silver's current "keeper," he had to think of ways to become stronger!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei cupped his chin as he gazed at the anxious and impatient Silver in front of him. "Brother Xiao, why did you yell for me?"</p>

    <p>"I would like to ask, under what circumstances would Master take the initiative to walk a dog?" Xiao Yin asked solemnly.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Walk a dog?"</p>

    <p>This was a question Lord Diulei had never thought about.</p>

    <p>Because walking the dog was a regular thing which all dog owners did, mainly so that their dogs didn't get bored. Scientific research showed that keeping a dog inside the house for long periods of time wasn't good for its physical and mental health. Furthermore, this didn't apply to just spirit dogs. Many pet trainers now were in the habit of walking their spirit beasts. But for the most part, this applied to spirit beasts that hadn't taken on human forms.</p>

    <p>There were many types of spirit beasts, and many of those that hadn't transformed into humans looked very frightening, so letting this group of spirit beasts wander around on their own while on a walk could be dangerous. The state's rule that spirit beasts had to be personally guided by their owners while they were out was thus aimed at this group.</p>

    <p>Additionally, there was also a state restriction on body types. Spirit beasts that were too large were forbidden from crossing streets that bustled with larger crowds of people, and they had to find another route.</p>

    <p>"Why is Brother Xiao suddenly concerned about this?" Lord Diulei was very curious about the question Xiao Yin had raised. For a holy beast that had already successfully transformed into a modern-day shut-in, it was mystifying that he would actually care about going out to walk the dog.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin sighed heavily. "It's all because of that Dog Bapi..."</p>

    <p>"What's wrong with Brother Dog?" asked Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "It said that Master pampers it solely... But it was punished recently and Master decided not to take it out for walks for the next month, so I think it's a good chance for me to seize the top spot!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei took a deep breath. "Brother Xiao, don't tell me..."</p>

    <p>"Yes! That's right!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin had a serious expression on his face. "I want Master to walk me!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was alarmed. "But you can't reveal your beast form, otherwise you'll be discovered - did you forget you already promised Brother Ling? And Brother Ling himself doesn't like standing out..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin shrugged his shoulders. "Then I'll go out in my human form!"</p>

    <p>"... It's impossible, Brother Xiao, just give up." Lord Diulei patted his face; wouldn't walking a human stand out even more?!</p>

    <p>'Whether it's impossible or not, I have to try!" Xiao Yin grit his teeth and refused to give up. "I've already booked a Shun Feng car; I'm going to go to a spirit beast specialty store in the afternoon to have a look!"</p>

    <p>"Brother Xiao, what do you want to do..." Lord Diulei had a bad feeling.</p>

    <p>"Go look at collars," Xiao Yin replied seriously.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>That afternoon, Xiao Yin put on a peaked cap and set off, the car he booked picking him up at the entrance to Wenxian Garden villa estate.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was going to visit Songhai city's flagship spirit beast specialty store.</p>

    <p>It was one of the biggest specialty stores in the city which sold specialized spirit beast goods. It had everything one could think of, including food for spirit beasts, various types of protective equipment for spirit beasts and even magic treasures customized for spirit beast use.</p>

    <p>However, these types of magic treasure were far inferior to the ones that Luo Chuang personally customized, because most of them were bought directly from the factories and the quality of mass produced magic treasures was basically all the same.</p>

    <p>The flagship store was quite far from Wenxian Garden. In order to save money, Xiao Yin had chosen to use a Didi Shun Feng spirit car. The app had a promotion at the moment: as long as you uploaded a photo of yourself and registered with your real name, if you got over a thousand likes on your photo in the app community, you would get a discount on your first ten rides.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin had already prepared his travel plan for today earlier that morning.</p>

    <p>He was quite confident in his photo, which showcased his long flowing hair and him making a heart sign. When he went out, his likes in the community had actually already surpassed ten thousand...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin looked at the number of likes and was elated.</p>

    <p>He hadn't added any filters, yet he was still so popular!</p>

    <p>Actually, Xiao Yin had a very good foundation to begin with; whether his skin had been photoshopped or not, or whether filters had been added, the effect was still the same.</p>

    <p>It looked like he really had the talent to become an actor.</p>

    <p>In fact, Xiao Yin had thought before about looking for part-time jobs to earn money. Just relying on the living expenses that Thunder gave him every month actually wasn't very nice... And the most important thing was the additional expenses. Most of the living expenses which Thunder gave him actually went to food; if Xiao Yin wanted to buy other things, then it wasn't enough.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin had heard Er Ha mention before that Luo Chuang was preparing for a big film; when the time came, would he get a chance to audition for it?</p>

    <p>As he departed, Xiao Yin took a look at the online assessments of him.</p>

    <p>Hashtag 1: <em>White skin, good looks, long legs</em></p>

    <p>This tag made Xiao Yin a little shy... what great truths people were saying so easily!</p>

    <p>Hashtag 2: <em>Little sister is really good-looking</em></p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "???"</p>

    <p>What was wrong with everyone's eyesight nowadays?! He clearly had body hair! It was just that it was white so you couldn't see it!</p>

    <p>Hashtag 3: <em>I already couldn't control myself at first sight</em></p>

    <p>Xiao Yin tsked. His mood was very complicated because he didn't know whether this tag was from a man or a woman. He hoped it wasn't a "pervert" with unsavory thoughts about him...</p>

    <p>Hm...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin looked at the comments and saw one with the hashtag that currently had the most number of likes.</p>

    <p>Hashtag 4: <em>A pity it's an airport <sup>2</sup></em></p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Basically as flat as an airport runway..)</dfn>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>
