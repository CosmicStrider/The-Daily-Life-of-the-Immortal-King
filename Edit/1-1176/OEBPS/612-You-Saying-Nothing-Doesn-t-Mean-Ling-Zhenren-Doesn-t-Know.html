  <h1>Chapter 612 You Saying Nothing Doesn't Mean Ling Zhenren Doesn't Know</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When it thought about how it had almost been unable to control the urge to piss on the Holy Pillar, Er Ha still had some lingering fear — it had actually almost become the third generation Demon Saint!</p>

    <p>Er Ha used to think that there were all sorts of benefits from becoming Demon Saint. But now it didn't seem as simple as it had thought. The lack of freedom was truly unbearable...</p>

    <p>As it departed, Er Ha felt deep sympathy for Second Generation Demon Saint. It didn't bother asking Second Generation Demon Saint why he had pissed on the Holy Pillar. Everyone had their own secrets, and it was very clear that this was a very humiliating history...</p>

    <p>Why did Second Generation Demon Saint piss on the Holy Pillar... only Second Generation Demon Saint himself knew the reason.</p>

    <p>Just as Er Ha and Zhenyuan were about to take their leave, Shen Wuyue suddenly said, "Senior Dog and Senior Immortal Zhenyuan, are you really not curious at all why Second Generation Demon Saint pissed on the Holy Pillar back then?"</p>

    <p>Blood was still gushing out of Shen Wuyue's head and the expression on his face was very enigmatic; it was the playful look of a person who was holding something in, but was clearly dying to let it out.</p>

    <p>Shen Wuyue felt that he couldn't be blamed for feeling this way. He hadn't been a big mouth to begin with - if you had to blame someone, blame the original Demon Saint! The magic array which this guy set up in the Holy Palace was really too evil - each time Shen Wuyue went to pick someone up, he had to pluck out his antlers to use their energy reserves.</p>

    <p>As time went by, Shen Wuyue started to loathe how troublesome it was. If it wasn't an important visitor, he usually wouldn't personally go down to receive them. This directly led to very few people calling at Demon Saint's Holy Palace, and Shen Wuyue burst with a lot of gossip but had no one to tell them to.</p>

    <p>Shen Wuyue felt that he would fall ill sooner or later! This characteristic simply made him a perfect match for Guo Hao and Lao Gudong!</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan: "..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Second Generation Demon Saint's expression instantly turned unsightly. He had actually recognized such a Sage Master as his adjutant. This guy had really joined the bad guys, undermining him every day!</p>

    <p>Honestly, Er Ha truly hadn't planned to ask the question. Because it was a private matter, Second Generation Demon Saint certainly wouldn't want to talk about it. But since Shen Wuyue had asked, Er Ha was a little curious...</p>

    <p>Er Ha's lips twitched. "How about... you say it?"</p>

    <p>Shen Wuyue was instantly happy, his expression like that of a Vileplume's. "Since Senior Dog has asked so sincerely, I'll be generous and tell you!"</p>

    <p>Second Generation Demon Saint: "???"</p>

    <p>Er Ha and Zhenyuan: "..."</p>

    <p>Shen Wuyue: "In fact, at that time, Second Generation Demon Saint was a petitioner."</p>

    <p>Er Ha and Zhenyuan: "Petitioner?"</p>

    <p>Shen Wuyue: "Lord Second Generation Demon Saint lived in a remote mountain village in a very small region. There were actually a lot of unfair conditions in the village, so there were frequently people who sought an audience with Demon Saint. It actually just so happened that Lord Second Generation Demon Saint was the petitioner closest to the Holy Pillar at the time. First Generation Demon Saint thought that Second Generation Demon Saint was pretty interesting, and so released his aura to scare him."</p>

    <p>"And then?"</p>

    <p>"Then nothing. Lord Second Generation Demon Saint was so scared he pissed himself at the bottom of the Holy Pillar."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>So nowadays, many seemingly glamorous careers weren't necessarily better than a normal one.</p>

    <p>Second Generation Demon Saint was a typical case. As leader of the demon world, his authority was actually undermined by his adjutant every day, but he couldn't do anything — how painful was that? So after seeing how miserable Second Generation Demon Saint constantly was, Er Ha's thoughts were clearer than ever.</p>

    <p>Now that the conflict among the four inner territories had been solved, the demon world would soon enter a time of peaceful development. This period would be an unprecedented golden era of development for the Tuntian Ha clan. Now that Elder Wen held both "Demon Saint's Decree" and the position of Secretary-General of peace in the four inner territories, anyone with a slightly discerning mind could analyze the risks involved in messing with the clan.</p>

    <p>So now, Er Ha felt it could truly and completely let the Tuntian Ha clan go.</p>

    <p>Six years. Six years after its disappearance, it could today finally settle its account with the old clan over which it had once presided as demon king.</p>

    <p>Looking at miserable Demon Saint now, Er Ha deeply felt that if it was given another opportunity again, it would never choose to take on any role like a noble or a general — it was too much work!</p>

    <p>Be it a man or a dog like Er Ha... the most important was to live a happy life!</p>

    <p>Like the volunteers and volunteer demons involved in the western development in the human world and the demon world respectively; it was indeed tough, but weren't they happy? Er Ha felt that these men or demons must feel utterly fulfilled in their hearts.</p>

    <p>Or perhaps these weren't peaceful times, and there were people or demons who carried heavy burdens as they silently moved forward...</p>

    <p>Every person and every demon had their own realms. The difference in realms determined the height of your pursuit. Sometimes, the higher you flew, the more painful the fall, so moderation was good: doing things to the best of your abilities was good enough.</p>

    <p>Er Ha stood on the top of the Holy Pillar and gazed at the clouds in front of it, deep in thought.</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan knew that Senior Dog had most likely thought of something again... Heavenly Dao was written all over its countenance!</p>

    <p>As expected of Senior Dog, it achieved enlightenment wherever it went.</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan thought that even if he cultivated for a lifetime, he wouldn't be able to reach this kind of realm.</p>

    <p>Er Ha looked at the clouds and sighed in its heart.</p>

    <p>It was time to leave. The matter of the Tuntian Ha clan had come to an end.</p>

    <p>But things weren't over yet...</p>

    <p>Long-lasting peace between the demon world and the human world was the real key to sustainable development.</p>

    <p>Take the "angler incident" which Er Ha had just learnt of today. Just as Second Generation Demon Saint had said, if the two worlds had had already established good diplomatic cooperation, they could have worked together to come up with a plan for finding this angler and determining the other party's purpose.</p>

    <p>But there was no rush for the moment.</p>

    <p>There was still Zhenyuan, who could handle it...</p>

    <p>Er Ha felt that apart from Little Master Ling, Zhenyuan was currently the only other person amazing enough among the human cultivators who could take action.</p>

    <p>"The repair works on Drought Star aren't done yet, so I plan to send a clone to investigate this angler. If I have any information, I'll definitely immediately share it with Senior Dog through the Venerated Immortal main seal!" Saying this, Zhenyuan scratched his head and smiled. "However, I feel that with any leads I find, Senior Dog will probably find them before I do. If it turns out that the leads are the same, just don't laugh at me, Senior Dog."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Then, Er Ha stamped its leg three times, and Lord Ma's golden light shrouded its body and took it back.</p>

    <p>Lord Ma sent it back to the toilet in a golden light.</p>

    <p>When it landed, Er Ha took out its phone and saw that it was five o'clock in the morning.</p>

    <p>The golden light shield on its body also disappeared the moment it landed.</p>

    <p>Walking on tiptoe, Er Ha pushed the bathroom door open and made as little noise as possible as it walked out. It was clearly a dog, but it walked like a cat, as if it was a thief...</p>

    <p>Once Er Ha had slipped completely out of the bathroom, a gaze on it made its forehead sweat instantly.</p>

    <p>Er Ha turned and saw Little Master Ling reclining on the bed, his head propped up on one hand as he stared at Er Ha.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hm...</p>

    <p>It was a very sexy pose...</p>
