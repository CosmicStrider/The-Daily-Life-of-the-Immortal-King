  <h1>Chapter 99 Devil Emperor Gua Pi's Weakness </h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Bloody hell?! The stone ghost mask?" On the other side, when Lord Diulei saw the image Wang Ling had sent him, his expression changed and his hands were swift as the wind as he sent several sigh and rage emojis. "Brother Ling, you're too much! You actually went looking for this stone ghost mask behind my back — how could you not ask me to come with you for something so interesting?"</p>

    <p>Seeing Lord Diulei's reply, Wang Ling's heart was instantly at ease; it was very obvious that the other man clearly knew about the stone ghost mask's specific history.</p>

    <p>"Has Brother Ling verified what this stone ghost mask is made from?" Lord Diulei asked before Wang Ling could ask his own question.</p>

    <p>His reply was a short few words. "Primordial black crystal."</p>

    <p>"Right! This is definitely the stone ghost mask!" Lord Diulei seemed particularly excited. "The legendary stone ghost mask is made from primordial black crystal! Where did Brother Ling get this mask from?"</p>

    <p>"Online shopping," Wang Ling answered honestly.</p>

    <p>Uh...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was stupefied for a moment, completely unable to believe this fact...</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, you and I have been brothers for so many years, please tell me the truth... who on earth is this 'online' that you speak of?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling replied seriously, "Internet..."</p>

    <p>This time, Lord Diulei rubbed his eyes to ensure that he hadn't misread Wang Ling's message reply, then he instantly clutched at his liver and kidneys, feeling like he really needed to take two bottles of Liuwei Dihuang pills <sup>1</sup> in order to recover.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is a well-known Chinese herbal formula used to treat yin deficiency.)</dfn>

    <p>...God fucking damn, online shopping!</p>

    <p>Online sellers were so powerful these days that even a forbidden magic object could actually be casually found online!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei couldn't be any more shocked. "Brother Ling... do you know how many people are looking for this stone ghost mask right now?"</p>

    <p>Then, he used quite a few minutes to calm himself down.</p>

    <p>"Back then, after the rumor leaked out that Devil Emperor Gua Pi had been sealed away, grandmasters with Nascent Soul realms and above brought whatever power they had to bear in their search for this mask. There is a rumor that whoever inherits the mask will obtain Devil Emperor Gua Pi's legacy and supreme spells... although these rumors have been denounced, from all my years of investigation, I can say that seventy percent of them are true. This magic object has really caused too much of a stir!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling typed an ellipsis. "..."</p>

    <p>Because it was suspicious no matter how he looked at it. Leaving aside the fact that the legacy had to be inherited through one of the Three Thousand Great Spells, the "Great Blood Origin Spell," Wang Ling thought that even if Devil Emperor Gua Pi really did know how to use it, inheriting legacy through it was complete nonsense.</p>

    <p>There were many conditions for the use of the "Great Blood Origin Spell." One of the most stringent requirements for perfect transference was a compatible blood match, like for a bone marrow transplant in medicine. Wang Ling felt that it was utter nonsense to be able to find an absolutely perfect match in the vast sea of people that existed today.</p>

    <p>At this point, it went back to the problem of the lesser natures of cultivators. Namely, even though they knew that they weren't a match, they still decided to take the chance to try and obtain more power in a short period of time...</p>

    <p>Senior cultivators always said that in cultivation, one should rely on their own efforts and take it step by step. Wang Ling couldn't agree more with this remark — it could be said that he was one of those whom, because of the excessive growth of his realm, had fallen victim to an unsteady foundation and thus couldn't control his strength precisely.</p>

    <p>Thus, the most likely consequence of someone forcefully inheriting a legacy was that they would experience an inner deviation and eventually lose all their cultivation and become crippled.</p>

    <p>This was an excruciatingly painful and incredibly risky process. The nation had always maintained a strict ban on the use of the "Great Blood Origin Spell" since it offered the body no advantage whatsoever. Wang Ling really didn't get why there were still mule-headed people willing to try it.</p>

    <p>At the very least, he felt that this stone ghost mask had nothing to do with inheriting legacy at all, and instead was very likely to be a trap which had been left behind by Devil Emperor Gua Pi.</p>

    <p>In fact, it was not just Wang Ling who thought so. Lord Diulei also expressed his own concerns.</p>

    <p>They got down to business.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei brought the subject back to Devil Emperor Gua Pi. "Brother Ling, do you know the reason why Devil Emperor Gua Pi vanished back then?"</p>

    <p>When he heard the other man's question, Wang Ling was silent for a second. Lao Gudong had just gossiped about this during the theory of history lesson, so it was fresh in his memory.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei continued, "I'm sure Brother Ling knows that back then, Devil Emperor Gua Pi's first true disciple was Immortal She Pi. In the outside world, most of the rumors are that Immortal She Pi sealed his own wounded <em>shifu </em>away in order to seize power. But in fact, that wasn't the case. I heard through the grapevine that this master and disciple had a very good relationship."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei said enthusiastically, "Actually, during that time, Devil Emperor Gua Pi had been researching how to undo the Great Evil Containment Wave..."</p>

    <p>Looking at the text in the chat window, Wang Ling couldn't help raising his eyebrows, because not only had he heard of this spell, he had used it before himself.</p>

    <p>This was a spell that, through specialized research, had been invented to be used against villains, evil spirits, devious sects and so forth, and was one of the Three Thousand Great Spells.</p>

    <p>"This Great Evil Containment Wave had always been a thorn in his side, so Devil Emperor Gua Pi had been deeply engrossed in studying how to crack it. After decades of research, it seemed that he had found the answer. And so, he asked his disciple Immortal She Pi to use the Great Evil Containment Wave on him in order to confirm the effectiveness of the spell..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was listening very intently. "Then what?"</p>

    <p>"Then? There was nothing..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei sent a shrug emoji. "In the end, Devil Emperor Gua Pi was sealed inside the stone ghost mask. Furthermore, he had never found a chance to escape after that."</p>

    <p>After hearing the whole story, Wang Ling truly couldn't be bothered to even make fun of it. "..."</p>

    <p>"So I've been running around over the years looking for this stone ghost mask. This thing is a magic weapon that must be taken seriously. It would be a disaster if it fell into the wrong hands. In theory, the stone ghost mask is not a true magic weapon... but with Devil Emperor Gua Pi sealed inside, he's now like a weapon spirit," said Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>For this magnificent first-generation devil to fall to this level... he felt that there really wasn't anyone else like Devil Emperor Gua Pi this <em>gua pi <sup>2</sup> </em>in the whole world.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(A reminder that colloquially, calling someone 'gua pi' is to say that they are stupid ..)</dfn>

    <p>Of course, if you really wanted to find some <em>gua pi </em>with the same stupid nature, he thought that Er Ha, who had been a demon king, would definitely be at the top of the list.</p>

    <p>After listening to Lord Diulei's explanation, most of Wang Ling's suspicions about the stone ghost mask had already been clarified. The one thing still left unexplained was whether the mask was one of a pair of twin magic objects.</p>

    <p>After seeing the message which Wang Ling had sent to him, Lord Diulei couldn't help but nod. "That is just like Brother Ling! You can even think of the possibility of twin magic weapons! In fact, I already had doubts early on... think about it, so many people look for the stone ghost mask every year, but no one has ever clearly tracked down Devil Emperor's aura. Why on earth is that the case? But if we follow Brother Ling's way of thinking, then everything makes sense. I also feel that the stone ghost mask which Brother Ling has is probably just a replica, and the original has definitely been hidden away. But to be absolutely sure, I think I should take a look for myself first. So, Brother Ling, when can we arrange to meet?"</p>

    <p>Meet?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling wanted to refuse at first.</p>

    <p>But when he considered this matter of the stone ghost mask, he thought carefully for a moment, then as usual, replied with a brief few words. "Meet at the Wang family's villa" <em>...</em></p>
