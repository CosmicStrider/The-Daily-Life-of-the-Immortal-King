  <h1>Chapter 991 The Office of Strategic Deception's Investigation Team</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"You're talking about the defense base on Mixiu's border, aren't you?" The head of state's virtual projection had a deep look on his face. He was, of course, aware of the destruction of the border defense base by a mysterious force. It had happened a few days ago, and Mixiu's head of state had yet to make heads or tails of it. Various other countries had thought it was a joke at first; no one expected the worldwide operation that was launched not long after that.</p>

    <p>"That's right," President Qi said. "In my view, now isn't a good time for the government to take action in this matter."</p>

    <p>"Go on." The head of state looked at President Qi.</p>

    <p>"As a government authority, Huaxiu Alliance may be able to lend assistance and lead, but if we directly take action, this might look like we're showing the other side our weakness. It's not just our Huaxiu Alliance - in my opinion, Mixiu Alliance, Yingxiu Alliance and the cultivator alliance in every other country should be a little more prudent and stay calm; only then will we be able to draw the other side out. Looking at the current outcome, however, I'm afraid that it'll be very hard for the other cultivation countries to respond calmly..."</p>

    <p>The head of state nodded and asked, "Then what is your plan, Old Qi?"</p>

    <p>President Qi replied, "In my view, we can get the Office of Strategic Deception directly involved and have them carry out an investigation. Huaxiu Alliance invested a lot in the construction of the Office of Strategic Deception. Now that we need a hand, I believe Chief Thunder won't have any objections."</p>

    <p>"Then let's do that first."</p>

    <p>The head of state stood up. "Send out the document right away and order the Office of Strategic Deception to set up a special investigation team - they must solve this case as soon as possible."</p>

    <p>"Yes." President Qi and the Ten Generals around him bowed.</p>

    <p>Everyone left after the meeting adjourned.</p>

    <p>Leaning back in his chair, General Yi seemed to have already fallen asleep.</p>

    <p>"When did Old Yi get into the habit of sleeping in meetings... the head of state didn't say anything either," Medicine Saint President Luo said with a wry smile.</p>

    <p>"Go easy on him; Old Yi might be retired on the surface, but he's gotten used to the 996-working hours system over the years, and is still busy handling all kinds of matters privately. I'm going to draw up the papers; I'll wake him up when I leave," President Qi replied.</p>

    <p>"Then we'll have to trouble you, Old Qi." President Luo sighed helplessly, then summoned a large whale-shaped gourd and left.</p>

    <p>This was an air kun gourd, which was President Luo's exclusive mode of transport.</p>

    <p>It was also a top-notch spatial holy artifact, with an inner space so large it could swallow all living things.</p>

    <p>After years of refinement by President Luo, the interior space of this magic artifact had already transformed from a small world into a big one. In the world inside the gourd, President Luo was just like the creator god.</p>

    <p>"Take care, Sis Luo." President Qi saw her off at the door and watched her leave.</p>

    <p>Not long after President Luo left, General Yi, who had been pretending to be asleep, suddenly opened his eyes.</p>

    <p>General Yi: "Alright, Old Qi, what do you want?"</p>

    <p>Before the meeting broke up, President Qi had used a few tricks to get General Yi to stay back.</p>

    <p>President Qi didn't beat around the bush. "In addition to the Office of Strategic Deception's investigation, I might also need your help, Old Yi."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean?" General Yi narrowed his eyes.</p>

    <p>"I need you to find the spies hiding in our midst; you're the only one who can do this," President Qi said. "Your clear sword heart can distinguish right from wrong, good from evil. You cultivate Boundless Sword Dao, and so your body is brimming with overwhelming upright energy; this is something that no one else can match."</p>

    <p>"You and I both know very well that our opponent this time isn't an ordinary person... My sword heart may be clear, but it's not necessarily useful."</p>

    <p>General Yi got up, his face a little solemn. "But now, it seems I can only try."</p>

    <p>"I already checked out some things; Old Yi, you can start with this." Then, President Qi took out a jade scroll which he handed to General Yi.</p>

    <p>"This is?"</p>

    <p>"Immortal She Pi's case file from back then; it has all the names of the people who were involved in the original case."</p>

    <p>Taking the jade scroll, General Yi's expression changed again as he couldn't help recalling things from long, long ago.</p>

    <p>They played non-stop in his mind like an old film reel.</p>

    <p>The national terrorist incident this time was actually related to Immortal She Pi's case back then...</p>

    <p>General Yi suddenly had a vague sense of apprehension.</p>

    <p>He felt that something big was about to happen.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Shortly after the Huaxiu Alliance meeting, a document stamped with Huaxiu Alliance's seal and signed by the Ten Generals was sent directly to Zhuo Yi, leader of the Office of Strategic Deception's supervisory and investigation team.</p>

    <p>The higher-ups had charged the Office of Strategic Deception to set up a special investigation team, which caused the entire sect to immediately become highly focused.</p>

    <p>That very day, Lord Diulei held an emergency meeting and all the team leaders gathered in the conference hall.</p>

    <p>During the roll call, Lord Diulei noticed that two people were absent: one was Fang Xing, leader of the goon squad, and the other was Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"This is an important issue, why didn't Brother Ling respond?" Lord Diulei didn't understand.</p>

    <p>" <em>Shifu </em>and Student Fang may be catching up on homework." Zhuo Yi laughed.</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>This was a reasonable and irrefutable reply...</p>

    <p>In Ling Zhenren's eyes, catching up on homework was indeed more important than the current situation.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling not showing up was one thing, but even Fang Xing wasn't here. This gave Lord Diulei the vague sense that something wasn't right. Student Fang Xing had always been a very polite person. Even if he couldn't be here today, he would have sent a message in the group to let them know. But now, it was as if Student Fang Xing had vanished from the world without a single word.</p>

    <p>"Did something happen..." Lord Diulei felt that something wasn't right.</p>

    <p>But just then, a figure appeared at the door to the conference hall.</p>

    <p>It was a very beautiful girl with long hair, though her expression was very cold and dark.</p>

    <p>"Miss, we're about to have a meeting; this place isn't part of the tour," Dharmaraja looked up and said.</p>

    <p>This girl glared at Dharmaraja, directly sat down in a chair, and then put up her two beautiful legs on the table and crossed them. "I'm Fang Xing."</p>

    <p>"Stu- Student Fang?" Everyone was flabbergasted.</p>

    <p>If Fang Xing hadn't said anything, they would have thought nothing of it. Suddenly asserting her identity now, however, instantly made everyone feel that the girl's appearance did seem familiar... This indeed seemed to be what Fang Xing looked like in his female form...</p>

    <p>Because Student Fang Xing took a male form in his daily life, no one expected this person to actually be Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>"Is it an impersonator?" Zhuo Yi also felt it was a little strange.</p>

    <p>"From her aura, it is indeed Student Fang Xing..." Lord Diulei was also utterly astonished.</p>

    <p>But that wasn't all...</p>

    <p>Not long after Fang Xing sat down, another familiar teenager appeared at the door to the conference hall.</p>

    <p>Both Lord Diulei and Zhuo Yi rubbed their eyes in disbelief.</p>

    <p>" <em>Shifu </em>?" Zhuo Yi called out tentatively.</p>

    <p>"No need to greet me. I saw the news just now, and came over especially for the meeting. How can homework be more important than this?" The young man directly waved his hand at Zhuo Yi and then immediately went up to Fang Xing and sat down next to her.</p>

    <p>This...</p>

    <p>Wait a minute!</p>

    <p>Ling Zhenren opened his mouth to talk???</p>

    <p>Everyone turned pale with shock.</p>

    <p>"Why are all of you looking at me so strangely? Thunder? Why haven't you started the meeting? Hurry up and start! I can't wait!" Wang Ling's mouth was like a machine gun.</p>

    <p>"Someone pretending to be Ling Zhenren?" Dharmaraja was dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>"No... Judging from his aura, it really is Ling Zhenren himself." Cailian Zhenren also found it a little unbelievable.</p>

    <p>Could someone tell them: why did the generally quiet Ling Zhenren suddenly turn into a chatterbox?!</p>

    <p>"Brother Zhuo, what's going on..." Lord Diulei was somewhat stupefied.</p>

    <p>"I don't know either..." Zhuo Yi was also a little befuddled.</p>

    <p>He then rubbed his eyes and stared hard at his <em>shifu </em>Wang Ling, who was completely unlike his ordinary self.</p>

    <p>Just then, Wang Ling blinked, and a pair of beautiful and devastating double eyelids appeared under everyone's gazes...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "???"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "???"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "???"</p>
