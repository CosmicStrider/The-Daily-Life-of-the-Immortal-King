  <h1>Chapter 70 A Spirit Sword Is Like Its Master </h1>

  <div>

      

      <p>Using "Cultivator's Rift" as a test point this time in revising the content of the spirit sword exchange meet was the result of a joint collaboration between Chen Tianxiang and Jin Muyan these two silly brothers. The rest of the teachers had all been in the dark about it and they had only received the notification two hours before the spirit sword exchange meet.</p>

      <p>The two headmasters hadn't expected that this spirit sword refinement trial version would be so successful. Various kinds of functional magic artifacts continuously emerged, which made the spirit sword exchange meet much more interesting. All the students in the audience were glued to the broadcast screen and not a single person had dozed off. In previous years, halfway through the meet, the students would begin to prop their heads up in their hands like theThinker <sup>1</sup> .</p>

      <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The Thinker is a sculpture most well-known for its pose, as a man sitting in deep thought with his chin resting on one hand. You can check out one version at http://www.musee-rodin.fr/en/collections/sculptures/thinker)</dfn>

      <p>But having said that, some unexpected things had still occurred.</p>

      <p>The spirit sword refinement process this time was in the end still a trial version. There were many imbalances in battle; once a side gained an advantage, the other side was very likely to be left utterly defenseless.</p>

      <p>This resulted in a particular scenario...</p>

      <p>That was, before most people needed to properly build a spirit sword, they could already very likely use the blank sword and great magic sword alone to end the competition.</p>

      <p>...God, how the fuck could there be no spirit swords in a spirit sword exchange meet!</p>

      <p>The two silly brothers who were just realizing this now were instantly aware of how embarrassing this would be.</p>

      <p>All the students carried spirit swords — how could they not be given the opportunity to show themselves off?</p>

      <p>But the competition was already over!</p>

      <p>When Wang Ling came out of the virtual space with the rest of his chums, he heard the two headmasters on the stage communicating telepathically in a constant back-and-forth.</p>

      <p>"Senior brother... you should hurry up and think of something."</p>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p>Headmaster Jin covered his face. "A spirit sword exchange meet without spirit swords — if word of this gets out, I don't want to live anymore!"</p>

      <p>"Junior brother, calm down!" Chen Tianxiang knew that once this junior brother worked himself into an extremely agitated state, the maiden heart sealed in his body would overflow non-stop. For the sake of Seven Stars Sect's reputation, and considering that the eyes of teachers and students from both schools were on them, Chen Tianxiang's brain cells spun at an extreme speed of one hundred and eighty revolutions per minute.</p>

      <p>Shortly after that, Headmaster Chen said in a deep voice, "Deputy Director Zhuo still has a spirit sword performance segment later, how about we have him choose one of the students' spirit swords to perform the Hundred Steps Flying Sword?"</p>

      <p>Headmaster Jin's complexion instantly returned to normal. "Senior brother, smart!"</p>

      <p>Headmaster Chen: "..."</p>

      <p>Wang Ling couldn't help twitching his lips. "..."</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>On the stage, Zhuo Yi stared at the ten spirit swords laid out on the table in a cold sweat.</p>

      <p>Honestly speaking, this was a much better outcome than Zhuo Yi could have imagined; he didn't know the Sky-Parting Sword, but he could handle the Hundred Steps Flying Sword. Whether the performance ended smoothly or not would depend entirely on the tacit understanding between Zhuo Yi and the spirit sword he would be using.</p>

      <p>Because all these swords already had their own masters, for them to completely obey a stranger would be a great test of Zhuo Yi's swordsmanship and a certain level of spirit...</p>

      <p>As Deputy Director of the General Administration of 100 Schools, it would be a real disgrace if he made a mistake in this segment!</p>

      <p>"Who would have thought the contest rules would be changed, I wanted the chance to show off my Wangmeng and Wangji..." Sitting below the stage, Lin Xiaoyu sighed.</p>

      <p>"It seems Xiaoyu's swordsmanship has improved tremendously!" Sun Rong smiled.</p>

      <p>"That's right! After Lao Gudong showed me that book <em>Founder of Evil Sorcery </em>, it was like I was in a dream, and I realized the true meaning of parent and child swords!"</p>

      <p>"What true meaning?" Guo Hao raised an eyebrow.</p>

      <p>"Two bitches together, invincible in all of the world!"</p>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p>"I wonder... whose spirit sword will Senior Zhuo choose?"</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>Zhuo Yi's eyes flicked back and forth over the ten spirit swords. Sun Rong's sword Mysterious Sea had already spawned a sword spirit... it would be impossible for him to control it within a short period of time. As for Lin Xiaoyu's parent and child swords, he didn't even want to touch them. It was difficult enough trying to handle one unfamiliar sword, these parent and child swords would be enough to kill him...</p>

      <p>The rest of the spirit swords: Chen Chao's Lichao, Guo Hao's Ghost Tooth, Tang Jingze's Blue Blood, Fang Huaqing's Zhanpo, and the Climbing Dragon series belonging to the three young masters of the Liang family...</p>

      <p>Wang Ling's eyes followed Zhuo Yi's gaze.</p>

      <p>It was a one in ten chance, he wouldn't choose Jingke, right?</p>

      <p>Then, Zhuo Yi picked up the only small wooden sword on the stage. "It'll be you!"</p>

      <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

      <p>Zhuo Yi naturally had his own reasons for choosing Jingke.</p>

      <p>First of all, this sword seemed the most harmless and wasn't likely to pose any threat; it looked like it would be very easy to handle...</p>

      <p>Second, the master of this sword was Wang Ling.</p>

      <p>Zhuo Yi felt that this was a sign...</p>

      <p>Holding Jingke, he was determined to perform well! <em>If I can do well using </em>shifu <em>'s spirit sword, I might be able to please him!</em></p>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p><em>Fucking please your sister! Also! Who the fuck is your </em>shifu <em>?! Don't forcibly make me your </em>shifu <em>!</em></p>

      <p>Head hurting, Wang Ling rubbed the skin between his eyebrows. He could now only hope that Jingke would be able to hold back its strength in the hands of a stranger... under no circumstance could it be allowed to go wild. Otherwise, with one wave of this sword, everyone here would have to move to another city to live in.</p>

      <p>Although this sounded like an exaggeration, it was truly an indisputable fact.</p>

      <p>Jingke was indeed a small wooden sword... but its lethality was undeniable.</p>

      <p>When Wang Ling had entered the Gate Between Worlds to save Old Li, he had used Jingke to cut off the head of a demon god. Soaked in the blood of the demon god, Jingke underwent unprecedented and powerful refinement. It was also since that time that Jingke, like Wang Ling, could no longer suppress the prehistoric powers in its body.</p>

      <p>It wasn't unreasonable to say that a spirit sword was like its master...</p>

      <p>"And now, let us invite the Deputy Director of the General Administration of 100 Schools, Teacher Zhuo Yi, to bring everyone a wonderful performance of the Hundred Steps Flying Sword!" Seeing that Zhuo Yi had selected a spirit sword, the female host gave a resounding shout.</p>

      <p>With Jingke in hand, Zhuo Yi slowly walked to the center of the sports field accompanied by thunderous applause...</p>

      <p>On the stage, Sun Dakang frowned. "The owner of this sword, is it that Student Wang Ling?"</p>

      <p>Beside him, Headmaster Chen didn't know why the old Secretary had suddenly asked this question, but nonetheless replied, "Yes, it's Wang Ling. Student Wang Ling was born into a relatively poor family and our school is prepared to organize a home visit and to raise money to help him."</p>

      <p>The old Secretary nodded with satisfaction. "Well done. However poor we are, we should never be poor in the education of our children. Each and every student should feel care and concern from the school and society; only then will their spirits grow in good health."</p>

      <p>Next to him, the headmasters of the two schools, the directors and the teachers leading the student teams couldn't help nodding. "Secretary Sun is quite right!"</p>

      <p>"Well, comrades, it has been hard on you. It should be common practice for everyone to show more care and concern for those students who are not so well off." As the old Secretary was speaking, he still couldn't help but stare at the peach wood sword in Zhuo Yi's hands.</p>

      <p>Was he mistaken?</p>

      <p>For some reason, he felt that this sword... seemed a little unusual.</p>
