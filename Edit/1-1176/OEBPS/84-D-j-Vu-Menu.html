  <h1>Chapter 84 Déjà Vu Menu </h1>

  <div>

    <p>After retiring, Grandfather Wang had rented a piece of farmland, and had vowed to serve the common people by devoting himself to researching new varieties of vegetables. Unfortunately, because of dementia, he would constantly forget his research results. Finally accepting this reality, Grandfather Wang gave up on his earlier dream, and started to plant simple fruits and vegetables instead. Almost every month he would send some to the Wang family's small villa.</p>

    <p>This time, when he had heard that his good grandson had participated in a school activity, Grandfather Wang had picked oranges non-stop, as they had been Wang Ling's favorite when he was a kid, before coming here, but in the end had still made a confused mistake when loading the oranges into the tricycle cart.</p>

    <p>For dinner, the old man's craftsmanship from years of being a star chef was on display.</p>

    <p>Appetizers: cold old tomatoes <sup>1</sup> and Elizabeth potatoes <sup>2</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Old Tomato is the pseudonym of a popular Chinese games blogger.)</dfn>
    
    <br/>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is a reference to another well-known Chinese blogger whose Chinese pseudonym translates to Elizabeth Mouse, but who also goes by Little White Mouse - in Chinese, 'potato' and 'mouse' are homophones.)</dfn>

    <p>Mains: pure black combat chicken <sup>3</sup> , er gen with sauce, and do mi <sup>4</sup> wintermelon soup...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(The ayam cemani is a pure black Indonesian chicken breed.)</dfn>
    
    <br/>
    
    <dfn><sup>4</sup>('Do Mi' is a magical incantation used in the Chinese TV series 'Dancing Baby: DoFaLa.')</dfn>

    <p>Dessert: angry bananas...</p>

    <p>As the old man solemnly announced the name of each dish, Wang Ling could basically confirm who the old man's shifu was... and even if it wasn't Mother Juan, it was definitely someone connected to her!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Previously, whenever the old man came to visit the Wang family, most of the time, he would leave early the next morning on his little tricycle. This time at dinner, however, Father Wang adamantly insisted that the old man stay for a few more days. The reason was very simple... the old man's dementia had reached a point where it had to be treated... he had unexpectedly forgotten to add in salt while cooking!</p>

    <p>Even the old man had been thoroughly annoyed by this; he had just said before that even if he forgot everyone, he wouldn't forget how to cook... who knew that in the end, he had to eat his own words.</p>

    <p>It was very clear that the old man's dementia was already terminal. Last month, Father Wang in fact had taken the old man to the hospital. The doctor had said that the old man's dementia was a very unique case, and couldn't be treated with just medication. A mental illness needed mental treatment.</p>

    <p>Hence, Father Wang had Grandfather Wang stay back this time, and planned to look for an excellent psychologist to give the old man comprehensive psychological counseling.</p>

    <p>Then...</p>

    <p>The next morning on Sunday, there was yet another visitor to the Wang family's small villa... Lie Mengmeng had come.</p>

    <p>Facing Grandfather Wang, Lie Mengmeng took a deep breath, his frail body shaking slightly, then he gave Father Wang a deep look: "The matter of life and death you were telling me about... is this?"</p>

    <p>"Didn't you major in psychology at university? Furthermore, you were even one of Professor Jiang's postgraduate students," Father Wang said.</p>

    <p>"...But it's already been a long time since I last saw patients." No one could blame Lie Mengmeng. There were plenty of psychologists in the current market, but most of them were part-timers, because not only didn't this job make them enough to eat in the cultivation era, it was also a high-risk career. There had been quite a number of psychologists who had been killed with swords, by patients screaming that they weren't sick.</p>
    
    <p>Hence, after Lie Mengmeng graduated from university, he switched to becoming an editor. At the very least, this job didn't need him to show up regularly, and he could make money just by sitting around, like Aoi Sola<sup>5</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>5</sup>(Aoi Sola is a Japanese talent who started out as an AV idol and has a sizeable following in China ..)</dfn>

    <p>Nearby, Mother Wang came to his rescue: "How about... we just forget it? This is too difficult for Little Song."</p>

    <p>Father Wang shamelessly turned away: "I don't care! You have to take a look today, even if you don't want to. Otherwise... I'll stop updating! Quit the website!"</p>

    <p>"Don't!"</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng was about to cry, his eyes full of tears: "I'll take a look! I'll do it, alright?!"</p>

    <p>Despite having left psychology behind for many years, Lie Mengmeng still had some understanding of the concept of dementia. But because Grandfather Wang's case was more unique, as his dementia was caused by mental illness, after some consideration, Lie Mengmeng decided to ask him a few questions to assess how far the old man's dementia had progressed...</p>

    <p>"My name is Song Zikai. Grandfather Wang, you can call me Little Song," Lie Mengmeng said, looking at Grandfather Wang.</p>

    <p>The old man didn't know who Lie Mengmeng was, but knew that this was the psychologist whom Father Wang had invited for his benefit, so he was still a little nervous. He couldn't help that his hands shook, even just at hearing Lie Mengmeng this soft and meng person speak.</p>

    <p>"Grandfather Wang, don't be nervous. I'm going to ask you a few simple questions."</p>

    <p>The old man paused: "That... Little Song ah , can I first ask you a question?"</p>

    <p>"Mmm Grandfather Wang, ask ba ." Lie Mengmeng nodded.</p>

    <p>Grandfather Wang: "They all say that my dementia is very serious, is that true?"</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng: "I'll only know after I've asked you a few questions."</p>

    <p>Grandfather Wang: "I have another question..."</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng: "Grandfather Wang, say it..."</p>

    <p>Grandfather Wang: "They all say that my dementia is very serious, is that true?"</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng, Father Wang, and Mother Wang: "..."</p>

    <p>Okay! No need to ask anymore, this wasn't just serious... it was fucking incurable!</p>

    <p>Upstairs, Wang Ling couldn't help covering his face, and at the same time, he sighed deeply in his heart... for some reason, he felt that Lie Mengmeng might go crazy before Grandfather Wang could be cured.</p>

    <p>In the end, Father Wang made Lie Mengmeng stay back for lunch to eat the food which Grandfather Wang had forgotten to add salt to before leaving. As he was about to leave, the old man saw Lie Mengmeng off at the door, and grasped his hands firmly: "I have really troubled Doctor Song!"</p>

    <p>"Grandfather, it's no problem..." When they had been eating, the old man had kept asking the same question, and Lie Mengmeng hadn't fully recovered from the experience yet.</p>

    <p>"How's my dad?" Father Wang dragged Lie Mengmeng aside to ask him.</p>

    <p>"I just took some simple notes earlier. Grandfather Wang's case is rather complicated, and there are some details I need to confirm with my teacher..." What Lie Mengmeng was saying were all empty words. Since graduation, apart from sending broadcast messages during the New Year and other festivals, it had in fact been a very long time since he had last seen Professor Jiang. Who the hell knew if Professor Jiang still remembered him, this student?</p>

    <p>"Then I really will have to trouble you!" Father Wang said.</p>

    <p>"If you really want to thank me, hurry up and update more!" Lie Mengmeng rolled his eyes and said grouchily.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Today, the Wang family's small villa seemed particularly busy. As soon as Lie Mengmeng left, a young man with a solemn face and wearing a black suit showed up at the front door of the villa, holding a small box.</p>

    <p>It was an employee from Shun Feng God Express. Wang Ling had sensed the courier's presence from afar, and had already been waiting for him at the door.</p>

    <p>When the man saw the recipient, he immediately handed the delivery over to Wang Ling with both hands, and bowed respectfully: "Shun Feng God Express! Mission accomplished guarantee! Sir, please be sure to give me a five-star comment!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling lowered his head, very quiet, and just signed his name.</p>

    <p>The man took out a grading device from his suit pocket: "Based on Sir's consumer preferences, if you leave a five-star comment now, you will instantly receive ten packets of Small Raccoon Crispy Noodle Snacks!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's eyes lit up at once.</p>
