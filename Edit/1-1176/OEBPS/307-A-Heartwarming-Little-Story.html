  <h1>Chapter 307 A Heartwarming Little Story </h1>

  <div>

    <p>There was no rush at the moment. Including the Heavenly Materials sword, the one thousand spirit swords in the intrinsic spirit field belonging to Cheng Yu, Master of Immortal Mansion, were all under Jingke's control now.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought about leaving the Heavenly Materials sword with Luo Chuang for him to study, while the rest of the swords could be handed over to the government.</p>

    <p>He felt that this sword was made out of very special materials... very likely it wasn't as simple as he imagined.</p>

    <p>As everyone had expected, there were a lot of strange magic treasures in Cheng Yu's Another Space Inside, and they were no less inferior to the items that had been strewn on the ground after General Yi had captured the old devil, whether in quantity or quality. In addition, many of these treasures, according to Lord Diulei's search of the Department of Cultural Heritage's official website, were national magic treasures that had been lost previously.</p>

    <p>National magic treasures weren't called as such based purely on a measure of their strength. Every national magic treasure had a touching story which promoted traditional societal virtues.</p>

    <p>Among the magic treasures that Cheng Yu had collected, the most highly rated national magic treasure was in fact a delicate matchbox.</p>

    <p>"What's this?" Everyone was startled by this matchbox.</p>

    <p>When Dharmaraja opened it, he found that it no longer contained any matches. The whole matchbox was exquisite; made out of spirit wood, its four sides were inlaid with metal decorations. It was simply a masterpiece.</p>

    <p>Staring at the matchbox, Lord Diulei suddenly asked, "Have you heard the story The Little Match That Sold Girls ?"</p>

    <p>Everyone was suddenly enlightened. Oh... it was the story The Little Match Girl ...</p>

    <p>Wait a minute!</p>

    <p>It seemed that what Lord Diulei had said just now was The Little Match ... That Sold Girls ?</p>

    <p>Fuck! What the hell was that?</p>

    <p>"This is a true story from the past about a match that attained awareness and sold little girls on the street on Thanksgiving Day. It aroused plenty of public indignation at the time," Lord Diulei said with a sigh.</p>

    <p>Someone asked, "What happened after that?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "This little match which had kidnapped girls to be sold was burned to death in the streets."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei pressed the matchbox between his fingers. "Thus, this matchbox was actually made by a skilled craftsman back then as a warning to society to care for children and to condemn human trafficking! Condemn child abuse!"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Shivering as he knelt on the ground, Cheng Yu felt his blood run cold when he heard this story.</p>

    <p>The matchbox had been part of his plunder when he had attacked some other dark force before. He didn't know its origins, but it had helped him get through a lot of difficult times. He remembered how he would stay in the matchbox for stretches of time in order to hide from his enemies during his most difficult periods.</p>

    <p>"Oh, that's right!" Lord Diulei suddenly recalled something. "This matchbox actually has a storage function, but it wasn't originally designed to be a storage space."</p>

    <p>As he spoke, he injected spirit energy into the matchbox. In a flash, this small matchbox suddenly grew into a large, rectangular storage space which could fully accommodate a person.</p>

    <p>"So, this matchbox was designed for..."</p>

    <p>"This is the special coffin that the craftsman made for the match goblin," said Lord Diulei, his chin in his hand.</p>

    <p>Cheng Yu: "..."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, it was ten o'clock at night in the outside world.</p>

    <p>About two hours ago, the cultivation police station on Sanyuan Road of Winter city had received reports from the public about a broken space.</p>

    <p>There were police cars already swarming around the previously empty Sanyuan Road. The police had set up a wide cordon outside, with the space passage which Wang Ling had blasted open with the strength of his Heavenly Eye at the center.</p>

    <p>A group of police officers were standing more than ten meters away from the broken spatial wall, which was emitting such strong energy fluctuations that no one dared get close.</p>

    <p>"Has the bomb squad arrived yet?" Chief Yu of the police department had already arrived on the scene and was directing the operation.</p>

    <p>"They're on the road," a young police officer reported. He was only at the Golden Core stage, and completely didn't dare approach the broken spatial wall. The energy inside was so fierce that he felt he would be torn apart by its raging spirit intensity if he got any closer!</p>

    <p>In the distance, a black commercial car was stopped by police at the intersection. Seeing the azure government license plate, the police officer hurriedly went up to the driver's window and saluted respectfully. "Comrade, there's been an accident up ahead. Please take a detour."</p>

    <p>Zhao Kai rolled down the window and poked his head outside. "Brother, can I ask, what's happened?"</p>

    <p>The police officer replied in a low voice, "We received reports two hours ago that there's a broken spatial wall up ahead. The spirit intensity inside the spatial wall right now is so dense that no one dares approach it. The bomb squad will be here soon."</p>

    <p>"Okay, thank you, brother!"</p>

    <p>Zhao Kai then closed the window and turned to Zhuo Yi behind him. " Shifu , what now?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi touched his chin and looked at him. "Are you sure this is where you dropped off Ling Zhenren and the others?"</p>

    <p>Zhao Kai nodded abruptly like a chicken pecking rice. "It's definitely here, there's no mistake, shifu !"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi folded his arms, and his face darkened instantly. "..." It's a no-brainer then â€” it was definitely your shiye <sup>1</sup> that destroyed this spatial wall!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Basically shifu's master..)</dfn>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was well aware, however, that there was always a reason behind every move his shifu made! He seemed to have heard Lord Diulei mention before an incident related to the dark force powerhouse Immortal Mansion. Hence, Zhuo Yi speculated that the reason shifu Ling Zhenren had come to Winter city this time had to do with this.</p>

    <p>To sum up, he speculated that there were two possible scenarios.</p>

    <p>First, shifu had blasted through the spatial wall into the world inside, but things hadn't been resolved, so he hadn't come out yet. This was the most likely scenario.</p>

    <p>Second, shifu had run into trouble and so was unable to come out. Of course, Zhuo Yi felt that the probability of this happening was one in ten thousand... It was almost impossible.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the situation was already very clear. He had to find a way to delay the police and block any information from being leaked and picked up by the media until shifu and the others were completely clear of Winter city.</p>

    <p>After thinking this, Zhuo Yi waved his hand for Zhao Kai to roll down the car window.</p>

    <p>The police uncle was still standing by the car. "What else can I do for you, comrade?"</p>

    <p>Zhao Kai grinned and looked at the police officer. "Our leader is very interested in this incident, perhaps he might be able to help you. We will have to trouble brother to let your chief know."</p>

    <p>"Leader? Which leader..." The police uncle's expression became tense, and he bent down very carefully to give the backseat of the car a look out of the corner of his eye. When he saw Zhuo Yi's face, he immediately broke out in a cold sweat.</p>

    <p>It was impossible for him not to know about Secretary Dakang's favourite subordinate...</p>
