  <h1>Chapter 877 An Expert's Law of the Counter Wave</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When that blazing golden light of Buddha lit up the sky...</p>

    <p>Devil Gut Fungus Lord raised his head, already sensing an expert's arrival.</p>

    <p>But he wasn't the least bit afraid. He just waved his hand and covered the new yield of bacteria on the ground with a purple and black barrier. This light of Buddha was so intense that it had an ultraviolet sterilizing effect, and he had to protect his newly created subordinates.</p>

    <p>"Has an expert come..."</p>

    <p>To be honest, not only wasn't Devil Gut Fungus Lord daunted, he was even a little excited.</p>

    <p>This was because, apart from evolving, more of his strength was obtained by swallowing it.</p>

    <p>Swallowing the Cosmic God Tree's branch alone allowed him to grow a mouth, eyes and limbs, as well as to even obtain spatial abilities.</p>

    <p>If he could swallow this expert, his strength would definitely soar again.</p>

    <p>But if they fought for real, Devil Gut Fungus Lord felt that this expert who had just landed on the island wouldn't be easy to deal with.</p>

    <p>The other party's spell was Devil Gut Fungus Lord's antithesis - it wouldn't be wrong to say they were utterly incompatible. Besides, swallowing the other party would be extremely difficult, like holding a burning hot sweet potato in the mouth; if he was just a little careless, he would be destroyed along with the other party.</p>

    <p>While swallowing the other person would be a good thing, what Devil Gut Fungus Lord planned to do now was hold firm.</p>

    <p>Gazing at the light of Buddha in the sky, he suddenly flung out one hand to tear open the space above him and use these cracks to block the light.</p>

    <p>At the same time, his body started to divide itself.</p>

    <p>A fist-sized lump of flesh broke away from his original body, turned into a worm, and burrowed into the earth.</p>

    <p>Devil Gut Fungus Lord didn't breathe a sigh of relief until all this was done. Then came the head-to-head fight.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei had only used less than twenty percent of his strength to perform the first Wutian Golden Buddha Palm. After all, this was a level seven spell, with enough power to destroy a small city; if he used too much strength, he might swat Chrysanthemum Island into pieces.</p>

    <p>Jin Shi and Yin Shi were still on the island. Before he rescued them, he had to save his strength.</p>

    <p>The most important thing was that until now, Lord Diulei still didn't know what kind of being had invaded Chrysanthemum Island.</p>

    <p>"Look out!"</p>

    <p>At that moment, the Brilliant Victory sword under his feet released a blast of sword qi and helped Lord Diulei avoid a pitch-black laser beam.</p>

    <p>This was Devil Gut Fungus Lord's ability, Super Bacteria Wave, which had an extremely long range of attack.</p>

    <p>"That was close..." Lord Diulei broke into a cold sweat. He had been mindful of the enemy's aura on the island all this time, but he didn't think that the enemy wouldn't have one, and so didn't immediately anticipate the other party's surprise attack.</p>

    <p>If Brilliant Victory's sword spirit hadn't protected him, he would have been hit by this dangerous blow!</p>

    <p>Brilliant Victory's sword spirit had been awakened after Lord Diulei advanced to True Venerated level. The Brilliant Victory sword had very strong defensive abilities to begin with, and this was a sword spirit who was extremely protective of its master and had a keen awareness of the outside world.</p>

    <p>But Lord Diulei had yet to see what Brilliant Victory's sword spirit looked like.</p>

    <p>Brilliant Victory's sword spirit was impregnable, had strong defensive abilities, and was a real shut-in...</p>

    <p>"What evil spirit are you?" Lord Diulei opened his palm, and the light of Buddha glowed even brighter in his hand.</p>

    <p>Devil Gut Fungus Lord was very uncomfortable under the light; the torn-up space which he had used to block it was already no longer effective.</p>

    <p>Thus, he extracted newborn bacteria from the bacterial spores on the ground, which were still multiplying, to create a protective barrier in front of him.</p>

    <p>The bacteria died as soon as the light of Buddha shone on them, but the bacteria below on the ground continued to multiply at the same time, maintaining a balance.</p>

    <p>"Brother To..."</p>

    <p>With Devil Gut Fungus Lord's appearance, Lord Diulei now understood what had happened on Chrysanthemum Island.</p>

    <p>He didn't know how Immortal Toya had been taken over, but the one thing Lord Diulei was sure of was that this fiend was inside Immortal Toya right now.</p>

    <p>"So, a troublesome fellow has come." Devil Gut Fungus Lord dusted himself off. "This body suits me very well. Since your friend and I are in the same body, how about we both take a step back? I promise I won't hurt your friend - as long as I've evolved fully and can form my own body, I'll let your friend go. The three of us can live in harmony and happily enjoy the world together."</p>

    <p>"Why should I make a deal with a fiend like you?" Brilliant Victory in hand, Lord Diulei pointed it at Devil Gut Fungus Lord. "Since you chose to hitch a ride in my friend, are you ready to be punished by my venerable self?"</p>

    <p>"Your cultivation is indeed higher than mine, but it won't be that easy to punish me."</p>

    <p>Devil Gut Fungus Lord sneered and manipulated the continuously-multiplying bacteria into gathering on his back, and actually created eight purple and black arms, all of which were directly made of bacteria.</p>

    <p>These eight arms then spread out together. In that moment, Devil Gut Fungus Lord had ten arms in total.</p>

    <p>Ten arms, fifty fingers...</p>

    <p>The next second, the laser beams of the Super Bacteria Wave was fired at Lord Diulei like a barrage of bullets.</p>

    <p>The viscous Super Bacteria Wave was extremely swift and corrosive, and coupled with its extremely wide coverage, even the Brilliant Victory sword found it difficult to defend against such a wide attack range. Furthermore, given the Super Bacteria Wave's unusual traits, it was best not to come into direct contact with it, even with a barrier up, as that would be self-destructive.</p>

    <p>That was because the Super Bacteria Wave could spread - if it got through the barrier and over the body, that would be a disaster.</p>

    <p>Given the situation, Lord Diulei already had no other choice; the only thing he could think of was to use the Wutian Golden Buddha Palm and destroy the island... Immortal Toya would definitely blame him, but it was still better than letting this dangerous bacteria spread!</p>

    <p>"Brilliant Victory! Go and take Jin Shi and Yin Shi away!" Lord Diulei spread his arms wide to block the oncoming attack. Wrapped in the light of Buddha, the Brilliant Victory sword under his feet rushed to Jin Shi and Yin Shi's location, picked them up as if they were beads on a string, then directly carried them off the island.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, Lord Diulei put his hands together...</p>

    <p>How powerful was the Wutian Golden Buddha Palm at one hundred percent... In that moment, the countering light of Buddha turned into a brightly colored shock wave which hit the Super Bacteria Wave with a bang.</p>

    <p>Devil Gut Fungus Lord's face drained of all color.</p>

    <p>Because the moment the palm strike happened, the apparition of a huge golden Buddha actually appeared behind Lord Diulei!</p>

    <p>At the palm strike, the Buddha also thrust its palm forward. The Super Bacteria Wave covered a very wide range, but the instant the light of Buddha shone on it, the wave dissipated into nothingness... it was actually completely annihilated, without leaving even a single bacterium behind...</p>

    <p>Looking at the effect of this offensive strike, Lord Diulei smiled. "It seems that you don't understand the law of the counter wave in the cultivation world."</p>

    <p>"Law of the counter wave?" Devil Gut Fungus Lord was blank.</p>

    <p>"The counter wave! The first to release a light wave is naturally the loser!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
