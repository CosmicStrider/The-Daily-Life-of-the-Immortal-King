  <h1>Chapter 964 Tigress</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The news that Xiaoling's mom was beaten up very quickly reached Liang Heng, but he didn't say anything. Strength Super Martial Arts Dojo was now gaining momentum. Chen Yi being the head of Wang Situ's fan group, his martial arts dojo was also highly revered - pulling him down now wouldn't be easy.</p>

    <p>But Liang Heng had a new plan for this.</p>

    <p>If what those students said was true and Wang Xiaoling was indeed a rare genius, luring her over to their Balance Magic Center and ultimately making her their spokesperson would help them regain their lost popularity very quickly.</p>

    <p>However, Liang Heng also knew very well that roping in Wang Xiaoling wouldn't be easy; clearly, he had to threaten Xiaoling's mom and teach her a small lesson.</p>

    <p>Actually, Liang Heng had privately looked for someone yesterday to ask Xiaoling's mom about transferring Xiaoling to the Balance Magic Center to study, but Xiaoling's mom had outright turned it down.</p>

    <p>Liang Heng was someone who prized his reputation; the more he couldn't get something, the more he wanted it. Tiger Liang had also inherited this narrow-minded trait; growing up, Tiger Liang had never not had his way. Liang Heng was too tyrannical, so no one dared to provoke him so easily. However, if he continued behaving in this manner, there would most likely come a day when he would find himself in danger...</p>

    <p>That evening, a group of children came by the Balance Magic Center, and Liang Heng ordered them plenty of takeaway chicken buckets.</p>

    <p>They were all the kids who had gone with Tiger Liang yesterday to make trouble for Xiaoling's mom.</p>

    <p>"Little Tiger was awesome yesterday; you'll definitely have promise once you grow up."</p>

    <p>After praising Tiger Liang, Liang Heng then looked at the other children. "All of you were pretty good too. My family's Little Tiger is hurt, so I'll have to trouble you to take care of him."</p>

    <p>Liang Heng was very sly. He only mentioned these three words "take care of" to the others without directly inciting these children to help Tiger Liang stir up trouble.</p>

    <p>"Dad, it seems mom knows about what happened yesterday. She's very angry." Gnawing on a fried chicken leg, Tiger Liang pondered for a bit before he finally spoke.</p>

    <p>"You can ignore that tigress. Instead of learning from your mother, you should learn more from me, your father." Liang Heng rubbed Tiger Liang's head, a smile on his face.</p>

    <p>Liang Heng always called his wife "tigress," even in front of outsiders. After stealing that university teacher from Chen Yi back then, Liang Heng married her and they had Tiger Liang. After that, Liang Heng felt that they didn't have much affection for each other, and somehow felt like something was missing - the delight at winning over Tiger Liang's mom in front of Chen Yi wasn't there.</p>

    <p>For Liang Heng, the crucial thing was to put all his efforts into grooming his son Tiger Liang; his family's tigress was nothing to be afraid of.</p>

    <p>However fierce she was, didn't she still become his wife?</p>

    <p>As the saying went, how can you catch a tiger cub without entering the tiger's lair 1...</p>

    <p>Liang Heng didn't realize that he had ruined yet another classic saying.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>As Father Chen had expected, close to noon the following day, Tiger Liang again took a gang of brats with him to make trouble for Xiaoling's mom. Actually, they didn't know that what they were doing would be considered criminal behavior if they were adults. Instead, they just thought it was interesting.</p>

    <p>There was no understanding the behavior of bratty kids to begin with. Furthermore, if there were bratty parents encouraging them from behind, this would only cause their children to become even more reckless and worse than before.</p>

    <p>Father Chen didn't let Chen Chao and Wang Xiaoling do anything. Xiaoling's mom's recycling stand was near a cafe. Father Chen took Chen Chao and Wang Xiaoling to the cafe, where they could sit and observe the situation.</p>

    <p>As soon as Tiger Liang showed up on crutches, along with that bunch of brats, Wang Xiaoling pointed nervously in their direction. Chen Chao gripped Wang Xiaoling's restless hand and had her calm down. "Don't worry, Xiaoling, we just need to watch the show."</p>

    <p>Indeed, they just needed to watch the show...</p>

    <p>Because at that very moment, the sons of three sect heads had already been waiting for a long time inside Xiaoling's mom's recycling shop.</p>

    <p>Early that morning, a limo had brought three people over to the shop. Xiaoling's mom was stunned and thought that the group had come to make trouble again. In the end, a bodyguard had followed them, and traded all the junk inside Xiaoling's mom's shop for cash...</p>

    <p>Of course, the bodyguard didn't need this junk at all. He had picked them up to do a good deed on one hand, and to make room for the three young masters on the other.</p>

    <p>The recycling stand wasn't big to begin with. Cleared of junk, the place was just big enough for a scuffle between kids.</p>

    <p>Then, the three young scions of Tyrant Earth Sect, Heavenly Xuan Sect and Star Killer Sect, with an average age of less than ten, sat on small folding stools prepared for them in advance and waited for Tiger Liang and his gang to come.</p>

    <p>The three young masters had very smart postures as they sat on the stools. Each one of them wore a miniature Western suit and a pair of small sunglasses, and they looked incomparably cultured.</p>

    <p>Xiaoling's mom didn't know what was going on at first, but when noon arrived and she saw Tiger Liang and the others come over again after causing trouble for her yesterday, she had a rough idea...</p>

    <p>At first, she thought about going over to plead with them, but when she thought about how she had been burned by Tiger Liang's fireball yesterday, she still felt some lingering fear.</p>

    <p>Seeing this, the tall bodyguard on the side smiled slightly. "Auntie, don't panic, just relax. Let kids handle their own matters."</p>

    <p>The three young masters had their assignments, and so did he. In addition to keeping them safe, the truth was that the bodyguard was here to do damage control.</p>

    <p>If something unexpected happened, someone was bound to show up.</p>

    <p>He was here on the order of the sect leader of Tyrant Earth Sect Zhang Dezhi, and this counterattack was also something Zhang Dezhi came up with himself.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Tiger Liang came over. When he saw the three cute young masters sitting inside the recycling stand, he laughed darkly and shouted, "Are the three of you Xiaoling's mom's reinforcements?"</p>

    <p>The three scions exchanged looks and didn't say a word.</p>

    <p>For today's performance, they had gotten the same haircut early that morning and even wore the same clothes. Apart from the difference in their heights, they looked like three brothers from a distance.</p>

    <p>The relationship between the three sect leaders was good to begin with, so the relationship between the three scions naturally wouldn't be an ordinary thing.</p>

    <p>"If you don't say anything, I'll take that as agreement." Tiger Liang chuckled. "One of my legs might be crippled, but let me offer you a piece of advice: get lost, or you're dead meat!"</p>

    <p>Tiger Liang was the biggest tyrant among these brats, and when he spoke, it was with an automatically arrogant air.</p>

    <p>But these three little scions weren't pushovers.</p>

    <p>Balance Magic Center was indeed well-known in this area, but however famous it was, could Tiger Liang compare with biological children of three sect leaders, who trained them personally? No matter how strong Liang Heng was or how famous the magic center was, it was just a small, crappy joint in front of genuine light force sects.</p>

    <p>The three scions couldn't figure out why a kid of a small dojo could be so pompous. The child standing in the middle made a move right away. He was the son of the sect leader of Tyrant Earth Sect Zhang Dezhi, and was only eight years old.</p>

    <p>His movements were so quick that Chen Chao couldn't react in time. When he came back to his senses, the first swing had already smashed into Tiger Liang's right cheek...</p>

    <p>Bang!</p>

    <p>Tiger Liang flew backward right away with a bloody mouth.</p>
