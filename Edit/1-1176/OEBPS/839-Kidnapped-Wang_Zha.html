  <h1>Chapter 839 Kidnapped "Wang Zha"</h1>
  
  <dfn><sup>0</sup>(The Rocket card combo in the "Fight the Landlord" card game which beats everything.)</dfn>

  <div>

    <p>In the van, the two big men put a black bag over Wang Ling's head, but he was quite unperturbed; this was a once-in-a-lifetime type of experience - how many times would a person ever be kidnapped while on the way home from school?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had once pretended to be enticed by snacks and deliberately let human traffickers kidnap him. He then traced them back to their source and helped the police destroy their den. Actually, those traffickers' MO had been quite mild: they used food or drinks most of the time to lure in unsuspecting kids.</p>

    <p>But these two fools hadn't said a word before directly dragging Wang Ling into the van... He supposed they could be considered pretty capable and gutsy.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling himself hadn't expected something like this to happen.</p>

    <p>His special eyelid warning was usually triggered when he was going to run into something he thought was going to be a little more troublesome and tricky.</p>

    <p>But abduction... didn't meet these standards at all!</p>

    <p>This was just a warm-up exercise!</p>

    <p>It would help him be even better at keeping his marks down in tomorrow's exams!</p>

    <p>There was one day left before the summer break, so Wang Ling was in a good mood.</p>

    <p>In any case, he didn't have anything lined up this afternoon... he might as well have some fun with this bunch.</p>

    <p>Through his Mind-Reading Ability, he discovered that these two men were from that mysterious Net rehab center; things had become even more interesting. Even Mo Immortal Castle hadn't been able to find any reliable leads on this group. After it was reported and shut down several years ago, the word online was that this Net rehab center had been converted into a mobile behavior correction facility without a fixed address.</p>

    <p>Without an insider to show the way, no one would be able to find it at all.</p>

    <p>When the driver stopped the van at an intersection, he lit a cigarette and glanced at Wang Ling, who had the bag over his head. "Did you confirm his identity? Why does it feel like it was too smooth?"</p>

    <p>"We confirmed it; he looks exactly the same as in the photo!" One of the big men holding Wang Ling down nodded.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..." What damn "exactly the same"?!</p>

    <p>"Don't tell me you kidnapped a student, did you?" The driver laughed.</p>

    <p>"No way - students nowadays all wear school uniforms! This Number 60 High's school uniform is so ugly and very recognizable!" that big man said again.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Today, Wang Ling wasn't wearing the school uniform...</p>

    <p>Classes had stopped for the final exams. Although there were some who still came to take the exams in the school uniform, the dress code during this period was relatively casual. To ensure that every student came to take the exams in their most relaxed state of mind, Number 60 High gave the students permission to wear whatever they liked or felt most comfortable in during the major exam period.</p>

    <p>No wonder these two fools had gotten the wrong person; it turned out it was related to him not wearing his school uniform!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p>"Why hasn't he spoken since we grabbed him just now?" the other big man suddenly asked.</p>

    <p>It was at that moment that Wang Ling also abruptly realized that his behavior might be a little unusual.</p>

    <p>Generally speaking, a person who had been kidnapped would struggle a little... It wouldn't be good if he behaved too calmly.</p>

    <p>Thus, Wang Ling closed his eyes and started to control the air fluctuations over his skin to make it look like he was trembling out of fear.</p>

    <p>He didn't know how hard he should be trembling; after all, he had never done so since young... The first and only time it had ever happened was six years ago, when Er Ha, who had still been Tuntian Ha then, crashed down on top of the established century-old crispy noodle snacks flagship store.</p>

    <p>As expected, when the two big men saw Wang Ling start to tremble, they felt much more at ease.</p>

    <p>"Hahahaha, looks like he's too scared to speak!"</p>

    <p>"Little brother, don't be scared! We're just taking you to get a massage! No need to be nervous!" One of them patted Wang Ling's shoulder.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if he was imagining it, but he felt that Wang Ling was trembling a little too hard... just like the vibrator he had used the other day...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After an hour or so on the road, the van finally entered a park and stopped in a parking lot inside.</p>

    <p>Task accomplished, the driver drove off once again, apparently to bring the next person here.</p>

    <p>Hustled along by the two large men, Wang Ling entered the trees. One of the men took off the bag on his head, and Wang Ling saw a log cabin with a Number 13 sign.</p>

    <p>The legendary Treatment Room Number 13... had now become a mobile log cabin.</p>

    <p>It didn't look big, but it gave off a sinister air. Furthermore, the Space Expansion Skill had been used inside.</p>

    <p>After he was pushed inside by the two men, Wang Ling guessed from the auras within that there were a hundred people here.</p>

    <p>He was astonished.</p>

    <p>This was basically a mobile prison cell...</p>

    <p>Wang Ming waited for a while in the lobby, guarded by the two men. It wasn't long before Yang Huai came out from within the cabin, accompanied by a familiar person whom Wang Ling had once fought: Long Ming.</p>

    <p>They were talking and laughing as they headed toward the lobby.</p>

    <p>"Hehe, rest assured, Mr Long Ming, there are no problems with your requests at all. I'll make the arrangements right away, and turn all those kids in Number 60 High as meek as lambs."</p>

    <p>"Then we thank Dr Yang for your efforts in the revenge plan this time." Long Ming smiled.</p>

    <p>"Revenge plan? No, no, no, Mr Long Ming you're wrong; this is an education program!"</p>

    <p>"Hahahaha! Right, Dr Yang, you're right! This is an education program!"</p>

    <p>By that time, they had already reached Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>When Long Ming lowered his head and saw Wang Ling, he was so frightened that his complexion changed, and he started to sweat like crazy.</p>

    <p>WTF...</p>

    <p>Why was it him?</p>

    <p>One of the large men stood up and said to Yang Huai, "Dr Yang, we've brought patient Guo Feng."</p>

    <p>Yang Huai: "Mr Long Ming, let me explain: this is a new patient whom we will be treating today, Guo Feng. Hm, he's a bit more of an introvert. His family has repeatedly urged him to get married, and he's always refused. so they sent him to me after buying the basic treatment package."</p>

    <p>Long Ming was blank.</p>

    <p>Guo... Feng?</p>

    <p>Was he mistaken?</p>

    <p>He had just opened his mouth to ask Yang Huai if he was sure, when the young man, who was sitting down, suddenly looked up at him... This gaze was a direct hit to Long Ming's soul, freezing him in place as he felt all his hair stand on end.</p>

    <p>"Dr Yang... I still have other things to do today... I'll head off first!"</p>

    <p>Without another word, Long Ming rushed straight out of the log cabin in the next second.</p>

    <p>That was right...</p>

    <p>He rushed straight out.</p>

    <p>That look just now was too horrifying... Long Ming didn't doubt that if he hadn't left, the young man would have taken his life in an instant.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's limpid gaze followed him out.</p>

    <p>Long Ming ran away, but he wouldn't be able to run for long.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had already branded him with that look just now.</p>

    <p>After all, there was still plenty of time.</p>
