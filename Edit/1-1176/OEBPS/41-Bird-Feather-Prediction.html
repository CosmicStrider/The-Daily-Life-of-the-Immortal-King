  <h1>Chapter 41 Bird Feather Prediction </h1>

  <div>

      

      <p>The "Great Blood Origin Spell" was one of the Three Thousand Great Spells which Wang Ling had mastered with average proficiency. One of its sub-abilities was called "blood origin trace," which could accurately trace bloodlines. To put it directly... it was DNA identification.</p>

      <p>During the Spirit Energy era, the way many people inherited ancient legacy in fact depended mostly on bloodlines. The Great Blood Origin Spell had been popular at that time, and cultivators unafraid of danger would go deep into the ancient tombs of previous cultivators to find such a legacy and obtain a huge boost in their realms within a short period of time.</p>

      <p>Now, however, the state had already ordered a ban on such methods of legacy inheritance, since the risk involved was considerable and there was a possibility of contracting a blood disease. Back then, Huaxiu nation's first-generation leaders had even specially gathered together these cultivators who had inherited legacies in such a reckless way to denounce them publicly over the crime of "opportunistic reactionary cultivation."</p>

      <p>Previous generations of leaders had always felt that no matter how strong or weak one's gift was, one should rely on their own efforts to build up their cultivation step-by-step. Depending on corrupt cultivation practices was absolutely not the right way!</p>

      <p>Hence, after that, the use of the Great Blood Origin Spell waned. It was strictly banned by the state, thereby becoming a prohibited spell. The number of people in the world who could use this spell, apart from Wang Ling who had learned it while he was still in the womb, could be counted on one hand.</p>

      <p>Now, Wang Ling occasionally used this spell to identify the innate gifts of the people around him, since bloodlines could also reflect talent.</p>

      <p>When he was a child, he had always thought that there should in fact be someone like him, a person who had been born with a "silver spoon" in his mouth.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, to this day... he hadn't found anyone similar to him.</p>

      <p>He had been aware of the results of the "blood origin trace" on Er Dan since entering school.</p>

      <p>Er Dan was in fact not a common parrot. Though it had hidden it very well, Wang Ling had still found out.</p>

      <p>To be exact, it was a hybrid parrot with many noble bloodlines.</p>

      <p>Through the blood origin trace, Wang Ling had seen the following species in its blood: the <em>kunpeng </em><sup>1</sup> , the nine-headed bird <sup>2</sup> , the four-eyed bird <sup>3</sup> , the vermilion bird <sup>4</sup> , the <em>bifang </em><sup>5</sup> ... oh, by the way, there was also a Pidgey <sup>6</sup> .</p>

      <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The 'kunpeng ' is a giant bird in Chinese mythology.)</dfn>

      <dfn><sup>2</sup>(One of the earliest forms of the Chinese phoenix.)</dfn>

      <dfn><sup>3</sup>(Yet another powerful, mythical bird in Chinese legend - each of its eyes contain two pupils, hence its name.)</dfn>

      <dfn><sup>4</sup>(One of the four mythological creatures of the Chinese constellations, it's described as a red bird perpetually covered in flames.)</dfn>

      <dfn><sup>5</sup>(The 'bifang' is a Chinese mythical bird named for the sound of its cry. It has one leg, a blue-green body with red spots and a white beak. Considered an omen, each time the bifang is sighted, a fire will break out.)</dfn>

      <dfn><sup>6</sup>(Pidgey is a bird Pokémon.)</dfn>

      <p>Who the heck knew what Er Dan's parents had gone through before its birth? Of course, Wang Ling didn't want to know... the one thing he could be sure of, though, was that this mix of so many bloodlines had granted Er Dan a unique ability.</p>

      <p>Under normal circumstances, Guo Hao wouldn't have Er Dan reveal its ability in public, otherwise he would inevitably be suspected of playing tricks.</p>

      <p>But now that Chen Chao had called his reputation into question, Guo Hao felt it was necessary for him to reveal his hand.</p>

      <p>He winked at Er Dan... actually, this boy and bird had already come to a clear agreement long ago concerning their private and public affairs: under watchful eyes in public, Er Dan would give its owner face as necessary; after they returned home, Guo Hao would have to give up this false Guo Hao appearance in private and pay the price for his public glory by becoming a shit-shoveling officer <sup>7</sup> .</p>

      <dfn><sup>7</sup>(Pet owners jokingly refer to themselves as 'shit-shoveling officers' to show their devotion to their pets as they have to clean up after them.)</dfn>

      <p>These complex feelings between boy and bird gave Wang Ling a sense of déjà vu. Something worth mentioning which other people were probably unaware of... was that Er Dan was female. Wang Ling had already silently realized this; he just didn't want to say anything.</p>

      <p>"Students, I'm sorry to have kept you waiting." Lao Gudong skipped cheerfully over to them. He had said only a few words before his wristwatch shrilled with a call. When he looked at the caller ID, he immediately waved at them, a high color to his cheeks. "Excuse me, I'll have to keep you waiting a little longer!~" Saying that, he ran eagerly to one side to receive the call.</p>

      <p>Lao Gudong being this lively was already beyond everyone's comprehension...</p>

      <p>Nice timing, while Lao Gudong answered the phone, it was a good opportunity to figure out what on earth was going on with him!</p>

      <p>"There is nothing in this world that this master doesn't know!" While speaking, Guo Hao gingerly pulled out one of Er Dan's feathers, causing its pure white, slightly plump body to tremble for an instant.</p>

      <p>"What is that for?" Lin Xiaoyu asked confusedly.</p>

      <p>"This is the Names Fortune Skill; it requires a feather from Er Dan. As long as I the master hold this feather, look at the person in question and repeat their name three times, I'll know their fortune based on the color which the feather changes into," Guo Hao said with a mysterious air.</p>

      <p>Er Dan silently rolled its eyes at Guo Hao: <em>First, you spray this boss with your spit, now you want this boss to cooperate with you in your pretentious act... hehe, when we return home, you're going to get it!</em></p>

      <p>What Names Fortune Skill... Guo Hao made this spell sound so marvelous, when in fact, generally speaking, it was just fortune-telling.</p>

      <p>The crucial point was that this wasn't his ability, but Er Dan's own special ability.</p>

      <p>In Wang Ling's opinion, though, this ability wasn't worth much even if it was created from the combination of the bloodlines of several legendary birds.</p>

      <p>All in all, however, the assessment results should be accurate. At least, it would be way better than the roadside soothsayers who grabbed people to say, "Benefactor, there is evil between your eyebrows, you will definitely encounter a bloody calamity!"</p>

      <p>Rubbing the feather in his hand, Guo Hao mouthed Lao Gudong's real name three times, and everyone saw that white, spotless feather instantly turn pink.</p>

      <p>"A pink feather?" Guo Hao stared at the feather with an astonished expression.</p>

      <p>Sun Rong gave the pink feather a cursory look and asked, "A pink feather... what does it stand for?"</p>

      <p>Guo Hao was already well-versed in the symbolic meanings of the feather's colors, but for this color to appear in relation to Lao Gudong... to be honest, he really hadn't anticipated it at all.</p>

      <p>Thinking of Lao Gudong's jubilant attitude earlier, as he bounced and skipped around, plus this key pink feather, the answer already seemed obvious. "A pink feather means luck in love. Lao Gudong has... fallen in love!"</p>

      <p>"Oh, so it's because he's fallen in love..." It was mere realization at first.</p>

      <p>After a moment of dead silence, an earth-shaking roar immediately burst out.</p>

      <p>— What the fuck?!</p>

      <p>Fallen?! In?! Love?!</p>

      <p>This ageless Lao Gudong who only knew how to eat <em>latiao </em>was actually beginning to arrange flowers in his antique vase?!</p>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p>Chen Chao, Sun Rong and Lin Xiaoyu all felt that it was inconceivable.</p>

      <p>"...Is your feather reliable or not?" Chen Chao asked again dubiously.</p>

      <p>"Shit! You still don't believe me?"</p>

      <p>"I just think it's a little too unreal! Fortune-telling using a bird feather, thinking about it, it's too unscientific," said Chen Chao.</p>

      <p>Wang Ling: "..." <em>So, you think a bird feather changing colors is very scientific?</em></p>

      <p>Chen Chao was a very skeptical person and liked to split hairs a lot, especially when it came to old superstitions.</p>

      <p>In order to verify the authenticity of this feather fortune-telling, Chen Chao rudely pulled out another one of Er Dan's feathers.</p>

      <p>This time, it hurt enough that Er Dan twitched hard and gave Guo Hao a look as it gnashed its teeth, even though it had no teeth to gnash...</p>

      <p>It didn't care who it was that pulled out its feather; in the end, it would blame everything on Guo Hao...</p>

      <p>Guo Hao: "What do you want?"</p>

      <p>"Come on, our Comrade Guo Hao! Find another person's fortune to read." Chen Chao placed the bird feather in Guo Hao's hand.</p>

      <p>Guo Hao silently curled his lips; he then looked at Lin Xiaoyu and recited her name three times. The bird feather turned dark red.</p>

      <p>It was related to her fortune, after all, so Lin Xiaoyu was a little nervous. "This color, what does it mean?"</p>

      <p>Guo Hao carefully discerned the color of the feather and quickly read its message. "This red feather symbolizes fire on the body, so recently you had to be careful of fire and had to stay away from places that have them."</p>

      <p>Lin Xiaoyu looked astonished. "...This is too accurate!"</p>

      <p>Just last week, the gay fanfiction that she had painstakingly collected over the years had been discovered by her father, who had burned them all.</p>

      <p>Chen Chao skeptically pulled another feather from Er Dan's body. "Come on, read my fortune."</p>

      <p>"..." This feather was from Er Dan's belly, where its flesh was the most tender; it was so painful it made all of its feathers stand up.</p>

      <p>Wang Ling even saw a crystal tear form in the corner of its eye...</p>

      <p>Helpless, Guo Hao read Chen Chao's fortune and saw that the feather had turned blue. He sighed and said, "You had to stay away from water in the last month."</p>

      <p>Chen Chao also showed his surprise. "...It really is accurate!" He remembered when he had been at the swimming pool last week and had gotten a cramp in his leg while swimming. If it hadn't been for the lifeguard, who had parted the water with one palm... he felt he might have died.</p>

      <p>"Now do you believe me?" Guo Hao felt rather helpless.</p>

      <p>At this very moment, Lao Gudong returned after talking endlessly on the phone, looking even more radiant than before.</p>

      <p>"Students, your teacher has good news to share with you."</p>

      <p>Standing in front of everyone, he didn't hide his ecstasy at all. "Teacher has found you a teacher's wife!"</p>

      <p>Students: "..."</p>

      <p>Wang Ling: "..." Then, what was the point of plucking out the feathers?</p>

      <p>Er Dan: "..." <em>Psycho! You think I don't need face?!</em></p>
