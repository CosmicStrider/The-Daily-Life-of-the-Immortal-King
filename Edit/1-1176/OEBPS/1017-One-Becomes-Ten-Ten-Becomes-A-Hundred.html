  <h1>Chapter 1017 One Becomes Ten, Ten Becomes A Hundred</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling never thought that there would actually come a day when he would name his own little brother or sister. In fact, he never thought Father and Mother Wang would have a second child; Wang Ling was unable to clearly see his own future. His life thread was blurry, and he was only just able to avoid calamities because of his twitching eyelid warning sign and some precognitive abilities.</p>

    <p>Actually, Wang Ling was looking forward to having a real sibling. Whether the baby in Mother Wang's belly was a younger brother or sister, Wang Ling felt that as an older brother, there was no way he would be like Wang Ming and always try to "bully" his little brother or sister.</p>

    <p>He had to get along very well with his sibling.</p>

    <p>Was the little one in the womb a boy or a girl? Would it like to eat crispy noodle snacks with Wang Ling? Would it also be born with unusual gifts? Wang Ling couldn't wait for all of it.</p>

    <p>As for why he chose the name "Wang Nuan."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt his choice could be considered a reflection of his own personality.</p>

    <p>Once a person's character was determined, it was very difficult to change. Wang Ling didn't like to talk, but that didn't mean he was autistic. From when he spurned noise and crowds before, to now, in Number 60 High half a year later, when he had gradually become used to the cheerful noise around him... He, who had been unwilling to meddle in other people's business before, was now willing to lend a hand to maintain world peace.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling realized that while a person's environment couldn't directly change their personality, it could change their frame of mind.</p>

    <p>He had never felt more grateful for the group of friends he had; his classmates at Number 60 High and his comrades at the Office of Strategic Deception had all contributed a lot to the change in his frame of mind.</p>

    <p>Why Wang Nuan?</p>

    <p>The name was a reflection of Wang Ling's changed character and his expectations for the unborn baby.</p>

    <p>He hoped it would be a carefree kid who could bring sunshine and warmth to anyone.</p>

    <p>At least, not one who would bottle everything up inside like Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"That's a good name!" Father Wang said approvingly.</p>

    <p>"So, honey, have you prepared any gifts to celebrate our second child?" Mother Wang stroked her belly and smiled at Father Wang.</p>

    <p>"Of course!"</p>

    <p>Saying that, Father Wang fished out a large treasure from the storage space of his pants pocket. It was a string of round, hard beads, and Mother Wang was instantly awed.</p>

    <p>The smooth round texture gave off a grand air, and it dazzled the eye the instant it was revealed. Mother Wang's stunned eyes were fixed on this stringed treasure, and her small mouth dropped open with undisguised astonishment.</p>

    <p>"This... this is?"</p>

    <p>"A jade necklace which I got custom-made! It's been blessed by a master! You know Old Chen?"</p>

    <p>"Chen Chao's dad?"</p>

    <p>"That's right! When Chen Chao was a kid, he had a fever that wouldn't go down, so Old Chen found a master who blessed Chen Chao. As a result, Chen Chao made a full recovery! It's the same master who blessed this jade necklace! I'm sure the little one will like it!" As he spoke, Father Wang picked up the earphone Mother Wang had bought and shook the jade pendant in his hand with a smile. "Are you a boy or a girl? Do you like the jade necklace?"</p>

    <p>The furniture in the Wang family's small villa started to shake as soon as he said the words.</p>

    <p>Then, Wang Ling saw a blast wave come out of Mother Wang's belly and shatter the jade necklace...</p>

    <p>With a gust of wind, it was no more...</p>

    <p>Father Wang, Mother Wang and Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>The three of them vaguely felt that they had seen this scene before...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>To Wang Ling's surprise, news of Mother Wang's second pregnancy spread so fast... On the morning of September 15th, the thirty-third day of the summer break, Wang Ling received a message from Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi sent a voice message. He asked carefully, " <em>Shifu </em>... I heard that you're going to have a little brother or sister?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was astonished.</p>

    <p>At most, only the sea village knew about Mother Wang's second pregnancy. Even if Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi had noticed it yesterday, it was unlikely they would have said anything to anyone else: for one thing, they were too busy to poke their noses into other people's business. For another, neither of them could be considered a big mouth.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling sent three question marks. "???"</p>

    <p>As Wang Ling's disciple, Zhuo Yi immediately grasped the essence of these question marks.</p>

    <p>From what Zhuo Yi understood of Wang Ling, if the news was false, Wang Ling would have definitely answered with a succinct "no." Sending these three question marks, he was very clearly asking: <em>How did you know?</em></p>

    <p>To be honest, Zhuo Yi had found out by chance.</p>

    <p>Because after resolving the Palace of Mirrors incident a while back, Lord Diulei had planned to reward every Office of Strategic Deception staff member for their help by buying each of them two boxes of fruit... and the sea village's oranges were very famous! Zhuo Yi had been responsible for placing the order... In the end, when he drove over to the village, he saw the villagers enthusiastically discussing Mother Wang's pregnancy.</p>

    <p>Old Man Wang was the center of attention, and the villagers wouldn't stop talking about it.</p>

    <p>So Zhuo Yi, who had come to buy fruit, found out.</p>

    <p>At that time, the shock in his heart was beyond words.</p>

    <p>To him, his <em>shifu </em>Wang Ling was already so strong...</p>

    <p>He truly couldn't imagine what kind of "god" Mother Wang's second child would be...</p>

    <p>If the two siblings fought, wouldn't that be a freaking live reenactment of the <em>Götterdämmerung </em>?</p>

    <p>After hearing Zhuo Yi's explanation, Wang Ling fell silent.</p>

    <p>Actually, Mother Wang had been more low-key about this pregnancy. There weren't any neighbors near the Wang family's small villa, and no one would pay attention to Mother Wang's second pregnancy anyway. The sea village was the only place in which word had spread about Mother Wang's second pregnancy. Wang Ling never expected Zhuo Yi to find out through sheer serendipity...</p>

    <p>In view of Mother Wang's wishes, Wang Ling ordered Zhuo Yi to keep it to himself.</p>

    <p>As his disciple, Zhuo Yi was naturally obedient.</p>

    <p>It was just that Wang Ling never expected the news of Mother Wang's second pregnancy to still reach the ears of everyone at the Office of Strategic Deception in the end.</p>

    <p>That afternoon, Lord Diulei held an emergency meeting to celebrate the second pregnancy, and everyone got busy preparing gifts.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi cried. This really had nothing to do with him. The desire to live compelled him to hurriedly text Wang Ling the whole story.</p>

    <p>" <em>Shifu </em>, this really isn't my fault!" Zhuo Yi sent the message, followed by several images.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw the packaging for the sea village's oranges.</p>

    <p>He remembered that it used to read: <em>Fresh oranges are even tastier!</em></p>

    <p>Now, it read: <em>Congratulations, Uncle Wang, on your second grandchild!</em></p>
