  <h1>Chapter 212 'Fashionable' Patriarch Reliance </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Whether the military training exercise could be considered a large-scale operation or not depended on the amount of money that had been invested into it and on the leaders who had come to observe the proceedings this time.</p>

    <p>There were quite a lot of leaders present for the six schools' combined military training exercise this time. Zhuo Yi was here as a representative of the General Administration of 100 Schools, and Secretary Dakang of the Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools had also come. Additionally, all the headmasters of the six schools had come to serve as supervisors.</p>

    <p>The number of students involved this time was quite large. The military training exercise was admittedly important, but the students' safety was likewise a priority.</p>

    <p>At noon, Immortal Toya was called to another meeting. As the chief instructor for the military training this time, he also had an important responsibility to help ensure the students' safety.</p>

    <p>In the meeting room, Secretary Dakang, Zhuo Yi, Headmaster Jin of Number 59 High School, Headmaster Chen of Number 60 High School, Headmaster Qian of Jiancai High School, Headmaster Sun of Shenye High School and Headmaster Hong of Jinyuan High School, these two great leaders and five headmasters, had all come together.</p>

    <p>"Why isn't Headmaster Yue of Reliance High School here yet?" Sitting on a long bench in the middle of the conference room, Secretary Dakang locked his fingers together and rested his chin on them. He frowned, a little unhappy.</p>

    <p>"I heard that Patriarch Reliance <sup>1</sup> just came out from seclusion; he's on his way here now." As Reliance High School's alliance partner this time, Headmaster Hong of Jinyuan High School mediated the situation.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Patriarch Reliance is actually
the name of a character from
the wuxia novel "I Shall Seal
the Heavens .. ")</dfn>

    <p>"I knew that that brat would definitely be late..." The old Secretary sighed. "In those days, he was a seclusion maniac. Thinking back to before Reliance High School was set up, this guy established Reliance Sect and found a mountain to build it on. He pulled some elders and high-ranking officials over, then went into seclusion. When he came out of seclusion several hundred years later, he didn't even know how many disciples there were in the sect."</p>

    <p>Headmasters: "..."</p>

    <p>"Are Secretary Dakang and this Senior Patriarch Reliance from the same sect? How do you know all this?" Immortal Toya asked curiously on one side.</p>

    <p>"How could we possibly be from the same sect? I know this naturally because of the establishment of Reliance High School back then. It was because of a problem with the high school that I had had a lot of contact with him before." The old Secretary pressed his lips together. His gaze swept over everyone present as he smiled. "You all know that every school in Huaxiu nation has to be endorsed by our Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools, right?"</p>

    <p>Everyone nodded. "Of course."</p>

    <p>The old Secretary said, "This endorsement naturally takes a while to process as it has to go through the government departments. After the application for setting up a school is submitted, the general examination and approval procedure takes fifteen working days."</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen nodded. "That's right, it indeed takes that long. In addition, the headmaster applying to set up the school has to show up in person to sign and provide a fingerprint, and to register the school's address on the spot. Only then is the application approved."</p>

    <p>"That was the problem."</p>

    <p>Secretary Dakang smiled bitterly. "Back then, whenever Patriarch Reliance submitted his application papers, he would go into seclusion after that, and it would be for a hundred years each time..."</p>

    <p>Headmasters: "..."</p>

    <p>Secretary Dakang: "The main problem was that this guy would resubmit his papers each time after coming out of seclusion, and then he couldn't help himself from going back in... in this way, our Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools received six applications one after another, and it took six hundred years for Reliance High School's application to be confirmed. If it hadn't been for these six hundred years, it would have been an old school that would be one thousand years old by now..."</p>

    <p>Headmasters: "..."</p>

    <p>There was silence in the conference room for a long time.</p>

    <p>After about five or six minutes, Zhuo Yi's cellphone finally rang. "It's news from Patriarch Reliance! A text message!"</p>

    <p>Secretary Dakang: "Oh? What did he say?"</p>

    <p>"He said..."</p>

    <p>Seeing the content of the text message, Zhuo Yi's expression looked very unsightly. After a silent moment of consideration, in the end, he still read out Patriarch Reliance's message: "Damn it! I just came out of seclusion, how can everyone be so quiet? Don't you surf the Internet? How many hunks and beauties are there today? Is my favorite Cailian Zhenren there? I hear Immortal Toya is also there today? It's this type of talented junior that I like. I'm still on the road, I'll see you later, mwah mwah !"</p>

    <p>After Zhuo Yi finished reading, everyone in the room instantly drew in sharp breaths.</p>

    <p>"..." Immortal Toya wiped at his sweat. Hearing that Patriarch Reliance actually had a good impression of him, he felt a little flattered in his heart, but also questioned how accurate the text was. "Director Zhuo... is this really from Senior Patriarch Reliance?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi opened the profile photo, and after repeatedly confirming it, nodded his head to everyone's incredulity. "It's absolutely true, it's real."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Everyone instantly felt that Patriarch Reliance's image had collapsed a little...</p>

    <p>Grand Patriarch Reliance was actually such an unconventional person! Was it because the Internet signal on Reliance Mountain was poor, and had only just been connected in the village?</p>

    <p>"You don't have to doubt it. That is unmistakably Patriarch Reliance's tone." The corner of Secretary Dakang's mouth twitched. "Although Patriarch Reliance is a seclusion maniac, his chosen seclusion spot for many years has been his hometown, Reliance Village. The village's Internet signal is indeed not very good."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Secretary Dakang: "But most regretfully... Patriarch Reliance has all along always thought himself a very fashionable person."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Another ten minutes passed, but Headmaster Yue of Reliance High School, Patriarch Reliance, had yet to show up.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi looked at his messages on his cellphone and saw that Patriarch Reliance had sent a second message. "Patriarch Reliance was in seclusion for a long time, and didn't know that there's an odd-even license plate regulation in effect now. It seems that he had been speeding on his flying sword on the road, and was arrested. Right now, he's still sorting it out at the police station."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>The old Secretary, who had been waiting a little impatiently, simply and directly took charge of the meeting. He turned to look at Headmaster Hong on one side. "Ignore him, let's start our meeting first. Little Hong, your Jinyuan High School and Reliance High School are in an alliance this time. If anything comes up in the meeting, you'll be responsible for passing the information on."</p>

    <p>"Yes, Secretary." Headmaster Hong nodded.</p>

    <p>The meeting officially began.</p>

    <p>The old Secretary looked inside the little notebook he had prepared. He had put down a number of issues that they had to discuss in relation to the military training exercise. After all, this survival drill was a pilot program which the six schools were participating in, so there were actually still a lot of holes in it. What they had to do now in this discussion was to find these holes in time and fill them.</p>

    <p>"General Yi has attached great importance to this exercise. Starting three months ago, he specially customized a large number of magic artifacts to be placed on the map for the students to use. This will greatly test the students' ability to adapt and to use a magic artifact in flexible ways."</p>

    <p>The old Secretary said, "However, given the fact that some of the magic artifacts require more complex operation, it won't be easy for students to use them, and studying them may take a long time. Our group of experts think that this could significantly slow down the drill's pace. What do you think?"</p>
