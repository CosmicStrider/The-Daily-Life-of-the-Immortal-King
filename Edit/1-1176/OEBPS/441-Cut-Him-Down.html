  <h1>Chapter 441 Cut Him Down! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Returning to the moment when Lord Diulei had been stabbed by the Heaven-Cleaving sword with the power of Sword Dao and had thoroughly exploded into a bloody mist...</p>

    <p>In that moment, Lord Diulei thought that it would hurt a lot, but in fact, he actually didn't feel any pain... His physical body was already completely pulverized as the power of Sword Dao pushed through his muscles and veins without even leaving a pulp of flesh behind as he completely disintegrated into a ball of bloody mist.</p>

    <p>However, Lord Diulei discovered that his soul was actually intact and flawlessly preserved.</p>

    <p>As a soul, he realized he was intangible as he floated in the air. However, the scene before his eyes was still vivid to him.</p>

    <p>After Evil Sword God let out a few roars, Wang Ling appeared in the blink of an eye, and with a single slap, had whipped Evil Sword God soundly...</p>

    <p>Too strong!</p>

    <p>Sure enough, Brother Ling's strength was even more terrifying than he had imagined!</p>

    <p>But what was going on here?</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei didn't quite understand. Reasonably speaking, the might of the Heaven-Cleaving sword, which could almost be called a divine sword, supported by the power of Sword Dao, would instantly destroy a soul, not to mention a physical body.</p>

    <p>But the outcome was contrary to Lord Diulei's expectations as he discovered that his soul wasn't the least bit injured...</p>

    <p>Furthermore, after some time, he realized that the bloody mist drifting in the air was actually re-coalescing; his meridians were being reconstructed and his physical body was being reshaped bit by bit as a brand new Lord Diulei came together once more, just like with the legendary Blood Escape Great Spell <sup>1</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A special technique derived from a hidden mission in the Chinese mobile game "AskTao .. ")</dfn>

    <p>More than that, even his clothes were restored!</p>

    <p>Perfect resurrection?</p>

    <p>It was only at this moment that Lord Diulei realized that tremendous spirit power was bubbling forth from the Soul Suppression Ring on the ring finger of his left hand! This was the spirit power generated by the special force of this magic ring that had protected his soul and prevented it from being extinguished by the Heaven-Cleaving sword, thereby allowing his corporeal body to be reformed.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei couldn't help sighing. If this was the extremely inauspicious calamity that was destined to befall him, then the Soul Suppression Ring had helped him successfully overcome it.</p>

    <p>People seldom encountered extremely inauspicious calamities in their lifetimes. When they did, the probability of beating the odds could be said to be almost negligible.</p>

    <p>This was precisely the reason why when Cheat Diviner Reed had read his fortune, he had thought that there was no hope for Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>It looked like he owed Brother Ling an enormous favor yet again!</p>

    <p>After his body was reconstituted and he was completely resurrected, Lord Diulei couldn't help sighing in his heart.</p>

    <p>Had it not been for this ring, it was very likely he wouldn't have been able to overcome this calamity.</p>

    <p>When he was brought back to life, Evil Sword God had already been directly sent flying by Wang Ling's second slap as he hit the sports field with a <em>boom </em>; when he had flown out of the school building before that, there had actually been a school toilet tank on his head...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God climbed up from the ground; he was shivering all over, and even his knees were trembling uncontrollably.</p>

    <p>He was both scared and pissed off...</p>

    <p>When had he, Ten-Meter Sword God, ever been humiliated like this?</p>

    <p>Not only hadn't he had the strength to retaliate against these two slaps; even his two spirit swords had been seized by the other party. This was absolute humiliation, and for the first time ever, Evil Sword God felt ashamed!</p>

    <p>Shivering, he grit his teeth and obstinately stood up. His entire body trembled and he was bleeding from all the seven orifices of his head, dark red blood dripping from the gaps between his teeth... Even his front teeth were gone.</p>

    <p>This youngster definitely wasn't just an Itinerant Immortal.</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God was already certain on this point.</p>

    <p>To inflict this type of damage on him with these two slaps alone, he was absolutely not an ordinary person.</p>

    <p>But he was unwilling to admit defeat. He was Evil Sword God, and from the moment he had stepped out into the world, he had struck terror in the heart of society at all levels. No one he wanted to kill had ever escaped him. Had he ever been humiliated like this before?</p>

    <p>However, when he saw Lord Diulei, who had already turned into a ball of bloody mist in the air earlier, completely resurrected after his corporeal body reformed, he had a rare shocked expression on his face.</p>

    <p>"That's impossible! How can that be!" Evil Sword God grit his teeth. Given the strength of the young man in white, it was absolutely impossible for him to harbor surplus energy for a resurrection technique. His Heaven-Cleaving sword was mixed with the formidable power of Sword Dao, which was a heavenly law among the Three Thousand Great Spells. When its power flowed through a person's body, it was almost on par with divine punishment, and in a blink of an eye, the soul would disintegrate completely, let alone the corporeal body.</p>

    <p>This way, nothing was left behind to bury. Evil Sword God didn't know how many people he had killed with this method; as far as he knew, no one had ever survived it.</p>

    <p>So...</p>

    <p>Who the hell knew what he was experiencing today.</p>

    <p>He gazed at Lord Diulei who had been completely resurrected; even his clothes had been perfectly restored, as if time had turned back.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Evil Sword God felt very solemn and calm. "No matter what, I must respond with my most powerful technique in this fight; I won't hold back any longer. When <em>shizun </em>Sword Immortal Fan Rui chose Senior Brother Yi Jianchuan as his successor, that was when all my resentment started... All these years, I've been training hard in my sword skills and cultivated Sword Dao. I believe senior brother is already no longer my opponent. However..."</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God realized at that very moment that he had run into an even greater challenge than a confrontation with his Senior Brother General Yi Jianchuan.</p>

    <p>Everything he had done back then had been purely for the sake of proving his strength. He had killed his <em>shifu </em>and had practiced his sword skills diligently in order to be able to kill his Senior Brother Yi Jianchuan one day in a single move.</p>

    <p>But today, it was obvious that he had run into an even greater opponent.</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God took a deep breath and quickly calmed his thoughts.</p>

    <p>Whatever the case, he had to get serious.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God stood up and True Immortal spirit power surged over his entire body to visibly and swiftly heal his injuries.</p>

    <p>In a lot of cases when one side was at a disadvantage, especially in combat, many people would choose to take elixirs in order to be able to continue fighting. But Evil Sword God was different as his pride wouldn't allow him to do so.</p>

    <p>He thought he was almost invincible in the art of Sword Dao and no one could surpass him in it!</p>

    <p>"Sword spirit contract!" He performed hand seals to forcibly control the power of the contract.</p>

    <p>The Heaven-Cleaving sword in Wang Ling's hand instantly turned into light particles that re-coalesced in Evil Sword God's hand.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling had seized the two spirit swords, he hadn't erased the power of their contracts, and Evil Sword God had taken advantage of this fact.</p>

    <p>But none of this mattered...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling could see that this Evil Sword God was confident in the art of Sword Dao. Since that was the case, he should also use the same art of Sword Dao in a counterattack, and splendidly crush the confidence of this type of person.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling..." Lord Diulei asked, "What should we do now?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling reached out and a space fissure straightaway appeared in the air.</p>

    <p>He then directly pulled a peach wood spirit sword out of the fissure...</p>

    <p>Without saying anything, Wang Ling directly tossed Jingke into Lord Diulei's hands...</p>

    <p>The instant he received Jingke, Lord Diulei's hands trembled.</p>

    <p><em>Go cut him down...</em></p>

    <p>Wang Ling pointed straight at Evil Sword God and spoke telepathically to Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>He didn't say any unnecessary rubbish.</p>

    <p>If Lord Diulei couldn't hack him to death... it could be considered his defeat!</p>
