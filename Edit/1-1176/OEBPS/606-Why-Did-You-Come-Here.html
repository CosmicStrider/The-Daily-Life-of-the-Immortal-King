  <h1>Chapter 606 Why Did You Come Here?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Er Ha never thought that Elder Wen would make up his own scenario like this... For a moment, it didn't know how to reply.</p>

    <p>In the current situation, it would definitely be impossible for Er Ha to acknowledge him as someone he knew... That would only add to Elder Wen's embarrassment. So, since that was the case, it would be better for Elder Wen to continue misunderstanding...</p>

    <p>After thinking for a bit, Er Ha made up a plausible excuse. It stared at Elder Wen and pretended to mutter, "It's my disciple..."</p>

    <p>This reason shocked Elder Wen as his face drained of color. Seeing that Elder Wen had been fooled, Er Ha went on to make up a cock and bull story. "Your king certainly isn't dead. It's the bravest and most handsome disciple I've ever had..."</p>

    <p>Elder Wen gaped with his mouth wide open; he hadn't expected "Senior Dog" to speak so highly of Tenth Generation.</p>

    <p>"However, its body was indeed destroyed, and is currently being rebuilt. Previously, it sensed in a prophetic dream that the Tuntian Ha clan would suffer a calamity; several times, it tried to run away from me to come back here..."</p>

    <p>Elder Wen was extremely heartbroken and his eyes were red... It turned out that he had misunderstood Tenth Generation!</p>

    <p>"This old servant is wrong; I actually said such wicked things about Tenth Generation..." Elder Wen lowered his head and sighed. He looked at Er Ha. "Senior Dog, may I ask..."</p>

    <p>"I came of my own accord, and didn't tell him I would be coming," Er Ha said.</p>

    <p>"Senior Dog, then why did you come here... there should be no reason for you to make a move personally for us..."</p>

    <p>"Indeed, I didn't make a move." The Sound-Proofing Spell was transparent, and Er Ha turned his eyes to Zhenyuan, who stood waiting on the outside.</p>

    <p>Elder Wen: "..."</p>

    <p>"As for why I came... Let me give you a poem."</p>

    <p>Er Ha said, "When I have nothing to do, when I am bored, when I want to, I go to a place, a different place, and I came here, to take a look, a different place, a lot, a lot <sup>1</sup> ..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is taken from an interview with the friend of a contestant on "The Voice of China" who had been asked why he had gone to the show. Someone online turned it into a poem that went viral ..)</dfn>

    <p>Elder Wen: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the end of their conversation, Er Ha left the Sound-Proofing Spell's barrier. Although it ultimately didn't reveal that it knew Elder Wen, Er Ha thought that maybe this was actually also a good ending.</p>

    <p>"Senior Dog is done talking?" The horned Sage Master looked at Er Ha and gave a bow.</p>

    <p>Looking at Elder Wen, who had sat down not far away to ponder the meaning of the poem, he raised one eyebrow meaningfully.</p>

    <p>"Then shall we leave now?" Sage Master asked.</p>

    <p>"Mm." Er Ha nodded.</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan: "How will we get there?"</p>

    <p>Sage Master smiled. "If the average person wants to see Demon Saint, they have to climb the holy stairs inside the Holy Pillar. There is a second way, of course, which is what I used to personally come down and pick you up."</p>

    <p>"Demon Saint can't do so?" Zhenyuan asked.</p>

    <p>"Once you have been chosen as Demon Saint, you're not allowed to leave the top of the Holy Pillar without permission, and can only move around Demon Saint's Holy Palace."</p>

    <p>So pitiful...</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan and Er Ha both sweated. Now Er Ha finally knew the reason why so few of the many demon gods and demon kings in the demon world had seen Demon Saint's true face; it turned out that Demon Saint just couldn't come down... Now that it knew the truth, Er Ha instantly pitied Demon Saint a little.</p>

    <p>If those demon gods of the demon world found out that to take up the post of Demon Saint was to lose your freedom, who knew, they might give up looking for a way to be promoted to Demon Saint...</p>

    <p>Sometimes, nothing was more important than freedom. To possess formidable strength but lose your freedom - anyone confronted with this type of choice would think twice.</p>

    <p>No matter how good-looking you were, if you were the only person in the entire world, what damn use was it?!</p>

    <p>"That's right, what's your name?" Zhenyuan looked at the horned Sage Master.</p>

    <p>"I am Shen Wuyue. Seniors, you can also call me Little Shen," Sage Master said. "Then let's head out now. We'll have to use a magic artifact in order to be directly transported to the top of the Holy Pillar. However, only I can use this magic artifact."</p>

    <p>Er Ha and Zhenyuan initially planned to ask what the magic artifact Sage Master would be using was. In the end, before they could say anything, they saw Sage Master pull his antlers off his head.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan: "Are they fake?"</p>

    <p>Shen Wuyue, with gold antlers in one hand and silver antlers in the other, shook his head and smiled. "No, they're real."</p>

    <p>Then, Er Ha and Zhenyuan heard the sound of a crisp "piu," and fresh blood shot out like a fountain from where the antlers had been plucked out.</p>

    <p>Er Ha and Zhenyuan: "..."</p>

    <p>This was a little too much blood...</p>

    <p>It reminded Er Ha of a movie called "Kill Bill."</p>

    <p>Then Shen Wuyue merged the golden antlers and the silver antlers together. The moment they fused, a radiant light was released and a magic transportation ring formed in front of Shen Wuyue.</p>

    <p>He threw the antlers to one side and made a welcoming gesture to the magic ring. "Please step inside, seniors."</p>

    <p>Looking at the antlers that had been cast aside, Zhenyuan was startled. "You don't want your antlers anymore?"</p>

    <p>"Transference to the top of the Holy Pillar demands quite a lot of magic power, so I usually store my demon energy in my antlers in advance. Usually, it can only support one transmission spell." Shen Wuyue smiled as blood poured out of his head. "But it's fine; in any case, my antlers will grow back the next day."</p>

    <p>Er Ha and Zhenyuan: "..."</p>

    <p>Shen Wuyue this old man, was a little bizarre...</p>

    <p>Shen Wuyue: "It's just that before they grow back, the bleeding won't stop."</p>

    <p>"!!!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha and Zhenyuan were alarmed.</p>

    <p><em>Are you sure you won't die?!</em></p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After entering the magic transportation ring, Er Ha and Zhenyuan very quickly arrived at the top of the Holy Pillar.</p>

    <p>During the whole process, Er Ha completely avoided looking directly at the Holy Pillar, for fear of otherwise discovering that it was completely unable to control the "prehistoric powers" between its legs...</p>

    <p>When Er Ha appeared on the top of the Holy Pillar, this strange feeling of wanting to piss disappeared.</p>

    <p>Gazing at this place which it had once dreamed of setting foot in one day, Er Ha in the end felt a little disappointed.</p>

    <p>Because the top of the Holy Pillar was really too small... It was a circular plaza, the borders of which could be seen, and Demon Saint's Holy Palace was in the middle. The palace also looked plain, like an old church; it had stained glass windows all around that shone with colorful light.</p>

    <p>It could be said that both the top of the Holy Pillar and Demon Saint's Holy Palace were vastly different from what Er Ha had imagined.</p>

    <p>Moreover, Demon Saint's freedom was restricted to the size of this plaza, and Er Ha suddenly felt that to be Demon Saint was actually very miserable...</p>

    <p>It was said that all of Demon Saint's power was inherited; even if your talent was poor, it didn't matter as long as you were chosen. However, looking at the gap between imagination and reality now, Er Ha felt that it would rather not have this kind of power...</p>

    <p>Basking in the sun in the yard, going out to buy groceries with Mother Wang or the old man, swindling some money out of Xiao Yin, playing cute with Little Master Ling... and when it had nothing to do it could lift Sheep's skirt and tease Jingke in passing â€” this was more interesting!</p>
