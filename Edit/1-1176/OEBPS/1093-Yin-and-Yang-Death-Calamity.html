  <h1>Chapter 1093 Yin and Yang Death Calamity</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The assistant sighed silently - so the chairman had actually been asking about the boy's age.</p>

    <p>It was his thinking that was too dirty!</p>

    <p>It was those old-timers in the company who had led him astray during team-building activities in past years... the slightest hint would make him automatically think of something dirty. That group proclaimed that life was full of bitterness, when really, it was the people that got a kick out of sexual innuendo who were the root of all evil.</p>

    <p>The assistant recalled Wang Ling's birthday, but just like earlier, he couldn't utter it even though it was clearly on the tip of his tongue. Helpless, he could only make up a date. "I remember it's at the end of the year? He was born in the same year as the young lady."</p>

    <p>"The end of the year..." Old Man Sun pondered; he didn't expect the boy whom his granddaughter liked to have an unexpectedly compatible birth date.</p>

    <p>"Do you remember the divination by the Master Immortal the year Rongrong was born?"</p>

    <p>"Chairman, are you saying..." The assistant was startled. This matter was actually a family secret which he, as a mere assistant, shouldn't know about. However, he had been by Old Man Sun's side for a very long time, and when the old man was feeling vexed or depressed, he would sometimes vent to his assistant.</p>

    <p>"'When Yin and Yang fall into chaos, our Mo blood will paint the sky.'" Old Man Sun's thoughts spun as he recalled what that famous Master Immortal had divined back then.</p>

    <p>The fact that Sun Rong had this so-called "Yin and Yang Death Calamity" wasn't a secret in the family, but a lot of people thought it was nonsense.</p>

    <p>Although the death calamity had yet to come to pass, Old Man Sun had always firmly believed in it. That was because the Master Immortal had said it clearly back then: the calamity would have something to do with love.</p>

    <p>In other words, it was possible that this problem would occur once Rongrong started dating... The most important thing was that this seemed to be initial confirmation of the Yin and Yang Death Calamity omen.</p>

    <p>Old Man Sun gazed at the image on the screen and paid close attention to the fight between Wang Ling and Xia Ming.</p>

    <p>Back then, that Master Immortal had said that the person who cast the curse was born at the beginning of the year, and the person to break it was born at the end of the year.</p>

    <p>And it just so happened that these two young men who were around the same age as Sun Rong were fighting for her affections. While it had yet to be verified whether the Yin and Yang Death Calamity was real or not, Old Man Sun suddenly could hardly wait.</p>

    <p>"Is there any information on Xia Ming?"</p>

    <p>"We've already started investigating, and we should get word very soon," answered the assistant.</p>

    <p>At that moment, they looked at the screen once more, where it seemed that the fight between Xia Ming and Wang Ling was going to happen at any moment.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>There were two elite classes in Number 60 High. To be able to study in the same class as Fang Xing, Xia Ming naturally wouldn't be weak; he was a top student who was outstanding in his studies, and was an A-class existence in the eyes of the teachers. If a student from a regular class faced off against Xia Ming, their chances of winning would naturally be very low.</p>

    <p>But his opponent was Wang Ling, and only those who knew Wang Ling's true combat strength were keenly aware of the gap between them.</p>

    <p>On the side, Zhenyuan, Gu Shunzhi, Liu Qingyi and Wang Zhen all sighed emotionally. Standing amidst the ranks of students, they used a telepathy spell to communicate with each other.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi: "I didn't expect Senior Wang to actually accept this challenge; I'm really curious to know how he's going to handle this match."</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen nodded. "The gap in strength is too big: unless Senior Wang fakes it, there's no way this Xia Ming will be able to withstand one puff of air from Senior Wang." The terrifying impression of Wang Ling's might was practically carved into Wang Zhen's brain.</p>

    <p>As experts from the Domain of the Gods, they couldn't even exchange more than three blows with Wang Ling, to say nothing of a mere Foundation Establishment student. Win? Even pulling Wang Ling's head off wouldn't defeat him!</p>

    <p>Xia Ming gazed at Wang Ling and pondered what technique to use to defeat Wang Ling in the most ruthless way possible.</p>

    <p>There were only two elite classes, which had a total of forty students. Xia Ming was ranked third overall, while Wang Ling was in twentieth place. What could a completely average student use to fight Xia Ming? Win? Even pulling Xia Ming's head off wouldn't defeat him!</p>

    <p>Xia Ming took a deep breath, and spirit energy slowly started to accumulate in his dantian as pure white energy flowed around him.</p>

    <p>When a cultivator gathered spirit energy together, the color it exhibited was affected by the cultivator's spirit root — this was the "spirit qi color principle." Xia Ming's spirit qi was pure white, which was a complete surprise to a lot of the student onlookers.</p>

    <p>"Pure white spirit qi?"</p>

    <p>"I remember; isn't this Xia Ming..."</p>

    <p>"Oh! Is he a descendant of that Ancient Divine Clan?"</p>

    <p>"Ancient Divine Clan?"</p>

    <p>Even a number of teachers in the teaching building were surprised.</p>

    <p>"This is..." Wang Zhen narrowed his eyes and instantly made a guess.</p>

    <p>"No mistake: it's the Ancient Divine Clan." Liu Qingyi nodded.</p>

    <p>Within the bounds of telepathic communication between the four individuals, Gu Shunzhi was also secretly astonished at the level of power that Xia Ming was displaying. "A descendant of the Ancient Divine Clan — how interesting!"</p>

    <p>"Who would have thought that there actually are descendants of the Ancient Divine Clan on Earth." Zhenyuan tsked.</p>

    <p>The so-called Ancient Divine Clan wasn't a family, but a collective name for the earliest batch of cultivators in the Spirit Energy era, and Xia Ming's Xia family was a member of this Ancient Divine Clan.</p>

    <p>But there were a lot of people with the surname Xia on Earth, and not all of them were descendants of the Ancient Divine Clan. The difference was that members of the Ancient Divine Clan had unique spirit roots which had the power to resonate with underground spirit veins.</p>

    <p>The spirit energy of underground spirit veins was incredibly pure. When these spirit veins resonated with an Ancient Divine Clan member's spirit root, perfect, pure white spirit energy would be created.</p>

    <p>Xia Ming's identity as a descendant of the Ancient Divine Clan took a lot of the people present by surprise. Many of them suddenly recalled how Xia Ming seemed to be deliberately hiding something every time he used magic. Looking back on it now, Xia Ming must have used a special technique to suppress the reaction between the underground spirit veins and his own spirit root in order to conceal his identity as a descendant of the Ancient Divine Clan.</p>

    <p>Now that Xia Ming's identity was laid bare, the entire scene was in an uproar.</p>

    <p>When a descendant of the Ancient Divine Clan achieved resonance with underground spirit veins, their spirit energy basically wouldn't run out in a fight between equal realms. In other words, Xia Ming could hold on for a very, very long time before he ran out of energy.</p>

    <p>What did Foundation Establishment cultivators fear the most?</p>

    <p>Wars of attrition!</p>

    <p>Foundation Establishment cultivators had limited spirit energy; it was very easy for them to exhaust their spirit energy when they used magic — simply put, their MP<sup>1</sup> was too low... In Xia Ming's case, his MP was quite low, but it could be replenished as he fought.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Mana points..)</dfn>

    <p>Now, the audience instantly switched to cheering for Xia Ming. For most of them, there was basically no chance of Wang Ling winning against Xia Ming.</p>

    <p>Whether it was overall study ranking or unique physique, Wang Ling appeared too ordinary in all respects, compared with Xia Ming's identity as a descendant of the Ancient Divine Clan.</p>
