  <h1>Chapter 691 The Disparity In Strength</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The corner of President Bai's mouth twitched in bafflement. This youngster clearly hadn't used his true strength when their palms met just now. Although President Bai had spewed blood under that palm just now, he recovered in almost an instant without even an internal injury left behind. He had an extremely resilient physique to begin with, and wasn't afraid of being injured at all.</p>

    <p>But he stared at this scene in front of him in disbelief. Of all the techniques he had mastered, his Detachment of the Primitive World Palm was ranked third... he couldn't believe that this technique which contained a massive space-destroying force actually hadn't injured this youngster at all.</p>

    <p>How could his palm technique fail? No way... this person was just trying to be brave!</p>

    <p>At that moment, countless thoughts crowded President Bai's mind, and he didn't even have time to think about the meaning of what the youngster had said.</p>

    <p>Did such an Almighty figure still need to do homework?</p>

    <p>All of a sudden, President Bai's mind felt like it was a mess.</p>

    <p>He didn't believe that the other party wasn't injured even a little from his last attack. In terms of pure damage, not only was his palm fatal, it was also exceedingly destructive. No matter how formidable a person's recovery ability was, it was impossible to completely recover from injuries caused by a spatial technique in the short term; this was a type of injury which was more terrible than the "major damage" state.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's nonchalant palm earlier wasn't lethal, but the terrifying thing was that he had directly neutralized the damage from President Bai's spatial palm technique.</p>

    <p>President Bai's loan transaction with Night Ghost Spirit Emperor had been successful, and he had traded his lifespan in exchange for boosting his strength to late True Immortal level for a brief period of time. Although his last palm hadn't contained one hundred-percent of his strength, it shouldn't be so bad as to cause no injuries at all to the other party â€” the other party, had to be putting on a brave face! Right! He was definitely just acting brave.</p>

    <p>There was no way President Bai would admit nor believe that his attack had actually been neutralized... In this world, it was impossible for someone stronger than a True Immortal to exist! Even... even Immortal Zhenyuan who was said to have already reached the heights of a Venerated Immortal was only a legend! Many people hadn't even seen his face!</p>

    <p>President Bai's breathing had already unconsciously started to speed up, not because he was feeling tired, but purely because of nerves.</p>

    <p>Even in this situation, he still showed no signs of admitting defeat.</p>

    <p>Seeing this, Wang Ling sighed silently. Sometimes, it was indeed very difficult for people to acknowledge the disparity with others.</p>

    <p>This required a person to recognize his true strength in his heart; in other words, whether or not they were smart enough to understand...</p>

    <p>It was very obvious that President Bai wasn't.</p>

    <p>There were times when a person needed to clearly see themselves for who they were...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling gazed deeply at President Bai.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had to admit that compared with his former opponents, President Bai was a little unique.</p>

    <p>After enduring Wang Ling's somewhat half-hearted palm, the other party could actually recover in a flash. Even Evil Sword God and the Old Devil could only hope to match this type of self-healing ability.</p>

    <p>In other words, even if Wang Ling was a little fiercer with his palm, President Bai wouldn't die so easily.</p>

    <p>Actually, Wang Ling had felt pretty depressed in the previous battles, since he felt that his hands were tied during the fights.</p>

    <p>The law had always been Wang Ling's first choice.</p>

    <p>In an orderly age of cultivation, if everything was resolved through slaughter, that only proved that that generation was a failure. If one created rules, one had to abide by them. To be frank, Wang Ling felt that he was still young and it absolutely wouldn't be good to stain his hands with too much blood.</p>

    <p>Thinking this, he sighed heavily and started to walk toward President Bai step by step.</p>

    <p>The moment Wang Ling took his first step, President Bai already felt immeasurable pressure as if the whole of Mount Tai had directly dropped onto his shoulders! This youngster's aura had completely changed, flaring up sharply several times over!</p>

    <p>It was just the first step, but President Bai jolted and spat blood!</p>

    <p>"How can this be..."</p>

    <p>While President Bai was feeling stupefied, Wang Ling had already taken his second step.</p>

    <p>At the same time, this magic artifact's entire internal space started to stir with massive fluctuations. This was an independent world which President Bai had set up with the Wuji Umbrella's power, completely separated from the outside! The structure of this entire space was extremely stable! But the youngster's second step had directly affected the walls of this entire space.</p>

    <p>Endless cracks stretched out in a domino effect, splitting open the space in all directions. Strong gales of space wind swirled out through the fissures to tear the space apart without end.</p>

    <p>Directly destroying the space with just one step... How was that possible?!</p>

    <p>With the space being torn apart by this tremendous power, President Bai felt that the situation was already completely out of control; he was like the clay Bodhisattva<sup>1</sup> who couldn't save himself while crossing the river. The power ripping the space apart was too terrifying, and more and more cracks showed up around him, pulling at his body. The only thing President Bai could do was roar at Wang Ling, "Are you insane?! You'll kill yourself too, doing this!"</p>
        
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Reminder, 'Bodhisattva' in Buddhism are enlightened beings who have put off entering paradise in order to help others attain enlightenment.)</dfn>

    <p>He couldn't understand why this youngster would straightaway use this space-destroying technique where neither side would win! This was an independent space which he had set up using the Wuji Umbrella; if it continued to be wrecked, and in the end directly exploded, it would be over for the both of them!</p>

    <p>At that time, even if they didn't die but turned into pulps of flesh drifting in space, they wouldn't be able to return to their original world.</p>

    <p>You actually used this technique to take me down with you?</p>

    <p>President Bai broke out in a cold sweat, frightened by Wang Ling's "viciousness," and his complexion couldn't help turning deathly white.</p>

    <p>But this was far from the only thing to stupefy him.</p>

    <p>Because at that moment, he saw Wang Ling take his third step!</p>

    <p>In that instant, there were countless space rifts in the world and it was already on the verge of collapsing. However, the rifts that appeared next to the youngster were actually completely patched up...</p>

    <p>The youngster raised his hand slightly, and the space rifts suddenly transformed into tens of millions of vipers which lunged forward to bite President Bai!</p>

    <p>It was only now that President Bai realized: this young man didn't want to kill both of them... he had broken the space open to manipulate the space rifts into tearing him to shreds!</p>

    <p>He was going to die!</p>

    <p>President Bai was struck with despair.</p>

    <p>In the instant that these countless space rifts darted at him like vipers about to bite him, he subconsciously held up one hand to fend them off. But just as he raised his hand, everything in front of him returned to a dead calm.</p>

    <p>"What..."</p>

    <p>He was stunned by this technique.</p>

    <p>Breaking open the space and fixing it at will...</p>

    <p>Was this the youngster's true strength?</p>

    <p>"You think it'll just end like this?"</p>

    <p>While President Bai was feeling despondent, Wang Ling spoke to him telepathically.</p>

    <p>After that, he unzipped his school jacket and put it away properly, his eyes fixed on President Bai.</p>

    <p>President Bai didn't understand the meaning behind this action, but after the youngster took the jacket off, he saw him put his hand up one of his short sleeves, and seemed to be pulling at something...</p>

    <p>"Heavenly Eye!"</p>

    <p>President Bai opened his power of sight to see through the youngster's action.</p>

    <p>He finally realized that there was actually a seal stuck on this youngster's arm inside the sleeve.</p>

    <p>Also, half the seal had been pulled off...</p>
