  <h1>Chapter 730 Artificial Intelligence!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>While a violent battle was raging in the fake remains, all was peaceful inside the real remains.</p>

    <p>It was the calm before the storm. Wang Ling followed the main group as they began to tour the base station inside the real remains. A lot of extinct resource specimens from inside the remains had been harvested and were documented here. It had all kinds of spirit plants, and was an eye-opener.</p>

    <p>Each spirit plant was individually protected, and the temperature inside each incubator was regulated at the level most suited for the plant's growth.</p>

    <p>The most impressive-looking spirit plant was one called "Fire Lotus Mix." In ordinary conditions, this Fire Lotus Mix was pure white in appearance and grew unsullied out of the mud. However, when the temperature increased, the petals of the white lotus flower would slowly start to wilt.</p>

    <p>Having said that, the white lotus didn't die right away... It still clung tenaciously to life despite its extremely withered appearance! In the end, the white lotus completely transcended the secular world to evolve into its true form as a Fire Lotus Mix!</p>

    <p>High temperatures didn't affect the Fire Lotus Mix; it could survive even in extremely red-hot conditions. At the end of its life, it would even directly pollinate its surroundings to produce new white lotus flowers.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming deliberately separated from Wang Ling so that those two young masters wouldn't find Wang Ling. Li Mingyao and Zhou Youzheng were also busy...</p>

    <p>While observing spirit plants with the group, they didn't forget to look for a chance to ask for the room number of that Teacher "Wang Xiaoer" in the Rainbow Glass Box. They really wanted to apologize to him!</p>

    <p>"Classmate, do you know the zone and room number of Lao Gudong Xiaoer?" As they were looking around, Li Mingyao suddenly put his arm around Su Xiao's shoulders.</p>

    <p>Su Xiao nodded. "You mean Lao Gudong Xiaoer? Yes!"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Li Mingyao and Zhou Youzheng were delighted.</p>

    <p>But because this was related to Wang Ling, Su Xiao's memory very quickly started to become spotty due to the Great Shielding Spell. "Whoops, what room is Lao Gudong Xiaoer in?"</p>

    <p>Li Mingyao and Zhou Youzheng: "..."</p>

    <p>A moment later, Su Xiao scratched his head. "Sorry, I forgot."</p>

    <p>Li Mingyao and Zhou Youzheng: "..."</p>

    <p>This perhaps happened to everyone; there were times when you wanted to say something, but in the next second you suddenly forgot what you wanted to say...</p>

    <p>Thus, it wasn't like Li Mingyao and Zhou Youzheng couldn't understand.</p>

    <p>But the point was that Su Xiao was the eighth person they had asked!!!</p>

    <p>And while everyone looked like they knew at first, in the blink of an eye, they would forget in the end... What the hell!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The plan in the afternoon was to tour the eastern forest in the fake remains. The research team was directly divided into two groups, one of which was responsible for the development of the western region. In the whole remains, only the eastern region had been completely explored, while the western region remained a blank.</p>

    <p>Frankly speaking, the summer camp for broadening the students' horizons was incidental - the real bulk of the activity was still to research and protect Beast King's Remains.</p>

    <p>Beast King's Remains didn't open all the time, so the research team naturally wanted to firmly grasp this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p>

    <p>Apart from the research group exploring the western region, roughly a third of the remaining research group accompanied the students and teachers, since no one knew the spirit plants in the eastern region better than the experts in the research team.</p>

    <p>There were two reasons why they accompanied the students.</p>

    <p>On one hand, it would be easy to explain about the spirit plants to them.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, it was for the students' protection. If a student was accidentally poisoned while surveying the forest, the group of experts could very quickly cooperate with the medical team to give relevant advice for treatment.</p>

    <p>The afternoon forest activity also had a session which all the students were eagerly looking forward to — pitching a tent!</p>

    <p>A summer camp without tents was a camp without soul!</p>

    <p>However, taking the environment into account, Huaxiu Alliance had actually prepared special camping tents for the students' safety. The reason why students hadn't been allowed to bring their own tents was that the Alliance was worried that the safety features of their tents wouldn't be up to standard and would easily cause danger.</p>

    <p>The students on this summer camp cheered up instantly. The fun of pitching a tent together, especially with people you knew, wasn't something a lone camper would understand. It was twice as fun pitching a tent with people you were close to or even someone you had a crush on.</p>

    <p>But as the students were happily setting up the tents on one side...</p>

    <p>There were two people who were feeling anxious on the other side.</p>

    <p>One of them was President Dylan, who was hiding in the medical team.</p>

    <p>He had just received the news that the Night Chief members and the Dark Network members who had been dispatched to the fake remains... would possibly be caught in one fell swoop.</p>

    <p>This could almost be said to be an unprecedented crackdown unlike anything before, which left President Dylan in deep thought.</p>

    <p>Because of this issue with the real and fake remains, when President Dylan had taken over the mess that President Bai had left behind, the army which had been temporarily established had already lost half of its fighting strength...</p>

    <p>If things continued in this vein, it wouldn't be good for them.</p>

    <p>President Dylan gazed darkly at the young man in the white coat up ahead — this was their bargaining chip...</p>

    <p>In light of the current situation, President Dylan felt that he couldn't afford to delay any longer.</p>

    <p>They had to take action as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Besides President Dylan, the other person who was fretting was Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>The military tent used by the teachers was a compressed version of one that had already been set up and could straightaway be used as soon as it was taken out.</p>

    <p>At that very moment, Wang Ming was making modifications to Head of State 001.</p>

    <p>Although Head of State 001's status was invisible, this summer camp was its first trial run. As the designer who had drawn up the blueprint himself for Head of State 001 at the very beginning, this trial run was of great importance to Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ming somehow felt that this Head of State 001 was a little different from his initial design.</p>

    <p>Although there was no difference in its overall function, and it very obediently followed his commands...</p>

    <p>The crucial point... was that this Head of State 001 seemed especially intelligent.</p>

    <p>There were even some details which were slowly emerging.</p>

    <p>Such as its eyelids fluttering and its eyelashes trembling... These minute expressions shouldn't be this precise on a humanoid magic treasure.</p>

    <p>In the military tent, Wang Ming gazed at the head of state pretending to be Head of State 001, and the both of them eyed each other.</p>

    <p>The head of state: "..."</p>

    <p>The more he looked, the more amazed Wang Ming felt, because after staring at it for a while... he noticed that Head of State 001 was actually sweating!</p>

    <p>What the heck!!!</p>

    <p>Was this the evolution of artificial intelligence?!</p>

    <p>Wang Ming turned pale with shock.</p>

    <p>What a momentous discovery.</p>

    <p>He had to record this down as soon as possible!</p>
