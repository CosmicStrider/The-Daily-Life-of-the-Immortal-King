  <h1>Chapter 824 I Think of You as a Brother, but You Want To...</h1>

  <div>

    <p>General Yi had been possessed. This scene caught everyone off guard.</p>

    <p>"That's impossible!"</p>

    <p>Battle Saint Marshal Jiang shook his head. "Blademaster has cultivated Boundless Sword Dao for years; his sword heart is clear, there's no way anything can invade it!"</p>

    <p>Marshal Jiang didn't dare believe the scene before his eyes. If you asked who among the Ten Generals understood Blademaster the most, Marshal Jiang felt that as a rival who constantly sparred with General Yi, his familiarity with and understanding of General Yi was second only to what he knew of himself. The conditions for cultivating Boundless Sword Dao were very strict, and you couldn't be the slightest bit distracted or have wicked thoughts. In order to successfully master Boundless Sword Dao back then, General Yi had suffered a lot.</p>

    <p>To endure hardships which an ordinary person couldn't was what made him a great general.</p>

    <p>"Battle Saint, the truth is in front of your eyes, it's useless to deny it any longer." Explosion Saint frowned. "This Ultimate King of Killers is a little strange; when you're fighting him, take care not to get close. It should be safe to use long-range attacks."</p>

    <p>"Sis Luo, can you identify what spell this Ultimate King of Killers is using?" Marshal Jiang asked in a low voice as he frowned deeply.</p>

    <p>In fact, the instant Medicine Saint saw General Yi taken over, she had already performed the Mind-Clearing Spell, but unfortunately, it didn't work at all.</p>

    <p>"The moment Old Yi was possessed, I already cast the level seven Mind-Clearing Spell to try and purify his abnormal state, but it doesn't seem to have worked." Medicine Saint said, "I can only assume now that this isn't one of the abnormal spells."</p>

    <p>The faces of the Ten Generals turned a little dark. These irregular conditions told them that this Ultimate King of Killers indeed wasn't a simple person.</p>

    <p>"Ultimate King of Killers, did you deliberately choose today to take your revenge for being locked up in Sky Prison, so that you could do it in front of these sect leaders and the media?"</p>

    <p>"I have waited a long time for this day." King of Killers's voice sounded out of place coming out of General Yi's body.</p>

    <p>"You won't get away with it now."</p>

    <p>President Qi stood up and said, "The second you attacked Old Yi, I used the Brain Deduction Technique to brainwash everyone behind you. What they're seeing now is Old Yi sending you flying out of the intrinsic spirit field and spitting blood. Furthermore, this scene will replay in a continuous brainwashing loop in their minds..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>King of Killers's pupils contracted at President Qi's words before he sneered. "As expected of Wisdom Saint... Apart from Old Yi, you also played a role in locking me up in Sky Prison back then."</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, he waved his hand. "But that doesn't matter now. Wisdom Saint, I recall that as long as you're severely injured or die, your Brain Deduction Technique will be cut short. So, none of you will be able to escape today... All of you will die. But before I make a move, let me remind everyone."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, the faces of the Ten Generals froze.</p>

    <p>Ultimate King of Killers said with an expressionless face, "I'm borrowing General Yi's body right now. Attacking me is the same as attacking General Yi."</p>

    <p>"King of Killers, this is despicable!" Battle Saint was filled with anger.</p>

    <p>"Winner takes all, the rest is bullshit." Ultimate King of Killers chuckled.</p>

    <p>Battle Saint took a deep breath and glared at him, clearly enraged. "Even if General Yi fell into your trap, we Ten Generals aren't pushovers... We are Huaxiu's elites."</p>

    <p>"Elites?"</p>

    <p>Ultimate King of Killers laughed maliciously. "It is precisely the elites that I want to defeat!"</p>

    <p>He barely finished speaking when, with a wave of his hand, the air in front of him instantly warped.</p>

    <p>In the blink of an eye, he vanished in General Yi's body along with Marshal Jiang.</p>

    <p>"What kind of spell is this..." Lord Diulei stared blankly. That move just now was clearly General Yi's intrinsic spirit field, and Ultimate King of Killers was actually able to use General Yi's magic while he was inside the latter's body.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling... what should we do?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei turned his face to look at Ling Zhenren on his left side and Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch on his right as he asked the question telepathically.</p>

    <p>This King of Killers was too strange...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei already couldn't think of anyone else who could contain the situation at the moment apart from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Actually, Wang Ling already knew the spell Ultimate King of Killers was using; it was just that he couldn't explain it right then.</p>

    <p>This wasn't an ordinary spell for possessing a person's body, since such a spell, classified as an abnormal spell, could be dispelled by the Mind-Clearing Spell.</p>

    <p>What Ultimate King of Killers was using was a more powerful and unusual type of spell that was based on the body possession spell, called the "Anti-Last Hit Spell."</p>

    <p>The real reason why General Yi had fallen into the enemy's hands wasn't because of his terrifying attack, but because of the final blow he had been about to deal to Ultimate King of Killers.</p>

    <p>This was a spell that allowed you to fight back when you were on the brink of death.</p>

    <p>As long as the spellcaster could sense the malice in the final blow just as he was about to die, he could temporarily engulf the soul of the attacker and thus take over the latter's body.</p>

    <p>So, when all was said and done, this "Anti-Last Hit Spell" was nothing more than a slightly advanced version of the body possession technique...</p>

    <p>This spell was practically unknown to most people because it belonged to a lesser branch of magic.</p>

    <p>But it so happened that Wang Ling knew how to use it himself.</p>

    <p>Also, when Wang Ling possessed someone, he did it neatly - whoever he wanted to possess, he possessed; there was no point in it being so complicated.</p>

    <p>So the next moment, Wang Ling manipulated the clone Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch into putting his hand on Lord Diulei's shoulder.</p>

    <p>Using a clone to pass along his soul and possess a body wasn't an especially difficult technique.</p>

    <p>Although he was still at school, today was the sect's founding ceremony, after all. Since someone had come to stir up trouble, as the leader of the crispy noodles hall... ah, no, as the leader of the recreation hall, he should also do his part.</p>

    <p>In any case, it would only take him two minutes to resolve the fight...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>A few seconds later, Wang Ling's soul was successfully passed on to Lord Diulei's body, and Lord Diulei's aura changed dramatically.</p>

    <p>It was a fantastic feeling to be ridden...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei remembered when he had been possessed the last time; in the fight with Evil Sword God, it was Lord Jingke who had ridden his body.</p>

    <p>And now, it was his best brother who was riding him...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei felt himself very blessed!</p>

    <p>Sensing the change in Lord Diulei's aura, the Ten Generals were greatly shaken.</p>

    <p>Who would have thought everything was as they had suspected?</p>

    <p>This Great Death-Courting Senior really did turn out to be a hidden expert!</p>

    <p>There was nothing else to say.</p>

    <p>"I'll be right back..."</p>

    <p>After Lord Diulei and Wang Ling combined, it was still Lord Diulei's voice, but Wang Ling was already in charge of the body.</p>

    <p>Under everyone's stupefied gazes, this Great Death-Courting Senior, who had hidden himself very well, lifted one hand and directly tore open the space in front of them, before stepping into the intrinsic spirit field that King of Killers had set up after possessing General Yi's body.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Marshal Jiang was already locked in a fierce battle inside the intrinsic spirit field.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, it wasn't too late yet...</p>
