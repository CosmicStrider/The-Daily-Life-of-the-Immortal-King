  <h1>Chapter 715 Devil Disciples</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Roughly five minutes later, Luo Chuang finally arrived on the scene. Unlike what other people drove, he rode an electric motorbike, and he gave it a very nice-sounding name: Rolling Wheels.</p>

    <p>Of course, Luo Chuang had carefully modified this electric motorbike. It looked like an ordinary electric motorbike, but it wasn't as simple as it appeared.</p>

    <p>When he approached the square, Luo Chuang manipulated the electric motorbike so that the front wheel suddenly lifted up!</p>

    <p>â€” Cyclone Charger Tornado!</p>

    <p>The jet mechanism at the back of Rolling Wheels was instantly activated and two blasts of what looked like Hyper Beams shot out as the electric motorbike jumped high into the sky!</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>Wuji: "..."</p>

    <p>"Sorry to keep you waiting!" Luo Chuang flew directly over to everyone and scratched the back of his head very apologetically.</p>

    <p>Today, he was still dressed as flashily as before, in his eye-catching white undershirt and large underpants.</p>

    <p>"Teacher Luo is dressed the same as ever, hahaha." Zhuo Yi laughed.</p>

    <p>However, Luo Chuang shook his head. "No, it's actually different. This white undershirt and large underpants I'm wearing aren't ordinary. Since we're entering the remains this time, I prepared specially for it. So, this white undershirt and large underpants are special, and are number 190331!"</p>

    <p>"What does this number mean?"</p>

    <p>"This is my white undershirt and large underpants set number 190331!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang smiled. "I had to be well-prepared in advance, didn't I? So I specially added protection against poison, water, fire and insects to this set number 190331. Whether it's the undershirt or underpants, they can instantly absorb any toxic substances that touch the body and neutralize them to produce an insecticide to defend against attacks from poisonous insects. Most crucially, when this undershirt is completely soaked in water, an image of Lord Jingke's face shows up on the front!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang introduced his outfit's functionality quite confidently.</p>

    <p>There were no large creatures in Beast King's Remains, but there were definitely plants and insects.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi gave a thumbs-up. "Teacher Luo, you're really amazing!" But his aesthetic taste was a bit...</p>

    <p>"So do you want to wear them? I prepared sets for everyone!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi, Xiao Yin and Wuji said almost in unison, "Thank you for your kindness, Teacher Luo... No need!"</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang's expression was pitiful. "Hey, the magic treasures I invent clearly have so many functions, why don't they sell?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Ah, by the way, I want to bring Rolling Wheels inside; may I? Don't worry, this motorbike is very environmentally friendly and won't pollute the remains."</p>

    <p>"Of course you may, but why do you want to bring it inside, Teacher Luo?"</p>

    <p>"I've already inputted data on the extinct resources inside the remains into Rolling Wheels. It looks like an electric motorbike, but it's actually a toolbox and a smart collector."</p>

    <p>Saying that, Luo Chuang pressed a yellow button on the electric motorbike, and a mechanical arm directly extended out from the rear of the electric motorbike...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>Of course, this wasn't the scariest part - the scariest part was that the mechanical arm looked human! And for some reason, it felt very familiar to Zhuo Yi!</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang "caressed" this mechanical arm with matchless pride. "This mechanical arm was modeled on Lord Jingke's! Doesn't it look very special?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>"It can also talk! And the voice is a copy of Lord Jingke's!"</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang was about to press a button when Zhuo Yi swiftly stopped him. "Teacher Luo, it's getting late... How about you show it to us later when there's time? This is an emergency right now!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi felt that things had been starting to go in a strange direction.</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Luo Chuang promptly nodded, but he had an unavoidably disappointed expression on his face.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi and Xiao Yin would never be able to forget this scene. Luo Chuang's face was mysteriously flushed... With regret written all over this face, he pushed a button so that the mechanical arm retracted, before he beamed. "If Director Zhuo and Brother Xiao Yin want to give it a try when you have the chance, let me know whenever! Using this mechanical arm like a pillow when you sleep at night is very comfortable!"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Sure enough, was this the real reason why he wanted to bring Rolling Wheels in?!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Songhai First Prison's Mahjong Squad's exclusive van had already arrived at the entrance to the fake remains.</p>

    <p>Apart from the Old Devil, Evil Sword God and Master of Immortal Mansion Cheng Yu were exceptional swordsmen. General Bai had thus given them suitable magic swords. These were common military magic swords, produced in bulk by the military factory.</p>

    <p>Common magic swords only had built-in industrial sword spirits and were of streamlined quality. Of course, the quality of military spirit swords was absolutely acceptable, but for a swordsman accustomed to using Sword Dao, this kind of magic sword was disgraceful.</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God: "Does this kind of broken sword deserve to be used by my venerable self?</p>

    <p>"Kind of broken sword deserve to be used by my venerable self...</p>

    <p>"Deserve to be used by my venerable self...</p>

    <p>"Used by my venerable self...</p>

    <p>"By my venerable self...</p>

    <p>"Venerable self...</p>

    <p>"Self?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>The veins on General Bai's forehead throbbed slightly. "If you speak like that again, I'll blow your tongue out."</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God: "Sorry... my venerable self was wrong!"</p>

    <p>The Old Devil and Master of Immortal Mansion Cheng Yu: "..."</p>

    <p>General Bai cleared his throat and said in a deep voice, "This time, there may be some devil disciples among the people we need to deal with, so I hope that the three of you present will do your best to atone for your crimes."</p>

    <p>Master of Immortal Mansion Cheng Yu: "Devil disciples?"</p>

    <p>"To put it more accurately, devil disciples are actually from the devil world."</p>

    <p>General Bai said gravely, "Although we are currently not a hundred percent certain, we already have a relevant lead - among the members of the Dark Network recruited by Night Chief this time, there's a real possibility that some of them are devil disciples."</p>

    <p>The Old Devil frowned and seemed to recall something. "The East is connected to the demon world and the West to the devil world... if I remember correctly, the entrance to the devil world should have already been destroyed in the great war of cultivators in the West?"</p>

    <p>"That's right, the entrance was indeed destroyed at the time. But in recent years, there has already been more and more surveillance data from various countries which confirm that the entrance to the devil world is open once more."</p>

    <p>General Bai said, "So while it might appear that the mission this time is to clean up this group of foreign troublemakers, it is in fact to investigate this lead on devil disciples - before we officially get out of the car, the three of you need to be clear on this. Do you have any other questions?"</p>

    <p>"If we complete this task successfully, how will our punishments be reduced?" the Old Devil asked.</p>

    <p>"This will depend on the final outcome. The death penalty can be commuted to life imprisonment, or life imprisonment can be changed to a shortened sentence. Of course, given the crimes all three of you have committed, even a fixed-term sentence for you will still be more than two thousand years." General Bai said, "Of course, there is the possibility of shortening your sentences further with other missions in the future."</p>

    <p>"I see." The Old Devil wore a somewhat unfathomable smile.</p>

    <p>"It seems that the Devil Emperor is very confident?"</p>

    <p>"Hehe, I'll do my best..."</p>

    <p>The Old Devil: "After all, my venerable self isn't any sort of devil..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
