  <h1>Chapter 636 One Hundred Million Is Extravagant and a Waste!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Insured for one hundred million...</p>

    <p>Because the pocket money they received was limited, most kids Wang Ling's age actually found it hard to imagine what one hundred million was like; they just knew it was a huge sum of money!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed in his heart. Why take out a one hundred million insurance policy... Even if the ring was damaged, just spend several million on raw materials and he could make another dozen or so rings... That was one hundred million! How many crispy noodle snacks could he buy with that? He could even open a noodle factory and make them himself to sell!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought this was a real extravagance and a waste!</p>

    <p>Hm, this wasn't right!</p>

    <p>A hundred million! What a pity...</p>

    <p>But perhaps, this was what a big shot would do.</p>

    <p>After all, a hundred million was just a small goal for a big shot.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Elder Zuo Wu was already completely prepared to die valiantly as a martyr. This Tian Gang Grenade actually wouldn't do much damage to Xiao Yin; to be more precise, it wouldn't even injure his clone at all. At most, it would just be a surface injury. Furthermore, even if it was just a clone, it also had a strong self-healing ability which would instantly heal a surface injury.</p>

    <p>Elder Zuo Wu had a determined look on his face as he adopted the attitude of one ready to die a hero's death, Tian Gang Thunder in hand. He looked like the Huaxiu resistance fighters from several thousand years ago. Xiao Yin had recently been binge-watching local Huaxiu TV shows. When "Sun Island" invaded Huaxiu thousands of years ago, countless anti-Sun heroes had emerged. When these Sun devils charged forward, quite a number of anti-Sun heroes had bravely sacrificed themselves with grenades in hand and took their enemies down with them, becoming national heroes praised and revered by the people!</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin felt that the determination in Elder Zuo Wu's eyes at that moment was just like those heroes in the TV shows, it was so realistic!</p>

    <p>Elder Zuo Wu probably had a talent for acting, right?</p>

    <p>While Xiao Yin's imagination was running wild, he saw a big hand stretch forward out of thin air...</p>

    <p>Hand of Heaven!</p>

    <p>It was Master's hand!</p>

    <p>Master was delivering Lord Diulei's ring!</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was very excited all of a sudden. He felt that this hand was very good-looking. With well-shaped fingers, it was white and flawless, just like extremely refined jade porcelain!</p>

    <p>He was slightly dazed when he looked at this hand, and couldn't help swallowing his saliva... For some reason, he really wanted to lick it!</p>

    <p>Now more than ever, Xiao Yin looked forward to the day that Master would put a leash on his collar and take him for a walk on the streets.</p>

    <p>To be led on a walk by such a pair of beautiful hands; what a fine image that was!</p>

    <p>While Xiao Yin was thinking this, Lord Diulei's Soul Suppression Ring had already been delivered to Elder Zuo Wu's side. This was his second time seeing Wang Ling's hand and he was scared out of his wits.</p>

    <p>"Everyone back off! If I, Zuo Wu, die today, I'll drag you all down with me!" Saying this, he crushed the marble in his hand and the Tian Gang Grenade exploded on the spot, the thunderous explosion blowing up the basement supermarket and directly destroying everything.</p>

    <p>The Tian Gang Grenade was very destructive. If it exploded here, it would take the whole building with it.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling's Hand of Heaven just so happened to be here, and it absorbed the powerful aftershock from the explosion so that the situation didn't look so serious.</p>

    <p>Looking at the surveillance monitor, President Bai and Elder Ji Xing stood up on the top floor of the building. The moment the explosion happened, the Eye of Nothingness had also been destroyed, and there was nothing but white noise now on the monitor.</p>

    <p>The Tian Gang Grenade had indeed exploded as they had felt the apartment building tremble. But given the power of the grenade, it should in theory have been enough to cause this building to collapse.</p>

    <p>"That person behind the scenes must have done something again."</p>

    <p>President Bai narrowed his eyes. Since the other party had the formidable strength to tear open a space, their ability to withstand the fallout from an explosion of this magnitude was well within President Bai's calculations.</p>

    <p>"Mm."</p>

    <p>Elder Ji Xing nodded his head and quickly closed his eyes as he reached out with his awareness for a bit. He then laughed a little mockingly. "But even then, there's nothing the other party can do about Elder Zuo Wu's death. Everything has gone as President Bai expected. Elder Zuo Wu's aura has disappeared; what a miserable end."</p>

    <p>President Bai looked down at the floor with the profound expression of one who had already foreseen everything. "Alright, let's go."</p>

    <p>He turned around, and Elder Ji Xing came to his side. The little black umbrella that had been floating in the air behind them suddenly started to spin in that moment, slowly growing in size to cover them in black light.</p>

    <p>Finally, they disappeared.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Roughly two or three minutes after President Bai's departure, Elder Zuo Wu, who had already been blown to smithereens by the Tian Gang Grenade, cried out in pain amidst the haze. "Fuck! It hurts..."</p>

    <p>Only now did he understand how painful it was to be blown up; it hurt like hell, like his entire body had been torn apart!</p>

    <p>Emm... Wait!</p>

    <p>It seemed he had already been torn apart!</p>

    <p>But why was he still conscious?</p>

    <p>Logically speaking, it shouldn't be like this...</p>

    <p>The Tian Gang Grenade was so destructive that once the body was destroyed, even the soul would be scattered by its mighty aftershock. So logically speaking, he shouldn't be conscious at all!</p>

    <p>Could it be that his fixation was so strong that it had resulted in another supernatural phenomenon and turned him into an earthbound spirit?</p>

    <p>Elder Zuo Wu was shaken by this abrupt twist in events - this was already beyond his realm of understanding. He had already died, yet apparently not, though he still couldn't move. The scene before him was of the supermarket that had been turned into ruins by the explosion. Most importantly, that silver-haired young man was still standing in front of him, and had never left from beginning to end.</p>

    <p>That Tian Gang Grenade had exploded at such close range but this silver-haired young man unexpectedly hadn't been hurt in the slightest... Elder Zuo Wu felt that he had used a very wasteful and idiotic way to kill himself.</p>

    <p>What the hell was with this situation?</p>

    <p>He completely didn't understand what was going on; he only saw specks floating in the air nearby as they recombined into lumps of flesh.</p>

    <p>Elder Zuo Wu: "???"</p>

    <p>Then, an unbelievable thing happened.</p>

    <p>Elder Zuo Wu, who had already been annihilated by the Tian Gang Grenade, discovered that his body was actually being reconstructed bit by bit. Every single strand of hair was in place; the most magical thing of all was that he was even completely recovered from his internal injury! What shook him the most, furthermore, was that his Daoist robe which should have already been destroyed was actually also restored.</p>

    <p>It was only at this moment that he realized that he hadn't died - he had probably been brought back to life by some power!</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin slowly walked toward him and picked up that Soul Suppression Ring from the ground. While the Tian Gang Grenade was powerful, the Soul Suppression Ring was a world-defying magic treasure that couldn't be damaged at all by this level of power.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin took out a wet wipe from his pocket and wiped the ring clean all over. He then watched as Elder Zuo Wu's body was restored bit by bit, and he couldn't help staring at Elder Zuo Wu with a faint smile. "Being blown apart just now must have really hurt, right? If that wasn't enough for you, you can blow yourself up several more times. In any case, you definitely won't die!"</p>

    <p>Elder Zuo Wu: "..."</p>
