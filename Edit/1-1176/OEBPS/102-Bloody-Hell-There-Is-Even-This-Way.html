  <h1>Chapter 102 Bloody Hell!! There Is Even This Way?! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was May 20th on Wednesday in the fourth week of the semester.</p>

    <p>The atmosphere was a little tense this morning. When Teacher Pan walked into the classroom on time as usual, she was holding a stack of papers in her hand, and the students in class despaired a little. It was very obvious that the time for the morning self-study session as well as the first and second lessons would be given over to a quiz.</p>

    <p>The pop quiz had been part of Teacher Pan's teaching for many years. And the most painful thing was that she would never tell them about it beforehand! This was completely a test of the students' current abilities!</p>

    <p>For students of the elite class in Number 60 High School, if it was just an ordinary quiz, it wasn't worth cheating on at all. Teacher Pan's quiz, however, was very unusual; only twenty percent of the paper was comprised of basic course content. The remaining eighty percent was split fairly evenly into four parts: extra strength questions, expansion questions, competition questions and questions not covered in the syllabus...</p>

    <p>And so, it was under these circumstances that the battle of wits and courage began.</p>

    <p>For students of Grade One, Class Three, this was already no longer just a quiz, but a "war" that tested their team spirit!</p>

    <p>But Teacher Pan was ultimately Teacher Pan, one of the handful of teaching pioneers at the frontline of teachers in Number 60 High School; as soon as she entered the classroom, she immediately summoned a number of ghosts to disperse themselves to each corner of the classroom to help her invigilate.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan had carefully calculated the positions of all these ghosts so that their lines of sight would cover every inch of the classroom.</p>

    <p>"I'm going to a morning meeting now, and I'll collect the test papers in an hour and a half." Teacher Pan smiled faintly. "You don't have to worry, everyone. I trained these ghosts myself; as soon as they discover someone cheating, they'll burn the test paper with ghost fire. Everyone only has one test paper each. If it gets burnt, you'll get a zero. I hope all of you will be honest in taking this test!"</p>

    <p>After telling them the rules for taking the test, Teacher Pan turned away to close the door and leave for the meeting.</p>

    <p>As Su Xiao gave out the test papers, some people in class immediately started to complain. "These questions are too difficult! A test on the synthesis formula for the 'Angry Buddha Fire Lotus' and reactions in a flame color experiment! Isn't this only taught next semester?!"</p>

    <p>There was a lot of discussion around Wang Ling; the questions weren't too difficult for him, but when the test paper was in his hands, he still felt like dying...</p>

    <p>If it had just been an ordinary test, it would've been fine, but this test paper which Teacher Pan had written made it utterly impossible for Wang Ling to predict what the average score in class would be!</p>

    <p>In this situation, what Wang Ling had to do was wait until Sun Rong, Su Xiao and Lin Xiaoyu were almost done with their answers, then estimate the scores of these three top students before writing down his answers based on the papers of the whole class in general.</p>

    <p>What he had to do now was just hold his pen and wait patiently.</p>

    <p>It had been ten minutes since the test papers had been given out, and there was complete silence in Grade One, Class Three.</p>

    <p>But very quickly, Wang Ling quietly discovered an undercurrent to the superficial calmness in the class.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan gave her quizzes out at random times, but it was very clear that many people had made their own plans beforehand for such an emergency. It was always good to have a cheat sheet prepared in advance no matter the situation...</p>

    <p>Chen Chao had hidden his cheat sheet in his sock. This guy wanted to pretend to pick at his foot, then take out the cheat sheet. But just as his hand touched his ankle, a ghost floated over with two ghost flames...</p>

    <p><em>He's done for!</em></p>

    <p>Seeing this scene out of the corner of their eyes, a number of people couldn't help sighing in their hearts.</p>

    <p>Given Teacher Pan's personality, she would definitely call his parents if he was caught cheating! And she would definitely castigate him at the parent-teacher conference next Monday!</p>

    <p>But to everyone's surprise, the tragedy of a test paper burned by ghost flame didn't happen...</p>

    <p>Chen Chao calmly drew the cheat sheet out of his sock and palmed it...</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Ling clearly smelled an evil odor seeping out of Chen Chao's palm... then, the ghost pinched its nose and left, just like that.</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..." <em>Fuck! This ghost left because of the stench!</em></p>

    <p>How smelly was this piece of paper?!</p>

    <p>Smelly Feet Exorcism?!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was a little stunned at this scene.</p>

    <p>However, this still wasn't the most terrifying...</p>

    <p>Because from the beginning, he had noticed some fatty who had been scratching his buzz cut the whole time, causing dandruff to fall and cover his desk.</p>

    <p>But instead of being snow-white, this dandruff was black in color...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling took a closer look using his Heavenly Eye and then was frozen completely solid!</p>

    <p>Because Guo Hao... had actually printed his cheat sheet onto his dandruff!</p>

    <p>Fuck!!! There was even this way?!</p>

    <p>Looking at Guo Hao as he began to put the dandruff together one by one, the shock in Wang Ling's heart had already reached its limit.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The afternoon was turning into the captivating, red glow of dusk when a man appeared close to the rural Wang family villa, looking completely out of place in his surroundings. He was very tall and cut a perfect figure; the breeze brushed over his white clothes, molding it over his pectorals...</p>

    <p>White clothes, a long sword, beautiful hair... this was Lord Diulei, a man with the surname Lei.</p>

    <p>Father and Mother Wang were already aware that Lord Diulei would be coming. After all, he was one of the few friends that Wang Ling had in the cultivation world. Plus, given his mistaken impression of the Wang family, Father and Mother Wang had always thought that he was a very interesting person.</p>

    <p>The last time he had come to the Wang family home was a few years ago. Yesterday, Wang Ling had suddenly said that Lord Diulei would be calling on them today, so Mother Wang had hurried off to the wet market to buy a lot of food.</p>

    <p>When she returned riding the freight tricycle that had been blessed by Wang Ling, Mother Wang saw a man in white standing at the entrance to the villa and carrying several bags, large and small. She was startled at first, then she let her eyes wander up and down the man's body for quite a while. "Little Lei, is that you?"</p>

    <p>It had been a fairly long time since he had last visited the Wang family home, so when Mother Wang suddenly called his name, the man was a little flustered and stuttered a little. "Se... senior, hello!"</p>

    <p>Mother Wang stared blankly and wondered why this child was stammering, even if he hadn't come for so long.</p>

    <p>However, this greeting of "senior" confirmed for her this visitor's identity.</p>

    <p>Although Mother Wang wasn't accustomed to being addressed as such, when she recalled this person's identity in the field of cultivation, she assumed it was an act of courtesy in the cultivation world. Because of Wang Ling, Father and Mother Wang had had the opportunity to encounter some big names in the cultivation world, but ultimately there were still very few like Lord Diulei, who repeatedly addressed them as seniors.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, it wasn't easy to find someone who was both powerful and courteous in the field of cultivation.</p>

    <p>This was also one of the biggest reasons why Father and Mother Wang had acknowledged him.</p>

    <p>The man lifted the bags in his hands. "This junior hasn't visited the two seniors in a very long time. I brought several bottles of fairy wine, I hope the two seniors will like them."</p>

    <p>Mother Wang took the bags, the blush on her face completely lost in the red glow of the setting sun. "Since you were coming, just come; you didn't have to bring anything, this is really inconveniencing you."</p>

    <p>The man rubbed his head and smiled shyly. "Senior, this is nothing, this is a necessary courtesy."</p>

    <p>"You don't have to be so polite next time. I bought a lot of food today, we were just waiting for you to eat. Your Uncle Wang and Grandfather Wang are inside, today the three of you can have a good chat," said Mother Wang.</p>

    <p>When she said this, the man was stunned...</p>

    <p><em>Oh my god!</em></p>

    <p><em>Grandfather Wang is also here? Brother Ling's grandfather... am I going to meet the BOSS today?!</em></p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was thoroughly alarmed.</p>
