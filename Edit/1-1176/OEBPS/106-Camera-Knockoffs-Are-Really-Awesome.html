  <h1>Chapter 106 Camera Knockoffs Are Really Awesome! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>In the handful of seconds when the eyes of the long-haired man in white penetrated the faint haze, the three individuals were unexpectedly drawn into an illusion of slow-moving time.</p>

    <p>Time seemed to slow down, and a few short seconds felt like a few hours. The sense of supreme spiritual oppression which emanated from that gaze was like a sawtooth slicing away at a person's soul and awareness inch by inch.</p>

    <p>Their clothes were completely soaked in sweat and they looked like drowned rats.</p>

    <p>When the director and his tall and short subordinates from Landscape Manor roused from their confusion, they were stunned to find that the man in white had disappeared.</p>

    <p>"Director Song..."</p>

    <p>The two subordinates called his name several times before this older and more mature-looking man came back to his senses.</p>

    <p>Where was the man?</p>

    <p>Gone...</p>

    <p>Where did he go?</p>

    <p>No idea at all...</p>

    <p>Everything had happened in just an instant.</p>

    <p>That man was a Soul Formation cultivator!</p>

    <p>At that very moment, the director's heart filled with horror.</p>

    <p>With a somber expression, he wiped at the excessive sweat on his face, like a wiper clearing a windscreen of rain.</p>

    <p>Soul Formation cultivators were capable of glimpsing and applying the laws of heaven and earth. In the face of such a person, especially if there was a disparity in strength, the ability to hide your aura was of little use... in the face of absolute power and under absolute oppression, even your perception of time would become distorted.</p>

    <p>"No wonder you couldn't deal with this family. From the very beginning, we underestimated their strength..."</p>

    <p>Director Song clenched his fists and turned around to look in the direction of the Wang family's small villa with a deep, bitter gaze — this family was absolutely not simple!</p>

    <p>But now was not the time to bother with these things.</p>

    <p>This family had sent the mask off so blatantly it was obvious that they didn't want to wade into these waters. Therefore, their priority now was to investigate the identity of the man in white and grab the stone ghost mask off him before he did anything else.</p>

    <p>As Director Song cupped his chin and carefully considered the situation, the two subordinates next to him suddenly asked, "...What do we do now, Lord Director?"</p>

    <p>"This senior in white used spiritual pressure to intimidate us; it was clear he wasn't looking to engage us in a fight. Given his abilities, I'm afraid he's already far away by now. But what should be checked has to be checked..." Saying this, Director Song took off his gold-rimmed glasses and pressed an inconspicuous button on the side of the frame.</p>

    <p>In a flash, light shot out from the glasses lens, then an image was projected directly into the air...</p>

    <p>"This is...!" The two subordinates were astonished.</p>

    <p>It was a video recording of the man in white as he left the Wang family's small villa and walked down the road. When the video reached the moment when the man had turned his head, it was cut off.</p>

    <p>"In serving the Lord, I need to consider everything." Director Song smiled slightly.</p>

    <p>Although the video had been cut off due to the man in white's overwhelming spiritual pressure, the recording had still gotten a clear image of his appearance.</p>

    <p>Turning off the video, Director Song carefully folded the glasses, then nodded with satisfaction. "This object is not bad, it was able to withstand very strong pressure. When I write a report for the Lord later, I'll apply for popularization of these glasses."</p>

    <p>"Director Song, is this pair of glasses... the legendary portable projector camera glasses?"</p>

    <p>This was the latest advanced technology developed by the Yidali Research Bureau for Unique Artifacts!</p>

    <p>"Of course not... how could I possibly afford the expensive version put out by the Yidali Research Bureau for Unique Artifacts on my salary? It's time you learned the team philosophy. First of all, 'cheap quality for a good price,' got it?"</p>

    <p>Director Song stroked his glasses. "This is the waterproof portable projector camera glasses knockoff specially used by the paparazzi... camera knockoffs are really awesome!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Now, we just need to use the recording to find this man. But before that, there's another important thing." Director Song's expression suddenly turned a little unsightly.</p>

    <p>"Director, at your command..."</p>

    <p>"You still have the long johns you bought from the family yesterday, right? Let me borrow them..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It took half an hour after leaving the Wang family's small villa and ditching the people from Landscape Manor for Lord Diulei to arrive home.</p>

    <p>While it was a fairly long distance, it was still doable since he had a flying sword licence.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei lived in Wenxian Garden, an upscale villa estate populated by rich and respectable residents. Of course, he himself wasn't a wealthy person. He had been gifted this Wenxian Garden villa after chivalrously helping out a real estate tycoon called Lin Sicong ― Wenxian Garden itself was also owned by this tycoon.</p>

    <p>While he had accepted the villa, Lord Diulei had also renovated it. The chief of security at Wenxian Garden would never ever forget when this premier luxurious villa had changed hands, and how Lord Diulei had driven an excavator himself to flatten the garden at the back for further building expansion. He had even sold off all the high-grade furniture in the villa.</p>

    <p>If it wasn't because this villa had been a gift and so it wouldn't have been nice to sell it off just like that, Lord Diulei felt that there was no way he would ever in his life spend so much money to buy such a flashy villa to live in.</p>

    <p>Student Lei Mouren felt that he was quite similar to Wang Ling in this aspect ― they were not only fond of keeping to themselves, but also of keeping low profiles. He wasn't a hedonistic person. Since he hadn't had the slightest bit of use for all that showy furniture, it was just as well that he sold them off for some money.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, the oil for maintaining his immortal sword was ridiculously expensive, plus he also needed funds to keep the cultivation forum running. As a website "boss," he felt that he was under a lot of pressure.</p>

    <p>When he got home, he immediately made a call; the signal was straightaway transmitted over the mountains and the sea to an underground laboratory on the border of Huaxiu nation...</p>

    <p>"Hello, Little Black? Yes, it's me, Lord Diulei..."</p>

    <p>It had already been almost a week since Little Black's lab had been destroyed, and the basic equipment at least was pretty much up and running.</p>

    <p>After listening to Little Black complain about his bitter efforts to restore the lab, Lord Diulei sighed. "Mm, I know you're busy, but repairs to the cannon can wait. I went to meet one of my brothers today; he promised he would help me look for the guy who destroyed the lab, and then we'll go beat him up together... but before that, I want you to help me investigate an organization. Have you heard of Landscape Manor?"</p>
