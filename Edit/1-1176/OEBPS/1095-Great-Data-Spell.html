  <h1>Chapter 1095 Great Data Spell!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Just like that, Xia Ming was punched in the right cheek.</p>

    <p>It wasn't Wang Ling who punched him, but Xia Ming himself.</p>

    <p>Most cultivators' fist techniques were supple; that was to say, when a punch was thrown, the spirit energy molecules on the fist could stir up some of the air, and the two would combine to form an invisible "fist membrane" around the fist. This membrane could be thick or thin, which mainly depended on a cultivator's control of their spirit energy.</p>

    <p>So when Xia Ming threw the punch, and Wang Ling surreptitiously guided its trajectory, Xia Ming already could no longer control his reaction, and his fist hit him squarely in the face.</p>

    <p>The highly misleading body movement which Wang Ling demonstrated was nothing more than a Tai Chi push-hand which neutralized Xia Ming's punch effortlessly.</p>

    <p>This sort of body movement had a somewhat baffling appearance: It was a godly move in the eyes of real bigwigs like Gu Shunzhi and the others, but in the eyes of ordinary people, it looked more like a mistake Wang Ling had made when dodging in a panic.</p>

    <p>To put it bluntly, most of the people here felt that it was Wang Ling's luck which was dominating the duel.</p>

    <p>"As expected of our school mascot; he's so lucky!"</p>

    <p>"That's right! Xia Ming's Chaos Running Water Fist Technique is famous for being erratic and fast. Without enough practice, you'd just be sacrificing yourself to harm the other side."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Hearing the discussion around him, Xia Ming couldn't help falling silent.</p>

    <p>What "harming himself to harm the other side"... It was clearly this fellow in front of him...</p>

    <p>As Wang Ling's opponent, no one had a better front-row seat than Xia Ming. Although Gu Shunzhi and the others had already seen through the mystery of Wang Ling's body movement, there were many more people present who were still in the dark. Only Xia Ming alone had firsthand experience of Wang Ling's weird body movement...</p>

    <p>He didn't want to concede that a person whose grades were always down the middle had actually beat him in body movements; he could only quietly grit his teeth and swallow it all down in his belly.</p>

    <p>In fact, Xia Ming felt that the fight was already decided at this point.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's body movement was so strange that Xia Ming couldn't freely use his fist technique. Moreover, it seemed as if his opponent was deliberately guiding Xia Ming's punch trajectory, as if he was performing Tai Chi, so that Xia Ming was injured by his own punches.</p>

    <p>A few minutes later, Xia Ming was sent flying by a punch yet again.</p>

    <p>This was the eleventh time Xia Ming had punched himself and been sent flying.</p>

    <p>At first, Xia Ming thought that there might be something wrong with his fist technique, so he changed the angle several times when attacking Wang Ling. In the end... it turned out that it had nothing to do with his technique!</p>

    <p>It got to a point that Xia Ming ultimately didn't even bother to use his technique! He directly threw himself at Wang Ling and unleashed a series of wild punches!</p>

    <p>He was like a starving tiger pouncing wildly on its prey, which scared the audience.</p>

    <p>In the headmaster's office, Headmaster Chen, Director Shi and several PE teachers were also watching the battle.</p>

    <p>"Headmaster, what kind of fist technique is this..." asked an astonished PE teacher.</p>

    <p>"Tortoise Fist," Headmaster Chen replied.</p>

    <p>"Tortoise Fist? What's that?"</p>

    <p>"When you were a kid, did you fight with the kid next door over a toy?"</p>

    <p>"Yes... I did..."</p>

    <p>"Then you fought with the Tortoise Fist."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"The so-called Tortoise Fist is a freewheeling technique that doesn't subscribe to any sort of philosophy. As the saying goes, a random blow can kill an old master - this is what it's alluding to." Headmaster Chen sighed.</p>

    <p>"Then, is Student Wang Ling's body movement also like this?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, that's the Tortoise Body Movement... To act however one wishes is the highest realm of body movement, which relies on luck." Headmaster Chen sighed emotionally at Wang Ling's luck.</p>

    <p>All the teachers: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>As Headmaster Chen said, there wasn't a method to the Tortoise Fist which Xia Ming was using; in fact, it was nothing more than the most common wild punch. But throwing a wild punch without using spirit energy consumed even more stamina; after throwing several wild punches, Xia Ming felt that his stamina was already at its limit.</p>

    <p>In contrast, Wang Ling had just been lightly using a body movement to evade the entire time...</p>

    <p>Seeing the hate in Xia Ming's eyes, Wang Ling finally realized the importance of acting skills.</p>

    <p>Indeed, his acting was a little unnatural. After fighting for so long, his face should be a little flushed, even if he wasn't panting for breath.</p>

    <p>Thus, Wang Ling manually regulated his skin color to make his face slightly red. He also manually opened his sweat glands in passing, and did his best to squeeze out a few drops of sweat to roll down his cheeks so that he appeared very tired.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling wouldn't feel tired from this fight even if he fought for hundreds of years, but Xia Ming was, after all, an ordinary cultivator (compared with Wang Ling), and there was a limit to his stamina.</p>

    <p>Even if his spirit root gave him a natural advantage, there were similarly certain limitations.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling opened the King's Eye secretly to look at Xia Ming's energy bar. This was Wang Ling's "Great Data Spell," which could display the values that Wang Ling wanted to see in the form of horizontal bar charts, such as the current numbers for qi and blood, spirit power, stamina, and so on...</p>

    <p>Xia Ming's stamina was already at the limit; he was a sliver away from collapsing.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling took a deep breath and calculated when Xia Ming would throw the next punch.</p>

    <p>Thus, when Xia Ming roared and rushed at him, Wang Ling's brain promptly spun swiftly as it captured Xia Ming's every move and ultimately broke them down to be analyzed via simulations. He precisely calculated the speed of Xia Ming's punch, the time it took for him to attack, as well as the moment he would run out of stamina and collapse.</p>

    <p>For the last punch, Wang Ling didn't plan to use his body movement to guide Xia Ming's punch trajectory. After all, Xia Ming had already beaten himself up pretty miserably; he had punched himself dozens of times in the face. His cheeks were swollen like walnuts, and his nostrils were filled with blood.</p>

    <p>Everyone couldn't stop sighing at this scene.</p>

    <p>Some people had discussed it earlier, and had decided that as soon as one side drew blood, they would step forward to stop the fight.</p>

    <p>But in this current situation, none of the students could stop them at all!</p>

    <p>It was Xia Ming who punched himself!</p>

    <p>It was Xia Ming who injured himself!</p>

    <p>Each of his punches hit him in his own face!</p>

    <p>How the hell were they supposed to stop the fight?</p>

    <p>When Xia Ming threw the last punch, Wang Ling chose a very tricky angle so that to everyone, it looked like Xia Ming had hit his target, when the truth was that he didn't hit Wang Ling at all.</p>

    <p>After throwing the punch, Xia Ming finally fell to the ground, his stamina spent.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling seized the chance and fell to the ground with Xia Ming, lying on one side...</p>

    <p>He suddenly now somewhat understood how hard it was for those old men and women in Peiyuan district to commit <em>pengci.</em></p>

    <p><em>Pengci</em> was truly an art that emphasized acting skills...</p>
