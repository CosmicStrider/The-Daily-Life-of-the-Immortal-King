  <h1>Chapter 750 Wang Ming Recycling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This Dead Sea of Space had sucked in too much garbage and waste from the outside world and there were many magic treasure bits and pieces floating in the sea. If you were lucky, you might find an almost intact magic treasure... However, after being sucked into the Dead Sea of Space, most of these magic treasures wouldn't work since the spirit fluid of the Dead Sea of Space had a strong corrosive effect.</p>

    <p>Of course, that didn't mean that some of the magic treasures couldn't withstand the corrosion.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming concluded that if he wanted to break out of this Dead Sea of Space, the corrosion-resistant magic treasures were especially important. Hence, these magic treasure fragments floating in the sea were actually quite useful!</p>

    <p>He might be able to find the parts he needed!</p>

    <p>Wang Ming took off his white coat and belt. Unfortunately, Wang Ming had felt that the long johns were too hot, so he had left them in the dorm in the glass box.</p>

    <p>He had initially thought that this was the first day of the summer camp, and it was unlikely that something would happen. In the end, he had wound up in this situation...</p>

    <p>Only now did he think about the benefits of the long johns.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had personally enchanted this set of long johns, and its usefulness in this situation would have been even more apparent.</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade didn't know what Wang Ming was going to do, but seeing that he had started to move, he immediately understood that he had probably come up with some idea.</p>

    <p>After taking off his white coat and belt, Wang Ming checked the spirit power in his storage ring... Currently, there was seventy-two percent left, which was enough for him to carry out his follow-up plan, but Wang Ming couldn't directly reveal this; this was one of his trump cards, and Ghost Head Blade absolutely couldn't know about it.</p>

    <p>Hence, he frowned deeply...</p>

    <p>Seeing Wang Ming frown, Ghost Head Blade for some reason felt a little panicked. "Brat... What's wrong this time?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming rubbed his head as he pretended to ponder, his eyebrows knitting tightly into a knot as he tried to highlight the gravity of the situation. "I have an idea."</p>

    <p>"Go on..." Ghost Head Blade said darkly.</p>

    <p>"Previously, our research institute developed a device called a Spirit Power Amplification Cannon." Wang Ming said, "The device can convert spirit energy into a substantial blast, creating tremendous force with little effort. There are a lot of magic treasure fragments floating around in this Dead Sea of Space. If I make good use of these parts, I can build one right away. It'll take me roughly two days."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was resolute and looked very confident when he said this.</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade believed him. The Dead Sea of Space was just like a graveyard for magic treasures... In the past, too many Almightys had cut up space in battle, which ultimately led to magic treasures being accidentally sucked into the Dead Sea of Space. Legend had it that in the battle between Crouching Cow Zhenren <sup>1</sup> and Red Clouds Emperor Li Yaoshi, their world-defying immortal warships collided before falling into the Dead Sea of Space.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The pseudonym of the online
sci-fi author who wrote "Forty
Millenniums of Cultivation .. ")</dfn>

    <p>That was a long time ago, so far back that even Ghost Head Blade couldn't remember exactly when it had happened.</p>

    <p>If these two immortal warships were still here, they would be absolutely priceless since Crouching Cow Zhenren and Red Clouds Emperor Li Yaoshi had sequestered a great deal of their own riches in strongboxes on the warships back then. Even if the spatial spirit fluid was highly corrosive, it would still be impossible for it to corrode a specially-made strongbox.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the two immortal warships were gigantic and were world-defying magic treasures, so they were unlikely to corrode so easily.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, who knew what part of the Dead Sea of Space these two world-defying immortal warships had been drifting in for the past millennia.</p>

    <p>The Dead Sea of Space was endless, and you never knew what kind of useful magic treasure fragment would float past you in the next moment.</p>

    <p>Thus, given that he knew this much about the Dead Sea of Space, Ghost Head Blade was convinced by Wang Ming's words. There were all kinds of magic treasure fragments floating around here, and while they looked like they were already of no damn use, who knew if this "strongest brain" really had a way to use these fragments to recreate a magic treasure.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ming said that he needed two days to make it, which instantly made Ghost Head Blade fall into a deep silence.</p>

    <p>"One day... you have to make the magic treasure in one day," Ghost Head Blade said a moment later, his tone a little menacing.</p>

    <p>He couldn't wait that long. Two days was too long for him. Whether this magic treasure could produce a blast powerful enough to break through the Dead Sea of Space's barrier to get them out was now still up in the air.</p>

    <p>If it failed, Wang Ming would need more time to make another new magic treasure.</p>

    <p>However, Ghost Head Blade's original form wouldn't allow him to wait that long.</p>

    <p>The ancient artifact spirit's curse was more like a ticking time bomb for him...</p>

    <p>Thus, he needed Wang Ming to speed up and develop this thing as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>"Just one day..." Wang Ming furrowed his brow. "It's not impossible, but you'll have to help in order to make it possible!"</p>

    <p>"If you're sure that the whatever cannon you're talking about will work, I can do it," Ghost Head Blade said.</p>

    <p>"I'm very confident that it'll definitely work," Wang Ming said. "When the cannon fires a shot, it'll definitely destroy this space wall and we'll be able to get out! But one day is really very tight! You have to help out!"</p>

    <p>"What do you want to do?" Ghost Head Blade asked.</p>

    <p>"I need spirit energy!"</p>

    <p>Saying this, Wang Ming took a toolbox out of his storage ring and grinned. "The tools in this toolbox have to be injected with spirit energy before they can be used, and if I want to make the magic treasure, I'll need to use the tools inside. You know that I'm an ordinary person, and usually I have assistants helping me in the lab. Right now, you're the only one with spirit energy!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming's words were a mix of truth and lies. The tools in the toolbox did require spirit energy to work, but in the lab, Wang Ming usually used the spirit power stored inside the storage ring, and he could complete everything on his own.</p>

    <p>Not only did the ring on his hand store items, it also stored spirit power!</p>

    <p>With seventy-two percent of spirit power left now, Wang Ming estimated that he would have to use at least more than forty percent of it to recreate the magic treasure, which would cause his ultimate plan to fail.</p>

    <p>So from the very beginning, this was all a ploy on Wang Ming's part.</p>

    <p>Originally, he had estimated that it would only take him a day to finish this magic treasure. He had deliberately said two days so that Ghost Head Blade would bargain with him over it.</p>

    <p>His goal was nothing more than to swindle Ghost Head Blade of his spirit energy...</p>

    <p>Wang Ming took out the tools, lined them up on the Heavenly Materials bamboo raft, and then took a deep breath before looking at Ghost Head Blade. "Hey, so? Are you going to cooperate or not? You're the one who wants me to get this done fast, but in the end the person dragging his feet is also you! Do you still want to get out of here or not? If you don't, we can both just die together!"</p>

    <p>"Fine... I can give you spirit energy..."</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade clenched his teeth, feeling very aggrieved.</p>

    <p>He was filled with resentment.</p>

    <p>In the current situation, however, he could only endure.</p>

    <p>He had already decided in his heart, the moment the magic treasure was complete, he would seize control of Wang Ming's body at once.</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade sneered.</p>

    <p>After all, this was just an ignorant greenhorn...</p>

    <p>He had absolutely no idea that his death was close at hand.</p>
