  <h1>Chapter 799 Sending Out Hero Invitations</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Two billion... so much..." Lord Diulei's mouth was so wide open that he could probably fit an entire egg inside.</p>

    <p>Two billion immortal gold! This investment was too ridiculous!</p>

    <p>This already wasn't just about owning a mine at home anymore...</p>

    <p>Ah Mai, the person-in-charge, cleared his throat. "As expected, Senior Immortal is a person who has seen much of the world. A typical small boss would have absolutely fainted on the spot after hearing this amount. This proves that you are indeed worthy of receiving this angel investment."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>No, it was just that he had been so astonished that for a moment, he had forgotten to pass out!</p>

    <p>As they were chatting, Ah Mai glanced at Wang Ling, who had changed his appearance. "May I ask, Senior Immortal, this is...?"</p>

    <p>"This is Ling Zhenren, our sect's future visiting official as well as one of our main executives," said Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>"So this is Ling Zhenren? Excuse me for not recognizing you..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was shocked. "..."</p>

    <p>His Daoist name "Ling Zhenren" had always been a cover, like an alternate account. He didn't realize that his Daoist name was actually now known outside the chat group.</p>

    <p>It looked like it was time to change his Daoist name...</p>

    <p>For a moment, various thoughts ran through Wang Ling's mind as he pondered a new Daoist name.</p>

    <p>I, King?</p>

    <p>I've Castrated Myself <sup>1</sup> ?</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The Chinese pronunciation is
a homonym of the name of
the character Ainz Ooal Gown,
from the series "Overlord.")</dfn>

    <p>Or how about just Crispy Noodle Snacks?</p>

    <p>After learning that the person sitting next to Lord Diulei was Ling Zhenren, there was instantly deep veneration on Ah Mai's face. "I really never thought that Ling Zhenren would be here with Senior Immortal this time. To be honest, I'm a little excited now! This is better than buying ten family buckets and enjoying finger-licking original recipe chicken skin!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Brother Ling usually keeps a low profile. How does Brother Ah Mai know about Brother Ling?"</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren is naturally low-key, but Senior Immortal should know that a lot of people follow your cultivation forum... For you to run the forum to this extent really isn't easy. Actually, there are a lot of posts online analyzing who Senior Immortal's patron is, and in the end, they found Ling Zhenren... Now, this Daoist name Ling Zhenren is quite famous not only in Senior Immortal's forum but also on other platforms. In fact, I'm personally very curious to know how Senior Immortal is able to run the website to such a remarkable extent?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei couldn't help blushing at this praise. "No, no... This is thanks to Brother Ling and to the nation! The most important is to read more books and news, eat less snacks, sleep more, and pay your network fees and taxes on time!"</p>

    <p>"Senior Immortal is so right!" Ah Mai nodded like a chicken pecking rice. Recently, the tax bureau exposed the matter of a showbiz actress's yin-yang contract, and she was fined eight billion immortal gold <sup>2</sup> ! It caused quite an uproar!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(The so-called "yin-yang
contract" is a practice found
within the Chinese
entertainment industry
whereby celebrities
under-report their earnings
by submitting a copy of
their contract with a reduced salary figure to tax
authorities. Chinese actress
Fan Bingbing was fined 884
million yuan in 2018 for tax
evasion ..)</dfn>

    <p>Thus, after listening to Lord Diulei's words, Ah Mai was very moved. "Senior Immortal is indeed a sensible person! Huaxiu Alliance wasn't mistaken! Actually, Huaxiu Alliance had initially planned to invest in the set-up of the cultivation forum. This time, after hearing that Senior Immortal wants to establish a sect, the head of state approved it personally, so success will naturally follow in this endeavor."</p>

    <p>"I see... But Brother Ah Mai, two billion immortal gold is a little much!"</p>

    <p>"Hahaha! Senior Immortal, please don't refuse. Our two billion immortal gold investment won't be paid out in a lump sum, but will be divided into five installments. After the first portion of the investment funds is given to you, it'll be up to how well Senior Immortal runs the sect. If the sect runs at a loss, subsequent investments may be put on hold... This is something we need to make clear to Senior Immortal first."</p>

    <p>"Of course! Since Brother Ah Mai has said so, I'm very relieved!" Lord Diulei nodded.</p>

    <p>It was indeed reasonable to give out the investment in installments. It was true that Lord Diulei was very confident in his ability to run the sect, but he also didn't want to defraud the other party. Two billion immortal gold was admittedly a massive investment, but in the end, the sect was only in the initial development stage - they didn't need so much money yet, and they would have to go through several rounds of adjustment before they could settle on a budget.</p>

    <p>When the time came and he bungled up such a large amount, they would have no way of circulating it to expand their business, which would truly be a waste of the investment.</p>

    <p>But if the investment was divided into five installments of four hundred million immortal gold each, Lord Diulei was quite confident in his ability to put each installment to reasonable use.</p>

    <p>"To tell you the truth, Senior Immortal, Huaxiu Alliance actually settled on 1.2 billion immortal gold as the investment amount in the beginning."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Then how did it go up to two billion?"</p>

    <p>Ah Mai: "Wasn't there an eight hundred million fine recently..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei and Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Has Senior Immortal decided exactly when you will announce the establishment of the sect?" Ah Mai asked.</p>

    <p>"Of course! Next Tuesday is an auspicious day!" Lord Diulei said, "I already have people working on an overall plan of the sect. Construction of many of the facilities has already been completed using the 'Model Technique.' When the time comes, we just need to place the model on the site and cast the spell, and the sect will be built instantly! And that will be the day that we declare the founding of our General Office of Strategic Deception!"</p>

    <p>"Mmm! This is a big event! When I go back, I'll certainly let Huaxiu Alliance know to make the arrangements - once Senior Immortal has fixed the exact time on Tuesday, you can let me know, and I'll send out hero invitations to every major light force in the name of the General Office of Strategic Deception! Let them witness the birth of this new sect together!"</p>

    <p>"I can send out hero invitations?" Lord Diulei was completely unaware of this.</p>

    <p>"Of course you can!" An Mai said firmly. "Logically speaking, sending hero invitations to light forces requires Huaxiu Alliance's approval first, and the approval process takes one to two months. However, the sect established by Senior Immortal and Huaxiu Alliance are now allies, so the process is automatically simplified."</p>

    <p>"If that is the case, then I must thank Brother Ah Mai even more."</p>

    <p>"It's nothing!" Ah Mai waved his hand. "In addition, I need to stress one point: Senior Immortal cannot directly state that the investment is from Huaxiu Alliance... instead, it's a combined investment from private firms. I'll compile a list of the related investment firms and send a copy to Senior Immortal."</p>

    <p>"What are these private firms?"</p>

    <p>"These private firms were established by the sons or daughters of the Ten Generals through their own sweat and tears, and they are also light forces. Please understand, Senior Immortal, it's a very sensitive time right now..."</p>

    <p>"Alright."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei and Brother Ah Mai exchanged smiles; both of them understood each other instantly.</p>

    <p>"Ah, that's right, Senior Immortal, do you need any special guests for the day of the sect's establishment? If you do, don't hesitate to let me know. On your behalf, we can ask all the bigwigs of the light forces to show up - even sect heads won't be a problem."</p>

    <p>"We do need esteemed guests, but wouldn't that be a little too high-profile? I don't need many people, just ten..."</p>

    <p>"Just ten? We have millions and millions of light forces, just ten is really too low-key. As expected of Senior Immortal... Which ten does Senior Immortal want? Let us hear it."</p>

    <p>"Are... are the Ten Generals free?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
