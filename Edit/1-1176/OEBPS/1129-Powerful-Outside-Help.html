  <h1>Chapter 1129 Powerful Outside Help</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The small air immortal warship could hold up to fifty people at one time. After the Number 60 High delegation boarded, Wang Ling instantly had a bad feeling when he saw that the warship had yet to take off.</p>

    <p>Roughly ten minutes later, the school guard Old Li led another delegation of ten people, who were wearing luxurious school uniforms, to the sports field - now, everyone had assembled.</p>

    <p>Everyone from Number 60 High was looking out the window, and Chen Chao and Guo Hao suddenly got a little excited. "It's Number 59 High!"</p>

    <p>Number 60 High and Number 59 High could now be considered old acquaintances. As with Number 60 High, the headmaster of Number 59 High had also personally come. Seeing the familiar figure of Headmaster Jin from Number 59 High, it was as if Wang Ling was back at the spirit sword exchange meet which had been held not long ago last semester.</p>

    <p>It was Number 60 High who had won the exchange meet then.</p>

    <p>But the exchange meet also brought Number 59 High and Number 60 High closer together. In addition, Number 60 High's promotion as a key city high school candidate had been a special exception, which didn't affect Number 59 High's path to promotion at all. Now that they were on the same air immortal warship, this could be said to be the perfect picture of a happy reunion.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling privately felt that this was fated somehow.</p>

    <p>Everyone knew that Headmaster Chen and Headmaster Jin were from the same sect. Now, they were both headmasters who were leading the students under them to participate in a national competition... Such a harmonious situation was really moving.</p>

    <p>The first person from Number 59 High to board was He Bufeng.</p>

    <p>Senior Buliang, who had been taught a lesson by Wang Ling before, had now completely turned over a new leaf - not only had he shaved off his shamate hairstyle in favor of a crew cut, he was also wearing a pair of reading glasses to perfect his intellectual aura.</p>

    <p>He Bufeng truly reflected the saying "the clothes make the man." Although he had been held back in school, he was evidently performing well in all respects after turning over a new leaf. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been invited to be a member of the delegation.</p>

    <p>As the saying went, "a fault confessed is already half-redressed." The students of Number 60 High were somewhat astonished to see the tremendous changes in He Bufeng's hairstyle and temperament; even Wang Ling almost didn't recognize him.</p>

    <p>To Wang Ling's horror, He Bufeng made a beeline for him as soon as he boarded the warship...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had deliberately looked for a seat at the back, which gave him a sense of security. Everyone from Number 60 High knew his personality, so none of them crowded him. The air immortal warship was very spacious, and one person could occupy two seats. It would be too hot if they all sat together!</p>

    <p>So it was very clear that He Bufeng was headed toward Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>"May I... sit here, please?" The others were astonished when He Bufeng opened his mouth. This polite manner left everyone from Number 60 High speechless for a moment.</p>

    <p>Before Wang Ling could answer, He Bufeng had already thanked him. "Thank you!"</p>

    <p>He then directly sat down next to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had nothing to say.</p>

    <p>He Bufeng, who had initially turned into a black cat to tease Wang Ling, had turned back into his original, buck naked form in broad daylight thanks to Wang Ling's King's Eye. Now, He Bufeng was sitting next to him. Wang Ling felt that this could be considered karma... ah, what an ill-fated relationship!</p>

    <p>But He Bufeng shouldn't have any evil intentions. From what Wang Ling could tell, the only thing He Bufeng felt toward him now... was the slight suspicion that Wang Ling was a very strong person...</p>

    <p>In short, it would be better to be a little more vigilant around this guy.</p>

    <p>But now, He Bufeng's attitude was more like... that of a fan?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's mind spun with wild thoughts.</p>

    <p>He looked calmly out the window and pretended to ignore He Bufeng, but he had already clearly grasped He Bufeng's attitude.</p>

    <p>In addition to He Bufeng, the other four members of Number 59 High's fixed five-member group had also come: they were Tang Jingze and the three brothers of the Liang family, Liang Wei, Liang Zheng and Liang Fei. As for the remaining five people, Wang Ling didn't know them very well; even after searching his memories, he felt that they were all unfamiliar, and he hadn't seen them at the previous spirit sword exchange meet.</p>

    <p>After the students of Number 59 High boarded the immortal warship, the scene quickly turned lively.</p>

    <p>This was mainly because the two schools were now on friendlier terms. Tang Jingze came to Number 60 High to visit the student union for exchange activities sometimes, so the atmosphere among the students of the two schools on the warship was even better than expected, and so harmonious that even the two headmasters felt it was somewhat miraculous.</p>

    <p>"Senior brother, are we going to form an alliance this time?" Headmaster Jin was the first to ask after boarding.</p>

    <p>"Does junior brother think it's going to be tricky?" Headmaster Chen raised his eyebrows. He was all too clear on his junior brother's character; the latter absolutely wouldn't open his mouth to suggest that they form an alliance unless he really had to.</p>

    <p>The truth was that Headmaster Jin was also moved when he saw how friendly the two schools were.</p>

    <p>Although, the two schools were also fundamentally in a competitive relationship...</p>

    <p>"It'll be safer that way." Headmaster Jin pursed his lips and turned away. "Heh, if you don't want to, then forget it!"</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen smiled. "I didn't say no."</p>

    <p>He had often teased this junior brother of his when they were at school together. It had been so many years since they graduated, and both of them were now headmasters, but he felt that his junior brother hadn't changed at all, and was still a damn tsundere.</p>

    <p>"Alright, then! We'll draw up a contract later!" Headmaster Jin said.</p>

    <p>"A contract? So formal?"</p>

    <p>"Of course!" Headmaster Jin replied. "After our students enter the battlefield and both sides run into each other, they should spare no effort to help one other out. We'll set the sixth day of the survival contest as the deadline. The contract will be voided on the seventh day, and we can compete like normal then."</p>

    <p>"I'm fine with that."</p>

    <p>The suggestion made Headmaster Chen smile. An alliance was certainly a good thing, but he was still somewhat skeptical about Number 59 High's fighting strength. "I specialized in support studies back then, which was an unconventional pathway. Junior brother, you took the more orthodox route. Listening to you talk, it seems that you're confident Number 59 High will be able to survive?"</p>

    <p>"Well..."</p>

    <p>Headmaster Jin hemmed and hawed. "It seems that there are some unfamiliar faces among the students whom you've selected this time."</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, both the headmasters smiled in tacit understanding.</p>

    <p>"Did junior brother also look for outside help?"</p>

    <p>"Not exactly; these children are very good, and have already become students of our Number 59 High."</p>

    <p>"Where did you poach them from?"</p>

    <p>"Tianshi Imperial High School."</p>

    <p>"..." Headmaster Chen was a little surprised. It wasn't as if he had never heard of this school.</p>

    <p>Of all the cultivation high schools, this was the first choice for children of high-ranking officials and aristocrats in Jinghua city. Fang Xing had transferred from this school to Number 60 High.</p>

    <p>It was the fact that Number 59 High was actually able to poach students from Tianshi Imperial High School which Headmaster Chen found incredible.</p>
