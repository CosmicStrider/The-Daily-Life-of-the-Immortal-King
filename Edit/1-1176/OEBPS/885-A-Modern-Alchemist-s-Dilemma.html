  <h1>Chapter 885 A Modern Alchemist's Dilemma</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This was a disastrous fight — not just Long Ming, but even President Bai felt that his death was a little unexpected.</p>

    <p>But the two of them weren't truly dead, since Devil Gut Fungus Lord had just swallowed them, gaining their powers in the process. President Bai's description of Devil Gut Fungus Lord in essence as a "greedy snake" had been spot on, as the more people he swallowed, the stronger he became.</p>

    <p>"The Bai clan's secret art, the Long clan's secret art..." Having devoured both of them, Devil Gut Fungus Lord quickly digested his newfound strength. Devil Gut Fungus Lord's confidence soared at possessing the Long clan's powerful ability to control insects and the Bai clan's powerful secret art of creation.</p>

    <p>He no longer had to worry about the light of Buddha. This secret art of creation was too powerful! Even if he was roasted under the light, Devil Gut Fungus Lord was confident he could swiftly repair the damaged bacteria; combining the power to repair and the ability to reproduce, the harmful bacteria he spawned would have the power of superbugs.</p>

    <p>Devil Gut Fungus Lord was utterly delighted by the combination of these recovery and reproduction abilities.</p>

    <p>Most crucially, he was pleasantly surprised to discover that President Bai actually had the power of Outer Dao!</p>

    <p>This was simply a great treasure he had devoured!</p>

    <p>Although President Bai hadn't completely collected the power of all six Outer Dao, he already had three.</p>

    <p>Alas for President Bai, the one to ultimately reap the benefits was Devil Gut Fungus Lord.</p>

    <p>President Bai underestimated his enemy, and was devoured even before he had the chance to activate his Reverse Polarity.</p>

    <p>That had really been a close one earlier.</p>

    <p>"As expected, I am the fated master." Devil Gut Fungus Lord sneered darkly.</p>

    <p>If President Bai had used the Reverse Polarity power of Outer Dao, devouring him would have been rendered ineffective, since Reverse Polarity was originally an Outer Dao that was able to defy heaven and change fate. Moreover, one usually wouldn't use this Outer Dao so easily unless their life was at stake.</p>

    <p>This carelessness was typical of experts.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, too many experts didn't know how to fight when they were down to low health, and lost despite the many advantages they had at the beginning.</p>

    <p>It could be said that President Bai was a typical example.</p>

    <p>Besides, he even dared to natter on in battle.</p>

    <p>Usually, the one who died was the one who talked too much.</p>

    <p>"Ours is truly an exceptional fusion." Devil Gut Fungus Lord laughed cruelly. He waved his hand in the next moment, and a number of spatial summoning arrays appeared in the air above the ground.</p>

    <p>He combined his summoning array with the Long clan's secret art to connect to Insect Valley and summon its most powerful and ruthless insect: Immortal Bug.</p>

    <p>This was a black caterpillar half a meter in length and covered in poisonous spines all over its body. It liked the dark and wasn't afraid of fire or water, though it preferred to live in the water; the Immortal Bug's ability to stay alive was at its fullest in a liquid environment.</p>

    <p>If an Immortal Bug was severely injured and didn't immediately die, it would instantly recover in a short three seconds.</p>

    <p>Immortal Bugs didn't like being exposed to sunlight, so Devil Gut Fungus Lord created a layer of bacteria cover to block out the light for the Immortal Bugs he summoned.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Thus, when Immortal Toya rushed to the battlefield, he was met with a frightening, apocalyptic scene.</p>

    <p>There was a deep crevasse several miles long on the border of Mixiu, and what drew Immortal Toya's attention was the swarm of Immortal Bugs. They poured out of the crevasse in a steady stream like a fountain, devouring everything around them and even nibbling on each other.</p>

    <p>Lamp posts and vehicles were all swallowed up one by one, and the suburban roads and green belts were also being gnawed away little by little.</p>

    <p>This was such a horrifying scene, reminiscent of a car crash <sup>1</sup> during the New Year's concert.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(L.e. a terrible song performance..)</dfn>

    <p>Immortal Toya, who had combined with the pagoda spirit, arrived at the scene, his body glowing with a spirit light which flickered between blue and green. Immortal Toya's healing spirit energy was initially blue, and after he combined with the pagoda spirit, his spirit light now had a touch of green.</p>

    <p>This was Immortal Toya's first transnational mission. In addition to promoting the Office of Strategic Deception's status abroad, it was also for his own peace of mind, so that he could travel further down his path.</p>

    <p>Looking at the sight in front of him, Immortal Toya's lips thinned. He was wearing a purple Daoist robe, and his eyes were very cautious as he kept a close watch on the huge energy fluctuations under the ground. At the same time, he looked a little shaken.</p>

    <p>Because this fluctuation was a lot stronger than in the encounter with President Bai before.</p>

    <p>"I don't want to know what's going on at all!" Immortal Toya said.</p>

    <p>As a result, the pagoda spirit replied in his mind, "You really are good for nothing. You can't even tell? Devil Gut Fungus Lord has devoured Bai Zhe's power; even that Long clan descendant was swallowed up."</p>

    <p>So that was it...</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya nodded to himself.</p>

    <p>His fighting abilities had indeed improved, but Immortal Toya had no idea how to handle this situation at all.</p>

    <p>Lack of battle experience was the inherent problem all alchemists faced.</p>

    <p>In an era of peace, the greatest role alchemists played was to refine pills, medicine and the like. The days when two alchemists would hit each other with an Angry Buddha Fire Lotus as soon as they met were long over. Currently, a modern alchemist's role was like that of a wet nurse.</p>

    <p>But people had always turned their backs on this role.</p>

    <p>A lot of battles were about fighting strength, and flashy spells were emerging more and more; if the other side brought along an alchemist wet nurse, they would be disdained!</p>

    <p>So when cultivators went out in teams to get experience, they would clearly indicate when forming a group — no wet nurses!</p>

    <p>As long as you prepared enough medicine in advance before going out to get experience, there was no need to bring an alchemist with you at all; not only were they expensive to hire, you could be labeled a "coward" for inviting an alchemist along.</p>

    <p>Hm...</p>

    <p>This was a particular prejudice modern cultivators held toward alchemists, many of whom were helpless to do anything about it.</p>

    <p>While Immortal Toya was reflecting on this, the earth suddenly shook, and a purple and black light poured out of the ground like spring water breaking through the earth.</p>

    <p>"Someone else has come to offer themselves up?" Devil Gut Fungus Lord, who had emerged from the crack in the ground, gazed at Immortal Toya from a distance in the air, a sly look on his face.</p>

    <p>When he noticed the blue and green light wrapped around Immortal Toya's body, he was pleasantly surprised.</p>

    <p>A world-defying spatial magic artifact?</p>

    <p>Well, it looked like the other party wasn't just offering their head, but also an item...</p>

    <p>Devil Gut Fungus Lord had been worried that he didn't have a suitable place to breed his bacteria.</p>

    <p>This magic artifact would be pretty good...</p>
