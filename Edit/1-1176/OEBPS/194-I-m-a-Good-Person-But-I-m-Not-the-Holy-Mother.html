  <h1>Chapter 194 I'm a Good Person, But I'm Not the Holy Mother! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was June 12th on Sunday in the seventh week of the semester.</p>

    <p>The incident with the missing Riceball Takeout delivery riders seemed to have come to an end for the time being, but it was just as troublesome trying to sort out the aftermath. After Zhuo Yi had bailed Third Saint out, the latter had begun to assist Lord Diulei in follow-up investigations and dealing with the aftermath. That night, they took the witness statements of the twenty-one riders in the gourd. Although they were now souls, their statements were just as legally binding according to Huaxiu nation's laws.</p>

    <p>"So that's the basic situation..."</p>

    <p>After a night of cross-examination, Lord Diulei explained the situation in the group chat, then amply promoted his good will. "The next thing we need to do is to help these twenty-one surviving delivery riders apply for accident insurance with the insurance company."</p>

    <p>Early in the morning, Wang Ling scrolled through the group's chat history.</p>

    <p>"Accident insurance?" Cailian Zhenren said doubtfully.</p>

    <p>"Mm, there are two options for a cultivation accident insurance plan. The first is to give the families compensation in the event that the death has already happened. I will also find a way to help the families of the eleven riders whom we couldn't save go through the process. The second option is to help make them corporeal bodies. This is also included in the accident insurance where the souls are preserved in a relatively complete state."</p>

    <p>"Make corporeal bodies? How?" Cailian Zhenren asked.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei answered, "Of course, it can't be done if their realm is too high, but if it's below the Golden Core stage, it can be done by combining clay with the universal restorative spirit lotus root. However, this is relatively expensive; generally, it's used to make limbs for the disabled; the cost of creating an entire body would be sky-high for an ordinary cultivator. But if it's within the insurance range, the expense can almost be overlooked."</p>

    <p>Spirit lotus root?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling peered at the screen, and for some reason, he suddenly thought of Nezha <sup>1</sup> from the myth.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(In Chinese mythology, Nezha was a boy who sacrificed himself for his family, but was later brought back to life by his teacher, who used lotus roots to construct a human body for his soul.)</dfn>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren: "But they're all in the gourd now, how are they going to apply? And even if they can apply, doesn't the person in question have to sign?"</p>

    <p>"This isn't a big deal, their souls just can't be exposed to light. We can use verbal recordings to get notarizations from the notary office and apply on their behalf as their agents." Lord Diulei sent an emoji with a sinister smile. "Of course, I'm not doing this for free. After talking it over with them yesterday, they agreed that each of them would pay me twenty percent of their individual compensation insurance plans as an errand service fee."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren: "Senior Immortal... I really thought you were a good person!"</p>

    <p>"Fellow Cailian, that's where your way of thinking is wrong. Think about it, we saved this bunch of people, and if they don't pay us back, don't you think their consciences would hurt?"</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "This Senior Immortal is a good person, that's true, but I'm not the Holy Mother... what must be asked for should be asked for! Besides, it costs quite a bit to maintain the small world inside Brother Toya's gourd. There's also quite a lot of public relations expenses involved when we're running errands. The most troublesome are the damn insurance claims; they can't be sorted out at all until we've made twenty or thirty trips."</p>

    <p>Reading Lord Diulei's words, Wang Ling nodded with deep understanding.</p>

    <p>He recalled back when Grandfather Wang had applied for a pension in his first year of retirement. When he had gone through the formalities each time, if he wasn't missing his papers, then he was missing stamps. The whole process had taken half a year to complete...</p>

    <p>"In addition to the above, there is one other more important thing, which is that we have to quickly investigate the old devil's location. As long as the ancient dagger is restored, Brother Ling can use his great power to trace it directly back to the old devil." Lord Diulei typed swiftly. "I'm guessing that the place which the Purple Gold Gourd links to is probably an alien space that would be almost impossible to track down if that old devil doesn't show up."</p>

    <p>"But that is a magic blade from ancient times; is there really a way to restore it?" Bulang Blade Immortal asked in the group chat.</p>

    <p>"There is!" Lord Diulei said. "It looks badly damaged, but in fact it was just the middle section that was crushed. The top part and the bottom where it's attached to the hilt is relatively intact. We just need Dharmaraja to use the power of his godly thunder inheritance to weld them together."</p>

    <p>Nine Times Man, Cailian Zhenren and Bulang Blade Immortal: "..." There was such an operation?!</p>

    <p>"I've already asked Dharmaraja to prepare for it; he's probably busy now and hasn't read the messages."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei said, "Brother Ling, the dagger fragments are still with you. I'll ask Brother Toya to find you in the afternoon, and the two of you can go together. Hm... I know you're lurking."</p>

    <p>After Wang Ling read this, he was instantly silent. Then, he closed the chat window and pretended that he hadn't read anything.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At one o'clock in the afternoon, Immortal Toya arrived on the dot at the door of the Wang family's small villa.</p>

    <p>When Mother Wang opened the door, she immediately saw a handsome, noble-looking man with white skin and gray hair. He hadn't brought his large medicinal gourd with him today; instead, there was a long sword on his back, which made him seem even more like a graceful fairy.</p>

    <p>Mother Wang felt that this man was way too handsome â€” she also thought that Little Lei was very handsome, but it was clear that Lord Diulei had a very Er Dan temperament, so she had always felt that if he ever entered the entertainment industry, it would probably be as a comedian... on the other hand, her first impression of this gray-haired youth was that he was a man who could steal the show! He had the real temperament of a superstar!</p>

    <p>Seeing Mother Wang, Immortal Toya immediately stood to attention, then bowed deeply to her. "Hello, senior, I'm here to look for Ling Zhenren!"</p>

    <p>He knew that the people who lived in the Wang family's small villa were all remarkable individuals; he had heard from Lord Diulei that there was an old man in particular who was a great senior in the cultivation world with some mysterious unknown identity... therefore, he had come to the Wang family's small villa with the devout heart of a pilgrim.</p>

    <p>"Ling Ling, your friend's looking for you." Mother Wang opened the door and then called for him out of habit. But Wang Ling had actually already known about Immortal Toya's arrival earlier on, and he made his way downstairs.</p>

    <p>After that, he changed into a pair of white canvas shoes and left with Immortal Toya, shoulder to shoulder.</p>

    <p>As they left, Mother Wang still had her hands on her face as she looked at their backs with an intoxicated expression.</p>

    <p>Ah... no! That was a man! And Wang Ling was a straight man!</p>

    <p>Mother Wang suddenly came to her senses!</p>

    <p>For just an instant, she had suddenly felt that Ling Ling and this youth had seemed compatible with each other...</p>

    <p>She had to go cool off first... she wasn't young anymore, but was actually still indulging in fantasies. This was really not right!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya had driven a car here this time. When he saw this luxury black supercar, Wang Ling hesitated for a bit, but in the end got in.</p>

    <p>He actually didn't really like taking any sort of transportation. He could directly teleport or run to a lot of places, but he also didn't like to reveal too much about himself in front of people whom he wasn't very familiar with. He had only met Immortal Toya several times, so it would be too unreserved of him if he revealed too much.</p>

    <p>There actually weren't many people whom Wang Ling completely acknowledged.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Lord Diulei was a special case.</p>
