  <h1>Chapter 941 An Unexpected Development</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The moment he punched his eye, Evil Sword God glowed with boundless radiant light in the midst of the group, like Daigo transforming into Ultraman Tiga. Intangible sword qi swept out, blasting away the countless fat shut-ins around him like sand.</p>

    <p>When this powerful momentum descended, these group leaders on Detention Island clammed up. For one moment, those who had advanced on and harassed Evil Sword God, as well as those who had been making noise on the side, froze on the spot and didn't dare move.</p>

    <p>"You arrogant bunch, you actually dare make fun of this lord?</p>

    <p>"Actually dare make fun of this lord?</p>

    <p>"Dare make fun of this lord?</p>

    <p>"Make fun of this lord?</p>

    <p>"This lord?</p>

    <p>"Lord?"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The familiar echo resounded throughout Detention island. Sword qi swept out in all directions, cutting the clothes on dozens of fat shut-ins to ribbons.</p>

    <p>While he had turned into the Evil Sword God whom everyone knew, he was still sharing his consciousness with the Old Devil and Cheng Yu, and they reminded him not to kill anyone there.</p>

    <p>Now that they were performing meritorious deeds to atone for their crimes, they had to pay even more attention to their behavior.</p>

    <p>While these people were disgusting, a light reprimand was fine and they didn't have to die for what they had done.</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God stepped toward these people. He held no sword in his hand, but there were swords in his mind. Everyone felt that cold intent as if it was a sword resting against their necks.</p>

    <p>If they so much as blinked, he could cut their heads off.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Huang Youliang was watching this scene in the van.</p>

    <p>He was just as terrified.</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God was famed for his prowess; Huang Youliang had heard of his fearful reputation even in Baowan province.</p>

    <p>He was suddenly very glad that he had been born in this era of order and law. If this was in the past and he had talked so much trash, someone would have dropped in on him and cut his head off long ago without any kindness or mercy.</p>

    <p>This might not be the best era, but it was absolutely the most tolerant one</p>

    <p>But where there was tolerance, there was impudence.</p>

    <p>There was a saying that good people were taken advantage of, or a tame horse was easier to ride.</p>

    <p>Didn't the online water army and keyboard warriors take advantage of the tolerance of strangers?</p>

    <p>Without needing to punish someone as a warning to the others, Evil Sword God had shaken all of Detention Island through his momentum alone.</p>

    <p>"I know some of you more or less know who I am. However, I came here today not for you, but for one thing." Staring at everyone in an overbearing manner, Evil Sword God seriously uttered one word: "Fairness!"</p>

    <p>And then, he repeated and emphasized it: "Fairness!"</p>

    <p>"Freaking fairness!"</p>

    <p>"Fa- fairness?" someone murmured, confused.</p>

    <p>"All of you joined the Governor's water army organization and became group leaders. Behind your screens, you verbally abuse people who have nothing to do with you over the Internet, even cursing other people's families and sapping their motivation to study or work!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Learning! Is the stepping stone of progress! Work! Is the driving force behind the development of a nation's economy! You just malign other people behind your screens and even indiscriminately start rumors and go whichever way the wind blows!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"When you posted these views, did you ever think about how much trouble you're causing for other people and for society? Just because you rely on the tolerance of strangers and the fact that no one can find you behind a screen, you think you can spout rubbish? Do you think that's fair?"</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God's speech was upright and vehement.</p>

    <p>Of course, these weren't Evil Sword God's own words, but something General Bai had prepared beforehand; Evil Sword God was just reading them aloud through his mind-share with the Old Devil.</p>

    <p>They were now atoning for their crimes, so they still had to follow procedure!</p>

    <p>It could only be said that as the strongest of the Ten Generals, Explosion Saint deserved his name. These words were just like nuclear bombs in the hearts of these group leaders, which smashed their spirits and left them completely battered.</p>

    <p>"Listen up, this lord is going to ask all of you some questions and you must answer me honestly - this is also your last chance to make up for what you've done."</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God said, "Right now, our nation is cracking down hard on Internet keyboard warriors. After you get out of here, you'll be locked up for a few years, but if you're good and plead guilty, it might only be for a few months."</p>

    <p>These fat shut-in group leaders exchanged dismayed looks; they had turned red at Evil Sword God's speech just now, and felt too ashamed to show their faces.</p>

    <p>"Then, what should we do..." someone asked.</p>

    <p>"First question: who can tell me about this island?" As soon as Evil Sword God spoke, plenty of those in the know fought to be the first to raise their hands.</p>

    <p>They were fighting for the chance to get their sentences reduced.</p>

    <p>"You, speak." Evil Sword God pointed at a fatty who only had one strand of hair on his head.</p>

    <p>"In the beginning, we didn't know what this place was, but the one thing we were sure of was that all of us had already been abandoned by the Governor. Furthermore, everyone here are group leaders in the water army. We were locked up here because we accidentally leaked organization secrets."</p>

    <p>This person replied honestly, "Detention Island has a canteen and an Internet cafe. The canteen is machine-operated, and provides burgers and Coke. But these things aren't free. We have to play games at the Internet cafe and clear dungeons and gather equipment, then convert them into contribution points."</p>

    <p>"Is there any chance of getting out?" Evil Sword God asked again.</p>

    <p>"Not at the moment. However, once we obtain one hundred million contribution points, we can regain our freedom," One Hair said.</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Evil Sword God as well as the Old Devil and Cheng Yu in the prison van all nodded.</p>

    <p>The situation was pretty much what they had guessed, with some minor differences.</p>

    <p>This was a detention island for group leaders; instead of being an assembly point for the water army, this was a place of punishment to lock up group leaders who had almost divulged the secrets of the online water army.</p>

    <p>In other words, these group leaders had secrets no one else knew.</p>

    <p>Thus, they were the best subjects for their investigation.</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God then ordered these fat shut-ins to line up. He pointed to the first one in line and said, "Starting with you, introduce yourself, then tell me what you did as a water army group leader, what your relationship with the Governor is like, and whether you've met him or not."</p>

    <p>"Okay..."</p>

    <p>The first person nodded and then said diffidently, "I, I'm Ding Lixi. My job as group leader previously was to organize people online to post negative comments on Douban. As for my relationship with the Governor, I've only spoken to him once online... He's very mysterious, and won't meet with anyone so easily."</p>

    <p>"Hm, next one." Evil Sword God nodded.</p>

    <p>"Previously, I was a group leader who mobilized group members online to send scam texts in particular."</p>

    <p>"Your water army also does this sort of thing?"</p>

    <p>"We set up a special water army scam group..." This person said, "All the texts we sent basically had the same content."</p>

    <p>"What was the message?"</p>

    <p>"Hello, I'm Emperor Qin. I have returned, but I'm penniless now. I need to use my royal, commanding aura to activate the Terracotta Warriors in Xi'an. Please send me some money. I don't need much; fifty thousand would be fine. Once I have accomplished my goal, I'll lead my troops over and appoint you Commander of the Imperial Guard."</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God laughed. "Is there anyone who still believes this in this day and age?"</p>

    <p>"Whether people believe it or not, I don't know... but one part of it is true."</p>

    <p>"Which part?"</p>

    <p>The next person in line stepped forward of his own volition and shook hands with Evil Sword God. "Hello, Lord Sword God, this one is Ying Zheng <sup>1</sup> ."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The Qin Emperor's name..)</dfn>

    <p>Evil Sword God: "???"</p>
