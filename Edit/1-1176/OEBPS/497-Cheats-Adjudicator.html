  <h1>Chapter 497 Cheats Adjudicator </h1>

  <div>

    <p>After the player with the ID SNAKE was punished by Wang Ming with a headshot kill...</p>

    <p>Sitting in front of the screen in an upscale apartment in Jinghua, an unkempt and scruffy fat nerd took his hands off the keyboard and sighed deeply.</p>

    <p>As he ate his instant noodles, he spoke on the phone. "Hello... is that Brother Baboon?"</p>

    <p>A voice as rough as a baboon's came over the line. "Mission accomplished?"</p>

    <p>The fat nerd answered blankly, "No... failed..."</p>

    <p>"Failed? Didn't you use cheats?" On the other end of the line, the man's eyes were full of disbelief.</p>

    <p>This Brother Baboon was a game live streamer who had been blacklisted by "Focus Report" a while back for using cheats and because of his rotten temperament. After that program ran his story, he knew it was over for him - he had been blacklisted by all the platforms, and he would perhaps never have the opportunity to make a comeback in the future.</p>

    <p>This had upset Brother Baboon for a very long time, so after careful scheming, he decided to take revenge on the most popular live streamers on the Internet. He would arrange for water friends to use cheats in each of these live streamers' games and have them experience the lowest points of gaming for themselves.</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang's water friends match was in fact a little experiment before Brother Baboon's all-out revenge attack, but he had never ever thought that the person he had set up in the game would actually fail.</p>

    <p>In front of this interrogation, the fat nerd also looked baffled. "I also feel it's very strange... I clearly unlocked infinite health, but I was still killed with a headshot by the other party using an Uzi; the other party must be an immortal, too..."</p>

    <p>"That's impossible!"</p>

    <p>Brother Baboon shook his head. "The cheat I bought is the most expensive one online! The monthly rental is two hundred thousand! When the game is updated, so is this cheat! There's no middleman involved <sup>1</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is adapted from the tagline for a secondhand car app..)</dfn>

    <p>"But Brother Baboon, this person's cheat is really more awesome than ours. If you don't believe me, open the live stream room, we can try and analyze it." The fat nerd didn't know how to explain it as he stirred his noodles with a fork.</p>

    <p>He opened Daoist Guang's live stream room as he said this.</p>

    <p>Then, a mouthful of instant noodles sprayed directly onto the screen. " <em>Pu </em>!"</p>

    <p>"What's wrong?" Brother Baboon asked.</p>

    <p>The fat nerd pointed at the screen, a noodle strand hanging out of one nostril. "What... what the fuck! Brother Baboon... all the people I killed just now have been resurrected!"</p>

    <p>Brother Baboon: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>For one moment in Daoist Guang's live stream room, the group of water friends that had been killed previously were all indescribably roused.</p>

    <p>The number of viewers in the live stream room immediately jumped to eight million...</p>

    <p>Sometimes, just watching a live streamer punish those cheaters could already hook more fans. But there were actually live streamers now who could get someone to directly reverse cheats and bring all the people who had been killed by cheats back to life... This operation left many people speechless for a moment.</p>

    <p>"So this TTXS is an anti-cheat punishment expert that Daoist Guang found?"</p>

    <p>"The hell! Lord Island is awesome! Where did he find this big shot?!"</p>

    <p>"Once I enter Light Chaser Sect, I swear I'll be a Light Chaser for the rest of my life! I'll never regret being a Light Chaser! Lord Island is awesome!"</p>

    <p>"I've become a fan! I already hated those cheaters to begin with, it feels so good to see the live streamer fix them!"</p>

    <p>This incident not only gave Daoist Guang's Light Chasers face, even casual fans felt proud at this scene.</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang saw a crazy increase in his fan tag numbers at that moment, and he was so swamped with wave upon wave of gifts that he couldn't read out all the names.</p>

    <p>And this scene, which could be called a miraculous "resurrection," instantly became a hot topic, and the link to Daoist Guang's live stream room was shared in a frenzy by online users.</p>

    <p>Only Daoist Guang himself had a dumb expression on his face.</p>

    <p>What anti-cheat punishment expert?</p>

    <p>He had never invited one over!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, at Lord Diulei's villa.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei glanced at his phone with a face full of amazement. "This Brother TTXS is pretty awesome..."</p>

    <p>In fact, he could pretty much guess the identity of this "TTXS."</p>

    <p>How many people were there in Huaxiu who could develop this type of uncanny anti-cheat punishment software as well as perfectly infiltrate the game to bring about a theoretically impossible resurrection miracle?</p>

    <p>To directly infiltrate the game terminal, modify the death records of those who had been killed by cheats in the game, and resurrect them - even Little Black didn't have this ability!</p>

    <p>In Huaxiu, the only person who could surpass Little Black's skill in this respect was Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>Moreover, even if Little Black had the skill to directly sneak into the game terminal to modify the data, any traces he might leave behind would be grounds for a lawsuit by the people of the game company, and the consequences would be unimaginable.</p>

    <p>After all, this was hacking.</p>

    <p>But if it was Wang Ming... he didn't have to worry about this issue at all.</p>

    <p>Leaving aside the fact whether the company would even to begin with catch Wang Ming sneaking in through the cracks of the game, even if they did want to investigate his identity, they would in the end still retreat.</p>

    <p>President Qi and General Yi were on the same level; even if the game company wouldn't give Wang Ming face, in the end, there was still President Qi...</p>

    <p>For one moment, Lord Diulei turned this thought over in his mind.</p>

    <p>Because there was a problem he found very strange. If "TTXS" was Wang Ming, it was impossible for him to have been expressly invited by Daoist Guang to take part in this match.</p>

    <p>In fact, Daoist Guang didn't know that Wang Ling had a cousin called Wang Ming at all... they weren't even chat friends, why would they play games together?</p>

    <p>So there was only one final answer...</p>

    <p>Wang Ming's participation had most likely been arranged by someone else.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei knew that Mother Wang didn't play games, and Er Ha was with Wei Zhi today...</p>

    <p>After Brother Ling, who was the person Brother Wang Ming obeyed the most in the Wang family?</p>

    <p>In his heart, Lord Diulei already had the answer.</p>

    <p>So now it was all very clear...</p>

    <p>This "TTXS" was definitely Brother Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>And it was definitely Brother Ling's father, Senior Wang, who had invited him over.</p>

    <p>As for Senior Wang's ID in the game, Lord Diulei also had an answer.</p>

    <p>He had heard that number one fan "Brother Sleep" mention online novels earlier; if Lord Diulei's guess was correct, this Brother Sleep was most likely Senior Wang.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei looked at the number of people in the game after the Samsara of Heavenly Life plugin had taken effect and resurrected players.</p>

    <p>In the top right corner of the screen, the current number of people was eighty-seven.</p>

    <p>All the water friends who had been killed by cheats had been resurrected.</p>

    <p>By now, it had already been a long time since the start of the game.</p>

    <p>At that moment, the system sent a prompt: <em>Thirty seconds to the next circle contraction...</em></p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was shocked. "Not good, Brother Ling! We need to run from the circle!"</p>

    <p>He nudged Wang Ling and then immediately opened the map.</p>

    <p>Then, he was amazed to discover that the building they were in was at the very center of the safe zone.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "???"</p>

    <p>" <em>Ei... </em>"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed with boredom.</p>

    <p>Because of the "Great Fortune Spell," he knew that the building he was in right now was one hundred percent the final god-blessed circle.</p>

    <p>So, no matter how much the circle shrunk in the end...</p>

    <p>Wherever he was, was the center of the safe zone...</p>

    <p>"..." It was the first time Lord Diulei felt that the game could actually be so boring.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On that day, after the water friends match had ended, Xiao Yin asked Lord Diulei curiously, "Thunder, Thunder! What does it feel like to play with Master?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei smiled and said, "All you need to do is lie back."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>
