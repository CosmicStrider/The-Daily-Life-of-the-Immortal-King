  <h1>Chapter 267 A Renminbi Player Has No Fear<sup>0</sup> </h1>

    <p>The voice might have been his imagination, but it had felt faintly real, like someone breathing into his ear, and Lie Mengmeng shivered despite himself... Why had he heard someone say "MMP"?</p>

    <p>Who on earth was it?</p>

    <p>But Lie Mengmeng already had no time to investigate the truth, because the main doors of the asylum had already been smashed open with an ambulance. He knew Wang Ling was studying at a Foundation Establishment high school, but when he saw Wang Ling pick up the ambulance with his own eyes, the image still gave him an uncontrollable shock.</p>

    <p>"Wow! Are all senior high school students at the Foundation Establishment stage this strong?!" It was very obvious that Lie Mengmeng knew very little about Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>On the side, Luo Chuang and Lord Diulei's lips twitched in unison when they heard Lie Mengmeng, because not all Foundation Establishment cultivators were this strong; it was just Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Although Lie Mengmeng wasn't an outsider and was also very familiar with Father Wang, it had already become an unspoken rule to not mention Wang Ling's true realm to the uninitiated. Both Luo Chuang and Lord Diulei were very clear on this, so when the two of them had seen Wang Ling and Lie Mengmeng, they had addressed Wang Ling as Brother Ling.</p>

    <p>After the main doors were successfully smashed open with the ambulance, the game's plot was smoothly set into motion. When Wang Ling and the others entered the asylum, they saw the back of a figure with dishevelled hair.</p>

    <p>It looked like a girl who was still wearing the blue and white stripes of the hospital gown, but it was very obvious that there was something wrong with her mentally. She stood in one corner with her back to Wang Ling and the others, mumbling to herself.</p>

    <p>It was quite a horrifying scene. This wasn't just a deadly game, but one combined with horror elements.</p>

    <p>Even though Wang Ling hadn't thought that he would be frightened, this still made him a little uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>In contrast, Lie Mengmeng was clearly a veteran, and he looked very excited as he directly rushed toward the girl. "She should be able to guide us to the room with the night vision camera. According to the script, once we find the camera, the last bit of power in the hospital will completely go out, and we'll only be able to rely on the night vision camera to move forward."</p>

    <p>"This game is really troublesome!" Lord Diulei sighed.</p>

    <p>If they could only use that night vision camera to move the plot forward, then the Heavenly Eye wouldn't be much use in this vast environment.</p>

    <p>"Next, we just need to touch the girl and the plot should move forward." Lie Mengmeng stretched out his hand to place it on the girl's frail shoulder.</p>

    <p>In the next moment, the girl jerked and turned toward him as if she'd been electrocuted. Her messy hair parted, and Lie Mengmeng could clearly see her mad, distorted face.</p>

    <p>Her face was completely blistered as if she had been burned. She shrieked wildly, and from this angle, they could clearly see this madwoman's jagged shark teeth.</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng was already used to this type of jump scare in a game, but in this extremely realistic environment, it still made him gasp.</p>

    <p>Frightened, he withdrew his hand, but the madwoman was quicker and grabbed his arm. Lie Mengmeng didn't expect such a frail girl to be so strong!</p>

    <p>"Not good!" Lord Diulei cried out in alarm. But it was too late. The madwoman already had a firm hold of Lie Mengmeng's arm, and she opened her mouth to bite him savagely with her bloody fangs!</p>

    <p>However, there was a " galala " sound, and very quickly, the madwoman's eyes widened with shock.</p>

    <p>Because there was a golden light wrapped around Lie Mengmeng's arm, and the moment she had bitten into it, the golden light had vibrated, then shattered her teeth.</p>

    <p>In a flash, her teeth were gone...</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Even Wang Ling couldn't deny that sometimes, karma was a magical thing.</p>

    <p>If Lie Mengmeng hadn't been going over the manuscript with Father Wang, he wouldn't have forgotten to bath for a few days, until Mother Wang had told him to clean up his messy appearance; if he hadn't cleaned up, he wouldn't have changed into the long johns which Mother Wang had given him; if he hadn't put those long johns on, the madwoman wouldn't have lost her teeth...</p>

    <p>Fortunately, even if the madwoman's teeth were gone, the plot was still proceeding smoothly.</p>

    <p>What kind of scene was this?</p>

    <p>A toothless madwoman with a heartbroken expression led the way. This made Wang Ling sincerely feel that there was something mystical about this scene.</p>

    <p>"So far, the plot is the same as the trial version I played!"</p>

    <p>As Lie Mengmeng had said, the madwoman guided them to a small room before she left silently. "When we enter, we should be able to find the night vision camera that will move the plot forward."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei nodded. Worried that something unexpected would happen again, he took the lead in opening the door. However, nothing happened, and instead, it was unexpectedly calm.</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang found the night vision camera Lie Mengmeng had mentioned on the floor, along with a medical evaluation report.</p>

    <p>Having played the trial version of the game, Lie Mengmeng was very familiar with the contents of the report. "If I recall correctly, this evaluation report has to do with that madwoman. The story in the demo version was the abridged edition; now, I can finally have a good look at the main plot!"</p>

    <p>"What does it say?" Lord Diulei asked.</p>

    <p>"In short, according to the evaluation report, this madwoman had been admitted to the asylum after domestic violence caused her to develop a psychiatric disorder. Her husband used to beat her with a magic weapon, so trying to bite my right arm earlier was actually one way she resisted the abuse after she went insane." Speaking of this, Lie Mengmeng recalled that terrifying scene when the madwoman had bitten him, and he couldn't help shuddering. "There's also some information on her husband in the report. He's a professional gamer, but because he often lost competitions and had a bad temper, he developed a habit of beating his wife."</p>

    <p>"Scumbag!" Luo Chuang and Lord Diulei said with one voice.</p>

    <p>"And in fact, this biochemical disaster in the asylum was caused by the madwoman's husband. After the media scandal, her husband was diagnosed with a manic disorder, so he was also sent here for treatment. But he repeatedly tried to escape from the asylum while he was here, and when he was hiding in the research laboratory, he accidentally overturned a box which contained a virus, thus causing this biochemical disaster."</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, Lie Mengmeng suddenly looked surprised. "Eh? The evaluation report actually mentions the magic weapon which the man used to beat his wife?"</p>

    <p>"What is it?" Luo Chuang was very curious.</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng: "It's... Death Announcement <sup>1</sup> ?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is the nickname of a
professional gamer who was
suspended from competing
after a live stream of him
beating his girlfriend went

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
