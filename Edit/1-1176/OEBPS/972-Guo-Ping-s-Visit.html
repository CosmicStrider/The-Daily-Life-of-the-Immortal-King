  <h1>Chapter 972 Guo Ping's Visit</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Withdrawing from Chen Chao's memory, Wang Ling pondered for a long while at his table.</p>

    <p>His concluding remarks in his composition on Chen Chao was like this:</p>

    <p>"When we are young, we might waver and feel helpless, but we still grow in the end. When you don't know the right path to choose, just become a man of indomitable spirit! You who stand on the mountaintop bathed in the sunlight, you seem so dazzling... as if you've been blessed..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>September 6th was the twenty-fourth day of the summer break. The day Earth would be establishing diplomatic relations with extraterrestrials was also approaching. There was one person's name on everyone's lips during this period, and that was Guo Ping, the scientist who had gone missing and was assumed dead on an exploratory mission of Divine Dao Star, before he was found to be alive.</p>

    <p>It thus made sense for him to become their diplomatic ambassador who would be responsible for establishing diplomatic relations between the entire cultivation world and alien lifeforms in the universe.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao was utterly thrilled by this. A huge figure had truly appeared in the Guo family this time; among all of Guo Hao's many uncles, Guo Ping had clearly leapt to the top as the strongest uncle.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao indeed found this hugely unexpected; this was because after their trip to Divine Dao Star last time, Wang Ling had replaced the memories of everyone from Number 60 High, so Guo Hao had utterly no impression of this Uncle Guo of his; what was in his memory was just a regular game NPC.</p>

    <p>"Bloody hell! Let me tell you, Guo Ping is actually my uncle, believe it or not!" In the Wechat small group chat, Guo Hao sent an astonished emoji.</p>

    <p>"I believe it! But why didn't you send this to the class group chat? There's more people there!" Chen Chao was amused.</p>

    <p>"It's still better to not make a big deal out of it. You're all my buddies, there's nothing for me to worry about in telling you. Other people may not buy it," said Guo Hao.</p>

    <p>Where there were people, there was envy. Guo Hao had thought about it before refraining from flaunting the fact that Guo Ping was his uncle; this was for his own good as well as Guo Ping's.</p>

    <p>If word got out, people might think he was talking big. If it reached some teacher who took it seriously and wanted him to invite Guo Ping to school to give a speech, that would be a real disaster.</p>

    <p>Actually, Guo Hao was quite self-aware. While it was true that Guo Ping was his uncle by blood, the problem was that they weren't close enough for him to call this uncle as he liked.</p>

    <p>"Are you very close with Guo Ping?" Su Xiao asked at that moment.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "Not really... but my dad should be. He should still have Guo Ping's contact. We have a Guo family WeChat group, and Uncle Guo Ping did join it before, but the group has been inactive for a long time. After I changed phones, if no one sends a message in the group, I probably wouldn't be able to find it."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "I saw your uncle on TV; for some reason, he feels familiar, like I've seen him somewhere before... He looks like the NPC of some game."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "Wang Ling, you're lurking again!"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao laughed. "Hasn't he always been like this? What, is this your first time meeting him?"</p>

    <p>They discussed Guo Ping in the group chat all the way until noon. There was no helping it - as the cosmic peace ambassador who would be establishing diplomatic relations with extraterrestrials, Guo Ping had already been in the headlines for days.</p>

    <p>Not only that, now that the cultivation world had links to these alien lifeforms, more and more information on these aliens as provided by Divine Dao Star were starting to appear in the public eye.</p>

    <p>Of course, the information online which had been made public was only part of the data, and didn't even make up five percent. During Divine Dao Star's extremely aggressive encroachment of the universe, they practically annexed over ninety percent of planets with intelligent lifeforms. However, the Divine Dragons never ever expected to ultimately be defeated by people from Earth.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>That very night after they chatted about Guo Ping in the group chat, a person came to the Wang family's small villa. Er Ha was lying on its stomach at the entrance, and when it looked up, it saw a man whose face was covered up and who was completely wrapped up in bandages. Hands in his pockets, the man slunk toward the entrance.</p>

    <p>"Who are you?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha got up and opened its mouth right away.</p>

    <p>Although it didn't sense any hostility from this person, it still retained a level of vigilance.</p>

    <p>"You can actually talk without changing forms?" The visitor stared blankly when Er Ha spoke in human language. He then took off his sunglasses, face mask, sun hat and coat, as well as the bandages wrapped around him. Finally, he suddenly peeled off a layer of skin from his face.</p>

    <p>This was a ready-made transfiguration mask sold on the market. It could also be custom-made, and all types of celebrity styles were available. It was similar to applying a facial mask; after it was on for five minutes, the mask would transform into the appearance you wanted.</p>

    <p>But to buy a transfiguration mask, one had to register with their real name and the transaction had to be recorded to prevent people from using the mask for illegal dealings.</p>

    <p>Huaxiu Alliance also strictly regulated the rights to produce transfiguration masks. Illegally producing them was a severe crime, and one could be sentenced to five hundred years and more if caught and found guilty.</p>

    <p>"..." Er Ha gaped in surprise at the entrance.</p>

    <p>This person spent a full five minutes removing all the components of his disguise - from head to toe, even all his leg hair had been completely covered.</p>

    <p>When he revealed his true self, realization suddenly dawned on Er Ha; it had seen this middle-aged man before.</p>

    <p>No kidding...</p>

    <p>It was impossible not to have seen him before! He had been all over TV in these two days!</p>

    <p>"Hello, I'm Guo Ping." The middle-aged uncle introduced himself.</p>

    <p>"Ask him why he's here." Wang Ling spoke telepathically to Er Ha from his bedroom on the second floor.</p>

    <p>He hadn't expected Guo Ping to come by the villa in the evening after talking about him in the group chat just that morning.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt it was a little strange. He remembered that he had replaced Guo Ping's memories. Although Wang Ling had indeed acted on Divine Dao Star, to Guo Ping's mind after his memories were replaced, the strongest person among those present should have been Bai Qiao.</p>

    <p>Logically speaking, Wang Ling should be a nobody after Guo Ping's memories were replaced!</p>

    <p>Why was Guo Ping suddenly calling on him?</p>

    <p>"I'm here to meet Ling Zhenren," Guo Ping replied.</p>

    <p>"Nope, my little master is busy with his homework and very busy," said Er Ha.</p>

    <p>"Let me help him with it then." Guo Ping smiled.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p><em>Shock! The famous scholar of Huaxiu's Magic Treasure Research Institute and currently the popular cosmic diplomatic peace ambassador Guo Ping is actually helping a senior high school student with his homework... Is this the degeneration of humanity or a loss of morality?!</em></p>

    <p>"You don't have to refuse me like that - Wang Ming that fellow already told me everything. Also, I helped him out in the beginning with upgrading the talisman. I've come this time just to thank Ling Zhenren." Guo Ping smiled helplessly.</p>

    <p>"Thank him?"</p>

    <p>"That's right. Wang Ming said that it was Ling Zhenren who provided the energy string which allowed me to travel through space for so long. If it wasn't for Ling Zhenren, I might still be drifting out in space right now."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
