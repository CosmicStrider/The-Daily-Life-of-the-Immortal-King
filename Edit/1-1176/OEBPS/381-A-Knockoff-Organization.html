  <h1>Chapter 381 A Knockoff Organization </h1>

  <div>

    <p>After about three or four minutes, Er Ha finally got rid of the spirit marker. A dog's body wasn't as soft as a cat; it had had to twist its body in some difficult positions in order to lick some parts. Fortunately, Er Ha's tongue was long enough; it hadn't completely abandoned the toad clan's tongue techniques.</p>

    <p>Thus, when Wei Zhi saw that Er Ha could stretch its tongue out to more than a meter in length, his entire frame of mind collapsed.</p>

    <p>As expected, Brother Dog wasn't just any ordinary dog! Wei Zhi sighed emotionally in his heart.</p>

    <p>After driving around in circles for a while, the men in black who had been in hot pursuit finally lost them in the flow of traffic.</p>

    <p>Er Ha's tactic had worked, though it wasn't sure if these men in black had other ways to find it.</p>

    <p>Although it had indeed escaped, Er Ha somehow felt that things weren't over yet.</p>

    <p>"Who the hell are these people? Why were they chasing you?" Now that they'd escaped pursuit, Wei Zhi stopped joyriding and smoothly drove along the road.</p>

    <p>"It's a bunch of people that seem to be posing as the Society of Saints," said Er Ha.</p>

    <p>"Society of Saints? They don't just take in people, but even spirit beasts too?" Wei Zhi laughed.</p>

    <p>"When I was at the assessment center, a test instructor told me that the Society of Saints does have spirit beast classes." Er Ha sighed. "But the people chasing me clearly aren't from the society. How can a state-certified institution be so violent?"</p>

    <p>"That's true."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi nodded. "These people are brave enough to pretend to be from the Society of Saints. Wouldn't it be awkward for them if they really met someone from the society?"</p>

    <p>Speaking about this, Wei Zhi immediately couldn't help complaining about the level of some imitations in Huaxiu nation. Imitations were basically for drawing attention. If a milk tea shop hit it big, then thousands and thousands of milk tea shops with similar names would suddenly spring up. If a hot pot restaurant hit it big, thousands of hot pot restaurants with similar names would pop up all over the country.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi reckoned that this fake Society of Saints was also an imitation group like that...</p>

    <p>"Brother Dog, where will you go now?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha thought for a bit. Although it might be safe if it went home now, there was no guarantee that the group of men in black wouldn't cause further trouble. Judging from their obsession with him, Er Ha thought that it was very likely that they would cause trouble in the future.</p>

    <p>And most importantly, Er Ha felt that it wasn't someone who could suffer and not do anything.</p>

    <p>Even if it wasn't a demon king any longer, since that group of people had come looking for it, then they definitely had to pay the price.</p>

    <p>"I want to destroy this group of people," said Er Ha.</p>

    <p>So it wasn't the time for it to go home yet.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "Brother Dog has a way of tracking them?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "I already remember the smell on them. As long as I can lock onto them with the Aura-Tracking Skill, we might be able to find their den."</p>

    <p>However, just then, Wei Zhi saw two sports cars following them through the rearview mirror.</p>

    <p>"Fuck, they caught up to us!" Wei Zhi slammed on the gas, straightaway choosing to speed up!</p>

    <p>He should have realized earlier that this group had put a spirit marker on the car in the chase before.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After several minutes of dealing with these people, Wei Zhi finally stopped the car in the mouth of an alley and the two of them abandoned it.</p>

    <p>Although Er Ha's saliva had the effect of removing the spirit marker, having it lick the car from front to back was clearly unrealistic.</p>

    <p>"How did this group of people mark us so accurately? I recall that this skill doesn't always work."</p>

    <p>After he got out of the car grumbling, Wei Zhi led Er Ha to a residential building. "See those apartments up ahead? That's where I live. Let's get inside first and then think about how to deal with this."</p>

    <p>Er Ha followed behind Wei Zhi as one person and one dog moved quickly.</p>

    <p>It was only in that moment that Er Ha realized that Wei Zhi's strength wasn't simple; when his feet touched the ground, they didn't make even the slightest sound. This proved that his body movements were very good, and was at a level that didn't match his aura.</p>

    <p>Hence, Er Ha thought that Wei Zhi had also hidden some of his strength, but exactly how strong he was remained to be seen.</p>

    <p>Generally speaking, in a family that raised spirit beasts mainly for combat, most of them weren't strong, and needed to rely on their spirit beasts to fill the gap between themselves and their opponents.</p>

    <p>But Er Ha didn't think much about it; after all, it had also hidden a lot of secrets from Wei Zhi... Everyone had secrets, and no one could live without any.</p>

    <p>Arriving at the ground floor of the apartment building, Wei Zhi took Er Ha upstairs to the twenty-third floor.</p>

    <p>Er Ha was surprised to find that there was only one door on the whole of the twenty-third floor.</p>

    <p>"Your place?" asked Er Ha.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi grinned. "To be exact, this whole floor is mine. There were initially four apartment units on this floor. I bought all of them, then knocked down the walls to create one unit."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..." This was simply unimaginable wealth!</p>

    <p>But as a side note, this also showed that the business of raising spirit beasts was indeed extremely profitable. In some sense, if this sunrise industry continued to expand in the future, it was very likely that it would be able to rival or even surpass established industries such as smithing or alchemy.</p>

    <p>For those who were very vain, having a powerful combat pet would add the light of glory to their own faces.</p>

    <p>Entering Wei Zhi's place, it was as if Er Ha had stepped into a garden. Wei Zhi's living room was very unique, and had been carefully decorated to imitate a natural green environment: there were a rock garden, a small brook, birdsong and fragrant flowers... this was just like a small forest!</p>

    <p>"I spent a lot of money creating this environment." Wei Zhi rubbed his head and smiled. Then he snapped his fingers, and the Pushing Large Butterfly which had been sitting motionlessly on his shoulder seemed to wake up. It slowly flew off before coming to rest on a flower petal.</p>

    <p>Er Ha finally realized that this green environment had been specially built for this Pushing Large Butterfly!</p>

    <p>"It's very safe here; those people shouldn't be able to find us," Wei Zhi said as he smiled.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "How can you be so sure?"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi nodded. "This isn't an ordinary apartment. It used to be a family apartment, and everyone who stayed here were senior officers in the military."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "...Are you a military second generation kid?"</p>

    <p>"My grandfather gave me this place. When it came to my father's generation, our family withdrew ties to the army because it was really too hard to balance raising spirit beasts and handling army matters at the same time." Wei Zhi shrugged. As he spoke, he tugged on a vine that was hanging down from the ceiling, and a side door immediately opened.</p>

    <p>"Come in, this is my bedroom," Wei Zhi said.</p>

    <p>Er Ha followed behind Wei Zhi and entered his bedroom, which seemed normal enough.</p>

    <p>Then, it saw Wei Zhi start to rummage around in the bedroom.</p>

    <p>"Are you hungry? I happen to have a bag of dog food here, which I got from my nephew," Wei Zhi said.</p>

    <p>"You have a nephew?" Er Ha was surprised.</p>

    <p>"We're actually not that far apart in age, but in terms of family hierarchy, I'm indeed his little uncle," Wei Zhi said.</p>

    <p>Moments later, he took out a white bag of high quality dog food from a cupboard, with three large words on it â€”"Soul Servant Shop."</p>

    <p>Hold on... Soul Servant Shop?</p>

    <p>Wasn't that Guo Hao's family's pet shop?</p>

    <p>Er Ha suddenly felt like it had learned some shocking secret.</p>
