  <h1>Chapter 1053 A Cockroach's Tenacity!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>To be honest, the moment there were unusual fluctuations, everyone almost stopped breathing. Inside the witness protection room, Miss Little Liang was even more nervous. After all, she was only two years old and still growing... Of course, the regular lifespan of a normal cockroach was roughly two years, but it was different in the cultivation world - Miss Little Liang was already two, but according to the life expectancy for cockroaches in the cultivation world, she was still just a child.</p>

    <p>By the way, Miss Little Liang was in fact Cockroach Wenqiang's daughter, with the full name Cockroach Little Liang.</p>

    <p>If Cockroach Wenqiang hadn't insisted, Little Liang would never have left her dark and damp little cave to testify for a human. Cockroaches and humans had always been at odds, and to this day, Miss Little Liang still remembered being chased and hit by humans.</p>

    <p>The truth was that the cockroach clan had always been timid, but humans still considered them an eyesore and would exterminate them as soon as they saw traces of cockroaches.</p>

    <p>Not all cockroaches liked to live in dirty places like sewers. Nowadays, more and more cockroaches had started to pursue a worldly lifestyle. Cockroaches in the cultivation world even decomposed all kinds of harmful rubbish for cultivators.</p>

    <p>All living things were equal and existed in an endless cycle, while the creatures at the top and at the bottom had cycles of their own.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, not everyone understood this principle.</p>

    <p>Inside the witness protection room, Miss Little Liang was a little apprehensive.</p>

    <p>At that moment, stifling murderous aura burst out of the computer screen in Miss Little Liang's room! â€” It was an indistinct shadow!</p>

    <p>But after it appeared, this shadow was clearly a little confused about the current situation.</p>

    <p>Because he didn't see anyone...</p>

    <p>"That Miss Little Liang isn't here?" Turned into a shadow, Wu Yuanji was full of doubts. He suspected that he might have gotten the location wrong, but this was clearly a witness protection room, and it was still in use. If she wasn't here, where would Miss Little Liang be?</p>

    <p>"Are you looking for me?"</p>

    <p>Just as Wu Yuanji was puzzling over it, a lovely and tender voice rang out. It sounded like a little girl, and was very clearly the voice of a very young lolita!</p>

    <p>Wu Yuanji scanned his surroundings carefully. He once again confirmed that there was no one here, let alone a fifty-year-old auntie live streamer with a lolita voice who conned a rich male shut-in out of a hundred thousand yuan<sup>1</sup>. The lesson from this live stream mishap was so bitter that at one point, Wu Yuanji had even thought of taking on this duped shut-in's case.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Refers to popular Chinese video blogger "Your Highness Qiao Biluo," whose beauty filter during her live stream glitched to reveal that she was much older than she appeared to be..)</dfn>

    <p>Mental trauma was sometimes far worse than a physical injury...</p>

    <p>"Are you looking for me?"</p>

    <p>Just as Wu Yuanji was feeling baffled, the lolita voice rang out again.</p>

    <p>Following the voice, Wu Yuanji searched the room carefully for a moment... Finally, he confirmed that it was coming from the fish tank in front of him...</p>

    <p>There were no fish in the tank - only a small cockroach that was looking up at him.</p>

    <p>"Cockroach..." Wu Yuanji was overwhelmed.</p>

    <p>He was pondering a possibility.</p>

    <p>Don't tell him the elusive Miss Little Liang was...</p>

    <p>"Are you looking for Miss Little Liang? I'm Little Liang." Miss Little Liang's feelers trembled as she looked at the shadow. The cockroach clan had a natural fondness for shadow, so the moment Miss Little Liang saw Wu Yuanji, she wasn't the least bit scared, and instead, felt a strange affinity for him.</p>

    <p>Recovering from his shock, Wu Yuanji started to laugh wildly in his heart.</p>

    <p>Crazy!</p>

    <p>These people had gone crazy!</p>

    <p>They actually wanted to use a cockroach as a witness? How could such an unreasonable request be granted?!</p>

    <p>But since Wu Yuanji was already here, he naturally couldn't leave empty-handed.</p>

    <p>Since he had confirmed that this cockroach was the elusive Miss Little Liang, then... Miss Little Liang, please go to hell...</p>

    <p>Wu Yuanji had already killed a lot of people who had gotten in his way, and naturally wouldn't feel sorry for a mere two-year-old cockroach at all.</p>

    <p>His shadow transformation started to churn violently and revealed an extremely ferocious expression. Spiritual pressure turned into a powerful astral wind before his palm landed.</p>

    <p>Bang! The fish tank shattered right away!</p>

    <p>Under such immense spiritual pressure, Miss Little Liang felt like she was teetering on the brink of death and quickly lost consciousness.</p>

    <p>"Lowly creature." Wu Yuanji withdrew his palm with a contemptuous sneer. It was just a cockroach. If he couldn't deal with a mere cockroach, he, the devil's lawyer, didn't need to live in the cultivation world anymore!</p>

    <p>But just as Wu Yuanji was about to leave, Miss Little Liang, who seemed dead already, actually woke up. Her feelers twitched, and then she actually flipped over and came back to life.</p>

    <p>"It... It hurts! I'm only two years old and still a kid. Can you not be so violent... If you have something to say, why can't we sit down and talk about it..." Miss Little Liang protested.</p>

    <p>She was actually still alive?</p>

    <p>The corners of Wu Yuanji's mouth twitched. Without the slightest hesitation, he swatted Miss Little Liang once again.</p>

    <p>This time, he confirmed that he had hit her.</p>

    <p>Even a cultivator wouldn't be able to take this blow of his. If he directly hit a cultivator under the Soul Formation stage in the head, they would die on the spot!</p>

    <p>Hmph -</p>

    <p>A mere cockroach still dared to kick up a fuss!</p>

    <p>Wu Yuanji removed his hand, as if he already knew how wretched Miss Little Liang would look.</p>

    <p>It was just a cockroach; he probably had flattened it into a meat patty.</p>

    <p>Wu Yuanji sneered.</p>

    <p>However, the flattened Miss Little Liang actually started to expand like an inflatable doll and came back to life yet again.</p>

    <p>"Hey... I already told you not to be so violent... You're breaking the law... the law which protects minors..." Miss Little Liang protested.</p>

    <p>Wu Yuanji was alarmed by such tenacity..</p>

    <p>So the rumor that cockroaches couldn't die was true?</p>

    <p>Was the cockroach truly an indestructible creature?</p>

    <p>Wu Yuanji clutched his head and felt that his worldview was about to collapse.</p>

    <p>But the truth was that it was only Miss Little Liang who was so tenacious, as she was a descendant of Cockroach Wenqiang. And what kind of cockroach was Cockroach Wenqiang? This was a cockroach that had grown to be the strongest by eating the leftover crumbs of Wang Ling's crispy noodle snacks!</p>

    <p>The offspring of the strongest cockroach would naturally inherit the ability to take a beating!</p>

    <p>And this formidable ability of Miss Little Liang's amazed all the police officers present.</p>

    <p>Thanks to Miss Little Liang buying them time, the police had already set up a barrier around the entire room while Wu Yuanji was attempting murder! The power was cut!</p>

    <p>When the lights in the room went out, Wu Yuanji, in his shadow form, finally sensed that this was a snare.</p>

    <p>He was trapped!</p>

    <p>Gao Tian and Zhuo Yi had long been waiting at the door, ready to tighten the net.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Lawyer Wu, you can't escape!"</p>

    <p>Gao Tian: "Lawyer Wu, you are charged with destroying evidence, mistreating animals and cultivating forbidden spells. You have the right to remain silent! Anything you say may be held against you in a court of law!"</p>
