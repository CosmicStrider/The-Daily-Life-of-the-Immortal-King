  <h1>Chapter 884 Devour</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The National Fitness Fire Treatment Program was a new scheme helmed entirely by Long Ming. It was wholly aimed at raising enough money for Night Chief in the short term to launch their next operation.</p>

    <p>Doing anything these days wasn't easy, and the costs of international crime were too high. President Bai had to switch identities each time he went to Huaxiu. The cost of buying an identity from Dark Network alone was sky-high. However, he was now an international SSSSR-Class wanted criminal. If customs discovered his true identity when he entered the country, he could be directly executed on the spot.</p>

    <p>There was a precedent for this type of wanted criminal: a Net criminal from the Dark Network named Rain Sunset Beast.</p>

    <p>This famous female fugitive controlled various major online forums and released all kinds of rumors, creating waves time and time again. She charged a fee to secretly delete or rig posts, as well as plant viruses that could paralyze the online network on a large scale. After Huaxiu Alliance approved the decision, an execution order went out on this Rain Sunset Beast.</p>

    <p>It was said that this Miss Rain Sunset Beast died like a dog, and became the first well-known keyboard warrior to be shot dead in Huaxiu's history.</p>

    <p>The Internet wasn't a place where you could get away with anything; she didn't know how much trouble her behavior caused for innocent people, and she never thought the consequences of her actions through.</p>

    <p>She had been discovered at the customs checkpoint on her way to Sun Island. When she was shot, a bullet the size of a durian passed right through her chest. Her eyes were wide open, and her face, which had been injected with hyaluronic acid, was splattered with blood. When she fell, her sharp awl-like chin, pierced the ground deeply...</p>

    <p>It was a traumatic scene for President Bai.</p>

    <p>The "instant execution bullet" used by customs was specially made and also known as Death Bullet. Each Death Bullet was extremely expensive, and ensured that criminals died on the spot.</p>

    <p>So President Bai had no choice but to buy new identities; this was an expense that he couldn't do without. Unless he had to smash an already cracked pot, there was no way he would create more trouble for himself.</p>

    <p>Death Bullets could cause extremely severe damage, and were simply his antithesis.</p>

    <p>President Bai shook his head and stopped thinking about it. "Our next operation will target Number 60 High - I'm going to wipe them out."</p>

    <p>"Since we have enough funds, it won't take much to blow up a mere Foundation Establishment school." Long Ming was also very confident.</p>

    <p>However, the two men still felt uneasy.</p>

    <p>And their uneasiness was because of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This youngster...</p>

    <p>No...</p>

    <p>They refused to admit that this was a sixteen-year-old youngster!</p>

    <p>It was obvious that this was a bigwig...</p>

    <p>But they had never been able to figure out why such a bigwig was studying at Number 60 High.</p>

    <p>Previously, President Bai had been stubborn about wanting to get revenge on Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But now he understood very well -</p>

    <p>That getting revenge on Wang Ling was basically impossible...</p>

    <p>So, after overall consideration, President Bai changed his plan and decided to blow up the school instead.</p>

    <p>While he was thinking, the siren inside Night Chief suddenly blared at that moment, the shrill alarm ringing throughout the entire Night Chief base.</p>

    <p>"What is it? Hurry up and check!" Bai Zhe frowned slightly. After moving several times, their base had settled underground, and was very difficult to detect.</p>

    <p>Knowing that Mixiu's FCI was searching for traces of Night Chief, Night Chief had been on high alert these two days.</p>

    <p>The technical staff pulled up a 3D model simulation of Night Chief's base, and the point of intrusion was marked with a heat source. A powerful energy could clearly be seen to swiftly cut through the earth like a sharp knife above the base as it invaded through the ground.</p>

    <p>"What is that?"</p>

    <p>"Ah! My glowing biceps <sup>1</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A line from the drama "My Own Swordsman.")</dfn>

    <p>"Ahhh! This little mouth is swallowing me! It hurts!"</p>

    <p>Soon, there were screams above them!</p>

    <p>President Bai's eyes were fixed in the direction that the heat source was invading from, and the corners of his mouth twitched. "Impudent! Actually coming to pick a fight with me?"</p>

    <p>He raised his head and gave a sharp cry. In a split second, an invisible sound wave was released, which blew open a massive hole in the ceiling.</p>

    <p>Seeing this, Long Ming felt an excruciating pain in his liver... The money they had just earned would have to be used to repair the base again! A large part of the reason why Night Chief hadn't been running smoothly recently was because of base damages and repairs; each time there was a fight inside the base, President Bai couldn't help punching holes in it.</p>

    <p>Long Ming wanted to cry - making money wasn't easy!</p>

    <p>And the biggest pain of all was that this sound wave actually had no effect on the intruder.</p>

    <p>Instead, the intruder crawled through the hole and into the base's central control room.</p>

    <p>It turned out to be a huge red worm, which stretched out its long tongue threateningly and swept up all the executive staff inside the base. Which each person it swallowed, its body grew in size.</p>

    <p>"Long Ming, hurry up and use your Long clan's secret art and get this greedy snake under control!" Seeing that his opponent was a worm, President Bai became less alarmed. The secret art of Long Ming's Long clan had a powerful control effect on insects; if they could capture such a strong worm, it would be a good fighting force!</p>

    <p>"Lord, please cover me!" Long Ming nodded, responding quickly as he swiftly formed a hand seal.</p>

    <p>He then slapped one hand down hard on the ground, and a series of runes blossomed like a lotus, forming a circular magic array.</p>

    <p>Long Ming then quickly cut his wrist, and his blood dripped onto the magic array. The instant it seeped into the magic array, a fragrance promptly filled the air.</p>

    <p>"This is..." President Bai frowned slightly.</p>

    <p>"This is our Long clan's secret array for trapping insects. Sprinkling my blood on this array will produce a unique scent which insects and spirit beasts alike are unable to resist. As long as the other party enters the magic array, they will be trapped."</p>

    <p>"But isn't it dangerous for you to stand here like this?" asked President Bai.</p>

    <p>"Rest assured, Lord, it's completely fine. These captured insects are drawn in completely by the scent of my blood. They'll forget my existence, so they won't attack me. I can use the Lo-"</p>

    <p>Before he could finish saying "Low Blood Reverse Kill <sup>2</sup> ," the worm above Long Ming's head directly stuck out its tongue and swept him up.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(A move in Arena of Valor with

weak character launch a

    <p>President Bai: "..."</p>

    <p>"He actually thought my venerable self was a worm? What an undiscerning man... but he does taste good..." Devil Gut Fungus Lord stared at President Bai. "I came from across the sea, and suddenly smelled a strong energy underground... So, it appears it was you..."</p>

    <p>President Bai: "Breaking in here, you have to pay the p-"</p>

    <p>Before he could say "price"-</p>

    <p>President Bai was also no more...</p>
