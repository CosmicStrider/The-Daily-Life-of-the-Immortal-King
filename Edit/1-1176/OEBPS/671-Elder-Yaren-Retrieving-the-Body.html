  <h1>Chapter 671 Elder Yaren Retrieving the Body</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Elsewhere, Elder Yaren was on his way to retrieve the body.</p>

    <p>After receiving Elder Ji Xing's order, Elder Yaren had instantly set off and was en route.</p>

    <p>Elder Yin was a semi-toxic person, so he was still useful even after death. One of the most sinister ways they could use Elder Yin's body was to toss it directly into Number 60 High tomorrow after the barrier was set up and cause it to explode.</p>

    <p>That way, the deadly poison stored inside Elder Yin's body would burst out and spread everywhere, and the entire school would suffer. Since the concentration of the poison was lower when diffused through the air, the teachers and students wouldn't die immediately. Instead, they would be covered from head to toe in poisonous blisters and experience unbearable pain and itching all over before they died.</p>

    <p>Thus, Elder Yin was a pawn that the Demon Hunters Association wouldn't give up so easily even after he was dead, since it would affect the later stages of their plan.</p>

    <p>Elder Yaren's exclusive life bonded magic treasure was a blood-red sickle called Conviction Hook.</p>

    <p>This was a third-class holy weapon, and while it was very lethal, the most frightening about it was its ability to rapidly change shape. In battle, this Conviction Hook could also turn into a blood-like substance and didn't have a particular fixed form.</p>

    <p>Elder Yaren also had his own way of locating Elder Yin. He was extremely sensitive to blood and could completely track down Elder Yin's blood after his sudden death. This was a powerful tracking method called Blood Hunt.</p>

    <p>Elder Yaren didn't think he would use this spell so soon after returning to Huaxiu, and moreover on one of their own people.</p>

    <p>Heh, really useless...</p>

    <p>Couldn't even handle two Golden Core good-for-nothings.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, Elder Yaren didn't treat this lightly, since given Elder Yin's strength on paper, he shouldn't have lost so miserably in the face of two Golden Core cultivators.</p>

    <p>It was probably because the two Golden Core cultivators had other self-defense measures, or the Almighty hidden behind the scenes had made a move...</p>

    <p>Flying on his Conviction Hook, Elder Yaren couldn't help turning this over in his mind.</p>

    <p>From the moment their plan started, the person they had to be the most wary of was the Almighty who looked like a teenager, but the information they had on his abilities was very limited.</p>

    <p>The Demon Hunters Association's reason for wanting to massacre everyone at Number 60 High this time was very simple.</p>

    <p>A revenge attack on Number 60 High was actually just one part of it.</p>

    <p>More importantly, they wanted to unearth the treasure hidden inside Number 60 High...</p>

    <p>They really couldn't think of any other reason apart from this for why an Almighty who looked like a teenager would hang around a Foundation Establishment high school to study.</p>

    <p>Maybe the secret of Heavenly Dao was hidden in this Number 60 High!</p>

    <p>Either way, all of this was just speculation. They could only wait until they set the plan moving tomorrow to know for sure.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, Xiao Yin was tying up an unconscious Elder Poisonous Dragon in Lord Diulei's villa. When he'd bought the collar before, he'd been given quite a few things as gifts.</p>

    <p>Besides the whip and the candle, there actually also was rope and a ball gag.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was gratified to realize that they were finally coming in handy!</p>

    <p>He trussed Elder Poisonous Dragon up in a very "artistic" pose, put the ball gag in his mouth, and then helped him put on a blindfold.</p>

    <p>It was still alright without the blindfold and ball gag, but once they were put on, Lord Diulei somehow felt it was strange!</p>

    <p>"Brother Xiao, this rope's not strong enough, he'll be able to break loose," Lord Diulei said as he looked at the rope.</p>

    <p>"It's fine, he's weak now, and I've cast a body-bind curse on him. Most importantly, I smeared this rope just now with my saliva, so it's a lot stronger now," said Xiao Yin.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei drew his hand back. "..." No wonder the rope felt wet just now; he'd thought it was the damp! It turned out to be saliva!</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin's saliva was somewhat an all-purpose substance!</p>

    <p>"Let's tie him up like this for now!" Xiao Yin clapped his hands, feeling a sense of accomplishment. He took out his phone and took several photos of Elder Poisonous Dragon from different angles.</p>

    <p>Then, he opened his WeChat Moments, did some editing... and sent!</p>

    <p>Actually, he didn't have many people in his WeChat Moments. It was just those in the chat group: Dog Bapi, Little Master, Cailian Zhenren, Immortal Toya, Lightning Dharmaraja and so on... Because he often stayed at home and had a smaller social circle, the number of people Xiao Yin knew was actually very few; the only other friend he'd made was Wei Zhi, and even then that was through Er Ha.</p>

    <p>Because he preferred to play team games, Xiao Yin would call Wei Zhi to play two-player mode when he was free.</p>

    <p>But even in such a small group of friends, the photos still had an explosive visual impact after they were sent out.</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren was directly stunned, and gave a thumbs-up before replying, "What the hell?! Is this Senior Immortal's house? Xiao Yin, you're playing S&amp;M so openly, does Senior Immortal not care?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei took out his phone and skimmed his Moments. He sighed silently. "..."</p>

    <p>He couldn't control it!</p>

    <p>He couldn't control this "Silver"!</p>

    <p>Lightning Dharmaraja: "I never thought Brother Xiao Yin would be like this... I... I like it!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Wow, so you're into this? Fine, I'll find one for you later. There're plenty of old fellows and ladies at the market when I go for a walk. Take your pick."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin cocked his head. "There's nothing wrong with this pose! My grandfather taught me to tie like this in my clan back then. He said that it works particularly well, and he often used it on my grandmother. I've been practicing this binding art for a long time!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren: "..."</p>

    <p>Lightning Dharmaraja: "..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "Brother Xiao Yin, how about you take off the blindfold and ball gag... It'll look a little better."</p>

    <p>"Is that so?" Xiao Yin was actually a little puzzled. Since the ball gag and blindfold were freebie accessories, there definitely had to be a use for them somewhere. But after seeing everyone echo Immortal Toya, Xiao Yin took off Elder Poisonous Dragon's blindfold and ball gag.</p>

    <p>In the end, Elder Poisonous Dragon was actually roused from his faint by the slight movements.</p>

    <p>He found himself trussed up in a very shameful pose, with Xiao Yin holding a blindfold and a ball gag! And the ball gag was still wet with his saliva!</p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon stared at Xiao Yin with a terrified look on his face. "What... What did you do to me?!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin took out his phone and showed the photos to Elder Poisonous Dragon. "Nothing, I just took some photo evidence. When you were unconscious, I helped put you in a lot of positions... Look, they're actually quite artistic!"</p>

    <p>At that very moment, Elder Poisonous Dragon's face turned red.</p>

    <p>He felt that he already no longer had face to continue living.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Roughly five minutes later, in the military tent, Elder Ji Xing saw Elder Poisonous Dragon's soul mark disappear like a burst of light.</p>

    <p>In the end, Elder Poisonous Dragon died under the romance of his own drill.</p>

    <p>He transformed his tongue into a drill and used it to completely blow apart his own skull...</p>
