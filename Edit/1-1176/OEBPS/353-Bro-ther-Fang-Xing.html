  <h1>Chapter 353 Bro...ther Fang Xing? </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was past ten o'clock at night, and Wang Ling and Fang Xing were dealing with the array when Wang Ming sent word that Xiao Yuncheng was now under control. Furthermore, they had also captured a mid-level member of Shuigou Sect, Chou Shisi. After a preliminary interrogation, however, they had discovered that he indeed knew very little.</p>

    <p>Despite this, Wang Ling at the very least now knew something that could be considered pretty important, and that was that Shuigou Sect's hierarchy was based on appearance. Wang Ming had taken a photo to send to Wang Ling, and had even used the beauty filter so that it wasn't too vomit-inducing... but even with the filter on the maximum setting, this face was still incredibly horrific to look at.</p>

    <p>The middle-aged man who had been arrested in the park previously for kidnapping young girls had also been very ugly, but at the very damn least he still had regular features... In comparison, this Chou Shisi's features just looked like paste!</p>

    <p>This also confirmed a second thing, which was that the middle-aged man who had been caught in the park was just a Shuigou Sect small fry.</p>

    <p>As Fang Xing was examining the structure of the invisible magic array, he glanced at the image from Wang Ming out of the corner of his eye, and he couldn't help the way his expression twisted.</p>

    <p>With just a casual look over Wang Ling's head, Director Li was also dumbstruck. "Hahaha! This person's face is a real piece of work! Did Picasso draw it?"</p>

    <p>Fang Xing: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Then the question now was, if Chou Shisi was already that ugly, then how ugly were the top individuals in Shuigou Sect?</p>

    <p>As soon as they found out about this ranking system in Shuigou Sect, this was the one question that almost everyone automatically thought of.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Just as Wang Ling had said, analyzing an array took skill. It wasn't that he couldn't decipher the invisible magic array under their feet; it was just that he wasn't skilled at cracking the code. Furthermore, if he had to use his Heavenly Eye to do it, it would be just like making a mountain out of a molehill.</p>

    <p>If all else failed, he would have to resort to force.</p>

    <p>This had always been Wang Ling's style growing up, from when he had crushed that magic sword as a child.</p>

    <p>"The array is a little tricky, but it can definitely be cracked." Fang Xing lowered his head to the ground and stared at it for two or three minutes. He then nodded his head, then straightaway bit his finger and drew a form-revealing seal with his blood.</p>

    <p>Narrowing his eyes, Wang Ling examined the seal. Immortal She Pi had been a renowned array expert back then; more than just a specialist, he had been at the very least a legendary master.</p>

    <p>Among the many things that Fang Xing had inherited, Wang Ling thought there probably had to be notes that Immortal She Pi had left behind as an array expert. This was the real treasure, and what all the array experts were frantically pursuing to this day.</p>

    <p>In one phrase, that notebook in magic array circles... was the "One Piece" <sup>1</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(From the manga of the same name, which refers to the ultimate treasure all pirates are after ..)</dfn>

    <p>It was obvious that Fang Xing had inherited Immortal She Pi's teachings.</p>

    <p>After all, he was Immortal She Pi's biological son.</p>

    <p>"I'm ready!"</p>

    <p>After drawing the form-revealing seal, Fang Xing placed both of his hands flat on the ground, and with a shout, he poured a torrent of spirit energy into the ground.</p>

    <p>In the blink of an eye, the invisible magic array revealed itself in spectacular fashion; it was a complex weave of runes that had a radius of six meters. After it was exposed, a formless shape lunged at Wang Ling from the center of the magic array, like a ferocious beast.</p>

    <p>This was the array spirit!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling reacted very swiftly as he stretched out his hand to grab hold of it, rendering it immobile.</p>

    <p>After that, he tightened his grip slightly, and with a bang, the shape instantly exploded.</p>

    <p>This scene astounded Director Li, who was standing on the side. Although this wasn't a holy array, it still ranked as a top array... but this array spirit actually hadn't even been able to survive half a second in Wang Ling's hand.</p>

    <p>Ling Zhenren's strength was too terrifying!</p>

    <p>With the array spirit destroyed, the magic array was no longer functional. But one thing still remained unclear, and that was the purpose of this array.</p>

    <p>Staring at the exposed array, Wang Ling pondered over the runes left behind.</p>

    <p>"If I'm not wrong, this is a resonance magic array."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing crouched down and brushed one hand over the runes. "Resonance arrays usually don't show up alone. There are probably more of them on the rooftops of nearby buildings."</p>

    <p>"What's the purpose of setting up all these arrays?" Director Li asked curiously.</p>

    <p>"After studying it, I can confirm that these are probably cache arrays for amassing spirit potential on a large scale..."</p>

    <p>Eyes narrowed, Fang Xing's smile gradually disappeared, and his expression suddenly turned solemn as he sighed. "If I'm right, this is most likely Shuigou Sect's true purpose in getting the students to ingest the spirit fruit: the amount of spirit energy they'll be able to collect from the spirit explosions will be unimaginable!"</p>

    <p>Director Li's face changed color. "What do they want with so much spirit energy?"</p>

    <p>Fang Xing stood up, his severe expression smoothing out. "We won't know without further investigation. But one thing we know for sure is that Shuigou Sect doesn't have pure motives."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling also stood up and looked calmly at Fang Xing. He already had the answer, but he didn't say anything; he still needed to catch and interrogate someone from the other side in order to verify his deduction.</p>

    <p>Director Li furrowed his eyebrows; he felt like he had just learned something extremely serious. "Then what should we do now?"</p>

    <p>"Now, we can only ask Ling Zhenren to protect the students."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing raised his head to look at Wang Ling with a smile. "I'll check out the nearby buildings; if there are any other magic arrays, I'll destroy them."</p>

    <p>Director Li: "Brother Fang Xing... on your own? You'll be fine?"</p>

    <p>"Of course, I'll be alright." Fang Xing smiled faintly.</p>

    <p>In the next moment, Director Li saw him stamp one foot, and ten scale pieces actually appeared, floating around Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>When this youngster swallowed these scales, Director Li then saw his frame shrink and her hair visibly lengthen down to her waist. Obsidian armor formed over her, molding itself evenly to her ample figure.</p>

    <p>What the fuck?!</p>

    <p>What was going on?</p>

    <p>Director Li was stupefied at this scene.</p>

    <p>"I'm off." Fang Xing's lips curved up, but it was completely different to her male form; in this form, her face instead had more of a seductive charm.</p>

    <p>She pushed off on her feet and straightaway disappeared like the wind, so fast that Director Li's eyes were unable to catch up.</p>

    <p>It took him a very, very long time to come back to his senses.</p>

    <p>With a stunned expression on his face, he turned around to stare at Wang Ling: "Senior Ling... from now on, should I call this person Brother or Sister Fang Xing?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
