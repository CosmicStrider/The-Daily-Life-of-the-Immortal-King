  <h1>Chapter 857 Enlightened iPad</h1>

  <div>

    <p>On the morning of August 18th, Wang Ling stared at an old iPad on the table in deep thought.</p>

    <p>This was the very first iPad model, and was very old. Because he had broken it several times before when he wasn't careful, Wang Ling later stowed it away under the bed after Wang Ming sent him the customized watch. The iPad was covered in dust when Wang Ling took it out from under the bed, since it hadn't been used for a very long time.</p>

    <p>Squatting on the side, Er Ha raised its head for a look. Besides the iPad, it also saw a golden talisman on the table. With one look, Er Ha immediately determined that this golden talisman wasn't any ordinary thing; the aura of Heavenly Dao on it was so thick that it created enormous pressure.</p>

    <p>The person Wang Ling wanted to investigate today was Gu Shunzhi.</p>

    <p>And it was vital for Wang Ling to find out exactly who he was.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High School's evaluation of transfer students was already over. Liu Qingyi and Wang Zhen were assigned to Class Two where Fang Xing was, while Gu Shunzhi, whom Wang Ling knew nothing about, had in fact been assigned to his class.</p>

    <p>There were now sixteen people in their class...</p>

    <p>When it was fifteen, Wang Ling could get eighth place.</p>

    <p>With sixteen people... what on earth should he do to keep his marks down in the future?!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had a headache!</p>

    <p>Most importantly, Time Heavenly Dao had already mentioned that this person was from the future... So why had this person traveled back in time to this current era?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had to know the answer.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>To find out Gu Shunzhi's origins, Wang Ling had to first determine which era Gu Shunzhi was from. With the golden time talisman from Time Heavenly Dao in hand, Wang Ling decided to enlighten this old iPad.</p>

    <p>Enlightening gremlins was in fact a very simple procedure: it was just a matter of bestowing a Heavenly Dao on them. But the process this time was a little more troublesome, because Wang Ling had to fuse it with the golden time talisman.</p>

    <p>This was Er Ha's first time seeing its Little Master Ling enlighten a gremlin, and its eyes were wide open! Wasn't this godly operation usually very difficult to carry out? After an ordinary item was enlightened to instantly possess strength at the Soul Formation stage plus the abilities of Heavenly Dao, what kind of divine power would that be?</p>

    <p>But it seemed that enlightening gremlins wasn't something that could be used on humans.</p>

    <p>Er Ha thought that otherwise, Father Wang and Mother Wang would have been enlightened early on...</p>

    <p>Not long ago, Er Ha had actually asked Father Wang and Mother Wang why they didn't cultivate. Even if they didn't have the aptitude for it, with Little Master Ling's heavenly abilities, supporting Father Wang and Mother Wang in their cultivation would be a piece of cake. In modern cultivation society, in particular, those rich second generation with low aptitudes for cultivation could still take drug supplements to become Golden Core cultivators.</p>

    <p>But Father Wang and Mother Wang, as well as Old Man Wang, seemed more zen when it came to cultivation.</p>

    <p>Later, Father Wang gave Er Ha the reason.</p>

    <p>He asked Er Ha in turn: Why did so many people want to be cultivators?</p>

    <p>In modern cultivation society, which was a peaceful age free of conflict, Father Wang felt that the reasons why so many people were still dedicated to cultivation were the following:</p>

    <p>First: For the family's benefit.</p>

    <p>Children of large families had to take the cultivation path. When considering a marriage alliance in the future, realm was one of the major marriage conditions: only a high realm would reassure the bride's side, unless the groom married into the bride's family instead. Of course, there was no problem with benefits in the Wang family - Er Ha had personally experienced life in the Wang family's small villa for itself, and it was very comfortable!</p>

    <p>Second: For the sake of making one's presence felt.</p>

    <p>Modern cultivators were effectively managed under a streamlined state system, and the light forces were also officially under the jurisdiction of organizations like Huaxiu Alliance. The bloody battles to annex other sects already no longer existed, and instead, sects now engaged in business competition.</p>

    <p>To show off how strong they were, modern cultivators established places similar to martial arts schools, such as pet training centers, which were specially set up so that cultivators could show off their spirit beasts... However, chasing a sense of presence didn't exist in the Wang family's small villa. What Father Wang and Mother Wang taught Little Master Ling was very clear: keep a low profile...</p>

    <p>And then, the third and final point that Father Wang brought up.</p>

    <p>For the sake of a long lifespan...</p>

    <p>The higher the realm, the longer the lifespan, which was common sense.</p>

    <p>But that wasn't an issue in the Wang family either; as long as Father and Mother Wang wanted to live a little longer, Wang Ling could casually wave his fingers and reset their lifespans - it was like wiping clean the Book of Life and Death. Or if there came a day when Father and Mother Wang felt that the world wasn't worth living in, and wanted to experience what it was like to be laid to rest, they could in fact choose to die at any time. If they regretted it, Little Master Ling could also use the Impure Earth Reincarnation Spell...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Placing the golden talisman which Time Heavenly Dao had given him on the iPad, Wang Ling's pupils emitted a golden light.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Ling was choosing a Heavenly Dao!</p>

    <p>Generally speaking, the Heavenly Dao which Wang Ling used to enlighten gremlins were all ones that he seldom used. This was because once a Heavenly Dao was used to enlighten a gremlin, if Wang Ling used the Heavenly Dao himself, its power would be reduced by half. However, Wang Ling also had the ability to withdraw the gremlins he had enlightened.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Ling was having difficulty choosing...</p>

    <p>Which Heavenly Dao should he use?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling pondered for ten or so minutes, chin in hand.</p>

    <p>And these ten or so minutes were often the longest part of the enlightenment process.</p>

    <p>Lying on its stomach, Er Ha had almost fallen asleep, when Wang Ling's eyes lit up.</p>

    <p>He had made up his mind.</p>

    <p>The Great Fortune Spell!</p>

    <p>He decided to fuse this Heavenly Dao with the iPad to enlighten it!</p>

    <p>Pointing at the iPad with his sword fingers <sup>1</sup> , countless golden runes immediately appeared at the tips of his fingers. The runes flowed from his fingertips to the old iPad, which visibly took on a brand new look.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A curled fist with the index
and middle fingers stretched
out ..)</dfn>

    <p>Then, Er Ha saw this iPad, bathed in a golden light, actually grow a fishtail...</p>

    <p>This iPad, which had turned into an enlightened gremlin, unexpectedly transformed into a koi fish with black and white stripes. The scariest thing was that this koi was the size of a small child and could stand on its tail, the iPad screen embedded in its belly.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Gazing at the enlightened iPad, Wang Ling said, "Remember your Daoist name, iPoid."</p>

    <p>"Yes, my lord." The voice which came out of the koi's fish mouth sounded a little comical. "Supreme and Venerated Lord, please name the iPad in my belly."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling lowered his head and thought for a bit.</p>

    <p>He was actually bad at giving names...</p>

    <p>"Random name!" Wang Ling stared at the iPad.</p>

    <p>Then, the screen in the koi's belly flashed a few times.</p>

    <p>Four words were displayed on it: Book of Sage Immortal.</p>

    <p>That was the name of the koi iPad, and its Daoist name which Wang Ling had already decided on earlier was: iPoid.</p>
