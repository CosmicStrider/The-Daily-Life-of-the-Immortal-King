  <h1>Chapter 996 The King's Treasure Pants</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Zhen was sure that Liu Qingyi this girl had definitely done it on purpose! Since ancient times, there had been countless proverbs that testified to a woman's strong desire for revenge -"a woman's heart is like a needle at the bottom of the sea,""the most malicious is a wife's heart" and so on...</p>

    <p>There had never been any feelings between them to begin with. It was because of a misunderstanding created from trying to escape marriage that they had both wound up fleeing to Earth.</p>

    <p>Now, in order to learn from Wang Ling, both Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi had joined Number 60 High, and Liu Qingyi was the first person that Wang Zhen had to be vigilant against in school. From the moment he had chosen to enter Number 60 High, he had basically already been mentally prepared.</p>

    <p>As a man, it was beneath him to bicker with Liu Qingyi, but the problem was that the girl seemed to be tormenting him on purpose!</p>

    <p>"It, it hurts!!" Wang Zhen was caught in the barrier's storm fissures. Powerful spatial forces tore at his body, making him feel as if insects were biting him all over.</p>

    <p>"I can't, I can't stand it..." Wang Zhen's face twisted with tremendous pain.</p>

    <p>"Are you a man or not?" Liu Qingyi was right at the back as she completely treated Wang Zhen as a meat shield.</p>

    <p>"Ahhh! I can't, I'm going to break, break apart..."</p>

    <p>"Just hang on a little longer! We're already in so deep! We just need to go a little deeper!"</p>

    <p>"Don't use such ambiguous words!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>With Liu Qingyi holding Wang Zhen in front of her as they moved forward, they soon saw a light up ahead.</p>

    <p>They had arrived.</p>

    <p>Inside the barrier, the battle against the imposters was ongoing.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was following the battle situation carefully on Book of Sage Immortal's screen.</p>

    <p>"Can they really succeed..." Zhuo Yi had some doubts about Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi's participation.</p>

    <p>It was undeniable that these two were top experts from Nine-fold Star, but his fake <em>shifu</em> wasn't easy to deal with!</p>

    <p>"This deployment of forces is currently the most suitable strategy if we want to catch the other party alive," Book of Sage Immortal replied. "I've already done the exact calculations: if we redouble our efforts and kill the other side, I'm afraid that we won't be able to learn their true objective. But what Mr Zhuo said isn't unreasonable. While this deployment will guarantee that we can catch them alive, it certainly isn't good if our side winds up sustaining heavy losses."</p>

    <p>"Do you have an idea?"</p>

    <p>"Of course."</p>

    <p>With a thought from Book of Sage Immortal, a pair of navy blue pants floated out of Wang Ling's wardrobe as if it had a will of its own.</p>

    <p>When the pants flew into Zhuo Yi's hands, he thought, "Shifu's school pants?"</p>

    <p>"My lord's school pants have a character of their own. There's a pocket on the right side." Book of Sage Immortal said, "It looks like a regular pair of school pants, but no one would expect its pocket to in fact contain some another profundity."</p>

    <p>"What, what do you mean?" Holding his shifu's school pants, the coarse fabric made Zhuo Yi shiver all over... He, he was actually touching pants his <em>shifu</em> had worn! â€” No, he had to calm down!</p>

    <p>"While my lord usually ends a battle with one or two slaps, and will occasionally summon Lord Jingke to appear, he in fact also has a full set of 'King's Treasure Pants'! Of course, the character here is for the word 'pants<sup>1</sup>.'"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Referring to how the Chinese word "ku" for "pants" has the same pronunciation as for "store" in "treasure house" or "storage.")</dfn>

    <p>"What is this thing..." Zhuo Yi was stupefied.</p>

    <p>"Every year on my lord's birthday, all the Heavenly Dao will send him gifts, many of which are magical artifacts. My lord doesn't think much of them, but it isn't nice to refuse their good intentions, so he set up this King's Treasure Pants and put away all these magic treasures here."</p>

    <p>"So it's a storehouse for magic treasures." Zhuo Yi understood.</p>

    <p>"No, Mr Zhuo, you don't understand the meaning of the King's Treasure Pants," Book of Sage Immortal said.</p>

    <p>Its voice slowly turned deep. "A King's Treasure Pants would naturally contain top-grade magic weapons of heaven and earth, and gifts from the Heavenly Dao are of this standard. But what my lord's King's Treasure Pants contain are all world-defying magic treasures, which are also the divine artifacts that cultivators talk about."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>"From the moment my lord was a year old, all the Heavenly Dao started to give him all kinds of world-defying magic treasures as gifts. When they later saw how he stored all these magic weapons in the King's Treasure Pants, they took the initiative to place their gifts inside the King's Treasure Pants every year on my lord's birthday. There are now tens of thousands of world-defying magic treasures inside the King's Treasure Pants."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was dumbstruck: 0_O...</p>

    <p>Tens of thousands of world-defying magical artifacts...</p>

    <p>What was more, they were all birthday gifts which his <em>shifu</em> had forgotten about.</p>

    <p>No wonder Heavenly Dao was never able to win his shifu's favor! It turned out that they were sending him the wrong birthday gifts every year!</p>

    <p>How could they not give his <em>shifu</em> crispy noodle snacks as birthday gifts?</p>

    <p>But having said that, Zhuo Yi was shocked by such a tremendous amount of world-defying magical artifacts.</p>

    <p>Whatever sort of world-defying magical artifacts they were, cultivators often shelled out hefty prices in their pursuit of top-grade equipment!</p>

    <p>For a full set of quality equipment, some people would go deep into treacherous locations and narrowly escape death to collect the materials needed for forging.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, his <em>shifu</em> was an immortal...</p>

    <p>A regular person would never understand how an immortal worked.</p>

    <p>"Alright, stop spacing out, Mr Zhuo. Since you want to help Miss Liu Qingyi and the others, you can start opening the express deliveries now. All these birthday gifts are piled up in the King's Treasure Pants, all unopened. You are free to choose the magic treasures for Miss Liu and the others to use."</p>

    <p>"Alright..."</p>

    <p>Without further ado, Zhuo Yi directly stuck his hand into the King's Treasure Pants.</p>

    <p>He took out several gift boxes in a row, all of different sizes and wrapped exquisitely, and couldn't help rubbing his hands together.</p>

    <p>Who knew what sort of things he would unwrap.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Inside the Office of Strategic Deception's barrier, Liu Qingyi and Wang Zhen's arrival redressed the balance in battle.</p>

    <p>Nine-fold Star's cultivation levels weren't measured in the same way as on Earth.</p>

    <p>The two imposters felt some pressure at Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi's appearance.</p>

    <p>"What should we do?" Female Fang Xing was flung backward after exchanging palm strikes with Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>Fake Wang Ling simply flicked a finger behind her to steady Fang Xing. The two pulled back to a distance of a dozen or so meters away.</p>

    <p>"We have no other choice: our mission is to kill everyone here at all costs." Fake Wang Ling had an evil expression on his face.</p>

    <p>"Are you going to use that technique..." Female Fang Xing was a little surprised. She hadn't expected things to reach this point so soon.</p>

    <p>"This is the only way now to complete the mission. We can't put it off any longer." When the fake Wang Ling finished speaking, he rose up from the ground, slowly opened his arms wide, and said in a chuuni voice, "Let the world feel the pain..."</p>
