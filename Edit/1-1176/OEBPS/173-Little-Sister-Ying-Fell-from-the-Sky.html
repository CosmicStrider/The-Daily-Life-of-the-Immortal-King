  <h1>Chapter 173 Little Sister Ying Fell from the Sky </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Whether it was in inner or outer circles, everyone had always had different opinions of Zhuo Yi, this "young and promising" Director of the General Administration of 100 Schools. Some thought that he had indeed worked his way up through his own strength, while some thought that he had taken advantage of his connections and gotten in through a back door.</p>

    <p>Only Zhuo Yi knew the truth of the situation... he might be winning at life without trying, but it was just as ineffable to him.</p>

    <p>Secretary Sun Dakang had summoned him to the prison and he had helplessly seen how that killer maiden had broken out. To be honest, Zhuo Yi was quite upset because he really hadn't been able to do anything to help this time.</p>

    <p>Another person who was also similarly upset was Warden Liang. After all, the girl had fled right under his nose. In fact, they had acted promptly after she had escaped them, and Warden Liang had originally thought that they could catch her before things got even more serious, but in the end, she had still run away, right in front of Secretary Dakang.</p>

    <p>Warden Liang was seeing Zhuo Yi off at Songhai First Prison's entrance. Even if he had already clarified matters in a statement to the media, he still had to shoulder this responsibility. He had to capture and detain the girl again to redeem himself, otherwise he would have to be punished.</p>

    <p>Judging from the current situation, a demotion was undoubtedly inevitable... he had worked in the prison for so many years, and this really was the first time he had encountered such a situation. In the end, he could only acknowledge his bad luck.</p>

    <p>Beyond the front gate of the prison was the barrier. Two days ago, the girl had smashed an opening in it, and after some emergency repairs, it had more or less been restored.</p>

    <p>Under normal circumstances, only prison staff could pass through the barrier regularly; any other person had to be accompanied by a staff member.</p>

    <p>As Zhuo Yi was being guided to the entrance by Warden Liang, he felt a little depressed. It was also easy to imagine that Warden Liang was feeling quite gloomy in his heart as he considered how he was going to write his self-reflection. Writing the self-reflection was a learned skill; if he wrote it carefully, his superior might consider the many years of hard work which he had put in, and lighten his punishment.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi really didn't know how to console him, and could only sigh. "Warden Liang, don't fret. The saying puts it well: the cart will find its way round the hill when it gets there..."</p>

    <p>Warden Liang's eyes were sad and bitter.</p>

    <p>"Sometimes, when you are lost in despair, a miracle might happen." Zhuo Yi consoled him as he pointed to the sky. "Look, Warden Liang, when god closes a door, he will definitely open a window."</p>

    <p>Exactly when Zhuo Yi finished speaking, a brightly colored cloud suddenly appeared in the air.</p>

    <p>It was accompanied by a humming sound.</p>

    <p>A dark shadow fell out of this cloud with a plop...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It had to be mentioned that this "express delivery" from Wang Ling was very timely.</p>

    <p>And so, just like this, Jiang Liuying was captured once again.</p>

    <p>Warden Liang held an emergency conference, and forced Zhuo Yi, who had been about to leave, to stay back.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi understood that there was a procedure which government departments had to follow in doing things. As for how the Shadow Stream maiden had been caught, this was a little hard to explain, since this person had indeed just suddenly fallen from the air in front of their eyes. When it had happened, Zhuo Yi had still been pointing at the sky; this was a scene which the prison officers around them had witnessed.</p>

    <p>During the conference, everyone was quietly waiting for Warden Liang to report the situation.</p>

    <p>The old Secretary was sitting on the side and drinking tea with an expression as if he was watching a play.</p>

    <p>In fact, everyone had privately spread word of the general situation, and more or less understood what had happened.</p>

    <p>Head lowered, Zhuo Yi felt restless in his seat, and somehow had a bad feeling.</p>

    <p>Warden Liang started to speak.</p>

    <p>"The reason why we could resolve the matter of this prison break so quickly is without doubt due to the results of our Songhai First Prison's colleagues working as one in their determined search efforts. Of course, among all of them, the person we have to thank the most is our Director Zhuo!"</p>

    <p>Upon saying this, Warden Liang couldn't help tearing up. "To be frank, previously I had misunderstood Director Zhuo, but his performance was truly amazing. Our Huaxiu government is really fortunate and the people are really lucky to have an official like Director Zhuo whose heart is connected to the people and who quietly makes contributions behind the scenes!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>Warden Liang: "I think this time, we should award Director Zhuo with a first class honor!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Actually, I..."</p>

    <p>"It's fine, it's fine, Little Zhuozi, don't be modest! A service is a service; last time, you were also the one who had arranged the arrest, but in the end you were also modest about it. Trying to be modest is good, but you must acknowledge when you have performed a great service!" The old Secretary directly interrupted Zhuo Yi as he looked at the latter with extraordinary geniality. "You really didn't let me down!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>And thus, Zhuo Yi had performed a great service once again.</p>

    <p>The old Secretary's one sentence was worth a thousand words.</p>

    <p>To this, Zhuo Yi also felt helpless.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, whether it was good or bad comments, people followed the trend; furthermore, most of them liked to stick to their first impressions, and judged things based on their own subjective views.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi remembered when Lord Diulei's cultivation forum had been massively popular; numerous cultivation forums had popped up trying to imitate its style, and one of them was called "Zhudi Sky." Back then, two kinds of people had abounded in this forum. One kind were the big boss cultivators who lurked in the forum, while the other kind were keyboard warriors called "shennong cultivators."</p>

    <p>These shennong cultivators mostly just dabbled in cultivation and didn't have much experience. Although they didn't have any cultivation experience, they liked to nitpick anything to do with cultivators.</p>

    <p>If someone's pill furnace blew up, they would come running out to say it was your elixir formula that was wrong!</p>

    <p>If two clans hated each other, they would stand on the side and stir things up without distinguishing black from white!</p>

    <p>Once, there had been a person claiming to be a shennong alchemist verified by Huaxiu nation who had criticized some alchemist's elixir formula. In the end, when that alchemist's elixir had gone on the market, it had been widely acclaimed... that so-called shennong cultivator alchemist had been slapped in the face just like that. The most important point was that this shennong cultivator could still pretend to be indifferent and nonchalant about it, saying that they didn't care while continuing to focus on their Weibo account.</p>

    <p>What was more, Zhuo Yi had noticed that the most laughable thing about these shennong cultivators was that they liked to take general criticism as a personal attack. If one person in the forum was criticized, they felt that they were all being criticized, so they would instantly band together to fight in and outside the forum circle. In the end, the forum post would become tainted with a foul atmosphere.</p>

    <p>This cultivation forum had already declined.</p>

    <p>After this prison break incident, Zhuo Yi deeply felt that his experiences were in fact very similar to this diminished forum. Each time someone brought up a so-called "service" he had supposedly done, he was always clueless about it.</p>

    <p>He had bottled too many things up in his heart, but in the end who could he talk to about them...?</p>

    <p>Actually, Zhuo Yi felt really distressed.</p>
