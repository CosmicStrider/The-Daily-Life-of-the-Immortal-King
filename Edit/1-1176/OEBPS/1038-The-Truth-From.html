  <h1>Chapter 1038 The Truth From Three Years Ago</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Gao Tian had brought some people over to interrogate Lin Shiyao before, but he hadn't expected that she would actually be linked to this case. He glanced meaningfully at his assistant next to him, and the latter rushed off to contact the intelligence department for information on Lin Shiyao.</p>

    <p>Clenching her fists, Lin Shiyao appeared unusually nervous after Zheng Tianqiang asked her the question, and even her breathing became heavier. Under the gazes of the many teachers and nosy students at the scene, she slowly walked forward with Gao Tian's help.</p>

    <p>"Student Lin Shiyao, do you know why I asked you to step forward?" Father Zheng lowered his voice as he did his best to keep it as gentle as possible. Whether it was Xiao Yin, Er Ha or Gao Tian, however, they could sense the tremor in Father Zheng's throat which he couldn't suppress.</p>

    <p>As if he had already waited for a very long time, Father Zheng was now extremely emotional. He was restraining himself and doing his best to hold back his emotions so that they wouldn't burst out.</p>

    <p>The moment a person released their emotions was when they were the weakest. Hence, Father Zheng could only restrain himself.</p>

    <p>Before the truth officially came to light, he didn't want to leave anyone an opening.</p>

    <p>Lin Shiyao was obviously reluctant to answer Father Zheng's question.</p>

    <p>In the last few years, she had buried herself in study to avoid the matter between her and Zheng Jingxuan, and she had always lived in fear and on edge - she hadn't expected the day the matter was uncovered to come so soon.</p>

    <p>"Student Lin, you can refuse to answer this criminal's question!" Principal Zhou Dongye stepped out once more.</p>

    <p>"Principal Zhou, if you interfere one more time, I'll have you arrested for disorderly conduct." Gao Tian glanced at Principal Zhou, whose face darkened before he stepped back.</p>

    <p>Lin Shiyao could be considered a star in Magic Treasure Development University, and for such an outstanding, beautiful student, who was president of the student union, to actually be involved with that "school disgrace" stirred the curiosity of all the teachers and spectating students present.</p>

    <p>After a moment of silence, Lin Shiyao finally seemed to pluck up her courage as she raised her head. "That's right, Zheng Jingxuan was my ex."</p>

    <p>This answer wasn't unexpected to Gao Tian, but the teachers and students present were surprised.</p>

    <p>Father Zheng: "Can you tell everyone, when did you break up?"</p>

    <p>Lin Shiyao: "After the magic treasure design competition, Jingxuan broke up with me."</p>

    <p>"Very good, Student Lin Shiyao, you're very honest. At least until now, you haven't lied to me." Father Zheng nodded. "Then, Student Lin is used to copying beautiful handwriting."</p>

    <p>Lin Shiyao's eyes were already red. "Yes... it's an interest of mine..."</p>

    <p>Father Zheng: "Next, Lin Shiyao, please answer my final question: was it you who wrote Jingxuan's suicide note for him?"</p>

    <p>"What?"</p>

    <p>All the teachers and students at the scene were stunned.</p>

    <p>"Student Lin, you... why didn't you say anything back then..." Principal Zhou Dongye's voice shook.</p>

    <p>Lin Shiyao's heart was already on the verge of collapse, and she cried as she spoke. "After that case of plagiarism during the competition came out, someone lashed out at Jingxuan, and his arms were broken. After that, he came to me and wanted me to help him write a letter of apology. I never thought it would become his suicide note."</p>

    <p>"Very good."</p>

    <p>Father Zheng was very satisfied with her answer.</p>

    <p>He had already investigated this fact earlier on, and getting Lin Shiyao to say it herself corroborated the proof for everyone here. "Student Lin, I will remember your affection for Jingxuan! I thank you!"</p>

    <p>"Zheng Tianqiang, what on earth are you trying to do?" Principal Zhou roared.</p>

    <p>"Relax, Principal Zhou Dongye, the next question is for you. I hope you will also answer truthfully. If you answer any questions incorrectly, I can't guarantee the safety of the hostages."</p>

    <p>"You..."</p>

    <p>The corner of Principal Zhou's mouth twitched. As the principal of a cultivation institution of higher education, no one in school had ever dared to challenge him. Gao Tian gazed at Principal Zhou's clouded expression. Principal Zhou's philosophy in the pursuit of higher learning was "to be impartial and incorruptible"; he was a very cautious person in his daily life. After the disturbance stirred up by the plagiarism of a magic treasure design plan three years ago, Principal Zhou was the first person to step out and apologize to the public on behalf of Zheng Jingxuan.</p>

    <p>It was for this very reason that Principal Zhou wasn't affected by the case after it happened; conversely, he came across as an upright and good principal.</p>

    <p>But since this matter had stirred up quite the fuss today, Gao Tian was well aware that the truth behind this wasn't as simple as it had appeared back then.</p>

    <p>Father Zheng laughed coldly on the broadcast and asked, "Principal Zhou, I ask you, after this incident, did you personally verify the facts?"</p>

    <p>"It's the cultivation police who do the Investigating and verify the evidence; I don't have the qualifications to interfere."</p>

    <p>"Very good, I understand your meaning, Principal Zhou." Father Zheng paused for a second before he continued, "That is to say, Principal Zhou, you didn't watch the complete video of the competition even once?"</p>

    <p>"The police made all the evidence public. Is there any difference if I investigated it or not? It would just be a waste of time..."</p>

    <p>"So Principal Zhou didn't personally look into any of it, and just because of public condemnation, you pressured an outstanding student into publicly apologizing for something he didn't do. May I ask, Principal Zhou, is this something that a principal should do?"</p>

    <p>"You..."</p>

    <p>"Principal Zhou, you don't have to rush to refute my words. I have sufficient evidence to prove Jingxuan's innocence." Saying this, Father Zheng displayed a chart of a company's corporate representatives on the LCD screen in the school's public square.</p>

    <p>It was a chart of the corporate representatives and principal staff of the well-known magic treasure design studio called Raven Studio, and Father Zheng had highlighted a person called Liu Yi.</p>

    <p>"Principal Zhou, do you remember this name?"</p>

    <p>"Liu Yi is my disciple. So? What's wrong with him?"</p>

    <p>"Principal Zhou's disciple is of course capable. Back then, Liu Yi took first prize in the design competition on behalf of Magic Treasure Development College. Principal Zhou took a shine to Student Liu Yi's talent when the latter was a sophomore, and took him in as an inner disciple. Then, Fu Fusheng showed up, and Liu Yi planned to cooperate with him to establish a studio and create their own brand. Thus, during Student Liu's time in university, he recruited people from all over the place and gathered together all kinds of magic treasure design talents. Student Fu Fusheng and my son Zheng Jingxuan both received Student Liu Yi's invitation..."</p>

    <p>Father Zheng slowly recounted, "Student Liu made a big name for himself and established Raven Studio. After recruiting Student Fu, he made him executive director, and then stepped back himself to serve as a corporate representatives and the company's PR. Principal Zhou, don't you think it's strange?"</p>

    <p>"What do you want to say?" Principal Zhou grit his teeth.</p>

    <p>"What I want to say is actually very simple."</p>

    <p>Zheng Tianqiang said coldly, "I want to say that Student Liu Yi actually has no abilities at all. All his magic treasure designs in university, including the design entry for the competition, were nothing more than the works of my son Zheng Jingxuan in senior high... including the work in the plagiarism case three years ago!"</p>
