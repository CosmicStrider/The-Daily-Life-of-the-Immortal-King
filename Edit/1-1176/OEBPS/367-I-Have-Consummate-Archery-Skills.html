  <h1>Chapter 367 I Have Consummate Archery Skills! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Generally, the current study trajectory in Foundation Establishment high schools was the absorption of concepts and theory in the first year, with the addition of some cultivation techniques in the second year, and constant review of theory plus skills in the third year. Overall there wasn't much of a difference compared with old study methods: theory was focused on battle tactics, and techniques involved repeated exercise drills. For most people, it was in Senior Grade Three when the nightmare started.</p>

    <p>Of course, in comparison, Wang Ling felt it was pretty easy; after all, he could put whatever he saw into action, and master it instantly. What was more, he had the two goblins Eraser and Pen to write his homework in his place. The only thing that was a little troublesome was exams; moreover, his scores couldn't be too good...</p>

    <p>However, he felt that whatever university he managed to enter in the end would have nothing to do with whatever exam grades he got. That was because Wang Ling had realized that since entering Number 60 High School, his life had taken a dramatic turn. Whatever university he managed to get into... that was for fate to decide.</p>

    <p>When Teacher Ye saw Wang Ling tick the "battle of soul pets" option, it was as if he instantly understood something... and in a flash, he recalled Er Ha. It could be said that this dog had left a very deep impression on Teacher Ye - especially that green fur; no one who saw it could ever forget it.</p>

    <p>"Student Wang Ling, I remember that your class had a spirit dog at the beginning of the semester? Are you going to have it take part in the sports meet?" Teacher Ye looked at Wang Ling and asked.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded his head.</p>

    <p>Teacher Ye: "Although you can certainly sign up for it, every school is allowed just one soul pet for the battle, and it'll need to pass the selection process next week."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, Teacher Ye. Er Ha definitely won't be a problem," Fang Xing said on the side, his face wreathed in smiles.</p>

    <p>"Then we'll wait until after the selection process next week..." Teacher Ye also nodded.</p>

    <p>Honestly speaking, Teacher Ye didn't have high hopes for Er Ha. Although he had heard that it had been a demon king before, when it had been discovered back then, its soul had already become so weak. Furthermore, Teacher Pan had forcefully fused its soul with a skeleton of an akita. The moment it had been fused with the dog, its life as a demon king had already come to a miserable end.</p>

    <p>What was more, the demon race needed to cultivate with the help of demon qi; without knowing how to cultivate using spirit energy, there was no way for Er Ha's realm to advance in a short timeframe. Thus, Teacher Ye was doubtful about its strength.</p>

    <p>He had no idea what kind of contestant Er Ha now was after having experienced Wang Ling's careful tutelage.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Close to the end of school that afternoon, Teacher Ye once again summoned up his courage to face Teacher Pan to whisk Wang Ling away in the last class period.</p>

    <p>As Wang Ling walked to the classroom door, Teacher Pan stopped him as she called out, "Wang Ling, wait!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling turned his head, his face full of suspicion.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan said sincerely, "Although you are representing the school in competition this time, I still hope that once it's over, you'll refocus on your studies as soon as possible."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "???"</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan: "Do you know why your grades are always down the middle? I believe it's because you've never been truly invested in studying... I won't say anymore, just think about it."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was speechless: "..."</p>

    <p>What was wrong with average grades?</p>

    <p>Wasn't that pretty good?!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When he got to the sports field, Wang Ling found that it was especially noisy today. A crowd had gathered to one side up ahead for some reason, and there was a lot of lively laughter.</p>

    <p>It was coming to the end of the PE lesson for the normal classes, and the PE teachers had simply let the students do their own thing. A bunch of them had gathered around to watch Jiang Bai's archery practice.</p>

    <p>As he drew closer, Wang Ling saw all the guys and girls absorbed in watching Jiang Bai on the shooting range. Teacher Ye was standing up ahead at the front, and he threw a disc up into the air.</p>

    <p>Then, Jiang Bai drew his bow, and the arrow shot through the sky to shatter the disc with a "bang."</p>

    <p>Everyone was astounded. "Wow! Never thought that Jiang Bai had this type of skill... So impressive!"</p>

    <p>On the side, the PE teachers for the other classes also applauded. "Teacher Ye has found a pretty good seedling! It looks like our Number 60 High School has some hope of winning the archery event this year."</p>

    <p>At the scene, Teacher Ye smiled a little embarrassedly, then passed a strip of black cloth to Jiang Bai... It was only now that everyone realized that the real show was about to start.</p>

    <p>Someone yelled in surprise, "Jiang Bai's eyes are covered!"</p>

    <p>He was actually going to shoot blind!</p>

    <p>In the crowd, Wang Ling raised his eyebrows with interest; who would have thought Jiang Bai would have other tricks up his sleeve.</p>

    <p>It went without saying how hard shooting blind was, but it wasn't completely impossible. In fact, regular people could do it with a lot of training, by depending on their ears to determine which direction the object was in and relying on muscle memory. It would be even easier for cultivators since they could use their spiritual senses to locate the target.</p>

    <p>However, it was still difficult for most of these students.</p>

    <p>"Can he do it?"</p>

    <p>A lot of people held their breaths at this scene.</p>

    <p>"Ready!" Teacher Ye took in a breath, then jogged some distance away before suddenly throwing the disc out!</p>

    <p><em>Hu </em>â€” Everyone heard the rushing sound of the spinning disc...</p>

    <p>Jiang Bai pricked up his ears, and in the next moment, he abruptly drew his bow and let loose his arrow!</p>

    <p><em>Bang </em>!</p>

    <p>He hit the target in one strike!</p>

    <p>"Cool! Jiang Bai is really awesome!" a guy couldn't help cheering.</p>

    <p>However, Teacher Li was gradually starting to frown more deeply... For now, Jiang Bai's skills in stationary target archery, moving target archery and moving target blind archery were quite stable, but he still had a weak point, and that was rapid fire archery at a stationary target.</p>

    <p>Teacher Ye had given him special intensive training in this regard a few weeks ago, but there hadn't been any improvement at all.</p>

    <p>"What's going on? Why doesn't Old Ye look happy?" a PE teacher who didn't know the situation whispered the question.</p>

    <p>A female PE teacher next to him answered, "You don't know... This child's situation is a little unique. Although he has a foundation in archery, it's because his father forced him to train with living targets... simply shooting at a target or a moving one is fine, but if there's something tied to the target, then it's difficult..."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

    <p>"Wait and see..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling heard their conversation from afar, and then turned his eyes to the field.</p>

    <p>Teacher Ye tied an apple to the center of the target, then patted Jiang Bai's shoulder and stood next to him as he said, "Relax a little; look at it clearly. What's in front of you is just an apple, not a living thing. You need to have faith in yourself."</p>

    <p>Jiang Bai nodded heavily.</p>

    <p>After that, he raised the bow and arrow in his hand under everyone's eyes, and his aura obviously turned chaotic.</p>

    <p><em>Xiu xiu xiu xiu xiu xiu </em>!</p>

    <p>Six spirit arrows were let loose in succession.</p>

    <p>Teacher Ye buried his forehead deep in his hands, and the other students and teachers were all dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>All the six spirit arrows had made a perfect ring around the apple, with none of them hitting the apple in the middle!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>This was probably the legendary body outline-tracing master <sup>1</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This refers to how a player in a shooting RPG might hit everything around the enemy except the enemy themselves ..)</dfn>
