  <h1>Chapter 1108 National Competition</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Of course, after the possibility of magic was ruled out, only someone with an innate ability could have accomplished such a difficult heist. There were in fact two types of innate ability: the first type developed out of the spirit root. Apart from the five elements, there was actually a small chance that a spirit root might awaken another unusual attribute, which often came with special abilities.</p>

    <p>Like a magnetic force, for example, which could attract metals, or the ability to manipulate the fat on one's own body or on other people. There might also be people born with the innate ability to turn invisible - these were all innate abilities that grew out of special spirit roots.</p>

    <p>It was a small chance, but in a broad survey of the world's population, the number of people whose spirit roots had special abilities in fact wasn't small.</p>

    <p>The truth was that Dark Saint was a cultivator with a special ability â€” his spirit root could give him a camouflage effect, which allowed him to remain completely invisible in the shadows. Thus, Dark Saint could operate in secluded and confined dark spaces, as if no one was there.</p>

    <p>"I recall a person who had a similar ability as Dark Saint - it can even be said that he was harder to deal with," President Qi said again; he clearly wasn't going to fool around at this critical time.</p>

    <p>"Old Qi, you mean..." Battle Saint Marshal Jiang thought of someone.</p>

    <p>"Nightmare," said President Qi. "The Dark Network's number one, whom you personally took down three hundred years ago."</p>

    <p>"He can't be alive!" Marshal Jiang instantly stood up, his expression solemn. "I was the one who killed him three hundred years ago! With one shot from my fingers, I ended his life the instant he revealed his true body. It's impossible for him to still be alive!"</p>

    <p>"Sit down, Old Jiang."</p>

    <p>President Qi said calmly, "Previously, we also received news of Bai Zhe's death, but he has now reappeared; even his son Bai Youquan, who died young, miraculously appeared, and has been apprehended. So, in this world, nothing is impossible. There are numerous forbidden and secret techniques for resurrecting someone. The chances of success are very low, but the possibility still exists."</p>

    <p>"Crap!"</p>

    <p>At that moment, Marshal Jiang's expression flickered. "Based on what you're thinking, Old Qi, could it be that their reason for stealing Xie Sanxiao's skull..."</p>

    <p>"If that really is the case, we will have to plan for the worst."</p>

    <p>President Qi sighed.</p>

    <p>Dark Ancestor Xie Sanxiao had been near invincible.</p>

    <p>It was also precisely because of this that he thought himself infallible and able to absorb the Earth's underground spirit veins.</p>

    <p>However, the truth was that he had overestimated his ability, and became the strongest man to die because of his pride... No one had killed him, and no one could.</p>

    <p>That was then.</p>

    <p>And this was now...</p>

    <p>If the other party really had stolen Xie Sanxiao's skull to resurrect him...</p>

    <p>Then, the cultivation world would soon be flooded with blood.</p>

    <p>When it came to Xie Sanxiao's cause of death, it was acknowledged worldwide that he had died at the hands of the hero Zuo Butong.</p>

    <p>If this extremely proud Xie Sanxiao learned of this situation after his resurrection, he would very likely start slaughtering people immediately, given his personality.</p>

    <p>"We will soon be facing a fierce battle." Sitting around the meeting table, every single one of the Ten Generals narrowed their eyes in thought, a mix of complicated feelings in their hearts.</p>

    <p>Most important of all was that they still didn't know what was the goal of the person behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was still a fine, sunny day that morning, and the world was at peace.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan used the class group chat to hold an ad hoc class meeting.</p>

    <p>She was going to talk specifically about the changes to the body technique exchange meet.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan is Actually A Beauty: "Students, we've just received a notice from the city office of the Administration of 100 Schools that the body technique exchange meet this time has been upgraded from a district competition to a national one. I hope everyone can work hard during this period! Students participating in the competition, do your best! But those not taking part also need to cheer them on! @everyone"</p>

    <p>Sports Committee Member - Chen Chao: "Why is it a national competition now??? Isn't this too big a leap???"</p>

    <p>Ideology and Politics - Guo Hao: "Holy crap... National competition! How many schools will be participating? Will our school be able to place in the ranking..."</p>

    <p>"Since there are a lot of cultivation schools holding similar exchange activities at the same time, the Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools decided to turn it into a large-scale activity."</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan is Actually A Beauty: "You don't have to be so pessimistic; our school's overall combat strength is pretty good. Since the competition has been expanded, it'll be postponed to three days later than the original date, and will officially happen on November 14th, next Friday. Report on Thursday night to the designated venue: Nine Dragon Mountain. Students taking part in the competition will have to take an immortal boat over. The competition will last eight days."</p>

    <p>Nine Dragon Mountain?</p>

    <p>This place sounded a little familiar to a lot of people.</p>

    <p>Ideology and Politics - Guo Hao: "I remember this Nine Dragon Mountain. Didn't a major figure die there?"</p>

    <p>"It was Dark Ancestor Xie Sanxiao."</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan is Actually A Beauty: "[Grin] Student Guo knows a lot! Back then, this legendary number one figure of the Dark Network, Xie Sanxiao, perished on Nine Dragon Mountain. He was personally shot down by our country's hero, Zuo Butong, and his team. Nine Dragon Mountain thus has unique meaning! The reason why the body technique exchange meet will be held there is to commemorate the heroes who fought for their values and beliefs. I hope everyone will learn from them."</p>

    <p>Monitor - Sun Rong: "Teacher Pan, apart from the change in scale, are there any other changes in the national competition?"</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan is Actually A Beauty: "In the district competition, five people would have fought as the main force, and the other five were substitutes. Now that the competition has expanded, it has become a ten-person battle, and all ten members will fight as the main force!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>On the other side of the screen, Wang Ling was shocked when he saw this message.</p>

    <p>All ten members as the main force...</p>

    <p>Even if he didn't make a move, with Liu Qingyi, Wang Zhen, and Gu Shunzhi that bunch around, the other schools stood no damn chance at all!</p>

    <p>"I also know that time is tight, but every school is preparing for it. There will be one hundred and two cultivation schools from all over the nation headed for Nine Dragon Mountain. Each school will dispatch a ten-person team, and they will engage in a large-scale battle on Nine Dragon Mountain. The team which obtains the highest number of points will be the winner."</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan said in the group, "I know that time is tight for all of you, so Headmaster Chen will arrange extra physical training classes next week as well as brief you on the spirit plants that grow on Nine Dragon Mountain. There is an abundance of spirit plants on Nine Dragon Mountain. Given that the large-scale battle will last eight days, you must have some knowledge on how to look for food in the wild. It won't be good if you eat a spirit plant or fruit that you shouldn't by mistake."</p>

    <p>"It looks like we'll be very busy..." Guo Hao sighed.</p>

    <p>In the next moment, Teacher Pan said in the group, "Students taking part in the competition don't need to do homework for now."</p>

    <p>Everybody: "!!!"</p>
