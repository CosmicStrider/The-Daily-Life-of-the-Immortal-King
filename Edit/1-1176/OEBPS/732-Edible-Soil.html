  <h1>Chapter 732 Edible Soil</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The blast shook earth and heaven.</p>

    <p>Billows of thick smoke filled the entire Tight Net barrier and took a long time to disperse, making it hard to clearly see what was happening inside.</p>

    <p>The only thing that was certain was that the blast just now had directly leveled the ground, and all the trees within a hundred-li radius had been blown to smithereens without leaving even a single bit of debris left.</p>

    <p>This was a blast at True Immortal level...</p>

    <p>This was the power of General Bai's attack.</p>

    <p>At the same time, this scene made the Old Devil sweat a little.</p>

    <p>The truth was, the whole of Huaxiu nation being enveloped in Devil Emperor Gua Pi's black terror back then was just an exaggerated legend... Although his personal invasion of Huaxiu's National Palace in his search for the Wheel of Time had indeed become a hot topic for quite a long time, it definitely wasn't as terrible as the rumors had boasted.</p>

    <p>After all, in those days, in order to deal with Blademaster General Yi Jianchuan, he had also suffered a lot.</p>

    <p>During that period when the Old Devil had been wreaking havoc, this General Bai had been in seclusion. Otherwise, the Old Devil felt that even at his peak, he would have been hard-pressed to deal with the other party's explosive power.</p>

    <p>Among the Ten Generals, General Bai was ranked first in battle strength and General Yi was ranked third.</p>

    <p>It had already been very difficult for the Old Devil to deal with the third-ranked; it was really hard to say what the outcome would have been if he had fought the first-ranked general back then.</p>

    <p>Recalling the past, the Old Devil couldn't help sweating in his heart.</p>

    <p>Speaking logically, he still felt that the pressure from this General Bai wasn't as heavy as the pressure from that teenager... Even though that youngster hadn't performed any sort of heaven-defying move in front of the Old Devil back then, he had certainly played a crucial role in the Old Devil's eventual arrest.</p>

    <p>In his overall plan back then, he had had two critical arrays: one was the Body-Turning Array, which could absorb vitality, and the other was the magic array for summoning the Gate Between Worlds.</p>

    <p>But because of that boy, his plan had completely fallen through.</p>

    <p>Until now, the Old Devil could never forget the image of that boy single-handedly closing the Gate Between Worlds...</p>

    <p>To this day, the Old Devil still couldn't help shivering when he thought about it.</p>

    <p>Looking at the profound expression on the Old Devil's face as he drew the talismans, Cheng Yu immediately knew that the Old Devil was probably thinking of something upsetting...</p>

    <p>A moment later, the Old Devil looked up at Cheng Yu and said, "Brother Cheng, I want to know, how many times were you slapped when you were arrested?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Cheng Yu's face instantly darkened. "How many times were <em>you </em>slapped?"</p>

    <p>The Old Devil recalled carefully. "For me, just once..."</p>

    <p>After saying that, he looked up at the extremely excited Evil Sword God in the sky. "I heard that our friend up there was slapped three times before he was put in jail."</p>

    <p>Cheng Yu's face became even darker when he heard this. "..."</p>

    <p>He hadn't even been slapped at all!</p>

    <p>Because back then, it had been Jingke all along who had dealt with him!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The activity that night in the real remains was a picnic. The lead teachers gave each student an abridged edition of a handbook on spirit plants. The handbook covered all the poisonous and dangerous plants that the students might come into contact with at this summer camp.</p>

    <p>After pitching their tents, each person was assigned a task for the picnic, and everyone would need to use resources from the forest for their cooking.</p>

    <p>Basically, they were supposed to make vegetable soup...</p>

    <p>In Beast King's Remains, there were extinct resources as well as cultivated spirit plants. The reason why this stretch of forest had been chosen was because many of the spirit plants here had originally been brought in from the outside world by expedition teams.</p>

    <p>The spirit soil in this forest was very fertile and contained many trace elements that couldn't be found in the outside world. The research institute had been analyzing the specific composition of the soil for years, but had yet to make any sort of breakthrough. It was precisely because of these trace elements that many types of spirit plants which couldn't grow in the outside world could effectively reproduce and grow here.</p>

    <p>Thus, the resources which the students would be consuming for the picnic this time were also within Huaxiu Alliance's scope of consideration. Enough seeds had been sown here previously, and harvesting some of the spirit plants would actually be beneficial for their future growth.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao, Su Xiao, Wang Ling and Guo Hao were in the same team.</p>

    <p>The four of them set out and came to the edge of a creek. Chen Chao stood with arms akimbo on a rock and took a deep breath. "Do you know, I feel that the soil here is very different... I feel very relaxed and it feels especially refreshing."</p>

    <p>Su Xiao nodded. "Mm, it certainly is a very special smell! It's quite refreshing!"</p>

    <p>"The soil here isn't ordinary. Do you know, this soil is actually edible," Guo Hao said.</p>

    <p>"Edible?"</p>

    <p>"That's right." Guo Hao: "I asked a teacher from the research institute just now, who said that this soil is rich in nutrients and free of bacteria, fully edible. Of course... although it's edible, I heard that it's unpalatable, like chewing salt, and it'll make you very thirsty."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Su Xiao picked up a handful of dirt and took a sniff.</p>

    <p>The spirit soil had an indescribable aroma... If Guo Hao hadn't said anything, it really would have made a person want to eat it!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>While the picnic activity was happening on this side, several streams of light fell from the sky on the other side and landed at the entrance to the forest in the remains.</p>

    <p>The special ops team which Zhuo Yi had established arrived with Wuji in the lead as the party landed right here.</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang was utterly excited. "My god, so these are the real remains..."</p>

    <p>It was normal for him to be excited. For many years, cultivators all over the country had voted Devil Valley Beast King's Remains as the place they most wanted to visit to broaden their horizons. But since the entrance only opened inside Huaxiu nation, and the vast majority of resources inside the secret land was strictly regulated by the state, plus a variety of extinct resources grew inside it... If you wanted to come here to visit, it was really hard.</p>

    <p>The only way was to pass the scholarly exam set by Huaxiu's Scientific Institute of Cultivation and Magic Treasures. As long as you could become an institute fellow, you would have the opportunity to follow a team in to study the secret land when the remains opened.</p>

    <p>"This group of children really struck the lottery." At the entrance to the forest, Zhuo Yi couldn't help smiling.</p>

    <p>This summer camp was really a rare opportunity, especially for this lucky group of high school students. Going for a summer camp in Beast King's Remains was something they could brag about for a year alone!</p>

    <p>"Let's go in."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi spoke at the entrance.</p>

    <p>He could already sniff out <em>shifu </em>!</p>

    <p><em>Shifu </em>was in there!</p>

    <p>But before he met <em>shifu </em>, Zhuo Yi thought it would still be better for him to first look for that Wu Zhenjun who was leading the whole group to explain their situation.</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang was very excited. He had barely stepped onto the ground in the forest when Xiao Yin immediately cried out, " <em>Aya </em>! Slow down! Don't step on it!"</p>

    <p>"???"</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang was startled. "Is the soil here also an extinct resource?"</p>

    <p>"No..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin quickly shook his head and then pinched his nose. "This is Devil King's shit."</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang, Zhuo Yi and Wuji: "..."</p>
