  <h1>Chapter 1110 Analyzing the Strengths of Cultivation Schools</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Number 1 Devil-Subduing High School.</p>

    <p>As they flipped through the handouts which had been prepared beforehand, everyone looked at Headmaster Chen as he explained the history of Number 1 Devil-Subduing High School.</p>

    <p>Number 1 Devil-Subduing High School was founded after Number 60 High and was only six hundred years old. This was a cultivation school set up through investments from the orthodox light force Devil-Subduing Sect. Over the past six hundred years, the school groomed talented people to eliminate devils and uphold justice for the nation as well as to join the Immortal Arts Mobile Squadron, and it made significant contributions. Additionally, the sect leader of Devil-Subduing Sect, who was the current headmaster of Number 1 Devil-Subduing High School, Li Qingxi, was someone who was already well-known outside, and was nicknamed Devil-Subduing Daoist.</p>

    <p>The defining feature of Number 1 Devil-Subduing High's curriculum was "the study of control"; naturally, the students were well-versed in the spells and essence of various types of control magic. Number 1 Devil-Subduing High School was thus extremely dangerous, which made it the number one school on Headmaster Chen's list of schools that had to be heavily guarded against.</p>

    <p>Dealing with control-type spells was very tricky; not only did they restrict the use of magic, they could even restrict physical movements. Sealing the spirit, freezing or weakening someone, puppetry - there were all sorts of control-type spells, and once you were unable to respond properly, the other party would benefit from it.</p>

    <p>Although the main way to obtain points this time was to physically hit the opponent with a body technique, the use of magic wasn't restricted in the battle royale.</p>

    <p>Except for spells which made use of the five elements and could cause widespread environmental damage, all other spells were fine.</p>

    <p>What Headmaster Chen was most worried about was the puppet magic which Number 1 Devil-Subduing High used, which forced students from other schools to become part of their troops and act as bodyguards to protect them.</p>

    <p>This way, they didn't have to worry about protection at all, and could just leisurely focus on accomplishing their tasks and obtaining as many points as possible.</p>

    <p>There were all kinds of puppet magic; Number 1 Devil-Subduing High only had to play it a little sneaky, and the entire battlefield would become its home turf.</p>

    <p>"One of the trickiest types of puppet magic is the Virus Puppet spell."</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen had already forecasted the control spells that Number 1 Devil-Subduing High School might use during the large-scale battle.</p>

    <p>"Virus Puppet spell?"</p>

    <p>"It's not a real virus, but a more traditional type of chain control spell. When cast, the user controls one person first, and then any human or creature who comes into contact with this person will become the user's puppets. This spell creates a hierarchical system â€” you'll listen to whoever touches you. It's a bit like brainwashing."</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen said, "The worst thing that could happen is if some students can't help but want to rescue their teammates, but like the calabash brothers trying to save their grandpa<sup>1</sup>, this will lead to the entire team being controlled."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(In the Chinese cartoon "Calabash Brothers", the boys one by one try to rescue their grandpa, only to fail and all be caught.)</dfn>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen: "My guess is that there's a very high chance that the students from Number 1 Devil-Subduing High School will use this spell."</p>

    <p>To be frank, what Headmaster Chen was doing was a little like predicting the questions that would come out in an exam. It wasn't necessarily accurate, but given the current situation, they could only trust in the headmaster. People like headmasters weren't weak. Wang Ling had never seen Headmaster Chen exhibit his combat strength, but it would certainly be hard for the latter to perform his duty as headmaster of Number 60 High, which was over a thousand years old, if he didn't have a certain amount of strength.</p>

    <p>Old Man Li, the guard at the school gate, was someone who had retired from the Seven Stars Special Forces, and who even had the strength of a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen definitely wouldn't be weaker than Old Man Li.</p>

    <p>As for his actual realm, half of the people present could only guess at it, while Wang Ling, Gu Shunzhi and the rest had long been aware of it.</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen indeed wasn't weak, as he was an Itinerant Immortal.</p>

    <p>But compared with Gu Shunzhi and the others... he wasn't anything much.</p>

    <p>But even though he was just an Itinerant Immortal, Wang Ling had no intention of looking down on him at all.</p>

    <p>He was only sixteen years old; in terms of life experience, Headmaster Chen had seen far more than he had.</p>

    <p>And when it came to picking out test questions, Headmaster Chen had helped out before with district and even national test papers. After being headmaster for so many years, he was too familiar with how other high schools thought.</p>

    <p>Schools had their circle, and the headmasters of these schools naturally had one as well.</p>

    <p>Thus, the battle royale this time wasn't just a contest between students, but also an intense battle of wits between the headmasters; more than just formulating strategies for their students, they also had to try and discern the thoughts of the other headmasters and figure out what tactics they might use.</p>

    <p>But there were a total of 101 competing schools; it was clearly unrealistic to try and analyze all of them, so Headmaster Chen could only pick out the main points to discuss.</p>

    <p>The rest would depend on the fortune of the Number 60 High delegation.</p>

    <p>There were times when luck was also a strength.</p>

    <p>"Apart from guarding against Number 1 Devil-Subduing High, you also need to be alert to the possibility of some teams forming a temporary alliance during the early and middle stages of the eight-day survival operation. Of these, I'm worried about Number 1 Devil-Subduing High and Titan High School joining forces," said Headmaster Chen.</p>

    <p>"Titan High School?" Some people were puzzled.</p>

    <p>"I know it." Chen Chao raised his hand. "Titan was actually my first choice for high school... Unfortunately, my score wasn't high enough, and I couldn't get in."</p>

    <p>"What kind of school is it? Don't tell me..." Guo Hao thought of a possibility.</p>

    <p>"That's right, it's just like its name - boy or girl, they're all tanks!"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>"Titan High School uses a tonnage system. Everyone who enters the school cultivates the same technique, Titan Art, which is said to be able to continually increase a person's body density. The students look like they have normal builds, when in fact some weigh close to over a thousand or even ten thousand jin," said Chen Chao. "Based on the Titan Art's grade classification, those who weigh over one thousand jin are trucks, over two thousand are tanks, over five thousand are warships, and over ten thousand are aircraft carriers."</p>

    <p>"Ten thousand jin... are they all Qiao Biluo<sup>2</sup>..." Guo Hao was stupefied.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Referring to the pretty live streamer whose beauty filter glitched to reveal that she was a plump middle-aged woman.)</dfn>

    <p>"What Student Chen Chao says is correct."</p>

    <p>At that moment, Headmaster Chen expressed his concerns. "Students from Titan High School are all heavyweights. Since the students taking part in the battle are from Grade One, they should be trucks; of course, some might be tanks. They use their arts to compress their body weight and dramatically increase their body density so that their bodies are almost impregnable. At the same time, they are extremely lethal and destructive. Fighting them head on will be like throwing straw to the wind. It would be terrible if they join forces with Number 1 Devil-Subduing High School and become Meatball Tanks to eliminate the other schools."</p>

    <p>"Meatball Tanks..."</p>

    <p>"This is also another puppet technique, which is operated with a special type of puppet string and turns the human body into an extremely destructive rolling ball. Of all the high schools in this competition, there is no high school more suitable than Titan High School for this technique."</p>
