  <h1>Chapter 845 Tragic Yang Huai and His Patients</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was August 13th on Sunday in the fifteenth week of the semester.</p>

    <p>It was the third day of Number 60 High's first semester final exams.</p>

    <p>It was also the last day of the first semester of Wang Ling's high school life.</p>

    <p>That morning, everyone came to school early, and as Wang Ling expected, the topic of discussion revolved around Yang Huai, the infamous therapist who finally got the punishment he deserved.</p>

    <p>"One of my uncles said this Yang Huai is truly tragic." Guo Hao tsked. "I heard that there weren't any vacant cells in prison, so for the time being, he's been placed inside the special prison cell. Can you guess who's in there? The Old Devil! The Master of Immortal Mansion! And that Evil Sword God!"</p>

    <p>When he said that, the people surrounding him couldn't help but tremble - they could basically already imagine how wretched Yang Huai was.</p>

    <p>Not just anyone was put into Songhai First Prison's special prison cell. Because of their senior Zhuo Yi's efforts, all those in the special cell could be called vile creatures.</p>

    <p>Yang Huai's wicked heart might qualify him for the special prison cell, but in terms of realm strength, anyone in there could beat the crap out of him.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao clearly remembered when a well-known reporter had interviewed Yang Huai about the treatment center before, and how the latter had given the camera a smile so creepy that one couldn't help shuddering at it.</p>

    <p>But now, it was likely he would never smile like that again.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The work Immortal Toya had taken on was already in full swing on Chrysanthemum Island. So far, four patients whose lives were still hanging in the balance had been transferred to the island for further treatment. Yang Huai had injured them so heavily that their cranial nerves were severely damaged - that was to say, even if their vital signs stabilized, there was a very high chance that they would become human vegetables for the rest of their lives and never wake up.</p>

    <p>But it just so happened that Immortal Toya had recently gained a wealth of experience when it came to treating mental conditions.</p>

    <p>To treat Miss Liu Qingyi's deep coma back then, Immortal Toya had even used his ancestral magic treasure, the Nine Cycles Exquisite Pagoda. It was a quasi world-defying magic treasure as well as a very powerful seal-type magic artifact, but it had been damaged in a major battle and had yet to be restored.</p>

    <p>Now, it had just become a mobile depository of texts, which housed a lifetime's worth of the Toya clan's research on medical techniques.</p>

    <p>As he was thinking of prescriptions with his head lowered, Jinshi and Yinshi came up to him. Jinshi gave a half-bow and said, " <em>Shifu </em>, the patients have already been settled."</p>

    <p>"So fast?" Immortal Toya was blank.</p>

    <p>He remembered that two of the four were of a heavy build; their families sent them to Yang Huai's treatment center because they shut themselves away at home and refused to go out.</p>

    <p>And the most frightening thing was that they were all Bilibili uploaders.</p>

    <p>The first uploader: LexBurner.</p>

    <p>This was a heavyweight uploader who was very popular with fans before he was caught and sent to the treatment center. In the last few months, he disappeared off the face of the earth; if Yang Huai's treatment center hadn't been exposed, it was likely that the fans would never have known that their favorite uploader had actually been sent to such a horrible treatment center.</p>

    <p>At the same time, LexBurner had been "generating electricity with love" <sup>1</sup> for the longest time, leading to an electrolyte imbalance inside his body and causing him to become obese. Before he entered the treatment center, he had weighed 260 jin - in the end, his electrolytes became even more unbalanced after Yang Huai's electric shock treatment, and he now weighed 380 jin.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A slogan initially used in
anti-nuclear energy protests
in Taiwan which now refers to
doing something purely out of
love.)</dfn>

    <p>The second uploader: Lord Milk Bottle.</p>

    <p>This was an uploader who was caught and sent to Yang Huai's treatment center through crowdfunding by fans because of the "poisonous milk" he spouted in e-game competitions. He relied on milk powder for nutrition, and after he entered the treatment center, he became malnourished after a long time without milk. From weighing 560 jin at the very beginning, he was now down to a light 60 jin.</p>

    <p>Jinshi and Yin had thus been especially cautious when moving Lord Milk Bottle just now, for fear that he would break if they weren't careful. After all, milk bottles broke easily!</p>

    <p>The third uploader: Pipixuan.</p>

    <p>This was also a Bilibili uploader who had been sent to the treatment center through crowdfunding by fans. Pipixuan was initially an author, but started to neglect his work, thus rousing public anger. All he did every day was remix songs, leading to anti-fans crowdfunding to send him to Yang Huai's treatment center. But completely unlike the previous two, this 780-jin uploader unexpectedly became more and more handsome and unreal under Yang Huai's electric shock treatment.... After being rescued from the treatment center, he was violently beaten up by some anti-fans jealous of his talent, and so was sent to ICU...</p>

    <p>Thus, of the four uploaders who had been sent over, only Pipixuan had ended up in ICU not because of Yang Huai, but because of his anti-fans...</p>

    <p>The fourth uploader: Kidney Overtaxed Bacteria <sup>2</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(A reference to a Bilibili
uploader well-known for
playing horror games and
screaming in his live stream ..)</dfn>

    <p>This uploader's neighbors paid to have him sent to the treatment center. As a professional horror game live streamer, and also the most cowardly of the four, he often screamed involuntarily whenever he live streamed a horror game, and his ultrasonic cries badly affected his neighbors' sleep. And so, Kidney Overtaxed Bacteria, this long-term shut-in, was sent to Yang Huai's treatment center. In the end, Yang Huai himself couldn't take his screaming, and used electric shocks to paralyze this uploader's vocal cords.</p>

    <p>Kidney Overtaxed Bacteria was unable to recover from losing his voice for the longest time, and just like that, slipped into a coma. The ultrasonic waves he was no longer able to disperse unexpectedly stimulated the adrenaline in his body, causing his original physique to change. Current weight: 429 jin.</p>

    <p>"It was Miss Liu who helped us carry the three heaviest patients: one in each hand, and even one on her head... She's so awesome!" said Yinshi.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya was startled. "How could you let Miss Liu help you?"</p>

    <p>He started to worry about the safety of the four patients.</p>

    <p>What a rough means of transport...</p>

    <p>This wasn't an express delivery!</p>

    <p>Miss Liu: "Don't worry, I was careful. Jinshi and Yinshi have been very busy these last two days, and I've been staying here for so long; it's only right that I help out with some simple physical labor. Brother To, you don't have to be polite with me; feel free to tell me what to do!"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya broke out in a sweat.</p>

    <p>There was no way he would dare order around someone from the Domain of the Gods!</p>

    <p>"Oh, by the way, Brother To, Wang Zhen and I discussed the previous matter, and we've decided not to have a fight at Number 60 High - we're already adults, we should be a little more civilized," said Liu Qingyi.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya's eyes lit up and he nodded. "That's great! As expected of Miss Liu, that's very sensible!"</p>

    <p>"Right? I feel the same!"</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi chuckled. "So after I discussed it with Wang Zhen, we've decided to fight with words instead!"</p>

    <p>"Fight with words?"</p>

    <p>"That's right! With words!"</p>

    <p>"How... do you fight with words?"</p>

    <p>"We've decided to become transfer students at Number 60 High and see who gets better grades!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
