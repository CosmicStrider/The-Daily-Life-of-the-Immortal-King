  <h1>Chapter 387 Wang Ling's Remote Assistance </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was thus at this point that Er Ha had to acknowledge a tragic fact â€” there really were some cultivators in this world that practiced body movement as their main method of cultivation, when for most of them, it was just a minor option.</p>

    <p>"After all that, you only know how to dodge attacks!"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi explained, "Pet trainers rely on soul pets to fight; as an owner, the most important thing is to direct the fight and protect yourself at the same time, so since I was young, my family taught me to put my safety first above all else; as long as I can dodge well, there is no 'boss' that can hit me!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha was stunned. "..." This sounded a bit like nonsense, but if you thought about it carefully, it actually made some sense!</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Then did you bring your soul pets?"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "No."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>As he continued to using his dodging skills, Wei Zhi grinned with bold conviction. "Don't I have you?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>This fucking scammer!</p>

    <p>In this way, Er Ha suddenly found that the burden of this fight had been thrust upon it.</p>

    <p>Although the wooden house was large enough, Wei Zhi using body movements to continually avoid attacks wasn't a long-term solution; all his physical strength and spirit energy would ultimately be spent.</p>

    <p>"Set up the array!"</p>

    <p>Strong Zuo shouted lightly before he retreated behind the group of people. Runes blossomed in his hands, and he rolled together a large amount of spirit power which made the whole house shake, creating cracks in the wooden walls.</p>

    <p>The suppression array set up by twelve Golden Core cultivators working together would naturally have an extraordinary effect. Spirit potential roared and the piercing sound waves produced by the intense vibrations in the air numbed the heart; it felt like a big cat dragging its nails down a blackboard, which tormented anyone who heard it.</p>

    <p>"You can't escape the combined suppression of twelve Golden Core cultivators. Since our levels are the same, there is no way for you to escape!" Strong Zuo shouted sternly with his hands pressed together as the man and the dog in front of him were rendered completely immobile and trapped inside the magic array.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi had broken out in a cold sweat; his body movements were completely useless in the face of such a powerful suppression array.</p>

    <p>Er Ha narrowed its eyes.</p>

    <p>Looking at the current situation, they lacked a numbers advantage and they just didn't have the same level of battle strength - there was only one last option...</p>

    <p>In the soul pet contract agreement, there was an extra option at the end to allow owners to cast assistance-type spells on combat pets through the power of the contract; as long as this power existed, distance wasn't an issue, and pets could get remote assistance!</p>

    <p>Er Ha had thought of this trump card in the beginning, but it hadn't wanted to use it; it had its pride as a demon king.</p>

    <p>It had initially thought that Wei Zhi would be strong enough, and by working in concert with this strength, they would be able to completely wipe out this gang of Golden Core cultivators... But reality had proven that it had been thinking too much!</p>

    <p>At that very moment, everyone thought the outcome was a foregone conclusion.</p>

    <p>Strong Zuo looked at Er Ha with a sneer. "Your fur is strange, but you're very meaty; when you're made into a steamed bun later, you might taste pretty good!"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi appeared to have been completely suppressed inside the array, but in fact he wasn't. The number one priority as a professional pet trainer was to protect yourself, so it wasn't like he didn't have a way to escape.</p>

    <p>However, he was dying to know exactly how unusual Er Ha was.</p>

    <p>Then, to everyone's surprise, Er Ha suddenly raised its dog head with a mocking expression on its face. "You really think I can't beat you?"</p>

    <p>The twelve Golden Core cultivators exchanged blank looks.</p>

    <p>It was just a mongrel spirit dog with green fur that was spouting human words and mouthing off at everyone - it was quite comical just thinking about this scene.</p>

    <p>Standing at the back, Strong Zuo stared at Er Ha for a few seconds, and then couldn't help laughing. "You're nothing more than a spirit dog that hasn't reached second class. What makes you qualified to challenge us? A pet is meant to be enslaved."</p>

    <p>Er Ha also laughed. "You want to enslave this king? I'm afraid you're not qualified. If you think you're capable, give me thirty seconds, and I'll beat the crap out of you!"</p>

    <p>"What did you say?!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha narrowed its eyes. "I said, give me thirty seconds! I this person... no, this dog! Will beat the crap out of you!"</p>

    <p>Such a stunning statement made everyone in the wooden house suddenly go quiet for a long moment; even the air seemed to freeze.</p>

    <p>Only Wei Zhi had a pleasantly surprised expression on his face... Thirty seconds? What on earth could Er Ha do?</p>

    <p>Strong Zuo snorted coldly. "Fine! I'll give you thirty seconds; let's see what you can do!"</p>

    <p>This reply pleased Er Ha, because it took time to communicate with Wang Ling through the contract. Furthermore, there absolutely couldn't be any external interference while it was happening... the most important thing was that thirty seconds was more than enough time!</p>

    <p>Er Ha was very certain that the people of the Demon Hunters Association viewed spirit beasts as commodities and like dirt, so it had tried to buy time with an arrogant attitude - who would have thought that things had truly gone according to plan!</p>

    <p>Thirty seconds!</p>

    <p>Once thirty seconds had passed!</p>

    <p>This bunch of people were dead!</p>

    <p>At this point, the entire scene had fallen into silence.</p>

    <p>Everyone was waiting to see what would happen after thirty seconds.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Just as the second hand passed the thirty-second mark...</p>

    <p>The sky started to rumble.</p>

    <p>As if the might of the heavens was pouring down, a godly beam of light suddenly penetrated the ceiling of the wooden house directly to fall on Er Ha.</p>

    <p>What was that?</p>

    <p>In the wooden house, the twelve Golden Core cultivators led by Strong Zuo were all greatly astonished, and doubts subconsciously started to surface in their minds.</p>

    <p>At this time, boundless talisman light swirled around Er Ha; even its feet glowed with brilliant radiance - as this spirit light increased, the strength of Er Ha's aura rose sharply!</p>

    <p>It didn't take a single step, merely wagged its tail, and invisible spirit power was released.</p>

    <p>Then, everyone heard a crash.</p>

    <p>Strong Zuo turned pale with fright; the sound wasn't coming from anywhere else but the array that the twelve Golden Core cultivators had joined hands to set up earlier... It had actually been shattered by an attack from this invisible spirit power!</p>

    <p>"Uncle Zuo? What is this?"</p>

    <p>"Auxiliary spells! This dog used the power of the contract to allow its owner to cast auxiliary spells on itself!"</p>

    <p>"How many spells are there in total?"</p>

    <p>Strong Zuo narrowed his eyes and stared cautiously at Er Ha. "Judging from this type of light, there are probably no less than forty spells..."</p>

    <p>"No less than forty?" The other men turned pale.</p>

    <p>"Don't panic, they're just augmentation spells, and can only last for a short time! We just need to get through this duration!" Strong Zuo said.</p>

    <p>Get through this duration?</p>

    <p>Er Ha couldn't help laughing when it heard this.</p>

    <p>How long an augmentation spell lasted depended on the level of the spell. A low-grade augmentation spell would naturally last for a very short time... But the main point was that these spells had all been personally cast by Little Master Ling!</p>

    <p>There were fully forty-nine augmentation spells in total!</p>

    <p>And each one of them was a full-grade spell!</p>

    <p>Er Ha hmphed in its heart.</p>

    <p><em>Hmph!</em></p>

    <p><em>You're done for!</em></p>

    <p><em>The current me!</em></p>

    <p><em>Is super terrifying!</em></p>
