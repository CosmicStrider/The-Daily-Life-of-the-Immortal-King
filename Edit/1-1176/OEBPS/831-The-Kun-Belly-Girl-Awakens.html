  <h1>Chapter 831 The Kun Belly Girl Awakens</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Zhen had always been very conceited growing up. The Wang family was an illustrious one on Nine-fold Star. For years, it was always in the top three of aristocratic families on Nine-fold Star, and basically occupied second place. Even if there were times when it fell to third place, it would quickly return to second place. The aristocratic family in first place was the Gu family, whose eldest young master had always been Wang Zhen's sworn enemy.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen challenged the Gu family's eldest young master countless times, but was defeated in each and every instance.</p>

    <p>The Liu family ranked lower than the Wang family, but was still seventh on the list. The reason why the Wang family had chosen to join hands with the Liu family through marriage this time was in fact to challenge the Gu family's dominant and ever expanding status on Nine-fold Star.</p>

    <p>Actually, it wasn't like Wang Zhen couldn't understand the older generation's behavior. After all, the Wang family also once ruled Nine-fold Star as the top dog for a long period of time. It was just that they fell into low straits for a time, and it was during this period that the Gu family abruptly rose to power.</p>

    <p>The Wang family elders were dissatisfied with how shaky the Wang family's position had been for so long as well as with the criticism from outside. It was natural that they had to find a way to reconsolidate their position.</p>

    <p>As the eldest son of the Wang family's younger generation, Wang Zhen naturally had to shoulder important responsibilities.</p>

    <p>And that was to form an alliance through marriage...</p>

    <p>This was the quickest way the Wang family elders could currently think of to increase their strength.</p>

    <p>Besides, Miss Liu Qingyi of the Liu family was quite beautiful, dignified and graceful. According to what the Wang family elders told Wang Zhen in the beginning, the most outstanding part of Miss Liu Qingyi was that her two legs were like white frozen treats, and anyone who saw them couldn't help wanting to give them a lick...</p>

    <p>"Still thinking about that Miss Liu?" In the living room, Wei Zhi saw Wang Zhen's listless and distressed face.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen gazed without expression at the LCD TV, which was playing a live broadcast of this year's S888 League of Legends season final. Wang Zhen thought it was very dull. Huaxiu's IG team this year was too strong, routing everyone and thrashing them.</p>

    <p>It had still been the first game when Wang Zhen started watching, but even without doing the math, he knew it was going to end in 3:0.</p>

    <p>Ay...</p>

    <p>Dull!</p>

    <p>Just like a marriage alliance!</p>

    <p>Dull!</p>

    <p>After living together for two days, Wei Zhi probably knew more about Wang Zhen than anyone else.</p>

    <p>When Wang Zhen had been sent over at first, Immortal Toya had already shared everything he knew with Wei Zhi.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi was now one of their own people. Wang Zhen was now on Earth and didn't have a place to stay, so since Immortal Toya needed Wei Zhi's help, he naturally had to let Wei Zhi know who he was helping and why.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi was a good man, but he wasn't a "yes" man.</p>

    <p>Actually, Wei Zhi sympathized with Wang Zhen's plight. It was already the year 8102 <sup>1</sup> , yet arranged marriages still existed.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A Chinese meme referring to something outdated..)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Zhen had to marry a girl he didn't like, and according to the rules of a marriage alliance, they had to have a kid together.</p>

    <p>Previously, Wang Zhen had described it to Wei Zhi like it was simply a disaster.</p>

    <p>"Cheer up." Wei Zhi patted Wang Zhen on the shoulder and said, "Can't you give it a go with Miss Liu?"</p>

    <p>"No way..." Wang Zhen shook his head. "Do you know how happy the Liu family elders were at finding out that our Wang family wants to ally with them through marriage? Every single one of them rolled around on the floor like mantis shrimps and couldn't stop laughing."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen sighed. "The thing I couldn't accept the most was that they actually knocked Miss Liu out and placed her in my bedroom."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi was shocked. "You... you didn't do anything, did you?"</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen gave Wei Zhi a look and shook his head. "While I, Wang Zhen, might be a little frivolous on occasion, I wouldn't go so far as to lay a hand on a girl. I'm a gentleman!"</p>

    <p>"You're lying." Wei Zhi stared at Wang Zhen.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen: "???"</p>

    <p>"Pushing Large Butterfly told me," Wei Zhi said. "Pushing Large Butterfly's wings can sense faint vibrations in the air. When a person is lying, their breathing changes. So, you and that Miss Liu..."</p>

    <p>"I swear I didn't touch her..."</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen gave up and raised his hands. "I just don't feel anything for her."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi understood. "In other words, if it was a girl you like, you would have done something, right?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen felt like he had fallen into a trap.</p>

    <p>And he couldn't refute at all!</p>

    <p>But it was undeniably true that he felt nothing for Liu Qingyi at the time.</p>

    <p>Reasonably speaking, Wang Zhen thought that if he saw a girl he really liked, even if he wouldn't do anything especially vulgar or shady, he should at the very least be aroused!</p>

    <p>As a man full of energy and vitality, to actually not be aroused by the sight of a pretty girl... didn't that mean he didn't feel anything for her?</p>

    <p>But then again, Wang Zhen had never really fallen in love before.</p>

    <p>From his limited memories of his childhood, he only recalled both his parents beating him up in order to stimulate his physique. It got better as he grew older, but Wang Zhen remembered how controlling his parents were when he was a child. He had no idea what puppy love was before, since once he started looking at pretty girls in school, his parents already became nervous.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, to prevent him from falling in love, they put him in a puppy love treatment center.</p>

    <p>The Treatment Unit Number 13 from back then was still vivid in Wang Zhen's memory.</p>

    <p>But unfortunately, this puppy love treatment center closed down after he was admitted.</p>

    <p>That was because when they were going to use electrotherapy on Wang Zhen, those large men couldn't hold him down at all! Furthermore, the puppy love therapist, whose surname was Yang, made Wang Zhen so angry that he smashed the man head first into the ground. In doing so, Wang Zhen liberated all the children who had been admitted into the center, and each of them had a go at shocking the man with the surname Yang with electricity...</p>

    <p>After that day, Wang Zhen's parents made a huge decision — they decided to do it themselves! They wouldn't entrust it to other people again!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>While Wang Zhen was still complaining to Wei Zhi, there were new developments on Chrysanthemum Island.</p>

    <p>Jin Shi and Yin Shi had been keeping watch at Liu Qingyi's side. In the last two days, she had started making more and more small movements, starting with her fingers, while her eyelids would now flutter from time to time.</p>

    <p>"It looks like it won't be long before she wakes up." Immortal Toya opened both of Miss Liu's eyelids to check her pupils.</p>

    <p>" <em>Shifu </em>, what's her condition like now?" Jin Shi asked in a very young voice.</p>

    <p>"Miss Liu is pretty much fine now. She's completely recovered from her deep coma. She'll wake up in maybe two or three days? Or maybe the next second..."</p>

    <p>As soon as Immortal Toya said the words —</p>

    <p>The eyes of this kun belly girl before him suddenly shot open and she sat up straight, like a dying zombie that had been startled into sitting up.</p>
