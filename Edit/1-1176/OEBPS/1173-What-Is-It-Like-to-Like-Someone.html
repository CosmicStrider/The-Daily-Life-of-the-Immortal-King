  <h1>Chapter 1173 What Is It Like to Like Someone?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Chen Chao was relieved when he saw Wang Ling, who had been missing, bring the fake Wang Zhen safely back to Number 60 High's camp. "Damn, you're finally back! I heard from Nan Yixiu that you went to Mist Peak by yourself to fight Gao Tianming one-on-one? How can you be so brave? Do you have a cheat?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..." As an outstanding individual who had inherited cultivation socialist values, Wang Ling was disinclined to use something as impractical as a cheat - that was because he was a cheat himself, so he didn't need to use one.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was worried that he wouldn't be able to explain what just happened, but Zhuo Yi had naturally prepared for that as well. He arranged for a member of the special forces, who had already been stationed nearby, to deliberately pass over Number 60 High's camp while on his way to help out at Mist Peak. As expected, he was intercepted by the students here.</p>

    <p>"Teacher, what on earth happened on Mist Peak?" Nan Yixiu asked. He felt that it definitely wouldn't be so easy for Wang Ling to bring Wang Zhen back. Who was Wang Ling? He was Number 60 High's mascot and the weakest in their team! If he could snatch Wang Zhen back from a lunatic like Gao Tianming, Wang Ling must have definitely struck some sort of deal with Gao Tianming.</p>

    <p>At the same time, however, Nan Yixiu felt a little puzzled, since it was clear that this member of the special forces was rushing over to Mist Peak, which proved that a fierce battle had likely taken place there.</p>

    <p>This member of the special forces, whose passing had been premeditated, said, "A student with the surname Gao caused a huge explosion, and all the students there were eliminated."</p>

    <p>"All of them were eliminated? Then Wang Ling..."</p>

    <p>"Oh, do you mean the student with dead fish eyes? He was blown away by the qi blast and wasn't caught in the explosion." After saying this, this member of the special forces stepped onto his flying sword and left right away.</p>

    <p>When Nan Yixiu and the people around him heard this, they understood instantly.</p>

    <p>This was because Mist Peak's terrain was unique, as it was surrounded by rising air currents. Thus, when a person fell from Mist Peak, it was like wearing a parachute. So, was that the reason why Wang Ling was able to land safe and sound after he was sent flying by the qi blast, and furthermore was able to bring Wang Zhen back with him?</p>

    <p>After sorting out the entire sequence of events, Nan Yixiu looked at Wang Ling in astonishment.</p>

    <p>Everyone said that this was Number 60 High's good luck charm... Seeing truly was believing, and Nan Yixiu came back to his senses. Was the only thing he could say, "as expected of Wang Ling"?</p>

    <p>This rumored mascot could actually be this lucky!</p>

    <p>"As expected of Classmate Wang Ling!" Nan Yixiu couldn't help but give a thumbs-up and marvel at Wang Ling's awesome operation.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Sun Rong had worried about Wang Ling the entire time, and she breathed easier when she saw him come back safe and sound with Wang Zhen. When she didn't see Wang Ling earlier, she had felt especially nervous, and was even prepared to call her family bodyguards remotely to go up the mountain for a search and rescue...</p>

    <p>This was a privilege that only Sun Rong had.</p>

    <p>That was because after the previous attempted assassination by Shadow Stream, President Qi had in fact allowed Huaguo Water Curtain Group to send more internal group members to protect her, and these people were actually waiting in the distance at that very moment. They weren't allowed to interfere in the competition, but they could protect Sun Rong if it became necessary.</p>

    <p>But Sun Rong wasn't very concerned about her own safety.</p>

    <p>As long as Wang Ling was fine, she could take anything.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong hadn't only been thinking about herself to begin with when it came to the deployment of these bodyguards. There were so many classmates of Number 60 High here; as team captain, she was naturally responsible for protecting her team members.</p>

    <p>"It's good that you're okay."</p>

    <p>Seeing that everyone was safe and sound, the girl smiled. She looked at Wang Ling's face, which was as calm as ever, out of the corner of her eye, and her heart felt somewhat at peace.</p>

    <p>With Wang Ling's return, the second night of the national competition passed without a hitch.</p>

    <p>Everyone on the other main peaks of Nine Dragon Mountain knew that Number 60 High had sent their lone mascot to wipe out the Mist Peak camp that was led by Number 1 Devil-Subduing High... Everyone was stunned, and started to take various measures to guard against Fire Peak; a number of camps that had intended to besiege Fire Peak before this canceled their plans.</p>

    <p>Mainly, everyone felt that there was something ominous about Number 60 High.</p>

    <p>It seemed that anyone who came into contact with Number 60 High came to a bad end.</p>

    <p>In the girls' tent at midnight, Sun Rong sensed that Liu Qingyi seemed uneasy. In many cases, girls were like an open book to each other, and they could understand each other's thoughts.</p>

    <p>"It's my turn on watch." A blanket over her shoulders, Sun Rong said down next to Liu Qingyi and gave her the hot fruit tea she had prepared. Stumped for a bit, Liu Qingyi then reached out to accept the steaming cup of fragrant tea.</p>

    <p>After taking a deep breath of the sweet smell, Liu Qingyi felt much calmer.</p>

    <p>Sugar could stimulate dopamine, which in turn could help get rid of anxiety.</p>

    <p>Holding the hot tea, the two girls sat side by side, hugging their knees.</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi drank the fruit tea with a heavy heart.</p>

    <p>Then, Sun Rong asked bluntly, "Are you worried about Classmate Wang Zhen?"</p>

    <p>"Says who?! Don't... don't talk rubbish..."</p>

    <p>It was clear that Sun Rong had guessed right. Liu Qingyi blushed on the spot, and even her ears turned red.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong suggested, "If you're really worried, you can actually go take a look."</p>

    <p>"I... I just feel something isn't right with Wang Zhen." Liu Qingyi lowered her head and looked troubled as she said, "He hasn't said anything or quarreled with me after coming back."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong nodded. "That's a little strange."</p>

    <p>Even she could tell that Classmate Wang Zhen's behavior seemed a little "wooden" now, and he was always in a daze like a blockhead.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong wondered, "Could it be that Gao Tianming scared him silly? I heard that the explosion on Mist Peak was quite violent. If it wasn't for the protective golden talisman, everyone might have been seriously injured..."</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi didn't respond.</p>

    <p>She was well aware that the whole story might not be that simple.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen was a thick-skinned person, and had a very sturdy body; after living with Wang Zhen at Wei Zhi's place, she knew very well what his character was like.</p>

    <p>In fact, after knowing him for this long, she no longer found him so annoying.</p>

    <p>This person who had come down from the Domain of the Gods to "escape marriage" like her... There were times when he could even be reliable. At the very least, he gave her the feeling that he was shouldering his responsibilities the way a man should.</p>

    <p>Emotions were always so complicated.</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi thought that this wasn't something a young girl could understand, since there was an age gap between her and Sun Rong, and she was reluctant to share this worry of hers with anyone else. Now that Sun Rong had hit the nail on the head, however, Liu Qingyi started to slowly lower her guard.</p>

    <p>Perhaps she had placed too much importance on age?</p>

    <p>"What's it like to like someone?" asked Liu Qingyi in a low voice.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong looked at the other side, where Wang Ling was looking up at the dark sky, and said to Liu Qingyi, "When you like someone, you'll always feel worried and anxious for him; even when he's looking at the sky, you'll worry that the stars might fall and hit him..."</p>
