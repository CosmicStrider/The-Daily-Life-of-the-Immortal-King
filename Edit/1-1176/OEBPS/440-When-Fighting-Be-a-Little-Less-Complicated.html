  <h1>Chapter 440 When Fighting, Be a Little Less Complicated... </h1>

  <div>

    <p>In the instant that Evil Sword God was directly smacked into the ground, a saying came to mind: pushed a third into the ground <sup>1</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A literal translation of the phrase 入土三分,which is adapted from the phrase 入木三分,which literally translates to 'pushed a third into the wood,' but as a idiom refers to profound knowledge or understanding ..)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling fixed his gaze on that deep man-shaped depression in the ground, green smoke still wafting from his palm.</p>

    <p>Actually, when he had still been at home earlier, he had been aware of feeling a little uneasy; it was a pity that he had been one step too late.</p>

    <p>This slap was to teach Evil Sword God a lesson for his arrogance, and Wang Ling hadn't used all of his strength.</p>

    <p>That was because Wang Ling thought that this devil dying from just one slap would be going too easy on him...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling hovered in the air. When he had slapped Evil Sword God, his intrinsic spirit field had already covered their surroundings at the same time, forming an independent space separated from the real world to prevent bystanders from being swept up in the battle.</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God crawled out of the hole with a swollen bleeding face, and it twitched slightly with more shock than anger.</p>

    <p>He stared at Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>Itinerant Immortal?</p>

    <p>No... judging from realm and aura alone, the young man in front of Evil Sword God was indeed without doubt an Itinerant Immortal, but he should definitely be stronger than that.</p>

    <p>For a mere Itinerant Immortal to wreck him to this extent with a single slap really wasn't scientific...</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God raised his eyes and reached out to stroke his cheek. A purple light glowed in his hand and the swelling on his face was almost instantly healed.</p>

    <p>Jumping out of the pit, he looked at his surroundings and found that the landscape had changed. Because of his Purple Investigative Demon Eyes, he was well aware that this wasn't an illusion, but a real scene — that old-fashioned stone sculpture, the dozen or so palm trees clinging stubbornly to life, the school building behind him that looked like it had been renovated many times... everything was without doubt real.</p>

    <p>And at that very moment, that youngster who had smacked him into the ground with a single slap appeared on the old stone sculpture to look down on him.</p>

    <p>"Discharging an intrinsic spirit field straightaway..." Evil Sword God's eyes darkened; this young mongrel cultivator wasn't as simple as he had expected.</p>

    <p>In addition to exhibiting tremendous power beyond his own realm, he could instantly discharge an intrinsic spirit field, something that originally could only be done by True Immortals.</p>

    <p>From all of this, it was clear that the youngster's strength was unusual.</p>

    <p>"Ah... was I careless?" Thinking this, Evil Sword God clutched his stomach and started to laugh hard as if he had lost his mind.</p>

    <p>It had been so many years...</p>

    <p>It had already been too long since he had last tasted pain. Wang Ling's slap had roused him, and he could feel the evil in his blood roil incessantly throughout his whole body.</p>

    <p>"Mongrel cultivator, well done! You've succeeded in drawing my interest! The junior I killed earlier had the guts to track the sword qi back to me, and I considered it a provocation!"</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God held the Brilliant Victory sword in his left hand and the Heaven-Cleaving sword in his right hand. Then he raised his right arm and pointed the sword at Wang Ling. "Since you are his friend and you've shown me great disrespect, you should be punished the same way! Not just you! When I cut you up into eight pieces, I'll steal your soul, and kill your family and friends one by one!"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Wang Ling took a deep breath.</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, Evil Sword God looked around with considerable disdain and snorted. "Hmph! How can this mere intrinsic spirit field stop me?"</p>

    <p>He was very confident and believed that he had just been careless earlier; at that time, he hadn't exhibited any defensive measures and had only used his body to ward off the attack. Due to his inattention, he had suffered a great loss.</p>

    <p>Now that he was serious, he felt his evil nature surge up - Wang Ling's slap had roused his battle spirit!</p>

    <p>Not only that, he now had both Heaven-Cleaving and Brilliant Victory, the two spirit swords that had both powerful offensive and defensive abilities in the ranking list of spirit swords, which made him even more powerful than before.</p>

    <p>"Mongrel cultivator... from the moment I seized this Brilliant Victory sword, the game was already over!"</p>

    <p>The next moment, Evil Sword God attacked again!</p>

    <p>"Mongrel cultivator, die!"</p>

    <p>He moved in a flash like lightning, and even though he was in Wang Ling's intrinsic spirit field, he was still very quick!</p>

    <p>With the two swords in hand, he split into a dazzling and dizzying number of clones as he advanced on the old stone sculpture which Wang Ling was standing on.</p>

    <p>Looking at this scene, Wang Ling sighed in his heart. He didn't quite understand why the higher a person's realm was nowadays, the more fond they were of performing stunts in battle.</p>

    <p>This kind of showy attack style wasn't just a headache; from what Wang Ling could see, it didn't play any key role in reversing the final outcome of the battle.</p>

    <p>So, wasn't it fine to be less complicated...</p>

    <p>Watching Evil Sword God charge over and split into more and more shadow clones, Wang Ling's eyes remained fixed on the other party's original body.</p>

    <p>Then, he raised his hand as he prepared to deliver a second slap...</p>

    <p>Hm...</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God's original body was getting closer...</p>

    <p>The next moment, a figure appeared in front of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, however, completely ignored it.</p>

    <p>His face was indifferent and expressionless.</p>

    <p>"Go to hell! Mongrel cultivator!" At this moment, Evil Sword God's original body appeared behind him.</p>

    <p>On the old stone sculpture, Wang Ling turned his body...</p>

    <p><em>Bam </em>!</p>

    <p>Like playing golf, the second slap landed on Evil Sword God's face with accurate precision once again!</p>

    <p>That tremendous force was almost like being crushed under a roller, and half of his face directly caved in.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sent Evil Sword God flying again!</p>

    <p>It was a different start but the outcome was still the same; history had a remarkable way of repeating itself...</p>

    <p>Evil Sword had already been thrown through the school building in the intrinsic spirit field, Wang Ling's slap sending him smashing directly through a number of classrooms and the toilets in passing in the main building... When he finally flew out, he had a toilet tank on his head.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at him, his posture relaxed. He waved his hand and called the two swords next to Evil Sword God to his hands with the Gravitation Spell.</p>

    <p>"How is this possible..."</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God climbed to his feet on the sports field, his face bloody as he spat out a mouthful of fresh blood.</p>

    <p>He had been completely thrashed!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, Wang Ling turned his head to look elsewhere in the air.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei, who had been turned into a bloody mist by the power of Sword Dao earlier, was already taking shape once more; even the long johns and the white Daoist robe he had been wearing were perfectly restored. With the extraordinary effects of the Soul Suppression Ring, he was directly resurrected on the spot without a hair out of place!</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling had rushed here earlier, he had already sensed that Lord Diulei hadn't really died because he could feel that the spirit sword contract between the Brilliant Victory sword and Lord Diulei had yet to be broken.</p>

    <p>Of the ten Soul Suppression Rings which he had refined by referring to <em>Eight Classes of Divine Weapons </em>and using the Great Weapon-Refining Spell, only Lord Diulei's ring was the most unique while the rest were third-class holy weapons on average.</p>

    <p>In addition to being able to accommodate a soul space, the most important ability the Soul Suppression Ring had was to preserve a soul and prevent it from dispersing; after two minutes, the soul would act as a foundation for the formation of a new physical body in a resurrection process.</p>

    <p>This was a genuine resurrection ring.</p>

    <p>The difference was that the third-class Soul Suppression Rings which the others had could only perform resurrections twice.</p>

    <p>But the one that Lord Diulei had in his hand was a world-defying magic treasure...</p>

    <p>As long as the ring wasn't destroyed...</p>

    <p>Theoretically, it could...</p>

    <p>Perform unlimited resurrections...</p>
