  <h1>Chapter 500 Lord Diulei's "Bang" Performance </h1>

  <div>

    <p>This was the rare opportunity that Lord Diulei had been waiting for, and just when he had the chance to show off, someone stole his kill! He could only describe this act in two phrases: 1. Made his blood boil 2. Crazy!</p>

    <p>But he wasn't in a position to say too much. After all, it was commonplace for more than one player to aim at the same target. It could only be said that the water fan had bad luck: two sniper experts had shot at him at the same time, and ultimately he didn't even know how he had died.</p>

    <p>But Lord Diulei felt that there was no reason to be too anxious; there were still forty-six people left, so he still had plenty of chances to show off. The latest safe zone now covered the entire airfield peninsula on the map. After seeing this new safe zone, the players still alive would undoubtedly head in the direction of the airfield from the other major cities on the map.</p>

    <p>But in order to approach the airfield peninsula, they had to take a speedboat or swim across the river, otherwise they could only cross the bridge by force.</p>

    <p>Usually, if the safe zone was in the airfield peninsula, there were sure to be people keeping watch and waiting to rob others at the bridge.</p>

    <p>When there had been a sharp decline from sixty to fifty players earlier, it had been people rushing the bridge, only to heroically sacrifice themselves...</p>

    <p>This hadn't been a result of a cheat, and was just a typical drop in numbers. If cheats really had been involved, Lord Diulei felt that Wang Ming would have punished the people responsible already.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei could hence already foresee that in a short while, the airfield peninsula would become the center of a battle on a scale no less than when Li Yunlong had attacked the county seat of Pingan <sup>1</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Li Yunlong is the protagonist of the novel 'Drawing Sword' by famous Chinese writer Duliang. The story revolves around the battle of Pingan county which took place during the Second Sino-Japanese War.)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling and Lord Diulei currently occupied a relatively advantageous position; this happened to be in the crane's blind spot, and anyone standing on " <em>youtiao </em>" would only be able to detect them with great difficulty. Secondly, it was likely no one would expect the final god-blessed circle to be in this house. That was because the other half of the airfield peninsula was open territory, and generally, when it came down to the decisive battle, the final circle would most likely be in this open area.</p>

    <p>In Lord Diulei's view, the odds that the circle would be centered on this rooftop was as high as the odds of Wang Ling opening his mouth to speak...</p>

    <p>Hm...</p>

    <p>At this thought, Lord Diulei stole a glance at Wang Ling out of the corner of his eye.</p>

    <p>He knew that Wang Ling could read minds, but from the expression on his face, it was clear that he hadn't done so.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, he would already have been scowling...</p>

    <p>But conversely, it showed that Wang Ling was seriously focused on the game.</p>

    <p>Although his gaming experience this time indeed wasn't great, Lord Diulei suddenly felt that he was very fortunate to see a totally different side to Wang Ling other than his normal study behavior.</p>

    <p>To him, this Brother Ling would forever be his role model.</p>

    <p>When he could sense the gradual increase in the number of people close by, Wang Ling's expression gradually turned serious.</p>

    <p>He could already see from afar a lot of small black dots coming from all directions as more and more people approached the airfield.</p>

    <p>But at this distance, he could only see moving pixelated dots; unless he used a cheat, he wouldn't be able to hit them, even with a sniper rifle.</p>

    <p>He would need to wait until they drew closer.</p>

    <p>Finding a proper angle, Wang Ling opened his scope and aimed at the pixelated dots closest to him.</p>

    <p>It was a team that was actually on motorbikes, and they would be within shooting range very soon.</p>

    <p>"Team from the north-west." Wang Ling spoke telepathically, his voice as cool as ever.</p>

    <p>Actually, he felt that he could deal with them himself, but he didn't want to rob Lord Diulei of the opportunity to show off. At the very least, they should actually feel like they were playing the game...</p>

    <p>Following Wang Ling's information, Lord Diulei quickly aimed at this team; the two of them were in level three outfits and looked like two fat lambs. It looked like one of them was carrying an AWM on his back, which was the ultimate sniper rifle in this game. Unfortunately, these two were really too far away, so Wang Ling and Lord Diulei wouldn't be able to search through their bags even if they killed them.</p>

    <p>"Farewell, bros."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei narrowed his eyes and clicked the mouse. With a clear <em>bang </em>from the 98K in his hand, he directly blew off the level three helmet which one of the players was wearing.</p>

    <p>Just as he was about to shoot a second time...</p>

    <p>This person had actually already fallen down and Lord Diulei's second shot was a dead one...</p>

    <p>The kill notification popped up on the public screen.</p>

    <p><em>Player "WF" has used "M24" to kill player PIPIku with a headshot...</em></p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>His kill had been stolen again!!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei took even breaths as he did his best to calm down. A turbulent mood could affect his accuracy; this was the biggest fear of any excellent sniper. He didn't want his performance to turn into a "bang"<sup>2</sup> just because two of his kills had been stolen.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(A relatively new colloquial gaming term to mean a player is lame.)</dfn>

    <p>He drew in a breath and opened his scope as he aimed at that PIPIku's teammate. "Brother Ling, I'll definitely kill someone for you to see today!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>After his teammate had been killed with a sniper shot, this person swiftly hid in the closest shelter; it was a toilet which was actually in a very bad position. Anyone nearby could throw a grenade inside and kill him.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei knew that this person was panicking. Many newbies would be thrown into confusion after their teammates were killed and they weren't careful in choosing a place for shelter. Although this toilet would provide cover from bullets, there were small windows on all sides. Unless a player lay down on their stomach, their head was easily exposed, which was just asking to die.</p>

    <p>After his teammate PIPIku had been shot dead, this person's level three helmet had been blown off with a shot from WF while the player had been fleeing to the toilet.</p>

    <p>Without a helmet, he could be instantly killed with a headshot, whether it was with a M24 or 98K.</p>

    <p>So now was the time to stake everything on hand speed...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei regulated his breathing and watched for an opportunity to act.</p>

    <p>Less than two seconds later, he saw the player's head poke up through the toilet window and his reaction was very quick as he swiftly took the shot!</p>

    <p><em>Bang </em>!</p>

    <p>After his shot, he saw the system notification.</p>

    <p>System notification: <em>Player "WF" has used "M24" to kill player PIPIku <sup>2</sup> </em><em>with a headshot...</em></p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Yes, author's mistake, unless this player was also called PIPIku ....)</dfn>

    <p>He couldn't help swearing. "Shit! That was intentional! This guy is definitely doing it deliberately!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "He targets my targets! Brother Ling, I can't take it anymore, I'm going to punish him!"</p>

    <p>After he said that, Lord Diulei jumped out before Wang Ling could stop him.</p>

    <p>The farther away Lord Diulei was from Wang Ling's character in the game, the weaker the effect of Wang Ling's "Great Fortune Spell" would be for him...</p>

    <p>Hm...</p>

    <p>After that, it was just as Wang Ling expected.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei never came back...</p>
