  <h1>Chapter 805 Ants' Counterattack</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When Wang Zhen saw this young miss of the Liu family, Liu Qingyi, on the bed, there was something clearly amiss about his expression; the specifics could be summed up as flickering eyes and trembling lips, and even his hands jerked extremely unnaturally, like he didn't know where to put them.</p>

    <p>Even a simpleton could see that there was definitely something between them!</p>

    <p>"It looks like senior recognizes this girl?" asked Immortal Toya.</p>

    <p>"No! I don't know her at all! I don't even know her surname is Liu!" Wang Zhen denied swiftly.</p>

    <p>It was clear that Wang Zhen's IQ had gone offline at that moment.</p>

    <p>"... Senior, I think it's better for you to be honest."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya sighed. "Senior Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch is deliberately giving you a chance. Whether we give it to you will depend on your attitude. Right now, there are so many seals on you, making you no different from a regular person. If you die like this in the world below, you probably won't be able to rest in peace, will you?"</p>

    <p>"Are you threatening me?" Wang Zhen grit his teeth.</p>

    <p>He never expected that he, the grand young master of the Wang family of the Nine-fold Domain of the Gods, would actually be reduced to this. He had spent so much time and effort looking for the thief, but not only didn't he find him, he even lost all his abilities. And this wasn't even the worst bit... after losing all his power, he had run into his troublesome fiancée!</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen really didn't know if this was a natural or man-made disaster...</p>

    <p>He had been beaten the whole time he was growing up; never did he think that he still wouldn't be able to escape an unlucky fate even now.</p>

    <p>It felt like all of it had been planned early on in the dark, only for everything to come out all at once.</p>

    <p>It was like a multi-millionaire losing everything in an instant, and then running into his ex-girlfriend who had brought along a billionaire to taunt him.</p>

    <p>Was there anything more wretched than this on earth?</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen felt like crying.</p>

    <p>"Senior, you might not think much of us inhabitants on the world below, but based on information we currently have, the Domain of the Gods was created back then by a man from this world. This time, it wasn't that senior wasn't strong enough, but that you looked down on us too much," said Immortal Toya.</p>

    <p>If it hadn't been for what happened in Beast King's tomb, no one would have known that there was such a place as Nine-fold Domain of the Gods, let alone that there were still more terrifying realm stages above Venerated Immortal. For many people, the existence of the Domain of the Gods was too unreal. Even for Immortal Zhenyuan, a cultivation legend recognized by the people, it was a level that was too far out of reach.</p>

    <p>But now, Wang Zhen was here...</p>

    <p>This was a major opportunity.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen pondered for a long time.</p>

    <p>His gaze rested on Liu Qingyi, and he finally sighed. "I can tell you what you want to know, but before that, I have a few conditions."</p>

    <p>"Let's hear them, senior."</p>

    <p>"I need to get away from here - anywhere is fine, as long as it's not next to this Lady Liu. I don't want her to see me after she wakes up. Another thing, I hope you'll keep it a secret that you saw me. Lastly, if I tell you what I know, you must have that Senior Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch undo the seals on me."</p>

    <p>"Mm, these conditions sound reasonable." Immortal Toya nodded. "But can I ask why senior is avoiding this Miss Liu like the plague?"</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen's face darkened. "She is my fiancée."</p>

    <p>"Senior's fiancée?"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya was shocked by this answer. "But why did this young lady appear inside the belly of a scavenger kun?"</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen: "..."</p>

    <p>Earlier, Wang Zhen had been wondering how on earth Liu Qingyi had come down to the world below.</p>

    <p>One had to go through checks to come down to the world below, and had to use a portal.</p>

    <p>After listening to Immortal Toya, Wang Zhen instantly understood.</p>

    <p>This girl actually hid inside a kun's belly!</p>

    <p>At this realization, Wang Zhen couldn't help looking up at the sky and lamenting, "... She had it coming!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, President Bai was in the middle of collecting the power of Outer Dao.</p>

    <p>There were six Great Outer Dao, which represented six ultimate abilities:</p>

    <p>Seven Stars Devil Escape (The power of physical immunity).</p>

    <p>Yin and Yang Escape Technique (The power of magical immunity).</p>

    <p>Pure Heart Magic Ring (The power of ultimate immunity).</p>

    <p>Five Elements Ghost Art (The power to manipulate the elements).</p>

    <p>The Fury of Heaven (The power of Outer Dao punishment).</p>

    <p>Plus the Reverse Polarity which President Bai had mastered, which represented the power to defy heaven and change fate.</p>

    <p>At that moment, President Bai had arrived at the edge of a cliff surrounded by clouds and mist.</p>

    <p>This was a place inside the border of Mixiu nation called the Valley of the Dead. It was once a popular spot for jumpers, and there were countless bones piled up at the bottom of the valley, creating a dense Yin aura.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, it was a tourist attraction instead.</p>

    <p>Cultivators unafraid of death often organized group trips and would ride special magic artifacts to visit the place. In the last few years, however, the number of visitors had dwindled given the frequent disappearances that had been happening in the Valley of the Dead recently.</p>

    <p>Some sightseeing cultivation groups, and even airplanes flying over the valley, had mysteriously disappeared.</p>

    <p>"The Five Elements Ghost Art is here." President Bai swayed in the wind, his voice sounding a little unreal as it passed through the clouds.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, regular people didn't dare approach this place. If it wasn't for Night Ghost Spirit Emperor's True Immortal body, President Bai might also have been a little afraid.</p>

    <p>A giant centipede climbed onto President Bai's shoulder, remotely controlled by Long Ming through the Soul Insect Technique. "As Venerated Lord has commanded, I've inspected the valley floor. As expected, there's something unusual about it."</p>

    <p>There were numerous poisonous insects in the Valley of the Dead, so the use of Insect Envoy Long Ming's Art of Insect Manipulation was extremely vital; no matter how dangerous the valley floor was, as long as there were insects, he could carry out an investigation by controlling them. Even if these insects died by chance, he wouldn't be affected.</p>

    <p>In the past, the Long clan's Art of Insect Manipulation was a secret technique on par with the Bai clan's Creation Art. When Night Ghost Spirit Lord founded Night Chief, he had recruited people from everywhere, and naturally had roped Long Ming into serving under him.</p>

    <p>In fact, Long Ming's and President Bai's experiences were surprisingly similar.</p>

    <p>"All these years, this Valley of the Dead has never been peaceful, so I long presumed that a power of Outer Dao might have fallen here. Unfortunately, I never had the opportunity to come and investigate, but looking at it now, this seems to very likely be the case."</p>

    <p>"What kind of Outer Dao is the Five Elements Ghost Art?" asked Long Ming.</p>

    <p>"It's the power to manipulate the elements. As long as I can master it, I can use the five elements to create all kinds of primary spirits. Each and every one of the first great primary spirits were True Immortals. With their assistance, our battle strength will naturally increase."</p>

    <p>There was some excitement on President Bai's face as he gazed over the edge of the cliff. "I can't help getting excited."</p>

    <p>After that, he directly leapt down from the cliff.</p>
