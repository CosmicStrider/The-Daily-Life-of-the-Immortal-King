  <h1>Chapter 672 Elder Aunt!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon's soul mark disappeared so abruptly that it was more ruthless than the lights turning off for the male guest on the dating show <em>If You Are The One </em>.</p>

    <p>Elder Ji Xing stared at the soul crystal ball in front of him and repeatedly confirmed that the soul mark had disappeared; this was difficult for him to accept. Before the official launch of their operation the following day, two of their fifteen overseas returnee elites from the Demon Hunters Association had actually died just like that. Moreover, one of them was Elder Poisonous Dragon, who was ranked in the top five...</p>

    <p>This bitter loss was unbearable for Elder Ji Xing. As for how Elder Poisonous Dragon had died, that was also another mystery. Even if that silver-haired young man was a little difficult to deal with, it was unlikely that Elder Poisonous Dragon wouldn't have been able to handle Great Death-Courting Senior, who was only at the Soul Formation stage!</p>

    <p>Therefore, Elder Ji Xing felt that there was something deeply strange about this case.</p>

    <p>"What are you thinking, Sonico?" asked that Mount Heaven Young-Old Woman Brother Nanco, who looked like a child but was an adult inside.</p>

    <p>Elder Ji Xing grabbed the back of his head as he felt it ache and sighed. "I'm wondering if our operation this time is a good idea."</p>

    <p>Because in the end, they had no knowledge at all on that young expert's true realm. President Bai had never fought him before and had only made a rough guess that the other party was likely an expert at early or middle True Immortal level. But in tomorrow's battle, apart from setting up the barrier, President Bai would also fight this young expert himself... It would be a grudge match between True Immortals.</p>

    <p>But that was the problem. They were just assuming that the other side was a True Immortal... If the other side's strength was more powerful than early or middle True Immortal level, what then?</p>

    <p>"Is Sonico afraid?" Elder Nanco asked relentlessly.</p>

    <p>"Afraid? How can that be?" Elder Ji Xing shook his head; when there was nothing to lose, there was nothing to fear. Since they had already chosen to launch this attack, of course he wasn't afraid. Even if they weren't able to kill that young expert in the end, their plan would still be considered a success as long as they could take revenge on the rest of Number 60 High's teachers and students.</p>

    <p>Even if that young expert was very strong, there was no way he could protect everyone while he was fighting President Bai, could he?</p>

    <p>He wasn't Heavenly Dao, after all!</p>

    <p>This was what Elder Ji Xing thought.</p>

    <p>At that moment Elder Nanco asked, "Don't we need to retrieve Elder Poisonous Dragon's body?"</p>

    <p>"Poisonous Dragon must have overexerted himself; his body wouldn't be any use to us even if we have it. There's no harm in not taking it back. When our Demon Hunters Association planted the soul marks, we also put in a setting: once the person implanted with the soul mark dies, all the memories stored in the head will disappear. So, we don't have to worry about the police finding any clues on Elder Poisonous Dragon's body," Elder Ji Xing said.</p>

    <p>The one thing he was concerned about now was whether Elder Yaren's retrieval of the body was going smoothly.</p>

    <p>Elder Yaren was second only to him in overall strength among the team of fifteen people.</p>

    <p>So Elder Ji Xing was very confident in Elder Yaren's strength.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Using Blood Hunt, Elder Yaren found the road which Elder Yin had died on.</p>

    <p>Elder Yaren hid himself at the end of the road since this section was already blocked off. In addition to the air control up ahead, several barricades had even been set up on the road. Traffic police at the intersection diverted vehicles wanting to pass through to other routes.</p>

    <p>It seemed that Elder Yin wasn't far ahead...</p>

    <p>Elder Yaren narrowed his eyes.</p>

    <p>He also surmised that the other party was clearly aware that Elder Yin's body was highly poisonous, hence why the road and sky here had been blocked off and no cultivators were allowed through.</p>

    <p>Even if Elder Yin was already dead, the poison in his body was still extremely dreadful, so the police had actually handled the matter quite sensibly. But this was also an opportunity Elder Yaren could take advantage of since there were no outsiders in this section and the only ones passing by were police vehicles.</p>

    <p>Thus, when Elder Yaren saw a heavily-armed white anti-chemical protection vehicle in the distance stop at an intersection to be inspected by the traffic police, he already had a plan.</p>

    <p>He was a person who didn't like to complicate things. Since the organization had charged him this time to bring back Elder Yin's body, then he should avoid fighting as much as possible, otherwise he would only create unnecessary trouble before the master plan officially started tomorrow.</p>

    <p>"Blood Escape Teleportation Spell!" Elder Yaren recited in a low voice.</p>

    <p>In an instant, his whole body turned into blood which flowed over the ground and scuttled in one direction! This "Blood Escape Teleportation Spell" was also one of Elder Yaren's famous skills. It could freely break the body down into a moving fluid form which could recombine again after it reached its intended location. It was different from the Body Transformation Spell.</p>

    <p>Strictly speaking, the Body Transformation Spell was a type of resurrection spell. Even if he died, Elder Yaren could reconstruct his body with the Body Transformation Spell.</p>

    <p>The Blood Escape Teleportation Spell, on the other hand, was in fact a body displacement technique, which allowed Elder Yaren to freely transform his body into liquid blood.</p>

    <p>And the trickiest thing about this spell was how it could be used in battle; when used properly, it could cancel out all physical spells and spiritual techniques.</p>

    <p>Physical attacks were thus useless on Elder Yaren, which was also the reason why he was ranked so high.</p>

    <p>He had a built-in immunity to physical attacks! And he was also called: ElderAunt <sup>1</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(In China, the term "great
aunt" is sometimes used to
refer to a girl's period ..)</dfn>

    <p>Liquid blood swiftly settled in the middle of the road and piled up bit by bit until it finally turned into a young man with short white hair who wore a dark red Daoist robe with a blood red pattern of a sun on it.</p>

    <p>Elder Yaren teleported himself to the middle of the road just as the anti-chemical protection vehicle sped in his direction from the road intersection.</p>

    <p>The little brother driving the vehicle was startled when he suddenly saw a person appear in the middle of the road and hurriedly stepped on the brake. "Why's there someone there? <em>Aiya </em>! Not good!"</p>

    <p>But it was already too late and the anti-chemical protection vehicle directly ran over Elder Yaren's body.</p>

    <p>The driver little brother was utterly shocked. When he got out to check, he saw that the bottom of the wheels was splattered with blood... He had actually crushed this person to a pulp!</p>

    <p>Dressed in a white anti-chemical protection suit, the little brother sank to his knees in utter grief and started to doubt life... Over! It was all over! He had run someone down! His career was ruined!</p>

    <p>"What's the matter?"</p>

    <p>There were several other anti-chemical protection personnel in the vehicle. At that moment, they all got out of the car to check the situation. Seeing that they were all present, Elder Yaren instantly changed from his blood state to his human form, and while the personnel were off guard, he immediately cast a spell. "Blood Binding Spell!"</p>

    <p>A blood-colored cloth shot out from his palm and turned into a long blood whip which bound these six anti-chemical protection personnel together tightly.</p>

    <p>The moment the blood whip wrapped around them, these little brothers one by one started to feel faint from a lack of blood before their vision darkened and they all passed out...</p>
