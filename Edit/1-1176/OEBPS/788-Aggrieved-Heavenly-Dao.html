  <h1>Chapter 788 Aggrieved Heavenly Dao</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The other Ten Generals were still here, and there were still so many technical staff present. As a commander... how could the aloof Wisdom Saint laugh?</p>

    <p>"Now that everyone has agreed, then this is what we've decided for the time being. We'll discuss everything after Little Ming comes back." President Qi did his best to contain his emotions and cleared his throat.</p>

    <p>"By the way, did the head of state find any clues on the mysterious expert?" General Yi asked again at that moment.</p>

    <p>He was very focused on the expert lurking among the teachers.</p>

    <p>"For the moment, it seems not. This senior is so good at hiding that even the head of state is unable to detect him."</p>

    <p>President Qi shook his head. "But it doesn't matter. After everyone returns from Beast King's Remains, we'll be conducting a physical exam especially aimed at all the lead teachers."</p>

    <p>"A physical exam?" General Yi raised his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>His mind was subconsciously telling him that this physical exam was anything but simple.</p>

    <p>President Qi nodded. "We've always carried out a physical exam in the past, mainly for quarantine purposes when we examine teachers who were injured to see if they accidentally brought back any unusual viruses from the remains. But this year's physical exam is for everyone; not just the teachers, but also the students who attended the summer camp. That is also the head of state's opinion."</p>

    <p>Everybody already understood when President Qi said this.</p>

    <p>This physical exam for all the teachers was most likely a plan specially aimed at that mysterious expert...</p>

    <p>High-precision scientific equipment was used in a physical exam, and common concealment techniques had no way of escaping detection. Besides, a blood test was absolutely unavoidable during quarantine. If a teacher avoided taking the physical exam when the time came, he could basically be included on the list of suspects.</p>

    <p>In a word, it would definitely be a very difficult situation for the mysterious expert to get out of.</p>

    <p>The Ten Generals all nodded their heads.</p>

    <p>This move by the head of state was truly brilliant!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Then, it was August 5th on Saturday in the fifteenth week of the semester.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling got home in the early hours of the morning as Zhuo Yi drove him to the front of the Wang family's small villa.</p>

    <p>Actually, Wang Ming originally planned to send Wang Ling home himself, but in the end, he still couldn't persuade Zhai Yin to let him do so, and she dragged him back to the research institute to make a report... She had been incredibly tense when she heard the news that the institute was going to punish Wang Ming, and was still unaware of the decision to exempt him from punishment.</p>

    <p>So after they came back from the remains, Zhai Yin forcefully dragged Wang Ming off to admit his mistake as soon as possible and demonstrate the right attitude in order to fight for leniency later.</p>

    <p>Er Ha hadn't been at home the last two days, and had run off again to play games with Wei Zhi.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi could be considered a pet trainer of some repute in Songhai city. He now spent the whole day with Er Ha: walking together, taking public transport together, and going out together. Because of this, Er Ha no longer needed to surreptitiously take public transport. Even when it spoke on the bus, no one thought it was strange.</p>

    <p>Because Wei Zhi was a famous pet trainer...</p>

    <p>What was so weird about him owning a talking dog?</p>

    <p>The only thing Er Ha still needed to worry about was the Society of Saints...</p>

    <p>In the last few days when Wang Ling hadn't been home, President Fu of the Society of Saints and his secretary Han Jin had dropped in for a visit. They wanted to hire Er Ha at a high salary to be the class monitor of the spirit beast class at the Society of Saints... Unfortunately, however, Er Ha had just happened to be at Wei Zhi's place at the time, and Father Wang and Mother Wang couldn't directly make the decision for it.</p>

    <p>Thus, President Fu and his assistant changed course and went to the family apartment building that Wei Zhi was in.</p>

    <p>However, they couldn't get in at all...</p>

    <p>For Er Ha, its current life on Earth was very comfortable, especially after it had adapted to this body. Its days were very relaxed and pleasant. In a place like a spirit beast class, all the spirit beasts would have owners behind them who most likely didn't have ordinary identities. If Er Ha decided to enter this class, it might instead cause problems for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Mm...</p>

    <p>The above was what Wang Ling had seen in Er Ha's diary.</p>

    <p>Er Ha's diary was always open and wasn't tucked away in some secret place; it was just left under Wang Ling's bed...</p>

    <p>It had to be said that Er Ha was getting better and better at writing. The characters it wrote with a pen in its paw were very bold and vigorous. Furthermore, each character was a very uniform square. They looked neat and tidy from a distance, and were incredibly orderly! They looked like print, and were simply a delight for OCD people!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't rest that night, and instead was busy thinking about what had happened during the summer camp.</p>

    <p>He had indeed gained a lot from the summer camp, but it was a lot of hassle as well...</p>

    <p>Dealing with the aftermath was a huge problem.</p>

    <p>First of all, Li Mingyao and Zhou Youzheng, these two young masters from Remnant High, definitely wouldn't give up looking for him. These two were pretty influential in Songhai city, and were like ticking time bombs. He had to find a way to handle them later.</p>

    <p>Of course, compared with Li Mingyao and Zhou Youzheng, the head of state was the big problem.</p>

    <p>While Wang Ling hadn't directly attracted the head of state's attention this time, everyone had received the notification on the way back from the summer camp that they had to undergo a quarantine physical exam next Monday.</p>

    <p>This quarantine was for all the teachers and students who had participated in the summer camp.</p>

    <p>It was obvious that the head of state must have discovered something, and his suspicions about the "mysterious expert" was already no longer purely limited to the teachers...</p>

    <p>Since Wang Ling had to be on guard against this, he had to put measures in place beforehand, otherwise he would be caught unprepared when the time came, which would be self-defeatist.</p>

    <p>Of course, apart from all this hassle...</p>

    <p>Speaking of what he had gained from the summer camp this time, it had to be the "Domain of the Gods."</p>

    <p>The Domain of the Gods was indeed real, because from a young age, Wang Ling had been having countless vague dreams of a divine immortal island, but he didn't know nor did he have any memory of what that place was...</p>

    <p>Was that place the Domain of the Gods?</p>

    <p>Or, was it a place related to the Domain of the Gods?</p>

    <p>What information Wang Ming and Zhuo Yi had learned from Devil King about the Domain of the Gods was still rather limited.</p>

    <p>Any discussion had to wait until Xiao Yin saw whatever was inside the small black box which Devil King had given him.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling pondered, chin in hand.</p>

    <p>Then, he rapped on the floor...</p>

    <p>After the last time he had set up the Heavenly Dao array in his room, Wang Ling had especially told Mother Wang not to erase it for convenience' sake.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling just needed to rap on the floor.</p>

    <p>Moments later, the three-inch man that was the embodiment of Heavenly Dao appeared in the middle of the array...</p>

    <p>"What do you want this time?"</p>

    <p>The three-inch man was scared when he saw Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Then he looked at the floor, and when he realized that this was still the same array which Wang Ling had used to summon him the last time, he was instantly speechless.</p>

    <p>He was Heavenly Dao!!</p>

    <p>Not Tudi Gong <sup>1</sup> !!!!</p>
