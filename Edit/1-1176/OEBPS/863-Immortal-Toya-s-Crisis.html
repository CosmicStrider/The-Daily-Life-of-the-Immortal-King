  <h1>Chapter 863 Immortal Toya's Crisis</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At that moment, the Lord and Lady were drenched in cold sweat.</p>

    <p>This man in front of them was extremely difficult to deal with. He had gray hair and the dignified temperament of a scion of a noble family. He seemed elegant and graceful, but his eyes were full of murderous intent - when he smiled, it seemed to hide a knife which was being held at the Lord's and Lady's throats.</p>

    <p>The Lord and Lady were somewhat familiar with this type of pressure...</p>

    <p>Hm...</p>

    <p>There was no mistake.</p>

    <p>This was the same type of pressure that Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch gave them.</p>

    <p>The Lord and the Lady broke out in a cold sweat and didn't know what to choose.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Gu Shunzhi's brow furrowed slightly, his eyes fixed on the Lord and Lady. "The two of you..." Gu Shunzhi was surprised - he was actually unable to read their minds. He could read anyone's mind with the "Mind-Reading Ability," but the Lord's and Lady's minds were unexpectedly blank.</p>

    <p>Given their fighting strength, he could crush them like ants without breaking a sweat, so it was unlikely that they could put up any resistance themselves.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi felt that it was probably because these two were thinking about something prohibited, thus preventing him from reading their minds.</p>

    <p>Could it be that they were thinking about Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi?</p>

    <p>But given their current strength, they weren't a threat to him at all...</p>

    <p>As a keeper of order from the future, he should be far more powerful than anyone in this current era, including his own father Gu Cheng.</p>

    <p>But what was this?</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi found it very strange.</p>

    <p>Could there be something like a blind spot in this world?</p>

    <p>Watching Gu Shunzhi's expression grow increasingly gloomy, the Lord and Lady both broke out in a cold sweat.</p>

    <p>They didn't even dare speak to each other telepathically for fear that Gu Shunzhi would catch hold of some information again.</p>

    <p>A moment later, the Lord gave the Lady a meaningful glance. "Just a moment, Mr Gu. I'll have the Lady get the information."</p>

    <p>Naturally, there was no way he would hand over all the information on Immortal Toya. Part of it was fake - except for Immortal Toya's name and basic profile, the rest of the information was actually about Fang Xing's experiences.</p>

    <p>This was a contingency plan which the Office of Strategic Deception's intelligence team had come up with. If they encountered a problem that they really couldn't handle, they could launch this contingency plan.</p>

    <p>Deliver the fake information, then hand the case over to the goon squad... When the time was right, they would inform the goon squad.</p>

    <p>The Lord and Lady had already rehearsed this emergency operation countless times and could make the entire handover look very smooth; back then, Lord Diulei had specially asked Wang Ling's clone Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch to supervise them.</p>

    <p>The Lord and Lady could already hand over the false information without any distracting thoughts.</p>

    <p>Thus, when Gu Shunzhi read their minds this time, he didn't detect any abnormalities...</p>

    <p>"Wise choice." Gu Shunzhi nodded in satisfaction.</p>

    <p>"Mr Gu, please take this USB." The Lady offered him the USB with both hands.</p>

    <p>"Good."</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi nodded. Turning around, his entire figure turned into a ball of nothingness and vanished on the spot.</p>

    <p>"Finally, he's gone..."</p>

    <p>The Lord and Lady both heaved long sighs of relief.</p>

    <p>The Lady: "What should we do now?"</p>

    <p>"Inform the sect leader first. This person... is too dangerous..." The Lord gave the Tesseract on the table a look. "High quality materials like the Tesseract are regarded as priceless by many people. Long ago there was even an Almighty called Thanos who started a war over it..."</p>

    <p>"Thanos?"</p>

    <p>"Yes..." The Lord nodded. "He has a younger brother called Tyrant<sup>1</sup>."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A play on the Chinese word for Thanos 灭霸 and Tyrant一漏, which is also the title of another online novel ..)</dfn>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"This person actually took out the Tesseract to do a trade... what unfathomable power..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After obtaining the USB, Gu Shunzhi was still very concerned about the matter just now. He felt like he was missing something...</p>

    <p>There were still other experts in this world whom he didn't know about?</p>

    <p>After leaving the Lord of the Castle's building, he went somewhere...</p>

    <p>The Heavenly Dao Governing Committee.</p>

    <p>When Gu Shunzhi showed up, the six Great Heavenly Dao all looked at him.</p>

    <p>Keeper of order?</p>

    <p>Why had a keeper of order suddenly shown up here?</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi gazed at the Great Heavenly Dao. "Your Excellencies Heavenly Dao of the seventh universe, may I trouble you to investigate a person..."</p>

    <p>"Investigate a person? That's fine; please fill in the form first." As their representative, Strength Heavenly Dao nodded and threw out a golden scroll.</p>

    <p>"Since when is there a form that has to be filled out..." Gu Shunzhi was dazed. He didn't remember such a rule in the seventh universe in the future...</p>

    <p>"The rules of the Heavenly Dao Governing Committee in each of the ten universes vary. Each time period has different rules. You have to fill out a form if you want to investigate someone," Time Heavenly Dao answered.</p>

    <p>"I see... Then thank you, Your Excellencies Heavenly Dao..." Gu Shunzhi took the scroll with both hands and started to fill it out seriously.</p>

    <p>In the end, he stared blankly at the questions in it.</p>

    <p><em>Questionnaire survey question 1: Is your favorite snack crispy noodles?</em></p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi: "..."</p>

    <p><em>Questionnaire survey question 2: Which of the following is the correct way to eat a crispy noodle snack?</em></p>

    <p><em>One: crush it and sprinkle it with the seasoning in the sachet.</em></p>

    <p><em>Two: put it in hot water.</em></p>

    <p><em>Three: sprinkle it with indigowoad root.</em></p>

    <p><em>Four: wrap it in laver.</em></p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi: "..."</p>

    <p><em>Questionnaire survey question 3: If a crispy noodle snack and your girlfriend fall into the water, which one will you save first?</em></p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>There were a lot of questions - fully 999 of them...</p>

    <p>Of course, this was actually the Heavenly Dao deliberately stalling for time.</p>

    <p>Because Time Heavenly Dao already knew that the keeper of order was the very person Wang Ling was investigating, and seeing how suspiciously this person was behaving, the six Great Heavenly Dao unanimously decided to stall for time first.</p>

    <p>Thus, while Gu Shunzhi was answering the questions, all the six Great Heavenly Dao of the Heavenly Dao Governing Committee teleported to the spare meeting room, leaving their clones behind to deal with Gu Shunzhi.</p>

    <p>Strength Heavenly Dao: "Not good, this man actually came to us."</p>

    <p>Time Heavenly Dao: "As expected of a keeper of order. He's not pausing at all in filling out the questionnaire. The type of people who fill in questionnaires so quickly like this are often very scary. There are 999 questions in the questionnaire, but at this rate, we won't be able to stall for very long..."</p>

    <p>Soul Heavenly Dao: "What is the keeper of order's purpose for coming back here from the future?"</p>

    <p>Time Heavenly Dao: "Gu Shunzhi is the keeper of order who is in charge of three universes... We currently don't have the authority to investigate his purpose, but it definitely has something to do with His Excellency Ling... At this point, asking His Excellency Ling to make an appearance is our best choice."</p>

    <p>Life And Death Heavenly Dao: "In that case, what are we waiting for?"</p>

    <p>Strength Heavenly Dao nodded. "Hurry up and invite Buddha Wang Ling over!!!"</p>
