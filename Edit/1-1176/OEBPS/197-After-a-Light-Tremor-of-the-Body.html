  <h1>Chapter 197 After a Light Tremor of the Body... </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Dharmaraja's confidence wasn't unreasonable; a punch wrapped in the godly thunder inheritance, the holy relic, didn't just have tremendous destructive power — the most critical thing was that after the godly thunder entered the body, it would immediately numb the nerves if protective measures weren't taken. Indeed, there were very few people who could take a direct hit from the power of the godly thunder and remain standing.</p>

    <p>Of course, Dharmaraja's overall strength wasn't powerful, but given that he had the godly thunder inheritance, he couldn't be too careless. Lord Diulei himself had been overconfident previously, and after enduring a punch, he had been laid up in bed like a corpse for two whole days.</p>

    <p>"The last time, when I fought Lord Diulei, I only used sixty percent of the power of the godly thunder inheritance. I've long heard of Ling Zhenren's immense strength, which is why I'd already thought about this challenge earlier on." In the office, Dharmaraja bowed to Wang Ling again with an extremely earnest expression on his face.</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Immortal Toya finally understood. "You want Senior Ling to act as a target to test the might of the godly thunder?"</p>

    <p>"Three hundred years ago, it was confirmed that this holy relic would be passed down to me, and it took these three hundred years for me to fully inherit this the Thunder clan's sacred object. Then I found this type of job in the Xiao Family Compound... most regretfully, after all these years, I have yet to see with my own eyes how strong the full might of the godly thunder inheritance is."</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, Dharmaraja sighed a little regretfully. "As the last descendant of the Thunder clan, my one cherished wish is to see this power for myself during my lifetime; I will no longer have any regrets in this life then."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling fell into deep thought at Dharmaraja's words. This wasn't a simple matter for him; to stand still and let himself be punched without reacting to it would test his ability to control the ensuing backlash. The grass on the tomb of the Shadow Stream killer who had thrown a punch at him back then was probably tens of meters high now...</p>

    <p>But there were still some differences compared with that previous situation. At least he still had the Dao talisman seal which Wang Ming had made for him — this would be crucial in helping him to control the backlash. Next, all he needed to do was pay attention to his control during the battle and not injure Dharmaraja.</p>

    <p>So in the end, Wang Ling consented to Dharmaraja's request. Actually, he himself was curious about the holy relics handed down from the Great Battle Qi era.</p>

    <p>It had to be mentioned that many of the holy relics that had been passed down had already lost their effectiveness in this day and age.</p>

    <p>This was because the energy source for these holy relics was battle qi. The Xiao clan's Heavenly Flame, for example, was in fact a holy relic, but without battle qi, it had been reduced to just flashy fireworks and the fire specially used to cook the Xiao clan's barbecue. However, the Thunder clan's godly thunder inheritance was a little special; it had been created through the absorption of the energy of heaven and earth, especially during thundery weather, when the power of the inheritance would be automatically built up and its might would thus be increased.</p>

    <p>The reason why the Thunder clan's godly thunder inheritance had been successfully preserved compared with the other holy relics was because it had moved from depending on battle qi to relying on the spirit energy of heaven and earth as an energy source; due to the changes in time and environment, it had completed its own evolution.</p>

    <p>"Since Senior Ling has no objections, then I'll just watch the show. Dharmaraja, do you have a place we can use for this contest? You can't fight in this office, can you?" asked Immortal Toya.</p>

    <p>"I do, I do!" Dharmaraja quickly nodded.</p>

    <p>Following that, he used the community hotline to find a tour vehicle to take the other two people to an empty square.</p>

    <p>"This square is also a scenic spot that is currently still under maintenance, so outsiders can't come in here." Dharmaraja got out of the car and introduced the place to the two men. "This was the Xiao clan's family training ground during the Great Battle Qi era."</p>

    <p>Saying this, he pointed to a small black dot five hundred meters away.</p>

    <p>Looking in the direction that Dharmaraja was pointing, Wang Ling realized that the "small black dot" was actually a black stone tablet. Its surface was already cracked and covered with moss, and even its base was wrapped in vines. It looked very old.</p>

    <p>"That is a test magic stone which the Xiao clan used in the past to test their disciples. It is also something we take particular care to safeguard in the Xiao Family Compound. It's covered by a protective film and is shaded to prevent corrosion from the elements," Lightning Dharmaraja said.</p>

    <p>"Can't you use the godly thunder inheritance to restore it?" asked Immortal Toya.</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja shook his head helplessly. "There isn't even the slightest bit of metal in this stone tablet; it's made completely out of jade, so the godly thunder inheritance wouldn't be of any use."</p>

    <p>So that was the case...</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya and Wang Ling nodded to themselves.</p>

    <p>Once Wang Ling was ready, Immortal Toya retreated to one side and left the whole square to Dharmaraja. From afar, he gave Wang Ling a cheer: "Senior Ling, good luck!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Dharmaraja faced each other in the middle of the square.</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja bowed to Wang Ling at a ninety degree angle before raising his head to look at him. He then put his goggles on.</p>

    <p>"Senior Ling, be careful..." The power of his godly thunder inheritance was almost instantaneous.</p>

    <p>Right after he said this, electricity burst sharply in his left hand with a sizzling sound, the light so dazzling it could truly pierce the eyes.</p>

    <p>Standing "out of bounds," Immortal Toya involuntarily shielded his eyes; the only thing he could perceive was that the whole square had become a blur as it was completely enveloped in a boundless white light.</p>

    <p>When the power of the godly thunder inheritance was immediately released, Wang Ling, who was standing opposite Dharmaraja, thought of the Solar Flare move<sup>1</sup>. But the light of the godly thunder inheritance was far more piercing compared with the Solar Flare. Nevertheless, this kind of flare had no effect on the ultimate Heavenly Eye.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The 'Solar Flare' is a technique used in 'Dragonball', &amp; is simply a flare of bright light which a person projects to blind their opponent)</dfn>

    <p>Dharmaraja was left-handed, and the godly thunder pulsed in his left hand seven times; he would be going with seventy percent of the holy relic's power from the beginning.</p>

    <p>He didn't dare use the fullest extent of his power straightaway; when he had just used sixty percent of it the last time, Lord Diulei hadn't been able to get out of bed for two days after being electrocuted.</p>

    <p>"Here I come!" Once the power of the godly thunder had reached the seventh level, Dharmaraja abruptly took one large stride forward and raised his left fist as he suddenly aimed a punch at Wang Ling's chest!</p>

    <p>Conversely, Wang Ling remained stock still.</p>

    <p>The blow was very powerful and it blew his fringe back, and even though it looked like nothing else had happened, Wang Ling was in fact doing his best to restrain his Golden Body and suppress the effects of the backlash.</p>

    <p>Wrapped in lightning, the godly thunder inheritance hit Wang Ling's chest precisely with a bang...</p>

    <p>When the lightning dispersed, Dharmaraja stared blankly at the boy in front of him.</p>

    <p>He could only say that this Ling Zhenren was stronger than he had thought! The seven-layer godly thunder inheritance didn't have even the slightest bit of effect on the other man! The legs of a regular person would have already turned to jelly earlier on from the lightning and caused them to collapse!</p>

    <p>In contrast, after the seven-layer godly thunder entered his body, the first thing that Wang Ling felt wasn't pain nor numbness... instead, it felt ticklish!</p>

    <p>To describe it simply: after a light tremor of the body, everything had become dull<sup>2</sup>...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is an allusion to a crude Chinese phrase used online which basically translates as "after a climaxes, everything becomes meaningless")</dfn>
