  <h1>Chapter 948 Strength Super Martial Arts Dojo</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The foundation was naturally very important when it came to cultivating body techniques, and Father Chen had a unique cultivation method, which was to rub trees.</p>

    <p>Quickly rubbing the palms over the rough tree bark could help both arms with strength training. One maintained a martial arts squat in this process, which also helped to inject a tiny amount of spirit qi into the dantian so that spirit qi could circulate on its own in the body. No supplementary medicines were required, and it would only take a few short years for one to reach the Qi Condensation stage from the Body Condensation stage.</p>

    <p>There were plenty of medicines on the market now to assist those under the Golden Core stage with their cultivation, and it wasn't like the Chen family couldn't afford them at all. However, the foundations of children who took these supplementary medicines in the end weren't as strong as those who progressed steadily and surely.</p>

    <p>Children with the same realm who relied on supplementary medicines clearly couldn't last as long in battle, and would feel tired not long after they started fighting.</p>

    <p>This was in fact the reason why more and more people chose to become mages now.</p>

    <p>Body techniques consumed too much energy, and kids who took supplementary medicines would lose after throwing a few punches.</p>

    <p>This also resulted in a vicious circle in modern preschool education. At some point, in the eyes of some kids, body techniques had already become outdated, making it seem like only people who could cast classy fireballs and water bombs were the true cultivators.</p>

    <p>"Dad... I can't do it..."</p>

    <p>During the first month of training, Chen Chao felt like he was going to die. His palms often bled from the rubbing, and some drops of that bright scarlet red blood fell to the snow-covered ground, slowly melting the snow with a sizzle.</p>

    <p>"Even though one is old, he may still be full of ambition<sup>1</sup>. Do you know what an old tree's network of roots signify?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(From Cao Cao's "Though the Tortoise Lives Long.")</dfn>

    <p>"Dad, are you telling me I have to lay a solid foundation?" Three-year-old Chen Chao didn't understand.</p>

    <p>"No. It means that when you're in trouble, you must never be afraid!"</p>

    <p>Father Chen shouted, "Charge, and take it down!"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "..."</p>

    <p>"Come, follow me! Keep rubbing the tree and take it down!" Father Chen was fired up.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao rubbed his palms on the bark, and it was so painful he almost cried.</p>

    <p>Father Chen directed him from behind: "One, two, three, four!... Two, two, three, four!... Keep it up!... Do it again!"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>And so, that year, three-year-old Chen Chao rubbed the tree day after day, and when he was four, he finally understood the profound meaning of Iron Sand Palm.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>While Chen Chao's childhood seemed uninteresting, in fact it was quite productive.</p>

    <p>Children in the cultivation world received enlightenment at an earlier age, and Chen Chao was already able to speak fluently at the age of three. This proved that his aptitude wasn't bad, and Father Chen obviously took this into consideration before deciding to help Chen Chao establish an early foundation.</p>

    <p>In the sea of memories, Wang Ling reached out and plucked out another silver-gray memory fragment.</p>

    <p>This was a dark-colored fragment, which meant that it was a heavy and unpleasant memory; it wasn't like most of the other fragments, which looked like colorful glass.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling held the fragment in his hand and slowly closed his eyes. This time, he decided to observe Chen Chao's world more closely...</p>

    <p>And so, in Chen Chao's memory world, a four-year-old girl named Wang Xiaoling appeared.</p>

    <p>This was a transformation created from combining the King's Eye with the Great Memory Spell, and was used to conceal one's identity.</p>

    <p>The "Wang Xiaoling" whom Wang Ling had turned into inside Chen Chao's memory did exist.</p>

    <p>Wang Xiaoling was originally an important part of Chen Chao's memory. In order not to affect the order of the memory world itself, the King's Eye turned Wang Ling into an image of this girl.</p>

    <p>It was a little like a first-person perspective and could help Wang Ling observe Chen Chao more closely.</p>

    <p>The silver-gray memory fragments represented the great changes and upheavals in one's life. Wang Ling transformed into Wang Xiaoling and observed this world through the eyes of a little girl. Instantly, the scene before his eyes grew bigger.</p>

    <p>Everything looked big and tall in a child's world.</p>

    <p>When he came to his senses, Wang Ling found himself surrounded by several children in a park.</p>

    <p>"Your mother is the woman who picks up the trash around here, isn't she? She comes to my house every day to collect broken glass. She's smelly and dirty, and so disgusting."</p>

    <p>The speaker was a fatty whom Wang Ling didn't recognize.</p>

    <p>But the girl in Chen Chao's memory knew him. Now that Wang Ling had become the girl, he also shared her memories.</p>

    <p>The fatty was called Tiger Liang and his family was very rich. His father, who ran a magic center for kids called Balance Center, was Chen Chao's father's business competitor.</p>

    <p>In this neighborhood, the more well-known schools were the Chen family's Strength Super Martial Arts Dojo and the Liang family's Balance Magic Center.</p>

    <p>In recent years, however, the Liang family's business had continued to prosper day by day, and the Chen family was almost drowned out by the former's fame.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't speak, because Wang Xiaoling was in fact a mute.</p>

    <p>But he had the little girl's memories, and could sense her fear.</p>

    <p>This made Wang Ling a little uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>Should he make a move...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was hesitant.</p>

    <p>He knew very well that he would change something if he made a move, and might change the world line of this memory... He remained silent, and decided to be patient for the time being and wait to see what would happen.</p>

    <p>What was more, there really was no point in arguing with a bunch of little brats.</p>

    <p>Everyone had silver-gray memory fragments in their lives, which symbolized a calamity that they had to endure; it was their fate to pass through this trial, and something they couldn't avoid.</p>

    <p>For example, when Wang Ling was six years old and Er Ha had fallen from the sky and pulverized the crispy noodle snacks flagship store, that had been a calamity...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling knew that if he forcibly changed things here, Chen Chao might run into even worse trouble in the future.</p>

    <p>Just then, a familiar voice suddenly rang out in Wang Ling's ears.</p>

    <p>It was Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>"Let go of that girl!" Chen Chao suddenly appeared in front of Wang Ling, his arms folded.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was in tune with the girl's memories, and at that moment, Chen Chao seemed like a hero who had fallen from the sky.</p>

    <p>"Little Brother Hu, this is Chen Chao from the Chen family. He doesn't look like he'll be easy to deal with."</p>

    <p>"That's right. Chen Chao has been practicing body techniques since he was three years old. I heard he's not half-bad."</p>

    <p>Tiger Liang was accompanied by two lackeys, who were both student members of the Balance Magic Center who viewed Tiger Liang as their leader. At the same time, they enjoyed course discounts as his flunkies; each person got up to a forty percent discount at most.</p>

    <p>Enrollment into the magic center was at an unprecedented high. To save money, parents would have their kids deliberately approach Tiger Liang, so the lackeys around Tiger Liang just continued to increase.</p>

    <p>"Chen Chao? From that Strength Super Martial Arts Dojo, right? Body techniques?"</p>

    <p>Tiger Liang laughed. He opened his palm and a ball of fire appeared in it. "Let's see if your body techniques or my fireballs are stronger!"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao took a deep breath, then walked over to stand in front of Tiger Liang and gaze at him. "Get lost, or I might destroy you with my palm."</p>

    <p>"Hahaha! You think you can do the Buddha Palm?! You're only four years old. What can you fight me with? An idiot plus a mute!" Tiger Liang laughed loudly.</p>

    <p><em>Thud!</em></p>

    <p>Without saying a word, Chen Chao struck Tiger Liang in the leg with his palm, so fast that Tiger Liang couldn't follow it.</p>

    <p>"I might not be able to do the Buddha Palm, but I'm still capable of the Iron Sand Palm." Chen Chao pulled his hand back.</p>

    <p>"Ahhh!"</p>

    <p>Tiger Liang yelled in pain and clutched his leg in a fluster.</p>

    <p>But he forgot to cancel his own Fireball Spell, and just like that, it exploded on his leg...</p>

    <p>That year, Chen Chao acted for the first time.</p>

    <p>He saved a girl with his body technique.</p>

    <p>That year, he was four years old.</p>
