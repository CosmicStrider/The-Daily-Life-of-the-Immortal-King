  <h1>Chapter 484 Mr Lu On the Way to Court Death </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Daoist Guang had always revered Wang Ling because since their first meeting, he had already known for certain that Wang Ling was a genuine immortal senior bigwig. Back then, he had brandished his roll of "Three Five" test papers and smashed the remaining demonic sword qi left behind by Evil Sword God's Heaven-Cleaving sword into pieces; until now, this scene was still fresh in Daoist Guang's memory.</p>

    <p>How could he ever catch up to this type of senior?</p>

    <p>Hence, he paid special attention to their three-person chat group as well as to Wang Ling's account. No matter how busy he was, as soon as there was activity in either of these, he would respond in the first instance.</p>

    <p>After seeing Lord Diulei and Wang Ling's messages, he couldn't help saying blankly, "Senior Ling's spirit beast did indeed contact me, but I thought Senior Ling already knew, so I made some arrangements..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>When he saw Daoist Guang's message, blue veins popped on his temple... This thing had actually learned to act first and report later!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei sent a facepalm emoji. "But the problem is that Brother Ling didn't know anything, Brother Guang!"</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang also sent the same emoji. "So... cancel it?" He knew that canceling this water friend match off the cuff would actually damage his popularity a fair bit. Even if he had a real talent for live streaming, this incident, which could be considered a live stream mishap, would definitely cause him to lose fans and he would easily become the butt of gossip.</p>

    <p>There were some live stream small fry on the live streaming platform who were keeping a close eye on him. These sour grapes would grasp at the slightest hint of gossip and dress it up in exaggerated words to tarnish his reputation.</p>

    <p>The thing live streamers were afraid of was a tarnished reputation, which was why Lord Island was always very careful on this point.</p>

    <p>This was the conclusion he had come to after seeing various cases online of live streamers being banned from all platforms.</p>

    <p>For an entertainment live streamer in particular, the quicker one became popular, the easier a target they became.</p>

    <p>This was why Daoist Guang felt that there had to be a control measure for entertainment! Furthermore, he had to spread positive energy to his audience during his daily live stream! Being funny was one thing, but he absolutely couldn't go too far.</p>

    <p>"Don't be hasty, Brother Guang, let's see what Brother Ling thinks."</p>

    <p>The chat group fell into silence, and Lord Diulei sighed and said, "By the way, does Brother Guang know why Brother Dog has suddenly started to play games? And with a friend as well? What kind of person is this friend?"</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang nodded; he had asked Er Ha the same question back then. "Both Ling Zhenren and Brother Thunder should be very familiar with this friend of Brother Dog's - it was Brother Dog and this youngster who exposed what the Demon Hunters Association were doing not long ago. His surname is Wei."</p>

    <p>"Oh! So it's him!"</p>

    <p>Realization suddenly dawned on Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>This had happened seven days ago. After Er Ha and Wei Zhi had reported the Demon Hunters Association's black market, Zhuo Yi had arrived with a large group of people and arrested Strong Zuo and his batch. As the first eyewitness and as a representative of the Pet Trainers Guild, Wei Zhi had joined forces with police to clean up the rest of the Demon Hunters Association's forces throughout the country.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei had posted on his own cultivation forum in order to get firsthand information.</p>

    <p>Actually, he had been at the scene when Zhuo Yi had interrogated Strong Zuo and his group and when Wei Zhi's witness statement had been recorded.</p>

    <p>In his entire statement, Wei Zhi had kept his lips firmly sealed about Er Ha and had shouldered all the responsibility.</p>

    <p>Back then, Zhuo Yi and Lord Diulei had thought that this person was pretty loyal.</p>

    <p>Remnant offshoots of the Demon Hunters Association were now spreading all kinds of threats against Wei Zhi. Lord Diulei noticed that these threats focused on Wei Zhi and there was no mention of Er Ha.</p>

    <p>In fact, Lord Diulei didn't know that long before Strong Zuo had been captured, Er Ha had actually already been targeted by the executive management of the Demon Hunters Association after Strong Zuo had put a soul marker on it.</p>

    <p>But things had actually taken a new turn; after Wang Ling had discovered the marker, he had simply transferred it to Xiao Yin.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Thus at that moment, tree goblin Mr Lu with the nickname "forest fairy," who was the servant of the Demon Hunters Association's President Bai, had found his way to the gate of Lord Diulei's villa. According to the GPS location provided by Mo Immortal Castle, that green-furred dog lived here.</p>

    <p>Mr Lu leaned on his walking stick. He wore a groomed and distinguished suit, and his white hair had been slicked back. He also wore an eye monocle, and from afar, he looked like a western nobleman.</p>

    <p>"The animal the Lady of the Castle was talking about lives here." Mr Lu took a deep breath and looked at the radar in his hand. This was something that had been developed through the Lady's great long-range data analysis in conjunction with Mo Immortal Castle's latest location technology: just following the pointer on the radar would lead to the target's specific position.</p>

    <p>According to the Lady, they had designed the radar's appearance as a special tribute to the dragon human race that had once existed in history; it looked like the compass which the dragon human race had created for the sake of finding the dragon balls.</p>

    <p>Mr Lu leaned on his walking stick as he headed toward the main entrance when the security guard stopped him. "Excuse me, sir, who are you looking for?"</p>

    <p>He looked at the security guard calmly and said unperturbed, "I'm the owner."</p>

    <p>The security guard was taken aback. "But sir.... why haven't I seen you before?"</p>

    <p>Mr Lu: "It's normal for you not to recognize me since I'm usually in the car. You're new, right? Why don't you call your leader over and see if he recognizes me." Mr Lu said this sonorously, as if he really did own several villas here, scaring this little guard stupid.</p>

    <p>The crucial point was that when this little guard saw Mr Lu's attire, the latter indeed brimmed with a noble air. Standing next to this person, the little guard for some reason felt that the air seemed a lot more refreshing... It was the carefree and relaxed feeling of breathing in oxygen in the highlands.</p>

    <p>This little guard was a little enchanted. "Ah... what's with this relaxing feeling?"</p>

    <p>Could it be...</p>

    <p>Was this the legendary noble temperament?</p>

    <p>Mr Lu: "..."</p>

    <p>This little guard didn't dare slight him and quickly pressed the button to open the smart gate. "It's fine, it's fine, Mr Lu, was it? Please come in!"</p>

    <p>There was no need for the leader to personally deal with this trivial matter; if this really was some neighborhood big shot whom the little guard left standing outside, when the time came, the blame would definitely fall on him!</p>

    <p>Mr Lu smiled faintly as he entered unhurriedly.</p>

    <p>People nowadays were so easy to fool.</p>

    <p>Why did standing next to him give the carefree and relaxed feeling of breathing in oxygen?</p>

    <p>You don't say!</p>

    <p>He was a tree goblin!</p>
