  <h1>Chapter 1172 Bound Man</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Every Shadow Image had its own name. A Shadow Image normally took human form since it represented the heart's desire - its abilities also evolved out of what the heart wanted.</p>

    <p>Bound Man.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling checked Bound Man's strength with his King's Eye.</p>

    <p>If Shadow Images were divided into ten power levels, Bound Man was at level six. Its advantages were its long hands and mature power. It was only at level six now, but if Wang Zhen made proper use of its power, it could still move up in the future.</p>

    <p>"Is this my Shadow Image? Why does it seem so vulgar?" Wang Zhen stared at the muscular man wrapped in rope and felt that this sight was a little unreal. He was such an upright person, but his Shadow Image actually looked like this... Moreover, the point was that Wang Zhen believed he had a normal sexual orientation... but why was his Shadow Image such a hunk with such thick muscles, and who was stouter than Kuxuan?</p>

    <p>"The person behind the scenes is on Nine Dragon Mountain somewhere. It'll be too obvious if I make a move. You're responsible for finding them." Wang Ling spoke telepathically to Wang Zhen. He had activated Wang Zhen's Shadow Image so that Wang Zhen could secretly search for the person's whereabouts. Wang Ling then brought Gao Tianming's puppet over and cast a spell called Great Apparition Spell on it.</p>

    <p>It was a real apparition that would confuse everyone.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling turned Gao Tianming's puppet into Wang Zhen's appearance. While it looked a little wooden, it was more than enough to pass for the real thing.</p>

    <p>"I'll leave it to you." Wang Ling then left with the puppet that had been transformed into the fake Wang Zhen.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen returned Wang Ling's meaningful look with one of his own. "Leave it to me, Ling Zhenren!"</p>

    <p>To guarantee the success of this operation, however, Wang Ling also arranged for two people to help Wang Zhen out.</p>

    <p>Thus, after Wang Zhen watched Wang Ling leave the barrier, Er Ha and Xiao Yin jumped out from the side, and had Wang Zhen quickly change into the special forces uniform.</p>

    <p>"Aren't you Ling Zhenren's..."</p>

    <p>Although Er Ha had already taken on a human form, Wang Zhen was still able to quickly recognize the person in front of him as Er Ha thanks to his emerald green-colored hair.</p>

    <p>"We received Master's command to come and help you find out who's behind this," Xiao Yin quickly replied. The most critical thing now was to uncover the person behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>Standing in front of Wang Zhen, he saw the Shadow Image behind him. "Is this your Shadow Image? It doesn't seem like you at all. So, your heart's desire is to be tied up?"</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen was instantly embarrassed. "It's a misunderstanding..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "There's no need to explain, we understand."</p>

    <p>With that, he also revealed his own Shadow Image.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had helped activate it remotely earlier.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin's Shadow Image was also the standard human form. It was a knight in thick leather armor with waist-length hair and dead fish eyes. But this knight's weapon wasn't a sword or a bow - instead, it was a collar around his neck...</p>

    <p>"So, the collar is a weapon?" Wang Zhen's lips twitched. He felt that Xiao Yin's Shadow Image wasn't much better than his, except for its slightly more normal-looking appearance. The point was that this was a collar! This indicated that Xiao Yin wanted to be collared!</p>

    <p>"I very much want someone - the best would be Master - to take me for a walk on the street." Xiao Yin declared what was in his heart. He had always longed for this, but most unfortunately, as one of the very few holy beasts left in the world, he had to abide by Wang Ling's principle of keeping a low profile.</p>

    <p>He didn't want to be slaughtered over rumors about the heart of a holy beast like pitiful Dog Saint, whose last remaining bone was refined into Bone King and fell into Er Ha's hands.</p>

    <p>The power of a Shadow Image was the symbol of the heart's desire.</p>

    <p>Hence, a knight with a collar around his neck couldn't be considered overly strange... Wang Zhen was just curious about its use in actual combat.</p>

    <p>"Let's go, then," Er Ha said at that moment.</p>

    <p>"Not going to show us yours?"</p>

    <p>"I'll leave it to your imagination."</p>

    <p>"This Gao Tianming is still unconscious - what should we do?"</p>

    <p>"It'll be fine once we leave the barrier. The screen in the command center will switch back to this place. Dharmaraja and Luo Chuang are currently acting it out, and the outcome of this battle will be Little Master Ling and Gao Tianming colliding to create a fierce explosion and knocking out everyone on Mist Peak..." Er Ha said.</p>

    <p>The script for this great battle was fixed and everything had already been neatly arranged beforehand.</p>

    <p>Thus, after Wang Zhen left with Er Ha and Xiao Yin, the protective talismans on everyone on Mist Peak was triggered. The protective golden lights shot up into the sky, and the teachers who were patrolling nearby rushed over.</p>

    <p>And so, the students from Number 1 Devil-Subduing High School as well as several other schools were declared eliminated...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Headmaster Li Qingxi had a vexed look on his face in the command center. It was only the second day, but one of the favorites, their Number 1 Devil-Subduing High School, was already no more?</p>

    <p>"Where's Wang Ling?! Why isn't Wang Ling there?" When the screen switched back to the real scene, Headmaster Li Qingxi shouted in agitation. He stared at the search and rescue operation that was happening on site as his eyes swept the scene for those dead fish eyes, but he couldn't find any trace of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Old Li, calm down." Next to him, Headmaster Chen smiled slightly. "Clearly, if Wang Ling isn't there, that means he was sent flying by the explosion, but his life wasn't in danger."</p>

    <p>"This is the top of Mist Peak! If he's sent flying into a cliff, how can his life not be in danger?!" Headmaster Li was fired up. He desperately hoped that Wang Ling was also eliminated, otherwise their Number 1 Devil-Subduing High School would completely lose face... They had formed an alliance with so many schools, but were actually directly wiped out by one person. It was just unimaginable...</p>

    <p>"Have you forgotten what Mist Peak's terrain is like?" Headmaster Chen theorized, "My guess is that Student Wang Ling must have been affected by Mist Peak's unique terrain after he was sent flying. When he was falling, he was buoyed up by a nearby air current, thereby slowing his descent and ultimately allowing him to land smoothly."</p>

    <p>"How can that be possible..." Li Qingxi said in disbelief.</p>

    <p>Was that the power of Number 60 High's mascot?</p>

    <p>Headmaster Li slumped down in his seat, and was unable to come back to his senses for a long while...</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen's words were soon confirmed by a side screen in the command center. When the image switched back to Number 60 High's camp, they could see that Wang Ling had already returned with Wang Zhen, who had gone missing earlier.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked a little dirty on screen - it was clear that he had just gone through a huge battle.</p>

    <p>Since he was putting on a show, then he had to see it through to the end.</p>

    <p>Of course, Wang Ling wasn't hurt. He had just used a spell called Great Dirty Spell to make himself dirty...</p>

    <p>This spell wasn't initially meant to be used for this purpose, but for making fine food.</p>

    <p>For example, dirty buns...</p>
