  <h1>Chapter 193 The Old Devil's Secret Space </h1>

  <div>

    <p>The Purple Gold Gourd's fog took the old devil directly back to the space he had originally bound it to; it was a small world which he had first opened up a thousand years ago, and the place where the Gua Pi Army had originally been set up.</p>

    <p>The old devil had just landed here, and lay prone on the ground as he gasped harshly.</p>

    <p>That had been too dangerous just now!</p>

    <p>He didn't doubt in the slightest that if he hadn't had this purple gold fog as a means of quick escape, he would have been beaten to death by the other party!</p>

    <p>Apart from those two lumps of mass destruction on his chest which he couldn't adapt to for the moment, his compatibility with Jiang Liuyue's body was pretty good. The only drawback was that he couldn't use his full strength in this body. He would have to think of a way to find a body that would help him regain his full strength as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>"How much do you know about that Killer Taoist?" After the old devil had taken a moment to calm down, he stared at the stone ghost mask in his hand as he asked the question.</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue's voice came from the mask: "I haven't seen this person before, but he's very powerful and hard to find. He only kills those who do evil; the more malevolent the person, the more tragic their death at his hand."</p>

    <p>"The more evil a person, the more unsightly his death?" The old devil laughed. Since the founding of Huaxiu nation, how many old devils had there been who could spread terror throughout the whole world? This was practically a letter of challenge addressed to him! Were they trying to provoke him?!</p>

    <p>"But I never expected the legendary Killer Taoist to be this formidable; he has even cultivated to the level of a Sage Body." Jiang Liuyue couldn't help sighing. "Even Lord Devil Emperor was almost defeated..."</p>

    <p>Devil Emperor Gua Pi's lips twitched. "Hehe, my venerable self was just too careless! Wait 'til I find the most compatible body; once I've recovered my full strength, do I need to mention how easy it would be for me to kill this Killer Taoist?"</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue didn't dare refute him. Through the stone ghost mask, she looked at the world around her. "Lord Devil Emperor, where are we?"</p>

    <p>"This is a small world which I opened up back then. Many people tend to use a magic treasure to set up a small world, the most common being a gourd. However, this small world isn't the same; it's based on alien space which is completely parallel to the real world."</p>

    <p>The old devil pointed to a magic array behind him. "See this magic array? This is the exit out of this small world. We just need to step through it to return to reality. I remember that back then, I chose an extremely scenic location. Who knows what it'll look like now when we step out of here?"</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue was deeply astonished as she listened to Devil Emperor Gua Pi's introduction.</p>

    <p>This old devil had been sealed in the stone ghost mask for over a thousand years, which meant that this world had also remained untended to for over a thousand years. The life force of a small world was tied to its owner as a source of spirit energy. It was just common sense to assume that since the old devil had been sealed away for so long, this world should have long become a wasteland... but far out of Jiang Liuyue's expectations, this small world was still functioning as usual despite being uncared for.</p>

    <p>"Thanks to your body, I was able to activate the Purple Gold Gourd and return here. I hid a lot of magic treasures in this place; the time has finally come to put them to good use."</p>

    <p>The old devil laughed lightly as he carried the stone ghost mask with him. The world shook underfoot as he walked until he arrived at a place that looked like grassland. It was just that the color of the "grass" here was a little strange as it was all black.</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue felt like her horizons had been broadened. "Lord Devil Emperor, where are we?"</p>

    <p>"What we are standing on now is the boundary support. This is the foundation which holds up this small world. I specially built this world, and I used the head of a human troll from the Gate Between Worlds as the foundation to prop it up. Even when my venerable self had been sealed away, this human troll was still able to act as a secondary source of spirit energy."</p>

    <p>The old devil said, "The spirit energy in this small world is the most abundant in this place. You can continue cultivating the recovery technique here, and it will significantly reduce the time required to heal. It will also be beneficial for me if you can regain your full strength quickly, as I will then be able to stay in your body for a much longer period of time."</p>

    <p>"So we are now standing on top of this human troll?" Jiang Liuyue asked.</p>

    <p>"Yes, that's right. This black grass is its hair."</p>

    <p>The old devil nodded. "This human troll is already under my control and is my puppet."</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue: "Your boundary support is really special..."</p>

    <p>The old devil laughed lightly. "Hehe, rather than boundary support, I prefer another name."</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue: "What name?"</p>

    <p>The old devil: "Jinchuuriki <sup>1</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(In the series 'Naruto,' the jinchuuriki are individuals who have the tailed demons sealed inside their bodies.)</dfn>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was already late by the time Wang Ling returned from the convenience mart.</p>

    <p>In an unprecedented move, he sent Zhuo Yi a message.</p>

    <p>After Wang Ling had accepted this disciple, the latter hadn't seemed to be of any use. Today, however, he finally realized how he could use Zhuo Yi â€” he planned to get him to bail Third Saint out from the police station.</p>

    <p>After all, Third Saint had had nothing to do with the disappearance of the delivery employees; there was no reason for him to become a scapegoat for it.</p>

    <p>It wasn't long at all before Zhuo Yi called him back. Wang Ling picked up the phone, but before he had even opened his mouth, Zhuo Yi had started babbling incessantly, leaving no room for Wang Ling to speak even if he wanted to. " Shifu , don't worry. You're referring to that Brother Third Saint, right? I'll dispatch someone right away to negotiate his release... oh, by the way, shifu , will I get a reward if I succeed?"</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling opened his mouth and really wanted to say, I'll give you a 'mwah mwah,' how about that? But he felt that this was a little gay and didn't fit his cool image at all, so in the end he swallowed his words.</p>

    <p>Although Zhuo Yi didn't receive a reply, he wasn't about to give up. " Shifu , don't misunderstand. I don't want a material reward... I'd just like something particularly rousing, and which feels especially good without requiring too much effort so that I'm full of vigor everyday."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>After a short silence, Zhuo Yi realized that his phrasing could be even more easily misunderstood, so he corrected himself. " Shifu , don't misunderstand, I'm talking about martial techniques!"</p>

    <p>Later on, Wang Ling hung up the phone, and after some thought, he sent Zhuo Yi the latest set of eye exercises.</p>

    <p>This was the most recent set of eye exercises, which hadn't become the norm yet when Zhuo Yi had graduated from Number 60 High School; back then, they had still been using the local trial version...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It had to be said that Zhuo Yi was very quick and efficient in getting things done.</p>

    <p>It had only been half an hour after the phone call. When Wang Ling turned on the news, he saw Third Saint walking out of the police station surrounded by a group of reporters.</p>

    <p>To protect his privacy, his face on TV had been obscured by mosaic tiles.</p>

    <p>"Sir, is it possible to reveal details about the disappearance of these delivery employees? Some people believe that you are in fact an accessory to this crime, is that right? Is it only because of insufficient evidence that you were released?" a female reporter asked as she held a microphone in Third Saint's direction.</p>

    <p>Third Saint looked at the female reporter and said just two things: "1. It's completely fabricated. 2. I've already asked my lawyer to handle it <sup>2</sup> ."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This was Guo Jingming's reply after the popular author was accused by another male author in his publishing company of sexual harassment ..)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
