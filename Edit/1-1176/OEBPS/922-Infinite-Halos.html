  <h1>Chapter 922 Infinite Halos</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In a flash, more than thirty halos stacked up on top of each other like the Olympic rings, densely enveloping everyone in the aircraft.</p>

    <p>With so many magic halos, even if Chen Chao and the others were only Foundation Establishment high school students, their fighting strength couldn't be underestimated at that moment.</p>

    <p>Although Chen Chao had already anticipated this necessary boost before battle, he didn't expect this game to be so damn "human"- this was too many!</p>

    <p>"It looks like this game is still a trial version - it's more important to have fun..." Piloting the aircraft, Chen Chao's smile grew wider. He never expected this to actually be a game just for the heck of it.</p>

    <p>"It feels like I've become very strong!" Su Xiao looked incredulously at his hands.</p>

    <p>"There are so many boosts." Guo Hao also couldn't help sighing in admiration.</p>

    <p>This was simply like using ten aircraft carriers to attack a speedboat...</p>

    <p>"The main city district is up ahead. We're approaching Star Lord's Divine Palace." Guo Ping's voice rang out in the aircraft as Chen Chao smoothly steered the aircraft forward. No sooner had they entered the main city when they were chased by several lizard men riding wyverns, shouting in the language of Divine Dao Star. However, everyone could understand what was being said this time.</p>

    <p>The aircraft was equipped with an "Instant Translator" software program, which had also been designed by Guo Ping.</p>

    <p>"Warning! You are speeding illegally in the main city district! Stop right now to be inspected!" In front of them, a lizard man riding a wyvern raised a silver pike and pointed it at the aircraft, and a huge shock wave instantly blasted out of the tip.</p>

    <p>Steering the aircraft, Chen Chao dodged skillfully, and even did a top-class 360-degree turn in the air; no matter how the aircraft spun, it didn't wobble.</p>

    <p>Sitting in the back, Wang Ling thought that Chen Chao would make an expert immortal ship pilot.</p>

    <p>A massive golden palace appeared in front of them like a mountain. It stretched up into the clouds and glimmered with a boundless, elegant light. The stone pillars were engraved with characters no one had seen before. Divine chains hung down from the summit, keeping the entire palace firmly anchored to the ground like a tent.</p>

    <p>This was the most mind-boggling.</p>

    <p>Because such a large golden palace was actually floating in the air.</p>

    <p>As long as the divine chains were pulled around, Star Lord's Divine Palace could turn to face any direction.</p>

    <p>The lizard men in charge of intercepting them were unable to stop the aircraft. The blasts from their silver pikes barely hit the aircraft, and even those that did bounced back.</p>

    <p>Everyone inside the aircraft had BUFFs, which also affected the aircraft and gave it various types of halo effects.</p>

    <p>In front of the golden palace, lizard men flew into the sky. They looked very different from the minions who had tried to intercept them, and had dragon wings on their backs and tails; even their auras were completely different from those of the lizard men who rode wyverns.</p>

    <p>"These Earthlings truly have no principles, even daring to break into Star Lord's Divine Palace."</p>

    <p>"Star Lord has already locked up their strongest being with great magic; sooner or later, the Earth will belong to our Divine Dao Star, and the humans will soon be enslaved by our Divine Dragon clan - these people breaking in are just courting death. Their strongest being doesn't seem like much."</p>

    <p>"Then who is the strongest person in this aircraft?"</p>

    <p>"I heard that it's that girl with white hair. The other Earthlings are small fry that got dragged in."</p>

    <p>Everyone in the aircraft had halos on them; even the six senses of Foundation Establishment cultivators like Chen Chao were enhanced several times over. After the lizard officers' conversation, everyone's gazes instantly focused on them.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't even make a move, but these lizard officers were shaken in the sky by this enormous spiritual pressure.</p>

    <p>— How powerful was this deterring force?!</p>

    <p>The lizard officers fell to their knees and looked up at the sky.</p>

    <p>Every single one of them was stupefied.</p>

    <p>Something wasn't right!</p>

    <p>Star Lord had already assessed the white-haired girl's fighting strength; there was no way she was capable of this oppression.</p>

    <p>Godly power was a dozen times more concentrated than spirit power, which was also the reason why Su Xing had been unable to break through the godly power barrier previously. It was impossible to make a dent in it at all unless it was with a spell which surpassed the concentration of godly power.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling naturally had already discovered this fact.</p>

    <p>So from the very beginning, he was very calm.</p>

    <p>Because all he had to do was bring out even more concentrated spirit power.</p>

    <p>But this technique of compressing spirit power was something only Wang Ling could do. It required the spellcaster to exercise precise control over every spirit energy molecule full of spirit qi, and then compress them into a spirit power mass.</p>

    <p>General Yi's Palm Sword and the Old Devil's Chaos Ball were both spells that used highly concentrated spirit power, but they were nothing compared with Wang Ling's compression skills.</p>

    <p>Thus, after Wang Ling modified the concentration of spirit power, he covered everyone in the aircraft with halo after halo of highly concentrated spirit power — it took no more than an instant for nomological laws to collapse!</p>

    <p>All the lizard officers collapsed on the spot at this intense spiritual pressure. They were deeply affected by the "overwhelming gravity of being three catties heavier at every festival" halo, and the lizard officers were in disbelief when they had to strain to lift their eyelids - even all their eyelashes were drooping downward...</p>

    <p>"Trespassers in Star Lord's Divine Palace will be executed without mercy!" At that moment, a Divine Dragon lizard with golden scales arrived. He wore light armor and his manner was far more imposing than that of the lizard officers kneeling on the ground.</p>

    <p>"It's Left Protector of the Front Hall!" The hearts of the officers on the ground were lifted when they sensed this aura.</p>

    <p>Who was Left Protector of the Front Hall in Star Lord's Divine Palace? He was the gatekeeper who guarded the entire Divine Palace. As soon as he appeared, his aura swept over the battlefield and seemed to hold the power in check.</p>

    <p>Inside the aircraft, everyone "stared" at him.</p>

    <p>A few seconds later, an officer on the ground let out a scream and was knocked unconscious when Left Protector of the Front Hall fell from the air and smashed into him.</p>

    <p>On the ground, Left Protector of the Front Hall hid his face. This was so humiliating - he couldn't look cool for even three seconds.</p>

    <p>He had actually been unable to withstand the aura oppression of this group of Earthlings.</p>

    <p>"Let me see what kind of small fry is trying to break into Star Lord's Divine Palace!" At that moment, someone flew out from the palace.</p>

    <p>"It's Right Protector of the Front Hall!" The officers cheered up once again.</p>

    <p>"Right Protector is much stronger than I am! He can definitely handle this group of people!" Unable to stand up under the pressure on the ground, Left Protector was full of confidence.</p>

    <p>And then...</p>

    <p>This Right Protector was also "stared" at by the Earthlings in the aircraft, and he dropped as the pressure pushed him into the ground.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked down and saw that the most pitiful officers had been buried alive.</p>

    <p>And on top of them were Left Protector and Right Protector...</p>

    <p>"Tch! Fiend, where did you come from? I, Left Protector of the Middle Hall, will face you!" Another voice rang out in Star Lord's Divine Palace.</p>

    <p>"Fuck! Is there no end to this?!" Chen Chao slapped the steering wheel.</p>

    <p>The next moment, in order to prevent the author from writing anything else superfluous, Chen Chao piloted the aircraft into directly hitting the palace...</p>
