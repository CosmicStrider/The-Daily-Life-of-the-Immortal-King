  <h1>Chapter 1079 School Reopens</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Yet another person who wanted to learn from him... Wang Ling was silent. It was just the summer holiday, but there was no lack of people saying that they wanted to learn from him. First, it was Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi, and then Gu Shunzhi popped up later. Now, there was also Zhenyuan...</p>

    <p>He had no other choice; for the time being, he would just arrange for all of them to study at Number 60 High.</p>

    <p>After cleaning up the mess left by his little sister Wang Nuan, Wang Ling sent Zhuo Yi a text message and had him arrange for Zhenyuan's school admission. Although the transfer test which Wang Zhen and the others had taken was already over, Zhuo Yi could pull some strings to get Zhenyuan in. Of course, Wang Ling only had one request: try not to put Zhenyuan in his class...</p>

    <p>As everyone knew, cultivation schools didn't start at the same time as ordinary high schools.</p>

    <p>Finally, on November 4th, Number 60 High reopened.</p>

    <p>Thanks to the efforts of all the teachers in the second half of the summer break, the fragments of Number 60 High's Jade Scroll of School History was recovered before their application was submitted to the General Administration of 100 Cultivation Schools. Following the trending news that Number 60 High was applying to become a key city cultivation high school, the second semester of Senior One heralded new transfer students... There were two in Wang Ling's class alone...</p>

    <p>"I will now introduce everyone to two new students in our class. Let's welcome Student Gu and Student Zhen!" After Teacher Pan finished speaking, the whole class immediately broke out clapping.</p>

    <p>Student Gu was Gu Shunzhi, while Student Zhen was Zhenyuan... This was the fake identity which Zhuo Yi had created for Zhenyuan: Zhen Yuan, based on a homonym of Zhenyuan.</p>

    <p>Following the clapping, there were the sounds of quiet discussion.</p>

    <p>"Both of them are very handsome!"</p>

    <p>"You can tell with one glance that the one with glasses has to be a curve wrecker, while the one with red hair... Don't you think he looks like some idol?"</p>

    <p>Lin Xiaoyu stared at Gu Shunzhi and Zhenyuan on the dais unblinkingly... In her mind, she was already concocting an indescribable epic between the two men...</p>

    <p>A fujoshi's way of thinking was really scary...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling turned his eyes away indifferently and looked out the window.</p>

    <p>In the reflection on the glass, he could clearly see both Zhenyuan and Gu Shunzhi staring at him.</p>

    <p>Before each semester, Teacher Pan had a habit of making an example of someone in order to cow the others. This "example" label was clearly going to fall on Gu Shunzhi and Zhenyuan's heads.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan looked at Gu Shunzhi first. His hair was a decent length and he had a more relaxed dress style. Since the school hadn't yet had the time to allocate him a school uniform, this Student Gu deliberately chose to wear a blue sports outfit, which wasn't particularly out of place in Number 60 High's environment.</p>

    <p>Hm...</p>

    <p>But Gu Shunzhi was going to be the "example" used at the beginning of the semester, and Wang Ling had to salute Teacher Pan's ability to nitpick.</p>

    <p>"Student Gu, I know your performance in the transfer test was very good and you're first on the enrollment list for the entire school, but you still have to be humble, understand? Look at you - you're so tall that I don't even reach your shoulders! As a warm man, can't you show a little consideration for your teacher's feelings? There are also quite a number of girls in our class. As a good student, you need to put your best foot forward! Understand?"</p>

    <p>Old Pan's tone sounded as gentle as a spring breeze, but a lot of the students could actually tell that she didn't have anything to say, and so was deliberately nitpicking... Of course, Teacher Pan also had another objective, and that was to test the character of this "Student Gu."</p>

    <p>After all, newly transferred students were unfamiliar with the other students. As the teacher-in-charge, Teacher Pan naturally had to clearly determine what their personalities were like. Different situations required different response measures to enable the transfer students to quickly integrate into the larger collective class environment.</p>

    <p>In Teacher Pan's opinion, Gu Shunzhi's performance was truly perfect...</p>

    <p>"Alright, teacher, I understand." Gu Shunzhi gave a slight smile which was so gentle that Teacher Pan actually felt the blush of first love...</p>

    <p>"Go... go down then..." Teacher Pan was speechless, and pointed at the last seat in the middle row as she hurriedly got Gu Shunzhi to step down.</p>

    <p>This transfer student had a good disposition and character... This was really rare!</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan now wasn't worried about Gu Shunzhi at all; instead, she started to worry about the female students in the class... Such a child who was outstanding in all respects would definitely be the catalyst for "puppy love"! Views on love in the current cultivation world were more liberal: as long as it was a safe environment, there weren't that many rules and restrictions.</p>

    <p>But Old Pan was a more conservative person.</p>

    <p>And she also valued grades more.</p>

    <p>She didn't object to puppy love, but if it affected a student's grades, she would definitely put a stop to it.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan pondered this deep in her heart. It looked like she would have to keep an eye on the other students for a while.</p>

    <p>After she was done with Gu Shunzhi, Teacher Pan turned to look at Zhenyuan next to him.</p>

    <p>Compared with Gu Shunzhi, Teacher Pan's evaluation of Zhenyuan's image had straightaway dropped to below the passing score of 60...</p>

    <p>"Student Zhen, I know that your grades are also very good! You ranked second this time. But you should know that our school doesn't allow its students to dye their hair! And why do you have ear studs? A boy actually has more jewelry than I do?" Teacher Pan scolded him in front of everyone.</p>

    <p>Only then did Zhenyuan realize what was wrong with himself.</p>

    <p>He was so bent on learning from Wang Ling that he forgot he had already become a high school student in this environment. He had always had his red hair and was used to it, but it did look rather unconventional. As for the ear studs... they were the mystical "Studs in Ears" that Zhenyuan was also proud of. This was a formidable imprisonment magic artifact, and also a very useful magic treasure for defense.</p>

    <p>Realizing that he was wrong, Zhenyuan removed the ear studs of his own accord and then explained his hair to Teacher Pan. "Teacher, I'm really sorry... My hair is always red because of my fire cultivation arts. Even if I dye it black, it'll turn back to red overnight... This can't be considered dyed hair, right? But I know that my hairstyle might not be very suitable, so I'll get a haircut after school."</p>

    <p>"Because of cultivation arts?" Teacher Pan was skeptical.</p>

    <p>It could only be said that as a teaching pioneer in Number 60 High, Teacher Pan was in the end Teacher Pan. Given her many years of teaching experience, she immediately came up with an idea for Zhenyuan. "How about this, Student Zhen: you can directly shave your head so that you don't have to worry about hair color. Since our school is a large body, we naturally stress unity."</p>

    <p>The truth was that Teacher Pan's words weren't absolute. If Zhenyuan didn't want to do it, Teacher Pan could actually compromise. Previously, some students in the other classes got into massive rows with their parents and teachers over their hairstyles and ran away from home. Teacher Pan didn't want a repeat performance of that</p>

    <p>But Teacher Pan was surprised once again.</p>

    <p>She found it hard to imagine that this Student Zhen would actually have an unusually good nature as he hurriedly agreed with her. "Teacher Pan, don't worry, I'll sort it out after school today!"</p>

    <p>In the back row, Wang Ling felt deeply moved when he heard Zhenyuan's words.</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan and Gu Shunzhi were two men who stood at the top of the cultivation world.</p>

    <p>They were long unfazed by the affairs of the secular world... and long past the age of rebellion...</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling had just realized something.</p>

    <p>He realized that Gu Shunzhi and Zhenyuan's arrival seemed to have drawn most of the class's attention.</p>

    <p>His own sense of existence was thus diminished.</p>

    <p>Perhaps these two joining his class wasn't as bad as he had imagined.</p>
