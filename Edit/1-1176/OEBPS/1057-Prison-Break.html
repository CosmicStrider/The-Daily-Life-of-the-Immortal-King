  <h1>Chapter 1057 Prison Break</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling could feel how convenient it was to use Zhuo Yi's body inside the prison; Zhuo Yi was like a walking pass who could freely go anywhere. He didn't need to give Warden Liang special notice, not even to visit the special cells; it was fine to just inform the prison officers. This wasn't considered breaking regulations, since according to the official bulletins, it was Zhuo Yi who had arrested the Old Devil and the others. Thus, Zhuo Yi visiting them wasn't a cause for concern.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling decided to visit Father Zheng first.</p>

    <p>His grievances redressed, Father Zheng was naturally extremely relieved, and even accepted his imprisonment.</p>

    <p>The prison had already found work for Father Zheng; if he worked hard, he might be able to get out on a shortened sentence.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling found Father Zheng inside a prison factory, pouring talisman paper pulp into a machine. This was a talisman factory, where Father Zheng and the other labor reform prisoners worked to manufacture talisman paper.</p>

    <p>Talismans were a hard necessity in the cultivation world, with billions of talismans consumed every day. The bulk of talisman paper was used for "cleaning talismans," "purification talismans" and so on, which were used to tidy up the city and to filter out poisonous air particles, thereby keeping the city clean and giving the citizens blue skies. To keep up with this huge consumption, the production of talisman paper was very important.</p>

    <p>Thus, basically ninety percent of the talismans that were consumed daily were produced by prisoners in prisons all over the country working day and night. The manufacturing costs for cleaning talismans and so on were lower, so there was no need to use high quality paper. There was nothing better than slashing costs and protecting the environment; using a large processing plant and high quality talisman paper, conversely, was a little like using a sledgehammer to crack nuts.</p>

    <p>Of course, apart from producing talisman paper, Father Zheng had another task which was the most important, and that was drawing.</p>

    <p>Father Zheng currently had the highest realm in this factory, and he also had some experience in drawing talismans. Not only could he draw over a thousand simple talismans like the cleaning talisman, he could also teach the other inmates to do so. The prison could thus save substantially on needing to hire someone to draw the cleaning talismans.</p>

    <p>Not only did Father Zheng help the prison save money, he also gave the other prisoners a skill with which they could make a living. After they got out, they would definitely be able to find work. As long as they knew how to draw a cleaning talisman, they could join a talisman processing company and earn money. The pay wasn't high, but supporting themselves wouldn't be a problem. Furthermore, as long as you were willing to learn in the talisman processing company, you could try drawing more advanced talismans. After accumulating more experience in drawing talismans, you could be promoted.</p>

    <p>Warden Liang was naturally delighted with such an outcome, and it looked like the red flag that moved around the major prisons might once again come to rest at his Songhai First Prison.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling reached the factory, he saw Father Zheng from afar working earnestly.</p>

    <p>"Director Zhuo, do you want me to bring Zheng Tianqiang over for you?" one of the prison officers overseeing the factory asked.</p>

    <p>"Shifu, you just need to wave your hand." Zhuo Yi's voice rang out.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling did as Zhuo Yi said and gestured with his hand. The prison officer instantly understood its meaning and nodded at Zhuo Yi before withdrawing.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't approach Zheng Tianqiang too closely, since he was close enough to use his spiritual senses to search probe for information.</p>

    <p>Standing where he was, the information which Wang Ling obtained from Zheng Tianqiang made him frown deeply.</p>

    <p>It was obvious that Father Zheng's newly awakened power didn't belong to him, but was from an external party.</p>

    <p>This power was very similar to the shock wave that had been released by the fetus inside Mother Wang at the Wang family's small villa!</p>

    <p>Was it Ah Nuan who had bestowed this power on them...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't expect his little sister to be more powerful than he imagined.</p>

    <p>Mother Wang had been pregnant for less than a month, and already Ah Nuan had her own consciousness, and had even given power to outsiders... Moreover, this power might have been spread through that box of frozen dumplings.</p>

    <p>This was an unexpected outcome.</p>

    <p>His little sister was really naughty...</p>

    <p>But at least Wang Ling now knew how his little sister Wang Nuan had given this power to other people. Why had she used frozen dumplings? This was enough to prove that with her current strength, Ah Nuan wasn't able to grant the power directly, and could only use indirect methods to do so. For example, she could inject her own energy into a bag of frozen food, and the people who ate it would inherit this energy.</p>

    <p>Apart from that, Wang Ling discovered something else, which was that Father Zheng's and Wu Yuanji's powers both had something to do with shadow.</p>

    <p>It was as if their shadows had been given some sort of consciousness which was somehow connected to their bodies.</p>

    <p>This was precisely why Father Zheng and Wu Yuanji could use the power of shadow to travel through computer screens.</p>

    <p>But it was obvious that while the shadow was powerful, Father Zheng and Wu Yuanji had yet to be fully enlightened. They had been granted the power of shadow, but hadn't exhibited its true strength - using shadows to travel through screens was nothing more than a parlor trick.</p>

    <p>Just as Wang Ling was about to probe deeper with his spiritual senses, hidden killing intent drifted over from outside the prison.</p>

    <p>After a person from Shadow Stream destroyed a wall and escaped Songhai First Prison the last time, the surrounding high wall and barrier had been reinforced; not everyone could waltz into the prison as easily as Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>At that moment, someone was surveying Songhai First Prison from high ground.</p>

    <p>Bai Youquan's white robe flapped in the wind. "Everyone, our mission this time is to capture Zheng Tianqiang and Wu Yuanji alive."</p>

    <p>After returning from the Palace of Mirrors, the black shadow army had been waiting on the numbers for the fluctuation of Shadow all this time. They had dispatched forces to monitor Wang Ling's family at the villa, but completely hadn't expected the fluctuation to suddenly move and appear on Wu Yuanji and Zhen Tianqiang.</p>

    <p>Bai Youquan was utterly pleased at this discovery.</p>

    <p>As long as they could catch these two people, who had the fluctuation of Shadow on them, there was hope for them to revive their forces. Unfortunately, Wu Yuanji and Zheng Tianqiang these two fools didn't know how to thoroughly activate this incredible power which they had obtained.</p>

    <p>Breaking prisoners out of jail -</p>

    <p>This was tantamount to starting a war.</p>

    <p>After halting operations for a long while following the Palace of Mirrors incident, the black shadow army had been waiting for a suitable opportunity all this time to declare their existence to the world.</p>

    <p>The chance had now arrived.</p>

    <p>"Shadow Brute, it's your turn to go up," Bai Youquan said lightly.</p>

    <p>A shadow giant five to six meters tall showed himself in the group. He stomped his foot and the ground trembled. Wrapped in black shadow from head to toe, he held a black shadow axe in each hand. At Bai Youquan's command, he lifted his axes and straightaway charged at the prison gate.</p>

    <p>The moment the shadow giant attacked the gate, Songhai First Prison's highest alarm level shattered the silence of the night in Songhai city.</p>
