  <h1>Chapter 879 Immortal Toya's Exquisite Pagoda</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The Great Skull-Flicking Spell was one of the Three Thousand Great Dao, which could forcibly put a stop to all skills - even a Heavenly Dao spell could be interrupted by this move. If a spell couldn't be stopped, that meant that the other party's strength far surpassed yours, or that you weren't proficient enough at the Great Skull-Flicking Spell.</p>

    <p>But neither of these two situations applied to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>It was just that he didn't pay attention to how much strength he was using, and it seemed that he flicked Lord Diulei's skull a little too hard...</p>

    <p>Em...</p>

    <p>It was true that it put a stop to Lord Diulei's ultimate move, but Wang Ling completely blew off his head...</p>

    <p>It was only when his body was reconstructed by the power of the Soul Suppression Ring that Lord Diulei realized that he had actually died... Thankfully, the power of the Soul Suppression Ring brought him back to life.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, Brother Ling was powerful...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was secretly terrified.</p>

    <p>He hadn't felt anything at all the instant he died; not the slightest bit of pain...</p>

    <p>This was something a person could do once their strength reached a particular level.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei's body was swiftly reconstructed after a few seconds.</p>

    <p>His body was restored. Jin Shi and Yin Shi had watched as Lord Diulei's head was blown up into fine dust, which returned to his body.</p>

    <p>The siblings didn't know what words to use to express what they were feeling at that moment, and could only gape.</p>

    <p>"Look, didn't I say that my master will save your <em>shifu </em>?" Brilliant Victory was completely unaware of Jin Shi and Yin Shi's shock, and instead thought that they were momentarily stunned with joy at their <em>shifu </em>being rescued.</p>

    <p>Brilliant Victory sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>In the end, these were juniors, who were unable to bear the mental strain.</p>

    <p>After he was resurrected, the first thing Lord Diulei did was to check Immortal Toya's injuries.</p>

    <p>He carried a panacea on him that could heal wounds quickly — the shen tui deng yan pill <sup>1</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The "stretch legs and widen eyes" pill.)</dfn>

    <p>The pill's main ingredient was an extract of Heavenly Dao broccoli. Lord Diulei had eaten it himself before, and it had a formidable and miraculous healing effect on injuries, especially internal ones.</p>

    <p>But Immortal Toya was unconscious and couldn't swallow it at all. If Lord Diulei had to force it in via CPR... that seemed a little gay...</p>

    <p>Besides, Jin Shi and Yin Shi were here — it wouldn't be good to do that in front of the kids!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei racked his brains for a bit.</p>

    <p>There was no other option...</p>

    <p>He ripped open Immortal Toya's clothes, directly placed the pill in the latter's belly button, and pushed it in.</p>

    <p>After a few seconds, Immortal Toya woke up.</p>

    <p>When the evil spirit entered his body, it had originally caused his soul great damage, but the shen tui deng yan pill just now had a miraculous effect and healed the damage to his soul.</p>

    <p>"Brother To? Are you okay?" Lord Diulei helped Immortal Toya sit up.</p>

    <p>"Yes..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya shook his head.</p>

    <p>His last memory was of the huge golden Buddha palm pushing the beam of light forward as it was about to fall on him.</p>

    <p>In that instant, he felt the terror of the evil spirit inside his body before it slipped away in a frenzy. When his soul returned to its rightful place as master of his body... he didn't know what happened after that.</p>

    <p>The moment his soul returned to his body was when he lost consciousness.</p>

    <p>But thankfully, after Immortal Toya woke up, he didn't feel out of sorts... except that his clothes had been torn to shreds...</p>

    <p>"It's all ruined..."</p>

    <p>Sitting on the ground, Immortal Toya sighed.</p>

    <p>Whether it was the heavenly silkworm precious clothes he was wearing or Chrysanthemum Island, they were both destroyed...</p>

    <p>His Chrysanthemum Island...</p>

    <p>Such a large island...</p>

    <p>With so many chrysanthemums...</p>

    <p>In an instant, they were all gone...</p>

    <p>"It will take a long time to rebuild everything!" Immortal Toya sighed.</p>

    <p>The chrysanthemum array on this island was something his ancestors had left behind, so he had to restore it.</p>

    <p>He didn't want to be nailed to the post of shame by later generations and cursed for being a wastrel.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, Brother To, I'll send some people to help you rebuild later. With Dharmaraja and Brother Luo around, Brother Dharmaraja's logistics team is always on hand," Lord Diulei said.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei never expected Chrysanthemum Island to be wrecked to this extent. It wouldn't be too much to say that the island had been utterly devastated, as if Pain <sup>2</sup> had invaded. The smell of smoke and chaos was everywhere. All this was because of that Devil Gut Fungus Lord and how strong the power of his infection was.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(A strong antagonist in "Naruto.")</dfn>

    <p>But both Immortal Toya and Lord Diulei were well aware —</p>

    <p>This wasn't the end of the matter.</p>

    <p>Because Devil Gut Fungus Lord wasn't dead yet and was still at large.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya stood up. Looking at the mess that Chrysanthemum Island was in, he trembled slightly, not because his Daoist robe was torn and he was cold, but because he was furious.</p>

    <p>"Senior Immortal... if it's possible..."</p>

    <p>"Brother To, even though I rescued you, it was actually Brother Ling. You don't have to give your heart to me..."</p>

    <p>"Senior Immortal, I'm being serious!"</p>

    <p>"Fine, go ahead..."</p>

    <p>"I want revenge. Can you leave that Devil Gut Fungus Lord to me?"</p>

    <p>"This Devil Gut Fungus Lord is very strong and cunning. At Brother To's current fighting strength, I'm afraid he won't be easy to handle," Lord Diulei sighed and said.</p>

    <p>"I understand." Immortal Toya nodded very seriously. "But, I still want to do it."</p>

    <p>As he spoke, Immortal Toya spread his palm and spirit light blossomed in his hand.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, a beautiful Chinese redbud appeared in his palm. It then blossomed to reveal an exquisite pagoda. However, this pagoda was damaged. Lord Diulei knew that this was Immortal Toya's clan heirloom — the Nine Cycles Exquisite Pagoda.</p>

    <p>"Does Brother To want to repair the Exquisite Pagoda?"</p>

    <p>"That's right — I believe it's time," Immortal Toya said. "The pagoda contains the secrets of our Toya clan, and these secrets will be a key factor in helping me advance in my arts later. It's a pity that the pagoda was damaged early on. I've been looking for the materials to repair the pagoda all this time, and I finally gathered all of them not long ago."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei sweated. "So, Brother To has been gathering the materials all this time?"</p>

    <p>He had heard before of the Exquisite Pagoda being damaged, but had never heard Immortal Toya mention it, so he had thought it was broken beyond repair.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya nodded. "Yes! I've been looking for the materials! All these years, I've been doing all I can to work and participate in operations in order to save money and buy all the materials I need to repair the pagoda."</p>

    <p>"Wait, Brother To..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei interrupted Immortal Toya. "Have... you ever asked Brother Ling?"</p>

    <p>"I was just about to. I heard that Ling Zhenren is brilliant at refining artifacts. I'm prepared to get down on my knees to beg him to help me repair the pagoda. After all, I only have one set of the materials."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "... Why don't you ask him now?"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "Now?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei shouted at the sky, "Brother Ling! I know you're watching!"</p>

    <p>No sooner had he said the words when a space fissure opened, and Wang Ling stretched out his hand once again...</p>

    <p>He simply stroked the top of Immortal Toya's Exquisite Pagoda...</p>

    <p>All the cracks in the Exquisite Pagoda disappeared.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Look, Brother To... you didn't need the materials at all..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya was stupefied. "This..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "So, Brother To, next time you have a problem, tell us first. If you don't say anything, how will you become a koi fish<sup>3</sup> ?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(I.e. Anyone can become a koi
fish, or have good luck, with
Wang Ling's help ..)</dfn>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "..."</p>
