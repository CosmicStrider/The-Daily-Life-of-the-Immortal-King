  <h1>Chapter 501 Showdown On Top of The Crane </h1>

  <div>

    <p>The moment he was killed with a headshot by WF, Lord Diulei's hands had already dropped from the keyboard.</p>

    <p>He had never ever expected WF to pick up that person's AWM from earlier and then promptly kill him with a headshot! This was the best sniper rifle in the game and it didn't matter if you were wearing a helmet - no matter how many helmets or much armor you were wearing, one shot was all it took to kill you.</p>

    <p>From this distance, even if Wang Ling wanted to provide reinforcement, he wouldn't make it.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was overwhelmed by a sense of uncontrollable despair.</p>

    <p>He had just wanted to show off a little in front of Wang Ling, but hadn't expected things to turn out the other way.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei sighed inwardly; It was so hard to play games nowadays...</p>

    <p>But he had to admit that this WF's skills were pretty good.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, you need to watch out. This person is probably aware of our location." Lord Diulei took his headphones off and spoke to Wang Ling next to him.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling grunted quietly.</p>

    <p>To be able to restrain Lord Diulei to this extent, provided it was without using a cheat, was ample proof that WF's level was very high. Although Lord Diulei claimed that he hadn't played this game in a very long time, during the period when frenzy over the game at been at its peak, he and Immortal Toya had burst into Huaxiu's top fifty chart while playing duo mode.</p>

    <p>This WF thus had to be ranked in the top fifty at the very least, and he was clearly an old hand who was intimately familiar with the map.</p>

    <p>Given the strength of his vision, Wang Ling could see tiny pixelated dots moving around on the map without needing to enhance his eyesight. But from start to finish, WF had never revealed his location; he took advantage of various blind spots and would switch covers to conceal his position.</p>

    <p>This was enough to demonstrate how superior he was.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling had felt all along that this WF was probably someone close to him...</p>

    <p>He narrowed his eyes slightly as he manipulated his character and quickly looked for another target within shooting range.</p>

    <p>On the other side was another team driving a jeep as they slowly entered firing range...</p>

    <p>He had just opened his scope and had yet to make a move when he promptly heard the crisp sound of a gunshot from afar.</p>

    <p>" <em>Bang </em>!"</p>

    <p>An AWM directly struck the jeep and it exploded on the spot.</p>

    <p>System: <em>Player "WF" has used "AWM" to kill players "Woshizhazhahui,""Woshiguitianle"...</em></p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Very good...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was now almost certain that this WF was definitely someone close to him and was very likely out to get him...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Following WF's crazy slaughter, more and more doubts emerged in Daoist Guang's live stream room.</p>

    <p>This was in fact normal; when a player's performance surpassed what regular people could understand, it was inevitable that most people would accuse him of using cheats. Previously, when Daoist Guang's live stream had just started to become popular, people had also had doubts about him. It wasn't until he had killed twenty people with a katana in one go while carrying a little brother that the doubts had noticeably decreased.</p>

    <p>When all was said and done, even those trolls hadn't seen such an operation before, and really hadn't known how to diss it...</p>

    <p>At that time, a super administrator from the cultivation live stream platform had specially come over to monitor Daoist Guang's live stream data and had found nothing unusual.</p>

    <p>Back then, the steady increase in Daoist Guang's fans and the continuous support from Light Chasers had been able to some extent to disrupt the trend of people with "good intentions" painstakingly claiming that Daoist Guang was cheating.</p>

    <p>Frankly speaking, whether he was cheating or not purely depended on whether the audience bought it or not...</p>

    <p>For someone who played so well, unless his identity matched his strength, most of the people watching would think he was no different from those immortals who cheated.</p>

    <p>"Lord Island, is that WF really not cheating? I just don't believe it!"</p>

    <p>"His ID is all over the public screen now."</p>

    <p>"Could this be some guru's side account?"</p>

    <p>Looking at the bullet messages, Daoist Guang felt that the situation wasn't right, and he asked Father Wang, "Brother Sleep, what does that anti-cheat brother of yours say?"</p>

    <p>"He's already checked this person out, and the data is all normal; he isn't using cheats. This anti-cheat system which my friend designed would have immediately detected aimbot and wallhack cheats," Father Wang replied with a smile.</p>

    <p>After all, it was Little Ming who had designed the anti-cheat software.</p>

    <p>Who was he... he was the most powerful brain in the nation!</p>

    <p>No matter how excellent their marksmanship was, many live streamers nowadays chose to use wallhack cheats so that their games would be more entertaining to watch. This helped them to detect as many enemies as possible as well as to acquire the supplies they needed.</p>

    <p>A wallhack cheat was the most difficult one to detect. Nowadays, live streamers with money could choose to use split screens, and viewers watching the live stream wouldn't be able to detect anything unusual at all.</p>

    <p>Software that could detect a wallhack cheat immediately could already be considered to be very advanced.</p>

    <p>Of course, almost no one doubted Father Wang's words.</p>

    <p>Because previously, Wang Ming had already used this anti-cheat punishment software to bring water friends back to life with the world-shaking "Samsara of Heavenly Life"... compared with this, being able to detect a wallhack cheat was a completely ordinary operation!</p>

    <p>At that point in time, Daoist Guang and Father Wang were crouched down in a small house outside the airfield on the edge of the safe zone. They planned to move after the next safe zone appeared, so had decided to squat here for a bit.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Daoist Guang heard the sound of the door opening downstairs. It was so loud that all the water fans in the live stream room heard it.</p>

    <p>They had company!</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang and Father Wang aimed their rifles at the corridor entrance. This person would die if he dared show his head.</p>

    <p>But his footsteps stopped at the top of the stairs.</p>

    <p>"Don't be nervous, it's me."</p>

    <p>Then, the water fans in the live stream room heard an unfamiliar voice.</p>

    <p>Little Ming?</p>

    <p>Hearing Wang Ming's voice, Father Wang let out a sigh of relief. "Lord Island, this is my friend who designed the anti-cheat software."</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang nodded his head and lowered his rifle. "Little brother, thanks for your trouble. Do you need anything? I have everything."</p>

    <p>"I'm fine, I'm fine."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming smiled. "When I punished those cheaters earlier, I picked up all their equipment."</p>

    <p>Water fans: "..."</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang: "..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "..."</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang: "Then that brother WF really isn't a cheater?"</p>

    <p>"Not at all, I've already checked him out. No game company or live stream platform has anti-cheat software as good as mine," said Wang Ming. "But I'm about to go face him."</p>

    <p>"Where is this brother?" asked Daoist Guang.</p>

    <p>"This brother moves very quickly, but I want to duel him here on the crane."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming replied promptly, an inscrutable smile on his face. "I know he's definitely watching Lord Island's live stream, which is why I specially came over to explain the situation to Lord Island."</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang: "Then little brother, your meaning is...?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "I hope Lord Island will come with me and broadcast our battle! Everyone, don't interfere! I just feel that this guy is too arrogant, and I'll represent everyone in venting their anger!"</p>

    <p>A live broadcast, huh...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling took a look at the live stream room; Wang Ming's voice hadn't surprised him at all.</p>

    <p>But very quickly, Wang Ming added: "There's another thing, and that is that I want to take this opportunity to display my skills for my silly little brother."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..." Motherfucker...</p>
