  <h1>Chapter 223 Will I Become the Strongest Moron?! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Even for ordinary dogs, their sense of smell was very sensitive. Science had shown that a dog's sense of smell was one thousand times more sensitive than that of a human.</p>

    <p>Since accepting the reality that it had become a dog, Er Ha's sense of smell had continued to improve. Logically speaking, a cultivator's five senses were a hundred times stronger than that of an average man, and given a cultivation dog's unique traits, Er Ha's sense of smell would be a thousand times stronger than that of a cultivator.</p>

    <p>Therefore, it could often smell bizarre things.</p>

    <p>In the Wang family's small villa, for example, even if it was in the yard, it could smell Mother Wang's perfume in her bedroom on the third floor, Father Wang's stinky socks in the study, and the smell of Wang Ling eating crispy noodle snacks in his bedroom.</p>

    <p>"It's definitely there."</p>

    <p>On top of a roof, Er Ha stared in the direction of the desert ruins.</p>

    <p>What was strange was that apart from Wang Ling, it could also smell a faint, vulgar scent... but it was sure that there was no way that this scent came from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Its little master was a clean freak!</p>

    <p>Er Ha wagged its tail and lightly jumped several dozen meters before madly scampering off in the direction of the ruins at a speed of several hundred meters per second.</p>

    <p>In the surrounding buildings, students sitting on hassocks and relying on the magnified power of their spiritual senses to perceive their surroundings all opened their eyes at this moment as if they had been woken up.</p>

    <p>"What's the matter?" asked a teammate.</p>

    <p>"I think I saw a green dog..."</p>

    <p>"Was it sent here accidentally?"</p>

    <p>"I don't think so." The student shook his head with a frightened look on his face.</p>

    <p>When he had used his spiritual senses just now, he had felt that that dog's jump had really been too high, and it was completely unlike a normal dog. Its speed had also been quite astonishing. Like a bolt of lightning, it had actually run out of his perception range in a split second.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the ruins, because of a poor decision, the ancient barter array's spirit took all of the things which Wang Ming had had on him in a huff.</p>

    <p>Half kneeling on the ground, Wang Ming apologized sincerely to the array spirit. "Ah, beautiful Miss Array Spirit! I was wrong! I shouldn't have impetuously made the wrong choice for the sake of my own selfish desires."</p>

    <p>Array spirit: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "But, Miss Array Spirit, don't you think that my choice corresponds exactly to the four most precious qualities which every human being has?"</p>

    <p>Array spirit: "?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "I don't skim when watching vids, which shows I'm steadfast. I don't get off while I'm watching, which shows I'm upright. I still don't get off once I've finished watching, which shows I have perseverance. And when I do get off, I can still continue watching after, which shows I'm persistent <sup>1</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Yes, this refers to Wang Ming watching X-rated videos.)</dfn>

    <p>"..." When Wang Ming finished speaking, Wang Ling and Chen Chao felt like they had been hit by a bolt from the blue.</p>

    <p>The array spirit took a deep breath and felt that there was no saving the man in front of her. "So... that's the reason why you chose the jade hassock?"</p>

    <p>The array spirit didn't dally too much with Wang Ming. She confiscated everything that he had obtained in the small world, but because the spirit talisman from General Yi and the employee radar system were state property, in the end he was able to keep these.</p>

    <p>This result was a great relief to him</p>

    <p>Fortunately, he still had the golden talisman.</p>

    <p>As long as he had the golden talisman, he could still continue acting high-and-mighty.</p>

    <p>For the first time, Wang Ling felt that this elder brother of his wasn't just an idiot... he also had no moral integrity!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>As they came out of the ancient temple, Wang Ming looked in the direction of the boundary support. Around twenty minutes had passed since they had entered the ancient temple, and the number in the air was still pretty much the same; there were still nine thousand and one hundred people left.</p>

    <p>"Now, should we still go to the city center?" Chen Chao felt his head hurt as he gazed in the direction of the city center. He had had an abundant harvest just now, but unexpectedly, he was back to square one because of Wang Ming!</p>

    <p>Most of the resources that he had collected before, such as the elixirs, the spirit talismans and so on, had all been confiscated by the array spirit.</p>

    <p>The only good news was that he still had the eighth-grade hassock and the Phoenix Cup.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao was rendered completely speechless.</p>

    <p>He had never thought that during this critical moment, an array spirit would accept a delivery <sup>2</sup> from them...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(A reminder that this means to
take someone else's inventory
in a game, usually after
they're dead ..)</dfn>

    <p>He had initially planned to fight it out in the city center with these supplies, but the situation now wasn't optimistic.</p>

    <p>The current situation proved that many people were waiting to spring an ambush in the city, and were unwilling to show themselves before then. If they went over there now, they would definitely be treated as a target.</p>

    <p>Given the situation, it could be said that the Phoenix Cup was their best hope now!</p>

    <p>But what on earth should they do?</p>

    <p>Chen Chao gripped his head, feeling a little frantic.</p>

    <p>"Don't panic, aren't Classmate Wang Ling and I still here? I heard that Classmate Wang Ling is our class mascot, I think we'll definitely be fine." Wang Ming grinned.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..." You're the mascot!</p>

    <p>Now that the situation wasn't very good, the three of them planned to wait for a while in the ruins, and then head for the city center the next time the toxic fog rolled in again.</p>

    <p>However, it wasn't long before Wang Ling suddenly noticed that their surroundings had actually started to become hazy.</p>

    <p>"Is this... haze?" Chen Chao rubbed his eyes.</p>

    <p>Just as he said this, his head turned heavy as lead, and he was instantly overcome as he lost consciousness and toppled over.</p>

    <p>In the blink of an eye, this brawny, one hundred and seventy- jin sports man fell into the arms of Wang Ming next to him.</p>

    <p>"There's something strange about this white haze!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming took out the golden talisman that General Yi had given him and saw that it was glowing.</p>

    <p>General Yi's golden talisman had protected him, otherwise he would have collapsed earlier on.</p>

    <p>The strange white haze had appeared very suddenly.</p>

    <p>The thing that frightened Wang Ming the most was that Chen Chao this tough fellow had straightaway fainted as soon as the white haze had showed up.</p>

    <p>The only thing he could be sure of was that this was definitely an abnormal phenomenon; after the first time that the toxic fog had come in, the people who had been laying low in the desert had already made for the city center much earlier on.</p>

    <p>The three of them were the only team left that was still in the desert.</p>

    <p>Without interference from external factors, the appearance of this white haze was extremely abnormal!</p>

    <p>"What the hell is going on, Ling?" Wang Ming was a little alarmed when he found that all of his electronics had stopped functioning in the white haze!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling got up and looked around calmly. Wang Ming could clearly see that his body was enveloped in a faint golden sheen.</p>

    <p>"Crap, crap, even the protective golden light has appeared. This haze is definitely poisonous!" Wang Ming was a little frightened. "Ling, if I inhale this haze, will I change from the strongest brain into the strongest moron?!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Without answering Wang Ming, Wang Ling closed his eyes and delicately felt out the white haze.</p>

    <p>As Wang Ming had said, the white haze's origin wasn't simple; it had the power to weaken a person. Forget a Foundation Establishment cultivator, even a Golden Core cultivator would be directly taken down.</p>

    <p>Most importantly, the white haze was so poisonous and so thick that Wang Ling wasn't able to disperse it directly. The air in the little world circulated in a loop; if he dispersed the haze with a wave of his hand, it would mix with the air, which would be disastrous for all the students!</p>

    <p>...There was only one option left.</p>

    <p>Looking at this strange white haze, the origin of which they didn't yet know, Wang Ling sucked in a very deep breath.</p>

    <p>In an instant, he sucked in floods and floods of this white haze through his nose and into his stomach...</p>

    <p>In the blink of an eye, the blue sky and white clouds returned, and the scene was tranquil once again.</p>
