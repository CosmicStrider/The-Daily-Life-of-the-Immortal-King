  <h1>Chapter 889 A Fall of Divine Liquid</h1>

  <div>

    <p>An enchanted bottle of 84 disinfectant?</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya accepted the divine artifact with both hands. His heart was unexpectedly unruffled; it seemed he was already used to it. Only Ling Zhenren could make an otherwise shocking operation seem very basic.</p>

    <p>The appearance of this bottle of disinfectant also shook Devil Gut Fungus Lord. In reality, Devil Gut Fungus Lord had already forgotten who his creator was, but the sudden appearance of this bottle of disinfectant gave him a feeling of familiarity.</p>

    <p>When Devil Gut Fungus Lord had still been a small bacterium, it hadn't developed spiritual wisdom yet and had no idea where it had come from. This thus made Devil Gut Fungus Lord think of itself as "a bacterium that had been born with a silver spoon in its mouth," and that it had been chosen by the heavens.</p>

    <p>But the instant this enchanted bottle of 84 Disinfectant appeared, Devil Gut Fungus Lord never expected that it had been enchanted to somehow resonate with himself, and his memory was stirred up at the same time.</p>

    <p>In his mind, the quiet and fair face of a youngster unexpectedly appeared.</p>

    <p>The youngster had short light hair and a languid expression, as if he was perpetually in a half-asleep state. He looked completely unthreatening - nothing more than a harmless teenager - but he gave Devil Gut Fungus Lord a huge shock and sense of crisis.</p>

    <p>This memory alone made Devil Gut Fungus Lord drip with cold sweat, and all his attacks were interrupted. The instant his thoughts paused, the ten million Immortal Bugs in the sky turned into a bunch of flies without a leader and began to tear into each other.</p>

    <p>Seeing this, Porcelaino quickly retreated some distance away, not daring to rush in willy-nilly again.</p>

    <p>He had almost lost his life earlier because he had been too aggressive and reckless!</p>

    <p>At the same time, his eyes were also focused on the bottle of disinfectant in Immortal Toya's hands.</p>

    <p>He was sure that it was because of this bottle of disinfectant that this fierce Devil Gut Fungus Lord had stopped his offense.</p>

    <p>Porcelaino: "Brother, what is this bottle of magic treasure that looks like disinfectant?"</p>

    <p>For a moment, Immortal Toya didn't know how to answer this question.</p>

    <p>Magic treasure that looked like disinfectant?</p>

    <p>No...</p>

    <p>This <em>was </em>a damn bottle of disinfectant! It sold for 29.88 HNY at the supermarket, and was the kind that was a two-for-one deal when it was on special...</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya glanced at the bottle's packaging. The large yellow characters "free gift" on it was exceptionally conspicuous.</p>

    <p>This enchanted bottle of disinfectant was a freebie to boot... Generally speaking, freebies were things that were about to expire, so they would be bundled into promotional giveaways.</p>

    <p>But now that it had passed through Ling Zhenren's hands, this bottle of disinfectant which had been about to expire had clearly reached the pinnacle of its liquid life.</p>

    <p>Huh...</p>

    <p>And it had also been touched by Ling Zhenren's beautiful hands...</p>

    <p>Staring at this bottle of disinfectant, Immortal Toya actually felt a trace of jealousy.</p>

    <p>"Impossible! Impossible!"</p>

    <p>On the other side, it seemed that Devil Gut Fungus Lord, whose memory had been triggered as he recalled his origins, couldn't accept the truth at all as he gripped his head and screamed.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya sighed. He had already flipped opened the lid of the bottle, and the pungent smell which was released caused Devil Gut Fungus Lord to feel even more pain. Even though Immortal Toya was clearly some distance away, the smell of the disinfectant already had an effect on Devil Gut Fungus Lord!</p>

    <p>"You're trying to kill me..."</p>

    <p>Devil Gut Fungus Lord clenched his teeth and rejected his origins with all his might. "I was born the strongest! I don't have a master! My power to devour is unmatched in the universe, and with time, I'll definitely become the supreme Devil Lord!"</p>

    <p>Devil Gut Fungus Lord yelled in a loud voice, "Powers of Outer Dao!"</p>

    <p>He condensed together all the three powers of Outer Dao that President Bai had collected.</p>

    <p>When the five major elements came together, they turned into an elemental glass armor which covered his body, with all kinds of dazzling lights overlapping each other. It was just like the cheap light effects which renminbi players spent lots on for their characters: they were cheap, but looked awesome.</p>

    <p>In addition, the power of Reverse Polarity also appeared in the form of a round Tai Chi disc, which was the symbol of Reverse Polarity, on Devil Gut Fungus Lord's glass armor.</p>

    <p>Porcelaino's face drained of color. "He is even capable of this Outer Dao?!" This was an Outer Dao that practically all cultivators yearned for. If you mastered this Outer Dao, it was like having the power to overturn the heavens and change fate! Even if you were on the verge of death, you could regain full health and be resurrected with this power.</p>

    <p>"Is that Mixiu Alliance? Stop the other hero cultivators from coming! They're not his match!" Porcelaino made a call.</p>

    <p>Porcelaino was very clear on the current situation. Against such an enemy, there was absolutely nothing the other hero cultivators could do; even he had almost been heavily crippled. Recklessly charging in without a plan was nothing more than coming all this way to court death.</p>

    <p>The situation right now was already messy enough!</p>

    <p>More people would only make things worse!</p>

    <p>Mixiu Alliance responded, "It's too late. The hero cultivators will reach the frontline in one minute..."</p>

    <p>Porcelaino clenched his teeth. "Wretch!"</p>

    <p>"One minute?"</p>

    <p>Listening to the conversation, Immortal Toya nodded.</p>

    <p>One minute was ample time.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, it was enough to punish Devil Gut Fungus Lord several times over.</p>

    <p>Porcelaino: "Little brother, let's withdraw! Your bottle of disinfectant is very strong, but what we're up against is the power of Outer Dao, Reverse Polarity - there's no way you can kill him!"</p>

    <p>"Not necessarily."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya shook his head.</p>

    <p>He poured out a drop of disinfectant, and just like the great Guanyin sprinkling sweet dew from the jade bottle <sup>1</sup> , Immortal Toya flicked that drop of disinfectant in Devil Gut Fungus Lord's direction.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(From "Journey to the West..")</dfn>

    <p><em>Bzz!</em></p>

    <p>This glittering drop of divine liquid emitted the most formidable spirit power and actually carried a touch of annihilation! Porcelaino was so scared his face turned pale!</p>

    <p>At the same time, the heaven and the earth changed color, and a huge vortex appeared in the air as the spirit power in this drop of disinfectant actually tore open the walls of the sky.</p>

    <p>Porcelaino's jaw dropped and his eyes almost popped out of their sockets!</p>

    <p>This...</p>

    <p>This was actually the spirit power in one damn drop of disinfectant? He felt that this one drop of disinfectant was dozens of times more powerful than him...</p>

    <p>No! This was no longer disinfectant! This drop was a one-of-a-kind super divine liquid!</p>

    <p>Sensing the danger in the divine liquid, Devil Gut Fungus Lord knew that he was powerless to withstand it. However, he had the power of Outer Dao Reverse Polarity, so he laughed wildly. "Want to kill me? I am an existence that cannot die or be killed!"</p>

    <p><em>Bzz!</em></p>

    <p>As soon as he spoke, the divine liquid exploded with energy once again, and a strong purifying power swept over the scene.</p>

    <p>The next moment, under Devil Gut Fungus Lord's extremely stupefied gaze, the elemental glass armor and Reverse Polarity round disc which he was wearing directly shattered on the spot.</p>

    <p>The power in this drop of disinfectant was above that of Outer Dao!</p>
