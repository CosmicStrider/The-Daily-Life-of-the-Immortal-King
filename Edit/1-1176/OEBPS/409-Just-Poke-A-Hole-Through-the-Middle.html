  <h1>Chapter 409 Just Poke A Hole Through the Middle </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was Lord Diulei's first time seeing the complete version of <em>Eight Classes of Divine Weapons </em>. It was indeed a very well-known atlas on refining weapons, but given how there were so many versions of it on the market, even if this copy got out, it wouldn't be considered strange at all.</p>

    <p>But a complete version was incredible.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei felt that it had to be some amazing senior fan who had given Father Wang this book, but after thinking about it again, he thought that it was pretty normal. Given Senior Wang's unfathomable realm, it was very normal for him to have fans who were big shots as well.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei felt that this was also indirect proof of how extraordinary Senior Wang's novel was!</p>

    <p>There definitely had to be some sort of cultivation philosophy in this new novel, otherwise how could it draw in that great senior, who had gifted Father Wang with the original <em>Eight Classes of Divine Weapons </em>?</p>

    <p>"How much of the information is intact inside this original text?" asked Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "There are some additions, but it actually isn't very complete. Compared with those reproductions on the market, the original has complete information on magic weapons that don't appear in the reproduced versions."</p>

    <p>As it spoke, Er Ha flipped through the book and quickly found the magic ring that Wang Ling wanted to forge. "Like this magic ring which Little Master Ling wants to forge, it doesn't appear in the copies outside."</p>

    <p>Looking at the atlas, this was a pure black ring that looked pretty ordinary, but it had a very intimidating name: Soul Suppression Ring.</p>

    <p>According to the description in <em>Eight Classes of Divine Weapons </em>, the Almighty who designed this magic ring had been inspired by the tribulation dreamscape.</p>

    <p>At the bottom of this description, it was written that the main material required for forging the Soul Suppression Ring was the magnetic stone.</p>

    <p>And then... there was nothing else...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei broke out in a sweat - this description was too short! The art of refining weapons was incredibly complicated; to refine one armed with just the knowledge of the main material required - there was no way it could succeed, right?</p>

    <p>But while Lord Diulei was thinking this, Wang Ling had already activated the Great Weapon-Refining Spell.</p>

    <p>After Wang Ling completed the hand seal, this floating ball of liquid metal started to spin at high speed, and then it exploded with a brilliant light!</p>

    <p>Roughly thirty seconds later, the glow faded.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei saw that the ball of liquid metal in the air had completely disappeared, and a series of black rings fell to the floor with clinks.</p>

    <p>"Hm, forging complete."</p>

    <p>With a nod, Wang Ling used the Gravitation Spell, and the magic rings on the ground flew into his hand one after one, ten rings in all.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei's lips twitched. "..." This was too quick a slap to the face! It was a good thing he hadn't said anything, or it would have been extremely embarrassing!</p>

    <p>To refine a weapon, the basic material was always the most important; any additional ones used were for helping to increase the success rate of refining the weapon. Thus, in a situation with a 99.99 percent success rate, as long as you knew what the principal material and the weapon design were, there was no need to consider the supplementary materials.</p>

    <p>This time, they had obtained ten rings in total, and the quality seemed pretty good.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's view on the Great Fortune Spell had now changed slightly. The reason why he hadn't used it often was that it could be too eye-catching; in any given situation, lucky people would forever be in the spotlight. But this time, he found that using the Great Fortune Spell in conjunction with refining weapons or elixirs could pull out the maximum effect!</p>

    <p>Without a buff from the Great Fortune Spell this time, the success rate and the quality would have been much lower.</p>

    <p>Gazing at the ten rings in his hand, Wang Ling estimated that the overall quality of nine of these Soul Suppression Rings were third-class... holy weapons.</p>

    <p>As for the last one...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's eyes lit up; he had never expected to actually be able to forge a Soul Suppression Ring of this quality.</p>

    <p>As expected, the effects of the Great Fortune Spell truly defied nature - under normal conditions and given the grade of the magnetic stone, there was less than a one in ten million chance of him forging a ring of this quality.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling didn't directly give voice to this thought, in case Lord Diulei was alarmed yet again.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, what's the quality of these rings like?" Lord Diulei suddenly asked at that moment.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling selected a second-class holy weapon-grade magic ring; he would use this Soul Suppression Ring as the medium to hold Taoist Guang's soul space.</p>

    <p>Then, he picked out that last magic ring with the best quality and directly tossed it to Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, this is...?" The young man in white looked overwhelmed when he received the ring.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling said indifferently, "For you."</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, this is too much! How can I take this?!" Even as he said the words, Lord Diulei directly put the ring on.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>The instant he put it on, Lord Diulei could feel a tremendous amount of spirit power! This magic ring was at the very least a holy weapon!</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling was the only one to know that this magic ring wasn't so simple. Even if smith specialists like Luo Chuang were to appraise it, they probably wouldn't be able to determine its value. That was because the ring's quality was already far beyond current measurement standards - the magic ring Wang Ling had given Lord Diulei could even save his life!</p>

    <p>To be frank, Lord Diulei had actually helped him a lot in the past.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling did have some understanding of the ways of the world. Luck had guided the creation of this magic ring, so giving it away to repay a favor could be considered karma.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, he had always planned to give Lord Diulei something, such as crispy noodle snacks... but that would be asking too much of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>After that, he placed the remaining eight rings in Lord Diulei's hands to give to the others in the chat group.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was incredibly excited. "Brother Ling, this is too much! Once the chat finds out, they'll definitely be very happy!"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Wang Ling lowered his head in silence before saying telepathically, "Don't tell them anything, just give them the rings..."</p>

    <p>Although Luo Chuang wasn't used to the chat and hadn't even joined the group, once the rings had been given out, he would definitely get wind of it. This was what Wang Ling was worried about, and with his reminder, Lord Diulei also recalled this point.</p>

    <p>That's right, just give them the rings... and say nothing...</p>

    <p>If Luo Chuang found out that Brother Ling had taken less than five minutes all up to forge these holy weapon-grade rings, he might straightaway bury his ancestral store and offer sacrifices to his ancestors...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei couldn't help sighing. "To tell you the truth, Brother Ling, this is the first time I've realized that refining weapons can be that easy."</p>

    <p>Er Ha said, "Actually, the key is what you're refining. With these magic rings, isn't it just a matter of poking holes through the middle? It's actually very easy."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei couldn't help laughing. "Brother Er Ha, there are too many things with holes... once you cultivate a human form, I'll buy you one."</p>

    <p>Some unsavory thoughts came to Wang Ling's mind. "..."</p>
