  <h1>Chapter 291 Get a Hold of Yourselves! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Because of the horrifying appearance of these two people, there was dead silence among the hundreds of female cultivators, including the elder in purple, for three whole minutes.</p>

    <p>At the sight of them, the female elder in purple sucked in a cold breath before turning to the slit-eyed female cultivator. "Ya Xuan... are these the Little Bamboo and Little Chrysanthemum who have put on weight?"</p>

    <p>The slit-eyed cultivator nodded earnestly. "Yes, shifu."</p>

    <p>After that, the face of this female elder in purple twitched for a long time. "..." They were more like chikuwa<sup>1</sup> that had been boiled for too long and an evolved Vileplume!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Japanese fish cake, 'chikuwa' literally translates into 'bamboo roll.')</dfn>

    <p>When Dharmaraja and Luo Chuang reached the top of the stairs, they could clearly feel the subtle tension in the air.</p>

    <p>"Brother Luo, have we been discovered?" The burning hot gazes around them, especially from that elder in purple on the platform, were like Usami-chan's ominous expression when she uncovered a criminal<sup>2</sup>.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Usami-chan is a rabbit girl in the series "gag manga biyori" who uncovers criminals with her sharp detective skills)</dfn>

    <p>Luo Chuang sighed lightly. "Damn! I thought our disguises were perfect!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>It was clear to Wang Ling now — these two King Kong Barbies<sup>3</sup> didn't have a hold of themselves at all.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(Basically a term for muscular women, especial from working out)</dfn>

    <p>In fact, if they hadn't appeared here, Wang Ling thought that he and Lord Diulei could have hidden in the troops for a bit. But the moment these two King Kong Barbies had shown up at the pavilion, his plan had already been ruined.</p>

    <p>"Evildoers, surrender!"</p>

    <p>The female elder in purple on the high platform waved one hand, and two rays of golden light flew out of her sleeve, transforming into a circle of scripture writing in the air that covered them like a cage.</p>

    <p>The slit-eyed female cultivator was shocked by her shifu's aggressive attack. "Shifu, what are you doing? They are our sisters!"</p>

    <p>The female elder in purple brusquely stretched out one hand to pat her on the head.</p>

    <p>"Are you an idiot?"</p>

    <p>The female elder sighed in her heart, thinking that she shouldn't have sent the slit-eyed female cultivator to the inner sect earlier as a messenger. Otherwise, they wouldn't have attracted these "small moths." Ya Xuan was undoubtedly the most powerful disciple in the inner sect, which was why the elder had taken her in as her inheriting disciple very early on — however, her one weakness was that she was a little foolish and blind!</p>

    <p>Given the urgent situation, she didn't have time to explain things properly, so she just sighed and simply said, "These two are the intruders. They probably changed into Little Bamboo and Little Chrysanthemum's clothes in order to take advantage of the situation and enter this place."</p>

    <p>It was only now that this slit-eyed female cultivator called Ya Xuan was struck with realization. "So it's like that!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>While the elder was explaining the situation to Ya Xuan, fighting was on the verge of breaking out, and things were already beginning to happen.</p>

    <p>Immortal Mansion's inner sect female cultivators all spread out to leave plenty of space for combat. They were well-trained, and even if battle could break out in an instant, there wasn't the slightest trace of panic.</p>

    <p>In this situation, the first thing to do was to move to an open space, in order to avoid being hit by magic attacks during battle.</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang and Dharmaraja naturally weren't in any way ordinary people. Although this female elder had struck swiftly, this trap wasn't stable enough to capture the both of them.</p>

    <p>Hiss!Dharmaraja chose to meet her head-on. He activated the godly thunder inheritance and shot it directly into the air. The scripture writing in the sky was instantly enveloped by the godly thunder before it gradually disintegrated.</p>

    <p>"Is this the legendary holy relic of the Thunder Clan?"</p>

    <p>The female elder had a stunned expression on her face. Although she had heard from Immortal Mansion's emergency announcement that the intruders were formidable, she had never expected that there would be a descendant of the Thunder Clan among them.</p>

    <p>Her preemptive strike hadn't had any effect. But except for the slight flicker in her expression when she had seen Dharmaraja's godly thunder inheritance, her gaze remained unruffled.</p>

    <p>"Are you a descendant of the Thunder Clan?" The female elder fixed her deep gaze on him. If Dharmaraja was around, then the other intruders definitely weren't ordinary people.</p>

    <p>She then shifted her gaze to Luo Chuang on the side. "Then... you are Luo Chuang? What a coincidence, our master would like a word with you."</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang laughed as he looked at the female elder on the high platform. "As luck would have it, I would also like a word with your master. He forcefully stole our Ling Zhenren's spirit sword, and I must settle this score with him."</p>

    <p>"Stole?"</p>

    <p>She eyed Luo Chuang. "That spirit sword clearly belongs to our master! You are trespassers in Immortal Mansion, and Master has already given the order that apart from you, all offenders are to be executed on the spot!"</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang was amused. "In all my years of hunting magic treasures, I've seen so many types of aggressive robbers, but I've never met one so shameless, stealing someone else's sword and saying that it was theirs to begin with. Since it's like this, then Brother Dharmaraja, let us meet them directly! No need to be polite about it!"</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja raised his hand, and it sparked with electricity — one hundred percent of the godly thunder inheritance! When he called it forth, the sky turned dark as black clouds instantly rolled in.</p>

    <p>Bang!A bolt of lightning from the sky struck Dharmaraja's body, and transformed into lightning armor.</p>

    <p>Some distance away, Wang Ling and Lord Diulei watched events unfold amidst a crowd of Immortal Mansion female disciples. They felt Dharmaraja was somehow a lot cooler in this form. Enhanced by the godly thunder inheritance, not only had his natural power evolved to take the form of lightning armor, it had also vitalized his muscles, making his body a lot more toned.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Luo Chuang had also stretched out his hand to take leather armor out of his vault and put it on.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had seen this armor before in Luo Chuang's metalware shop; it was the sky demon pigskin armor which he took so much pride in. Its short name was pigskin armor!</p>

    <p>Although Luo Chuang had already modified the spirit energy attribute of this pigskin armor, it still couldn't conceal the demon king aura of the sky demon pig. As soon as he took the armor out, the elder in purple standing on the platform became deeply interested in it. She could now better understand why Master was interested in this Boss Luo.</p>

    <p>"Brother Luo, be careful! These women aren't easy to deal with!"</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja frowned. From a general overview of their fighting strength, he and Luo Chuang were on the brink of the late Soul Formation stage, which would be enough to fight this group of inner sect disciples. However, the female elder in purple on the platform wasn't simple trash, and they would need to cooperate together when they confronted her.</p>

    <p>But the elder in purple wasn't stupid. With their current strength, Dharmaraja and Luo Chuang could crush any one of the inner sect disciples here — but if these disciples combined their strength, they wouldn't be so easy to deal with.</p>

    <p>With these hundreds of inner sect disciples gathered together, they could join hands to set up a powerful magic array which even an Itinerant Immortal would have trouble escaping!</p>

    <p>At this thought, the female elder couldn't hold back the excitement on her face. "On my command! Establish the array!"</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, not good!" Lord Diulei said in a low, alarmed voice.</p>

    <p>When the female elder shouted for them to establish the array, Wang Ling stepped forward.</p>

    <p>In that instant, time seemed to stand still...</p>

    <p>The next moment, many of the female disciples collapsed under the weight of an immense spiritual pressure.</p>

    <p>On the high platform, the female elder's face turned pale with fright.</p>

    <p>What had she just seen?</p>

    <p>Im... imperial aura?</p>
