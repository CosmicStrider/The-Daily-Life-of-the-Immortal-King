  <h1>Chapter 1013 Wang Ling, Do You Want A Brother Or A Sister?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>September 13th, the thirty-first day of the summer break.</p>

    <p>Today was destined to be an unusual day. Father Wang and Mother Wang had agreed on something and left in a hurry in the morning. Wang Ling guessed that the couple were making a stealthy visit to the hospital for a prenatal check-up... Actually, he had already known about the pregnancy earlier on after sensing a mystical telepathic connection. The problem, however, was that Father and Mother Wang still didn't know how to tell Wang Ling about it.</p>

    <p>After some consideration, the couple decided to hide the pregnancy for the time being. They didn't want to say anything, and Wang Ling naturally wouldn't force them...</p>

    <p>That wasn't in his nature.</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling thought it wasn't bad to have a younger brother or sister.</p>

    <p>The main problem was that Father and Mother Wang had too many misgivings!</p>

    <p>Their fondness for making up scenarios was an occupational disease for them to begin with...</p>

    <p>Father and Mother Wang originally wanted to brighten the atmosphere at home, but when all was said and done, they also cared about how Wang Ling felt.</p>

    <p>When a child suddenly learned that he was going to have a younger brother or sister, would there be a sense of loss? Would he think that his parents no longer loved him? If his parents didn't love their children equally, all sorts of problems might crop up in the future...</p>

    <p>Thus, Father and Mother Wang started to feel conflicted.</p>

    <p>They planned to find the right moment to tell Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>At the sea village, news of Mother Wang's pregnancy lifted the spirits of all the villagers. No one else was happier than Aunt Wang except Old Man Wang - and he was finally able to escape Aunt Wang's evil clutches when it came to the matchmaking interviews.</p>

    <p>In the last two days, the entire village had raised money to prepare tonics for Mother Wang, and Aunt Wang arranged to personally deliver them.</p>

    <p>As a matter of fact, it was shortly after Father and Mother Wang left the house that a large truck arrived at the gate of the Wang family's small villa directly from the sea village.</p>

    <p>The sound of the engine alarmed Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>When he opened the door, he saw Aunt Wang directing people to unload the truck. "That is a box of Calming Pills, and they're fragile; be careful when you unload them. If even one is damaged, you won't get anything for your work today! These are supplements for pregnant women which I specially ordered! And that box of Inspiration Pills - be careful!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Well...</p>

    <p>Father and Mother Wang still wanted to hide it from him, but Aunt Wang had spilled the beans...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling just acted as if he hadn't heard anything, and walked out of the house in a pair of flip-flops.</p>

    <p>Songhai was already very hot in September. Wang Ling was wearing a white short-sleeved shirt and blue beach shorts, which made him look fresh and cool.</p>

    <p>The blue and white ensemble wouldn't absorb heat easily, and Wang Ling had enchanted these clothes of his so that in blistering hot weather, they automatically gave off an ice-cold feeling, like a portable air conditioner.</p>

    <p>"Oh, it's Wang Ling! I haven't seen you in so long. You've gotten taller! And handsome, too! Wonderful!" When Aunt Wang saw Wang Ling open the door, she grabbed his snow-white arm firmly to pull him against her.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Fresh meat like Wang Ling were popular with aunties to begin with...</p>

    <p>Moreover, Wang Ling was also a member of the sea village.</p>

    <p>Although he lived in the city, the blood of the Wang clan still flowed through his veins.</p>

    <p>This was an undeniable fact.</p>

    <p>Also, Wang Ling's body was very cool now, and one couldn't help but draw near to him to dispel the summer heat.</p>

    <p>As the little brothers unloaded the goods and moved them into the Wang family's small villa, they deliberately walked past Wang Ling to take advantage of the cool breeze.</p>

    <p>"Everything's been unloaded, auntie..." After the little brothers were done, Aunt Wang carefully checked the goods against the inventory list, then took out a small silk pouch and put all the goods inside.</p>

    <p>Aunt Wang handed the pouch to Wang Ling. "Little Wang Ling, these are for your mother. When she comes back, please give them to her."</p>

    <p>"Mm..." Wang Ling nodded.</p>

    <p>"Also, please give this to your dad; make sure he perseveres, and hangs it up in his study!" At Aunt Wang's words, spirit light flashed in her hand and a silk banner appeared.</p>

    <p>The banner read: <em>Courage brings glory, reproduce a miracle!</em></p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Aunt Wang left even more quickly than she had arrived.</p>

    <p>She knew that Mother Wang had gone for a prenatal check-up today, so she wasn't in the mood to sit around and wait in the Wang family's small villa. After delivering the tonics, she energetically drove the truck directly to the hospital where Mother Wang was getting her prenatal check-up done.</p>

    <p>Father and Mother Wang were startled when Aunt Wang showed up at the door of the examination room at Songhai Cultivation Obstetrics And Gynecology Specialist Hospital.</p>

    <p>"Aunt Wang... why are you..." asked Father Wang.</p>

    <p>"It's nothing, I sent a truckload of tonics to your place earlier, so I dropped by to check on you."</p>

    <p>"Did... did you spill the beans?" Father Wang was worried.</p>

    <p>"No; Wang Ling that boy is so simple. He wouldn't notice anything," Aunt Wang assured them confidently.</p>

    <p>She then looked at Mother Wang and asked, "What's the situation?"</p>

    <p>"We're still waiting for the pregnancy report, but my wife and I got health check-ups not long ago. There's nothing wrong with either of us, and we're in good health." Father Wang smiled.</p>

    <p>Although both he and Mother Wang were only at the Body Refinement stage, they were still cultivators, albeit on the lowest rung...</p>

    <p>When it came to giving birth, one advantage which a cultivator had over an ordinary person was their age.</p>

    <p>There were cultivators with high realms who gave birth even when they were thousands of years old.</p>

    <p>Although Mother Wang was already over forty years old, she was still considered a young mother in the cultivation world, and it absolutely wasn't a problem for her to have a baby. Nevertheless, a prenatal check-up should still be carried out.</p>

    <p>A prenatal check-up for a pregnant cultivator meant examining the level of spiritual energy inside the body.</p>

    <p>A pregnant woman had a slightly higher spiritual energy level than an average person, so a pregnant female cultivator had to ensure that her spiritual energy was balanced, or there was a risk of her fetus exploding...</p>

    <p>At the same time, female cultivators were also charged different childbirth fees depending on their realms. Childbirth below the Nascent Soul stage was covered by medical insurance, while cultivators at the Nascent Soul stage or above paid more with every increase in realm.</p>

    <p>The Nascent Soul stage was a critical level to begin with: whether it was a natural birth or a Caesarean, technical expertise was involved.</p>

    <p>Obstetrics and gynecology hospitals often had cases where in order to save money, some Nascent Soul female cultivators gave birth on their own at home rather than go to a hospital.</p>

    <p>In the end, they gave birth to their nascent soul, leaving the child inside the belly...</p>

    <p>They then hurried to the hospital in a panic for remedial surgery.</p>

    <p>But Mother Wang was in good condition, and the operation for a Body Refinement cultivator wasn't too complicated. As long as her spiritual energy level during the prenatal check-up was normal, there was nothing to worry about.</p>

    <p>After another few minutes, a nurse handed them a file through the window of the examination room. "Mr Wang, your wife's report is out. Her spiritual energy level is normal, and there are no problems."</p>

    <p>"Thank you!" Father Wang was very happy.</p>

    <p>"Hahaha! I told you, the girls of our sea village all have strong bones!" Aunt Wang was also delighted. Looking at Father and Mother Wang, she said, "The two of you, when you go home tonight, you should think about how to break the news to Wang Ling. You'll have to do it sooner or later; I think it's better to do it earlier."</p>

    <p>"Mm." Father Wang nodded solemnly. "But... how should we bring it up?"</p>

    <p>Aunt Wang suggested, "Drop hints first, then make a clear announcement. Or you can ask little Wang Ling whether he would like a younger brother or sister!"</p>

    <p>So that night, the dinner Mother Wang prepared was as followed:</p>

    <p>The first dish was a chicken and mushroom stew, which contained two chickens...</p>

    <p>The second dish was braised chili crab. There was a male crab and a female crab...</p>

    <p>The third dish was scrambled eggs with hot pepper... and the eggs had double yolks...</p>
