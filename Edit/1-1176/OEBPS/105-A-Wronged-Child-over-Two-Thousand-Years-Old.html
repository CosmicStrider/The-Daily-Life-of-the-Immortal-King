  <h1>Chapter 105 A Wronged Child over Two Thousand Years Old </h1>

  <div>

    <p>The people who had previously taken part in the parent-teacher conference for Wang Ling were Grandfather Wang, Lie Mengmeng and fan readers of Father Wang who had volunteered to attend for the sake of novel updates... once Wang Ling had started junior high school, however, Father Wang had no longer bothered with the parent-teacher conference and had left it to him to sort it out.</p>

    <p>After he had heard the news about the parent-teacher conference, Wang Ling had already been thinking about who he could get to attend it.</p>

    <p>It had just so happened that Lord Diulei had come to the door himself.</p>

    <p>Staring at the parent-teacher conference notice, the man in white was lost in deep thought.</p>

    <p>As the owner of both the cultivation forum and the old cultivation forum friends chat group, Lord Diulei had been invited to a lot of meetings over the years, many of which had been banquets.</p>

    <p>By May of this year, for example, he had already attended the Love Charity Fireworks Conference organized by the Xiao Family Compound in support of children in poor mountainous areas who couldn't afford to buy their own immortal swords; he had attended his cousin Thunder Goddess's <sup>1</sup>birthday banquet, where he had been forced to perform his unique One Hundred Percent Catching Sharp Knives Barehanded skill; and he had participated in the Tai Chi Wrestling Appreciation Society meet as a Tai Chi Sect representative.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Thunder Goddess, or "diu lei lao mu" in pinyin, refers to the female Spitfire character in the multiplayer video game Dungeon Fighter Online. After her Awakening, she can throw grenades while she is airborne. As a side note, "diu lei lao mu" in Cantonese also means "fuck you .. ")</dfn>

    <p>Lord Diulei thought that he was a man who had already experienced much, had nothing to fear and had seen many things.</p>

    <p>However, his hands couldn't help shaking as he looked at the parent-teacher conference notice which Wang Ling had given to him.</p>

    <p>He was very depressed!</p>

    <p><em>I'm still young! An eligible bachelor! Why do I have to go to a parent-teacher conference?!</em></p>

    <p>Wang Ling patted Classmate Lei Mouren on the shoulder; he looked at this wronged child who was over two thousand years old and smiled sympathetically in anticipation of the arduous task ahead...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>As he was about to depart, Lord Diulei stood at the entrance of the Wang family's small villa, his gaze solemn. The night wind brushed through his beautiful hair and rustled his white clothes. He was about to bid farewell to this place, the holy land of his heart. The sadness he was feeling at this moment was similar to when he had watched the national flag being lowered on the school sports field after school as a child.</p>

    <p>"Little Lei, feel free to come by anytime," Mother Wang called from the door as she waved, interrupting the man's thoughts.</p>

    <p>"Senior, thank you for your hospitality!" Lord Diulei bowed deeply.</p>

    <p>"Please do excuse us. Ling Ling's grandfather is resting and his father is still typing, otherwise, we could have taken you part of the way to the station."</p>

    <p>"This junior wouldn't dare disturb Great Senior Wang's rest, nor when Senior Wang is busy. It's alright, I'm fine with anything."</p>

    <p>"In here are Ling Ling's mask and the broccoli from earlier. Ling Ling's already put the mask in the mold, and I've wrapped up the broccoli for you." A bag in one hand, Mother Wang smiled.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei took the bag with both hands. "Thank you, senior, you're too kind."</p>

    <p>"Take care, Little Lei. Be careful on your way home."</p>

    <p>"Mm, then I won't bother senior any longer. Brother Ling and I are brothers-in-arms; I've been looking for this mask for a very long time, and he has been generous enough to give it to me. I'll definitely come again another day to express my thanks!" After saying this, Lord Diulei bowed to Mother Wang once again and waited until the front door of the Wang family's small villa was shut. Then, bag in one hand, he slowly disappeared into the darkness of the desolated lane.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Standing at his bedroom window, Wang Ling watched Classmate Lei Mouren leave.</p>

    <p>He had been intimately familiar with the atmosphere around the Wang family's small villa since birth.</p>

    <p>He could immediately pick up on the slightest abnormality in the air.</p>

    <p>Landscape Manor had been keeping a close eye on the Wang family's small villa since the day Wang Ling had found the stone ghost mask online. This group of people thought they were being covert, but it was utterly impossible for them to escape his senses.</p>

    <p>He had purposely gotten Mother Wang to give the stone ghost mask away at the door of the villa in plain sight — it had felt like getting rid of a ticking time bomb.</p>

    <p>The eyes and the auras that had been monitoring the Wang family's small villa were quick to react as they instantly switched surveillance targets.</p>

    <p>The small road in front of the Wang family's small villa was called East Huang Road. Except for the bus that took this route to the bus stop closest to the Wang family's small villa and large trucks that sometimes delivered resources to neighboring towns, only a few cars and passerbys used this road.</p>

    <p>Walking alone on East Huang Road, Lord Diulei hadn't left the Wang family's small villa very far behind when he clearly sensed hostile auras following him.</p>

    <p>This feeling was too familiar...</p>

    <p>He was someone who had run into plenty life-and-death situations, and was highly experienced in hunting or being the hunted.</p>

    <p>"This bunch of people really did react the way Brother Ling had expected!" Lord Diulei couldn't help sighing in his heart.</p>

    <p>Earlier in the Wang family's small villa, Wang Ling had told him about the group of people from Landscape Manor.</p>

    <p>He had heard how Landscape Manor had visited the Wang family several times in the last few days in a bid to purchase the stone ghost mask at a very high price.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was by no means a fool, and naturally had guessed what Landscape Manor's objective was. Most of the people who were interested in this stone ghost mask were unscrupulous schemers who craved the power it was rumored to contain.</p>

    <p>This type of evil object hence could never ever be passed around so casually.</p>

    <p>Now that he had received the stone ghost mask from Wang Ling, Lord Diulei planned to find someone to investigate the mask's maker. There were very few craftsmen in the world with the skills to forge objects out of primordial black crystal. After all, this was the hardest metal in the universe! As long as he could find this craftsman, he should be able to obtain some clues about a possible other stone ghost mask.</p>

    <p>But before that...</p>

    <p>He had to get rid of the rats behind him first.</p>

    <p>This white-clothed figure wandering around on East Huang Road in the middle of the night slowed to a stop.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the man in white could clearly sense the three auras following him also come to a surprised halt.</p>

    <p>Hidden behind the curtain of the night, the three auras were clearly using concealment Dao talismans; if you turned to take a look, there would be no trace of a person at all, only a faint haze.</p>

    <p>One of the three men in this haze had an older and more mature look, and was indeed the director that had been sent by Landscape Manor. He was flanked by his two subordinates, one tall and one short — they were the two men in suits who had gone to the Wang family's small villa yesterday to negotiate.</p>

    <p>They had been watching the man in white in front of them closely, when he suddenly stopped walking and then turned his head slightly. His eyes were nothing special, but like a sharp blade they pierced straight through the faint haze to fix on the three men hidden in the dark.</p>

    <p>At that moment, the three men held their breaths and completely didn't dare move.</p>

    <p>"How... how is that possible?!" The director was sweating bullets.</p>

    <p>The concealment Dao talismans had been made by the Lord himself; only cultivators with Soul Formation realms or higher would be able to sense them!</p>

    <p>Who on earth was this man in white?!</p>
