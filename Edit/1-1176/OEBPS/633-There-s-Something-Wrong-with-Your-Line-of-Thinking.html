  <h1>Chapter 633 There's Something Wrong with Your Line of Thinking</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Elder Zuo Wu never ever expected President Bai to appear here. Furthermore, he was well aware that this wasn't the real President Bai, but his clone. Nevertheless, just a clone still made him feel the greatest pressure.</p>

    <p>This dark chamber which he had hidden the wax figurine in was a place he had bought in a high-end apartment building in the center of Songhai city. It was a basement which previously had actually been an underground supermarket.</p>

    <p>When Elder Zuo Wu found this place back then, there had been seals stuck all over the underground supermarket, and the real estate agent had been evasive about it. Frustrated that they couldn't find tenants or buyers, they had cut the rent and selling price three times in a row. Elder Zuo Wu didn't even check the place out before directly buying it.</p>

    <p>Not only was it cheap, what was more important was that it was extremely dark, making it exceptionally ideal for creating a dark chamber in which to hide the wax figurine puppet for the substitution. A lot of forbidden spells didn't just require human effort; the surroundings in which they were used were also very important. The geographical location of this dark chamber was a big factor in Elder Zuo Wu being able to instantly cast the spell to escape to this place.</p>

    <p>"What useless trash..."</p>

    <p>At that moment, Elder Zuo Wu was kneeling in the middle of the chamber with a defeated expression, blood still dripping from the corner of his mouth.</p>

    <p>In front of him was a skinny person with a deathly white face who was carrying a black umbrella - President Bai. Even if this was just a clone, that cold, light snort had still sounded like rolling thunder which shook the depths of Elder Zuo Wu's heart, and he promptly couldn't help bleeding from the seven orifices of his head.</p>

    <p>President Bai's cultivation was too high, far beyond what Elder Zuo Wu could imagine, and it overwhelmed him.</p>

    <p>Was this... the power of a True Immortal?</p>

    <p>Sure enough, every move he made was the most imposing...</p>

    <p>Standing next to the young man was a person whom Elder Zuo Wu had never seen before. The man wore a purple Daoist robe and heavy makeup on his face, and actually seemed to have a feminine allure... This was a very beautiful man.</p>

    <p>This man was also a clone. Elder Zuo Wu had never seen him before, but since he could stand beside President Bai like that, it showed that this man's status wasn't ordinary.</p>

    <p>"Ji Xing, what do you think?" President Bai said mildly as he called the man by name.</p>

    <p>"If he had used those six hundred flying swords right away, he could have beaten the other party even if he couldn't kill him," Ji Xing, the beautiful young man, answered, "so obviously, there's something wrong with Elder Zuo Wu's line of thinking."</p>

    <p>Elder Zuo clenched his teeth a little grudgingly.</p>

    <p>President Bai stared at this scene and frowned. "Zuo Wu, what do you have to say for yourself?"</p>

    <p>"There's an Almighty behind the other party who stretched out one hand to directly pull me out of the space; I couldn't do anything about it! President, please verify it for yourself! That isn't an enemy I can deal with." Elder Zuo Wu was very agitated when he said this. Because of his internal injury from the "Hand of Heaven" attack, and coupled with the pressure from President Bai, he was so stirred up that the qi and blood inside his body couldn't help flowing backward, and blood started to spurt uncontrollably from his nose again.</p>

    <p>The beautiful man named Ji Xing sneered. "Isn't this the result of you drawing out the fight? President Bai and I already guessed that there's an Almighty behind the other party, which is why President Bai bestowed six hundred invisible flying swords on you this time. But you? You probably wanted to save some for yourself for your own use later, right?"</p>

    <p>When Ji Xing said this, President Bai's face darkened. Zuo Wu had worked for him for many years, no less than Mr Lu. In the end, however, there was something wrong with his thinking, when all was said and done. President Bai felt that Elder Zuo Wu had gone too far; he actually hadn't seized the decisive opportunity to directly ambush and kill the other party neatly, but had only thought about his future interests.</p>

    <p>President Bai thus had an especially grim expression on his face. "Zuo Wu, you let me down."</p>

    <p>He clenched his fist so hard that there was the deafening crack of an explosion in the air, and Elder Zuo Wu jolted on the spot as he almost lost consciousness.</p>

    <p>Elder Zuo Wu was even more seriously injured...</p>

    <p>Even if he recovered later from this type of injury, it would leave behind severe residual effects. Worse still, if anything went wrong, his realm would likely be stuck at this level forever.</p>

    <p>"Zuo Wu..." The deathly pale young man stared at him with the expression of a torturer from hell. "In the many years that you've worked for me, I never treated you violently. But your mistake today was one you shouldn't have made. This is just a reprimand; for the time being, I'll spare your life."</p>

    <p>Elder Zuo Wu couldn't do anything about his bleeding seven orifices; he was completely drenched in sweat as his body trembled violently.</p>

    <p>After that, he saw President Bai directly turn his back on him and say indifferently, "Ji Xing, let's go..."</p>

    <p>The beautiful man next to President Bai didn't say anything, and only gave Elder Zuo Wu a pitying look before finally turning around and disappearing together with President Bai.</p>

    <p>It was as if the thunder calmed down after they left, and Elder Zuo Wu breathed a little easier.</p>

    <p>"Goddamnit..." Elder Zuo Wu thumped the ground painfully. He couldn't forget the look in the eyes of that beautiful man named "Ji Xing," who had regarded him like a pitiful creature before leaving. Although he hadn't shown any sort of expression, there had been a weighty sense of ridicule in his eyes, which had thoroughly shattered Elder Zuo Wu's pride.</p>

    <p>Elder Zuo Wu was very unhappy, but he couldn't refute it.</p>

    <p>Because everything the man had said was spot on.</p>

    <p>In that fight earlier, he indeed had selfishly wanted to keep some of the invisible flying swords for his own use later. But at the same time, Elder Zuo Wu hadn't expected such a powerful Almighty to be keeping watch behind the other party...</p>

    <p>He couldn't forget that hand that had pulled him out of the space. With exquisite skin and refined lines, it clearly belonged to a teenager, but it gave people a strong sense of the heavens pressing down, as if it had boundless ruling power.</p>

    <p>Elder Zuo Wu took a deep breath and forced himself to calm down and not think about it.</p>

    <p>What was more important right now was to treat his injuries.</p>

    <p>Since he had used the Puppet Substitution Spell, theoretically speaking, no one should know his whereabouts.</p>

    <p>No matter how strong that man was, he couldn't possibly figure out that he was hiding here, could he?</p>

    <p>Cursing in his heart, Elder Zuo Wu took out a jade bottle of fast-healing pills for use as emergency treatment, which could reduce the severity of internal injuries.</p>

    <p>But just as Elder Zuo Wu popped the pills into his mouth, the metal door of the supermarket was actually smashed open with a bang!</p>

    <p>Elder Zuo Wu was frightened into spitting out the fast-healing pills before he could swallow them.</p>

    <p>Then, he saw that silver-haired young person from before standing at the door and staring at him with a broad smile on his face.</p>
