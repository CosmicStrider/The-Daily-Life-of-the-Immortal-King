  <h1>Chapter 700 The Head of State's Infinite Spirit Field</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Father Wang had rich writing experience, but his writing wasn't perfect. He had always felt that fight scenes were his weak point since he had never specially observed a battle.</p>

    <p>This was such a rare opportunity for him to gather some truly reliable material to enrich his writing.</p>

    <p>"Truly a troublesome guy." General Yi, who had used the infinite sword repository to summon the Cold Frost Sword and cover himself in frost armor, frowned. The Cold Frost Sword was currently the most suitable magic sword to counter this stifling hot field, but he knew that he wouldn't be able to rely purely on this sword for too long.</p>

    <p>The other party was stronger than he was, and he could directly feel that the temperature in the field was still rising; thus, he had to destroy this field as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>"In my name as Blademaster, I'll cut open this field!" Taking a deep breath, General Yi imbued the Cold Frost Sword in his hand with boundless spirit energy, and in a split second, icy mist rolled out as the cold air surged forth to cover at least half the field!</p>

    <p>Father Wang was amazed at this scene, and then he saw this mist which had spread out actually begin to coalesce together again to swiftly turn into an ice-blue sword blade which cut through the air.</p>

    <p>The sword blade pierced the sky and spilt open the space as effortlessly as cutting tofu.</p>

    <p>It looked like it took nothing at all for the Cold Frost Sword to cut open the intrinsic field space.</p>

    <p>Father Wang tsked in wonder at this scene. "As expected of General Yi..."</p>

    <p>Not including Wang Ling, Father Wang recalled that in the most recent release of this year's power ranking list for Huaxiu cultivators, General Yi's overall strength had put him in the top ten.</p>

    <p>"You think this is the end, just like this?" The head of state laughed.</p>

    <p>Puzzled, Father Wang stared at the image broadcast. General Yi had indeed cut open the intrinsic spirit field with that one swing from his sword just now.</p>

    <p>Judging from the smile on his face, it was obvious that he was extremely confident in his sword strike just now.</p>

    <p>But in the next moment, General Yi's face gradually drained of color.</p>

    <p>Because he realized that he was still inside the intrinsic spirit field!</p>

    <p>This time, the scene was different as the number of suns in the sky had doubled to eighteen!</p>

    <p>"How can this be?" General Yi looked at this scene in disbelief.</p>

    <p>"In the end, Little Yiyi is still green..."</p>

    <p>In the study, the head of state gazed at this image and explained, "I've never used my intrinsic spirit field with Little Yiyi around before, so he doesn't know at all that this field is mine."</p>

    <p>Father Wang made notes on his computer as he listened seriously. "Do intrinsic spirit fields vary in their attributes?"</p>

    <p>"Of course."</p>

    <p>The head nodded. "As everyone knows, the intrinsic spirit field takes the form of a small world, and is also called an internal small world. After it's perfectly formed inside the body, it can be instantly discharged in battle. Furthermore, only the person who discharged the intrinsic spirit field can use the spirit energy contained inside it. That is to say, once you are caught and dragged into an intrinsic spirit field, you have to think of a way to break it open as soon as possible, otherwise once you've used up all your spirit energy, you'll be at a disadvantage.</p>

    <p>"The attribute which Brother Situ mentioned is probably what is called the spirit field's secret law, in technical terms. Every person's field has its own exclusive secret law that can usually be classified according to the five spiritual root elements. And while my field's secret law might look like fire, it is in fact an infinite ability."</p>

    <p>Father Wang earnestly gathered all this information together. "Infinite ability? Can Your Excellency elaborate on that?</p>

    <p>"Hm, Brother Situ can actually think of it like a Matryoshka doll."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"My intrinsic spirit field has nine layers in total. In order to break it open, you need to break apart all nine layers in one go before you can come out. What Little Yiyi cut open just now was only the innermost layer." Saying this, the head of state smiled slightly. "Little Yiyi is still green..."</p>

    <p>"If there are only nine layers, why is it called infinite?"</p>

    <p>"Simple, because the intrinsic spirit field can automatically restore itself."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"In other words, Little Yiyi has to hurry up and destroy the next eight layers. Otherwise, once the innermost layer that was destroyed just now is perfectly restored, it will wrap itself around the outermost layer. This, is the infinite ability."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>For some reason, Father Wang suddenly felt a little sorry for General Yi!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Just as the head of state had said, General Yi had never seen his intrinsic spirit field before and thus had no idea who was the enemy he was now fighting. Furthermore, it was the first time that the experienced and knowledgeable General Yi had seen an intrinsic spirit field with this "infinite" attribute, so he had completely no idea what he was facing.</p>

    <p>The second layer of the intrinsic spirit field was hotter than the first one, and the Cold Frost Sword wasn't as effective here. General Yi could already see drops of water forming along the Cold Frost Sword, which seemed to be melting.</p>

    <p>"Multi-layered intrinsic spirit field?"</p>

    <p>This was General Yi's initial guess, and while he wasn't completely right, to be able to make this connection in this situation was already very astute of him.</p>

    <p>At that moment in the study, the head of state suddenly turned to look at Father Wang. "Brother Situ, want to see Little Yiyi's most powerful sword? But it won't be easy to make him produce it; we'll have to provoke him first."</p>

    <p>"Sure!"</p>

    <p>Father Wang looked expectant. "But how will we do that?"</p>

    <p>It had to be known that for General Yi to be able to reach his realm, he basically didn't get angry or explode too easily. Provoking him would be difficult, second only to making Wang Ling smile...</p>

    <p>"No one knows Little Yiyi better than I do. I'll sort it out, Brother Situ, just watch."</p>

    <p>After saying that, the head of state opened his eyes, turned his gaze to the image broadcast and said softly to General Yi, who was in the intrinsic spirit field, "Scared?"</p>

    <p>In Father Wang's ears, it was a very light word, but inside the intrinsic spirit field, the sound was magnified endlessly. It was deafening, and General Yi couldn't help but cover his ears.</p>

    <p>The head of state changed the sound of his voice so that General Yi wouldn't be able to parse his true identity.</p>

    <p>"Your Excellency, who on earth are you?" General Yi asked the air in the second intrinsic spirit field after he regained his composure.</p>

    <p>The head of state: "You are not qualified to know who I am. I'm just warning you, if this goes on, you'll die for sure. So... want to surrender?"</p>

    <p>"You want me to surrender?" General Yi heaved a deep sigh.</p>

    <p>Since he had no idea what this intrinsic spirit field was like, he thought that it wasn't necessarily wrong to feign surrender for the moment... all was fair in war.</p>

    <p>As long as he could leave this place, he would be vigilant next time and it wouldn't be so easy for the other party to drag him into the intrinsic spirit field again.</p>

    <p>Just as General Yi was thinking this, the head of state's voice came through again. "I want you to yell 'I'm not the Blademaster' three times. If you do that, I'll set you free."</p>

    <p>Father Wang never expected General Yi's expression to abruptly change at these words.</p>

    <p>He saw General Yi's face quiver slightly as wisps of golden-red sword qi started to rise off his body; even his white spiky hair became awash in the same color.</p>

    <p>Father Wang was stunned. "..." What the hell?! Super Saiyan God?!</p>
