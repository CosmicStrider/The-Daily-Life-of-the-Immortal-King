  <h1>Chapter 608 A Monster in the Space Rift</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Previously, Er Ha had thought Demon Saint was very bizarre, but never thought that Shen Wuyue would be even more bizarre... Thinking about it logically, if you had no freedom or space, and your adjutant was constantly undermining you...</p>

    <p>Er Ha felt that it would go mad if it stayed here for long, let alone Demon Saint who was trapped by the restrictions of the Holy Pillar.</p>

    <p>"Sit down, please, seniors!" Completely different to Second Generation Demon Saint's expression, Shen Wuyue smiled like a fool, his smile more splendid than a lotus. His head was still bleeding violently.</p>

    <p>Then Shen Wuyue waved his head. "Hey! Rem and Ram <sup>1</sup> , bring the things over as usual."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The names of the twin characters in the light novel "Re: Zero - Starting Life in Another World.")</dfn>

    <p>Er Ha then saw two little puppet lolitas carrying a large basin each come over to the right and left of Shen Wuyue and start to use the basins to catch the blood pouring out of Shen Wuyue's head.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan: "..."</p>

    <p>Furthermore, these two basins weren't ordinary. Although Shen Wuyue's blood continued to fill the basins, they never overflowed.</p>

    <p>Shen Wuyue smiled. "I made quite a few of these types of basins precisely for use in this type of situation. Each time I have to cast a major spell, I have to pull the antlers out in order to use the energy stored in them. Although it isn't quite painful, it's fairly troublesome... So, Senior Dog and Immortal Zhenyuan, do you now know the reason why I normally don't like to go down to pick people up?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan: "..."</p>

    <p>The large amount of bleeding was one thing, but what Shen Wuyue this old man disliked mainly was how troublesome it was. So generally speaking, if the visitors they were receiving weren't important guests, Shen Wuyue wouldn't pull off his antlers so easily.</p>

    <p>The two little expressionless puppet servants held the basins very deftly as they caught Shen Wuyue's blood; it was clear that they were already very used to it.</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan was very baffled as he looked at Shen Wuyue and asked, "What do you do with the blood after collecting it?"</p>

    <p>Shen Wuyue: "Isn't that simple? Sell it to a hot pot restaurant!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha and Zhenyuan: "..."</p>

    <p>"Although my blood isn't as valuable as Demon Saint's, it's still deer blood, and can treat heart palpitations, insomnia and lower back pain." Speaking up to this point, Shen Wuyue had a reminiscent look on his face. "In fact, when the original Demon Saint first assumed office back then, our Holy Palace frequently lacked funds, so I often sold my deer blood to raise money for the activities of our Holy Palace... Of course, I was forced to do so..."</p>

    <p>"Forced?"</p>

    <p>"That's right! The original Demon Saint was extraordinarily Buddha-like. That attitude didn't just affect the Holy Palace's development, but extended to the frequent financial aid we give to poor demon citizens. All the taxes our Holy Palace receive goes toward the construction of the western area <sup>2</sup> ..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(A reference to China's policy for developing its western regions, the 'Great Western Development Program')</dfn>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Isn't there a western program these days? This was put forward by First Generation: as long as your academic performance is good enough and is at the level of a graduate student, you can go sign up. Last year, we had more than two thousand demon kings in the outer territories."</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan cocked an eyebrow. "Demon kings?"</p>

    <p>"That's right! If you're not a demon king, you can't get a diploma at all. Generally, only those who are demon kings can get a graduate diploma. Furthermore, not everyone can get into this western program. There are six rounds of interviews, which directly kills a large number of demon kings," Shen Wuyue said.</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan: "What are the benefits of joining this program?"</p>

    <p>"In addition to development, this is for the sake of making contributions to the demon world. We have an evaluation list of all the demon kings who have successfully gone west to support the construction there. Based on the value of their contributions, we can increase their clan points." Shen Wuyue smiled. "Although there are ninety-six outer territories of the demon race, these territories are also ranked. Every five years, the top three tribes in the outer territories are compared with the bottom three tribes in the middle territories, and tribes with powerful overall strength are promoted to the middle territories."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Er Ha was enlightened. It didn't know anything about this because back then in the Tuntian Ha clan, it hadn't been king for very long... Listening to Shen Wuyue now, it understood; it turned out that a tribe could be promoted.</p>

    <p>Er Ha realized that when Shen Wuyue mentioned this, Second Generation Demon Saint wore a deeply bitter and resentful look, as if someone owed him millions in cash.</p>

    <p>Then, Er Ha heard Shen Wuyue go on to say, "In fact, Lord Second Generation Demon Saint was a volunteer in the western construction. Furthermore, he took a Didi Shun Feng <sup>3</sup> demon car and was sexually harassed."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(A Chinese car-hailing app service. It was shut down for a while after a Didi driver murdered a female passenger ..)</dfn>

    <p>"..." Er Ha's and Zhenyuan's hearts couldn't take it! What?? Sexual harassment?! That pervert had such heavy taste!</p>

    <p>"And then?"</p>

    <p>"At that time, Second Generation Demon Saint was still a weak chick, but dealing with it took no time at all... he directly castrated the other party!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Coming back to the main point...</p>

    <p>"The western construction program has actually always existed; not only in the demon world, the human cultivation world also has something similar."</p>

    <p>Shen Wuyue paused and then said, "I'm bringing up the human cultivation world and the matter of construction in the demon world because the most important point has something to do with the topic of our discussion this time."</p>

    <p>When Shen Wuyue said this, Er Ha and Zhenyuan knew that the real issue was at hand.</p>

    <p>Shen Wuyue's head was still bleeding profusely, but his expression was completely different from before as it suddenly became serious. "What I want to say next is about the sustainable development of the human cultivation world and the demon world... seniors, I hope you will listen to me carefully."</p>

    <p>Er Ha raised its eyes. "Let's hear it."</p>

    <p>Shen Wuyue cast a glance at Second Generation Demon Saint, who then opened his mouth. "It's like this, Senior Dog, Senior Immortal Zhenyuan... Not long ago, Sage Master and I discovered a space rift in the demon world."</p>

    <p>When the space rift was mentioned, Immortal Zhenyuan's expression changed slightly... because over the years, he was in fact the one who had created so many rifts in the demon world.</p>

    <p>Before he had created the Gate Between Worlds, the spatial structure of the demon world had actually been very stable and there hadn't been any chance of a space rift appearing.</p>

    <p>Second Generation Demon Saint: "Seniors, you must know that since some goddamn human cultivator created the Gate Between Worlds, our demon world's spatial structure was messed up, and rifts will appear every now and then!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha and Zhenyuan: "..."</p>

    <p>What was the farthest distance between people?</p>

    <p><em>At that very moment, that goddamn person is sitting right in front of you, but you have no idea at all...</em></p>

    <p>Although he felt a little guilty, Zhenyuan didn't break his act as he struggled to keep calm so that no one could see even a hint of something unusual about him.</p>

    <p>"What's so special about these new space rifts?" Zhenyuan asked.</p>

    <p>"Mm, this is what I want to talk about. Sage Master and I thought before that it was because of fluctuations from the Gate Between Worlds that those new rifts were generated... But through our investigation, we discovered that these rifts weren't created by the Gate Between Worlds."</p>

    <p>"Not because of the Gate Between Worlds?"</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>Sage Master nodded his head. "Moreover, just as we were about to go through to investigate, a monster emerged from the rift..."</p>
