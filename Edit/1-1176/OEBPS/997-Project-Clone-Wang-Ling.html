  <h1>Chapter 997 Project Clone Wang Ling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Many thanks, Miss Liu and Brother Wang Zhen, for coming to help us!"</p>

    <p>"Senior Immortal, no need for thanks! Be careful, he's going to do something big!"</p>

    <p>As the fake Wang Ling started to gather power from where he was hovering in the air, the Nine-fold Star duo sensed strong killing intent, as if boundless spirit power was amassing in the imposter's body and gradually taking shape.</p>

    <p>An invisible wall of spirit power encircled the fake Wang Ling, blocking him from every attack. This was the "qi field phenomenon," which was a coalescence of spirit power and also said to be the ultimate protection. If they didn't break through this qi field, everything would be for naught.</p>

    <p>Sensing that things weren't good, Liu Qingyi promptly sent out the toughest secret weapon next to her - she grabbed Wang Zhen by his collar and flung him far out.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen, who had already experienced breaking through a barrier and passing through a spatial storm, unexpectedly cooperated at that moment. As the person who probably had the hardest head on Nine-fold Star, he was already braced to go all out.</p>

    <p>"Fools." The fake Wang Ling opened his eyes a slit; he thought nothing of this attack at all.</p>

    <p>"<em>Bang!</em>"</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi threw Wang Zhen like a shot put, but the latter bounced off the qi field.</p>

    <p>"It's useless." Female Fang Xing stood guard on the side. She couldn't help at all, but she knew that any attack would be in vain. This Wang Ling might be an imposter, but it was difficult for anyone to get close to him when the qi field was in place.</p>

    <p>Now, he had gathered almost enough power to use his ultimate move, and at that point, everyone here would die.</p>

    <p>Their mission was to kill everyone here.</p>

    <p>"King's Nuclear Bomb," Book of Sage Immortal said faintly.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi could sense the terrifying power even through Book of Sage Immortal's screen.</p>

    <p>So, this technique was called King's Nuclear Bomb?</p>

    <p>Book of Sage Immortal: "To be more precise, it should be Great King's Nuclear Bomb. However, since he's an imposter, he's not worthy of the title 'Great.'"</p>

    <p>"How powerful is this technique of <em>shifu</em>'s?" Zhuo Yi asked curiously.</p>

    <p>"Among all of my lord's Heavenly Dao spells, there are a few that can cause widespread destruction. But in the end, this is an imposter, who actually still needs to gather the power. My lord needs to do no such thing - he can instantly activate the spell with just a thought.</p>

    <p>"This move has enough power to destroy a planet, but looking at how much energy this imposter has accumulated, he seems to be planning to restrict the range of the power gathered to blowing up everyone inside the Office of Strategic Deception's barrier."</p>

    <p>Blowing up everyone inside...</p>

    <p>Could it be...??</p>

    <p>Along with the information which Book of Sage Immortal had shared on the Palace of Mirrors, Zhuo Yi suddenly thought of a possibility.</p>

    <p>"Mr Zhuo's guess is correct: it's likely that the other party's objective is to blow up Lord Diulei and the others, then arrange for them to be resurrected inside the Palace of Mirrors to serve the enemy."</p>

    <p>"But then what's the deal with my <em>shifu</em>?" Zhuo Yi was puzzled; he already understood the reason for the black shadow men's large-scale massacre of scientific researchers, but couldn't figure out why a fake <em>shifu</em> and Student Fang Xing had shown up.</p>

    <p>"Based on my overall analysis, there is a 94.89% chance that the matter is like so: the research institute has my lord's hair, which Mr Guo Ping assumed were energy strings, as well as Mr Fang Xing's DNA from when he was a baby. Because Mr Fang Xing is True Immortal She Pi's child, he was kept under observation at the institute for a period of time."</p>

    <p>Book of Sage Immortal drew a conclusion: "The only reason the other party would abduct Student Fang Xing as well as gather so many scientific researchers would be to resurrect True Immortal She Pi, and use him to lead the resurrected researchers in a cloning project. Those imposters of my lord and Student Fang Xing are the test results of cloning."</p>

    <p>Test results of cloning?</p>

    <p>Was the other side planning to clone a Ling Zhenren army?</p>

    <p>This possibility instantly made Zhuo Yi's hair stand on end.</p>

    <p>"Looking at this imposter of my lord, the other party's cloning technology is clearly still in the experimental phase. Whether in terms of capability or disposition, this clone is significantly different from my real lord. However, once they've developed a successful cloning method, terrible things will happen."</p>

    <p>Book of Sage Immortal came up with a conjecture as it spoke. "Once they've managed to clone my lord properly, in a short period of time, a large number of these clones will start to spread out from Earth as their base in a large-scale attack on the universe.</p>

    <p>"According to my calculations, there is a 99% chance that the clone army of my lord will first launch an attack on the Crispy Noodles Galaxy. This was something that happened when my lord was very young, and used a Heavenly Dao cloning spell and sent original flavor crispy noodle snacks into space. After all these years, the neverending cloning of these crispy noodle snacks wound up forming the Crispy Noodles Galaxy."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Furthermore, this galaxy has now become a resource which some aliens rely on to live. This is because the crispy noodles' ground pepper generates heat in the galaxy, causing it to shine like a fixed star in outer space. Thus, the Crispy Noodles Galaxy has given rise to many intelligent lifeforms."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>"They live on crispy noodles and harvest it to trade for supplies with other planets. So far, the Crispy Noodles Galaxy is the second largest economy in the universe behind Divine Dao Star."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi's mouth had already fallen open with how stunned he was. "..."</p>

    <p>"But my lord isn't too concerned about this matter. He spends too much energy on studying and keeping his grades down, and never thought that his unintentional act as a child would actually lead to the creation of new lifeforms in the universe. Additionally, because of his craving for different crispy noodle snack flavors, the original flavor has gradually faded from his life, which is also one of the reasons why he pays this matter no mind..."</p>

    <p>Book of Sage Immortal sighed. "Once a clone army of my lord appears, it will, without fail, swiftly take control of Earth and attack the Crispy Noodles Galaxy. Once the second largest economy in the universe collapses, Divine Dao Star will not be able to hold together the economic system of the entire universe."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>Book of Sage Immortal: "At that time, the collapse of the Crispy Noodles Galaxy will inevitably cause the universe to fall into dire straits and lead to famine as major planets run out of food.</p>

    <p>"And famine in turn will be the fuse which ignites war. These alien lifeforms will officially go to war in order to plunder resources, and many living things will die out as a result. In the end, the entire universe will declare war on Earth, which will be the inevitable beginning of an age of dimensional military expeditions. Furthermore, in order to suppress my lord, Earth will also be lost."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>
