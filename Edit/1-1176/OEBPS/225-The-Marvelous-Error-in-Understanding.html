  <h1>Chapter 225 The Marvelous Error in Understanding </h1>

  <div>

    <p>An array-guiding flag?</p>

    <p>Why was such a thing here?</p>

    <p>Wang Ming stared at the fluttering flag on the ground and looked a little bewildered. Any bystander whom he could have switched places with would undoubtedly also have felt the same confusion.</p>

    <p>That was because array-guiding flags had disappeared from the market a thousand years ago — they couldn't be purchased even on the black market. The production of this magic treasure had already been strictly prohibited for fear that criminals would take advantage of it.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ming wasn't a cultivator, his understanding of cultivation wasn't poor. This strongest brain's theoretical knowledge of cultivation alone had probably transcended that of many actual cultivators.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming stared at the flag, his pupils rotating as if they were a scanner, with rows of numbers scrolling up inside them.</p>

    <p>After a while, he finished analyzing it and could confirm that this flag hadn't been made in the current era; it had been made a very long time ago and was at least a thousand years old.</p>

    <p>Carrying Chen Chao on his back, he was lost in deep thought — what on earth was going on here?</p>

    <p>Actually, it was already very obvious...</p>

    <p>This demon qi had definitely come from the Gate Between Worlds!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling narrowed his eyes and his pupils blossomed with spirit light. Wang Ming hadn't been able to see the magic array set up around the array-guiding flag since he didn't have the Heavenly Eye, but Wang Ling saw it very clearly.</p>

    <p>This was a summoning array that had already been activated for some time.</p>

    <p>Worst of all, it had already entered the completion phase.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling calculated that in two minutes, the Gate Between Worlds would descend here!</p>

    <p>"Ling! Are you saying that the Gate Between Worlds will land here?" Wang Ming's face was troubled when he heard Wang Ling's explanation. His electronics had all stopped working, and he couldn't even call for reinforcements at a time like this! Moreover, he had blocked both Wang Ling and Chen Chao's radar signals, so the broadcast monitor in the conference room wouldn't capture the image of what was happening here.</p>

    <p>This was bad!</p>

    <p>What should they do?</p>

    <p>There was cold sweat on Wang Ming's cheeks. He looked at the protective golden light which covered him and Chen Chao, and felt a little despondent.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>In this tense atmosphere, Wang Ling just nonchalantly patted Wang Ming on the shoulder.</p>

    <p>With him around, he really didn't know why his idiot elder brother would be so nervous.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>This proved that even if they had had a closer relationship as family, after they had stopped growing up together and had been separated for a long time, there was bound to be changes in their understanding of each other.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling recalled how he had always been with Wang Ming as a kid; that was probably the time when Wang Ming had known him best.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming had been passionate about pointless challenges, such as rock-paper-scissors, the high jump, sprinting, the length of their "little brothers"... sometimes he would even compete with Wang Ling to see who could pee faster. Unfortunately, he had always been defeated.</p>

    <p>Later, he had been picked up by the people from the Cultivation Academy of Science and put under state protection. The number of times the two brothers had been able to meet dwindled; at most they would see each other once during the Chinese New Year reunion festival. There were times when Wang Ming had had a new breakthrough in his scientific research, and hadn't even gone home for the New Year.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling recalled that the last time he had met Wang Ming was the day this idiot elder brother of his had given him the Dao talisman seal.</p>

    <p>This time, it was because of work, and Wang Ming had brought his research team with him.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling had never thought...</p>

    <p>...that there could actually be a flaw in his elder brother's understanding of his strength.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Speaking of Wang Ming's understanding of Wang Ling's strength.</p>

    <p>The innate and uncontrollable growth of Wang Ling's realm had resulted in him reaching the Soul Formation stage at the age of seven; he hadn't even had time to consolidate his strength before he moved on to the next realm in no time.</p>

    <p>Since then, wearing the Dao talisman seal had become a part of Wang Ling's daily life. That thing was just like a band-aid that was stuck to his arm, and wouldn't come off, not even in the shower.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming thus was certainly aware that Wang Ling was very powerful.</p>

    <p>But he also had always privately thought that there was a limit to this strength.</p>

    <p>He still dreamt of defeating Wang Ling one day!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Everything was as Wang Ling had anticipated; two minutes later, the ground under their feet began to shake.</p>

    <p>The array-guiding flag's array released a burst of light, and the outer ring of the array plate, inscribed with mysterious, ancient words, turned continuously, emitting a repressive aura.</p>

    <p>Bzzt !</p>

    <p>A light of chaos bubbled up in the middle of the array. Wang Ling squinted, and ramped up the protective golden light covering Wang Ming and Chen Chao to the highest level; their bodies wouldn't have been able to withstand the pressure from this spatial disorder otherwise.</p>

    <p>At this point, if it had been any other student here, they would definitely have been torn apart by this light of chaos!</p>

    <p>The biting cold pressure of this light felt like something from as far back as a century ago...</p>

    <p>In the center where the array-guiding flag was, a glowing door gradually appeared!</p>

    <p>It was fully over ten zhang <sup>1</sup> tall, and carved into its frame were strange, overlapping symbols that couldn't be discerned.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(One zhang is roughly 3.3 meters.)</dfn>

    <p>The light around the door was also abnormally bright, and it took Wang Ming a long time to gradually get used to it before he felt like he could finally open his eyes.</p>

    <p>Even though he had been shielded by Wang Ling's protective golden light, under this constant, evil light, it felt difficult to even just breathe.</p>

    <p>"This is... the Gate Between Worlds??"</p>

    <p>This was the first time that Wang Ming had come face-to-face with the Gate, and at so close a distance that it filled him with abject terror!</p>

    <p>Without Wang Ling's protective golden light, he wouldn't have lasted even a second!</p>

    <p>In front of this door, Wang Ming saw that there wasn't even the slightest ripple in Wang Ling's expression.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling gazed at this massive, ten zhang tall door as if he were planning something.</p>

    <p>"Lingzi <sup>2</sup> , don't try to be a hero!" Wang Ming shouted. "You have the Dao talisman seal on, you can't use your full power! If you don't think you can handle it, we can retreat first, get out of the light's range, and find a student to contact the outside world and get help from Secretary Dakang!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Basically just a nickname, like 'Little Zhuozi.')</dfn>

    <p>The most critical thing was that Wang Ling couldn't take the talisman off so easily; if he did, he wouldn't be able to hold back his aura, and that would be disastrous for the whole small world! It would be a catastrophe more terrible than the descent of the Gate Between Worlds!</p>

    <p>Right now, they were trapped in a dilemma.</p>

    <p>Just then, there was another violent tremor.</p>

    <p>With a resounding creak, the great door of the Gate Between Worlds slowly started to open!</p>

    <p>In that instant, a storm wind came whistling out from the demon world, and Wang Ming's face twisted.</p>

    <p>Carrying Chen Chao on his back, he grimly relied on the protective golden light for support.</p>

    <p>He looked at Wang Ling and shouted anxiously, "Lingzi! No way! Come back!"</p>

    <p>He had heard Secretary Dakang mention before that in order to seal the Gate Between Worlds six years ago, the Ten Founding Generals had combined their strength together up to a total of one billion jin , which had been barely enough to close the Gate! Right now, Wang Ling was still wearing the Dao talisman seal; Wang Ming felt that no matter what, it would be impossible for him!</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, Wang Ling's steps didn't falter, and Wang Ming watched as he walked toward the Gate Between Worlds. He even saw that a demon claw as thick and solid as qiulong <sup>3</sup> had already stretched out through that open gap.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(A Chinese dragon, contradictorily defined as both "horned dragon" and "hornless dragon .. ")</dfn>

    <p>"Lingzi, don't go! With your current strength, you won't be able to close it!" Wang Ming gave a heartbroken yell.</p>

    <p>Ignoring Wang Ming's cry, Wang Ling stretched out his hand toward this massive door, then gave it a firm push.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming heard... a loud " dong "!</p>

    <p>The light of chaos in front of him disappeared...</p>

    <p>And then, that thick, solid demon claw was directly snapped off by the great door, and with a crash, fell at Wang Ling's feet.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "..."</p>

    <p>...Ah?</p>
