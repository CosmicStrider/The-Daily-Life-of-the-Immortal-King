  <h1>Chapter 113 Give Me a "Fighting Lion" </h1>

  <div>

    <p>After Lord Diulei had bulldozed the garden behind the villa back then, he had built a simple sunroom. In it, he had planted different types of hybrid spirit grass which he used in his research.</p>

    <p>Since he was a kid, his dream had always been to be the father of hybrid spirit grass <sup>1</sup> in the cultivation world.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is a nod to Yuan Longping, an agricultural scientist who developed the first hybrid rice varieties in the 1970s, and who is dubbed China's "father of hybrid rice.")</dfn>

    <p>He had been trying to develop a kind of poor man's spirit grass that would be easy to plant and could rapidly gather the spirit energy of heaven and earth, which could be used by children from poor areas who had no cultivation resources.</p>

    <p>Long before he had moved to Wenxian Garden, Lord Diulei had already been busy with this research.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, there were a lot of technical issues with hybrid spirit grass, and two months ago, he had become stuck in a bottleneck in his research. Since then, he hadn't made any further breakthroughs.</p>

    <p>But just when his mental fortitude had been about to crumble... a broccoli from Grandfather Wang had helped him regain confidence in his research.</p>

    <p>The first thing that he had done after returning home from the Wang family's small villa and calling Little Black was to replant the broccoli in spirit soil in the sunroom. Although Grandfather Wang had already cooked this broccoli... the spirit soil's unusual power could bring it back to life!</p>

    <p>This was the important revelation that the great senior had imparted to him on this road of cultivation - Lord Diulei felt that no matter what, he had to save this broccoli!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When the first rays of light pierced through the morning mist early on Sunday May 23rd, Lord Diulei was already sitting and cultivating in the back garden of his villa.</p>

    <p>Since replanting the broccoli, it had already become routine for him to sit before the broccoli in the sunroom every morning in addition to regularly doing eye exercises and watching guichu videos.</p>

    <p>He crossed his arms and legs, straightened his back and stared at the broccoli steadily as his thoughts spun unceasingly... he felt that he was just a hair's breadth away from achieving enlightenment on Heaven's law, and from stepping out of Soul Formation into the Void Refinement stage.</p>

    <p>Alas, he still hadn't been able to figure out great senior's meaning in giving him the broccoli.</p>

    <p>While he was thinking about this, a message from an "Unknown Region" came in. Lord Diulei immediately knew that it had to be Little Black.</p>

    <p>He opened the text, and as he read it, his gaze gradually turned heavy. When his fingers reached the bottom of the screen, he actually shot to his feet in astonishment.</p>

    <p>He confirmed the content of the message once again...</p>

    <p>After that, Lord Diulei sucked in a deep breath.</p>

    <p>Because, according to Little Black's investigation, this Lord of Mo Immortal Castle seemed to have a connection to Immortal She Pi.</p>

    <p>Was this the kid whom Immortal She Pi had left behind before being executed back then?</p>

    <p>No one knew because there wasn't any concrete evidence.</p>

    <p>Even the result of Little Black's investigation had just been calculated using a computer and by combining various types of data, and thus was debatable in itself.</p>

    <p>Little Black had even highlighted the degree to which this information could be considered accurate at the bottom of the text message.</p>

    <p>According to the computer's calculation, the overall accuracy of this information was fifty-eight percent.</p>

    <p>"Fifty-eight percent..." Even if this Lord of Mo Immortal Castle was not Immortal She Pi's child, there was still some sort of connection. However, according to historical records and what little gossip Lord Diulei had heard, Immortal She Pi hadn't taken in any disciples before being executed.</p>

    <p>Then...</p>

    <p>This Lord of the Castle who was connected to Immortal She Pi - who on earth was this person?</p>

    <p>Was this the reason why the Lord was so eager to obtain the stone ghost mask... for revenge?</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei didn't dare make any assumptions.</p>

    <p>For the moment, this was all conjecture... what was very clear, however, was that this was a huge problem that couldn't be ignored.</p>

    <p>He had already made his boast to Brother Ling and several great seniors!</p>

    <p>He had already sworn that until he found the mask's maker, he would definitely protect the stone ghost mask with all that he had!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After his morning exercise, Lord Diulei went to carry out another routine task, which was to reinforce the seal on the stone ghost mask.</p>

    <p>This was a cursed mask which was too unpredictable and hence was dangerous.</p>

    <p>Thus, he had sealed the stone ghost mask in a room in the basement. The guard matrix outside the room was something which he had customized himself; it was imprinted with a seal which he had personally drawn in order to suppress the evil powers of the stone ghost mask, and four netherworld chains hung in each corner of the matrix.</p>

    <p>The netherworld chain was an immortal artifact which Lord Diulei had initially bought out at the market. It was hard and had the powerful ability to repair itself; there was no way anyone could run off with the stone ghost mask unless they cut through these netherworld chains.</p>

    <p>The seal was utterly impregnable, but Lord Diulei felt that there were still some issues with his security measures.</p>

    <p>Defensive measures had been set up inside and outside the room, and the room was even under tight surveillance; he could monitor the situation with the binding application software on his wristwatch, even if he was very far away.</p>

    <p>But he still felt that there was something missing.</p>

    <p>Cupping his chin, he pondered for a while before it instantly occurred to him!</p>

    <p>Generally, holy artifacts or sealed objects would be guarded, right? He was lacking a guard dog!</p>

    <p>After figuring it out, Lord Diulei immediately made a phone call, which was picked up by the alchemist Immortal Toya.</p>

    <p>Hardly had the call connected when he heard a loud " boom " over the line...</p>

    <p>He knew without it needing to be said... the man's furnace had exploded yet again.</p>

    <p>" Cough...cough cough !"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya was coughing violently, presumably because of the smoke from the explosion — on his end of the call, it was an image that Lord Diulei could picture.</p>

    <p>" Cough cough ... hello, who is it? This is Toya, what do you want..."</p>

    <p>"It's Thunder..."</p>

    <p>"Oh... it's Senior Immortal."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Brother Toya, what are you doing?"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "Hm... just now I was working on a new type of elixir: a WIFI pill that once taken, will enable a person to carry a WIFI signal for twenty-four hours. Did you need something from me, Senior Immortal?"</p>

    <p>Since he didn't need to be polite, Lord Diulei directly said his piece. Given his friendship with Immortal Toya, there was no need for him to beat around the bush.</p>

    <p>After listening to his request, Immortal Toya was stunned. "A fighting master? Why are you asking me for a fighting master, you should go ask the Xiao clan. But the fighting masters that are left now are all just antiques... there is no battle qi for them to manipulate, nor can they use spirit energy — they're completely useless. Now they just work for the Xiao clan as security guards and maintain order in the Xiao Family Compound."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei sweatdropped <sup>2</sup> . "Brother Toya, are you purposely being obtuse? I'm not looking for a fighting master... it's a fighting lion <sup>3</sup> ! A lion! The thing you won from the Xiao elixir competition back then!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This refers to the way a sweatdrop appears on a character's head in Japanese comics and cartoons as a visual symbol of speechlessness or helplessness at something.)</dfn>
    
    <br/>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(The words 'master' and 'lion' are homophones ('shi') in Chinese ..)</dfn>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "..."</p>
