  <h1>Chapter 1145 Evil Sword God's Original Body</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Everyone knew that Evil Sword God's original body was his eye shadow.</p>

    <p>Without eye shadow, he was a scaredy-cat; with eye shadow, he was a shit-stirrer...</p>

    <p>This eye shadow personality transformation was something General Bai had seen with his own eyes. It had to be said that Evil Sword God with eye shadow on was indeed powerful. Moreover, from what General Bai could see, Evil Sword God's sword skills were almost on par with General Yi's.</p>

    <p>Given how remarkable the sword skills of these two disciples were, Sword Immortal Fan Rui as their <em>shifu</em> shouldn't have any regrets; the only pity was that Evil Sword God had been too radical in his cultivation, which caused his mind to be devoured and turned him into this, and led to the shocking murder of his <em>shifu</em>.</p>

    <p>At this thought, General Bai sighed inwardly as he used a cold flame to burn eye shadow over Evil Sword God's eyes.</p>

    <p>Very quickly, Evil Sword God's gaze turned sharp.</p>

    <p>Everyone knew that the belligerent Evil Sword God was back.</p>

    <p>Naturally, the different personalities had different memories.</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God looked at these familiar profile pics projected in the air, the past vivid in his mind, and he sneered. "Forgive me for being blunt, but I don't believe anyone here would be troublesome opponents." He folded his arms with a face full of confidence and laughed disdainfully at these profiles.</p>

    <p>Then, he pointed at one of them.</p>

    <p><em>[Criminal Profile]</em></p>

    <p><em>[Name: Ballistic Aunty - Han Wuye]</em></p>

    <p><em>[Warrant Level: Red 2A Warrant]</em></p>

    <p><em>[Character overview: A wanted member of the Dark Network. Given the nickname Golden Instant Noodles Hair Ballistic Aunty. An obese glutton. On the international wanted list for robbing banks in eighty-two countries. Dubbed the world's most ruthless and cold-blooded robber. She won't leave even a single penny behind wherever she goes, and everyone who sees her real face is brutally killed.]</em></p>

    <p><em>[Abilities: Famous for Eight Immortals Devour. Ballistic Aunty can turn her stomach into a small world, and for a short period of time, create a black hole to devour the people or objects around her. Any living thing that is sucked in is instantly ripped apart. This spatial magic is extremely tricky to deal with.]</em></p>

    <p><em>[Cause of death: Died tragically after being sliced to pieces by sword qi during an international organization's peacekeeping mission.]</em></p>

    <p>"What about her?" asked General Bai.</p>

    <p>He still had some impression of this person.</p>

    <p>Back then, Han Wuye had committed a lot of crimes in Huaxiu nation, and she fled by sea as she swam to a neighbouring country, and vanished without a trace.</p>

    <p>She went on the run for many years after that as she committed numerous robberies in various countries. When General Bai next received news on her, Han Wuye was already dead.</p>

    <p>"The fact is that Han Wuye died at my hands." Evil Sword God laughed coldly. "Death was too good for this fat old woman."</p>

    <p>"Died at your hands?" General Bai, the Old Devil and Master of Immortal Mansion were all taken aback.</p>

    <p>"My plan back then was to sneak into the peacekeeping force to look for the number one expert there. In the end, I just so happened to run into Han Wuye." Evil Sword God said, "She saw through my disguise and picked a fight with me herself."</p>

    <p>"What happened..."</p>

    <p>"She asked me if she was beautiful. I said that there wasn't anything beautiful about a fat, oily pork intestine like her. She then wanted to fight me." Evil Sword God tsked. "She clearly wasn't my match, but she still insisted on fighting me. I cut out her tongue so that she couldn't perform Eight Immortals Devour, and then I chopped off her thigh, and then I chopped..."</p>

    <p>"Slow down." General Bai found it hard to digest all of a sudden.</p>

    <p>This plot development...</p>

    <p>...was a little peculiar.</p>

    <p>"It wasn't just this Ballistic Aunty; I see a lot of familiar faces here who died under my sword." Evil Sword God then casually tapped on several profiles.</p>

    <p><em>[Criminal Profile]</em></p>

    <p><em>[Name: Edward Origen]</em></p>

    <p><em>[Warrant Level: Red 3A Warrant]</em></p>

    <p><em>[Character overview: A wanted member of the Dark Network. Due to an innate ability to turn his body into colored glass, he can blend into his surroundings. Given the nickname Human Chameleon. Has the powerful ability to disguise himself. Recognized by the international hitmen circle for plotting a number of assassinations.]</em></p>

    <p><em>[Abilities: Colored glass physique, assassination skills, etc.]</em></p>

    <p><em>[Cause of death: Failed a hitman operation. Suspected of being killed by his target instead, with one shot to the head.]</em></p>

    <p>"This person was famous in the hitmen circle. I was very curious about him at the time, and so hired him to kill me. In the end, I was sorely disappointed. I didn't expect this guy to actually be so weak." Evil Sword God sighed</p>

    <p>General Bai, the Old Devil and Master of Immortal Mansion: "..."</p>

    <p><em>[Criminal Profile]</em></p>

    <p><em>[Name: King of Iron Wings Song Xihe]</em></p>

    <p><em>[Warrant Level: Red 4A Warrant]</em></p>

    <p><em>[Character overview: A wanted member of the Dark Network. Viewed as the biggest threat to Ultimate King of Killers's position as the Dark Network's number one expert. Removed his own ribs at a young age and refined them into iron wings for his back. Has strong defensive and counter-offensive abilities. Known as King of Iron Wings, and was indestructible!</em></p>

    <p><em>[Abilities: Iron Wing Attack Technique, Iron Wing Illusion Technique, Iron Wing Spear, etc.]</em></p>

    <p><em>[Cause of death: Died tragically with the soles of his feet pierced with sword qi in a suspected revenge attack.]</em></p>

    <p>Evil Sword God: "You really can't blame me for this person's death - he just had such an obvious opening. What use is it surrounding yourself like a metal bucket? Didn't he die anyway when my sword qi pierced the soles of his feet? Ultimate King of Killers actually viewed him as a rival - what a joke."</p>

    <p>General Bai, the Old Devil and Master of Immortal Mansion: "..."</p>

    <p>General Bai took a deep breath and forced himself to calm down. "Take a look at these people and tell me how many of them you killed."</p>

    <p>"Except for the three people before, let me have a look at the others."</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God gazed at the page and started to count how many of these Dark Network wanted criminals he had killed, looking as excited as if he were counting medals. "This guy, this guy and this guy... It still makes me excited when I think about the fright on their faces when I killed them. They boasted day in and day out how great they were, but they still died under my sword."</p>

    <p>A few minutes later, he was done counting.</p>

    <p>General Bai counted the number of people on the list.</p>

    <p>There were over one hundred dangerous Dark Network wanted criminals in the database who were already deceased, and thirty-four of these experts, which was one third of them, had died at Evil Sword God's hands.</p>

    <p>All these years, Evil Sword God had wielded his peerless sword qi in his search for opponents. Although he had committed plenty of senseless murders, he had in fact indirectly punished a lot of criminals who had been on the run.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Evil Sword God's face brimmed with excitement. "They're all just small fry. If I can kill them once, I can kill them twice!"</p>

    <p>Looking at the list in his hand, General Bai had very complicated feelings...</p>
