  <h1>Chapter 207 Mercury Retrograde Is Too Powerful! </h1>

  <div>
  
    <p>As a veteran in cultivation circles, Lord Diulei deserved his nickname Smooth Talker — if he was selling crutches, he could fool people into thinking they were lame; if he was selling cars, he could persuade them into coughing up the cash.</p>

    <p>When the cultivation forum had been first set up, it had been short on funds. Relying on his fast-talking skills, he had wandered about in the city in a black windbreaker and ran his con whenever he met someone: Little brother, from your fine physique, I can tell that you're a rare cultivation genius. You will be needed to protect world peace!</p>

    <p>Using this phrase, he had sold a lot of handmade wooden spirit swords and cultivation manuals at that time. All of his customers, moreover, had been naive cultivators who had just entered the cultivation circle. Actually, thinking about it properly, this had been quite an unethical thing to do. This was hence the reason why Lord Diulei had become someone who burst with righteousness in the cultivation circle, who liked to meddle in other people's business, and who became revered as Great Death-Courting Senior... it was all for the sake of paying back his intolerable past debts.</p>

    <p>He could summarize his current conduct in four words: give back to society.</p>

    <p>In fact, if Wang Ling were to trace back past events, he would be surprised to discover that his and Lord Diulei's fated connection had in fact started when he had been very young.</p>

    <p>Because back then, it was Lord Diulei who had sold that Chanel magic sword, which Wang Ling had destroyed, secondhand to Father Wang.</p>

    <p>After the old devil and that young man from Immortal Mansion who had run off in tears had left one after another, the villa district's security group and a number of police cars arrived at the scene.</p>

    <p>The young man from Immortal Mansion had created a lot of chaos with Abyss Avoidance.</p>

    <p>Luckily, Wang Ling had shown up just in time to prevent further damage at the scene as well as to the surrounding areas.</p>

    <p>If that gold crescent earlier had sliced its way through, the sword qi would have cut everything within an endless range around them into half...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei's villa had been severely damaged. Except for the basement, almost half of the villa already lay in ruins. However, he wasn't distressed about this at all; instead, he cried bitter tears over the pile of dead, withered broccoli in the back garden... all the plants there had died except for that hawthorn tree which the young man from Immortal Mansion had protected during the chaotic battle.</p>

    <p>He had never expected this hawthorn tree to actually trigger such a catastrophe.</p>

    <p>Because the fight that had broken out here hadn't been a small one, based on standard procedure, Wang Ling and the other two would have to be taken to the police station to give their statements.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Zhuo Yi demonstrated his precious value once again.</p>

    <p>After Wang Ling sent him a message, the police captain leading the team on this end immediately received a call from the police station to treat this huge incident as a completely ordinary domestic dispute.</p>

    <p>Because this matter was related to the old devil and Immortal Mansion, which the three of them currently still didn't know anything about, the police wouldn't be of much help even if they stepped in. Hence, Wang Ling planned to wait until things had been settled before letting the police wind everything up.</p>

    <p>In this way, he would be able to step back from the matter completely in the end.</p>

    <p>With Zhuo Yi making calls behind the scene, the police captain in the end just took a token statement.</p>

    <p>As he was about to leave, the police captain saluted Lord Diulei. "Sir, we won't bother you any longer today. This incident will probably be classified as an accident. We'll follow up on the property damage — we've already discussed it with villa district security, and we'll arrange for someone from the insurance company to pay you a visit."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei gripped the police captain's hand excitedly. "Comrade police, do you know exactly what this insurance covers?"</p>

    <p>"That... that'll depend on the insurance company's clause, we don't know for certain." The police captain shook his head regretfully. "The only thing I can be sure of is that the broccoli which you planted was definitely not covered by insurance..."</p>

    <p>Standing on the side, Wang Ling saw Lord Diulei's face instantly turn gloomy at the police captain's words.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei had already given up on reflecting on the matter.</p>

    <p>The problem was that Grandfather Wang hadn't had any deep intentions when he had given him the broccoli — it truly was nothing more than an ordinary broccoli!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, the old devil had retreated into his small world again.</p>

    <p>Who could have imagined that this unparalleled devil, who had stirred up great waves and strutted arrogantly around Huaxiu nation, would be reduced to this.</p>

    <p>His two attempts to "leave the mountain"<sup>1</sup> had in the end both resulted in failure.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This refers to when a hermit has completed his seclusion &amp; is ready to join the world &amp; achieve his objectives)</dfn>

    <p>Atop the boundary support of the small world, both the old devil and Jiang Liuyue pondered the issue.</p>

    <p>"As expected, the key to this problem is still that Killer Taoist." The old devil gave a faint sigh from inside the stone ghost mask. "Once again, I underestimated this junior's realm. That master-con psycho's strength is at the Void Refinement stage; along with that Abyss Avoidance in his hand, he was able to prevail against my Void Refinement devil spirit. And that other junior was able to parry my sword attack with a single finger... this is enough to prove that his strength is definitely above the Void Refinement stage."</p>

    <p>"Senior, are you confident you can win?" Jiang Liuyue asked worriedly.</p>

    <p>"I am," the old devil answered in the affirmative. "What my venerable self has to do now is to return to my peak condition. When the time comes, I will personally forge that junior into a devil spirit to serve me."</p>

    <p>"No matter what, the next time senior wants to leave the mountain, you have to carefully think about it beforehand to avoid something going wrong again," Jiang Liuyue reminded him on the side.</p>

    <p>"Indeed." The old devil nodded his head. "My venerable self has noticed recently that whatever move I make, everything goes wrong. Lately, my venerable self has been specially researching what the modern world calls astrology."</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue: "...Senior believes in this thing?"</p>

    <p>The old devil: "Of course! My venerable self engaged an online astrologer who said I was in the Mercury Retrograde period, which was why everything is going wrong. But this person didn't clearly explain what on earth Mercury Retrograde is."</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue: "..."</p>

    <p>The old devil: "Speaking of this Mercury Retrograde, the fact that it can actually influence my fate in some mysterious way is a little amazing."</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue: "...There's a way to overcome Mercury Retrograde; Lord Devil Emperor just needs to carry the corresponding lucky items."</p>

    <p>"That's what that astrologer said, and that person actually gave me a solution. I've already screenshot it, it's on your phone. But my venerable self doesn't understand what it means no matter how much I've thought about it." Upon saying this, the old devil directed Jiang Liuyue to open the first screenshot in her phone's photo album — it was an image of an astrology card provided by the astrologer with three letters on it: GCM.</p>

    <p>The old devil was still puzzled no matter how much he'd pondered it. "My venerable self has thought about it for so long but I still don't understand what these three letters mean..."</p>

    <p>After some thought, Jiang Liuyue changed her phone input method into pinyin mode and typed in GCM these three letters...</p>

    <p>Instantly, she revealed an enlightened expression.</p>
