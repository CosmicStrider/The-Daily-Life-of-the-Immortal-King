  <h1>Chapter 187 Stand Back, My Venerable Self Is Going to Put On a Show! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Inside the convenience mart, the old devil who hadn't eaten meat for one thousand years picked his teeth. Cracks then appeared in his flesh, which finally crumbled into specks that dropped off.</p>

    <p>"As I thought, half an hour is already the limit." Devil Emperor Gua Pi sighed and had to return to the stone ghost mask once again, tearing out the delivery brother whom he had switched positions with earlier and throwing him aside.</p>

    <p>This Riceball Takeout delivery brother trembled in one corner. Like the rest, his soul had been forcibly replaced by Devil Emperor Gua Pi when he had delivered the takeout earlier.</p>

    <p>This was already the thirty-second delivery guy to suffer from this evil scheme.</p>

    <p>However, these deliverymen were a little special. While each of them carried an insulated Riceball Takeout delivery box, this basically belonged to the merchant.</p>

    <p>If they didn't return to their bodies within seventy-two hours, their souls would be completely dispersed.</p>

    <p>But the crucial point was that their bodies had already been ruined by this old devil after he had had his way with them.</p>

    <p>"Lord Devil Emperor, is this really alright?" Jiang Liuyue raised her eyebrows at this scene.</p>

    <p>She knew that this matter had probably already attracted the attention of the outside world.</p>

    <p>"It was their honor to be made use of by my venerable self." Within the black mist, Devil Emperor Gua Pi gave a strange-sounding laugh. "But I never thought that cultivation could be developed to such an extent through science and technology. The majority of these thirty-two delivery employees are actually Foundation Establishment cultivators?"</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue answered, "Nowadays, education is compulsory for all cultivators at the Body Condensation, Qi Condensation, Foundation Establishment and Golden Core stages, so Foundation Establishment cultivators actually aren't rare. The difference lies in actual combat experience and abilities."</p>

    <p>"Mm." Devil Emperor Gua Pi nodded and thought that these were all things that he could make use of as he recalled how that Gua Pi army which he had set up one thousand years ago had in the end been utterly defeated due to the difference in strength. But the world now had made it compulsory for Foundation Establishment and Golden Core cultivators to get an education; even delivery employees were at the Foundation Establishment stage. In the future, it wouldn't be as hard as it had been previously for him to raise an army — just conquering a few high schools or universities might already provide him with enough manpower.</p>

    <p>In the black mist, Devil Emperor Gua Pi pondered deeply for a while before he stared at that delivery guy's soul in the corner. "Junior, my venerable self would like to ask, what is the proportion of delivery employees in your restaurants that are Foundation Establishment cultivators? How many of them are there?"</p>

    <p>"Senior... we're just a branch store... but based on nationwide statistics, the proportion is about twenty percent, which is probably about three million people..." The little brother held his head as he huddled in the corner. He was just a deliveryman, and there were so many employees who were just like him — who the hell could have known what he would be going through today?!</p>

    <p>"There are over three million Foundation Establishment cultivators in your restaurants? So many?"</p>

    <p>Devil Emperor Gua Pi looked startled, then stared at him as he asked, "My venerable self ordered a bit too many things, it's a little hard to remember all of them. What did you deliver?"</p>

    <p>"Yang's Braised Chicken Rice <sup>1</sup> ..." the little brother replied weakly.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Yang's Braised Chicken Rice is
one of China's most popular
restaurant chains.)</dfn>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue tsked. "So that's it, no wonder there were so many of them."</p>

    <p>In the black mist, Devil Emperor Gua Pi had a disbelieving expression on his face. "Is this Yang's Braised Chicken Rice that mighty?"</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue nodded. "Mm, it's probably the second largest restaurant chain in Huaxiu..."</p>

    <p>Devil Emperor Gua Pi: "Then... what's the first?"</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue: "Shaxian Delicacies <sup>2</sup> ."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Shaxian Delicacies is a style of
cuisine from Sha county in the
Fujian province of China that
expanded into a diverse chain
of stores that operate under
the Shaxian Delicacies
trademark.)</dfn>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Devil Emperor Gua Pi suddenly understood — their wonton and lo mein <sup>3</sup> were actually pretty good.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(These are perhaps the most
well-known of the Shaxian
delicacies ..)</dfn>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ling was already approaching the entrance to the convenience mart in his fake Riceball Takeout uniform and a plastic bag of crispy noodle snacks in one hand.</p>

    <p>He could sense something dark in the convenience mart, but couldn't quite describe exactly what it was. Even just standing at the door left him feeling deeply unsettled in his heart.</p>

    <p>Just as Immortal Toya had anticipated, the foul atmosphere in here was really too heavy. With his Heavenly Eye, Wang Ling could see many spirits floating around the convenience mart; these were very likely the souls of those deliverymen.</p>

    <p>Those missing deliverymen and this convenience mart were absolutely related.</p>

    <p>Inside the convenience mart, Devil Emperor Gua Pi was also very vigilant; scarcely had Wang Ling started his approach when the former had sensed that someone was coming. "Hm? Another delivery employee?"</p>

    <p>"Did Lord Devil Emperor order something again?"</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue felt a little awkward and thought that this thousand-year-old foodie whom she had liberated was a little scary.</p>

    <p>"Oh, no. My venerable self already ordered all the takeouts nearby, and there's nothing else novel to eat." Devil Emperor Gua Pi's smile in the black mist looked very strange. "This person is wearing a uniform and is carrying a bag in one hand. Perhaps he has the wrong place?"</p>

    <p>"Perhaps..." Jiang Liuyue nodded as she sent her spiritual senses out through the convenience mart's tightly shut door. "But I suspect this man might be One-Inch Gray or Steamed Bun Invader in disguise..."</p>

    <p>Disguise was a required course for killers. Making use of an appropriate disguise to lower the enemy's guard and then finally delivering the knockout blow... Jiang Liuyue had an innate sense for detecting this kind of trick. As Master of Shadow Stream, she had weathered all types of storms over the years.</p>

    <p>Devil Emperor Gua Pi: "Can you be certain that this man is in disguise?"</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue solemnly nodded. "I didn't dare to confirm it earlier, but now I'm certain that this man is definitely the Steamed Bun Invader that I told Lord Devil Emperor about before. This man is extremely proficient in the aura concealment skill and can easily give the impression that he's an ordinary man."</p>

    <p>"Hearing you say this, I do feel that this man is a little suspicious."</p>

    <p>In the black mist, Devil Emperor Gua Pi's expression darkened.</p>

    <p>If it had been a regular aura concealment skill, it wouldn't have been of the least bit use in the face of this thousand-year-old devil. However, probing the person outside with his spiritual senses had resulted in a vague and abnormal impression. If this was the case, it was very clear that this man was deliberately in disguise!</p>

    <p>"How confident are you that you'll be able to meet this person head on?" asked Devil Emperor Gua Pi.</p>

    <p>"At my peak, he would have been completely far beneath my notice, but now... I can only rely on Lord Devil Emperor." Jiang Liuyue braced herself. "Before, Lord Devil Emperor said you would cooperate with me, right?"</p>

    <p>Devil Emperor Gua Pi: "Since my venerable self has already promised to cooperate with you, I naturally won't back out. Even if it wasn't for your sake, my venerable self must still do it for the sake of Yang's Braised Chicken Rice and Shaxian Delicacies!"</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue: "..."</p>

    <p>"Go ahead and open the door!"</p>

    <p>In the black mist, he took a deep breath and looked at her fixedly at the same time. "Stand back... my venerable self is going to put on a show!"</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue: "..."</p>
