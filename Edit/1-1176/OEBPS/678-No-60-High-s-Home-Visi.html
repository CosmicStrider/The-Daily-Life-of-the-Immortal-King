  <h1>Chapter 678 Number 60 High's Home Visit</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling had already found out via text message about Zhuo Yi's intent to pay a home visit. He felt that Zhuo Yi had handled the matter this time very astutely! Knowing that Number 60 High wanted to make a home visit, Zhuo Yi had simply taken the work on himself. Otherwise, if it was Teacher Pan who dropped by, the atmosphere would truly be awkward.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, Wang Ling had the urge to give Zhuo Yi a "red packet."</p>

    <p>Of course, this red packet didn't refer to money; Wang Ling didn't have much, and Father Wang would find some way to dock his allowance.</p>

    <p>What this red packet referred to was actually "items."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi's current outfit was a little terrible. Additionally, this particular case made Wang Ling deeply aware that he couldn't just leave Zhuo Yi to carry the wok on his back for him outside. The "wok" wasn't bad, but it had to be hard enough since the enemy troop's gunfire was now coming too thick and fast...</p>

    <p>If things carried on like this, Zhuo Yi would sooner or later be unable to bear it one day.</p>

    <p>Thus, Wang Ling felt that he should fix this problem of quality, and upgrade this cheap disciple of his inside out.</p>

    <p>Although it had been less than a few months since Zhuo Yi became his disciple, he had in any case shouldered a lot of things for Wang Ling for so many years. Even if he didn't have any meritorious deeds to his name, it had still been a lot of hard work.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had seen a lot of negative news about Zhuo Yi online because of this incident.</p>

    <p>As his shifu, Wang Ling himself found it slightly difficult to bear.</p>

    <p>Some people actually turned their noses up at Zhuo Yi because of his low realm...</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling saw that comment, he took a deep breath... In that moment, he made up his mind to create a technique tailored for Zhuo Yi, and help him progress quickly in his cultivation!</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi's natural talent was in fact already good enough. At least where cultivation was concerned, he was more gifted than most people Wang Ling had seen.</p>

    <p>One had to know, although Zhuo Yi had reached his current position by shouldering the wok in Wang Ling's place, he had cultivated to the Golden Core stage before he entered university... That had all been due to his own abilities! And most importantly, Zhuo Yi hardly took elixirs! He was completely different from those kids from rich families who used elixirs to forcefully build their realms.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi had his own abilities.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had never denied this.</p>

    <p>So in some sense, he did feel that his disciple was an outstanding person.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When Zhuo Yi came in, the Wang family's small villa wasn't the least bit ruffled... Although Number 60 High had already sent Father Wang and Mother Wang a text saying that a teacher would be sent to pay them a visit and to talk about some negative news surrounding Number 60 High recently, Father Wang and Mother Wang, sitting on the sofa, were relieved after they found out that it was Zhuo Yi who would be coming.</p>

    <p>Since Wang Ling started school, the couple hadn't even gone to any of the parent-teacher conferences; Lord Diulei had gone to the most recent one in their place.</p>

    <p>Hence, when they heard that they would be meeting the teacher, they had felt a little nervous, but after seeing that it was Zhuo Yi...</p>

    <p>They both jumped up from the sofa.</p>

    <p>Mother Wang: "I'm going to go cook..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "I'm going to go type!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>When Mother Wang reached the kitchen, she didn't forget to give Zhuo Yi a look. "Little Zhuo, stay tonight and have something to eat."</p>

    <p>Honestly speaking, Zhuo Yi was a little moved in his heart; this was purely being treated as one of their own.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling placed the technique which he had specially tailor-made for Zhuo Yi in his room on the table. The name of this technique was "Thirty-Three Paths to Vitality," which was a minor technique derived from a branch of a branch of a great Heavenly Dao... Even so, it went without saying how valuable this technique was.</p>

    <p>If this technique were to be classified according to Sky, Earth, Black, or Yellow, it would definitely belong to the Sky category since it had a connection to Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>Moreover, this technique couldn't be bought in the outside world.</p>

    <p>This was because what Wang Ling was giving to Zhuo Yi was a technique that was specially tailored to Zhuo Yi's abilities. With this technique, Zhuo Yi's initial cultivation base would advance very rapidly, as the "Thirty-Three Paths to Vitality" itself was a method for increasing the circulation of spirit energy inside the body. This circulation of spirit energy was like a person's metabolism: the faster the spirit energy circulated, the faster the innovation of a person's realm.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi had never ever expected his shifu to actually give him such a big gift when he came to visit him today.</p>

    <p>His hands trembled when he accepted the little exercise book from Wang Ling... though the packaging of this technique looked a little simple and crude, this was the type of exercise book which students used, and the name of this technique was also unpretentiously noted down in the "Course" box of the exercise book.</p>

    <p>However, when the exercise book was opened...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi could clearly see the points of note in cultivating this technique as well as the most detailed explanations for the various sections in the exercise book.</p>

    <p>And most important of all was that Wang Ling had written all this by hand!</p>

    <p>This thing was so precious that Zhuo Yi trembled all over with excitement and almost passed out on the spot with his tongue hanging out.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Zhuo Yi deeply felt that shouldering that wok all these years hadn't been in vain. Sure enough, if he followed shifu Wang Ling, he would have meat to eat!</p>

    <p>Of course, Zhuo Yi didn't expect his shifu to throw even more bombs at him!</p>

    <p>After receiving the little notebook with the technique recorded in it, Zhuo Yi immediately saw Wang Ling open a second exercise book, which was filled with writings on various magic artifacts...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was startled. What did this mean?</p>

    <p>Out of so many magic artifacts, was he allowed to choose one?</p>

    <p>Joker and joker!</p>

    <p>This was a Rocket<sup>1</sup>!!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(In the card game "Fight the Landlord," a colored joker and black-and-white joker combo can beat everything else in the game.)</dfn>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>While Zhuo Yi paid the Wang family a "home visit"...</p>

    <p>At the same time elsewhere, a lot of people sighed in the military tent.</p>

    <p>Their Demon Hunters Association this time had unexpectedly lost three overseas returnee generals one after another... Elder Ji Xing, as the chief commander of this revenge plan, indeed had to shoulder the blame for this. But in the end, he would have to wait until the end of the operation tomorrow before he could find President Bai and beg for forgiveness.</p>

    <p>Their main concern right now was tomorrow's master plan, and then they had to figure out how to organize for people to take Elder Yaren back.</p>

    <p>Elder Ji Xing speculated that Elder Yaren was now in a half-dead, half-alive state, which would account for his twinkling soul mark.</p>

    <p>Now, not including that Elder Mingren whose Nine-Tails was still undergoing psychological treatment and adding in Elder Ji Xing, there were only eleven people left of the Demon Hunters Association's available combat force in the military tent...</p>

    <p>Elder Ji Xing dropped his forehead into his hand and felt that this wasn't just any ordinary headache...</p>

    <p>"A drink can solve a thousand worries; why don't we all have a drink?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Elder Nanco suggested, "Didn't Sonico happen to bring some croquettes back? We can eat them with wine. Let's toast Elder Poisonous Dragon and Elder Yin to comfort their spirits..."</p>
