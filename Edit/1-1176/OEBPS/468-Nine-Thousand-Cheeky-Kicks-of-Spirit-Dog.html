  <h1>Chapter 468 Nine Thousand Cheeky Kicks of Spirit Dog </h1>

  <div>

    <p>This information scroll made the two people from the Demon Hunters Association look at Mo Immortal Mansion with new eyes. After Er Ha had caused a big scene at the spirit beast black market town that had been occupied by the Demon Hunters Association, the whole association had suffered massive losses.</p>

    <p>After that, since Strong Zuo had placed a soul marker on Er Ha, President Bai had sent out Elder Canglan and Elder Han, the senior and junior brother team who were pretty successful at capturing spirit beasts. In the end, however, they had ended up dying and leaving nothing behind. After these two brothers had been killed, President Bai had dispatched a lot of people to search for Er Ha's whereabouts, but they had all returned empty-handed.</p>

    <p>He had never expected to actually truly obtain a follow-up clue at Mo Immortal Castle.</p>

    <p>President Bai hadn't researched this Mo Immortal Castle organization in detail before this, and had only heard of it. Even the Lady of the Castle whom he had gotten in touch with had been through a referral from his friend.</p>

    <p>From this initial contact with Mo Immortal Castle, Bai Zhe thought that Mo Immortal Castle surpassed other organizations in terms of gathering intel. This was perhaps all due to Mo Immortal Castle's research equipment behind the scenes... To actually be able to find the slightest relevant clues at the scene with their detection methods - Mo Immortal Castle definitely had to be harboring a very talented scientist behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe was suddenly a lot more interested in Mo Immortal Castle.</p>

    <p>But he hadn't directly met the one calling the shots behind the scenes in Mo Immortal Castle at this meeting today; this was the Lord of the Castle whom the Lady had mentioned. To be able to create such an organization, it was obvious that the Lord wasn't an ordinary person, and Bai Zhe was very keen to meet him.</p>

    <p>But for now, there was no rush.</p>

    <p>"The rest is up to you, Old Lu. Let me know once you've made progress."</p>

    <p>Sitting on the sofa, Bai Zhe looked at the Lady calmly out of the corner of his eye. "This is the first cooperation between our Demon Hunters Association and Mo Immortal Castle; may it be a pleasant one. Please discuss everything else with Old Lu, Lady, I'll take my leave first."</p>

    <p>After that, the Lady saw the small black umbrella suspended above President Bai's head spin slightly, and then spirit light was thrown out before President Bai and the umbrella directly vanished.</p>

    <p>The Lady's expression was unruffled, but her heart was greatly shaken. As she had thought, this umbrella was a spatial magic weapon and obviously had an unusual origin!</p>

    <p>Seeing President Bai disappear, the Lady was absent-minded for a long while. A moment later, she stared at Mr Lu, the 'forest fairy,' and asked, "Mr Lu, if I can be so bold as to ask, how strong is President Bai?"</p>

    <p>Old Lu muttered to himself a bit when he heard this question and he went over to the window. The breeze brushed over the dark green Daoist robe he was wearing and ruffled his collar slightly.</p>

    <p>"If you can't say much about it, Mr Lu, please pretend that you never heard my question." Seeing that the other party hadn't said anything for a long time, the Lady spoke after thinking for a bit. When it came to their clients, the Lord of the Castle had always insisted that they find out everything about them.</p>

    <p>Therefore, as long as she wanted to investigate President Bai, the Lady would still be able to find out things about him through Mo Immortal Castle's current means of gathering information, even if Mr Lu didn't say anything,</p>

    <p>In contrast, asking direct questions like this was sure to sour the friendly atmosphere.</p>

    <p>Mr Lu shook his head and replied, "With Mo Immortal Castle's means of gathering intelligence, it'll actually be very easy for you to find out if you want to. I can't say much about President Bai's strength, but he is certainly much stronger than me."</p>

    <p>"..." The Lady was dazed and couldn't help cursing in her heart: No damn way!</p>

    <p>Mr Lu said, "As I said before, we, the forest fairy tree demons, have self-healing abilities and strong vitality. If there is someone among the human race who can surpass our Spell of Creation and Rebirth... I'm not exaggerating when I say that if President Bai is ranked second, then no one else is ranked first."</p>

    <p>When Mr Lu said this, the Lady finally looked up in amazement.</p>

    <p>She had already had a thorough taste of Old Lu's Spell of Creation and Rebirth; she had never ever thought that President Bai would actually be stronger than him.</p>

    <p>Mr Lu: "So in some sense, I believe that President Bai is the strongest... Because, there is absolutely no one who can kill him."</p>

    <p>The Lady broke out in a sweat.</p>

    <p>It turned out that this new patron...</p>

    <p>Was a cockroach!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After Er Ha had played Xiao Yin the last time, the two had added each other as friends. Although Xiao Yin had indeed really been hurt at the time, he was a newcomer to the city. If he wanted to learn the ways of the city from a "senior," his best choice was to consult Er Ha, who already had considerable experience.</p>

    <p>Because in a sense, they were of the same type...</p>

    <p>Besides, Xiao Yin really wanted to know more about anything to do with Master, and there was probably no one more familiar with Master than Er Ha. Although Thunder was also Master's good friend, Xiao Yin still felt that he definitely wasn't more familiar with him than Er Ha, who lived under the same roof.</p>

    <p>This time, Xiao Yin took the initiative to find Er Ha because Lord Diulei had asked him to help Er Ha look for some suitable close combat spirit techniques for canine spirit beasts.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin had been thinking about this all the while. He had spent roughly two days listing down spirit techniques which he thought would be suitable for Er Ha to cultivate before carefully selecting a few. He drew detailed diagrams that showed how to use each spirit technique, even clearly marking how the spirit energy would circulate through the meridians.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin sent the data to Er Ha. "Look at these and see if they'll work? I actually have more advanced techniques here, but I'm worried you might not be able to master them, so I'm sending level three and level four techniques to you first."</p>

    <p>In Wang Ling's room, Er Ha clicked on the data and read it carefully.</p>

    <p>The techniques were as follows:</p>

    <p><em>1. Solo offense skill: Chain Slap <sup>1</sup> </em><em>...</em></p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Likely adapted from the Pokemon 'Double Slap' move, or 'Round Trip Slap' in Japanese.)</dfn>

    <p><em>Effect: A common level three spirit technique of the Dog clan. Can inflict ongoing critical damage to an enemy's face. There is a saying: Hit someone in the face and injure their ego. This skill carries an "inferiority" negative effect which reduces the enemy's will to fight and increases their sense of fear.</em></p>

    <p><em>2. Group offense skill: Nine Thousand Cheeky Kicks of Spirit Dog...</em></p>

    <p><em>Effect: A level four spirit technique of the Dog clan. Kick the hind legs out swiftly to create multiple phantoms. Inflicts nine thousand strikes in succession on an enemy within its range with tremendous destructive force! Also has the secondary effect of "flying hit"! The rationale behind this spirit technique draws on the technique which made the Cat clan famous, "Three Thousand Mischievous Kicks of Blue Cat <sup>2</sup> </em><em>"...</em></p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is adapted from "3000 Mischievous Whys of Blue Cat," the first large-scale Chinese animated series in mainland China with an emphasis on science.)</dfn>

    <p><em>3: Defense skill: Dog Sounds <sup>3</sup> </em><em>Sitting Lotus...</em></p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(This is a literal translation of the original Chinese "quanyin," which in turn is a play on the Chinese "Guanyin," commonly known as the Buddhist goddess of mercy and frequently pictured as sitting or standing on a lotus flower..)</dfn>

    <p><em>Effect: A level four defense spirit technique of the Dog clan. Give a battle cry to create a lotus shield, which can remove abnormalities on the body. Also creates limited immunity to magic and has the effect of enhancing speed in attacks!</em></p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>
