  <h1>Chapter 1148 Competing For Resources</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Human Devil was Chaber Mike, and his Chinese name was Xia Lixing. He was one of the few guys back then whom the Old Devil had been able to defeat only by a narrow margin, but it wasn't the Old Devil who killed him. Only now did the Old Devil learn, from the profile in General Bai's hands, how Xia Lixing had died.</p>

    <p>"Xia Lixing was killed in the bombing of Divine Rank Island," General Bai said. After listening to the Old Devil's account, he connected all the dots.</p>

    <p>After fighting the Old Devil back then, Human Devil Xia Lixing had been seriously wounded, and he fled to Divine Rank Island, known as a Soul Formation paradise, to cultivate. He was then discovered by the International Alliance of Cultivators, who promptly decided to take him down completely at the cost of destroying Divine Rank Island.</p>

    <p>In the end, Xia Lixing was killed when the International Alliance of Cultivators bombed Divine Rank Island.</p>

    <p>"Xia Lixing's Holy Devil Imprisonment Technique is particularly tricky. By constantly devouring souls, he can increase the number of cells in his body. As far as I know, Xia Lixing consumed more than twenty-five million souls before he died. He can devour all living things, like spirit plants, spirit beasts and so forth..." the Old Devil reminisced. "I believe that Human Devil has been resurrected. We have to get rid of him first."</p>

    <p>"I can also sense an unusual withering of spirit plants in the southeast; it appears that Human Devil has shown up. Reasonably speaking, this shouldn't happen while the rainbow mist is around." General Bai frowned as thoughts flashed through his mind.</p>

    <p>Thus, General Bai directly contacted President Qi in a completely independent mental space.</p>

    <p>This was President Qi's space layer ability, which enabled all the personnel involved in this operation to establish an independent communication space with him without the need for an intermediary magic treasure to send a transmission. As long as they imagined President Qi's appearance, they could establish contact with him.</p>

    <p>President Qi could even link together the mental spaces of people on the same mission to form a local area network.</p>

    <p>Currently, only President Qi was capable of this formidable mental connection skill. Wang Ming had very strong mental abilities, but he still lacked training, and was prone to overloading his mind.</p>

    <p>Thus, no matter how outstanding Wang Ming was, he still needed to devote himself to training for a long time before he could reach President Qi's level.</p>

    <p>"Old Qi, we seem to have discovered traces of the suspect Human Devil. I hope the command center can assist us by sealing off the area Human Devil has appeared in, and lead away the children who are nearby."</p>

    <p>President Qi replied almost in seconds. "Noted, the command center will immediately set up a barrier and seal off the area."</p>

    <p>"Move out; let's go and take a look." After that, General Bai stomped his foot, and a resplendent, fiery dragon burst forth from beneath him like a rocket, taking along the three men behind him to Human Devil's location.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, the former tranquility of Nine Dragon Mountain was now broken by the clamor of the national competition.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and the others had been sent to a relatively remote location, which was good news for them in a survival battle.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi probed their surroundings with his senses before saying, "There's no one nearby."</p>

    <p>"Do you specialize in perception?" Chen Chao was puzzled.</p>

    <p>"Sort of; I'm better at perception and reasoning," Gu Shunzhi said with a smile. He had discussed it with Zhenyuan, Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi beforehand, and each of them would play a particular role in the team. If they each had their own task, they would be less likely to be exposed.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi chose perception.</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi chose the "wet nurse" route, since the Liu family were renowned for their medical expertise in the Domain of the Gods to begin with.</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan chose the work of setting up defensive arrays and the like.</p>

    <p>As for Wang Zhen... His job was relatively simple - it was to "take a beating," or put simply, he was MT<sup>1</sup>.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Most likely a reference to the "I'm MT" mobile game featuring an angry, knife-wielding cow was the titular character.)</dfn>

    <p>After Gu Shunzhi reconfirmed their route, he then led the Number 60 High group through the jungle. "Nine Dragon Mountain's rainbow mist can swallow up our spirit energy, and it'll only dissipate after eight in the morning. Everyone, make sure to use the turtle-breathing skill; not only will it hide our auras, it'll also prevent us from inhaling the rainbow mist."</p>

    <p>"Awesome." Chen Chao and Guo Hao marveled at Gu Shunzhi's power of perception.</p>

    <p>"Everyone's the same; we all have abilities that we're particularly good at." Gu Shunzhi played down his ability.</p>

    <p>"There might not be any enemies nearby, but ultimately, this location is too remote. If we can't replenish our supplies, it'll be very hard for ten people to make it through eight days by just relying on what we brought in," Sun Rong said at that moment. Cultivators could regulate their internal energy consumption. A cultivator in seclusion could go for more than ten days without food or water, but it was another matter when it came to vigorous activities.</p>

    <p>The crux, furthermore, was that the life-saving golden talisman wrapped around their arms could in fact speed up the consumption of physical energy and abilities. Now that this consumption rate had increased, they weren't any different to regular people, and had to eat three meals a day to keep up their stamina.</p>

    <p>The officials had deliberately set it up this way to prevent the student participants from lying low in one place for too long, thereby forcing them to go out for food.</p>

    <p>"The officials set up points where we can fight for supplies. Our advantage is that there's no one nearby, but we're quite some distance from any supply points," Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"Supply points? There's something like that?" Guo Hao was baffled.</p>

    <p>"There was a map of Nine Dragon Mountain on the back of the check-in book listing items of note in the room. It had all the supply contest points on it. You actually didn't see it?" Sun Rong had a helpless expression on her face. She made a hand seal, and mist gathered in the air.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong cultivated water spells. Wherever there was mist, she could collect it into beads, and then further condense them into water.</p>

    <p>After building a water screen in front of their eyes, Sun Rong displayed the map she had gotten from the dormitory onto the screen.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao analyzed the map. "There are twenty supply points on the map, and we're sixty kilometers away from the closest one. Moving stealthily will slow us down a lot.</p>

    <p>"Even if we do get there without being exposed, there's a high chance that other people will grab the supplies first. One of my uncles said before that in guerrilla warfare like this, if the enemy stops, harass them; if the enemy is weary, attack them; if the enemy advances, retreat; if the enemy retreats, pursue<sup>2</sup>. I think that rather than grabbing the supplies at the supply points, how about we lie in wait and grab them from other people?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(From Chairman Mao.)</dfn>

    <p>As soon as he stopped speaking, there was a violent explosion in the jungle...</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi quickly determined the location. "There's a fight taking place ten kilometers southwest of here."</p>

    <p>"Go! Go and take a look!" Liu Qingyi was a little excited.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>At the back of the group, Wang Ling wore a helpless expression on his face.</p>

    <p>He wondered if Gu Shunzhi and the other bigwigs really needed to be this serious...</p>
