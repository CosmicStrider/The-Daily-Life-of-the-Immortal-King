  <h1>Chapter 277 Brother Toya Is Also Full of Vigor Today! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>A normal spirit sword would lose contact with its master when they were too far away from each other, but Jingke was different; Wang Ling could sense his aura anywhere and anytime.</p>

    <p>This was the benefit of improving rapport with a spirit sword's sword spirit through monthly cultivation.</p>

    <p>Sitting on his bed, Wang Ling carefully felt for Jingke's aura. It was as if he had a radar in his head, and he knew exactly where Jingke was.</p>

    <p>Before even an hour was up, Lord Diulei saw Wang Ling open his eyes, and he asked, "How is it, Brother Ling? Any news?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling drew a map with the Memory Sketching Skill, and then marked a location on it with a red dot.</p>

    <p>"This is..." Lord Diulei frowned. He never thought that Immortal Mansion's final stronghold would actually be in Winter city.</p>

    <p>Winter city's location was relatively special. It was in the extreme north of Huaxiu nation, and happened to be diametrically opposite to Little Black's border laboratory, both of them situated on two ends of the map.</p>

    <p>The reason why Winter city was so special was that an ordinary person wasn't able to endure the cold there, so basically no ordinary people lived there. Various merchants in the cultivation circle who dealt in magic treasures hated this place, because as soon as a magic treasure was taken out of storage there, it would straightaway freeze; there was no way for low-grade magic treasures to survive in Winter city.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei had previously speculated on many possible locations for Immortal Mansion's headquarters, but he had never considered Winter city. While it was a very deplorable environment, Winter city was very suitable for cultivation, and a lot of Huaxiu's cultivation military troops were stationed there; based on common sense, no dark force would dare establish itself there.</p>

    <p>But he had miscalculated.</p>

    <p>"It actually is Winter city." The young man in white pursed his lips. He should have thought of it sooner!</p>

    <p>Furthermore, although they now knew the location of Immortal Mansion's headquarters, getting there was a new problem.</p>

    <p>Winter city didn't have an airport, because in the past, many accidents had happened as a result of engines freezing over, so the general mode of transport to Winter city was the bullet train.</p>

    <p>"Can't you just teleport there?" Er Ha, who had been lying on the ground, said suddenly.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was utterly astounded. "Since when could Brother Toad talk?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "...I've always been able to speak, okay?!"</p>

    <p>"My apologies, I assumed that anyone who followed Brother Ling would be a tightly sealed oil bottle <sup>1</sup> Lord Diulei laughed. "There're a lot of troops stationed in Winter city, so outsiders are strictly monitored. Since Immortal Mansion's headquarters is there, it's very likely that their top brass are keeping their identities hidden. We can use third generation ID cards to take the bullet train. Going through regular channels is in fact the most dependable way. If Brother Ling teleports us there, it'll be very awkward if we get stopped by police wanting to verify our identities."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is a literal translation of
'menyouping,' the nickname
given to the character Zhang
Qilin in the novel series 'Tomb
Robbers,' who is a man of few
words ..)</dfn>

    <p>After saying this, he turned his gaze to Wang Ling. "What do you think, Brother Ling? Have you made up your mind?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed. He lifted his head and looked in the direction of Winter city.</p>

    <p>We'll do it your way.</p>

    <p>He communicated succinctly through telepathy as he looked at Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>Now that Wang Ling thought about it, it suddenly occurred to him that he had never taken the bullet train before in his life.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was June 26th on Monday in the tenth week of the semester.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had left a clone behind to go to school in his stead.</p>

    <p>The sky was just beginning to lighten when he arrived at Songhai Railway Station.</p>

    <p>At that time, the breakfast stalls were only just being set up, and the savoury crepes stall had only just started heating its stove. Wang Ling stepped into the VIP waiting hall specially set aside for cultivators. At this time of day, there weren't very many people around, but in an hour, the number of people in the regular waiting hall outside would skyrocket.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei had booked the train tickets for Winter city, and they would be departing at 6:40 am.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't have a habit of being late, and he preferred to arrive early.</p>

    <p>He lowered his head to look at the estimated time of arrival indicated on the train ticket. It was three hours by bullet train from here to Winter city. After those three hours, the dark force that had been harassing him all this time would completely disappear off the face of the earth.</p>

    <p>He drew in a deep breath as he looked at the ticket.</p>

    <p>He just wanted to live an uneventful life...</p>

    <p>Why did they have to force him to make a move...</p>

    <p>While he was pondering this, his wristwatch phone rang.</p>

    <p>It was Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, are you there yet? I just picked up Brother Luo, and we're on our way to the station now; we'll be there in about ten minutes! Cailian Zhenren from the group is also with us," he said. "Brother Toya isn't with us... hmm, he probably ran into some trouble. See if you can help him later, Brother Ling."</p>

    <p>"???" Wang Ling's expression was puzzled.</p>

    <p>"Well, you know that he has a fighting lion. Recently, it went into heat again..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling wore an astonished expression. "..." So toward its master, this fighting lion...?</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Brother Ling, don't be dirty... Brother Toya disturbed this fighting lion when it was in heat yesterday, so it's chomped down on his head and so far hasn't let go."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>About five minutes after Lord Diulei hung up the phone, Wang Ling saw a young man with a bloody upper torso and a fighting lion on his back enter the VIP waiting hall sedately. Just as Lord Diulei had said, this fighting lion had clamped onto Immortal Toya's head and refused to let go...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Forget Wang Ling, this was an extremely terrifying and shocking scene for anyone who saw it.</p>

    <p>There were security guards following Immortal Toya who looked like they wanted to stop him for breaking the "no pets in the waiting hall" rule, but were too afraid to come forward. In the end, they could only use a megaphone to give him a warning from a distance. "The gentleman in front! No pets are allowed in this waiting hall!"</p>

    <p>Agitated by the sharp sound of the megaphone, the fighting lion swept its gaze over this bunch of security guards out of the corner of its eye. Fine beads of sweat instantly broke out on their skin, and they didn't dare to speak after that.</p>

    <p>Each one of them looked like they wanted to cry but had no tears to shed... Mom, this fighting lion is scary!</p>

    <p>"Hi, Senior Ling!"</p>

    <p>The young man had sensed Wang Ling's aura. He raised his hand to greet Wang Ling from a distance.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Knowing that Wang Ling was in front of him, it seemed like Immortal Toya had found a lifeline. "Senior Ling... can you help me get it down?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling heaved a sigh, then deliberately moved around to approach Immortal Toya from the back as he slowly walked toward the fighting lion.</p>

    <p>Coming up behind the fighting lion, Wang Ling stuck out one finger and wrapped it in his aura before poking the lion's broad back.</p>

    <p>The jittery fighting lion was instantly so scared that all its hair stood on end, and it opened its mouth to let go of Immortal Toya before jumping down.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had frightened it so much that it curled up trembling on the ground.</p>

    <p>"Thank you, Senior Ling!" As if he had been granted an amnesty, the young man finally took in a breath of fresh air.</p>

    <p>Paying no attention to his disheveled appearance, he straightaway crouched down to rub the lower half of the fighting lion's body, then heaved a deep sigh. "Its heat is over... but it looks like from now on, it'll never go into heat again."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
