  <h1>Chapter 496 Anti-Cheat Punishment Software </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that there weren't likely to be many people who shared the same way of thinking as him, and this TTXS gave him a very familiar feeling.</p>

    <p>If only he could sense the other party's aura...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling mused in his heart. Just like Daoist Guang had said, spells didn't work in a digital game like this, except for the auxiliary spells which could enhance the six senses. Aural perception or the Heavenly Eye were of no use... A lot of cultivators liked to open their Heavenly Eye during a fight to avoid illusions since it could be used to strip away what was fake and leave what was real behind. But if you really ran into a Voldemort in a ghillie suit lying in the grass, the Heavenly Eye wouldn't be of any use at all.</p>

    <p>The first reason was that it was real data.</p>

    <p>The second reason was that Voldemorts really knew how to lay low...</p>

    <p>The only thing Wang Ling could do was use some minor spells like Daoist Guang had to enhance his hearing and sight. Casting a spell on himself technically wasn't a cheat; it could be considered a strategic "physical, external cheat," just like how some players liked to rig a focal lens in front of the computer to create a magnified effect.</p>

    <p>But in a light-hearted contest like a water friends match, Wang Ling knew that there would definitely be cheaters, and more than just one of them.</p>

    <p>That was when how good the software you bought mattered.</p>

    <p>When Lord Diulei and Wang Ling landed, the total number of people on the screen had already dropped to eighty.</p>

    <p>It hadn't even been three minutes since the start of the game.</p>

    <p>One player with the ID SNAKE had already appeared in a stream of kill notifications; furthermore, almost all of his kills had been headshots.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, someone's using cheats... what should we do?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei looked at the screen and his lips twitched. He didn't need to read the bullet messages to know that everyone was definitely already swearing.</p>

    <p>"Fuck! Still want to use cheats in this type of match! Everyone just wants to play with Lord Island, so rotten!"</p>

    <p>"Lord Island, please check this ID and don't let him take part in the water friends match next time..."</p>

    <p>"I'm guessing this person is probably a fan of another live streamer and deliberately came over here to cause trouble!"</p>

    <p>The water friends whom this SNAKE had killed at the beginning of the game rushed to the live stream room one after another and sent their complaints in bullet messages to Lord Island.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't pay too much attention to them. When they landed, Lord Diulei followed Wang Ling into a building to pick up some things. They only searched one floor, but managed to pick up bulletproof vests, helmets, rifles and x scopes... When they reached the second floor, they opened the door to one room and immediately found First Aid Kits, painkillers and energy drinks...</p>

    <p>After a two-minute search of the building, Wang Ling and Lord Diulei were fully equipped just like that, with level three outfits, a sniper rifle and a rifle each, frying pans that hung behind them, and knapsacks full of ammunition and heal items.</p>

    <p>Why were they so lucky today?</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was stunned. "..."</p>

    <p>When he had played solo in the past, he had had to plunder several buildings one after another before finding what he wanted. The biggest headache was that there were a lot of times when he couldn't find a backpack, so even if he did find something, he couldn't pick it up!</p>

    <p>The truth was that this had to do with the ongoing effect of the Great Fortune Spell that Wang Ling had cast previously.</p>

    <p>Of course, this effect would vanish today.</p>

    <p>This was why Wang Ling thought that games were really boring...</p>

    <p>In this game, the majority of players delighted in focusing on looking for supplies and accessories, and then wiping out other players after that.</p>

    <p>But for Wang Ling, as long as the Great Fortune Spell was in effect, the fun of finding supplies no longer existed.</p>

    <p>Since the start of the game, the only fun Wang Ling had experienced so far was parachuting down.</p>

    <p>This thing was just like a parachuting simulator...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At that time, Lord Diulei looked at the number of people left. Six minutes had passed in the game, and only sixty people remained. The player with the ID "SNAKE" was still using his cheat to wildly slaughter other water friends.</p>

    <p>The water friends grumbled incessantly, and this mysterious SNAKE who had come out of nowhere sent a brazen, high priority bullet message in the live stream room: "I'm on the iron tower at the airfield. If you think you can stick your head out, expose it if you dare, I'll kill you!"</p>

    <p>Except for the number one fan in the live stream room, the rest of the water friends had to fork out money to send a high priority bullet message, at fifty HNY per message.</p>

    <p>The live stream room completely exploded with bullet messages.</p>

    <p>"Fuck! Too arrogant!"</p>

    <p>"Are the people who use cheats nowadays all this abusive?"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, should we go punish this player?" Lord Diulei sighed.</p>

    <p>The building they were in right now was in fact within range of the airfield, though it was on the fringes.</p>

    <p>However, they actually weren't far from the iron tower that SNAKE had mentioned. The tower was in fact a tall crane next to office building C in the center of the airfield map, and the players commonly called it " <em>youtiao </em>."</p>

    <p>The terrain here was very high and it was the easiest position from which to kill people.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei wanted to go punish this player who was using cheats, and Wang Ling actually wasn't really against it. Lord Diulei was in his team and was thus involuntarily covered in the halo of the Great Fortune Spell.</p>

    <p>The balance of fortune was on their side; even if someone was using cheats, the player wouldn't be able to kill them.</p>

    <p>But not long after Lord Diulei's words, there was another notification on the public screen...</p>

    <p><em>Player "TTXS" used "UZI" to kill player "SNAKE" with a headshot.</em></p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Lord Diulei never imagined that before they could make a move, this SNAKE would already be punished by someone else!</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling noticed that the person who killed SNAKE was actually the "TTXS" he had taken note of earlier...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, in the study at the Wang family's small villa, Father Wang cheered. "Beautiful, Little Ming!"</p>

    <p>Father Wang had long guessed that most of the players in this water friends match would likely use cheats, so before this, he had already gotten Little Ming to research anti-cheat punishment software. Wang Ming had in fact used his side account to secretly infiltrate this group of one hundred people for this water friends match. It was Father Wang who had arranged this in advance.</p>

    <p>Father Wang's and Wang Ming's voice windows were currently connected.</p>

    <p>"Hehe, Uncle Wang, you flatter me, it was a piece of cake."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming laughed in a very magnetic voice. "But I also overlooked some things. When I'd spent three minutes designing this anti-cheat software, I accidentally left out the reverse tracking mechanism, so I didn't have a way to determine the location of these cheaters. After I disposed of this cheater, it took me ten seconds just now to add this mechanism."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang sweated a little.</p>

    <p>"But this kind of cheater probably unlocked infinite health, right?" Lie Mengmeng asked.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming shook his head. "No use. My bullets are invincible. They can kill with headshots, even with a pistol."</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng: "..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang's laugh was like a lotus opening up. "Ha ha ha ha! That's really great! Those cheaters are the worst!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "Don't worry, uncle, you can just play, I'll deal with the cheaters."</p>

    <p>"Mm."</p>

    <p>Father Wang nodded, reassured. "But then again... can those players who died earlier be resurrected?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "Uncle Wang, you want to resurrect them? No problem!"</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng was startled. "The hell?! Is that possible?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming's tone was very confident. "As long as their deaths were caused by cheaters, it's not a problem. I just need to write a plugin for my anti-cheat punishment software."</p>

    <p>Father Wang and Lie Mengmeng: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "I'll call this plugin: Samsara of Heavenly Life <sup>1</sup> !"</p>

    <p>Father Wang and Lie Mengmeng: "..."</p>
