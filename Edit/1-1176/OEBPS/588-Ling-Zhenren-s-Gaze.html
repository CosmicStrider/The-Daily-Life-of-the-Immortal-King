  <h1>Chapter 588 Ling Zhenren's Gaze</h1>

  <div>

    <p>About ten minutes ago.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling glanced at the time; it was close to half an hour since Er Ha had returned to the demon world, and he didn't know whether things were going smoothly for Er Ha.</p>

    <p>Although Er Ha had the golden light shield buff, Wang Ling was still a little worried. There were too many uncertainties in the demon world. Especially after learning about Demon Saint in Lao Gudong's history class, Wang Ling had had a bad feeling.</p>

    <p>At this thought, Wang Ling went over to Lord Ma right away. At a crook of his finger, the toilet lid opened. At Wang Ling's telepathic command, Lord Ma directly projected an image of Er Ha in the demon world in the air.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling just so happened to see Er Ha give Daoist Horse Face a flying kick in the forehead.</p>

    <p>Daoist Horse Face flew into a rage and was prepared to strike back. But just as he charged forward, in the peace consulate, everyone's expressions changed as if they had seen something frightening. One by one, they lifted their heads to look to the horizon.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling opened the water tank behind Lord Ma and observed the change in water level. Not only did Lord Ma have the ability to transport someone, it could project an image of the person in question as well as detect the pressure surrounding them.</p>

    <p>And the water level in Lord Ma's water tank changed in response to the pressure in Er Ha's surrounding environment.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling opened the water tank, he found that the water level was fast approaching the critical point, which had never happened before.</p>

    <p>To be able to discharge such an oppressive force, it was extremely likely that this person was a True Immortal. Furthermore, Wang Ling speculated that the source of this pressure wasn't ordinary and that it was this "Daoist Horse Face" who had triggered some restriction.</p>

    <p>The result was as Wang Ling expected. Several minutes later, he watched indifferently as Daoist Horse Face was killed by this demon world restriction and reduced to demon sand.</p>

    <p>There was no mistake.</p>

    <p>This was without doubt Demon Saint's oppressive force, which was something Wang Ling had also determined from the conversation the people were having at the scene.</p>

    <p>After that Daoist Horse Face's death, the other two territory envoys immediately made a request of Demon Saint in the hope that he would eliminate Er Ha, which made Wang Ling's expression change slightly... If they wanted to beat a dog, they needed to know who its owner was first!</p>

    <p>"Look for the source of Demon Saint's restriction," Wang Ling said telepathically to Lord Ma.</p>

    <p>"Understood." Lord Ma obeyed immediately. This type of thing was in fact too easy for Lord Ma to do; this was a type of major reverse tracking spell, and among all the gremlins in the villa, only Lord Ma had this ability.</p>

    <p>It didn't take long at all for Lord Ma to lock onto Demon Saint's location. From Lord Ma's image projection, Wang Ling could see a towering pillar like the Sea-Stabilizing Needle <sup>1</sup> piercing the clouds above. The entire pillar was engraved with odd designs that were so refined it was as if they had been supernaturally crafted. This had to be the legendary Holy Pillar where Demon Saint lived, in the center of the demon world.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Later known as the Golden Cudgel, this is the Monkey King's weapon in "Journey to The West .. ")</dfn>

    <p>On the very top of the Holy Pillar, Wang Ling saw a blue-skinned fatty looking down. He was wearing navy blue Daoist robes and had a magic staff grasped in one hand. His skin was covered in fish scales that glittered brightly.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling never expected the legendary Demon Saint to truly be a merman!</p>

    <p>From the projection, he saw Demon Saint ponder Daoist Bronze Turtle and Daoist Witch Demon's request, the magic staff in his hand.</p>

    <p>This magic staff's origin wasn't simple, and with one glance, Wang Ling could tell that it was a world-defying magic weapon which could control the overall situation in the demon world. It was this magic staff that had triggered Demon Saint's restriction to directly destroy Daoist Horse Face.</p>

    <p>"Warn him." Wang Ling spoke telepathically as he gave Lord Ma the command.</p>

    <p>Right after Wang Ling said that, Lord Ma directly manipulated its power to create a golden cloud in front of Demon Saint who was still in deep thought.</p>

    <p>This was a golden cloud produced by a tremendous amount of spirit power.</p>

    <p>On the Holy Pillar, Demon Saint was flabbergasted. There were fully ninety thousand barriers from the demon territories at the bottom up to the pinnacle! Moreover, the space at the top of the Holy Pillar was sealed off; even telepathy wouldn't work there, let alone space transference, and any magic under grade ten would be no use at all.</p>

    <p>What was going on with this golden cloud?</p>

    <p>Demon Saint was blank. He waved the magic staff and tried launching a probing attack when the golden cloud created by Lord Ma promptly struck back and the hand holding the magic staff instantly turned numb as if it had been electrocuted.</p>

    <p>Demon Saint immediately broke out in a cold sweat.</p>

    <p>He was now one hundred percent sure that this golden cloud was at the very least a grade eleven spell.</p>

    <p>Good thing he had held back just now and hadn't used all his strength to drive this cloud away, otherwise he truly would have been on the brink of courting death.</p>

    <p>But... what on earth was this golden cloud which had suddenly appeared?</p>

    <p>Demon Saint was stupefied.</p>

    <p>Several dozen seconds later, Lord Ma's voice came out of the golden cloud.</p>

    <p>Lord Ma proclaimed Wang Ling's will. "I serve the Supreme King, and am here to advise thee to stay your hand, otherwise today will be the day of thy death."</p>

    <p>The truth was, this golden cloud wasn't anything special in Wang Ling's eyes; it was just a very simple grade twelve telepathy spell.</p>

    <p>But at Lord Ma's words, cold sweat instantly ran down this merman Demon Saint's face.</p>

    <p>The penetrating pressure of this voice was too frightening.</p>

    <p>A simple sentence almost directly sent Demon Saint to his knees.</p>

    <p>He was a peak True Immortal! He wielded the power of the Holy Pillar and behind him was all the power of the demon world. He was vastly different from regular peak True Immortals; he was a figure who stood for the will of the entire demon world!</p>

    <p>Usually, the power of an entire world's will was on par with ten Heavenly Dao!</p>

    <p>However, he couldn't help trembling at the voice that came out of this golden cloud.</p>

    <p>The Supreme King...</p>

    <p>Who on earth was that?</p>

    <p>Demon Saint struggled to rein in his terror as he looked at the golden cloud. "May I ask which divine saint senior is?"</p>

    <p>Lord Ma: "The Supreme King declines to speak with you. You are still not worthy enough."</p>

    <p>But after Lord Ma said this, an image was suddenly reflected on this golden cloud... It was a pair of eyes! Ling Zhenren was gazing at him!</p>

    <p><em>Clatter </em>...</p>

    <p>Demon Saint was so frightened he dropped the magic staff in his hand!</p>

    <p>Between the strong, there were times when they didn't rely on just aura to determine the gap in power; there were times when eye contact was a more direct way to do so.</p>

    <p>The moment their eyes met, Demon Saint could already sense the huge difference in strength...</p>

    <p>He was so frightened he went soft at the knees!</p>

    <p>He wasn't a fool and could more or less guess who this "senior" was.</p>

    <p>Perhaps this was the owner of that green-furred spirit dog down below.</p>

    <p>A wise man submitted to circumstances, and Demon Saint was an astute man.</p>

    <p>This person was more powerful than he was, and he definitely couldn't provoke him. Otherwise, the demon world might fall into eternal damnation...</p>

    <p>So after some quick consideration, Demon Saint made his own decision.</p>

    <p>He sent a reply to Daoist Bronze Turtle and Daoist Witch Demon down below.</p>

    <p>The first sentence was: <em>Deal with private matters yourself.</em></p>

    <p>The second sentence was: <em>Not my damn business...</em></p>
