  <h1>Chapter 587 Demon Saint Is An Astute Person</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After Er Ha said this, the envoys from the other three territories and Elder Wen on the side were stupefied.</p>

    <p>A spirit beast...</p>

    <p>They had actually overlooked this point!</p>

    <p>This dog's fur was such a strange color, as if it had been poisoned, but it was actually a spirit beast?</p>

    <p>The three envoys found it a little hard to believe. But when Daoist Witch Demon and Daoist Bronze Turtle used their senses to feel this dog out, both of them couldn't help looking shaken; the spirit energy which this dog had was so pure it was scary. Plenty of Soul Formation cultivators had intruded into the demon world over the years, and their strength was on par with demon kings. However, none of them had spirit energy as scarily refined as this dog.</p>

    <p>And what was even more frightening was the golden light shield wrapped around Er Ha.</p>

    <p>So here was the question: Where did this golden light shield come from? Did this dog create it itself? Only a Sage Body had this kind of power...</p>

    <p>"What on earth is this dog?" Daoist Witch Demon and Daoist Bronze Turtle were scared at this sight, but very quickly they realized that this wasn't the main issue.</p>

    <p>The main issue was that Demon Saint's restriction punishment was about to descend.</p>

    <p>No one had ever truly seen what it was like.</p>

    <p>Daoist Horse Face could still talk earlier, but after a few seconds, he couldn't even open his mouth anymore as his entire face was bent out of shape.</p>

    <p>Although Demon Saint had withdrawn the pressure on the others and was only punishing the person who had violated the rule, Daoist Witch Demon and Daoist Bronze Turtle could still feel the surge of that overwhelming stately power in the air; it was an endless spiritual oppression which engulfed the whole scene, as if it was going to sweep everything away.</p>

    <p>"Demon Saint... is really mad..."</p>

    <p>Daoist Witch Demon and Daoist Bronze Turtle couldn't help trembling. They were terrified when they looked at Daoist Horse Face lying on the floor, his face so twisted it was starting to look like a Picasso. They could in fact see that he was crying for help as well as the despair in his eyes.</p>

    <p>"Lord Demon Saint, please calm down. Fellow Horse Face didn't break the peace consulate's rule on purpose, he doesn't deserve to die for it!" Daoist Witch Demon thought quickly and sent up a pray to Demon Saint for mercy.</p>

    <p>"That's right, it's all the fault of this foreign dog! Lord Demon Saint, please reconsider!" Daoist Bronze Turtle on the side copied Daoist Witch Demon.</p>

    <p>All of a sudden, Demon Saint's hollow voice reverberated in the air as it came from some unknown direction and lingered like an echo in the ears. "The disobedient should die."</p>

    <p>Daoist Witch Demon quivered.</p>

    <p>Getting a grip on his intense fear, he continued to plead for leniency. "Is... is there an alternative to this punishment?"</p>

    <p>"There is."</p>

    <p>Demon Saint's voice rang out all around them once more. "The two of you, die in his place."</p>

    <p>At these words, Daoist Witch Demon and Daoist Bronze Turtle immediately stepped back and bowed to the sky with their hands clasped in front of them. "Lord Demon Saint, please execute Horse Face this renegade at once!"</p>

    <p>Daoist Horse Face: "???"</p>

    <p>After saying that, intangible stately power fell directly on Daoist Horse Face, who lay thoroughly deformed on the floor. His entire body twisted up completely before he directly turned into demon sand on the spot and abruptly perished.</p>

    <p>Demon sand was a substance that formed only after a demon's corpse was incinerated, like bone ash. Who could have imagined that before the power of Demon Saint's restriction, a territory envoy with strength on par with a demon king would be directly turned into sand without even leaving a body behind, every last part of it annihilated.</p>

    <p>Every single person who saw this scene in the peace consulate, including Er Ha, was utterly horrified. No one had truly ever seen what Demon Saint's restriction punishment was like.</p>

    <p>Now everyone knew...</p>

    <p>This was power which they couldn't fight against at all.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Neither Daoist Witch Demon nor Daoist Bronze Turtle had expected this situation. They didn't know whether they should be shocked or glad; Demon Saint's restriction was too powerful, but it hadn't fallen on them. If they had disobeyed Demon Saint's will, they would definitely have ended up like Daoist Horse Face!</p>

    <p>But the thing that frightened them the most was how decisive and cold-blooded Demon Saint was; this was the strength of the absolute ruler of the current demon world, and no one was allowed to go against his will.</p>

    <p>A demon god might not be able to survive this restriction, let alone a territory envoy!</p>

    <p>Daoist Horse Face had died such an unjust and miserable death!</p>

    <p>Er Ha gazed at the demon sand and gave a sigh. In truth, as a civil servant of the demon world, Daoist Horse Face's efforts might not necessarily have borne fruit even if he worked for all his life. Dying like this in fact wasn't a bad end; at the very least, his name would go down in the history of the demon world...</p>

    <p>Perhaps in a month or two, Daoist Horse Face's portrait would be printed in the history textbooks of the demon world...</p>

    <p>It would say: A practicing civil servant of one of the major demon territories, and the first person in the history of the demon world to verify the existence of Demon Saint's restriction on the peace consulate by knowingly violating the rule: Daoist Horse Face.</p>

    <p>"Daoist Witch Demon, Daoist Bronze Turtle, how about we stop here for today? Why don't the both of you go back first and take Daoist Horse Face's demon sand with you; it'll be best to sort that out first before you come back here again. It's still warm now, it won't be good if you wait until it gets cold." Er Ha blushed with shame in its heart at Elder Wen's "kind reminder"; he was still as poison-tongued and merciless as always!</p>

    <p>Daoist Witch Demon and Daoist Bronze Turtle were infuriated; they naturally just couldn't leave things as they were - they had lost an important general!</p>

    <p>In the previous 3v1 situation, they had actually been very confident that they could capture Elder Wen. But who knew when Elder Wen had started "colluding" with this green-furred dog that had shown up. Furthermore, Daoist Horse Face had been struck dead by Demon Saint's restriction, so the situation had become much more complicated!</p>

    <p>And crucially, deep down, they could still sense Demon Saint's pressure...</p>

    <p>Perhaps, he was still monitoring the situation...</p>

    <p>Since the restriction did indeed exist, there was no way they would start a fight in the peace consulate.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Daoist Bronze Turtle suddenly thought of something: Maybe they could eliminate this green-furred dog first through Demon Saint!</p>

    <p>At this thought, he looked up at the sky and beseeched, "Lord Demon Saint! Are you still here? Elder Wen He of the Tuntian Ha clan in the eastern territory is colluding with a spirit beast! We came here to uphold justice and peace and never intended to personally start a fight! Lord Demon Saint, please drive off this foreign spirit dog!"</p>

    <p>The corners of Er Ha's and Elder Wen's mouths twitched when they heard this: They came to uphold justice and peace...</p>

    <p>This guy still had the nerve to say such a thing?!</p>

    <p>After Daoist Bronze Turtle said this, Demon Saint's voice sounded: "Deal with private matters yourself..."</p>

    <p>Roughly two minutes passed.</p>

    <p>Demon Saint's voice rang out again. Short and succinct, he simply said four words: "Not my damn business."</p>

    <p>Both Er Ha and Elder Wen were taken aback - this Demon Saint was an astute person!</p>
