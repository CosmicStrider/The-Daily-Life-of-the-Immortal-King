  <h1>Chapter 639 Immortal Zhenyuan's Crisis</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Although Xiao Yin was usually a little dumb, there was one thing he had gotten right; the reason why Lord Diulei hadn't come in this time mostly had to do with "broccoli"!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei felt that he hadn't brought enough!</p>

    <p>Master Yuan Long Ping, father of magic rice, had been able to produce a crop of a hundred and eighty million jin of immortal rice in an extremely dry and inhospitable desert environment without needing to use gold earth. How advanced was this agricultural technology? Also, the most important thing was that this master hadn't patented this technology. If he had done so, he would have easily become the richest person in the world. But he hadn't! Since the beginning, this master had worked for the benefit of all mankind. What kind of high noble character was this?</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei felt utterly inferior to him.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When Xiao Yin went upstairs, he found Er Ha already waiting for him. Since Master was reading at his desk, Xiao Yin didn't dare bother him at all; Er Ha had told him early on that it was taboo to distract Master when he was reading or doing revision.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was a little disappointed, because he had brought the collar and the leash with him! Looking at the current situation, however, there wasn't any chance to use them at all!</p>

    <p>It seemed he would have to look for another opportunity later.</p>

    <p>Er Ha made a "hush" gesture at him and then wagged its tail as it led Xiao Yin to the bathroom. Because Er Ha had already used Lord Ma once, it was now adept at activating it.</p>

    <p>Since Wang Ling had used Lord Ma once before to visit Drought Star, it already had a record of the planet's coordinates.</p>

    <p>With Er Ha making another trip there, Lord Ma could immediately transport them.</p>

    <p>When Xiao Yin followed Er Ha over and saw the toilet lid slowly open, his expression was astounded. "Is this a toilet gremlin enlightened by Master?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Ma: "..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "You should call it Lord Ma."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "What do we need to do for the transfer? Drink water?"</p>

    <p>Lord Ma almost passed out at hearing this. This person was also a contract beast, but why was this holy beast so dim-witted...</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "No need, just wait for the transfer to happen. In a while, the golden transport light will fall on you."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin nodded his head. "I see..." He had in fact seen plenty of transference magic artifacts before, but most of them had built-in arrays. However, he couldn't see the slightest trace of an array setup on Lord Ma, which amazed him greatly!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, on Drought Star, Immortal Zhenyuan was more than halfway done with restoration works on the planet. Wind Spirit had wrecked such widespread destruction; by using the power of the primordial qi stored in the heart demon stone for the restoration works, not only was Immortal Zhenyuan atoning for carelessly causing his inner demon Wind Spirit to manifest, it was a way to absolve the latter of his crimes.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, his inner demon hadn't fully taken shape. Before it completely devoured the original body, it was unable to stray too far from it. This was why Immortal Zhenyuan had done all he could to stay away from the human world, to prevent his inner demon from hatching wicked plots and committing unforgivable sins against it. But in the past several thousand years, Wind Spirit had secretly activated the Gate Between Worlds, which had led to misunderstandings between the demon world and the human world and which had caused major losses for both sides.</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan had already come up with a way to make up for this.</p>

    <p>After restoring Drought Star, he was going to contact the human cultivators and give them the planet. He hoped it would become the first suitable third-party planet on which humans and demons could live in peace together.</p>

    <p>Wiping at his sweat, Immortal Zhenyuan observed the restoration progress from where he hovered in the air. Drought Star's surface was basically done; furthermore, Immortal Zhenyuan had neatly smoothed over the original cracks in the dry earth caused by a lack of water.</p>

    <p>During the restoration works, he also hadn't forgotten to put down water-type magic arrays in the drier areas of Drought Star to ensure that the soil there was moist enough.</p>

    <p>Restoring the earth surface as well as creating a more stable ecological environment had kept him occupied all these days.</p>

    <p>Hands on his waist, he nodded in satisfaction. "The last thing now is to mend the space fissures."</p>

    <p>The fissures had been created when a collision of advanced magic had torn the space apart, and were far trickier to fix compared with restoring the earth. Immortal Zhenyuan had thus decided to deal with it in one go after he was done with restoring the surface.</p>

    <p>The space fissures on Drought Star actually weren't that bad compared with those in the demon world. Although restoring space was a little more complicated, Immortal Zhenyuan estimated that he would be able to finish everything in a month.</p>

    <p>He took out a map which he had drawn before he started restoring the surface of the earth. On it, he had already marked places where he had seen space fissures.</p>

    <p>"I'll start with the location closest to me!"</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhen heaved a sigh; after confirming the closest target for restoration, he directly flew over.</p>

    <p>But the scene in front of him made him frown when he realized that there were actually two space fissures... If there were two, he would have made a note of it on the map back then.</p>

    <p>"Is this a newly-formed fissure?"</p>

    <p>Cupping his chin, he frowned as he gazed at it.</p>

    <p>He was just about to move closer for a look when he jerked and promptly fell back as his expression changed â€” he sensed a strange aura!</p>

    <p>An indescribable sense of danger emanated from the space fissure in front of him.</p>

    <p>"What's that?"</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan knitted his eyebrows; what the space fissure was emitting didn't seem to be demon qi or spirit qi. Instead, it felt like the "primordial qi" which he had a small amount of stored inside his body.</p>

    <p>"Can it be..." he frowned deeply and murmured to himself.</p>

    <p>He thought of one possibility...</p>

    <p>That was, what Second Generation Demon Saint had described before in the Holy Palace in the demon world, of a monster at the level of a vicious beast which had emerged from a mysterious space fissure.</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan felt that he was quite a careful person. If he had known that there were two space fissures here back when he had drawn the map, he definitely wouldn't have just marked one down on the map. This strange space fissure was newly-formed; furthermore, it contained an extremely dangerous aura.</p>

    <p>Just as he thought this, Immortal Zhenyuan suddenly saw a pitch-black fishtail poke out of the crack. It then turned, and a giant fish with black wings flew out of the space fissure and lunged at him...</p>
