  <h1>Chapter 98 Heard That the Parent-Teacher Conference Is the Cause of Roast Meat with Bamboo Shoots </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Close to the end of school, Guo Hao came up to Wang Ling and placed two bags of high-quality dog food on his desk. The bags with the three big words "Soul Servant Shop" on it didn't state a manufacturer, and only gave the date of manufacture and the expiry date.</p>

    <p>This dog food had been produced by Guo Hao's family. Wang Ling glanced at the date of manufacture and saw that it was yesterday â€” asking a pet shop to customize food for soul pets was actually quite a commonplace practice. With regard to Classmate Guo Hao, Wang Ling concluded that apart from his performance in his studies, Little Student Guo was nonetheless a faithful and reliable person.</p>

    <p>"I missed Er Ha a lot these two days without it around." As Guo Hao spoke, he pushed up his glasses out of habit. "These two bags of dog food were tailor-made for it. If it's not enough, come look for me to get more. Oh, by the way, the flavor is labeled in the bottom left corner of the bag."</p>

    <p>Hearing Guo Hao's words, Wang Ling immediately shifted his gaze for a look.</p>

    <p>In the bottom left corner of the white bag of dog food were the striking words "New Orleans Fly Flavor"...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling returned home, he found Father Wang smoking on the sofa. It had already been a full twenty-four hours since they had discovered the true identity of the old man's first love. It was clear that until now, Father Wang still hadn't come back to his senses from such a shocking fact.</p>

    <p>The most troublesome part in this matter was that it was purely the old man's one-sided love, so Wang Ling couldn't find an opportunity or excuse at all to get Teacher Pan to come out. The crucial point was that she was his teacher-in-charge. Even he thought that this was an impossible mission, and he had no idea where to start...</p>

    <p>Father Wang looked blankly at the old man, forever bustling around busily in the kitchen with Mother Wang, and heaved a deep sigh. "Ling Ling, about your grandfather's matter, try and think of something else. By the way... just now, your school sent a message to the group chat. There's a parent-teacher conference next Monday evening at six. Did you know about this?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling frowned; he had heard Teacher Pan mention it before in class, but hadn't expected it to be held so soon.</p>

    <p>Next Monday...</p>

    <p>Was the first dark Monday since the start of school about to happen?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling grumbled in his heart.</p>

    <p>For a child growing up, the parent-teacher conference was a vital part of education. Through direct interaction with class teachers, parents could readily learn from them how to make roast meat with bamboo shoots <sup>1</sup> taste better.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is obviously a food dish, but also a metaphor for spanking someone with a bamboo clapper board ..)</dfn>

    <p>Of course, compared with other people, Wang Ling had never dreaded the superficial show that was the parent-teacher conference.</p>

    <p>First, his grades were very unremarkable and right down the middle as required by Father and Mother Wang. That was why in past parent-teacher conferences, Wang Ling had almost never received any specific sort of evaluation from his teachers.</p>

    <p>Second, even if there were teachers who did single him out for criticism, Father and Mother Wang were powerless to do anything about it. Because... they couldn't physically punish him for the sake of his education. Shadow Stream's Red Ribbon killer, team leader Xu Ying, was a very good example why...</p>

    <p>The last thing was... actually, Wang Ling could count on his fingers the number of times that Father and Mother Wang had attended a parent-teacher conference, since most of the time, they found someone else to replace them.</p>

    <p>As expected, Wang Ling hadn't said anything before Father Wang picked up the newspaper on the coffee table and pushed up his glasses. "I've been very busy with my new book recently, so I have to stay home to type. Your Uncle Song has already been rushing me for my manuscript. Your mom has to take care of your grandfather, so she probably isn't free to go. So for the parent-teacher conference, just ask your friends to replace us as usual."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It wasn't time for the Wang family to eat yet, so Wang Ling returned to his bedroom feeling a little vexed. As soon as he entered, he saw Er Ha lying on the ground with a pen in its claws as it scrawled something in its diary.</p>

    <p>After Er Ha's spirit had been forced to take the form of a dog, it had gone from resisting and abandoning itself to despair in the beginning to now gradually accepting reality, which was definitely a U-turn in its attitude. Obviously, this guy had already started to adapt to human life.</p>

    <p>It was extremely inconvenient to hold a pen with claws. Even if Er Ha had used spirit energy to help unblock its veins and make its claws more flexible, it was still restricted by its physiology. It had wanted to practice writing in its diary at first, but after some consideration, it decided to start with simple drawings in order to improve its proficiency in using a pen.</p>

    <p>Er Ha had been practicing since the afternoon, and the trash can overflowed with unfinished drafts.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at the final drawing that had cost Er Ha several painstaking hours of practice; although the lines still weren't smooth and the whole picture still looked like a crude mosaic, from the composition of two circles and several triangles, Wang Ling could make out that what it had drawn was probably a sparrow.</p>

    <p>For a dog that could draw, this already wasn't a simple thing...</p>

    <p>Rubbing Er Ha's head, Wang Ling thought it simply was a waste of talent for this guy to not perform in the circus.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..." This picture is clearly a fucking parrot! That dumbass fucking bird Er Dan that bullies me every day!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..." Parrot, your ass! She bullies you every day but you still drew her. So it turns out you're a masochist!</p>

    <p>A person and a dog stared for a long time at this abstract portrait of a bird. Wang Ling already had no words to describe this drawing style...</p>

    <p>At this moment, he felt a slight vibration from his electronic wristwatch; surprisingly, someone had sent him a message at this time of day.</p>

    <p>Only a few people had Wang Ling's number, so he opened the message suspiciously. There were only a few short words in the message: "Brother Ling, contact me on QQ!"</p>

    <p>Without needing to check the number, he just looked at the ID and knew who had sent him this message... it was definitely Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>After he logged onto QQ, a chat window from Lord Diulei instantly popped up. "Brother Ling, I heard from the comrades in the group that you were looking for me? I'm really sorry. In order to help my junior brother, I went off to do something. That brother of mine had a lab that was destroyed by some bastard and I was actually going to talk it over with you. Shall we help my junior brother out by pulling that bastard out and beating him up?"</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling sent an ellipsis to confirm his existence.</p>

    <p>And then, looking at this string of text, he sunk into a long silence...</p>

    <p>Obviously, Lord Diulei was already used to this "Brother Ling" and his reticent manner. "About teaching this bastard a lesson, let's discuss it later. By the way, why was Brother Ling looking for me?"</p>

    <p>After a short silence, Wang Ling selected the "stone ghost mask" photo in his photo gallery and sent it.</p>

    <p>He then typed out a message which he sent with the photo. "This mask, have you seen it before?"</p>
