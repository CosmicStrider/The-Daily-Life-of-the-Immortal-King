  <h1>Chapter 921 Fighting Star Lord</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Star Lord of Divine Dao Star.</p>

    <p>Male.</p>

    <p>A member of the Divine Dragon clan.</p>

    <p>And a yandere.</p>

    <p>This was all the information on Star Lord that everyone had learned from Guo Ping so far.</p>

    <p>There were only two ways to fight a yandere.</p>

    <p><em>One: The yandere says he likes you → You accept → You live happily with the yandere.</em></p>

    <p><em>Two: The yandere says he likes you → You reject him → You die a violent death...</em></p>

    <p>But it was very clear that Divine Dao Star's Star Lord was a yandere of the highest level. He wouldn't even voluntarily say that he liked something; as long as he took a fancy to it, he had to have it.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling already understood the implications: if this matter wasn't properly resolved, a new Adam and Eve would appear on Divine Dao Star.</p>

    <p>"Whether he's a Divine Dragon or a little dragon, we won't know for sure until we fight him," Bai Qiao said.</p>

    <p>"Since Miss Bai has made up her mind, you naturally have my full support... but bear in mind, we must do this quickly; we're running out of time." Guo Ping frowned deeply. He operated his watch and a map spread out in the air. "The location marked with an asterisk is Star Lord's Divine Palace. Previously, I bought fake IDs off a lizard person who makes them. Should we sneak in and assassinate him?"</p>

    <p>"You want to act like Jingke who assassinated Emperor Qin? It doesn't have to be so troublesome." Bai Qiao shook her head and folded her arms. "We've always preferred a head-on approach."</p>

    <p>Guo Ping: "..."</p>

    <p>At that moment, he looked at the youngster with dead fish eyes. At the very beginning, the words "Beat up Star Lord" in his head had come from this youngster.</p>

    <p>But this youngster really looked very mediocre...</p>

    <p>Forget it. Teenagers were frivolous, anyway; it wasn't like Guo Ping couldn't understand.</p>

    <p>In any case, attacking Star Lord would in the end be up to Miss Bai Qiao.</p>

    <p>She was the strongest person on Earth, after all...</p>

    <p>As for the high school students who had been pulled into this thing on Divine Dao Star, Guo Ping had never counted on them for help from the start.</p>

    <p>What could high school students do?</p>

    <p>Finishing <em>Three Years of College Exams and Five Years of Simulations </em>was king!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time on Earth, cultivators at the Soul Formation stage and above all sensed a wave of energy which they had never felt before in the air... This was a force they had never seen before.</p>

    <p>General Yi was playing go with the head of state in the mountain pavilion.</p>

    <p>When the head of state put down a black stone, the chessboard actually broke and split into several parts.</p>

    <p>"Old Yi, this is very uncharitable of you. Don't tell me that you bought a magical chessboard that will explode as soon as you're about to lose... I didn't put this piece down that hard."</p>

    <p>"Your Excellency Head of State, you've misunderstood... My chessboard might be a Dong Qin product, but it truly has nothing to do with magic <sup>1</sup> at all. Your Excellency, you should have felt that strange fluctuation in the air." Dressed in his white exercise uniform and a red sash around his waist, General Yi raised his head.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A reference to Chinese host
Dong Qing, who hosted many
of CCTV's Spring Gala events,
which tended to have magic
acts.)</dfn>

    <p>"Something isn't right about this fluctuation." The head of state frowned, then turned his eyes to Steward Tang next to him. "Tang Chen, call both Huaxiu Alliance and the Office of Strategic Deception, and see if anyone is carrying out some sort of experiment."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At that very moment, all the researchers at the research institute were on standby.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming and Zhai Yin were rushing to the scene to carry out emergency repairs.</p>

    <p>Five minutes ago, the institute's surveillance instruments had suddenly gone haywire! This had never happened before... Even when the Gate Between Worlds descended back then, only a tenth of the instrument panel had been broken by the abnormal energy fluctuations.</p>

    <p>"Don't panic. Follow action plan number one, and bring the data gauges under control first," Wang Ming ordered, hands in his pockets. With his appearance, the scene started to gain some order.</p>

    <p>The appearance of the strongest brain naturally had a calming effect on staff morale as well.</p>

    <p>But in fact, Wang Ming's hands were sweating in his pockets...</p>

    <p>He had just gotten off the phone with President Qi.</p>

    <p>It wasn't just their research institute - the same anomaly was happening simultaneously in research institutes all over the world, and several satellites belonging to neighboring countries had fallen...</p>

    <p>This was an invasion of an unknown power...</p>

    <p>Wang Ming narrowed his eyes as he stared at the pointers jerking erratically on the instrument panel, a very heavy expression on his face.</p>

    <p>Things weren't looking good at all.</p>

    <p>Worse still, he had pinpointed Wang Ling's location earlier.</p>

    <p>His silly otouto was actually at the Office of Strategic Deception's new Internet cafe.</p>

    <p>The world was about to be destroyed, but he was still playing games!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>With Guo Ping providing long-range assistance and Bai Qiao leading the way, they left for Star Lord's Divine Palace in an alien aircraft which Guo Ping had specially modified. Guo Ping had salvaged this aircraft from a rubbish dump and then restored it using the planet's energy source; flying it wouldn't arouse the suspicions of the monsters.</p>

    <p>"We've already reached the BOSS level?"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao was surprised by how quickly the plot was developing. He frequently played flight simulation games, and was unexpectedly able to pilot the alien aircraft so smoothly.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao and Su Xiao sat in the front passenger seats.</p>

    <p>"So, whether we can clear the game is still up to Boss Bai? But why did your uncle leave this Easter egg indicating that Boss Bai is the one to fight Star Lord?" Su Xiao said.</p>

    <p>"Obviously, the game designer is a lolicon. Boss Bai is the only girl in our group, so she's the chosen one," Guo Hao replied.</p>

    <p>Until now, these three people still didn't know that this wasn't a game and that everything was real.</p>

    <p>But Bai Qiao didn't expose this fact.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sat quietly in the back of the spaceship. Divine Dao Star didn't have any spirit qi, but this wouldn't affect Bai Qiao and Fang Xing exhibiting their might, since Wang Ling's existence itself was like a portable spring of water.</p>

    <p>At the moment, Wang Ling looked like he was resting with his eyes closed, but he was in fact thinking about what kind of BUFF he should give everyone in the aircraft.</p>

    <p>This Star Lord was going to be difficult to deal with, after all.</p>

    <p>They naturally couldn't take this battle lightly.</p>

    <p>Thus, as the aircraft approached Star Lord's Divine Palace, Chen Chao and the others suddenly noticed many colorful halos on them...</p>

    <p>"What's this?" Guo Hao asked.</p>

    <p>Looks like a BUFF..." Chen Chao said.</p>

    <p>Su Xiao swallowed. "Is this the legendary boost before battle?"</p>

    <p>At that moment, at the back of the aircraft, Wang Ling was silently reciting spells.</p>

    <p>"Supreme power selfless halo...</p>

    <p>"Ultra-divine wisdom magic halo...</p>

    <p>"Holy ultimate barrier...</p>

    <p>"Almighty's indomitable heart...</p>

    <p>"Shitty, shameless, thick-skinned like an iron wall delayed updates halo...</p>

    <p>"The Healer, Wildness and Distant Pupils poisonous milk death barrier <sup>2</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(The Healer and Distant Pupils
are two Qidian writers who
are notorious for somehow
jinxing any authors or works
they recommend.)</dfn>

    <p>"The power of Dong Qing's cover-up, the strongest in the world <sup>3</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(Chinese host Dong Qing was
criticized for acting as a shill
for Chinese magician Liu Qian
at the 2010 Spring Festival
Gala.)</dfn>

    <p>"The overwhelming gravity of being three catties heavier at every festival...</p>

    <p>"Vigorous dancing before Desolation Heavenly Emperor's <sup>4</sup> grave revival magic halo..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>4</sup>(The protagonist's nickname in
the Chinese web novel
"Perfect World .. ")</dfn>
