  <h1>Chapter 665 All For One!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The news of Elder Yin's death reached Elder Ji Xing in the military tent very quickly. Everyone in the Demon Hunters Association had a soul mark which would instantly disappear when a person was confirmed dead.</p>

    <p>Elder Ji Xing was no exception.</p>

    <p>When Elder Zuo Wu died previously, President Bai had directly turned to leave even without confirming Elder Zuo Wu's death precisely because he had clearly sensed the disappearance of the soul mark. But it wasn't as if it was permanent. This soul mark was a once-off; neither President Bai nor Elder Ji Xing could have expected Elder Zuo Wu to later come back to life on the spot.</p>

    <p>Not only could the Soul Suppression Ring reconstruct the body, it could even perfectly restore the soul, which meant remaking the state of Elder Zuo Wu's soul. Therefore, when Elder Zuo Wu was resurrected, the soul mark in his body also disappeared.</p>

    <p>After a night of rest, Elder Ji Xing's queasy situation had subsided a little, but the instant he saw Elder Yin's soul mark disappear, he suddenly felt unwell again.</p>

    <p>"How did this happen?" Elder Ji Xing grit his teeth.</p>

    <p>Who would have thought Elder Yin would actually die just like that. In order to capture Zhuo Yi before their operation, the Demon Hunters Association had already clearly determined this Director Zhuo's route to work a long time ago to ensure that they could attack when the other party's defense was at its weakest. Moreover, Elder Yin was a decisive person who usually did everything flawlessly. Coupled with Little Rongnu's quick and violent attacks, taking care of two Golden Core cultivators should have only required a flick of his finger.</p>

    <p>Yet, Elder Yin still died...</p>

    <p>The operation to capture Director Zhuo this time had only been a temporary measure they came up with after their plan was delayed; because of Elder Ji Xing's misfortune last night, the plan had been delayed by a day.</p>

    <p>So Elder Ji Xing added a new element to his vicious "revenge plan"— he had decided to capture all those people who had offended the Demon Hunters Association and take them to Number 60 High School. When the revenge plan was launched tomorrow, these people would be publicly executed!</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, they had started on the wrong foot: Elder Yin, who had been the first to be dispatched, had inexplicably been the first to die...</p>

    <p>"Sonico, what should we do now..." the person called Erzhu asked on the side.</p>

    <p>"Send someone to retrieve Elder Yin's body; I want Yaren to do this." At the mention of this name, Elder Ji Xing's stomach started to hurt again, and he did his best to calm down before he looked at Erzhu. "How is Elder Poisonous Dragon?"</p>

    <p>"It's proceeding smoothly, he found that Great Death-Courting Senior's place without a hitch. This person is just a Soul Formation cultivator, I believe that Elder Poisonous Dragon will deal with him very quickly."</p>

    <p>"Mm."</p>

    <p>Elder Ji Xing nodded.</p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon was someone whom they had specially chosen as the best person to handle Lord Diulei and Xiao Yin.</p>

    <p>On Sun Island, Elder Poisonous Dragon was famous for his technique "Lightning Poisonous Dragon Drill <sup>1</sup> ." While studying on Sun Island, he developed various other powerful derivative skills based on this technique, such as "Mount Lu Rising Dragon Drill <sup>2</sup> " and "Pegasus Meteor Ora Ora <sup>3</sup>Drill"...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A unique kungfu skill from the Chinese movie "Dragon Tiger Gate.")</dfn>
    
    <br/>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(A technique derived from "Mount Lu Rising Dragon" from "Saint Seiya.")</dfn>
    
    <br/>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(A battle cry or taunt in Japanese.)</dfn>

    <p>The reason why Elder Poisonous Dragon had been sent was because they had accounted for the silver-haired young man at Great Death-Courting Senior's side in the villa. According to the intelligence provided by Mo Immortal Castle, that silver-haired young man also had a strong self-healing ability, so Elder Poisonous Dragon was the most suitable person to send.</p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon's Poisonous Dragon Drill series of boxing combos had the major damage effect which could perfectly prevent recovery!</p>

    <p>All the people in the Demon Hunters Association military tent were extremely confident in this regard.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was still Monday July 24th in the fourteenth week of the semester.</p>

    <p>When Elder Yin died, Xiao Yin and Thunder were meanwhile enjoying a breakfast of broccoli salad.</p>

    <p>Writing novels was a much more difficult path than Xiao Yin had imagined. Therefore, he didn't stop reading online novels even at breakfast. Chewing on broccoli, he read the book <em>Release That Wet Nurse </em>by Father Wang.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin had looked up a lot of writing guides on the Internet, and then realized that they were basically meaningless. The most important operation was still practice! There were no shortcuts to writing; it had always been that experience was the best teacher, and there were very few people who could be considered writing prodigies.</p>

    <p>It was just like prodigies in cultivation; in this world, how many people could there be who were as monstrous as Master?</p>

    <p>People should thus still have both real ability and learning. Relying on plagiarism definitely wouldn't work. For example, a live streamer called Dean appeared on some live streaming platform a while ago. He live streamed himself singing but had filched the raw voices from other videos<sup>4</sup>; even the songs he uploaded were a copy and paste from the uploads of other singers, yet he vehemently claimed they were his own... If you didn't want people to know what you did, don't do it. If you had nothing of substance, there was only so long that you could stick a green onion in your nose and pretend to be an elephant.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>4</sup>("Shadow Entertainment - Dean" was a live stream lip-sync singer who plagiarized other songs, including one written by Kuxuan, the author of this novel.)</dfn>

    <p>Who knew how this lonely Dean was doing now; Xiao Yin decided to do an online search after breakfast to see whether this live streamer had become defunct or not.</p>

    <p>As he ate breakfast, Xiao Yin also began to rethink his subject matter.</p>

    <p>While Xiao Yin thought that the opening chapter he had written yesterday had the flavor of a superior work, it somehow felt very predictable, so he simply deleted and abandoned it.</p>

    <p>As the saying went, you couldn't build the new without destroying the old.</p>

    <p>"What are you thinking about?" Lord Diulei was a little amused when he saw Xiao Yin thinking hard.</p>

    <p>"My previous subject matter won't do. I'm thinking of something new," Xiao Yin replied earnestly. "I say, how about I write a novel about a collar?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "???"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "For example, the protagonist has an ancestral collar with a chain attached to it. The collar duplicates the abilities of whoever pulls on this chain! Then, whoever wears the collar will get all the abilities stored in the collar. The collar can in turn be entrusted to someone else... This is the legendary All For One <sup>5</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>5</sup>(From the "My Hero Academia" series; in a universe where people are born with abilities or 'quirks,' the villain has an "All For One" quirk which allows him to steal people's quirks and make them his own.)</dfn>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "How's that? Say something, Thunder... I can change it again if it doesn't work! If you think a collar's not good, I can use a toilet seat instead!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "I've even got the name of the protagonist. It's called Silver Portion Out Long! 'Portion' from the word 'butt <sup>6</sup> .'"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>6</sup>('Gǔ' 股 "share" in 'Pìgu' 屁股 "butt" ..)</dfn>

    <p>Lord Diulei's lips twitched. "Silver... Silver Portion Out Long?"</p>

    <p>"Silver is my last name... so the name also has a very deep meaning! As for 'Portion Out Long,' the protagonist once sat on the toilet for a long time because of constipation and couldn't push it out. As a result, he accidentally squatted on the toilet for too long, making him the person who used the toilet the longest in the world! Since then, the protagonist Silver Portion Out Long accidentally gained the ability to replicate the abilities of people who happened to squat on the toilet at the same time!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>
