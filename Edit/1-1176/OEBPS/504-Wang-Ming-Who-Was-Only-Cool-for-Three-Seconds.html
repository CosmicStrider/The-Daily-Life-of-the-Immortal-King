  <h1>Chapter 504 Wang Ming Who Was Only Cool for Three Seconds </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ming wasn't the slightest bit surprised at this result. He indeed didn't have any talent for cultivation, but he didn't think he would lose when it came to anything digital like games.</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang's live stream room was already full to bursting!</p>

    <p>Because of Wang Ming's and Fang Xing's godly operations, the link to the live stream room had been shared like crazy. As a result, audience numbers in Daoist Guang's live stream room had very quickly broken the critical ten million mark and was surging ahead toward eleven million.</p>

    <p>In the study, Father Wang and Lie Mengmeng were gaping wide enough to put eggs in their mouths.</p>

    <p>Father Wang could already foresee that after Daoist Guang's match was over today, the video of Wang Ming and Fang Xing's battle would go viral thanks to the water friends.</p>

    <p>Secretly taking a deep breath, Father Wang forced himself to calm down and decided to send Wang Ming a voice message. "Little Ming, is this really alright..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang felt that Wang Ming might have gone a little too far this time - while Wang Ling had to hide his true strength, Wang Ming at the same time had to hide this true identity... In some sense, these two brothers were actually quite similar.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ming had used this character TTXS, it was very easy now to hunt people down on the Internet. If some meddlesome online friend really did expose Wang Ming's identity, it would be a huge problem!</p>

    <p>"Uncle, don't worry, it's alright."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming sent a blithe voice message.</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "Aren't you afraid you'll be hunted down on the Internet?"</p>

    <p>"Hunting me down? Uncle, you're really thinking too much!" Wang Ming laughed.</p>

    <p>Hunt him down? How could it be that easy!</p>

    <p>He had indeed been a little high-profile today after using the computer in the lab for a bit of fun to hack the game company's server twice as well as personally eliminate Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ming was confident that he hadn't left any holes behind.</p>

    <p>If the game company's technical team would never realize he had ever been inside at all, then the idea of those online users wanting to hunt him down was complete nonsense.</p>

    <p>It was Old Qi who had helped register a whole bunch of fake identities for him. When Wang Ming had delivered the talisman to Wang Ling back then, there had still been a misunderstanding with the police and he had been taken in. In the end, after investigating for a long time, the only information the police had on him was "Wang Xiaoer" this fake identity.</p>

    <p>"You should always hold back a little. Once today's video gets out, you'll definitely draw attention," said Father Wang.</p>

    <p>"It's fine, it's fine; I'll erase the video and ensure no one sees it! And don't worry about the game company coming after me to pay them back. Don't I still have Old Qi here? Worst comes to the worst, I'll just have him call the game company later and act cute with them!"</p>

    <p>"... <em>Cough </em>!" President Qi almost sprayed a mouthful of coffee on Wang Ming's screen when he heard this as he promptly choked!</p>

    <p>When all was said and done, he was also one of the Ten Founding Generals of Huaxiu nation!</p>

    <p>He was on par with Yi Jianchuan, Jiang Lei and Sun Dakang... How high was his status?</p>

    <p>Acting cute with others - what kind of operation was that?!</p>

    <p>"It's not very nice to always bother President Qi." Father Wang of course knew what kind of person this Old Qi whom Wang Ming referred to was - after all, Old Qi's top superior was Father Wang's fan, so it wasn't like Father Wang didn't know anything about this matter.</p>

    <p>"It's fine, uncle! I'm the Deepwater Wolf <sup>1</sup> and Old Qi is the Apostate Wolf <sup>2</sup> ! We've been like a granddad and grandson duo all these years, perfectly concealing my true identity!" Wang Ming laughed.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(From the Chinese boardgame "Werewolf," and refers to the werewolf who is good at hiding and surviving to the end.)</dfn>
    
    <br/>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(The werewolf who wins the trust of the villagers and the prophets, though in the game it's by selling out other werewolves ..)</dfn>

    <p>Father Wang: "..."</p>

    <p>President Qi: "..."</p>

    <p>Old Qi felt that he had spoilt Wang Ming a bit too much over the years. Although they had a superior and subordinate relationship, he had never assumed the manner of a superior to order Wang Ming to do anything.</p>

    <p>For one thing, Wang Ming was indeed efficient and very reliable.</p>

    <p>For another, he had come here when he had still been very young.</p>

    <p>Old Qi had discovered Wang Ming when the latter was four and had groomed him in secret for three years before bringing him back directly to the research institute.</p>

    <p>After all these years, Old Qi had already long regarded him as his own grandson.</p>

    <p>But Old Qi realized that in the last few years, it seemed that the number of times he had had to clean up Wang Ming's mess had increased, almost at a skyrocket rate.</p>

    <p>Seeing how absorbed Wang Ming and Father Wang were in their chat, President Qi looked at the time and couldn't help giving a reminder. "Little Ming, Zhai Yin will be back soon..."</p>

    <p>"It's fine! I'm quitting now, but I have time for one solo round!" Wang Ming waved his hand.</p>

    <p>"But..."</p>

    <p>"No buts! She's just a woman, us men need to be resolute and strong-willed!" Wang Ming replied without turning his head around.</p>

    <p>As soon as he said this, Wang Ming suddenly felt a slender hand press down on his shoulder with an extremely cold and gloomy air...</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "..."</p>

    <p>From the sensation on his shoulder... it definitely wasn't President Qi's hand!</p>

    <p>"Play, ing, games?"</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin's gaze was fixed on Wang Ming's back, her unreadable expression making Wang Ming tremble...</p>

    <p>Holding the coffee cup, Old Qi couldn't help sighing before he stood up and pat Wang Ming's shoulder as he bit back a smile. "Not only am I the Apostate Wolf, I'm also a prophet!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, the game was still ongoing.</p>

    <p>After Wang Ming had had his character TTXX dispose of Fang Xing, the water friends in the live stream room soon noticed that this anti-cheat little brother's character was starting to twitch abnormally.</p>

    <p>"Was he disconnected?" Daoist Guang was startled.</p>

    <p>Father Wang dropped his forehead in his hand. "No... he's being punished..."</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang: "..."</p>

    <p>Even though Wang Ling didn't know exactly what had happened to Wang Ming, he was certain that Zhai Yin was involved...</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang got back into the jeep and the water friends match resumed. It was already down to the last circle.</p>

    <p>Because Wang Ming had disconnected and Fang Xing had been killed, there were twenty-eight players left.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was still on the roof of that small building.</p>

    <p>The circle was very small now and Wang Ling predicted that a melee would undoubtedly happen next.</p>

    <p>But from beginning to end, Wang Ling had yet to see Er Ha and Wei Zhi.</p>

    <p>Given Er Ha's personality, he felt that this thing might be lying low somewhere.</p>

    <p>The circle on the map was already very small with the sound of gunshots mixed into the scene as the number of people continued to fall but at a very slow rate.</p>

    <p>In the final leg in the safe zone, a lot of people wouldn't act as recklessly as before and would start to become especially cautious.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling suddenly heard the subtle sound of a door opening!</p>

    <p>Someone had gone around to come in from behind!</p>

    <p>He instantly raised his guard.</p>

    <p>At the same time, still on the roof, he heard this team's conversation.</p>

    <p>"Brother Dog, it looks like this house has already been looted. There might be people inside!"</p>

    <p>"Mm, be careful." Er Ha nodded.</p>

    <p>"By the way, Brother Dog... how long are you going to play today before you go home?"</p>

    <p>"At most just one more round."</p>

    <p>"So soon?"</p>

    <p>In front of the screen, Er Ha shook out its green fur. "I don't know why, but as soon as I stepped into this house, I feel like my master's staring at me!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
