  <h1>Chapter 925 Never Too Old To Learn</h1>

  <div>

    <p>People never stopped learning.</p>

    <p>A famous writer once said: <em>Man is a thinking reed </em>.</p>

    <p>All living things under heaven and earth abided by the principles of natural selection and survival of the fittest, and so it was with life itself.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was only sixteen years old and had yet to mature in wisdom, which was also why he couldn't stop learning for a single moment.</p>

    <p>The reason why his mentality could mature at a healthy rate without him being led astray was all thanks to how Father Wang and Mother Wang had educated him since young. After all, this couple wrote literature, and had written about so many chuuni protagonists that they naturally knew how to bring up their own child to flourish on the whole in the aspects of moral character, intelligence, physical health, art and labor.</p>

    <p>Like right now, when it had taken Wang Ling dozens of seconds to finish analyzing and mastering Divine Dao.</p>

    <p>"Too slow." Wang Ling was a little disappointed.</p>

    <p>He learned everything very quickly; it only took him tenths of a second to grasp something. No matter how difficult an International Math Olympiad question was, once he mastered the method of solving it, he could basically solve every problem in microseconds.</p>

    <p>But this Divine Dao had actually taken him dozens of seconds...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought he had already learned plenty, but now he realized that he had to further temper his learning ability.</p>

    <p>Several dozen seconds were too slow!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had already made up his mind - once this incident was over, he would buy more copies of <em>Three Five </em>to do.</p>

    <p>It seemed that he was the one who hadn't practiced enough!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling wondered if it was because he wasn't writing enough. While he needed to master the knowledge fully before the two gremlins monster pen and goblin eraser could finish writing his homework for him, this in some sense also fostered "laziness."</p>

    <p>Things couldn't carry on like this.</p>

    <p>As an outstanding young man who upheld the core values of cultivation, Wang Ling felt that he should pursue progress.</p>

    <p>"You..."</p>

    <p>On the other side, Star Lord's gaze was fixed on Wang Ling from where he was sitting on his throne. If this Miss Bai Qiao hadn't said anything, he would never have expected this youngster to be the true person to beat!</p>

    <p>He should have sensed it earlier on; there had been so many magic halos on Bai Qiao, but that power didn't belong to her at all. So, who had helped add these magic halos to her?</p>

    <p>Star Lord finally realized where the problem lay.</p>

    <p>Each time he plundered a planet, he would first determine who the most powerful person on the planet was, and he wouldn't make a move until he had imprisoned the other party on Divine Dao Star.</p>

    <p>This time, his initial target had been Bai Qiao. As for Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>In Star Lord's eyes, this was someone who had simply been dragged into this matter.</p>

    <p>And this person really was only sixteen years old...</p>

    <p>Cultivators could use spells and pills to slow down the ageing process, but the "vitality" in their bodies would gradually fade as they got older.</p>

    <p>This was a major way of determining age among cultivators, and it was also something that couldn't be faked. An expert could see the vitality in an aura with one glance.</p>

    <p>Star Lord could sense that Wang Ling's body was brimming with vitality.</p>

    <p>This was the mark of the young.</p>

    <p>Star Lord's eyes flashed with visible killing intent. He stared at Wang Ling and his voice was bitingly cold. "One genius in this universe is enough; only this king is worthy of this high throne."</p>

    <p>Putting his hand on the throne, he injected godly power into the seven-colored gems embedded in it. Tremendous godly power instantly surged forth with an utterly dazzling golden light that blasted out in all directions.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stood where he was, as indomitable as rock. Bai Qiao hid behind his back and felt a sense of security.</p>

    <p>Such overwhelming godly pressure crashed down on them like raging waves, but Wang Ling's small frame was like an island in the vast ocean which had yet to sink.</p>

    <p>With a wave of his hand, Wang Ling casually let loose godly pressure of his own to cancel out the force, which stunned Bai Qiao behind him.</p>

    <p>The cry of a phoenix rang out.</p>

    <p>Several Three-Headed Phoenixes actually flew out of the seven-colored gems that had been injected with godly power.</p>

    <p>These were creatures that were already extinct. Like the prehistoric vicious kuns which Wang Zhen had been rearing previously, the phoenix was also a prehistoric species that was now extinct.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had only seen these creatures in <em>The Cultivation Encyclopedia </em>. Even the museum didn't have an intact version, and only had 3D models modeled on bone fragments.</p>

    <p>If the original bones were put on display, they would inevitably catch the eye of covetous wrongdoers.</p>

    <p>These vicious creatures could also be called divine beasts. Everything from head to toe was valuable, and they were worth far more than holy beasts!</p>

    <p>The holy beast clans had been eaten into extinction back then because of a rumor.</p>

    <p>Who knew what would happen if these "divine beasts" were to reappear in the world.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling could already picture how these guys would be turned into dishes on a menu.</p>

    <p>The seven Three-Headed Phoenixes spat out Rainbow Divine Flame as they charged at Wang Ling. Wang Ling's eyes were as unruffled as an old well as he gazed into the hall in front of him.</p>

    <p>The outstretched wings of these seven adult Three-Headed Phoenixes were tens of <em>zhang </em>in length and the birds carried astonishing godly power. It was clear that they had been reared by Star Lord from a very young age.</p>

    <p>They were of an exalted lineage, and were far more superior to the vicious kuns.</p>

    <p>Star Lord thought himself omnipotent; Wang Ling wasn't the least bit surprised that he would keep these battle pets.</p>

    <p>Hadn't Wang Zhen that guy also opened a fish farm to rear kuns...</p>

    <p>The Rainbow Divine Flame of an adult Three-Headed Phoenix was more powerful than anyone could imagine, but the flames didn't penetrate Wang Ling's barrier; now that he had comprehended Divine Dao, and coupled with the Three Thousand Great Dao of ten universes, he was powerful enough to withstand any damage.</p>

    <p>But these seven Three-Headed Phoenixes that had been reared by Star Lord since young firmly believed that Divine Dao Star's Star Lord was the most powerful being in the universe, so they thought nothing of Wang Ling at all.</p>

    <p>"To blaspheme against God, there is only death!" the lead Three-Headed Phoenix cried out. It opened its mouth full of fangs and flapped its slender wings. Several feathers flew out along with Rainbow Divine Flame to stab Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Stand down."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't even look as he waved his hand.</p>

    <p>The Rainbow Divine Flame which filled the sky was actually extinguished...</p>

    <p>Before the Three-Headed Phoenixes could react, the force from this backhand sent all seven of them spinning away.</p>

    <p>Before Star Lord could heal them in time, these seven Three-Headed Phoenixes which he had summoned had already turned into seven splotches of blood on the walls of the palace.</p>

    <p>Just like mosquitoes, these seven Three-Headed Phoenixes died at the first blow...</p>

    <p>Star Lord's face finally changed. He got up from his throne and glared at Wang Ling. "Well, well! You are the first to make this king stand..."</p>

    <p>Before he could say "up," however, a voice cut him off.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't open his mouth, but a terrifying and intimidating voice echoed in Star Lord's head. "Since you love to sit, then don't ever get up again..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling curled his lip and stomped his foot.</p>

    <p>Tremendous pressure fell on Star Lord's shoulders, forcing his ass to sit down once more...</p>
