  <h1>Chapter 904 The Scabbard's Might</h1>

  <div>

    <p>No one present had expected this 1v3 fight.</p>

    <p>Bad enough she had a poisonous tongue, but Bai Qiao was far more irascible than they had expected. That long ahoge lashed out like a divine whip, instantly cutting Boss Jin's shop into two. Wang Ling unhurriedly pushed Boss Jin's and his shop assistant Ling Huan's heads down and helped them dodge Bai Qiao's attack.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Wang Ling was rendered utterly speechless by this fightstyle which didn't even spare family.</p>

    <p>"My shop! My merchandise! My priceless exorcism magic artifacts!" Looking at the mess in front of him, Boss Jin clasped his face, instantly turning into that world-famous painting "The Scream."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing seized the opportunity to grab hold of Bai Qiao's ahoge. He could see that this was the key to fighting Bai Qiao. As long as he could keep the ahoge under control, there would be nothing Bai Qiao could do.</p>

    <p>"If you think you can control me, think again." Bai Qiao didn't think much of Fang Xing at all and snorted.</p>

    <p>The next moment, the ahoge on her head actually came off!</p>

    <p>At the same time, a brand new one grew back on the top of her head.</p>

    <p>And the broken hair that Fang Xing had grabbed vaporized, gradually turning into a ball of spirit energy that flowed away and vanished...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi rushed forward. He had equipment from Wang Ling all over him, and he looked stronger than he actually was. Pushing off on his feet, he approached Bai Qiao in a flash, and light exploded forth from his gloves to bombard Bai Qiao.</p>

    <p>But Bai Qiao didn't even lift her eyelids at such a violent attack.</p>

    <p>"Too slow." Bai Qiao flicked the ahoge whip at Zhuo Yi, whose suit was directly ripped to shreds. He wasn't injured, however, as golden light completely blocked the remaining power of Bai Qiao's ahoge.</p>

    <p>When the golden light dissipated, Bai Qiao saw Zhuo Yi in bright red long johns.</p>

    <p>While she was feeling surprised at the long johns's strong defense, Er Ha also lunged at her.</p>

    <p>"Basic Dog Skills! Ah, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit!!!!!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha held nothing back when it attacked. After a long period of cultivation, its "Basic Dog Skills" had already reached the highest level, and Er Ha could now throw a thousand punches a second!</p>

    <p>"Bone King!" The instant Er Ha used its Dog Skills, it also took out its life bonded magic artifact. Bone King transformed into a pair of spiky gloves white as jade, which Er Ha wore on its paws.</p>

    <p>For a moment, shadow punches exploded everywhere and shook the air.</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao was slightly surprised at the astonishing frequency of the punches. The dog's performance was much better than she had imagined. It was clearly a demon king, but it could actually merge with an ordinary akita's body to this extent.</p>

    <p>"Interesting." Bai Qiao smiled, and the ahoge on the top of her head suddenly split into countless strands of hair which swiftly stretched out to clash with the shadow punches all over the sky, her body radiating a frightening aura and spiritual pressure.</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao's expression was unperturbed and relaxed. She didn't hide her aggression at all, and didn't give Er Ha any leeway in their fight.</p>

    <p>The hair swung out like the three thousand strands of Buddha's hair, turning into countless afterimages that parried all the attacks and caused Er Ha to completely lose the will to fight.</p>

    <p>In the end, the hair started to whip around faster and faster, and Er Ha sensed that it couldn't hold her off much longer!</p>

    <p>Fang Xing frowned, his expression stern. "White Night Spell!"</p>

    <p>In almost a split second, Fang Xing completely transformed, and ten snake scales shot out to chop up all of Bai Qiao's hair.</p>

    <p>Boss Jin and Ling Huan now finally understood what Bai Qiao meant by "son and daughter"...</p>

    <p>It turned out that this Brother Fang Xing was a magical girl!!</p>

    <p>After her transformation, Fang Xing's aura and battle strength reached new heights, and Bai Qiao's expression finally changed.</p>

    <p>A punch!</p>

    <p>Fang Xing drew close so quickly that Bai Qiao was stupefied.</p>

    <p>When Bai Qiao was hit, the sound of godly iron being struck rang out.</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao was sent flying right out of the shop.</p>

    <p>Only then did her expression finally turn serious.</p>

    <p>The strongest person...</p>

    <p>Sure enough, was that teenager inside.</p>

    <p>It was only after she was blown out of the shop that Bai Qiao realized that she had been dragged into a layered space at some point, which was similar to an "otherworld." Any fighting that happened in this space layer wouldn't affect reality.</p>

    <p>None of the three people she was currently fighting was capable of this technique.</p>

    <p>The only person who was perhaps capable of this remarkable ability was that average-looking teenager in the shop.</p>

    <p>When she had been roasting him before, Bai Qiao had had a rough idea of Wang Ling's identity, and knew that they were connected in countless ways.</p>

    <p>But Bai Qiao realized that she had still underestimated Wang Ling's strength.</p>

    <p>The moment the fight began, he had pulled everyone in the shop into a space layer. Furthermore, he had done it so discreetly that even she hadn't noticed.</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao couldn't help paying attention to this godly ability</p>

    <p>" <em>Chi </em>!"</p>

    <p>At that moment, Fang Xing, who had used the White Night Spell to turn into a warrior goddess, pulled out that forty-meter broadsword in the air.</p>

    <p>When it was drawn out, the blade slashed down with an astonishing sword light and tremendous spiritual pressure.</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao took a deep breath, and the ahoge on the top of her head split into two, turning into a pair of huge hands that caught that forty-meter broadsword firmly in mid-air.</p>

    <p>However, she was unable to hold steady in the air under that tremendous spiritual pressure, and she dropped slightly.</p>

    <p>But she hadn't fallen into dire straits.</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao moved the forty-meter broadsword aside with all her strength. Fang Xing was stunned when she realized that her blade was actually cracking from the strength of the ahoge.</p>

    <p>"It's over." Bai Qiao smiled calmly at Fang Xing and took something out of her pocket.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing thought it was going to be some magic artifact, but then saw this Miss Bai Qiao actually take out from her pocket a bottle of hair conditioner, which she had prepared beforehand, and pour the entire thing over her head.</p>

    <p>The ahoge instantly absorbed the nutrients in the hair conditioner.</p>

    <p>In a split second, everyone saw the ahoge on Bai Qiao's head grow like a godly tree at a visible and rapid rate until in the end, it actually turned into a golden ancient sword that glowed with a magical light!</p>

    <p>"Not good!"</p>

    <p>Fang Xing instinctively sensed the danger.</p>

    <p>This spiritual pressure was overwhelmingly intimidating and was already no longer the oppression of a True Immortal.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing was well aware that she might not be able to parry this sword strike.</p>

    <p>Even if she didn't die, she would be laid up at home for half a month.</p>

    <p>"Afraid? But it's too late." This Miss Bai Qiao had no intention of drawing back.</p>

    <p>" <em>Hu! </em>"</p>

    <p>She swung her ahoge, and like a god parting the sea, she chopped down at Fang Xing's head as the surrounding space crumbled inch by inch.</p>

    <p>But the next moment, Bai Qiao's ahoge divine sword was actually blocked by a force and couldn't press forward anymore.</p>

    <p>A figure had suddenly appeared under her sword.</p>

    <p>It was a boy who didn't look more than ten years old, dressed in a brown tunic and white robe.</p>

    <p>With just one small arm, he held off her attack...</p>
