  <h1>Chapter 867 The Cosmic God Tree At The Center Of The Universe</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling was well aware that if the spirit armor couldn't be canceled, the battle wouldn't be able to continue... Gu Shunzhi was very strong, but there was no way for him to break through the absolute defense of the King's Eye.</p>

    <p>However, Gu Shunzhi's strength certainly couldn't be underestimated since he could force the King's Eye to launch its absolute defense, and no one had ever been able to do that before... Even Wang Ling himself didn't know that the King's Eye would automatically activate the spirit armor when it felt that the clone was under threat.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's problem now was how to cancel it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling researched it for dozens of seconds before he gave up - he decided to use a quicker and more convenient way to cancel it.</p>

    <p>So, he opened the "task manager" in his mind, selected "King's Eye" and "all expansion options under King's Eye," and then clicked "end program"!</p>

    <p>Almost instantly, the spirit armor was shut down.</p>

    <p>This was a very efficient method which Wang Ling often used to cancel some active spells. Of course, some spells had an enforced time limit, like the Great Fortune Spell. They couldn't be shut down once they were activated, and one could only wait until the duration was completely over.</p>

    <p>But...</p>

    <p>It was finally canceled.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling breathed a long sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>When all was said and done, the other party was a respected keeper of order. If he made Gu Shunzhi cast spells one after another and none of them could even pierce the spirit armor, how despairing would he feel as a keeper of order?</p>

    <p>As a kind-hearted person, Wang Ling felt that he should be more considerate of others.</p>

    <p>"Canceled the spirit armor?"</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi saw the armor wrapped around the boy disappear, and couldn't help looking displeased.</p>

    <p>Was this a provocation? Was the boy looking down on him?</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi was a little angry in his heart. He had fought so many experts in the universe, but no one had ever given him this sort of attitude before.</p>

    <p>He had once defeated a giant fatty with thick, massive arms and a creased chin like a tray of steamed buns who had liked to wear gloves embedded with extremely unusual gems.</p>

    <p>He had once defeated a purple man with pointy ears who looked like an alien kangaroo. The man even had an attendant, and Gu Shunzhi had fought them both on his own at the time.</p>

    <p>He had also once defeated a brawny guy who liked to wield an electric hammer. This man had a younger brother with the name Rakan whom he doted on even though they weren't biologically related. The electric hammer the man carried back then was called Wang Dachui <sup>1</sup> , which had been very troublesome to deal with, but Gu Shunzhi had still won in the end. When the man shook hands with Gu Shunzhi, he finally told him his name, which was "Xayah" <sup>2</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The protagonist of the
Chinese film "Fantasy." "Chui" é”¤
means "hammer.")</dfn>
    
    <br/>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Xayah and Rakan are a
character duo in LoL ..)</dfn>

    <p>He had traveled all through the cosmos, maintaining order and defeating countless experts...</p>

    <p>But this battle against Wang Ling gave him a completely different feeling.</p>

    <p>"I'm going to get serious." His eyes were fixed on Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The next moment, spiritual pressure came pouring down which shook the entire Heavenly Dao space. As the space rippled, endless cracks spread out like a spiderweb.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling narrowed his eyes, but was unperturbed as usual.</p>

    <p>A few golden leaves flew out of the cracks in the Heavenly Dao space and spun swiftly, turning into sharp discs which swept forward from all directions.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling waved his hand in a circle in the air to create a barrier, but these countless golden leaves actually pierced straight through it!</p>

    <p>The barrier was constructed with Heavenly Dao, and Wang Ling was a little surprised that the golden leaves could cut through Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>He had to dodge them bodily.</p>

    <p>After all, if these leaves cut his face, he didn't know whether he would bleed, but he would definitely lose some skin...</p>

    <p>The six Great Heavenly Dao also turned pale at this scene and were amazed by the origin of these golden leaves.</p>

    <p>"The golden leaves of the Cosmic God Tree..." Strength Heavenly Dao was dazed. "Gu Shunzhi even has such a wondrous item?"</p>

    <p>Cosmic God Tree...</p>

    <p>This was a tree rumored to be at the very center of the universe... Each of its leaves contained the truth of Heavenly Dao!</p>

    <p>Strength Heavenly Dao never expected Gu Shunzhi to have the leaves of this tree, let alone refine them into a magic treasure!</p>

    <p>"To run into the Cosmic God Tree is truly astonishing fortune. The tree is at the center of the universe, which not many people can find..." A picture scroll of a supremely beautiful planet in the cosmos seemed to unfold in Time Heavenly Dao's eyes, as if he was seeing the flow of time for the Cosmic God Tree.</p>

    <p>Time Heavenly Dao spread his palm open, and a majestic and gigantic god tree with golden leaves emerged, like a phoenix rising.</p>

    <p>This was a miniature image of the Cosmic God Tree.</p>

    <p>It was exactly what the Cosmic God Tree looked like now, and the six Great Heavenly Dao were hit with the rich fragrance of the truth of Great Dao.</p>

    <p>They were deeply shaken. It had already been a very long time since they'd observed the Cosmic God Tree's growth, and they wouldn't have known if it hadn't been for Gu Shunzhi - they were astonished because the Cosmic God Tree was almost fully mature.</p>

    <p>Strength Heavenly Dao sighed. "I remember the Cosmic God Tree was nothing more than a small sapling back then... who would have thought that in the blink of an eye, it's already become so magnificent."</p>

    <p>"I'm a little curious to know how it grew..."</p>

    <p>Time Heavenly Dao kept a record of the universe's history, and naturally knew the Cosmic God Tree's background.</p>

    <p>The tableau skipped rapidly, and the majestic tree in Time Heavenly Dao's palm also returned to when it had been a sapling.</p>

    <p>"1280 times!" Time Heavenly Dao turned the wheel of time.</p>

    <p>The Cosmic God Tree in the tableau began to grow rapidly.</p>

    <p>Roughly eight thousand years ago, when the Cosmic God Tree was a sapling, the first person to pass by...</p>

    <p>"This man is..." Spirit Heavenly Dao asked.</p>

    <p>"Star Monarch Gu Yuan. He is Gu Cheng's father and Gu Shunzhi's grandfather," Time Heavenly Dao explained.</p>

    <p>"I never thought that the first person would also be connected to the Gu family..." said Strength Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>Everyone watched as Star Monarch Gu Yuan arrived at the Cosmic God Tree sapling with an overjoyed expression on his face.</p>

    <p>The six Great Heavenly Dao thought that Star Monarch Gu Yuan was going to prostrate himself before the tree, when they saw this man forcefully undo this belt. "Fuck! I've been holding it in for so long!"</p>

    <p>After several seconds...</p>

    <p>The sapling was watered with a stream of gold-colored liquid.</p>

    <p>The six Great Heavenly Dao: "..."</p>

    <p>After that, the Cosmic God Tree grew from a sapling into a small tree...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Then, about six thousand years ago, another wretch... oh, no, another formidable Dao Master passed through by chance...</p>

    <p>He also left his long-accumulated stockpile of manure on the Cosmic God Tree...</p>

    <p>The Cosmic God Tree grew again...</p>
