  <h1>Chapter 869 Lord Ma's Great Battle Against the Cosmic God Tree</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Was this a toilet... or was he under an illusion spell...</p>

    <p>This was the question that popped into Gu Shunzhi's head the instant he saw the toilet. He even cast several spells on himself in a row, like the "Lucidity Spell,""Purification Spell,""Haiwa Died, Mental Disco Dancing Spell <sup>1</sup> ," and "Mother Has Been Gone for Ten Years, Wake Up Spell <sup>2</sup> ," to confirm that he wasn't seeing wrong because of an illusion spell.</p>

    <p>That, was indeed a white, spotless modern toilet — worst of all, it was emitting a terrifying aura which was no less inferior to the Cosmic God Tree's...</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling had already enlightened Lord Ma a second time before summoning it here.</p>

    <p>The summoned Lord Ma was now the most powerful fighter of all the enchanted gremlins in the Wang family's small villa, while in second place was Book of Sage Immortal iPoid.</p>

    <p>But Book of Sage Immortal wasn't a gremlin that had been enchanted a second time. It had been enlightened later, and had a technological advantage.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's enchantment ability was growing every day.</p>

    <p>The later the gremlins were enlightened, the more powerful they were.</p>

    <p>In fact, the enchantments could be overlaid on each other.</p>

    <p>For example, being enlightened a second time.</p>

    <p>Gremlins that were enlightened a second time were those that had Wang Ling's full trust.</p>

    <p>In the Wang family's small villa, it could be said that Lord Ma labored hard and made great contributions... Not only did he frequently serve as a messenger, but to establish good communication between the human world and the demon world, Lord Ma had now become an envoy who communicated with the demon world.</p>

    <p>When emissaries from the demon world wanted to come to the human world, they needed to report to Lord Ma, and after producing a letter of consent from Demon Saint, Lord Ma would then specially construct a transmission portal.</p>

    <p>Apart from that, in daily life...</p>

    <p>Lord Ma also suffered a lot.</p>

    <p>In order to deal with Father Wang's bad habit of sitting on the toilet for a long time, Mother Wang had Wang Ming invent a thermal toilet. Thus, Father Wang would sometimes sneak into Wang Ling's room to use the toilet.</p>

    <p>Currently, Lord Ma was the only big shot to have seen the buttocks of all the men in the Wang family, which was a rousing fact!</p>

    <p>Thus, Lord Ma had a very high position in Wang Ling's heart.</p>

    <p>Before having Lord Ma come out this time, Wang Ling had pondered for a very long time.</p>

    <p>Of all the battle forces he could summon, Wang Ling felt that Lord Ma was by and large the only one who could match the Cosmic God Tree.</p>

    <p>Indeed, he could have summoned Xiao Yin and Er Ha, but they clearly weren't as strong as the Cosmic God Tree.</p>

    <p>Now, after being enlightened for the second time, Lord Ma's strength just so happened to reach a particular standard, which was no small thing.</p>

    <p>So, pondering this, Lord Ma transformed into a human.</p>

    <p>In his human form, Lord Ma was an old man dressed in white with an old-world charm. He resembled a man of letters and had a scholarly air about him which was completely detached from everyone's impression of shit, piss or farts. But Lord Ma's image was in fact also related to everyone's expectations of the toilet — if your family's toilet could take on a human form, what did you think it would look like?</p>

    <p>Since the development of the toilet, how many scholars were suddenly hit by inspiration while sitting on it, going on to complete their research and make further leaps in human culture and scientific research?</p>

    <p>This was the ladder mankind climbed toward progress.</p>

    <p>And how many pure young men, in the depths of the night, threw their descendants wrapped in tissue into the toilet?</p>

    <p>This was a reflection on human reproduction.</p>

    <p>As the "ladder" for the progress of mankind and a reflection on "reproduction," it could be said that Lord Ma's emergence played a decisive role.</p>

    <p>Whenever he thought of this, even Wang Ling himself was deeply moved.</p>

    <p>But it was clear that Gu Shunzhi didn't understand this.</p>

    <p>"You'll pay for looking down on me."</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi took a deep breath. His eyes darkened, and swiftly controlling the Cosmic God Tree, he made a flower-like hand seal and only said three words, "Tree World Falling <sup>3</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(The Jukai Kotan jutsu from "Naruto.")</dfn>

    <p>In an instant, the branches which densely covered the Heavenly Dao space suddenly moved in unison!</p>

    <p>They started to stretch out in Wang Ling and Lord Ma's direction, like earth dragons rising from the ground.</p>

    <p>"Watch out, my lord!"</p>

    <p>Bent on protecting his master, Lord Ma quickly made a hand seal and tossed a cube at Wang Ling. "Primitive World: Detachment of Water Tank Technique <sup>4</sup>!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>4</sup>(Adapted from Detachment of
the Primitive World
Technique in Naruto ..)</dfn>

    <p>This was a spell for transforming a toilet water tank, and at that moment, it instantly turned into a silvery-white cube which safely encased Wang Ling safely.</p>

    <p>The golden branches were reached out were all firmly held off and couldn't go any further.</p>

    <p>It was just a brief exchange, but the six Great Heavenly Dao felt like they had been stabbed deeply...</p>

    <p>Because they now finally sensed a problem.</p>

    <p>It seemed...</p>

    <p>That even a toilet was stronger than they were!</p>

    <p>Monster!</p>

    <p>Lord Ma didn't have any flashy moves. He fought solely with the strength he had obtained after being enlightened; if the Cosmic God Tree's golden branches wanted to catch him, it wouldn't be that easy.</p>

    <p>Only then did Gu Shunzhi take note of how strong Lord Ma was.</p>

    <p>The Cosmic God Tree's golden branches were on the verge of catching Lord Ma, but he didn't move even an inch. His body actually turned transparent in front of everyone and the golden branches couldn't grab hold of him at all.</p>

    <p>"The power of space..."</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi understood.</p>

    <p>This Lord Ma was adept at spatial skills and had mastered a spatial layer ability which allowed part or all of his body to escape into another layer of space when he was under threat, only releasing his real body when the threat was gone.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi smiled.</p>

    <p>This was indeed a very powerful ability.</p>

    <p>But in Gu Shunzhi's eyes, this spatial layer technique wasn't anything special.</p>

    <p>His Chains of Order could even pass through three universes — a mere spatial layer spell was nothing to them!</p>

    <p>Thus, Gu Shunzhi quickly thought of a countermeasure.</p>

    <p>He summoned the Chains of Order once again and penetrated Lord Ma's spatial layers, using the Chains of Order as a bridge to connect the two spaces together.</p>

    <p>Once the spaces were linked, they merged completely inside out.</p>

    <p>Just like that, Lord Ma's spatial layer spell was broken.</p>

    <p>And in the next moment, the golden branches grabbed firm hold of Lord Ma's shoulders.</p>

    <p>"Not good!" Lord Ma knew things were bad.</p>

    <p>Was he going to lose?</p>

    <p>No...</p>

    <p>He could still put up a fight.</p>

    <p>In fact, he still had one last trump card when facing the Cosmic God Tree, which he hadn't used yet.</p>

    <p>Even if he lost!</p>

    <p>He would do it standing up!</p>

    <p>If he lost without going all out, that would be too aggravating!</p>

    <p>So Lord Ma took a deep breath and opened his mouth wide. The next moment, an endless gravitational pull was generated, which actually created a storm in space, and the sound of a flushing toilet rang out! Gu Shunzhi finally understood that this Lord Ma's ultimate killing move was actually swallowing space!</p>

    <p>Originally, Lord Ma didn't want to use this move.</p>

    <p>Because it was a smelly one...</p>

    <p>When the space-swallowing spell was cast, Lord Ma was reconnected to the space passage, and the smell of the filthy things he had swallowed in the past would be transmitted from the space on the other side directly through his mouth...</p>

    <p>"Naive..." Gu Shunzhi laughed again. "Want to go up against the Cosmic God Tree with just this level of suction? The Cosmic God Tree has stood in the center of the universe for thousands of years without falling, and is long used to any sort of space fluctuations."</p>

    <p>In the end, as soon as Gu Shunzhi finished speaking —</p>

    <p>The Cosmic God Tree smelled a scent it knew well in that moment, and stopped restraining Lord Ma's movements.</p>

    <p>The Cosmic God Tree indeed wasn't swallowed by the vortex created by the space-swallowing spell.</p>

    <p>But... the moment Lord Ma opened his mouth and the tree smelled that familiar scent, it was suddenly hungry...</p>

    <p>So the next second...</p>

    <p>The Cosmic God Tree's branches moved forward to squeeze into Lord Ma's mouth...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Winner: Wang Ling.</p>
