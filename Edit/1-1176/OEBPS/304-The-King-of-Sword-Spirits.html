  <h1>Chapter 304 The King of Sword Spirits </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It could be said that Jingke's appearance was completely unexpected for both Master of Immortal Mansion Cheng Yu as well as Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>Based on common sense, it was utterly impossible to open up another space inside an intrinsic spirit field!</p>

    <p>It was just a sword spirit!</p>

    <p>Cheng Yu's eyes were wide and there was a disbelieving expression on his face. He had clearly already sealed this sword spirit so many times over that not even ghosts or gods could have escaped the thick seal layers!</p>

    <p>Under their stunned gazes, Jingke walked out of the brown light, still in that same white robe and brown tunic, still with that short white hair.</p>

    <p>He hadn't done anything except give one meaningful glance.</p>

    <p>That Heavenly Materials sword which had been lunging forward actually turned around in the air straightaway.</p>

    <p>And then, without warning, it rushed at the Master of Immortal Mansion, Cheng Yu...</p>

    <p>Cheng Yu turned pale; with just one look, this sword spirit had actually overturned his command!</p>

    <p>This was a magic treasure that he had formed a contract with!</p>

    <p>Cheng Yu's expression finally changed. Looking at the Heavenly Materials sword as it came straight for him, he even gave it several more commands, but it was utterly useless.</p>

    <p>In a moment of desperation, he bit the tip of his tongue and used the blood that welled up to make a hand seal to force the contract to contain the spirit sword!</p>

    <p>Finally, the Heavenly Materials sword halted in front of him, and he coughed up a mouthful of blood. Using the power of fresh blood to forcefully control the contract was a harmful method. In a regular contract with a magic treasure, this type of forceful command could only be used three times. Furthermore, it would be accompanied by a violent backlash.</p>

    <p>Once these three opportunities were used up, the contract with the magic treasure would be broken off, and a new one would have to be formed.</p>

    <p>It could be said that this was the drawback of the Heavenly Materials sword lacking a sword spirit. That was why the contract had been easily disrupted. Cheng Yu had in fact already anticipated this possibility while the sword had been forged back then. Sure enough, the sword wouldn't listen to all his commands in its unstable state.</p>

    <p>Cheng Yu had hence always maintained a high level of focus whenever he used the Heavenly Materials sword, in order to ensure that his commands were precise. It had never, ever occurred to him that his command could actually be countermanded halfway!</p>

    <p>"How did you escape the seals?" Hovering in the air, Cheng Yu stared at the shota in a brown tunic and white robe; his legs felt like jelly, as if he was going to fall over at any time.</p>

    <p>In the face of this absolute strength, he felt a trace of terror.</p>

    <p>On the ground, Jingke just tilted his head to look at Cheng Yu, completely unruffled. "Was it, supposed, to be, difficult?"</p>

    <p>He spoke very slowly, almost a word at a time.</p>

    <p>From the apathetic, slightly haughty tone, this sword spirit completely thought nothing of him.</p>

    <p>"Impudent!"</p>

    <p>Cheng Yu howled with fury, and the sound shook the sky. The icebergs in the intrinsic spirit field shuddered, and the wind was as sharp as knives as it stirred up the ice all over the spirit field.</p>

    <p>However, these were all just side effects; the real energy was all directed at Jingke.</p>

    <p>Jingke's face was as calm as an ancient well. Without even blinking as he sheltered Fang Xing behind him, the ice all cracked and broke off to float ten feet beyond his sword qi.</p>

    <p>Nothing would be able to get within ten feet of them.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing lay on his side on the ground as he gripped his right shoulder and gasped harshly. The sword had come close to piercing his heart.</p>

    <p>If Jingke hadn't shown up and parried Cheng Yu's final attack in time, Fang Xing would already be dead.</p>

    <p>The storm raged for a very long time, causing Jingke's white robe to flutter madly.</p>

    <p>It finally subsided a full two minutes later.</p>

    <p>Jingke straightened his clothes and sighed deeply in his heart: Young people were truly becoming harder to deal with...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was an ongoing confrontation; Cheng Yu landed on the ground and called back his invisible spirit sword. Given Jingke's appearance, he didn't even dare fly anymore.</p>

    <p>He was well aware that now wasn't the time to be putting on a show; he had to concentrate and at all costs prevent his command from being directly disrupted again halfway.</p>

    <p>But given the current situation, he didn't dare continue using the Heavenly Materials sword.</p>

    <p>It was too risky to use it when it didn't have a sword spirit. Hence, he sheathed it after landing on the ground, and returned his focus to manipulating the power of the intrinsic spirit field again.</p>

    <p>All the spirit swords frozen inside the glaciers had sword spirits, and he had formed contracts with all of them, so it was safer to use them.</p>

    <p>This time, he had to cut down the other party in one strike without giving him an opportunity to fight back!</p>

    <p>"Hundred Swords Demonstration!" Cheng Yu gritted his teeth as he directly called forth a hundred swords. Numerous spirit swords broke free of the glaciers like butterflies emerging from cocoons. He didn't summon them to his side â€” as soon as they broke through the ice, they lunged at Jingke like meteors.</p>

    <p>From what Fang Xing could see, the offensive this time was truly stunning; it could be said that Cheng Yu was going all out.</p>

    <p>He was staking everything on these spirit swords as they hurtled forward like meteors.</p>

    <p>This time, none of these one hundred swords turned back halfway, and every single one hit the bullseye!</p>

    <p>"Open fire!"</p>

    <p>Seeing this result, Cheng Yu was wild with joy as he instantly continued the attack.</p>

    <p>He waved his hand, and even more frozen spirit swords broke through the ice and attacked Jingke.</p>

    <p>This crazy bombardment of a thousand spirit swords went on for three minutes before it subsided.</p>

    <p>Standing at a distance, Master of Immortal Castle Cheng Yu was breathing hard while he waited for the ice mist to disperse after the bombardment.</p>

    <p>But contrary to his expectations, there were still two shadows in the ice mist.</p>

    <p>Cheng Yu's heart trembled with fear, and he instantly made a hand seal in order to call back the one thousand spirit swords.</p>

    <p>However, none of them responded!</p>

    <p>What was going on? Why couldn't he feel the contract link with these spirit swords?</p>

    <p>Cheng Li stared in front of him, aghast. After the ice mist eventually thinned out, he saw those one thousand spirit swords which had been sent out earlier all lying haphazardly on the ground...</p>

    <p>Jingke was still standing in the same position, and hadn't budged an inch.</p>

    <p>He faced the front and drew in a deep breath before he gave his first command to these one thousand spirit swords lying on the ground. "You should, know, what to do?"</p>

    <p>In almost an instant, these one thousand spirit swords rose up in order, and their sword tips were all pointed in Cheng Yu's direction...</p>
