  <h1>Chapter 312 A New Backer </h1>

  <div>

    <p>The Lady stared blankly at the fatty in the photo. "Does the Lord think that there's something strange about this person?"</p>

    <p>"This person is a history teacher at Number 60 High School. His name is Wang Zukang, nicknamed Lao Gudong. He taught Zhuo Yi before. My venerable self speculates that this person may be Zhuo Yi's largest backer and the game-changer. But based on my venerable self's investigation, he probably started using this name only after he retired from the cultivation world hundreds of years ago." The man smiled. "Look carefully at his face; does he seem a little familiar?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>The Lady stared at the photo for a long time, then blankly shook her head. "Forgive this subordinate's stupidity, my Lord, please tell me..."</p>

    <p>The middle-aged man sighed and stroked his beard. "Have you heard of... Gorgeous Itinerant?"</p>

    <p>Gorgeous Itinerant?</p>

    <p>The Lady was suddenly enlightened. Of course she had heard of him! This was the man who had personally created the international ranking list of killers a thousand years ago! And he was the sole guardian envoy of the list! This was a genuine top expert who had left behind many prominent legends in the cultivation world.</p>

    <p>She clearly remembered how, when he had been renowned back then, he had once stabbed and killed a Soul Formation cultivator in mid-air with a one-finger qigong... But it was said that he had already retired a very long time ago due to a mistake he had made.</p>

    <p>She stared at the photo with a petrified expression on her face. "My Lord, do you mean to say that this high school teacher is Gorgeous Itinerant?"</p>

    <p>The middle-aged man nodded solemnly. "Yes."</p>

    <p>The Lady was instantly flustered. "But... Gorgeous Itinerant is said to be one of the most beautiful men in the world!"</p>

    <p>Because she had once been interested in Gorgeous Itinerant for a while, the Lady had looked up a lot of information on him before. Although she hadn't been able to find any specific photos of him, according to those who had seen his real face, it could be summed up in short as exceedingly and incomparably beautiful.</p>

    <p>So, how could the real Gorgeous Itinerant... be a fatty who loved <em>latiao </em>?!</p>

    <p>The Lady stared at the photo and took a deep breath. "My Lord... this subordinate wonders if this might be a mistake?"</p>

    <p>"You don't think he can eat until he got fat?"</p>

    <p>The middle-aged man laughed. "Haven't you heard of a different kind of prettyman <sup>1</sup> ?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is the title of a Chinese drama in which a group of pretty boys gain super powers.)</dfn>

    <p>The Lady: "..."</p>

    <p>After a pause, he stood up and looked gently at her. "You can rest assured, there's definitely no mistake. Furthermore, did you know that back then, it was in fact two guardian envoys who created the international ranking list of killers?"</p>

    <p>The Lady: "Two?"</p>

    <p>The Lord: "Gorgeous Itinerant was only one of them. There was actually a senior who stood shoulder to shoulder with him in strength. He was given the nickname Taoist Taotie. This was because he was exceedingly ugly, like Taotie<sup>2</sup> . A lot of people who saw his real face were scared to death..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(The taotie(饕餮)is one of the "four evil creatures of the world," or four fiends, in ancient Chinese mythology, and is said to be very unsightly.)</dfn>

    <p>The Lady: "..."</p>

    <p>The Lord: "They were as close as brothers to begin with. However, it seemed that Gorgeous Itinerant was too beautiful, and all the rumors in the outside world were about him... it only took lighting a small fuse after that for Taoist Taotie to break off relations with Gorgeous Itinerant. And it seems that the mistake which caused Gorgeous Itinerant to withdraw from the cultivation world is also linked to this falling-out."</p>

    <p>The Lady was stunned by this story. Her brain felt like it couldn't handle it because she had never heard of that Taoist Taotie who stood on par with Gorgeous Itinerant.</p>

    <p>Staring at the middle-aged man in front of her, she summoned up the courage to ask, "This subordinate is stupid. With all due respect, I would like to ask the Lord... why are you so familiar with this matter?"</p>

    <p>The middle-aged man laughed. "Because Taoist Taotie told me himself. Though Gorgeous Itinerant has gained weight, Taoist Taotie is sure that it's him — even if the man turns to ash, he would recognize him!"</p>

    <p>The Lady: "...Has the Lord drawn Senior Taoist Taotie in to work for you?"</p>

    <p>"I wouldn't put it that way; at best we're associates, and we're just taking what we each want." The middle-aged man waved his hand and then looked at the Lady. "This is what I came here today to tell you."</p>

    <p>The Lady: "Then what about our plans after that?"</p>

    <p>"From now on, our focus is Gorgeous Itinerant at Number 60 High School. According to legend, Gorgeous Itinerant possesses an invincible weapon which intimidated even True Immortals. We can now only rely on this thing for my Mo Immortal Castle to rise in the future..."</p>

    <p>The Lady nodded solemnly. "The Lord is wise! I will definitely do my best!"</p>

    <p>"Very good." The middle-aged man nodded. "You can send some people to infiltrate this school first as scouts for Senior Taoist Taotie."</p>

    <p>The Lady replied, "Yes!"</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, there was suddenly a look of nostalgia in the middle-aged man's eyes. "Mm... by the way, it seems that one of the classes Gorgeous Itinerant is teaching now is Grade One, Class Three?"</p>

    <p>The Lady: "Is there something strange about this Grade One, Class Three?"</p>

    <p>"It's nothing, I just suddenly remembered when I was in high school, I also happened to be in Class Three."</p>

    <p>The middle-aged man abruptly stared at the cup of milk on the table, and there were tears in his eyes. "My mother gave me two cans of Wang Zai milk..."</p>

    <p>The Lady: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ming's exclusive driver parked the Aoguanhai combat vehicle some distance away on the other side of the road opposite the Wang family's small villa. Since Wang Ming's abduction in Number 59 High School by Jiang Liuying, the younger sister of the Master of Shadow Stream, the driver had never left Wang Ming's side whenever he went out, for fear of anything unexpected happening.</p>

    <p>It was President Qi who had personally found Wang Ming this driver. His last name was Zhai and his given name was Yin. He was said to be very strong, but Wang Ming couldn't see it. He simply felt that the man was a little scary and that he had a perpetually cold aura... Wang Ming thought this guy shouldn't be called Zhai Yin, but "Grave <sup>3</sup> " instead.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(Grave in pinyin is 'yin zhai..')</dfn>

    <p>Zhai Yin was about to remove the car key when Wang Ming immediately stopped him and said, "That, you can go back... you can take a break."</p>

    <p>Instead of turning around, Zhai Yin raised his head, and that pair of cold eyes gazed at Wang Ming in the car's rearview mirror, causing the latter to shudder. The man's tone was also chilly. "President Qi said that your safety is my responsibility."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was a little speechless.</p>

    <p>Because when it came to safety... with Wang Ling around, there was no need to worry at all!</p>

    <p>And the most important thing was... he had come here today wearing the long johns!</p>

    <p>Wang Ming pursed his lips and looked at Zhai Yin. "But it's my family in this small villa. It wouldn't be appropriate for you to come in, right?"</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin: "President Qi said that your safety is my responsibility."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "Then can you stay in the car?"</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin: "President Qi said that your safety is my responsibility."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Helpless, Wang Ming in the end could only get out of the car with this old driver... Zhai Yin's face was utterly expressionless as he followed closely behind Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ming measured the distance between them with his eyes, he noticed that they were never more than one and a half meters apart, and he instantly felt deep despair.</p>

    <p>When the doorbell rang, Wang Ling personally went to open the door since Mother Wang and the old man were busy in the kitchen and hadn't heard it. As soon as he opened it, he felt the blast of a chilly aura coming from the man behind Wang Ming... he felt his face become a little colder.</p>

    <p>Without saying anything, he stretched out one hand to pull Wang Ming into the house before slamming the door shut.</p>

    <p>This hand speed was so fast that Zhai Yin wasn't able to react at all...</p>
