  <h1>Chapter 1062 Wang Ling's Work Day</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In short, the problem was what sort of part-time job Wang Ling could get.</p>

    <p>To not be able to use Heavenly Dao... It was going to be a bit difficult to earn this money. Otherwise, he could use his Heavenly Hearing to connect to other parallel dimensions and earn tens of thousands of yuan in minutes simply by selling some music rip-offs. But copying music actually wasn't a great plan, since the readers would suspect the author of padding the chapter.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling couldn't use Heavenly Dao, he could still rely on his physique, and had thought about hawking himself out as someone else's punching bag; after all, no matter how he was beaten up, he couldn't get hurt. The problem, however, was that if the backlash killed the other person, then it would be for nothing! He still vividly remembered when the Shadow Stream assassins had attacked Number 60 High, and how the assassin captain was killed by a backlash.</p>

    <p>The grass on the man's grave was probably dozens of meters high already...</p>

    <p>After some serious thinking, Wang Ling started to seek out the opinions of Chen Chao and the others in their private group chat.</p>

    <p>"A part-time job?" Chen Chao replied in the group right away. "Then, Wang Ling, forget about becoming a waiter."</p>

    <p>"???" Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"You can't even smile; there's no way you can do that sort of work. Also, you'll probably get complaints. I heard that your pay will be docked if you get a complaint in that sort of place. If you and your stiff face work there, you might have to compensate the boss several hundred yuan every day."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"You be quiet. Given what Wang Ling's like, I know a job that'll be a pretty good fit for him." At that moment, Guo Hao suddenly came up with an idea.</p>

    <p>"What is it?" Su Xiao was curious.</p>

    <p>"You can be an extra at the cultivation film studio. It's hard but solid work, and they need student actors. I introduced plenty of the guys from the other classes to it, but none of them lasted long."</p>

    <p>"Why not?"</p>

    <p>"Because they laugh every time they act... They are obviously cast members, and in many cases they just pretend to be dead. I think this job is quite suitable for Wang Ling."</p>

    <p>As soon as Guo Hao said that, Wang Ling replied right away: "I'll be counting on you!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had never thought about becoming an idol or whatnot, but he felt that he was well-suited to be an extra. This wasn't an easy path to walk on, however - a two-bit actor who was a new face to a production crew wouldn't get any work for a long time or even be able to eat. They could only wait by the road outside the film studio and wait for production teams that were lacking people to come and recruit them. If you were lucky, you could scrape together one to two hundred yuan after following a crew around for a day. If an extra was lucky enough to be chosen by the director to say a couple of lines, it was possible to rake in several thousand in one day.</p>

    <p>But that was a rare case, after all.</p>

    <p>In the afternoon, Wang Ling arranged to meet Guo Hao at Songhai Film and Television Studio. Film studios were actually common nowadays, but Songhai city's film studio triumphed in terms of scale. Songhai was an international hub of cultural exchange, and its film studio was naturally favored by many domestic and international production teams as well as numerous famous directors.</p>

    <p>Given its large scale, there were plenty of opportunities.</p>

    <p>When cultivators shot films, there already wasn't any need in many cases to rely purely on special effects; when two cultivator actors fought in a scene, they created a lot of the explosions themselves... The point was that it looked a lot more realistic than cheap special effects! And saved on special effects production costs! Thus, a lot of films on the market now were an embellished mix of real cultivator fights and special effects.</p>

    <p>There was no need to invest so much into special effects anymore - only a little brush-up and fine-tuning was needed to make the explosions and fights more striking.</p>

    <p>Wearing his school uniform, Wang Ling waited for a while next to a stele with the words "Songhai Film and Television Studio" on it, and soon saw Master Guo Hao waving at him from afar. As for why he had to wear his uniform, Wang Ling still wasn't clear on this point. Since he was about to make some money, however, it wasn't a big deal. Furthermore, Guo Hao himself was also wearing the school uniform.</p>

    <p>"Let's go. I'll bring you in." Guo Hao took out the actor ID tag which he had prepared in advance and stuck it on his chest; Wang Ling was a little blank when he glanced at this thing.</p>

    <p>"It'll be fine. There'll be an audition later after you enter. Just muddle your way through it - I have an uncle who works in the audition department. Once you get the actor ID tag, it'll be very easy to get into the studio. With the tag, you can bring one person in, sort of like a recommendation." As Guo Hao introduced the studio to Wang Ling, he explained the rules at the same time.</p>

    <p>Just as Wang Ling was about to ask why they had to come in their school uniforms, it was Guo Hao who brought it up first. "It just so happens that my uncle is planning to shoot an online movie with a school theme, and he needs two more people. He wanted me to bring someone over, and I was just about to ask someone else. In the end, you just happened to be looking for a part-time job! Hahaha!"</p>

    <p>"School theme?" asked Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"That's right, this film is pretty awesome - it isn't just a school movie, but is also based on our own school! It's a story about Senior Zhuo! Hang on, l'll DM you the script."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Because of a confidentiality agreement, the script couldn't be made public for now, so Guo Hao couldn't send it in their small group. But since Wang Ling was now part of the studio, Guo Hao thought that letting him take a look was fine. Thus, he created an exclusive group for him and Wang Ling, and sent him the script inside this two-man group called: Oscar Film Emperor.</p>

    <p>Leading Wang Ling over to get an actor ID tag, Guo Hao explained the script to him.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling opened the file which Guo Hao had sent, and the massive film title at the very top jumped out at him.</p>

    <p>Then, Wang Ling took a deep breath...</p>

    <p>Because the film title was: Birth of the Demon Child Zhuo Yi<sup>1</sup>.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Adapted from the animated movie Birth of the Demon Child Nezha..)</dfn>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling heard from Guo Hao that the production team hadn't contacted Zhuo Yi about this matter, but instead directly asked Headmaster Chen for the filming rights. Considering that Number 60 High was going to be upgraded to a key city high school very soon, Headmaster Chen felt that they could seize this opportunity to promote the school, and thus agreed. The most important thing was that it was a famous director who would be directing this film, called Feng Yiwei.</p>

    <p>Of course, what amazed Wang Ling wasn't the film title or its director.</p>

    <p>But the film's content.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling skimmed through the file and read the film outline, he was utterly stupefied... .</p>

    <p>The film outline was such: When the Gate Between Worlds descended six years ago, a Chaos Pearl came into being. With all the experts of the cultivation world joining forces, the Chaos Pearl was refined into a Demon Pearl and an Immortal Pill. The number one sect in the cultivation world, Sixty Gates, set up a large array to destroy the Demon Pearl three years later. The head of Sixty Gates ordered his main disciple, Guo Hao, to place the Immortal Pill inside Zhuo Yi's body. In the end, due to a freak series of errors, the Immortal Pill was secretly replaced, and Zhuo Yi, who should have been born from the Immortal Pill, was born a demon. But Zhuo Yi didn't let his fate control him. He held fast to Sixty Gates' philosophy of punishing and eliminating evil. Because of the Demon Pearl, however, he was misunderstood as a demon who committed all sorts of atrocities, and was made a scapegoat time and time again... Faced with this situation, what would Zhuo Yi do...</p>
