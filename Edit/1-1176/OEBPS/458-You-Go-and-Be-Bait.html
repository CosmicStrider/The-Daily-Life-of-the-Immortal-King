  <h1>Chapter 458 You Go and Be Bait... </h1>

  <div>

    <p>The Z Shake was an extremely particular micro-operation. There were records of a related body movement style in <em>Guide to Glory </em>by Ye Shen, the grandmaster of team tactics. Many people knew of it, but few had mastered it: it was a minute and extremely quick left-and-right movement of the mouse to avoid lethal injury.</p>

    <p>But because this operation was performed so quickly, it was completed in a blink of an eye, so to outsiders watching, it wasn't moving at all, but shaking!</p>

    <p>Little Brother GAYLIGAYQI was really panicking now, and even the bullet messages stopped for a moment. After a few seconds, a large wave of messages flooded the screen; there weren't as many doubting ones now, and a lot of people sent Daoist Guang gifts.</p>

    <p>As fans of Daoist Guang, Light Chasers all felt extremely proud.</p>

    <p>"666! Lord Island is awesome! Looks like a katana is really something!"</p>

    <p>"Lord Island is amazing! There are a lot of professional FPS players who aren't necessarily able to master this kind of body movement!"</p>

    <p>"Those of you who suspected Lord Island of using cheats, let me ask you, are there any body movement cheats nowadays?"</p>

    <p>The fans of other live streamers who had come over to make trouble were embarrassed and at a complete loss at the Light Chasers' pointed questions.</p>

    <p>Because the truth indeed was that most operations nowadays were simple and crude, and it wasn't necessarily possible to design a cheat for a micro-operation like this. Generally, people who could master this kind of micro-operation... without a doubt, they had to be prodigies! Not only did this operation involve the smallest flicker left and right to dodge injury, the accuracy required indeed left people speechless.</p>

    <p>At that time, [Has Three Days And Two Sleeps Been Updated], Daoist Guang's number one fan, used his privileged status to send a high priority bullet message sticky yet again.</p>

    <p>It read: <em>I've DMed a super administrator who will come over straightaway to investigate. I don't know how many water armies and reverse fans there are in the bullet messages, but I hope you will fulfill your promise... If Lord Island is found innocent, please send your gifts. Otherwise, I'll directly look for the super administrator to ban all of you if you send these kinds of bullet messages again!</em></p>

    <p>It was an aggressive and intimidating statement.</p>

    <p>"Brother Sleep is awesome!</p>

    <p>"Oh my god! Brother Sleep actually has a super administrator's contact information?"</p>

    <p>"Who on earth is this person?"</p>

    <p>For the moment, a lot of people were discussing this in the bullet messages.</p>

    <p>There was no shortage of rich big shots on the live streaming platforms, and this "Brother Sleep" was clearly one such example.</p>

    <p>He was able to stand out among millions of people by becoming the number one fan. He wasn't just extravagant with his money; more importantly, he could actually contact a super administrator of the website... This was enough to prove that this person had an unusual identity and was likely on the level of a boss; moreover, it was possible that he and the live streaming platform were collaborators of some sort.</p>

    <p>Someone screencapped "Brother Sheep's" high priority bullet message in the live stream room and sent it to a QQ chat group called "The League of Honest People": "Who on earth is this [Has Three Days And Two Sleeps Been Updated]?"</p>

    <p>"Three Days And Two Sleeps? Could it be the online author Three Days And Two Sleeps?"</p>

    <p>"Oh my god?! Three Days And Two Sleeps?" Some people were stunned because this was an existence on par with Wang Situ!</p>

    <p>"Don't get flustered! It probably isn't... As far as I know, this author ignores his job all the time and has a habit of gaming on Bilibili's live stream. His 'demand more group <sup>1</sup> ' is huge, and he does everything except update. With so many fans focused on him, how can he have the time to watch a live stream?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This refers to readers who
pester authors to update with
new chapters for ongoing
online novels.)</dfn>

    <p>"Agree, agree! Forget watching the live stream, if his wife finds out he's given so many gifts to a new live streamer, she would probably break his legs!"</p>

    <p>"What? Three Days And Two Sleeps is married? When? How come I didn't know?"</p>

    <p>"Are you a Net villager<sup>2</sup>? He even has children! Do you know why there are so many novels about stay-at-home dads lately? I heard that it was Three Days And Two Sleeps who hired people to write them!" Saying that, the speaker sent an amused emoji.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This refers to someone behind in the times or latest news.)</dfn>

    <p>Given the discussion that was happening, some people couldn't help but want to check out the live stream.</p>

    <p>This topic continued to brew and spread widely online.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, the number of people watching Daoist Guang's live stream at the same time had also increased from close to four million to more than 4.8 million. This spike in numbers was really baffling. However, there were onlookers adding fuel to the fire, as well as many jeering fans of other live streamers, otherwise there was no way the number could have reached this point.</p>

    <p>While the live stream room was being very noisy, Daoist Guang had already struck Little Brother GAYLIGAYQI with his katana, and half of his health was instantly gone!</p>

    <p>This little brother immediately had his character crouch down. "Brother! Please don't kill me!"</p>

    <p>After thinking for a moment, Daoist Guang didn't cut him down again; he noticed that this player had already thrown down his firearm, and even the bullets littered the floor...</p>

    <p>This dramatic scene made the game even more interesting and the live stream room became even more lively.</p>

    <p>"Lord Island! Don't just stand there! Hurry up and kill him! There's less than fifty people left now..."</p>

    <p>"Reminder, live streamer, you still have eighteen people to kill!"</p>

    <p>Some people couldn't help sending reminders in the bullet messages, but Daoist Guang didn't look at them at all.</p>

    <p>He switched the katana out for his frying pan and couldn't help laughing. "Young man, you have promise!"</p>

    <p>The dazzling katana disappeared, which made Little Brother GAYLIGAYQI sigh in relief. "Brother, you're so awesome! Shall we team up? If we get to the last circle and we're still alive, how about we fight to the death then?"</p>

    <p>"Fight to the death? No, that doesn't make any sense at all."</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang shook his head and directly rejected him. "You can't fight against me for sure."</p>

    <p>Little Brother GAYLIGAYQI: "..."</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang: "In addition to the Z Shake, I can in fact also do the S and M Shakes... Of the twenty-six letters in the English alphabet, I've already mastered half of them. Are you going to bludgeon me with your head instead?"</p>

    <p>Little Brother GAYLIGAYQI: "..."</p>

    <p>Saying this, Daoist Guang also crouched down. They were standing on a high vantage point. When they crouched down, they were completely hidden, so no one could hit them at all.</p>

    <p>Little Brother GAYLIGAYQI didn't know whether to cry or laugh. "Then brother, what should we do... If I can follow you, getting second place is good enough for me!"</p>

    <p>"Second place is meaningless. Young man, you have to be a little more ambitious!" Daoist Guang smiled.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"I can make you champion; for me, killing twenty people is enough."</p>

    <p>"Ah? Then brother expert, what do you want me to do?"</p>

    <p>"Very simple: you go and be bait!"</p>

    <p>Bait?</p>

    <p>This little brother understood and immediately nodded in agreement. "I'll do it! I'll be the bait! Brother expert, you can pick up the gun and bullets on the floor, your shooting skills must be very accurate!"</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang tsked. "When did I say I was going to use a gun?"</p>

    <p>The little brother gave a wobbly smile. "Brother expert, you don't use a gun... but you still want to kill twenty people? Are you really going to chop down twenty people with this katana?"</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang's face said 'Naturally.'"That's right!"</p>

    <p>The little brother: "..."</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang looked at the map; the next circle had started to shrink.</p>

    <p>The city they were squatting in happened to be the safe zone! Soon, there would be a huge wave of people rushing here from all over the place!</p>

    <p>For Daoist Guang, this was a great opportunity to carry out his slaughter!</p>

    <p>"Look at the map. We're right in the middle of the safe zone. Very soon, a lot of people will be rushing over here."</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang said intently, "There are less than fifty people left; your mission is to lure them in! Put on a good show, little brother, I'm a live streamer! Right now, more than four million brothers are watching you on the live stream!"</p>

    <p>The little brother: "..."</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang: "Don't worry, I said earlier that the whole game is my pig farm! I can guarantee you'll be the winner! I won't move from here, you go down the tower and lure in as many people as possible! The best is to trigger a 'ten thousand pigs swarming the tower <sup>3</sup> ' outcome by taunting the crowd <sup>4</sup> ."</p>

    <p>The little brother: "..."</p>
