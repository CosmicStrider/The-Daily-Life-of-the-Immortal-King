  <h1>Chapter 939 Group Leader Detention Island</h1>

  <div>

    <p>As group leaders in the water army under the Governor, they were assigned Internet cafes from which they had to log into their accounts. The Internet cafe in Crow County was located in a very remote area.</p>

    <p>It was a small county town with some parts that were still underdeveloped, and which engaged mainly in agriculture and animal husbandry. Most of the pork Zhai Yin used to fry dragon pork chops was imported from Crow County.</p>

    <p>Well... That was to say, the dragon pig which this little Crow County bred had almost poisoned and killed the Ten Founding Generals...</p>

    <p>When the Internet cafe's doors slid open, all eyes turned to a delicate and pretty-looking young lady. She was very tall, had fair skin, and had long hair which fell down to her waist, giving people the sense of first love.</p>

    <p>"What a comely young lady..."</p>

    <p>"She's probably not from our Crow County, is she? Crow County only has a few pretty girls."</p>

    <p>"She's likely from out of town. Honestly speaking, the girls from outside are all fair."</p>

    <p>"How many points?"</p>

    <p>"Ninety-five - five points off for her chest. Size A is not good enough."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>From what everyone could see, Evil Sword God's crossdressing was pretty successful. Thanks to the handful of minutes which Old Devil and Master of Immortal Mansion Cheng Yu had spent in prison diligently practicing their cosmetic skills, Evil Sword God in women's clothes was enough to pass for the real thing.</p>

    <p>Considering that there might be spies of the Governor in the Internet cafe, the Old Devil and the others didn't act together, but sent in Evil Sword God alone.</p>

    <p>But the prison trio were using the "my network sharing center" technique!</p>

    <p>That was to say, the three of them were sharing their vision and minds at that moment.</p>

    <p>What Evil Sword God saw and heard now would be transmitted to the Old Devil's and Cheng Yu's minds at the same time.</p>

    <p>The chat app which this Internet water army group used was an autonomous one. Huang Youliang had already given them both the username and the password, along with the voice changer, which was in a secret cloud drive and needed to be downloaded.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, Evil Sword God wasn't too out of touch with society. His computer skills were pretty good and he wasn't a complete newbie.</p>

    <p>When he murdered his <em>shifu</em>, he had done a Qiandu search online: <em>how to kill your shifu?</em></p>

    <p>The first five pages were all promoted results for secret weapons.</p>

    <p>The search results were still fresh in Evil Sword God's mind.</p>

    <p>"[Ad] Putian System <sup>1</sup> Consecrated Shuriken, only 998 immortal gold for one...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Wei Zexi was a student who
died after receiving
experimental treatment for
his cancer following a
promoted search result on
Baidu, leading to criticism
of Baidu's advertising
practices. His death also brought attention to the
Putian system, which is a
group of hospitals that rely
heavily on online ads ..)</dfn>

    <p>"[Ad] Putian System Gilded and Diamond-Studded Flying Guillotine, 666 immortal gold. Buy one and get three gifts...</p>

    <p>"[Ad] Putian System Secret Weapon Store. For the first 6 yuan you spend, you get a small dragon sword hanging ornament!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At this time, the Old Devil's voice rang out in the shared mental space. "Old Evil, stop recalling the past. The mission is our priority."</p>

    <p>"Okay..." Evil Sword God's thoughts settled and he got to work.</p>

    <p>Username, check.</p>

    <p>Password, check.</p>

    <p>The voice changer was ready.</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God then took a deep breath and clicked "ENTER."</p>

    <p>In a blink of an eye, the scene before him changed as he was actually pulled into a city which felt full of technology.</p>

    <p>"What's going on?" Evil Sword God was a little confused. This development was somewhat unexpected.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, the trio's mental space was connected, so Evil Sword God wasn't flustered.</p>

    <p>"This should be the inner world of the water army. Sure enough, there's something wrong with this Internet cafe. They use their accounts to set up a space passage. After logging in with their usernames, the group leaders will arrive in another space world." The Old Devil's voice rang out inside Evil Sword God's head with his analysis.</p>

    <p>If so, it made sense for the Governor to require all group leaders to go to a designated Internet cafe to operate the chat group.</p>

    <p>Using his Demon Eyes, Evil Sword God tried to spread his power of sight throughout the world, and the trio had a panoramic view of the whole world.</p>

    <p>This was a small world located in an independent space. It looked like an island which was surrounded by a space spirit sea, which was very much in the style of "a water army."</p>

    <p>Seeing this, the prison trio was inwardly surprised.</p>

    <p>"It looks like there has to be an Almighty moving the pieces behind the Governor. It's impossible for the Governor to open up an independent space with his strength alone," the Old Devil said.</p>

    <p>How rich were the experiences of the trio?</p>

    <p>While their strength was currently sealed, their abundant knowledge and experiences as experts with True Immortal battle strength couldn't be sealed; they could discern how strong this spatial spell was with one glance.</p>

    <p>This was one of the main reasons why General Bai decided to implement this "atonement program" for the prison trio. There were few True Immortal experts to begin with. Naturally, it would be very good if they could be used.</p>

    <p>For experts, a direct execution wasn't actually a heavy price.</p>

    <p>When the Old Devil shared a projected image with Huang Youliang, the latter's face was ashen and he was frightened to death. This "group leader" position wasn't what he had expected. He had thought he just needed to urge members in the group to post; he never thought he could be pulled into this sort of independent space world.</p>

    <p>"It's clear you were duped."</p>

    <p>Looking at the shocked expression on Huang Youliang's face, the Old Devil said, "The group leader position you bought with five million HNY and a villa didn't gain you anything - the design of this world space is a bit like a prison. Once you enter, you're basically trapped and can't get out unless you destroy the core hub."</p>

    <p>"I was tricked?" Huang Youliang found it hard to believe.</p>

    <p>What Evil Sword God experienced next in this small world further confirmed Old Devil's conjecture.</p>

    <p>A crossdressing Evil Sword God suddenly fell into this space.</p>

    <p>Such a "lovely and comely" girl suddenly dropping in would naturally attract the attention of the people nearby.</p>

    <p>Something wasn't right about these people. Most of them were bald and they moved like zombies, drooling and grinning horribly as they stared at him.</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God was a little scared at being stared at, and he yelled in all directions, "You... Who are you?!"</p>

    <p>As soon as he spoke, even Evil Sword God himself was taken aback... Because it wasn't his voice! This was very clearly the cute little sister effect of the voice changer...</p>

    <p>The Old Devil and Cheng Yu almost got hard when they heard it.</p>

    <p>"Looks like you weren't completely cheated. This is a genuine voice changer," the Old Devil said.</p>

    <p>Huang Youliang: "..."</p>

    <p>The Old Devil reasoned that the voice changer probably wasn't just purely software, but had been enhanced with special magic. When the software was activated, the voice would have special sound effects for a period of time.</p>

    <p>At that moment, the men in this world surrounded Evil Sword God like zombies.</p>

    <p>"Why don't you come with us, little cutie? You can't get out. This is Group Leader Detention Island..."</p>

    <p>"Come on, let's have fun. In any case, we have plenty of time..."</p>

    <p>"I never thought an actual female group leader would land here."</p>

    <p>This group moved toward Evil Sword God as they spoke.</p>

    <p>And what horrified the prison trio...</p>

    <p>Was that this bunch of disgusting men all had modified female voices!</p>

    <p>It turned out that there weren't any real women among the water army group leaders!</p>
