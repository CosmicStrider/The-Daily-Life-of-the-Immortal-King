  <h1>Chapter 837 The Art of the Electroshock</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Yang Huai had a habit of recording while carrying out the treatment. This wasn't because he wanted to enjoy the pain of his "patients," but purely because he wanted to do his best in his electrotherapy. In each treatment, the power output had to be manipulated in line with the different cultivator realms, and he used the videos to repeatedly make alterations.</p>

    <p>Generally speaking, when the medical apparatus was activated, it caused pain, but not to the point of knocking a person out or killing them, which was the most ideal result.</p>

    <p>Yang Huai knew that back when the treatment unit first opened, his ancestor hadn't modulated the power output of the medical device, and accidentally electrocuted several people to death, which put the treatment unit in a predicament for a while.</p>

    <p>But every time something like this happened, the families of the other patients would ultimately suppress it.</p>

    <p>Their view was that it was already hopeless for their children, so this kind of treatment was their only hope. As therapists who fixed abnormal behavior, Yang Huai's ancestors were at one point emperors in the treatment field due to the support of these families.</p>

    <p>Gifts were sent over daily, and every day they soaked up the praise and worship. Even if someone came to stir up trouble, it would be strangled in the cradle by their "people." The Yang family never had to worry about anything except for treating their patients.</p>

    <p>"This is valuable video data. Mr Long Ming, I hope you'll keep it to yourself after watching it." Yang Huai took out a DVD and smiled at Long Ming.</p>

    <p>Although this Dr Yang was nowhere near as powerful as Long Ming, the latter couldn't help the shiver that ran through his body at the demonic curl of the other man's lips.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Long Ming noticed that Yang Huai's DVDs were unique: they were made of a material that was resistant to fire and water, and even dust. The surface of each DVD was spotless.</p>

    <p>When Yang Huai pushed a DVD into the player, he sighed. "Unfortunately, there wasn't this type of convenient technology in those days. Otherwise, the data my ancestors collected wouldn't have burned."</p>

    <p>Long Ming kept silent and merely gazed at the screen.</p>

    <p>The player very quickly finished reading the DVD.</p>

    <p>A young man in a white short-sleeved shirt appeared on the screen.</p>

    <p>If Yang Huai hadn't said it himself, it would have been very hard for Long Ming to believe that this was actually a Soul Formation deputy sect leader.</p>

    <p>At that very moment, the young man's four limbs were being restrained by five big men: four held down his arms and legs, and one put a ball gag in his mouth so that he wouldn't bite his tongue during the treatment.</p>

    <p>His wrists and ankles were promptly tied down.</p>

    <p>"In any case, he was a strong Soul Formation cultivator, so I gave him special treatment. Besides restraining his movements with shackles and fetters, I had men hold him down," Yang Huai explained as he admired his work.</p>

    <p>In the video, the medical apparatus used on the deputy sect leader was the very one in front of Long Ming.</p>

    <p>It might appear nothing special to look at, but it contained terrifying power.</p>

    <p>"Were you wrong?" Yang Huai spoke slowly in the video, his voice as cold as an ice cavern. In the quiet treatment room, there was only the clattering sounds of the deputy sect leader struggling against the restraints... as well as the faint electric buzz at the tip of the medical device's small stun gun.</p>

    <p>"Take the gag out, let him speak," Yang Huai ordered the big man who had gagged the deputy sect leader.</p>

    <p>Each treatment didn't take long, just ten to thirty seconds, but the deputy sect leader's head was already sweating. His face was deathly white, like a zombie that had just emerged from a coffin.</p>

    <p>"It was him... who had you bring me here..." The deputy sect leader clearly had no idea what happened, but after waking up, he could roughly guess the current situation.</p>

    <p>"Wrong answer."</p>

    <p>Before the man finished asking his question, Yang Huai had already switched the apparatus back on.</p>

    <p>An electric current straightaway flowed from the temple to the brain and down the brain stem to spread non-stop throughout the body from the spine.</p>

    <p>Wisps of white smoke curled up from where he had been shocked.</p>

    <p>"This is..." Through the screen, Long Ming unexpectedly caught a whiff of the smell of roasted meat.</p>

    <p>"This is the latest recording technology; even smells can be preserved," Yang Huai replied.</p>

    <p>Long Ming: "..."</p>

    <p>In here, you had to answer all questions accurately; you had to reply to whatever question was asked, and your answer had to be correct, otherwise you would face the next round of treatment.</p>

    <p>In the video, Yang Huai said again, "Mr Deputy Sect Leader, it would be better for you to admit your mistake as soon as possible. Of course, you can also choose to continue receiving treatment. After this first treatment course is over, you'll have a week to recover."</p>

    <p>Yang Huai's hands paused and he withdrew the stun gun so that the young man was completely clear-headed and could understand every word Yang Huai said when the latter explained the situation to him.</p>

    <p>Yang Huai: "In the first treatment course, you will receive compulsory and continuous treatment for thirty days. For the first ten days, you will be shocked with electricity for 3,600 seconds each day. Once you get used to it, the amount of time will increase from 3,600 seconds to 7,200 seconds."</p>

    <p>The deputy sect leader was silent for a moment before he said, "Is this treatment or extorting a confession, <em>ZZZ</em>, <em>ZZZ</em>, <em>ZZZ</em>..."</p>

    <p>Before he could finish speaking, there was the sound of an electric current again: <em>ZZZ...</em></p>

    <p>"Were you wrong?"</p>

    <p>"Five-nut mooncakes are really delicious!"</p>

    <p><em>ZZZ...</em></p>

    <p>"Do you still dare talk back to Mr Sect Leader in the future?"</p>

    <p>"I'm the deputy sect leader, he has no right to do this to me! Karma will get him, and he'll answer to the board!!"</p>

    <p><em>ZZZ...</em></p>

    <p>"You actually like five-nut mooncakes, you heretic! You're just as blind as those people who eat salty beancurd or fruit pancakes with <em>youtiao </em>!"</p>

    <p><em>ZZZ...</em></p>

    <p>"You devil! You'll get what's coming to you sooner or later!"</p>

    <p>"You actually dare struggle? I'll make you struggle then... go on and struggle..."</p>

    <p><em>ZZZ ZZZ...</em></p>

    <p>Long Ming: "..."</p>

    <p>After who knew how many times, the deputy sect leader finally fainted after countless electroshocks. By then, Long Ming could already smell something that seemed like steak.</p>

    <p>At that moment, the big men loosened their hold.</p>

    <p>Because the deputy sect leader had already passed out.</p>

    <p>"Dr Yang, are we going too far? Actually, I think five-nut mooncakes are alright..."</p>

    <p>"You heretic, do you also want to be treated?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"But Dr Yang, it seems that this Mr Deputy Sect Leader is already cooked..."</p>

    <p>Yang Huai leaned over to take a sniff. He then stuck out his tongue to lick the young man's cheek. "Mm, about medium rare."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Yang Huai: "Wake him up with an injection and continue with the treatment. We took in so many patients recently, our food expenses are through the roof. Hm... To save money, if the deputy sect leader's treatment continues to fail and he ends up cooked by the electric shocks... he'll become food rations."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
