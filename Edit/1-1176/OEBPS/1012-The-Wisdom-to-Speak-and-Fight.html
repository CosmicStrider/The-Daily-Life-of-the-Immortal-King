  <h1>Chapter 1012 The Wisdom to Speak and Fight</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After Fang Xing left, the confinement room returned to silence. Gazing in the direction that Fang Xing left in, True Immortal She Pi suddenly felt a little melancholy. He never thought that after his resurrection, he would actually meet the child that he had left behind before his death.</p>

    <p>"Blademaster, you can come out now." Immortal She Pi took a deep breath, then turned his gaze to the side.</p>

    <p>Inside the room, an old man in a white training outfit and a red sash around his waist took form out of nothingness.</p>

    <p>"Sure enough, the boundless colored sword qi of Boundless Sword Dao deserves its name," Immortal She Pi said to the old man with a smile. This was a protective sword qi which changed the structure of the surrounding space structure based on the principle of the three primary colors and which allowed the user to blend into the background like a chameleon. When the boundless colored sword qi was released, it could cover traces of the user completely.</p>

    <p>Such a superb sword art required an extremely high understanding and demand of sword qi, and only the Blademaster was capable of this.</p>

    <p>Immortal She Pi found General Yi's appearance here a little unexpected, but the latter said, "It looks like you've already made your decision."</p>

    <p>"My sacrifice had always been part of the plan." Immortal She Pi shook his head calmly. "Catching Shadow is the key to saving everything."</p>

    <p>"While I've been nominally retired all these years, I've been looking everywhere for clues on this "Shadow,' but with nothing to show for it. That boy whom Fang Xing is close to also doesn't match with our understanding of Shadow. He's very strong, however, so based on the theory that power attracts power, we might finally get a lead through him."</p>

    <p>"Old Yi, we don't have much time left. The only way the world can become peaceful once more is by pulling out our opponent this time at the root."</p>

    <p>"Mm." General Yi nodded. "It's just that you've been wronged in this matter."</p>

    <p>"There's nothing to feel wronged about; I'm no longer worried after seeing how well he's living." Immortal She Pi gave a sigh. "Besides that... how is my <em>shifu </em>doing?"</p>

    <p>"That lovesick Gua Pi is still in prison, and he's surprisingly naive. This is also thanks to you, for pretending to be his disciple back then, which was an excellent way of hiding your identity."</p>

    <p>"He isn't a bad person," said Immortal She Pi.</p>

    <p>"I know." General Yi nodded. "But he's still a fool."</p>

    <p>During their conversation, Immortal She Pi's body had started to glow, and was gradually turning into light particles from the bottom up.</p>

    <p>"It seems that the Palace of Mirrors is peaceful once more; it's time for me to go." Immortal She Pi looked at his fading body. There was no pain, as he was simply becoming a spirit once again. He had already died once, and naturally had no extra emotions about it.</p>

    <p>As part of Magnificent Immortal's secret service division, Immortal She Pi had carried out classified investigations into Shadow's secret, which was vital to the survival of the cultivation world.</p>

    <p>"Is there anything else you want to say?" General Yi asked just before Immortal She Pi vanished.</p>

    <p>"Tell him I love him 3000 times<sup>1</sup>."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(From Tony Stark's memorable line in "Avengers: Endgame.")</dfn>

    <p>"Alright."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>September 12th, the thirtieth day of the summer break.</p>

    <p>The black shadow army's plot completely fell apart under the joint efforts of experts from various factions. Peace returned to the Palace of Mirrors and order was restored in both worlds. The cultivators who had been murdered by the black shadow army in the real world were brought back to life through the formidable power of Divine Dao, and their memories of the Palace of Mirrors were sealed away.</p>

    <p>However, since news about the surprise attack had already spread in the real world, the International Cultivators Association naturally wouldn't be indifferent about it.</p>

    <p>The black shadow army had retreated too quickly, however, and the mastermind behind the scenes had yet to be found. Thus, the association could only make up a story for the public in order to keep the cultivation world calm and united.</p>

    <p>Thus, at noon that day, Guo Ping, as the diplomatic peace ambassador to outer space, and Lord Diulei, who had been dispatched to carry out the peace-keeping mission this time, showed up at the conference site.</p>

    <p>At noon, Wang Ling cuddled Er Ha in front of the TV and silently watched the two individuals put on a pompous show...</p>

    <p>The first person to appear was Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>The Office of Strategic Deception had barely been established when its fame already spread far and wide. After Lord Diulei became a True Venerated, the sect's international reputation further stepped up a notch, and the title Great Death-Courting Senior was already a household name in the cultivation world. Factoring in Huaxiu Alliance's high regard for the Office of Strategic Deception, Lord Diulei was now a famous and major figure, and not just the owner of a small cultivation forum any longer.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei and Guo Ping took their places for the press conference, and the camera turned to Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>A caption instantly appeared under his image: "Chief of Huaxiu's Sky-level first-class sect General Office of Strategic Deception: Lord Diulei."</p>

    <p>What followed was a round of questions from the reporters.</p>

    <p>A tall female reporter raised her hand. "Lord Diulei, the Office of Strategic Deception's peace-keeping mission this time was a huge success. Does this mean that the Office's strength has already reached the pinnacle of the cultivation world?"</p>

    <p>This first question was very pointed.</p>

    <p>But Lord Diulei had already prepared an answer.</p>

    <p>Since ancient times, what was the best virtue Huaxiu cultivators could possess?</p>

    <p>Naturally, it was modesty!</p>

    <p>Since this was a news conference held by Huaxiu Alliance, Lord Diulei had already prepared his speech beforehand.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei sighed slowly. "Our Office of Strategic Deception has been able to grow to this extent largely because of our sect's stable foundation. The Heavenly Dao broccoli we produce is now exported to cultivation nations all over the world. Currently, the waiting list for our Heavenly Dao broccoli is up to five hundred years. It is because of this trade that our sect was able to gain a place in the world rankings. But in fact, we're still very weak."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "???"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Our sect's team leaders neglect their daily duties, which I'm deeply concerned about. One only knows how to play games and one has yet to marry despite being two thousand years old, unable to free himself of his addiction to the shut-in game <em>Arknights </em>... We are a newly established sect; how can we talk about reaching the top in the cultivation world if we can't even maintain discipline in our sect? All this is just overblown praise..."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>The female reporter: "Then, if you aren't the best, why was the Office of Strategic Decision dispatched for this peace-keeping mission?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Maybe we were chosen through a drawing of straws. Everything was arranged by the higher-ups; we could only obey. Given the outcome, we can be considered quite lucky as we were able to drive off those alien invaders."</p>

    <p>The aggressive female reporter turned to Guo Ping. "Ambassador Guo, can you tell us what kind of alien attack was it, at this critical time when we are establishing diplomatic relations with Divine Dao Star?"</p>

    <p>"They were aliens from a far-off place; we're currently investigating their exact origins."</p>

    <p>Guo Ping had long foreseen this question, and straightaway replied, "During this crucial moment when we are establishing diplomatic relations with outer space, we will not stand for any behavior that will obstruct the development of cosmic peace. At the same time, a word of advice to any alien lifeforms watching the news who want to act against Earth: there is still time to stop now. We welcome all alien creatures who want to establish diplomatic relations with Earth through peace negotiations! In short: we are open to talks, but will fight to the end if that is your stance <sup>2</sup> ! Earth cultivators have over ten thousand years of history - what kind of situation haven't we encountered before?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(China's oft-quoted political stance..)</dfn>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
