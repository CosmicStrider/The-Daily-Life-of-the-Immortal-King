  <h1>Chapter 769 The Proper Way to Clear the Game</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Because everyone's minds were connected, Wang Ming and the others at the moment were like "dream stealers" who had come to help the dreamer Beast King clear the game. But since Wang Ming had hacked into this game world, he himself could also be considered a fake dreamer.</p>

    <p>"Wait a bit, I'll make you some clothes." Wang Ming had never seen Luo Chuang crossdress before, and was actually very curious...</p>

    <p>A few seconds later, Wang Ming used his technological skills to directly transform Luo Chuang's clothes in public, replacing them with a black-and-red Lolita maid outfit.</p>

    <p>"Well, does it look good?" Luo Chuang twirled happily on the spot, the expression on his face like a brilliant chrysanthemum.</p>

    <p>WTF!</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin covered his eyes with both hands...</p>

    <p>He had truly been stung!</p>

    <p>Somehow, his eyes didn't feel like they were his anymore!</p>

    <p>They felt very spicy!</p>

    <p>They burned with heat, like when that female live streamer had used essential balm on her "divine artifact<sup>1</sup>"!</p>

    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is a reference to the well-known female live streamer Han Xiya, who once put essential balm on her private parts when a viewer said he would send her money as a gift for it. Five seconds after she applied it, she started to cry from the pain, and when she couldn't wash it off, she ended up going to the hospital. She never got the money.)</dfn>

    <p>"Sure enough, you either only crossdress once, or you crossdress many times!" Zhuo Yi sighed.</p>

    <p>Look at how Luo Chuang was smiling so happily...</p>

    <p>He already looked like some negligent author, suddenly developing some strange quirk.</p>

    <p>That's right!</p>

    <p>Three Days And Two Sleeps!</p>

    <p>That's you!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>According to the normal development of the game storyline, Beast King's character "Connor" had to save the little girl to complete the mission.</p>

    <p>Now, Beast King had officially pissed off the android Daniel. With Beast King's next decision, this Daniel would definitely kill the little girl and then commit suicide to die with her.</p>

    <p>Since Beast King didn't want to win at all, he would definitely continue choosing the weird options to provoke Daniel.</p>

    <p>Thus, they already had no other choice at that very moment.</p>

    <p>"I'll help you do the switch!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming used his skills to directly switch Luo Chuang with the little girl hostage.</p>

    <p>But what they hadn't expected was how this switch would unexpectedly change the entire storyline...</p>

    <p>When Daniel, who had originally been clutching the little girl as he stood on the edge of the roof, saw that the little girl in his hands had turned into Luo Chuang wearing a maid outfit, a terrified expression actually came over his face... Oh god! Who the hell was this guy??</p>

    <p>Where was his Medusa?</p>

    <p>Where the hell did Medusa go?</p>

    <p>"Who... are you?" Daniel was utterly shocked.</p>

    <p>"How should I put it?" Luo Chuang said sheepishly, tugging at the hem of his maid's dress. "I hate to admit it, but I'm your Medusa!"</p>

    <p>Daniel grabbed his head and almost broke down. "No... there's no way my Medusa looks like this!"</p>

    <p>At that moment, options appeared again.</p>

    <p>"Read Daniel a poem △"</p>

    <p>"Win Daniel's trust □"</p>

    <p>"Goad Daniel with a skeptical attitude ○"</p>

    <p>"Crossdress with the hostage ×"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The instant Beast King chose "○," his character Connor continued talking to Daniel. "Daniel! Wake up! Admit it, it's not Medusa that you love, but her looks!"</p>

    <p>Daniel blew his top. "No! I really love her! I love her more than anything! But Medusa only loves Yandi and Yandi's dick! If you want me to let Medusa go, then restore my factory settings! Don't shut down my thing, that's all I want! Let it grow as long as it wants!"</p>

    <p>"Reach a compromise with Daniel △"</p>

    <p>"Goad Daniel □"</p>

    <p>"Reject Daniel directly ○"</p>

    <p>"Egg Daniel into kissing the hostage ×"</p>

    <p>Beast King selected: ×</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Connor: "I can forward your demand on to Membrane Control Life to restore your factory settings! But you must lay down your weapon and prove to me that it's not Medusa's looks that you love, but Medusa herself! You must kiss her!"</p>

    <p>Daniel darted a glance at the gorgeously dressed Luo Chuang, and swallowed in some fear. He then looked at Connor. "I can kiss Medusa... But this isn't her! Medusa doesn't have a poker rod down there at all!"</p>

    <p>"You've always had Medusa, from the moment you kidnapped her! What you were seeing was just your delusion! Medusa is the same as she ever was! If you refuse to kiss her, it just proves that you don't love her at all! As long as you kiss the hostage, I promise I'll curse the humans online with you!"</p>

    <p>Connor bellowed, "Everyone says keyboards are good! Curse from behind the screen! Hold that keyboard high! Vent until you're satisfied!"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Daniel: "But..."</p>

    <p>Connor: "No 'buts,' Daniel! If you are truly an android with real feelings, I don't think kissing will be a problem for you! If you don't kiss her, it only proves that you don't have feelings for Medusa! Tell me, who the hell are you?"</p>

    <p>Daniel was about to go crazy. "I'm Daniel!"</p>

    <p>This time, only two system options appeared.</p>

    <p>"You're not Daniel △"</p>

    <p>"Let's begin with the end of the universe □"</p>

    <p>Beast King chose: □...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Connor: "Then let's begin with the end of the universe! You can be Daniel, I can also be Daniel, we can all be Daniels! Daniel, this is just a codename, a name! But if we take this codename away, then who are you? An android? Or a human?"</p>

    <p>Daniel: "Your... Your question is meaningless!"</p>

    <p>"Then let's talk about something that has meaning!"</p>

    <p>Connor quickly continued speaking. "Where did we come from when we were born? Where will we go when we die? Why am I on this rooftop persuading you to kiss the hostage? What meaning do you have in this world? Are we inevitably connected to the universe? Does the universe have an end? Does a dick have a certain length? Can one that has been shut down be restarted? Can Medusa still climb onto your rundown ship with her old boat ticket? Are you asking the same question you heard just now?"</p>

    <p>Daniel fell to his knees and Luo Chuang realized that Daniel had actually let go of him.</p>

    <p>Daniel's mental state was extremely unstable now. "No! I love her! I want to kiss her! '</p>

    <p>Connor yelled, "Who kissed her, and who did you kiss?"</p>

    <p>Daniel froze. He looked up blankly. "I... kissed myself?"</p>

    <p>Connor: "Correct answer. Do it!"</p>

    <p>Under everyone's stunned gazes, Daniel bellowed painfully, and with all his strength, he pulled off his own head and pressed the lips to his body. This burst of strength caused him to topple backward and directly fall off the roof...</p>

    <p>And at that moment, the system also sent a prompt.</p>

    <p>[Congratulations, you have completed your mission.]</p>

    <p>Completed Plot: Rescue the little girl hostage Medusa</p>

    <p>Completed Plot 2: Successfully kill Daniel while the little girl survives</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was stunned. "This... can also fucking work..."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>
