  <h1>Chapter 108 The Wang Ling Aid Project </h1>

  <div>

    <p>These two days, Zhuo Yi had been busy focusing on a government charity fund aid program for poor students in urban areas. The charity fund was a joint venture between many large enterprises, Huaguo Water Curtain Group being one of them. It just so happened that this fund aid project was being trialed in Peiyuan district. So when Zhuo Yi saw that Wang Ling's name was actually on the aid list, he had been completely stunned.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's name had been included on the list at Headmaster Chen's personal endorsement after Teacher Pan had applied to Director Xie on Wang Ling's behalf. After all, the whole school knew how "terrible" his family situation was. In an era when house prices weren't that expensive, they couldn't afford to live in the school district zone in the city. Every day, Wang Ling had to get up early for a two-hour spirit bus ride to school. Moreover, he hadn't been able to bring a decent spirit sword along with him to the spirit sword exchange meet.</p>

    <p>To use Teacher Pan's six-word summary from the report on poor students which she had submitted previously: so miserable, so woeful, so sorrowful <sup>1</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is a line from a poem by renowned 11th to 12th century Chinese female poet Li Qingzhao.)</dfn>

    <p>Zhuo Yi had always harbored deep feelings for Wang Ling this little <em>shifu, </em>so of course he would pay particular attention to this matter. If <em>shifu </em>was in trouble, there was no way that he as <em>shifu's </em> disciple would ignore it.</p>

    <p>The government had allocated quite a substantial amount of charity funds this time, but there was a limit nonetheless and massive numbers of students had applied for it. Zhuo Yi's current task was to remove from the list students from middle class families who saw themselves as very poor and to strike off those from rich families who had deliberately applied for fun.</p>

    <p>It had taken Zhuo Yi two whole days to whittle down the number of student applications in Peiyuan district from three million to three thousand.</p>

    <p>One of the biggest fakers was Lin Xiaocong! This was a famous rich second generation known throughout the country. He talked big and was a bit overbearing. Unfortunately, no one could do anything about it because his father was Lin Sicong. "My father is Sicong" was this rich second generation's standard pet phrase.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi felt that he was a honest and upright official who had never accepted any gifts or money — he would always send back any anonymous express deliveries he received at his staff apartment. This time though, Zhuo Yi really had to harden his resolve to break his own principles... <em>shifu's </em> business was his business. There were three thousand applicants in total, and the chances of a successful application were very slim.</p>

    <p>Hence, after careful consideration, Zhuo Yi decided to help Wang Ling get in through the back door.</p>

    <p><em>If I can help </em>shifu <em>secure a position, wouldn't this be a step forward in my relationship with him?</em></p>

    <p>As he was thinking this, he had already made a call to the Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools' Secretary Office.</p>

    <p>He didn't have to wait long before the call was picked up and the old leader's voice immediately came on. "Hello, is that Little Zhuo?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, it's me, Secretary Sun."</p>

    <p>On the other end of the call, Secretary Sun frowned. "You were just appointed as Director of the General Administration of 100 Schools. Didn't I tell the HR department to let you take a short break? Why are you still working?"</p>

    <p>"I've been busy with the charity fund trial program these two days, so I haven't been able to take leave. I'll rest when I'm done," Zhuo Yi answered honestly.</p>

    <p>"Mm, the children always come first. Little Zhuo, I was right about you!"</p>

    <p>The old Secretary nodded with satisfaction. "So, why have you called me this time?"</p>

    <p>There was a saying, "one never goes to the temple without reason." As someone who had been immersed in politics for a very long time, Secretary Sun was very familiar with the ins and outs of the business; he would usually directly reject this type of phone call. But this was Zhuo Yi, so Secretary Sun would naturally treat it differently. This was the excellent leader who had been ranked first in the general poll. If he was calling to ask for help, there was a high chance that he had run into some trouble.</p>

    <p>"It's like this, Secretary Sun, it's about the charity fund. I want to help one student in particular..." said Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>"Which student is that?" Secretary Sun frowned. Why did this somehow sound like an imperial declaration?</p>

    <p>"Does Secretary Sun remember the student who used the wooden sword at the spirit sword exchange meet between Number 59 High School and Number 60 High School?"</p>

    <p>The old Secretary was nonplussed for a moment, then patted his head. "Oh! So it's him! I remember hearing all of you say that this student's family situation isn't very good, that they couldn't even afford a house in a school zone in the city."</p>

    <p>"Yes! That's right, that's him! I'm glad Secretary Sun still remembers him!"</p>

    <p>"Of course I do. I remember that this student was very special and had a different air about him. Just think, with so many people watching at the spirit sword exchange meet, he hadn't cared at all that he had gone on stage with a wooden sword."</p>

    <p>"Then, old Secretary, what do you think of this Student Wang Ling?"</p>

    <p>Secretary Sun thought for a moment before he spoke. "He gives me the feeling... of integrity born out of poverty!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>"I understand your concerns, but you are now the Director of the General Administration of 100 Schools, so you have the final say on matters in Songhai city. You don't have to report to me; you have full authority to handle this matter as you see best. However poor we are, we cannot be poor in education — for such a righteous student, we should be even more diligent in nurturing him so that he will certainly become a pillar of the state in the future!"</p>

    <p>"Mm, very well... thank you for your understanding, Secretary Sun."</p>

    <p>After giving his report, Zhuo Yi hung up the phone and heaved a long sigh.</p>

    <p>Next, it was time for him to go all out!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the Headmaster's Office at Number 60 High School, Headmaster Chen and Director Shi stared at the same report, their eyes going over it from top to bottom.</p>

    <p>The report had just been sent over from the office of the General Administration of 100 Schools, and it listed the names of all the students in the city who could apply for aid.</p>

    <p>"The ten student applications which our Number 60 High School submitted were all approved!" Director Xie was pleasantly surprised.</p>

    <p>"It seems that Student Zhuo Yi still has very deep feelings for our Number 60 High School." Headmaster Chen pointed to a name. "Look, of the ten names, there's even one with an asterisk for priority aid."</p>

    <p>Priority?</p>

    <p>Director Shi hadn't noticed it previously, but at the headmaster's words, she looked at the list again and then saw a very small asterisk next to one of the students' names. "...Wang Ling?"</p>

    <p>She read the name aloud, then both of them nodded as they remembered this student.</p>

    <p>His overall performance in the spirit sword exchange meet had been fairly ordinary, but the peach wood spirit sword which he had used had sparked a group discussion.</p>

    <p>After the spirit sword exchange meet, this student's class teacher, Teacher Pan, had been looking for an opportunity to apply for aid on his behalf.</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen smiled slightly. "It seems that Teacher Pan's wish has been granted. This will truly be of immense help to this Student Wang Ling!"</p>

    <p>"A priority aid beneficiary can apply for quite a number of provisions. I wonder what sort of supplies Student Wang Ling has requested. As long as it's reasonable, it should be within the range of the aid program," said Director Shi.</p>

    <p>"With regard to this, Teacher Pan has already asked Student Wang Ling about what he needs. Apart from the basic special aid package, he also asked for something else..."</p>

    <p>After Teacher Pan had received the news that the aid application had been approved, she had already asked Wang Ling early on about his aid requests, and the list of special requirements had been set to the Headmaster's Office.</p>

    <p>In the basic special aid package, apart from basic provisions such as the exercise pack for "Three Years of College Exams and Five Years of Simulations"<sup>2</sup> ... both Headmaster Chen and Director Shi ended up staring at the requested fifty boxes of crispy noodle snacks at the bottom of the list, lost in deep thought...</p>
