  <h1>Chapter 873 The Disaster an Enlightened Bacterium Brings</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Lord Ma realized that this author had been a bit nuts recently — it hadn't been easy for Lord Ma to make an appearance, but in the end, if his storyline wasn't about shit, then it was about poisonous shit... As a toilet with deep integrity, even if Lord Ma had a lot of complicated feelings when it came to butts, he felt deeply that his life shouldn't be like this!</p>

    <p>At that moment, Miss Yu darted a complicated look at the newly dropped heap, which made her very uneasy. "Lord Ma, do you have a way to get rid of this thing? It feels wrong..."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean, Miss Yu?" Lord Ma gazed at this new lump; apart from the fact that it was a bit dark and thick, its shape wasn't any different from the older stuff. After all, in his space, everything came in all shapes and sizes — hard ones, long ones, watery ones...</p>

    <p>"Actually, what's wrong isn't this thing itself, but what's inside it! You need a certain power of sight to see it!" Saying this, Miss Yu's golden eyes gave off a brilliant light. "I'm sure something isn't right inside it."</p>

    <p>"Really?"</p>

    <p>Lord Ma also used his power of sight as his eyes glowed with a dark brown light.</p>

    <p>His eyes were different from Miss Yu's Cosmic Eye, which was a power unique to the Cosmic God Tree. Although the name sounded very majestic, it was actually closely related to the power of nature and probably didn't rank very high.</p>

    <p>Lord Ma on the other hand had the Eye of No Beginning. Hm... it was actually a homonym of some word <sup>1</sup> , and Lord Ma had determinedly changed it to sound more lofty.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>("Beginning" and "shit" share the same Chinese homonym..)</dfn>

    <p>Lord Ma's eyes had the ability to purify.</p>

    <p>After Miss Yu mentioned that something wasn't right with this new lump, Lord Ma scanned it with his eyes.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, he realized that there were strange-looking things inside the lump that were red and long, wriggling around like worms.</p>

    <p>"This is..."</p>

    <p>"It should be bacteria."</p>

    <p>"It can't be... How can bacteria be so big?" Lord Ma was alarmed.</p>

    <p>"Lord Ma's space will naturally contain bacteria, but these ones are obviously abnormal! They have to be purified as soon as possible! Lord Ma!" Miss Yu realized how serious the problem was. "This bunch of bacteria is eating my food!"</p>

    <p>Dazed, Lord Ma immediately activated his Eye of No Beginning.</p>

    <p>When the dark brown light shone on the bacteria, they curled in on themselves in pain. Some were killed, but Lord Ma realized that his purifying ability wasn't strong enough to solve the problem. This was because the bacteria were absorbing the nutrients from the other excrement in Lord Ma's space and reproducing swiftly!</p>

    <p>His purifying ability actually couldn't keep up with this reproduction rate.</p>

    <p>Most importantly, Lord Ma noticed that they seemed to be gradually growing larger in size.</p>

    <p>This already wasn't bacteria...</p>

    <p>Lord Ma refused to believe it.</p>

    <p>Mere bacteria could actually grow to be as large as crab sticks.</p>

    <p>And as they continued to take in nutrients, they didn't stop growing.</p>

    <p>Lord Ma began to panic as he broke into a cold sweat. "Miss... Miss Yu... what should we do?"</p>

    <p>This was out of his expectations — he never expected something so dangerous to actually drop into his space.</p>

    <p>However, he was very clear on the origins of this dangerous bacteria...</p>

    <p>All this started with the single bacterium which his little master had enchanted in passing.</p>

    <p>But it was likely that even Little Master Ling himself never expected that enchanted bacterium to reproduce rapidly in Li Diao's body, or for Li Diao to actually discharge part of the bacteria...</p>

    <p>Miss Yu furrowed her brow. "We must move them to another space! Destroy them completely! They're too dangerous."</p>

    <p>Miss Yu stretched out a branch as she joined the "firefighting" operation.</p>

    <p>Lord Ma: "Miss Yu, do you have any ideas?"</p>

    <p>Miss Yu: "I'll use the power of space to transfer these things to outer space. In a cosmic environment, they'll freeze quickly, and we'll be able to kill them completely!"</p>

    <p>Lord Ma drew in a nervous breath, feeling a little stressed. There was no doubt that Miss Yu was stronger than he was; she also had her own unique technique for handling the power of space.</p>

    <p>But the question was whether things would go smoothly.</p>

    <p>This was an enchanted super super super bacterium...</p>

    <p>And Lord Ma realized that among all the gremlins that Little Master Ling had enchanted, this was the only one which could reproduce and upgrade itself — Lord Ma found this truly astonishing!</p>

    <p>At that moment, Miss Yu opened a new space. Using her branch as a bridge, she let the bacteria climb her body and along the branch to the other end in the cosmic space.</p>

    <p>"Miss Yu, you..."</p>

    <p>"It's fine. I can cut off the branch infected by the bacteria anytime, and it won't hurt." Miss Yu's expression was very solemn.</p>

    <p>Lord Ma was touched by her spirit.</p>

    <p>This was like the legend of Buddha slicing off a piece of his flesh to feed the eagle; Miss Yu was actually sacrificing part of her body as the price to get rid of the scary bacteria. What kind of utterly fearless spirit was this?</p>

    <p>Lord Ma actually felt his eyes tear up a little.</p>

    <p>He felt that he might have somewhat misunderstood this unreasonable girl or had been biased against her.</p>

    <p>She had gone deep into his inner space, but it wasn't just to eat for free — indeed, she was helping him out a lot!</p>

    <p>These long and red maggot-like bacteria crawled along the Cosmic God Tree's extended branch. Miss Yu waited patiently, and after taking the time to confirm that all the bacteria had crawled across her body, she sent them into outer space and cut off the entire branch!</p>

    <p>After the bacteria were sent into the universe, they both sighed with relief.</p>

    <p>Lord Ma was exultant. "Thank you, Miss Yu!"</p>

    <p>"You're welcome!"</p>

    <p>She clapped her hands. "If they had remained here, they'd spoil the rest of the food easily and ruin my dining experience."</p>

    <p>Lord Ma: "..."</p>

    <p>After saying that, Miss Yu waved her hand to open a mirror into space.</p>

    <p>She was going to examine whether those abnormal bacteria had already frozen or not.</p>

    <p>But what happened then was completely out of her expectations.</p>

    <p>The abnormal bacteria, which should have been frozen solid, had actually broken free of the ice, and the largest bacterium had already grown to the size of an infant — it had even grown limbs!</p>

    <p>Miss Yu was pale with fright. "They — they actually devoured the nutrients in my branch! This damn E. coli!"</p>

    <p>In space, the largest abnormal bacterium sneered cruelly. "Thanks for your help. I am the king of all bacteria kings — you can also call me Lord Fungus!"</p>

    <p>Lord Ma and Miss Yu never expected this Lord Fungus to not only grow limbs, but also develop spiritual intelligence and even steal their spatial abilities.</p>

    <p>With those words, Lord Fungus directly opened up a space hole to escape, and disappeared.</p>

    <p>Although it was an enlightened bacterium, it couldn't remain outside a body for long, and needed to find a suitable host...</p>
