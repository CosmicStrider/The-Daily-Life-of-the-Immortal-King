  <h1>Chapter 848 Dao Song Foreign Language High School</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was August 16th on Wednesday.</p>

    <p>It was the third day of the summer break.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High was already in summer vacation mode, except for the elite students... After careful consideration by Headmaster Chen and Director Shi, they decided to have the students from the elite classes step in for the 2v2 battle test interview.</p>

    <p>In fact, this was a rare exchange opportunity, since most of the transfer candidates this time were from famous schools, like the Remnant Elder Senior High School students who were the third scions from two of the four big families, Li Mingyao and Zhou Youzheng.</p>

    <p>Being from a renowned school and established family backgrounds, there was no need to doubt their strength among their peers.</p>

    <p>When all was said and done, this looked on the surface like a battle test interview to assess new transfer students, but it was actually also a test of Number 60 High's elite students...</p>

    <p>This was why Wang Ling wanted to join the regular class in the beginning.</p>

    <p>The elite class was a lot of hassle...</p>

    <p>During the draw event on that day, Chen Chao was actually a little moody. Old Pan had stressed repeatedly in the class chat that all elite students had to attend, but Chen Chao didn't dare vent his grievances. Thus, he simply changed the name of their small WeChat group from "Ocean of Salted Fish" to "Salted Fish Elites Are Never On Break" to make clear his dissatisfaction.</p>

    <p>To this, Guo Hao only had one word: Coward!</p>

    <p>Some of them had arrived at class early. Although Old Pan had fixed the time at eight, it had only been a few days since the start of the summer break, and most of them had yet to adjust their internal clocks. For example, Chen Chao and Guo Hao had already been up at six. With nothing to do, they flipped through a few apps, only to discover that the web authors they followed had gone out to collect reference materials, the uploaders they followed hadn't updated, and the cartoonists they followed had broken their hands... Bored stiff, they could only wash up a bit and go to school.</p>

    <p>So when Wang Ling arrived at the classroom, there were already quite a number of people there.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao was bickering with Chen Chao about changing the name of the group chat.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "Super! If you're unhappy, just let it out!"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "Let it out? Why don't you do it? You and Wang Ling are the only people in class who can make me do it!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling could see that everyone was in low spirits.</p>

    <p>Although the interview looked like it was a test of the transfer students, the elite students felt pressure no less than, or even more than what they felt during the final exams.</p>

    <p>They were representing the school.</p>

    <p>If they brought shame on the school during this battle, then what?</p>

    <p>While the rule in previous years was that the current class arrangements weren't affected, no matter which class transfer students were ultimately placed in, everyone in class was still very keyed up.</p>

    <p>In a situation like this, what the class didn't need was further stimulation.</p>

    <p>And that was Wang Ling's goal for coming.</p>

    <p>He wouldn't let anyone else join Grade One, Class Three.</p>

    <p>The reason was very simple: otherwise, it'd become harder and harder to keep his marks down!</p>

    <p>So no matter what type of opponents the people in class would face later, Wang Ling had made up his mind to observe secretly and help out his classmates.</p>

    <p>Everyone had come early. This should have been the most idle period for Grade One with the final exams just over... It was while waiting nervously for the results of the final exams that the students turned into spectators, and coupled with their resentment this morning, many of them went on the school's Tieba to start collecting information on the students who wanted to transfer to Number 60 High.</p>

    <p>In the end, it would have been better if they hadn't done the search!</p>

    <p>A student from Dao Song Foreign Language High School had shared on his school's Tieba a photo of his transfer application for Number 60 High, which had been officially acknowledged. "Hehehe, I heard that Number 60 High have asked their own students to conduct the battle interview this time. What do you think their chances of winning are?"</p>

    <p>"Poster, what class are you in? You want to transfer schools?"</p>

    <p>"Is this shit school worth transferring to? Our Dao Song is number one!"</p>

    <p>The number of hits for this post initially wasn't high, but after the Number 60 High students dug it out with a keyword search for information on Number 60 High transfers, this topic instantly exploded on Tieba.</p>

    <p>"Dao Song Foreign Language High School? Fuck! Too arrogant!" A lot of the Number 60 regular class students had noticed this post. They took a screenshot of the original post, then posted it on Number 60 High's Tieba along with a link.</p>

    <p>Plenty of Number 60 High students burned with fury in the early morning at the arrogant words. This included the remedial and regular class students, who were naturally very unhappy at seeing their school insulted online.</p>

    <p>Plus, the other party had never shown any real intention to transfer at all, and was simply stirring up trouble!</p>

    <p>"Dao Song Foreign Language Cultivation High School? What school is this?" Just skimming the post was enough to make Chen Chao smack the table and stand up. "Damn it! Let me fight him!"</p>

    <p>"This is a cultivation high school built by a luxury goods foreign company. It's called DG for short in English, and has its own brand in Lixiu Nation. It mainly deals in high-end, customized, cultivation luxury goods. But this school isn't in our Peiyuan district; it's in Liyuan district, and is the top school there."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao narrowed his eyes. "I sent that screenshot earlier to one of my uncles who's in the education field. He told me that the students in this cultivation high school all wear and use this foreign company's brand; their uniforms and spirit swords are all custom-made. It's also very easy to get into this school - just spend money. You only need to buy one luxury goods set to get in. Furthermore, the school guarantees that their students, even those who aren't very talented, will at the very least reach the late peak Foundation Establishment stage before they graduate."</p>

    <p>After Guo Hao said this, everyone already understood - bluntly speaking, this was a school for the rich. Furthermore, to be able to give such a guarantee, it was obvious that the school had their own reasons for being so confident.</p>

    <p>In an era of modern cultivation, as long as people were rich enough, they could throw money around and smash their way up to the Foundation Establishment and Golden Core stages!</p>

    <p>That was the real difference between a rich player and a poor player.</p>

    <p>"What's so great about having money?! So arrogant! Student Sun Rong's family is also very well-off! The difference between them is clear!" Su Xiao, who was normally a good-natured person, was also a little angry.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was also furious. "It's clear that this is a spoiled rich second generation. He's relying on his family's money and power to upgrade his strength, and now he's putting on airs."</p>

    <p>At that moment, Guo Hao suddenly said, "This person commented again."</p>

    <p>He shared the link in the class group.</p>

    <p>When they opened the link for a look, that student had actually posted a series of replies under the original post.</p>

    <p>"Hahahaha! That bunch of trash from Number 60 High are hurt? So, can I be considered a hot topic now?</p>

    <p>"I don't want to transfer schools at all! But this is a good chance to teach the Number 60 High students a lesson. I'll teach you to be men!</p>

    <p>"Oh, that's right, I'll use my strength to show everyone what kind of country can have such a trash school! Wait and see!"</p>

    <p>"Fuck I can't stand this guy! I want to beat him up!"</p>

    <p>Seeing these replies, practically everyone in Grade One, Class Three stood up.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling himself quietly took a screenshot of this student's remarks and sent it directly to Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>Under the image, he typed just two words.</p>

    <p><em>â€” Fix him!</em></p>

    <p>Hm...</p>

    <p>This DG High student had yet to realize how serious his situation was...</p>
