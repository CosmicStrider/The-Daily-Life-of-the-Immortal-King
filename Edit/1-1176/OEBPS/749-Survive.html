  <h1>Chapter 749 Survive</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ming wasn't a fool. Since this was an escape collaboration, Ghost Head Blade had to do his part, otherwise Wang Ming would be the one to suffer a loss.</p>

    <p>In the current situation, although Ghost Head Blade claimed that this was a last ditch attempt, Wang Ming believed that Ghost Head Blade wanted to survive more than he let on. Ghost Head Blade was desperate to get out of here, yet that didn't mean Wang Ming could use this to threaten him.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming remembered Ghost Head Blade saying before that he had to find a host within a few days when he was in his blade form, otherwise his soul would be cursed by the ancient artifact spirit and he would be directly exterminated.</p>

    <p>That was to say, Wang Ming had two days at most to figure out a way to get out of here, or given Ghost Head Blade's personality, he would definitely drag Wang Ming down to be buried with him.</p>

    <p>From the moment the two of them had started drifting on this bamboo raft, the embodiment of the Heavenly Materials sword, the game had already started... Wang Ming was aware that if he wanted to survive, it was a race against time.</p>

    <p>Time flowed at a different pace in the outside world, plus he wasn't sure if Wang Ling could find him. Although he had specifically told Wang Ling before to keep a low profile as much as possible during this summer camp so as not to arouse the suspicions of the many teachers who were around this time... All along, Wang Ming had half-expected Wang Ling to show up.</p>

    <p>But in the end, it was just an expectation...</p>

    <p>If possible, Wang Ming still wanted to use his own strength to fight his way out of this crisis this time: if you wanted something done well, you had to do it yourself!</p>

    <p>He had to live...</p>

    <p>He had too much unfinished business.</p>

    <p>If he was dead, who would listen to Old Qi's nagging? He had promised Old Qi before that one day, he would become his most outstanding disciple, to surpass him and live up to his reputation as Wisdom Saint.</p>

    <p>If he was dead, what would happen to the Head of State 001 research? This was his greatest masterpiece to date.</p>

    <p>If he was dead, who would eat Zhai Yin's awful fried dragon pork chops?</p>

    <p>If he was dead, what would happen to the primordial qi research? Who would save his little brother...</p>

    <p>For a moment, Wang Ming's thoughts flew through his head.</p>

    <p>Normally, he always felt that he was like a flower in a greenhouse. He was always tightly protected by other people.</p>

    <p>He never imagined that he would find himself in such dire straits one day.</p>

    <p>If it wasn't for this incident, Wang Ming didn't think he would normally consider these issues at all.</p>

    <p>He, Wang Ming...</p>

    <p>Had to do everything possible to break out of here and live!</p>

    <p>Wang Ming pondered deeply.</p>

    <p>The expression in his eyes for some reason gave Ghost Head Blade peace of mind. This was a gamble: he had chosen not to kill Wang Ming, but to pin all his hopes for survival on Wang Ming alone.</p>

    <p>As for his promise that he wouldn't do anything to Wang Ming and that they would get out of here together...</p>

    <p>Promise?</p>

    <p>How much was that worth?</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade had already decided, as long as Wang Ming could figure out a way to get out of here, he would use his last bit of strength to seize Wang Ming's body.</p>

    <p>He already didn't have much time left...</p>

    <p>In less than four days, his soul would be cursed and he would be directly annihilated.</p>

    <p>He had to live. To live was everything.</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade knew that there was no turning back now at this point.</p>

    <p>For many years he had acted as the blade in someone else's hand, accepted a variety of assignments, and even staked everything on an exchange with an ancient artifact spirit.</p>

    <p>Constantly changing his host body was in some sense a type of immortality.</p>

    <p>But what Ghost Head Blade wanted to do was simply bring his sect to greater heights of development.</p>

    <p>Ghost Ax Sect was recognized in the circle as the top killer sect which was established by Numinous Mother. And he was the sect's third disciple, ranked after Gorgeous Itinerant and Daoist Taotie.</p>

    <p>In Ghost Ax Sect, the strong were revered. Ghost Head Blade's lifelong dream was to complete the assignment from his sect, which was to kill ten thousand people, and then he could inherit the true legacy of the sect!</p>

    <p>So Ghost Head Blade felt that he couldn't die here...</p>

    <p>"Brat... I advise you to figure out something in the next twelve hours, or you die," Ghost Head Blade threatened Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>"I don't need you to tell me that."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming replied unenthusiastically, "I should be able to figure out a way, but you know... The brain needs brain cells to function, and for now, my head hurts when I'm thinking. Do you have anything to eat? Two walnuts for boosting the brain would be good!"</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade's voice turned cold. "What trick are you playing?"</p>

    <p>"Trick? How dare I?" Wang Ming waved his hand with a weak expression. "You know, I'm just an ordinary person. I can't go a day without food."</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade was instantly speechless.</p>

    <p>Because it was true.</p>

    <p>He had overlooked this point just now, and had forgotten that Wang Ming was an ordinary person...</p>

    <p>What a troublesome brat!</p>

    <p>"Here!" Ghost Head Blade had no choice but to give him his own tonic.</p>

    <p>It was a red oval pill about the size of a Mylikes chocolate.</p>

    <p>"This is a qi-replenishing pill..." Ghost Head Blade said.</p>

    <p>This was a grade four pill, and was incredibly expensive. When an ordinary person ate one, not only could it heal any body injuries, it could boost vitality and act as a fasting pill.</p>

    <p>This was the only pill that Ghost Head Blade carried on him, which was originally for his host's use. If his host body was injured, one pill was normally enough to fix some of the damage... But now that he didn't have a body, Ghost Head Blade naturally couldn't enjoy its effects. In the current situation, a mutually profitable cooperation was more important.</p>

    <p>He wanted Wang Ming to think of a way to get them out of here first.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ming's physical recovery would also benefit Ghost Head Blade when he forcefully seized his body later. In any case, after he had successfully stolen Wang Ming's body, this pill would have been used to help his host - it would have just been a matter of time.</p>

    <p>"Thanks!" Wang Ming wasn't polite and directly swallowed the pill. In this situation, since Ghost Head Blade wanted him to find a way out, the pill he had taken out definitely had to be a regular, good pill, and he wouldn't give Wang Ming poison.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, after taking the qi-replenishing pill, its effects were immediately apparent, as Wang Ming's head instantly felt lighter.</p>

    <p>At least fifty percent of his body had recovered with this pill...</p>

    <p>But Wang Ming didn't directly reveal this on his face, and he frowned instead. "Your pill... isn't very effective!"</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade sneered. "Brat, that was the last pill I had, it's enough to keep you full for a few days. You don't have any more excuses now, do you? Hurry up and think of something! I've already given you the pill. As for how effective it is, it's got nothing to do with me."</p>

    <p>In fact, Ghost Head Blade truly couldn't guarantee the pill's efficacy. If a cultivator digested this type of high-quality pill, it required help from spirit energy for quicker absorption. For an ordinary person, it might take a long time for the pill to be completely digested...</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade didn't know enough about pills, since all that Ghost Ax Sect taught was killer techniques.</p>

    <p>Half an hour after the pill entered his stomach, Wang Ming had already fully digested it.</p>

    <p>A cultivator used spirit energy to accelerate absorption, while Wang Ming used meditation... Meditation could produce the same effect, but was only possible if you had a powerful brain.</p>

    <p>If Wang Ming wanted to, he could even use meditation to levitate slightly off the ground... But only for very short intervals.</p>

    <p>On the bamboo raft, Ghost Head Blade was feeling a little impatient. "Brat, how's it coming along?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming folded his arms. "Don't worry, I'm getting there..."</p>

    <p>In fact, when Wang Ming had first surveyed the Dead Sea of Space, he already had an idea.</p>
