  <h1>Chapter 909 The World Created By God</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The character Wang Ling created was quite unique.</p>

    <p>Everyone looked at the data for Group Favorite Wang's character.</p>

    <p><em>Character name: Qin Zong</em></p>

    <p><em>Gender: Male</em></p>

    <p><em>Intelligence growth factor: 2/10</em></p>

    <p><em>Endurance growth factor: 2/10</em></p>

    <p><em>Defense growth factor: 2/10</em></p>

    <p><em>Strength growth factor: 2/10</em></p>

    <p><em>Physique growth factor: 2/10</em></p>

    <p><em>Appearance growth factor: 2/10</em></p>

    <p><em>Good value: 5/10</em></p>

    <p><em>Evil value: 5/10</em></p>

    <p><em>Luck value: 10/10</em></p>

    <p><em>Personality: Both good and bad, Zen, carefree, vivacious</em></p>

    <p>"Master designed an ordinary person! But his luck is off the charts!" Xiao Yin thought this was very interesting. When it ran the simulation, Book of Sage Immortal would automatically classify a character with a growth factor under 3 as an ordinary person.</p>

    <p>These character attributes weren't set in stone and could be added to at any time. You could even choose not to set the intelligence growth factor; thus, when the character appeared in the world, it would be as a handicapped person.</p>

    <p>Everyone created their own characters.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming had always longed to walk the cultivation path and envied Wang Ling for this, so he created a cultivator character for himself and maxed out all its attributes.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei set himself up as a mighty botanist who would successfully develop pea shooters to fight the zombies in the future zombie apocalypse.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>While everyone was in the midst of preparations, Zhuo Yi suddenly thought of something. "Will these characters we've created develop their own consciousness in this game world we're setting up?"</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Ming said, "Relatively speaking, they're just a bunch of data for us. However, given the high degree of autonomy in this sandbox game, these game characters living in it could have their own consciousness. We control them on the surface, but they also strive to grow within their pre-set lives in this world."</p>

    <p>"Sounds a bit complicated." Zhuo Yi frowned.</p>

    <p>"Let me put it simply." Wang Ming said, "Just like how we might be called gods when we create these game characters, have you ever thought that there might be a god who created us? A pair of eyes might be watching us even now as we speak..."</p>

    <p>Everyone in the room abruptly couldn't help shuddering.</p>

    <p>"Shit! You scared me!" Er Ha felt all its fur stand on end.</p>

    <p>"My fault, I shouldn't have brought up such a scary topic." Zhuo Yi wiped the sweat on his forehead.</p>

    <p>Actually, scientific research on this had existed earlier on, but broaching this topic again now was still terrifying.</p>

    <p>But the atmosphere in the room turned lively with this discussion.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling gazed out the window in a slightly absent-minded way.</p>

    <p>"A world created by a god..." Wang Ling murmured.</p>

    <p>Although his voice was very soft, Xiao Yin and Fang Xing heard him clearly.</p>

    <p>They had long realized that it wasn't that Wang Ling didn't speak, but that there were times when he didn't want to, and just liked to stare at the screen... this was a mensao master.</p>

    <p>But no one knew that in that moment that Wang Ling was being absent-minded, something frightening was happening.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was Sunday August 29th, the sixteenth day of the summer vacation.</p>

    <p>A brand new game called "Cultivation Emulator" entered the lives of the students on summer break.</p>

    <p>The highly autonomous playstyle and the feeling of being the god who pulled the strings behind the scenes attracted scores of beta players: one minute after the game's release, ten thousand gift cards for permanent beta accounts were all snatched up, the frenzy double that of the 11/11 flash sales<sup>1</sup>.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(An annual online sale event in China held on November 11th.)</dfn>

    <p>Daoist Guang advertised it extensively in his live stream room.</p>

    <p>After some circulation and promotion on the live stream platform, Daoist Guang had now become the number one live streamer on the number one live stream platform, setting a new record with an all-time high of an average of thirty million online users per minute.</p>

    <p>"Many thanks to Brother Guang for promoting the game this time!" In the group, Lord Diulei sent a grinning emoji and expressed his thanks to Daoist Guang.</p>

    <p>"It was nothing, Brother Thunder, it was no effort at all. But this game is really interesting. When I played it for a bit in the live stream room just now, the number of subscribers had already broken a million. And this is just the data for one platform. Looking at all the gaming platforms put together, it won't be hard at all to break ten million in the next few days." Daoist Guang laughed. "Just nice, PUBG's popularity dropped recently, and I was looking for another game to play. With the release of Cultivation Emulator, it might become the craze."</p>

    <p>There were a lot of reasons for a game to become a hit, and Cultivation Emulator trumped in terms of creativity.</p>

    <p>Of course, there was another important reason, which was that it just happened to be the summer break and the students had nothing to do at home.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao was extremely excited in the small class group.</p>

    <p>He and Guo Hao were fanatic gamers to begin with.</p>

    <p>There weren't any previews for Cultivation Emulator, but videos of Daoist Guang's trial run had been recorded and uploaded by Light Chasers to major video websites, which was just as good publicity as a game trailer PV.</p>

    <p>"This game's pretty good!" Chen Chao sent several excited emojis in the group. "I was so bored I actually started playing DNF again... In the end, after my weapon upgrade failed, I lost the mood to play!"</p>

    <p>"Weapon upgrade... How much did you spend?" Guo Hao couldn't help asking.</p>

    <p>"I spent more than ten thousand in one week! I used up one tenth of my New Year money!"</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling's lips thinned involuntarily when he saw this.</p>

    <p>Why was his classmate so rich?</p>

    <p>Saying that, Chen Chao sighed. "But I have a feeling that this Cultivation Emulator will definitely be a hit!"</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling saw Chen Chao's message on his screen, he instantly knew the game was set... .</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "But how annoying! They have so little beta accounts! I tried snapping one up earlier, but they were all gone before the website finished loading! Guo Hao, do you have an uncle who works in a game company? Think of a way to get us two accounts!"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "You bet, I really do!"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "But the game creator isn't a company; it's an independent creator with the ID Mr Wang. My uncle already used his connections to question some of the game company bosses, but they all said that they didn't know this creator. The only way now is to buy the beta accounts at a high price, but I heard that the price is already over ten thousand - plus, it's just going to get higher and higher."</p>

    <p>"Mr Wang?" Chen Chao was delighted. "Maybe it was Wang Ling or a relative of his who made this game?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "Wang Ling, I know you're looking at the screen. Aren't you going to say something?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
