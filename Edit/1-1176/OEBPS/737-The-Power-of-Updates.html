  <h1>Chapter 737 The Power of Updates</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This blade was as fast as light and shadow as it aimed suddenly for Wang Ming's thigh.</p>

    <p>This was very clearly a planned attack, not to take Wang Ming's life, but simply to incapacitate him and steal him away.</p>

    <p>At the moment, Wang Ming was waiting for Wu Zhenjun's signal. He thought that all the Night Chief members as well as the hired Dark Network forces had been caught, and never expected that there would still be one who had escaped the net and would come for him.</p>

    <p>This Ghost Head Blade came prepared, out of nowhere!</p>

    <p>But the head of state's reaction was just as swift. The moment the blade of light split the military tent and flashed its way inside, even with its killing intent completely concealed, the invisible head of state acted right away!</p>

    <p><em>Pa!</em></p>

    <p>With his bare hand... he actually swatted this naked blade directly to pieces.</p>

    <p>"Aimed at me?"</p>

    <p>It was only at that moment that Wang Ming realized he had suddenly been attacked, and he looked hugely astonished.</p>

    <p>This person had actually been able to escape the assault from Wu Zhenjun's sound wave magic ball; not only had they escaped Irascible Dharmaraja's raw vocal unscathed, they had also launched a precise surprise attack on Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>It seemed this wasn't just any ordinary person...</p>

    <p>Wang Ming immediately gave the head of state disguised as Number 001 an order. "Number 001! Catch him alive!"</p>

    <p>It was only after Wang Ming issued this command that the astonished Ghost Head Blade, whose surprise attack had failed, realized that there was actually a hidden expert inside the military tent.</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade knew she had been careless, and was fully aware that this hidden expert was incredibly powerful - before mounting her sneak attack, she had specifically scouted out the situation inside the military tent!</p>

    <p>The problem was, she had only sensed one person, Wang Ming!</p>

    <p>A lead teacher actually had a personal bodyguard specially assigned to him?</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade, who had originally been uninterested in Wang Ming, was now instantly and intensely curious.</p>

    <p>A hundred meters away outside Wang Ming's tent, Ghost Head Blade was hiding in a leafy tree.</p>

    <p>She was carrying a lacy little goth umbrella.</p>

    <p>After finding out that there was another expert in the military tent, she immediately pulled the umbrella handle and a blade slid out. Using it to cut her wrist, she smeared the blood which oozed out onto her left eyelid to act as a medium.</p>

    <p>"Shura Eye!"</p>

    <p>When Ghost Head Blade opened her eyes again, her left eye changed as the pupil instantly turned red, the blood causing a magic array to form inside it.</p>

    <p>The Shura Eye was the legendary skill which had made Ghost Head Blade famous.</p>

    <p>This wasn't some fantastic eye spell, but involved digging out the eye of a particular devil beast and transplanting it into your own left eye and refining it.</p>

    <p>After successful refinement, the transplanted devil beast eye would be fused with the human body. It would look normal most of the time, but as soon as it was affected by blood, it would promptly transform.</p>

    <p>Faced with the mysterious hidden expert in the military tent, Ghost Head Blade's own battle experience was telling her that it was necessary to use this technique.</p>

    <p>But unexpectedly, Ghost Head Blade found that even after activating the Shura Eye, she could only see the other party's extremely hazy figure... she couldn't clearly see who it was at all!</p>

    <p>She could only discern an outline, a glance...</p>

    <p>And the scariest thing was that the other side directly locked gazes with her, eyes completely and obviously fixed on her... This was the typical alert, eagle-eyed standoff!</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade broke out in a cold sweat!</p>

    <p>Who the hell was this guy?</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade was so scared that all her pores abruptly contracted. One glance was enough to frighten her out of her wits.</p>

    <p>And in the next moment, this person suddenly moved...</p>

    <p>Going on a counterattack at a speed that Ghost Head Blade couldn't follow with the naked eye.</p>

    <p>Tremendous pressure suddenly flooded Ghost Head Blade's soul. She felt like her body had been strung up against a tree trunk with a thousand-jin weight on the other end, unable to move a single inch.</p>

    <p>By the time Ghost Head Blade came back to her senses, a large and sturdy hand was already pressing down on her shoulder.</p>

    <p>"A True Immortal expert..."</p>

    <p>Instantly, Ghost Head Blade felt despair.</p>

    <p>Although she didn't know exactly what True Immortal level the other party was at, the enemy was actually a True Immortal... This was far beyond what Ghost Head Blade had expected.</p>

    <p>Who on earth was this Wang Ming?</p>

    <p>There was actually a True Immortal expert following him around, protecting him at all times... this person wasn't the illegitimate son of Huaxiu's head of state, was he?</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade was drenched in cold sweat.</p>

    <p>Now that she knew that her opponent was a True Immortal expert, Ghost Head Blade knew there was no way for her to fight back; however, escaping was something she was good at.</p>

    <p>After recognizing the reality of her situation, her first response was to throw off the head of state's grip. But she was held in place as the aura of a True Immortal pressed down on her shoulder, making it increasingly heavy.</p>

    <p>It was so crushing that Ghost Head Blade almost couldn't breathe. For the head of state to be so vicious even when she was a girl was vastly unlike his image.</p>

    <p>"This arm, you can have it!" Gritting her teeth, she pulled hard, and her entire right arm, including her right shoulder, was ripped off like beef jerky!</p>

    <p>She then dragged her broken body along as she turned into a stream of light that swiftly fled.</p>

    <p>The head of state knitted his eyebrows as he held Ghost Head Blade's arm.</p>

    <p>Although the other party was a woman, he didn't expect her to be so savage.</p>

    <p>He knew a "Gecko Technique" which allowed a person to imitate a gecko and abandon a part of their body to escape as necessary, and the part that had been given up would grow back later.</p>

    <p>It was a life-saving trick, and while many cultivators had learned this technique, few could use it proficiently.</p>

    <p>The main point... was that this Ghost Head Blade hadn't used the Gecko Technique or whatnot - instead, she had abandoned her arm by directly snapping it off!</p>

    <p>"What a fierce person."</p>

    <p>Dropping the broken limb, the head of state sighed.</p>

    <p>The next moment, he directly stretched out one hand in the direction Ghost Head Blade had fled and curled his fingers. "Buddha Palm Mark <sup>1</sup> ..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(From "Journey to the West,"
when Monkey King tried to
escape Buddha's hand, but
Buddha turned his palm over
and his five fingers
transformed into a mountain
to imprison Monkey King ..)</dfn>

    <p>A moment later, the head of state caught a fleeing stream of light, and Ghost Head Blade, who had been magically forced to shrink in size, appeared with a petrified face in the head of state's palm.</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade knew she had run into a tough opponent today...</p>

    <p>This was an advanced level seven spell, and was the spell which the head of state was most familiar with and which he used the most.</p>

    <p>As for why he had learned this spell, it all started when the head of state began reading Father Wang's novel.</p>

    <p>When Father Wang had just started writing the novel, the very slow chapter updates had prompted the head of state's interest in learning this spell. At the time, the head of state's intention had been to hold Father Wang firmly in his palm and force him to update his novel...</p>

    <p>Therefore, Father Wang was a key motivator for the head of state to learn this spell!</p>

    <p>Staring at Ghost Head Blade in his palm, the head of state wondered if he should demonstrate some other skills, like "Universal Little Black House" or "Wheel of Flying Time and Pressure"...</p>

    <p>Come to think of it, the head of state felt that while waiting for Father Wang to update as well as urging him to update, he had indeed learned quite a number of techniques!</p>

    <p>Even though in the end, he hadn't used any of them...</p>
