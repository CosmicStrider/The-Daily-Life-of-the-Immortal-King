  <h1>Chapter 878 Frightened Devil Gut Fungus Lord</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Devil Gut Fungus Lord retreated.</p>

    <p>He felt that the man in front of him was a little tricky.</p>

    <p>He didn't know very much about the human world, but Devil Gut Fungus Lord thought that given his strength, he could absolutely rank among the top ten fighters in the world at the moment. However, his Super Bacteria Wave barrage just now had been dispelled so easily by this man with long black hair and in traditional attire in front of him - the other party was clearly no less weaker than him, or maybe even stronger...</p>

    <p>Hence, the only thing Devil Gut Fungus Lord could think of right now was to drag out the fight.</p>

    <p>His strength depended on the number of bacteria in his body. The more new bacteria were produced, the stronger he would be, and he would continue to grow over time.</p>

    <p>But whether his plan to drag out the fight would go so smoothly...</p>

    <p>That remained to be seen.</p>

    <p>"How about a short ceasefire?" Devil Gut Fungus Lord stared at Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>In midair, Lord Diulei returned Devil Gut Fungus Lord's gaze fearlessly. "You and I both know very well that this fight can be settled in one minute - maybe not even that. How many more times do you think you can withstand my palm attack?"</p>

    <p>Devil Gut Fungus Lord grit his teeth. Lord Diulei said the words lightly, but they hit him in a sore spot.</p>

    <p>Indeed...</p>

    <p>That move, which contained the golden light of Buddha and which could even make manifest a golden Buddha palm technique, didn't agree with him at all! It could even be described as his natural enemy!</p>

    <p>The force of that palm strike just now was devastating - billions of his bacteria became cannon fodder and were obliterated in an instant.</p>

    <p>If the other party used several palm strikes in succession, he wouldn't be able to hold out for long at all...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At this time, Jin Shi and Yin Shi were already staring in awe from a distance as the Brilliant Victory sword protected them.</p>

    <p>They never knew Lord Diulei could be so powerful. They had heard previously that Senior Immortal was now a True Venerated expert! <em>Shifu </em>told them that this was a rare realm between True Immortal and Venerated Immortal!</p>

    <p>The greatest fortune was required in order to become a True Venerated!</p>

    <p>" <em>Shifu </em>is being controlled by that evil spirit. Can Senior Immortal really save him?" Yin Shi was a little worried, not because she didn't believe in Lord Diulei's ability, but because Lord Diulei was so powerful that he might destroy their master's body... After all, there were often some bizarre news reports nowadays on something like someone trying to save a girl who wanted to jump off a building by killing her first before she could do so...</p>

    <p>If Lord Diulei couldn't control his strength, he would destroy the evil invader along with their <em>shifu's </em> body...</p>

    <p>It was true that this was an evil invader, but the body he had infiltrated was their master's!</p>

    <p>While there were now many ways to reconstruct a body, in the end, the original was still better!</p>

    <p>"He'll be fine. Your <em>shifu </em>will also be saved." As Lord Diulei's sword spirit, Brilliant Victory had utmost faith in its master.</p>

    <p>It had already activated a protective sword shield. Sword qi stretched out from its hilt to form a sword wall like a mountain, firmly protecting Jin Shi and Yin Shi.</p>

    <p>Brilliant Victory's defensive abilities were so strong it could even withstand a nuclear explosion...</p>

    <p>Considering how powerful the Wutian Golden Buddha Palm was, Brilliant Victory felt it necessary to protect the siblings and ensure they were unharmed.</p>

    <p>That was the task Thunder had originally assigned to it.</p>

    <p>As for Li Diao and his son who were still on the island...</p>

    <p>Brilliant Victory sword had initially planned to rescue them in passing.</p>

    <p>But both of them were infected with the bacteria and their bodies stank weirdly all over, which made Brilliant Victory flinch.</p>

    <p>So Brilliant Victory could only leave these two to fend for themselves...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, seeing that Jin Shi and Yin Shi were completely protected by Brilliant Victory, Lord Diulei no longer had any concerns.</p>

    <p>As for Li Diao and his son on the island...</p>

    <p>They had to fend for themselves.</p>

    <p>When the battle was over, Lord Diulei would see if they could still be saved...</p>

    <p>After all, Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch had blacklisted these two, and they were way down the priority list behind Jin Shi and Yin Shi.</p>

    <p>"It's over."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei stared at Devil Gut Fungus Lord.</p>

    <p>"You won't kill me!" Devil Gut Fungus Lord laughed wildly. "This is your friend's body. If you attack me, your friend's body will be the first to suffer..."</p>

    <p>Devil Gut Fungus Lord didn't know very much of the human world, but he knew that the cost of reconstructing a body was more expensive than a house!</p>

    <p>"Is that so?" Lord Diulei smiled gently.</p>

    <p>He made a hand seal again, and the blazing light of Buddha rocketed upward, looking for all the world like a miracle splitting earth and heaven apart! The golden beam of light connecting earth and heaven was like the Monkey King's Golden Cudgel, and was very intimidating! But the huge apparition of a golden Buddha appeared behind Lord Diulei again, and it slowly swung its palm, which seemed to contain innumerable truths of Buddha.</p>

    <p>The golden Buddha pushed the beam of light forward with its palm, aiming it so that it fell directly toward Devil Gut Fungus Lord.</p>

    <p>"Buddha Light Body Freeze..."</p>

    <p>Under this tremendous pressure, Devil Gut Fungus Lord was stunned to find that he actually couldn't move.</p>

    <p>This man...</p>

    <p>Was too vicious!</p>

    <p>He didn't even care about his fellow brother's body?</p>

    <p>Devil Gut Fungus Lord never thought Lord Diulei would attack him so resolutely.</p>

    <p>He was utterly shaken, and at the same time sensed the threat of death approaching.</p>

    <p>This Wutian Golden Buddha Palm had the Buddha Light Body Freeze effect. When the beam fell on him, his soul and body, as well as the soul of the body's owner, would instantly be annihilated.</p>

    <p>If he didn't leave now, it would be too late!</p>

    <p>Devil Gut Fungus Lord gnashed his teeth. "You're really something!"</p>

    <p>The next moment, countless purple and black worms poured out from every pore of Immortal Toya's body. These worms were from Devil Gut Fungus Lord's original body, and were bacteria from the parent body that Devil Gut Fungus Lord had enchanted. He was forced by Lord Diulei to leave this highly compatible body.</p>

    <p>The instant he left the body, Devil Gut Fungus Lord suffered the torture of being exposed to the light of Buddha.</p>

    <p>Goddammit...</p>

    <p>It hurt!</p>

    <p>He felt himself burning up!</p>

    <p>The light of Buddha was so powerful that every inch of his body felt like it was being gnawed on by a powerful, purifying force!</p>

    <p>The next second, Devil Gut Fungus Lord's original body, which had broken away, directly chewed a hole into space, and he manipulated all the worms so that they scuttled into the space together.</p>

    <p>He was worried that if he hung around too long, even the parent body would be immobilized by the light of Buddha, so he had to retreat as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>Seeing that he had succeeded in forcing Devil Gut Fungus Lord out of the body, Lord Diulei hurriedly looked to the sky and yelled, "Brother Ling! I know you're watching! Hurry up and cut off my ultimate move! Don't just watch! If my palm strike falls, Brother To and his island will disappear!"</p>

    <p>As soon as he said that...</p>

    <p>A space fissure suddenly appeared next to Lord Diulei's cheeks.</p>

    <p>A pair of familiar hands came into view.</p>

    <p><em>Pa!</em></p>

    <p>Lord Diulei then felt a ringing pain in his head.</p>

    <p>In the wake of Wang Ling's Great Skull-Flicking Spell, Lord Diulei's ultimate move was successfully interrupted...</p>

    <p>The golden light of Buddha which filled the whole sky was instantly dispelled.</p>
