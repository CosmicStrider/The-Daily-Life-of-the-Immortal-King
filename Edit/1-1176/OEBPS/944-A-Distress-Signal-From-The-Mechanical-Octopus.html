  <h1>Chapter 944 A Distress Signal From The Mechanical Octopus</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The appearance of this hand caught the mechanical octopus off guard.</p>

    <p>The router was crushed, directly cutting off the network connection... Although this wouldn't destroy the data itself, it would severely hinder the mechanical octopus's work and control over Detention Island.</p>

    <p>"How dare you!"</p>

    <p>The mechanical octopus was furious. Its mechanical arms shot out to wrap around Wang Ling's white hand. From their speed alone, Wang Ling could tell that this mechanical octopus's strength was roughly at the Itinerant Immortal level.</p>

    <p>So pathetic...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't show himself, and merely fought the mechanical octopus with one hand through the space fissure.</p>

    <p>He knew that the Mahjong Squad was in a pickle, and that this was the problem Zhuo Yi was currently facing at work, so he decided to make a move.</p>

    <p>As for why he was only using one hand...</p>

    <p>It wasn't because Wang Ling was showing off how strong he was...</p>

    <p>... But because he was holding a crispy noodle snack in his other hand, so he couldn't let go.</p>

    <p>But the alien mechanical octopus viewed this behavior as nothing less than a taunt. Hundreds of mechanical tentacles waved in the air and turned into more shadows than the eye could see.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, however, couldn't be bothered discerning the situation. With that one hand stretched out of the space crack, he firmly grabbed hold of some of the real tentacles.</p>

    <p><em>Boom!</em></p>

    <p>His primordial qi burst in his palm, directly creating a qi explosion. The intense heat generated in that short moment instantly blew the tentacles apart.</p>

    <p>"True Immortal..." The mechanical octopus was amazed.</p>

    <p>He knew what the current realm stages on Earth were. The moment Wang Ling released his primordial qi, the powerful pressure immediately made the mechanical octopus think of the True Immortal realm.</p>

    <p>But the mechanical octopus was inexperienced. It didn't know how strong Wang Ling truly was.</p>

    <p>It also overlooked the fact that Wang Ling was fighting it with just one hand.</p>

    <p>But even with one hand, the odds were in his favor.</p>

    <p>After its tentacles were fried, the mechanical octopus sweated a lot of oil. It had a mechanical body, so it didn't feel pain, but it was fully aware of how troublesome the owner of this hand was.</p>

    <p>But the mechanical octopus was still confident it could fight back. It had a mechanical body, so it wasn't afraid of death at all. Besides, its entire body was made of memory metal, and was capable of healing itself even after severe damage.</p>

    <p>In front of memory metal, the major damage effect was rubbish and completely helpless against it.</p>

    <p>That was the advantage of not being made of flesh and blood!</p>

    <p>The mechanical octopus was very satisfied with its metallic composition.</p>

    <p>Cultivators used up spirit qi. In a war of attrition, the mechanical octopus would drag a cultivator down sooner or later.</p>

    <p>"Super 5G Online Repair Technique!" The mechanical octopus silently grit its teeth and activated this amazing ability.</p>

    <p>The super 5G network was a super powerful network which the Brain King clan had stolen from Huawei, the top network technology supplier in the universe. The technology originated from Earth. It didn't require WIFI and was extremely fast... Back then, Lord Brain King had taken a fancy to the technology at first glance.</p>

    <p>However, its development had encountered many stumbling blocks, mainly because some authorities at the time didn't know its worth and thwarted it in all aspects.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, the Earthling who developed the technology was full of confidence. He didn't feel dread when he was thwarted, but met the obstacles head on.</p>

    <p>The repair spell was based on the Brain King clan's modified version of the super 5G network.</p>

    <p>The moment the spell was cast, the damaged bits that had already been crushed to dust on the ground actually started to gather together themselves.</p>

    <p>The instant it activated this spell, the mechanical octopus had already decided to drag this battle out. This idea was identical to the one President Bai had had before.</p>

    <p>But as it turned out, the mechanical octopus was thinking too much...</p>

    <p>None of Wang Ling's battles lasted more than five minutes.</p>

    <p>Unless he wanted to play...</p>

    <p>To be honest, after his brush with a person of the Divine Dragon clan on Divine Dao Star, this was Wang Ling's second time fighting an alien lifeform.</p>

    <p>He knew what the mechanical octopus was thinking. Wang Ling lifted his hand, and a ball of black light flew out of his palm to form a pitch black cube in the air.</p>

    <p>This was the Space Removal Spell, an offshoot of the Three Thousand Great Dao, which could create an independent space in an instant without any signal interference! - The super 5G network signal disappeared on the spot!</p>

    <p>An independent space?</p>

    <p>The mechanical octopus was utterly stunned.</p>

    <p>When it came to independent spaces, the mechanical octopus had a thorough understanding of them.</p>

    <p>Group Leader Detention Island was an independent space, but even Lord Brain King had spent a lot of energy setting it up at the time... there was no way an independent space could instantly take shape.</p>

    <p>This person's strength was amazing!</p>

    <p>Was he really an Earthling?</p>

    <p>The mechanical octopus inwardly felt that things weren't looking good. The hand's owner was a little strange, and was clearly different from its general understanding of Earth cultivators.</p>

    <p>"Great Thousand-Hand Bodhisattva<sup>1</sup> Spell..." The next moment, a voice which shook the spirit resounded inside the mechanical octopus's mind, and it almost collapsed on the spot.</p>

    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Reminder, 'Bodhisattva' in Buddhism are enlightened beings who have put off entering paradise in order to help others attain enlightenment.)</dfn>

    <p>Great Thousand-Hand Bodhisattva Spell!!!</p>

    <p>The mechanical octopus was alarmed - the other party was capable of even this?</p>

    <p>The mechanical octopus was created by Brain King, and its database contained almost all the information in the universe. It knew that this "Great Thousand-Hand Bodhisattva Spell" was a super magical power among the thirty thousand Heavenly Dao... and a super skill among Heavenly Dao, enough to destroy the whole world!</p>

    <p>However, it was clear that the hand's owner wasn't using all his strength, as he used just his fingers to demonstrate this move. Thousands of fingers created a huge array in the air, just like the Thousand Swords Art sword array <sup>2</sup> , and they fell like a thunderstorm to incessantly pierce the body of the mechanical octopus and its tentacles.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(From "Legend of Sword and Fairy.")</dfn>

    <p><em>Boom...</em></p>

    <p>The continuous bombardment broke the mechanical octopus into pieces. Its tentacles were instantly all blown apart! Even its forehead was hit hard, and it spat out pitch black oil as it was sent flying. It crashed into the wall behind it, and slid down the smooth surface.</p>

    <p>"It's over, it's all over..." The mechanical octopus was in despair.</p>

    <p>It had no idea that Earth had such a variable. Its vision became blurry; it had practically fallen apart after being pierced through by this Great Thousand-Hand Bodhisattva Spell.</p>

    <p>"Lord Brain King... Lord Brain King, help..."</p>

    <p>It sent out a weak distress signal, but it was blocked by the independent space and couldn't be transmitted at all.</p>

    <p>It was all over...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side in his bedroom, Wang Ling withdrew his hand from the crack.</p>

    <p>He had successfully intercepted the mechanical octopus's distress signal.</p>

    <p>Now, if they wanted to draw out this Lord Brain King, they just needed to be thoroughly prepared; once the distress signal was sent out, they just needed to wait for a sure catch.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling took a bite of his crispy noodle snack and sent the distress signal to Zhuo Yi as a text message.</p>

    <p>This was what it looked like after it was translated into Chinese: "I have a book called <em>Rongzhai Six Strokes <sup>3</sup> </em>..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(A code phrase from the
Chinese adventure game "The
Invisible Guardian .. ")</dfn>
