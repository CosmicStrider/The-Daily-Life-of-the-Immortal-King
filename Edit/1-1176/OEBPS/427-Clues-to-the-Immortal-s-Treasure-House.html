  <h1>Chapter 427 Clues to the Immortal's Treasure House </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that there was probably no one in the world who understood the Three Thousand Great Spells more thoroughly than he did. Since birth, memories of the Three Thousand Great Spells had started to assemble themselves together in his mind like a jigsaw puzzle as he started to get older. When he turned five years old, the preliminary domain of the Three Thousand Great Spells had already taken shape and was sixty percent complete.</p>

    <p>By the time he was ten years old, the Three Thousand Great Spells "memory jigsaw" was already complete and was like an inherent and old memory slowly coming back to life with age.</p>

    <p>The Three Thousand Great Spells weren't about technical skills; they were rules about the truth of all things and were called nomological powers in the cultivation world.</p>

    <p>In fact, the way of Tao that Taoist Guang had talked of pursuing and the understanding of the way of Tao that Lord Diulei had spoken about was actually part of the Three Thousand Great Spells. However, even a True Immortal wouldn't be able to grasp a nomological power so easily.</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang couldn't help sighing in his heart as he waved over a hundred tentacles and typed: "If only this old man had been able to master one of the nomological powers of the Three Thousand Great Spells back then - how good would that have been? Then I wouldn't need to rely on some long-winded way of getting through the Samsara Spirit Tribulation... I could have chosen to temper myself!" When he said this, Taoist Guang couldn't help patting his thigh. What a pity - he had been so stupid!</p>

    <p>Even Lord Diulei couldn't help laughing as he typed: "That's why I've always thought that comprehending the way of Tao is by luck and not design. However, it's not too late for you, Senior Taoist Guang. There are so many great seniors in Brother Ling's family... I often gain new inspiration at his place. Now you are in Brother Ling's ring, and you'll be able to come out occasionally once it's fully charged with spirit power. If you spend just five minutes feeling and learning as much as possible, you might experience a breakthrough!"</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang was emotionally moved, as if he had met his soulmate. He wiped at his tears as he typed: "Don't call me senior! From now on, you and I are brothers!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei sent an emoji with a teary smile. "Then what should I call you? Brother Guang? Ah Guang?"</p>

    <p>"Just call me Brother Guang! No need to be polite! I'll call you Brother Thunder!" Taoist Guang replied.</p>

    <p>The corners of Wang Ling's lips couldn't help twitching as he looked at the screen. "..." They were becoming friendly too fast!</p>

    <p>In fact, sometimes Wang Ling really envied Lord Diulei's ability to communicate.</p>

    <p>Although Lord Diulei was known in the circle as "Great Death-Courting Senior," there was no one who didn't know that "Great Death-Courting Senior" was a famous social butterfly in the cultivation circle... without these relationships in the circle, there was no way he would be able to run such a huge cultivation forum, which relied mainly on discussing gossip and ridiculing scandals to remain open all year round.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "When Brother Ling burns something for you next time, I'll have him burn you some broccoli, Brother Guang! This broccoli was grown by Great Senior Wang! I gaze at it everyday for ten minutes, and I feel that I gain a lot from it! You might find it helpful for comprehending the way of Tao!"</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang: "Is that right? Then I'll have to trouble Brother Thunder to burn it for me so that I can examine it!"</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling saw this, he couldn't help sending an ellipsis: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei realized that he had gotten a little off-track, so he quickly came back to the subject at hand. " <em>Cough </em>... Brother Guang, we can discuss this in private later; right now, Evil Sword God is more important. Can you tell us more about what happened after you encountered Evil Sword God?"</p>

    <p>"Mm, of course."</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang nodded and quickly replied, "When I fought Evil Sword God back then, even before I had launched two strikes, I already knew what the outcome would be. This man's evil nature is even more horrifying than what the rumors say. A ball of sword qi created through Sword Dao coalesced around his entire body, and I couldn't get near to him at all...</p>

    <p>"I could only use long-range spells, and I fled while casting obstruction spells. If my water spells hadn't been of a profound level, it's very likely I would have long been hacked to death by his Heaven-Cleaving Sword! Now that I think about it, that truly was a disgrace! This old man had cultivated to True Immortal level, and never before had my situation in battle become desperate enough for me to rely on a water clone to escape..."</p>

    <p>For Taoist Guang, this was the most humiliating confrontation of his life. "But now that I think about it carefully, it seemed like he wasn't in the mood to fight me, but instead was looking for something... he only sent a clone to hunt me down."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "And then?"</p>

    <p>"Later, I deliberately faked my death at his clone's hand to try and divert his attention... Although Evil Sword God is strong, he tried to have this old man killed with just one clone; this just proves that this person is as arrogant and self-important as the rumors say."</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang typed: "After the success of my fake death cover-up, I didn't dare act rashly, and I sent out several water clones to search for him at the previous location. When I found him again, he was entering an opening that had just been set up."</p>

    <p>"He left the Gate Between Worlds?"</p>

    <p>Everyone knew that there was a five-year restriction on the Gate Between Worlds in the outside world; if it was summoned through a magic array instead of descending on its own, there was a five-year cooldown period before it could be summoned again.</p>

    <p>If you wanted to leave the Gate Between Worlds, apart from seizing the moment the Gate Between Worlds opened to leave, another way was to look for the small space openings hidden inside the Gate Between Worlds. As long as you could find these small space breaches, they could spit you out into the outside world.</p>

    <p>However, Taoist Guang shook his head. "No... he didn't leave..."</p>

    <p>He typed: "The Gate Between Worlds has a lot of small openings that can spit people out. This was probably a deliberate design on Immortal Zhenyuan's part. It might appear that there's no order to them, but in fact there's a regular look about them. During those years when I was traveling around the demon world, I chanced upon more than a hundred of them... The opening that Evil Sword God went into was obviously different from the others.</p>

    <p>"After Evil Sword God stepped through the opening, the water clones I sent saw it rapidly start to disappear before their eyes... After that, although I successfully entered the opening, I was completely unable to withstand the force of the space being torn apart by solely relying on the strength of the water clones. Not long after that, they turned into a heap of bubbles..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang: "But before they turned into bubbles, I saw with my own eyes Evil Sword God step into another space..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Another space?"</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang nodded. "That's right! If the Gate Between Worlds is regarded as the transmission link between the human world and the demon world, then in the middle of this link, there is also a space entrance no one knows about - if my guess is correct, that space is precisely the entrance to the Immortal's Treasure House!</p>

    <p>"But it was very clear that the space opening which Evil Sword God stepped into isn't something that can be activated at will, but will only open after certain special conditions are met. I call this special space cavern the entrance to the Otherworld."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
