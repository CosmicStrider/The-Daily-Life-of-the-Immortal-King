  <h1>Chapter 585 The Green Light Which Floods the Horizon</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wen Yu looked at the incredible scene in front of him and hardly dared believe it... the tenth generation leader's voice had well and truly resounded in his ear, and it lingered as a continuous echo.</p>

    <p>He had never expected this...</p>

    <p>Tenth Generation Leader, who back then had been framed by the other demon kings and pushed out of the Gate Between Worlds to charge and break through enemy lines before dying, had actually showed up again in front of him in this form.</p>

    <p>Tenth Generation... is that really you?</p>

    <p>The young man's legs already couldn't support him anymore and turned weak.</p>

    <p>Although its appearance and aura had completely changed, this voice... it indeed belonged to Tenth Generation Leader! Since young, Wen Yu had always had the impression of an imposing yet kindly voice, which was very soothing.</p>

    <p>"Yes, child, I'm back. I didn't die, but continued my life in this form." When Er Ha approached the young man, the latter already couldn't hold himself up anymore as he fell to his knees and started to cry bitterly.</p>

    <p>Er Ha didn't know what on earth had happened in the Tuntian Ha clan's Sprout Village, but from its prophetic dream, it could guess that it was something big. It was also obvious that as the backbone of the younger generation, it was Wen Yu who had been painstakingly holding up the village. Thus, the moment he saw Er Ha, he already couldn't contain his emotions as he started to sob.</p>

    <p>Er Ha placed one dog paw on the young man's shoulder. "It has been hard on all of you when I wasn't around."</p>

    <p>It had already been a long time since Er Ha had actually spoken in the tone of a leader after it had started to follow Little Master Ling. For one thing, it wasn't used to it, and for another thing, Er Ha had started to forget its days as a "king" after living in a human cultivation city.</p>

    <p>But it had returned this time to completely end everything; for the sake of fulfilling its obligation and its final duty as "king," Er Ha would play this role once more.</p>

    <p>Naturally, it would be for the last time.</p>

    <p>Er Ha quietly waited for the young man to gather himself together.</p>

    <p>Seeing that Wen Yu had calmed down after a few minutes, Er Ha gently asked, "After I disappeared, did a new king take office?"</p>

    <p>"No... no."</p>

    <p>Wen Yu wiped his tears. "Grandfather always believed you weren't dead, and everyone has been waiting for your return."</p>

    <p>It was as Er Ha had expected.</p>

    <p>It lowered its head and pondered; everything was the same as in its prophetic dream.</p>

    <p>Er Ha stretched out a paw and pressed it to Wen Yu's forehead. "Don't move, just relax. I'm going to find out what on earth happened in the village."</p>

    <p>It was a simple memory extraction spell which required the cooperation of the person in question. Er Ha knew something big had happened in the village, but there was no way for Wen Yu to explain it in just a few words; thus, it might as well directly search Wen Yu's memories itself, which was more convenient.</p>

    <p>In the end, it might have been better if it hadn't. After seeing Wen Yu's memories and understanding what had happened to the village, Er Ha was so infuriated that all its fur bristled!</p>

    <p>It clenched its teeth and bellowed, "These three demon gods are really going too far!"</p>

    <p>For now, Er Ha hadn't completely inherited the power of sword Dao; once it fully absorbed it, even if it wasn't yet a first-class spirit beast, it felt that it could still fight a demon god on equal footing!</p>

    <p>Elder Wen was in danger now and had most likely been detained at the peace consulate; Er Ha felt that it had to rush there at once!</p>

    <p>"Wen Yu, I'm going to go save Elder Wen. He's our clan's founding minister, I'll definitely protect him."</p>

    <p>"Tenth Generation, what are you going to do?"</p>

    <p>"Hehe... anyone who dares come, I'll just string them up and beat them up!" Er Ha laughed, sounding very confident as its tone betrayed a hint of ruthlessness.</p>

    <p>They were just three petty envoys; Er Ha thought nothing of them at all.</p>

    <p>"Wen Yu, before this matter is resolved, please protect the rest of the clan," Er Ha said as it looked at the young man.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, Tenth Generation!" The young man nodded his head.</p>

    <p>"Mm, also... please keep my return this time a secret. Don't speak of it to anyone, including your grandfather, understand?" said Er Ha.</p>

    <p>Wen Yu was baffled. "Why?"</p>

    <p>"I'm already no longer a demon king."</p>

    <p>It turned around and looked at its village.</p>

    <p>After a while, it gazed at him and said, "My Daoist name now is Immortal Two!"</p>

    <p>Wen Yu: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, a little demon courier from Yaotuan<sup>1</sup> very quickly sent the incubation demon potion to the peace consulate after Elder Wen placed an online order.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A riff on the Chinese food delivery app 'Meituan.''Yao' means 'demon .. ')</dfn>

    <p>When the little demon courier arrived at the consulate entrance, it was taken aback - this place was a little too classy. As a low-level demon, it probably would never be able to set foot in this place in its entire life.</p>

    <p>Standing outside the consulate, the little demon asked diffidently, "May I ask, this is Mr Wen's delivery?"</p>

    <p>Elder Wen was sitting inside the consulate. When he heard the little demon's question, he immediately replied happily, "That's right, I ordered it. Come in directly!"</p>

    <p>Holding the incubation demon potion delivery which Elder Wen had ordered, the little demon courier's heart trembled...</p>

    <p>Holy shit!</p>

    <p>It could actually enter?</p>

    <p>But this was the peace consulate!</p>

    <p>Trembling, the courier little demon entered, and in the next second, it almost wet its pants.</p>

    <p>That was because apart from Elder Wen inside the peace consulate, the envoys from the three other territories were giving it sinister looks and gnashing their teeth as if they were simply going to eat it!</p>

    <p>The courier little demon couldn't help trembling all over. "M- Mr Wen... your - your delivery item."</p>

    <p>"Don't be nervous, the peace consulate has Demon Saint's restriction on it. There might be something wrong with their brains, but they won't hurt you." Elder Wen smiled.</p>

    <p>The three envoys from the other territories: "..."</p>

    <p>"I see..."</p>

    <p>When it heard this, the little demon courier breathed a sigh of relief, and then looked at the three envoys a little angrily. "Look at yourselves! Are those the types of expressions peace envoys should have? In any case, you're officials for three of the territories in the demon world, but you look like fiends... Be careful that I don't file complaints against you!"</p>

    <p>The envoys from the three other territories: "..."</p>

    <p>After saying that, the little demon courier tsked before it directly slammed the door and left.</p>

    <p>In that moment, the three envoys couldn't be any more enraged.</p>

    <p>Daoist Horse Face trembled with fury. "Wen He, don't go too far! If you dare, let's go out and fight one on one! I guarantee on my honor as a demon that Daoist Witch Demon and Daoist Bronze Turtle won't interfere in our duel!"</p>

    <p>But right after Daoist Horse Face said this, the window of the peace consulate was lit up by a mysterious green light.</p>

    <p>Elder Wen: "???"</p>

    <p>The envoys from the three other territories: "???"</p>

    <p>What was going on?</p>

    <p>Right at that moment!</p>

    <p>All of a sudden...</p>

    <p>With an explosive bang!</p>

    <p>A beam of spirit light directly broke through the window...</p>

    <p>It directly and ruthlessly hit Daoist Horse Face in the face, knocking it so out of shape that even several of his teeth were crushed.</p>

    <p>Everyone gazed at this scene with stunned and pale faces.</p>

    <p>Because it was a wrathful flying kick...</p>

    <p>From a green-furred dog...</p>
