  <h1>Chapter 757 Soul-Repairing Art</h1>

  <div>

    <p>On the other side, after being slapped by Wang Ling who had borrowed President Qi's mental powers to possess Insect Envoy Long Ming, Night Ghost Spirit Emperor finally woke up from his comatose state... but even if he had regained consciousness, he was in such bad condition that he couldn't even get up.</p>

    <p>Unlike the few slaps Wang Ling had given Evil Sword God, this slap contained fifty percent of Wang Ling's strength after he took off half of his Dao talisman seal.</p>

    <p>Of all the slaps he had given so far, this one was of very high quality.</p>

    <p>If they were graded on a scale, the slaps that Wang Ling had given Evil Sword God were just regular ones, while the upper grade ones were: slightly serious slap, very serious slap, extremely serious slap, expert appraisal slap, and the ultimate Buddhist Palm.</p>

    <p>And the slap just now happened to be at the "very serious slap" level.</p>

    <p>Not only had it thrashed Night Ghost Spirit Emperor physically, even his soul had been shaken, causing him pain and torment.</p>

    <p>At that moment, although he was already awake, he couldn't move. Every acupuncture point and every pore in his whole body felt like volcanoes erupting, resulting in searing pain.</p>

    <p>That kind of mental strength just now...</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor was certain, it was definitely Huaxiu's Wisdom Saint; he was very familiar with this aura...</p>

    <p>Although he hadn't fought Wisdom Saint face to face before this, Night Ghost Spirit Emperor felt that he did have some knowledge of the latter. The other side was good at using his mental powers to wrest control over long distances. In this world, Wisdom Saint was the only person who could demonstrate the power of the mind to this extent.</p>

    <p>Mental strength was a type of power that was nurtured at a young age and was different from spirit energy... It didn't require a spiritual root, but it was extremely difficult to cultivate.</p>

    <p>President Qi's actual combat ability wasn't very strong, because he had reached the pinnacle of mental strength...</p>

    <p>As Night Ghost Spirit Emperor understood it, there was no one in this world who could cultivate mental strength and spirit energy at the same time.</p>

    <p>You couldn't have your cake and eat it too; this was precise proof of this point.</p>

    <p>So when Night Ghost Spirit Emperor was slapped, he never considered that it was Wang Ling who had done it.</p>

    <p>As he wailed endlessly, he only felt that the power in this slap was too unfathomable.</p>

    <p>Huaxiu Alliance...</p>

    <p>It seemed that he couldn't underestimate this place.</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor instantly felt that he didn't know enough about the Ten Generals, and he would have to do in-depth research after this.</p>

    <p>He had always thought that President Qi was just a mental strength expert, and never expected him to have attained such a terrifying level of cultivation.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Night Ghost Spirit Emperor realized his blunder.</p>

    <p>There were times when to know yourself and your enemy was the only way to triumph!</p>

    <p>People made blunders every day in this world - it wasn't too late to realize it now, otherwise if he waited for Little Sister Milk Tea to become Little Sister Matcha Tea, it would really be too late for regrets <sup>1</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Refers to Zhang Zetian who
shot to Internet fame as
"Sister Milk Tea" and her
husband who was accused of
cheating on her ..)</dfn>

    <p>These were the type of thought-provoking reflections Night Ghost Spirit Emperor had as he lay on the ground and endured the pain from the slap.</p>

    <p>Ten minutes or so later, there was still no movement on Night Chief's end...</p>

    <p>That slap had sent him flying too far away, and now Night Ghost Spirit Emperor was lying in a desert. Who knew how long it would take those blockhead subordinates of his to find him.</p>

    <p>So in the end, Night Ghost Spirit Emperor could only think of a way to save himself.</p>

    <p>His injury was very serious, so he could only release True Immortal qi continuously to recover.</p>

    <p>But that slap carried the "major damage effect." Even though he was using True Immortal qi, his recovery was crawling along as slow as a snail climbing a tree, which was a pain in the ass.</p>

    <p>Poor Night Ghost Spirit Emperor could only slowly recover from his injuries and start by trying to move his fingers...</p>

    <p>For now, he could only use one-hand seals to cast some recovery spells.</p>

    <p>And so...</p>

    <p>After another twenty minutes...</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor could finally move one finger!</p>

    <p>This was the moment!</p>

    <p>"Soul-Repairing Art!" Night Ghost Spirit Emperor made a hand seal with just one finger.</p>

    <p>In a split second, a blue array with complex runes appeared on the ground with Night Ghost Spirit Emperor in its center. Hazy light curled above the array, and countless souls hovered above his head to repair his soul.</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor had translated and edited the foreign and rare volume of forbidden spells, "Dark Bible," from the "Shadow Priest's Collection," to create this Soul-Repairing Art. In theory, this was also a forbidden art that couldn't gain international recognition. The way it worked was that Night Ghost Spirit Emperor controlled the souls which he had been swallowing all this time by turning them into his slaves that would fill in the gaps in his own damaged soul.</p>

    <p>And once these summoned souls were depleted of soul energy, they would be utterly destroyed.</p>

    <p>From the moment Night Ghost Spirit Emperor absorbed these souls, they became his servants as well as pawns that could be abandoned at any time.</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor closed his eyes and enjoyed the cozy feeling of being restored by these souls. Although he was now lying in a desert, it felt like an outdoor spa.</p>

    <p>A while later, more than half of Night Ghost Spirit Emperor's arms and hands had recovered, and he could already move.</p>

    <p>Performing another hand seal, he examined his soul repository, which contained all the souls he had swallowed over the last century...</p>

    <p>"That's right... Bai Zhe that brat..."</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor laughed sinisterly as he recalled President Bai all of a sudden.</p>

    <p>He had swallowed President Bai's soul a while ago. He remembered that President Bai's ability to recover was very strong.</p>

    <p>"Just nice, I'll use Bai Zhe's soul later to help me recover from my injuries." Night Ghost Spirit Emperor thought this was a great plan for later.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>And so, after his soul was twenty to thirty percent recovered, he gave the summons. "Bai Zhe, come out..."</p>

    <p>A white shadow slowly coalesced in front of him.</p>

    <p>This person was precisely that President Bai who had been swallowed by Night Ghost Spirit Emperor.</p>

    <p>It was clear that President Bai had been tormented badly in the soul repository. His hair was disheveled and his cheeks were deeply sunken in.</p>

    <p>The soul repository was like a prison. The souls of thousands of experts were detained here, and the souls of newcomers would definitely go through the so-called "newbie hazing."</p>

    <p>"Bai Zhe... it appears you've gotten a lot thinner?" Night Ghost Spirit Emperor chuckled.</p>

    <p>"Speak for yourself." President Bai looked at Night Ghost Spirit Emperor's sorry condition and his voice was ice cold.</p>

    <p>"Kneel!"</p>

    <p>With just one command from Night Ghost Spirit Emperor, President Bai couldn't control the way his knees dropped to the ground.</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor lifted President Bai's chin with one hand with the air of one who wielded all the power. "You are now my slave... No matter how sorry my state looks, I advise that you best be careful with your words since you are a soul slave, or there'll be nothing left of you. I can throw you into the Soul-Repairing Art array as raw material whenever I want, understand?"</p>

    <p>There was some unwillingness on President Bai's face, but he then clenched his teeth. "I... I understand... Master..."</p>
