  <h1>Chapter 438 Long Johns Save His Life... </h1>

  <div>

    <p>On the street light, that very evil-looking young man introduced himself in a very chuuni tone, and Lord Diulei couldn't help directly blurting out 'psycho' when he heard it... There was something very wrong with this guy - maybe he was a mental patient who had escaped from some mental hospital?</p>

    <p>Senior Immortal's imagination ran wild; he didn't dare take this lightly. Though the young man was about ten <em>zhang </em>away from him, he already felt oppressed by that evil aura!</p>

    <p>The young man in white subconsciously grasped his "Brilliant Victory sword," and realized that his hand was actually trembling...</p>

    <p>He couldn't help the cold sweat that ran down his cheeks - this was the first time he felt the shivers all the way down into his soul!</p>

    <p>Letting this type of mentally ill patient run wild on the streets was bound to cause chaos!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei felt that he should probably take this person back to the hospital.</p>

    <p>But very quickly, he suddenly recalled the Daoist name that this evil young man had introduced himself with.</p>

    <p>Hm...</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God...</p>

    <p>Sword God...</p>

    <p>God...</p>

    <p>"Fuck! This guy is Evil Sword God!"</p>

    <p>Because of the evil young man's spastic self-introduction, Lord Diulei's neurons had taken a long time to process it before he was finally struck with realization.</p>

    <p>But why had Evil Sword God suddenly shown up here?</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei grit his teeth and looked up again at the street light that Evil Sword God was standing on. But at that moment, Evil Sword God had already disappeared!</p>

    <p>The next moment, there was a hand on Lord Diulei's shoulder, and a voice that inspired terror in the depths of the soul asked, "Looking for me?"</p>

    <p>This speed... Was this a teleportation spell?</p>

    <p>Shocked, Lord Diulei tilted his head, but could only see half the evil young man's face and the sinister smile on it. "Bold junior, you have the guts to try and track sword qi back to me? I'll get rid of half your shoulder first..."</p>

    <p>The next moment, Lord Diulei felt a great pressure on his right shoulder as a ball of demonic energy coalesced in Evil Sword God's hand.</p>

    <p>At the same time, a voice resounded in Lord Diulei's mind. "This ball of spirit power contains the Sword Dao qi of my Heaven-Cleaving sword; anyone under Itinerant Immortal level will be permanently wounded, and not even divine medicine will help."</p>

    <p>After that, with a loud "bang," the ball of spirit power which contained evil sword qi exploded.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was directly thrown off his feet by the explosion, and he flew several kilometers before hitting the ground from the violent attack.</p>

    <p>Contrary to expectations, he wasn't bleeding; the ball of spirit power had unexpectedly only burned a hole in the outside Daoist robe of this young man in white.</p>

    <p>"Hm?"</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God stared at this scene from a distance. The situation was a little outside his expectations.</p>

    <p>"That was dangerous..." Lord Diulei was sweating a little. His white Daoist robe had been destroyed... This was the latest in high fashion from Armani! Because it was too expensive, he had only bought two sets and had planned to regularly switch them out!</p>

    <p>But one of them was now directly written off!</p>

    <p>When he shifted, the basketball-sized hole in the shoulder of his white Daoist robe revealed the long johns that Mother Wang had given him.</p>

    <p>These long johns had obviously been enchanted by Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>Had it not been for the power it contained, Lord Diulei was well aware that he would have been severely injured by such an explosion.</p>

    <p>At that moment, the young man in white could also already guess why Evil Sword God was looking for him.</p>

    <p>Since they could use the Daoist robe which Daoist Guang had left behind to track the remnants of the sword qi on it back to Evil Sword God, then naturally, he could also use it to find them.</p>

    <p>Previously, the Daoist robe had been sealed away, and Evil Sword God had already thought that Daoist Guang was dead, so he had stopped hunting him.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei hadn't expected Evil Sword God to be alerted by the reverse tracking of sword qi.</p>

    <p>In the end, he was the one who had been careless!</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God had currently already mastered the power of Sword Dao, one of the Three Thousand Great Spells, and was especially sensitive to Sword Dao. He could even clearly grasp sword qi as an intangible form.</p>

    <p>Thinking back carefully, Lord Diulei recalled that when he had been at the research institute earlier, he had apparently used that tattered Daoist robe to wipe at his sweat...</p>

    <p>It was most likely at that moment that his body had become contaminated with the residual sword qi!</p>

    <p>"A single slip, a lifetime of regret!" Lord Diulei felt extremely remorseful.</p>

    <p>Looking at the situation, he already knew he wasn't strong enough to fight back, so he could only think of a way to look for Wang Ling first.</p>

    <p>Thinking this, he immediately stepped onto his Brilliant Victory sword and flew at heaven-defying speed in the direction of the Wang family's small villa.</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God's technique was too strong. Lord Diulei had barely stepped on his sword when he realized that all the electronic equipment he was carrying on him had been destroyed by the other party's overflowing sword qi.</p>

    <p>It wasn't just that; actually, when Evil Sword God had put his hand on Lord Diulei's shoulder just now...</p>

    <p>The instant he had discharged the spirit power, all the street lights had instantly gone out, turning everything pitch black.</p>

    <p>All the electronic equipment in the nearby area, including cars driving on the road, instantly stopped working, completely wrecked by the evil sword qi!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the darkness, Evil Sword God opened his eyes, and his pupils glowed a faint purple, creating a very mystical air.</p>

    <p>Interesting... Evil Sword God sneered. He hadn't expected the young man in white to actually be unharmed by his move earlier. This proved that the armor that the young man was wearing under his Daoist robe wasn't of inferior workmanship.</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God looked in the direction that Lord Diulei had escaped, and his eyes focused on the spirit sword under Lord Diulei's feet.</p>

    <p>Although the sword was wrapped in layers of seals, it gave him a very familiar feeling.</p>

    <p>The reason why his <em>shizun </em>Fan Rui, who was also called by his Daoist name Heavenly Sword Immortal, had towered famously for thousands of years in Sword Dao, was because of his dual sword technique! And he had had the two swords that were widely acclaimed by the people as great divine swords!</p>

    <p>One was called Heaven-Cleaving, which topped the spirit swords power rankings, and which was also the sword that Evil Sword God had seized and now wielded.</p>

    <p>The other was called Brilliant Victory, which topped the spirit swords defense rankings; it was extremely strong at parrying attacks and had powerful defensive attributes.</p>

    <p>After he had murdered his <em>shifu </em>back then and snatched Heaven-Cleaving from the latter's hand, he had been looking for Brilliant Victory ever since...</p>

    <p>Even though Brilliant Victory's aura was wrapped in layers of seals, he had still been able to detect the scent it emitted when he had gotten close to it earlier.</p>

    <p>"That's definitely it..."</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God stuck out his long pointed tongue and licked his lips.</p>

    <p>Originally he had just wanted to come out to teach the junior, who had the guts to track his aura through sword qi, a lesson, but who would have thought he would have inadvertently discovered Brilliant Victory sword's whereabouts.</p>

    <p>But... why was the Brilliant Victory sword in this person's hands?</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God let out a sinister laugh.</p>

    <p>Forget it, catch this person first!</p>

    <p>No one could escape from him...</p>
