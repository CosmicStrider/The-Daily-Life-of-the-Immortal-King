  <h1>Chapter 310 Damn Brother-Con! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Based on their mutual understanding of each other, the number of times Wang Ling looked for Wang Ming of his own accord could be counted on one hand. And any time Wang Ming did receive a request, it could put him in a bright mood for the whole day at the research institute. He didn't even need to eat, since he could make himself full just by laughing.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, owning a realm of unlimited growth and absolute power didn't mean you didn't need help. As Wang Ling's cousin, Wang Ming wanted to do what he could to help his brother.</p>

    <p>Therefore, even if Wang Ling didn't normally look for him, Wang Ming had given any contact from Wang Ling, through whatever means of communication, VIP status, so that Wang Ling's message would be the first thing he would see. Thus, replying in a second could simply be considered a normal operation for Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>When it came to family, the little brother closest to Wang Ming was Wang Ling, and he was the only one. If he didn't help his own little brother, who would?</p>

    <p>After staring for several moments at the screenshot which Wang Ling had sent him, Wang Ming's eyebrows had gradually become tightly knitted together, and in the end, he actually called Wang Ling back. "Hello? Lingzi?"</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling exhaled a breath to indicate his presence.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming understood. "I have to come over to explain this to you in person. Mm! Then, that's that, bye!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..." What damn bye!</p>

    <p>After that, Wang Ming directly hung up, giving Wang Ling no opportunity at all to refuse.</p>

    <p>After hanging up at the research institute, he happily stuck out his legs and even hummed a little, looking as delighted as if he had won the lottery.</p>

    <p>President Qi, who was tinkering with a test tube on the side, glanced at Wang Ming and laughed. "Teasing your younger brother again?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was a little surprised. "How did you know?"</p>

    <p>President Qi stared at Wang Ming with a knowing expression. The corners of his mouth tilted upward despite himself, and there was a teasing light in his eyes. "You basically do your research here every day with a stiff face; it's only when you're teasing your younger brother that you smile like a fool."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was speechless for a moment, then his lips thinned as he said, "No, I don't..."</p>

    <p>President Qi didn't say anything else, because there was no point in arguing about it at all. He hummed with amusement in his heart: Heh, this damn brother-con...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>As soon as Wang Ling walked inside when he returned home that day, he saw the old man enter the kitchen in high spirits with two giant coral groupers in his hands. This was Wang Ming's most favorite food; he was as mad about it as Wang Ling was about crispy noodle snacks.</p>

    <p>It was very obvious that Wang Ming had already let the Wang couple and the old man know beforehand that he was coming.</p>

    <p>Mother Wang came back downstairs after collecting the laundry, ready to help the old man. When she saw that Wang Ling had returned, she immediately smiled. "Ling Ling, I never thought that you would actually know how to be more understanding."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling cocked his head slightly. "???"</p>

    <p>Mother Wang covered her mouth as she smiled broadly. "Your elder brother called me today and said you personally invited him to come over. I couldn't believe it."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Sometimes we need to visit family as much as possible. Otherwise, how can we call ourselves family? It's only when you visit each other and become close that you are family. Nowadays, how many people are closer to their neighbours than to their relatives? Don't you think that's terrible?" As Mother Wang spoke, she put on her apron, her face wreathed in smiles. "Well, I'm going to go help cook. You go spend some time with your father in the living room."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had been startled by Mother Wang's words, and completely didn't dare refute them... But he also couldn't find any reason to do so, since they were reasonable.</p>

    <p>"Sit down~" Father Wang patted the spot next to him on the sofa.</p>

    <p>After his hand "exploded" yesterday, Father Wang had surpassed his normal performance and had written all the two hundred thousand words that were set to be released this week, which was why he could leisurely go downstairs to watch the evening news before dinner. To Wang Ling, it felt like it had been a very long time since they had sat on the sofa to watch the news together after Father Wang had started writing his new book, The Live Streaming Life of the Immortal King .</p>

    <p>Just then, it so happened that the TV was reporting major news.</p>

    <p>The female newscaster sitting demurely in front of the camera scanned the script in her hands and said solemnly, "According to the latest information, Zhuo Yi, Director of Songhai city's General Administration of 100 Schools, worked with Winter city's Sanyuan Road Cultivation Police Department to destroy a huge dark force organization yesterday. The main suspect, Cheng Yu, along with over one hundred key figures, have been recruiting people all over the country, setting up branches and creating chaos as they gathered together an army. Currently, based on Cheng Yu's confession, they have already launched several operations around the country."</p>

    <p>This was followed by a live broadcast of a female reporter at the scene.</p>

    <p>In the image, Master of Immortal Mansion Cheng Yu was wearing Spirit Shackles and being escorted by several people from a police car to Winter city's detention center. His face had been covered with mosaic tiles. He was still dressed in his red Taoist robes, and looked even more haggard than when Wang Ling and the others had left.</p>

    <p>"Who you're seeing now is the main suspect in the case who wanted his name withheld, Mr Cheng Yu."</p>

    <p>The female reporter pointed at Cheng Yu, then hurried closer with a microphone. "Mr Cheng Yu who wanted his name withheld, do you have anything to say at the moment?"</p>

    <p>Cheng Yu: "..."</p>

    <p>Although Cheng Yu's face was covered with a thick layer of mosaic tiles on TV, Wang Ling could still see his dumbstruck expression as he stared at the female reporter.</p>

    <p>Father Wang stared at Cheng Yu on the news for three seconds, then turned to Wang Ling. "You did this, right?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang rubbed his jaw. "I heard this female newscaster say just now that Little Zhuo went to Winter city. Generally speaking, he would only go if you did, right?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at Father Wang in astonishment; he hadn't thought Father Wang would actually see through their top secret mission.</p>

    <p>Father Wang saw Wang Ling's amazement and already knew everything. He patted Wang Ling's shoulder on the spot. "You're my son. How could I not see through this scheme of yours?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, I'm not blaming you. This type of lawless force should be stopped, and based on how much strength you used, this person has probably been harassing us for quite a while, right? I heard from your grandfather before that there had been a big man lurking outside the door, and Ah Ke <sup>1</sup> dealt with him in an instant."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Jingke's name reduced by
using the familial or intimate
'Ah' prefix.)</dfn>

    <p>Looking at the TV, Father Wang couldn't help laughing. "But you pushed a little too hard this time; even his hair was forced to turn white."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "I remember a while ago, there was news about a parent forcing their child to learn maths, and the child's hair later turned white. Now, that child spends every day breaking their fingers and toes, and asking what one thousand minus seven is <sup>2</sup> ..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is from the series 'Tokyo
Ghoul,' and is one way in
which the white-haired
protagonist tries to retain his
sanity while he is being
tortured ..)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
