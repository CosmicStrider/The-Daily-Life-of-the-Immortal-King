  <h1>Chapter 946 Is There a Scholar Drunk Moon?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>As Brain King's right hand on Earth for many years, the abrupt death of the mechanical octopus codenamed "Governor" naturally caught Brain King's attention.</p>

    <p>A mysterious Almighty cultivator on Earth whom they didn't know about... Brain King couldn't help shivering at this thought. This was a situation he had never expected. He thought he knew everything about Earth, when in fact he didn't.</p>

    <p>Naturally, it never occurred to him that the Brain King clan would provoke a monster of unknown strength.</p>

    <p>"It's my fault." The instant the mechanical octopus died, Brain King's brain waves almost instantly received the signal that a life had disappeared. He sighed.</p>

    <p>Brain King's whole body was made of light metal, and even his eyes were mechanical. Maybe it was because he had received news of the mechanical octopus's death that his mechanical eyes which had never changed now flashed red.</p>

    <p>Maybe he should have noticed early on how "weird" Earth was...</p>

    <p>The tyrannical Divine Dragon clan had been expanding throughout the universe since the beginning. They enslaved countless people and devoured their home planets. But after the Divine Dragons made plans to devour Earth a while back...</p>

    <p>In the end, not only was Earth unscathed, the Divine Dragon clan's attitude changed completely...</p>

    <p>Not only did they free the enslaved aliens, they returned the home planets to them and helped rebuild their homes, and even wanted to establish diplomatic relations with Earth.</p>

    <p>This bigwig of unknown strength intervening from the shadows was like a Sichuan opera-style face change <sup>1</sup> horror story...</p>

    <p>As one of the most intelligent life forms in the universe, Brain King felt that he had noticed this too late.</p>

    <p>Sitting upright in his leather armchair, he kneaded his forehead and felt a slight headache.</p>

    <p>"Are you alright, Lord Brain King?" asked the secret envoy of the Brain King clan on the side, who was assisting him.</p>

    <p>"I'm fine." Brain King shook his head. "Go, fetch me a primordial black crystal skull. Make sure it's of better quality, my head hurts."</p>

    <p>"Yes, Lord Brain King." The secret envoy nodded.</p>

    <p>Brain King was facing a fierce internal struggle.</p>

    <p>He knew that he had already provoked a terrifying Almighty whom even the Divine Dragons didn't dare provoke. Not only didn't they dare provoke him, they were even currying favor with him...</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, he couldn't stop his plan.</p>

    <p>Since things had come to this point, Brain King felt he had to go all the way.</p>

    <p>This had to do with the fate of the entire Brain King clan.</p>

    <p>Brain King Star's planet core worked by absorbing the brain waves Brain King emitted. The planet was approaching the end of its life and its aging population was a serious cause of concern. The brain waves provided by the planet's inhabitants after they died could no longer keep the planet functioning. Brain King had no choice but to take a desperate risk and devour an alien brain.</p>

    <p>And just a few years ago, he had detected powerful brain waves coming from none other than Earth.</p>

    <p>It was from that moment on that Brain King knew.</p>

    <p>There was a wise man on Earth who surpassed any on Brain King Star.</p>

    <p>To save the inhabitants of an entire planet, he had to find this wise man.</p>

    <p>Brain King was well aware that his move was like stepping into the eye of a storm and could be considered extremely dangerous.</p>

    <p>But he currently had no choice.</p>

    <p>Thinking this, Brain King looked up at the air and muttered to himself, "I am sorry, wise man of Earth... To save my people, you need to be sacrificed... Whatever it takes, this king will find you..."</p>

    <p>"Lord Brain King, the new skull has arrived." At this moment, the secret envoy suddenly returned.</p>

    <p>"Mm, change it for me. Also..."</p>

    <p>Brain King stood up. "I'm going to Earth. Brother Octopus is already dead, and I don't have much time left. I'll do it myself."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, with the sudden death of the mechanical octopus, the prison mahjong trio's mission proceeded smoothly. Group Leader Detention Island was originally an independent space built by the Brain King clan using data. It couldn't be broken using normal means, but when the terminal router was destroyed and the network cut, the island's bugs were instantly exposed.</p>

    <p>With three slashes of his sword, Evil Sword God created three large holes in the island, and all the water army group leaders who had been imprisoned here were finally freed today.</p>

    <p>A director once filmed a movie called <em>Django Unchained </em>. Evil Sword God felt that this historic scene could totally be adapted for a movie called <em>Fat Shut-Ins Unchained </em>...</p>

    <p>How wonderful was the smell of freedom? The moment they were released, these imprisoned group leaders were overwhelmed by myriad emotions and profound understanding...</p>

    <p>They spent their days on Group Leader Detention Island eating junk food and gaming to obtain items over and over again until they felt like throwing up.</p>

    <p>What had once been a source of endless joy now left them with trauma as a side effect.</p>

    <p>However, what they would face next was a new round of punishment.</p>

    <p>Warden Liang dispatched dozens of prison vehicles from Songhai First Prison to Crow County, which took up an entire street. Crow County's Internet cafe became an exit for Group Leader Detention Island, and the water army group leaders were led out in handcuffs by prison guards.</p>

    <p>Many of them had complicated expressions; some were even smiling, but this definitely wasn't because they were crazy.</p>

    <p>It was relief at being freed.</p>

    <p>"Hey, delivery boy, how long will they be locked up for?" the Old Devil asked after grabbing one of the prison guard little brothers.</p>

    <p>"You've rendered outstanding service this time." With a smile, the little brother replied, "For disorderly Internet conduct, they will be given a sentence of one to twelve months. Those who commit cyber fraud will be sentenced according to how much money was involved. Serious cases will mean ten or even twenty years of jail time, but not to the extent of a death penalty."</p>

    <p>This little brother could be considered a veteran at Songhai First Prison, who was also part of the Special Punishment Team. He often delivered meals to the Old Devil and the others, so was quite familiar with the prison trio.</p>

    <p>"So that's it." The trio nodded.</p>

    <p>"By the way, can you not call me delivery boy? I have a name. My name is Guo Zuoren," the little brother guard said helplessly.</p>

    <p>Guo Zuoren...</p>

    <p>Mm...</p>

    <p>In fact, the Old Devil had heard the little brother introduce himself before, and the name sounded a little familiar to him for some reason.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, looking at the little brother's appearance, the Old Devil felt that this person was connected to some person he had met before, perhaps by blood.</p>

    <p>But who on earth could it be...</p>

    <p>The Old Devil couldn't remember.</p>

    <p>"You cracked the case, and Old Liang is very happy. You'll get extra with your meals tonight, so let me know what you want," Guo Zuoren said.</p>

    <p>"Can we order some wine?" The trio exchanged looks; they were all thinking the same thing, and the Old Devil asked on their behalf.</p>

    <p>"What brand?" Guo Zuoren asked.</p>

    <p>"Anything is fine?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, only for tonight."</p>

    <p>"A bottle of Scholar Drunken Moon then."</p>

    <p>"What Drunken Moon?"</p>

    <p>"DRUNKEN, MOON."</p>

    <p>"Oh..." Guo Zuoren nodded. "No problem."</p>

    <p>Scholar Drunken Moon was an old brand of immortal wine.</p>

    <p>It was very famous, and naturally, there were many knock-offs.</p>

    <p>There were now a lot of "Scholar Drunken Moon" on the market, like Most Moon, Drunk Excess, Crime Moon <sup>2</sup> and so on... So it was important to be very clear on the name!</p>
