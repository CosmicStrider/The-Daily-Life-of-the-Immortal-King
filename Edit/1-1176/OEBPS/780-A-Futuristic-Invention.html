  <h1>Chapter 780 A Futuristic Invention</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Just as the head of state and President Qi expected of Wang Ming, he would never do anything that he wasn't sure of.</p>

    <p>Thus, the head of state didn't do anything to stop Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>On one hand, this could be considered a performance test for the mecha armor which Wang Ming had put together ad hoc.</p>

    <p>Actually, the head of state was very curious about how well this suit of armor could perform. Could it really stand up to an Itinerant Immortal? Even if it could only withstand a few blows, that would already be considered a major breakthrough... Because the man controlling the armor was a regular person! In the future, once this suit of armor reached the point of mass production, even a regular person who harbored dreams of cultivation could rely on this armor to navigate the cultivation world.</p>

    <p>This was a new invention that could change the future.</p>

    <p>On top of that, the head of state intended to take advantage of Wu Zhenjun's duel with Wang Ming to find that mysterious expert hiding among the lead teachers. There was still half an hour to go before the space exit for Beast King's Remains opened. That mystery man had to still be here.</p>

    <p>With everyone gathered here now, the mystery man had to be here, too.</p>

    <p>The head of state might be able to find some clues...</p>

    <p>"Your Excellency Head of State..." President Qi's inquiry was already coming through the head of state's headset since the command center had yet to receive clear-cut instructions about whether to stop the duel or not.</p>

    <p>"Little Qiqi, don't worry, I'll control the situation, and when necessary, I'll sort the both of them out properly," the head of state swiftly replied.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wu Zhenjun didn't move, and only lifted his head to look at Wang Ming in the sky. He was hoping that at best, one of the teachers on the scene would come forward to intervene so that at the very least it wouldn't look too embarrassing and would create a way out for both sides.</p>

    <p>But the problem was, no teacher came forward to dissuade them...</p>

    <p>Because just a few seconds ago, President Qi had responded to the head of state's command by sending out the latest instructions. The command center was directly connected to all the teachers on the scene except Wu Zhenjun via their headsets, and they were told not to stop them.</p>

    <p>Naturally... only Wu Zhenjun was unaware of this order.</p>

    <p>Wu Zhenjun waited for a moment before the expression on his face turned somewhat embarrassed. He took a deep breath, then said to Wang Ming in a deep voice, "Lao Gudong Xiaoer... it's still not too late if you give up now."</p>

    <p>Wu Zhenjun was the best at rhythm and sound wave spells. This low call might seem unremarkable, but it was also a type of sound wave spell.</p>

    <p>The onlookers wouldn't feel anything out of the ordinary when they heard this spell since it was aimed only at Wang Ming. Besides, he was also well aware of Wang Ming's identity as an ordinary person, so he used less than half of his strength... Even then, half the strength of an Itinerant Immortal was enough to make an ordinary person dizzy; in more severe cases, they would go into shock.</p>

    <p>He deliberately put pressure on Wang Ming, trying to make him back down.</p>

    <p>But to Wu Zhenjun's surprise, Wang Ming hovered steadily in the air in the mecha armor and didn't budge at all.</p>

    <p>"Wu Zhenjun, did you use less than half of your strength?" Wang Ming laughed. "Actually, there's no need to go easy on me. I'm quite confident in the magic treasure I invented."</p>

    <p>Wu Zhenjun frowned, amazed that Wang Ming actually knew how much strength he had used.</p>

    <p>"I upgraded the armor's ability to do calculations. While I wouldn't dare say it's one hundred percent free of error, it's still accurate over ninety-five percent of the time." Wang Ming smiled.</p>

    <p>Before leaving Beast King's tomb, Wang Ming had given Wang Ling One a third assembly upgrade. Wang Ling One now had a quad core center with longer endurance, a shorter charging period, and the ability to build up power by sacrificing parts when its energy ran low.</p>

    <p>When energy was low, Wang Ling One's quad core center could now forcibly absorb spells cast by the enemy and extract spirit energy from them to recharge itself. But this was a last resort, as it would be a heavy burden on the armor.</p>

    <p>In a regular situation, Wang Ming could now use "Wang Ling One" continuously for a week. In combat and at full power, it could last up to two hours.</p>

    <p>Besides the core center, Wang Ming had done an overall upgrade of Wang Ling One's ability to extrapolate data... This was in fact thanks to Qin Lang's help.</p>

    <p>Qin Lang's roots could directly stretch into the outside world from inside the remains, so Wang Ming had asked Qin Lang to have his roots penetrate the sky and help him get a spare Head of State 001 microchip from the research institute.</p>

    <p>The chip was loaded with current world cultivation data on things like magic treasures, spells, and spirit techniques that were on record.</p>

    <p>Just like Old Qi and the head of state expected of Wang Ming...</p>

    <p>He would never do something that he wasn't sure about.</p>

    <p>"Be bold and come at me, Wu Zhenjun. This isn't a contest, but a performance test for my newly developed scientific magic treasure." Hoping that Wu Zhenjun would take up the challenge, Wang Ming smiled and tried a different angle. "I'm challenging Wu Zhenjun in all sincerity; if you don't respond kindly, I'll be very hurt!"</p>

    <p>Wu Zhenjun pressed his lips together, still hesitating over whether he should make a move.</p>

    <p>He suddenly thought of a line in a TV drama, when a teenager yelled at a general riding a big horse in front of him: <em>Soul Sky Emperor, do you dare dismount and fight me <sup>1</sup> </em><em>?</em></p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(From the TV drama "Battle Through The Heavens..")</dfn>

    <p>At that very moment, this sense of deja vu could be said to be very strong...</p>

    <p>Thus, Wu Zhenjun was in a dilemma over the current situation.</p>

    <p>Because Wang Ming was an ordinary person, Wu Zhenjun didn't dare be too heavy-handed. What if he injured the brain of this "strongest brain"? That would be the country's loss, and he didn't dare shoulder that blame.</p>

    <p>But if he didn't make a move now, it would instead seem as if he was a coward, which would directly affect his qualification appraisal for emperor medal teacher this year.</p>

    <p>The number of qualified gold medal teachers was limited to ten thousand each year.</p>

    <p>But the number of qualified emperor teachers was just one hundred.</p>

    <p>In comparison, the qualification appraisal for emperor teachers was more rigorous, and considered all kinds of aspects.</p>

    <p>Battle strength was just one of the criteria.</p>

    <p>Class achievements, quality, prestige, student opinion and so on... These were all very important.</p>

    <p>And so, in a position where he was unable to back down, Wu Zhenjun could only do the next best thing. "Lao Gudong Xiaoer, it wouldn't be fair to you if I fight at full strength. Can you tell me exactly what level your armor's battle strength is at now? I'll seal my excess strength and fight you then."</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, Wang Ming directly waved his hand. "Do you know why I chose Wu Zhenjun?"</p>

    <p>Wu Zhenjun: "???"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "Because even if all the teachers here worked together, they wouldn't be able to take down my suit of armor."</p>
