  <h1>Chapter 230 You've Succeeded in Getting My Attention! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It actually wasn't difficult to guess General Yi's identity, so if a normal student had been directly told by General Yi that he would accept him as a disciple on the spot, he would probably already have been jumping for joy by now.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling hadn't agreed at all, and the best thing he could do now was maintain his silence. Actually, he had also thought before that finding a shifu to use as a shield and hide his identity was a possibility... but General Yi was in the end an old senior in the cultivation world and one of the Ten Founding Generals who had shaken the entire Huaxiu nation â€” someone like this next to him would really be too eye-catching.</p>

    <p>All in all, Wang Ling concluded that his encounter with General Yi this time was a mistake... he should have been more careful.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, now that there was this type of old senior around, his plan to let loose in his search for the old devil had been completely ruined; no matter what, he couldn't expose his true strength.</p>

    <p>For the moment, he would wait and see what General Yi's next step would be.</p>

    <p>He sighed helplessly in his heart, and The Helplessness of the Immortal King BGM was already playing in his mind.</p>

    <p>His silence, however, didn't make the elder feel the slightest bit depressed; conversely, he became even more interested.</p>

    <p>General Yi's eyes, which were fixed on Wang Ling, seemed to glow with light. "I really didn't read you wrong. A normal student should already be jumping for joy if I told them that I would accept them as my disciple, right?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>General Yi: "You're very good! You've succeeded in getting my attention!"</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling already lacked the strength to ridicule this stereotypical scenario of a domineering CEO meeting his leading lady.</p>

    <p>General Yi stepped forward and placed a hand on Wang Ling's shoulder. "I don't think you know me well enough yet. Why don't we make some big headlines together? How about trying to improve our relationship? Don't worry, this won't hold up your participation in the survival contest. Since I like you, I'll bring you good luck. As long as you're willing to follow me, I guarantee it'll be 'winner winner chicken dinner' for you. It won't take too much of your time!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling chose once again to remain silent. "..."</p>

    <p>Now... what other options do I have?</p>

    <p>General Yi wasn't very tall, and actually, he almost looked like Jingke. In order to put his hand on Wang Ling's shoulder, his whole body had floated up a little.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was amazed that he could float in the air without the use of any magic artifacts. This was the realm level of a true immortal.</p>

    <p>"I'm going to catch an old enemy, and this time, I must catch him personally."</p>

    <p>Saying this, General Yi looked in one direction and said off-handedly, "Can you guess where he's hiding?"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>As Devil Emperor Gua Pi's old adversary, General Yi's understanding of the old devil could be said to be completely beyond Wang Ling's imagination.</p>

    <p>"Given what I know about that person's shitty personality, if I can't sense him on the small world's surface, there's only one other possibility..." General Yi looked intently at the ground under his feet.</p>

    <p>Three minutes later, with his bare hands, he had dug a hole which could hold at least three people.</p>

    <p>General Yi: "I'm guessing that he definitely escaped underground, and he's using the protection of a magic treasure to hide his aura."</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling looked at the hole at his feet with puzzlement in his eyes. So, why did it have to be bare-handed?</p>

    <p>"This guy is very cautious. If you use talismans like the earth-opening spell, the slightest fluctuation would draw his attention, so at this time, the best way is to do it bare-handed."</p>

    <p>Saying this, he jumped in lightly, then waved at Wang Ling outside the pit. "Come in; if you don't come in, how can I take you flying <sup>1</sup> ?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is sort of like the cocky
equivalent of 'taking someone
on a ride .. ')</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling gave the deep pit an apathetic look, and finally jumped in. After all, this was an invitation from an old senior, and it wouldn't be polite for him to refuse.</p>

    <p>General Yi was widely renowned, and to be honest, Wang Ling was very nervous.</p>

    <p>He felt that the most important thing for him now was to maintain this pace, behave like a junior as much as possible, and behave naturally...</p>

    <p>He couldn't let things progress to a "last resort" situation; he really didn't want to have to knock this old senior out and then forcefully erase his memory. If he really did that, he would definitely give himself away, given this senior's realm.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had barely landed in the pit when General Yi cast a spell to fill in the top of the hole, thoroughly turning their surroundings into a closed space.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was actually very curious about what this old senior was going to do next.</p>

    <p>General Yi released a light fluctuation of spirit energy and a sheen of protective immortal light covered his body, thoroughly illuminating the sealed space. He carefully felt for the old devil's aura, then gave a confident smile. "As I expected, this guy is underground. Moreover, he's now planning to absorb the vitality of the thousands of all you students here to flesh out the skeleton and reconstruct the corporeal body, thus resurrecting himself in this way."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was a little amazed. This sounded like it was probably the old devil's private plan, but General Yi actually knew so much about it?</p>

    <p>"Are you wondering why I even know this?" General Yi laughed.</p>

    <p>"Although he had avoided the state's most powerful efforts at seizing him back then, this old guy hadn't been careful while he was mucking around and had screwed up, sealing himself in the stone ghost mask. Because of a freak combination of factors, he had been able to use the mask to escape.</p>

    <p>"But it would never have occurred to him that when I hit him with my final Palm Sword strike back then, I planted a surveillance chip directly inside his soul. Hence, I've been spying on his movements over all these years..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"But unfortunately, we had just put forward a proposed plan to seize him when that old guy had actually cruelly and directly moved against those twenty delivery riders first. Because of that, in light of the corresponding harm to society, the capture plan was brought forward."</p>

    <p>He continued, "As for those innocent delivery employees, I've already personally called the insurance department to fast track the matter through the green channel so that we can reconstruct bodies for the souls of those delivery employees as soon as possible. As for the array for absorbing vitality which that old guy is preparing, actually, from the very beginning, it was never going to work.</p>

    <p>"The key to this array for absorbing vitality and reconstructing a body is the skeleton. But that Ancient Almighty's skeleton is actually fake."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>General Yi: "When our Huaxiu was founded back then, the thing we were best at was manufacturing knock-offs and quality fakes; as long as it could be done, we would do it."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"So the skeleton which that old guy found is actually a quality fake which I'd specially prepared for him... when I took it out to be used back then, I was almost criticized for it."</p>

    <p>General Yi sighed deeply. "Do you know the crystal sarcophagus in the National Palace of Huaxiu? Every year, schools probably organize for people to go and worship this old senior... in fact, the skeleton in the crystal sarcophagus is a quality fake. The real skeleton has already been hidden away."</p>

    <p>Crystal sarcophagus?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..." The skeleton in that crystal sarcophagus belonged to the founder of Huaxiu nation!</p>

    <p>General Yi: "Looking at your expression, you've probably already guessed it. That's right... I took the knock-off skeleton which that old guy is using now from that crystal sarcophagus."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was completely, utterly stunned. "..."</p>
