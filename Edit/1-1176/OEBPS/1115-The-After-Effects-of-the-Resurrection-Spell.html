  <h1>Chapter 1115 The After Effects of the Resurrection Spell</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The current situation was so serious that there was no time to waste. If the underground spirit veins were drained dry, the worst thing that could happen was the depletion of spirit qi on Earth, even if human cultivators wouldn't be completely ruined. The truly scary thing, however, was this secret plot to absorb the massive spirit veins.</p>

    <p>Back then, Dark Ancestor Xie Sanxiao had overestimated his capability to possess such power. He was unable to endure this tremendous energy, and ultimately suffered a backlash from the spirit veins and died a violent death.</p>

    <p>If this person behind the scenes, who had the ability to resurrect Dark Ancestor, was trying to use the power of Dark Ancestor and the Ancient Divine Clan to pry open the valve of the main vein and continue with Dark Ancestor's previous plan to absorb the veins... What would happen then?</p>

    <p>"Teacher, is there really someone out there who is able to absorb all the underground spirit veins on Earth..." President Qi was still doubtful on this point. Dark Ancestor had already cultivated a Sage Body back then, and such a terrifying physique was practically invulnerable. He was the founder who ranked top on the Dark Network, and who was also regarded as the strongest and most evil man on Earth.</p>

    <p>If even his body couldn't endure the pressure from the energy backlash, then who could?</p>

    <p>Huang Feng's expression darkened as he pondered this same question. As Chief Protector of the heavenly veins, Old Man Huang had been guarding Nine Dragon Mountain's main valve for thousands of years, and he knew the underground spirit veins even better than some members of the Ancient Divine Clan.</p>

    <p>"We can confirm now that Dark Ancestor is nothing more than a pawn in all this, and that the true purpose of the person behind the scenes is to open the main valve and suck dry Earth's heavenly veins. If he is truly able to absorb the underground spirit veins and store all of it inside his body... I'm afraid that his strength far surpasses anyone's on Earth, and he is a Venerated Immortal."</p>

    <p>"Venerated Immortal?"</p>

    <p>"The rumor is that the Venerated Immortal level is already the limit of Daoism; it is recorded that this realm is also known as Dao Ancestor. It remains to be seen, however, whether there is an even higher realm beyond that."</p>

    <p>"An even higher realm..." President Qi fell into deep thought. He believed that there was, but just didn't dare dwell too much on it; the foundation of cultivation theory had already long postulated that there was no end to cultivation.</p>

    <p>It was like a person's XP value — the stronger one grew and the higher one climbed, the more XP one needed to fill the XP bar. Whether one could break through the bottleneck or not depended on whether there was a spillover of XP after the bar was full.</p>

    <p>The key to cultivation lay in the spirit qi from nature. Thus, if all the spirit qi on Earth could theoretically be sucked up and stored inside the body, a cultivator could indeed break through in the blink of an eye and reach dizzying heights that ordinary people would only be able to dream of.</p>

    <p>But such a plan required a very strong body.</p>

    <p>In theory, a Sage Body was already the highest level that could be reached.</p>

    <p>The main reason Dark Ancestor failed back then was that he had thought himself invulnerable and he had been overconfident.</p>

    <p>Then, could this person behind the scenes really do it?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>A white-haired young man pushed open the main door of the abandoned factory and walked out.</p>

    <p>"Lord." Nightmare bowed and presented Dark Ancestor's skull with both hands.</p>

    <p>White Hair formed a seal with one hand and pointed at the skull with two fingers so that it floated into the air, before he let it drop.</p>

    <p>Nightmare knew that this was the Lord's special Resurrection Spell, but he had never seen this method before. He had read up on controlling spirits and bringing them back to life before, but there was always a huge price to pay when it came to trading lives.</p>

    <p>But Nightmare saw that the Resurrection Spell which White Hair used was actually completely different from the forbidden spells that he knew of. It didn't feel dark at all; instead, Nightmare felt infinite vigor and vitality when White Hair cast the spell.</p>

    <p>This aura, which glowed with life, made Nightmare feel carefree and relaxed from where he stood on the side. In the face of this spell, even he as a spectating soul felt snug, as if a spring breeze and rain was softly and quietly refreshing the world.</p>

    <p>It could only be said, as expected of Lord White Hair.</p>

    <p>Watching from the side, Nightmare couldn't hide his reverence for White Hair.</p>

    <p>After making sure that the skull was buried in the ground, White Hair injected spirit qi into it, and with a wave of his hand, a tender, green shoot immediately sprouted. "The Flower of Rebirth will bloom tomorrow. Stand guard over it, and wake me up when it blooms."</p>

    <p>Although it didn't look like an especially draining spell, White Hair did in fact still feel tired after using it.</p>

    <p>So the side effect of using the Resurrection Spell was just drowsiness...</p>

    <p>Nightmare was amazed.</p>

    <p>If it was just drowsiness, it was no different than having no side effects at all! This was the Resurrection Spell <em>ah</em>! If you could resurrect a person and just sleep after that... This ability was really shocking.</p>

    <p>Under Nightmare's astonished gaze, White Hair returned to his room.</p>

    <p>He walked over to a mirror in the room; he looked tired.</p>

    <p>This was the typical effect of using the Resurrection Secret Art.</p>

    <p>Staring at himself in the mirror, he yawned.</p>

    <p>He reached out to touch his face with complicated thoughts.</p>

    <p>Why did he look like that person...</p>

    <p>Yet that person never came to see him.</p>

    <p>White Hair stared despondently at his reflection.</p>

    <p>A moment later, a strand of hair drifted down into the wash basin in front of him.</p>

    <p>It had fallen from White Hair's head.</p>

    <p>The truth was that the after effect of using the Resurrection Spell wasn't just drowsiness, as Nightmare had thought.</p>

    <p>This was magic which could completely bring a person back to life, and in no way could it break the Heavenly Dao's principle of equivalent exchange — even White Hair had to pay a hefty price for it, but it wasn't in the form of a decreased life span or internal injury.</p>

    <p>Compared with the repercussions of other resurrection spells, White Hair's after effects were relatively mild — it was just that it was a little hard for him to accept it.</p>

    <p>He looked at his reflection and then at that fine strand of white hair which had fallen. He then very carefully picked it up with his fingers, then took out a needle and threaded the hair through it.</p>

    <p>White Hair knew very well what he was doing.</p>

    <p>But there was no other way.</p>

    <p>Because this was the after effect of the Resurrection Spell which he had to bear.</p>

    <p>Thus, he looked at his reflection, and removed the hair on his head to reveal a scalp that was as smooth, round and shiny as a soy egg...</p>

    <p>Then, he used the needle to firmly sew that hair back onto his wig.</p>

    <p>This was a wig made from his real hair...</p>

    <p>So, the after effect of the Resurrection Spell was hair loss.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, this hair loss was irreversible — once his hair fell out, it could never grow again...</p>
