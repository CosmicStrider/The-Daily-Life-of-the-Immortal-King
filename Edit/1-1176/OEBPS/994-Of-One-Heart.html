  <h1>Chapter 994 Of One Heart</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Fang Xing never expected the Holy Thunder Pill's Ancient Thunderbolt to be so powerful. In terms of combat strength, Fang Xing as a female was only at the True Immortal level, so she actually wouldn't be hard to deal with - the most difficult opponent here was still the fake Ling Zhenren in front of them.</p>

    <p>"Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch, I'll leave that fake Brother Ling to you; I'll handle this fake Brother Fang Xing." Seeing that the fake Fang Xing's first attack had been blocked, Lord Diulei instantly came up with a plan. Now that he was above True Immortal level, he was at the very least no less powerful, even if he might not be able to catch this fake Fang Xing alive.</p>

    <p>As for Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch, this was an intelligent clone that had been created from the real Brother Ling - the outcome of this fight had yet to be determined.</p>

    <p>The best, naturally, would be if they won, but if they lost, news of the intelligent clone's death in battle would instantly be transmitted to Brother Ling.</p>

    <p>"We'll do that then." Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch nodded.</p>

    <p>He knew very well that this Wang Ling in front of him was an imposter; as for the real one, even he as an intelligent clone was unable to detect Wang Ling's location.</p>

    <p>He was probably tangled up in some problem.</p>

    <p>At that moment, all of the Office of Strategic Deception were of one heart as they worked in tandem, and it was quite a scene.</p>

    <p>Various spatial magic arrays overlapped one another, and with the strength of Immortal Toya's small world over them and Luo Chuang and Dharmaraja providing cover, Zhuo Yi was able to successfully activate the defensive barrier.</p>

    <p>The barrier elements intertwined with one another in the air like fried dough twists to form a solid and inescapable net to trap the two imposters.</p>

    <p>Project Birdcage!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei never thought that the barrier blockade which he had gotten Wang Ling to set up around the Office of Strategic Deception would actually be used at this moment.</p>

    <p>"You're really interesting. Since I'm already here, I won't run. Actually, there's no need for you to go out of your way to set up this barrier." Chatterbox Wang Ling looked to the left and right, and seemed pretty satisfied with the current situation. "To go to this much trouble for us, it looks like Lord Diulei is really giving us face! But it's useless. All of you will die today."</p>

    <p>"You're overconfident." Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch's cold expression was in stark contrast to the flippant smile on the imposter's face.</p>

    <p>His long hair hung down to his waist and his appearance was similar to Wang Ling's; their features were exactly identical at the very beginning, but after Wang Ling gave him permission to modify his face, Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch could change his features at will.</p>

    <p>The one thing that couldn't be changed, however, were his eyes - they still had to be dead fish eyes.</p>

    <p>Anything else could be tossed out, except for the two most important things: dead fish eyes and crispy noodle snacks!</p>

    <p>Ling Zhenren wouldn't be complete without either one!</p>

    <p>In the next moment, Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch directly made a move.</p>

    <p>Without wasting time on unnecessary words, he suddenly moved in a streak of green light. He was in front of the imposter in a flash, and he raised one hand to slap the latter's cheek with pinpoint accuracy.</p>

    <p>"A petty trick."</p>

    <p>The imposter's reaction was just as quick. He leaned to one side and raised his arm to block the attack while his other hand swung out at the same time.</p>

    <p>Just like that, everyone became party to an astonishing scene...</p>

    <p>Who could have expected two top-class experts to start trading slaps with each other in front of everyone present, as if they were engaged in a fierce punch-up.</p>

    <p>But the most important point was that these weren't ordinary punches...</p>

    <p>Each of these slaps carried the tremendous power to level mountains and empty rivers. As they swung their palms, Immortal Toya's small world was promptly smashed to smithereens, ruined beyond recognition.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya's heart ached <em>ah </em>!</p>

    <p>Everything in the small world of his gourd had been bought with his own money!</p>

    <p>The large mountains! The small rivers! Even the vast ocean - all of it had cost him so much money!</p>

    <p>After cultivating to a particular level, people were often fond of embellishing their physical and mental attributes. Just like the manor-building system in some martial arts games, all the decorations in the small world could be bought with money, and Immortal Toya had put in a lot of painstaking effort into setting up this small world.</p>

    <p>Because different spirit medicinal plants grew in different environmental conditions, Immortal Toya could freely set up suitable greenhouses in the small world for them to grow in.</p>

    <p>But now, as Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch and the fake Ling Zhenren traded slaps, everything in the small world was being destroyed bit by bit...</p>

    <p>At the same time, the Holy Thunder Pill had stirred up bad weather in the small world, and divine thunderbolts rained down in large numbers, making for an apocalyptic scene.</p>

    <p>"Brother To, you don't have to be so sad, the Office will reimburse your losses later." Cailian Zhenren comforted him.</p>

    <p>"My losses are small... but where on earth is the real Ling Zhenren?" Immortal Toya puzzled over the one question that the entire Office of Strategic Deception also had at that moment.</p>

    <p>"We should know the answer soon," answered Cailian Zhenren.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi's aura wasn't present in the small world. Under Luo Chuang and Dharmaraja's cover earlier, Zhuo Yi had broken out of the conference room and activated the defensive barrier.</p>

    <p>Given Zhuo Yi's absence, he had probably gone to find out what was going on.</p>

    <p>On the other side, the fight between Lord Diulei and the fake Fang Xing was also quite intense.</p>

    <p>Still, it paled in comparison with the consequences of the slap-fight between the two people on this side.</p>

    <p>Student Fang Xing in his female form had a fiercer attack style than when in his usual state. Each move targeted a weak point â€” she fully intended to kill Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>"This fake Student Fang is so vicious." As he defended against the attack, Lord Diulei's gaze couldn't help being drawn to female Student Fang Xing's massive...</p>

    <p>This was the normal reaction of any man.</p>

    <p>There was a popular online game recently, where some livestreamers bought a visual focus device which could accurately pinpoint what a viewer's gaze was focused on.</p>

    <p>When male livestreamers turned on the monitoring device and clicked on photos of some beauties... the result was that the first thing these male livestreamers focused on was the chests...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei believed he wasn't a man of such perversions.</p>

    <p>Staring at a girl's chest was very rude and not gentlemanly at all!</p>

    <p>But in this fight now, he couldn't help casting glances at it.</p>

    <p>It was a huge distraction!</p>

    <p>What should he do?</p>

    <p>Was it because they were too big?</p>

    <p>No...</p>

    <p>Drawing in a deep breath, he forced himself to calm down.</p>

    <p>Even if this person in front of him was an imposter, the other party's appearance was still that of his good brother Student Fang Xing!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei had seen Fang Xing in his female form more times than anyone else here!</p>

    <p>How could he have vile thoughts about his own brother?!</p>

    <p>So, the only explanation was that this imposter had definitely done something to her chest!</p>

    <p>But unfortunately, Lord Diulei had no proof at the moment of this blatant and despicable behavior.</p>
