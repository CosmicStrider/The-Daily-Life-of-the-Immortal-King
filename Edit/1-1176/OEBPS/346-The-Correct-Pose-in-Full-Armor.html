  <h1>Chapter 346 The Correct Pose in Full Armor </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Finally, under Zhai Yin's resentful gaze, Wang Ming and Zhuo Yi entered the barrier one after another.</p>

    <p>The captain of the military police, whose helmet had been shattered with just one look, knelt on the ground with a heartbroken face, wanting to cry but with no tears to shed. Never mind the fact that the helmet was public property, it would be coming out of his salary since it had been damaged by external factors... the most crucial thing was, this malevolence was too scary!</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin gnashed her teeth as she watched Wang Ming and Zhuo Yi walk through the barrier. The air around her had already frozen, and the police officers and military police nearby stood very straight and at attention, completely not daring to speak.</p>

    <p>As Wang Ming had said, the general commander of the operation this time was in fact Zhuo Yi. Zhai Yin, who was from Magnificent Immortal and had fine military accomplishments under her belt, could never refute a superior's orders. This was also the most stifling point for her. She stared blankly as Wang Ming entered the barrier, while she was unable to do anything more. In her heart, she simply thought about completely ripping off the Magnificent Immortal symbol on her shoulder.</p>

    <p>However, she was the one who had applied to be Wang Ming's personal bodyguard. The old leader of her unit had agreed to give her three years. When the time came, she would still have to return to her original unit.</p>

    <p>Hence, she was still a member of Magnificent Immortal. As long as she bore this identity, she couldn't bring shame to her old unit; there was nothing she could do about this.</p>

    <p>After taking a deep breath, she did her best to calm down before she glanced out of the corner of her eye at the captain of the military police next to her. "Where is the barrier maker?"</p>

    <p>The military police captain: "Ah?"</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin: "Tell him to make a talisman for entering the barrier in ten minutes."</p>

    <p>The military police captain's expression instantly turned a little unsightly. "...This timeframe is a little difficult." Unless the maker had a cheat of some sort!</p>

    <p>Staring at the captain, Zhai Yin said with a deadly serious expression, "Ten minutes is the limit of my tolerance. If you can't do it and something happens inside to that idiot in the white coat, forget your military detachment, it'll be your entire division that will suffer."</p>

    <p>After throwing out these words, she looked straight ahead and said no more.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming's identity as the strongest brain was a state secret which not even Zhuo Yi knew about, let alone this bunch of civil police officers and military police involved in this operation, so Zhai Yin felt that it was actually meaningless to argue too much with them.</p>

    <p>Another aspect of it was that Wang Ming's rejection of her was a little contrary to her expectations.</p>

    <p>But she wasn't worried.</p>

    <p>She had three years.</p>

    <p>She felt that it should be more than enough time to have an effect on this dumbass.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Carrying the Heavenly Materials sword, which had been wrapped in layers of seals, Wang Ming walked with Zhuo Yi down Xiangyun Road. There wasn't a soul in sight.</p>

    <p>They were wearing aura concealment and invisibility Dao talismans, though Zhuo Yi didn't think these would be very useful since the military police who had gone in to grab Xiao Yuncheng had also been wearing them, and had still been thrown out one by one.</p>

    <p>The lights in some of the shops along the road were still on. Some stores hadn't been able to tidy up when they'd received the evacuation notice, and they hadn't been closed up.</p>

    <p>As they moved forward, Zhuo Yi looked closely at the wrapped spirit sword on Wang Ming's back and asked, "Lao Gudong, is this the Heavenly Materials sword which was seized from the Master of Immortal Mansion?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming nodded and couldn't help laughing. "I already wanted to say earlier, don't call me teacher. It sounds weird. Teacher Cang <sup>1</sup> is also a teacher."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is from 'Cang Jinkong,' the Chinese adaptation of Japanese AV star Aoi Sola's name ..)</dfn>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "I have another name, Wang Xiaoer. You can just call me Brother Er."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Then Brother Er, where are we going now?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming looked around. "We have to first look for a high vantage point."</p>

    <p>It had already been an hour and a half since the previous batch of military police that had been sent in to catch Xiao Yuncheng had failed. They had just been thrown out one by one, and no one had been injured. This might have been a lucky coincidence, but Wang Ming speculated that at the time, Xiao Yuncheng had still had his wits about him, and had yet to entirely lose his mind because of the fruit.</p>

    <p>But so much time had passed since then, and his mental state would have certainly deteriorated during that period.</p>

    <p>To be honest, Wang Ming couldn't be absolutely sure that this operation would be a success. Whether Xiao Yuncheng could be saved or not would depend on his own luck...</p>

    <p>Most of the buildings on Xiangyun Road had been built in the olden days. This was a pretty famous old street that only had a few tall buildings. Wang Ming and Zhuo Yi walked into the Tax Bureau on Xiangyun Road and directly took the elevator to the top floor.</p>

    <p>They reached the twenty-fifth floor and then climbed up a corridor to the peak. It wasn't too far, but Wang Ming was clearly a little breathless since he had the Heavenly Materials sword on his back.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi had weighed this sword in his hand before. The Master of Immortal Mansion had taken special care to select materials that were fairly light while forging the sword; even someone at the Foundation Establishment stage would be able to pick it up without any effort at all. When he saw how much effort it took Wang Ming, Zhuo Yi felt it was a little strange. "Brother Er, are you okay?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming stood on the rooftop, hands on his knees, and took a few gulps of air. "It's fine, it's fine... it's just that I haven't exercised in a very long time, so I'm a little wheezy. Usually I'm used to just hanging around in the lab."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "If I may ask, what is Brother Er's realm..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "Hm? Didn't Ling Ling tell you? I'm a normal person. Did you think I was stronger than him because I'm his older cousin?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Zhuo Yi took an arrow to the knee... But even if he was a normal person, Wang Ming's white coat from the Cultivation Academy of Science and the medal on his chest weren't fake, so on some level, Zhuo Yi felt that Wang Ming had to in fact be a witch.</p>

    <p>But the problem was that with their current lineup, it would be very hard to deal with a deranged Xiao Yuncheng!</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi felt his brain hurt a little.</p>

    <p>"I've studied the Heavenly Materials sword and it contains very special substances: It can adjust its ability according to the person wielding it. This sword actually quite suits me, but it's still a little heavy. However, it's enough for dealing with Xiao Yuncheng," Wang Ming said. "As long as I can give him a small cut, the operation can be considered a success."</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, Wang Ming took a sudden step back and pulled directly at the front of Zhuo Yi's gown, forcefully opening it to take a look inside.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was utterly petrified. "Bro... Brother Er, I'm straight!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "No kidding! So am I!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Then why..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "I'm checking to see if you're wearing the long johns Ling Ling gave you."</p>

    <p>"I see..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi understood instantly.</p>

    <p>"It's good that you're wearing them. Actually, the operation this time isn't dangerous."</p>

    <p>When he said this, Wang Ming also pulled out part of the long johns from inside his clothes as he looked at Zhuo Yi. "See? The same type!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>"If we really do stop Xiao Yuncheng, and in case, just in case, a spirit explosion actually happens, do you know what to do?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "???"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said, "What you need to do is to quickly tuck the top into the bottom, then stretch out the legs so that your exposed feet are also bundled up. Finally, pull the top of the long johns up to cover your entire head! You'll survive the disaster that way! This is the correct pose to assume in full long johns armor!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>
