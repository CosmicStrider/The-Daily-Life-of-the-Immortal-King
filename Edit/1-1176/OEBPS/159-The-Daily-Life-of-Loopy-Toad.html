  <h1>Chapter 159 The Daily Life of Er Ha </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was June 2nd on Thursday in the sixth week of the semester.</p>

    <p>This morning, Er Ha had once again pulled out its little notebook from under Wang Ling's bed to continue writing about its observations on humans. It had already been fully several months since it had thoroughly accepted the reality of its dog body.</p>

    <p>Er Ha was now quite good at human writing; even writing with claws, its handwriting was very neat. If it ever died again, it would definitely be forever remembered for its current calligraphy skills.</p>

    <p>As a literate dog, Er Ha felt that its current intellect was almost on par with that of a human university student; it could be called a prodigy among dogs.</p>

    <p>After learning to write an observation diary, it had recorded a lot of things, big and small.</p>

    <p>Apart from observations on human behavior, the diary also contained observations on certain events.</p>

    <p>Ever since the evil incident with Mother Wang being groped, Er Ha had realized how powerful the humans' network was. The rapid development of the Internet could enable humans to quickly band together online; a water army's commander-in-chief, moreover, could gather hundreds of thousands of people, whether to attack or to defend a particular issue.</p>

    <p>Er Ha felt that the ultimate reason for the demon race's failure to invade the human world all these years was related to this.</p>

    <p>The humans' information technology was really too advanced!</p>

    <p>As it was on the Internet, so it was in reality!</p>

    <p>This had been especially true in the fight against the invasion of demons from the Gate Between Worlds, when there had been nothing that the humans couldn't handle with a single phone call; once they had shared their location coordinates, cultivators nearby who were able to help had immediately rushed over. In contrast, the demon race still used the primitive method of sense perception to gather their forces; by the time reinforcements arrived on the front line, they had already lost!</p>

    <p>In a nutshell, there were still many things that the demon race could learn. Er Ha was now also able to operate cellphones and smartwatches; they were really too convenient! In contrast, the demon world was still using talismans to pass on information â€” this standard was really too low!</p>

    <p>Finished writing in its diary, Er Ha closed the notebook and pushed it back under the bed, then flung open the second-floor window and jumped down outside the villa.</p>

    <p>The weather forecast for Songhai city today was once again crazy. It wasn't as humid as they had said it would be on TV; conversely, there was a gentle breeze blowing, and the sun on Er Ha's green fur was refreshing.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling wasn't around, and Er Ha somehow felt in its heart that something was missing. It stared blankly down East Huang Road, and seemed a little lonely.</p>

    <p>Little Master Ling usually didn't like to talk, but after being with him day in and day out during this time, Er Ha basically understood what his personality was like. Honesty was the key with Little Master Ling; he didn't like stirring up trouble or other people trying to curry favor with him. If you compared Little Master Ling to a cat, the best thing to do was stroke his fur; if you caused trouble by ruffling it, he would fly into a fury.</p>

    <p>When Er Ha had first come to the Wang family home, it had been scared witless. After being here for so long, however, it had gradually relaxed. Sometimes, Wang Ling would even help brush its fur when he was free.</p>

    <p>Though it had become a dog, it hadn't slacked off in its cultivation.</p>

    <p>It had been thinking of a way to return to its prime in this body.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling brushing its fur was actually a great help!</p>

    <p>A boss at the level of an Immortal King personally brushing its fur... what kind of special treatment could this be? Moreover, Wang Ling's brushing had the effect of unblocking its meridians and stimulating its acupuncture points. After being brushed over so many times, Er Ha realized its waist was no longer sore and its legs no longer hurt, and its cultivation had become even more vigorous!</p>

    <p>Standing in the yard outside the villa, it went over the familiar "Demon King Heart Sutra." For the sutra to work, it required demon qi. But there were no sources of demon qi in the human world which Er Ha could draw on, so Wang Ling had helped it revise the "Demon King Heart Sutra" by replacing demon qi as its source with spirit qi.</p>

    <p>At the moment, as it used this cultivation technique, it could feel the spirit qi coalesce into overflowing existential insight.</p>

    <p>This was the way of Tao, which emulated the rules of the natural world...</p>

    <p>Er Ha had never experienced a feeling as profound as this before.</p>

    <p>It was now far stronger than it had ever been before; its current body was already on par with that of a Nascent Soul cultivator, and a common Core Formation cultivator wouldn't be able to do anything to it. After all, it was a demon king that had been renowned in the demon race and which back then could take on five Soul Formation cultivators at the same time!</p>

    <p>Standing in the sun, Er Ha slowly opened its eyes, and a bright blue light shone in their black depths... it could feel its demon king soul being gradually restored.</p>

    <p>At the same time, its sensitive sense of smell caught wind of the scent of strangers...</p>

    <p>Staring in one particular direction, it sensed the presence of strangers near the Wang family's small villa.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The Wang family's small villa was on the east side of East Huang Road; to the west was a commercial zone that had yet to be developed. According to the original plan, a large shopping mall of imported goods was supposed to come up here. Unfortunately, they hadn't even gotten halfway through the project before the boss had run off with his own sister-in-law. Hence, the building materials that been delivered here, such as the concrete, bricks, glass and timber, had been abandoned after all this time.</p>

    <p>The place where Ah You had died was right under an old locust tree in this commercial development zone.</p>

    <p>While the lot was usually empty, at this moment, two men in suits carrying sophisticated equipment on their backs had appeared.</p>

    <p>They were looking for signs of the body-dissolving fluid. Generally, a high quality body-dissolving fluid wouldn't leave any signs, but the body-dissolving fluid manufactured by Mo Immortal Castle contained a special kind of substance which could be detected by Mo Immortal Castle using a special gas detector.</p>

    <p>Each man held a cylindrical object, and a long tube was attached to one end. When they approached an old locust tree, the instrument instantly beeped in warning.</p>

    <p>One of them quickly turned on his wristwatch to report their finding to the Lady of the Castle. "Leader, we've found Ah You's location based on the coordinates where her soul brand disappeared. Furthermore... we detected traces of the body-dissolving fluid."</p>

    <p>On the other end of the phone, the Lady of the Castle asked solemnly, "What about Song Qingshu? Have you found his location?"</p>

    <p>From where they were, the two men quickly determined the location where Song Qingshu's soul brand had disappeared. Finally, they both looked at a building to the east. "Found it, Lady! It's a villa. Song Qingshu's soul brand vanished inside this villa!"</p>

    <p>"A... villa?"</p>

    <p>The Lady of the Castle was a little surprised. This was in barren countryside; there were actually people still living there?</p>

    <p>Her expression darkened slightly. "If that's the case, infiltrate this villa and investigate the situation!"</p>

    <p>The two men in suits hesitated for a bit, then said, "But, Lady, there's a dog at the entrance. Wouldn't it be too obvious?"</p>

    <p>"It's just a dog, just stew it for dog meat! It'll be something special to eat, isn't that wonderful?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
