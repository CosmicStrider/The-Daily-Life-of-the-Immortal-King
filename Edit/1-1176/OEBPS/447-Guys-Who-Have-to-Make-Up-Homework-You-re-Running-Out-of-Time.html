  <h1>Chapter 447 Guys Who Have to Make Up Homework, You're Running Out of Time! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>The large-scale blackout in the area and all types of electronic equipment malfunctioning were acts of God; as Zhuo Yi sped to the scene, he scrolled through online comments which were full of laments.</p>

    <p>There was no helping it; the government of Songhai city would have to provide unavoidably large compensation since the people couldn't suffer losses for no reason at all.</p>

    <p>But at the same time, Zhuo Yi was very curious to know what on earth had happened that could create such an impact.</p>

    <p>Deputy Director Zhong Lang and Zhuo Yi were sitting in the car as the master driver drove them closer and closer to their destination, which was the location Wang Ling had sent earlier. "Brother Zhuo, what's happened this time?"</p>

    <p>"Something big... You'll know once we get there," Zhuo Yi answered cryptically.</p>

    <p>But based on the signs, Zhuo Yi felt that it was most likely "a fight between immortals," and the man whom his shifu had defeated this time was probably a fairly remarkable person.</p>

    <p>Zhong Lang pursed his lips. "But logically speaking, this doesn't involve schools or their students... aren't we overstepping a boundary if we get involved like this? What if the other departments report us?"</p>

    <p>"Don't panic." Zhuo Yi shook his head and said, "First of all, this incident definitely has an impact on school students."</p>

    <p>Zhong Lang: "???"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "It's almost time for the midterm exams, and the kids have to do their revision but can't, given this widespread blackout! I actually already received a lot of complaints over the phone at the office earlier. As guardians who care about the learning and growth of the young sprouts of the motherland, we should verify what has happened for the sake of these kids!"</p>

    <p>Zhong Lang was taken aback. "..." He could follow this reasoning - but the point was that he had taken a look at the school forums and message boards just now, and all the children had been cheering. A lot of homework now had to be completed on the computer. What did a large-scale blackout mean?</p>

    <p>For a lot of students, their first reaction definitely wasn't regret that they couldn't complete their homework; instead, they rejoiced that they didn't have to hand in their homework the following day!</p>

    <p>"As for the complaints you mentioned..." Speaking up to this point, Zhuo Yi fell silent.</p>

    <p>He knew that the complaints Zhong Lang had brought up definitely existed.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi's rise in popularity had been meteoric because of his involvement in various major incidents in these two months.</p>

    <p>Major newspapers fell over themselves to report news on him and his relevant achievements. There would be an article almost every two days; basically, they never stopped.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, Zhuo Yi's position was related to education, which was a field that needed news brimming with positive energy and worthy role models. Nowadays, people scrambled to turn one or two of the better-looking older brothers and sisters in the various frontier defense troops, the army barracks, and the traffic police brigades into headlines or hot search topics, amply motivating citizens to join the army.</p>

    <p>In the same way, Secretary Dakang, the top leader in the Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools, thought that the field of education should also have a representative to be promoted and publicized as a spokesperson for education.</p>

    <p>And Zhuo Yi was a great frontman...</p>

    <p>What was more, he was actually pretty good-looking.</p>

    <p>Although he couldn't compare with film celebrities, he had a fair face and a scholarly air that was pure, natural and uncontaminated.</p>

    <p>In a government organizational structure like theirs, competition in the same field was very fierce, even if you weren't in the same department. When you were in the heart of things, there were always envious people who wanted to drag you down.</p>

    <p>But Zhuo Yi had always felt that something like reporting a complaint made sense since it could be considered a form of competitive behavior; it was just a little underhanded.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi sighed and then smiled. "There will definitely be complaints, but they will basically all be intercepted and won't be delivered."</p>

    <p>Zhong Lang: "Ah? But two days ago, I received a lot..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "That was arranged by Secretary Dakang. All the letters of complaint at the head office are ultimately forwarded to us. Secretary Dakang said that they're for internal consideration, and that this is also a process of self-learning and self-reflection."</p>

    <p>It turned out that this issue had already long been addressed!</p>

    <p>"..." Zhong Lang was suddenly enlightened.</p>

    <p>Three huge phrases appeared in his mind: "bigwig,""society," and "can't be provoked"...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The car slowly approached their destination. The mountain road was a little more remote, and while the driver had in fact already arrived at the approximate location, it still took a very long time to get there.</p>

    <p>Of course, the reason why they were ultimately able to find Lord Diulei and the others without a hitch was completely thanks to Er Ha's remarkable fluorescent green dog fur.</p>

    <p>In the pitch-black darkness, it looked green and lush from a distance, and was eye-catching and pleasing to look at.</p>

    <p>The car's headlights were pointed at the scene of the crime, which caused Er Ha's eyes to feel uncomfortable. It simply went directly to Lord Diulei and hid behind him; when it realized that there were other people besides Zhuo Yi who had come, it was instantly wary.</p>

    <p>"Hello, Senior Immortal!" Zhuo Yi and Zhong Lang got out of the car, and Zhuo Yi stepped forward to give his greetings.</p>

    <p>It was only at this moment that Zhong Lang realized that the tipster for this incident this time was actually the famous "Great Death-Courting Senior" of the cultivation circle; Zhong Lang now understood why this incident could create such a huge disturbance!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei responded with a fist salute. "Hello, Brother Zhuo Yi, we'll have to trouble you again this evening."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Senior Immortal, there's no need to be polite. I've long become used to it..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Zhong Lang: "..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "But Senior Immortal, is it possible for you to tell us what on earth happened?" Earlier, Wang Ling had just informed him about this location, so Zhuo Yi wasn't very clear on the exact details of the entire situation.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei pointed at the young man lying on the ground. "See this person? His origin is very unusual, but he is in no way inferior to the old devil as a first-class criminal. He has committed countless sins, has skills more profound than even the old devil's, and has a very deep relationship with General Yi."</p>

    <p>When Zhuo Yi and Zhong Lang heard this, their complexions turned pale.</p>

    <p>To be associated with the Ten Founding Generals - it was very clear how deep the waters ran behind all this.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the one thing that greatly surprised Zhuo Yi and Zhong Lang was that this young man's skills were more profound than the old devil's?</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi sucked in a sharp breath of air. "Senior Immortal... is this person at peak True Immortal level?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei nodded. "That's right, Furthermore, he has already cultivated a Heavenly Dao..."</p>

    <p>Although, your shifu confiscated it...</p>
