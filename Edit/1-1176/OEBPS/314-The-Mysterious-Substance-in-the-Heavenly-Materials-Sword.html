  <h1>Chapter 314 The Mysterious Substance in the Heavenly Materials Sword </h1>

  <div>

    <p>After they finished dinner, the two brothers went upstairs. Wang Ming flopped backward onto Wang Ling's bed and rolled around.</p>

    <p>The corners of his mouth twitching, Wang Ling looked at Wang Ming with his hands on his waist, feeling a little helpless. Bed Immortal and Pillow Immortal were more open to Wang Ming than to Lord Diulei since this guy had often slept on the same bed with Wang Ling when he had come over to play as a kid, so now they had already acknowledged Wang Ming as their second master.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, Wang Ling was really afraid of people who were the most shameless, and Wang Ming was a good example — not only was he an idiot, he was also quite shameless. The worst thing about it was that he wasn't aware of it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming sat on his bed and looked at Wang Ling with an amused face. "You know what?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "???"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "I like when you look angry and helpless like this."</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling's face swiftly darkened.</p>

    <p>His expression made Wang Ming turn chicken in a split-second, and he immediately cleared his throat. "All right... I won't tease you anymore. Let's be serious..." He knew that Wang Ling was now already close to blowing up, and if Wang Ming continued provoking him, he would probably set a second record as a member of Huaxiu's Cultivation Academy of Science.</p>

    <p>The first was that he was the youngest academician at the Cultivation Academy of Science in Huaxiu's history.</p>

    <p>The second one would be that he was the earliest Cultivation Academy of Science academician to die in Huaxiu's history.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was well aware that there were times when his teasing should stop where it should stop.</p>

    <p>He sat on the bed, folded his arms, and looked at Wang Ling. "That previous screenshot of an appraisal report is probably an analytical breakdown of the materials in a spirit sword, right? First, I want to hear about that sword's origins."</p>

    <p>If they hadn't completely settled things with Immortal Mansion, Wang Ling absolutely wouldn't have told Wang Ming anything as he didn't want to get Wang Ming directly involved. Knowing Wang Ming's character, if he knew about Immortal Mansion, he would very likely go and explore it for himself. The cultivation circle was very complicated, and it would be better for him not to muddy the waters.</p>

    <p>But Immortal Mansion had now been exterminated, so there shouldn't be anything to worry about... Besides, Zhai Yin was like a second skin now, protecting Wang Ming, so Wang Ling didn't think it should matter much.</p>

    <p>At the thought of this, Wang Ling released his spiritual senses to perceive the situation outside the villa — Zhai Yin hadn't returned to the car, and was still standing at attention and unmoving outside the door. It could be said that he was quite well-trained.</p>

    <p>Although the guy seemed strange, Wang Ling didn't particularly dislike him.</p>

    <p>He touched Wang Ming's forehead lightly with one finger and instantly relayed his memories of Immortal Mansion... Of course, he had gotten rid of the memory of him in women's clothes. If Wang Ming knew about this, it would make this guy happy for a year!</p>

    <p>Memories flooded into Wang Ming's mind like data, and he clicked his tongue in wonder. "Heh, if this trick could be used to cheat in exams... it'd be too damn convenient! For students who don't know the answer, 'mother never has to worry about my studies <sup>1</sup> '!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A reminder that this is an ad

    <p>Wang Ling laughed in his heart. "..." <em>You wish!</em></p>

    <p>In his opinion, it was better to rely on yourself during an exam than on others. And in class, almost no one would ask him to help them cheat...</p>

    <p>Actually, the level in the elite class was pretty much the same; trying to score high marks in a group of elites was the most difficult thing to do. Wang Ling's academic performance was forever average... His marks were always down the middle, so no one in class wanted to copy his answers.</p>

    <p>Just a while ago, Guo Hao had even given him the title of "Balanced Instructor" because of this.</p>

    <p>After Wang Ling had relayed his memories to Wang Ming, the other man still spent a full five minutes sorting them out, even if he was the strongest brain.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ming already knew that it was Wang Ling who had destroyed Immortal Mansion, he was still shocked when he learned the truth of the entire matter. An enormous dark force core organization, eliminated in one single day...</p>

    <p>According to the main thread in the memories, Wang Ling had surmised that Immortal Mansion had used the underground spirit vein and the holy Ice Crystal Array to construct a mirror space to hide its stronghold. Then, he had blasted through the spatial wall, was summoned to the flat top at Yuntai Pavilion, had had his identity exposed in order to save Dharmaraja and the others, directly knocked out all the inner sect female disciples with spiritual pressure, dealt with a female elder, dealt with a silver unicorn, and finally dealt with the Master of Immortal Mansion...</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was a little speechless. The things that had happened this last Sunday were more than what some people experienced in an entire year! If this was a true-blue cultivation novel, the one-on-one confrontation between these two cultivators could fill several days and nights' worth of writing.</p>

    <p>But after learning the whole story, Wang Ming felt relieved. "If this is the case, the appearance of this substance inside the sword is just a coincidence."</p>

    <p>"?" Wang Ling didn't understand what he meant, and was slightly at a loss.</p>

    <p>"After looking at the appraisal report in that screenshot, I realized that it had the same element which is contained in the Dao talisman seal I made for you. Furthermore, this is the key ingredient... This is the key substance in the Dao talisman seal which suppresses your aura."</p>

    <p>He looked up at Wang Ling and explained very seriously, "When I first saw this appraisal report of the materials in the sword, I thought that someone had discovered the secret of this substance. But given the current outcome, it's probably just a coincidence. I'm guessing that the Master of Immortal Mansion himself didn't know about this thing when he made the sword."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming couldn't help but sigh. "You don't know how hard it is to refine this thing... Even with the most sophisticated equipment in our research institute, I can only refine a few micrograms of it every year. The Master of Immortal Mansion incorporated a lot of materials into this sword. If it's a coincidence, then there is a real possibility that this material can be reproduced."</p>

    <p>After Wang Ming's explanation, Wang Ling was suddenly enlightened.</p>

    <p>He roughly knew now why his Great Purification Spell hadn't worked on Fang Xing. It was most likely because of the resistance effect of this trace substance. It was also because of this strange thing lurking in Fang Xing's body that he had yet to wake up.</p>

    <p>"Currently, the only person who knows about this thing's existence apart from me is you; there shouldn't be anyone else. I thought it had leaked out at first, which almost scared me to death..." Wang Ming heaved a sigh and fell back on the bed.</p>

    <p>Did this thing have no scientific name?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at Wang Ling, unable to resist asking him telepathically.</p>

    <p>"A scientific name... I was the one who discovered this thing in the first place, and I'm not prepared to announce it publicly. Why does it need a scientific name?" said Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"But I did name it myself." Wang Ming grinned. "I call it Anti-Wang Ling Matter!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..." The name could be said to be rather simple and crude, but the substance's unique quality lay in the fact that it had a restraining effect on just him... hence, there was completely nothing wrong with this name.</p>

    <p>"That sword contains traces of this element, but it's far less than the amount in your Dao talisman seal. This thing dissipates quickly, you don't have to worry about it. Your friend will wake up in two days after the substance breaks down on its own inside his body."</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, Wang Ming suddenly sat up straight on the bed and stared at Wang Ling solemnly. "But Lingzi... have you realized it yet?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "?"</p>

    <p>Cupping his chin with both hands, Wang Ming showed a rare, serious face. "I think your body is getting used to this substance..."</p>
