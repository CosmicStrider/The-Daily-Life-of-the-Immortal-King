  <h1>Chapter 1068 Heavenly Dao Tracking List</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After accepting the price of the equivalent exchange and upon learning of Wang Ling's demand, the little golden man promptly submitted an application to the Heavenly Dao Governing Committee to ask Space Heavenly Dao and Time Heavenly Dao of the six main Heavenly Dao to search the world for the remaining nine people who had eaten frozen dumplings.</p>

    <p>At a certain time and a certain place - this sort of search operation could only be carried out through Space Heavenly Dao and Time Heavenly Dao joining forces.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling was the only one who had this sort of status to order the main Heavenly Dao around. Otherwise, even Gu Shunzhi, the keeper of order who maintained peace in the universe, had to follow procedure and go through the review and approval process.</p>

    <p>A few minutes later, the search was over.</p>

    <p>The little golden man held out his hand and a golden scroll appeared. The names, contact details, and addresses of the nine people were clearly written on the golden scroll. Furthermore, it was written in very fine Heavenly Dao script, which ordinary people couldn't read.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling had an innate learning mechanism, and hadn't needed to learn the Heavenly Dao script - the language had developed naturally in his brain, like a mother tongue. From the moment he was born, his vocabulary continued to increase. By the time Wang Ling was ten years old, he had mastered the language of Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>Looking at the nine names, Wang Ling sighed with relief. All of them were in Songhai city; the packets of frozen dumplings that had been contaminated with the aura of Great Dao by Shadow Dao hadn't spread.</p>

    <p>The next step was to put a seal on these nine people one by one.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at the name: Li Daiwei.</p>

    <p>According to the data, this was an ordinary middle-aged man. His initial realm wasn't high, as he was merely at the Foundation Establishment stage, but he had a slightly creepy job.</p>

    <p>He was an undertaker, who mainly helped put makeup on the dead.</p>

    <p>And this was the only person on the list who lived in the outskirts.</p>

    <p>Moreover, this person seemed to live quite close to the Wang family's small villa. Wang Ling decided to start with this man.</p>

    <p>Of course, to avoid any mishaps, Wang Ling also sent the rest of the names to Lord Diulei and requested that he send teams to tail them.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought that logically speaking, things would be fine as long as he put a seal on these people.</p>

    <p>But what happened next took Wang Ling by surprise...</p>

    <p>The power which his unborn sister wielded was far stronger than Wang Ling imagined.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>About eight hundred li east of the Wang family's small villa was a cemetery called Songhe Park. Those buried here were basically the wealthy. Graves were very expensive nowadays, and could cost as much as a house. A top-notch grave could cost hundreds of thousands of yuan per square foot; people weren't equal even in death.</p>

    <p>A lot of people turned pale when chatting about embalming as a job. Many undertakers probably had this experience when they went on blind dates: the conversation would start off well at first, but when it came to work, the other party would in the end do whatever they could to run away.</p>

    <p>Handling the dead was seen by many as a taboo. Some of it had to do with small-town folk customs, while a large part of it was actually superstition. Any profession should be respected. Since undertakers existed, that clearly meant that there was a need for them. Since society needed them, why turn pale when talking about embalming?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling cast a teleportation spell and appeared at the gate of the cemetery with Er Ha.</p>

    <p>Er Ha had nothing to do at home, so had asked to come out with Wang Ling for a breath of fresh air...</p>

    <p>From the main entrance, Wang Ling could see the whole cemetery. The site was covered in green and the refreshing scent of flowers filled the air. All kinds of flowers and trees were planted in neat and tidy order: Chinese junipers, dragon junipers, orange jasmines, chrysanthemums, red spider lilies...</p>

    <p>These flowers and trees were very meaningful, and symbolized mourning and dignity. They could deter the souls of those who had died unexpected deaths and dwelled in the cemetery.</p>

    <p>Standing at the gate, Wang Ling could see a huge six-legged censer that was giving off incense in the distance, on a stone step at the end of a path. Small flames flickered under the censer, and the smoke in the air was as white as snow, so pure that it seemed to glow with radiance.</p>

    <p>This was the cemetery's incense burner.</p>

    <p>To promote environmental protection, after those who came to pay respects to their loved ones were done, they could place the joss paper they had prepared in the opening at the bottom of the general incense burner. Then, the incense burner would decompose the paper through a special process and turn it into environmentally friendly smoke that would be quickly absorbed by the surrounding trees.</p>

    <p>The smoke took the visual form of a dragon flying into the sky. Thus, people could see this swirling smoke from a distance, which looked like a path connected to the heavens that carried with it the longing for the dead.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling cast an invisibility spell and took Er Ha with him. Er Ha looked around curiously as they walked.</p>

    <p>Thanks to their strong power of sight, one man and one dog could see plenty of spirits floating around in the cemetery as the two of them walked down the main path. These spirits had been buried recently, and were waiting to ascend to Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>The Heavenly Dao Governing Committee had a procedure that had to be followed, so the spirits could only wait.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling had cast the Great Invisibility Spell and wasn't visible to ordinary people, the spirits could see him. The dead and ordinary people saw things differently. Although the spirits couldn't see Wang Ling's and Er Ha's faces clearly, the two's presence could still be felt and their silhouettes were distinct.</p>

    <p>"Mom, mom, it looks like someone's here."</p>

    <p>"From the shapes, it should be a person and a dog... Don't go over, it's dangerous. They don't seem to have any tombstones, they're probably wandering ghosts."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>So these spirits thought they were spirits too...</p>

    <p>"But, mom, they don't look like bad guys. Can I go play with the dog?"</p>

    <p>"No, daughter, we're going to go up to heaven very soon, and we mustn't complicate things here. Our cemetery hasn't been very peaceful lately... A very powerful malicious spirit came. I'm afraid these two wandering ghosts might catch its attention..." The woman cowered as she spoke. Pulling her daughter by the hand, she went to hide at her tombstone.</p>

    <p>Tombstones had barrier seals and acted as safe zones. As long as spirits hid in the vicinity, a regular malicious ghost wouldn't be able to get close at all.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was initially going to ignore the mother and daughter and walk right past, but when he heard that the cemetery wasn't peaceful, he was suddenly curious.</p>

    <p>Er Ha understood its master's thoughts, and it directly led the way through the cemetery until they ended up at the tombstones of the mother and daughter.</p>

    <p>"Mom... can they see us?" The little girl was a little nervous.</p>

    <p>"Of course we can! And we can hear you, too!" Er Ha looked at the girl and said, "Little girl, what's been happening in this cemetery recently? If you know something, please tell me. Otherwise, when you go up to heaven, I'll have the Heavenly Dao Governing Committee give you homework! Don't think that just because you've turned into a spirit, you don't have to do homework anymore!"</p>

    <p>When the little girl heard this, she burst into tears.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
