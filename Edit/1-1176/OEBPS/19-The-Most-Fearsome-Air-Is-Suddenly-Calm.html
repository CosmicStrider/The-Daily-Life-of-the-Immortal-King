  <h1>Chapter 19 The Most Fearsome Air Is Suddenly Calm </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling had always been very afraid of meeting Old Li.</p>

    <p>If he told Old Li his true age, he would be treated as a monster.</p>

    <p>But if he didn't clarify the matter, and this misunderstanding persisted... wouldn't this make him a pervert?!</p>

    <p>Based on Old Li's years of experience, there were only two reasons that a big shot who had already surpassed his realm of knowledge would still attend this mediocre high school.</p>

    <p>Reason one: to "move around incognito" in order to satisfy some particular desire.</p>

    <p>Reason two: to chase a passionate love...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had only been in the Seven Stars Cultivation Special Forces for a few days, but he was so low-key that even when everyone in the team had taken turns ridiculing him, he hadn't said anything. Therefore, Old Li straightaway ruled out the first reason.</p>

    <p>Then he thought of the rumors in those first two days about what had happened to Wang Ling and Sun Rong at the Xiao Family Compound...</p>

    <p>It was as if the clouds had suddenly cleared, and in a flash of understanding, he saw the light.</p>

    <p>He stared at Wang Ling as if he had seen through everything. "May I ask, Consultant Wang, were the Shadow Stream killers who intended to kidnap Miss Sun Rong at the Xiao Family Compound several days ago, also..."</p>

    <p>"Mm." Wang Ling's answer was very straightforward. For someone who knew his true strength, it wasn't surprising for Old Li to come to this conclusion. Hence, Wang Ling had nothing to hide.</p>

    <p>"Then may I ask, your relationship with Student Sun Rong..."</p>

    <p>"Just classmates."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was as reticent as usual.</p>

    <p>Old Li goggled at him, an astonished expression on his face. He hadn't come here to satisfy some special desire or to experience the vigors of youth... damn! Was it possible that Consultant Wang didn't like women?</p>

    <p>"..." Right now, Wang Ling really wanted to strangle this old man with his wild imagination.</p>

    <p>Exactly why would someone who had retired as Captain of the Seven Stars Cultivation Special Forces condescend to becoming a school guard at a mediocre school?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was very curious about this. Given Old Li's qualifications, even after retirement, he could have gotten special consideration, and be promoted as a commanding officer to work behind the scenes. Wang Ling thought that such a position, where Old Li wouldn't need to show his face for the whole day, and just needed to pass idle judgment from behind the scenes, suited his character very well.</p>

    <p>"You have an internal injury?" Very quickly, Wang Ling perceived an abnormality about Old Li.</p>

    <p>Even without the use of the Heavenly Eye, Wang Ling's eyes were a thousand times more powerful than the most advanced instruments available today.</p>

    <p>Old Li smiled bitterly. "After returning from the Gate Between Worlds and regaining consciousness, because of a small incident, my internal injuries were aggravated, and I haven't been very agile since."</p>

    <p>"What happened?" Wang Ling raised an eyebrow, and spoke telepathically out of habit.</p>

    <p>"After I woke up, I was anxious to find Consultant Wang, and I wanted to thank you in person. The first time, I hadn't even reached the corridor before the nurse who had come to check on me used a Shadow Binding Spell to haul me back."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"The second time, I had just walked out the hospital's main entrance when my old boss caught me. Without saying a word, he used a Flying Dragon Spell on me. I struggled mightily, almost at the cost of him breaking my balls, but in the end I was caught and taken back to recuperate."</p>

    <p>"..." Fuck, was there any need to be so desperate?!</p>

    <p>"The third time, I was going to leave the hospital by flying my sword out the window, but I forgot to break the hospital's seal on spirit energy, so right from the start I couldn't use my spirit energy, and I fell straight down from the thirtieth floor." Old Li sighed with deep pain and bitterness. "As a result, I haven't been able to fully recover until now."</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling saw that the internal injury was in Old Li's skull, caused by the environment in the Gate Between Worlds back then. Even though it had already been treated, it hadn't been able to withstand the repeated sufferings he had endured â€” indeed, it would have been absurd if it could be healed after all that!</p>

    <p>Listening to Old Li talk about himself, Wang Ling heaved a deep sigh for this former Captain of the Special Forces. Who would have thought that after coming back, his brain would have degenerated from the toxins in the Gate Between Worlds...</p>

    <p>With Old Li's current intelligence, forget battle command, he could probably only play pair-matching puzzle games.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling took a deep breath, and a purification light formed in his palm.</p>

    <p>Among the Three Thousand Great Spells, the Great Purification Spell could purify all evil. The primary stage of the spell had a strong expulsion effect on poisons and toxins, while the advanced stage could even purify the heart of evil desires.</p>

    <p>Given his current proficiency with this spell, Wang Ling believed he could directly transform those perverts who liked to grope women in public into ascetic Shaolin monks...</p>

    <p>When he saw the spirit light in Wang Ling's hand, Old Li was dumbfounded!</p>

    <p>It was a spell he had never seen before. The elaborate talisman light and pure accumulation of spirit energy was enough to prove Wang Ling's proficiency in it.</p>

    <p>His eyes were completely fixed on the spell as he praised Wang Ling endlessly. "That's just like Consultant Wang, you're as strong as always!" He felt that the one hundred magic spells that he had managed to accumulate over so many years were just a drop in the ocean that was Wang Ling's collection of spells!</p>

    <p>"This light will heal your internal wounds completely." Wang Ling didn't say much before he placed his palm on Old Li's forehead. The warm talisman light was slowly absorbed.</p>

    <p>Old Li felt something cool permeate his brain, and the toxins that had been entrenched inside for many years dissolved little by little with the spirit light.</p>

    <p>Finally, the poison was completely drawn out, and Wang Ling rolled the black qi around with his fingers to mix it with the purification light, burning all of it to ash.</p>

    <p>"Cool!" Old Li said in a nauseating, girlish-sounding voice.</p>

    <p>After the toxins that had existed in his body for three whole years had been dispelled, he felt a hundred years younger! Even his body was much lighter; most obvious of all, he realized that his spirit energy was flowing smoothly like water, and his spiritual meridians were no longer clogged.</p>

    <p>"Consultant Wang, you are truly powerful!" Old Li admired Wang Ling even more. Over the last few years, he had seen so many famous doctors, but none of them had been able to force the stubborn toxins out. Even advanced technology and the best panaceas couldn't compare with the miraculous effects of Wang Ling's spell.</p>

    <p>"I'm not a consultant. From now on in school, call me Student Wang Ling," Wang Ling corrected him.</p>

    <p>"Very well, Student Wang Ling..." How could Old Li not listen to the Great Master? Old Li directed his gaze to the body on the ground, and he asked, "Then what should we do with Xu Ying's body?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't say anything, and only looked back at Old Li.</p>

    <p>Now that the toxins had been expelled from his brain, clear-headed Old Li immediately understood the intention in Wang Ling's eyes.</p>

    <p>His meaning couldn't be any clearer; he was obviously leaving it to Old Li to handle.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, if news leaked out that Wang Ling as a student had killed a Shadow Stream Red Ribbon killer, he would probably be in the headlines for the next few months. This completely disagreed with Wang Ling's low-key character.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't forcibly erase Old Li's memory this time, after thinking it over. As a shield, this person standing under a tree on the school ground would in fact prove useful in helping conceal his identity.</p>

    <p>As for the misunderstanding regarding his age, Wang Ling felt that since the mistake had already been made, he might as well make the most of it...</p>

    <p>A breeze brushed past them, and Wang Ling's ears twitched as he heard footsteps nearby. It was time for him to return now that the problem had been dealt with.</p>

    <p>It had been too long since he had fully used the Great Separation Spell... Wang Ling couldn't be sure how much longer his clone in the classroom would last.</p>

    <p><em>Poof </em>. In an instant, Wang Ling's figure blinked out, vanishing in the wind.</p>

    <p>Seeing Wang Ling vanish abruptly, Old Li sighed at the gap in their levels, and muttered to himself: too inferior... too inferior...</p>

    <p>Whatever reason the other party had for coming to school, with such a Great Master at his side, Old Li felt that he couldn't waste this great opportunity... he had to find a way to make him his teacher!</p>

    <p>While Old Li was sighing, a group of school guards rushed to the scene, as Wang Ling had anticipated.</p>

    <p>When the group saw the man standing in the shade of the tree, as well as the body lying on the ground, they were all greatly shocked. "Who is it?"</p>

    <p>Old Li slowly strolled out from under the tree with his hands behind his back and wearing the strict countenance of a veteran officer. "It's me!"</p>

    <p>"It's you, Lord Chief!"</p>

    <p>The school guards immediately lined up in a row and saluted respectfully.</p>

    <p>"Mm." Old Li nodded and calmly pointed to the body on the ground. "I just eliminated a Shadow Stream killer, help bury the body..."</p>

    <p>After giving this order, Old Li left straightaway without looking back.</p>

    <p>The school guards came forward to take a look, and couldn't help swearing; this death was too horrible, even the bones had broken down to nothing... the body had simply become nothing more than human slag!</p>
