  <h1>Chapter 1121 Kuxuan, Who Has No Integrity</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Privately, Wang Ling had thought that this was just a simple simulation game, but didn't expect the boss at every checkpoint to actually be a "meme" character...</p>

    <p>Take this Brother Mink as an example - this character design was undoubtedly based on a once-famous rapper in particular who was the big brother of the rap crew Green Grass Association. As for the dumpling skin hidden weapon, Wang Ling just couldn't mock this design anymore, since the main reason why the public shunned this person after his popularity exploded was that he had made a cuckold of his own big brother by hooking up with his sister-in-law<sup>1</sup>.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A reference to rapper PG One
and his scandal with married
actress Li Xiaolu.)</dfn>

    <p>There was a saying: "There is nothing more delicious than dumplings, and nothing better to play with than...<sup>2</sup>...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(The full phrase is "There is
nothing more delicious than
dumplings, and nothing
better to play with than a
sister-in-law.")</dfn>

    <p>At this point, Wang Ling couldn't bear thinking about it anymore as his heart collapsed - this game was simply poisonous!</p>

    <p>But if it was just a distraction from a hidden weapon coupled with a physical attack, the threat which this Brother Mink posed wasn't much. Wang Ling originally thought that Brother Mink would more likely attack with an advanced sound wave spell and body technique. In the end, this demonstrated that the second checkpoint wasn't too difficult an obstacle, and that the level of difficulty increased incrementally with each subsequent checkpoint; it was Wang Ling's fault for overthinking it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling dodged the dumpling skins which Brother Mink shot out. His heart and eyes were one as he inadvertently made tremendous use of the dynamic vision of his King's Eye. As he evaded this hidden weapon, the dumpling skins actually fell into his own hands.</p>

    <p>Then, he abruptly flung the dumpling skins back. They were as fast as flywheels, and cut into Brother Mink's belly.</p>

    <p>Brother Mink fell to the ground in pain, and declared before he died, "If I had the chance to do it again... I want to tell my big brother... sister-in-law and I are truly in love..."</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>He marveled at how realistic this game design was. While there were massive flaws in the character design and functionality, on the whole, it recreated the sense of disgust toward the character.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had always been against the idea of a third party in a marriage. Fortunately, Father Wang had already proven with practical actions that he was a good family man. At the very least, when Mother Wang wanted to buy something, Father Wang had never hesitated to get it.</p>

    <p>Like with this pregnancy, Father Wang knew that before and after Wang Nuan was born, it would be a new, major household expenditure. Thus, he worked especially hard to push out chapter updates during this period of time in order to earn a little bit of money for milk powder and diapers. It was as if he had become a tentacle monster as he churned out two hundred thousand characters every day, completely unlike an author like Kuxuan, who had no moral integrity.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling also didn't know how the author named Kuxuan still had the guts to base Father Wang on himself... In terms of diligence alone, they weren't on the same level at all!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The training ended early today, mainly because San Yuan realized that this batch of Number 60 High students were too outstanding. He had only prepared just so much for today. The body technique training was initially supposed to be for tomorrow. Once everyone cleared the training, San Yuan suddenly discovered that it seemed he already had nothing else to teach them.</p>

    <p>San Yuan sat upright on the sofa in Headmaster Chen's office. He still kept his strict habits from the army; he sat half-perched forward on the sofa, his waist very straight. The way he sat, he looked very well-behaved, with his hands resting lightly on his knees.</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen gave San Yuan a cup of tea. San Yuan turned a gear on his iron mask, and a straw extended out from the center...</p>

    <p>"What kind of design is this..." asked Headmaster Chen curiously.</p>

    <p>San Yuan: "Sorry, I got used to it in the army. The straw is custom made and has a built-in filter. It's useful when we're looking for water in the wild."</p>

    <p>Because he wore a mask all year round, San Yuan was already accustomed to the mask's various applications. Even now, he still kept it on when drinking tea. Even when he ate, he didn't have to take off his mask because of the Pore Devouring Spell.</p>

    <p>The truth was that the masks which Magnificent Immortal specially manufactured for its special forces actually had many miraculous uses, and even Headmaster Chen wasn't clear on what they were.</p>

    <p>The filtering and purifying functions, for example, actually weren't rare, and regular masks also had them.</p>

    <p>"San Yuan, we've been friends for years. Tell me the truth: After teaching this batch of students from our Number 60 High this time, what do you think of them?" Headmaster Chen asked for San Yuan's advice very earnestly. He had invited San Yuan over because he knew the latter wouldn't act politely with him. This man said things as they were - in whatever he said or did, he was frank and straightforward.</p>

    <p>"Do you want the truth?" San Yuan looked at him expressionlessly.</p>

    <p>"Of course." Headmaster Chen smiled as he anticipated San Yuan's criticism.</p>

    <p>If San Yuan could pick out some issues before the national competition, then Number 60 High at least had some hope of making it into the top 30 in the country...</p>

    <p>After all, there would be 102 high schools this time, with all kinds of formidable prodigies. To make it into the top 30 in the country would already be very amazing. Headmaster Chen didn't dare ask for a higher ranking.</p>

    <p>Getting into the top ten would indeed be a little tough for these kids.</p>

    <p>But it was fine to set a small, achievable goal.</p>

    <p>However, San Yuan's answer took Headmaster Chen completely by surprise.</p>

    <p>San Yuan: "They're all outstanding kids... Judging from the lesson today, at least, I feel that their overall strength isn't that much different from the kids in city key high schools. They have quick reflexes and wits, and share an unusually good rapport."</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen was blank. "Rapport?"</p>

    <p>"That's right, they have very good rapport." San Yuan said, "I had them do the body technique test in separate mental spaces to prevent them from peeking, cheating, or discussing strategies. Even then, the transfer students and the old ones were actually unusually coordinated. Especially that Student Wang Ling - his mental connection with the other transfer students is unimaginable."</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen: "???"</p>

    <p>San Yuan: "Wang Ling is very quick-witted. Whenever he cleared a checkpoint, the transfer students would also clear them at almost the same time; moreover, they used the same method. If it wasn't for the fact that the mental spaces are separate, I would suspect that they have the same brain structure... These kids could actually come up with the same strategy to clear the checkpoint at the same time under the same conditions. I've never seen such tacit coordination in my entire life."</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen: "..."</p>

    <p>San Yuan: "If this coordination can be put to use in the competition, Number 60 High should rank very high this time."</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen: "What is your prediction?"</p>

    <p>San Yuan: "At least in the top eight."</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen wiped at his sweat. "You can really dream... I will already be satisfied if they can rank in the top 30."</p>

    <p>San Yuan: "There's nothing wrong with having a little more confidence. Even FPX<sup>3</sup> reached the LoL finals this year. You should have a little more confidence."</p>
