  <h1>Chapter 649 Idol Power!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>That had been an awkward but nonetheless polite smile.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, enlightening his room door had now become an urgent priority. Wang Ling's heart felt a little suffocated. Furthermore, he felt that his own mother always seemed to misunderstand him; how could he be that sort of person? As the Numinous Mother who had once been a novelist and had successfully raised two epic-level killers, shouldn't she be clear on the fact that there weren't any heroines for now?!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed with despair in his heart. He had decided - he would enlighten the door tonight!</p>

    <p>At his slightly bitter expression, Jin Shi and Yin Shi who were standing attentively outside the door couldn't help trembling. For some reason, they felt a chill behind them... and a pair of frightful dead fish eyes inexplicably appeared in their hearts!</p>

    <p>Low pressure hovered in the room... on one side, Er Ha and Xiao Yin shivered and didn't dare speak. It was as if the atmosphere had frozen.</p>

    <p>Er Ha didn't know what it felt like for Little Master Ling to be misunderstood by his own mother time and time again, but based purely on what it could see, Er Ha guessed that this door wouldn't be able to escape its fate of being enlightened tonight.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin didn't dare speak, not even telepathically, because he knew that Master would still be able to hear him.</p>

    <p>He couldn't resist using the chat app on his phone to ask Er Ha as he typed, "What's the matter with Master?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha quickly replied, "He was struck a blow, and I bet the door is going to be enlightened."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "So powerful?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Our little master can enlighten anything. This door will probably be very strong after it's enlightened since it was made from a special material to begin with."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "What material?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "I think it's called vibranium? I heard it was an abandoned building material which our little master picked up from the construction site opposite us when he was little. Besides vibranium, I heard there's another metal called adamantium in it!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, Songhai First Prison.</p>

    <p>Elder Zuo Wu had been transported here last night. In addition to Mr Lu, he was the second top-level member of the Demon Hunters Association to be arrested by the authorities. Of course, there was no news of this in the media for fear of information leaks.</p>

    <p>President Bai had personally seen Elder Zuo Wu commit suicide. To his mind, Elder Zuo Wu was already dead, which made protecting Elder Zuo Wu now all the more important. As a human, Elder Zuo Wu knew far more about the Demon Hunters Association than Mr Lu.</p>

    <p>While he was being interrogated, Elder Zuo Wu's expression still seemed a little desolate. In fact, he himself didn't know whether what he knew about the Demon Hunters Association was everything. After all, before he was arrested, an "Elder Ji Xing" whom he had never seen before had appeared beside President Bai.</p>

    <p>As part of the first group of old members who followed President Bai, Elder Zuo Wu knew the president's personality too well; he was someone who definitely wouldn't reveal his entire hand. He wouldn't reveal all his information so easily, and there were previous cases where he had deliberately given false information.</p>

    <p>There had once been an elder of the Demon Hunters Association who had wanted to report President Bai, but had been led around by the nose by President Bai instead as he was trapped by false information.</p>

    <p>Then was everything he knew now true or not?</p>

    <p>Was there false information in the mix?</p>

    <p>As to all of this... Elder Zuo Wu had no idea.</p>

    <p>In the interrogation room, Elder Zuo Wu's eyes were lowered and his expression shuttered. He looked like that bunch of bangzi after they were beaten silly by Huaxiu's national gaming team. The prison officers in charge of the interrogation were at a loss. No matter what they asked, this Elder Zuo Wu refused to speak, and the officers stared helplessly at the surveillance camera.</p>

    <p>Criminal interrogation and punishment were completely useless when it came to genuinely powerful cultivators. You could suppress their spirit energy so that they couldn't use techniques, but you couldn't suppress their thoughts. Sometimes you would encounter truly troublesome cultivators who, when it came to the interrogation session, viewed themselves as old monks disillusioned with the world and would directly enter meditation. No matter what you asked, they wouldn't reply...</p>

    <p>In situations like these, there was only one option, which was to use technology to forcibly extract memories.</p>

    <p>However, Elder Zuo Wu ultimately wasn't a special criminal like the Old Devil. Use of this type of forceful method was only allowed on special criminals, and an application for its use had to be submitted beforehand; only until the entire thing was processed could they proceed.</p>

    <p>Warden Liang and Zhuo Yi sat in the surveillance room and watched the interrogation on the screen.</p>

    <p>After seeing the helpless expressions on the prison officers' faces, Warden Liang frowned. "Director Zhuo, what's going on? Didn't he say on the road that he would confess the truth?"</p>

    <p>"That was indeed what he said on the way here." Zhuo Yi shrugged.</p>

    <p>Man sometimes was this type of two-faced creature...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi actually didn't quite believe that Elder Zuo Wu would go back on his word. He had already died once for President Bai, and he no longer had anymore psychological blocks. Moreover, President Bai now thought he was dead and had no idea at all that he was still alive. Hence, the reason why Elder Zuo Wu was hesitating now was probably because of some other reason.</p>

    <p>In this situation, Elder Zuo Wu needed to be given a bit of external motivation...</p>

    <p>"Put him in the special cell for a while, that should do it," said Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>"Will that be alright..."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, Warden Liang, idol power is strong!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After another half an hour of the interrogation, Elder Zuo Wu still refused to say anything.</p>

    <p>Desperate, Warden Liang could only do as Zhuo Yi said, and put Elder Zuo Wu in the special cell.</p>

    <p>The two experienced prison officers took Elder Zuo Wu to the special cell. When he saw that the place was completely different from where he had been staying earlier, Elder Zuo Wu frowned. "Where is this?"</p>

    <p>"Where your idols are staying," one of the officers replied.</p>

    <p>The other officer then pushed Elder Zuo Wu inside and locked the iron door tight. "Stay here tonight, and behave yourself!"</p>

    <p>Elder Zuo Wu was baffled. He then saw that grizzly-haired Master of Immortal Mansion who had appeared on TV before, the Old Devil in a 36D body, and a young man with a gloomy face playing cards...</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God: "Strike!"</p>

    <p>The Old Devil: "Dodge!"</p>

    <p>Master of Immortal Mansion Cheng Yu: "Southern Barbarian Invasion!"</p>

    <p>The Old Devil and Evil Sword God: "Strike!"</p>

    <p>Master of Immortal Mansion Cheng Yu: "Steal Away!"</p>

    <p>The Old Devil: "Ward<sup>1</sup>!!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(They're playing the Chinese card game based on the "Legends of the Three Kingdoms" ..)</dfn>

    <p>Elder Zuo Wu: "..."</p>

    <p>Elder Zuo Wu: "Everyone..."</p>

    <p>"Another newbie?" The Old Devil gave Elder Zuo Wu a look, his eyes unexpectedly excited for some reason. He promptly dropped the cards he was holding and bellowed from the cell, "Someone! Bring in a mahjong table! We've got enough people!"</p>

    <p>Elder Zuo Wu: "..."</p>
