  <h1>Chapter 618 Xiao Yin Is Caught Once Again</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Driver Liu screamed. His right arm from his hand up to the elbow was instantly dissolved by Xiao Yin's phlegm. The most terrifying thing, moreover, was that though his forearm had been dissolved, the wound wasn't bleeding, and Liu Zhenhua felt a continuous burning pain.</p>

    <p>It felt like someone was holding a lit cigarette lighter under the wound, and Liu Zhenhua's face was drained of color.</p>

    <p>"Is there anything you want to say?" Xiao Yin looked at Driver Liu with a harmless smile on his face.</p>

    <p>While the phlegm he had spat just now seemed like a very casual action, it had in fact been quite a delicate operation.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin could precisely adjust his spitting technique down to the decigram.</p>

    <p>He had deliberately controlled his spit just now. Otherwise, Driver Liu would have been directly dissolved on the spot like the two fellow brothers from the Demon Hunters Association back then, without leaving anything behind.</p>

    <p>Why didn't he just kill this scumbag driver? Xiao Yin's reason was very clear: It was because his Master didn't like him to kill people wantonly. Another important point was that Xiao Yin thought it would really be too easy a death for such a scumbag.</p>

    <p>What went around, came around...</p>

    <p>This evil driver, who had already hurt who knew how many boys and girls, probably never expected to suffer this type of retribution.</p>

    <p>"Even if you hand me over to the police station, I don't have long to live; I have three months at the most." Liu Zhenhua's face was covered with sweat from the pain and his complexion was deathly pale. "I have a terminal illness, Golden Core cancer..."</p>

    <p>"You have a tumor in your golden core?" Xiao Yin was surprised.</p>

    <p>"Yes, and it's terminal. It can't be cured." Liu Zhenhua clenched his teeth in agony. His face was very dark. "So before I die, I want to bring some fear to the world, so that it will remember my existence, Bi Mad Devil..."</p>

    <p>Golden Core cancer was a terminal illness and the only type of cancer for which there was no cure. If it was just an organ that had been pathologically infected, modern cultivation medicine could already completely take care of it. But it wasn't the same for Golden Core cancer, which involved a lot of difficult problems. If a Golden Core cultivator's golden core was shattered, they actually couldn't live for very long. So if the golden core was directly removed, this would probably be even more painful for a Golden Core cultivator than dying right away.</p>

    <p>Once the golden core was removed, the progression of the disease could be stopped, but a person's lifespan would be greatly shortened. The most critical point of all was that after the removal of the golden core, a person would no longer be able to cultivate.</p>

    <p>Thus, the most perfect solution would be to directly kill the infected tissue inside the golden core without affecting the golden core itself. But this had always been the medical conundrum.</p>

    <p>In any case, the chances that a cultivator's golden core would be pathologically affected was actually very low.</p>

    <p>The odds were one in a hundred million...</p>

    <p>And Liu Zhenhua was that "winner" in a hundred million people.</p>

    <p>Some hateful people were pitiful, but while it was true that Liu Zhenhua was a pitiful person, Xiao Yin didn't think he deserved any sympathy at all.</p>

    <p>Everyone would have to pay for whatever they did sooner or later.</p>

    <p>There was a saying which Xiao Yin thought was very true: every person had a different way of finding their place in the world. Those who did good enjoyed a good reputation among the people while those who did evil became notorious... Both were ways of being remembered.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, what was recorded and passed on were always the righteous deeds that promoted virtue. So if you wanted to rely on "notoriety" to make a name for yourself in the cultivation circle, you should never say that you were part of the cultivation world, since that world would never take any notice of you.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin pursed his lips, then bit his finger and hurriedly squeezed out a drop of blood before the wound healed itself. He straight away popped the blood into Liu Zhenhua's mouth.</p>

    <p>With a pained expression on his face, Driver Liu asked suspiciously, "What did you do?"</p>

    <p>"Nothing, just prolonged your life." Xiao Yin spread his hands.</p>

    <p>Of course, he couldn't do anything about an illness which even modern cultivation medicine couldn't cure. However, he could use his holy beast blood to prolong the other party's life.</p>

    <p>Liu Zhenhua tasted blood.</p>

    <p>But strangely, the moment the blood entered his body, his illness seemed to be alleviated quite a bit.</p>

    <p>The tremors caused by his diseased golden core that would come and go from time to time disappeared. Not only that, even the burning sensation in the stump of his melted right forearm eased up.</p>

    <p>That drop of holy beast blood would keep Liu Zhenhua alive for another ten years.</p>

    <p>Liu Zhenhua was pale with fright. "Who on earth are you..."</p>

    <p>A mouthful of phlegm had caused him to fall off a cliff, while one drop of blood had brought him back to life... At that moment, Liu Zhenhua realized the disparity in absolute strength; this Mr Yin could easily do whatever he wanted to him.</p>

    <p>This guy wasn't a normal person at all.</p>

    <p>"Reflect on yourself. I'm calling the police now, and you can spend your final days in prison with soap <sup>1</sup> and your fellow inmates." Xiao Yin crossed his arms with a serious expression.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Refers to 'dropping the soap' as a metaphor for anal sex..)</dfn>

    <p>Liu Zhenhua sensed that things weren't looking good, but when he tried to get out of the car, he discovered that he couldn't move his body at all as an oppressive force rendered him immobile.</p>

    <p>Compared with "Mr Yin," his weak-ass fighting strength wasn't even in the same dimension.</p>

    <p>However, just as Xiao Yin was about to take out his cell phone to call the police, he suddenly heard the undulating sound of sirens on the road...</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was surprised. He couldn't be that lucky, right?</p>

    <p>Two motorcycles directly drove past to stop in front of Liu Zhenhua's car. Then a police officer in uniform got out of a police car which had stopped behind Liu Zhenhua's car. The officer went over to a car window and knocked on it. "Get out, both of you! Routine inspection!"</p>

    <p>When Liu Zhenhua saw the uniform, his pupils contracted slightly and his body went limp right away like a deflated balloon - it was over! Everything was over!</p>

    <p>This was the traffic police; no cars were allowed to pull over on this road. Liu Zhenhua guessed that he had stopped here too long, which was why he had caught their attention.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin rolled down the window and smiled at the officer. "Hi..."</p>

    <p>The officer took a look inside and noticed that the driver's expression wasn't right, and he frowned. "Mr Driver, please show me your ID."</p>

    <p>Liu Zhenhua's brow furrowed tightly and he looked like he was ready to die.</p>

    <p>The police officer already knew something was up. "Since it's like this, please come with us. And..."</p>

    <p>After saying that, the officer looked at Xiao Yin. "This young lady, please come with us, too."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Seven o'clock in the evening, Anning District Cultivation Police Station, Songhai city.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was at this familiar police station once again.</p>

    <p>Unlike the previous two times, he wasn't handcuffed this time. The people at the station were already familiar with this "frequent visitor." A police little sister even enthusiastically made Xiao Yin a cup of tea.</p>

    <p>Sitting inside the interrogation room with the tea in his hands, Xiao Yin didn't wait very long before Officer Gao Tian, who had taken Xiao Yin's statement the previous two times, pushed the door open and walked in.</p>

    <p>At the sight of Xiao Yin, Officer Gao's face couldn't help twitching... Why was it this guy again?!</p>

    <p>Seeing Officer Gao open his little notebook, Xiao Yin promptly started to introduce himself with a familiar air. "Name, Xiao Yin. Gender, male. Single, no bad habits. Favorite things to do are eat, binge-watch shows and play games."</p>

    <p>It was the same process as the previous two times; Xiao Yin was too familiar with it.</p>

    <p>Officer Gao raised his eyes to look at Xiao Yin. "Why did you take a car?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was very honest. "I wanted to go buy myself a collar."</p>

    <p>Officer Gao was taken aback. "..." He somehow felt like he had learned something disastrous...</p>
