  <h1>Chapter 313 Real Son and Fake Son </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Actually, when Zhai Yin had stopped the car in front of the house, Wang Ling had already heard what was happening outside. He had heard everything clearly, including the conversation in the car. At first, Wang Ling had thought that the miserable expression on Wang Ming's face was a little funny, but it was impossible to say that he didn't care at all when he saw how merciless Zhai Yin continued to be.</p>

    <p>No matter what, Wang Ming was still his family. Letting an outsider intrude without an invitation would make Wang Ling feel strange.</p>

    <p>In this respect, he was exactly like his father, preferring only to get along with people he was familiar with. If it had been Mother Wang and the old man, they would definitely have pulled Zhai Yin into the house without a second thought. Thus, while they were still unaware, Wang Ling dragged Wang Ming inside and slammed the door in Zhai Yin's face.</p>

    <p>How could he let an outsider participate in this joyous family occasion?</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling was a little displeased, this was the task which President Qi had assigned Zhai Yin after all, which was to personally protect his idiot elder brother, so Wang Ling didn't embarrass him too much. He just casually cast a small spell the instant he closed the door, covering the outside of the Wang family's small villa with a steel barrier that even a True Immortal probably wouldn't be able to break through.</p>

    <p>After Wang Ling closed the door, Wang Ming felt immensely relieved. He hadn't wanted to leave the institute these two days because of this Zhai Yin! He had been complaining in his heart the entire time that it would have been great if President Qi had given him a beauty... Who would be willing to go out all day tailed by a human ice block?!</p>

    <p>Wang Ming stroked his wrist, as if there was still some residual warmth left behind from when Wang Ling had pulled him in. When he saw Wang Ling let go of his hand with a cold face, the corners of his mouth tilted upward slightly â€” his chance to tease Wang Ling had come!</p>

    <p>He pounced on Wang Ling like a cat and wrapped himself around one arm. Swaying in a coquettish manner, he patted Wang Ling on the shoulder with a faint blush on his face and said in a thready voice, "You devil... you're so hateful!"</p>

    <p>The sound didn't make just Wang Ling's hair stand on end; even Er Ha's dog fur stood up as if it had been electrocuted.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>As expected, this little shit was an idiot!</p>

    <p>"Hey, Little Ming, you've arrived?" Hearing the noise, Father Wang got up from the sofa and walked toward them.</p>

    <p>Seeing this, Wang Ming immediately let go of Wang Ling's arm and said, "Uncle Wang, how are you?" As he spoke, he slanted a stealthy look at Wang Ling's fist, and could vaguely see the protruding blue veins... He was instantly frightened, and thought that if Father Wang had come a little later, Wang Ling would probably have hit him with a full set of intelligence-recovery punches <sup>1</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is from the anime
"Aho-girl," when a teacher

female protagonist becomes

teacher so that she regains her senses.)</dfn>

    <p>"Come here, Little Ming, come in and sit down." Father Wang put his arm around Wang Ming's shoulders and pulled him down onto the sofa. His face was wreathed in smiles, genuinely happier than seeing his own son...</p>

    <p>"What do you want to drink?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming sniffed the air, then chuckled. "I'll just have some soup later! I can smell the coral grouper soup!"</p>

    <p>Father Wang laughed. "You have a nose that will catch up to our Er Ha's."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang sipped his tea, then turned his head to gaze at Wang Ming. "Any new results from your research recently?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had concluded long ago that this wasn't making polite or small talk. This was a question Father Wang would always ask whenever Wang Ling came to the Wang home; supposedly, it could give him inspiration for his writing.</p>

    <p>"Yes, there's one." Wang Ming nodded.</p>

    <p>Many things related to the institute were actually confidential, and most of them couldn't be disclosed. Therefore, whenever Wang Ming spoke about his "research results," it was about his own small and personal inventions.</p>

    <p>"Our biology lab was given eyes left to us by Soul Formation cultivators for study. I recently developed a new invention through this research, but it's still in the trial stage."</p>

    <p>"What invention is this?" Father Wang was very curious, and on the side, Wang Ling also raised his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>"It's a type of long telescope which is based on the retinal structure in the eyes of Soul Formation cultivators! With this long telescope, you'll be able to see whatever is happening a thousand li away."</p>

    <p>"..." Father Wang and Wang Ling both started sweating.</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "If this thing ever fell into the hands of lawbreakers..."</p>

    <p>"Once it's finished, it's definitely only going to be produced on demand. For example, every police station can be equipped with one to keep an eye on suspects, and no crime will go undetected. There's no way we will sell it on the market."</p>

    <p>"Then that's good." Father Wang nodded.</p>

    <p>That was because a while ago, there had been news about a kindergarten teacher who had mistreated the kids and threatened them by saying she had a long telescope, so even when they were at home, she could see them clearly. Apparently, this had frightened the kids so much that it had left a psychological shadow on them.</p>

    <p>When Father Wang had seen this news, he had been secretly glad that Wang Ling had been strong since childhood. This kindergarten teacher was also lucky that she had never met Wang Ling, otherwise he would already have sent her to hell...</p>

    <p>While the three were chatting on the sofa, Father Wang's cell phone rang. As soon as he saw that it was Lie Mengmeng, he got up and went to the veranda to answer the phone.</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "I'm going to take this call, the two of you talk first."</p>

    <p>Seeing Father Wang leave, Wang Ling was just about to ask about the materials in the Heavenly Materials sword when Wang Ming shut down the topic first.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "It'll take me a while to give a clear explanation about the materials identified in the screenshot you sent me. We'll talk about it upstairs after dinner."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling pursed his lips, then sighed in his heart. While Wang Ming was speaking, it so happened that the evening news was replaying an earlier broadcast, and it was still about the extermination of Immortal Mansion.</p>

    <p>This was yet another major event to happen after the old devil's arrest. For this type of big news, the TV would always broadcast it roughly three times, fully putting the policy "important things need to be repeated three times <sup>2</sup> " into practice.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is a song by the Chinese girl group S.I.N.G.)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling had already watched all the news with Father Wang once, so he had a disinterested expression on his face.</p>

    <p>In contrast, when Wang Ming watched it, he said happily, "Tsk, the greatest cultivation dark force in the history of Huaxiu nation? And its core group was destroyed just like that? From what I'm hearing on the news, this Immortal Mansion is supposed to be very well-organized with large numbers of people, but before it could even do anything big, it was already annihilated?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming couldn't help sighing. "Nowadays, these evil forces are becoming worse and worse; they can't even compete with the Dark Cooking Society in Cooking Master Boy ..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>When Wang Ming said this, the news happened to show Cheng Yu being escorted away.</p>

    <p>He stared at Cheng Yu on the news for three seconds, then turned to Wang Ling. "You did this, right?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was instantly speechless. "..." Wang Ming's eyes and tone were exactly like Father Wang's!</p>

    <p>Sure enough... you're actually the real son, right?!</p>
