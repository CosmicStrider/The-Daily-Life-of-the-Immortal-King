  <h1>Chapter 492 Wang Ling's Primordial Qi </h1>

  <div>

    <p>In fact, one hundred percent immunity to restraints was just one of the effects of eating the crispy noodle snack. The unusual power that had taken hold of his body was none other than Wang Ling's primordial qi.</p>

    <p>All negative situations immediately crumbled before Wang Ling's primordial qi. It wasn't just simple and crude containment techniques, even poison attacks had no effect on Xiao Yin now.</p>

    <p>What was more, Wang Ling's primordial qi wasn't limited to defense only. Even a normal attack could be boosted; with the support of the primordial qi, spirit techniques and the casting of spells would double in power.</p>

    <p>Primordial qi was a unique matter which Wang Ling's body had started to produce autonomously when he was a kid. This primordial qi was in fact what the "Anti-Wang Ling Matter" contained in the Dao talisman seal on Wang Ling was suppressing.</p>

    <p>The reason why the slap Wang Ling had given Evil Sword God back then had felt so painful was actually an effect of this primordial qi. Because of the Dao talisman seal, however, the primordial qi in Wang Ling's body was currently in the normal range; if it wasn't controlled, its concentration would definitely exceed the norm.</p>

    <p>During the battle with Evil Sword God, if Wang Ling had slapped him at full strength...</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God would probably have been annihilated without a trace on the spot...</p>

    <p>And Xiao Yin was well aware of this point.</p>

    <p>He didn't know that this power was Wang Ling's primordial qi, but he could feel that he had become stronger in all aspects.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin now finally understood that "abundant spirit energy" was merely a small bonus from eating the enchanted crispy noodle snack - it was this extraordinary power which had taken hold of his body that was the real key!</p>

    <p>But while Xiao Yin had become stronger, his aura hadn't changed.</p>

    <p>This was the most mystical thing about the primordial qi - it was like the existence of an invisible cheat!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>His consecutive failed attempts at containment made Mr Lu frown tightly. He had long reached the height of proficiency in these binding spells; they were most suited for use in this terrain in particular. They had never once failed him in the thousands of years that he'd used them.</p>

    <p>A typical demon beast might have gotten flustered when things didn't go as planned, especially during the tense atmosphere of a fight.</p>

    <p>But Mr Lu was in the end Mr Lu...</p>

    <p>Members of the Tree clan, whether they were spirit trees or demon trees, all shared one major trait, and that was a steady composure.</p>

    <p>They would think carefully and rarely get flustered.</p>

    <p>Although he was aware that the silver-haired young man in front of him was hard to deal with, Mr Lu was still very self-confident.</p>

    <p>"Void sword qi!!" He injected magic into the spirit sword in his hand.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin immediately saw colored glaze sword qi pour forth from the tip of the sword, gradually covering its entire length before the sword vanished as if it had evaporated.</p>

    <p>Each sword had its own special attribute, like Evil Sword God's Heaven-Cleaving sword, which represented the devastating power of primal chaos.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei's Brilliant Victory sword represented the height of defensive and warding abilities.</p>

    <p>And the Skywalker sword that was now in Mr Lu's hand represented the ultimate void.</p>

    <p>Once the void sword qi was mobilized, the sword would directly dissolve in the air to launch a surprise attack as instructed; there was an abundant sense of the "intangible heart sword" in it, which was the highest realm of Sword Dao. But the real "intangible heart sword" was far, far more powerful than the Skywalker sword, and could almost cause devastating destruction.</p>

    <p>The Skywalker sword's void sword qi, in the end, could only grasp the form and not the soul of the "intangible heart sword."</p>

    <p>But even so, the Skywalker sword ranked quite high on the list of swords.</p>

    <p>On the general spirit swords ranking list, while almost all of the top ten swords were first-class holy weapons, the Skywalker sword was the only one at second class.</p>

    <p>These days, Xiao Yin had been bored staying at home all day, so he had casually surfed the Internet for information on the weapons which human cultivators used.</p>

    <p>He hadn't expected Mr Lu's spirit sword to actually be a famous one.</p>

    <p>To be honest, Xiao Yin really wouldn't have been able to tell that it was the "Skywalker sword" if not for Mr Lu's display of "void sword qi."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin somehow felt that there was something wrong with this sword; it didn't really look like the "picture of actual product" that he had seen on the swords ranking list...</p>

    <p>When had the Skywalker sword become a cane sword?</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin felt it was a little strange, but it wouldn't be nice for him to ask. After all, there were a lot of extremely bored cultivators nowadays who enjoyed buying expensive, well-known swords and modifying them according to their tastes.</p>

    <p>If this sword's outer appearance had been modified, Xiao Yin didn't think it was strange.</p>

    <p>The two individuals eyed each other in the intrinsic spirit field for a while, and made up their minds respectively.</p>

    <p>Mr Lu decided to adopt a "war of attrition" strategy, and use his superior regeneration and toughness in concert with the Skywalker sword to fight Xiao Yin to the end.</p>

    <p>Of course, Xiao Yin wasn't a fool.</p>

    <p>The Tree clan's ability to regenerate was well-known. Xiao Yin's plan was a blitzkrieg strategy; he had to deal a single strike so heavy that the other part couldn't recover from it.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After eyeing each other for several seconds, a cold, colored glaze sword tip coalesced in the air and almost pierced Xiao Yin in the cheek.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin quickly sidestepped and avoided the attack.</p>

    <p>The Skywalker sword that had instantly appeared out of thin air cut off several silver strands of Xiao Yin's hair.</p>

    <p>This was a very tricky angle; Xiao Yin felt that if his six senses hadn't been enhanced by the primordial qi, this attack would have severely crippled him!</p>

    <p>Having said that, Xiao Yin thought that this attack by Mr Lu was a little strange.</p>

    <p>Theoretically speaking, the other party was determined to pick a fight with him, so it would make sense if he wasn't lenient in his attack. But while the sword was indeed very fast and could catch a person off guard, judging from the force of the sword qi that the Skywalker sword had released just now, Xiao Yin somehow felt that it wasn't as powerful as he had imagined...</p>

    <p>"Good friend, there seems to be something wrong with your sword..." Xiao Yin expressed his doubts.</p>

    <p>Instead of a reply to his well-meaning words, however, what Xiao Yin got was Mr Lu's next attack. "I bought this Skywalker sword from Jingxi Mall for ten million immortal gold! There's absolutely nothing wrong with it..."</p>

    <p><em>Why won't you believe me...</em></p>

    <p>Xiao Yin sighed. He didn't put up a defense, but instead starting whirling his fist. The ground beneath his feet trembled, and then like a cannon being fired, he shot forward at Mr Lu.</p>

    <p>Mr Lu hadn't expected the other party's attack to actually be this simple and crude...</p>

    <p>He hurriedly summoned the Skywalker sword out of thin air to block Xiao Yin.</p>

    <p>He recited a spell, and soon Xiao Yin sensed a sword hurtling at him from up ahead.</p>

    <p>But this time, Xiao Yin chose to meet it head on as his fist collided with the tip of the Skywalker sword.</p>

    <p>"Heh, it's useless!" When Mr Lu saw this scene, he couldn't help sneering.</p>

    <p>However, the result was contrary to his expectations...</p>

    <p>The sword and fist collided with a sharp, ringing sound.</p>

    <p>In midair, this Skywalker sword... was directly destroyed by Xiao Yin's punch...</p>
