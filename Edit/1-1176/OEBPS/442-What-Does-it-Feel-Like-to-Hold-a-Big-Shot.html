  <h1>Chapter 442 What Does it Feel Like to Hold a Big Shot? </h1>

  <div>

    <p>If someone had come over at that moment to ask Lord Diulei: What on earth does it feel like to hold a big shot...?</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei would definitely be speechless. Actually, he had wanted to ask Wang Ling before if he could borrow Jingke for a mission. However, after the battle at Immortal Mansion, he had completely given up on the idea.</p>

    <p>That battle had ended with a crushing one-sided victory for Jingke... This was a true "bigwig sword."</p>

    <p>Holding Jingke at that very moment, Lord Diulei's heart was trembling. "Brother Ling... is this really okay?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling retreated behind him and patted his shoulder gently without saying a word. He then directly returned to the ground, leaving the battle in the air to Lord Diulei and Evil Sword God.</p>

    <p>Why wasn't he taking part?</p>

    <p>The reason was very simple.</p>

    <p>That was because it was Lord Diulei's disastrous fate to encounter Evil Sword God. If he wanted to pass through this calamity, he had to be the one to personally end things himself.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, I was thinking, maybe we should use a more peaceful way to settle this fight? Like sitting down and having a cup of tea... chat with one another?" There was some helplessness in Lord Diulei's face as he held Jingke... It felt like there had been a sudden change in style these last few days!</p>

    <p>To be honest, the moment his fingers had closed around Jingke, he had already known what the outcome of this battle was going to be.</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God had mostly recovered from his injuries thanks to the effect of True Immortal spirit power, though the traces of blood at the corners of his mouth had yet to dry.</p>

    <p>It could only be said that he was in the end a genuine True Immortal. Even when he was in someone else's intrinsic spirit field, he still had spirit power as boundless as the sea inside him.</p>

    <p>A wooden sword?</p>

    <p>No... This was definitely a trick!</p>

    <p>Looking at the sword in Lord Diulei's hand, Evil Sword God's lips instantly twitched. "Where did your friend get this sword?"</p>

    <p>After experiencing those two slaps, Evil Sword God thought he already had an estimate of the boy's strength. When he had watched the boy pull the peach wood sword out of the space fissure earlier, it didn't take a genius to know that this wasn't some ordinary trash.</p>

    <p>And as one of Wang Ling's best friends, Lord Diulei knew about Jingke's origin.</p>

    <p>The young man in white thought for a moment before replying, "Well... This is a kid's peach wood sword for teaching, bought from the flower and bird market for 998 HNY."</p>

    <p>"Mongrel cultivator! Are you making fun of me?" Evil Sword God hovered high in the air, his hand gripping the Heaven-Cleaving sword which was enveloped in demonic purple sword qi.</p>

    <p>He pointed the sword in front of him. "Do you know why I was granted the title 'Ten-Meter Sword God'?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "???"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sat cross-legged on the ground in a light and relaxed posture. He folded his arms calmly. He knew everything that was going on in the intrinsic spirit field without needing to look up.</p>

    <p>He more or less knew what Evil Sword God wanted to say. Although the latter had already mastered the "Great Sword Dao Spell" and had learned to use the power of Sword Dao, each person's perception of Sword Dao was different.</p>

    <p>Ten-Meter Sword God?</p>

    <p>Had Evil Sword God mastered a consummate skill of Sword Dao which could kill anyone within ten meters?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling cupped his chin and pondered while he watched Evil Sword God laugh wildly. "A True Immortal can mold an intrinsic spirit field into shape, but my intrinsic spirit field is different from theirs: anything that is within a range of ten meters is part of my intrinsic spirit field, constructed with the power of Sword Dao. In other words... As long as I maximize the power of Sword Dao, in close fighting quarters with a range of ten meters, I'm invincible!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>The scene fell into silence at this explanation.</p>

    <p>Both Wang Ling and Lord Diulei's lips twitched as they felt helpless to ridicule him.</p>

    <p>So this was how the title "Ten-Meter Sword God" had come about? What kind of sham was the power of Sword Dao?!</p>

    <p>If he was invincible while fighting at close quarters within ten meters, did it mean that they could win as long as they were out of bounds?</p>

    <p>"..." Lord Diulei couldn't help wiping at his sweat. As expected, this Evil Sword God wasn't an ordinary person...</p>

    <p>On the other side, extremely confident that he was unrivalled in close range combat of ten meters, Evil Sword God pointed the tip of his sword at Lord Diulei. "Don't think of relying on long range attacks to escape. I've cultivated the Teleportation Spell for many years; once the power of Sword Dao is activated, I'll stick to you like glue... No one can escape from me!"</p>

    <p>Then he continued in a deep voice, "Today, I'm going to erase both you and your friend! Then I'll pull out your souls to torture you in the most ruthless ways!"</p>

    <p>He guessed that the young man in white, who he had killed earlier, might have some kind of resurrection magic treasure on him that could trade a life for a life. It wasn't as if such a magic treasure didn't exist in the cultivation world, but it was almost priceless. The young man had already used it once, thus Evil Sword God was now very sure that as long as this young man in white died one more time like before, there was no way he could be resurrected again.</p>

    <p>In this world, how could there be a magic treasure able to resurrect people infinitely? Besides, this man wasn't an Ajin <sup>1</sup> ! Infinite resurrection or whatever didn't exist!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(From the manga of the same name, Ajins have extreme regenerative abilities that trigger upon death or mortal injury, allowing them to completely recover from their wounds in a matter of seconds.)</dfn>

    <p>"Mongrel cultivator, die!" Evil Sword God made a move, and the purple sword qi hovering around the Heaven-Cleaving sword turned into a pillar of qi around it!</p>

    <p>The image of a human skeleton coalesced behind Evil Sword God. It was tens of<em>zhang </em>tall and wearing armor. This was the sword spirit of the Heaven-Cleaving sword!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling could tell at a glance that this armor was the power of Sword Dao that had converged together to take this shape.</p>

    <p>The sword spirit had appeared, coupled with the armor on this skeleton which combined the power of Sword Dao and True Immortal spirit power... Evil Sword God was already exhibiting the full force of the power of Sword Dao, completely holding nothing back.</p>

    <p>But the look on Wang Ling's face didn't change. The moment he had summoned Jingke and tossed it over to Lord Diulei, the game was already over.</p>

    <p>"Die!" Evil Sword God clenched his teeth as the power of Sword Dao surged through his body. The air cracked open and collapsed as the space simply wasn't able to endure the mighty oppression of Evil Sword God's power of Sword Dao at one hundred percent.</p>

    <p>The hell! What should he do?</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei had never seen such a thing before. Given his current realm, it was impossible for him to fight against a True Immortal who was at full strength.</p>

    <p>"This is my most powerful attack. Go to hell!" Evil Sword God shouted.</p>

    <p>As he wielded the Heaven-Cleaving sword, the sword spirit behind him stretched out its hand to the sky at the same time. Tremendous sword light hovered over the skeleton sword spirit, and this demonic purple sword light turned into a beam of light that launched itself at Lord Diulei with a bang like a cannon.</p>

    <p>"Hyper Beam <sup>2</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Hyper Beam is a powerful Pokemon attack that takes the form of a beam of light ..)</dfn>

    <p>In that moment, a gale was stirred up, the space crumbled, and everything in the wake of that beam broke apart. This was an unstoppable force.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei knew that he had the Soul Suppression Ring to protect him and he probably wouldn't be killed, but if that beam of light hit him, he felt that not even a bloody mist would be left behind...</p>

    <p>With this beam, there might not even be slag left.</p>

    <p>But in the next moment, he realized that his body was actually moving on its own.</p>

    <p>"Lord Jingke?"</p>

    <p>He was shocked as the bigwig in his hand actually pulled him along as it moved... and dashed forward to meet this Hyper Beam head-on!</p>
