  <h1>Chapter 455 A Katana in One Hand and a Frying Pan In the Other </h1>

  <div>

    <p>This high priority multi-colored bullet message sticky lingered on screen for a full twenty seconds before disappearing; this was special treatment which only the number one fan could enjoy. Just as he had said, the katana was indeed the latest melee weapon in the game and it was extremely lethal. Two strikes anywhere on the body except the head could kill a person. If the head was targeted, even wearing a helmet wouldn't save them.</p>

    <p>Every game live streamer had their own playstyle. Like in this game, each expert live stream shooter varied in the gun model that they were familiar with. Even then, many people thought that this live streamer was a little "exotic"... After all, this was a shooting game and not Dragon Fighter <sup>1</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Dragon Fighter or Ryujinmaru is a robot character from the anime "Chou Majin Hero Wataru" whose weapon is a sword.)</dfn>

    <p>How did the saying go?</p>

    <p><em>Cut a power cord with a katana and your way is lit with sparks <sup>2</sup> </em><em>...</em></p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is the title of a funny, slice-of-life comic book.)</dfn>

    <p>But there was no mechanism in this game for damaging someone else's weapon!</p>

    <p>Why was this live streamer so confident? If a sniper spied him from a distance, wouldn't he just be killed with one shot to the head?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>There were a lot of doubts floating around, but Daoist Guang had anticipated this outcome and he nodded in satisfaction as he focused seriously on the screen.</p>

    <p>The Focus Spell was still in effect.</p>

    <p>The Heavenly Eye didn't work on data in a virtual game, but Daoist Guang could already clearly see everything on the screen as if the image had been broken down into individual pixels. Not even the smallest, barely indistinguishable moving black dot could escape his eyes.</p>

    <p>After killing someone in that big empty house on the outskirts and taking his heal items, Daoist Guang replenished his energy and directly decided to run for the large buildings in the safe area.</p>

    <p>People in the live stream room were baffled when they saw the direction which Daoist Guang was headed in.</p>

    <p>"No matter how lethal a katana, it's useless. There are definitely people already set up in town and hiding inside to ambush you. You're just a sitting duck if you come over!"</p>

    <p>"Lord Island has guts, I thought he would just hide in the house to ambush more people!"</p>

    <p>"To the message in front... Even if he can win in an ambush, he won't be able to kill twenty people! If he wants to kill more, he'll have to go out on the offensive!"</p>

    <p>When they saw what Daoist Guang's decision was, many people started to sing the song <em>Cold </em>in their hearts.</p>

    <p>For most of them, this was an impossible mission to complete.</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang wasn't in the mood to pay attention to these bullet messages. He knew that before he started killing people, the live stream room would be flooded with all types of mocking and pessimistic predictions. But it was fine; once he started using this kitchen knife... oh, wait, it was a katana! Once he started using a katana, the doubts would vanish like smoke.</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang of course knew that there would be people in the major city!</p>

    <p>And there would definitely be a number of LYBs crouched by the windows in particular to snipe other players.</p>

    <p>So why would he still choose to run in the direction of the major city?</p>

    <p>Because it had a lot of people!</p>

    <p>His final goal was to kill at least twenty people!</p>

    <p>He dashed forward with a calm face; since he had full strength, his character could move very quickly. However, when he was a short distance away from the major city ahead of him, he ducked behind a big tree to hide.</p>

    <p>He had heard the sound of a motorbike!</p>

    <p>It was very clear that it was coming from right up ahead.</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang didn't have headphones on and everything was played through the computer speakers, so even the sound of the waves nearby might interrupt him during his live stream. But as a True Immortal cultivator, even if the Heavenly Eye wasn't of any help in a virtual game, his hearing, which was his strongest sense, was finally coming in handy.</p>

    <p>In the beginning, many viewers hadn't understood Daoist Guang's action, and it wasn't until they saw the motorbike speeding over that they suddenly figured it out.</p>

    <p>"This sense of hearing is terrifying!"</p>

    <p>"The live streamer is live streaming from an island and he's not wearing headphones. How did he hear it?"</p>

    <p>"New friend, Lord Island's sense of hearing has always been very good!" an old viewer who was now a "Light Chaser" replied in a bullet message.</p>

    <p>The motorbike stopped at a petrol station up ahead, twenty meters from the big tree. Daoist Guang confirmed that this person hadn't noticed him, and when the latter got off the motorbike to go and plunder the petrol station, Daoist Guang instantly charged forward madly.</p>

    <p>"Audience friends!"</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang yelled as he sprinted forward, "It's time to witness how Lord Island will take this delivery!"</p>

    <p>"Take... take the delivery? Be careful that it's not you giving the delivery away!"</p>

    <p>"Shun Feng God Express, providing the best delivery service."</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang looked at the bullet messages on the screen out of the corner of his eye, his heart as calm as an old well. He held his breath as he approached the petrol station little by little. He made his steps as light as possible and at the same time listened attentively for the person's position inside.</p>

    <p>The player was searching the room. It was a small independent mart in a poor location. Next to it was a low two-story building which had yet to be searched; its windows were intact and its front entrance was locked.</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang immediately surmised that the player would straightaway plunder the two-story building after the latter was done searching the mart.</p>

    <p>Given Daoist Guang's melee weapon, once the man slipped up to the second floor, the chances of killing him would be greatly reduced.</p>

    <p>Hence, Daoist Guang immediately decided that he had to get rid of this person as soon as he came out of the mart!</p>

    <p>He listened carefully for the man's steps in the mart and slowly slipped to one side of the entrance. There was no way to jump out of this mart's anti-theft windows; the only way out was the front entrance â€” this was a good opportunity!</p>

    <p>At that moment, Daoist Guang noticed that the steps had started to become irregular and were gradually approaching the entrance.</p>

    <p>The player was coming out!</p>

    <p>The instant the entrance doors opened...</p>

    <p>This player hadn't expected someone to be at the front entrance! Furthermore, it was someone without a gun! Instead, the other party was holding a dazzling katana as he crouched by the entrance!</p>

    <p>What the hell?! What kind of operation was this?!</p>

    <p>It was obvious that this person had no reaction whatsoever as he trembled with a UMP9 in his hands...</p>

    <p>Boosted by the Focus Spell and coupled with his sense of hearing, Daoist Guang's instant reaction was truly too quick!</p>

    <p><em>Crack </em>!</p>

    <p>The moment the doors opened, that long and bright katana struck the man precisely in the head!</p>

    <p>In the top right corner of the screen, a conspicuous system kill notification instantly appeared: <em>Player "LORD ISLAND" has used "Katana" to kill player "CLEARLOVE8" with a headshot.</em></p>

    <p>Under everyone's disbelieving gazes, Daoist Guang had already obtained two kills!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>The bullet messages exploded once again.</p>

    <p>"666! Lord Island is awesome!"</p>

    <p>"666 666!"</p>

    <p>"He's not cheating, right? It feels like Lord Island's actions and line of thought were very clear!"</p>

    <p>Like before, Daoist Guang grabbed all the heal items on this person. Currently, he had four First Aid Kits, two energy drinks and two painkillers.</p>

    <p>Looking at the rest of this player's supplies, Daoist Guang thought for a while before he picked up the man's frying pan.</p>

    <p>In the live stream room, someone immediately sent a bullet message when they saw this. "Butt Protection Pan! It's a divine weapon!"</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang smiled faintly. "Audience friends, Lord Island will show you how to stop bullets with a frying pan!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Audience: "..." If he could really do it, then he was really abnormal!</p>

    <p>At that moment, Daoist Guang took a look in his live stream room and saw that yet another wealthy fan had sent him a gift, and he promptly gave his thanks. "Thank you [Your Majesty Who Catches Blood With a Pad] for the spirit blademountain <sup>3</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>("Spirit Blade Mountain" is the title of a well-known online novel by the author Your Majesty, who is also known as Catches Blood With a Pad ..)</dfn>

    <p>Even though Daoist Guang had obtained a kill, Wang Ling noticed that he still didn't look happy about it.</p>

    <p>That was because the second blue circle had already started to move.</p>

    <p>During that period, the number of people displayed in the top right corner had declined sharply - there were only sixty-seven people left!</p>
