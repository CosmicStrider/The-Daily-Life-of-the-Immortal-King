  <h1>Chapter 247 Can Only Become a Big Shot Through Study </h1>

  <div>

    <p>People were prone to forget things. Even if there was a way to get rid of the memory, the entire memory timeframe would also be erased. Trying to extract a specific memory of a particular event and make it disappear was truly difficult.</p>

    <p>"As expected... it can't be done, can it?"</p>

    <p>Boss Tan sighed with some resignation. "If there truly is no other way, I can only handle it by force..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei raised an eyebrow. "For example?"</p>

    <p>Boss Tan: "For example, when he gets the craving to do martial arts, I'll forcibly tie him up and stop him from doing the hand seals."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"But even then there's another problem; when he goes into withdrawal, my little brother will go wild with rage, and it'll be very hard to control him then." Saying this, Boss Tan's eyes lit up. "Unless... we have the Golden Canopy Rope."</p>

    <p>The Three Auspicious Treasures again...</p>

    <p>It suddenly occurred to Lord Diulei that the Seven Stars Sword which they had obtained from that subordinate of the Lady of the Castle, Ah You, was still with him.</p>

    <p>After that, Lord Diulei had in fact asked Little Black to investigate the remaining two magic weapons. He already knew that one of them, the genuine Purple Gold Gourd, had been in the old devil's hands, while there was no news yet on the whereabouts of the Golden Canopy Rope.</p>

    <p>On the side, as he listened to the conversation between the two, Tan Qian's eyes dimmed significantly. If it hadn't been for today's incident, he would never have realized how deep the still waters ran in Immortal Mansion. "Brother, when I go back, I'll be honest and resign."</p>

    <p>"No, given the current situation, it would be safer for you to remain at Immortal Mansion. Fortunately, this aligns with our investigation into this organization. For these people to turn you into this... it would be better to just kill them all."</p>

    <p>Tan Qian started at the look in Tan Siming's eyes. This was the first time he had seen such an expression on his big brother's face.</p>

    <p>Boss Tan's eyes darkened. "The most important thing right now is to find a way to help you suppress the side effects of the Panwu Immortal Martial Arts."</p>

    <p>"How about we wait for Ling Zhenren to return and ask him then?" Dharmaraja suddenly cut in.</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren?"</p>

    <p>Boss Tan patted his head in sudden recollection. "Oh, is that the young man who wrote a song in my shop before?" Back then, he had already felt that the young man wasn't a simple person, but he hadn't thought that he would actually be a big shot!</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren has amazing abilities, he will definitely think of something. But we won't know for sure until he comes back. At the moment, he's still at his school's military training," said Dharmaraja.</p>

    <p>...School... military training?</p>

    <p>Because he had already seen Father Wang before, Boss Tan was already aware of Wang Ling's identity as a student. But when he heard Dharmaraja's words for himself, he was still unable to suppress his shock... this Lightning Dharmaraja and Great Death-Courting Senior Lord Diulei in front of him were both famous in the cultivation world, but even they called Wang Ling "Zhenren <sup>1</sup> " over and over again, as befitting a senior...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A reminder that 'Zhenren' means 'perfected one.')</dfn>

    <p>Boss Tan really couldn't imagine Ling Zhenren's reason for being so absorbed in his studies...</p>

    <p>Sure enough! Knowledge was power.</p>

    <p>Could it be that one could only become a big shot through study?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>That evening, Tan Qian didn't leave until he and Boss Tan had had dinner at the Wang family's small villa.</p>

    <p>The old man was very hospitable toward the Tan brothers. While this was Boss Tan's first time meeting Grandfather Wang, it was enough to make him want to prostrate himself in admiration before the old man. In the face of Tan Qian's harassment and offense against them, Grandfather Wang hadn't gotten angry, but instead had repaid evil with good — only a true great senior would have this type of tolerance!</p>

    <p>On the way back to Immortal Mansion on his flying sword, Tan Qian's eyes were fixed on the small medicine bottle in his hand, his heart filled with complex emotions.</p>

    <p>Since he hadn't been able to think of a way to suppress the addiction caused by the Panwu Immortal Martial Arts, Lord Diulei had given Tan Qian this bottle of sleeping pills for the time being. It was the best solution he could think of at the moment to thoroughly cut off the addiction caused by cultivating this technique.</p>

    <p>These sleeping pills had been personally made by Immortal Toya. Half a pill was enough to make a Soul Formation cultivator sleep for three hours — even if the sky collapsed, he wouldn't wake up. The effect of a whole pill would usually last for six hours, which happened to coincide with when the martial arts withdrawal would happen.</p>

    <p>But relying on sleeping pills wasn't a long-term solution. The higher a person's realm, the more immune they became to the drug. This bottle of sleeping pills would only be good for half a month at the most. After that, the drug's efficacy would plummet.</p>

    <p>Of course, this wasn't the real reason for Tan Qian's confused feelings.</p>

    <p>He had clearly come to the Wang family's small villa today to investigate the truth about them, but in the end he had failed. Instead, he had been caught, and had been taught a lesson by his own big brother on the spot before being fooled into staying on with Immortal Mansion, but as a spy.</p>

    <p>As for the Master of Immortal Mansion's ultimate aim, this was all speculation on his brother Tan Siming's part. Though Tan Qian felt that it was already very close to the truth, if he wanted to verify it, he would still need to do his best and collect some real evidence.</p>

    <p>What he found surprising...</p>

    <p>...was that he had actually become the legendary "erwuzai <sup>2</sup> "...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is Cantonese slang to refer to a traitor..)</dfn>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Sometimes coincidence was a magical thing — you never knew what was going to happen next. Even Wang Ling, who knew the Measuring Fate Spell and had once predicted Guo Hao's fate, couldn't predict his own fortune.</p>

    <p>It was June 20th on Monday in the ninth week of the semester.</p>

    <p>The combined military training for the six schools had ended. The school had specially put aside today as a day of rest for students to relieve their fatigue and absorb the knowledge they gained from the military training.</p>

    <p>To be honest, Wang Ling hadn't profited much from the military training, especially since he had gone into it with a "fishing in troubled waters" mentality. Guo Hao might have suffered because of one mouthful of Mother Juan's "fan bing bing," but he was the person to have benefited the most from it.</p>

    <p>Various renowned universities had extended an olive branch to him, and a spirit sword manufacturer had even invited him to be their brand ambassador. It could be said that his future career path was bright...</p>

    <p>Guo Hao had once said that his dream was to open the biggest seafood market in the country, larger than his family's pet shop in terms of both scale and reputation.</p>

    <p>And back then, Wang Ling had indeed measured Guo Hao's fortune.</p>

    <p>According to the outcome of his fortune-telling at that time, Guo Hao's ambition would be realized in five hundred years.</p>

    <p>Now, Wang Ling finally understood.</p>

    <p>The military training was the original source of all this evil...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the evening at the Wang family's small villa, Wang Ling returned to his bedroom and found signs that Jingke had taken action. He had placed Jingke under his pillow before he left, and now he noticed that Jingke was next to it instead.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, while he had been gone these two days, someone had come to make trouble.</p>

    <p>He suddenly felt that leaving Jingke behind in the villa had been the right decision to make.</p>

    <p>"Ling Ling, come down and eat." Mother Wang had already prepared dinner downstairs.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling put Jingke away again and went downstairs. It was only then that he realized that Er Ha actually hadn't followed him upstairs earlier.</p>

    <p>That was because when it had gone up halfway, the old man had intercepted it to squish its cheeks.</p>

    <p>As he rubbed Er Ha's fat little face, the old man frowned and murmured in his heart: Why has this kid lost weight?</p>
