  <h1>Chapter 58 Second Battalion Commander! You Son of a Bitch... </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It could be said that the team management system for all stray cats originated in Peiyuan district. After years of expansion, there were now more than a thousand stray cat groups, of all shapes and sizes, in Peiyuan district alone.</p>

    <p>The three famous cat army generals — Tang Shi, Song Ci and Yuan Qu — each managed their own division. The army consisted of three divisions, each division consisted of three brigades, and each brigade consisted of three regiments...</p>

    <p>Looking at the scale of development in Zheng Tan's Independent Regiment, it could absolutely be called a star regiment. And once the entire regiment heard this order and moved out, the scene and scale of this operation was truly jaw-dropping.</p>

    <p>The old willow in the alley was one of Zheng Tan's main headquarters. It was in turn supported by more than ten secret bases, large and small, that had been set up all over Number 59 High School's school grounds. However, most of them were hidden inside the willow hole.</p>

    <p>Now the troops came pouring out all at once. Just the air sparrows alone numbered more than a thousand. In the sky, they looked like a mighty and aggressive swarm of locust! Along with the rest of the calvary, the spy battalion, and normal battalions... including every military branch, Zheng Tan's Independent Regiment added up to more than ten thousand soldiers! Their strength was almost on par with a military division!</p>

    <p>Under the cover of night, the Independent Regiment's sparrows came out in full force and filled the whole sky above Number 59 High School; stray cats showed up in the grass, in the treetops and in every corner of the school grounds. Looking at this sight, Wang Ling couldn't help drawing in a sharp breath.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, it was already after school; it would be impossible for such a bustle to go unnoticed otherwise, and it would very likely become a hot topic of discussion the next day.</p>

    <p>The old uncle patrolling the school grounds couldn't help knitting his brows when he realized that there were more stray cats around the school than usual today. Three to four cats on average sat around on each of the tens of benches in the school... some of the kittens were even publicly engaging in a certain indescribable activity, which flustered the old guard and made him blush.</p>

    <p>Given that spring was animal mating season, the old uncle didn't interrupt their pistoning motions. Inspecting his surroundings and finding nobody suspicious, he turned off his flashlight and left under the moonlight.</p>

    <p>In fact, these cats were extras that had been employed by Zheng Tan to draw the patrolling guard's attention. The real troops were all well hidden. As soon as the old guard left, countless pairs of gleaming eyes opened in the grass.</p>

    <p>Cats had sharp night vision; they were swift, nimble and smart, and they made no sound at all as they jumped out of the grass.</p>

    <p>The operation was progressing more smoothly than anticipated.</p>

    <p>The commander-in-chief of this operation was Zheng Tan and the lieutenant commander was a short-tail cat with black spots. Since it was a little bald, Zheng Tan had nicknamed it The Monk.</p>

    <p>It was Battalion One's commander, and also one of Zheng Tan's most outstanding cat soldiers to date.</p>

    <p>In Battalion One, The Monk's soldiers had a very specific impression of it, that it was smart as a whip.</p>

    <p>Previously, Wang Ling had only enlightened the three cat tyrants, The Little Tigers. It was these three cats — Tang Shi, Song Ci and Yuan Qu — that had taught the rest of the stray cats and enabled them to advance to this point.</p>

    <p>Of course, Wang Ling was not the first person to have opened a stray cat to spiritual wisdom. Plenty of cultivators had helped their pets achieve spiritual enlightenment, whether they were hamsters, centipedes, tortoises, rabbits, Pikachus... any pet you could think of would have been covered. It was worth mentioning that The Monk had also been born with a very high IQ.</p>

    <p>When Zheng Tan had been grooming The Monk back then, it had been very easy and had cost Zheng Tan no effort at all. As soon as it had been born, The Monk had taught itself junior skills such as catching a mouse. Now, after enlightenment, The Monk could use its wits and intelligence to play tens of dogs easily in the palm of its hand...</p>

    <p>The Monk stood calmly on the command platform from where the physical education teachers usually directed students in exercising.</p>

    <p>A moment later, the cats from Battalion One which had been dispatched to carry out the search all returned.</p>

    <p>"Results?"</p>

    <p>Several of the battalion leaders meowed at The Monk for a while. The Monk's whiskers twitched slightly. "The classrooms, corridors, and offices on each story were searched, correct?"</p>

    <p>Then, it was a very clear conclusion.</p>

    <p>There was only the gymnasium left...</p>

    <p>Why would a man run to the gym in the middle of the night? To peep at schoolgirls as they trained, and in the end get himself locked in?</p>

    <p>Bloody hell, what kind of weird fetish did this man have?!</p>

    <p>As a cat already disillusioned with society, The Monk's scorn for him was already beyond words.</p>

    <p>But Immortal Meow was looking for this person, so it didn't have much to say.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had always thought that the stray cats had potential. Although they appeared all alone without shit-shoveling officers to care for them, as long as they banded together, they could produce incredible results.</p>

    <p>Back then, uniting these scattered stray cats had just been a casual idea. Who would have thought that the seeds which Wang Ling had unintentionally sown would grow into lush willows that were now coming in handy.</p>

    <p>There was now less than half an hour left...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling could feel the talisman seal deteriorating even further. Now more than ever, he didn't dare make any big moves, for fear that his aura would be like prehistoric powers flowing out of control.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, news came to Zheng Tan very quickly; a sparrow immediately brought back investigation results from the frontline.</p>

    <p>Zheng Tan nodded and looked at Wang Ling. "Immortal Meow, the location has been confirmed — he's inside the gym!"</p>

    <p>The gym?</p>

    <p>Given how strong his spiritual senses were, it was impossible that Wang Ling wasn't able to infiltrate the gym with his spirit. Hence, he believed the people who had kidnapped Wang Ming weren't using a simple magic weapon. At the very least, it had to contain the same material which his talisman seal was made from, creating a dead zone for his spiritual senses.</p>

    <p>But now that the location had been confirmed, the rest would be simple...</p>

    <p>Shortly after that, Wang Ling and Zheng Tan arrived at the front doors of the gym, which were shut. A sparrow perched atop the skylight of the gym pinpointed Wang Ming's specific location — this guy was in the women's locker room!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Zheng Tan moved around to the back of the gym and stopped in front of a thick wall.</p>

    <p>The entire gym had been constructed out of black crystal. It was so solid that it wouldn't crumble via normal methods of demolition.</p>

    <p>Of course, if the talisman seal had been functioning normally, Wang Ling could have torn down the wall effortlessly. But the situation now was a little unique, and since the talisman seal was about to expire, he was afraid one punch from him would cause widespread destruction for hundreds of li around the gym.</p>

    <p>After some thought, Wang Ling didn't make a move, and just turned his eyes to Zheng Tan instead.</p>

    <p>Zheng Tan was instantly filled with awe!</p>

    <p>Of course it wasn't doubting Immortal Meow's prowess. How could a mere wall stump Immortal Meow?</p>

    <p>Zheng Tan thought that Immortal Meow was clearly giving it a chance to prove itself!</p>

    <p>Right away it got excited, and it turned around to meow loudly, "Second Battalion Commander! Second Battalion Commander, you son of a bitch, where is the Yidali cannon? Bring it here and blast a hole in this damn wall!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
