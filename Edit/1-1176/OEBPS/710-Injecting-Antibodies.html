  <h1>Chapter 710 Injecting Antibodies</h1>

  <div>

    <p>As part of the research team, Wang Ming's participation in this trip was a sheer coincidence. Also, Head of State 001 was in the experimental stage, so if any problems cropped up during its operation, Wang Ming could promptly make adjustments; he also had the emergency brake button for Head of State 001 on him.</p>

    <p>In addition, President Qi had a long-range brake system in place as an additional safeguard. In an emergency, however, it took time for the system to officially start up once the instruction was given, so it was safer for Wang Ming to carry that brake button on him.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Head of State 001 was in fact standing right next to Wang Ming, but was currently in invisible mode. Except for Wang Ling and Fang Xing, no one else could see it.</p>

    <p>Head of State 001 was now in alert mode. All the data on every student and teacher on this trip had already been imported into its database. Once a dangerous person showed up, Head of State 001 would automatically take action.</p>

    <p>Hence, the reason why Wang Ming had the confidence to act as a lead teacher was because he had Head of State 001.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ling noticed that Zhai Yin had changed into the white Daoist robe that was the uniform which had been custom-made by Huaxiu Alliance, and was the lead teacher for a different formation of students.</p>

    <p>Seeing this, Wang Ling was clear as a mirror on the basic details of the situation.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Chen Chao suddenly asked, "This Lao Gudong Xiaoer leading us, where have I seen him before? Somehow he seems a little familiar..."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao nodded his head. "I also feel that he seems familiar for some reason!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Back during the combined military training for the six schools, Wang Ming had gotten along well with Chen Chao, Guo Hao and the others. After the military training, however, in order to protect his identity, Wang Ming had gotten Wang Ling to wipe their memories of him.</p>

    <p>This sense of familiarity was a subconscious sixth sense. Wang Ling's impression of Wang Ming was that he had always been an easygoing person, who was a little more restrained in front of Zhai Yin, but acted very cheekily the rest of the time.</p>

    <p>At that moment, more and more people had already congregated in the public square. More than a hundred teachers and a team of research experts would be leading over a thousand Foundation Establishment students in an exploration of Beast King's Remains. A summer camp activity happening at the same time as a research expedition - this was indeed an uncommon event. Also, Wang Ling noticed that there weren't any media crews nearby.</p>

    <p>As early as midnight, a curfew had already been imposed on the roads around the square. At that time, Wang Ling had already wondered whether the entrance to Beast King's Remains was going to open in Peiyuan's public square.</p>

    <p>Looking at the situation, this was probably the case.</p>

    <p>"I never expected so many big shots to enter the remains this time. Since our nation values it so much, do you think the Ten Generals might be sent to protect us? Are the remains that dangerous?" Chen Chao asked curiously.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"I looked it up before, and Devil Valley Beast King's Remains is the tomb which Devil King built for itself. But the rumor is that Devil King was turned into stew while it was sleeping. Of course, this is all hearsay, and there's no concrete evidence for it."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao said, "But to decorate its tomb back then, Beast King grew numerous precious natural resources in Devil Valley. This is why some extinct natural resources still exist in the valley. As for whether or not Devil Valley is dangerous, I heard that it shouldn't be, since there are no signs of any living creatures there - for now, we can perhaps treat it as a botanical garden?"</p>

    <p>The corner of Wang Ling's mouth twitched when he heard this.</p>

    <p>What damn botanical garden...</p>

    <p>Just because there weren't any living creatures in Beast King's Remains didn't mean that it wasn't dangerous. After all, it was possible that a small proportion of the plant life had gained enlightenment through cultivation and could attack people. In addition, some of these extinct resources were extremely poisonous, which was something everyone had to be mindful about.</p>

    <p>Apart from that, Devil Valley's natural environment was itself hugely dangerous.</p>

    <p>And the most dangerous part was entering and exiting the valley.</p>

    <p>There wasn't a special fixed time when Devil Valley opened; usually, it was the government that would detect fluctuations from the secret land's entrance, and make arrangements in advance for entering and exiting the valley.</p>

    <p>So during this operation, it was very important to follow the lead teachers' instructions the entire time. Although it was a summer camp, the majority of the students couldn't go overboard in their antics. Otherwise, if they wandered off from the group and got trapped alone in the valley, they would be risking their lives.</p>

    <p>Thus, many of the students listening to Guo Hao's detailed analysis on the side couldn't help feeling a little nervous. When all was said and done, they were only at the Foundation Establishment stage, and most of them had yet to experience much of the world. If they really had to fight, there was no way they could match pros in terms of actual combat training, even if there were training classes for real combat in high school.</p>

    <p>Battle courses were only offered at progressive levels in university.</p>

    <p>Depending on what their strong points were, each person could choose a different major, whether it was the specialized cultivation of a particular weapon or of spells and so forth.</p>

    <p>Given today's era of peace, the education council had grown stricter over the years when it came to the teaching of battle skills.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had heard that a "battle qualification certificate" would be officially put out next year. Except for special circumstances in which one was saving lives, only certified cultivators would have the right to fight in urban areas, otherwise it would be considered breaking the law. In the future, schools would organize a qualification exam every year for the students, depending on the demand for it, but whether or not the students could obtain the certificate was a different story.</p>

    <p>If they managed to obtain this certificate, it would be a plus in their favor, just like any other marketable skill, when they looked for jobs in the future.</p>

    <p>"As long as you follow the teacher leading your formation and don't act on your own, there won't be any especially big problems," one of the teachers told all the students at that moment.</p>

    <p>Everyone was blank; what did he mean by "no especially big problems"... That was to say, there definitely were going to be problems!</p>

    <p>Not long after Wang Ming arrived, a dozen or so ambulances with sirens flashing drove up to the side of the square around ten minutes later.</p>

    <p>"Lao Gudong Xiaoer, what's this?" Su Xiao asked Wang Ming at that moment.</p>

    <p>"It's hazardous inside the remains, so we've arranged for everyone to get an antibody vaccination. Before entering the remains, you'll be injected with a universal antibody, so even if you touch a poisonous plant by accident, ninety-five percent of the toxin in your body will be neutralized," explained Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>"Antibody? Produced by which company?" Sun Rong was quite familiar with the pharmaceutical field. Standing in the neighboring formation, she couldn't help asking the question when she heard Wang Ming's explanation.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, this is a genuine company which follows regulations."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming quickly replied, "This time, Huaxiu Alliance looked for a genuine partner to collaborate with. That unscrupulous Gao Junfang whose Changchun Biotechnology company produced substandard vaccines was punished <sup>1</sup> not long ago. The Cultivation Court sentenced her to lifetime imprisonment and she has to use up all the fake drugs she created herself."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(An allusion to a real case..)</dfn>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>
