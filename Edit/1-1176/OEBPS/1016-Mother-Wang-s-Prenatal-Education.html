  <h1>Chapter 1016 Mother Wang's Prenatal Education</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wei Zhi's job for them wasn't very complicated. It was just like working in a pet shop, and Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi got the hang of it very quickly. Wei Zhi had intended to hire some assistants to help him before, but the experience such external helpers had was patchy and they wouldn't stay for very long.</p>

    <p>Taming spirit beasts was a matter of technique. As a pet trainer, Wei Zhi naturally had his own unique skills. Nowadays, some part-time workers would learn these methods before they quit and disappeared to start anew elsewhere. Wei Zhi didn't want this group of people to profit off him.</p>

    <p>In the end, Wei Zhi was utterly delighted when Wang Ling introduced two individuals to him.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi had far more experience than Wei Zhi had imagined. They didn't need special instructions from him at all. Instead, it was Wei Zhi who learned new things from them.</p>

    <p>"You've raised spirit beasts before?" When he saw how incredibly proficient Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi this pair of foes were, Wei Zhi was instantly curious about their identities.</p>

    <p>"You can think of it that way, but I've never raised such small ones." Wang Zhen's face was as calm as an ancient well.</p>

    <p>"So you raised...?" Wei Zhi asked.</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi answered, "His family runs a fishery."</p>

    <p>"A fishery?" In his heart, Wei Zhi ran through the types of large spirit beasts that could be raised in a fishery - it could only be something like a spirit whale. There was a Water King Whale at the Pet Trainers Guild, but because of its massive size, it was being reared in the western sea, where the Pet Trainers Guild had a base for raising spirit beasts.</p>

    <p>"Raising whales certainly isn't easy... how unexpected, that you have experience in raising whales on your own." Wei Zhi was instantly reassured. Not just anyone could raise cetacean spirit beasts, which would die if they weren't cared for well enough.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen sighed.</p>

    <p>After all, pet trainers in the world below knew nothing about them.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi both believed that there had to be a reason Wang Ling had arranged for them to work here.</p>

    <p>This was an era in which a person could become a True Venerated just by eating broccoli... Following Ling Zhenren's arrangements could only be a good thing.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi was a person from the world below, but as long as they worked hard, they might comprehend something new through him!</p>

    <p>So Wang Zhen didn't plan to hide anything from Wei Zhi. He shook his head and said outright, "It's not whales that I raise."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi already felt out of his depth, and asked with a puzzled face, "Not whales?"</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen: "I raise kun."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "???"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the evening on the same day that Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi got the job, a delivery truck from the cultivation department store in the city center drove up to the gate of the Wang family's small villa, carrying a large number of goods that Mother Wang had bought today.</p>

    <p>"Madam, this is the inventory list of your goods; please check and sign for it." The little delivery brother stood at the gate with a big smile on his face.</p>

    <p>For the cultivation department store, this was a rare big customer. The night shift delivery fee was based on a percentage of the total amount of goods. The commission was only a very small percentage, but if they received a huge order, it was simply a huge profit for them!</p>

    <p>The deliveries were randomly assigned by the system, and the delivery little brother felt very lucky.</p>

    <p>After Mother Wang checked the goods and made sure that nothing was missing, she gave a very reasonable evaluation of the delivery: five stars.</p>

    <p>The little brother bowed very politely. "Cultivation department store staff number 193, Qin Zong, thanks you for your evaluation! I look forward to seeing madam next time!"</p>

    <p>For some reason, Wang Ling thought the name sounded a little familiar <sup>1</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A reminder that Qin Zong is
the name of the protagonist of
the author's other novel "The
Cultivation World's Only Koi .. ")</dfn>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Mother Wang had indeed bought quite a number of things this time. At home, the cooking condiments had all been replaced with those specially for pregnant women. In addition, Mother Wang had bought a lot of baby clothes. She didn't know if the baby in her belly was a little brother or sister, so she had chosen neutral styles which wouldn't be too strange whether they were worn by a boy or a girl.</p>

    <p>After using a storage pouch to bring in the goods from the truck, Mother Wang took them out one by one in the living room and started to admire her spoils from her afternoon shopping spree.</p>

    <p>Distracted by the sounds below, Father Wang couldn't focus on typing. When he went downstairs, he saw the objects spread out on the floor like at a street vendor's stall.</p>

    <p>One month's worth of his earnings... gone...</p>

    <p>"There's no need for so many things..." Father Wang looked at the floor, hands on his hips. "Some of these might be impulse buys... I remember the cultivation department store will refund goods within three days of purchase..."</p>

    <p>"What refund? All these are necessary!" Mother Wang rolled her eyes at Father Wang. "When we had a baby for the first time, we were inexperienced. After I had Ling Ling, I'd always wondered why he couldn't be normal like other kids, and instead had unusual gifts... Now I understand."</p>

    <p>Father Wang and Wang Ling: "???"</p>

    <p>Mother Wang: "It must be because we didn't give him enough prenatal education back then!"</p>

    <p>Father Wang and Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Mother Wang: "Sometimes, the comprehensive development of virtue, intelligence, physique, and culture should start in the womb. When I was pregnant with Ling Ling, I always felt that we didn't communicate enough, which led to his bad temper after he was born. What if we had helped correct him earlier on in the womb, even with just a bit of psychological counseling? He might have come out a normal child..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>It had to be said that Mother Wang was truly doing a lot to prepare for the birth of her second child.</p>

    <p>This was clear from this "prenatal education" segment.</p>

    <p>And all of Mother Wang's hard work was in order to avoid giving birth to yet another "time bomb"...</p>

    <p>"Look at this. It's a magic weapon I specially bought from the baby section of the cultivation department store." Mother Wang picked up a pair of earphones from among the objects laid out on the floor. It still had a price tag on it, and Father Wang sucked in a cold breath at the string of zeros... These earphones alone were already a week's worth of his earnings!</p>

    <p>"What is this..."</p>

    <p>"Prenatal education earphones." Reading the instruction manual, Mother Wang placed one earphone to her belly, and put the other in her own ear to demonstrate. "This way, you'll be able to hear the baby speak inside the belly."</p>

    <p>"Honey, you're only a few days pregnant... It's just an embryo..."</p>

    <p>"So what? Embryos have biological waves too!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"The best thing about these earphones is that it can translate biological waves on the spot. The earphones will turn whatever we want to say into a biological wave, which is then transmitted into the belly, so we can communicate with the baby!" Mother Wang smiled and said, "How about we give it a name first? Ling Ling, what do you think?"</p>

    <p>A name...</p>

    <p>Chin in hand, Wang Ling thought very hard.</p>

    <p>"Nuan.</p>

    <p>"Wang Nuan."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling opened his mouth.</p>
