  <h1>Chapter 391 The White-Faced Girl </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Taming and training a holy beast was in fact a rather long process...</p>

    <p>It was like a mini simulation game, the first part of which was similar to a romance game Wang Ling had found to be popular among the girls in school. The girls jokingly called the game "Keeping Men"; one wrong move would lead to a tragic ending... For Wang Ling, it was far easier to raise a holy beast at the level of a loyal dog than for the girls in class to keep four men in their phones!</p>

    <p>July 8th was the eleventh Saturday of the semester.</p>

    <p>That morning, a silver-haired young man showed up in front of the Wang family's small villa; he was in a white shirt and a matching pair of skintight jeans with holes in them. Because of the outfit Lord Diulei had given him the last time, Xiao Yin had gone to the mall himself to buy a similar set.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei had initially wanted to come with him, but after the Demon Hunters Association had been exposed, the dramatic increase in the number of new posts on the cultivation forum overnight had directly overloaded the system and in the end crashed the server. At the moment, he was sorting out the data and doing server maintenance.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin remembered that before he had left, Lord Diulei had released an official apology: <em>We apologize; the server has crashed due to technical issues. Right now, our technicians are doing everything they can to resolve the problem. Once maintenance is complete, friends whose posts have disappeared will receive a head of broccoli as compensation. Thank you for your cooperation!</em></p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"This should be it, right?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin glanced at the location Lord Diulei had sent him.</p>

    <p>The Wang family's small villa was actually in quite a remote location and hard to find; Xiao Yin had had to take quite a winding route in particular to get here.</p>

    <p>But once he reached the entrance, his expression became much more serious.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei had always treated this villa as a holy place. Based on what he had said, there were some seniors living in seclusion here who had strength even more terrifying than Ling Zhenren's!</p>

    <p>At that moment, Xiao Yin stood nervously in front of the main door with his heart pounding.</p>

    <p>His face was very white; on one hand, it was because of fright, and on the other, he had given up two thousand milliliters of blood last night, which left him feeling a little weak.</p>

    <p>Seniors more terrifying than Master...</p>

    <p>What on earth kind of existence was that?</p>

    <p>It was completely unimaginable to him.</p>

    <p>All of a sudden, a deep sense of powerlessness overwhelmed Xiao Yin. He recalled how in his youth he had directly charged into sects with ten thousand members seven times over... But now, he had to summon up all of his courage just to even ring the bell...</p>

    <p>The world really had changed!</p>

    <p>Why were there so many monsters among the race of human cultivators?!</p>

    <p>While he was hesitating, the villa door suddenly opened, and a woman bent down to place a plate of leftovers next to the door.</p>

    <p>Although the villa's surroundings were a little remote and desolate, there were stray cats around, and Mother Wang would always feed them leftovers.</p>

    <p>Just as she opened the door, Mother Wang saw a silver-haired youngster with a face as white as a foreigner's standing there.</p>

    <p>She stared at Xiao Yin, startled. "This white-faced girl, who are you looking for?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>Then, she carefully looked Xiao Yin up and down before she smiled knowingly. "Are you looking for Ling Ling?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin nodded. "Yes..."</p>

    <p>To be honest, it wasn't like Xiao Yin didn't understand why Mother Wang had mistaken his gender. The human form he cultivated had always been more neutral-looking; along with his long silver hair, it was very easy for people to misunderstand.</p>

    <p>While he was wondering whether to explain or not, Mother Wang suddenly stepped forward to pull on his hand. "Young lady, you don't have to say anything! Auntie understands!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>Then, she directly pulled him inside with a radiant smile on her face.</p>

    <p>Just like this, he had actually entered what Lord Diulei viewed as a holy place?</p>

    <p>When Mother Wang pulled him inside, Xiao Yin felt a little muddled, as he had completely never expected the seniors in this villa to be so easygoing.</p>

    <p>But why was the fluctuation of spirit energy from this senior so weak?</p>

    <p>Hm! She had to be hiding her spirit energy!</p>

    <p>That had to be it!</p>

    <p>Mother Wang led Xiao Yin to the sofa in the living room and then passed him a cup of tea, her face wreathed in smiles. "This young lady, what's your surname?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin sighed in his heart and answered, "My name's Xiao Yin..."</p>

    <p>He had already decided he wasn't going to explain it; doing so in this situation would be even more embarrassing. As long as senior was happy, it was fine!</p>

    <p>Mother Wang glanced at Xiao Yin again.</p>

    <p>Hm... this girl had quite a good figure, but some parts were indeed a little small.</p>

    <p>But this didn't curb Mother Wang's enthusiasm. "Most of the people who've dropped by the villa were Ling Ling's boy friends."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "!!!"</p>

    <p>Mother Wang: "Don't misunderstand, young lady. I mean male friends."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>She clasped Xiao Yin's hands excitedly. "Today, a girl has finally come!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "Senior, I..."</p>

    <p>Mother Wang: "Don't call me senior. Call me auntie!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was taken aback. "Can... Can I?"</p>

    <p>From his understanding, this was a very intimate address! This was the holy place where mysterious great seniors resided! Nowadays, where would you find such a powerful "auntie"?!</p>

    <p>"Why not, it's just a title." Mother Wang couldn't help laughing. "By the way, Miss Xiao Yin, where do you live?"</p>

    <p>"My clan is more used to living in caves... we usually sleep standing up."</p>

    <p>"No wonder you're in such good shape, it's because you stand!" Mother Wang couldn't help exclaiming in surprise.</p>

    <p>As for living in caves, Mother Wang didn't think this was strange. Nowadays, there were people interested in this; the richer a family was, the more interested they were in broadening their horizons. Moreover, there were a lot of stories on TV nowadays about the rich specially digging out caves deep in the forest and transforming them into luxury residences... This was proof on the side that this girl's family background was probably pretty good! It also explained why her skin was so fair!</p>

    <p>Mother Wang thought that this white-faced girl had obviously benefited from a natural influence!</p>

    <p>"If you don't mind, how about staying for a quick lunch?" Mother Wang smiled.</p>

    <p>"Ah? Wouldn't... wouldn't that be troublesome for you?"</p>

    <p>"It's fine, it's fine, just make yourself at home."</p>

    <p>Mother Wang stoop up joyfully. "I'm going to go prepare the ingredients. If you want to look for Ling Ling, he's in the first room on the left on the second floor."</p>

    <p>"Auntie, where are the other seniors..."</p>

    <p>"They're out today, it's just the three of us this afternoon," Mother Wang said.</p>

    <p>"Oh, okay, auntie... then I'm going upstairs first."</p>

    <p>After saying that, Xiao Yin rushed upstairs; he had never expected that he would actually be asked to stay for lunch!</p>

    <p>Mother Wang followed Xiao Yin's back with her eyes as he went upstairs, a good-natured expression on her face.</p>

    <p>From their chat just now, she was pretty satisfied with this white-faced girl!</p>

    <p>Although she was a little small in some parts...</p>

    <p>When Xiao Yin had gone upstairs just now, Mother Wang had noticed that this white-faced girl had a pretty big butt! Big and perky!</p>

    <p>How did the saying go?</p>

    <p>- A big butt was good for bearing children!</p>
