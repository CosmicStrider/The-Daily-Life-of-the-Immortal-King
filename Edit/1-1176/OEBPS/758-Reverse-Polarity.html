  <h1>Chapter 758 Reverse Polarity</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor lay on the ground, enjoying a massage from a soul slave in the "Soul-Repairing Array" with an extremely languid expression on his face.</p>

    <p>President Bai was still kneeling in front of him.</p>

    <p>"I was initially just going to put you away in the soul repository, and then digest you when I had the chance later in order to obtain your recovery ability. But my venerable self changed my mind... do you know why?" Night Ghost Spirit Emperor suddenly spoke a moment later.</p>

    <p>President Bai pursed his lips and said nothing.</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor waited for a moment, and then could only answer his own question. "The Bai clan's Creation Art is the best in the world, as renowned as the Toya clan's Wondrous Alchemy and the Xiao clan's Art of Alchemy. When you failed to steal it from your teacher back then, you would have been put to death by your clan if my venerable self hadn't taken you in as my subordinate. Later, with my tremendous support, you inherited the Bai clan's legacy, which is the reason for your status today."</p>

    <p>President Bai's face instantly darkened. "Your Excellency, what are you trying to say..."</p>

    <p>"If I devour your soul and steal your magic, my venerable self will instantly receive all your memories. But I personally saved you back then, and because of that, my venerable self indeed can't bear to kill you now. While you made a grave mistake this time, my venerable self still remembers our past friendship and has decided to let you live... If I hadn't used the Ten Thousand Li Soul Chaser to keep your soul around, how long do you think you would have been able to hold on against that young man?" Night Ghost Spirit Emperor said.</p>

    <p>President Bai was instantly lost for words.</p>

    <p>Even his body began to tremble despite himself.</p>

    <p>After Wang Ling had defeated him, he would experience this side effect from time to time. Whenever he recalled it... he was filled with dread.</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor chuckled before crooking one finger, and a white jade scroll appeared in the air. President Bai received it with both hands, amazed to find that he could touch the scroll directly in his soul state.</p>

    <p>"This is the Soul Book used for communicating with the spirits."</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor said, "I want you to write down the Creation Art technique in this jade scroll, without changing a single word of the original."</p>

    <p>President Bai finally realized what Night Ghost Spirit Emperor wanted. The expression on his face instantly froze. "This is our Bai clan's secret art..."</p>

    <p>"My venerable self knows that is the secret art of your Bai clan, but do you have any other choice right now?"</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor chuckled darkly. "I know that you guessed I would lock up your soul after you died and then swallow you when I had the chance. So you put a curse on your soul first, isn't that right?"</p>

    <p>President Bai said nothing.</p>

    <p>This curse was already very deeply hidden, but he never thought that Night Ghost Spirit Emperor would still find out about it.</p>

    <p>But originally, this curse wasn't deliberately aimed at President Bai.</p>

    <p>Whoever damaged his soul would be cursed.</p>

    <p>President Bai had initially thought that if he was defeated in the fight against that young man, and the latter refused to let go of his soul, he could at least place a curse on him; leaving him plagued by disasters and ongoing bad luck could be considered President Bai's revenge.</p>

    <p>As for Night Ghost Spirit Emperor's fanciful notion, it actually did make sense.</p>

    <p>While this curse hadn't initially been aimed at Night Ghost Spirit Emperor, it did in fact act as a guard against him.</p>

    <p>So when President Bai had set up this curse in the beginning, he had already thought of various follow-up possibilities...</p>

    <p>"Bai Zhe, you are indeed pretty smart, but you're still inexperienced compared with my venerable self. As long as you write down the Bai clan's Creation Art in its entirety, I will naturally let bygones be bygones. I can even reconstruct a physical body and you can keep your life."</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor raised his hand and a soul pen dropped down. His tone brooked no argument. "So, will you write it down?"</p>

    <p>President Bai took a deep breath.</p>

    <p>There was no way for him to refuse, and he set about doing it...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>This Creation Art was a new technique which was developed during the golden age of the Bai clan and later revered as an ancestral secret technique.</p>

    <p>In the clan, President Bai was originally just the son of a concubine, and so never had the chance to learn it. His mother had had a lowly status; she was just a singer who had accidentally obtained favor - even when she died, she couldn't enter the clan's memorial hall, and he could only place her memorial tablet in his bedroom.</p>

    <p>As he wrote down the secret technique, Bai Zhe remembered the moment he had first encountered Night Ghost Spirit Emperor. At that time, Night Chief had just started out and Night Ghost Spirit Emperor had been recruiting people from all over, and had chanced upon the in-fighting in the Bai clan.</p>

    <p>As for why Night Ghost Spirit Emperor had chosen him in the end, President Bai had been investigating the reason for it for the last century, and had finally learned the truth.</p>

    <p>"Your Excellency, I have finished." Soon enough, Bai Zhe presented the jade scroll.</p>

    <p>The creation of an ordinary spell was little more than a few core rules and formulas. Night Ghost Spirit Emperor had a very high opinion of himself; writing down every little detail would conversely annoy the other party. Thus, Bai Zhe just wrote down the core formulas of the spell on the scroll, which made Night Ghost Spirit Emperor's eyes light up.</p>

    <p>All spells shared the same basic formula - the essence was made up of core rules and formulas, like the universal 4536251 chord routine in music.</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor was very satisfied with President Bai's display. "Bai Zhe, you're a smart man."</p>

    <p>"Your Excellency flatters me." President Bai was expressionless. He knelt on the ground in the manner of a slave who listened obediently to everything his master said, like a well-behaved puppy.</p>

    <p>This scene made Night Ghost Spirit Emperor sigh. The reason he had chosen Bai Zhe in the beginning was because of his defiant nature. Who knew that after being thrown into the soul repository, this character trait of Bai Zhe's would be worn down.</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor stared at this scene in deep disappointment.</p>

    <p>But this was actually also good; it was at least another reason for him to keep Bai Zhe alive...</p>

    <p>At that point, almost forty percent of Night Ghost Spirit Emperor's injured soul had recovered, and he now had enough strength. He got up from the ground and started to learn the core formulas for the Creation Spell which Bai Zhe had given to him.</p>

    <p>A genuine True Immortal expert could learn spells at heaven-defying speeds.</p>

    <p>This was especially true of an old veteran like Night Ghost Spirit Emperor. In just a few glances, he was able to break these formulas down and absorb them as he learned them at the speed of light.</p>

    <p>A flood of green spirit energy turned into steam as they rose from Night Ghost Spirit Emperor's seven orifices.</p>

    <p>"So this is the Bai clan's Creation Art?" Night Ghost Spirit Emperor was utterly pleased as his injuries healed at an astonishing rate!</p>

    <p>But this delight didn't last long before he quickly realized that something wasn't right... While his physical injuries were healing rapidly, it seemed like his soul was falling apart...</p>

    <p>Suddenly, everything in front of him turned black and he felt exhausted and weak.</p>

    <p>At that moment, President Bai finally got up and smiled. "Your Excellency Spirit Emperor, is my Bai's Creation Art still useful?"</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor finally realized the cause of this abnormality.</p>

    <p>Eyes wide, he glared at President Bai. "What did you do?"</p>

    <p>"Back then, Your Excellency viewed the Bai clan as a huge threat and wiped out the entire clan, and left me alive to become your loyal dog... But Your Excellency, you should have investigated the history of the Bai clan carefully before you wiped out my family." Hands behind his back, President Bai had a pleased expression on his face. "I wonder if Your Excellency has heard of 'reverse polarity' before?"</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor seemed to realize something, and his expression finally turned alarmed.</p>

    <p>This Bai Zhe...</p>

    <p>Was shady, as expected!!!!</p>

    <p>"It seems that Your Excellency has already guessed the secret of the Creation Art." President Bai narrowed his eyes and smiled. "Lastly, thank you for your body, Your Excellency. After this... it's mine!"</p>
