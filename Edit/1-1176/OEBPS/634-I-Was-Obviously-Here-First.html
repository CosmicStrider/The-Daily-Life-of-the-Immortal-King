  <h1>Chapter 634 I Was Obviously Here First!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The surprise... was a little much...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin's appearance directly made Elder Zuo Wu's blood vessels explode one after another, exacerbating his injury. He had no idea how this silver-haired young man had found this place, but at that moment, his entire head dripped with cold sweat and he didn't have time to bother about what technique this silver-haired young man had used.</p>

    <p>This scene was projected into the SUV by Xiao Yin. When Lord Diulei saw where Xiao Yin's clone was, he felt that this basement supermarket seemed somewhat familiar...</p>

    <p>Wait...</p>

    <p>Wasn't this the place which the old devil and the Master of Shadow Stream had used as a hideout and ordered takeout from...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei carefully identified the surroundings and confirmed that he wasn't mistaken.</p>

    <p>He then took a deep breath and couldn't help sighing in his heart: Amazingly, history indeed repeated itself...</p>

    <p>In fact, it hadn't been long since the old devil was arrested. There had been a long and tedious trial between his imprisonment and the final sentence. Generally speaking, something like this took roughly from half a year to a year, but beginning with the old devil up until now, quite a number of individuals had already been put into Songhai First Prison one after another: Jiang Liuying, the sister of the Master of Shadow Stream, had been the first to go in, and then the old devil and the Master of Shadow Stream herself, Jiang Liuyue.</p>

    <p>After that, Cheng Yu, the Master of Immortal Mansion, and Evil Sword God had also been sent there one after another; as important prisoners, they were put in Spirit Shackles before they were locked up in the same special cell with the old devil.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, Lord Diulei was a little curious: If President Bai was captured and also put in jail... Three people could only play "Fight theLandlord <sup>1</sup> ," but four people could play mahjong!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Fight the Landlord ('Dou Di Zhu') is a Chinese card game.)</dfn>

    <p>"Brother Xiao, leave him alive, this is a good chance for us to catch President Bai," said Lord Diulei as he steadily drove his SUV.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin nodded. "Okay, I'll try my best."</p>

    <p>While this was just a clone and wouldn't exhibit all of Xiao Yin's strength, Elder Zuo Wu was now seriously injured. If he struggled or resisted, his injury might be aggravated and even become life-threatening, so Xiao Yin wanted to try persuading him.</p>

    <p>"I can instantly heal your internal injury without any side effects, if you're willing to come with me." Xiao Yin stared at Elder Zuo Wu as he made the offer. An internal injury of this degree only required a few drops of his holy blood to be completely healed.</p>

    <p>But the look in Elder Zuo Wu's eyes was full of defiance, and it was clear that he had no intention of surrendering.</p>

    <p>Although Xiao Yin's offer was indeed very tempting...</p>

    <p>Elder Zuo Wu wasn't a fool. Judging from the silver-haired young man's current attitude, it was clear that the other party had no plans to kill him. Instead, the other party was urging him to surrender so that he could give up information on the "Demon Hunters Association" and President Bai.</p>

    <p>Elder Zuo Wu now suddenly understood why Mr Lu was missing.</p>

    <p>Considering the other party's methods, it was highly likely that Mr Lu had been persuaded to surrender and was now heavily guarded as a witness.</p>

    <p>"You've already hidden Mr Lu, haven't you?" Elder Zuo Wu clutched his chest as his qi and blood rolled inside him.</p>

    <p>The moment Elder Zuo Wu spoke, Lord Diulei couldn't help raising his eyebrows. He felt like he could understand why President Bai was willing to keep this Elder Zuo Wu around despite his mediocre realm; it was precisely because Elder Zuo Wu was very intelligent. Sometimes, a high realm didn't mean keen enough insight. Any expert who was difficult to handle was bound to have someone by their side acting as a strategist and intelligent think tank.</p>

    <p>It was clear that Elder Zuo Wu was this type of person.</p>

    <p>It was just unfortunate that their intelligence was often their downfall. Stashing away the invisible flying swords earlier instead of choosing to completely use all of them was a prime example of a miscalculation by this smart Elder Zuo Wu.</p>

    <p>While Xiao Yin didn't say anything, Elder Zuo Wu already knew the answer from the look in his eyes.</p>

    <p>His gaze was fixed on Xiao Yin. Even in this situation, he didn't show the slightest bit of hesitation. "I advise you to give up. Mr Lu and I are at the same level in the association, but I will never give in as easily as he did... A demon tribe in the end is a demon tribe. Once they get scared, they'll surrender. They don't have any backbone at all! If you think I'll agree blindly like them, you're dead wrong!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin pursed his lips; he hadn't expected this Elder Zuo Wu to be so strong-willed.</p>

    <p>"You have no idea how long I've been with President Bai..." Elder Zuo Wu clenched his fists tight. He didn't care at all whether other people understood him or not.</p>

    <p>When he had been at his lowest point back then, it was President Bai who took him in. To be able to possess the realm he had today was all because of President Bai. He was one of the first members of the Demon Hunters Association when it was founded and he had devoted a lot of time to its development.</p>

    <p>He had felt that he was already President Bai's trusted aide, but had never expected President Bai to actually have this beautiful man beside him. Elder Zuo Wu thought he had a record of all the elders of the Demon Hunters Association in his mental notebook, but "Ji Xing"... who on earth was this person?</p>

    <p>He had done so much for the president for so many years, yet in spite of that, he hadn't gained President Bai's full trust...</p>

    <p>Elder Zuo Wu's heart hurt badly and he felt cold â€” he had obviously been here first! Why was that person so familiar with the president?</p>

    <p>The more he thought about it, the more agitated Elder Zuo Wu became. It was just slight tremors in his heart at first before his body ultimately shook with uncontrollable anger. Even his eyes misted over with the color of blood.</p>

    <p>Something wasn't right about this condition, which made Xiao Yin frown deeply.</p>

    <p>"Do you know..." Elder Zuo Wu stared fixedly at Xiao Yin with very red eyes.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "???"</p>

    <p>"I can die for the president!" Elder Zuo Wu said resolutely.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin sweated. "Brother... brother, you need to calm down, pal..."</p>

    <p>But Elder Zuo Wu already couldn't hear him any longer. His entire being had already transformed at the question in his own heart just now. Even his mental state had changed, at that moment when that man called "Ji Xing" had given him that look before leaving; that expression haunted his thoughts like a nightmare.</p>

    <p>Elder Zuo Wu sneered, his face tinged purple and white from his internal injury, and it gave Xiao Yin a forbidding chill. "Don't think you can get any information out of me... I'll die to prove my loyalty to the president."</p>

    <p>Right after that, he actually reached directly into the crotch of his trousers and took out a magic artifact the size of a marble.</p>

    <p>This was a Tian Gang <sup>2</sup> Grenade! It was a very rare explosive magic weapon which contained the Thunder of Heavenly Tribulation from ascending to the Soul Formation stage, a tremendous power!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Ranked second of the 36 Heavenly Spirits and one of the 108 Stars of Destiny in the Chinese cultural imagination.)</dfn>

    <p>Lord Diulei was taken aback. This person... actually hid a grenade in the crotch of his trousers <sup>3</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(From a TV drama which sparked political and moral controversy following a scene of a female character hiding a grenade in her pants while visiting her husband in a jail guarded by Japanese soldiers ..)</dfn>
