  <h1>Chapter 430 Light Chaser </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Live streaming was in fact currently a flourishing industry in the cultivation world, with various types of live streams popping up like mushrooms. In any industry, however, while there were so many people doing the same thing, there were very few that could truly do a good job; some small live streamers could only drum up a pitiful several thousand fans even after more than half a year since they started.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling calculated the time. It had probably been around nine o'clock when they'd finished discussing things in the three-person group chat... Then, in less than an hour after that, Taoist Guang had come across "live streaming" as a fresh source of entertainment for him.</p>

    <p>Actually, Wang Ling understood Taoist Guang; after all, he had been alone in the soul space for so long, from when he had been full of ambition in the beginning as he looked forward to finding the predestined person who would get him through the Samsara Spirit Tribulation, to seeing through everything and wanting to obtain a corporeal body and free himself. Frankly speaking, loneliness was to be blamed.</p>

    <p>Interaction through live streaming was actually a good way of alleviating that loneliness.</p>

    <p>When Taoist Guang had first encountered live streaming, he had initially planned to look for other people to open one together. However, in less than twelve hours, his live stream audience numbers had broken the one million mark, which was something that a lot of live streamers could barely imagine... Wang Ling didn't know if Taoist Guang had any concept of live streaming popularity, but in a sense, he had already created history this year.</p>

    <p>The number of people in the live stream room continued to grow, and simply skyrocketed at a visible rate.</p>

    <p>Usually, when the number of people reached a certain level, such as one hundred thousand or two hundred thousand, the live stream would continue to go viral at a rapid rate in line with the increase in viewers.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, the ID "Lord Island" which Taoist Guang had registered with on the cultivation live streaming platform was a new ID that had never appeared on the platform before.</p>

    <p>The ID registration date was public, and in the beginning, a lot of people mistakenly believed that some big live streamer was using a registered side account to spoof fans in collusion with the live streaming website. But when they clicked on it, they realized that this wasn't the case. That was because it was an outdoor live stream, and most importantly, the person in the live stream was an old man in white with bare feet who looked a little like a transcendent being...</p>

    <p>"We are witnessing the birth of a legendary live streamer!" Chen Chao and Guo Hao were excitedly following the live stream room's rapid climb in popularity.</p>

    <p>"There hasn't been any sort of phenomenal live streamer this year - who would have thought that this Lord Island would actually become so popular so late in his life..." Su Xiao was so amazed that he even forgot to collect homework.</p>

    <p>It had still been a million users in the live stream just now, but after their short exchange of words, it was already over one and a half million! Too terrifying!</p>

    <p>Audience numbers continued to increase, and the bullet messages were particularly terrifying. If there wasn't a limit on the number of bullet messages that could be sent, it would have already become an ocean of bullet messages, drowning the entire live stream room...</p>

    <p>From 666 and 233 <sup>1</sup> in the beginning to the increasing number of fancy bullet messages now, after the start of Lord Island's "stewing myself in an iron pot" performance, it was complete pandemonium on the screen.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>('233' means 'hilarious.')</dfn>

    <p>"Stew himself in an iron pot, win millions of people! Lord Island is awesome!"</p>

    <p>"Almighty bullet messages! Does anyone know which island the live streamer is on now?"</p>

    <p>"Lord Island has the air of a transcendent being, he must be a master!"</p>

    <p>"Begging for Lord Island's Taoist name!"</p>

    <p>A lot of people who had purely thought it was interesting at the beginning were now fanatically following Lord Island's live stream room as they started to pay real attention to the old man's identity.</p>

    <p>Standing in the pot, Taoist Guang saw more and more questions on the screen. Naturally, he wasn't stupid; there was no way he would give out his true Taoist name, "Taoist Guang." He hadn't even completed the real name authentication for his account, so the live stream room couldn't give him large gifts; each user ID could only gift him a maximum of ten HNY a day, and there were some rich fans in the bullet messages who couldn't tolerate it. Since the beginning, however, all Taoist Guang had wanted to do was purely have fun.</p>

    <p>"Don't panic, everyone, let me set up a fan tag <sup>2</sup> . If you are interested in this old man, then get a fan tag!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(These are like 'titles' that viewers can buy to identify themselves as fans of a particular live streamer.)</dfn>

    <p>Inside the pot, Taoist Guang stretched out his hand and very quickly set up a fan tag with two words: Light Chaser <sup>3</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>('Guang' is the Chinese word for 'light.')</dfn>

    <p>"I can't take it anymore! Gift!" This was from Guo Hao. After seeing Lord Island put out a fan tag, he instantly chose to give a gift of ten HNY to get one.</p>

    <p>One HNY was equivalent to one hundred fan points, so ten HNY was equal to one thousand fan points... This was the minimum requirement to receive a fan tag.</p>

    <p>Initially, the limit on gift-giving was a measure put in place by live streaming platforms to encourage live streamers to authenticate their real names. This was because the live streaming platforms had background systems that could connect to the Ministry of Public Security's background data to allow them to find out whether live streamers had criminal records or not.</p>

    <p>For those who didn't have clean records, the live streaming platforms would usually refuse to sign them on, like the live streamer who had been banned just a few days ago, Baboon...</p>

    <p>But for live streamers who were doing it purely for fun and didn't care about profit at all, the existence of this "gift restriction" mechanism meant nothing to them. Perhaps even the platform itself never expected that a new live streamer called "Lord Island" would blow up overnight.</p>

    <p>Ten HNY was peanuts, but audience numbers were massive!</p>

    <p>Ten HNY per person was a considerable profit for the platform...</p>

    <p>Less than ten minutes after Taoist Guang had set up the fan tag, hundreds of thousands of people had already given him gifts and become "Light Chasers"...</p>

    <p>Chen Chao couldn't resist taking out his phone to give him a gift. "I'm going to be a Light Chaser too!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling saw that the screen was already covered with various bullet messages reflecting this "Light Chaser" fan tag: "The Iron Pot of Light,""Refining Weapons of Light,""Survival of Light" and so on...</p>

    <p>Su Xiao tsked. "I say, exactly what kind of person do you think this Lord Island is?"</p>

    <p>"Lord Island has a mysterious identity; I think he might be a Soul Formation cultivator..." Chen Chao guessed.</p>

    <p>Su Xiao tsked again. "Are all Soul Formation seniors nowadays into pursuing self-entertainment that much? Shouldn't they be like General Yi, and go water their flowers in their spare time? Besides, General Yi is a legendary True Immortal!"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao laughed. "Do you think everyone's realms are as high as General Yi's? If you truly become a True Immortal and are able to appreciate the nuances of being one with nature... there is no way you would feel lonely! Anyway, I think this Lord Island is very interesting!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>At that moment, Guo Hao suddenly swore. "Lord Island said that he's going to eat chicken on the live stream at noon today!"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "Eating Chicken of Light?!"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "It's Time Chicken <sup>4</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>4</sup>('Guang' is also used in the word for time, 'shi guang .. ' Time Chicken is a cartoon chicken from the comic series 'One Hundred Thousand Bad Jokes,' which parodies classic stories)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Su Xiao: "..."</p>
