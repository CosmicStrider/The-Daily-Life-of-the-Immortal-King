  <h1>Chapter 578 Wei Zhi Is Dangerous</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Lord Diulei finished singing the entire song "The Starry Sky's Language of Love." He played the piano as he sang for the audio recording. His voice was clear and attractive. Dazed when he heard it, Xiao Yin couldn't help coming over to watch. Although he had thought Lord Diulei was pretty good when he had heard him sing before, Xiao Yin never expected him to be this good.</p>

    <p>This voice was really sweet! This person was already thousands of years old, but his voice still sounded like that of a eighteen-year-old young man who had just fallen in love.</p>

    <p>There was plenty of minor spells and elixirs in the cultivation world for embellishing one's voice, but the results were like Nanhan nation's plastic surgery - they were all the same. In the entertainment circle nowadays, the more popular singers were those that still relied solely on their voices to hit it big.</p>

    <p>Each person's voice was different and you needed something special in order to become popular.</p>

    <p>"Thunder, Thunder, you sing so well!" Xiao Yin leaned against the wall with his arms folded as he happily listened to the song.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei closed the piano lid and let out a sigh. "I actually thought about debuting as a singer before, but in the end I gave up."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin didn't understand. "Why?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei took a deep breath. "Because I'm too good! I should leave some opportunities for the youngsters."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "If I debut, Fang Jielun, Zhou Wenshan, they would be nothing<sup>1</sup>..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Mixing up the names of singer Zhou Jielun and lyricist Fang Wenshan, who have worked together before.)</dfn>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "Did you write this song?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei shook his head. "It was Senior Wang who wrote the lyrics for his wife. Brother Ling composed the melody and I sang the demo."</p>

    <p>"So it was Master's master who wrote it!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin's eyes shone; he recalled the melody and he suddenly looked envious. "So romantic, it reminds me of a poem! I've been studying Huaxiu's ancient culture recently, and it's truly deep and profound!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei raised an eyebrow. "Let's hear it."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin blurted out, "A hundred years of cultivation bring two to ride in the same boat..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Lord Diulei was about to praise Xiao Yin for his progress in learning about modern human civilization.</p>

    <p>In the end, Xiao Yin's next words were: "A thousand years of cultivation bring Atom<sup>2</sup>."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Continuing from above, the second part of this saying should be "A thousand years of cultivation bring two to sleep on the same pillow," which refers to the Chinese concept of fateful or destined meetings. Here it refers to the beloved protagonist of the popular anime series Astro Boy..)</dfn>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>That night, Er Ha had dinner at Wei Zhi's place. When it followed Wei Zhi in, the security guards downstairs at the family apartment smiled and gazed at it warmly. This was a dog personally endorsed by the marshal and no one dared give it dirty looks. Actually, Wei Zhi thought Er Ha was especially amiable; it was just that the color of its fur looked strange at first, but the more you looked, the more pleasing it became to the eye.</p>

    <p>As they passed by an apartment unit downstairs, Er Ha saw an old lady carrying a shopping basket. "Little Wei, you've brought your dog friend over to play again?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, Auntie Zhao."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi greeted this old lady.</p>

    <p>Looking up at this "Auntie Zhao," Er Ha was immediately on guard because it felt that this person was very strong. There was a particular air about her that Er Ha as a spirit beast could sense almost instantly and it felt that this old auntie's identity wasn't that simple.</p>

    <p>But the other party didn't pay Er Ha too much mind and instead, she smiled broadly as if seeing an old friend.</p>

    <p>Er Ha guessed that word had most likely gotten around the apartment that Marshal Jiang had given it "special privilege" at the entrance last time. In this type of family apartment, there would be a lot of old aunties and uncles who liked to discuss the daily gossip in their spare time.</p>

    <p>Everyone in the family apartment knew Martial Jiang's "Battle Saint" identity. He was one of the Ten Founding Generals! Every word he said had weight!</p>

    <p>Er Ha was silent; it didn't know if this was a good or bad thing. After being with Little Master Ling for a while, there were times when it also felt that it was good to stay low-key.</p>

    <p>However, this Auntie Zhao smiled at it and then paused to rub the soft fur on its head in passing. "Your dog friend seems a bit nervous." Extremely clean and fresh spirit energy spread out from this Auntie Zhao's palm, which was an extremely cozy feeling.</p>

    <p>Damn, it was so comfortable...</p>

    <p>As expected, this old auntie wasn't simple.</p>

    <p>Staring at this Auntie Zhao, Er Ha wanted to say something but didn't know how to bring it up.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, any friend of Little Zhi's, whether human or beast, is fine," said Auntie Zhao. "The people in our apartment watched him grow up. Old Jiang greeted you at the entrance the last time, and from now on you can come and go as you like here, so you don't have to be too nervous... we're the ones who should be nervous."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "What's going on, Auntie Zhao?"</p>

    <p>Aunt Zhao: "You're so big already... it's been so many years, but have you ever brought a girlfriend to the apartment? We seriously thought..."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "Auntie, my taste is not that heavy."</p>

    <p>Aunt Zhao: "That's good then."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>"... Auntie Zhao, where are you going?" asked Wei Zhi.</p>

    <p>"Mm, the neighborhood committee's Old Jiang called just now to say that a foreign force is invading our border and wants me to go over and handle it since he's tied up with something else." Auntie Zhao covered her mouth and laughed. "I'll be right back."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi nodded like he was used to it. "Okay, be careful, Auntie Zhao."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, this basket isn't for food. Do you know the flying guillotine? This is an upgraded version. When you throw it out, it'll directly behead people! To throw the enemy off, I improved its appearance," said Auntie Zhao.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha thought that this "Auntie Zhao" was talking about something very frightening with a serene face.</p>

    <p>Because Auntie Zhao was in a hurry to deal with this important task, she didn't pull Wei Zhi into conversation for too long. This could already be considered going lenient on him. There were times when Wei Zhi was afraid of running into some overzealous old aunties and uncles, because once they caught him for a chat, he wouldn't be able to escape for at least half an hour.</p>

    <p>After this, Auntie Zhao took her leave. Er Ha saw her walk to the main entrance and in a flash of light, she disappeared completely.</p>

    <p>"Who is this auntie?" Er Ha was very curious about this mysterious old auntie.</p>

    <p>"Auntie Zhao was Uncle Jiang's secretary back then and has always followed him. Her Daoist name is Holy Lotus Daoist," answered Wei Zhi.</p>

    <p>Er Ha turned this name over in its mind but couldn't recall hearing it before; it was probably a pretty old Daoist name.</p>

    <p>Also, ever since these old seniors had left their positions and retired, they no longer called each other by their Daoist names. Over time, some of these legendary Daoist names had faded from the minds of the young people and it was probably only the older generation that still knew them.</p>

    <p>Looking at Er Ha's puzzled expression, Wei Zhi suddenly brought up a name. "Do you know Cailian Zhenren?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha nodded its head. "I do!" Of course it knew this person; she was the only female cultivator in Lord Diulei's group chat... Also, she had once attacked Little Master Ling when he was ten years old with her boobs...</p>

    <p>Pressing the button for the elevator, Wei Zhi said lightly, "This Auntie Zhao is Cailian Zhenren's shifu."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>This world was really small!</p>

    <p>Er Ha couldn't help lamenting.</p>
