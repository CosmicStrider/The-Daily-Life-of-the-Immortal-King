  <h1>Chapter 412 Modern Rules of Sacrifice </h1>

  <div>

    <p>At the abandoned construction site opposite the Wang family's small villa, Wang Ling had already drawn a sacrificial magic array; the array characters were very complex, and they flashed with a dim golden light.</p>

    <p>But Lord Diulei couldn't see these characters even with his Heavenly Eye open; he could only see some basic array runes.</p>

    <p>This sacrificial array was also exclusive to the "Great Sacrifice Spell." The true core characters that were used to set up the array were derived from the heavenly character script of the Three Thousand Great Spells; even a True Immortal would find it hard to pick out the array characters of this type of supreme spell.</p>

    <p>"What type of spell is this anyway?" Lord Diulei was very curious.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "It's also my first time seeing Little Master Ling use it. Let's just watch."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling put the Soul Suppression Ring in the middle of the sacrificial array, which was where the eye of the array was. Then he placed the computer which Lord Diulei had bought a meter away from the eye.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei noticed that Wang Ling actually didn't use the Gravitation Spell, and personally placed the computer in the sacrificial array by hand. He felt that there had to be some profound reason for this!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was so strong that even Taoist Guang, who was a True Immortal, revered him deeply... The young man in white thought he must have saved the world in a previous life to be able to call such a friend his brother.</p>

    <p>It was clear that he still had a lot to learn...</p>

    <p>Actually, Lord Diulei had been thinking about a lot of things these last few days, and had been studying assiduously for the sake of cultivation.</p>

    <p>He studied the broccoli that Old Senior Wang had given him... not only had he planted more, he had even developed a safe stimulant that wasn't the least bit toxic for inducing the broccoli to grow quickly... but unfortunately, he had yet to comprehend the way of Tao.</p>

    <p>He also wore the long johns that Mother Wang had given to him, and was reluctant to take them off... but unfortunately, he had yet to comprehend the way of Tao...</p>

    <p>Then why on earth was he stuck at his current level?</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei felt that the biggest problem probably had to do with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>If the reason why Ling Zhenren was so powerful was because he lived with these great seniors in this villa... then, given that Lord Diulei had met all the objective conditions for comprehending the way of Tao, he suddenly realized that the real key to understanding was to learn from Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>That was why he was now especially fixated on Wang Ling's every move.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, what are you doing?" he couldn't help asking when he saw that Wang Ling had yet to do anything after putting the notebook in its packaging in the middle of the array.</p>

    <p>As always, Wang Ling said succinctly, "Burn."</p>

    <p>"Burn?"</p>

    <p>On one side, both Lord Diulei and Er Ha had blank expressions.</p>

    <p>Then the young man in white and the green-furred dog at his feet saw several licks of flame emerge from Wang Ling's fingers... With a flick of his fingers, the flames shot down at the brand new notebook in its packaging box.</p>

    <p>"Hu!" The flames burst into a blaze!</p>

    <p>In a split second, the flames engulfed the entire packaging box, and just like that, the brand new notebook turned into a ball of flying ash...</p>

    <p>After he was done, Wang Ling once again picked up the Soul Suppression Ring from the center of the array and said in his indifferent, telepathic voice, "The sacrifice is complete."</p>

    <p>"The notebook..."</p>

    <p>"I've already sent it off by burning it."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>One man and one dog were directly dumbstruck. It turned out this was how the Great Sacrifice Spell was used?!</p>

    <p>It was as if Lord Diulei was already imagining a scene several thousand years into the future... One of his heirs would be kneeling before a small fire in a sacrificial magic array identical to the one that Wang Ling had set up and crying, Grandpa, the author of that eunuch novel<sup>1</sup> you were reading has resumed updates! I'll burn it for you!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Eunuch novels refer to serialized novels that suddenly stop updating or are cut off halfway.)</dfn>

    <p>At this thought, Lord Diulei couldn't help but shudder.</p>

    <p>"..." Er Ha knew that it was very likely that Lord Diulei was imagining some strange thing again.</p>

    <p>On the side, Wang Ling stared at the Soul Suppression Ring and sighed deeply in his heart.</p>

    <p>The notebook had already been burnt for Taoist Guang, with the Shadow Remnant Stone tutorial that Lord Diulei had prepared stored inside the packaging box, so that both things were burnt and sent to Taoist Guang together.</p>

    <p>As for how long it would take for Taoist Guang to learn the notebook's basic functions... that would depend on his luck.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling knew that they couldn't hurry the situation along. After all, the elderly were a little slower to absorb new things, and deserved more patience...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei had initially planned to have a chat with Taoist Guang face to face, but who would have thought that they would run into this problem. Thus, there was no point in him continuing to linger at the Wang family's small villa.</p>

    <p>Before burning the notebook, Lord Diulei and Wang Ling had set up a private discussion group, and had helped Taoist Guang apply for an account before directly pulling him into the discussion group.</p>

    <p>As for the username and password, Lord Diulei had already explained in the Shadow Remnant Stone that once Taoist Guang learned this operation, he should be able to go online himself.</p>

    <p>Hence, instead of waiting around here, Lord Diulei thought that he should use this time to send those holy weapon-grade magic rings that Wang Ling had given him to the other people in the chat group one by one.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had burned the notebook just after ten o'clock, and Lord Diulei left the villa at eleven o'clock. Standing on the second floor, Wang Ling saw the young man in white kiss the Soul Suppression Rings in his hand as he left happily...</p>

    <p>It wasn't long after Lord Diulei's departure that Wang Ling suddenly found that the chat group had come alive.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Everyone, I have a surprise for each one of you!"</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren: "What kind of surprise?"</p>

    <p>Lightning Dharmaraja: "Welfare benefits? But it's not Chinese New Year!"</p>

    <p>It wasn't as if Lord Diulei hadn't distributed welfare benefits in the group in the past, but right now they weren't celebrating any festival or the Chinese New Year... so it was indeed a little strange.</p>

    <p>Stunned, Immortal Toya sent a large sweatdrop emoji. "Can it be that Senior Immortal lost a bet and has to share photos of him crossdressing in the group?"</p>

    <p>Lightning Dharmaraja immediately said, "I think that's highly possible!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei didn't care in the slightest. He just sent several smileys. "Mm... You'll know when I find you! I'm sending them to you one by one now. Everybody will have one!"</p>

    <p>Lightning Dharmaraja sent an amused face. "Senior Immortal... You don't have to specially come over to give me a photo of you crossdressing."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>After Lightning Dharmaraja sent this, the group instantly fell into silence.</p>

    <p>Because usually, anyone who teased the group's owner would most likely be banned from speaking... And in this group, it was no one else but the death-courting little expert Lightning Dharmaraja who dared challenge the group owner's authority.</p>

    <p>However, contrary to everyone's expectations...</p>

    <p>Not only did Lord Diulei not reply this time, he also didn't even ban Lightning Dharmaraja from speaking.</p>

    <p>Lightning Dharmaraja was shocked. "What... What is this situation?"</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren tsked. "Looks like Senior Immortal is especially happy today... I remember the last time Senior Immortal sent a string of smileys was when he'd received a gift from his ex-girlfriend..."</p>

    <p>However, less than two seconds after Cailian Zhenren had sent this message, she instantly tapped the "Recall" tab.</p>

    <p>Lightning Dharmaraja: "I saw it..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "Saw it..."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing: "Saw it."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "I feel like I saw something really amazing!"</p>

    <p>Bulang Blade Immortal: "Damn it! I saw it!"</p>

    <p>Nine Times Man: "Amazing..."</p>

    <p>Ling Zhenren: "..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren hadn't expected that there would be so many lurkers... even Ling Zhenren was around...</p>

    <p>This was a bit embarrassing because she had promised Lord Diulei before that she wouldn't talk about it, but she had been careless and hadn't been able to hold back just now.</p>

    <p>Just as she was about to say something to smooth over the embarrassment, Lord Diulei actually sent a voice message to the group.</p>

    <p>He had also typed something out underneath it.</p>

    <p>This is a song that has been popular recently called Take You on a Journey.<sup>2</sup></p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(A Chinese song with a cheerful tone..)</dfn>

    <p>And this voice message was of Lord Diulei singing it...</p>
