  <h1>Chapter 782 Sky-Battering Cry</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wu Zhenjun's Sky-Battering Cry was the unique technique which had made Irascible Dharmaraja famous.</p>

    <p>When they had been trading words earlier, Wang Ming had already used Wang Ling One to analyze Wu Zhenjun's data.</p>

    <p>Looking at the global database in the Head of State 001 microchip, Wang Ming could easily investigate the data on Wu Zhenjun's past battles and do an analytical comparison to understand the skill which Wu Zhenjun was best at.</p>

    <p>The Sky-Shattering Cry was a high grade, level four sound wave spell.</p>

    <p>This wasn't his most powerful technique; this was the fifth of all the skills he was the most proficient in.</p>

    <p>When it was aimed at a vital point, it could easily shoot dead a Nascent Soul expert.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling One could easily obtain the data on all the skills which Wu Zhenjun had demonstrated in public before from the global database.</p>

    <p>Hence, the moment Wu Zhenjun made a move, Wang Ming accurately and swiftly formulated a countermeasure in response.</p>

    <p>Many cultivators had dynamic vision while Wang Ming didn't, but the Wang Ling One helmet had a formidable built-in ability to break down what it was seeing and quickly offer a clear visual.</p>

    <p>In Wang Ming's eyes, the Sky-Battering Cry's white Blue Dragon became very slow, and he could fully move sideways to avoid the attack.</p>

    <p>But he didn't choose to do so.</p>

    <p>Hovering in the air, he opened his palm. With a hiss, something that looked like an electromagnetic wave glowed around his fingers to form a magnetic shield in front of Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>The Blue Dragon rammed into the magnetic shield head-on. It struck the shield, which looked as fragile as a cicada's wings, with an ear-piercing sound, and countless sparks flared.</p>

    <p>Contrary to everyone's expectations, this weak-looking magnetic shield was unexpectedly strong as it perfectly blocked Wu Zhenjun's attack!</p>

    <p>Following this, Wang Ming heaved a sigh and gazed at Wu Zhenjun on the ground, a disappointed look in his eyes. "You only used fifty percent of your strength?"</p>

    <p>"Lao Gudong Xiaoer, I think it would be better if we stop now." Wu Zhenjun lowered his voice.</p>

    <p>But in his view, Wang Ming's mecha was really something. As an ordinary man, he could actually block a sound wave spell powerful enough to severely injure a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p>

    <p>Wu Zhenjun had to admit that he had indeed underestimated Wang Ming's invention.</p>

    <p>However, when he heard Wang Ming's dissatisfaction with his attack, he was a little annoyed.</p>

    <p>"Wu Zhenjun, I hope you can treat this fight seriously, otherwise you'll lose face in front of your students," Wang Ming reminded him kindly from the air.</p>

    <p>Almost in a flash in the next moment, Wang Ming lifted his arm to aim at him.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling One had already automatically locked onto Wu Zhenjun.</p>

    <p>And then, a cannon muzzle opened in Wang Ming's palm and fired, and that white Blue Dragon which had been launched by the Sky-Battering Cry, actually reappeared as it abruptly charged forth in Wu Zhenjun's direction.</p>

    <p>At that time, countless curses burst out on the scene.</p>

    <p>"What the hell?! Sky-Battering Cry?"</p>

    <p>"What the hell?! This armor can also learn?"</p>

    <p>"What the hell?! Gusu Murong<sup>1</sup>?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(From the MMORPG "Age of Wushu.")</dfn>

    <p>"This is a Shield Reflect! It's absolutely a Shield Reflect<sup>2</sup>!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(From "Legend of Zelda.")</dfn>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>This move also gave Wu Zhenjun a scare.</p>

    <p>When Irascible Dhamaraja had passed this technique down to him, it had taken Wu Zhenjun a very long time to learn the considerably complex formulas for using it. Yet this mecha armor was actually able to analyze his sound wave spell?</p>

    <p>How was that possible?</p>

    <p>Wu Zhenjun frowned.</p>

    <p>He was a master of sound wave magic, and just as he could use it, he naturally knew how to dispel it. To intercept this kind of sound wave spell, the best thing to do was to alter its medium of transmission.</p>

    <p>A huge majority of sound wave spells traveled through the air.</p>

    <p>"Universal Dust Release Spell<sup>3</sup>!" Wu Zhenjun shouted darkly as he swiftly crossed his fingers together in a hand seal to create a cube.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(A technique adapted from "Naruto," which is a 3D object made out of chakra - anything that passes through it is disintegrated on a molecular level.)</dfn>

    <p>A black light shot forth with a loud buzz, aimed at this Blue Dragon in the air.</p>

    <p>It was yet another high level spell!</p>

    <p>"This is...!"</p>

    <p>A lot of students and teachers cried out in surprise.</p>

    <p>It looked like part of the air had been peeled away to create a pitch-black strip.</p>

    <p>But this wasn't a space rift nor was it a spatial storm; it was a restraining spell specially designed to counter sound wave magic. It could forcefully alter the medium that sound traveled through, causing the sound wave spell to dissipate completely until it was finally just like punching cotton.</p>

    <p>"Lao Gudong Xiaoer used a sound wave spell to counter my attack - isn't this looking down on me too much?" Wu Zhenjun snorted.</p>

    <p>But just as he said the words, Wang Ming was already laughing. "You've fallen into my trap, Wu Zhenjun!"</p>

    <p>Wu Zhenjun: "???"</p>

    <p>Within the black space created by the Universal Dust Release Spell, a dim white light unexpectedly appeared.</p>

    <p>This white light was none other than the Sky-Battering Cry's white Blue Dragon!</p>

    <p>His Dust Release Spell had actually failed?</p>

    <p>There was utter incomprehension on Wu Zhenjun's face.</p>

    <p>This scene had truly caught him off guard.</p>

    <p>He had assumed that this technique of his would easily dispel Wang Ming's attack, but this situation was completely out of his expectations. It had never occurred to him at all that Wang Ming's Sky-Battering Cry would actually disregard his Dust Release Spell and directly lunge at him.</p>

    <p>He could only hurriedly raise both his arms in defense.</p>

    <p>This blast hit his crossed arms hard, pushing his entire body back as his feet left two deep furrows in the ground.</p>

    <p>"Lao Gudong Xiaoer's attack is actually so fierce."</p>

    <p>After this blast, Wu Zhenjun finally knew where the problem lay.</p>

    <p>This wasn't the Sky-Battering Cry at all!</p>

    <p>"Spirit Power Cannon," Wang Ming answered quickly. "This is my armor's most basic operation. That blast that hit Wu Zhenjun just now was pretty awesome, wasn't it? To be able to push you back that far, the impact is pretty good."</p>

    <p>After the third modification, Wang Ming had already completely fixed the problem with the recoil from the Spirit Power Cannon. Now, when he activated the cannon, Wang Ling One would automatically readjust and minimize the impact from the recoil.</p>

    <p>"Spirit Power Cannon?" Wu Zhenjun narrowed his eyes. "But why..."</p>

    <p>"You want to ask why it's clearly the Spirit Power Cannon but it looks like the Sky-Battering Cry?" Wang Ming laughed. "Do you know 'skin<sup>4</sup>'? My armor can copy a spell's skin; I thought the Sky-Battering Cry was pretty cool, so I used it."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>4</sup>(The gaming term for an aesthetic change in an item or a character.)</dfn>

    <p>Wu Zhenjun: "..."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>After a moment, Wu Zhenjun flicked his sleeves and heaved a sigh. "I thought my Dust Release Spell didn't work, but it turns out that Lao Gudong Xiaoer evaded my spell under camouflage. That blast was indeed powerful enough, but Lao Gudong Xiaoer is too na√Øve if you think you can hurt me with just this."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming shrugged and laughed coldly. "Of course I don't - what kind of damage can my Spirit Power Cannon at twenty percent do to you?"</p>

    <p>Wu Zhenjun: "???"</p>
