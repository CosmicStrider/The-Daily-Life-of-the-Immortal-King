  <h1>Chapter 756 Reborn With A Brand New Attitude</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade had never felt such an intense and grim sense of crisis as when Wang Ming came out armed to the teeth... even in his current injured condition, Ghost Head Blade had always felt that given Wang Ming's ordinary state, the latter was a worm he could crush at any time.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was without doubt very smart, but in the end he was just a mundane person, and wasn't a big deal.</p>

    <p>This was what Ghost Head Blade had thought all along, before Wang Ming had armed himself.</p>

    <p>However, reality proved that Ghost Head Blade had been too arrogant.</p>

    <p>In the current age of national cultivation, cultivators with a particular level of cultivation always looked down on ordinary people. Furthermore, their numbers weren't small, accounting for almost half of the population.</p>

    <p>So, this was the lesson that Wang Ming as an "ordinary person" taught to cultivators like Ghost Head Blade who treated ordinary people with contempt.</p>

    <p>Knowledge was power...</p>

    <p>Knowledge could indeed change a person's destiny.</p>

    <p>"Prepare to fire!" At Wang Ming's shout, the target scope had already accurately locked onto Ghost Head Blade.</p>

    <p>Although Ghost Head Blade was currently just a blade and very small in size, Wang Ming had already long taken this into consideration and had modified his Spirit Power Amplification Cannon into a "Spirit Power Amplification Tracker Cannon"! No need to hold his breath! No need to use cheats! He could still automatically lock onto the other party regardless! Identify killing intent! Aimbot headshot!</p>

    <p>But the recoil from the blast was very strong, and the instant Wang Ming fired the spirit power cannon, he was flung backward.</p>

    <p>This clumsy magic treasure which he had assembled together had just been made from magic treasure detritus in the Dead Sea of Space, so the weight of the various parts weren't evenly distributed despite the fact that Wang Ming had already tried as much as possible to find magic treasures of similar density and had extracted their materials to complete his creation.</p>

    <p>But after firing this cannon, he was still deeply aware of the mecha armor's defects.</p>

    <p>Just consider it experimental data...</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was already determined to build a second generation mecha as soon as he got out of here!</p>

    <p>His arm also hurt from the strong recoil, but it was still under his pain threshold, and was like the ache of a pulled muscle.</p>

    <p>As he was thrown backward by the recoil, the mecha armor's suspension system kicked in at the same time. Looking at the situation, Heavenly Materials quickly turned into a stream of light and flew behind Wang Ming to brace him as they withstood the recoil together.</p>

    <p>A huge and intense wave of light blasted straight in Ghost Head Blade's direction.</p>

    <p>For a moment, the spirit power in the Dead Sea of Space shook; great waves rolled and spirit fluid was instantly vaporized into clouds of steam.</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade realized he couldn't avoid this blast because this cannon had a tracker - the moment it fired, it already had him dead in its sights!</p>

    <p>Damn! Wang Ming was merely an ordinary person, but wanted to show off his strength in front of him?</p>

    <p>"Hidden Ghost Sword Technique!"</p>

    <p>Since he couldn't avoid it, Ghost Head Blade simply slashed at this cannonball of light.</p>

    <p>A dazzling purple sword light lit up the sky and rushed toward this cannon fire as it tried to split it in two.</p>

    <p>But in the end, Ghost Head Blade had still underestimated Wang Ming's cannon. He himself was already injured, and although some of his spirit energy had been restored earlier, he had been saving it for use when he seized Wang Ming's body, and this reserve of strength was far from enough.</p>

    <p>Although the sword light moved forward, it was quickly engulfed in Wang Ming's cannonball of light...</p>

    <p>The moment it hit Ghost Head Blade, he roared, "â€” No!"</p>

    <p>This mecha armor, cut and assembled from magic treasure detritus from the Dead Sea of Space, was in the end beyond Ghost Head Blade's imagination.</p>

    <p>Even Heavenly Materials who was behind Wang Ming was utterly amazed.</p>

    <p>His owner was just an ordinary person, but had actually relied on this mecha armor to battle a cultivator who was almost at the Soul Formation stage...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Dead?" In the distance, Wang Ming relied on the mecha armor's suspension system to remain afloat in the air.</p>

    <p>He had once invented flying equipment for himself, so he wasn't lacking when it came to flight dexterity and balance.</p>

    <p>Moreover, this humanoid mecha armor magic treasure which he had put together wasn't something he had suddenly come up with in the Dead Sea of Space. The design blueprint was already long imprinted in his mind.</p>

    <p>He had already had this idea when he had been developing the human imitation magic weapon Head of State 001; it was just that he had never put it into practice.</p>

    <p>Relying now on magic treasure detritus to assemble the mecha armor was purely a last resort, because the assembly of the real mecha armor was currently still in the materials collection stage.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming's biggest reason for coming on the summer camp as a lead teacher this time, apart from testing Head of State 001's performance, stalking Wang Ling, monitoring Wang Ling, peeping at Wang Ling, bullying Wang Ling, teasing Wang Ling, and asking Wang Ling for his birthday gift, was to gather the main materials for assembling the mecha armor.</p>

    <p>This was something that Huaxiu Alliance had also approved: Wang Ming could freely choose the materials from the remains which he needed, in moderation. This was a privilege Old Qi which had given him, and Wang Ming had the stamped document to prove it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming gazed at the billowing smoke up ahead and sighed softly.</p>

    <p>Because this mecha armor lacked spiritual awareness as a supplementary ability, plus Wang Ming himself wasn't a cultivator, he had no way of determining whether Ghost Head Blade was dead or not.</p>

    <p>But he was fairly certain that that blast just now had already injured Ghost Head Blade badly.</p>

    <p>Even if Ghost Head Blade wasn't dead, he already no longer had the strength to fight. In the days to come, his body would undoubtedly start to disintegrate little by little as he soaked in the spatial spirit fluid, and then his soul would suffer the curse of the ancient artifact spirit.</p>

    <p>The question Heavenly Materials asked him also confirmed Wang Ming's thoughts. "Sword master, Sir, want to give it another shot?"</p>

    <p>"He doesn't have the strength to struggle anymore. Forget it." Wang Ming shook his head.</p>

    <p>It actually wasn't like he didn't want to fire a second shot, but that blast just now had used up thirty-two percent of his spirit power...</p>

    <p>There was only forty percent left in the "spirit power center."</p>

    <p>He had to save this spirit power for breaking through the space wall.</p>

    <p>Thus, Wang Ming no longer paid Ghost Head Blade any heed.</p>

    <p>Instead, he flew up as high as he was able to. "If there is a spatial storm later, protect me as much as you can."</p>

    <p>"Very well, sword master, Sir," Heavenly Materials responded very gently. He had been made from materials carefully selected and refined by the Master of Immortal Mansion. He was the only one of his kind in the world and so tough that he had no reason to fear a spatial storm at all.</p>

    <p>Heavenly Materials then braced Wang Ming's back of his own accord, ready to withstand the recoil from the spirit power cannon.</p>

    <p>"Ready..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming took a deep breath and mentally counted down from three.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>He raised his arm and fired a second shot at the sky high above the Dead Sea of Space!</p>

    <p>It was a shot to bring him back to life, and a vow which Wang Ming made as an ordinary man...</p>

    <p>After this, Wang Ming would be reborn as a brand new person!</p>
