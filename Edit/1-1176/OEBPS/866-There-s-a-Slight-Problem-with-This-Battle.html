  <h1>Chapter 866 There's a Slight Problem with This Battle...</h1>

  <div>

    <p>As everyone knew, if you wanted Wang Ling to take out his life bonded magic treasure, you had to make a booking first. But even if you could make a booking, there was in fact no one who could make Wang Ling take out his life bonded magic treasure... For Wang Ling, practically every fight could be settled with a few slaps. If that didn't work, he would just throw out a few more.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling couldn't use a method as simple and crude as a slap to handle this Gu Shunzhi in front of him. The other party was a keeper of order, as well as the strongest one among all the keepers of order; he had to think about Gu Shunzhi's pride. Wang Ling felt that he was a pretty considerate guy, though he didn't have a girlfriend yet...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong took a fancy to him in the beginning, which was a short-lived crush. Didn't it stop after he paid her no attention? So even Wang Ling himself couldn't tell if a girl truly liked him. Even with his Mind-Reading Ability, he couldn't be sure if a girl's attitude toward him was just a momentary illusion or not.</p>

    <p>It was actually harder for him to attract people with his more reclusive nature, wasn't it?</p>

    <p>"Focus when you're fighting, how can you space out?" Gu Shunzhi stared at Wang Ling, his hands on his hips. He deliberately tightened the Chains of Order, but the boy didn't seem to feel pain, and didn't even frown.</p>

    <p>After a few seconds, Gu Shunzhi sensed the boy's pupils change.</p>

    <p>It was a pair of pupils with tremendous pressure Gu Shunzhi had never felt before. The boy's pupils turned deep red before taking the shape of flower petals. A formidable power of sight fell on the Chains of Order, and Gu Shunzhi's scalp instantly turned numb and he got goosebumps all over his body.</p>

    <p>What strong power of sight...</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi had never seen this type of power before - it wouldn't be farfetched to call it the strongest in this current era!</p>

    <p>It was incredibly astonishing that the power of sight alone could generate such pressure, without any sight spells being cast.</p>

    <p>Whoosh!</p>

    <p>The next moment, Gu Shunzhi clearly felt his Chains of Order being driven back by a powerful force, as a complete set of spirit armor created purely out of spirit energy formed over the boy's arms and body!</p>

    <p>This spirit armor was comprised of very dense spirit energy molecules, and Gu Shunzhi had to withdraw his Chains of Order for the time being. Even as a divine weapon, the Chains of Order weren't without a natural enemy. After all, they were made from refined hair, and were deeply afraid of dense spirit energy molecules... Too long in such an environment and Gu Shunzhi's hair would become dry and frizzy, as well as greasy! It'd be damaged!</p>

    <p>When his hair was damaged, the strength of the Chains of Order would be greatly reduced.</p>

    <p>Of course, the Chains of Order usually didn't have to fear anything made of dense spirit energy molecules.</p>

    <p>After all, as Gu Shunzhi's life bonded magic treasure, the Chains of Order could move freely through cosmic space - how could any common thing made of dense spirit energy molecules affect his Chains of Order?</p>

    <p>In The Cultivation Encyclopedia , the unit of measure for spirit energy was the yard. Anything with a spirit energy density of one thousand yards or more in a cubic meter of space was considered to be thick with spirit energy molecules.</p>

    <p>When a one thousand-yard, cubic-meter molecule ball exploded, it was no less powerful than a highly explosive grenade.</p>

    <p>Taking the Old Devil and General Yi as examples, both the Old Devil's "Chaos Ball" and General Yi's "Palm Sword," which were the techniques that made them famous, were spells that relied on the compression of highly dense power molecules.</p>

    <p>The Old Devil's Chaos Ball could reach a density of one to two million.</p>

    <p>The density of General Yi's Palm Sword remained steady at around 2.2 million.</p>

    <p>The pressure from traveling back and forth through cosmic space in general was about ten million spirit energy molecules.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi's Chains of Order could move freely through space and endure pressure up to twenty million spirit energy molecules...</p>

    <p>Given Gu Shunzhi's identity as a keeper of order, his Chains of Order had a clear analytical ability and could make visible the statistical data of any substance it touched.</p>

    <p>Just now, Gu Shunzhi chose to withdraw the Chains of Order because he saw a string of numbers on Wang Ling's spirit armor that he didn't understand... There were so many numbers that even Gu Shunzhi couldn't count them clearly, so he immediately withdrew the Chains of Order.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The Six Heavenly Dao watching the battle outside couldn't help marveling.</p>

    <p>"The power of the Chains of Order is already unfathomable, but His Excellency Ling's King's Eye is even more amazing!" Strength Heavenly Dao sighed with feeling.</p>

    <p>"The King's Eye has the power to see through to the nature of the universe. Its power of sight can build spirit armor, and it has very formidable defensive abilities. However, as the strongest of all the keepers of order, Gu Shunzhi is also highly observant. His Excellency Ling barely summoned the spirit armor before Gu Shunzhi promptly withdrew the Chains of Order - his response was truly swift," Time Heavenly Dao also said.</p>

    <p>Spirit Heavenly Dao laughed. "This is all just playing around to begin with. As the keeper of three cosmic orders, Gu Shunzhi is very meticulous and extremely hardworking. There's nothing more that we can say about His Excellency Ling, so we should praise this keeper of order more. He may be a lot weaker compared with His Excellency Ling, but for him to come this far is already quite a feat! We should commend him for that!"</p>

    <p>"Yes, yes! He should be commended!" The rest of the Heavenly Dao nodded in agreement.</p>

    <p>But after the battle was over, they resolved to have Gu Shunzhi stay behind to repair the Heavenly Dao Governing Committee's meeting room...</p>

    <p>A battle between the strongest keeper of order in the universe and the strongest man in the dimension wasn't entirely without its attractions... but the Great Heavenly Dao all happened to share the same thought: after the battle, what sorry state would their meeting room be in...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After the spirit armor was summoned, Gu Shunzhi tried many different techniques.</p>

    <p>He used the Chibaku Tensei Hug, Shinratensei Shock, Bansh≈ç Ten'in, Spiraling Ball <sup>1</sup> ... nothing could shake this spirit armor at all. Those could all be called devastating attacks, and the keepers of order he had fought before who saw them had been unable to escape them... However, these skills couldn't even so much as scratch this armor.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(All adapted from Naruto.)</dfn>

    <p>This was too IMBA <sup>2</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(The gaming term for too
unbalanced, too strong,
and/or too amazing ..)</dfn>

    <p>It was impossible for normal spells to break through this defense.</p>

    <p>So... did he have to use a super spell?</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi frowned slightly as he stared at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He saw that Wang Ling was also deep in thought.</p>

    <p>Was the other party also pondering how to deal with him?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ling who was wrapped tightly in the spirit armor summoned by the King's Eye was indeed frowning slightly.</p>

    <p>He hadn't deliberately summoned the spirit armor...</p>

    <p>Because he knew that once it was summoned, it would fend off most of Gu Shunzhi's attacks.</p>

    <p>But who knew that after activating his King's Eye, it actually had an automatic "protect clone" mechanism, directly wrapping him in spirit armor.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was indeed thinking.</p>

    <p>He was thinking about how to cancel the spirit armor...</p>
