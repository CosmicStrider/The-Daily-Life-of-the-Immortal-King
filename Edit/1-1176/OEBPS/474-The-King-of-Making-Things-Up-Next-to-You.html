  <h1>Chapter 474 The King of Making Things Up, Next to You </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Er Ha rubbed its eyes before it confirmed that this profile really did belong to Wei Zhi, who was a short, slightly childish-looking, sunny pretty boy. He could endure electric shocks, was strong at withstanding attacks, had playful body movements, and appeared very reliable.</p>

    <p>The above was Er Ha's first impression of Wei Zhi.</p>

    <p>Er Ha remembered that it hadn't contacted Wei Zhi again after the two of them had gone deep into Demon Hunters Association territory and exposed their illegal spirit beast trade a few days ago. When Zhuo Yi's group had rushed over, Er Ha had hidden the whole time in a knapsack that Zhuo Yi had brought with him to ensure its own safety. Wei Zhi had then directly become the first eyewitness to cooperate with Zhuo Yi's follow-up investigation and was also the person who had reported the Demon Hunters Association.</p>

    <p>It was after that that the Demon Hunters Association's underground activities came to light.</p>

    <p>The outcome of this incident actually wasn't just thanks to Zhuo Yi as a representative of the government, but was a joint effort with Wei Zhi as a representative of the official Pet Trainers Guild.</p>

    <p>If there was no buying and selling, then there was no killing.</p>

    <p>Until now, Er Ha still remembered what it had seen that day when it had passed through the Demon Hunters Association's back street of trade...</p>

    <p>Captured spirit beasts struggled and snarled in their cages, abused and beaten. A lot of them had even been on the verge of death from resisting so much, and had been doused with hallucinogens before being directly skinned alive by those inhumane members of the Demon Hunters Association, just because the fur was more supple when the beast was skinned alive.</p>

    <p>At that time, Er Ha had left in a hurry and hadn't saved Wei Zhi's contact information. It had also never thought of contacting him.</p>

    <p>That was because Er Ha was sure that Wei Zhi would probably be very busy during this time. After all, Wei Zhi represented the Pet Trainers Guild as he worked in cooperation with the police to wipe out organizations suspected of being part of the Demon Hunters Association nationwide and to crack down aggressively on illegal spirit beast trade.</p>

    <p>The Pet Trainers Guild advocated for harmony between humans and spirit beasts. Although pet trainers and spirit beasts had contractual relationships, Er Ha could in fact already tell from Wei Zhi's attitude toward Pushing Large Butterfly that he treated spirit beasts more like friends.</p>

    <p>For all pet trainers like Wei Zhi, "pet hunter" organizations like the Demon Hunters Association were completely unforgivable.</p>

    <p>Of course, even if Er Ha didn't have Wei Zhi's contact information, it had Wei Zhi's peaked cap, and it had been to Wei Zhi's apartment. If Er Ha wanted to find him, it could just go there directly.</p>

    <p>Actually, it hadn't been that long ago; it hadn't even been a week, and if you really wanted to count it, it was roughly just five days.</p>

    <p>In the past five days, Er Ha had paid special attention to the news. The organizations under the Demon Hunters Association were exposed one after another everywhere and their members arrested. However, there still weren't any clues on President Bai, the head of the Demon Hunters Association.</p>

    <p>In fact, Er Ha thought that Wei Zhi's situation was actually quite dangerous given that he was the person who had made the report. To be able to run such a large organization with so many plots and plans that had attracted so many members... the leader behind it was obviously a ruthless character with a high realm and a sharp mind.</p>

    <p>And most crucially, none of the men arrested so far, such as Strong Zuo and his gang, who claimed to be core members of the Demon Hunters Association, knew what President Bai looked like or even what his voice sounded like exactly.</p>

    <p>Later, Zhuo Yi analyzed this issue.</p>

    <p>The so-called core members of the Demon Hunters Association in fact weren't core members at all. Each and every one of the core members of Immortal Mansion had been at the Soul Formation stage! Thinking about it carefully, the position of core elder dropping into the lap of a Golden Core cultivator like Strong Zuo actually really wasn't scientific.</p>

    <p>So Zhuo Yi and Warden Liang determined that these so-called core members had in fact been made scapegoats by the real core members of the Demon Hunters Association!</p>

    <p>When he had come to this conclusion back then, Zhuo Yi himself had been surprised...</p>

    <p>He was very sensitive to the word "scapegoat"!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Er Ha lingered on the spellmaster platform for some time before it finally clicked on the private chat box and tapped out a message. "Are you there? Is Pushing Large Butterfly doing well?"</p>

    <p>At the same time, Wei Zhi saw a private chat window pop up and couldn't help frowning.</p>

    <p>A person coming out of nowhere who knew of the most cherished pet he was now carrying on him...</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi thought hard for a moment with an intense expression on his face.</p>

    <p>It could only be that situation!</p>

    <p>The worst case scenario!</p>

    <p>It was also the last situation he wanted to happen!</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi stared at the chat window and his forehead started to sweat. He gnashed his teeth as he typed, "Dream on! I won't surrender!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "???"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi made a "heh" sound. The words he had said just now completely boosted his courage. "You're that President Bai of the Demon Hunters Association, right? Let me tell you! I was the one who exposed the Demon Hunters Association which you so carefully set up! Let me tell you, even if I, Wei Zhi, have nothing else, at least I have integrity! The Pet Trainers Guild that I represent will never bow to any dark force! Don't think about using my Pushing Large Butterfly to threaten me!"</p>

    <p>Gazing at these words on the screen, Er Ha was already dumbstruck. "..."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "Heh, why aren't you saying anything? If President Bai has the ability, don't hesitate to open fire on my Pushing Large Butterfly! Open fire! Don't look down on me! I, Wei Zhi, will continue to be Pushing Large Butterfly's owner in the future!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha already couldn't help clapping its dog paws at this wonderful demonstration of making things up.</p>

    <p>There were times when it was really worrying how many people around you were kings at making things up...</p>

    <p>"Brother, we haven't seen each other for five days and you've already become this mental?" Er Ha typed, "It was a little disciple of yours, Technician 003 of Salted Fish Skills Store, who recommended you."</p>

    <p>Seeing this, Wei Zhi heaved a sigh of relief before responding.</p>

    <p>That was because a few minutes ago, one of his disciples had indeed complained to him about a strange customer who had visited the skills store. The customer had been a dog who had visited the store purely to chat and hadn't bought anything! It had wasted a lot of the disciple's time.</p>

    <p>At that time, Wei Zhi had actually wondered whether this dog was Er Ha. After all, as far as Wei Zhi knew, there weren't many spirit dogs who had such high IQs, and even fewer still who knew how to operate a computer. A lot of spirit beasts could understand humans because of the spirit beast contract, which created a spiritual connection between the spirit beast and its owner.</p>

    <p>Actually, unless they had cultivated to the level of being able to transform into a human, the vast majority of spirit beasts couldn't read Chinese characters, let alone learn pinyin and type on a computer.</p>

    <p>"Are you... Brother Dog?"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi still felt it was a little unbelievable when he typed out this sentence.</p>

    <p>When his little disciple 003 had called him earlier to complain, he had still thought that it was probably just a coincidence. After all, the world of the Internet was full of wondrous things.</p>

    <p>But now that he knew that it was Er Ha on the other side of the screen, Wei Zhi felt that this was the power of destiny...</p>
