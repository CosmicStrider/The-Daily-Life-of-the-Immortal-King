  <h1>Chapter 428 Ling Zhenren Teaches You How to Deal with Sword Qi! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>After Taoist Guang finished relating his experience in the group, the three people fell into a long silence. To be honest, Taoist Guang had been reluctant to bring up this past experience because it was too humiliating. He and Evil Sword God were both at True Immortal level, but just because he lacked a nomological power, the disparity between them was so large. It was a situation that Taoist Guang had never before expected to happen.</p>

    <p>Thus, ever since then, he had worked hard and aimed high as he thought up all kinds of ways to get through the Samsara Spirit Tribulation safely - as long as he broke through to Venerated Immortal level, he felt that he would be strong enough then! He had also heard that once you stepped into the Venerated Immortal realm, you would be able to master two or three nomological powers at least... If he had all this, wouldn't he be able to stamp on a mere Evil Sword God casually?</p>

    <p>But Taoist Guang had never thought that he would dig a hole for himself in the end... His corporeal body had already been burned, and in his current state, there was no possibility of him returning to the height of his power unless his flesh could be restored or if he continued in this vein toward experiencing the Samsara Spirit Tribulation.</p>

    <p>"That's all I know about the Immortal's Treasure House. I don't know whether Evil Sword God found the Immortal's Treasure House in the end after passing through the entrance to the Otherworld. But if you think about it, this Immortal's Treasure House is probably far from easily found," Taoist Guang typed.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "What Brother Guang says is correct. It's been so long since your battle with Evil Sword God, and there still hasn't been any news about him in the last several hundred years. That's enough to prove that Evil Sword God is either still exploring the Immortal's Treasure House or doing something else in the Gate Between Worlds."</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang nodded. "Then I'll leave the rest to Brother Thunder and Senior Ling."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Rest assured, Brother Guang, Brother Ling and I will definitely find a way to restore your body and return you to the height of your power."</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang laughed. "No rush, no rush. This old man has already waited for so many years, a bit longer won't make a difference... Besides, didn't you burn me this notebook?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "If Brother Guang finds it too boring, you can watch live streams on live streaming sites online, or download a game to play... Do you know 'eat chicken'? I can send you an account invite!"</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang felt like he had opened a door to a whole new world. "Eat chicken? What's that?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "It's just a common name for a game, but it would be difficult for me to explain it clearly in a short amount of time. Later I'll put together a file and an account which I will send to you. Brother Guang, you can pass the time with this game. Also, if someone asks you if you want cheats, on no account should you buy them. Yesterday, a game live streamer with the nickname Baboon was blacklisted by the broadcast program 'FocusReport' <sup>1</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This refers to pro gamer Lu Benwei, who used cheats during a PUBG live stream and lashed back at criticism, causing him to be blacklisted ..)</dfn>

    <p>Taoist Guang: "Mm, understood, understood..."</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, Taoist Guang patted himself on the head and suddenly typed: "Just a moment, both of you, I still have one more thing. Please accept this, Senior Ling, it will definitely help you in your search for the Immortal's Treasure House!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sent a question mark: "?"</p>

    <p>It was as concise as ever, without a word more.</p>

    <p>Soon, he saw the Soul-Suppression Ring on his hand tremble slightly, and a ball of spirit light surged forth: it was a gourd wrapped pretty tightly in Dao talisman seals; there were fully four thick layers of True Immortal seals!</p>

    <p>In the three-person chat, Taoist Guang said, "This is the sword qi that was left on my Taoist robe after Evil Sword God used his clone to kill me... The sword qi was so demonic that after I took my robe off, I placed it in a third-grade holy weapon gourd, but it was useless! It was only after I added four thick layers of seals that this demonic qi was suppressed!"</p>

    <p>Holding the gourd, Wang Ling sunk into deep thought; he wanted to see how strong this demonic qi was.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling turned on the video function on his wristwatch, and on the other two ends of the three-person chat group, Lord Diulei and Taoist Guang immediately received the video feed.</p>

    <p>In a familiar room, Wang Ling sat upright on his bed as he casually tore open the seals as if they were gauze...</p>

    <p>In the group, Lord Diulei couldn't help asking, "Brother Guang, are you sure these are True Immortal seals?"</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang was sweating. "Yes..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Why do they seem fake?"</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang was tongue-tied: "..." How would he know?!</p>

    <p>There was a procedure to removing seals! From what Taoist Guang knew of the cultivation world, the four True Immortal seals should be dissolved layer by layer... This was the first time he had seen this rough method of tearing them off like the tape on a delivery package...</p>

    <p>However, Taoist Guang felt that this also indirectly verified his suspicions about Wang Ling's strength.</p>

    <p>To be able to tear off Taoist Guang's True Immortal seals so easily, Senior Ling had to be a Venerated Immortal. It was also likely that he had two or three nomological powers, hence why he could deal with the seals so easily.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't speak in front of the camera. After tearing off the True Immortal seals, he pulled out the cork and turned the gourd upside down. A dark blue Taoist robe with black demonic qi lingering on it very quickly emerged in front of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Just as Taoist Guang had said, the dark blue Taoist robe was already heavily damaged; it had dozens of tears from when it had been struck by sword qi, and each strike had been a deadly wound.</p>

    <p>Of course, these tears weren't the point; the real point was the black demonic qi which emanated from each one of them.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling could sense the "Great Sword Dao Spell," one of the Three Thousand Great Spells, in the power of this black demonic qi... but it was very clear that this wasn't the purest form of its use, and the person who cast it was a complete novice.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't know how this Evil Sword God had mastered this nomological power, but since the other party had grasped it, then compared with his previous opponents, he should pay a little more attention to this one.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, it had already been a long time since that clash between Taoist Guang and Evil Sword God; Wang Ling was suddenly a little curious to know to what extent Evil Sword God had perfected this Sword Dao nomological power over the last several hundred years.</p>

    <p>While Wang Ling was thinking with his chin in his hand, the black demonic sword qi dispersed over the dark blue Taoist robe unexpectedly gathered together at that moment!</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, be careful!"</p>

    <p>"Senior Ling, watch out!"</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang and Lord Diulei also saw this scene at the same time and wanted to warn Wang Ling, but it was already too late.</p>

    <p>The black sword qi combined together extremely swiftly, and like a viper lurking in the dark suddenly baring fangs full of poison, it struck like a black ribbon!</p>

    <p>Directly at Wang Ling's heart!</p>

    <p>This sword qi was nothing like the usual ones; it carried the nomological power of the Great Sword Dao Spell. Although Evil Sword God had yet to completely grasp it back then, the sword qi created with the swing of his sword actually had some spiritual intelligence, and knew to attack as soon as it gathered together...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling turned his head. "???"</p>

    <p>On the bed, Jingke had already reacted at this moment.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling was faster.</p>

    <p>He swiftly grabbed <em>Three Years of College Exams and Five Years of Simulations</em>from his desk, rolled it up, and with a loud thud, smacked and broke up this demonic sword qi...</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang: "???"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "???"</p>
