  <h1>Chapter 407 Is Refining Weapons That Hard? </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Seeing the resources on refining weapons piled up on the floor, Lord Diulei slowly put down the books he was holding, then obediently sat down on the floor and took a deep breath.</p>

    <p>Hm.</p>

    <p>After careful consideration...</p>

    <p>He decided to forget everything that he had seen...</p>

    <p>He couldn't imagine how heartbroken Luo Chuang would be if he saw this scene.</p>

    <p>When had it start to become possible to teach yourself to refine weapons as if it was a science? Lord Diulei thought it was extremely mystical. This was an art that had always been handed down through the generations in the cultivation circle, and which was as old as the skill of refining elixirs... Then, did that mean that Brother Ling could teach himself to refine elixirs?</p>

    <p>At this thought, Lord Diulei silently wiped at his sweat.</p>

    <p>Of course, Wang Ling wasn't human!</p>

    <p>It really seemed that nothing was impossible for him.</p>

    <p>To be a weaponsmith at the level of a king after ten minutes of self-study... Lord Diulei felt that once again, he had witnessed a historical moment.</p>

    <p>After picking up this skill through self-study, he wouldn't need to look for someone to refine weapons for him in the future! â€” Learn bit by bit and pay nothing to refine a weapon.</p>

    <p>"But why hasn't Brother Ling learned this before?" Lord Diulei couldn't help asking.</p>

    <p>He asked his question in a very soft voice so as not to disturb Wang Ling while he studied. He knew Wang Ling's habit, which was that no one could bother him when he was studying; it was like stroking cat fur in the wrong direction, which would make the cat puff up in anger.</p>

    <p>Er Ha replied quietly, "Little Master Ling felt that he should focus his energy on his main concern."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "What's that?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Weekly tests, monthly tests, midterm exams."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Everything should be ranked in order of priority..."</p>

    <p>Actually, there was a second half to its words which Er Ha didn't voice; it had initially wanted to say that Wang Ling usually spent a very limited amount of time on studying everyday - five minutes at most! After all, the art of refining weapons was a little more complicated than the courses in high school, so it should in fact take a little more time to learn.</p>

    <p>Er Ha felt that for Wang Ling to spend ten minutes to study the art of refining weapons up to the level of a king was already enough consideration on his part.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Looking at the alarm clock in the room, Er Ha thought it was just about time...</p>

    <p>As expected, after the second hand completed another round, Wang Ling closed the book.</p>

    <p>All the resources Wang Ling was looking at were specialist materials for the professional weaponsmith entrance exam. Lord Diulei couldn't resist taking a closer look at the book Wang Ling had just shut... What the heck, this book was even more specialized than <em>King of Weaponsmiths </em>; it was three-star king level!</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling could actually go even higher in level, but forging a magic ring to contain the soul space only required him to be at three-star king level, so he decided to stop here... If he needed to forge more advanced magic weapons in the future, he would just learn it then.</p>

    <p>Spending a few minutes more on study was nothing, after all.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "...But Brother Ling, is this really alright?" He was dubious about how effective this outrageous type of studying was.</p>

    <p>"No problem," Wang Ling transmitted telepathically. His voice was as indifferent as usual, and he nodded nonchalantly.</p>

    <p>Among the Three Thousand Great Spells, there was originally one called the Great Weapon-Refining Spell, but Wang Ling hadn't been able to use it because back then, he'd lacked the theoretical knowledge behind refining weapons.</p>

    <p>But now, Wang Ling's knowledge had directly advanced to the three-star king level in a short fifteen minutes... In some sense, his ability to refine weapons was now as advanced as his understanding of the theory behind it.</p>

    <p>He had never used the Great Weapon-Refining Spell to forge any sort of magic weapon before; this would be his first attempt.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling was deeply aware that using the Great Weapon-Refining Spell to refine weapons also had its limitations; this spell focused on speed in refining a weapon... but quality would depend on luck.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling held the magnetic stone in his hand. It was quite large, the size of an adult man's fist. If used carefully, it would be enough to create ten rings.</p>

    <p>So the first step was to melt this magnetic stone down...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei didn't know how to refine weapons, but he knew the process involved. Looking at Wang Ling's actions, he knew that Wang Ling was preparing to start refining.</p>

    <p>But after looking around Wang Ling's room, he was puzzled.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, where's your furnace? Did you put it away?" Lord Diulei asked.</p>

    <p>The first step in refining weapons was to smelt the material, he knew that much!</p>

    <p>"Hm... don't need one..." Wang Ling shook his head.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was confused. Didn't need one? What did he mean?</p>

    <p>Then, before his eyes, Wang Ling stretched out his hand, and a ball of spirit light appeared, sparkling and dazzling!</p>

    <p>"The hell?! The legendary gold color?!" In front of this radiance, Lord Diulei was extremely alarmed.</p>

    <p>Could it be?! Was this a legendary grade furnace?! Lord Diulei's heart trembled with all kinds of emotions. To be honest, for Wang Ling to have a legendary grade furnace given his strength wasn't strange at all.</p>

    <p>About ten seconds later, the golden light gradually faded to reveal a rectangular black box that looked a little familiar...</p>

    <p>The shape of this furnace was a little unique!</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, have I seen this magic treasure of yours somewhere before?" Lord Diulei was a little stunned.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "You've definitely seen it! It's our family's microwave!"</p>

    <p>Realization dawned on Lord Diulei. "Oh... so it's the microwave!" Come to think of it, when Old Senior Wang had been frying the broccoli in the kitchen back then, Lord Diulei had taken care to observe him attentively on the side in an attempt to comprehend the path of Dao as the old man fried the vegetable.</p>

    <p>He recalled seeing a microwave which looked like this magic treasure at that time... Hold on! Shit! What magic treasure! This was clearly the microwave!</p>

    <p>"But what does Brother Ling need this microwave for..." No matter how much Lord Diulei thought about it, he was still puzzled, and just when he was about to open his mouth to ask, he saw Wang Ling directly open the microwave and put the magnetic stone inside it.</p>

    <p>"..." Lord Diulei sucked in a sharp breath at this scene.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling set the temperature to the highest setting and the time to the highest it could go and closed the door... he did all this very deftly.</p>

    <p>And then, in front of Lord Diulei's eyes, Wang Ling turned the power on, and the microwave lit up with a hum.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Brother Ling... what are you doing?"</p>

    <p>In a rare moment, Wang Ling open his mouth to reply out loud, "Smelting."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was thunderstruck and so agitated he straightaway stood up. "With... with a microwave? What kind of operation is this?!"</p>

    <p>A song suddenly came to mind: <em>We're different... different <sup>1</sup> </em>.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(From the song 'We Are Different' by singer Da Zhuang..)</dfn>

    <p>At Lord Diulei's feet, Er Ha was indifferent. "Senior Immortal, you've been here so many times already, can you not make a fuss over every little thing?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "This is a normal operation, sit down, sit down!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>
