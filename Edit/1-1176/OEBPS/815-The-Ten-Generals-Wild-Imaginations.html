  <h1>Chapter 815 The Ten Generals' Wild Imaginations</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This gigantic seal dragon charged at Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch's crossed arms in an awesome and thunderous display of light. In the end, before it got close, this magic dragon actually swung around, and with a beautiful flick of its tail, directly lunged at the twelve sect leaders with fangs bared.</p>

    <p>This split-second turn in events froze the hearts of the sect leaders in the arena.</p>

    <p>"Rebound spell?"</p>

    <p>What kind of ability was this...</p>

    <p>They had never seen this type of spell before.</p>

    <p>Indeed, there were in fact quite a few rebound spells out there, but most could only send back a portion of the damage; they had never seen one do a full rebound like this.</p>

    <p>The moment they saw the seal rune dragon reverse direction and dash toward them, the twelve sect leaders despaired.</p>

    <p>They already had no chance of winning this match...</p>

    <p>Because of the resonance between the twelve sealing spells, the seal rune dragon was far more powerful than they had expected. Now that it had rebounded with full force, none of them could stop it.</p>

    <p>They could only do whatever they could to put up a resistance and see if they could withstand it.</p>

    <p>Teaming up had initially been the most reliable method, but they had miscalculated, and the other side had unexpectedly sent back a rebound; instead, it now felt like they had shot themselves in the foot.</p>

    <p>The moment the rune dragon rebounded, the twelve sect leaders stood in a row and cast all sorts of cancellation spells.</p>

    <p>"Release!"</p>

    <p>"Remove seal!"</p>

    <p>"Sunflower Acupuncture Removal Technique <sup>1</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(From the Chinese TV series 'My Own Swordsman..')</dfn>

    <p>...</p>

    <p><em>Buzz!</em></p>

    <p>After one last struggle, the rune dragon finally came crashing down, and the dozen or so sect leaders were all locked in place, unable to move.</p>

    <p>The outcome of this match was already decided...</p>

    <p>All the twelve people were immobilized. Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch didn't even need to use magic, and could win just by sweeping them all out of the arena!</p>

    <p>"They've lost."</p>

    <p>"What a pity, these sect leaders were just one step away from the grand prize!"</p>

    <p>A lot of the reporters below the stage were taking photos, the flashes going off non-stop.</p>

    <p>"Don't take! Don't take my photo!"</p>

    <p>In the arena, Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch had already removed the seals on the sect leaders, and one by one they left the stage while covering their faces.</p>

    <p>To lose in a twelve to one fight was truly humiliating.</p>

    <p>In the immortal warship floating in the air, the Ten Generals were also watching the sideshow below at the same time.</p>

    <p>As True Immortal experts and from their godly perspective above, they could sense how powerful this seal rune dragon was.</p>

    <p>The rune dragon was extremely fast, and had a powerful restraining ability. Furthermore, it had the effect of sealing the spirit.</p>

    <p>In a regular situation, the moment the rune dragon rushed at him, Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch shouldn't have been able to withstand it or cast any spells at all.</p>

    <p>"What do you think, everyone?"</p>

    <p>General Yi floated cross-legged in the air. He was dressed in a white training outfit which fluttered despite the lack of wind. There was a reserved look in his eyes and a penetrating air about him. General Yi had analyzed the seal rune dragon the moment it dashed forward. An ordinary technique would be of no use at all in the face of this move; he would only be able to break it down by using "Boundless Sword Dao" to tear it open.</p>

    <p>But herein lay the problem.</p>

    <p>Unraveling the rune dragon would still take time, even for a True Immortal.</p>

    <p>But this Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch was actually able to send it bouncing back at full force, which was truly astonishing.</p>

    <p>"Although we can't be certain, one thing for sure is that this Dao Monarch does indeed have the power of Heavenly Dao." Marshal Jiang frowned. "As expected, the core members of the Office of Strategic Deception aren't simple people... Lord Diulei had actually kept this bomb hidden until now."</p>

    <p>In fact, before coming to the Office of Strategic Deception, they had all been paying attention to Ling Zhenren. In the end, no one had expected this Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch to suddenly appear at this moment.</p>

    <p>And Ling Zhenren, whom they had once wanted to investigate the most, was standing right beside them at that moment. Furthermore... this Ling Zhenren didn't seem as powerful as he was rumored to be.</p>

    <p>Was their intelligence wrong?</p>

    <p>Chin in hand, General Yi gazed at Ling Zhenren, who was sitting upright on a sofa. He was wearing a layer of very thick magical armor, and there was no way to clearly see his face inside it.</p>

    <p>The Ten Generals weren't in any hurry to use the True Immortal Eye to test him, as that would be very impolite. In any case, when they left the immortal warship later, this legendary Ling Zhenren would take off his armor, so there was no rush</p>

    <p>It was just that their previous speculation that Ling Zhenren was Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch... now didn't seem to be true.</p>

    <p>In that moment, the Ten Generals communicated telepathically with each other.</p>

    <p>"The head of state regards this Office of Strategic Deception highly. On one hand, it's because of Wang Situ. On the other hand, he's in fact extending an olive branch to the senior behind the Office of Strategic Deception. The reason we're here is thus in response to the Office of Strategic Deception's invitation, as well as to move this senior with our sincerity... This senior will be a very important factor in determining whether our Huaxiu nation will successfully survive the Heavenly Dao National Calamity this time," Medicine Saint Luo Huaiqiu said.</p>

    <p>"I still feel that all this seems like a cover-up..." Marshal Jiang narrowed his eyes at that moment.</p>

    <p>"Why does Battle Saint say that?"</p>

    <p>"We've been investigating and tracking down the senior behind the Office of Strategic Deception all this time, as well as the patron behind Lord Diulei... But whether it's Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch or Ling Zhenren, I have the strong feeling that all this is actually a cover-up." Marshal Jiang suddenly said, "Don't you feel that this Lord Diulei is very suspicious?"</p>

    <p>"Battle Saint means..."</p>

    <p>"My meaning is very clear." Marshal Jiang nodded. "He, is the senior behind everything."</p>

    <p>"... But he's only at the Soul Formation stage."</p>

    <p>"That's also a cover!"</p>

    <p>Marshal Jiang persisted with his view. "Ling Zhenren and Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch are probably just a test. It definitely won't work if we act too rashly..."</p>

    <p>"Listening to Battle Saint's analysis, I think it really is possible." Explosion Saint also said, "Think about it, how is this Lord Diulei able to survive despite courting death so often? How can a Soul Formation cultivator make so many enemies and yet emerge unscathed? Furthermore, there's Zhuo Yi."</p>

    <p>"Zhuo Yi?"</p>

    <p>"Think carefully: Zhuo Yi's career has been flourishing in recent months. He's a Golden Core cultivator, but was able to arrest all kinds of major figures one after another â€” clearly, there's a driving force behind this. And this time, Zhuo Yi unexpectedly received Lord Diulei's invitation to set up a supervisory and investigation team in the Office of Strategic Deception. Doesn't this seem strange?"</p>

    <p>"Mm... Explosion Saint's analysis is also very reasonable!" The Ten Generals nodded.</p>

    <p>"If that's the case, then everything makes sense!" General Yi sighed. "It looks like this Lord Diulei is very likely the senior behind the scenes!"</p>

    <p>"That's right! That's definitely the case!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling could easily read the Ten Generals' thoughts on the immortal warship through this "Ling Zhenren" clone.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had utterly never expected the Ten Generals to actually come up with a scenario as bizarre as this...</p>
