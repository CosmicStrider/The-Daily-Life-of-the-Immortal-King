  <h1>Chapter 819 Don't Be Full Of Yourself!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Blademaster Yi Jianchuan... one of the founding fathers and also known as the Overlord, General Yi! He was one of the few people in the nation to be granted the highest title of "King General"! Together with the other nine King Generals, they were collectively known as the Ten Generals!</p>

    <p>And of all the Ten Generals, the title "Blademaster" was the one that resounded the most because of a film about the Ten Generals from a hundred years ago titled "Martial Overlord, Dictator of Heaven's Blue Dome," which was shot from the perspective of General Yi as the main protagonist.</p>

    <p>The film brought to the fore General Yi's various consummate techniques which made him famous as Blademaster, including the Palm Sword he used when he fought the Old Devil.</p>

    <p>Even now, that was something that was still hard to forget...</p>

    <p>But while he was the most well-known of the Ten Generals among the people, General Yi was usually very low-key. Logically speaking, there was no way he would attend the celebration of a sect's founding.</p>

    <p>However, when this old man dressed in a white training outfit appeared in front of the people, the mouths of all the sect leaders below the stage dropped in surprise, and they were speechless.</p>

    <p>"General Yi... How..." Lu Youming, together with Sect Leader Sun and the other Alliance members, was dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>The whole time when they had been guessing earlier who the person on the immortal warship was, they never expected one of the Ten Generals to actually show up... and it was the most famous one, Blademaster!</p>

    <p>Lu Youming's legs were a little soft, and he was so frightened he almost fainted on the spot.</p>

    <p>Professor Yang Bingchuan happened to be standing next to Lu Youming. "Sect Leader Lu, you don't look too good?"</p>

    <p>"I... have hypoglycemia..." Lu Youming didn't know what to say.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, he gave Sect Leader Sun next to him a frantic look - the only thing he wanted to know now, was whether there was time to go and retrieve the array crystals which they had placed on the mountain...</p>

    <p>This was one of Huaxiu's Ten Generals!</p>

    <p>Even at the cost of his life, he couldn't afford to provoke this person!</p>

    <p>"Sect Leader Lu, it's actually still not too late to redeem yourself." Yang Bingchuan patted Lu Youming's shoulder.</p>

    <p>He knew that this Sect Leader Lu was a conservative and not inherently bad person; it was very typical of sects to compete with each other.</p>

    <p>"Sect Leader Lu, you've occupied a very high position all these years, but you should always take care to reflect on yourself; don't let your desires consume you just because of the small bit of power you hold. This goes against the original heart of things!" Professor Yang didn't directly say these words out loud, but spoke telepathically when he put his hand on Sect Leader Lu's shoulder.</p>

    <p>Professor Yang: "When people become too full of themselves, they sometimes don't even know who they are anymore... has Sect Leader Lu ever watched a League of Legends game?"</p>

    <p>Sect Leader Lu said telepathically, "Sometimes..."</p>

    <p>Professor Yang: "Back then, that little fatty who was considered the top shooter had his future cut short on the world stage... He thought he could do wonders with his own strength even as he led an entire team. But he didn't understand that League of Legends has never been a one-man game... What did he rely on to get to the top? Was it his own strength and skill? Maybe that was one of the reasons, but clearly that wasn't all of it."</p>

    <p>Lu Youming was feeling very remorseful at that moment.</p>

    <p>If they ultimately failed in this matter and it was exposed, leading to him being investigated for it, this wasn't something that could be explained with one or two vague sentences!</p>

    <p>Alas!</p>

    <p>He should have known!</p>

    <p>A newly-founded sect with such tremendous momentum, that not only occupied an area of unprecedented size, but also had a bunch of big shot experts in various fields... Who else could be the backer behind it? In the whole of Huaxiu nation, wasn't it only Huaxiu Alliance?</p>

    <p>"Professor Yang... Please advise me!" Lu Youming knew that Yang Bingchuan was perhaps his last hope.</p>

    <p>Professor Yang smiled a little. "Sect Leader Lu, you've been acting absent-minded all this time; it's probably because you dropped something, isn't it?" Saying this, Professor Yang handed him a silk pouch.</p>

    <p>When Lu Youming took the pouch and looked inside, he was immediately so frightened that his hair stood on end... Inside the silk pouch were none other than the transmission crystals which that Long clan descendant senior had given them!</p>

    <p>"Professor Yang, when did you..."</p>

    <p>"We knew even before you stepped foot into our Office of Strategic Deception."</p>

    <p>Lu Youming was stunned yet again.</p>

    <p>The Office of Strategic Deception's intelligence network was too strong...</p>

    <p>"This silk pouch is what you lost. I already had people earlier on take them down one by one and bring them back." Professor Yang chuckled. "But I can't give them to you for nothing."</p>

    <p>"I will never forget that Professor Yang saved my life, for as long as I live. If you have any requests, please name them!" Lu Youming saluted him with clasped fists.</p>

    <p>"If you want to thank someone, it should be His Excellency Senior Immortal. All this was on the chief's instructions." Professor Yang waved his hand. "But we do have a request, not of Sect Leader Lu, but of the Alliance."</p>

    <p>"If you wish to take in the Alliance, I will do my best to persuade..."</p>

    <p>"Sect Leader Lu, you misunderstand. Our Office of Strategic Deception isn't that shameless to use leverage to force someone to yield. We're not taking in the Alliance, let alone forcing it to disband."</p>

    <p>Professor Yang shook his head and said, "I just need Sect Leader Lu to promise me one thing."</p>

    <p>"Professor Yang, go ahead..."</p>

    <p>"In the future, the Alliance will no longer maliciously prevent other sects from advancing; it must give sects below fifth class a chance. Even if they do not wish to join the Alliance, you cannot deliberately suppress or control the rankings of other sects." Professor Yang said, "Peaceful development is the motive of the Office of Strategic Deception. I hope that the Alliance, as a large fund organization of Sky-level sects at fifth class and above, will also shoulder this responsibility. It's only when we thrive together that we can achieve great things, isn't it?"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Lu Youming sighed with feeling.</p>

    <p>In the end, this was the bearing of a great sect...</p>

    <p>"I will remember..."</p>

    <p>"Of course, our Office of Strategic Deception also knows that the Alliance has always been in this business of profiting from protection fees. If you can't do this in the future, some of your sect heads will definitely be unhappy."</p>

    <p>"Yes..."</p>

    <p>"Thus, after the end of the ceremony this time, Sect Leader Lu can hold another meeting. You can clearly convey to all the sect leaders that the Alliance will continue to exist, but its nature as an organization has changed to one which assists the lower sects. As long as the sect leaders of the Alliance agree to this condition, our Office of Strategic Deception will sign an agreement as a guarantee that all your sects will advance one level up in five years. Furthermore, we will invest in each sect's industry based on their respective lawful business situation each year. The main thing the sect heads have to do is very simple: support our Office of Strategic Deception in future reviews. That shouldn't be hard, should it?" Professor Yang said.</p>

    <p>"No, not at all..."</p>

    <p>Sect Leader Lu hurriedly waved his hands.</p>

    <p>He knew this was a great opportunity!</p>

    <p>He was deeply remorseful over his hostile behavior toward the Office of Strategic Deception in the beginning. If he had known it was this approachable, he wouldn't have done that damn thing!</p>

    <p>With Professor Yang's assurance, Sect Leader Lu's complexion looked much better.</p>

    <p>He marveled, "The Office of Strategic Deception... is really amazing! In comparison, our Alliance is simply a little brother. You were even able to invite Blademaster to attend..."</p>

    <p>Professor Yang laughed. "Sect Leader Lu, don't think so little of yourself. After all, not all the special guests have made an appearance yet."</p>

    <p>"There's more??" Sect Leader Lu was shocked.</p>

    <p>"There are still nine other people as amazing as General Yi on the immortal warship right now."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
