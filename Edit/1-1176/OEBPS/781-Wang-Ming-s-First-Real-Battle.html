  <h1>Chapter 781 Wang Ming's First Real Battle</h1>

  <div>

    <p>All the teachers sucked in their breaths at these words...</p>

    <p>This was a blatant declaration of war!</p>

    <p>Although the gap between realms could be filled with the use of magic treasures, these usually played a limited role. Uttering such words was simply looking for a fight.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming didn't lack EQ, and Wu Zhenjun was well aware that Wang Ming was deliberately goading the other teachers into forcing him to have an all-out fight with the latter.</p>

    <p>As expected, Wang Ming's method worked.</p>

    <p>The surrounding teachers on the scene were aflame with indignation. "Wu Zhenjun! Beat him up! Tear open his armor, let's see what he'll say to that!"</p>

    <p>A lot of students were also cheering for Wu Zhenjun.</p>

    <p>Because what Wang Ming had said was too arrogant and outrageous.</p>

    <p>"Go, Teacher Wu! Don't be scared! It's just crap armor!"</p>

    <p>"Who is the strongest demolition expert in Huaxiu? Teacher Wu, it's up to you!"</p>

    <p>"Teacher Wu, good luck! Use EDM and Skr Skr him to death!"</p>

    <p>Most of the students were like the melon-eating masses, forever the kind to enjoy a show without a care for the big picture.</p>

    <p>Now that their time in the remains was about to end, a fight between two teachers was well worth seeing! This would be the grand finale for this summer camp in the remains, and could even be looked upon as a precious opportunity to observe and study a fight!</p>

    <p>Of course, many of the students still stood on Wang Ming's side. The majority of them were from Number 60 High School, as well as those who had been cowed by the murderous expression in Zhai Yin's eyes...</p>

    <p>"Can Lao Gudong Xiaoer win..." Su Xiao pulled his neck back at this scene.</p>

    <p>In the formation, Wang Ling gazed indifferently into the sky, the expression in his eyes completely unruffled.</p>

    <p>In the minds of most, like the teachers cheering for Wu Zhenjun, magic treasures usually played a limited role. While they might make up for a disparity in realms, it was impossible for them to help a person surpass the other party.</p>

    <p>For example, a person with a lower realm could indeed make up for a disparity in strength with a powerful magic treasure, but if their realm itself fell short, it was hard for the magic treasure to display its full battle strength.</p>

    <p>Hence, it was common sense to feel that a powerful magic treasure certainly couldn't act as a substitute for realm.</p>

    <p>Many factors were involved, a main one being the artifact spirit.</p>

    <p>The rapport between a person and the artifact spirit was crucial in determining how much battle strength the magic treasure could demonstrate.</p>

    <p>But a lot of people were overlooking one point: the mecha armor which Wang Ming was wearing wasn't a cultivation magic treasure in the conventional sense... but a scientific magic treasure.</p>

    <p>This magic treasure didn't have an artifact spirit.</p>

    <p>In other words, the artifact spirit was computational data!</p>

    <p>The armor had a high-tech AI program in place of a weapon spirit, which was able to make decisions and learn autonomously.</p>

    <p>Hence, Wang Ling didn't say a word.</p>

    <p>He knew very well how strong his dumbass brother was.</p>

    <p>Ever since Wang Ming repeatedly lost to him as a kid, this person would never do anything reckless.</p>

    <p>Instead of this fight, what Wang Ling should be more concerned about was still the head of state's reaction.</p>

    <p>He was well aware that the head of state was secretly looking for that "mystery person."</p>

    <p>To stop the Sea And Sky Array this time, Wang Ling had almost exposed himself.</p>

    <p>Luckily, for the time being, the head of state and Huaxiu Alliance didn't suspect that their target might be a student, but speculated that this mystery person was among the teachers.</p>

    <p>Currently, Wang Ling was wondering whether he should find a teacher to take in as a disciple like Zhuo Yi, in order to shoulder this particular wok for him...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wu Zhenjun knew there was already no way out.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was too intense and confident.</p>

    <p>And so, Wu Zhenjun sighed. "Since Lao Gudong Xiaoer is so insistent, then please... I'll let you make the first move."</p>

    <p>"Wu Zhenjun, I still think it's better for you to make the first move since I want to test my armor's strength." Wang Ming waved his hand, completely unafraid of facing Wu Zhenjun.</p>

    <p>As Wu Zhenjun frowned, a little dissatisfied with Wang Ming's slightly frivolous provocation, he saw Wang Ming in the air stick out his tongue at him all of a sudden. It wasn't Wang Ming's own tongue, but Wang Ling One's built-in bionic tongue, which could identify materials and also had the mass taunt ability.</p>

    <p>And after three upgrades, its abilities had increased yet again.</p>

    <p>Not only could it perform a mass taunt, it could even do a directed taunt!</p>

    <p>Hence, the moment Wang Ling One stuck out its bionic tongue, Wu Zhenjun was suddenly besieged by inexplicable wrath. As if he had come under mind control, anger surged out of him.</p>

    <p>"It works!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was elated.</p>

    <p>As expected, the so-called "One Yang Finger + Lion's Roar" from the movie still wasn't as useful as this tongue.</p>

    <p>Wu Zhenjun tried his best to contain his emotions, only to find that he couldn't.</p>

    <p>It was at that moment that he realized why Wang Ming had manipulated this armor into sticking out its tongue. It wasn't a meaningless move, but a magic treasure ability to taunt the enemy through sight.</p>

    <p>The reason why Wu Zhenjun let Wang Ming make the first move was to test this armor's strength from its first attack. Unluckily, Wang Ming didn't give him a chance at all.</p>

    <p>"Lao Gudong Xiaoer, you..."</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wu Zhenjun's face was already red with stifled anger.</p>

    <p>And then, under everyone's stares, he couldn't hold it in anymore!</p>

    <p>Like the imperial bodyguard Fu Erkang<sup>1</sup>, Wu Zhenjun's hand started to twitch involuntarily until it finally lifted in front of him against his control. Dense spirit power molecules swirled in his palm and turned into invisible fine particles as spirit energy finally coalesced into a ball.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The meme from the TV drama "Princess Pearl.")</dfn>

    <p>This wasn't the legendary spirit energy rasengan<sup>2</sup>, but was a sound wave technique.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(The rasengan 螺旋丸 is a ball created from chakra in "Naruto.")</dfn>

    <p>It was like the fire-breathing routine in an acrobatic show.</p>

    <p>Wu Zhenjun put this spirit energy ball the size of a ping-pong ball into his mouth, aimed in Wang Ming's direction in the air, and opened his mouth wide!</p>

    <p>With a yell -</p>

    <p>In a split second, a white cannon blast of light shot out of his mouth!</p>

    <p>This blast was extremely fierce, like the Blue Dragon<sup>3</sup> rising.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(One of the Chinese Five Dragons.)</dfn>

    <p>Many of the students and teachers were deeply shaken at that moment.</p>

    <p>A lot of teachers who were familiar with Wu Zhenjun could see that this was a level four sound wave spell.</p>

    <p>This was an attack that an average teacher would find very difficult to defend against.</p>

    <p>"Teacher, what is this spell? It's so cool!" someone in Number 60 High's formation asked.</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong raised his eyebrows. "As far as I can remember, this is one of Wu Zhenjun's unique skills, and the first technique he learned from Irascible Dharmaraja Wu Yifan back then: Sky-Battering Cry. But it looks like Wu Zhenjun has improved it by adding some of his own modifications."</p>

    <p>"What improvement?"</p>

    <p>"Can't you see the electric sparks around the cannon blast?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, realization dawned on everyone.</p>

    <p>He had actually added electric special effects!</p>
