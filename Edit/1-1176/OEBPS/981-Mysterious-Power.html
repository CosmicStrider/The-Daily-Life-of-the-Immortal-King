  <h1>Chapter 981 Mysterious Power</h1>

  <div>

    <p>There had never been any errors in Wang Ling's deductions before, but this time he was mistaken, and it was a little strange — there were clearly no fluctuations in Fang Xing's string of fate, but he had been kidnapped without any good reason.</p>

    <p>Given Fang Xing's strength, how could an ordinary kidnapper do anything to him?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling pondered the matter, which was strange from beginning to end.</p>

    <p>"Ling Ling, something doesn't seem right." Even Wang Ming frowned; he was feeling something he had never felt before, as if his heart was congested with blood, which was very uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>"I have an outrageous idea." At that moment, Wang Ling suddenly spoke telepathically. He then turned to Guo Ping, as his plan required him to verify something with Divine Dao Star.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling suspected that apart from Heavenly Dao, Outer Dao and Divine Dao, there might be yet another type of power that existed.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, Bai Youquan brought Fang Xing to the mouth of a blind alley in the city. Next to it was an unfamiliar bar which Fang Xing had never been to. Looking at the situation, he had already entered the territory of Bai Youquan and his people from the moment he stepped onto this street.</p>

    <p>Two men in suits guarded the mouth of the blind alley on both sides. When they saw Bai Youquan, they made way for him.</p>

    <p>Although these two were nothing more than underlings doing grunge work as guards, they were Nascent Soul experts.</p>

    <p>When Fang Xing brushed past them, he immediately noticed the tattoos on the necks of the two bruisers: this was the mark of foreign cultivation mercenaries.</p>

    <p>They all had burn scars on their bodies, and Fang Xing instantly had his own conjecture.</p>

    <p>However, he didn't expect Bai Youquan to be so forthcoming after they entered the blind alley. "Classmate Fang guessed right: these are all people who have already died. They are foreigners who died in battle for their former organizations, and are all fearsome individuals."</p>

    <p>"You also brought them back to life?"</p>

    <p>"That's right," Bai Youquan said. "They died for their former organizations, and are men with unyielding and iron wills. After resurrecting them, they too now serve us wholeheartedly. These are soldiers who aren't afraid of death. Furthermore, since they are already dead, they are no longer connected to their former organizations."</p>

    <p>Bai Youquan laughed. "Also, these people have already been dead for more than three hundred years, and were already reduced to bone ash long ago.</p>

    <p>"No one would expect them to come back to life. Whether they died for their organizations or it was the organizations that wanted them dead, there's nothing on them; even if their corpses had remained, there's nothing to trace."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing was astonished when he heard this. It was truly a master strategy to have dead men - dead for over a few hundred years, no less - continue in service to one's organization; probably no one else had come up with this idea before.</p>

    <p>Resurrection magic did exist in the world, but given its complexity, the law of equivalent exchange, and the law of conservation of spirit power, resurrecting a person required one to sacrifice a lot of things.</p>

    <p>For example, cutting off a limb might only buy you one or two years of life. Not only wasn't the spell worth it, it was also forbidden magic. However, it seemed that Bai Youquan's organization had the power to disregard this prohibition and use this resurrection spell as if it was an ordinary one.</p>

    <p>Mass resurrection...</p>

    <p>Fang Xing couldn't imagine it; these peculiar methods used by Bai Youquan and his people left him speechless.</p>

    <p>Bai Youquan led Fang Xing to the very end of the blind alley.</p>

    <p>After Bai Youquan performed a hand seal, a strange magic array glowed on the wall. It was densely covered in runes that Fang Xing couldn't read; this definitely wasn't spiritual or divine language, since Fang Xing had already seen the written language of the divine race on Divine Dao Star.</p>

    <p>The runes of the magic array were clearly distinctively different from any written language that Fang Xing knew of. The characters looked more like the language of ants; at first glance, they looked like dots which didn't seem different from one another.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing's expression hardened when he saw these cryptic runes. Everything was too strange and beyond what he could grasp.</p>

    <p>He felt like he had sunk deep into a huge hole that he couldn't get out of.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Fang, it's still too early to be surprised. There are still many things you have yet to see." Bai Youquan pressed his palm to the magic array, and Fang Xing saw it glow as it twisted into a complicated shape before the light faded.</p>

    <p>In the end, a mouth suddenly appeared in the center of the magic array.</p>

    <p>An old, soul-shaking voice rang out, sounding like a creature of ancient times that had been revived.</p>

    <p>"Please verify your identity..."</p>

    <p>This voice rocked Fang Xing; it felt like his soul was being pulled out and reeled in by that voice.</p>

    <p>In that moment, Fang Xing was abruptly curious about this profound power; he suddenly felt that everything he had ever learned was nothing in the face of such power.</p>

    <p>So much so that his soul and heart started to tremble.</p>

    <p>But very quickly, Fang Xing regained his senses as a familiar aura drew him back to reality. There was an eraser in his pocket which Wang Ling had given him; Fang Xing had borrowed it from Wang Ling during the mid-term exams, but had forgotten to return it afterward, and Wang Ling also hadn't asked for it back.</p>

    <p>When Fang Xing remembered later, it was already the summer break and he didn't plan to give it back. At that very moment, it was precisely the power in this eraser which called Fang Xing back to reality and prevented his soul from being sucked out by this mysterious power.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing realized that this power was a bit like a drug; once you were pulled in, it was very hard to get out.</p>

    <p>"Please verify your identity." At that moment, the grotesque mouth in the middle of the magic array spoke again.</p>

    <p>After the mouth spoke both times, Bai Youquan didn't verify his identity right away; instead, it seemed that he was waiting for this mysterious power to devour Fang Xing. But oddly enough, Fang Xing was unaffected.</p>

    <p>Perhaps it was because of the eraser, but the second time the old voice rang out, Fang Xing wasn't affected and felt very clear-headed. He also saw Bai Youquan's bemused expression next to him.</p>

    <p>Bai Youquan narrowed his eyes, and in the end, stuck his hand inside the mouth.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing: "???"</p>

    <p>Bai Youquan: "The identity verification is a little complicated. You have to put your entire arm into the mouth, and then recite the password. If it's someone not from the organization trying to sneak in, their arm will be bitten off."</p>

    <p>As soon as Bai Youquan said that, the mouth of the array: "※&amp;xnsj※кдёзйзж..."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing: "???"</p>

    <p>Bai Youquan: "It's telling me to recite the password. After all, it can't speak properly with a hand in its mouth."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing: "..."</p>

    <p>Then, Bai Youquan looked seriously at the mouth and said, "I am Bai Youquan. I like to dance, rap and play basketball <sup>1</sup> !"</p>
