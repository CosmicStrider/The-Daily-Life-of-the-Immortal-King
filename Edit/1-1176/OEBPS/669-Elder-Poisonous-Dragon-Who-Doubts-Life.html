  <h1>Chapter 669 Elder Poisonous Dragon Who Doubts Life</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>He noticed that since putting on the collar, Xiao Yin seemed to pick up another strange trait... Were all the people in this villa masochists? That wasn't right! Although he himself had begged Elder Poisonous Dragon to kill him just now, that had been for a purpose, which was a performance test! How could a normal person derive pleasure from little candles and a whip?</p>

    <p>Right! He wasn't a masochist! He was a normal person who had no choice but to sacrifice himself for his job...</p>

    <p>Mm, Lord Diulei felt much better at this thought.</p>

    <p>The question was, when did Brother Xiao's strange masochistic tendencies awaken?</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei felt very puzzled.</p>

    <p>Could Brother Xiao discovering this strange trait have something to do with the path of Dao?</p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon truly now regretted joining this operation.</p>

    <p>He was now basically certain that he had met two "big perverts" who liked to be hit, and furthermore couldn't die no matter how much they were beaten.</p>

    <p>Even this silver-haired young man in front of him was stronger than he thought, let alone Great Death-Courting Senior who resurrected weirdly without end.</p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon had exerted all his power in that move just now, but it didn't even penetrate the other party's body.</p>

    <p>How was that possible... Elder Poisonous Dragon's first reaction was that the information supplied by Mo Immortal Castle was most likely wrong.</p>

    <p>All of the Demon Hunters Association's operations this time was based on information from Mo Immortal Castle!</p>

    <p>The information contained everything that the Demon Hunters Association wanted to know, including the data on this silver-haired young man.</p>

    <p>And based on this information, Elder Poisonous Dragon was the best person for this job... but the problem was that Elder Poisonous Dragon was now in an awkward situation!</p>

    <p>He couldn't beat these two at all!</p>

    <p>His Adam's apple bobbed and a few drops of cold sweat ran down his forehead.</p>

    <p>If he reported back in this sort of situation, he would definitely become a laughingstock.</p>

    <p>"No choice, I can only use my trump card."</p>

    <p>At that moment, Elder Poisonous Dragon's face suddenly darkened. When Lord Diulei saw this, he felt that things weren't simple. "Brother Xiao, be careful!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin folded his arms with a "bring it on" expression on his face. After that initial clash with Elder Poisonous Dragon, he could already tell what this Elder Poisonous Dragon's overall strength was like.</p>

    <p>He was indeed a little stronger than Mr Lu and Elder Zuo Wu back then.</p>

    <p>But Xiao Yin had also been cultivating these days! Although he was now absorbed in writing novels, he didn't skip out on cultivating every day! Master had given him so many crispy noodle snacks, but he hadn't digested all of them yet! After they were all digested and absorbed, there would be a massive improvement in his strength.</p>

    <p>The fact was that with the help of the crispy noodle snacks, Xiao Yin was improving every day. One crispy noodle snack packet instantly gave Xiao Yin "abundant spirit energy"; in this state, a holy beast's speed of cultivation was a full fifty times faster than a cultivator in seclusion in a precious location with feng shui!</p>

    <p>Hence, Xiao Yin was even stronger than when they'd captured Mr Lu not long ago.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin thus now urgently needed to find an equally-matched opponent in order to test his strength; in the end, this Elder Poisonous Dragon just happened to come calling!</p>

    <p>Although he was a little unhappy about being interrupted, it was in any case a rare chance to temper himself â€” he wouldn't waste it!</p>

    <p>"You should have more powerful moves, right? That one just now was a little mild... Boring," Xiao Yin complained to Elder Poisonous Dragon.</p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon's lips twitched fiercely. "..." Motherfucker! He had used all his strength just now! Are you even human?!</p>

    <p>The next moment, Elder Poisonous Dragon took a deep breath, and Lord Diulei and Xiao Yin then saw a purple and blue spirit light in his hands...</p>

    <p>"Two energies?"</p>

    <p>This purple spirit light was in fact spirit energy, but there was a condensed blue light mixed into it; this was the first time Xiao Yin had sensed such a thing and it felt a little strange.</p>

    <p>But relying on general knowledge, one could basically determine that this blue light was also a type of energy source, just like spirit energy and primordial qi.</p>

    <p>This energy was denser than spirit energy, but weaker than primordial qi.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei recalled what Zhuo Yi had mentioned on the phone earlier. This group of Demon Hunters Association cultivators were all overseas returnees who had studied on Sun Island.</p>

    <p>Then... the true face of this energy source was very clear.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Shit! Brother Xiao! Be careful! It's chakra!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was startled. "What's that..."</p>

    <p>"It's a type of energy which only ninjas from Sun Island have," said Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>But spirit energy and this kind of ninja chakra reacted adversely to each other, so generally speaking, it was impossible to use these two energy sources at the same time...</p>

    <p>In other words, this group of cultivators from the Demon Hunters Association had found a way to use both energy sources simultaneously?</p>

    <p>At that moment, Lord Diulei was lost in thought.</p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon smiled and snorted coldly. "As expected of the legendary Great Death-Courting Senior; you are indeed experienced. It cost us a lot to learn to cultivate this second energy source back then. While we're not fully adept at using this kind of power yet, it can give our strength a huge boost in the short term."</p>

    <p>Although this was the case, Lord Diulei didn't believe that there wasn't any cost at all in simultaneously using two types of energy sources which repelled each other.</p>

    <p>The next moment, Elder Poisonous Dragon's right hand transformed again into a huge drill the size of a refrigerator.</p>

    <p>It had to be said that his move this time had majestic momentum!</p>

    <p>"Ninjutsu. Lightning Poisonous Dragon Drill Tenth Form: Aisin Gioro Right Hand Screw Rule!"</p>

    <p>Then, that huge drill rushed at Xiao Yin with a rumble.</p>

    <p>This was indeed a powerful attack.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin frowned tightly, ready for action.</p>

    <p>Then, he stuck out his chest to meet Elder Poisonous Dragon's drill head on; there was even a vaguely bashful expression on his face. "More... More, please!"</p>

    <p>The two collided with the violent sound of cracking metal, like a house being renovated.</p>

    <p>Ten minutes later...</p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon completely gave up.</p>

    <p>His hand was so sore!!! More tired than when he masturbating!!!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon was truly a little afraid this time. His tyrannical attitude from when he had burst in earlier and directly made a move without saying much was completely gone.</p>

    <p>Because he knew that there was no way he could defeat these two!</p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon: "What, what do you want?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was straightaway stunned. The hoodlum who had selfishly charged into someone else's house was actually asking them what they wanted?</p>

    <p>Where is your pride as a hoodlum?!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was a little angry as he looked at Elder Poisonous Dragon. "How can you give up like that? A drill! Is a man's romance<sup>1</sup>!"</p>
