  <h1>Chapter 118 Senior Great Saint, Are You Alright? </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Listening to the goateed elderly Taoist's words, Director Song genuinely felt that the Ten Saints' brutality wasn't just for show.</p>

    <p>Previously, Song Qingshu had heard a rumor that the Ten Saints had once been hired by someone to take revenge on the ghost clan. The reason was that the person hadn't been able to obtain an SSR while playing <em>Onmyoji </em><sup>1</sup> ... in the end, after preparing for three days, the Ten Saints dropped in on the ghost clan and massacred all of them in one day; even Shutendoji <sup>2</sup> , the young master of the ghost clan, hadn't been let off.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>('Onmyoji' is a mobile game set
in a mythical Japan where
humans and supernatural
beings co-exist. An SSR is a
"Specially Super Rare" item
that cannot be obtained in a
game through normal means.)</dfn>
    
    <br/>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Shutendoji is a famous Heian
monster in Japanese legend.)</dfn>

    <p>In Song Qingshu's view, making enemies of the Xiao Clan was unnecessary trouble, and it would be best if they could avoid it. But clearly, given the Ten Saints' savage nature, it would be impossible to ask this bunch of people to consider the impact on power relations between the large clans; there was no way they would let this fighting lion go.</p>

    <p>Additionally, Director Song had also heard a faint warning in the other man's words which could roughly be summarized as: <em>we will listen to you, but don't meddle in the way we do things, otherwise we're going to have to disagree, and it won't be a pretty sight.</em></p>

    <p>He wasn't a fool; he naturally understood the implications.</p>

    <p>When all was said and done, in the end it still came down to realms. While the modern cultivation world placed high importance on a lawful society and a hierarchical management system, there were still those who were arrogant about their realms and thus were contemptuous of social rights.</p>

    <p>The Ten Saints were a perfect example.</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu's heart was as clear as a mirror. The reason why this bunch of people still listened to him now was purely to give the Lord of the Castle face. As soon as he fell low enough for the Lord to cast him out, he would find himself in a very dangerous situation.</p>

    <p>After pondering for a moment, Song Qingshu let out a sigh. "The Lord's only demand was that we seize the stone ghost mask. Seniors can decide for yourselves how you would like to deal with the fighting lion and that youngster. But I have to point out that this youngster is someone whom Lord Diulei invited to come here, so there definitely has to be something extraordinary about him. When you make a move later, please do be cautious..."</p>

    <p>" <em>Hehe </em>, he's just a kid. Judging from the way he's dressed, I reckon he's just a lackey Lord Diulei asked to come. We've been cultivating the Demonic Path for thousands of years, is there any kind of demon or ghost that we haven't seen? It's just one lackey, what do we have to be afraid of?"</p>

    <p>The goateed elderly Taoist sneered as he surveyed their surroundings before saying slowly, "Brothers, listen to my command, we'll make a move together. We'll use the build-up of spiritual pressure from the Heaven and Earth Spirit Awakening Array and throw it at this villa! Any living thing inside will definitely be reduced to meat patties! When the time comes, we can process these patties to make Laoganma <sup>3</sup> minced meat sauce; this type of fresh meat sauce is the Ghost General's favorite!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(Lao Gan Ma is a well-known brand of chili sauces in China.)</dfn>

    <p>Director Song and the man in a suit next to him broke out in a sweat; using spiritual pressure to flatten their opponents into meat patties was bad enough, but to want to make them into meat sauce... this was too insane!</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu looked at the monitor screen once again; in the back of the car, the goateed elderly Taoist who was leader of the Ten Saints, Great Saint, had already officially started array operations. The Heaven and Earth Spirit Awakening Array had switched from surveillance mode to offensive mode. From the scene on the monitor screen, Director Song could see that the massive spiritual pressure had already started to generate unstable fluctuations.</p>

    <p>The attack had officially begun.</p>

    <p>Spiritual pressure was an invisible flux that couldn't be seen with the naked eye, and could only be detected through a cultivator's spiritual senses.</p>

    <p>Streams of air twined and merged above the head of the goateed elderly Taoist. Then, the ten Soul Formation cultivators released spiritual pressure together at the same time; the pressure converged into an energy stream that swirled and hovered in the air above them as a large, infinite vortex.</p>

    <p>When this spiritual pressure reached maximum capacity, the goateed elderly Taoist roared, "Have a taste of my godly strength â€” there is no stronghold we cannot overcome!"</p>

    <p>Then, this invisible energy stream suddenly shot straight up to form a pillar of energy that broke through the dense cloud layer in the sky.</p>

    <p>"That youngster inside the villa, along with the fighting lion, will face certain death today!" The goateed elderly Taoist smiled coldly. As if he was doing maths formula conversions, he manipulated this huge energy stream to come flooding back down from the sky!</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu stared at the monitor screen and broke out in a cold sweat. The Lord of the Castle had requested that they grab the stone ghost mask preferably without involving other people. This torrential spiritual pressure generated by the Heaven and Earth Spirit Awakening Array was a large-scale spiritual attack. They had to aim and strike their target precisely, otherwise no living thing would survive the spiritual oppression of ten Soul Formation realms as it came pouring down!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was drawing a talisman in the villa when he noticed the cinnabar on the table trembling minutely.</p>

    <p>He silently raised his head and looked up at the ceiling.</p>

    <p>Spiritual pressure from the cosmos?</p>

    <p>He was a little surprised.</p>

    <p>He hadn't expected that there would still be people nowadays who knew how to set up a Heaven and Earth Spirit Awakening Array; this was one of the four holy arrays that had been used against the demon race back then.</p>

    <p>It seemed that these really weren't ordinary people.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling paid it no mind at all as he turned his head to look at the fighting lion next to him. This guy was already so frightened that it had curled into itself like a snail. Spirit beasts were more sensitive to this type of spiritual oppression than ordinary people, similar to how creepy-crawlies could sense an impending earthquake. Although this fighting lion was powerful, it was obviously still not strong enough to withstand the spiritual oppression of ten Soul Formation cultivators.</p>

    <p>The other party's intention was clear: they wanted to use invisible spiritual pressure to get rid of them... but Wang Ling felt that their technique was still immature. The advantage of the Heaven and Earth Spirit Awakening Array lay in its convergence with invisible power from the cosmos. Even his clone could sense that the other party clearly lacked understanding and proficiency when it came to this spirit array.</p>

    <p>As this invisible spiritual pressure approached the villa, Wang Ling calmly raised his head and blew out a breath...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Inside the limousine, Director Song and his subordinate next to him were looking at the monitor screen.</p>

    <p>It had been thirty seconds since the Heaven and Earth Spirit Awakening Array's offensive mode had been activated, as invisible spiritual pressure from the cosmos converged and was launched in an attack. However, whether it was the back of the car or the villa on the monitor screen, everything was utterly still, without even a hint of a wave in the air.</p>

    <p>"Senior Great Saint... did it work?" asked Song Qingshu.</p>

    <p>The goateed elderly Taoist narrowed his eyes as he said loftily, " <em>Heh </em>, they're dead for sure. It takes time for the spiritual pressure to come down, you just need to be patient!"</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu: "..."</p>

    <p>Another thirty seconds passed...</p>

    <p>Looking at the monitor screen, Song Qingshu felt that something wasn't right. For some reason, the goateed elderly Taoist's head seemed to be larger than before... had the peripheral nerves in his thighs died, hence why his head was puffing up?</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu cried out in astonishment. "Senior Great Saint, are you alright?"</p>

    <p>The goateed elderly Taoist: "I'm cosplaying Big Head Son <sup>4</sup> ! Don't make a fuss if you don't understand!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>4</sup>('Big Head Son and Small Head
Dad' is a popular Chinese
children's book that was also
adapted into a cartoon ..)</dfn>

    <p>As soon as he said this, his complexion changed... and he coughed up a huge mouthful of blood.</p>

    <p>The goateed elderly Taoist clutched his chest as he shivered. At that moment, the head of this leader of the Ten Saints had already swelled to three times the size of a watermelon. "...It's a Blood Shadow Magic Skill, I can spray blood to kill my enemies! I'll show it to you so you can learn something new!"</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu: "..."</p>

    <p><em>This is obviously a fucking injury from backlash, bloody hell!</em></p>
