  <h1>Chapter 679 An Upgraded Version Of Zhuo Yi</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Thirty-Three Paths to Vitality"- Zhuo Yi opened the exercise book and read what his shifu Wang Ling had written with his own hand. The explanations for the technique were simply far more detailed than that of a textbook. While "Thirty-Three Paths to Vitality" itself was a very small branch of magic, it still came under the Three Thousand Great Spells that were imprinted in Wang Ling's mind like "instinct" as he grew older.</p>

    <p>This technique actually wasn't very useful to Wang Ling himself, but it was tremendously helpful to Zhuo Yi! In addition to increasing the circulation of spirit energy, this technique enabled spirit energy to be stored in reserve in the body's golden core. These reserves were like a water reservoir which could be sluiced opened to release spirit energy any time there was an urgent need for it.</p>

    <p>Although he had only roughly skimmed through it so far, Zhuo Yi was already deeply impressed by the power of this technique... As far as the Golden Core stage was concerned, there was no other similar technique on the market that was more essential or suitable for his cultivation.</p>

    <p>It could be only said that this was just like his shifu!</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi suddenly felt that shamelessly asking to be taken on as a disciple back then had truly been the right choice.</p>

    <p>In addition to this technique, Zhuo Yi also saw something else, which was the array of magic artifacts in Wang Ling's second book!</p>

    <p>At long last... besides long johns, he could also get other protective magic treasures!</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi couldn't help but be excited. The magic artifacts listed in the second exercise book had been carefully selected by Wang Ling. These were the most suitable magic artifacts for Zhuo Yi at this stage... Furthermore, they were all basically life-saving magic treasures.</p>

    <p>The first magic artifact on the first page was the highly recommended Nine Thousand Lightning Movement Boots.</p>

    <p>Seeing this, Zhuo Yi was in a daze. "..." The name of these boots seemed a little familiar to him for some reason!</p>

    <p>Did these boots have anything to do with "Three Thousand Lightning Movement<sup>1</sup>"?</p>

    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A battle skill in the series "Battle Through The Heavens.")</dfn>
    
    <p>It wasn't just the boots, of course; following it were Daoist robes, undergarments and so forth in different styles, and even briefs!</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at Zhuo Yi and raised an eyebrow slightly to indicate that Zhuo Yi could choose whatever he liked... Once Zhuo Yi had decided, Wang Ling would look for the Heavenly Dao again to trade for materials and then create the artifact based on the formula in Eight Classes of Divine Weapons.</p>

    <p>Because he truly couldn't find anyone more suitable than Zhuo Yi to carry the wok for him...</p>

    <p>Hence, Zhuo Yi had to be protected!</p>

    <p>This disciple was cheap, but in order for him to stand firm, Wang Ling had already decided to outfit him in the most expensive kit. From now on, Zhuo Yi was no long Zhuo Yi... but an upgraded Zhuo Yi!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>While Zhuo Yi was choosing his defense gear, Father Wang was fighting his own battle. Actually, this incident happened not long ago, and it was a really rotten and infuriating thing.</p>

    <p>Father Wang found out that the love song "The Starry Sky's Language of Love" which he had written for Mother Wang had been plagiarized by a popular online live streamer. The other party had secretly downloaded the song and then reuploaded it to his own homepage, claiming that it was his own work, and even openly lip-synced to it. The most important thing was that his fans actually enthusiastically applauded it and didn't think it was fishy at all.</p>

    <p>Father Wang was incredibly furious. He had written this song for Mother Wang! And most crucially, it was clearly Lord Diulei's own voice in the song, so how could it be stolen like this?</p>

    <p>Father Wang was very puzzled by this operation no matter how he thought about it.</p>

    <p>Online wars were everywhere these days. Previously, Father Wang had only torn into those anti-fans on the novel platform, utterly fearless! Now that the battlefield had moved to a live streaming platform, Father Wang felt a little bewildered.</p>

    <p>So, after the incident developed, Father Wang's first reaction was to ask his novel fan group for help.</p>

    <p>While there was a hidden big shot in the fan group who had lurked there for years and sent him cigars and helped vie for monthly votes, this thing had only just happened, so Father Wang didn't want to ask him to help out right away.</p>

    <p>Mm, this was mainly because Father Wang wanted to test how fierce the rest of his fans were...</p>

    <p>The song he had written for his wife had been plagiarized; if he didn't so much as make a peep about it, would he still be human?!</p>

    <p>Thus, Father Wang released an official announcement in his fan group: "Concerning live streamer 'Singers Institute' under the banner of 'Shadow Fool Guild' on Langya Broadcasting, our attitude is... no tolerance! Please lend me your support!"</p>

    <dfn><sup>2</sup>("Singers Institute" is the Weibo account of the lip-syncing live streamer "Shadow Entertainment - Dean" on Huya Broadcasting's platform.)</dfn>

    <p>"What? Wang Situ's song was stolen? Is it that latest song 'The Starry Sky's Language of Love'?"</p>

    <p>"That's right, it's a song Brother Wang Situ wrote for sister-in-law, he wrote the lyrics. But this shameless live streamer stole it and even said it was his own song! Look, I still have a video..."</p>

    <p>Several fans promptly replied below. Father Wang was taken aback - he had only just posted today, but why did so many people already know about it? And the scariest thing was that someone actually had a recording!</p>

    <p>Father Wang instantly replied in the group, "Bro, you're amazing..."</p>

    <p>The fan immediately answered, "When I heard the song back then, it sounded so familiar... then I immediately realized it was Brother Wang Situ's song! At that time I even still wondered how the live streamer could sound just like the original when he sang; the feel and vibrato were one hundred percent identical, which was too miraculous! After that, I gave this live streamer a thousand HNY to sing it again, and this time I recorded it!"</p>

    <p>After that, the fan group instantly exploded...</p>

    <p>"Holy shit... bro, you're amazing!"</p>

    <p>"Awesome, awesome!"</p>

    <p>"Then this is evidence, right? It's practically ironclad proof!"</p>

    <p>Father Wang nodded. "This video can indeed be used as evidence, but for now it's not enough. We need to find a professional agency to do an audio comparison. In addition to this, what I've learned here is that this live streamer has a previous record of offenses - he was exposed last year for lip-syncing and plagiarizing songs."</p>

    <p>"Then what is Great Wang Situ's opinion?"</p>

    <p>Father Wang sent a clip of a "slitting the throat" gesture.</p>

    <p>He then sent a string of words to the group: "Fuck him over!"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "He does a lot of lip-syncing videos in his live stream room. You can use a music software's voice recognition function to compare his lip-syncing videos with the original singer, then record this guy lip-syncing and send the video to me with the original music. I'll find someone to evaluate them in one go!"</p>

    <p>At that time, someone asked, "Ah ah ah? Is there a reward?"</p>

    <p>Everyone was shocked. "!!!"</p>

    <p>Sure enough!</p>

    <p>This had to be the power of love!</p>
