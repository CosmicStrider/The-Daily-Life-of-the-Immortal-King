  <h1>Chapter 379 Targeted? </h1>

  <div>

    <p>The entire test went very smoothly, and Er Ha managed to walk out of the test room at around two in the afternoon. Images of its test hadn't been directly made public, because after the ruckus Wei Zhi had caused, there had been too many eyes on it. Thus, Er Ha had decided to keep a low profile, and it left right after the test; this grade assessment originally wasn't anything meaningful to both Er Ha and Wang Ling, and they were in fact just going through the motions.</p>

    <p>Whatever its measure was, Er Ha was very clear about its own value; whatever figure it got would be enough.</p>

    <p>Once the qualification assessment test was done, the qualification certificate would be mailed to the house within three working days, so all Er Ha could do now was wait.</p>

    <p>Thinking about this, Er Ha walked out of the doors of the assessment center, and then was stunned when it realized that Wei Zhi was leaning against a stone pillar waiting for it.</p>

    <p>It hadn't seen Wei Zhi when it had come out of the test hall earlier, so it thought he had already gone. It had never expected that Wei Zhi would be waiting for it here.</p>

    <p>"Yo, Brother Dog! What a coincidence! I only just got out after the test, I never thought we would meet again!" Wei Zhi waved and flashed his white teeth at Er Ha.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..." It had truly never met such a shameless person before.</p>

    <p>Er Ha didn't actually dislike Wei Zhi, and in fact felt that this friendly boy was a little interesting.</p>

    <p>And most importantly, it realized that Wei Zhi was very familiar with the entire spirit beast system of Huaxiu nation. It could be said that he was very knowledgeable, and this was something that Er Ha wanted to know.</p>

    <p>Maybe they could be friends?</p>

    <p>Er Ha pondered this in its heart.</p>

    <p>"How was the test? What class?" As he spoke, Wei Zhi grabbed the rim of his red peaked cap and twisted it around on his head out of habit. This was probably his signature move; Er Ha had seen him do it quite a few times inside the assessment center.</p>

    <p>"Fourth class."</p>

    <p>Er Ha thought it had nothing to hide when it came to its test results.</p>

    <p>Anyway, it had actually held back: its real grade should be peak third class.</p>

    <p>To Er Ha's surprise, Wei Zhi seemed to have anticipated this result as he stared calculatingly at it and smiled slightly. "Brother Dog, you held back, didn't you?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha wagged its tail. "You can tell?"</p>

    <p>"Our family has raised and trained soul pets for generations. We have a secret art which allows us to determine the strength of a spirit beast based on its unique aura. I took a sniff of Brother Dog and felt that your unique aura was very dense... so your strength is at the very least third class." At this point, Wei Zhi suddenly stared at Er Ha and couldn't help wiping at his drool.</p>

    <p>Er Ha was alarmed. "..." The hell?! What did this guy want?</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "Brother Dog, would you mind... if I hugged you for a good whiff?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Get lost..."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi sighed with obvious disappointment. "Ai, how can you be like that, we were fated to meet! I haven't smelled such a rich unique aura in a long time!"</p>

    <p>The corners of Er Ha's mouth twitched. "Are you a dog?"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "How did you know?" <sup>1</sup></p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(To be more precise, Loopy Toad was asking if Wei Zhi had been born in the Chinese zodiac year of the dog ..)</dfn>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>After a moment of silence, Er Ha looked into the distance. "I'm going home."</p>

    <p>Saying this, it leapt down the steps, looking very cool.</p>

    <p>The traffic in front of the center was very heavy as pedestrians flowed by in an endless stream.</p>

    <p>The sun shone directly onto Er Ha's green dog fur, so even in the crowd, it still stood out.</p>

    <p>Standing on the steps, Wei Zhi looked at Er Ha's back and shouted loudly, "Brother Dog! Will we meet again?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha didn't speak, but just raised one of its front paws. Only then did Wei Zhi realize that his cap had actually been taken!</p>

    <p>I'll find you...</p>

    <p>Once it was a distance away from Wei Zhi, Er Ha tilted its head slightly, and then in a flash, it disappeared like a bolt of lightning in the crowd.</p>

    <p>"As expected, Brother Dog isn't simple!"</p>

    <p>On the steps to the entrance of the assessment center, Wei Zhi took out a new cap and put it on, his heart brimming with excitement.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On its way back, Er Ha crouched quietly under the bench at the bus stop as it prepared to take the next spirit bus back to the Wang family's small villa.</p>

    <p>It was how it had gotten here earlier.</p>

    <p>Considering how a dog paying for itself or using a public transport card to ride a vehicle would cause an uproar, Er Ha's usual tactic was to wait for the instant that the bus doors opened, and then slip in like lightning before hiding. Then, it would leave two coins under the seat before getting off.</p>

    <p>This was a tried and tested method, and Er Ha was very confident in being fast enough to get on the bus. Even if they took surveillance videos, unless the images were slowed down fifty times, they still wouldn't even be able to see Er Ha's shadow.</p>

    <p>While Er Ha yawned as it crouched under the bench, a familiar aura suddenly appeared, and Er Ha was instantly on alert.</p>

    <p>It had smelled this aura before!</p>

    <p>And it was very clear that this aura was hostile.</p>

    <p>Under the bench, Er Ha narrowed its eyes and saw a guy in a black windbreaker appear in front of it!</p>

    <p>Er Ha was sure that this was the man with the bone dragon at the test hall earlier!</p>

    <p>Did he want revenge?</p>

    <p>Er Ha couldn't help laughing inwardly. It didn't bother to avoid the man, and simply came out directly.</p>

    <p>But just as it emerged, several dark shadows came out of nowhere in a flash to immediately surround it! These people were carrying rope and a cage; most terrible of all was that one of them was holding an electric prod. This bunch laughed vulgarly; it was obvious from their faces that they didn't have good intentions.</p>

    <p>The fuck... what did they want?</p>

    <p>Er Ha knew it had been targeted.</p>

    <p>Staring at the men in black in front of it, Er Ha was very calm in its heart. There were five men that had surrounded it, and they were all Golden Core cultivators. If it had just been one or two of them, Er Ha thought it could have completely handled it, but in the current situation... After all, four paws were really no match for ten hands, and fighting back would really be too difficult.</p>

    <p>But it would still have a chance if it ran.</p>

    <p>Er Ha felt a little resentful at this thought; whatever had happened in the past, it had still been a demon king... If it wasn't because it had yet to recover its full strength, it could have swallowed these petty mongrel cultivators up in one bite!</p>

    <p>"Hello, Mr Dog. Our organization is very interested in you and would like to invite you to have some tea and a snack." The man in black with the bone dragon was holding a rope and had a sinister smile on his face as he spoke.</p>

    <p>Er Ha looked at these men in black in shock. They were actually kidnapping a dog of the people in broad daylight... It had just come out for a bit to take the test for the qualification certificate, but had been targeted. What kind of shitty situation was this?</p>

    <p>"What if I say no?" Er Ha looked at the man and replied.</p>

    <p>The man in black pulled out the electric prod he was carrying. "This electric prod is a specially remodeled electroshock magic treasure which can deliver a hundred thousand volts of electricity." Saying this, the man chuckled. "If you won't come with us, I'll even stun a ghost for you to see!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>
