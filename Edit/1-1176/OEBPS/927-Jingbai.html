  <h1>Chapter 927 Jingbai</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This was the first time Jingke had combined with the scabbard.</p>

    <p>When the two silhouettes in the air overlapped and merged into a new one, powerful godly power instantly enveloped the entire palace. The landscape shook, dislodging falling rocks, and hundreds of divine pillars cracked and looked like they would collapse at any time.</p>

    <p>After the fusion, Jingke had also transformed.</p>

    <p>His hair had lengthened and now fell to his waist, and a white ahoge which was Bai Qiao's trademark grew out of the top of his head.</p>

    <p>This youngster after the fusion was an image Wang Ling had never seen before. Jingke was taller, and looked like he had grown up a lot. His white robe had become a magnificent snow-white fur coat, and his entire figure exuded a noble and extremely haughty temperament.</p>

    <p>The youngster looked at Wang Ling and gave him a bow, before turning his eyes to his opponent in front of him â€” the throne who claimed to be a true god from the divine realm.</p>

    <p>Through the power of the contract, Wang Ling very quickly learned the identity of this "new person."</p>

    <p>So he was called Jingbai...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling said the name in his heart and it echoed in his mind.</p>

    <p>"Who are you?!" The throne was shocked by this terrifying aura and was afraid.</p>

    <p>"You don't deserve to know this king's name..."</p>

    <p>As Jingbai stared at the throne, the godly power on him transformed into a number of qi swords to form a protective sword array. Boundless sword light then surged forth like a multitude of falling stars, covered by a brown hue.</p>

    <p>Star Lord's Divine Palace was destroyed in an instant. Wang Ling had still been sitting by a divine pillar earlier, but in the blink of an eye, it had already collapsed, and everything around them was in utter ruins.</p>

    <p>A pile of broken golden rocks glowed, and the throne turned into a ray of light which burst out of the rubble. There was already no sign of Divine Dao Star's Star Lord; in the split second that Jingbai attacked, the throne had compressed and turned Star Lord into a gem, which was now embedded in its armrest.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>It seemed that the gems on the throne weren't ordinary at all; the Three-Headed Phoenixes had also been sealed inside earlier.</p>

    <p>It was likely that there was something even more formidable in the rest of the gems.</p>

    <p>What happened next proved Wang Ling's guess right.</p>

    <p>A pitch-black gem which glowed with the holy light of primal chaos was removed from the throne. In the end, a massive divine figure formed in the air. This divine figure was pure white, as if it carried a pure and holy radiance, and the whole world was covered in the shadow of its sixteen wings.</p>

    <p>This divine figure wrapped itself around the throne, its every move exuding a terrible divine aura. Godly power boiled and dried up the air at a temperature which could melt all living things.</p>

    <p>The ruins beneath were completely vaporized.</p>

    <p>For one moment, the revolt happening in the main city center fell silent.</p>

    <p>Everyone saw this massive shadow of a god, and intense godly power burst out in the sky to surge forth in all directions.</p>

    <p>This was an epic battle!</p>

    <p>"16-Winged God is a deity of the divine realm. Once he makes a move, there's no escape," said the throne. Wrapped up tightly by 16-Winged God, it brimmed with confidence at that moment and didn't believe that it could lose this battle. This wasn't its homeground, so it couldn't use too much godly power, and could only summon 16-Winged God.</p>

    <p>In the divine realm, there were also 32-Winged God, 46-Winged God, and 98-Winged God...</p>

    <p>But thinking about it, the throne felt that 16-Winged God was more than enough to deal with the current situation.</p>

    <p>At that moment, 16-Winged God clasped his hands together. Golden light poured forth, and a holy sword extended out from his palms toward the sky. It was thousands of <em>zhang </em>long, and swung forth with destructive holy splendor.</p>

    <p>"It's His Excellency Star Lord! His Excellency Star Lord is furious!" The Divine Dragons all stopped attacking and dropped to their knees to kowtow. Behind them, the monsters from various other planets were also forced to their knees by the strong pressure, and were unable to move at all.</p>

    <p>The Number 60 High squad also took in this scene from where they were fighting in the distance.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao and the others were trading blows with the commander of the imperial army when they suddenly heard a loud noise; that golden palace had actually collapsed, just like that...</p>

    <p>"This game is too real - it must have cost a lot to make!" Guo Hao was dumbstruck.</p>

    <p>"Yeah, it does feel like the real deal. These CGI effects are kind of awesome. Have our country's special effects already developed this much?" Chen Chao paused in his attack and gazed at 16-Winged God in the distance, his heart trembling slightly.</p>

    <p>The BUFFs on the Number 60 High squad hadn't disappeared; rather, Wang Ling had even enhanced them from a distance.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, Chen Chao and the others at the Foundation Establishment level would be instantly crushed into meaty paste under the pressure of this godly power.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Jingbai looked at 16-Winged God, his eyes as unruffled as an ancient well.</p>

    <p>The next moment, his eyes were fixed on the sky and his expression hardened.</p>

    <p>Nomological laws spun unceasingly in his eyes, and a magic sword larger than 16-Winged God coalesced in the sky!</p>

    <p>This was the World-Annihilating Sword, which was ten thousand- <em>zhang </em>long!</p>

    <p>Everything as far as the eye could see was extinguished!</p>

    <p>16-Winged God and the throne were frightened to death - even the wings symbolic of a deity shed some feathers like a chicken.</p>

    <p>The throne never expected this type of power to burst forth from a mere sword spirit from Earth. After summoning 16-Winged God for this battle, it had been very confident.</p>

    <p>But as soon as the World-Annihilating Sword made a move, the throne instantly knew that it was going to lose!</p>

    <p>"Go!"</p>

    <p>The throne gave a low command to 16-Winged God, who flapped his wings to leave Divine Dao Star and fly to the divine realm on the border of the universe. However, the heavy weight of the World-Annihilating Sword had already fallen on 16-Winged God - it felt like each one of his wings was tied down by a one million-jin weight, as if he had fallen in water.</p>

    <p>"You think I'll let you go..." Jingbai's eyes were extremely cold and aloof. In fact, he had used less than one tenth of his strength to create the massive World-Annihilating Sword with his eyes.</p>

    <p>Thus, Jingbai hadn't been frightened of this 16-Winged God since the beginning.</p>

    <p>In Jingbai's eyes, this was just a white chicken with eight pairs of wings that could be slaughtered at any time.</p>

    <p>"Ah..."</p>

    <p>The huge World-Annihilating Sword sliced down, but even before it made contact with 16-Winged God's body, the latter gave a blood-curdling shriek at just a touch of sword qi on his wings.</p>

    <p>"A petty 16-Winged God acting so arrogantly before this king."</p>

    <p>Jingbai sneered. He stood in the sky with his hands behind his back, the fine white fur of his coat ruffled by the wind.</p>

    <p>"Who on earth are you..." The throne knew it couldn't escape and had drained of color. It never expected the sword to be this sort of figure.</p>

    <p>"I cut off the head of 128-Winged God; even 256-Winged God died with one stroke." Jingbai's words were so terrifying that the throne trembled with fear.</p>

    <p>"If you want to know who this king is, ask your Thousand-Winged God..." Jingbai showed no mercy at all and brought the huge World-Annihilating Sword down.</p>

    <p>"No!!" the throne roared.</p>

    <p>However, Jingbai's movements were too swift.</p>

    <p>The huge World-Annihilating Sword looked cumbersome, but it was actually as fast as the sword of a samurai. In the blink of an eye, from top to bottom, the throne was cut in half and its legs split and shattered into pieces on the spot.</p>
