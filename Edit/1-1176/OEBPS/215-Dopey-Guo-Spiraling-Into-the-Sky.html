  <h1>Chapter 215 Guo Hao Spiraling Into the Sky </h1>

  <div>

    <p>What the old devil said was in fact true. Anyone could stand out in their respective field depending on how they measured up against their contemporaries.</p>

    <p>There was some basis for this thinking, as every villain in history could demonstrate. Some tried to reach a deceitful compromise with the main character through a PY trade, but it backfired on them and got them killed; some pretended to accept disciples with the intent of devouring their souls and flesh, but in the end they failed and self-destructed; and some held their banners high before battle, thinking that they would definitely win, but in the end they were beaten up so badly that even their own mothers couldn't recognize them.</p>

    <p>The old devil thought, moreover, that all villains shared a distinctive characteristic: they talked too much...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>With less than a few minutes to go before the array was activated, Guo Hao was still clutching his stomach in pain in the military training dorm toilets. He didn't know what he had eaten today that was inexplicably causing his stomach to hurt.</p>

    <p>He crouched over the squat toilet, hands gripping the wall handles on both sides and his entire person looked like it was about to collapse.</p>

    <p>What on earth had he eaten?</p>

    <p>He felt that his brain had already lost its ability to think.</p>

    <p>Oh... right.</p>

    <p>Just as he was about to completely collapse, he remembered something.</p>

    <p>It wasn't something that he had eaten today. He recalled when he had walked through the school corridor yesterday, and he had eaten a new dish which Mother Juan had created. It had been a rice dish, where she had turned the rice into shaved ice. Mother Juan had even given it a very nice-sounding name, "fan bing bing <sup>1</sup> ." Back then, she had been trialing this dish in the corridor...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This literally translates into
'rice ice ice,' and is a
homophone of the name of a
famous Chinese actress.)</dfn>

    <p>The issue was that he had only eaten one mouthful! Also, he hadn't felt any discomfort at the time.</p>

    <p>Covering his stomach, Guo Hao wanted to cry but had no tears to shed.</p>

    <p>At that moment, he was amazed to discover that Mother Juan's black cuisine had been elevated once again... it now actually had a delayed effect, which was just too scary!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The minutes ticked by, and when Guo Hao looked weakly at the time, he discovered that it was almost six o'clock. He had already been in the toilet for more than ten minutes...</p>

    <p>It was at that moment that he saw the tiles under his feet unexpectedly start to tremble slightly.</p>

    <p>An earthquake?</p>

    <p>Guo Hao felt it was doubtful; the tremors didn't feel strong enough to be an earthquake.</p>

    <p>Just then, he saw a white light shine through the partition cracks from the next cubicle.</p>

    <p>Na... nani <sup>2</sup> ?!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>('Nani' means 'what' in Japanese.)</dfn>

    <p>Guo Hao was so scared he pissed, and in the next moment, he felt his body gradually become nothingness as he followed a dense rolling cloud of mist ahead of him. He could feel himself being dragged down an endless passage toward a new map by a strange force.</p>

    <p>Am I crossing over?</p>

    <p>By the time he reacted, he could already feel strong blasts of wind blowing between his legs.</p>

    <p>He was astonished when he realized that he had actually been directly teleported while he had been taking a dump, and now, he was spiraling into the sky <sup>3</sup> with bare buttocks...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(This is probably a reference to
a scene from the fantasy
anime "Kobayashi-san Chi no
Maid Dragon .. ")</dfn>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the conference room of the military training base on the western outskirts of Songhai city, the old Secretary sat on a long bench and looked at the big TV screen in front of him. In the lower right corner of the screen was a radar, and it showed countless red dots densely packed together. "The transmission array has already been activated, right? Have the numbers been confirmed?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, they've already been confirmed." Standing next to the old Secretary, Zhuo Yi was reporting the details. "Before the transmission array was officially opened, we had already asked the teachers leading their school teams to carefully confirm that all the students were filling in the camp handbook inside the dorm. Some of them weren't in their rooms, but they were in the toilets... no one was overlooked."</p>

    <p>The old Secretary nodded. "Mm, that's good."</p>

    <p>In... the toilet?</p>

    <p>In the conference room, several of the headmasters couldn't help the way the corners of their mouths twitched.</p>

    <p>They could already imagine the shock of the students who were suddenly transported away while still taking a dump or peeing. In this situation, would they be so scared that they'd suck their shit or piss right back in?</p>

    <p>The old Secretary laughed. "An unexpected situation, now that's reality. Don't we need to really see the students for who they are?"</p>

    <p>"The old Secretary is right..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi sweated a little. "Currently, they are in the ascending stage. After the array sends them to the map, it will automatically direct them up to a height of five kilometers, and finally let them all down at the same time, leaving them free to choose where they want to land."</p>

    <p>"What about safety? Are there any problems?"</p>

    <p>"Rest assured, old Secretary, General Yi personally set up this small world. Their descent will be slowed down once they are a hundred meters from the ground."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi continued reporting the situation. "The instructors in charge of the survival drill have also entered the map; their radar signals are blue. As the chief commander, Senior Immortal Toya will ensure that the students remain safe during the drill. The magic artifacts were all specially created for the small world. Once the small world judges that a student's vital point has been hit, the body will emit green smoke, and the student will be considered out."</p>

    <p>The rules for survival and the elimination mechanism this time were actually easy to understand, and were simpler than those for the previous spirit sword exchange meet.</p>

    <p>As Director of the General Administration of 100 Schools in Songhai city, it could be said that Zhuo Yi had worked his heart out on this plan; from the moment the higher-ups had given him this task, he had spared no effort in formulating the process and guidelines this time, and had come up with contingency plans for every kind of situation that might happen.</p>

    <p>This was because he knew that shifu was a person who had always disliked troublesome matters, and liked to keep a low profile...</p>

    <p>But however meticulously prepared a plan was, it was almost impossible for it to be perfectly soundproof.</p>

    <p>Standing next to the old Secretary, Zhuo Yi's face looked a little troubled. "Secretary Dakang, I've just received information saying that there are fluctuations coming from the Gate Between Worlds again, and the coordinates are near us."</p>

    <p>Gate Between Worlds?</p>

    <p>The old Secretary frowned, feeling that this was a bit too much of a coincidence. With a solemn expression, he lowered his head and said, "Back then, General Yi and I joined hands in a group of ten people to seal the Gate Between Worlds. Under normal circumstances, it's impossible to undo the seal on the Gate in such a short time. I have a feeling that someone is causing mischief behind the scenes."</p>

    <p>"The fact that the coordinates of the Gate's fluctuations are so close to us is bad."</p>

    <p>"It'll be terrible if it's dangerous to the children."</p>

    <p>"Old Secretary, should we call for reinforcements?"</p>

    <p>"We can keep that as a contingency plan, let's check the situation first." The old Secretary waved his hand and frowned as he said, "In any case, the headmasters of the six schools and I are here. We must be fully responsible for the safety of the students."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was extremely surprised; he had completely never expected that the old Secretary would actually use reinforcements as a backup plan. "Is the Gate Between Worlds truly that terrifying?"</p>

    <p>"When the demon army retreated back then, ten of us joined hands to shut the Gate. After that, we calculated that our combined power had been almost a billion jin , which had been barely enough for us to push the Gate shut. But each of us had held some power in reserve and we hadn't used all of our strength since we hadn't expected the Gate to be that heavy..."</p>

    <p>The old Secretary looked like he was reminiscing about a lot of things, then he got up and sighed. "If the Gate Between Worlds reappears, I'll shut it at all costs, even if I have to sacrifice this old life. If the demon army rises up once again, that will be very bad for us."</p>
