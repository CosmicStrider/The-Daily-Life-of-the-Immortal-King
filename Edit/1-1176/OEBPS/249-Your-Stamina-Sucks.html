  <h1>Chapter 249 Your Stamina Sucks! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Er Ha felt that its foreshadowing dream was a little like the golden millet dream<sup>1</sup>. The difference, however, was that in the legendary golden millet dream, one experienced and enjoyed a lifetime of prosperity, only to wake up and find that the millet hadn't finished cooking. But with Er Ha's own dream, it couldn't discern what on earth it was trying to say.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is based on the Chinese folktale "The Dream of the Pillow"in which a poor, young scholar falls asleep while waiting for his meal of millet to cook, &amp; dreams of his rise to power. When he wakes up, the millet is still cooking)</dfn>

    <p>Er Ha didn't know who that wildly laughing maniac in its dream with the one hundred magic swords behind him was, nor the fat man whose heart had been stabbed by those swords.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, Er Ha realized that their faces were becoming more and more blurry. The HD unpixelated features which had been so clear during the dream had in a short instant become just shadows in its mind.</p>

    <p>Er Ha scratched its dog head and looked a little jittery. It wanted to tell Little Master Ling about the dream, but Wang Ling was currently still busy and had no time for it at all.</p>

    <p>After thinking about it, Er Ha decided to record its dream down first in its Human Observation Diary before it forgot more of it again.</p>

    <p>After Wang Ling finished cleaning Jingke, he noticed that Er Ha had already fallen asleep at the foot of the bed. He flipped through his study materials and spent two minutes reviewing them and three minutes preparing for the next lesson before he was ready to take a break.</p>

    <p>After the military training, life had slowed down once again, returning to the rhythm that was Wang Ling's favorite and the one he was most familiar with. But while he had always felt that the communal life didn't suit him, he now didn't think it was as terrible as he had imagined.</p>

    <p>The pace of life had slowed down, but matters requiring attention hadn't decreased at all.</p>

    <p>He already knew about the incident with Boss Tan; he had always felt that the identity of the Master of Immortal Mansion wasn't simple. At the very least, he was currently the most difficult person whom Wang Ling had ever had to deal with, and more troublesome than even the old devil.</p>

    <p>General Yi had successfully captured the old devil this time purely because the old devil had yet to recover his peak strength. The other reason was that the devil emperor had in the end been straightforward in how he did things; he was far less sly than the Master of Immortal Mansion.</p>

    <p>When that Immortal Mansion youth had appeared under the hawthorn tree and caused a ruckus, Wang Ling had left a trace of his spirit energy on the other person's Abyss Avoidance sword, but until now there hadn't been a response from it.</p>

    <p>He had no idea if this trace had been discovered or not.</p>

    <p>For dark forces, the worst taboo they could commit was exposing their sect's whereabouts.</p>

    <p>One thing that Wang Ling could be sure of was that the Master of Immortal Mansion would definitely be on guard against this possibility.</p>

    <p>Now, they could only wait for further news from Boss Tan's little brother Tan Qian.</p>

    <p>At his desk, Wang Ling looked at Jingke, and his eyebrows couldn't help twitching.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if the Master of Immortal Mansion's ultimate aim truly was to create a supreme godly sword...</p>

    <p>But he could be sure of one thing.</p>

    <p>That was...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was June 21st on Tuesday in the ninth week of the semester.</p>

    <p>Sheep was on time after school as she showed up in an alley next to Number 60 High School and leaned against the wall while she waited for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was initially supposed to take her to get painted today, but because he had to help rebuild the bodies of the deliverymen and so wasn't free, Wang Ling would take her instead.</p>

    <p>Just before the end of school, Lord Diulei sent Wang Ling the address. The owner of the magic weapons shop had the surname Luo and was a smith who was excellent at his craft. He had already done maintenance on Sheep once, and everything had seemed to go very smoothly and easily, so there was no need to worry about his skill in the least.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, Boss Luo was also part of their group of friends; it was just that he didn't usually like to chat online and also hadn't joined the chat group.</p>

    <p>He was also the one who repaired Immortal Toya's furnaces whenever they exploded.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had already sensed Sheep's position as soon as he stepped out of the school gate.</p>

    <p>When he turned into the alley, he actually found Sheep surrounded by a bunch of delinquents with dyed hair and nose rings and earrings, with some of them wearing gold chains around their necks; anyone who didn't know what was going on would probably think that they were rappers from the variety show The Rap of China.</p>

    <p>Sheep was only one hundred and forty centimeters tall, shorter than Jingke, and her small frame was surrounded by these delinquents. She was wearing a little gray coat and her small face was so white and cute that anyone who saw it would want to bite it.</p>

    <p>At that moment, she was leaning against the wall, her face expressionless.</p>

    <p>"Big brother, she looks like she's still a kid..."</p>

    <p>"Don't you know the saying, 'the body of a lolita, the heart of an imperial sister'? It's more interesting to play with a kid like this!"</p>

    <p>A tattooed man with two gold chains around his neck panted and his eyes sized Sheep up and down excitedly. "Little friend, are you lost? Come with big brother, I'll buy you a lollipop and take you out to play!"</p>

    <p>Looking at this scene from a distance, Wang Ling narrowed his eyes, but had no intention of intervening.</p>

    <p>The fact was that in the face of hooligans and delinquents like these, if you gave them an inch with your reticence, they would take a mile. The tattooed man with gold chains didn't bother enticing Sheep with too many words before he started to directly make a move. Eyes fixed on her hair buns, he stretched out his hand. They were so cute that no one could resist wanting to rub them.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately for this gold-chained delinquent, he had barely reached out before Sheep directly dodged sideways so that he wound up snatching at air.</p>

    <p>"Wow, hey, so agile?" He hadn't anticipated the little lolita to be so fast. Also, when he had reached for her, he had seen her completely cross her eyebrows and puff up her cheeks in anger.</p>

    <p>Tch, this was exactly the type of bad temper that he liked!</p>

    <p>The gold-chained delinquent laughed and his expression became even more obscene. He directly stretched out his hands to grab Sheep.</p>

    <p>But Sheep's movements were really too fast, just like the wind. She was clearly just dodging left and right, but in such a small space, it looked like an illusion.</p>

    <p>The jaws of the stunned delinquents had all dropped — this definitely wasn't regular human speed! This lolita's movements were really too fast! They couldn't be seen with the naked eye at all!</p>

    <p>She was clearly a cultivator!</p>

    <p>But she was clearly just a kid...</p>

    <p>The delinquents couldn't believe what they were seeing. Some of them thought about stopping the gold-chained person, but unfortunately he was in a rage from his failed attempts — each time, he would only just miss grabbing her!</p>

    <p>I catch!</p>

    <p>I catch!</p>

    <p>I still catch!</p>

    <p>I catch and catch...!</p>

    <p>However, Sheep dodged every attack.</p>

    <p>Five minutes later, the gold-chained delinquent was already too tired to go on, and he bent forward gasping for breath, hands on his knees.</p>

    <p>Large drops of sweat rolled down his forehead to drip onto the ground. He stared at Sheep and wiped at his sweat, completely giving up. "You... you... just go... consider yourself lucky..."</p>

    <p>Sheep raised an eyebrow and snorted. She then walked out from amidst this bunch of delinquents unscathed. Before leaving, she tilted her head and cast a sidelong glance at the gold-chained delinquent. "You couldn't last just five minutes, your stamina sucks!"</p>

    <p>With that, she walked toward Wang Ling without a backward glance.</p>

    <p>Standing at the mouth of the alley, Wang Ling could hear from a distance the sound of the gold-chained delinquent's heart breaking...</p>
