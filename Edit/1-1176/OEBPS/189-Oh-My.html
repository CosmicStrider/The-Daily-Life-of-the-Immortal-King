  <h1>Chapter 189 Oh My... </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Standing in front of the convenience mart with a delivery bag, Wang Ling saw a woman inside lift up the roller shutter; almost instantly, black smoke rapidly poured out from the opening created.</p>

    <p>In the past two days, Devil Emperor Gua Pi had already used the same method on thirty-two people, and he had become increasingly practiced at it. A short distance away, Immortal Toya was stupefied by this scene; the black smoke was so fast that even he couldn't follow its movements with his Heavenly Eye open.</p>

    <p>"Senior, watch out!"</p>

    <p>Bzz!</p>

    <p>In the next instant, a large cloud of black smoke enveloped Wang Ling, directly obscuring him from view.</p>

    <p>Devil Emperor Gua Pi was very excited; he could sense that this was fresh, young flesh, full of vigor.</p>

    <p>"It smells so good!"</p>

    <p>He couldn't help exclaiming in admiration; the aroma which this body exuded was as addictive as drugs.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling watched this scene indifferently. Surrounded by the black smoke, he couldn't see anything around him in the dark, and only heard an old voice murmuring to itself.</p>

    <p>Then, he saw a mask suddenly appear in the black smoke.</p>

    <p>The stone ghost mask?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling narrowed his eyes to confirm what he was seeing.</p>

    <p>But... why would it show up here?</p>

    <p>In the dark, Devil Emperor Gua Pi couldn't help sneering. After all, this was just a junior. Did the boy already wet his pants the moment he had attacked? He was just standing there like wood, afraid to make even a single move!</p>

    <p>"Junior, your body is mine..." Finally, the stone ghost mask covered Wang Ling's face precisely and the hooks that resembled crab claws along its sides stabbed ruthlessly at his cheeks.</p>

    <p>However, completely out of Devil Emperor Gua Pi's expectations, that familiar sense of puncturing something never came... the hooks on the sides of the mask had actually been blocked!</p>

    <p>From the moment he had begun manipulating the stone ghost mask, such a thing had never happened before! This mask was made of primordial black crystal, currently the hardest substance known so far in the universe!</p>

    <p>What was going on?</p>

    <p>A trace of doubt subconsciously flickered through Devil Emperor Gua Pi's mind.</p>

    <p>It was at this moment that the young man's body suddenly glowed with golden light which pulsed through the black smoke. With a burst of invisible power, it directly dispelled the black smoke around him!</p>

    <p>"Golden Body?!"</p>

    <p>Devil Emperor Gua Pi finally understood why the hooks hadn't been able to puncture the face!</p>

    <p>Fuck! This guy was actually a master with a Sage Body?! Nowadays even someone with a Sage Body would come running to deliver takeout?!</p>

    <p>After the black smoke was dispelled by the golden light, the stone ghost mask had nowhere to hide. Devil Emperor Gua Pi's phantom voice sounded in the air. "Your Excellency, who on earth are you...?"</p>

    <p>At that moment, even if Wang Ling didn't say anything, Devil Emperor Gua Pi was well aware that this person definitely wasn't that "Steamed Bun Invader" whom Jiang Liuyue had spoken of; that was just a killer at the Soul Formation stage who was ranked eighth on the ranking list. A Sage Body, on the other hand, wasn't something that was easy to cultivate.</p>

    <p>This was the ultimate body that countless cultivators had pursued for millions of years; it was impossible to count how many people longed to achieve this level.</p>

    <p>This was the ultimate shield! Sage Bodies wouldn't break and couldn't be affected by any techniques.</p>

    <p>Devil Emperor Gua Pi suddenly felt like Jiang Liuyue had deceived him... even he himself had never reached the level of a Sage Body!</p>

    <p>He already knew that given the other party's Sage Body, there was no way he could be this person's rival if he had to rely purely on his current condition and whatever attacks he could carry out.</p>

    <p>Now that it had come to this, there was only one final option!</p>

    <p>Swiftly manipulating a cloud of black smoke, he dashed back to Jiang Liuyue. They had already established a contract; once they encountered a crisis, she would willingly give her body over to him at any time.</p>

    <p>So before long, Wang Ling saw the stone ghost mask and Jiang Liuyue fuse together.</p>

    <p>Borrowing Jiang Liuyue's body, Devil Emperor Gua Pi stood up from the ground once more. Wisps of black smoke seeped out of his eyes, like a corpse that had been resurrected from an ancient coffin.</p>

    <p>"I never thought that after being sealed away for such a long time, I would be able to meet a master with a Sage Body..." Inside Jiang Liuyue's body, Devil Emperor Gua Pi narrowed his eyes.</p>

    <p>He stretched out his right arm and shouted, "Blade, come!"</p>

    <p>The air suddenly vibrated with a humming sound as a crack appeared in it. Then, a black dagger emerged from the crack and dropped into Devil Emperor Gua Pi's hand.</p>

    <p>Back then, the entire Huaxiu nation had been intimidated by this old devil's powerful ability; he was actually able to hide his magic blade in a space only he could open, and he could summon it at will.</p>

    <p>This technique was already far beyond the Soul Formation stage.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling gazed at this black dagger; an odd pattern was etched onto the silver blade and its edge was clean and bright as snow, reflecting Devil Emperor Gua Pi's evil eyes.</p>

    <p>When Devil Emperor Gua Pi opened his hand, this black dagger hovered directly in the air. He looked at Wang Ling and coldly said just one word: "Chop!"</p>

    <p>In the blink of an eye, the black dagger vanished as it transformed into a black-colored sword shadow.</p>

    <p>Flickering like static electricity, this sword shadow chopped savagely down at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>At the same time, a ray of light in Wang Ling's pocket swiftly responded!</p>

    <p>A brown-colored sword light burst forth to meet the light from that black dagger head on.</p>

    <p>Devil Emperor Gua Pi sneered. "It's no use. My blade is an ancient magic weapon which I acquired from an old tomb. It's a top-class holy weapon! Its biggest advantage is that it can destroy a Golden Body by attacking the acupuncture points. Currently, I can count the number of swords that can contend against it on one hand."</p>

    <p>However, just as he finished speaking, the two sword lights collided. Light and shadow were tangled together until the brown sword light gradually engulfed the black light.</p>

    <p>A moment later, it transformed into a strong current which smashed into Devil Emperor Gua Pi!</p>

    <p>This backlash was immensely powerful; Devil Emperor Gua Pi stretched out his hands and gripped tightly onto this ball of brown light while his body shook violently with the impact. It took all of his strength to finally tear apart this powerful surge created by the backlash from Jingke.</p>

    <p>However, it had left him drenched in sweat; he had practically almost died...</p>

    <p>As the brown sword light returned to Wang Ling's hand, Devil Emperor Gua Pi stared disbelievingly at him â€” what the hell! It was a peach wood sword!</p>

    <p>What kind of joke was this?!</p>

    <p>"Today, one of us will die!" he roared furiously.</p>

    <p>Calling back his black dagger, he advanced on Wang Ling himself.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's expression was calm; he didn't take the least bit notice of the other party's angry yell. He just stood there as he watched every move his opponent made, which in his eyes appeared extremely slow.</p>

    <p>He could even see all kinds of minute changes in this raging devil emperor's expression as he launched himself forward threateningly, blade in hand.</p>

    <p>Ten meters...</p>

    <p>Eight meters...</p>

    <p>Six meters...</p>

    <p>Devil Emperor Gua Pi brandished his ancient magic blade aggressively.</p>

    <p>Then, when he was just four meters away from Wang Ling, that body with its fiercely rocking boobs of mass destruction finally completely lost its balance.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling suddenly noticed a hint of embarrassment flicker across Devil Emperor Gua Pi's face.</p>

    <p>Then, with an abrupt "Oh my~," this ancient devil fell to the ground with a plop.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
