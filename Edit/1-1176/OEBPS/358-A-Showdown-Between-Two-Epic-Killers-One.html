  <h1>Chapter 358 A Showdown Between Two Epic Killers One </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Seeing Lao Gudong press the button for a full score, the little brother courier nodded in satisfaction. It really wasn't easy being a courier nowadays. Except for the money he earned based on the number of deliveries he made, his monthly and year-end bonuses were determined by his customer ratings, so a full-score rating was very important.</p>

    <p>Whether it was a courier little brother or food delivery little brother, both had one thing in common, and that was if they were a little late, their customers might give them a bad rating. Lao Gudong suddenly felt that these people would do anything for the sake of good ratings.</p>

    <p>Everyone should be understanding of each other in society nowadays.</p>

    <p>In some online news on social issues, there were reports of couriers or food deliverymen being personally attacked for being a little late - this was very poor behavior. Every single individual was a person with parents who had raised them; whose heart wouldn't ache when they saw their children being beaten and scolded?</p>

    <p>After accepting the package, Lao Gudong saw the courier little brother put the diving gear back on. "How are you going to get out?"</p>

    <p>The courier little brother smiled. "The same way I got in. It's so heavily guarded outside, so this was the only way to get in. Luckily, I learned the bone-shortening technique from a senior called Men Youping <sup>1</sup> when I was younger, otherwise I definitely wouldn't have been able to deliver this urgent item to you in time."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The nickname given to the character Zhang Qilin in the novel series 'Tomb Robbers,' and which translates to 'sealed oil bottle.')</dfn>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong was still in a daze after hearing "Men Youping" these words.</p>

    <p>Half of the courier little brother's torso was already inside the squat toilet when he said, "That, Mr Wang, can I please trouble you to help me press the flush button?"</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong: "..."</p>

    <p>Then, with the sound of flushing water, this courier little brother in professional diving gear disappeared down the squat toilet...</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong waited for him to leave before he opened the delivery box. It looked very big, but in fact it only contained a very small glass bottle inside. The glass bottle was wrapped in a layer of foam and rested in the middle of the box, still sealed.</p>

    <p>Pushing the foam aside, Lao Gudong took out the glass bottle and checked it repeatedly for damage before he was reassured - who knew what could have happened before this box had arrived. If the bottle had been damaged in transit, the medicinal property of the elixir inside would leak through even the smallest crack, severely reducing the efficacy of the elixir.</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong had bought this elixir online; it would play an important role in the upcoming battle.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, Wang Ling stood alone on the hospital rooftop as he gazed calmly at his surroundings.</p>

    <p>Director Li had already left to do his own thing. His task had just been to bring Wang Ling up to the rooftop; he actually couldn't be of much help beyond that. After all, they would be facing one of the very few epic-level killers in the world of assassins. Director Li was at the Golden Core stage; even if he had ten lives, they wouldn't be enough.</p>

    <p>Naturally, Wang Ling wasn't being idle; the whole time he had been on the rooftop, he had been preparing for the possibility of battle.</p>

    <p>According to Killer Taoist's intelligence, Taoist Taotie's current realm was probably Itinerant Immortal or even True Immortal level. Wang Ling didn't know if Lao Gudong had made any progress in his cultivation while he had been teaching all these years. In theory, however, he should be an Itinerant Immortal.</p>

    <p>Which meant that at the very least, this epic-level clash of killers would be between two Itinerant Immortal cultivators...</p>

    <p>Without proper preparation, a battle between two Itinerant Immortal cultivators could directly destroy Songhai city, without even <em>chaiqian </em>funds <sup>2</sup>as compensation.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>('Chaiqian' translates to "demolition and relocation," and refers to the large-scale rebuilding of older urban areas in China. This has become a significant socioeconomic issue, with some people being forcibly evicted.)</dfn>

    <p>And if it was a battle between two True Immortal cultivators, the destruction would at the very least be on a national level.</p>

    <p>As for tearing the earth apart... Wang Ling felt that given where the Spirit Energy Information era was currently at, except for when his strength wasn't being suppressed by the Dao talisman seal, no one else was capable of doing such a thing.</p>

    <p>In each corner of the rooftop, Wang Ling put down a rune. These four runes were linked; as long as someone set foot here, the runes would automatically form a boundary which would permit people to enter but not leave.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had already destroyed the invisible magic array which Taoist Taotie had set up earlier. As the array maker, Taoist Taotie would surely come to check whether it was working properly.</p>

    <p>When that time came, the fish would have taken the bait.</p>

    <p>The boundary formed by this four-corner array would create a completely independent space on the hospital rooftop; no matter how fiercely these two individuals fought, as long as the boundary held steady, the fluctuations created by Itinerant Immortals wouldn't get out.</p>

    <p>That way, at least, innocent bystanders wouldn't be involved.</p>

    <p>Now, all he had to do was wait for the main protagonist to show up...</p>

    <p>Actually, Wang Ling wasn't very good at being a mediator... After all, from the moment he had been born to when he had crushed that precious sword when he had been a year old, what he had been best at was "demolition"!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed in his heart and casted the aura concealment spell; like a chameleon, his entire being transformed and seemed to become one with the air.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Roughly ten minutes later, as Wang Ling had anticipated, Lao Gudong pushed open the rooftop door as he lugged his fat body up here.</p>

    <p>At the same time, a black figure wearing a face mask also dropped from the sky. The two fellow brothers who had not seen each other hundreds of years appeared at the same time and in the same place, as if they had arranged to do so.</p>

    <p>They faced each other and didn't speak. Neither of them noticed Wang Ling's existence, and were even more unaware of the boundary that he had secretly set up.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't want his identity exposed in front of Lao Gudong. No matter who he had been before, Lao Gudong was now still Wang Ling's history teacher, and Wang Ling didn't want their teacher-and-student relationship to break down because of this. Otherwise, Lao Gudong would have to call him Perfected Being Ling, which would make him very uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>Tens of seconds later, tremendous spirit waves unexpectedly surged up behind these two.</p>

    <p>This was the spillover of excess spirit power from the release of spiritual pressure, and the latter, which was originally invisible, transformed to take on a visible form, manifesting as raging waves.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling frowned; from that instant when the spirit power had exploded, he could tell that these two people's strength was beyond his estimation - they were actually even stronger than he had imagined!</p>

    <p>The spirit power was so dense that the spillover didn't just change form, it also distorted the surrounding space.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling observed everything from his secret hiding spot.</p>

    <p><em>Boom!</em></p>

    <p>At that moment, the spirit waves on both sides abruptly rolled forward and clashed together in a loud explosion.</p>

    <p>Neither of them was injured, though, as they both took a slight step back.</p>

    <p>Under the face mask, Taoist Taotie sneered. "Senior brother... Your appearance has changed, but it seems that your cultivation is stronger than before you left the assassination circle. What? Are you planning to make a comeback?"</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong smiled slightly and waved his hand. "There's no way I'll be returning in my lifetime... It's better to be a teacher! It's not worth living all my days in fear."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, the corners of Taoist Taotie's mouth couldn't help twitching. "Junior has already seen how senior brother has gone into hiding... you're actually hiding as a teacher in a school? You're better at evasion than JiaYueting <sup>3</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(Jia Yueting is a Chinese businessman who was blacklisted in China in late 2017 for unpaid debts. He subsequently refused to return to China and settled in California ..)</dfn>

    <p>Lao Gudong: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
