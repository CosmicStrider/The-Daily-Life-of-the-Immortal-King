  <h1>Chapter 467 Mo Immortal Castle Has Found a Patron! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>This black umbrella's origin was very unusual as it could actually form a barrier itself. It was the first time that the Lady had seen a magic weapon with this kind of attribute. In a normal situation, a barrier required the use of a magic array and many people working together to set it up. For example, during the previous Shuigou Sect incident when Xiao Yuncheng of the Xiao clan had run wild, police from all over had joined forces to mobilize fully tens of thousands of police officers to set up a barrier around the area that Xiao Yuncheng had been in.</p>

    <p>Of course, there were Almightys that could set up barriers on their own, but drawing the runes and doing the incantations took time.</p>

    <p>But President Bai's small black umbrella could set up a barrier instantly... This made the Lady sweat. She could more or less guess that the black umbrella was an extremely powerful spatial magic weapon.</p>

    <p>No wonder the police had been unable to find President Bai. The small black umbrella in his hand was a really effective escape tool.</p>

    <p>The Lady held the Wind of Regret sword in her hand as she stood within the barrier. The barrier space was so large that it seemed like a small world. This was a space with dark hues, and the aura of primal chaos lingered over everything, which indicated that this small umbrella's origin wasn't simple.</p>

    <p>"Mr Lu, excuse my impertinence..." the Lady said as she directly began to gather spirit energy with the Wind of Regret sword.</p>

    <p>She wasn't the sword's owner, but through the power of the contract, the Lord had directly given her authorization so that she could control it.</p>

    <p>The moment spirit energy poured into the Wind of Regret sword, the tip of the sword instantly started to shake as a whirlwind of power enveloped the sword body and a gale was stirred up in the windless space.</p>

    <p>On the side, President Bai gazed calmly at this scene with some regret.</p>

    <p>The Wind of Regret sword and the Cloud Movement sword were well-known twin swords on the ranking list of spirit swords; individually, each sword was ranked in the top thirty, but if they were combined together smoothly, the new sword "Wind of Regret and Cloud Movement" would directly be ranked in the top three.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, the Cloud Movement sword was already broken and only its hilt remained; experts had already appraised it and concluded that it was impossible to repair it.</p>

    <p>"Here I come!"</p>

    <p>After amassing power, the Lady slashed out in front of her. The force of the blade turned into a crescent that kicked up a tearing wind in its wake as it lashed out with immense energy!</p>

    <p>However, Mr Lu remained unmoved from beginning to end as he faced this gale with a very calm expression.</p>

    <p>As he had said himself, he didn't use any magical barriers and maintained a relaxed state since he had decided to receive this attack head-on purely with his physical body.</p>

    <p>As the blade struck him, Mr Lu's head was split open and fresh green blood spilled out of the wound. At the same time, the Wind of Regret sword's wind damage special effect was activated as it created a few air spirals invisible to the naked eye which inflicted continuous damage on the wound.</p>

    <p>This scene was terrifying enough to make a person panic.</p>

    <p>After that strike, the Lady put the sword away and at the same time couldn't help shivering â€” it was painful just looking at Mr Lu!</p>

    <p>But from beginning to end, he never uttered a cry. Roughly two seconds after he received the injury, a green spirit light bubbled out of the wound.</p>

    <p>The Lady was amazed when she realized that the wind damage special effect had disappeared, as if it had been purified by the green spirit light. At the same time, Mr Lu's wound was healing at a rate visible to the naked eye until he was whole again.</p>

    <p>"This is my Spell of Creation and Rebirth... "</p>

    <p>At the end of the demonstration, Mr Lu laughed. He was absolutely confident in his Spell of Creation and Rebirth. "I believe that the Lady can tell what my real identity is, but if the Lady assumes I'm just a common tree demon, that would be a big mistake."</p>

    <p>The Lady cupped her fists in salute. "Mr Lu, please instruct me."</p>

    <p>"I am indeed a tree demon, but there are also many types of tree demon clans. Although some tree demons major in offensive wood spells, the vast majority of them cultivate binding and restrictions spells, which can control the outcome of a battle. My race is even more uncommon as we have an innately strong self-healing ability and all kinds of healing wood spells." Mr Lu laughed. "My own race also has a resounding nickname; we are known as the forestfairies <sup>1</sup> ."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(For convoluted reasons explained in chapter 43, this is another reference to the gay porn actor Billy Herrington ..)</dfn>

    <p>The Lady wore an enlightened expression. Even though she didn't quite understand it, she did feel intimidated and felt that this Mr Lu wasn't ordinary.</p>

    <p>President Bai withdrew the black umbrella's barrier and it floated above his head once again. "Well, Lady? Can we continue with our discussion?"</p>

    <p>The Lady nodded and smiled. "Of course!"</p>

    <p>Mr Lu looked at his cell phone and said, "I have already instructed for fifty thousand immortal gold bars to be transferred into the account you gave us, please remember to check. Then, as per our agreement, I'll go and meet this person the Lady is talking about on behalf of President Bai. But before that, please give us the information we want, Lady."</p>

    <p>At this point, both sides had already expressed good faith with each other, and the Lady naturally demonstrated her generosity. She waved her hand and a jade scroll appeared in it; this was the intelligence which Mo Immortal Castle had obtained through their investigations.</p>

    <p>She presented the jade scroll with both hands. Mr Lu directly extended a vine to pluck it from her hand and said teasingly, "It's said that Mo Immortal Castle's intelligence is one hundred percent accurate; I wonder if this is true or not."</p>

    <p>The Lady responded with a very professional smile. "If our information wasn't one hundred percent accurate, why would President Bai and Mr Lu come find us?"</p>

    <p>"Mr Lu is only joking, don't mind him."</p>

    <p>President Bai waved his hand. "Several elders in our Demon Hunters Association have been secretly looking for that green-furred dog for a long time, but they haven't been able to find it. The Lady's information will be of great help. As for the person you mentioned, I will certainly get rid of him. I, Bai Zhe, never talk big... I just hope that after the success of this cooperation, the Demon Hunters Association and Mo Immortal Castle can work together more closely."</p>

    <p>The Lady understood.</p>

    <p>As an old veteran who had come into contact with a lot of big shots, the Lady of the Castle had a lot of profound experience, and she instantly understood what President Bai was saying: she knew that the Demon Hunters Association was offering their formidable power base in exchange for Mo Immortal Castle's information resources. Bluntly speaking, it would become Mo Immortal Castle's patron and muscleman.</p>

    <p>This truly was the moment when Mo Immortal Castle either lived or died...</p>

    <p>The Lady was of course very happy as she nodded repeatedly. "Of course! May Mo Immortal Castle and the Demon Hunters Association enjoy a pleasant collaboration!"</p>

    <p>"Mm, that's good."</p>

    <p>President Bai nodded and then motioned for Mr Lu to open the information scroll. "Come, take a look at the intelligence. See where that green-furred dog is."</p>

    <p>As Mr Lu read the scroll, the Lady explained, "Based on the coordinates President Bai gave us for where Elder Canglan and Elder Han disappeared, we were able to use some detection methods to finally find residual traces of the two of them at the construction site, and we deduce that the green-furred dog probably used something very similar to corpse powder."</p>

    <p>"Corpse powder that can dissolve the bodies of Soul Formation cultivators?" Mr Lu was a little startled.</p>

    <p>"Mm." The Lady nodded. "When we first discovered it, we also found it hard to believe; corpse powder that can instantly dissolve the bodies of Soul Formation cultivators actually exists... But it was the unique scent of this very corpse powder that finally led us to the green-furred dog."</p>

    <p>Listening to everything the Lady said, President Bai and Mr Lu continued reading the information in the scroll.</p>

    <p>At the bottom was a map.</p>

    <p>Marked on it was the very location of Lord Diulei's villa...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, Lord Diulei and Xiao Yin were eating fried broccoli at the villa.</p>

    <p>At the table, Lord Diulei stared at the bowl of broccoli with shining eyes.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin picked up a broccoli and looked at it. He had heard Lord Diulei say that this broccoli was a hint from Great Senior Wang for comprehending the Heavenly Dao... But he had already been eating it for almost a week and hadn't discovered anything profound in it.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was suspicious. "Is this really useful for comprehending the Heavenly Dao?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was absolutely certain. "Of course! If you and I eat it for a few years, we'll definitely comprehend it!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "Hm... all right!"</p>

    <p>A spirit light flashed in Lord Diulei's hand and he gave Xiao Yin a bib. "Wear it. It won't be good if your saliva drips down when you eat. I had Brother Ling enchant this bib so that it's strongly resistant to corrosion. Your saliva is too scary, it can even dissolve Soul Formation cultivators..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin couldn't help roaring. "That was phlegm! Phlegm!"</p>
