  <h1>Chapter 445 Jingke's Ultimate Move </h1>

  <div>

    <p>High up in the air, Jingke hovered inside Lord Diulei's body at a height of ten thousand meters, enveloped in a brown sword light from head to toe.</p>

    <p>Tremendous pressure fell from the sky, instantly imprisoning Evil Sword God and preventing him from casting any spells!</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God was extremely shocked. He hadn't expected this Sword Falling From the Sky to actually be able to seal his spirit at the same time.</p>

    <p>As Jingke dove swiftly through the air toward the ground, the pressure on Evil Sword God also increased.</p>

    <p>After Jingke dropped from ten thousand to five thousand meters, not only was Evil Sword God unable to cast spells, he was unable to withstand the pressure, and his entire body was directly hammered into the ground, splayed out like a toad.</p>

    <p>His head, four limbs and torso - every part of his body was firmly pressed down. Evil Sword God couldn't remember when was the last time he had kissed the ground like this...</p>

    <p>The ground began to crack with him at the center.</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God couldn't breathe as his entire body sank deep into the earth like he was stuck in a swamp and was sinking down bit by bit.</p>

    <p>...Was he actually going to lose?</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God was completely unable to move. If it hadn't been for the Heaven-Cleaving sword's sword spirit protecting him, his end might have been an even more wretched one.</p>

    <p>What kind of pressure was this?</p>

    <p>It was an overwhelming sense of oppression that even True Immortals found hard to bear...</p>

    <p>The sword spirit of the Heaven-Cleaving sword was also pressed to the ground like a toad. A master and a servant in the same pose looked very funny.</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God couldn't speak and could only communicate telepathically. He was so nervous that even his chuuni tone disappeared. "Heaven-Cleaving! What on earth is this sword spirit..."</p>

    <p>The skeleton sword spirit: "I also don't know!"</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God: "..."</p>

    <p>As they were talking, the armor on the skeleton sword spirit that had initially been created through a gathering of the power of Sword Dao also started to fracture inch by inch under this devastating attack.</p>

    <p>Four thousand meters...</p>

    <p>Three thousand meters...</p>

    <p>Two thousand meters...</p>

    <p>The pressure continued to increase...</p>

    <p>By the time it was about a thousand meters from the ground, Evil Sword God and his sword spirit had already sunk several dozen meters into the earth.</p>

    <p>They were completely unable to move. Evil Sword God clenched his teeth and split the power of his Purple Investigative Demon Eye in order to share his sword spirit's sight through the sword spirit contract.</p>

    <p>At that moment, his Purple Investigative Demon Eye took a panoramic view of the sky.</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God felt that this was a scene he would never ever forget.</p>

    <p>Under the blue dome of heaven, that unknown sword spirit in the body of the young man in white demonstrated a Sword Falling From the Sky... at that moment, it transformed into a gigantic, dark gold sword of light which descended from the sky like a divine emperor, covering everything with destructive pressure!</p>

    <p>As this tremendous sword of light fell, the intrinsic spirit field space started to collapse around it.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling's intrinsic spirit field's ability to restore itself was really too strong. The destructive power of this tremendous sword of light was devastating, but the intrinsic spirit field's ability to restore itself was just about on par with it. Wang Ling could thus contain the sword of light's destructive power inside the intrinsic spirit field without affecting the real world.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, the power of this sword...</p>

    <p>Would wipe out the whole of Songhai city.</p>

    <p>Absolute suppression!</p>

    <p>Absolute seal on the spirit!</p>

    <p>It was impossible to resist...</p>

    <p>With the help of the Purple Investigative Demon Eye's ability to share sight, the skeleton sword spirit finally saw the sword's origin. While his face couldn't exhibit expressions, his sweat flowed uncontrollably as he communicated telepathically to Evil Sword God, "World-Annihilating Sword..."</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God looked like he had eaten divine shit. "World... World, World, World-Annihilating Sword?!"</p>

    <p>The skeleton sword spirit was full of despair. "Lord Sword, it's over for us... Don't play with echoes at a time like this..."</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God: "I was stuttering!"</p>

    <p>The skeleton sword spirit: "..."</p>

    <p>It was clear that both this master and servant never expected to actually provoke such an existence...</p>

    <p>World-Annihilating Sword...</p>

    <p>This didn't have to do with attributes, but was about the supreme profound truth of the Great Sword Dao Spell!</p>

    <p>Furthermore, the skeleton sword spirit could think of only one person in the world, apart from the creator of the Three Thousand Great Spells, who could use the Great Sword Dao Spell's power of Sword Dao at this level...</p>

    <p>Could it be...</p>

    <p>At this moment, the skeleton sword spirit "Heaven-Cleaving" broke out in a genuine cold sweat. "His Majesty..."</p>

    <p>He didn't even dare utter the name, because it was taboo for all sword spirits.</p>

    <p>The power of the World-Annihilating Sword was unstoppable... the Heaven-Cleaving sword spirit could sense its destruction getting closer and closer.</p>

    <p>In less than ten seconds, both he and Evil Sword God would be annihilated in this place.</p>

    <p>The power of the World-Annihilating Sword was a supreme profound truth strong enough to withstand world-defying magic weapons and divine weapons!</p>

    <p>Each of the Three Thousand Great Spells possessed a profound truth, but only a very few beings could use them. In a flash, thoughts flew through the Heaven-Cleaving sword spirit's mind.</p>

    <p>That was His Majesty!</p>

    <p>The embodiment of the Great Sword Dao Spell, the Lord of sword spirits... the Heaven-Cleaving sword spirit had completely never imagined that His Majesty would actually acknowledge a boy as his master.</p>

    <p>He remembered that overwhelming scene of dominance when the boy had sent Evil Sword God flying with two slaps...</p>

    <p>The Heaven-Cleaving sword spirit felt that he had miscalculated, and should have put a stop to this battle earlier on.</p>

    <p>But now he had no other options. As a sword spirit, his job was to guard his master... No matter how wicked his master was or what sort of sins he had committed, he had to observe the essence of the spirit sword contract.</p>

    <p>In the split second that the World-Annihilating Sword was about to hit, the Heaven-Cleaving sword spirit's skeleton body activated the "guardian spirit blade" condition in the spirit sword contract.</p>

    <p>The Heaven-Cleaving sword spirit was well aware that Evil Sword God would certainly perish under this sword attack, but if he sacrificed his life to protect his master, there was still a chance that his master might survive.</p>

    <p>They didn't have much time left at present. At this critical moment, the Heaven-Cleaving sword spirit didn't hesitate at all.</p>

    <p>It was just trading one life for another. As a sword spirit, Heaven-Cleaving was abiding by the contract. He didn't think he was doing anything wrong.</p>

    <p>Because of the spirit sword contract, the moment the Heaven-Cleaving sword made his decision, Evil Sword God already knew what he was planning to do.</p>

    <p>"Heaven-Cleaving..."</p>

    <p>Although he had seized this sword from his <em>shifu </em>, they had in the end been together for a hundred years, so feelings had long developed between them.</p>

    <p>The second before the "World-Annihilating Sword" hit, Evil Sword God's thick eye shadow and the sinister pattern of lines that stretched from his nape to down his back faded...</p>

    <p>Master and servant closed their eyes to receive the punishment from the World-Annihilating Sword.</p>

    <p>However, the expected pain didn't come.</p>

    <p>When the tremendous sword of light landed, it did so without sound or even any explosive effects.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling closed <em>On Talismans </em>and stood up from the ground. He patted the dust off his clothes. A strong wind brushed over his black-and-white short-sleeved shirt, exposing his bright and clean collarbone.</p>

    <p>The effects of the World-Annihilating Sword could be subdivided into various types. One was world-annihilating punishment, which was a great killer move that could truly destroy everything. Another was world-annihilating purification, which could strip away the power of Sword Dao...</p>

    <p>Because of the sword spirit's loyalty to its master, Wang Ling had ultimately decided to be lenient; he felt that stripping Evil Sword God of the power of Sword Dao that he was so proud of was already the best punishment for him.</p>

    <p>And Jingke abided by Wang Ling's will...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Later, when Lord Diulei recovered, he found himself at the edge of a deep pit in the center of the intrinsic spirit field.</p>

    <p>Taking a look, he saw the master and sword duo of Evil Sword God and the Heaven-Cleaving sword spirit folded over each other inside.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Yooooo..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei looked at Wang Ling behind him and said, "Brother Ling, what should we do now?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>What else could they do?</p>

    <p>Call Zhuo Yi...</p>
