  <h1>Chapter 368 An Insect Peddler </h1>

  <div>

    <p>This scene left many people stunned. His aim was precise during regular target archery, but he turned into a body outline-tracing master when it came to rapid fire shots... what kind of operation was this?</p>

    <p>Ultimately, it was because Jiang Bai's father had cast too big a shadow over his childhood when he had made Jiang Bai practice his kitchen knife flying skills on living targets back then... it was probably enough to drive anyone insane.</p>

    <p>The targets whom Jiang Bai had practiced on were all genuine cultivators; there was no way they would have been killed by a child's flying kitchen knife.</p>

    <p>But the crucial problem was that Jiang Bai hadn't known that they were cultivators... After all, not everyone could automatically learn and accept all types of information from birth like Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Most kids had no understanding of the concept of cultivators at a young age, but they were very much aware that one could get hurt and bleed from being hit by a kitchen knife. Jiang Bai's father Jiang Haifu had duped him into practicing flying kitchen knives from a young age, and in order to not accidentally injure anyone, that was when his amazing talent had emerged.</p>

    <p>But his dad could never have expected that his training would have turned his son into a body outline-tracing master.</p>

    <p>"As expected, he's still not good at rapid fire shots." Teacher Ye let out a painful sigh.</p>

    <p>Indeed, rapid fire shooting was more nerve-wracking than single shots, and it was easier to get drawn into an unstable mood... the most important thing was to adjust Jiang Bai's mental state for rapid fire archery. Most unfortunately, Jiang Bai's childhood shadow had taken a much heavier toll on him than Teacher Ye had imagined.</p>

    <p>Things couldn't continue like this - Number 59 High School and Reliance High School also had archery experts participating in the competition this time. Jiang Bai's biggest advantages were his accuracy and stability in stationary target archery. But it was obviously unrealistic to think that Number 60 High School could win by relying on just the scores obtained from the stationary target archery event. In the end, the results of the overall archery competition would be based on the average of the scores obtained in all the events.</p>

    <p>If you scored a zero in the rapid fire archery event, it didn't matter how high your scores were in the other events.</p>

    <p>Jiang Bai actually understood this very well, but in actual practice, it was still very hard and challenging for him.</p>

    <p>So many people watching made him especially nervous; standing in the rowdy crowd, Wang Ling could hear Jiang Bai's rapid breathing, and his hand even trembled slightly around the bow.</p>

    <p>This already wasn't just nerves; it was signs of a lack of confidence.</p>

    <p>Seeing this, Teacher Ye hurried over to comfort him with a few words before he simply stepped forward and placed the apple on his head. "Come on! Shoot me!"</p>

    <p>Jiang Bai was shocked. "..."</p>

    <p>The atmosphere around them froze at these words... why did they sound a little strange?</p>

    <p>What the hell?! Was Teacher Ye being dirty?!</p>

    <p>Teacher Ye quickly cleared his throat and said, "I meant, shoot the apple on my head..."</p>

    <p>He knew what he had said was ambiguous and could be easily misunderstood.</p>

    <p>"I'm at the Golden Core stage and I've practiced the Golden Bell Shield and Iron Skin, so there's no way these spirit arrows can hurt me. So, Student Jiang Bai, please believe in yourself and take it easy." Teacher Ye earnestly patted Jiang Bai's shoulder.</p>

    <p>Given Jiang Bai's current realm, it was true that there was very little harm he could cause Teacher Ye with his spirit arrows; if an arrow touched his skin, it would just be like a mosquito bite.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling knew that there was still a risk.</p>

    <p>Protection of the body at the Golden Core stage wasn't perfect; there were still some areas that were unprotected, like the eyes, which were a very vulnerable spot.</p>

    <p>After that, Teacher Ye took up position around fifty meters away from Jiang Bai.</p>

    <p>Jiang Bai drew in a deep breath; he took six spirit arrows from his quiver, then slowly drew them with the bow.</p>

    <p>Teacher Ye stood at a distance with the apple on his head. "Don't be nervous! These spirit arrows can't hit me at all! Just treat it like stationary target archery!"</p>

    <p>Jiang Bai's breathing started to pick up, and he even seemed a little dazed when he let the spirit arrows go one after another.</p>

    <p>When he came back to his senses, six spirit arrows had already split the air, and in that moment, Wang Ling could already see their trajectory.</p>

    <p>As expected... they would all perfectly miss Teacher Ye and the apple on his head.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Jiang Bai had also already anticipated the same thing when he'd let the arrows fly, and he lowered his head in disappointment. "I knew it, I can't do it..."</p>

    <p>But outside of everyone's expectations, these six spirit arrows suddenly seemed to find a course, and they pierced the center of the apple one after another, leaving just a small hole the size of an index finger.</p>

    <p>What the hell?! They actually hit the target?</p>

    <p>The result this time made everyone's jaws drop; even Jiang Bai himself widened his eyes in bafflement. Some of the PE teachers who had been staring blankly then exclaimed in surprise, and the scene erupted in thunderous applause.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing had been watching everything quietly. The moment he saw Jiang Bai's six spirit arrows hit the target, he turned in almost the first instance to fix his eyes on Wang Ling, and he couldn't help laughing inwardly. His heart was clear as a mirror; although Wang Ling put on an aloof air, he hadn't been able to help lending a hand in the end.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling got home that night, he happened to see Er Ha at the front door eating the dog food specially supplied by Guo Hao's family,</p>

    <p>They still had a few bags of New Orleans fly-flavored dog food left. Mother Wang seemed to be in a particularly good mood today, and she had given Er Ha and extra large portion, which had plenty of fat, meaty flies mixed into it, so Er Ha was incredibly pleased.</p>

    <p>However, due to the strong smell of insects, it could only eat mournfully outside the front door.</p>

    <p>It was only later that Wang Ling found out that Mother Wang had bought these meaty flies from an insect peddler while she had been doing the grocery shopping.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, insect cooking was already no longer a rare phenomenon - many restaurants now even had their own insect menus; whatever you could think of, they made it.</p>

    <p>This type of insect cuisine was quite popular among cultivators. According to scientific research, cultivators consumed protein ten times faster than regular people, so to be able to replenish that protein with an insect meal was something to be happy about.</p>

    <p>When Er Ha thought about it, it had very rarely been able to eat such plump, succulent flies since leaving the demon world... that was just too damn sad!</p>

    <p>But insect peddlers couldn't be found just anywhere. Like the portable red banners<sup>1</sup> that would be brought out now and then in junior and senior high school, the peddlers would appear intermittently at different markets, and didn't have a fixed location at all. It was purely by luck that Mother Wang had been able to bump into one at the market.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This refers to the red brocade triangular flags generally used to mark special occasions or as gifts of appreciation ..)</dfn>

    <p>Seeing Er Ha happily gorge itself, Wang Ling didn't interrupt, and only just kicked it in the butt.</p>

    <p>Er Ha understood that this was Little Master Ling's silent code word for: Come to my room later. This refers to the red brocade triangular flags generally used to mark special occasions or as gifts of appreciation.</p>
