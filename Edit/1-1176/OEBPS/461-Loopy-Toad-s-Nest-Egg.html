  <h1>Chapter 461 Er Ha's Nest Egg </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Three kills...</p>

    <p>And yet another headshot with the katana!</p>

    <p>As said previously, the probability of a katana being dropped in the game was very limited. Even the probability of a game live streamer picking up a katana at all was extremely low, but in Daoist Guang's hand, it really made people realize how frightening the katana was! If you were hit in the head in a melee, you would be killed. Even if you wore a level three helmet, it was useless!</p>

    <p>This kind of injury really left people speechless.</p>

    <p>Moreover, after this third kill, there was actually no one left who doubted whether Daoist Guang could kill people with a katana - this was already the third person. Furthermore, many people had noticed that each time Daoist Guang had struck the opponent's head, he jumped slightly to ensure accuracy in that one moment when he raised his katana as he aimed at the head, killing his opponent in one swipe!</p>

    <p>These were all detailed micro-operations.</p>

    <p>For those water friends who had seen Daoist Guang's Z Shake body movement, there was little need to doubt Daoist Guang's ability to perform micro-operations.</p>

    <p>After Daoist Guang obtained his third kill, the other three players who had teamed up with this passerby player realized that there was something fishy about this situation.</p>

    <p>Then they saw the notification in the top right corner of the public screen:<em>Player "LORD ISLAND" used "Katana" to kill player "HaroRunDeKuai" with a headshot...</em></p>

    <p>The three people were instantly stunned.</p>

    <p>The fuck?! Dead?</p>

    <p><em>Using a katana for headshots... excuse me, what kind of operation was this!</em></p>

    <p>These three players were obviously newbies, and had never encountered such an amazing operation before, so they all instantly started to panic a little.</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang was in the mouth of the corridor, out of the other party's line of sight. He saw them load up on bullets, but they didn't do anything else.</p>

    <p>A moment later, one of the male characters who was wearing a miniskirt grit his teeth. "I'll go check; if I die, pick up the heal items on the ground! Take turns fighting the person inside; I'm guessing it's probably an expert!"</p>

    <p>Before this chivalrous little brother left, he threw all his heal items on the ground, including a Med Kit and some First Aid Kits...</p>

    <p>Seeing this, many water friends couldn't resist teasing him in the bullet messages.</p>

    <p>"Tch, ten passersby in the circle are moved..."</p>

    <p>"Damn! Isn't this big brother too chivalrous!"</p>

    <p>"I get a fuzzy feeling knowing that there are this kind of people in the world... Why does this First Aid Kit look so delicious somehow?!"</p>

    <p>"Ha ha ha! The message in front, wait a minute! Do you have cravings after watching <em>A Bite of China <sup>1</sup> </em>Season 3?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A Chinese documentary
television series on the
history of food, eating, and
cooking in China)</dfn>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang was also moved by this scene.</p>

    <p>Strangers could actually build this type of trust with each other in such a short time in an online game; games really were magical things!</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang sighed in his heart as he watched that little brother who had already given up all his heal items come charging in, already heroically facing death.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Daoist Guang was deeply moved...</p>

    <p>Then, he slashed this little brother.</p>

    <p>A notification appeared in the top right corner of the public screen: <em>Player "LORD ISLAND" used "Katana" to kill player "Clearseven" with a headshot...</em></p>

    <p>Four kills...</p>

    <p>The remaining two passersby were utterly stunned; they hadn't even heard their comrade fire off any shots in front of them! How come he died?</p>

    <p>They crouched outside the tower to talk it over.</p>

    <p>"What should we do now?"</p>

    <p>"It's fine, we have so many heal items now! Just do as the brother said, take turns going in; if you fall to Residual Blood, retreat! This person is holed up in the tower and won't come out to hunt us anyway!"</p>

    <p>The two players made a quick decision after some discussion.</p>

    <p>Ten seconds later...</p>

    <p>A message popped up on the public screen yet again: <em>Player "LORD ISLAND" used "Katana" to kill player "PDDnoJJi" with a headshot...</em></p>

    <p><em>Player "LORD ISLAND" used "Katana" to kill player "KuXuanzuiShuai" with a headshot...</em></p>

    <p>Six kills...</p>

    <p>The viewers: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>After a brief silence, the bullet messages in the live stream exploded again!</p>

    <p>"Holy crap! Six kills? With a headshot each time? Headshot cheat! Evidence!"</p>

    <p>"Lord Island is really precise with the katana, I'm totally convinced!"</p>

    <p>"I feel these four people can't play; if they had gone in together, this wouldn't have happened..."</p>

    <p>"It's a Fish Pond Round, what can you expect?"</p>

    <p>"I've decided; in the future, I'll use custom mode and train hard in the katana, and set up a katana school!"</p>

    <p>In that time, a lot of people on the screen sent gifts...</p>

    <p>But Daoist Guang wasn't in the mood to take a look at these things for the time being.</p>

    <p>The current situation wasn't bad. He had to strike while the iron was hot, or it would really be too late.</p>

    <p>At that point, there were only thirty-six people left in the game — he had to kill fourteen more!</p>

    <p>Little Brother GAYLIGAYQI picked up a bag happily after he saw that Lord Island had successfully killed four people. The four of them together were quite rich! There were more heal items than they could carry. The little brother restored his energy to full health, then switched to a brand new level three bulletproof vest to ensure his safety.</p>

    <p>"Lord Island, there's so many heal items here that I can't pick all of them up!" After a taste of the first wave, the little brother was in high spirits — luring people in and chopping them to death one by one was simply exhilarating!</p>

    <p>The little brother: "Where is everyone, Lord Island? Should I go out and lure in another wave?"</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang smiled. "You don't have to take risks; there are fewer people now, so you should protect yourself, otherwise you won't be able to win first place later. Scatter the extra resources randomly nearby so that they ultimately lead back to the tower."</p>

    <p>"OK!"</p>

    <p>After the first tacit collaboration, Little Brother completely understood.</p>

    <p>What Medical Kit... toss!!!</p>

    <p>What First Aid Kit... toss!!!</p>

    <p>What painkillers, energy drinks... toss!!!</p>

    <p>4x scope, 8x scope... toss!!!</p>

    <p>Among the four people that had been killed, one person had a very precious skirt, but the little brother didn't want it, and directly threw it on the ground...</p>

    <p>When the water friends in the live stream saw Little Brother GAYLIGAYQI randomly toss these supplies he had picked up earlier at the mouths of the alleys around the tower, they couldn't help the way their lips twitched. Bullet messages flooded the screen.</p>

    <p>"He... didn't even want the miniskirt? He also tossed the Med Kit?"</p>

    <p>"Damn! So rich? Casually throwing away so many things?"</p>

    <p>"Fuck! This is the One Piece <sup>2</sup> in the game!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(The ultimate treasure in the
pirate manga series of the
same name ..)</dfn>

    <p>"Lord Island, Lord Island... Your little brother is littering!"</p>

    <p>"It doesn't matter." Daoist Guang found the time to look at the bullet messages at this moment. "We're in a good circle. When these people come into the city, they'll definitely want to occupy a high vantage point, so they'll come to my tower. I'll use these supplies to lure them in. If they pick them up, they'll reach the tower, and sooner or later they'll have to spit them all out again."</p>

    <p>Hearing Daoist Guang's answer, a lot of people couldn't help the way their lips twitched.</p>

    <p>They realized that as a game live streamer...</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang was really very playful!</p>

    <p>Just then, Wang Ling, who had been watching the live stream the whole time, suddenly noticed a gift message float across the screen: <em>[Level 1 Light Chaser: Immortal Two] gave Lord Island [One Immortal Boat] gift and has risen to [Level 3 Light Chaser].</em></p>
    
    <p>Immortal Two?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was stupefied. "..."</p>

    <p>He looked out the window; sure enough, he saw Er Ha in the garden watching the live stream!</p>

    <p>The issue was... when had this guy become so rich?</p>
