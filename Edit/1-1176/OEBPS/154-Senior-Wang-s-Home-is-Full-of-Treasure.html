  <h1>Chapter 154 Senior Wang's Home is Full of Treasure </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It had been nearly midnight when Song Qingshu had come to the Wang family for help.</p>

    <p>To be honest, Mo Immortal Castle had moved quicker than he had expected. He would have just reached the airport at this time, and might have been captured on the spot before he could fly... he was now a little glad for the choice that he had made. With Lord Diulei and this Senior White Rabbit who possessed an unfathomable realm, he would definitely be completely protected!</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu had given Wang Ling this nickname White Rabbit for the time being.</p>

    <p>At this point, the big ancient pendulum clock on the first floor of the Wang family's small villa struck twelve times; it was midnight exactly.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling approached the gate in just a pair of pajamas.</p>

    <p>The woman in the red cheongsam stopped shouting and sneered as she looked at Song Qingshu behind Wang Ling. "So you finally came out?"</p>

    <p>"Miss Ah You, you shouldn't have come..." Song Qingshu came out from behind Wang Ling. Maybe it was because of Wang Ling and Lord Diulei's presence, but his confidence had risen quite a bit.</p>

    <p>"You severely injured Ah Zuo and attempted to desert Mo Immortal Castle. This is already a capital offence," Ah You snarled.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the bones in her right hand popped and twisted together at a bizarre angle, like a bundle of tough beef tendons, and finally started spinning at a high speed like an electric drill!</p>

    <p>This woman had unexpectedly turned her right hand into a magic weapon.</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu was well aware in his heart that when it came to realms and overall quality, this Ah You could absolutely seckill <sup>1</sup> him. Their realms were not on the same level; crushing someone of a lower realm than you was as simple as killing a chicken or a dog. In a normal one-on-one situation, it was impossible to kill someone with a higher realm than you.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>('Seckill' or 'second kill' is a
literal translation of 秒杀,
which originated in online
gaming to refer to how a
strong player can kill his
opponent in seconds ..)</dfn>

    <p>But he wasn't the slightest bit nervous as he slowly moved into position and stretched out a hand in a beckoning gesture. "Come on then."</p>

    <p>Compared with that Ah Zuo, the attack by this Miss Ah You was obviously more violent. Her right hand electric drill was like a supreme magic weapon that could crack open earth and sky. Bathed in a dazzling light, this Miss Ah You straightened her back and lunged forward like a mighty dragon crossing the river as she swiftly launched an attack.</p>

    <p>From Ah Zuo's fingers to Ah You's entire right hand, even Lord Diulei had never heard of this method of turning a body part into a magic weapon. This Ah You's attack was clearly more aggressive than Ah Zuo's; when she was still airborne, she thrust the lightning whirl of her right hand forward.</p>

    <p>In the face of this poisonous lightning dragon drill, Song Qingshu didn't use any gaudy tricks, and only crossed his arms in front of his body; he couldn't even see Ah You's attack trajectory.</p>

    <p>This was what the gap in realms looked liked; the woman's movements were too fast for him to follow at all with his eyes.</p>

    <p>In a flash, she collided with him, and the air around them surged up in a roar.</p>

    <p>The poisonous lightning dragon drill was extraordinary; it hit the precise point where Song Qingshu's arms were crossed, and its power was so tremendous that the ground collapsed little by little until Song Qingshu's entire body was pushed down into it like a rivet.</p>

    <p>However, when the woman had attacked, his arms had glowed with a golden light.</p>

    <p>Boom !</p>

    <p>That golden light exploded on the scene, and the woman's right hand was badly mangled as she was directly flung back, light as a scarecrow, to smash through a thick old tree behind her. She flew for several hundred meters more over the ground before she finally stopped.</p>

    <p>This scene was familiar... it was the backlash from this golden light before that had caused Ah Zuo to suffer heavy injuries.</p>

    <p>Conversely, except for a little ash on him, Song Qingshu wasn't hurt in the least.</p>

    <p>He climbed out of the pit, dusted himself off, and couldn't help turning to Wang Ling to give him a thumbs-up and a grateful look. "Senior! Your long underwear is really useful!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Ah You's cheongsam had already been shredded. She slowly climbed up from the ground barefooted on shaky legs. Her entire right arm had turned to pulp, the flesh practically falling off the bone and bleeding profusely.</p>

    <p>The only reason she could still stand was because of her superior realm; an average cultivator in the same situation would have already long died from the unbearable pain.</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu swiftly approached the woman, covering a distance of several hundred meters in less than a few microseconds.</p>

    <p>Enduring the excruciating pain, Ah You looked at Song Qingshu. "With your realm, there's no way you can have such speed..."</p>

    <p>"I used a magic weapon." Song Qingshu pointed to the ground and flexed his big toes a little.</p>

    <p>Ah You was stunned when she realized that it was, unexpectedly, a pair of flip-flops...</p>

    <p>"I had come to ask Senior Wang for help, and we had a good chat at his house. I didn't expect you to suddenly come here, and I didn't even have time to change out of my house slippers," said Song Qingshu.</p>

    <p>This competent assistant of the Lady of the Castle, Ah You, stared disbelievingly at this scene. "...What kind of joke is this?"</p>

    <p>As he spoke, Song Qingshu pushed his outerwear aside to reveal a whole set of red long underwear. "Look... these long johns are also from senior's family. It's these two magic treasures that stopped your attack, otherwise I would have died already."</p>

    <p>Ah You refused to accept this result and directly spat out blood.</p>

    <p>Are you kidding me?!</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu said darkly, "Senior Wang is very generous and doesn't want to interfere. But you've been bothering this great person persistently... go back and tell the Lord that Senior Wang has already promised to protect me, and he should be careful — if he wants to live a few more years, it would be best if he didn't simply stir up trouble."</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling felt that after Zhuo Yi, he was being coerced again.</p>

    <p>"You actually dare to threaten the Lord? Let me tell you, I was already prepared before I came today... I'll kill you even if I can't go back!" The woman stared fiercely at Song Qingshu, but then her expression quickly changed into one of alarm. "Why... why can't I sense your soul brand?"</p>

    <p>"Want to kill me with a curse?" Song Qingshu laughed slightly. "Very regretfully, Senior Wang already helped me wash it clean with laundry detergent before you arrived."</p>

    <p>"Laundry detergent..." Ah You was dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>Reasonably speaking, the soul brand which the Lord of the Castle had marked Song Qingshui with had already reached the point where it could no longer be cleansed. What the hell kind of laundry detergent was this... could it really get rid of ninety-nine kinds of stains? Damn it!</p>

    <p>"Do you have any last words?" Song Qingshu asked.</p>

    <p>"You have no idea how much trouble you've stirred up! Ah Zuo and I work for the Lady, but we were also hired by her; we don't really belong to Mo Immortal Castle, but to Immortal Mansion! If you dare go up against them, they'll never let you go." The woman sneered as she stared at Song Qingshu. "Besides, even if I'm injured, as long as the other two people don't make a move, do you think a Nascent Soul person like you can kill me?"</p>

    <p>Immortal Mansion?</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Wang Ling and Lord Diulei's eyes narrowed slightly.</p>

    <p>"Is that all you wanted to say?"</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu completely dismissed her words. He had been hunted by Mo Immortal Castle and had been on edge for so long... now, he was delighting in their reversed situations.</p>

    <p>In his hand, he had a toothpick which he had taken from the Wang family's small villa.</p>

    <p>When he was done speaking, the toothpick flew out, propelled by spirit energy, and directly pierced the woman's forehead.</p>

    <p>The woman died resentful. The skull of a cultivator at Soul Formation stage was so tough that there was nothing in the world which they feared at all; the woman completely hadn't expected that in the end, she would die because of a toothpick.</p>

    <p>The spirit energy in the toothpick then exploded in the woman's brain, and this tiny toothpick directly blasted a bloody fist-sized hole in her forehead.</p>

    <p>Hands shaking, Song Qingshu stared at this hole in the head which he had caused. He couldn't calm down for a long time after that from how excited and carefree he felt.</p>
