  <h1>Chapter 1061 Wang Ling's Worries</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Bai Youquan tried to struggle, but discovered that he was powerless to free himself from Wang Ling's clutches. Actually, if this was an ordinary situation, Wang Ling could choose to forcefully search the other party's memories if they refused to answer the question. Unfortunately, he couldn't use this tactic with Bai Youquan.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling had already taken Bai Youquan's Fate Dao, it still belonged to the latter. Once Fate Dao was used, Bai Youquan's mind space would turn into chaos as the memories of the Bai Youquans from all the other parallel worlds would be jumbled up like paste, and difficult to tell apart.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was in no hurry to interrogate Bai Youquan; he still had Zhuo Yi, after all - it was only right that this sort of menial task was left to his disciple.</p>

    <p>After casting the Great Prohibition Spell on Bai Youquan, Wang Ling returned to his original body. Bai Youquan could currently be described as a locust without its shell, and utterly useless. The more terrifying thing, moreover, was that, as the head of the black soldier army, he would be put in the special cell to play nice with the mahjong trio.</p>

    <p>This would also be the first time that the mahjong room would have four people; they would no longer need to find people from the other prison cells to make up the number.</p>

    <p>Interrogating Bai Youquan would take some time, and couldn't be done hastily. But with Bai Youquan's prison invasion, Wang Ling had at least determined what the black soldier army organization's objective was - it was very clear that they were after his little sister, Wang Nuan. Zheng Tianqiang and Wu Yuanji might have been targeted because she had granted them special powers.</p>

    <p>Based on the Wang family's genes... Wang Ling believed Wang Nuan probably had a special type of Great Dao ability, on par with Heavenly Dao, Divine Dao and Fate Dao. In addition, this ability was similar to Fate Dao, and was an endowment in nature: It could activate a person's shadow and give a person a quick power-up in a short period of time. At the same time, they gained the ability to manipulate shadows.</p>

    <p>But Wu Yuanji and Zheng Tianqiang clearly could only manipulate shadows at the most basic level.</p>

    <p>If this was the power of a Great Dao, it certainly wouldn't just be as simple as this bestowed ability...</p>

    <p>Which was why Wang Ling was thoroughly alarmed.</p>

    <p>His little sister wasn't born yet... She hadn't even been inside Mother Wang's belly for half a month, but she already knew how to make trouble... After she was born, she would definitely be Red Flame Mad Devil Mo Xiaobei<sup>1</sup>!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A character in "My Own Swordsman..")</dfn>

    <p>It was September 22nd, the thirty-ninth day of the summer break.</p>

    <p>Songhai First Prison was attacked by an unknown force. Director Zhuo Yi, who had been carrying out an investigation, took the lead and successfully held them back along with Warden Liang, saved all the prison combat officers, and even apprehended a sub-leader of the unknown force along with one hundred members of this gang - the news exploded online.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi became more famous than ever.</p>

    <p>The scene last night of Wang Ling casting a Heavenly Dao spell while in Zhuo Yi's body was also perfectly recorded by the prison cameras. Although no one could understand what the spell was, they were already deeply shaken by the abstruse and complicated array runes of the Tian Gang Infinite Health Array.</p>

    <p>Some of Zhuo Yi's peers in particular were secretly anti-fans who went around saying that Zhuo Yi's reputation was an empty one and that he didn't have any real talent. A lot of people were very unhappy with how Zhuo Yi would run to take credit basically any time there was a battle that didn't have reliable video evidence - how could such a person be a leader?</p>

    <p>But the combat strength that Zhuo Yi displayed last night instantly left this bunch of anti-fans speechless...</p>

    <p>His battle stance was graceful, to say nothing of the fact that they couldn't even find the array runes in the dictionary!</p>

    <p>Thus, the moment the surveillance video was released, Zhuo Yi was instantly elevated to new heights by his peers, and he even had the honor of being bestowed a new nickname â€” a man who secretly takes extra lessons.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was highly interested in the interrogation. Once there was progress, Zhuo Yi would instantly report it to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>As for Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>There were two things which worried him.</p>

    <p>Based on the fluctuations coming from Wu Yuanji's and Zheng Tianqiang's bodies, Wang Ling determined that, while Wang Nuan had granted them their abilities, it hadn't been deliberate, and could be called an unintentional mistake.</p>

    <p>It would be ten months before Wang Nuan popped out, and there was likely to be plenty of fetal movement during this period of time.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was already adept at drawing Dao talisman seals, so he wondered if he should draw one for Ah Nuan, and at least prevent her from accidentally leaking energy when she rolled around in the belly.</p>

    <p>Thus, as the news was talking about Zhuo Yi that morning, Wang Ling raised Wang Nuan's matter with Father Wang. Drawing a talisman seal or whatnot meant extra spending: the talisman paper and special materials required cost about a thousand yuan.</p>

    <p>This wasn't a large sum of money. In fact, as long as Wang Ling used his "Ling Zhenren" identity to ask around in the group, no one would refuse him the cash.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling wasn't in the habit of asking outsiders for money. Family matters were an internal affair, and should be handled internally.</p>

    <p>This was also one of the family rules that Father and Mother Wang had drawn up for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>After hearing the whole story, Father Wang pushed up his glasses and then put down his coffee. "That's a good idea. But you'll have to earn the money yourself. As a reminder, you have to earn money with the abilities of a regular cultivation high school student, which means that your strength should be at the late Foundation Establishment stage at the very most. If you exceed this realm, two hundred yuan will be deducted from your allowance next month."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had thought Father Wang would readily agree - he never thought that this biological father of his would actually tell him to earn the money himself...</p>

    <p>As expected of his biological father...</p>

    <p>"It's not a large sum, and I could give it to you. But, Ling Ling, think about it - this is a big brother's feelings for a little sister. If the talisman you draw for your little sister is created from materials gathered with your own hard work, I believe that Ah Nuan will be very touched after she's born!"</p>

    <p>After giving his earnest advice, Father Wang patted Wang Ling on the shoulder. "Go and think of something first. If there's really nothing you can do, your dad will give you the money."</p>

    <p>This was a flawless statement; in the end, Wang Ling couldn't find an excuse to ask for the money.</p>

    <p>Father Wang watched Wang Ling go up the stairs and felt a sense of satisfaction.</p>

    <p>The moment Mother Wang fell pregnant with Wang Nuan, Father Wang had already decided to groom Wang Ling into a sis-con, to ensure that the brother and sister had a harmonious relationship.</p>

    <p>Actually, there wasn't much further to go at this point in time...</p>

    <p>And so came Wang Ling's second worry: a part-time job.</p>

    <p>He, a sixteen-year-old high school student, taking up a part-time job...</p>

    <p>Would anyone hire him?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was highly doubtful...</p>

    <p>He decided to first figure out what he could do.</p>

    <p>Based on the Wang family's rules for a part-time job, the main thing was that he wasn't allowed to use his innate Heavenly Dao ability to make money. In other words, this decree directly forbade Wang Ling from using Heavenly Dao spells to make money, which would have been easy for him.</p>

    <p>Then, putting these sort of fantastical jobs aside, what else could he do?</p>

    <p>Work as a temp at a convenience store?</p>

    <p>Hand out leaflets on the street?</p>

    <p>Or work at KFC?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>A little survey: What sort of work do you Wang Ling could do?</p>
