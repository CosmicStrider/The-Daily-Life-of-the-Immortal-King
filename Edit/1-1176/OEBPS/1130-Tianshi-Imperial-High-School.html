  <h1>Chapter 1130 Tianshi Imperial High School</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Fang Xing had transferred from Tianshi Imperial High School, but Headmaster Chen didn't know much about the school.</p>

    <p>Tianshi Imperial High School, Imperial High for short.</p>

    <p>Imperial High had given birth to numerous talented people throughout the generations, and was the first choice of cultivation high schools for the children of Jinghua dignitaries. However, Tianshi Imperial High School wasn't participating in the national body technique competition this time, which was a relief to the many high schools that were fighting for a place on the rankings.</p>

    <p>If Tianshi Imperial High School took part, it would at least rank in the top four.</p>

    <p>"Given Imperial High's reputation, there's no need for it to rely on this sort of national competition to make a name for itself. This is a dangerous event, and I'm guessing that some of the leaders didn't want their children to participate, so the school didn't sign up for it," Headmaster Jin said.</p>

    <p>"You haven't told me; how did you poach them?"</p>

    <p>"Imperial High has some special admission students every year who don't have to pay the tuition fee. If their grades and rankings drop in the first semester, they won't be able to enjoy the welfare benefit of free tuition the following year. These few came over because they couldn't afford the tuition fee," Headmaster Jin whispered.</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen raised his eyebrows and instantly understood.</p>

    <p>He gazed at the few students from Imperial High. Although they had already transferred out, each of them still carried imposing momentum and had the aura of a prodigy.</p>

    <p>The competition at Imperial High was extremely fierce. While they might have switched schools because their grades had dropped and they couldn't afford the full tuition fee, they were essentially still very outstanding.</p>

    <p>As for why they had chosen Number 59 High, given Headmaster Chen's understanding of his junior brother, it was likely that Headmaster Jin had used his silver tongue and personally run over to poach these people... There was no one better than his junior brother at this.</p>

    <p>Headmaster Jin: "When we get there, I'll pull in some other schools into our alliance. We have to fight for the top 50 at the very least!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Headmaster Chen and San Yuan, who was on the side, couldn't help but mutter derisively -"The top 50... You aren't ambitious enough!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At about one in the afternoon, the air immortal warship landed at the Nine Dragon camp earmarked by the Alliance of Ten Thousand Cultivation Schools. Several air immortal warships from other districts were already parked in the camp's large parking bay. Although Number 60 High and Number 59 High had arrived four hours ahead of time, they weren't the first to arrive.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked around the camp and scanned the surrounding terrain with his King's Eye. The place had already been locked down, and except for the students participating in the competition, teachers, and staff responsible for maintaining order, there was no one staff member who was being idle. People from the Immortal Arts Mobile Squadron had even been dispatched to set up multiple defense lines outside the camp, and all vehicles passing through the camp had to undergo strict inspections.</p>

    <p>The security precautions put in place for the national body technique competition this time were top notch. There were one thousand students from all over the country taking part; protecting the students was always the number one priority.</p>

    <p>Of course, there was in fact another very important reason â€” the competition venue this time was Nine Dragon Mountain, which wasn't just any scenic region.</p>

    <p>The legendary heavenly vein master valve was located here. President Qi and his teacher Huang Feng had seen through the plot behind the theft of Dark Ancestor Xie Sanxiao's skull a while ago, so naturally, security had been tightened for the national competition this time.</p>

    <p>Thus, while Wang Ling and the rest had arrived beforehand, they weren't idle. Those who arrived first would be checked first, and no one could escape.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stood with the others in line, and very soon, a team of men in crimson Dao robes and who were arranged in an orderly immortal sword formation flew over from a distance.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao couldn't contain his excitement. "It's Nine Dragon Mountain's resident special forces!"</p>

    <p>Someone asked, "Resident special forces?"</p>

    <p>"Each person in the resident special forces has a remarkable history and is a talent who has been carefully selected. Any one of them could be a captain in Magnificent Immortal," Chen Chao explained. "But the resident special forces aren't found everywhere. I heard that the spirit vein under Nine Dragon Mountain is very complex, so there is a resident special force team here which guards the vein all year round to prevent it from being plundered."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, everyone instantly understood. These students from all over the country were awed by the heroic bearing of the Nine Dragon Mountain resident special forces. They gradually started to realize how much importance the Alliance of Ten Thousand Cultivation Schools had placed on this national competition.</p>

    <p>Even the resident special forces had been assigned to maintain security. They simply couldn't be any more handsome!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and the others didn't wait long in the queue. These members of the resident special forces in crimson Dao robes first broke into pairs and started to set up an array in the rather empty encampment.</p>

    <p>They carved cryptic and indecipherable runes into the ground one by one, and then stood on both sides of the array to skillfully make hand seals in a calm and composed manner. They were so handsome that no one could take their eyes off them.</p>

    <p>"It's the Star Relocation Array!"</p>

    <p>In the final moment before the array was completed, some of the more knowledgeable students were finally able to recognize what it was.</p>

    <p>It was the Star Relocation Array! It was a teleportation array that could instantly teleport a building!</p>

    <p>With a flash of splendid light, a pagoda-like building instantly appeared in the empty encampment. This pagoda would be where everyone would spend the first night.</p>

    <p>A lot of the students present thought it was strange, however - after the resident special forces used the array to pull this pagoda over, they didn't do anything more, so the students stayed put and waited.</p>

    <p>A few minutes later, a team of doctors in white robes slowly emerged from the base of the pagoda. One doctor who looked a little older stepped forward and finally gave Wang Ling and the others their first instructions since landing. "The Nine Dragon Pagoda will open at 5pm sharp. During this period, everyone is expected to line up at the door in an orderly manner to first go through an individual routine inspection."</p>

    <p>The old doctor then pointed to two huge tents that had been set up nearby. "For the time being, you won't be divided according to schools for the inspection. Please line up according to gender: Boys queue in front of the tent on the left, and girls in front of the tent on the right. Wait for your number to be called."</p>

    <p>What was this? A physical examination?</p>

    <p>Many people didn't understand, since nothing like this had been mentioned in the itinerary that the schools had sent out.</p>

    <p>But this was an official request, so everyone could only obey.</p>

    <p>The truth was that this wasn't so much a physical examination as a verification of identity. There were a large number of students participating in this competition. In the previous military drill for six schools, that Old Devil had snuck in as a student, and President Qi and his Teacher Huang couldn't guarantee that some mole wouldn't appear in the national competition this time.</p>

    <p>So there was nothing wrong with being a little more cautious.</p>

    <p>The boys were divided into groups of five.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Wang Zhen, Chen Chao, Guo Hao and Gu Shunzhi were in one group.</p>

    <p>Once they entered the tent, Wang Ling saw the old doctor who had been responsible for giving out the instructions.</p>

    <p>The old doctor looked them up and down, then calmly said, "Now, everyone take off your clothes, except for your underwear."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>It wasn't like Wang Ling had never gone through a physical exam before, but this was the first time he had to bare himself in front of other people.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Ling wondered if he should knead his body a little before he undressed in order to create a little bit of flab; he would be rather conspicuous if his physique was too good.</p>
