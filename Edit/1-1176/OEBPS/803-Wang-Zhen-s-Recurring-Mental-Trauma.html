  <h1>Chapter 803 Wang Zhen's Recurring Mental Trauma</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Zhen suddenly woke up in a fright, finally roused as if from a nightmare under the combined beating from this couple, who were also his biological parents. When he woke up, however, he checked himself and his surroundings.</p>

    <p>Mm... Something was still wrong with the situation!</p>

    <p>Because it was his five-year-old body.</p>

    <p>And he was in his bedroom, his whole body smeared in anesthetic and unable to move even an inch.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen didn't know where he actually was now because he had fainted after leaving Midnight Dining Hall. Wang Zhen guessed that he had probably entered dreams of his childhood while he was in a coma.</p>

    <p>From when he was just born, he had gone back to his five-year-old self?</p>

    <p>After waking up, Wang Zhen felt a little nostalgic, and also a little scared.</p>

    <p>At that moment, a voice that Wang Zhen was familiar with and also afraid of came from outside.</p>

    <p>"Zhenzhen fainted yesterday after his failed awakening? Who knows if he's awake yet... what should we do? I heard that Gu Cheng next door has already mastered five hundred Heavenly Dao; his mother still came to show off yesterday! Pisses me off! (╬◣д◢)"</p>

    <p>"Don't be angry, my dear. Zhenzhen can't be blamed for this. Actually, it's all my fault..." A man sighed with some self-reproach. "I was the one who forgot to tell the new therapist that Zhenzhen absolutely can't use supplementary medicine to awaken. Who would have thought that after the therapist gave him the medicine yesterday, Zhenzhen's body would actually have a reaction to it."</p>

    <p>"Then what should we do now? Is there still hope for Zhenzhen to surpass Gu Cheng?"</p>

    <p>"Zhenzhen has already mastered more than four hundred Heavenly Dao. As long as he can recover quickly, his cultivation progress won't be delayed. Our Wang family's blood is amazing!"</p>

    <p>"Alright, then what should we do? I'll listen to you!"</p>

    <p>The couple then pushed open the door and entered.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen stared at this pair of demons with wide, frightened eyes.</p>

    <p>Seeing that Wang Zhen was awake, his mother hurried to embrace him. The woman's powerful hands clutched him around the neck, almost choking him to death. "Ah! Zhenzhen, you're up!"</p>

    <p>His father felt his forehead and sighed. "No fever, but his face doesn't look very good. And it seems that Zhenzhen can't move for now, probably because of an allergic reaction to the medicine."</p>

    <p>Sitting on the edge of the bed, Wang Zhen's father gripped his hands tightly. "Zhenzhen, tell me, do you feel sore, painful and numb all over, and also a little itchy? Blink if you do."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Wang Zhen suddenly opened his eyes wide, and completely didn't dare blink...</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen then saw the man hold up a fist. "Zhenzhen, do you see this sandbag-sized fist?"</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen: "..."</p>

    <p>His dad smiled at him. "So~ lar~ Fist!"</p>

    <p>As soon as he said the words, a dazzling light suddenly burst out from his fist, and Wang Zhen quickly and unconsciously closed his eyes.</p>

    <p>When he opened his eyes again, the light from the Solar Fist had already faded, and his father was looking at him again with a serious expression. "Honey, look, Zhenzhen blinked..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen was so frightened the hair all over his body stood on end.</p>

    <p>He had actually been forced to blink!</p>

    <p>His mom looked at him with a pained expression. "Then, what should we do?"</p>

    <p>His dad: "It's just as I thought. We need Zhenzhen to recover from his allergic reaction quickly. When I asked him just now if he felt itchy, didn't he blink?"</p>

    <p>His mom was startled. "Honey, do you mean... that Zhenzhen is feeling itchy right now?"</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen: "..."</p>

    <p>His dad nodded. "Yes, that's what I meant! And Zhenzhen blinked!"</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen: "..."</p>

    <p>His dad: "This child has yet to get over his allergy, and it's mostly an itch. He'll be fine after a beating!"</p>

    <p>His mom looked like she was suddenly enlightened. "I see!"</p>

    <p>His dad: "Mm, honey! Just follow me: left hand, right hand, slowly <sup>1</sup> . We'll take turns."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(From TFBOYS's song "Manual of Youth..")</dfn>

    <p>His mom had an aching and teary expression on her face. "Alright, husband..."</p>

    <p>"This is all for Zhenzhen's good!"</p>

    <p>His dad nodded. "You have to remember to distribute the hits evenly over every part of his body! I have OCD, if the skin color isn't well-distributed, I'll hit him again!"</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen: "Stop... stop it!"</p>

    <p>Ten minutes later...</p>

    <p>Under the combined series of hand strikes, five-year-old Wang Zhen was directly thrashed into a crispy skin roasted duck, successfully activating his body resistance to the allergy and his subsequent recovery.</p>

    <p>His mom: "Honey! It really worked! Zhenzhen can move now!"</p>

    <p>His dad: "As expected of the most outstanding person of our Wang family bloodline in recent years! He can still move even after being beaten up like this! I think we should use more force next time..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"No!!!"</p>

    <p>Following the couple's words, Wang Zhen woke with a start once again.</p>

    <p>Hm...</p>

    <p>The dream wasn't over yet.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen was still in his room, but unlike before, he could move this time.</p>

    <p>He went to the mirror in the bedroom and looked at himself.</p>

    <p>This was his ten-year-old appearance.</p>

    <p>This memory...</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen searched for a bit and realized that there was actually a gap in his memories from this time.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen recalled that after he grew up, he had used magic to make many of his childhood memories disappear...</p>

    <p>In other words, if he couldn't remember this memory, it couldn't be a good one...</p>

    <p>Dazed, Wang Zhen suddenly had a bad feeling.</p>

    <p>Just then, there was a knock on the door.</p>

    <p>"Come in," Wang Zhen said as he straightened his outfit.</p>

    <p>An old woman pushed the door open and came in carrying a tray covered with a red cloth. This was an old servant of the Wang family, and was also Wang Zhen's nursemaid who had watched him grow up.</p>

    <p>The old woman put the tray down on the table. "Lord Young Master, the Master and Madam are out today."</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen was exultant when he heard this.</p>

    <p>It looked like the demonic couple wouldn't be abusing him today...</p>

    <p>But before he could finish being joyful, the old woman spoke again. "Lord Young Master, Master and Madam request that you summon a clone of yourself to administer your beating today."</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen: "Wha- what?"</p>

    <p>The old woman: "Same as usual, when you beat yourself, you must control your strength - the color of your skin must be evenly distributed. This old servant will take photos of the whole process for the Master. If you don't do it well, the Master said that you'll have to do it again when he returns, and he'll teach you how to hit yourself."</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen: "..."</p>

    <p>After that, the old woman lifted the red cloth off the tray.</p>

    <p>Under the red cloth was a mace studded with jade and gold nails, a whip as thick as a Cola bottle, and a feather duster made from phoenix feathers...</p>

    <p>The old woman: "This is today's equipment. Please choose, Young Master."</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen: "..."</p>
