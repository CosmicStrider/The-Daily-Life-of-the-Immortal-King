  <h1>Chapter 253 Luo Chuang's Collection </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Hence, it wasn't that Jingke didn't have a scabbard, but that Wang Ling had destroyed it as a child. Jingke's body was covered with a layer of some mysterious substance that Wang Ling to this day had been unable to see through, and which played an important role in controlling his strength.</p>

    <p>But this substance was different from the special material in the Dao talisman seal from Wang Ming; it wasn't something that seemed to drain Wang Ling's strength when he touched it. This peach wood sword was just a street stall product which Father Wang had picked up at the bird and flower market. Until now, Wang Ling hadn't been able to clearly determine its origin.</p>

    <p>When it spawned a sword spirit for real, which was when Jingke was born, it had actually happened six years ago when the Gate Between Worlds had just descended.</p>

    <p>There had been a time when Wang Ling had even wondered if Jingke was related to the Gate Between Worlds.</p>

    <p>But later it seemed to have just been a coincidence.</p>

    <p>That was because Jingke's sword qi was too righteous; it didn't contain even the slightest whiff of evil qi. Hanging the sword by the bed could ward off evil, and when Wang Ling wielded it, it could kill demons and monsters. Its three views were so upright that Wang Ling wondered if Jingke had absorbed the essence of socialist core values before birth.</p>

    <p>Looking back, this was the first time that Wang Ling had thought about the scabbard.</p>

    <p>Because he had crushed Jingke's scabbard when he had still been very young, he hadn't paid any attention to it all; even when he regularly cleaned Jingke's sword body, he had never considered this issue.</p>

    <p>Hence, when he heard Luo Chuang's words, he stared at Jingke on the sword tray in deep contemplation.</p>

    <p>As Luo Chuang had explained, it went without saying how helpful a scabbard would be for a sword. Not every sword could automatically generate protective sword qi like Jingke. In the absence of a scabbard, many spirit swords would be faced with the problem of corrosion.</p>

    <p>Although Jingke had protective sword qi, that didn't mean that the scabbard wasn't important. Seventy percent of a spirit sword's overall power was contained in its body, and thirty percent in its scabbard. A sword's full power couldn't be realized until the two parts were combined.</p>

    <p>"Lord Jingke's original body is already very powerful; if you can find a suitable scabbard for him, he will become a truly godly and powerful sword." Luo Chuang looked at Jingke and sighed with some regret.</p>

    <p>Waving his palm-leaf fan, he looked at Wang Ling as if he wanted to say something, but after opening his mouth, he didn't say anything in the end.</p>

    <p>He looked at the time and realized that it was still quite early. Wang Ling had brought Sheep over right after school. From when they had first set out to the completion of Sheep's maintenance, everything had taken less than an hour in total.</p>

    <p>After maintenance, Sheep was in significantly better spirits than usual, and she blinked curiously at the inside of Luo Chuang's shop.</p>

    <p>In addition to the magic treasures that were stored in the cabinets on the left and right, Luo Chuang also had a collection of some magic treasures which were prominently displayed on the wall. Each magic treasure was covered in a protective spirit layer.</p>

    <p>"I have to confess, Ling Zhenren, that these magic treasures are the pride of my collection," Luo Chuang said and laughed. "I had official department experts appraise each of them, and they're all one hundred percent genuine. Furthermore, they have already been given valuations, so if any kind of loss happens, I can get ninety-five percent compensation for it."</p>

    <p>As Sheep looked around, her eyes landed on something that looked like leather armor.</p>

    <p>It was flesh-colored leather armor covered with hair. There was also a helmet with two huge tusks mounted on each side.</p>

    <p>"What is this?" asked Sheep as she pointed with her little finger.</p>

    <p>"Have you ever heard of the sky demon pig?" asked Luo Chuang.</p>

    <p>Sheep blinked and shook her head.</p>

    <p>This was actually the sky demon pig?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's eyes lit up because he had read about it before in historical records.</p>

    <p>The sky demon pig had been the first demon king to come out of the Gate Between Worlds when it had descended for the first time. When the sky demon pig had landed at the time, it had triggered an apocalyptic-like flood beyond compare. The worst thing, however, was that nothing could surpass this sky demon pig's super armor state <sup>1</sup> . Its defensive power was at its highest in this state, on par with the terrifying hardness of a demon god.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(In the game 'Dungeon Fighter
Online,' players in the super
armor state have increased
physical defense and vitality.)</dfn>

    <p>In that battle, if General Yi hadn't seized the slight moment when the sky demon pig's super state had faltered a little to kill it in one timely strike and prevent further damage, the consequences would have been inconceivable.</p>

    <p>"This pig skin and tusks cost me a fortune. After many setbacks, I was finally able to get my hands on this pig skin. Initially, I had wanted to make a full set of magic robes out of it, but unfortunately, there wasn't enough of the skin for it, so I only made this leather armor. Once you put it on and activate your spirit energy, you'll experience the effects of a super state for a short period of time.</p>

    <p>"There's currently a lot of sky demon pigskin armor on the market that claim to be the real deal, but they're all actually fake. Only mine is the real thing!"</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang waved his palm-leaf fan and looked at the pigskin armor which he had made, full of pride. "I was once invited to an auction where I discovered that someone was actually selling sky demon pigskin armor, which pissed me off... did they think their Gracia Family's Symbol Set <sup>2</sup> was a world first?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is adapted from the
'Dungeon Fighter Online'
game, and is a colloquial
phrase to refer to in-game
items that are very easy to
obtain and have high specs.)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Everyone had their pride as well as things that they were proud of.</p>

    <p>To take Luo Chuang as an example, he wasn't a person who cared about appearance. He used to be handsome too â€” was there anyone who had never gone through a beauty phase before? But he had figured out hundreds of years ago... looks weren't of any damn use! To him, the ultimate supremacy was becoming an outstanding smith, and the thing he was most proud of was the collection of various magic treasures which he had accumulated over the centuries!</p>

    <p>In addition to the leather armor made from the sky demon pig, the shop actually held a lot of collector items which Luo Chuang cherished.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was surprised to find that most of these had to do with defense.</p>

    <p>"I went all over the world in the last few centuries to collect the hardest armor I could find," Luo Chuang said and grinned. "Of course, my biggest wish is to create a supreme godly sword that can easily destroy all this armor."</p>

    <p>When he said this, he abruptly turned to look at the shop's main door. Wang Ling and Sheep followed his gaze and straightaway saw a shield hanging behind the door.</p>

    <p>It was dark blue and covered in layers of plating, like fish scales arranged in sequence. At first glance, it didn't look like anything out of the ordinary, but it emitted a faint sense of the deep sea. After carefully feeling it out, a person could actually get the impression that they were drowning.</p>

    <p>What was this?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling narrowed his eyes, feeling that this thing wasn't simple.</p>

    <p>"This is a shield made from the scales of the western deep-sea water spirit Huogedun. Its skin is quite thick, and its defensive abilities are reinforced in areas that have water, such as on rainy days, in lakes, in the sea..."</p>

    <p>"It's also called the Huo Shield <sup>3</sup> for short," said Luo Chuang.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(The phrase in pinyin, 'huo
dun,' is how fans refer to the
Iron Man/Captain America
pairing in fanworks ..)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
