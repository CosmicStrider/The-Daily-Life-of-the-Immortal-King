  <h1>Chapter 816 The Sect Leader Of Sand Sculpture Sect</h1>

  <div>

    <p>No one ever made up outlandish stories on their own.</p>

    <p>When the imaginations of a group of people ran wild together, the holes in their brains would often get bigger and bigger until it eventually turned into a void...</p>

    <p>The Ten Generals had proven this with a practical demonstration.</p>

    <p>A few minutes later, the Ten Generals, who were still on standby in the immortal warship and represented by General Yi, had the following conversation with Lord Diulei, who was in the machine room.</p>

    <p>"Your Excellency Lord Diulei, may I ask, when will we be going on stage?" General Yi asked meekly.</p>

    <p>For a moment, Lord Diulei was slow to react, as he felt that this sentence somehow seemed a little odd, but he still replied, "General Yi and the other generals, please wait a little longer. You'll go on stage after the end of the exhibition match. We're still warming up, and we must make sure the atmosphere is right before you show up!"</p>

    <p>"Your Excellency Senior Immortal, you're too polite. We're just following orders..." General Yi laughed. "Actually, more than half of us Ten Generals are already retired. Currently, the major matters in Huaxiu Alliance are mostly handled by Explosion Saint General Bai and Wisdom Saint President Qi. The rest of us just do what we can in our old age."</p>

    <p>"Ha ha ha, General Yi, you're too modest!" Lord Diulei said.</p>

    <p>General Yi: "Your Excellency Senior Immortal, don't call me General Yi... Just call me Old Yi! We're already familiar with each other, don't stand on ceremony!"</p>

    <p>"Old Yi... is that appropriate?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was blank. He felt that there was something a little strange about General Yi. "Isn't this a little impolite?"</p>

    <p>"Nothing wrong with it. Or you can directly call me Little Yiyi or Little Little Yi from now on!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei sucked in a cold breath of air. "... Then, I'll call you Brother Yi... okay?"</p>

    <p>"Brother Yi? Mm, that's good, too!"</p>

    <p>General Yi had thought it over. Since he was trying to cotton up to Lord Diulei, the form of address should naturally change first. The latter calling him general was too much like an outsider! Now that they called each other brother, it did sound like they were a lot closer!</p>

    <p>"From now on, Your Excellency Senior Immortal, don't treat us as outsiders. You call us Ten Generals brothers, it's fine. As for Medicine Saint Luo Qiuhuai, you can call her Sis Luo."</p>

    <p>"Sis... Luo?"</p>

    <p>Wait a minute!</p>

    <p>When Lord Diulei heard this, he finally realized what wasn't right.</p>

    <p>Just now, it seemed that General Yi had called him Your Excellency Senior Immortal...</p>

    <p>Wrong!</p>

    <p>What was going on?!</p>

    <p>Why were the Ten Generals suddenly addressing him so respectfully?!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei clutched his head, feeling like his brain had been hit with a "duang" and was hurting badly.</p>

    <p>"General Yi... oh, no, Brother Yi, is there something you want to say to me?" Lord Diulei asked.</p>

    <p>General Yi laughed. "No, no, I just think that we'll be closer this way. After all, our Huaxiu Alliance and the Office of Strategic Deception have a very special relationship now, like parents whose daughter is about to get married."</p>

    <p>"Brother Yi, this analogy..." Lord Diulei found himself actually loss for words.</p>

    <p>"My analogy is very fitting! I haven't finished! What I mean is that our Huaxiu Alliance is the couple, and the Office of Strategic Deception is the daughter about to be married, and we, the Ten Generals, are her dowry maids!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>At the same time, the arena challenge on stage had turned red hot.</p>

    <p>After the twelve Earth-level sect leaders' defeat, three Sky-level sect leaders had already come up to fight one by one.</p>

    <p>It could only be said that they were in the end Sky-level sect leaders who each had their own pride and were unwilling to associate with others...</p>

    <p>But the truth was that after the sweeping defeat of the twelve Earth-level sect leaders, whom many of the reporters below the stage continued to take photos of and write about, a lot of the Sky-level sect leaders, who had initially intended to form groups to take up the challenge, abandoned the idea of teaming up.</p>

    <p>If they went up and then wound up leaving the stage in the same way as the twelve Earth-level sect leaders, it would definitely be humiliating once the news got out!</p>

    <p>So, it was better for them to fight one-on-one. Even if they lost, they could say that they weren't themselves today.</p>

    <p>But even as the three Sky-level sect leaders stepped into the arena for the challenge, none of them gave satisfying performances.</p>

    <p>This Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch was really too strong...</p>

    <p>In five short minutes, the three challengers were sent off the stage.</p>

    <p>The audience present only heard three wretched cries.</p>

    <p>"Ah ya!"</p>

    <p>"Ow!"</p>

    <p>"Hurts, hurts, hurts!"</p>

    <p>All the reporters: "..."</p>

    <p>The last cry of pain was from the sect leader of Sand Sculpture Sect, which was a Sky-level sixth-class sect.</p>

    <p>Sand Sculpture Sect had been doing well the last two years, relying on its secret sand and stone construction technique to make a name for itself. Not only could this technique be used to construct buildings, it could be used in battle. A lot of civil engineering university graduates joined Sand Sculpture Sect, and many who came out of the sect became outstanding architects.</p>

    <p>As the sect leader who was in control, Sect Leader Ni (full name: Ni Ailuo) of Sand Sculpture Sect naturally had strength that one couldn't look down on.</p>

    <p>On stage, Sect Leader Ni had straightaway unleashed his killer move â€” Sand Sculpture Funeral <sup>1</sup> !!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Adapted from Sand Waterfall
Funeral, Gaara's killer move in
"Naruto .. ")</dfn>

    <p>The rubble inside the arena instantly crumbled into fine powder, which ultimately coalesced into two dragons that appeared abruptly out of the ground to twine around Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch's ankles, trapping him firmly in place.</p>

    <p>What a terrifying move!</p>

    <p>The thick, earth-colored dragons made of sand climbed up around his ankles, as if fusing the lower half of Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch's body with the arena, so that he was unable to move at all. And the scariest thing was what followed after this spell was successfully cast!</p>

    <p>Almost everyone could sense a tremendous amount of spirit power molecules coalescing continuously within the sand. The earth dragons created by the "Sand Sculpture Funeral" actually absorbed spirit qi from deep in the earth's veins and broke it down into fine spirit power molecules.</p>

    <p>"Sect Master Ni doesn't have to expend much spirit energy at all with this move. This spirit power is extracted entirely from the earth's veins. Once it reaches a certain amount, Sect Master Ni just needs to give a slight nudge, and Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch's legs might as well be crippled..." Lu Youming analyzed below the stage.</p>

    <p>But he didn't say anything too definitive.</p>

    <p>Because he didn't see any sign of panic on Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch's face.</p>

    <p>The next moment, Sect Master Ni clasped his hands behind his back and stared at Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch. "Dao Monarch, you now have two choices: 1. If you surrender of your own accord, I'll send you out of the arena with dignity. 2. Your legs will be broken. But don't worry, I'll control my strength, and make sure to snap them rather than blow them apart, so you can reattach them later."</p>

    <p>"Sect Master Ni seems very confident."</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch chuckled, and in the next moment, his expression suddenly turned serious.</p>

    <p>Fixing his gaze on the earth dragons wrapped around his lower body, he boomed, "You, don't touch me."</p>

    <p>Several microseconds later, the earth dragons directly retreated back into the ground...</p>
