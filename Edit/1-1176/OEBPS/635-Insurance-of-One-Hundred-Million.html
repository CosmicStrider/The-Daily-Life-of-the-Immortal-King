  <h1>Chapter 635 Insurance of One Hundred Million</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Right at that moment, President Bai and that Elder Ji Xing next to him hadn't gone very far and were at the top of this apartment building. When they turned around earlier, they teleported to the top floor of the apartment, which they had just bought by giving the previous owner a price he couldn't refuse, in order to monitor Elder Zuo Wu's movements.</p>

    <p>The truth was that President Bai had already anticipated that Elder Zuo Wu would fail in this operation. Before Elder Zuo Wu had set out, President Bai had deliberately looked for a diviner, who had given him an ominous reading.</p>

    <p>At that moment, the surveillance monitor was showing the inside of the basement supermarket which Elder Zuo Wu had turned into a secret dark chamber. Before he left, President Bai had left behind an Eye of Nothingness<sup>1</sup>. This was President Bai's own eyeball which he had directly plucked out of his eye socket and which could be used as surveillance whenever necessary.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(An ability from the game "Dungeon Fighters Online.")</dfn>

    <p>Because of his powerful self-healing ability, any organ in his body was dispensable for President Bai. Even if his heart was dug out, it could grow back in an instant. Thus, when the Demon Hunters Association had just started out back then, President Bai had specially looked for black market merchants who dealt in top-quality cultivator organs, and had sold his own organs in order to build up huge amounts of capital.</p>

    <p>President Bai was monitoring everything that was happening in the supermarket through his eyeball.</p>

    <p>While he was looking at the image, Ji Xing, who was next to him, said, "I was curious why Lord President went easy on Zuo Wu; it turned out you expected him to commit suicide?"</p>

    <p>As he spoke, the beautiful man didn't forget to take out a powder puff to patch up the slight cracks in his makeup. His makeup was so thick that sometimes a slight smile would cause the powder to fall off or the makeup to crack, so he always carried a powder puff on him and would touch it up from time to time.</p>

    <p>President Bai leaned back against the sofa as the black Wuji Umbrella floating quietly above his head. He said indifferently, "Zuo Wu has followed me for many years, after all. I'm quite familiar with his personality."</p>

    <p>While part of his decision not to kill Elder Zuo Wu right away earlier had to do with their many years as master and servant, this was in fact only a very small part.</p>

    <p>If he really cared about this friendship, he wouldn't have deliberately injured Elder Zuo Wu again when the latter was already seriously injured.</p>

    <p>The fact was that this very move made his attitude explicitly clear to Elder Zuo Wu.</p>

    <p>Elder Zuo Wu had to die.</p>

    <p>But President Bai preferred that Elder Zuo Wu do it himself.</p>

    <p>That way, he would feel a little less guilty.</p>

    <p>Of course, if Elder Zuo Wu didn't understand his meaning, it wasn't a big deal.</p>

    <p>President Bai would have Elder Ji Xing act on his behalf to get rid of Elder Zuo Wu.</p>

    <p>But looking at the current situation, it really wasn't necessary.</p>

    <p>"Elder Zuo Wu has followed Lord President for many years. If Elder Zuo Wu really dies, will Lord President be very sad?" Ji Xing smiled coldly.</p>

    <p>Sad?</p>

    <p>Perhaps...</p>

    <p>"If I have time in the future, I'll light incense in front of Zuo Wu's grave during the festival season," President Bai said. "We don't have much time left... everything is about making sure the master plan goes smoothly."</p>

    <p>Elder Ji Xing raised his eyebrows. He knew what President Bai meant by the master plan - it was the Demon Hunters Association's ultimate goal for expanding their power in Huaxiu nation all these years. Everything was for the sake of obtaining the grade thirteen magic spell "Moon Burial Spell" which Devil King had left behind in Beast King's Remains. As long as they could obtain this great world-destroying spell, the Demon Hunters Association and "Night Chief" would control everything.</p>

    <p>To accomplish great things, it was necessary to make the appropriate sacrifices.</p>

    <p>For the sake of their "Moon Burial Plan," Night Chief had already poured incalculable investments into setting up the "Demon Hunters Association" in Huaxiu.</p>

    <p>Gazing at the surveillance monitor at that moment, which was streaming from his eyeball, President Bai smiled enigmatically. "This time, you were right, Ji Xing."</p>

    <p>"I'm always right. Since I was the one who made the Wuji Umbrella in your hand, I naturally have a particular sensitivity to the materials used. I made this Wuji Umbrella back then with forty-nine holy beast skins, and to this day, it still felt like it was lacking something. But now..."</p>

    <p>Ji Xing smiled and stared at the figure of the silver-haired young man on the monitor. "Now it seems we will finally be able to make up for this lack... the Wuji Umbrella is also pivotal in obtaining Devil King's grade thirteen spell."</p>

    <p>At this moment, the two of them looked at Elder Zuo Wu's emotional face on the monitor screen once again as he took out the "Tian Gang Grenade"...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Brother Xiao, is there a way to stop him?" At the same time, Lord Diulei was also looking at the image which Xiao Yin's clone was projecting into the SUV.</p>

    <p>He had thought about getting Xiao Yin to try and stop Elder Zuo Wu, but instead he couldn't do anything but sigh with regret. Sometimes, a person's imagination was too frightening; Xiao Yin actually hadn't said anything at all, yet this Elder Zuo Wu had started to get agitated all on his own with a "no matter who tries to persuade me, it's no use" mentality.</p>

    <p>Then, Lord Diulei saw the determined look in Elder Zuo Wu's eyes... It was reminiscent of the righteous and revered Master of Guangming Peak who had been willing to sacrifice himself for everyone when the sect was besieged by the six great sects<sup>2</sup>.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(A plot point in the novel "The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber..')</dfn>

    <p>Because of his family's connections with the influential Tang Sect, which dealt in secret weapons, Lord Diulei had a certain understanding of secret weapons. If this Tian Gang Grenade exploded at a distance, no one would be killed... but the problem now was that Elder Zuo Wu was seriously injured, and it could be said that death was inevitable in an explosion at such close range.</p>

    <p>That wouldn't do; they needed this Elder Zuo Wu alive.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin's holy beast blood could heal injuries, but it couldn't wholly bring people back to life.</p>

    <p>There was only one way...</p>

    <p>As he was driving, quick-thinking Lord Diulei immediately sent Wang Ling a text message. "Brother Ling! Are you there?! It's urgent! I know you're lurking!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling responded in almost a second. "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "It's an emergency; I've caught an elder of the Demon Hunters Association, but he wants to kill himself. Do you have a way to bring him back to life?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's reply only had five simple words: "Restricted entry. Can't go in."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei had obviously expected this earlier on. "Then would it be possible for Brother Ling to please help me deliver something to Brother Xiao's clone?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei replied with three words: "Soul Suppression Ring." It was the only way he could think of at the moment to resurrect Elder Zuo Wu without incident.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"It's just sending it over... It won't be damaged, right, Brother Ling?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei reluctantly took off his "Soul Suppression Ring.""I insured it for one hundred million!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
