  <h1>Chapter 963 The Law Protecting Minors in the Cultivation World</h1>

  <div>

    <p>During breakfast, Chen Chao was very vexed and gloomy as he ate.</p>

    <p>He looked at Wang Xiaoling, his heart a little restless. He hadn't asked her outright just now as he didn't want to hurt her. It was said that a daughter was like a close-fitting cotton-padded jacket; it would hurt any girl to know that their own mother had been beaten up.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was a little moved by Chen Chao's thoughts; although Chen Chao was still young, he was clearly a good kid who knew how to consider other people's feelings. If a daughter was a close-fitting cotton-padded jacket, then Chen Chao was a military overcoat.</p>

    <p>This was what Wang Ling thought.</p>

    <p>As Father Chen brought breakfast over, he saw Chen Chao nibbling absentmindedly on a fruit pancake very slowly, and he immediately knew that it was probably Xiaoling's mom who had brought it over. He instantly chastised Chen Chao. "Chao, why didn't you ask Xiaoling's mom to come in?"</p>

    <p>"I did, but, but auntie..." Chen Chao bit back his words.</p>

    <p>Seeing his behavior, Father Chen had an inkling and didn't ask him again.</p>

    <p>After breakfast, Father Chen drew Chen Chao to one side and then finally learned of Xiaoling's mom's injuries. Father Chen wasn't clear on the exact details, but he might be able to put together a rough idea if he asked the people in the neighborhood, and so he called his students who lived close by.</p>

    <p>Since Xiaoling's mom lived in a nearby rental, as did some students of his body techniques dojo, Father Chen thought that his students might have seen something.</p>

    <p>In the end, he learned something with the first call.</p>

    <p>When asked about Xiaoling's mom, the student who received the call was a little reluctant to say anything at first on the other end of the phone - likely his parents had told him beforehand not to be a busybody.</p>

    <p>"You can tell me, I won't tell anyone. You know that Xiaoling is also one of the kids at our body techniques dojo. Do you remember what our dojo's purpose is? We learn martial arts not to fight, but to help the weak and uphold justice! Telling us what you know is helping Xiaoling - this is a righteous act!" said Father Chen.</p>

    <p>He knew that putting it like this was a little forceful and sounded like he was taking the high ground. He knew that it wasn't very good for him to do so, but he had no other choice as he had to know what happened to Xiaoling's mom.</p>

    <p>The child on the other end of the phone fell silent for a short moment before relating the truth. "Dojo Chief, it's like this. I was on my balcony yesterday when I saw Chief Liang's son, Tiger Liang. His leg was in a cast, and he brought a bunch of kids over to bully Xiaoling's mom. They used fireball spells to burn all the junk she collected. They were the ones who caused those two black spots in front of the recycling stand."</p>

    <p>He was only ten years old, which wasn't a rebellious age and was when children would basically listen to whatever their parents said; it was already very brave of him to have the courage to tell Father Chen what he saw.</p>

    <p>After the kid was done, Father Chen found it hard to believe. "Little kids nowadays are beating up other people? Why didn't Liang Heng step in? Are you sure Liang Heng didn't show up yesterday?"</p>

    <p>"Yes; when Tiger Liang was bullying Xiaoling's mom yesterday, Chief Liang never showed up." The child on the other end of the phone said in a low voice, "I wanted to go down and help, but my parents told me not to get involved, and to act as if I hadn't seen anything. They also wouldn't let me call the police. Dojo Chief, don't blame me for this..."</p>

    <p>"It's fine, kid, I understand. Telling me this is already a great help to Xiaoling's mom." Father Chen comforted him.</p>

    <p>Everyone enjoyed a good show but didn't like to get involved; this was a common problem everywhere.</p>

    <p>It wasn't as if warmhearted people didn't exist, but for most of them, the setbacks they suffered weren't light. Actually, everyone had the intention to do good, but what they feared was if it stirred up trouble for themselves.</p>

    <p>After another five or six minutes, the phone call ended.</p>

    <p>Father Chen now roughly understood the situation.</p>

    <p>Tiger Liang was definitely responsible for Xiaoling's mom's injuries.</p>

    <p>Someone nearby had called the police yesterday, but it was already over by the time the police arrived. Also, because this bunch of troublemakers were underaged, they were all released after a few minutes of lecturing at the police station...</p>

    <p>It could be said that Tiger Liang this brat had escaped completely unscathed thanks to the law protecting minors in the cultivation world.</p>

    <p>However, not only was the junk which Xiaoling's mom had painstakingly collected over the whole day burned, she had also been beaten up. The crucial point was that it was kids who had done it, so the hands of the police were also tied.</p>

    <p>But the cultivation police station did lend her civic assistance and had gotten some officers to accompany Xiaoling's mom to the hospital to deal with her injuries.</p>

    <p>The police advised that it would be best for her to find a new place; this bunch of kids had already deliberately stirred up trouble once, and there would definitely be a second time.</p>

    <p>Because of the law protecting minors in the cultivation world, even the police were annoyed that they were helpless to do anything about Tiger Liang.</p>

    <p>After hearing the story, Father Chen was so furious that his body shook.</p>

    <p>Behind a bratty kid there had to be a bratty parent. He didn't believe Tiger Liang would make trouble for Xiaoling's mom for no reason at all - most likely, Liang Heng had incited him to do so.</p>

    <p>And Father Chen also knew that Liang Heng had already gotten wind of the fact that Xiaoling was studying at Father Chen's dojo.</p>

    <p>Father Chen knew that he couldn't stand by and do nothing, but he also couldn't deal with it personally.</p>

    <p>Liang Heng was still hiding in the back to observe the situation; he was using this method to provoke Father Chen so that he could come over in the end to look at his defeated appearance.</p>

    <p>But how should he deal with this?</p>

    <p>Father Chen lit a cigarette and pondered.</p>

    <p>That night, he shared the whole story in the group chat for Father Wang's fan group of alliance leaders.</p>

    <p>Father Chen was now the number one fan leader, and after that major competition yesterday, all the sect leaders had joined the fan group one after another.</p>

    <p>Sect Leader of Heavenly Xuan Sect Han Ren: "That's too much! Isn't this bullying?"</p>

    <p>Founder of Tyrant Earth Sect Zhang Zhide: "This leader of Balance Magic Center is sly, using kids to make trouble with an adult. The law protecting minors is a good thing, but the concern is that some scumbags will take advantage of this loophole to do something illegal! Children taught by this scum wouldn't be good people either."</p>

    <p>Sect Leader of Star Killer Sect Song Kaihua: "I think it's not too late. This kid has been led astray by his father, but he's only ten, after all. He'll inevitably make mistakes, but as long as he's straightened out in time, it'll be fine."</p>

    <p>A discussion started in the group after everyone listened to Father Chen's story.</p>

    <p>Father Chen also said in the group, "So far, I haven't come up with a good way to handle this. I suspect that Tiger Liang this kid will definitely go make trouble again tomorrow, and even if the police hurry over afterward, it still won't be resolved..."</p>

    <p>Han Ren, the sect leader of Heavenly Xuan Sect, suddenly said, "Dojo Chief Chen, in your body techniques dojo, don't you..."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhide immediately said, "Old Han, what are you thinking? How can you incite those kids to go help out in a fight? Wouldn't that be leading them astray? Dojo Chief Chen also isn't that sort of person!"</p>

    <p>"That's true..."</p>

    <p>Han Ren nodded and said, "I'm sorry, Dojo Chief Chen, I put my foot in my mouth."</p>

    <p>Before Father Chen could reply to say that it was fine, he saw Zhang Zhide, the founder of Tyrant Earth Sect, say again, "Dojo Chief Chen isn't someone like that, but I am!"</p>

    <p>Sect Leader of Heavenly Xuan Sect Han Ren: "..."</p>

    <p>Sect Leader of Star Killer Sect Song Kaihua: "..."</p>

    <p>Father Chen: "..."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhide said, "After all, our three sects are all based in Songhai City. My son is eight years old. Old Han, Old Song, how old are your kids?"</p>

    <p>Han Ren: "I only have one son, he's eleven."</p>

    <p>Song Kaihua: "Hm... my younger son is nine."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhide: "The world is a ruthless place! It's time for them to understand how wretched it can be."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhide sent an evil laugh emoji. "After all, it's just a fight between kids, and we're not breaking the law. They use their kids, we'll use our kids."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Father Chen was stunned.</p>

    <p>Were the kids of these three sect leaders about to teach Tiger Liang a lesson?</p>

    <p>Tiger Liang was Iron Crutch Li <sup>1</sup> now... It was possible that his second leg might also be broken tomorrow...</p>
