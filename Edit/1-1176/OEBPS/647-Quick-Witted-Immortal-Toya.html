  <h1>Chapter 647 Quick-Witted Immortal Toya</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It could only be said that Daoist Guang was an honest and sincere person; furthermore, he had very earnestly made well-fitting clothes for himself using the island's resources. But Wang Ling really couldn't imagine what it must be like for an old man in a maid's outfit to look into the camera lens while live streaming and ask cutely, "Am I pretty?"...</p>

    <p>This was a little too scary. The damage it could cause to a person's three views was equal to a classic line from a TV drama: You just lost a leg, but she lost a beautiful love<sup>1</sup>!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(From the TV drama "Dreams Link.")</dfn>

    <p>Erm...</p>

    <p>But as a live streamer, Daoist Guang was very conscientious; at least he didn't welsh on a deal.</p>

    <p>It was just that Wang Ling felt that Daoist Guang was going further and further down the live streaming path to the point of no return and had completely forgotten that he wanted to reconstruct his body... In any case, Wang Ling couldn't make the choice for Daoist Guang. Everyone had the right to choose how they wanted to live.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Daoist Guang had more than one way open to him now given how many fans he had. He could go through the "Samsara Spirit Tribulation" whenever he wanted now by relying on figurines. When he had just started live streaming at first, this had still seemed like an unreasonable request, but it was now completely within reach.</p>

    <p>In an audience of twenty million viewers, it was very easy to find fans willing to spend money on him.</p>

    <p>Take for example the live streamer "Baboon" who had been blacklisted. Until now, there were people still visiting his live stream room daily to "light incense" and send him gifts. Wang Ling didn't know what on earth these people were thinking - wasn't it better to spend the money instead on crispy noodle snacks?!</p>

    <p>Hugging Er Ha, Xiao Yin half-sat on the edge of the bed. They had kept watch over the girl in gray all night, but there had been no sign of her waking up.</p>

    <p>Where on earth had she come from?</p>

    <p>Why had she appeared in the kun's stomach?</p>

    <p>And what was her background?</p>

    <p>And why had she fallen asleep?</p>

    <p>They didn't know any of this...</p>

    <p>This made Xiao Yin recall "Ya Xuan," the silly girl who had saved his life back then.</p>

    <p>At that time, in order to cure Ya Xuan's illness, Xiao Yin made a deal with Immortal Mansion; he became a holy beast gatekeeper for the Master of Immortal Mansion in exchange for Immortal Mansion's medicinal resources. Now, Ya Xuan was living with Cailian Zhenren while her memories recovered. She drank Immortal Toya's medicine for strengthening the mind every day, but until now there was still no change.</p>

    <p>When Xiao Yin had gone to see Ya Xuan previously, she had even forgotten his name...</p>

    <p>It wasn't that Immortal Toya's medicine didn't work, but that Ya Xuan's amnesia was so severe that her memory was simply like that of a goldfish.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin heard that Immortal Toya had increased the dosage for now; he wondered if Ya Xuan was a little better...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin thought that Ya Xuan and this girl in gray had similar backgrounds — they were both unregistered citizens.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya's Wooden Ox finally arrived at the entrance to the Wang family's small villa at noon. It looked so cool! Sheep's eyes were drawn straight to it! This was her first time seeing such a machine! Her curiosity, however, was purely at its appearance; if they ran together, this four-wheeled car might not be as fast as she was.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya got out, a big purple gourd on his back. He was wearing white Daoist robes paired with an outer blue muslin garment. From far away, he looked like a transcendent being, dressed like a celebrity as always.</p>

    <p>It was less than a month since his last visit to the Wang family's little villa, but for some reason, Immortal Toya felt like it was a lifetime ago.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had already heard the noise from his bedroom. He stood at the window to take a look, and happened to see Immortal Toya standing at the front door with his two disciples; he appeared to be explaining something to them.</p>

    <p>Jin Shi and Yin Shi followed Immortal Toya closely on his left and right. "Shifu, where are we?"</p>

    <p>"I told you before, right? A great senior lives here."</p>

    <p>Jin Shi and Yin Shi nodded. "We know, it's the senior who eats crispy noodle snacks, isn't it?" The siblings spoke in one voice and at the same time in identical tones, which amazed Sheep.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "That's right, it's him! It isn't just this great senior, but everyone in this villa are seniors, so you must be polite, understand?"</p>

    <p>Jin Shi and Yin Shi lowered their heads in thought at the same time. Then they looked up at the same time. "Then, can shifu defeat this great senior?"</p>

    <p>The question made Immortal Toya's lips twitch...</p>

    <p>Of course he knew that even with a hundred or a thousand of himself... he wouldn't be able to defeat Ling Zhenren! The problem was that Jin Shi and Yin Shi were the disciples he viewed as his own kids; how could he, as their shifu, admit that he was inferior to someone else?</p>

    <p>But Immortal Toya also didn't dare directly pat his chest and say that he was very strong; he didn't even dare say that he and Senior Ling were evenly matched... It was alright for him to brag in private, but the problem now was that he was at Senior Ling's front door!</p>

    <p>Sure enough, looking out of the corner of his eye, Immortal Toya saw a figure staring at him from the second floor... That had to be Senior Ling, right?</p>

    <p>That was right... It was definitely Senior Ling...</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya didn't need to sense his aura to know it was him.</p>

    <p>That was because Senior Ling's habit had always been to "lurk" and "observe in the dark."</p>

    <p>To be honest, Wang Ling's figure at the bedroom window on the second floor was giving Immortal Toya the greatest pressure at that moment.</p>

    <p>"Well, can we discuss this after we return to the island?"</p>

    <p>"Is this a taboo subject? Or is shifu actually very weak?" Jin Shi and Yin Shi said again.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya dropped his forehead heavily into his hands. This was a huge pain in the ass. If he had known earlier, he would have gotten Jin Shi and Yin Shi to wait in the car! Since they were going to be in the city, he had simply brought them to Ling Zhenren so that they could make his acquaintance... but he had never thought that these two little bastards would start to undermine him!</p>

    <p>In the end, rural children who had just entered the city would have a lot of questions. He should have bought Jin Shi and Yin Shi each a copy of One Hundred Thousand Whys<sup>2</sup> before they came!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is a well-known Chinese popular science book.)</dfn>

    <p>Right now, Immortal Toya was between a rock and a hard place. He didn't want to lose face in front of his disciples, nor did he want to offend Ling Zhenren.</p>

    <p>Then, at this moment of impending doom, he was seized by inspiration!</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya immediately took out his cell phone and quickly typed out a text message.</p>

    <p>Turning his gaze away, Wang Ling saw that a text had indeed come through.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "Senior Ling... Help! Senior Ling!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "Senior Ling... please let me blow b<sup>3</sup>!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(吹B "blow b" is slang for 'empty bragging.' But the Chinese homonym which the author uses here is 吹逼, where 逼 can be slang for the vagina ..)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Sensing the slight ambiguity in his last message, Immortal Toya hastily clarified, "Please let me brag a little..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "I'll transfer a crispy noodle snack branch property to you!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "Deal."</p>
