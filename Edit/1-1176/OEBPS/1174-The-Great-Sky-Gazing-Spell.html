  <h1>Chapter 1174 The Great Sky-Gazing Spell</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When Sun Rong said this, Wang Ling was gazing up into the night sky. Although her voice was very soft, he still heard her.</p>

    <p>There wasn't any noticeable change in his somewhat wooden expression - only his ears moved a little.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was savoring this moment of peace.</p>

    <p>Of course, he wasn't looking up into the sky purely because he was stargazing, but to prevent a giant meteorite from crashing into Earth... No one knew that on countless, very late nights, Wang Ling would often observe the movements around Earth. As soon as he discovered a meteorite that was on a collision course with Earth, Wang Ling would use the Great Sky-Gazing Spell, just like now, and steer it off course with the power of his King's Eye.</p>

    <p>Many astronomers would find that a meteorite which was initially on a collision course with Earth would be pulled away from its original trajectory by some other gravitational force.</p>

    <p>This was very likely to be Wang Ling's doing.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had been silently protecting world peace all this time...</p>

    <p>The fake Wang Zhen, whom Wang Ling had created using Gao Tianming's puppet, was sitting close by and also looking at the sky. Liu Qingyi and the others couldn't see through an illusion at that level, even when they touched skin, since this sort of powerful magic was especially realistic. Of course, the puppet wasn't completely flawless; it did indeed look a little more wooden.</p>

    <p>Since a puppet didn't have spiritual intelligence, only its appearance could be changed; its IQ couldn't be increased.</p>

    <p>It might have been better to create a clone of Wang Zhen with the Great Separation Spell since a clone's personality would be similar to its master's. However, that would divide up Wang Zhen's combat strength, and given that the enemy he was going to confront was extremely powerful, losing part of his combat strength would put him at a disadvantage.</p>

    <p>So, this was the only way.</p>

    <p>What Wang Ling didn't expect was for Young Miss Liu, who had been bickering with Wang Zhen all this time, to suddenly worry about Wang Zhen's condition.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was a little puzzled by this.</p>

    <p>Theirs should have been a hostile relationship, but it seemed that they had developed a more complicated relationship.</p>

    <p>On the mountaintop, Wang Ling used the Great Sky-Gazing Spell to tidy up several giant meteorites that had been hurtling toward Earth. He then got up and patted the dust off his butt before he gave the floor over to Liu Qingyi, who was on tenterhooks behind him.</p>

    <p>After a long, internal struggle, Liu Qingyi finally sat down next to Wang Zhen at Sun Rong's encouragement. Looking at Wang Zhen's sluggish appearance, she suddenly felt a little distressed.</p>

    <p>How could someone who had been fine before turn into a simpleton who looked like he was comatose...</p>

    <p>"Wang Zhen?"</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi tried calling his name, but the fake Wang Zhen didn't respond at all.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling secretly observed the two of them from where he was standing in front of the boys' tent. He noticed that Sun Rong was also standing outside the girls' tent and stealing looks at what was happening. Wang Ling could see the obvious blush on Sun Rong's face, along with what appeared to be some traces of envy.</p>

    <p>As the night wind blew gently over the mountaintop under the bright starry sky, Liu Qingyi waited a handful of seconds, before resting her head naturally on Wang Zhen's shoulder...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Out on a mission with Xiao Yin and Er Ha elsewhere, Wang Zhen's shoulder felt inexplicably heavy, as if there was an invisible weight pressing down on it.</p>

    <p>"Nervous?" Xiao Yin noticed that Wang Zhen's expression seemed tense.</p>

    <p>"A little." Wang Zhen nodded his head and frowned.</p>

    <p>Logically speaking, he shouldn't be feeling this sort of burden.</p>

    <p>Could it be that the pressure from carrying out a mission at Ling Zhenren's behest for the first time was too much?</p>

    <p>"I was the same when I received a mission from Master for the first time. Just take it easy. In any case, if you really can't handle it, Master will always show up at the right time," said Xiao Yin.</p>

    <p>"Will Ling Zhenren really take action?" Wang Zhen was a little dumbfounded - he had thought that Wang Ling was testing him with this mission, and he had to complete it successfully.</p>

    <p>After listening to Xiao Yin, he instantly felt the joy of having a powerful backer as support. However, Wang Zhen would still treat this mission seriously, since he was representing the Domain of the Gods... If someone from the Domain of the Gods couldn't even deal with an Earth matter, that would be a real humiliation for the Domain of the Gods.</p>

    <p>It was good to have a backer, but you couldn't rely on them forever. One still needed to maintain a humble and calm heart, and continue moving forward.</p>

    <p>"You should have encountered a lot of strong opponents in the Domain of the Gods, right?" The three people moved swiftly through the jungle as they jumped from tree trunk to tree trunk high up in the air and deftly used the surrounding terrain to conceal their movements. As long as they had the power of Shadow Dao, they could freely use shadows to hide their figures and even their auras.</p>

    <p>"The power of Shadow Dao is truly mystical."</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen was sensing more and more how formidable the power of Shadow Dao was. As a Great Dao, it clearly had its flaws, but that was only because Wang Nuan had yet to be born, so for now, it was hard to properly contain it. On the other hand, the advantages of Shadow Dao were even more apparent â€” it could enhance a person's shadow and turn it into combat strength, catching the enemy unaware in battle and dealing them damage.</p>

    <p>"I have a hunch that our enemy is very powerful," Er Ha said as they advanced. From memory, Wang Ling had never given every single one of them buffs before a mission.</p>

    <p>This proved that Wang Ling felt that the enemy this time could be very troublesome.</p>

    <p>"I know." Wang Zhen nodded solemnly.</p>

    <p>The mastermind behind the scenes had so far brought numerous dead people back to life. Some were savage Dark Network criminals and some were spectres and evil spirits that caused mischief in the dark. Moreover, Wang Ling's side currently had too little knowledge on the other party.</p>

    <p>The ability to bring people back to life certainly couldn't be the other side's only ability.</p>

    <p>"If the other side also has Shadow Dao, what kind of ability would it be?" Wang Zhen abruptly raised a question that was worth thinking about.</p>

    <p>"We won't know until we see it for ourselves." Xiao Yin and Er Ha were also worried.</p>

    <p>Since the enemy was an unknown quantity, they had no idea what would happen later.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Zhen said, "I have a theory."</p>

    <p>"Let's hear it," said Er Ha.</p>

    <p>"Bringing the dead back to life goes against the law of nature. There has to be a price for casting forbidden magic like this. Given how many people have been resurrected, it doesn't make sense that the other party hasn't paid any sort of price."</p>

    <p>"That's true."</p>

    <p>"But to put it another way, if the other side really is fine, then there is another possibility." Wang Zhen furrowed his brow. "This person might not be from the same dimension, or even from the same universe."</p>

    <p>But Wang Zhen in fact also felt that there was a problem with this explanation.</p>

    <p>Because if this person behind the scenes was from a different universe, why hadn't Gu Shunzhi, as the keeper of cosmic order, sensed it?</p>
