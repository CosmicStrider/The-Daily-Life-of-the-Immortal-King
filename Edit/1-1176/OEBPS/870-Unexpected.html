  <h1>Chapter 870 Unexpected</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Defeated, Gu Shunzhi fell to his knees as if his soul had fled his body.</p>

    <p>He had thoroughly lost this battle.</p>

    <p>The Cosmic God Tree was his ultimate trump card. As the most powerful summoning he had, Gu Shunzhi never thought that in the end, he wouldn't even be able to handle a mere toilet gremlin.</p>

    <p>He had been utterly defeated by the youngster before him.</p>

    <p>He was outclassed in all respects...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling drew close and patted Gu Shunzhi on the shoulder.</p>

    <p>Honestly speaking, Wang Ling didn't expect the Cosmic God Tree to be lured away by Lord Ma. He still had other tricks up his sleeve when he summoned Lord Ma, because even though Lord Ma had been enlightened again, the fact was that he still wasn't as strong overall as the Cosmic God Tree.</p>

    <p>It was such an unexpected outcome in the end.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, Wang Ling had to say that Gu Shunzhi had done a good job.</p>

    <p>Pushing his serious clone to this point wasn't something an ordinary person could have done.</p>

    <p>It could only be said, as expected of the keeper of order recognized by three universes.</p>

    <p>He was really something!</p>

    <p>But on second thought, Wang Ling felt it wasn't good to push Gu Shunzhi too hard.</p>

    <p>As a keeper of order who safeguarded cosmic order, he shouldn't be stressed!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was worried that this defeat would be a huge blow to Gu Shunzhi.</p>

    <p>So, looking at Gu Shunzhi whose soul seemed to have fled his body, Wang Ling decided to give him a small reward as consolation.</p>

    <p>After all, Gu Shunzhi wasn't a bad guy, and was the most powerful keeper of order in the ten universes.</p>

    <p>He got nothing out of maintaining cosmic order, plus it was hard work!</p>

    <p>At that very moment, Gu Shunzhi had fallen to his knees on the ground, supporting himself on his hands and his face full of unhappiness. He had expected the battle to at least end in a draw, and didn't think he would lose so terribly.</p>

    <p>When the boy's hand landed on his shoulder, Gu Shunzhi felt his entire soul lifted up.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Ling saw that Gu Shunzhi's eyes were a little excited.</p>

    <p>This was followed by Gu Shunzhi gripping his hand firmly, his eyes full of curiosity. "Can you tell me... why are you so strong..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at Gu Shunzhi and was silent.</p>

    <p>He wanted to know as well!</p>

    <p>Too bad even he himself didn't know why he was so strong...</p>

    <p>He hadn't even known that he had mastered the thirty thousand Great Dao of the ten universes until yesterday!</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi's heart was very tired, and so was Wang Ling's...</p>

    <p>He stared at the blue sky, the dome of Heavenly Dao space a vast ocean of stars...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling heaved a deep sigh, turned, and directly vanished.</p>

    <p>But before that, he left Gu Shunzhi a reward as encouragement.</p>

    <p>It was a crispy noodle snack packet which had been enchanted...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling promptly departed the instant he left this crispy noodle snack behind because he was worried he would regret his decision and take it back.</p>

    <p>Picking up the crispy noodle snack from the ground with both hands, Gu Shunzhi examined it for a long time, lost in deep thought.</p>

    <p>After seeing Wang Ling leave, the six Heavenly Dao came over and surrounded Gu Shunzhi at that moment.</p>

    <p>Strength Heavenly Dao: "Friend Gu... if we may be so bold as to ask..."</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi looked up. "???"</p>

    <p>Strength Heavenly Dao: "Would it be possible for you to give us the noodles in your hand..."</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi realized then that the noodles which the senior had given him wasn't an ordinary thing.</p>

    <p>Not if it could make the Heavenly Dao fall all over themselves for it.</p>

    <p>Actually, the Heavenly Dao had a lot of crispy noodle snacks, but it was this packet in Gu Shunzhi's hand which they had to have no matter what!</p>

    <p>Because the noodles they had weren't regular ones, but were all expired...</p>

    <p>They were nothing like the enchanted version in Gu Shunzhi's hands!</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi: "I'm very sorry. This is something senior gave me, and I'm not going to give it up."</p>

    <p>The six Great Heavenly Dao sighed. They had expected this answer, but still couldn't help feeling a little disappointed.</p>

    <p>Strength Heavenly Dao: "Then could Friend Gu please agree to another request..."</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi: "???"</p>

    <p>Strength Heavenly Dao said in deadly earnest, "I want to lick Friend Gu's hand... You touched His Excellency Ling's hand with it, didn't you?"</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi was alarmed.</p>

    <p>He promptly fled Heavenly Dao space with the crispy noodle snacks.</p>

    <p>He never expected the six Great Heavenly Dao of the seventh universe to actually be a bunch of madmen!</p>

    <p>Strength Heavenly Dao: "Friend Gu! Don't go! Please! Let me lick... No! A sniff will do!"</p>

    <p>Time Heavenly Dao: "Hey... No need to be reserved now! We should have pushed him down and directly licked him just now!"</p>

    <p>Life And Death Heavenly Dao: "Remember, no waffling next time! Act right away!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the way back, Gu Shunzhi ate the packet of crispy noodle snacks.</p>

    <p>As a result...</p>

    <p>From that moment on, there was another man in the universe...</p>

    <p>Obsessed with crispy noodle snacks.</p>

    <p>Even after this man returned to his own time, he was punished by his own father for pilfering the crispy noodle snacks left on the altar...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, the game of tag between Lord Ma and the Cosmic God Tree continued...</p>

    <p>The Cosmic God Tree had taken on human form and was running happily around Lord Ma's world. She was the typical image of a female tree spirit, her entire body brimming with cosmic divinity. She wore a golden robe and had golden hair, and even the ornament she wore in her long hair was decorated with dark golden leaves that looked beautiful.</p>

    <p>But such a beautiful maiden was at that moment running around madly and merrily in Lord Ma's world, stepping on golden...</p>

    <p>Perhaps for many people, this stuff was incredibly disgusting.</p>

    <p>However, for the Cosmic God Tree, this was fertilizer that was hard to come by.</p>

    <p>Lord Ma had his spiritual awareness take on human form inside his inner world and he said to the Cosmic God Tree, "Miss... Please leave, you shouldn't be here..."</p>

    <p>Miss Yu <sup>1</sup> stretched out her branches to absorb the rich fertilizer on the ground. "I haven't eaten my fill for so long! Your place is simply heaven! Only a fool would leave!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(From "yu zhou," the word for "universe..")</dfn>

    <p>"Miss, this filthy place... is unbefitting of your status as a cosmic god tree..." Lord Ma patiently tried to persuade her.</p>

    <p>"Tch! I don't want to be some god tree... People want to live, so do trees! I'm helping you dispose of this filth, you should be thanking me!" As she spoke, Miss Yu sent out her branches again and stuck them deep into the ground.</p>

    <p>Lord Ma blushed. He had never been entered so deeply before, and trembled even as he spoke. "Miss Yu, you... don't..." He had never had such a beautiful girl suck him dry before.</p>

    <p>Miss Yu paid no attention to his advice, and the branches of the Cosmic God Tree took deep root in Lord Ma's inner world, gulping up the nutrients.</p>

    <p>"You..." Lord Ma clenched his teeth.</p>

    <p>"You men are all pig's feet. You should be feeling good, right?"</p>

    <p>"Ah... no! I can't... Miss Yu, stop!"</p>

    <p>Miss Yu sucked up a few more mouthfuls, then hiccuped, perfectly satisfied after a full meal.</p>

    <p>Her golden branches shone even brighter!</p>
