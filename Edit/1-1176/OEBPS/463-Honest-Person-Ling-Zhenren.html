  <h1>Chapter 463 Honest Person Ling Zhenren </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was July 12th on Wednesday in the twelfth week of the semester.</p>

    <p>In the morning, Er Ha stuck the inheritance talisman on its forehead and squatted outside the front door to gather the spirit of heaven and earth as well as absorb the power of Sword Dao that was in the inheritance talisman. This spiritual qi was at its purest at sunrise, and was very conducive to cultivation.</p>

    <p>At the moment, Er Ha had only mastered about five percent of the contents of the inheritance talisman... but it felt that it was already stronger than before!</p>

    <p>After all, this was the power of Sword Dao of the Three Thousand Great Spells. To be able to inherit even just a fraction of it meant infinite power...</p>

    <p>After the inheritance talisman had been stuck on for a while, Er Ha felt that its head was almost full to bursting and swollen a little painfully. This was to be expected since the profound truth of this great spell was filling its mind.</p>

    <p>Er Ha stretched up to remove the inheritance talisman with its dog paw.</p>

    <p>When this happened, it wasn't good to continue receiving the inheritance. It needed to take some time to rest and allow the profound truth of the great spell to be fully absorbed before continuing... Er Ha was well aware that this couldn't be rushed and needed to be slowly refined and absorbed a bit at a time.</p>

    <p>Some people could go their whole lives without ever comprehending the power of great spells. Now that Er Ha could master one such spell merely by using an inheritance talisman, it felt that it had nothing to complain about.</p>

    <p>There was a balance to everything. Although Er Ha wouldn't be able to digest it for a while, it was just a matter of time.</p>

    <p>Looking at the sky, Er Ha recalled its prophetic dream. It didn't know what would happen to the Tuntian Ha clan in the future, but Elder Wen's call for help had been real.</p>

    <p>Usually, the events of a prophetic dream would definitely happen within a month, which was coming to an end soon. Er Ha was suddenly worried about the future of the Tuntian Ha clan. Although its body had changed, its identity as the tenth generation leader would never change.</p>

    <p>In the eyes of many clansmen, it was already dead. But it hadn't actually died, and given that the Sky-Swallowing clan was still without a leader, it felt that the clan was its responsibility.</p>

    <p>Er Ha held out one light green dog paw, and sharp, white fingernails slid out between its claws, covered in a faint golden spirit light. This was the special effect of the Sword Dao aura on its claws, but it was clearly far from enough; it had only inherited five percent of "the ten-meter sword circle" which was Evil Sword God's Sword Dao attribute. If it really wanted to exhibit the ten-meter sword circle effect, it had to comprehend at least fifty percent of Sword Dao.</p>

    <p>Er Ha roughly guessed that at its current comprehension progress, it would take at least half a month to inherit half of the power of Sword Dao in the inheritance talisman.</p>

    <p>It didn't know if it could catch up in time to respond to the catastrophe facing the toad clan in its prophetic dream...</p>

    <p>Er Ha had its own considerations on this matter. It had thought before that if the worst case scenario happened, it would just ask Little Master Ling for help.</p>

    <p>But the problem was that Little Master Ling would be facing his midterm exams right away! How would he have time to worry about this type of pesky little incident...</p>

    <p>In the end, Er Ha didn't ask Little Master Ling for help after thinking about it for quite a while. It thought it would be best if it could handle this matter properly itself.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>During preparations for the midterm exams, the school teachers set papers like crazy, as if they had been injected with chicken blood.</p>

    <p>The PE teachers who were supposed to be the best of the lot suddenly turned weak and sickly. All the teachers who occupied the PE class slots gave the same reason: <em>Your PE teacher is ill!</em></p>

    <p>So this morning, Teacher Pan was already in the classroom, sitting in front of the dais in a grave manner and marking the test papers from yesterday's Dao talismans class.</p>

    <p>Now was a critical period. Chen Chao and Guo Hao were usually the earliest to arrive at school.</p>

    <p>One characteristic which these two people had in common was that they tended to overdo one particular thing: one was good at arts while the other one was good at science. Furthermore, they were actually at the top level in class in these respective areas.</p>

    <p>Therefore, it had become their daily routine to come to school early and take what they needed by copying each other's homework.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't know where Teacher Pan had heard about this. The reason she was in class early that day was to prevent delinquent behavior such as some opportunistic students coming to school early to copy homework in the morning.</p>

    <p>So Chen Chao and Guo Hao were flabbergasted when they entered the classroom that morning...</p>

    <p>Shit?!</p>

    <p>Why was Old Pan so early today?</p>

    <p>The two people stood at the door to the classroom with extreme alarm in their hearts.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan was grading the test papers with the air of a worldly elder.</p>

    <p>It could only be said that Teacher Pan was in the end Teacher Pan, a pioneer teacher at Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>She was well aware of any schemes that the students harbored in their hearts.</p>

    <p>Like the students who had just entered the classroom; with their darting eyes and their unnatural movements, they were obviously behaving very abnormally!</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan immediately judged that the reason for their surprised expressions was either they hadn't done their homework, or they had decided to come to class in the morning to copy each other's homework, only to find her in the classroom.</p>

    <p>Sometimes she could tell what the students were thinking with just one look.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan cast sidelong glances at Chen Chao and Guo Hao as she feigned marking the papers with an unperturbed attitude. Her eyes were like target auto-locks that saw through cheats, which made the two boys shudder a little. "Su Xiao doesn't need to collect the homework today; I'll collect them myself. You two, please hurry up and put them on the dais."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "..."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "..."</p>

    <p>The two people couldn't help shouting in their hearts in unison:<em>Motherfucker...</em></p>

    <p>It was still so damn early in the morning!</p>

    <p>Four o'clock!</p>

    <p>Even if a teacher-in-charge wanted to use the morning self-study period, they still wouldn't come to the classroom until seven o'clock!</p>

    <p>Chen Chao and Guo Hao immediately felt that Teacher Pan was a little insane...</p>

    <p>Which teacher-in-charge would come to school to mark homework at four o'clock?!</p>

    <p>A teacher's salary was calculated according to how many classes they had. Working early until late was part and parcel of the job, and there was no overtime pay at all.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Chen Chao and Guo Hao felt that there was absolutely no need to doubt Old Pan's dedication to her work.</p>

    <p>Now that she was in the classroom staring at them, there was no way for them to copy homework.</p>

    <p>Neither of the two students said a word. They went back to their respective seats and began to finish up their homework.</p>

    <p>Looking at this scene, Teacher Pan didn't say anything and continued marking homework as if she hadn't seen anything.</p>

    <p>She had seen too many of all kinds of students, including those who used all types of methods to cheat in exams.</p>

    <p>Now was the era of national cultivation, and this was the critical juncture in particular before the midterm exams. As a Golden Core teacher, she could go without sleep for more than ten days without feeling tired. Forget the fact it was four o'clock in the morning; she never got off work and was at school the entire time as she had to watch these students closely and have them improve their performance as much as possible before the midterm exams!</p>

    <p>After all, they were young and playful, and sometimes pretty cheeky...</p>

    <p>She had to keep an eye on them.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Teacher Pan suddenly thought of someone.</p>

    <p>She thought that Wang Ling was really pretty good; his grades might be straight down the middle, but in any case, he was an honest person!</p>
