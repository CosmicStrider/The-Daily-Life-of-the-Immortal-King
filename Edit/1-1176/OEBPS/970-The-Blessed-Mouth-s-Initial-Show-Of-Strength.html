  <h1>Chapter 970 The Blessed Mouth's Initial Show Of Strength</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Liang Heng received another video, but this time it came with a very official-looking notification.</p>

    <p>The notification read:</p>

    <p><em>Dear user, thank you for placing an order with the curse service once again. The curse this time was: Moderate Curse. Because it was blocked, the curse wasn't completed. According to curse service regulations, we do not give refunds in the event that the curse is blocked during the process, except for when a natural disaster such as an earthquake or tsunami occurs in the spellcaster's vicinity.</em></p>

    <p>Liang Heng: "..."</p>

    <p>That was a little unfair!</p>

    <p>Liang Heng clicked open the latest video and realized that it was very short, even shorter than what was uploaded onto Bilibili, the biggest dove farm in the world <sup>1</sup> . Most importantly, freaking opening and end credits had been added to pad the video's length...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>("Dove" is used to refer to those who are very slow to update.)</dfn>

    <p>In the video, Father Chen attended to Chen Chao and then took Chen Chao to the children's hospital on his back, but the video abruptly cut off after they arrived at the hospital, and was replaced with white noise.</p>

    <p>"Someone interfered with the curse?" Liang Heng checked the program notification again and again.</p>

    <p>He had inadvertently obtained this curse program from Zhe Ge, and his first try had been a resounding success - how had the other party become aware of it?</p>

    <p>Was it possible that an expert had lent a hand?</p>

    <p>Liang Heng thought of this possibility.</p>

    <p>At that moment, the program beeped.</p>

    <p>It was a second notification from the curse program, which read: "Since the person who dispelled the curse is so powerful, we recommend that you use the high-level curses and curse package!"</p>

    <p>Liang Heng: "..."</p>

    <p>"Dear, are you getting a card <sup>2</sup> ? Top it up with ten years of your life to be a member and enjoy a twenty percent discount."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Adapted from a line in the
second season of the Chinese
drama "Greeting Your
Imperial Highness .. ")</dfn>

    <p>Liang Heng: "Ten years for just twenty percent..."</p>

    <p>"This special deal is for junior members; dear, you can consider a top up of fifty years. That's for the highest level diamond members! You can enjoy a fifty percent discount! And it comes with a special curse service, which can make you play basketball forever like a certain someone..."</p>

    <p>This was too malicious...</p>

    <p>The system notification might not have directly mentioned a name, but Liang Heng could already guess who it referred to.</p>

    <p>Putting that aside, this malicious special service was truly alarming.</p>

    <p>Not just anyone could endure the loss of fifty years of their life in one go.</p>

    <p>He had previously calculated how long he could live for, which was until two hundred years old. Factoring in the years he had used up for the curse program, he only had over one hundred years left.</p>

    <p>The first curse had used one year of his life, which had tired him out. The second had used five years, and he had grown a lot of white hair overnight... These were all stress responses to his lifespan being sucked out.</p>

    <p>The loss of fifty years of his life in one go would probably make him unable to move.</p>

    <p>He was worried.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, he recalled the more wicked method he had thought of previously, and that was to have his own students help out.</p>

    <p>After all, they didn't know about the curse program.</p>

    <p>He just need to trick them into clicking the mouse.</p>

    <p>Crowdfunding the years of one's life!</p>

    <p>Liang Heng had decided on his next move.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, Chen Chao was bored by the life of seclusion at the temple. He didn't even know why he had to go into seclusion there - when he woke up, he was already in the monastery.</p>

    <p>After the curse had been dispelled by the blessing, his memories before and after the fever had been affected, which could lead to memory loss.</p>

    <p>Master Jin Deng had already spoken to Father Chen about this.</p>

    <p>Although there might be some memory loss, it was harmless to the body.</p>

    <p>But Chen Chao still wanted to know exactly what had happened last night.</p>

    <p>Xiaoling's mom told him that he had come down with a very high fever, but didn't give any details at all, which aggrieved him.</p>

    <p>Suddenly taking him to the monastery, without a single thing on him... Even if he could devote all his energy to cultivating during the day, without e-books, games, or WIFI at night, he felt like dying!</p>

    <p>Could a modern person live without WIFI?!</p>

    <p>Next to him, Wang Xiaoling also didn't say anything. Chen Chao knew that she had a rough understanding of what was going on, but the problem was that she couldn't speak and couldn't even understand all her letters yet - it would probably be impossible for her to write it down.</p>

    <p>Then, at that moment, Chen Chao thought of a way: Draw Something!</p>

    <p>If she couldn't write, she should still be able to draw, right?</p>

    <p>And so, Chen Chao found paper and brush, and after finding an open space in the backyard, he started to play this game with Wang Xiaoling.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao said to Xiaoling, "Xiaoling, let's play Draw Something. You draw what happened yesterday. If I guess right, nod your head, and if I guess wrong, you can shake it."</p>

    <p>She nodded her head.</p>

    <p>She drew a few pictures in a row and numbered them.</p>

    <p>The first picture was Balance Magic Center's logo; she wanted to tell Chen Chao that everything was caused by a curse cast by the chief of Balance Magic Center.</p>

    <p>She hadn't known about this at first, but Father Chen had told her mom the whole story last night in order to persuade her to come to the temple, and on the side, Xiaoling had also heard it.</p>

    <p>The second picture was of fire; she wanted to tell Chen Chao that he had gotten a fever last night.</p>

    <p>The third was of the hospital's "cross" - Xiaoling even added "120" next to it to refer to the hospital.</p>

    <p>In the fourth picture, Xiaoling had drawn a baldy with a red glove smashing a human skull to pieces. The skull represented the curse, and the baldy referred to Master Jin Deng who had blessed Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>Such clear composition and the logical train of thought in the drawings instantly dumbfounded Chen Chao, who had never expected Xiaoling to actually be so talented at drawing.</p>

    <p>The fourth picture looked just like Saitama-sensei fighting Overlord!</p>

    <p>After that, the drawings were done.</p>

    <p>Wang Xiaoling put down the brush and relaxed. Actually, she was quite confident in her drawing skills. Since she couldn't speak, she often spent her time at the junkyard polishing up her drawing skills with old brushes that had been thrown away. However, she wasn't sure if Chen Chao would understand them or not.</p>

    <p>Staring at the four drawings, Chen Chao praised Wang Xiaoling for a long time before he burst out laughing. "Hahaha! Xiaoling, I can't believe you're so good at drawing. With your four drawings, I completely understand what happened!</p>

    <p>"Your first and second drawings tell me that Balance Magic Center caught fire! My dad dialed 120!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"The reason for the fire was because Balance Magic Center was hiding a weapon of mass destruction! But that Chief Liang absolutely refused to admit it."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Finally, who knows for what reason, a senior monk from this monastery destroyed the weapon with one punch!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>As soon as Chen Chao said the words.</p>

    <p>In the distance where Balance Magic Center was.</p>

    <p>With a boom.</p>

    <p>A mushroom cloud rose on the horizon.</p>
