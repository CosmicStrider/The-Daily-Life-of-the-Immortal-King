  <h1>Chapter 374 Sorrowful Xiao Yin<sup>0</sup> </h1>

  <dfn><sup>0</sup>('Xiao Yin' translates to 'Little Silver.')</dfn>

  <div>

    <p>As Guo Hao said, the Society of Saints really wasn't a place just anyone could get into.</p>

    <p>Logically speaking, there was no way that Zhuo Yi, as Director of the General Administration of 100 Schools as well as a judicial officer of Songhai city, could be unaware of it. If the Society of Saints made any move, he would probably be the first person in Songhai city to hear of it.</p>

    <p>However, this Society of Saints didn't do things the normal way. The entire organization's existence had from the start in fact been classified as a state secret; it was under the direct administration of the Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools, and had already been running out of a small place for a period of time before it had gone public in the last two days. Zhuo Yi had only received this information when the Society of Saints ad had appeared on TV.</p>

    <p>Of course, the most exciting thing about this Society of Saints was probably the purported recommendation for university admission; as long as you were extraordinarily talented and could rank high enough in the Society of Saints, you could enter any university you wanted without needing to be at the Golden Core stage... for example, Seven Stars Sect's overall cut-off score for admission was two hundred thousand, and a lot of people could never hope to enter this sacred university in their lifetimes.</p>

    <p>But if someone could enter the Society of Saints, then anything was possible.</p>

    <p>Hence the question now was: how to find out whether you were talented enough to catch the eye of the Society of Saints. This was a matter worth thinking about.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw an online post where someone had specifically dug up information on the student who had appeared in the Society of Saints ad, Chu Yuanhao.</p>

    <p>Jiancai High School was well-known in related circles as a high school built through investments from rich second generation Lin Xiaocong's father Lin Sicong. Actually, this Chu Yuanhao had a direct connection to Lin Xiaocong. He had initially just been Lin Xiaocong's follower, but a while ago, when the other boy had been cornered by several upperclassmen outside, Chu Yuanhao's potential had exploded.</p>

    <p>According to that post, several individuals dressed in black had then dropped out of the sky and directly taken Chu Yuanhao away...</p>

    <p>These men in black were part of Society of Saints' cadre, which was dispersed all over the country; they were in charge of specially selecting students with gifts. The person who had put up this post surmised that the men in black had probably been following Lin Xiaocong, and in the end had accidentally chanced upon a bonus find in Chu Yuanhao.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling purely assumed the attitude of a bystander in this matter.</p>

    <p>Whether it was the outside world's favorable view of the Society of Saints or how many people wanted to join it, it was none of Wang Ling's business.</p>

    <p>At the moment, his main priority was to deal with the district sports meet and the midterm exams, as well as the fact that he was about to be down twenty packets of crispy noodle snacks... everything else other than that was nothing to him.</p>

    <p>How powerful the Society of Saints was had nothing to do with him.</p>

    <p>Hopefully they wouldn't seek him out.</p>

    <p>However, he thought that the probability of the Society of Saints finding him was pretty low; his grades in Number 60 High School were consistently average, why would they notice him?</p>

    <p>Thinking about this, Wang Ling simply pushed the issue to the back of his mind.</p>

    <p>Revision, revision! This was far more important than the Society of Saints!</p>

    <p>He had to get an average score in the exams... he couldn't do too well, otherwise Father Wang would chastise him, but he couldn't do too poorly either, otherwise Teacher Pan would call his parents.</p>

    <p>That was why Wang Ling thought that the person who could truly manage average grades every single time was the real big boss.</p>

    <p>However, he had barely opened his textbook when he received a text message from Lord Diulei. "Brother Ling... I have something to tell you..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling replied with a question mark. "?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "That... we might have to give the holy beast blood to you a day late."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was about to ask why when Lord Diulei sent another text: "Today I prepared a basin for Xiao Yin, and when he was getting ready to draw blood, he said something about how it had to be done under the midday sun, so he went outside with the basin and knife to do it."</p>

    <p>Seeing this, Wang Ling could already guess what had happened. "..."</p>

    <p>Sure enough, he read the latter half of the text: "Then, the neighbors saw Xiao Yin cut his wrist and bleed himself... he's still being watched in custody, and the police are currently counseling him."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Seven o'clock at night, Anning District Cultivation Police Station, Songhai city.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was in front of a police officer; his right wrist had already been disinfected and bound up in a simple wrap.</p>

    <p>When he had been discovered 'cutting his wrist,' half the basin had already been filled with his holy beast blood... but in the end the police officer had tossed it without a second thought. When he recalled the scenario from back then, Xiao Yin still felt a deep ache in his balls.</p>

    <p>Thankfully holy beasts didn't rely on the liver to produce blood, otherwise he would have been dead exhausted.</p>

    <p>"Name."</p>

    <p>"Xiao Yin."</p>

    <p>"I'm asking for your real name..."</p>

    <p>"I'm Xiao Yin." The young man took out his ID card, which Lord Diulei had personally taken him to get done not long ago</p>

    <p>"Does it still hurt?" the police little brother responsible for taking notes asked with concern.</p>

    <p>This little brother had been a psychiatrist before, so he would typically be put in charge of cases of attempted suicide such as this. In fact, taking notes was secondary; the most critical was psychological counseling. He had to coax these young people who had attempted suicide to open their hearts and feel the warmth of the world!</p>

    <p>"No..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin replied in a low voice and looked a little disgustedly at the bandage wrapped around his wrist.</p>

    <p>If he wanted to, he could completely heal this small cut in a few seconds. In order to not give himself away, he had deactivated his healing factor on the way to the police station as he watched the police officer dress his wound, and there had still been quite a bit of blood...</p>

    <p>"When can I leave?" Xiao Yin looked up and blinked luminous eyes at the police officer as he asked his question.</p>

    <p>But the police little brother didn't buy it at all. "Playing cute is useless; you have to clearly explain why you wanted to kill yourself."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin muttered under his breath with resentment on his face. "Wasn't it because of those twenty packets of crispy noodle snacks..."</p>

    <p>The police little brother almost threw his pen aside when he heard this. "What did you say?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "Er... I mean, it was because I didn't get the card I wanted inside these twenty packets of crispy noodle snacks, so..."</p>

    <p>The police little brother continued to be shocked. "Just because of this, you decided to kill yourself?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "Otherwise...?"</p>

    <p>The police little brother: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>About an hour later, Lord Diulei arrived at the police station.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Hello, I'm here to post bail..."</p>

    <p>The police officer at the reception desk smiled. "Who are you posting bail for? Name, please."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Xiao Yin."</p>

    <p>"Oh, that young man who looks like he's of mixed blood. He was indeed here earlier because he had attempted suicide," said the police officer.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "And now?"</p>

    <p>The police officer: "You can check the psychiatric department in Second Hospital's isolation zone."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>
