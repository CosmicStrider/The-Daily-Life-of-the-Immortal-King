  <h1>Chapter 229 I Want You! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Afterwards, Wang Ling teleported Wang Ming and the others to a warehouse in the central district that was currently empty. It also happened to be a pretty good location right in the center of the toxic fog circle.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao also regained consciousness after suffering the pain of Wang Ming's Ten Subduing Dragon Slaps <sup>1</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is adapted from the
fictional Eighteen Subduing
Dragon Palms martial arts
technique)</dfn>

    <p>After being slapped heavily, both his cheeks had red handprints on them.</p>

    <p>"You're awake?" Wang Ming swung his arm around. Those slaps had hurt!</p>

    <p>For every action there was an equal and opposite reaction. Slapping a Foundation Establishment body was far more painful than slapping an ordinary person...</p>

    <p>"Second... second brother?" Chen Chao noticed his drool on the ground, and it seemed like there were still traces of it on Wang Ming's shoulder, so he hurriedly jumped to his feet. "Sorry, second brother... when the military training is over, give me your clothes and I'll wash them for you."</p>

    <p>"Forget it, it's just clothes." Wang Ming waved his hand magnanimously.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao had utterly no memory of what had happened before he had fainted. He only remembered that he had had a very happy dream of participating in the Olympic Games for the glory of his country! This was his lifelong dream...</p>

    <p>But why had he suddenly fallen asleep halfway through the military training, and had had such a pleasant dream?</p>

    <p>Chen Chao scratched his head in distress and didn't quite get it.</p>

    <p>In fact, this was one of the effects of Wang Ling's Great Purification Spell. Apart from clearing the body of poison, it could also clear away distracting thoughts.</p>

    <p>When a person wasn't distracted by their thoughts, they would naturally sleep very well.</p>

    <p>Sometimes at home, when Father Wang had revised his manuscript to the point of becoming fed-up, he would get Wang Ling to cast the Great Purification Spell on him to ensure that he got sufficient quality of sleep.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming looked at Chen Chao's puzzled expression and offered an excuse which he had prepared beforehand: "We fell into a trap set up by a group of people just now, you were hit by a fog that made you dizzy, and you fainted. The incident has already been resolved."</p>

    <p>"Oh, I see!" Chen Chao suddenly understood.</p>

    <p>" Woof ! â€”" There was the sound of a bark.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao spun around and looked down; only then did he notice Er Ha. "Er Ha? Why are you here?"</p>

    <p>"We counterattacked while you were unconscious, and Er Ha did great work!" Wang Ming said as he rubbed Er Ha's soft dog head.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao was so excited that he hugged Er Ha and kissed him. "Er Ha, you're so cool!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Now that he had come to his senses, Chen Chao suddenly realized there was a problem.</p>

    <p>It was only then that he noticed that Classmate Wang Ling was gone!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After placing Wang Ming and the others in a relatively safe location, Wang Ling started moving on his own; he would be completely unable to act freely if there were other people around.</p>

    <p>The matter with the Gate Between Worlds seemed to be over, but the villain behind it had not yet surfaced.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had actually already pretty much guessed who that person was. He could count on his fingers the number of people who had the means to summon the Gate Between Worlds to this small world.</p>

    <p>He had seen for himself the devil spirit which the old devil had summoned while fighting with that young man from Immortal Mansion. This old devil had so many tricks up his sleeves; he definitely had to have more than one devil spirit that he had subdued. It was a very real possibility that he could sacrifice a bunch of devil spirits to convert them into demon energy to use as a source for operating the Gate Between Worlds.</p>

    <p>Hence, the key for Wang Ling now was to find the old devil's location.</p>

    <p>However, that devil's aura was hidden too well...</p>

    <p>On one hand, Wang Ling had to make sure the students in the small world weren't aware of what was going on. On the other hand, he also had to avoid alerting those headmasters and seniors in the conference room in the outside world. This was going to be very difficult to do.</p>

    <p>Additionally, he had already decided.</p>

    <p>When he found the old devil, he would use a method similar to "boiling a frog" which would kill the old devil slowly yet soundlessly and without creating a stir... although Wang Ming had already blocked his signal earlier, he wasn't sure if he truly wouldn't be noticed by the people in the conference room.</p>

    <p>As expected, the royal way to deal with this type of crafty devil was to make him suffer a slow death!</p>

    <p>After making this decision, Wang Ling turned around and walked out of the dark alley.</p>

    <p>But he had only taken a few steps when he abruptly stopped after sensing a gaze on his back.</p>

    <p>Who?</p>

    <p>He felt a little surprised since he had already confirmed earlier that there wasn't anyone nearby!</p>

    <p>"Not bad, not bad, you have very highly-attuned senses, far more outstanding than most of the students here."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling turned his head slightly. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw an elder with a white hedgehog head <sup>2</sup> gradually manifest a dozen meters away behind him. The light talisman wound around the elder's body like a snake slowly faded the moment the elder showed himself, floating away on the currents in the air...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This just means he has spiky hair.)</dfn>

    <p>This person had actually wrapped himself in the nomological powers of this little world, and had completely melded with its aura!</p>

    <p>In such a situation, no one should be able to sense him at all using ordinary means of spiritual perception.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling immediately sighed in his heart. He had miscalculated!</p>

    <p>"Do you know who I am?" The elder with the hedgehog head smiled at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He was dressed in white exercise clothes with a red sash tied around his waist, and they fluttered gently in the breeze, giving a strong impression of a great master.</p>

    <p>As for his identity, when Wang Ling saw the huge "Yi" character on the right side of this elder's chest, he already had no energy to ridicule it.</p>

    <p>He really wanted to ask this elder: Are you from the Turtle Hermit School or the Crane Hermit School <sup>3</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(This is a reference to martial
arts schools in Dragonball;
their uniforms tend to bear
the school names in large
characters ..)</dfn>

    <p>But given this person's identity, he didn't ask the question in the end.</p>

    <p>Then, the scene fell into silence.</p>

    <p>A moment later, it was still the elder with the hedgehog head who ended up speaking first and breaking the quiet. "I felt the aura of the Gate Between Worlds in the small world earlier, but when I came here, the aura had suddenly disappeared."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Although I'm not clear on what's going on, I feel that the person that I, this old man, am looking for should still be in this world. So this old man has been observing events in this small world in secret... and it wasn't long before I noticed you. Looking at your school uniform, you should be... a student from Number 60 High School?"</p>

    <p>The elder narrowed his eyes slightly, and his pupils churned oddly as he stared at Wang Ling. "Your realm doesn't just stop at the Foundation Establishment stage, does it?"</p>

    <p>When the elder said this, Wang Ling felt his scalp turn numb. He really had been too careless! He completely hadn't expected the legendary General Yi to show up here!</p>

    <p>Was he going to be exposed?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was silent as he chose not to reply.</p>

    <p>"You can't hide it from me..."</p>

    <p>Noticing this, the elder stared at Wang Ling with a smile. "You're actually at the Golden Core stage, aren't you?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Noticing that Wang Ling wasn't saying anything, the elder was even more certain that he had guessed right. "You're only in Senior Grade One but you've already reached the Golden Core stage; your future prospects are truly incalculable."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>The elder smiled. "I think you're pretty good. How about it? Do you want to be my disciple? I want you!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Were old seniors nowadays all this blunt?</p>
