  <h1>Chapter 242 Those Enlightened Big Shots </h1>

  <div>

    <p>If Dharmaraja hadn't seen it with his own eyes, he definitely wouldn't have expected that apart from these three seniors, there would still be so many big shots hidden in this villa! That little girl with pink meatball-shaped hair buns and wearing a gray jacket was simply terrifying. When she moved, she was like a flash of light — even Ultraman Tiga wouldn't have been able to keep up!</p>

    <p>And then there were those two brawny men next to her. One man wore a straw hat while the other wore a suit of armor. They were thick and solid all over. They stood like mighty mountains, emanating an overwhelming sense of oppression.</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja pulled his neck back as his eyes fell on the old man next to him. "Old Senior Wang... may I ask, who are these three seniors?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, you mean them." The old man scratched his head. "These things were transformed and enlightened by Ling Ling. The one with the straw hat was originally an eraser and the one in armor was originally a pen. As for that little girl, she was originally a freight tricycle. Lei Lei painted and waxed her the other day."</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja was stupefied. "..."</p>

    <p>So there was this kind of operation?</p>

    <p>No wonder this little girl had been holding a tire in her hand the whole time...</p>

    <p>While Dharmaraja was speaking with Grandfather Wang, Sheep had already dragged that man from Immortal Mansion to the villa's front door. After Jingke had sealed his spirit acupuncture points, he was even more ordinary than an ordinary person now; apart from the fact that he was a little bigger in size, there was nothing special about him at all. He might not even be able to beat a middle-aged woman at the Body Tempering stage like Mother Wang.</p>

    <p>When the man was dragged through the door, he opened his mouth and struggled to speak, making inarticulate noises which confused Dharmaraja. "His spirit acupuncture points have been sealed, but why can't he even speak?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, I also just sealed his tongue," Eraser answered. "The interrogation should be left to Senior Lord Diulei since we're just amateurs."</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja was surprised once again. "You called Senior Immortal over?"</p>

    <p>"That's right, Little Master Ling had told us before that Senior Lord Diulei was investigating Immortal Mansion. He had expected that Immortal Mansion that bunch of impatient people would come here looking for trouble, so he had already let us know earlier on. Once we encountered someone from Immortal Mansion, we were to capture them on the spot and then help Lord Diulei with his investigation."</p>

    <p>"I see..."</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja nodded his head, and in his heart, his respect for Wang Ling grew even more. That was just like Ling Zhenren; he had even anticipated that this would happen! As expected, his foresight was godly!</p>

    <p>"Oh, that's right, apart from that, did Senior Immortal say anything else?" After Dharmaraja calmed down, he was all smiles; he felt that Senior Immortal would praise him for coming here this time to deliver the sword personally!</p>

    <p>Eraser fell silent again; initially, he had planned not to say anything, because he knew that Lord Diulei had just been joking earlier. However, now that it had come to this point, Eraser in the end still decided to clarify the issue with Dharmaraja.</p>

    <p>After thinking for a while, Eraser opened his mouth and said bluntly, "Senior Lord Diulei said that you should leave the group. To be hit by backlash from an aura before even lifting a finger to fight is too embarrassing."</p>

    <p>As a large, big-hearted fellow, he was just forthright like that.</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja's cheeks streamed with tears. "..." Did Senior Immortal hate him now?!</p>

    <p>After Eraser spoke, Sheep, who had been sitting on the Immortal Mansion man like he was a horse, gave Dharmaraja a strange look.</p>

    <p>It seemed like she had heard the sound of something shattering...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Later, there were hissing sounds of stir-frying from the kitchen — Grandfather Wang and Mother Wang were cooking. Knowing that Lord Diulei would be coming, the old man stewed the broccoli from the last time the man had visited to make a soup.</p>

    <p>There were quite a few people sitting around in the living room of the Wang family's small villa. Pen and Eraser had initially planned to return to their original forms after completing their task, but it couldn't be considered completely done until Lord Diulei took over. So before that happened, they remained in their human forms.</p>

    <p>The old man had never treated these "goblins" enlightened by Wang Ling as outsiders, so he warmly invited them to have lunch together.</p>

    <p>As a result, the atmosphere in the Wang family's living room was very lively at noon.</p>

    <p>Eraser, Pen, Sheep and Dharmaraja were playing The Werewolves of Millers Hollow card game while Sheep sat on the bound Immortal Mansion man as if he was a living cushion.</p>

    <p>"Apart from the three of you, there should be other seniors that were enlightened by Ling Zhenren in this villa, right?" Looking at the hand he was holding, Dharmaraja took advantage of their idle card-playing to softly ask his question.</p>

    <p>"We don't dare call ourselves seniors, we're just Little Master Ling's transformed goblins. We can't cultivate, so our realms are totally up to our Lord. Lord Dharmaraja, you got to your level step by step by your own efforts, so you're the great senior."</p>

    <p>Eraser laughed and said humbly, "Of course, we three certainly aren't the only ones in this villa that have been enlightened, but apart from us, very few of the others can take human form. The rest are just Lord Pen Immortal and Lord Ma."</p>

    <p>"These two are...?" Lightning Dharmaraja asked.</p>

    <p>"Their abilities are actually a little different. Lord Pen Immortal can draw circles to take people anywhere, but it has to be a known and existing place in the world. On the other hand, the spaces which Lord Ma connects to are all perilous and could even be alternate dimensions. Once you get sucked into one, you might never come back," Eraser explained.</p>

    <p>Hearing that, Dharmaraja's world view was refreshed.</p>

    <p>Ling Zhenren was actually so formidable to the extent that even the magical treasures he had randomly enlightened all had such powerful abilities.</p>

    <p>"I have another question..."</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja took a deep breath. He felt like he was about to broach some sensitive topic, but he couldn't hold back his inner desire for gossip. "Do you know Lord Jingke's origin?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, you mean Lord Jingke? I thought Senior Dharmaraja was going to ask something strange..." Eraser laughed.</p>

    <p>Jingke's origin wasn't actually a secret anymore. When Lord Diulei had come to the Wang family's small villa back then, Grandfather Wang had succinctly explained Jingke's origin in less than ten seconds.</p>

    <p>"It was Little Master Ling's father who bought Lord Jingke from the flower and bird market," Eraser answered concisely.</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja: "...Is that all?"</p>

    <p>"Yes... that's all."</p>

    <p>Eraser nodded as he said, "In addition, it was at a bargain price!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja badly needed to calm down.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After a while, Mother Wang and Grandfather Wang had finished preparing lunch. Looking at the time, Dharmaraja expected that Senior Immortal would be arriving at the villa soon.</p>

    <p>He looked up the stairs. "Should we call Lord Pen Immortal and Lord Ma down to eat?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, that's not necessary." Eraser shook his head. "The problem with Lord Pen Immortal is that he's addicted to sleeping, so it's best not to disturb him."</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja: "Then... how about Lord Ma?"</p>

    <p>Hearing that, Pen, Eraser and Sheep had slightly horrified expressions on their faces. "Senior Dharmaraja, do you actually want to eat with a toilet <sup>1</sup> ?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>('Toilet' is 'ma tong' in Chinese, hence the name Lord Ma..)</dfn>

    <p>Dharmaraja: "..."</p>
