  <h1>Chapter 797 Wanted: Wang Zhen</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This was a completely unforeseen turn of events for Wang Zhen, and far outside of his expectations. He never thought that there would actually come a day when he would be listed as a wanted person by the Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>Heavenly punishment precisely struck the top of his head in warning. It didn't want to kill him, so apart from blowing his hair up into an afro, it didn't affect him anywhere else.</p>

    <p>But what Wang Zhen could be sure of was that if he continued to approach Wang Ling after the Heavenly Dao had listed him as a wanted person, the lightning of heavenly punishment would continue to rain down on him, and each strike would be more powerful than the last.</p>

    <p>Thus, after realizing this fact, Wang Zhen's first reaction was to retreat.</p>

    <p>He already had no other choice.</p>

    <p>Now that he was prohibited from using the power of Heavenly Dao, his overall battle strength was severely reduced. If he were to fight Bai Zhe now, it might end in a tie, or he might even be at a disadvantage... if he continued to get hurt in this state, it would really kill him!</p>

    <p>When Wang Zhen saw Wang Ling's aura approach him, he yelled almost hysterically at the little shop, "You, you... don't come over!!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen was horrified when he realized that he actually couldn't withstand Wang Ling's aura.</p>

    <p>With the loss of his power of Heavenly Dao, the sense of oppression from the other party was almost several - no, tens of times heavier!</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling, who had no idea what on earth happened to Wang Zhen, only wanted to go check on his condition.</p>

    <p>Who knew that just as he approached Wang Zhen, the latter started screaming in fear like he had seen a ghost.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling opened the door, Wang Zhen had both his hands clasped to his cheeks, and he even looked like he had turned into that world-famous painting "The Scream."</p>

    <p>Screaming, Wang Zhen could only push off the ground as he started to backpedal frantically, but that push didn't create much of a distance. Then, Wang Ling saw Wang Zhen fall down on his face with a cry in the distance... He was so frightened by the oppression of Wang Ling's aura that his body had actually turned soft, so he could only fly halfway up into the air before he lost his strength and fell directly back down...</p>

    <p>Boss Tan's younger brother Tan Qian and Lord Diulei were both petrified at this scene. "What happened?"</p>

    <p>Tan Qian looked into the distance. "What the heck, why is this boss acting like he's seen a ghost?"</p>

    <p>Chin in hand, Lord Diulei seemed to have some idea about what had happened. "Sure enough, bringing Brother Ling here was the right decision. He who never wrongs others does not fear that the ghosts will come knocking. Brother Ling and this boss have never met, but for the man to actually be this scared, he was definitely up to no good. Looks like there really is something wrong with this Tusheng Technology!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was speechless. "..."</p>

    <p>Huh? He really didn't know anything!!</p>

    <p>God only knew why this man attacked him at first glance.</p>

    <p>And kept going on about him being a thief.</p>

    <p>It was obvious in his aggressive manner earlier that he had been ready to attack Wang Ling with Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>But in the end, this person had fled the battlefield in the blink of an eye; not only had he directly lost his mind, he even looked at Wang Ling like he was seeing a ghost.</p>

    <p>And so Wang Ling stopped moving. Standing in place as he observed for a moment, he saw the man push away the gravel and soil with all his strength as he struggled very hard to pull himself out of the ground, like a drowned salted fish. His face was white as a sheet, and his expression was extremely malevolent.</p>

    <p>Anyone would think he was possessed.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, this man doesn't look well. Is he ill? Should we go and check on him?" Lord Diulei asked.</p>

    <p>He had overlooked this possible situation earlier. If there wasn't anything wrong with this boss, it was possible that he had an illness to begin with, and it had unfortunately flared up just as negotiations were about to happen... That was one possibility.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling pursed his lips.</p>

    <p>He had too many questions to ask Wang Zhen.</p>

    <p>But as soon as he took a step in Wang Zhen's direction, Wang Zhen immediately started to scream in fear like before. "De- devil!! Stay back! I - I surrender!" It was clear that his voice was wobbling in his throat as he yelled in alarm.</p>

    <p>Undeterred, Wang Ling took another step forward.</p>

    <p>Then, he saw Wang Zhen's eyes directly roll up in his head as his entire being stopped moving.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei slowly walked over to check Wang Zhen's condition.</p>

    <p>He was still breathing...</p>

    <p>But he had already passed out from the fear...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, the six Great Heavenly Dao were also watching this scene in their alternate dimension.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen had already passed out, so the lightning of godly punishment had naturally stopped since Wang Zhen was now already no longer a threat to Wang Ling. Also, it was very obvious that Wang Zhen had been properly punished. Even if his power of Heavenly Dao would be restored to him in seven days, he would think it over carefully before attacking Wang Ling again.</p>

    <p>Strength Heavenly Dao sighed. "If he knew it would come to this, he shouldn't have done anything in the first place."</p>

    <p>Life And Death Heavenly Dao said placatingly, "He can't be blamed for all of this. After all, apart from the ancestors of Dao Founder, no one else knows about the rule for white list clients."</p>

    <p>"That's right."</p>

    <p>Space Heavenly Dao nodded. "Hence, I don't think this is a bad thing. It's good for Wang Zhen to learn about this earlier on. After all, that person's identity is very special... It would be better for Wang Zhen to recognize friend from foe now and let go of his former enmity and resentment. In the end, everything he has achieved so far is due to his ancestors. Unfortunately, while the Wang family has been emulating His Eminence Dao Ancestor all these years, none of them have ever been able to surpass him. The era of His Eminence Dao Ancestor has finally passed..."</p>

    <p>"Not necessarily."</p>

    <p>Spirit Heavenly Dao had a different view. "When all is said and done, Ling's existence is a variable. He is the person who can change the situation of the entire Wang family... Otherwise, His Eminence Dao Ancestor wouldn't have paid such a steep price for this back then..."</p>

    <p>Soul Heavenly Dao: "They've been fighting each other all this time in the world below. Why didn't His Eminence Dao Ancestor make this matter clear from the start, or at least leave behind some information? The misunderstanding has now grown bigger and bigger. If it cannot be redeemed in the end, then what..."</p>

    <p>Time Heavenly Dao: "The mysteries of heaven cannot be revealed - there are some things that can only be grasped intuitively and not conveyed in words. If His Eminence Dao Ancestor were to make everything clear, then it would be meaningless to test the descendants of the Wang family... It's easy to obtain Dao, but it's difficult to comprehend. No one can take the Three Thousand Great Dao with them except for Dao itself..."</p>

    <p>After Time Heavenly Dao said this, all the Heavenly Dao were lost in deep thought.</p>

    <p>They thought of Dao Ancestor Wang's hopeful face when he had laid out this chessboard back then. He had always firmly believed that the descendants of the Wang family would be able to fight fate and calamity.</p>

    <p>As Time Heavenly Dao had said, obtaining Dao was easy, but comprehending Dao was difficult...</p>

    <p>There were times when letting go of an obsession wasn't necessarily a bad thing.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, who knew when Wang Zhen, as the eldest son of the Wang family, would be able to understand this reasoning.</p>

    <p><em>You, Master, are in the end the master...</em></p>
