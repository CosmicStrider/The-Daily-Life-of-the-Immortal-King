  <h1>Chapter 888 If You Have a Problem You Can't Solve, Look for Wang Ling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Porcelaino...</p>

    <p>When he heard this name, Immortal Toya wanted to ridicule it but couldn't. It was the same with that Silky Web Heroine just now - it was the first time Immortal Toya had seen a spider-woman produce spider silk with her butt. Was this the poor taste of modern heroes nowadays?</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya wasn't familiar with Mixiu's hero cultivators, and had only heard of a few names which were famous in the International Alliance of Cultivators.</p>

    <p>Each country had a different cultivation philosophy, but generally speaking, cultivators would fight hard for assignments from the Alliance of Cultivators in their respective countries to help maintain order as well as make a name for themselves. There were plenty of cases where cultivators gradually gained status and fame throughout the land through these tasks.</p>

    <p>Of course, there were also exceptions...</p>

    <p>Such as Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>This Great Death-Courting Senior had never actively volunteered for an assignment, but freeloaded off them and managed to gain widespread fame.</p>

    <p>Because it was an era of peace, modern cultivators paid more attention to reputation and status, and Mixiu's hero cultivators were no exception. Of course, there was another important reason, which was if they assisted Mixiu Alliance in completing this assignment, there would be a massive bonus; the heroes were depending on it.</p>

    <p>After all, everyone had to eat.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya took a deep breath and felt out the activity around him.</p>

    <p>Many powerful auras were gathering on the frontline of battle within a radius of three thousand li, and a dozen or so of Mixiu's hero cultivators were on their way over.</p>

    <p>Some were strong, some were weak. The weak ones coming to the battlefield would undoubtedly just feed Devil Gut Fungus Lord.</p>

    <p>"There's not much time left..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya sighed.</p>

    <p>He was aware that he had to settle this fight as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>Because there actually wasn't much time left.</p>

    <p>He had six minutes at most before those hero cultivators arrived on the frontline. He had to settle this fight by then before things got messy.</p>

    <p>"Stranger..." At that moment, the SS-Class hero Porcelaino strolled over in the air.</p>

    <p>With each step he took, a blue and white porcelain flower bloomed under his feet, and he gave off an amazing and imposing air.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya already had a general understanding of what Porcelaino was capable of.</p>

    <p>He had the ability to crush things.</p>

    <p>Anything that got close to Porcelaino would instantly turn into brittle porcelain which was then shattered by his aura.</p>

    <p>This was an extremely advanced Assimilation of Matter Spell, but it also had a fatal flaw: if you were just a little careless, you would also be assimilated yourself. It could only be said that Porcelaino was indeed worthy of being an SS-Class hero; he had broken away from the danger of being assimilated and refined this spell into a passive skill which he wielded.</p>

    <p>Based on what Immortal Toya knew, a lot of thought had gone into refining this skill.</p>

    <p>The only pity was that Porcelaino was still a bachelor even in his old age.</p>

    <p>No one wanted to go to sleep with their wife in their arms, only to have her turned into blue and white porcelain the next day...</p>

    <p>"Mr Porcelaino, do you have any suggestions?" Time was running out, so Immortal Toya didn't want to say much.</p>

    <p>"Since you're from out of town, you just need to watch... This fight was never yours to begin with." Porcelaino sneered. "For this type of fiend, my ability is simply his antithesis.</p>

    <p>"Just watch, stranger! I'll carry you to victory!"</p>

    <p>With that, Porcelaino leapt up and charged straight at the insect army.</p>

    <p>His Assimilation of Matter Spell had become a passive skill; as long as he could reach the center of the battlefield and touch Devil Gut Fungus Lord, it would be his win!</p>

    <p>Want to get close?</p>

    <p>Devil Gut Fungus Lord was quick to respond.</p>

    <p>This was a dangerous old man.</p>

    <p>The countless insect soldiers up ahead had been turned into fragile blue and white porcelain; it looked like it would be hard to hold him off.</p>

    <p>Full of confidence, Porcelaino kept marching forward.</p>

    <p>Devil Gut Fungus Lord frowned slightly.</p>

    <p>He increased the number of Immortal Bugs again. This time, he no longer wrapped them in water, but actually gave them the power of fire. The sky was filled with the Immortal Bugs combusting into little fireballs which struck Porcelaino.</p>

    <p>At first, Porcelaino didn't understand the reason for this move.</p>

    <p>But as the temperature increased, he sensed something was wrong.</p>

    <p>The blue and white porcelain on his body was actually being baked bit by bit under such high temperatures... His Assimilation of Matter Spell was the most affected by fiery heat.</p>

    <p>"Ah!" Porcelaino was then surrounded by these burning Immortal Bugs, and he cried out in pain.</p>

    <p>"We have to save him!"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya knew Porcelaino had already failed.</p>

    <p>But in this situation, he also didn't dare get close.</p>

    <p>It wasn't Devil Gut Fungus Lord's burning Immortal Bugs that he was afraid of, but Porcelaino... What if he also turned into porcelain after rushing over?</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya never thought that "pengci <sup>1</sup> " this social epidemic would actually take on this type of meaning on the cultivator's battlefield.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Literally translates to "touch porcelain..")</dfn>

    <p>No... there had to be a way...</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya took a deep breath.</p>

    <p>Previously, he had learned a trick from Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>On several occasions, when Lord Diulei was almost at the end of his rope, he would take out his strongest skill.</p>

    <p>And Immortal Toya was now in a tight spot.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, if you had a problem you couldn't solve, look for Ling Zhenren!</p>

    <p>"Zhenren? Senior Ling Zhenren?"</p>

    <p>At that moment, Immortal Toya raised his head and tentatively called out to the sky twice.</p>

    <p>But the sky was as empty as anything, and there wasn't the slightest response at all...</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya didn't buy it.</p>

    <p>Everyone knew that what the mensao Ling Zhenren liked to do most was to lurk.</p>

    <p>Although he usually wasn't good at speaking and seldom said anything in the chat group, everyone had profoundly experienced Ling Zhenren being a mensao!</p>

    <p>"Senior Ling Zhenren?"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya shouted again.</p>

    <p>Actually, Immortal Toya was still a little timid even when he yelled. After all, he didn't have as close a relationship with Ling Zhenren as Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>The other side might not necessarily heed his wishful thinking.</p>

    <p>And most importantly, because they weren't close, Ling Zhenren might not have bothered to observe him on the battlefield.</p>

    <p>So after thinking about it, Immortal Toya decided to add a bonus. "Ling Zhenren? If you help me, I promise that from this moment on, I'll join the Crispy Noodle Snacks Sect! I'll eat crispy noodle snacks with you every day!"</p>

    <p>As soon as he said that...</p>

    <p>A space opened in the air.</p>

    <p>Right after that, a bottle fell into Immortal Toya's hands.</p>

    <p>This was a bottle of 84 Disinfectant which Wang Ling had personally enchanted.</p>
