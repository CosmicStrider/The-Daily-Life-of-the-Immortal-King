  <h1>Chapter 876 Wutian Golden Buddha Palm</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Eat the exercise book, learn a level seven spell... This was probably an exchange no one could have ever imagined.</p>

    <p>In fact, Lord Diulei felt that eating the exercise book would be a real pity.</p>

    <p>Because Wang Ling's writing was too beautiful!</p>

    <p>This was the first time he had seen Wang Ling's writing and it was a whole book of it. For people with OCD, these golden letters were a blessing - except for the title, every character and every rune was roughly the same size; no matter how complex the strokes were, they were all perfectly square.</p>

    <p>Anyone who received this type of exercise book wouldn't be able to help hoarding it. Even just opening it and smelling the ink was enough to make you feel very, very close to Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>Such a pity...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei looked at the exercise book and sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p>He couldn't bring himself to do it, but he had to.</p>

    <p>Because it was indeed as Wang Ling had thought - Lord Diulei currently didn't have anything he could use as a signature spell.</p>

    <p>In the past, although he liked to court death, his approach in most situations was "if I cannot defeat the other party, I'll just throw a Skybomb Grenade and run away"...</p>

    <p>But this Wutian Golden Buddha Palm move just so happened to make up for his shortcomings.</p>

    <p>Then, Lord Diulei directed his Brilliant Victory sword onward to Chrysanthemum Island.</p>

    <p>Finally, he grit his teeth and ruthlessly began to tear up the pages of the exercise book before shoving them into his mouth one by one.</p>

    <p>To Lord Diulei's extreme surprise!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had actually added flavor to the exercise book!</p>

    <p>This freaking exercise book actually had a taste... And it was a black pepper flavor that Lord Diulei was very familiar with...</p>

    <p>It seemed that Brother Ling might have added crispy noodle snack seasoning to the ink of the runes?</p>

    <p>Chewing the pages of the exercise book, Lord Diulei smacked his lips... unexpectedly, the exercise book tasted pretty good...</p>

    <p>No one could possibly imagine that a cultivator could casually finish learning a level seven spell while flying on his sword, and to do so at such a hair-raising speed.</p>

    <p>In a game, it wasn't that easy to learn a skill manual!</p>

    <p>Then...</p>

    <p>After Lord Diulei finished eating the exercise book -</p>

    <p>For one moment, golden spiritual essence flooded his six hollow organs.</p>

    <p>He closed his eyes, and actually realized that a magnificent golden Buddha palace now resided in his dantian.</p>

    <p>Was this... the power of the Wutian Golden Buddha Palm...</p>

    <p>Sensing the power of this level seven spell, Lord Diulei was indescribably shaken.</p>

    <p>He was still flying midair on his sword, but his terrifying aura alarmed all nearby cultivators.</p>

    <p>Whether they were driving their cars or flying on their swords in the air, or passing by on the ground, every cultivator in that moment rolled down their windows, halted in their steps, or slowed down to simultaneously extend their spiritual senses in the direction of that brimming aura - passersby were amazed to see a golden meteor streak across the sky...</p>

    <p>Some rubbed their eyes.</p>

    <p>Because the golden meteor felt like Buddha...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, the situation on Chrysanthemum Island was now completely under Devil Gut Fungus Lord's control after his surprise attack.</p>

    <p>He never expected to actually be so compatible with Immortal Toya's body, and his plan had gone off without a hitch... As a bacterium, he didn't have an aura, which was why his surprise attack had been especially successful.</p>

    <p>Now, after several hours of settling down, he had completely fused with this body.</p>

    <p>He had even completely suppressed the soul of the host.</p>

    <p>Jin Shi and Yin Shi, these two sibling apprentices, were facing the biggest crisis since the founding of Chrysanthemum Island...</p>

    <p>"The two of you, decoct the medicine," Devil Gut Fungus Lord snapped at Jin Shi and Yin Shi.</p>

    <p>One of Jin Shi's eyes was already swollen because he had resisted earlier, which had been in vain.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, this Devil Gut Fungus Lord was threatening them with the body of their beloved <em>shifu </em>.</p>

    <p>If they didn't listen to him, Devil Gut Fungus Lord would slice off Immortal Toya's flesh piece by piece. As a bacterium, he didn't feel pain, which instead would directly affect Immortal Toya's soul.</p>

    <p>Of course, Jin Shi and Yin Shi weren't the most miserable people on the island.</p>

    <p>Because Devil Gut Fungus Lord still needed the siblings to refine medicine on his behalf.</p>

    <p>The most miserable people were Li Hao and his father...</p>

    <p>Li Diao hadn't recovered from his condition yet, and had become Devil Gut Fungus Lord's test subject.</p>

    <p>Devil Gut Fungus Lord had Jin Shi and Yin Shi change the prescription, and made Li Hao and his father eat countless laxatives...</p>

    <p>"What exactly is your purpose..." At that moment, Li Hao and his father were squatting in the backyard as they did their business in the vegetable field.</p>

    <p>Devil Gut Fungus Lord even went so far as to not allow them to use the toilet - they weren't even allowed to use a squat toilet, and had to directly do their business in the vegetable field...</p>

    <p>Li Diao couldn't speak at all. He had already been suffering diarrhea for several days before this; now, he had already collapsed in the middle of the vegetable field, completely unconscious. The only part of his body still functioning was his constantly working intestines...</p>

    <p>Staring at the father and son, Devil Gut Fungus Lord smiled. "Since I've decided to make my debut, I have to nurture loyal underlings of my own. Humans aren't unreliable and have many flaws: you are impeded in battle for all sorts of reasons - you aren't qualified to be called soldiers. Bacteria soldiers, on the other hand, are different, as we're a bunch that don't have emotions."</p>

    <p>Li Hao: "..."</p>

    <p>"The bacteria troops are breeding in your digestive system as we speak, so you need to continue excreting them for me to select worthy bacteria soldiers."</p>

    <p>Saying this, Devil Gut Fungus Lord looked proudly at his masterpiece.</p>

    <p>There were already thousands upon thousands of eligible soldiers in this vegetable field alone.</p>

    <p>Devil Gut Fungus Lord then generated a purple and black spirit energy which he pushed into the bacteria. They were activated and turned into egg-like things.</p>

    <p>Li Hao's trypophobia was about to flare up</p>

    <p>Because these egg-like things were quivering constantly, as if something was about to hatch and come out...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Lord Diulei had reached the front line of Chrysanthemum Island in a hurry.</p>

    <p>If he hadn't seen it with his own eyes, there was no way Lord Diulei would believe that Chrysanthemum Island could become like this...</p>

    <p>All the chrysanthemums on the whole of Chrysanthemum Island had wilted...</p>

    <p>This was very powerful demonic qi.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, it wasn't from a demon or a devil at all...</p>

    <p>Now that he was a True Venerated, Lord Diulei was able to clearly discern auras!</p>

    <p>It seemed that the guy on the island didn't have a simple identity...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was already prepared to fight.</p>

    <p>"For now, let's test the situation first," he thought.</p>

    <p>The next moment, he raised his hand and swung it down toward the island, and a golden Buddha seal emerged from his palm...</p>
