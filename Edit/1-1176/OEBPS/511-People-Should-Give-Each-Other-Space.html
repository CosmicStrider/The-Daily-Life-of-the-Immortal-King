  <h1>Chapter 511 People Should Give Each Other Space! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling directly teleported home. He had locked his bedroom door in case Mother Wang suddenly came in and discovered he wasn't there. As long as he locked the door, Mother Wang usually wouldn't try coming in again after turning the doorknob and finding that the door wouldn't open. In her eyes, Wang Ling had always been a conscientious person; a locked door must mean that he was studying and didn't want to be interrupted.</p>

    <p>So when Wang Ling returned home, he felt a little guilty; he had gone to Lord Diulei's place at noon, and it was now already half past three. He had played one game round with his family's Er Ha and then dealt with the matter of Mr Lu, which had resulted in him coming home later than he had expected.</p>

    <p>He gave a sigh as he suddenly felt mentally tired.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, all of this was happening in the middle of the midterm exams, making him feel a little overwhelmed.</p>

    <p>His forehead dropped heavily into his hand.</p>

    <p>He...</p>

    <p>...was just a sixteen-year-old kid!</p>

    <p>Life was really too difficult!</p>

    <p>At that moment, he swept his gaze over the garden. This Er Ha had returned home before him and was now basking in the sun and wagging its tail as if nothing had happened. Although they were quite far apart, Wang Ling could still see that Er Ha's green fur was standing a little on end.</p>

    <p>It was obvious that this thing one hundred percent knew that Wang Ling was staring at it, so it was a little nervous.</p>

    <p>After all, it had done something shameful behind Wang Ling's back today.</p>

    <p>So while it looked composed now, Er Ha was in fact panicking like an old dog...</p>

    <p>Everyone had secrets, and naturally so did spirit beasts. Wang Ling actually didn't want to restrict Er Ha too much. Now that it was already a member of the family, there was no harm in giving it more space. So in terms of dealing with this matter, Wang Ling understood and respected Er Ha's decision.</p>

    <p>Since Er Ha wanted to deal with the matter inside the Gate Between Worlds itself, then just let it handle the problem.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling could pretend he didn't know, but he couldn't turn a blind eye to it; it would be very easy for him to secretly give Er Ha a helping hand.</p>

    <p>That was right; when it came to family, everyone should give each other some space.</p>

    <p>There were some things you could see through but not point out; giving other people space was also a way of showing them respect.</p>

    <p>This was the best way Wang Ling could come up with to help Er Ha, since he could both support Er Ha and also give it face.</p>

    <p>At this thought, he sat down at his table again and pretended that he didn't know anything. He turned around and snapped his fingers, and the bedroom door unlocked with a click.</p>

    <p>Now that he was back, there was no need to lock the door.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling opened his drawer and took out Three Five once more as he decided to do three more test papers to assuage his guilt from today.</p>

    <p>But just as he flipped open the stack of papers, he couldn't help sneezing.</p>

    <p>This definitely wasn't a cold. Wang Ling basically couldn't get sick; any virus that invaded his body would be instantly killed by his primordial qi. As a result, his immune system was in hibernation mode all year round and was never used at all.</p>

    <p>How could he sneeze?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought this was a little strange. Looking around, his sharp senses picked out several strands of very fine green dog fur on the table.</p>

    <p>They had probably been stirred up when he had flipped open Three Five.</p>

    <p>Previously, Wang Ling had allowed Er Ha to lie on the table and watch him do his homework so that it could study. The dog fur had probably been left behind then.</p>

    <p>But he clearly remembered that Er Ha had never shed before...</p>

    <p>Maybe it had been cultivating so diligently recently that the stress was causing it to drop fur.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling suddenly felt a little sorry for Er Ha — the fact that it was starting to lose fur showed the immense effort it had been putting into cultivating recently. Given its current class, if it continued to cultivate this way, this akita might wind up becoming a Chinese crested dog...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling picked up this green fur between two fingers and narrowed his eyes as he looked at it. He grabbed a tissue from his drawer to wrap the fur in before throwing it away, but in doing so, a few strands slipped from his grasp onto his thigh.</p>

    <p>Furrowing his brow, he grabbed another tissue to clean up the dog fur on his thigh.</p>

    <p>It never ever occurred to him that Mother Wang would suddenly open the door and come in at this time...</p>

    <p>When she entered, she happened to see Wang Ling holding a tissue in one hand while the other was wiping at his thigh in a suspicious manner...</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling turned his head, a startled expression on his face.</p>

    <p>"Ling Ling..." Mother Wang didn't finish speaking. She just said his name before swallowing whatever she wanted to say.</p>

    <p>It could only be said that Mother Wang was Mother Wang, a senior who had already been around the block; what great storms and waves hadn't she weathered?</p>

    <p>Adolescent urges were nothing strange to her.</p>

    <p>Then, Wang Ling watched as Mother Wang smiled at him slightly before slowly closing the door.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Slamming the door shut at this time was a big no-no; loud sounds would easily frighten a person and could result in a disruption of physical functions.</p>

    <p>Mother Wang thought that she was very open-minded.</p>

    <p>Family members should give each other some space.</p>

    <p>"Ling Ling has grown up..." Standing in front of the door, Mother Wang felt a little gratified.</p>

    <p>She remembered that Wang Ling had been preparing for his midterm exams lately; it would be normal for him to feel stressed.</p>

    <p>Young people... it would be better for them to release their stress.</p>

    <p>At that very moment, Wang Ling was clenching a wad of tissue in his hand as he felt like slamming his head against the door.</p>

    <p>If he had known, he would have used the Gravitation Spell to pick up the dog fur!</p>

    <p>What kind of misunderstanding was this...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's lips twitched uncontrollably.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, there were small things in life where the use of magic wasn't necessary. However, Wang Ling had never thought that Mother Wang would come in at that particular moment; it was a really big misunderstanding this time. But this also showed that the effect of the Great Fortune Spell had probably already worn off, otherwise there was no way this misunderstanding could have happened.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that he was a pretty adaptable person — since the misunderstanding had already happened, there was no need to go on and explain it.</p>

    <p>Because that would just be adding insult to injury!</p>

    <p>He grit his teeth, picked up his pen and started to furiously do his Three Five!</p>

    <p>Roughly half an hour later...</p>

    <p>Mother Wang came by his room again. This time, she didn't directly enter, and instead knocked on the door.</p>

    <p>She guessed that Wang Ling should have finished his business by now.</p>

    <p>"Ling Ling?" She didn't dare directly open the door and enter, in case she saw another R18 scene, and simply spoke outside the door. "Your brother's coming by tonight. I'm making fish stew with kidneys... eat up later! Also, you need to do things in moderation, understand?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
