  <h1>Chapter 609 Operation Error!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Demon Saint's address amused Zhenyuan. "'Monster'? What is that? Aren't you a monster yourself?"</p>

    <p>"..." Second Generation Demon Saint realized he actually couldn't refute this.</p>

    <p>Of course, Zhenyuan was only joking. What kind of thing would Demon Saint of the demon world call a monster?</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan was a little curious.</p>

    <p>First of all, it probably wasn't a normal demon beast, spirit beast or devil beast, otherwise Demon Saint wouldn't have especially used the term "monster."</p>

    <p>Furthermore, when this monster was mentioned, the expressions on both Second Generation Demon Saint's and Sage Master Shen Wuyue's faces slightly changed and revealed some trepidation, which pinged Er Ha's curiosity at the same time.</p>

    <p>After all, the two standing here now were the most powerful existences in the demon world. One was the current Demon Saint and the other was Sage Master, the adjutant who served under Demon Saint... It was impossible for an ordinary creature to make them feel dread.</p>

    <p>Second Generation Demon Saint wasn't the strongest, but after merging with the consciousness of the Holy Pillar of the demon world, his strength could be raised from his current True Immortal level to the power of a Venerated Immortal. With the power of the will of a world in hand, there were in fact very few things that could make Demon Saint at this level feel afraid.</p>

    <p>Er Ha stared at Second Generation Demon Saint and Shen Wuyue. "I want to know what kind of thing this monster is."</p>

    <p>"I'm afraid it's very difficult to clearly explain what this monster is with words alone... The reason why I invited Senior Dog and Immortal Zhenyuan up here this time was because I was hoping that both seniors can help tell us what this monster is," Second Generation Demon Saint said.</p>

    <p>"How?" Zhenyuan was a little curious as the corner of his mouth curled up slightly, revealing one canine.</p>

    <p>"We've already killed it..."</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan was abruptly disappointed. "What? It died just like that? Didn't you say it was a monster?"</p>

    <p>At that moment, Second Generation Demon Saint suddenly untied the top part of his Daoist robe, revealing a chest that glittered with scales; they were so bright that they almost blinded Er Ha's dog eyes...</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan hurriedly cover his eyes. "Second Generation Demon Saint, please think twice. I don't have this type of fetish!"</p>

    <p>Second Generation Demon Saint: "Senior, you're mistaken... Please open your eyes and take a look at the wound on my chest. It's from that monster..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan dropped his hands and both he and Er Ha looked at Second Generation Demon Saint's chest. There were actually numerous fierce and terrifying-looking teeth marks on Second Generation Demon Saint's chest and right shoulder! The monster must have had several hundred small teeth at least!</p>

    <p>"How long have you had this wound?" Er Ha asked curiously.</p>

    <p>"It's been half a month; Sage Master and I have tried everything, but we've been unable to heal this wound..."</p>

    <p>"An incurable wound?" Immortal Zhenyuan sucked in a breath of air; if this was the case, then the problem was much more complex and serious than he had thought. True Immortal level was completely different from the other realms because a True Immortal's spirit energy had a very powerful recovery attribute. Generally in a fight, as long as the wound was on the surface, it would heal very quickly.</p>

    <p>Er Ha naturally knew this, too.</p>

    <p>Although there were a lot of magic treasures or magic spells in the world that had a "major damage" effect that could prevent a wound from healing, the point was that the person who had no way of healing this wound was Second Generation Demon Saint!</p>

    <p>Given Second Generation Demon Saint's current realm, Er Ha could only think of two things that could prevent a wound on the former's body from healing.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, as far as Er Ha knew, these were indeed currently the most powerful ways of effectively obstructing rapid recovery.</p>

    <p>The first way was Xiao Yin's phlegm. The other way was Little Master Ling's primordial qi...</p>

    <p>But it was obvious that Demon Saint's wound wasn't caused by Xiao Yin or Little Master Ling.</p>

    <p>Er Ha was suddenly interested. "Where is the monster's body? Take it out and let me have a look."</p>

    <p>It already had its own conjecture, but it didn't dare make any assertions carelessly; whatever it was, it needed to be seen first in order to be believed.</p>

    <p>Actually, Er Ha thought that Zhenyuan had probably already sensed it as well...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Later, Shen Wuyue clapped his hands, and two puppets with very beautiful but very cold bodies carefully carried a crystal tank into the main hall. The tank wasn't very large and its opening was only two meters in diameter, but it weighed ten thousand tons. The top was sealed with a thick membrane layer.</p>

    <p>Half a month ago, after Second Generation Demon Saint and Shen Wuyue killed this "monster," they threw its body into this crystal tank and sealed it.</p>

    <p>"This crystal tank was First Generation Demon Saint's bath. It's made of a very special material. At the time, we searched Demon Saint's Holy Palace but couldn't find a magic treasure more suitable than this crystal tank to store the monster's body in," said Shen Wuyue.</p>

    <p>It had already been half a month, but when he recalled the scene of the monster's appearance, Shen Wuyue still trembled a little with fear.</p>

    <p>They gathered around the crystal tank as Second Generation Demon Saint began to recall what he had experienced half a month ago. "Half a month ago, Sage Master and I noticed an abnormal space rift. I used magic to move this space rift into the holy temple with the intention of mending it, but I never expected a monster to actually jump out of the rift..."</p>

    <p>"How was this monster killed later?" Before seeing the monster's body, Zhenyuan planned to clear up all his questions first.</p>

    <p>"Back then, the monster attacked me and I was already injured. After that, Sage Master and I worked together, but this monster was extremely tough to deal with..." Second Generation Demon Saint said, "In the end, I joined hands with Sage Master to pray and call upon the Holy Pillar to forcibly get rid of it."</p>

    <p>Shen Wuyue also said with a sigh, "Calling on the Holy Pillar to forcibly make a move in fact reduces Lord Demon Saint's lifespan. Furthermore, each Demon Saint can only use this method three times at most."</p>

    <p>Er Ha and Zhenyuan both nodded; man and dog could already guess the implications.</p>

    <p>If this monster was truly as frightening as Second Generation Demon Saint said, both the demon world and the human world should indeed pay attention to this matter since they were now connected by the Gate Between Worlds. If this mysterious abnormal rift which the monster had emerged from could appear in the demon world, then it was possible that it could appear in the human world...</p>

    <p>"Let's take a look at the monster first." Er Ha narrowed its eyes.</p>

    <p>Shen Wuyue nodded, and when he raised his hand, the seal membrane on the outside of the crystal tank was released.</p>

    <p>Er Ha floated up in the air, and along with Zhenyuan, looked inside the tank.</p>

    <p>Inside, they saw a one meter-long black-colored fish with a mouth full of fangs.</p>

    <p>"Is it a catfish?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha was cursing in its heart when it heard Zhenyuan cry out in surprise, "Kun<sup>1</sup>?! What the hell?! What kind of operation error produced this multi-fanged kun?!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A legendary fish which could turn into a roc..)</dfn>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Second Generation Demon Saint: "..."</p>

    <p>Shen Wuyue: "..."</p>
