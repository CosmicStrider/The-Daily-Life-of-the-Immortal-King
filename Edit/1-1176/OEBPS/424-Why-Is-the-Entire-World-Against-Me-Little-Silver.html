  <h1>Chapter 424 Why Is the Entire World Against Me, Xiao Yin... </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Xiao Yin stared at the screen, deep in thought. For some reason, he felt like he had seen this green dog leg somewhere before...</p>

    <p>After the thought floated around inside his brain for a long time, realization finally dawned on Xiao Yin; this dog leg... didn't it belong to Master's dog?!</p>

    <p>Sure enough...</p>

    <p>He had been tricked, right...?</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin felt his holy beast heart sustain a heavy blow. What was meaning... what was love... where on earth was the basic trust between beasts?</p>

    <p>On the sofa, he looked up at the ceiling as his heart gave a roar of despair and the tears streamed down his cheeks.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At that moment, when the door of the villa opened as Lord Diulei returned home, he saw a silver-haired young man with despair all over his face pound the ground as he cried bitterly...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was shocked by the scene. "Brother Xiao Yin, this..." He had just returned from handing out the rings, and hadn't expected to see such a scene.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin looked up, his white face streaked with crystal tears and looking very pitiful. "My... my heart's broken."</p>

    <p>As a matter of fact, not only had he gotten his heart broken - the crucial thing was that he had been tricked!</p>

    <p>But Xiao Yin couldn't mention this no matter what.</p>

    <p>Because he was a holy beast that had actually been fooled by a dog! It would be extremely humiliating if this got out.</p>

    <p>Though he didn't know what had happened, Lord Diulei still went over and patted Xiao Yin on the shoulder in a consoling manner. "Brother Xiao Yin, there's a first time for everything, you have to accept that..."</p>

    <p>When a person was feeling extremely brokenhearted, the more you comforted them, the louder their cries might get. Naturally, Xiao Yin was this sort.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei dropped his hand and was at a bit of a loss. "..." If he had known earlier, he wouldn't have comforted him. When he had entered the house, his tears had still been a drizzle - now it was like a storm!</p>

    <p>Ignoring the crying Xiao Yin, Lord Diulei turned to the bathroom to get a basin which he put in front of Xiao Yin.</p>

    <p>His tears still flowing, Xiao Yin looked at Lord Diulei. "What... what are you doing?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei smiled. "Collecting your tears! Holy beast tears have medicinal value, don't waste them."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>Several seconds later, Xiao Yin sniffed and wailed even harder.</p>

    <p><em>Why is the entire world against me, Xiao Yin...</em></p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ling watched Er Ha tease Xiao Yin the whole time. He could already guess how Xiao Yin must have gone from being ecstatic when he had mistakenly thought that he had added a little sister at the beginning to nearly breaking down and going over the edge, his mood like a rollercoaster going up and down.</p>

    <p>During this span, Wang Ling hadn't been idle.</p>

    <p>He had downloaded the midterm exam papers from last year and the year before from the group files inside the class chat group. This year's topic would definitely be different, and Teacher Pan had already said earlier that it would be a lot more difficult; no teacher would be so foolish as to copy past exam questions without changing them. But even knowing that the exam this year would be harder, it was still worth referring to the exam papers from the last two years.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was now trying to cross out exam topics with over a ninety percent chance of not being tested, and then summarize and collate those whose difficulty level might be increased.</p>

    <p>For example, calculating the composition formula for the flame reaction of the "Angry Buddha Fire Lotus" had been a test item in the Dao talismans course for the last two years, so it definitely wouldn't be tested again this year.</p>

    <p>Or take social studies for example; there had been a situation where, given the lack of a clear-cut classification system for animated shows, a local popular cartoon had been taken down for further investigation after being reported by the public <sup>1</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is a reference to the 'Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf," the most popular cartoon at the time, that had stopped broadcasting in 2013 after public complaints that it was too violent for children ..)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling's intuition told him that this topic would probably be tested this year, and it definitely wouldn't just be a ten-points discussion question; it was very likely that it would be bumped up to a twenty five-points social studies essay question where students would have to write about the topic in one thousand words or less</p>

    <p>That was because something similar had actually happened only just recently. Wang Ling remembered that a few days ago, Guo Hao had told him that one of his favorite horror novels had been pulled from the shelves after being reported; the rumor was that someone in the industry had been jealous of how well it was performing, and had reported it to get it taken off the shelves.</p>

    <p>This was actually a fairly common occurrence in the news, but because other similar incidents dominated the list of popular discussion topics, they were all magnified.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling silently put a mark next to this question, making it an important topic to review.</p>

    <p>Of course, Wang Ling's review wasn't focused on getting higher scores. Instead, by summarizing and collating those topics that might be tested, he could calculate how much harder the questions this year would be. Then he could combine that with the average midterm scores from the last two years and guess what the average for this year would be.</p>

    <p>Average scores were the most important to Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>If he got marks which were too good or too poor... Father Wang would dock his allowance...</p>

    <p>After about five minutes, he was done summarizing and collating the information.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at the time. It was already seven o'clock at night.</p>

    <p>Almost seven hours had passed since Taoist Guang had received the computer.</p>

    <p>The notebook Lord Diulei had bought, which was specially designed for the elderly, could already be considered the type that was very easy and simple to use. It had a built-in tutorial which to Wang Ling was very simple and easy to understand, and also very detailed - but he didn't know how good Taoist Guang was at studying.</p>

    <p>Just as Wang Ling was thinking this, he suddenly felt his wristwatch vibrate.</p>

    <p>It was Lord Diulei, who had sent him a private chat message. "Brother Ling! Are you there? Come quick! Senior Taoist Guang is finally online!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Since it was Lord Diulei who had registered for that chat account, it was tied to another phone number he had, so once Taoist Guang went online, Lord Diulei's phone would immediately receive a text notification.</p>

    <p>After receiving Lord Diulei's private message, Wang Ling opened the three-person private group and found that Taoist Guang's chat profile picture had changed color from grey, proving that the latter was online.</p>

    <p>"Taoist Guang? @Taoist Guang." Lord Diulei tried to @Taoist Guang.</p>

    <p>"I'm here..." It took Taoist Guang three minutes to respond with these two words. It was clear that it had been a pretty tough learning curve for him.</p>

    <p>"Do you find the computer handy?" Lord Diulei sent a grinning emoji.</p>

    <p>Five minutes later, Taoist Guang replied, "Yes... my, typing, is slow..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei couldn't help laughing. "Actually, senior, you can try the voice function."</p>

    <p>Another three minutes later...</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang: "Can't... noisy..."</p>

    <p>Later, Taoist Guang tried uploading the sound. When Lord Diulei heard it, he realized that there seriously was a lot of noise. Only then did he recall that Wang Ling had told him that Taoist Guang's soul space was an island, surrounded by surging tides and the sound of waves breaking along with the rainforest sounds of all kinds of insects and birds.</p>

    <p>But it wasn't impossible to solve this problem. Lord Diulei quickly regained his senses. "How about this, senior... I'll have Brother Ling burn a recording booth for you later!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
