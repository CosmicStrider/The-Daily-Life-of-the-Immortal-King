  <h1>Chapter 983 Wanton Massacre</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Star Lord's face turned deathly white at Wang Ling's sudden appearance. His first reaction was to run as he immediately decided to cut his tail off.</p>

    <p>Cut off the tail to survive...</p>

    <p>To Wang Ling's mild astonishment, this guy's original form was actually a gecko... He had always thought that the Divine Dragons should be a more advanced form of lizard.</p>

    <p>Gripping his tail, Star Lord was so frightened he fell back against the bed. The inner palace guards outside the door heard the noise and instantly charged in. They moved swiftly and in unison, and it was obvious that they had practiced this many times.</p>

    <p>But these guards were also injured from being beaten by Wang Ling previously...</p>

    <p>After dashing through the door, the leader of these Divine Dragons who had yet to clearly make out Wang Ling's appearance shouted, "Outrageous maniac! How dare you break into Star Lord's palace. It looks like you don't want to live... er..."</p>

    <p>His bellowing spluttered to a stop as everyone saw that the person who had appeared in front of Star Lord's bed was Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Then, this group of Divine Dragons took a step back and closed the door. "Sorry to bother you..."</p>

    <p>Star Lord: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Big bro, I've already apologized. What else do you want..." Star Lord wanted to cry but had no tears to shed; he had already thoroughly realized the error of his ways after what happened last time.</p>

    <p>Previously, he did whatever he wanted under the banner of the divine realm's will; it wasn't until he met Wang Ling that he realized that there was always someone stronger.</p>

    <p>The most important thing was that the divine realm had been thrown into chaos, even Thousand-Winged God was helpless when it came to this guy, to say nothing of Star Lord.</p>

    <p>Divine Dao Star had relied on the power of the divine realm all this time to frantically expand throughout space, until Wang Ling's appearance caused him to thoroughly abandon his plan of universal domination.</p>

    <p>"Divine One, why have you dropped by..." When Star Lord spoke this time, it was in Mandarin. Actually, he had always been able to speak Mandarin, and as an alien, his pronunciation was actually very spot-on.</p>

    <p>He was actually very interested in Earth culture; it was just that for the sake of his reputation, he had never expressed it.</p>

    <p>For the sake of establishing friendly ties with Earth this time, Star Lord had been dragged into supplementary lessons while he recuperated. This time, not only did he learn what was required in order to live on Earth, he even learned some advanced subject matter - Thousand-Winged God had him study advanced math, linear algebra, advanced functions, vector space... he couldn't escape any of it.</p>

    <p>It was so... so hard!</p>

    <p>Why would this terrifying planet study such frightening things?!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling gazed at Star Lord's small, deathly white face - a green face could actually turn lime in color. It was clear that the trauma which Wang Ling had inflicted on this Star Lord wasn't small.</p>

    <p>Of course, Wang Ling had come on business this time, and not to deliberately tease Star Lord. He straightaway asked telepathically what he wanted to know. Actually, Wang Ling felt that he might learn more if he went to the divine realm and asked around, but he disliked how high and mighty the Winged Gods were.</p>

    <p>Also, Divine Dao Star was the one planet inspired by the divine realm, and after so many years of expanding throughout space, Star Lord might know quite a fair bit.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling would only deal with those Winged Gods as a last resort. When their wings were spread open, the most was over a thousand wings in number, which was a ghastly sight for someone with trypophobia.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that the author completely hadn't taken the animation team into account when writing this bit back then - it was too hard to draw a thousand-winged angel! This was just asking the illustrator to die!</p>

    <p>Thus, Wang Ling had always imagined that when the time came to animate this bit, the animation team might as well collaborate with KFC on an ad and stick New Orleans roast chicken wings on these Winged Gods, which would be both profitable and cost-effective.</p>

    <p>You could even endorse a few more chicken wing products, like hot wings, finger-licking good chicken and so on.</p>

    <p>Star Lord was stumped by Wang Ling's question. "Divine One, you're asking if there are other types of power apart from Heavenly Dao, Outer Dao and Divine Dao?"</p>

    <p>Star Lord pondered carefully for a while before he replied, "As far as I know, there shouldn't be any..."</p>

    <p>Speaking of this, Star Lord wiped his sweat. Wang Ling had thrashed him with just a few moves back then - in terms of strength alone, can there be anyone in the whole universe clearer on this point than you?</p>

    <p>But since Wang Ling had asked the question sincerely, Star Lord could only answer according to the facts. Furthermore, he came up with his own conjecture. "Of all the supreme powers that currently exist in the universe, apart from Outer Dao, Divine Dao and Heavenly Dao, there indeed is no other power. Even if there was, it most likely wouldn't count as one of the supreme powers. Also, most powers share a common foundation. The reason Outer Dao, Divine Dao and Heavenly Dao are seen as supreme powers is that there is a common link between these three... Therefore..."</p>

    <p>Saying this, Star Lord turned his head to look at Wang Ling, only to unexpectedly discover that the latter wasn't listening and was instead seriously going through the Three Five that Star Lord had done.</p>

    <p>This was homework which Thousand-Winged God had left with Star Lord, and which Wang Ling was marking at the moment.</p>

    <p>"You made quite a lot of mistakes. Work harder." A short moment later, Wang Ling put the marked Three Five at the head of Star Lord's bed.</p>

    <p>Star Lord: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, in the noodle shop, Wang Ming and Guo Ping were waiting for news from Wang Ling. Wang Ling was now still in management mode. His eyes were lifeless and his pupils dim; at first glance, he looked very easy to bully... but neither of them dared offend him so easily.</p>

    <p>"I wonder how things are coming along." Hands clasped behind his back, Guo Ping paced back and forth a little worriedly inside the noodle shop.</p>

    <p>"How is the Divine Eye investigation coming along?" asked Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>After screening, they had already substantially narrowed down the field of investigation, and Wang Ming had a feeling that it was almost time.</p>

    <p>"Let me ask." Just as Guo Ping took out his phone again, it rang.</p>

    <p>It was a series of screams, and so mournful that Guo Ping's hand shook and almost dropped the phone.</p>

    <p>Quickly composing himself, Guo Ping asked, "Hello! This is Guo Ping! What's going on?!"</p>

    <p>The screaming from the research institute made Guo Ping uneasy.</p>

    <p>"Is this Professor Guo Ping?" The voice of a stranger rang out on the other end of the phone.</p>

    <p>Guo Ping knew all the staff in the institute like the back of his hand, and this was clearly the voice of an outsider.</p>

    <p>He frowned. "Who are you?"</p>

    <p>"Professor Guo's plan to determine Student Fang's whereabouts using the Divine Eye was a good one. You guessed right: Student Fang was abducted. However, I'm afraid you can no longer investigate his location." As soon as the stranger on the other end of the phone said the words, several shadow figures broke the glass in the door to Fang Xing's noodle shop!</p>

    <p>"Damn!" Guo Ping was shocked; they were under attack!</p>

    <p>Five Nascent Soul experts in black shadow suits entered the noodle shop. In that split second, Wang Ming pulled Guo Ping back to hide.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming couldn't make out their appearance, since the black shadow suit was a unique type of military-grade Daoist robe that turned into shadow when worn. However, it was extremely expensive to make - there was no way a regular organization could afford such a large shadow army corps.</p>

    <p>More importantly, the black shadow suit was a state secret which was only handed out to cultivation secret service agents to use in secret military affairs.</p>

    <p>But now, all these people were wearing the same suit, which was unimaginable to Wang Ming and Guo Ping.</p>

    <p>The five Nascent Soul cultivators charged into the noodle shop, their intentions clear. The head of the black shadow group ordered, "Go! Kill everyone here and head back for a debriefing!"</p>

    <p>As soon as he said that, one person swung a knife down at Wang Ling in management mode...</p>
