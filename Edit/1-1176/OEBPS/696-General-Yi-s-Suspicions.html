  <h1>Chapter 696 General Yi's Suspicions</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The Demon Hunters Association incident finally came to an end with President Bai blowing himself up, which was the widespread explanation that had been given to city residents. But anyone who was personally involved in this matter all knew that the Demon Hunters Association was just the beginning; before the leader of that foreign power was captured, this matter couldn't be considered over.</p>

    <p>The next day was July 26th, the fourteenth Wednesday of the semester.</p>

    <p>The news that President Bai, the president of the Demon Hunters Association, had blown himself up spread like wildfire online. Under the pressure from Secretary Dakang of the Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools, every major media outlet left out news on Wang Ling and didn't release any student information. It was the Alliance's responsibility to protect student privacy to begin with... Of course, it was Zhuo Yi who had made the request, otherwise things wouldn't have gone so smoothly.</p>

    <p>Early in the morning at Elegant Little Pavilion, General Yi and his assistant Tang Chen were having tea and reading the morning post.</p>

    <p>"The crisis was resolved just like that? Is that student really alright?" Old Tang had some doubts; he felt that there was something fishy about this affair, and there were too many suspicious points for which there were no clear explanations.</p>

    <p>So many things had happened at Number 60 High, and in the end the school had managed to avoid all disaster. Furthermore, that Director Zhuo Yi of Songhai's General Administration of 100 Schools, who was at the height of his fame, had been involved in practically every incident. He was a graduate of Number 60 High who made a name several years ago after somehow killing a demon king. Moreover, he had been shooting up the ladder like a rocket recently, and had already drawn General Yi's eye.</p>

    <p>Putting down the newspaper, General Yi gazed at Old Tang and said, "It appears that you and I share pretty much the same speculation."</p>

    <p>Old Tang nodded. "From my humble point of view, there is definitely someone acting as a driving force behind the scenes, and it's someone with plenty of resources."</p>

    <p>"Dakang has never mentioned this matter. Sure enough... Is what I am most worried about still going to happen?" General Yi heaved a sigh; this was what he dreaded the most!</p>

    <p>In the last few years, the fight against corruption had become increasingly widespread, and practically no one dared commit this crime. If any one of the Ten Generals was corrupt... it would be a heavy blow to Huaxiu nation.</p>

    <p>Old Tang: "Does General Yi suspect..."</p>

    <p>General Yi hurriedly stopped him. "I do, but we can't say anything rash since we don't have any evidence at the moment."</p>

    <p>In fact, General Yi had already started to suspect something a long time ago. Now, he could finally almost see the entire shape of the matter. He was well aware that he wouldn't get anywhere if he questioned Sun Dakang directly. Thus, when all was said and done, he had to start with Number 60 High, and with Zhuo Yi, if he wanted to carry out an investigation... he had indeed been considering this before the Demon Hunters Association incident had come to an end.</p>

    <p>But now he had a new plan; he decided to pay the student at the center of this incident a visit at home.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if it was his own mistaken impression, but General Yi felt that there was something a little fishy about this.</p>

    <p>And as for what kind of person the Almighty who stood behind Director Zhuo Yi was, General Yi had a strong feeling that this trip... would give him an answer!</p>

    <p>"Looks like you've made up your mind, General." Seeing General Yi's determined look, Old Tang chuckled.</p>

    <p>"I hope the outcome of this matter won't be too terrible. Dakang and I have worked together for thousands of years. Logically speaking, he wouldn't do anything so stupid... but if he's involved in this matter, I'll go all out to arrest him."</p>

    <p>When he said this, his eyes flickered. "Separate the public and the private, this is the best way to handle this."</p>

    <p>"Does the General need me to make any preparations?" asked Old Tang.</p>

    <p>General Yi waved his hand. "Not for now. The Beast King's Remains summer camp in Songhai city is about to start, and I'm supposed to go. I should also go see my foolish junior brother while I'm at it... But before that, I plan to clarify something first..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, Number 60 High was especially noisy this morning, and the focus of attention in Grade One, Class Three was naturally Wang Ling and his "new lease on life."</p>

    <p>He came to school particularly early today; when he arrived, there were only a few students who were cleaning the class, and Su Xiao was on his way out the door with several bouquets of flowers which he was going to throw out.</p>

    <p>These flowers were from students in other classes at Number 60 High who had bought them yesterday after receiving the news of Wang Ling's mishap. The labels on the flowers even had "Profound Condolences, Classmate Wang Ling" on them.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Holding the flowers, Su Xiao ran into Wang Ling just as he left the classroom, and he immediately cried out in alarm, "Holy shit! A living Classmate Wang Ling!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Although the news had already gotten out yesterday that Wang Ling was alive and kicking, Su Xiao was still a little petrified when he saw Wang Ling again.</p>

    <p>The class cadre who had come early to clean the classroom had also officially received Teacher Pan's notice that morning. The class was still full of the scent of flowers... When Wang Ling entered, he saw that there was actually a pile of wreaths at his seat.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling, wait! Let me confirm it!"</p>

    <p>Su Xiao stretched out a hand and poked Wang Ling's face.</p>

    <p>Hm, it was the same facial paralysis and dead fish eyes, but in any case, this face was warm! It looked like this was indeed a living Classmate Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling, it's so good that you're still alive! Everyone was so worried! Some of the girls cried yesterday!" said Su Xiao.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling listened to Su Xiao describe their classmates' reactions yesterday when he had been fighting President Bai elsewhere.</p>

    <p>Among the girls, Sun Rong and Lin Xiaoyu had been the saddest, while the boys had in contrast been more composed. Most of them had been silent, and only Chen Chao acted as if nothing had happened because he felt that Wang Ling would be completely fine.</p>

    <p>Yesterday, Su Xiao had thought Chen Chao cold-blooded, but now... Chen Chao's mouth was indeed pretty amazing.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao and Chen Chao were chatting as they entered the class, and were stunned the moment they saw Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "Yo! Wang Ling, you're still alive."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "Mm..."</p>

    <p><em>Really sorry to disappoint you...</em></p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "Can you reimburse me for the wreath I bought yesterday?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Since it was purely a joke, Wang Ling's expression remained completely unchanged.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao patted his thigh. "Look, what did I say? I said he would definitely be fine! This is our class mascot, after all! How can something happen to him?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Did you read the news this morning? I heard that this President Bai blew himself up in the space and there was nothing left of him." Chen Chao smiled. "Look, not only did Wang Ling escape a calamity, he even got President Bai to blow himself up after he was caught by the other party... If it isn't for the fact that he's in the same high school as us, I'd suspect that he's the protagonist!"</p>

    <p>"Are these two things necessarily linked?" Su Xiao asked doubtfully.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao didn't know whether to laugh or cry. "What protagonist would choose to study in an ordinary high school... there's a hole in his brain otherwise!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
