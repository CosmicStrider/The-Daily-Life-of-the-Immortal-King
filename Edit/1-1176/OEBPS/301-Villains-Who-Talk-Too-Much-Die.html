  <h1>Chapter 301 Villains Who Talk Too Much Die </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Master of Immortal Mansion Cheng Yu knew that he had underestimated his enemy.</p>

    <p>He recalled an old saying: Villains who talk too much die. For some reason, after seeing Fang Xing take out two supreme magic spells one after another, Cheng Yu vaguely felt like he was seeing the Death Star appear.</p>

    <p>He had never thought that Immortal She Pi would actually have been able to do so much before his death; not only had he given Fang Xing his snake scales and intrinsic spirit field, he had also passed the White Night Spell on to him. The most terrifying thing was that Fang Xing had even mastered the Immortal Mode.</p>

    <p>These two spells hadn't been developed by the same person, but they were very compatible. Performed at the same time, they could work endlessly, like a perpetual motion machine.</p>

    <p>The White Night Spell armor was the product of the accumulation of natural spirit energy. As long as there was spirit energy, the armor wouldn't be destroyed. The most unnatural part of it was that the spell completely ignored terrain conditions like the restriction of the intrinsic spirit field. With Immortal Mode activated, spirit energy could cycle endlessly, like a perpetual motion machine, and increase battle strength explosively.</p>

    <p>The White Night Spell was Immortal She Pi's specialty that had once astonished the masses, but few people had seen him use it with their own eyes.</p>

    <p>Now, Fang Xing had inherited this spell, and it was being used once again, which was truly a source of amazement to Cheng Yu.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, he had completely never expected that switching between the two armors of the White Night Spell would also cause the user's gender to switch.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At that moment, Fang Xing stood in the middle of the intrinsic spirit field, her slender frame unmoving and her eyes focused in front of her.</p>

    <p>She was like the embodiment of the dark: her entire body was shrouded in a black light that resembled the formless mass of pre-existence. Her hair was jet-black and her delicate features looked like they had been carved from jade. If this elegance couldn't earn her the title of the most magnificent beauty of her generation, she was at least the supreme incomparable beauty among her contemporaries.</p>

    <p>This was in fact Fang Xing's original appearance.</p>

    <p>"I didn't think I would need to use this technique to deal with you."</p>

    <p>She raised her head and spoke in a ruthless tone that was decidedly feminine.</p>

    <p>"Impudent! I'm going to destroy you right now!"</p>

    <p>Master of Immortal Mansion Cheng Yu raised his hand, and in an instant, hundreds of spirit swords hurtled toward her.</p>

    <p>The tables had now completely turned. If the situation dragged out any longer, he would be the one at a disadvantage. He could absolutely imagine how powerful the Immortal Mode White Night Spell was.</p>

    <p>Or it might be even more powerful than that.</p>

    <p>He could feel her aura surge incessantly. These hundreds of spirit swords smashed into Fang Xing with a resounding clash of metal, but they were unable to penetrate the doubly enhanced black armor — she was like a black swan, swimming haughtily in an ocean of swords.</p>

    <p>Finally, without needing to use a magic treasure, she leapt into the sky!</p>

    <p>"True Immortal level!"</p>

    <p>Cheng Yu's expression finally changed; he had never expected that the two spells would boost Fang Xing's strength directly to True Immortal level, to the point that she could even hover in the sky by her own power.</p>

    <p>The black armor she was wearing wasn't the only effect of the Dark Victory Mode and Immortal Mode; her aura had also reached an intimidating level.</p>

    <p>Hundreds of spirit swords flew straight at Fang Xing, but with just one burst of her aura in the air, she instantly dispelled the spirit sword arrays.</p>

    <p>In the end, Cheng Yu saw her stretch out her hand to directly intercept several of the spirit swords that had flown at her and snap them in two.</p>

    <p>A moment later, the Master of Immortal Mansion couldn't help clutching his chest as he endured the roiling of his blood. Each of the spirit sword in this intrinsic spirit field was bound to him, and once they were damaged, the backlash served as a kind of punishment that would rebound back on him.</p>

    <p>After Fang Xing broke tens of spirit swords, Cheng Yu felt as if there was a blazing inferno in his chest, and like all his organs were going to melt on the spot. Although he wasn't coughing up blood, this type of suffering was painful enough to make him want to die, and he was forced to suffer in silence.</p>

    <p>But this pain was negligible, and only for the moment. He gritted his teeth — his hatred of Fang Xing was so deep that no matter what, he had to kill her in this battle today.</p>

    <p>He waved his hand to call back his spirit swords; they returned from attacking to line up like sardines behind him again.</p>

    <p>Cheng Yu knew that these spirit swords weren't enough to battle Fang Xing after she had been enhanced by the two supreme spells. If he continued fighting her, not only would his precious spirit swords be damaged, he would also suffer from the continuous backlash, which would be very detrimental to him.</p>

    <p>"Aren't we going to continue?" The maiden Fang Xing smiled. But compared with the bright smile she had worn as a young man, her smile now was slightly demonic, unsettling Cheng Yu greatly.</p>

    <p>"My friend's spirit sword is still with you, right? When are you going to return it?" Fang Xing asked as she gazed at him.</p>

    <p>"All spirit swords under heaven were made to serve me, so your friend's spirit sword will be mine sooner or later!" said Cheng Yu.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Frowning, Fang Xing only had one thought in her mind now: she wanted to strangle this chuuni as soon as possible!</p>

    <p>Hovering in the air, Cheng Yu sneered. "That wooden sword is special. I dare say that the sword spirit inside is the most powerful one I've ever seen. Its only weakness is that the sword body is too weak and it doesn't have a sheath. It isn't perfect like this, and I'm looking for ways to make it perfect!"</p>

    <p>Floating in the air, Fang Xing widened her eyes. "What have you done to Lord Jingke?"</p>

    <p>"So his name is Jingke? I'm looking for a gifted smith to extract the spirit body of the sword spirit and fuse it with my supreme godly sword."</p>

    <p>Cheng Li laughed cruelly. "Did you actually call him Lord? How ridiculous. Since ancient times, the sword spirits of spirit swords have served cultivators. They're not living things at all, they're just tools."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing frowned deeply as she begged to differ.</p>

    <p>"He was suppressed by my spirit-suppressing flags and is trapped in a magic treasure. After bringing him here to Immortal Mansion, I added new seals and even a holy array pattern to the base of the flags, cutting off his connection to his owner for the time being," Cheng Yu said. "So there's no way for him to escape at all. So for now, let me show you my unfinished masterpiece."</p>

    <p>As he said this, he waved his hand, and a green-colored longsword broke free of an iceberg and like a shooting star, fell into his hands.</p>

    <p>This was the work he was most proud of, a green longsword with a unique shape: the sword tip was actually rounded, and there were two round metal eggs on the sword hilt, which was in keeping with an ergonomic design...</p>
