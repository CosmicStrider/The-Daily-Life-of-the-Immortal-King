  <h1>Chapter 383 Scary Landlord </h1>

  <div>

    <p>There were all sorts of bizarre physiques in the cultivation world. Take the poisonous body for example: people with this kind of physique were highly toxic from head to toe - even one strand of hair was extremely poisonous. They could easily poison or even kill someone just through skin contact, and flowers and trees would wither wherever they went. Another example was the cold physique. People born with this physique would be exceptionally cold, and even if their bodies were on fire, they wouldn't feel it at all. However, it was the first time that Er Ha had seen a physique like Wei Zhi's that wasn't affected by electric shocks.</p>

    <p>Looking at this scene, Er Ha pondered: based on this point alone, Wei Zhi met the Society of Saints'"unusually gifted" admission requirement.</p>

    <p>This physique was simply a natural enemy for cultivators who used electricity-based techniques.</p>

    <p>What it didn't know was how many volts Wei Zhi could take, but if he really was completely immune, and even the Lightning Tribulation didn't scare him, then he truly was freaking awesome!</p>

    <p>Er Ha thought so in its heart.</p>

    <p>At that very moment, the battle was still ongoing.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi grabbed the electric prod and squeezed; with a "bang," this electroshock magic treasure was directly turned to dust in his hand.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi certainly had power, and it wasn't weak.</p>

    <p>While he only seemed to be at the Golden Core stage based on his aura, Er Ha was sure that Wei Zhi had definitely hidden his true strength; the body movements he had used on their way to the apartment wasn't something that a Golden Core cultivator could do.</p>

    <p>But their opponents were five Golden Core cultivators, and trying to beat them in a scuffle actually wouldn't be so easy.</p>

    <p>It now came down to personal ability.</p>

    <p>Er Ha hid behind Wei Zhi, prepared to join the fight at any time, but it saw that Wei Zhi's expression was still pretty calm.</p>

    <p>"Go, all of you!"</p>

    <p>Furious, the bone dragon man who was the leader gave an explosive shout, and the five men took out their magic weapons one after another as they prepared to dash forward.</p>

    <p>But just then, Wei Zhi actually looked at the time with an unperturbed expression. "It's almost time..."</p>

    <p>Almost time? What did he mean?</p>

    <p>Before Er Ha could figure it out, the fire exit door on the twenty-third floor buzzed opened at that moment, and an old man carrying a flashlight and wearing a white singlet and bell-bottomed pants walked out unhurriedly.</p>

    <p>For a moment, all was still.</p>

    <p>After a short silence, the old man looked at the men in black and frowned. "How did you get in?"</p>

    <p>The bone dragon man stopped in his attack and cast a glance at the red armband around the old man's arm.</p>

    <p>Neighborhood Committee?</p>

    <p>He immediately couldn't help sneering. "Old man, mind your own business!"</p>

    <p>The old man's expression was very calm. He looked very thin and weak, like a strong wind could blow him over, but when he raised his left arm, overbearing vigor suddenly poured forth from his body as it glowed like a dazzling blade!</p>

    <p>At this moment, the complexions of all five men in black changed drastically, as if what they were seeing wasn't a human left arm, but a godly force that could wipe out worlds and split the heaven and the earth.</p>

    <p>Er Ha's face also changed; the old man's identity wasn't simple... he was too strong, excessively so!</p>

    <p>This intense pressure made everyone's skin tremble...</p>

    <p>Under such strong vigor, Wei Zhi scratched his head and said weakly, "Uncle Jiang... please show some mercy, I still need to interrogate these five people."</p>

    <p>The old man hummed softly, and almost instantly the light from his left arm vanished as he flipped his hand downward.</p>

    <p>These five men in black were suddenly pinned to the floor by their heads like cockroaches, completely unable to move. The floor sank down slightly, creating five human-shaped indents.</p>

    <p>The bone dragon man was utterly terrified. His eyes were bloodshot and his nose was dripping blood freely.</p>

    <p>"You can't come and go as you please in this place," the old man said in a deep voice as he stared at the five men on the floor.</p>

    <p>After that, he looked at Wei Zhi. "You calculated that I would be coming at this time, which is why you deliberately led them here, right?"</p>

    <p>"Uncle Jiang... how could that be..." Wei Zhi smiled embarrassedly, his face giving nothing away.</p>

    <p>"You really have the guts to treat me like your thug." The old man snorted. The ground beneath his feet then shook slightly, and a small wave of air rushed out to sweep the five men in black aside and open up a path.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "Uncle Jiang?"</p>

    <p>The old man shot a look at Wei Zhi. "Why are you still spacing out? Stand aside, I'm going to go read the water meter!"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi trembled at the old man's expression. "Okay, Uncle Jiang..."</p>

    <p>When he entered, Old Man Jiang saw Er Ha, and couldn't help raising an eyebrow. "Is this forgiveness <sup>1</sup> dog yours?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A reminder that this is associated with the color green ..)</dfn>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "It belongs to a friend..."</p>

    <p>Old Man Jiang stared at Er Ha for a while. Though Er Ha didn't feel any spiritual awareness or aura sweeping over its body, the old man's expression made his fur stand on end... Too scary, this single look was so intimidating!</p>

    <p>"There's a saying..."</p>

    <p>Grandpa Jiang said, "Ugly faces are everywhere, but beautiful souls are hard to find <sup>2</sup>."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(The original saying is "Beautiful faces are everywhere, but beautiful souls are hard to find")</dfn>

    <p>This was a very meaningful remark, and Er Ha was alarmed when he heard it â€” this old man was really frightening!</p>

    <p>"What does it mean, Uncle Jiang?" Wei Zhi rubbed his head.</p>

    <p>"Figure it out yourself. But your friend's dog... is certainly interesting." Old Man Jiang laughed, and with his hands behind his back, went inside to read the water meter. It was clear that this wasn't his first time here, and he was obviously very familiar with the layout of Wei Zhi's place.</p>

    <p>Roughly five minutes later, the old man came out of the kitchen and returned to the entrance to find that Wei Zhi had tied up all the five men in black.</p>

    <p>Hands behind his back, the expression on the old man's face was very relaxed. "I'll leave these five people to you to interrogate; I have to go to the next unit to read their water meter."</p>

    <p>"Okay, Uncle Jiang! See you!"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi saluted and bowed at the door. It was only after the old man left through the fire exit, hands still clasped behind his back, that Wei Zhi heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>"Ah... That was dangerous! Uncle Jiang truly isn't over the hill just yet! When he released his vigor just now, I almost fainted!" Wei Zhi couldn't help marveling.</p>

    <p>"This senior is...?" Er Ha was very curious.</p>

    <p>"Have you heard of Jiang Lei?" asked Wei Zhi.</p>

    <p>Er Ha was shaken - this was one of the Ten Founding Generals, like General Yi, Secretary Dakang and Minister Shi!</p>

    <p>That old man was actually Marshal Jiang?</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "Back then when the Gate Between Worlds opened for the first time, Uncle Jiang was a mighty force. When the first demon king landed, he attacked it on his own, and then used his scissors legs to crush its head."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "Now Uncle Jiang is gloriously retired. Oh, and also, the land this family apartment is on is his, and he built this building himself back then. Nowadays, he would be what we call... the landlord?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>
