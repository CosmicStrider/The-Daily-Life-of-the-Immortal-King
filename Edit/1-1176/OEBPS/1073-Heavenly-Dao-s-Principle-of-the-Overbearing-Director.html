  <h1>Chapter 1073 Heavenly Dao's Principle of the Overbearing Director</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Was there truly no hope?</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling heard what the Heavenly Dao said, his expression darkened, and when he saw the last shred of the old man's conscience swallowed up by the heart demon, he thought quickly and decided to give it one last shot.</p>

    <p>He stretched his hand out in the air, and actually pulled out another old man from a space fissure, who wasn't corroded by the heart demon.</p>

    <p>Then, Wang Ling placed his other hand on the conscience old man who was about to be devoured by the heart demon, and he used his body as a bridge to transfer the heart demon out by splitting it in half!</p>

    <p>"This is..."</p>

    <p>"Acid-base neutralization," said Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>It was a very simple chemical principle.</p>

    <p>It could be done with Fate Dao.</p>

    <p>The old man whom Wang Ling had pulled out of the space tunnel had been grabbed from a parallel dimension using Fate Dao. Now that the old man's heart demon corrosion was beyond saving, Wang Ling thought that this technique might buy them some time.</p>

    <p>In the end, after Wang Ling made his move, the Heavenly Dao little golden man suddenly said, "We can save him!"</p>

    <p>"How?"</p>

    <p>"Earlier, the heart demon corrosion was too great. But the degree of damage now can be fixed with the Bell of Purification," the golden man swiftly replied. "I'll go to the treasury to fetch it!"</p>

    <p>"Don't we have to go through the application process?"</p>

    <p>"Those on the white list don't have to."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Ten seconds later, the little golden man made a hand seal and pressed his hands to the ground. A mist suddenly swirled up, and a colorful ceramic magic bell appeared in front of Wang Ling and Er Ha.</p>

    <p>Floating in the air, this bell radiated a pure and holy aura, which seemed to possess the power to purify all beings in the world. Wang Ling sensed that the power of the Great Purification Spell paled drastically in comparison with the Bell of Purification. After all, it was a supreme magic treasure, and one of the Heavenly Dao's Thirty-Three Precious Treasures.</p>

    <p>Sighing inwardly, Wang Ling grabbed the Bell of Purification with his bare hands, and it didn't show any resistance at all. The little golden man was terrified when he saw this. If a normal cultivator happened to run across a Heavenly Dao Precious Treasure, the latter absolutely wouldn't let itself be touched as long as it didn't recognize the cultivator as its master.</p>

    <p>But this Bell of Purification lay docilely in Wang Ling's hands like a baby...</p>

    <p>Holding the Bell of Purification, Wang Ling shook it in front of the two conscience old men, and the black mist that lingered around them dissipated.</p>

    <p>They were completely purified of the heart demon on the spot!</p>

    <p>After everything was done, Wang Ling sent back the conscience old man whom he had pulled from a parallel universe.</p>

    <p>The ground which the shabby cabin was on started to shake slightly.</p>

    <p>In the blink of an eye, the shabby cabin turned back into a massive palace; sunlight shone brightly through the windows and the world outside the palace came back to life.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Er Ha finally sighed with relief.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, he had mastered Fate Dao, otherwise he really didn't know what he could have done in the face of this situation.</p>

    <p>"By the way... can you..." The little golden man gazed at the Bell of Purification in Wang Ling's hand and tried to get it back.</p>

    <p>Of course, Wang Ling wasn't someone who didn't return what he borrowed.</p>

    <p>This was one of the Heavenly Dao's Thirty-Three Precious Treasures, after all... it belonged to Heavenly Dao to begin with.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling also knew that in a peaceful era, the Heavenly Dao's Thirty-Three Precious Treasures didn't get much use. While he had fixed the undertaker's problem, there were still eight other people to go, and Wang Ling would need to rely on this Bell of Purification to purify them of the heart demons.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling couldn't return this thing for the time being.</p>

    <p>Of course, he wasn't completely selfless...</p>

    <p>When he shook the Bell of Purification just now, he thought that the sound it made was quite pleasant to listen to.</p>

    <p>Maybe he could give this small bell to his little sister as a toy.</p>

    <p>Ah Nuan was too aggressive and could easily stir up trouble. This Bell of Purification could eradicate demonic tendencies as well as suppress fury, which fit Ah Nuan to a tee!</p>

    <p>At this thought, Wang Ling cheerfully put away this Bell of Purification.</p>

    <p>Seeing this, the expectant little golden man was furious but didn't dare say anything...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After returning to the land of Heavenly Dao, this little golden man who was responsible for all matters to do with Wang Ling was rebuked by the six main Heavenly Dao of the Heavenly Dao Governing Committee.</p>

    <p>"I didn't do it deliberately..." The little golden man felt quite wronged. "If you think you have the ability to get it back, go look for him yourself..."</p>

    <p>"I don't care what you think! I only care what I think!"</p>

    <p>The six main Heavenly Dao began to berate him one after another.</p>

    <p>"I'm the main Heavenly Dao, you have to listen to me!"</p>

    <p>"Can't get it back? I don't think it's a problem. Even if it is, it's your problem as the person-in-charge - you should be the one to fix it!"</p>

    <p>"I don't care whether it's possible to get it back or not. You have to get it back even if you can't! I'll say it again! Go get it back even if you can't! Don't ask me again if I can get it back, you must get it back! Understand? You must get it back!"</p>

    <p>"If you can't, why don't you just quit?"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>A few seconds later, the little golden man burst out in tears.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, Wang Ling, who had obtained the Bell of Purification, embarked on the second part of his journey of purification.</p>

    <p>The undertaker's problem was fixed and the Shadow Image behind him directly disappeared, while the souls that had been devoured by the Shadow Image before were all released, and were now waiting to enter the natural cycle of reincarnation.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's second stop was a hospital in the city center.</p>

    <p>This place wasn't unfamiliar to Wang Ling - this was precisely Director Li's hospital from back then. Wang Ling remembered that this was a special administrative medical defense building mainly used to quarantine patients with unusual ailments. It was a little strange for Wang Ling to show up uninvited in the middle of the night, but fortunately, Lord Diulei had already made the arrangements for Wang Ling. The Office of Strategic Deception had sent someone over to wait for them, and the person who had been appointed to wait for Wang Ling at the second stop was Xiao Yin.</p>

    <p>"Master!" From a long distance away, Wang Ling saw a barefooted young man with silver hair waving at him.</p>

    <p>"You came out like this without putting on a disguise?" Er Ha gazed at Xiao Yin in some surprise, since Xiao Yin would go out with a hat to cover the two horns on his head.</p>

    <p>"It's fine, it's fine. It's so hot with a hat on, and my horns would be cooked under it!" said Xiao Yin. "Didn't Nezha become big recently?"</p>

    <p>"That's right."</p>

    <p>"If someone asks me about my horns, I'll just say I'm cosplaying Aobing."</p>

    <p>"..." Er Ha and Wang Ling sucked in their breaths.</p>

    <p>In some sense, this guy was really a genius...</p>

    <p>Without wasting any time, Xiao Yin led them into the building and explained the second person's situation to them. "Master, this person's condition is somewhat unusual. It's pica<sup>1</sup>, and the person has been receiving treatment for it here all this time."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Eating disorder where a person eats things not normally considered food.)</dfn>
    
    <p>"Pica? Then how did they eat that bag of frozen dumplings?"</p>

    <p>"According to the nurse, the person ate half a mouthful that day and threw up... They probably didn't throw up all of it."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
