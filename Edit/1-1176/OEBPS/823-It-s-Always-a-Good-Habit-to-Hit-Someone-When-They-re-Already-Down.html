  <h1>Chapter 823 It's Always a Good Habit to Hit Someone When They're Already Down</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This was a troublesome opponent. In terms of fighting strength alone, Wang Ling judged that this man and Evil Sword God should be evenly matched. It was just that the current situation was a little difficult to deal with since it wasn't him that was present at the scene, but the two clones Ling Zhenren and Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch, who had their own spiritual intelligence.</p>

    <p>In terms of individual combat capability, there was in the end a limit to the clones' fighting strength.</p>

    <p>It was Lord Diulei who had set up this situation this time, to help divert attention away from Ling Zhenren and balance out the pull of this name in the world outside. Thus, Wang Ling couldn't let these two clones act rashly, only to be crushed, otherwise this entire set-up would have been in vain.</p>

    <p>What was more, the Ten Generals now saw Lord Diulei as their new target.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought he could make good use of this point.</p>

    <p>So the main characters in today's fight couldn't be him, or these two clones; it had to center on Lord Diulei and the Ten Generals.</p>

    <p>While Wang Ling was analyzing the situation through the eyes of the two clones at the scene, the atmosphere had utterly frozen.</p>

    <p>The most powerful killing intent spread in the air, so cold that one couldn't help trembling violently all over, and Lord Diulei noticed that a layer of frost had actually begun to form over the ground.</p>

    <p>"None of you here are my match."</p>

    <p>Ultimate King of Killers sneered, supremely confident in himself. "Back then, you locked me up in Sky Prison - not executing me straightaway was the biggest mistake you made. Even a prison cell made from the material of the Spirit Shackles couldn't hold me, and I escaped. What else can you do to me?"</p>

    <p>His remarks immediately stirred up lively discussion among the many sect leaders and reporters present.</p>

    <p>A lot of the Sky-level sect leaders sensed that something wasn't right about this situation.</p>

    <p>"Given Ultimate King of Killers's personality, he should have slaughtered everyone without exception as soon as he snuck in... But his goal this time seems very clear..." President Lu's voice was gloomy.</p>

    <p>"Ultimate King of Killers deliberately left us and the reporters alone, and deliberately chose to appear today; it's very likely he already knew early on that the Ten Generals would be here in person." Professor Yang sighed.</p>

    <p>The Ten Generals absolutely couldn't take this fight lightly.</p>

    <p>Ultimate King of Killers had deliberately chosen to act at the founding ceremony of the Office of Strategic Deception because it was the liveliest day!</p>

    <p>Right now, almost more than seventy percent of the sect leaders and representatives from the entire sect circle were gathered in the northern square, along with these influential reporters.</p>

    <p>Ultimate King of Killers wanted to do something big in front of these people!</p>

    <p>He didn't just want to do something as simple as disrupt the ceremony - he wanted to embarrass the Ten Generals in front of everyone.</p>

    <p>In theory, all he had to do was defeat just one of the Ten Generals to achieve his goal.</p>

    <p>But now...</p>

    <p>It was clear that this King of Killers had come prepared, and was confident that he could stand against the Ten Generals by his own power.</p>

    <p>"Ultimate King of Killers, you have been on the run for many years, creating alarm and anxiety among the citizens of Huaxiu. Today, this old man will take charge and get rid of you right here." General Yi stepped forward.</p>

    <p>He directly opened his intrinsic spirit field and pulled King of Killers in. Their figures gradually grew transparent before vanishing directly.</p>

    <p>This was the spatial layering effect of the intrinsic spirit field as General Yi directly dragged Ultimate King of Killers into his intrinsic spirit field.</p>

    <p>Logically speaking, when an intrinsic spirit field was used in a fight, the party who activated theirs first and dragged the enemy into it definitely had the upper hand.</p>

    <p>This was because the intrinsic spirit field would only empower its creator; any magic the foreign party used while fighting in the field would continually use up their consumption of spirit energy until it was all exhausted.</p>

    <p>But the rest of the Ten Generals still had heavy expressions when they saw how General Yi had acted.</p>

    <p>"Old Yi is too impulsive!" Battle Saint Marshal Jiang frowned deeply.</p>

    <p>His plan had been to work with the other generals to suppress Ultimate King of Killers first before they did anything else, so as to protect the venue. There was something fishy about this King of Killers, but General Yi had directly turned it into a one-on-one fight, which was instead an unfavorable variable...</p>

    <p>"Given Old Yi's experience and talent, he shouldn't fall into a trap even if this person is up to something. Let's watch for the time being. With me here, Old Yi will be fine," Medical Saint Luo Huaiqiu said.</p>

    <p>Because they were fighting inside the intrinsic spirit field, no one knew what on earth was going on.</p>

    <p>But to everyone's surprise, the battle ended unexpectedly quickly.</p>

    <p>Less than three minutes later, General Yi and King of Killers reappeared.</p>

    <p>King of Killers had fallen to one knee as he spat out large mouthfuls of blood. There was a bloody hole the size of a fist in his chest. His white undershirt was soaked with blood that trickled down to the ground, staining his wooden clogs.</p>

    <p>"Heh, just so-so..."</p>

    <p>General Yi swung his arm, and the light in his hand instantly scattered.</p>

    <p>General Yi wasn't wielding a sword, but a gas-like substance materialized in the center of his palm. While it seemed intangible, it had a piercing presence and emitted a soul-freezing pressure.</p>

    <p>"Palm Sword combined with Boundless Sword Dao..." President Qi raised his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>He sighed inwardly. This King of Killers was indeed strong.</p>

    <p>He had actually forced the grand Blademaster to use this skill combo as soon as their fight began.</p>

    <p>Palm Sword was the technique which made General Yi famous.</p>

    <p>While Boundless Sword Dao was his special skill which made General Yi's reputation resound all the more.</p>

    <p>The combination of the two was nothing short of a bold, innovative move.</p>

    <p>"My boundless sword qi has already sealed off your spirit veins and destroyed your spirit body. You won't live for much longer." General Yi pinched his mustache as he gazed at King of Killers, who half-knelt on the ground as he spat blood.</p>

    <p>"What a pity, he might have still proven valuable." Explosion Saint shook his head. King of Killers would truly find it hard to survive that injury.</p>

    <p>But it wasn't wrong for General Yi to kill him on the spot.</p>

    <p>Originally, if wanted criminals at King of Killers's level resisted arrest, they could be killed at the scene, according to Huaxiu's regulations for handling wanted criminals. What was more, King of Killers's appearance in this place was a serious threat to the lives of the people gathered here.</p>

    <p>So Ultimate King of Killers had to die.</p>

    <p>Several seconds later, as General Yi said, Ultimate King of Killers directly collapsed to the ground...</p>

    <p>He was bleeding all over; the boundless sword qi had wreaked wanton havoc throughout his body, piercing it until it was like a punctured balloon leaking blood everywhere.</p>

    <p>General Yi had actually disposed of Ultimate King of Killers in a flash...</p>

    <p>Countless people at the scene sucked in cold breaths of air.</p>

    <p>A lot of them didn't know what on earth happened inside the intrinsic spirit field.</p>

    <p>But the way he solved this problem so efficiently made many feel proud and elated.</p>

    <p>It could only be said, as expected of the Boundless Blademaster.</p>

    <p>Truly, he showed no signs of slowing down.</p>

    <p>"I'll hit him one more time, just in case." General Yi squinted at the body of King of Killers on the ground, who looked like he was already dead.</p>

    <p>It was always a good habit to hit the enemy one more time after battle, especially when faced with such a mortal foe.</p>

    <p>Even if General Yi was now retired, he was just as prudent and careful as before.</p>

    <p>But just as General Yi approached King of Killers's body, ready to strike again...</p>

    <p>In a flash, Ultimate King of Killers's body actually turned into black qi that entered General Yi's body...</p>

    <p>"Old Yi, you..."</p>

    <p>In almost a split second, General Yi's eyes turned black, and his body stopped floating in the air as it touched down firmly on the ground...</p>

    <p>Under the stunned gazes of the other Ten Generals, King of Killers's voice came out of General Yi's mouth. "I already said, none of you are my match... Yi Jianchuan this old fellow was in such a hurry to act, and in the end I still possessed him..."</p>
