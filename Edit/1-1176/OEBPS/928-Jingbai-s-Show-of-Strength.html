  <h1>Chapter 928 Jingbai's Show of Strength</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When 16-Winged God and the throne from the divine realm were annihilated by the massive World-Annihilating Sword, the victor in this battle was already decided.</p>

    <p>The gems that had been embedded in the throne had vanished into thin air; before it thoroughly disappeared, the throne had sent them away using a superior transmission spell. Jingbai clearly saw it happen but didn't bother to stop it.</p>

    <p>He was the king of swords; there naturally was no need for him to bother with a drowning dog desperately trying to escape.</p>

    <p>But the divine realm had invaded Earth this time and made this mess, so a show of strength was necessary.</p>

    <p>Killing just 16-Winged God wasn't satisfying at all.</p>

    <p>At this thought, Jingbai cut an opening in the sky with his sword fingers; this was an entrance which led directly to the divine realm.</p>

    <p>Without too much thought and hands behind his back, he stepped into the space that led to the divine realm.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, Wang Ling, who had been watching the battle down below, was drawn into a snow-white spirit world. This was the throne's request after it was annihilated, and after thinking for a bit, Wang Ling agreed to it.</p>

    <p>As the saying went, a man spoke true on the brink of death...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw what the throne looked like after death: it was a man whose features weren't clear. He had a pair of wings, and he seemed to be suspended slightly in the air like a phantom.</p>

    <p>When men died, they became spirits; when gods died, they became nothing.</p>

    <p>This was the phantom of the throne after death.</p>

    <p>"I lost." The throne opened his mouth. It seemed that there was some remorse in his tone, but it was clearly too late for regrets.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling gazed at the throne, his expression as calm as an ancient well.</p>

    <p>"You harbor many doubts in your heart; you can find the answers to these doubts in the divine realm." The throne's voice rang out lightly.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't reply.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, the throne had guessed right; Wang Ling was indeed perplexed.</p>

    <p>Especially after learning that there was a divine realm, he was even more bewildered.</p>

    <p>He was wondering if the divine realm had any way to help him control his power.</p>

    <p>He was wondering what the way of life in the divine realm was like.</p>

    <p>The thing he wondered about the most... was whether the divine realm had crispy noodle snacks to eat...</p>

    <p>The phantom of the throne looked at Wang Ling. "There is nothing in your past and future; do you know why? I believe this is what you're wondering about the most..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"I'm going to disappear. The death of a god is something of a relief."</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, the phantom's lower half had already begun to fade. He turned to face Wang Ling. "Have you ever wondered why you're still single..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's face was unruffled.</p>

    <p>"When you put a seal on your strength, you also sealed off your emotions..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"You're destined to become one of us, but the time is not yet right..."</p>

    <p>By then, most of the phantom had already disappeared.</p>

    <p>Before he completely vanished, he left Wang Ling with one last sentence: "Perhaps once you've gotten old, you'll go dancing in the square with many other gods in the divine realm..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The divine realm was a place Jingbai had almost forgotten.</p>

    <p>It was a bright world lush with vegetation and countless spiritual bodies traveling back and forth - these very spirits were deities.</p>

    <p>The moment Jingbai stepped into the divine realm, these spiritual bodies gathered from far and wide to ultimately take the shape of a divine figure, and an ethereal voice rang out in the sky. "Winged Gods of the divine realm remind you: routes are countless, safety is the priority. With unregulated intrusions, your loved ones may end up in tears <sup>1</sup> ..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Adapted from a line in "The Wandering Earth..")</dfn>

    <p>This was 98-Winged God.</p>

    <p>"Tell your Thousand-Winged God to come see me." Jingbai raised his hand. Sword light shot out from his fingers, and 98-Winged God was instantly annihilated.</p>

    <p>Jingbai couldn't be bothered to talk rubbish with 98-Winged God.</p>

    <p>This was the first fusion, and he couldn't maintain it for very long; he had to solve everything as quickly as possible.</p>

    <p>The godly power here was like an ocean, the infinite energy like great billows of waves. Anyone from the Domain of the Gods who came here would be instantly disintegrated, to say nothing of Earth cultivators; their bodies were so weak that they would be instantly crushed to dust by the energy pressure. If he wasn't in his merged state, Jingbai also wouldn't dare linger here for too long.</p>

    <p>Thus, what Jingbai saw in the divine realm were all spiritual bodies. They lived in a different form that was similar to wind and light, yet not. It was only when there was a foreign enemy invasion that the spiritual bodies would combine and turn into winged gods.</p>

    <p>The more wings they had, the stronger they were.</p>

    <p>The gods in the divine realm shared all their wisdom, memories and awareness.</p>

    <p>When Jingbai cut down 98-Winged God, he could clearly perceive the cries of grief of the roving spiritual bodies in the sky: it was the sobbing of infants, the bawling of children, and the distressed and teary words of adults.</p>

    <p>After 98-Winged God vanished, Jingbai waited for a handful of seconds. In an instant, the spiritual bodies around him coalesced in the sky like countless fish piling up on each other, starting from the legs and slowly working upward to form thighs, torso, hands, neck, head, and finally, a hundred wings on the back.</p>

    <p>"I said, have your Thousand-Winged God come see me!" Jingbai's hand was already raised to kill this Hundred-Winged God in front of him.</p>

    <p>Hundred-Winged God cried out for mercy. "Please show mercy, Your Majesty."</p>

    <p>Jingbai stopped. "It seems you have reflected on yourselves?"</p>

    <p>Hundred-Winged God flapped his wings, and innumerable divine feathers drifted down like petals, making for a comfortable and peaceful air.</p>

    <p>In the next second, these perfect, pure white feathers formed runes in the sky and then turned into a holy scroll which fell into Jingbai's hand.</p>

    <p>"What's this?" Jingbai didn't open it.</p>

    <p>"Thousand-Winged God's reflective essay," Hundred-Winged God replied. He shrunk down in size as a sign of respect so that he was on eye level with Jingbai; like a little brother, he didn't dare act rashly.</p>

    <p>"Only one essay? Not enough, not enough!" Jingbai snorted.</p>

    <p>"Then, Your Majesty means..."</p>

    <p>"Following Earth's calendar, before my master's summer vacation is over, Thousand-Winged God has to write one reflection a day. Also, is your Thousand-Winged God not going to atone in some other way besides writing reflective essays?"</p>

    <p>"Your Excellency Jingbai, we will do so. It's in the essay..." Hundred-Winged God wiped his sweat. "We have decided to restore the planets Divine Dao Star devoured. In addition, we will punish the phantom of 16-Winged God who acted for his own benefit as well as Star Lord of Divine Dao Star..."</p>

    <p>"You were the ones who created the Divine Dragons, so punish them as you see fit. But is there nothing else apart from this?" Jingbai asked.</p>

    <p>"Of... of course there is..." Hundred-Winged God said. "We will resurrect all the innocent creatures who died during this battle... and send someone to establish diplomatic relations between Divine Dao Star and the Domain of the Gods..." said Hundred-Winged God weakly.</p>

    <p>"Think again." Jingbai frowned.</p>

    <p>"Then, besides the Domain of the Gods, we will also establish diplomatic relations with Earth..." Hundred-Winged God panicked a little.</p>

    <p>"Wrong! Think again!" Jingbai was a little anxious and put his finger to Hundred-Winged God's neck. "If you still can't think of it, I'll stab you to death with my finger, and have your Thousand-Winged God do the thinking in your place!"</p>

    <p>"Crispy noodle snacks! We'll give you a planet of crispy noodle snacks!!"</p>

    <p>"Not bad, you can be taught..."</p>

    <p>Jingbai nodded and drew back his finger.</p>
