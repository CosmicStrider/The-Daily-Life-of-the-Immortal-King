  <h1>Chapter 61 Elder Brother's Original Intention </h1>

  <div>

      <p>How could a cat have such powerful oppressive force?</p>

      <p>The girl's stunned and pale expression also showed fear, since she had been completely immobilized! Like her body, even her tongue had become numb and she was unable to speak... in this situation, she couldn't even use the netherstone!</p>

      <p>At this moment, the girl recalled her elder sister's words, but it was too late for regrets. She should have retreated earlier on!</p>

      <p>Wang Ling felt that the girl seemed to have misunderstood something, as he actually hadn't released his aura and oppressive force to suppress her.</p>

      <p>The reason was very simple — releasing oppressive force was an AOE <sup>1</sup> skill. If he carelessly released this force in his unchecked state, it wouldn't just be this girl that would be reduced to a fleshy pulp, his dumbass elder brother as well as the cat division outside would also be turned to ash...</p>

      <dfn><sup>1</sup>(An 'Area of Effect' (AOE) skill in many role-playing games is an ability that affects multiple targets within a particular area.)</dfn>

      <p>Actually, the girl was immobilized as a result of the backlash from Wang Ling's invulnerable body, which had been triggered instinctively. This could cause the oppressive force to rebound with twice as much pressure. In fact, it pretty much shared the same principle as the rebound from a physical attack on the body; for a concrete example, please refer to the Eldest Young Master of Burying Love, Xu Ying, who because of the backlash back then, had been reduced to dust...</p>

      <p>This utterly discomfited girl who was unable to fight back did look a little funny to Wang Ming.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Wang Ling knew that Wang Ming had already uncovered his identity. Although he acknowledged that they didn't have a great relationship, like it or not, they coordinated quite well together in unusual situations.</p>

      <p>The moment the wall had been blast open, Wang Ming had already realized it had to be Wang Ling.</p>

      <p>He looked at his wristwatch. There were less than ten minutes left before the old talisman expired...</p>

      <p>Taking out the talisman which he had on him, he cautiously wrapped it around Wang Ling's arm like a band-aid.</p>

      <p>The seal was reinforced at last!</p>

      <p>Wang Ling checked his paws. Hmm... as expected, the new talisman was much stronger than the old one.</p>

      <p>He could clearly sense that his strength had been curbed drastically. The first three months after the talisman was put on was when the seal was the strongest. So in the next three months, Wang Ling didn't have to worry about breaking chopsticks; he could even jump around without fear during the radio gymnastics.</p>

      <p>This was great news. It made him happier even than when he was eating crispy noodle snacks.</p>

      <p>"To create the talisman this time, I refined the materials from the last three years and fused it with something new... it will last for five years now, which should be enough time for you." Wang Ming said the words in his mind instead of speaking out loud since Wang Ling would be able to hear it clearly with his Mind-Reading Ability. After all, there were outsiders around and they couldn't let them know the secret of the talisman seal.</p>

      <p>In some sense, Wang Ming felt that Wang Ling's uncontrollable advances in his realm as he got older was an even more important state secret to be protected than his own so-called most powerful brain of Huaxiu nation.</p>

      <p>He treated this matter as if it was his own secret; he had promised Wang Ling's parents that he wouldn't speak of it to outsiders. Even Wang Ming's own parents had no idea.</p>

      <p>If it were to be exposed, it was very likely that endless wars would follow.</p>

      <p>And Wang Ling would very likely be taken as a war machine by the nation...</p>

      <p>Wang Ming thus actually paid very serious and earnest attention to Wang Ling's matter. Not only had he been researching more powerful talismans for Wang Ling all this time, he also kept his lips tightly sealed regarding this secret.</p>

      <p>Wang Ling thought that at the very least, he and Wang Ming were of the same mind on this matter.</p>

      <p>His wish was for world peace.</p>

      <p>And it was the same for Wang Ming, this elder brother...</p>

      <p>Looking at the immobilized girl, Wang Ming turned his head to ask Wang Ling, "What should we do with this person?"</p>

      <p>Wang Ling raised an eyebrow; what else could they do?</p>

      <p>— Of course hand her over to the nation!</p>

      <p>From the beginning, he had had no intention of killing her, since there was no value for him in getting rid of one measly killer. On the other hand, if they delivered her to the cultivation police, it would significantly accelerate the investigation of the Stream Shadow incident.</p>

      <p>Even if they eliminate one killer, there were still tens of thousands of others... thus, helping the cultivation police take out an international criminal organization at the source... this should be the basic quality of a model citizen who upheld the core values of cultivation.</p>

      <p>Of course, Wang Ling didn't plan to claim credit for this deed.</p>

      <p>In the end, it would need the most powerful brain in Huaxiu nation to sort out the mess.</p>

      <p>Wang Ming bent down for a moment to search all the girl's pockets and recover the stolen netherstone. She looked like she had been paralyzed by the Sunflower Acupuncture Skill <sup>2</sup> . He pointed at her and sighed in his heart. "Knock her out first."</p>

      <dfn><sup>2</sup>(The Sunflower Acupuncture Skill is a martial art technique from the Chinese TV series 'My Own Swordsman' and 'Longmen Express.')</dfn>

      <p>After pondering for a moment, Wang Ling did as he was told.</p>

      <p>For the first time, Wang Ling felt what it was like to be in cahoots with his brother.</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>The cat division had withdrawn, and only Zheng Tan, Da Biao and The Monk remained by the gym doors.</p>

      <p>On the side lay Jiang Liuying, who had already been trussed up by Zheng Tan and the other cats like a rice dumpling...</p>

      <p>Zheng Tan gripped Wang Ling's small white paws, crystalline tears pooling in its eyes. "It was wonderful to be able to fight side by side with Immortal Meow this time! Don't worry, Immortal Meow, our engineering team will work around the clock to fix the hole!"</p>

      <p>Wang Ling: "..." He recalled the cat researchers in white gowns that he had seen in Zheng Tan's base... along with this engineering team, he wouldn't be surprised if in two or three years, they were able to build fucking missiles!</p>

      <p>Wang Ling didn't say anything and only kept his astonishment hidden in the depths of his heart as he waved goodbye to Zheng Tan and the other cats.</p>

      <p>Broken-hearted at his departure, they followed Wang Ling with their eyes and waved their little paws until he disappeared at the end of the road.</p>

      <p>To be able to fight alongside Immortal Meow was an honor that Zheng Tan felt was worthy of being recorded in the annals of cat history!</p>

      <p>This time, if it hadn't been for Zheng Tan's help, who knew what the consequences would have been.</p>

      <p>Wang Ling had barely left Zheng Tan's line of sight when he suddenly detected a familiar aura approaching.</p>

      <p>This was Lao Gudong's aura...</p>

      <p>Wang Ling stretched out his spiritual senses, and realized that not too far away, Lao Gudong and Director Xie were strolling along hand-in-hand and were drawing closer and closer.</p>

      <p>Wang Ming was also taken aback by the sudden appearance of these people, but very quickly he smiled and walked up to them himself. "Hello, teachers!"</p>

      <p>It was time for him to display his acting skills.</p>

      <p>Director Xie froze — why was there a family member in the school at this time? It was very strange, since to ensure that the spirit sword exchange meet proceeded smoothly tomorrow, she had notified all teachers-in-charge that they weren't allowed to keep students in after class, in order to prevent criminal elements disguised as guardians from fishing in troubled waters<sup>3</sup>.</p>
      
      <dfn><sup>3</sup>(This means to take advantage of a crisis for personal gain.)</dfn>

      <p>Therefore, Lao Gudong and Xie Huaichun were instantly vigilant against Wang Ming.</p>

      <p>This wasn't the strangest thing; the strangest was the unconscious girl tied up like a rice dumpling next to him. Was this cosplay or bondage play?</p>

      <p>"You are...?"</p>

      <p>"I'm Wang Ling's elder brother, Wang Xiaoer. I'm here to look for Wang Ling." Wang Ming produced his ID card.</p>

      <p>"Oh~~ Wang Ling's elder brother!"</p>

      <p>After checking the ID card and confirming Wang Ming's identity, Lao Gudong then turned his head in Director Xie's direction and said, "Hm, Wang Ling's my student, he's here for the spirit sword exchange meet."</p>

      <p>"Oh, I see..." Hearing Lao Gudong's explanation, Director Xie relaxed her guard. "What are you doing here at this time?"</p>

      <p>"I was looking for Wang Ling at first, but I encountered a Shadow Stream Gold Ribbon assassin before I could find him. I had to deal with her, which wasted some of my time." Wang Ming pointed at the "rice dumpling" on the ground.</p>

      <p>"Shadow Stream Gold Ribbon assassin..."</p>

      <p>Director Xie was dumbstruck! An assassin had snuck into the school without being noticed — this was a serious matter!</p>

      <p>"Do you have evidence that she is a Shadow Stream assassin?" Director Xie was still suspicious about the girl's identity, and Lao Gudong also had some doubts. They had no reason to completely trust a stranger's words.</p>

      <p>"If these two teachers don't believe me, have a look at the ribbon around this young lady's arm and verify the truth for yourselves." When Zheng Tan had been tying Jiang Liuying up, Wang Ming had had the cat expose part of her arm.</p>

      <p>The ribbon belonging to a Shadow Stream assassin was made from a special material and was direct proof of the killer's real identity.</p>

      <p>Lao Gudong inspected the ribbon on the girl's arm and was deeply shocked in his heart!</p>

      <p>...A real Gold Ribbon Shadow Stream assassin!</p>

      <p>He was unusually sensitive to things that had to do with the world of killers.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, looking at this girl tied up like a rice dumpling and judging by the boobs of mass destruction which were still too big to be covered up, Lao Gudong wondered... could this killer be the legendary Master of Shadow Stream?!</p>
