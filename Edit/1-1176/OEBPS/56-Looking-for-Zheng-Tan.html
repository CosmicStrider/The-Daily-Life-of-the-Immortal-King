  <h1>Chapter 56 Looking for Zheng Tan </h1>

  <div>

      

      <p>Wang Ling jumped nimbly into a spirit gathering tree and narrowed his eyes as he stared into the distance. A cat's body was very light and graceful and so was able to land with utmost gentleness. He wouldn't dare jump around casually like this as a human.</p>

      <p>However, he was also a bit unaccustomed to it.</p>

      <p>After transforming into a cat, his vision was significantly reduced. Of course, he was still more skillful in controlling this body in his shifted state than He Bufeng had been.</p>

      <p>What He Bufeng had used was merely the Advanced Transformation Spell while Wang Ling was using one of the Three Thousand Great Spells, the Great Transformation Spell.</p>

      <p>The effects of the two spells were similar, but the experience of each was different. A transformation using the Advanced Transformation Spell often required a long time to practice and become familiar with, and the smaller the object, the less time the transformation would hold. On the other hand, a transformation using the Great Transformation Spell could be held for a very long time and wasn't affected by the size of the transformed object. Furthermore, a person's soul wouldn't be made uncomfortable by the transformation.</p>

      <p>Bluntly speaking, one was just from an advanced spell book and the other from the Three Thousand Great Spells. That was the difference.</p>

      <p>Standing at the top of the spirit gathering tree, Wang Ling spread out his spiritual senses to track down the aura of those kittens. Before, he had heard several cats mention that the cat boss in this area was called Zheng Tan. If he wanted to command the stray cats here, no one apart from the cat boss Zheng Tan would be able to rouse them into action.</p>

      <p>The management of stray cats was very strict and their rules were derived from the team management system that Wang Ling had popularized among the stray cats back then. He was somewhat surprised though that these cats were still strictly abiding by the management system long after he had left the cat world; there were always trivial squabbles over territory and natural food resources between different groups, large and small, but in times of crisis, the cats would present a very strong united front as they banded together against a common enemy.</p>

      <p>Wang Ling didn't intentionally pay attention to or care about these things. It was just that every day on his way to school, he would pick up the thoughts of the stray cats on the street corner through his Mind-Reading Ability, so he was aware of all this.</p>

      <p>Of course, he had never thought that his casual deeds back then would actually bear such bountiful fruit... even to the extent of playing an important role in saving the world.</p>

      <p>There was only one hour left to the destruction of the planet.</p>

      <p>The key to the whole thing now was finding Zheng Tan, and through Zheng Tan's strength, find Wang Ming.</p>

      <p>Perhaps no one could have imagined...</p>

      <p>The world would actually be saved by these stray cats that had been abandoned by people in the past.</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>Back then, after popularizing the concept of team management among the stray cats and solving their living space and food issues in Peiyuan district, Wang Ling had chosen to retire. He still remembered quite a number of the cat bosses in the district, but most of them had been cat leaders from the first generation.</p>

      <p>Among them, the ones that had impressed him the most were the three cat tyrants called "The Little Tigers": the thunderbolt tiger Tang Shi, the small handsome tiger Song Ci and the baby tiger Yuan Qu <sup>1</sup> .</p>

      <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The pinyin for Tang Shi, Song Ci and Yuan Qu are homonyms that, respectively, refer to poetry from the Tang Dynasty, poetry from the Song Dynasty, and a particular type of poetry form popular in the Yuan Dynasty)</dfn>

      <p>These three cat tyrants had already become old cats who now pulled the strings behind the scenes. In light of their scale of expansion over the years, these three cat tyrants were probably each in charge of a cat army now.</p>

      <p>As for Zheng Tan, while its rank might be low, as the cat boss of the stray cats at Number 59 High School, it could still be considered a leader among cats.</p>

      <p>There was a good saying that one shouldn't disregard the village chief as the cadre itself <sup>2</sup> . Wang Ling didn't discriminate against the village chief, nor would he discriminate against a cat...</p>

      <dfn><sup>2</sup>('Don't disregard the village chief as the cadre itself' can be interpreted as not looking down on someone's status.)</dfn>

      <p>School was already over for the day, and back among the sakura trees, there were students scattered here and there who were looking at the flowers; Wang Ling could smell the acrid scent of love in the air.</p>

      <p>Tracking the auras for a few hundred meters, he very quickly found the cats that had been rolling around under the sakura trees yesterday.</p>

      <p>These cats were all crossbreeds and had been abandoned at a very young age; Wang Ling wasn't a cat expert, and couldn't tell from just looking at their appearances what mix of breeds these cats were.</p>

      <p>But all this wasn't important. If he wanted to find Zheng Tan, he could only get these cats to act as his guide. He had never seen Zheng Tan before and didn't know what its aura was like, otherwise he could have tracked it down and directly teleported himself to its location.</p>

      <p>After some consideration, Wang Ling took the initiative to stroll toward them.</p>

      <p>As he drew closer to the cats, he again heard what they were saying in their hearts.</p>

      <p>The big cat that was the leader: "Look! Here comes a girl!"</p>

      <p>Second Cat: "Wow! It's a black-and-white Persian cat!"</p>

      <p>Third Cat: "Its fur is really beautiful, it must be a beauty among cats!"</p>

      <p>Fourth Cat: "Don't tell me it wants to hook up with Boss?"</p>

      <p>Big Cat smiled. "Otherwise? Beautiful cats are only compatible with the strong!"</p>

      <p>Wang Ling: "..." Damn it! He was fucking male!</p>

      <p>He now thought it had really been a big mistake back then choosing to transform into such a beautiful Persian cat.</p>

      <p>Seeing Wang Ling walking toward it step by step, Big Cat felt that its fur was a little dirty and coarse from the rolling around it had been doing just now, so it crouched down and bent over to begin licking itself everywhere; even its own anus didn't escape the treatment.</p>

      <p><em>Bloody hell, this is obviously even more coarse, okay?!</em></p>

      <p>Wang Ling wasn't in the mood to bother too much with these cats. He stared at them and directly communicated with them telepathically. "Where is Zheng Tan?"</p>

      <p>When his deep voice sounded in the minds of the four cats, they instantly looked embarrassed - bloody hell! They had gotten the gender wrong!</p>

      <p>This cat was actually male!</p>

      <p>Big Cat's face was instantly full of disappointment as if it had been rejected by a female kitty. Its head drooped and it collapsed onto the ground. "...Why is it male?"</p>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p><em>Do you fucking need to be so sad about it!</em></p>

      <p><em>Besides, this isn't the point at all, hey!</em></p>

      <p><em>The point is where is Zheng Tan!</em></p>

      <p>Wang Ling felt that these cats' nerves were shit; they had actually completely ignored the fact that he had spoken to them telepathically.</p>

      <p>Big Cat lifted its paws weakly and said sadly, "There is no point to the life of a cat without a beauty to accompany it!"</p>

      <p>Wang Ling was utterly speechless. "..."</p>

      <p>Fortunately, he had made preparations beforehand.</p>

      <p>A spirit light flashed on the ground, then several salted fish-flavored crispy noodle snack packets appeared.</p>

      <p>These were all Wang Ling had. He had initially intended to secretly enjoy them at midnight when there was no one else around.</p>

      <p>"Wow! Limited edition salted fish-flavored crispy noodle snack!"</p>

      <p>The eyes of the cats suddenly lit up. Big Cat rolled and jumped to its feet, and unrestrainedly rubbed Wang Ling's head with its paws. "Hahahaha! Brother, you're very clever! Since you've asked us so sincerely, I'll take you to Boss!"</p>

      <p>"..." This cat really changed face faster than flipping through a book.</p>

      <p>Wang Ling sighed in his heart; it was said that stray cats were all foodies, which turned out to indeed be true.</p>

      <p>Seeing this big cat put the three limited edition crispy noodle snack packets into the cosmic space on the belly band it was wearing, his heart bled...</p>

      <p>At the same time, he also had some misgivings about how the cat world currently worked; he hadn't expected these low-level cadres to actually begin openly accepting bribes just a few years after his withdrawal! This matter had to be strictly dealt with and required serious reorganization!</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>After about five minutes, with the four cats taking the lead, Wang Ling entered a small, unremarkable opening in a corner of the sakura tree garden. This entry was fully blocked by two thick and solid sakura trees, and was very difficult to find from the viewpoint of a human.</p>

      <p>After entering the small opening, he found himself on a residential lane. On the east side of the lane was a street sign that said "Dahuang Road."</p>

      <p>Following Big Cat, he came to an old willow tree with a trunk so wide that five or six people holding hands around it still wouldn't be enough to completely encircle its girth.</p>

      <p>This tree had put down roots here for at least several hundred years; the rumor was that it had been struck by lightning before, but it hadn't fallen and still towered firm and upright.</p>

      <p>The cats climbed adeptly to the top of the tree, then turned to look at Wang Ling. They then turned their gazes in the direction of a very small tree hole — Zheng Tan's stray cat base was in that hole...</p>
