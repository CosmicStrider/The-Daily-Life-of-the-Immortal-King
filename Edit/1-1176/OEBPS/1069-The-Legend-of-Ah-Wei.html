  <h1>Chapter 1069 The Legend of Ah Wei</h1>

  <div>

    <p>What Er Ha said wasn't an empty threat, but the truth.</p>

    <p>As has already been explained countless times, Heavenly Dao stressed the principle of equivalence. For those who didn't finish their homework properly, didn't do it all, or even copied homework during their mortal lives, they would automatically enter a remedial classroom after they died to finish the homework they hadn't completed. Unless they finished all the homework they missed in their nine years of compulsory education, they couldn't enter the natural cycle of reincarnation.</p>

    <p>Although the little girl was young, she looked like she should already be in her fourth year of primary school. Primary schools nowadays also assigned a lot of homework; whether this girl had finished hers or not, Er Ha didn't know. In any case, if she hadn't, she would most likely still have to do it after she went to heaven.</p>

    <p>Even as a spirit, it was still better to be an educated one. Only then could one be reincarnated as a human. If your breadth of knowledge was lacking, there were other reincarnation paths that awaited you, like the animal path, the hungry ghost path and so on...</p>

    <p>Of course, the Heavenly Dao's principle of equivalent exchange varied from person to person. Some might have finished their schoolwork but indulged too much in debauchery, which meant that they would also have to become completely abstinent as retribution - this was crueler than make-up homework. That was because they would be thrown into a confined room for a few years without WIFI or smart phones! They could only face the wall and ponder their misdeeds!</p>

    <p>Seeing that it had scared the little girl into crying, Er Ha became a little embarrassed.</p>

    <p>"Little girl, this big brother lied to you."</p>

    <p>"You're lying again... You're clearly a dog!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Crouching down to comfort her daughter, the woman got to her feet after the little girl's sobs gradually subsided, and she bowed to Wang Ling and Er Ha. "Exalted immortals, what do you want to ask me..."</p>

    <p>"The malicious spirit you mentioned earlier - what's that about?" Er Ha got straight to the point and asked.</p>

    <p>"It's like this: around four days ago, a black spirit suddenly appeared inside the cemetery. It lingered around and caught quite a number of spirits that left the protection of the tombstones."</p>

    <p>"What happened to them?"</p>

    <p>"They were all devoured by the black spirit..."</p>

    <p>Hearing that, both Wang Ling and Er Ha were silent for a moment.</p>

    <p>From the looks of it, this black spirit was very much in line with Shadow Dao. Maybe it was the shadow of that undertaker, which had escaped? Bestowed with the power of Shadow Dao, it was as if the shadows of these people had souls of their own and were entrusted with the will of their hosts, accomplishing their subconscious desires on their behalf.</p>

    <p>An undertaker's job was to apply make-up for the dead, and some of them might have indecent and wicked thoughts about the souls of the dead. In the cultivation world, cemetery workers had to undergo a strict process before they could take up the job, since some evil spells worked by absorbing spirits to enhance a person.</p>

    <p>And cemetery workers were at the right place and time to perform such evil magic.</p>

    <p>Something like this had happened hundreds of years ago.</p>

    <p>A person used a curse spell to incessantly send "awsl<sup>1</sup>" bullet messages scrolling across the screens of major videos, and those who saw it often replied jokingly: "Mass burial for Ah Wei"...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A Chinese online acronym for "ah wo si le" (0 h, I'm dead), in this case adapted into "ah wei si le" (Ah Wei's dead).)</dfn>

    <p>In fact, a lot of Ah Weis with that "Wei" character in their names died when they saw this curse bullet message... Their spirits were absorbed by the curse caster. When the police found the curse caster in the end, they discovered that he was a worker at a cemetery.</p>

    <p>There would inevitably be workers who would become unbalanced and turn into devils from working in this sort of environment long term; as soon as their minds were unguarded, evil intent would seize the opening and enter.</p>

    <p>Coupled with the natural "halo of discrimination" that cemetery workers wore, this devilish intent would grow stronger.</p>

    <p>"Many thanks." Wang Ling thanked the mother and daughter, then snapped his fingers at the sky.</p>

    <p>In the blink of an eye, the guiding golden light of Heavenly Dao shone on them.</p>

    <p>"Daughter, Heavenly Dao has come to guide us..."</p>

    <p>"Mom, can we be reincarnated?!"</p>

    <p>Startled by the golden light, they immediately clung to each other and cried with joy.</p>

    <p>They had no idea when Heavenly Dao would take them away, and had been feeling apprehensive in the last few days after seeing that black spirit. They never thought that this brother with the indistinct features would actually help them.</p>

    <p>With just a snap of his fingers, he could actually prompt Heavenly Dao to come and help them... Was this brother Heavenly Dao itself that had descended?</p>

    <p>Feeling extremely gratified, the woman hurriedly knelt before Wang Ling and had her daughter do the same. Feeling a little embarrassed, Wang Ling had them stand, and then watched as they were finally guided by the Heavenly Dao golden light and sent for reincarnation.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling rubbed his hands together and predicted that this pair of mother and daughter would be sisters in their next lives and live in a well-off family where they wanted for nothing.</p>

    <p>Of course, Wang Ling had gotten Heavenly Dao to collect this mother and daughter pair before their time for no other reason than their kindness and unfortunate lot. They had drowned saving a boy who had fallen into the water. After their deaths, the boy's family didn't acknowledge what they had done; maybe they were worried that the family of the two would demand compensation, or maybe there was some other reason. The spirits of the mother and daughter thus couldn't rest in peace after their deaths.</p>

    <p>Just now, they were still drenched from head to toe.</p>

    <p>This was why Wang Ling decided to lend them a hand.</p>

    <p>And now, the priority was to uncover that black spirit.</p>

    <p>"Sirs, may I help you?"</p>

    <p>At that moment, a cold voice rang out behind Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Turning his head, Wang Ling saw a hunched old man with thinning hair and snow-white makeup smiling at him; his smile was ghastly and creepy.</p>

    <p>Most importantly, this person didn't have a shadow!</p>

    <p>"It's him." Narrowing its eyes, Er Ha could clearly sense the malevolence coming off this old man. Coupled with the fact that he didn't have a shadow, this person should be the undertaker they were looking for.</p>

    <p>"What a pity..."</p>

    <p>A regretful expression on his face, the undertaker watched as the mother and daughter ascended to heaven via the Heavenly Dao golden light. "They were going to be my dinner today; I didn't expect Heavenly Dao to extradite them... The spirits who aren't honored taste the best. I could have brainwashed them and they might have turned into evil spirits; it would've been great if they became my subordinates."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling frowned. This person had completely fallen onto the depraved path!</p>

    <p>Just as he thought, Ah Nuan's power of Shadow aroused a person's subconscious wickedness. This evil intent was usually hidden and wouldn't break out, but once it was evoked, the accumulation of this evil power would erupt in a flash, like a blood vessel that had been clogged for a long time suddenly unblocked!</p>

    <p>Thus, this undertaker was in fact also a victim... and the blame should be placed on Ah Nuan's head...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was thinking of a countermeasure.</p>

    <p>The evil intent had already taken root deep in the undertaker's bones; even his shadow could be detached, which was completely different from Father Zheng and Wu Yuanji.</p>

    <p>The power of the Great Seal Spell was no longer enough.</p>

    <p>How about the Great Purification Spell?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling swiftly poked the undertaker's forehead with his finger.</p>

    <p>But something completely unexpected happened â€” the evil on this undertaker wasn't purified in the least. Conversely, his aura got a huge boost!</p>

    <p>What was going on?</p>
