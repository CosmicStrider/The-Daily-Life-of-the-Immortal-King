  <h1>Chapter 828 A Gift From Wang Ling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Calling the parents was a common skill which teachers-in-charge had in their arsenal. Usually, students might be unsettled when their parents were contacted, but sometimes this trick worked extraordinarily well to make students rectify their behavior. Junior high school was a rebellious period, when students reacted badly to teachers calling their parents. The situation was a little better in high school, and Teacher Pan always believed that children in the elite class in particular should have strong mental endurance!</p>

    <p>Of course, when a teacher-in-charge said they would call a student's parents, this was in many cases purely a scare tactic.</p>

    <p>As long as a student corrected their attitude, the teacher would let it go later.</p>

    <p>But Teacher Pan was different...</p>

    <p>As a pioneer teacher at Number 60 High School, it could only be said that Teacher Pan was Teacher Pan... If she said she was going to call the parents, she meant it! And she always kept her word!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling understood Teacher Pan's character too well.</p>

    <p>After all, he had known her for nearly a semester.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan choosing to call his parents at this time was undoubtedly using him as a warning to the rest of the class.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling really couldn't protest, and had no way to do so, because he really had been MIA at the time! If he had known earlier, he would have hurried up and solved the problem. He originally thought that this Ultimate King of Killers might pull out some sort of awesome trick, so he wanted to wait and see for a bit; in the end, he was greatly disappointed.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling decided that if he ran into something like this again in the future, it was still better to directly use a slap to solve the problem.</p>

    <p>Now things had gotten troublesome again.</p>

    <p>As Grade One, Class Three's mascot who had just escaped the jaws of death, Wang Ling felt that Teacher Pan shouldn't treat him like this - couldn't she show him, this pitiful little thing, a little more concern?!</p>

    <p>But Teacher Pan's reprimand was very effective. Upon hearing that she was going to call Wang Ling's parents, Guo Hao and Chen Chao, who had been messing around and passing notes earlier, promptly stopped and bolted upright like terracotta warriors.</p>

    <p>Finally, Teacher Pan's last Dao talisman lesson of the semester ended on a harmonious and quiet note...</p>

    <p>After class, Teacher Pan returned to the office with the test papers in her arms.</p>

    <p>With Chen Chao taking the lead, the other students went up to Wang Ling one by one to pat him on the shoulder.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "My condolences, my Ling."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "My condolences..."</p>

    <p>Su Xiao: "Classmate Wang Ling, my condolences... your parents won't beat you, will they..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought about saying that they couldn't beat him, but in the end remained silent.</p>

    <p>Father and Mother Wang certainly would never beat him.</p>

    <p>First of all, any sort of violence was wrong. Especially when it came to educating children, you should explain with reason and move them emotionally. Good communication was still the most important thing. If the people in this world could properly communicate with and understand each other, wouldn't a lot of disasters be avoided?</p>

    <p>Like the bus that fell into the river a while ago <sup>1</sup> , which was a typical case.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Referring to when a passenger
attacked a driver, causing him
to lose control of the bus and
resulting in the deaths of at
least 13 people ..)</dfn>

    <p>The world was so beautiful, why did you have to be so grumpy?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>This wasn't the first time that Teacher Pan had looked for Wang Ling's parents. After all, she had specially paid a visit to the Wang family's small villa before, and Lord Diulei had attended the last parent-teacher meeting. In exchange, Wang Ling had guarded the stone ghost mask and obstructed the Ten Saints at Lord Diulei's villa.</p>

    <p>If Teacher Pan just called Father Wang, then things wouldn't be so troublesome...</p>

    <p>But after she visited the Wang family's small villa the last time, Teacher Pan had specially saved Old Man Wang's phone number. She called Old Man Wang directly this time, so there was no way for Wang Ling to fake anything!</p>

    <p>So when Lord Diulei found out, he also felt helpless.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, go well..." Lord Diulei sent Wang Ling a message.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>In Lord Diulei's mind, Old Man Wang was the strongest in the Wang family's small villa. Furthermore, Lord Diulei was still trying to comprehend the secret in the broccoli until now.</p>

    <p>By the time school was over, the matter of Ultimate King of Killers had pretty much been dealt with.</p>

    <p>Due to the Ten Generals' presence plus the help Wang Ling had given, the sect's founding ceremony had on the whole proceeded smoothly. As for this interlude with King of Killers, it was the chief of the Office of Strategic Deception, Lord Diulei himself, who personally took him down in a satisfactory ending. However, because the outside world hadn't seen what had happened inside the intrinsic spirit field, Lord Diulei and the Ten Generals' collective response to the news media was that it was General Yi who had defeated Ultimate King of Killers.</p>

    <p>The Ten Generals, however, saw the entire truth of the situation from beginning to end.</p>

    <p>All of them very clearly saw exactly how strong the chief of this new Office of Strategic Deception, the legendary Great Death-Courting Senior, was!</p>

    <p>After this, the Office of Strategic Deception and Huaxiu Alliance were bound to work even closer together; in any case, Huaxiu Alliance was the Office of Strategic Deception's largest investing shareholder to begin with.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was aware that given Lord Diulei's current strength and his frequent contact with these experts, he was in danger of being exposed sooner or later.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling decided to give him a little push from behind...</p>

    <p>It was just that even Lord Diulei wasn't aware of this.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had initially planned to attend the Office of Strategic Deception's dinner banquet that evening, but since Teacher Pan wanted to call his family, he could only give up on the idea...</p>

    <p>The banquet was different from the mid-afternoon celebration; neither the media nor sect leaders from sects below Sky level would participate.</p>

    <p>Only the major Sky-level forces could attend the Office of Strategic Deception's banquet.</p>

    <p>The Ten Generals were also extremely cautious in dealing with Ultimate King of Killers; only General Yi and Marshal Jiang were left behind at the scene, while the other eight went to keep an eye on Ultimate King of Killers as he was escorted away.</p>

    <p>This arrangement appeared a little excessive, but in fact it was absolutely necessary; this could be considered giving this Ultimate King of Killers, as the Dark Network's number one player, the last bit of face.</p>

    <p>Ultimate King of Killers's life hung by a thread now. Like Wang Zhen, who had been restricted by Heavenly Dao, he couldn't use any spells now.</p>

    <p>Because in the final instant before Wang Ling extricated his soul, he cast a Heavenly Dao restriction on Ultimate King of Killers.</p>

    <p>Now, Ultimate King of Killers didn't have the strength to struggle anymore.</p>

    <p>After discussion, the Ten Generals didn't put King of Killers to death right away, because they wanted to use him to ferret out the player behind the scenes... though the Ten Generals basically had some idea who this person was...</p>

    <p>The banquet was about to start. Er Ha and Xiao Yin were sitting in the inner seating area.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "What's on the menu tonight? Woof!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin covered his mouth and said in a very low voice, "Appetizer: Heavenly Dao broccoli mixed salad. Main course: broccoli spaghetti with braised broccoli. Soup: fresh broccoli soup. Dessert: Heavenly Dao broccoli snow ice... Of course, there are other dishes, but the ones I mentioned will definitely be served."</p>

    <p>Er Ha had a relaxed expression on its face.</p>

    <p>For some reason, whenever it heard the word "broccoli" now, it felt as calm as the surface of an ancient well.</p>

    <p>Broccoli was a green vegetable. Er Ha was also green! What a match!</p>

    <p>"Everyone, this Heavenly Dao broccoli was developed and planted by our Office of Strategic Deception! Let me eat first as a toast!" After saying this, Lord Diulei picked up a broccoli with his chopsticks and put it in his mouth.</p>

    <p>All the guests stared at the broccoli mixed salad in front of them with "it looks tasteless" expressions on their faces...</p>

    <p>But just as Lord Diulei swallowed the broccoli in his mouth, there was a tremendous sound of an explosion in the sky.</p>

    <p>For one moment, all the cultivators in the entire world froze as they cocked their heads at a forty-five degree angle to look up at the sky.</p>
