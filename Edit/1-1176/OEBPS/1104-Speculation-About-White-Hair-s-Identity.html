  <h1>Chapter 1104 Speculation About White Hair's Identity</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ming didn't have enough clues to figure out who on earth this White Hair was and how he was connected to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Wang Ling in fact already had a rough idea, but it was only speculation.</p>

    <p>"Fate Dao" was a special Great Dao which he had learned from Bai Youquan. Although it was very complicated, it actually wasn't as difficult to learn as Wang Ling had imagined. After mastering Fate Dao, Wang Ling had a brand new understanding of the three timelines of past, present and future as well as of parallel worlds.</p>

    <p>He could deploy strength from whatever parallel world he wanted.</p>

    <p>The Fate Dao which Wang Ling controlled was actually different from that of other people.</p>

    <p>His world was under his control, and the stories which happened in the other worlds could only be regarded as his "clones"- no matter their personalities or whatever happened, they absolutely couldn't act against his will.</p>

    <p>This was the capability born of comprehending the profound truth of Fate Dao.</p>

    <p>What Bai Youquan knew only skimmed the surface.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling came up with a theory about White Hair's identity.</p>

    <p>Everything actually made sense if this White Hair was one of his clones which had split off from the original world before Wang Ling had mastered Fate Dao.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling felt that this White Hair wasn't as strong as he had thought.</p>

    <p>If he really was so amazing, why not just directly destroy the world?</p>

    <p>After coming to this world, he resurrected dead enemies and created the black shadow army — what was the point of going to all this useless trouble?</p>

    <p>It could only be because there was another unknown master plan behind it.</p>

    <p>This was currently just speculation on Wang Ling's part, but given the minor clues and evidence which Wang Ming had provided, the possibility was fairly high.</p>

    <p>The more Wang Ling pondered, the more he felt this explanation made sense.</p>

    <p>Because so far, he had yet to find any traces of White Hair.</p>

    <p>There was nothing that Wang Ling couldn't find on this earth.</p>

    <p>But if this person had popped up from some other world, it did make sense that Wang Ling couldn't find him.</p>

    <p>After all, different stories happened in each world at every moment, and the laws and times of each world were completely different. They used spirit qi in this world, while other worlds might use some natural energy source as a substitute, like battle qi, horse qi<sup>1</sup>, immortal qi and so on.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(From a satire of the Chinese novel "Battle Through The Heavens.")</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't sleep soundly that night.</p>

    <p>Another person who couldn't sleep was Xia Ming, who lay awake in the hospital.</p>

    <p>This was a youngster's typical nature.</p>

    <p>Xia Ming was unwilling to accept the outcome of his duel with Wang Ling, and felt that Wang Ling had defeated him purely by luck.</p>

    <p>But he just couldn't figure out what body technique the other party had used.</p>

    <p>Why did every punch Xia Ming throw ultimately wind up hitting himself instead?</p>

    <p>Why was he the only one who got hurt during the fight?!</p>

    <p>He had claimed that he wouldn't let Wang Ling off, but he actually hadn't been thinking anything too vicious. He just wanted to find a proper chance to fight Wang Ling again!</p>

    <p>Fair and square! Secretly compare notes! Not for Sun Rong! Just to vent a little!</p>

    <p>After lying in the hospital for a while, Xia Ming felt that his head had already cooled down a bit.</p>

    <p>That afternoon, that Zhang from the finance department came on behalf of Huaguo Water Curtain Group to ask that he stay away from Sun Rong, for a price...</p>

    <p>Xia Ming felt that Huaguo Water Curtain Group might have misunderstood him, and so he turned down the man's request on the spot. However, Xia Ming agreed that he would no longer disturb Sun Rong in public, and he would act according to the principle of fair competition in the future.</p>

    <p>Xia Ming contemplated for half a day in the hospital and concluded that the biggest reason why Sun Rong didn't like him was probably because he wasn't outstanding enough.</p>

    <p>If he could be outstanding enough...</p>

    <p>Everything might go a lot smoother!</p>

    <p>As Xia Ming tossed and turned in the hospital ward at that moment, he only had one thought in his mind: he just wanted his injuries to heal more quickly, and return to his school life as soon as possible and study hard — he would study how to fight Wang Ling, and then give him a sound thrashing!</p>

    <p>It was already two in the morning, but Xia Ming didn't feel the least bit tired.</p>

    <p>He stared at the ceiling, lost in thought.</p>

    <p>At that moment, the door to his ward suddenly opened. Thinking that it was the nurse doing the rounds, Xia Ming closed his eyes and ignored her.</p>

    <p>A very low and magnetic male voice rang out, sounding out of place in the ward. "Xia Ming, descendant of Ancient Divine Clan, how are you feeling?"</p>

    <p>This clearly wasn't the female nurse's voice.</p>

    <p>Xia Ming thought it was some visitor, and he half-turned on his side, one hand already gripping the call button. He was in no mood at all to deal with this visitor, and his tone was quite impatient. "Bro, it's the dead of night, can't you tell the time???" Who would visit a patient at midnight?! Only a lunatic or a psycho!</p>

    <p>"May I advise you to not do anything, Student Xia Ming, or I can't guarantee the safety of the little nurse who'll be coming by later." Along with the voice, Xia Ming saw a dark shadow as thin as gossamer thread which gripped his hand firmly.</p>

    <p>In just a split second, Xia Ming couldn't move; there was an immense pressure on his body, as if he were tied down by some incomprehensible power. It was extremely similar to sleep paralysis — although he couldn't move, he was wide awake!</p>

    <p>He could sense that the dark shadow was talking to him.</p>

    <p>"Who on earth are you..." Xia Ming already realized at that moment that the other party hadn't come with good intentions; the other party definitely wasn't here to see how he was doing, but for something else.</p>

    <p>"I'm Nightmare."</p>

    <p>The dark shadow laughed. "I am everyone's nightmare."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean?" Xia Ming was baffled.</p>

    <p>"You don't need to know what it means, but the one thing I can tell you is that I'm here to help grant your wish." The voice of that mysterious shadow sounded again. "Do you know what you lacked the most in your defeat?"</p>

    <p>"Strength..." answered Xia Ming.</p>

    <p>"That's right. You are indeed too weak." The shadow laughed. "So, I can help you become stronger, Student Xia Ming."</p>

    <p>"What rubbish is this?" Xia Ming said.</p>

    <p>"People from the Ancient Divine Clan have unique physiques. Furthermore, your physique is in fact one-in-million, even in the Ancient Divine Clan: you can absorb the power of all the underground heavenly veins. As long as you absorb this power, defeating that Student Wang will be a piece of cake. What do you think? Do you want to be stronger? Shall we make a deal, man to man?"</p>
