  <h1>Chapter 1155 Spirit-Summoning Technique Showdown</h1>

  <div>

    <p>As the saying went, the greatest truths were the simplest. As a compulsory subject in the first semester of the Foundation Establishment cultivation high school freshmen year, it went without saying how important the Spirit-Summoning Technique was. Recalling how Wang Ling had summoned Er Ha by accident back then, and seeing the technique now, everyone instantly felt a sense of familiarity.</p>

    <p>They were now under siege by four high schools. After Zhu Hanyun, as the vanguard, lost, Nan Yixiu immediately thought of using the Spirit-Summoning Technique for the joint siege.</p>

    <p>There were forty people in total from the four high schools. When they joined forces, the number of spirits they could summon with the technique was no less than a few hundred!</p>

    <p>While using these spirits as a vanguard force might not cause the students of Number 60 High any injuries, it was more than enough to sound them out.</p>

    <p>Besides, as a basic spell, the Spirit-Summoning Technique didn't consume much spirit energy.</p>

    <p>After repeated summonings, there was a massive horde of spirits.</p>

    <p>When these spirits of varying colors surrounded the foot of the mountain, it was a ghastly sight right out of a sci-fi blockbuster film.</p>

    <p>Nine Dragon Mountain was a modern national natural conservatory for spirit plants and spirit beasts. The spirits that could be summoned weren't weak; the weakest was still a level six spirit beast. Although Zhu Hanyun's arm was broken, it didn't affect his ability to summon spirits with his other hand â€” he summoned a level four three-headed fire lion!</p>

    <p>For a Foundation Establishment cultivator to summon a level four spirit was very remarkable.</p>

    <p>It could only be said, as expected of Zhu Hanyun, Titan High's team captain.</p>

    <p>While his vanguard operation had failed, it couldn't hide how outstanding he was.</p>

    <p>"As expected of Captain Zhu. With this level four fire lion as the vanguard of the spirit army, we'll definitely destroy Number 60 High's troop formation!" When Nan Yixiu saw the results of everyone's summonings, he felt that the situation was firmly in their hands.</p>

    <p>Although each summoned spirit certainly wasn't as strong as the real thing, and only had twenty percent of the original's fighting strength, these spirits should be more than enough to deal with the Number 60 High team who was on top of the mountain.</p>

    <p>The four high schools were currently working together, and it was understandable that they would flatter each other. But Zhu Hanyun, who had experienced how odd Number 60 High was for himself, felt unhappy for some reason when he heard Nan Yixiu's overblown praise.</p>

    <p>He felt that Number 60 High was hiding a lot of talent, and that they had underestimated this school.</p>

    <p>Zhu Hanyun dimly recalled, before coming for this competition, that their Headmaster Liu Tian had told them not to look down on the other schools, especially Number 60 High!</p>

    <p>When Zhu Hanyun recalled the headmaster's advice, he instantly felt that the words were wise.</p>

    <p>At that moment, the four high schools were working together to surround and attack Number 60 High. They had the superior numbers, which seemed to give them the upper hand. However, Number 60 High had now firmly established their position on the mountain, and had successfully set up camp. If the four schools stuck to their original battle plan and sent out troops, only to encounter unusual maneuvers, it would in fact be very hard to predict the outcome.</p>

    <p>While they had the advantage in numbers, too many people was also a shortcoming... They had yet to occupy an advantageous position, and so had yet to effectively combine their resources together. If it became a war of attrition, the tables could turn on them.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On top of the mountain, Number 60 High also swiftly formulated a strategy in the face of the spirits that were gradually surrounding the foot of the mountain. Given their disadvantageous situation, they decided to hold fast to their position.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High also had Mysterious Sea, and wasn't worried at all that the people at the foot of the mountain might use a dirty tactic like cutting off their water source. Mysterious Sea was very strong; if necessary, Sun Rong could use the "South-North Water Diversion" move to create a route from a nearby river to their feet.</p>

    <p>In fact, the moment the spirits appeared, Gu Shunzhi had already come up with 16,820 ways to instantly get rid of them. If he did that, however, he would expose his true strength... After all, they had come to Number 60 High to learn from Wang Ling how to keep a low profile.</p>

    <p>"Since they're using the Spirit-Summoning Technique, we might as well do the same," Chen Chao suggested at that moment. Everyone could use the Spirit-Summoning Technique, so what it came down to was sheer luck. Zhu Hanyun was able to summon a level four three-headed fire lion. At the same level of spirit energy, Chen Chao felt that he should be able to summon something that was around the same level.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi: "Using the Spirit-Summoning Technique, is it..."</p>

    <p>In fact, it wasn't impossible.</p>

    <p>But Gu Shunzhi, Wang Zhen and the others knew very well that if they used this strategy... it carried risks...</p>

    <p>They could control their powers, so doing a precise summoning absolutely wasn't a problem.</p>

    <p>But god only knew what frightening thing their Ling Zhenren would summon.</p>

    <p>"Then that's settled! I'll go first!" As the captain, Sun Rong raised her hand. She swiftly did the hand seals, and spirit energy gathered in her palms, before she slammed her hands down on the ground!</p>

    <p>A spirit-summoning array quickly lit up on the ground, and a huge, pure white flower appeared in front of their eyes.</p>

    <p>"What's this?"</p>

    <p>"It looks like the snow hibiscus on Nine Dragon Mountain's Ice Peak! It's a level four spirit plant, and has some spiritual intelligence!"</p>

    <p>"As expected of Captain Sun Rong!" Chen Chao and the others marveled.</p>

    <p>Then they all began to summon spirits.</p>

    <p>The spirit that Guo Hao summoned this time was a giant heaven-capturing spirit elephant. While its size wasn't a problem, it was too heavy, so it didn't necessarily move quickly. Besides, it was a level six spirit elephant, which didn't have formidable fighting strength overall.</p>

    <p>"Ah, how unlucky." Guo Hao sighed. He hadn't gotten a great result at all with his summoning in class before, so he had secretly practiced the Spirit-Summoning Technique for a long time. In the end, when it came to the actual competition, he had nothing to show for it.</p>

    <p>"It's a matter of luck sometimes in a competition; maybe you aren't cut out for a major competition." When it was Xia Ming's turn, he sneered. He was very confident in his Spirit-Summoning Technique. After obtaining extraordinary power from that mysterious white-haired young man, whatever he summoned would surely be unmatched.</p>

    <p>He had to put on a good show in front of Sun Rong!</p>

    <p>With that in mind, he began to do the hand seals in one smooth flow.</p>

    <p>To everyone's surprise, however, when Xia Ming slapped his hands down on the ground to activate the spirit-summoning array, a huge array appeared...</p>

    <p>What was going on?</p>

    <p>The people at the foot of the mountain were stupefied. This spirit-summoning array was too big and rare... It actually burst out beyond Fire Peak and covered half the mountain, like a hula hoop.</p>

    <p>Xia Ming himself was frightened by this scale. He had just wanted to show off in front of the girl he liked, but the situation now was a little beyond his expectations.</p>

    <p><em>Boom!</em> With a loud rumble, a giant lava hand, as big as a mountain, emerged from the massive spirit-summoning array...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Looking at this giant hand, Wang Ling sighed.</p>

    <p>The hair on the back of this giant hand instantly stood up...</p>
