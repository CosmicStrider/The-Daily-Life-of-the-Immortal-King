  <h1>Chapter 199 You, Zhenren, Are Zhenren </h1>

  <div>

    <p>There wasn't a single cloud in the sky over the square at the moment. Dharmaraja took off his goggles and threw them aside. His head was covered in sweat and he gasped for breath as he bent forward with his hands on his knees.</p>

    <p>After these three punches, Dharmaraja was now absolutely clear on one truth â€” the gap between his and Ling Zhenren's strength was way too big; it already couldn't be described as a moat. Instead, they were clearly separated by a sea!</p>

    <p>A particular saying put it best: <em>you, Zhenren, are Zhenren; you, the master, are the master <sup>1</sup></em> <em>...</em></p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is adapted from a Chinese catchphrase, "you the master are forever the master," which is equivalent to high praise.)</dfn>

    <p>Dharmaraja was thoroughly convinced. "Senior Ling is really too strong... I've lost!"</p>

    <p>He couldn't help sighing; it wasn't just any ordinary gap between them. His explosive power had been raised to its full extent in the ten-layer godly thunder inheritance. Its devastating pressure had made Immortal Toya sweat; standing on the side, he hadn't been able to clearly see Dharmaraja's moves at all. Yet somehow, the punch had been stopped, just like that.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, Ling Zhenren had just easily and casually raised his hand, and in the blink of an eye had neutralized this fierce attack.</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja thoroughly conceded defeat; when he came back to his senses, he realized that his whole body was enveloped in a faint and soft golden light, like a godly robe. "...What's this?"</p>

    <p>"Before your last punch, Senior Ling covered us with the protective golden light of his Sage Body," Immortal Toya explained; watching the battle from the side, he had seen everything clearly. "Otherwise, given the impact of your punch just now, you wouldn't just have been unable to break Senior Ling's Golden Body, you would also have become slag from the backlash."</p>

    <p>When Dharmaraja heard this, he was moved. The rumored Senior Ling was not only powerful, he was unexpectedly also so considerate... he was practically a warm man <sup>2</sup> , wasn't he?!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(A 'warm man' is basically a guy who's perfect in all aspects.)</dfn>

    <p>Dharmaraja couldn't help the surge of emotions in his heart. If he was a girl, he could probably fall in love with this Senior Ling!</p>

    <p>"You've had your fight, are you happy now?" Immortal Toya gazed at Dharmaraja with his arms crossed, and looked like he had enjoyed the show.</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja nodded his head and said, "Senior Ling and Brother Toya, rest assured. Since I've already made you a promise, just leave the repair of the magic blade to me. When I go back later, I'll work overtime to restore it!"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya looked at the ruins of the square and sighed. "By the way, Dharmaraja, you've damaged this place to this extent, is that really alright?"</p>

    <p>"It's not open anyway; I can fix it very quickly."</p>

    <p>After he said this, Dharmaraja fixed Immortal Toya with a slightly complicated gaze, and he then heaved a sigh. "I really envy you, Brother Toya..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "???"</p>

    <p>Lightning Dharmaraja: "Originally, I had always thought that you were the most handsome in our group, but after seeing Senior Ling today, I find that he's also very good-looking... the most important thing is that Senior Ling's boyfriend meter is off the charts; when he was fighting me, he still remembered to create a golden light form to protect you."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "..."</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja patted Immortal Toya on the shoulder and heaved a deep sigh. "I wish the both of you happiness!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was a proven fact that when two good-looking men stood together, it would indeed cause some unnecessary misunderstandings. Wang Ling felt that his current appearance should be considered average, or to put it simply, "not too bad"... yet this was also considered "handsome"! Wang Ling just didn't understand beauty standards nowadays.</p>

    <p>It was only later that he became aware of a serious problem. Actually, the main reason for Dharmaraja's misunderstanding wasn't him, but Immortal Toya! This was the legendary principle of transference: if you had an average appearance but you were with a good-looking person, then your attractiveness would automatically level up...</p>

    <p>This was similar to the mirror principle; some expert had once said that when a person saw their own image in a mirror, they would become thirty percent more good-looking than their usual appearance... this was all an illusion created by one's brain.</p>

    <p>Mm, yes, it was an illusion!</p>

    <p>No matter what other people thought, this was the theory which Wang Ling clung to.</p>

    <p>For the time being, there was no need to worry about the restoration of the magic blade. Even so, life had yet to settle down.</p>

    <p>On Thunder's side, the hawthorn tree was about to break through the soil; the big problem now was whether the owner of the stone ghost mask would show up...</p>

    <p>Yet another problem was the unknown whereabouts of the old devil...</p>

    <p>But the problem in front of Wang Ling right now was the joint military training which would be happening next week. This was definitely an unprecedented event with six high schools participating in this military training survival drill and schools pairing up to form an alliance.</p>

    <p>If it had purely been a spring or autumn outing, Wang Ling would have been able to find various reasons to avoid going. But activities such as military training and farmwork were part of the policy which Secretary Dakang of the Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools had established decades ago, whereby every student was required to gain practical firsthand experience. Their scores would then be included in their college entrance exam grades, and would become a key criterion in determining whether they would be able to graduate or not.</p>

    <p>In short, this was something that Wang Ling couldn't escape.</p>

    <p>There would be too many people and too many eyes during that time. The three main alliances and all the teachers and students of the six schools would be present. In that sort of situation, working out how to get through the military training survival drill in a low-key way would be a very difficult problem for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, the old devil who was hiding in his small world was also plotting with the Master of Shadow Stream, Jiang Liuyue.</p>

    <p>"To defeat that Killer Taoist, you must first regain your realm. This isn't urgent for the time being, since time flows differently in this small world. My venerable self brought you here in the hope that you will recover more quickly. After I fulfill my promise to you, I can then carry out my master plan."</p>

    <p>"Thanks to Lord Devil Emperor, I do feel much more comfortable cultivating here than in the outside world." Jiang Liuyue nodded. After these two days, she had reached a further understanding with the old devil.</p>

    <p>"Your recovery is one thing, but I have to entrust another thing to you. Staying in your body is not a long-term solution, so I'm going to create a body. I'll be using the skeleton of an ancient grandmaster as the raw material for it," the old devil said with narrowed eyes.</p>

    <p>"So Lord Devil Emperor wants to use this as a base to regenerate the corporeal body? Can it be done?" Jiang Liuyue asked.</p>

    <p>"The principle is similar to using the spirit lotus root to create a body, but the method is a lot more complicated and sophisticated. I'll need the vitality of thousands of youths to power a large array in order to restore the corporeal body on the skeleton."</p>

    <p>"Lord Devil Emperor, you don't have to worry about this. When you spoke to me about youthful vitality the last time, I'd already thought of something." Jiang Liuyue nodded. "The school I mentioned to you before is going to combine with five other schools for a military training exercise. There will be thousands of people then... wouldn't these Foundation Establishment students have ready-made vigor for you to use?"</p>

    <p>After she said this, Jiang Liuyue smiled coldly and thought herself very clever.</p>

    <p>She had once said that she wanted to wash Number 60 High School with blood until nothing and no one was left.</p>

    <p>This was a god-given opportunity; not only would this help the old devil regenerate the body, it would also destroy this school at the same time; this really was the perfect scheme to kill two birds with one stone!</p>
