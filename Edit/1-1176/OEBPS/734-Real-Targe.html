  <h1>Chapter 734 Real Target</h1>

  <div>

    <p>On one side, a lively picnic was happening in the calm before a storm, while on the other, the battle in the fake remains still raged on.</p>

    <p>In any case, after the Old Devil and Master of Immortal Mansion Cheng Yu's chat, they found out that it was Evil Sword God who had gotten slapped the most out of the three of them, and straightaway their expressions turned heavy with frustration.</p>

    <p>In terms of overall fighting strength, the three of them would have had the strength of a True Immortal at their peaks... Although Cheng Yu himself was half a step away from True Immortal level, he had relied on dark powers to successfully cultivate an intrinsic spirit field beforehand. With the advantage that an intrinsic spirit field gave him, he could also act as a True Immortal.</p>

    <p>But these two people absolutely never expected that it would be the eyeshadow and echo brother in the sky who among the three of them would have received the most slaps...</p>

    <p>Hands behind his back, the Old Devil took a deep breath.</p>

    <p>He and Cheng Yu exchanged looks. While they didn't communicate telepathically, at that moment, they came up with a tacit, mutual plan for a cathartic bashing.</p>

    <p>When they went back this time, they had to teach this eyeshadow weirdo a good lesson...</p>

    <p>Anyway, Evil Sword God getting beaten up in Songhai First Prison's special cell was normal - that guy had rough skin and thick flesh, and had cultivated the art of swift healing; he thus also had a self-healing physique.</p>

    <p>It was just that this kind of self-healing physique wasn't as terrifying as President Bai's rumored ability...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Inside the Tight Net barrier which General Bai had set up, every living thing had been annihilated and everything had been blown to smithereens, like there wasn't even any dust left.</p>

    <p>There was a massive crater in the ground; if one stood on the edge, if felt like staring into an abyss.</p>

    <p>But this explosion hadn't directly blown that group of Night Chief members out from inside their underground barrier. The other side was very cunning, and had hidden very deep underground where they had established a barrier.</p>

    <p>But though the explosion hadn't forced the Night Chief members out, at least those seven troublesome deformed platelets had been utterly wiped out.</p>

    <p>The Huaxiu Alliance members lowered their eyes and lit candles for the seven deformed platelets called "Cerebral Blood Clot,""Heart Attack,""Fatty Liver,""Brainless and Unhappy," and "Big Head Son and Little Head Father."</p>

    <p>At the same time, this incident caused these cultivators to turn mindful.</p>

    <p>Even cultivators still needed to take care of themselves; they couldn't ignore the importance of taking care of their bodies just because they were cultivators. In addition to cultivating skills, cultivating the body and mind was also an essential lesson for a true cultivator.</p>

    <p>It was common knowledge that cultivators lived longer than the average person. The so-called eight hundred years of the Golden Core stage and one thousand years of the Soul Formation stage were only what a normal lifespan could achieve in theory. If you didn't cherish your body, even if you were the most talented cultivator, your lifespan would easily be cut short.</p>

    <p>It wasn't like in the novels; the truth was that in real life, there were quite a number of cultivators who died only ten years after advancing to the Soul Formation stage... And it was mostly because they went crazy day and night since they thought they didn't have anything to worry about as they would have very long lives after reaching the Soul Formation stage.</p>

    <p>"I have to take good care of my body from now on. For the sake of my body platelets, I have to be more diligent in my cultivation and in taking care of my body and mind. This is what happens when you indulge too much in your desires..." someone sighed.</p>

    <p>These desires represented a lot of things, such as food, lust, wealth and so on.</p>

    <p>At that moment, someone couldn't help wondering, "Do you think there's a cultivator in this world who can sleep well, study peacefully and do things low-key all day long?"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, the Old Devil, Evil Sword God and Cheng Yu couldn't help shuddering on the spot.</p>

    <p>They were all thinking of one person... Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The Old Devil and Evil Sword God touched their faces thoughtfully.</p>

    <p>This was where Wang Ling had hit them before.</p>

    <p>Cheng Yu raised his hand, and then put it down.</p>

    <p>Cheng Yu, had no place to touch...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the air, General Bai's knitted eyebrows didn't relax after he released that blast. He gazed into the massive, round abyss in the ground. "Pay attention, it's not over yet..."</p>

    <p>He had a very strong feeling that something more frightening than the seven platelets was about to come out of the ground.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, he had hardly said the words when instantly there was a rumble from below.</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God looked into the abyss, and the image from down below was directly reflected by the light of his Purple Investigative Demon Eyes so that it appeared in the air and they could clearly see what was happening at the bottom of the abyss.</p>

    <p>A lot of snow-white figures had appeared at the bottom of the abyss. This group of people all wore peaked caps and held white daggers in both hands. Every single one of them was murderous-looking.</p>

    <p>Although their physiques were far from that of the seven deformed platelets, it was obvious that this group in white were very lethal and destructive!</p>

    <p>The most crucial thing was that there were so many of them!</p>

    <p>In a flash, thousands upon thousands of people in white had already gathered, and more were still breaking out of the ground continuously like mushrooms after the rain!</p>

    <p>"This is..."</p>

    <p>The Old Devil couldn't help sighing as he narrowed his eyes at this huge momentum.</p>

    <p>Back when he had personally broken into Huaxiu's National Palace, it had only been with ten thousand men...</p>

    <p>"White Zetsu?" Cheng Yu was dazed.</p>

    <p>"Aren't these transformed white blood cells?" The Old Devil was surprised.</p>

    <p>So, what was White Zetsu <sup>1</sup> ?!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A character from Naruto who is all white in appearance.)</dfn>

    <p>Something that had once again been shoved in messily by this unscrupulous author to make up the word count <sup>2</sup> ?!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Clearly, this author has gotten a lot of complaints..)</dfn>

    <p>"Prepare to counterattack!" In the sky, General Bai gave the order.</p>

    <p>These guys were too fast and too strong. A lot of them had already scuttled upward to try and rip through the Tight Net.</p>

    <p>General Bai had already fired one shot just now, and had to wait for the gloves on his hands to cool down completely before he could fire another, otherwise it would place a heavy burden on his body.</p>

    <p>On the other side, the command center was alarmed by Night Chief's momentum.</p>

    <p>"They didn't just summon platelets, they also summoned an army of white blood cells..." President Qi stared at the image on the screen and frowned.</p>

    <p>To him, this was just harming themselves.</p>

    <p>Using the Cells At Work Spell to summon activated cells had the major side effect of a reduced lifespan.</p>

    <p>Generally speaking, to minimize this loss, the best would be to summon just one cell type, but not only had the other side summoned platelets, they had even summoned an army of white blood cells, which cut down their lifespans even more by twice as much.</p>

    <p>"Why are they doing this?" For some reason, General Yi felt that there was something wrong with this development.</p>

    <p>"To escape, and to disrupt things..." President Qi replied quickly. "Also, Old Yi, I believe that their purpose now is no longer just about realizing their own ambition..."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean?" General Yi asked.</p>

    <p>"The rumor is that there's an advanced level thirteen secret spell inside Beast King's Remains, and whoever gets it can command the entire world, but we were strictly on guard this time and dispatched all these forces to eliminate this foreign party. I'm afraid, however, that their real target has already changed earlier on... This group of people in the fake remains are just creating a ruckus to distract us." At this point, President Qi suddenly felt a strong sense of unease.</p>

    <p>But what was their new target?</p>

    <p>Was it Number 60 High yet again?</p>

    <p>President Qi pondered.</p>

    <p>It shouldn't be...</p>

    <p>After all, the villains who had stirred up trouble at Number 60 High previously were now all dead...</p>
