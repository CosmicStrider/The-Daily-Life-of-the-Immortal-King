  <h1>Chapter 30 When Two Women Do Battle, Someone Is Going to Die </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Anyone who went online to dig out the black pasts of Number 60 High School's Director Shi and Number 59 High School's Director Xie would know that these two were old enemies. They were both graduates of Cultivation Normal University, a first-tier cultivation college ranked second only to Ace University and which was attached to the national "211 Universities Project."</p>

    <p>After graduating from Cultivation Normal University, these two had worked together for a time at Number 60 High School. Later, Teacher Shi had been elected director of education, while Teacher Xie had been pushed aside by the school and had had to transfer to Number 59 High School.</p>

    <p>In the last few years, Number 59 High School had grown very rapidly and Director Xie had continued to rise in her new position. It was impossible that she wouldn't take revenge for being ousted back then.</p>

    <p>Hence, the grudge between Number 59 High School and Number 60 High School all these years was actually largely due to the conflict between these two directors of education. Friendship between women could be quickly established with a Chanel flying sword, but once war happened and two swords collided, someone was going to die...</p>

    <p>The relationship between the student unions of the two schools was also actually quite disharmonious, just like the one between their directors of education. It was only to be expected that any public or private rivalry between the students would follow the example of their school leaders.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had always felt though that of the three ordinary high schools in Peiyuan district, Number 60 High School's ethos and discipline were pretty good.</p>

    <p>Before they reached the main entrance to the teaching building, Wang Ling had already seen from afar a boy about his age, dressed in an old-fashioned, dark brown uniform, slowly stroll out from the building, followed by four other youths.</p>

    <p>Among the five boys, the one leading the way with a calm and composed expression was Tang Jingze, President of the Student Union at Number 59 High School and also someone who moved around in various school circles. In particular, it could be said that he knew everything about the three schools in Peiyuan district like the back of his hand. The short, pretty boy standing next to him was Fang Huaqing, Vice President of the Student Union at Number 59 High School. The three individuals behind them were Number 59 High School's three Liang brothers: Liang Wei, Liang Zheng and Liang Fei.</p>

    <p>Before attending this exchange meet, Lao Gudong had already researched these people and told his students about them in advance. Although they were meeting for the first time, everyone in the Number 60 High School team already knew everything about them.</p>

    <p>Tang Jingze bowed slightly to Lao Gudong. "You must be Lao Gudong? Lao Gudong and fellow students, welcome to Number 59 High School. I will be your host for the next four days. We ask that you forgive us if our hospitality proves unsatisfactory."</p>

    <p>This warm greeting instantly set the Number 60 High School team on edge...</p>

    <p>Everyone knew what the relationship between the two schools was like. There was no such thing as a free lunch — something was definitely fishy!</p>

    <p>Additionally, before this exchange meet between the student unions of the two schools, Number 58 High School had also come to Number 59 High School for the same purpose. According to first-hand information which Lao Gudong had obtained, all the students from Number 58 High School had been completely wiped out in every single exchange meet challenge...</p>

    <p>Tang Jingze's eyes swept over everyone somewhat impudently. He had already done his research and knew everything about everyone on the Number 60 High School team.</p>

    <p>Big Miss Sun Rong of Huaguo Water Curtain Group... probably the only person on the entire team of six who was truly up to the task of participating in the exchange meet.</p>

    <p>After that, the fat Lao Gudong leading the team, who taught the theory of history course...</p>

    <p>Student prodigy Lin Xiaoyu...</p>

    <p>Sports committee member Chen Chao...</p>

    <p>Political science representative Guo Hao...</p>

    <p>And...</p>

    <p>Bloody hell, wait! This last person... what was his damn name?</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Tang Jingze broke out in a cold sweat... his mind had actually gone blank, and no matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't remember who on earth this last youth with the crew cut was.</p>

    <p>This feeling of not being in control of himself made him uneasy.</p>

    <p>Had he miscalculated?</p>

    <p>No... he had definitely made the necessary preparations before coming here.</p>

    <p>However, he couldn't remember a single thing about this youth with a crew cut in front of him.</p>

    <p>What the hell was going on?</p>

    <p>The truth was that a lot of it had to do with Wang Ling's Great Shielding Spell, which was like a character's passive skill in a game. Since learning this spell at the age of five, he had never deactivated it.</p>

    <p>The way the spell specifically worked was that as long as it was activated, any information on him obtained in whatever way before formal face-to-face contact was established would instantly be completely forgotten.</p>

    <p>As someone who had already been a school senior for two years and who had been moving around in various school circles since primary school, Tang Jingze could only assume that he had made a mistake, or was suffering a temporary lapse in memory.</p>

    <p>Quickly, he clapped his hands with a face wreathed in smiles, and instantly someone brought forth tea that had already been prepared for them. "Now that you are here at our Number 59 High School, you are our guests. When in Rome, do as the Romans do. I wonder if any of the fellow students from Number 60 High School would agree to be a representative and drink this cup of tea as a sign of friendship?"</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong took one look at the color of the tea and his eyelid twitched.</p>

    <p>Floating indistinctly in the brownish-green tea was some kind of chemical mix which gave off an unpleasant scent. If Lao Gudong had to find an accurate way of describing this feeling, it would be like underwear that hadn't been washed for three hundred days, mixed together with salted fish dried under a scorching sun for forty-nine days, plus a sprinkle of canned herring juice on top.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High School's illicit dealer in snacks was an experienced veteran and a huge, unwavering foodie. Seeing how even Lao Gudong looked defeated when faced with this tea, the rest of them immediately knew in their hearts...</p>

    <p>— This tea was poisonous.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, it was definitely a trap.</p>

    <p>Seeing this, Tang Jingze smiled slightly. "This tea is made from a blend of vegetable and fruit juice with a two hundredfold concentration, and has the miraculous effect of strengthening muscles and bones. We wouldn't give it to just anybody. Of course, the smell is a little strange, but for the sake of our school's tradition and as testament to our friendship, don't you think, fellow students from Number 60 High School, that you should be a brave example for your school?"</p>

    <p>So it was a vegetable and fruit juice...</p>

    <p>Realization instantly dawned on the Number 60 High School team. This was the real fucking poison on the school grounds!</p>

    <p>Actually, this thing had a bit of a connection with Huaguo Water Curtain Group, which produced the powder for the vegetable and fruit juice blend.</p>

    <p>However, the concentration of the juice which Huaguo Water Curtain Group sold on the market had been precisely calculated. Although Sun Rong wouldn't deny that the taste wasn't great, at least it wasn't to the extent that it was too disgusting to swallow down.</p>

    <p>The most crucial thing was that it really had the effect of strengthening one's muscles and bones, as Tang Jingze had mentioned.</p>

    <p>The condition, however, was that you had to drink every last drop without throwing up.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong had never imagined that this group of people would actually put on airs as soon as they met.</p>

    <p>They were clearly completely looking down on her, the Young Miss!</p>

    <p>Generally speaking, a tenfold juice concentration was already very hard to swallow down...</p>

    <p>A twentyfold concentration could already be hell.</p>

    <p>A two hundredfold concentration was completely asking someone to die!</p>

    <p>At the back, Fang Huaqing, Liang Wei and the other two people couldn't help snickering silently. Back then, those idiots from Number 58 High School had been anxious to keep up appearances; they had drunk the tea one by one, but had vomited messily and disgracefully at the entrance to the teaching building.</p>

    <p><em>Even if it's tough, you lot from Number 60 High School, what are you going to do about it?</em></p>

    <p>As the mood in the air thickened almost to the point of solidifying, Tang Jingze saw that boy with the crew cut, whose name he didn't know, step forward from where he had been standing silently at the back of the group.</p>

    <p>Then.</p>

    <p>He picked up the cup of tea.</p>

    <p>And drank it in one gulp...</p>
