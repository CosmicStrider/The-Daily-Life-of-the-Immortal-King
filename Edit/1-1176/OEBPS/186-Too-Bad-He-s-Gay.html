  <h1>Chapter 186 Too Bad He's Gay! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It could only be said that Lord Diulei was in the end Lord Diulei; as one of the few close guy friends that Wang Ling had in the cultivation circle, he had seen through Wang Ling's lurking behind the scenes. Of course, apart from Lord Diulei, all these people in the group chat were also kind of Wang Ling's friends in the cultivation circle, though few of them had actually seen him before.</p>

    <p>The year that Wang Ling had turned ten, Cailian Zhenren had been lucky to have seen him once, but she didn't know that the Ling Zhenren in this group was that little boy whom she had encountered back then.</p>

    <p>After carefully thinking this matter over, Wang Ling finally decided to agree to do it.</p>

    <p>He felt that there was something strange about this incident and the image which his Heavenly Eye had shown him had been slightly unnerving. Reasonably speaking, this Master of Shadow Stream whose cultivation had been set back by six hundred years was already unable to save herself. If those missing delivery brothers were really connected to her, it was very hard to say exactly what was involved behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was June 11th on Saturday in the seventh week of the semester.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Immortal Toya had arranged to meet in a park not far from that luxury apartment. When Wang Ling arrived, he could already see from afar a thin, handsome man dressed in old-fashioned attire with a large gourd on his back standing in front of a park bench.</p>

    <p>That big gourd on this guy's back was really too eye-catching, and quite a few girls who happened to be passing through the park couldn't help stopping.</p>

    <p>"Hello, can I take a picture with you?" Before Wang Ling got any closer, he saw that a girl had already screwed up her courage to ask Immortal Toya the question. The man silently stared at the girl in front of him for three seconds before nodding.</p>

    <p>Having gotten permission, the girl was ecstatic and took several selfies with him as she gave the "V" sign. The other girls nearby all watched with envious expressions.</p>

    <p>The girl carefully scrolled through the pictures on her phone and flushed... the more she looked, the more handsome this man appeared! If she posted these photos in her WeChat moments, it would definitely make all the little sisters around her envious for a long time.</p>

    <p>After the photo session, Immortal Toya saw a youngster approach from afar. The youngster was wearing a white shirt and had one hand tucked in a pants pocket. Immortal Toya immediately took out the picture which Lord Diulei had given him and carefully compared the two... hmm, black hair, dead fish eyes and a natural poker face. This was without doubt Ling Zhenren!</p>

    <p>The other girls were about to bustle over to take photos as well when they saw Immortal Toya suddenly move as he directly walked over to a boy.</p>

    <p>Instantly, all the girls were stunned. Bloody hell! What was with the park today, that they could suddenly encounter two handsome men so early in the morning?!</p>

    <p>The girls saw the two people speak to each other before they walked away shoulder to shoulder.</p>

    <p>The girl who had taken the photos stared infatuatedly at the photos she had taken with Immortal Toya. Looking at the backs of Wang Ling and Immortal Toya as they drew further away, her heart couldn't help aching and she sighed deeply; he was so handsome... too bad he was gay!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Finally meeting the legendary Ling Zhenren in person, Immortal Toya thought... actually, this was probably the second time he was seeing Wang Ling. The last time had been several years ago, when Wang Ling and Lord Diulei had been carrying out an assignment and he had seen Ling Zhenren from afar.</p>

    <p>Actually, that time it had just been Wang Ling's clone, and even Wang Ling himself no longer had an impression of the moment.</p>

    <p>At that time, Immortal Toya had already felt that Ling Zhenren wasn't naturally young, and he was even more convinced of it now that he was seeing the person up close in the flesh.</p>

    <p>No matter how cultivators tried to retain their appearance, whether through medicinal baths or by taking youth-retaining elixirs, their youthful vitality would gradually fade with age or an increase in realm. On the other hand, Wang Ling was still able to maintain such incredible vigor!</p>

    <p>How on earth had he done it?</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya cupped his chin and stared extremely curiously at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This luxury apartment in the city center cost twenty thousand per square meter. As a posh apartment, security was usually very tight and outsiders were not permitted entry. Such a large gourd on Immortal Toya's back was really a little ostentatious, so they were stopped by the security guard as soon as they reached the main entrance.</p>

    <p>The security guard stared at them. "Who are you looking for?"</p>

    <p>"We're looking for someone," Immortal Toya answered truthfully and straight to the point.</p>

    <p>The security guard replied politely, "If you're looking for someone, the owner has to call us to let us know before you can enter."</p>

    <p>"Then an owner can enter directly, is that correct?" asked Immortal Toya.</p>

    <p>The security guard nodded. "Of course!"</p>

    <p>"Oh." Immortal Toya took out his phone and his slender fingers tapped on the screen several times. Three minutes later, he held up the phone in front of the security guard; on it was a list of online purchases.</p>

    <p>In the last three minutes, Immortal Toya had directly bought a unit at thirty million yuan...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The two people walked through the apartment's main entrance and found the incline down to the basement.</p>

    <p>"Soul-gathering incense works best when it's freshly made. I've brought all the materials I need, and it'll take me about five minutes to make it. If those delivery brothers were really murdered, I'll put their souls in this gourd, and the spirit water in it will ensure that the souls don't disperse." Immortal Toya put down the gourd that was on his back and looked at Wang Ling as he spoke.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded; at the same time, his gaze passed through several walls as he looked at the suspicious, abandoned convenience mart from afar. He was utterly sure that there was someone inside and that it was an expert.</p>

    <p>He knew that a barrier had been set up outside the convenience mart, and it wasn't something that could be penetrated with ordinary spiritual senses. Of course, he could forcefully penetrate it, but that would inadvertently alert the other party.</p>

    <p>It was impossible for that Master of Shadow Stream, who had lost six hundred years' worth of cultivation, to set up such a strong barrier.</p>

    <p>"The people in the group were right; this truly isn't a simple matter." Immortal Toya was also staring at the convenience mart, deep in thought. An alchemist's five senses were more extraordinary than a normal person's, given that they were constantly exposed to the influence of drugs, so he could sense the foul aura coming from within.</p>

    <p>"Senior, put on these clothes first and take a look around." As he spoke, Immortal Toya took out a delivery uniform which Cailian Zhenren had bought via express air delivery from Moubao. Although the tailoring was a little crude, it was on the whole still pretty much a perfect knock-off.</p>

    <p>The huge "Mi" <sup>1</sup> character on the back of the delivery uniform in particular instantly reminded Wang Ling of his own Number 60 High School uniform.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>('Mi' for 'rice in Riceball Takeout.)</dfn>

    <p>He reckoned that these two uniforms had probably been designed by the same person.</p>

    <p>After changing into the delivery uniform, he smoothed out the wrinkles in it.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya sized Wang Ling up carefully and felt that he was still lacking something. "Erm... did senior bring any food?"</p>

    <p>Now that they had decided to put on this act, they naturally had to go all out. However one looked at it, it would be very suspicious for a person wearing a delivery uniform to be empty-handed.</p>

    <p>Of course, Wang Ling had already prepared the takeout earlier on. A spirit light glowed in his right hand and a plastic bag instantly emerged.</p>

    <p>The plastic bag contained tear-provoking, Chinese soup dumpling-flavored crispy noodle snacks which Grandfather Wang had made the night before.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Looking at the crispy noodle snacks that had been wrapped simply in plastic wrap, Immortal Toya became lost in deep thought.</p>
