  <h1>Chapter 745 Spiritual Pressure Off the Charts</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The greatest oppressive force descended from the sky and swept over the whole scene, and no one had any idea what was happening.</p>

    <p>Who was it?</p>

    <p>For a moment, the lead teachers, plus the head of state who had been about to act, were all deeply shaken. They could feel that somewhere close by, a powerful expert had unleashed his "imperial aura." And the most frightening of all was how this imperial aura caused these summoned activated cells to go back into hiding.</p>

    <p>It could be said that these cells were very eager to continue living.</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade and Lord Anxiang had stunned expressions on their faces. The biggest expert whom they had identified at the scene was without doubt His Excellency who had previously disguised himself as Head of State 001... but he clearly wasn't the person who had released this spiritual pressure.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, there was yet another hidden expert in their midst.</p>

    <p>In Huaxiu Alliance's command center, every one of the Ten Generals who were present couldn't help getting up as they stared in astonishment at the scene in front of their eyes.</p>

    <p>After that spiritual pressure had descended out of nowhere, President Qi had gotten the technicians to immediately mobilize the measurement gauges to monitor the data. In the end, all the more than one hundred and twenty spiritual pressure gauges in Huaxiu Alliance were overloaded! And their pointers were all pushed up to the maximum value! Moreover, more than ten of the gauges couldn't withstand the pressure overload and exploded several seconds later!</p>

    <p>"This..."</p>

    <p>President Qi's face was pale with shock.</p>

    <p>These spiritual pressure gauges were linked to the space satellite, which made them highly resistant to pressure. They were connected in a series, and even an angry head of state could only overload sixty or so gauges.</p>

    <p>But now, more than one hundred and twenty gauges were overloaded, and more than ten of them had exploded.</p>

    <p>"Old Qi, this already isn't the first time." Dressed in training clothes as he hovered in the air, General Yi stroked his beard as he looked solemnly at this scene.</p>

    <p>On the side, the other Ten Generals including Marshal Jiang also had suspicious expressions on their faces.</p>

    <p>Everyone's hearts were as clear as a mirror.</p>

    <p>Because this wasn't the first time this had happened.</p>

    <p>The most recent incident...</p>

    <p>During the combined military training for the six schools back then, there was a moment when all the spiritual pressure gauges had overloaded and gone off the charts. President Qi had also been the one in command behind the scenes when it had happened. Everyone had assumed that it had been an instrument malfunction and so hadn't paid too much attention to it.</p>

    <p>It was just that during the post-operation checks, the technicians in charge of maintenance had said that there weren't any problems with the gauges, and that it was a normal occurrence when there was too much spiritual pressure.</p>

    <p>At the time, it had become an unresolved issue with many dubious points.</p>

    <p>That was because General Yi was the only one of the Ten Generals who had been sent along on the military training, and the maximum number of gauges he could overload was forty. Moreover, the Old Devil who wasn't at his peak could only overload twenty gauges.</p>

    <p>Even if the two of them had fought back then, it was unlikely that they would overload all the spiritual pressure gauges.</p>

    <p>"As expected... has that mysterious expert shown up again?" President Qi frowned deeply.</p>

    <p>Including that time during the military training for six schools, this had already happened three times. The first time was six years ago when the Gate Between Worlds descended. Roughly around the time that the Tuntian Ha had been defeated, spiritual pressure had peaked once.</p>

    <p>This mysterious expert's actions one after another was the focus of extraordinary attention from the whole of Huaxiu Alliance.</p>

    <p>But this was far out of everyone's expectations this time; no one, including President Qi, had expected this mysterious expert to actually also be here at the summer camp...</p>

    <p>"This person has acted from the dark time and again, probably because he's unwilling to reveal his face. But this is exactly how we can expose his identity," said General Yi. "After the summer camp, we can go through the list of all the teachers who were involved in the operation and inspect them one by one."</p>

    <p>General Yi's first feeling was that this mysterious expert was among the teachers.</p>

    <p>Since all the students had already been evacuated to the Rainbow Glass Box, the lead teachers were the most suspect.</p>

    <p>"Mm." President Qi nodded. "Looking at the current situation, this person has taken action repeatedly, and should be friend, not foe... But we have no way of controlling a situation if he hides in the dark, which is absolutely unacceptable."</p>

    <p>There were several days left to the end of the summer camp.</p>

    <p>Since it was already confirmed that this mysterious expert was part of their ranks, this was undoubtedly the best chance they had to uncover his identity. This was because the head of state was around - once the head of state started probing, this expert would definitely give himself away no matter how amazing he was.</p>

    <p>It was just that they could never have imagined...</p>

    <p>The "mysterious expert" who had overloaded more than one hundred and twenty spiritual pressure gauges was merely one of Wang Ling's clones.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had promised the Heavenly Dao that he wouldn't initiate anything, but when he saw the Sea And Sky Array, he had changed his mind.</p>

    <p>This couldn't be considered making an active move... but was necessary and legitimate self-defense!</p>

    <p>Moreover, he was truly far more low-key this time - he had just used a clone to drive the summoned cell army back into the ground. This couldn't be considered going overboard...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ming, who was being protected by Zhai Yin and many other teachers, was using the Brain Deduction Technique as his brain worked at lightning speed to find the core array pattern.</p>

    <p>He sat cross-legged on the ground, and because of how fast his brain was working, his entire body had turned red. The veins on his forehead bulged out and throbbed, which was a ghastly sight.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin even wondered for a moment if his head would swell up like a balloon at the lightest touch and instantly explode.</p>

    <p>Since the cells summoned by Ghost Head Blade had been scared into retreating by Wang Ling's clone, it was a huge weight off the lead teachers' shoulders, and they kept a close eye on Ghost Head Blade's and Dark Fragrance's movements not far away.</p>

    <p>Dark Fragrance was manipulating the summoning array remotely. Furthermore, he had activated "death" mode, and was planning to stage a comeback.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Ming opened his eyes. "Found it!"</p>

    <p>Seeing this, the head of state promptly pointed in the air as he synchronized Wang Ming's thoughts with those of all the lead teachers.</p>

    <p>"Everyone, full firepower! Blow up the core array pattern!"</p>

    <p>In an instant, a dozen or so teachers rushed out and easily found the location of the core array pattern based on the coordinates in Wang Ming's mind.</p>

    <p><em>Boom boom boom boom boom...</em></p>

    <p>A barrage of light beams and waves shot out from the teachers' palms and magic weapons as they started to shoot at the core array pattern in a frenzy, holding absolutely nothing back.</p>

    <p>"Want to destroy the array pattern? Not that easy..." Ghost Head Blade was infuriated.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming had been tightly surrounded earlier so Ghost Head Blade hadn't been able to attack him. Now that most of the people had gone off to attack the core array pattern, Ghost Head Blade knew that his chance had come.</p>

    <p>Manipulating his pitch-black dagger body, he directly pierced the ground, and planned to launch a surprise attack from underneath.</p>

    <p>In the end, he struggled out of the ground in pain a handful of seconds later. Who knew what the earth in these remains were comprised of, but he had barely been immersed in the ground for a few seconds before his blade body had actually started to corrode!</p>
