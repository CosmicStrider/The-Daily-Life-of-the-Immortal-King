  <h1>Chapter 210 There Are Still Nine Other People as Awesome as General Yi </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that the military training this time was a little too full of surprises. Forget Immortal Toya being their chief military instructor, even Wang Ming had appeared...</p>

    <p>So the question was, why had Wang Ming shown up here? And who did the last bed in the room belong to?</p>

    <p>As he thought about these questions, Wang Ling looked at Wang Ming whose entire head was in a helmet that was stuck in the wall. He sighed in his heart, then stretched out his hands to pry the wall open and very carefully pull Wang Ming out.</p>

    <p>If he didn't pull Wang Ming out, there was a possibility that Wang Ming's peripheral nerves would die and his brain would suffocate.</p>

    <p>After all, the most valuable thing in Wang Ming's body was his brain, though Wang Ling had always felt that this guy's IQ always went offline whenever they met!</p>

    <p>Able to breathe fresh air at long last, Wang Ming lay gasping on the ground. After that, he sighed faintly and clenched his fists in resentment. "I never thought that the hammer spark <sup>1</sup> I had been planning for so long would actually fail..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is the pokemon Zudomon's attack..)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Su Xiao: "..."</p>

    <p>"You must be Wang Ling's classmate?" Wang Ming dusted himself off, got to his feet, and gripped Su Xiao's hands. "I'm Wang Xiaoer, a new transfer student. It's nice to meet you!"</p>

    <p>For some reason, Su Xiao couldn't help trembling in his heart. A person who could transfer schools halfway through the semester wouldn't have just any ordinary strength. However, he couldn't detect any aura coming off Wang Ming at all. His intuition told him that this was a very dangerous man. To actually be able to hide his aura so perfectly... this person must definitely be an expert!</p>

    <p>Su Xiao's imagination ran wild as he shook hands with Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>You're thinking too much.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling gave the key to Su Xiao and left an earth-leveling talisman at the scene for Su Xiao to use to patch up the hole which Wang Ming had made. He planned to find a quiet place where he and Wang Ming could speak alone.</p>

    <p>The dormitory for the military training was state property, and they would definitely be held accountable if they left such a hole behind. There was no way Wang Ling wanted to be punished by a military instructor to run laps. Students of six high schools, which was thousands of spectators... this would really be too eye-catching.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling dragged Wang Ming up to the roof of the dormitory via teleportation.</p>

    <p>After that sneak attack just now, Wang Ming finally took the helmet off, and then pointed to the spring launchers tied around his ankles with an inscrutable expression. "I obtained some primordial black crystal; it's the hardest metal in the universe, and I thought I could use it to confuse your senses! I never thought it wouldn't work!"</p>

    <p>Primordial black crystal?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at the helmet for a moment, stretched out his hand, and with a crack, crushed it.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>After a long time, Wang Ming sighed mournfully in his heart... sure enough, they were just damn brothers on the surface!</p>

    <p>He wanted to cry but had no tears to shed. "Ling... can you give your elder brother a little face?! I always feel like an idiot every time I show up."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't say anything, and only folded his arms as he narrowed his eyes at Wang Ming with a face full of questions.</p>

    <p>Even without telepathy, Wang Ming also knew what Wang Ling wanted to ask.</p>

    <p>He immediately spread his hands. "Don't look at me like that, this time I'm here on business. General Yi had the factory produce such a large number of magic artifacts in three months, so it's possible there might be some problems with the quality. I'm here with my team this time to perform repairs on the artifacts damaged during the drill."</p>

    <p>This was the truth. Wang Ming knew that Wang Ling had the Mind-Reading Ability, so there was no point in lying to his face.</p>

    <p>After learning of Wang Ming's purpose for being here, Wang Ling was actually very relieved. After all, Wang Ming was a cultivation muggle, and recently, Number 60 High School hadn't been very peaceful, so it would be very dangerous for him if he really were to transfer to Number 60 High School to study.</p>

    <p>At the present stage, the best thing for Wang Ming would be to accept government protection. God knew when another younger sister of the Master of Shadow Stream would come running over again to abduct him...</p>

    <p>To be honest, since that incident the last time, there was still lingering fear in Wang Ling's heart — if Wang Ming was gone, there would be no one to make subsequent talisman seals, and even Wang Ling himself couldn't predict what would happen in the future if he didn't have them.</p>

    <p>Now, the hearts of these two brothers standing on the roof were in fact like mirrors to each other.</p>

    <p>"Ah, that's right! Ling, there's one more thing that might be of interest to you," Wang Ming said suddenly. "Although the main reason my research team is here is for the maintenance of the magic artifacts, we actually have a secondary task. Two years ago, our Academy of Science developed an instrument that's able to detect abnormal fluctuations in Huaxiu nation. Just recently, this device detected a strange signal. Our preliminary guess is that this signal is likely related to the Gate Between Worlds."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's eyes suddenly lit up when he heard this since it already wasn't the first time he had come into contact with this gate which connected the demon and human worlds together. Moreover, he realized that there actually were a lot of people around him who were connected to it.</p>

    <p>Old Li whom Wang Ling had rescued from the Gate three years ago was one example. Another example was Er Ha, who had dropped from the sky six years ago and had now turned into a dog.</p>

    <p>"After the demon army withdrew six years ago, General Yi joined forces with the other nine generals to seal the Gate Between Worlds firmly shut. Logically speaking, it shouldn't appear again in the short term. Historical records of the last few times that the Gate had appeared show that it happens every one hundred years, or even after several hundred years."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming paused at this point, then put forward his own hypothesis. "So, I think it's definitely abnormal for us to detect a fluctuation from the Gate Between Worlds, and I suspect that there's probably someone who is summoning it and planning to coordinate an offensive."</p>

    <p>There actually was some basis for his conjecture, since the reappearance of the Gate Between Worlds this time was indeed too unusual. Who was General Yi? He was one of the Ten Founding Generals back then, and was now an Ambassador for Peace in outer space who was often sent to mediate conflict between other planets.</p>

    <p>Even if General Yi had been alone back then, he would have been more than enough to seal the Gate Between Worlds for a hundred years.</p>

    <p>But in that group which had joined hands to seal the Gate back then, there were still nine other people who were as awesome as General Yi!</p>

    <p>The Ten Founding Generals had sealed it together! How strong was the seal? The goal had been to ensure that Huaxiu nation would be protected from the Gate Between Worlds for at least a thousand years.</p>

    <p>But after just six years, fluctuations from the Gate had been detected once again — one's imagination could indeed run wild trying to figure out the reason behind it.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling could already guess who was behind this mischief. It was the person who most wanted to cause chaos in order to conceal the fact of his resurrection...</p>

    <p>In any case, Wang Ling felt that it was indeed worth paying attention to this matter.</p>
