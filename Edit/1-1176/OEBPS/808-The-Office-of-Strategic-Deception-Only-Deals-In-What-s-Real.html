  <h1>Chapter 808 The Office of Strategic Deception Only Deals In What's Real!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>There was an intense kind of cold that came from deep within the bones and sent chills down a person's back, as if they'd fallen into an ice cavern - all the heads of the Sky-level sects who were present basically felt like this. The seventeen sect heads of the Alliance had come together this time, and their average strength was around the Void Refinement stage.</p>

    <p>So now, when they saw this Professor Yang Bingchuan, who was at the late Void Refinement stage and was only half a step away from becoming an Itinerant Immortal, actually standing in front of them as a sect team leader, these Sky-level sect heads didn't feel good... grand Sky-level sect heads like them were at most only second fiddle in the Office of Strategic Deception!</p>

    <p>This intense sense of difference upset them.</p>

    <p>Lu Youming was already pondering whether to give up on the collaboration, but when he turned on his phone, he saw that the chat was very lively.</p>

    <p>Sun Hanzhe, the sect head of Radish King Sect, was the first to vent his dissatisfaction in the group. "As a new sect, this Office of Strategic Deception is completely looking down on us veteran sects. This is blatant provocation! Everyone! We must carry out this operation! At the very least, we have to test this Office of Strategic Deception's strength!"</p>

    <p>"I agree." The other sect heads quickly echoed him after that. "We don't actually lose anything by proceeding with this. An opening ceremony only happens once for every sect. If something unpleasant were to happen, I'd like to see how this Great Death-Courting Senior handles it."</p>

    <p>Thus, while Lu Youming was still wondering whether to go ahead, passions were already running high in the group.</p>

    <p>Lu Youming stared blankly at the phone screen.</p>

    <p>It had already come to this point, and it was obviously too late for regrets.</p>

    <p>Professor Yang noticed Lu Youming's expression inside the bus and smiled faintly. "Sect Leader Lu, you don't look very good. Did you not sleep well last night?"</p>

    <p>"Ha ha ha! It might be the chest pain I got last night when I was doing my breathing exercises!" President Lu made up a random excuse and tried to look as natural as possible.</p>

    <p>In fact, Lu Youming and his group's movements were all being controlled by the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>The organizational structure of the Office of Strategic Deception was more complete than the other sects expected. In addition to the seven main departments that made up the sect's core, i.e. the supervisory and investigation team, logistics team, medicine team, magic treasures team, spirit beast team, goon squad, and recreation team, there were many other hidden sect departments that weren't shown on the official website.</p>

    <p>That was because the light forces' official website only required a sect to indicate at least six core departments...</p>

    <p>Because Lord Diulei had only written brief introductions and overviews for seven major departments, a lot of people assumed that this was all that the Office of Strategic Deception had, when in fact it wasn't.</p>

    <p>In addition to the above seven core departments, there were other departments that weren't mentioned, such as the patrol and guide team, intelligence team, scientific research team, delivery express team, and even a film production team...</p>

    <p>The Office of Strategic Deception was an enormous sect that brought together all the types of trade which sects engaged in nowadays. Its future development was naturally geared toward becoming a Sky-level first-class sect!</p>

    <p>This was the master sect plan which Lord Diulei had been putting together for a very long time.</p>

    <p>It would be impossible to fulfill such a long-cherished wish without official backing. This was also the reason why Professor Yang had agreed to be a visiting official as well as the leader of a team in the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>A lot of times, as long as you thought carefully about it, you would be able to figure it out.</p>

    <p>Lu Youming was someone who did a lot of thinking, so the moment he saw Yang Bingchuan, he knew that something wasn't right, but the current situation was already beyond his control...</p>

    <p>The Office of Strategic Deception's intelligence team had naturally found out that Lu Youming and this group were going to start something. This was because not long ago, Lord Diulei had worked with Ah Mai to secretly launch an attack on Mo Immortal Castle, the underground intelligence organization in Songhai city... Now, all of Mo Immortal Castle was under the Office of Strategic Deception's control. Ninety percent of their assets had been confiscated by Huaxiu Alliance, while the remaining ten percent was absorbed by the Office of Strategic Deception as initial funds for an affiliated organization.</p>

    <p>The Lord and the Lady of the Castle had no other choice, because Ah Mai had come bearing the signatures of the Ten Generals. If they resisted with all their might, they would only be thoroughly destroyed and sent to prison to play mahjong!</p>

    <p>At present, the intelligence team was being managed by Qin Lang as team leader.</p>

    <p>After Devil King woke up from the game, he planned to travel around the world. Qin Lang's method of sending out tree roots into the air to look for information lay a fine foundation for the intelligence department. With Qin Lang in command, the Lord and Lady of the Castle naturally didn't dare act rashly as part of the intelligence team.</p>

    <p>"What Sect Leader Lu is seeing now from the bus is just the tip of the iceberg that is the Office of Strategic Deception," Professor Yang said mildly.</p>

    <p>Lu Youming nodded. "The scale of the Office of Strategic Deception is truly unprecedented... I am in awe."</p>

    <p>Professor Yang's words were a warning.</p>

    <p>As an experienced veteran, Lu Youming naturally heard it.</p>

    <p>But Professor Yang didn't directly expose Lu Youming's operation.</p>

    <p>Because the current Office of Strategic Deception wasn't afraid of trouble cropping up at all.</p>

    <p>As the sightseeing bus passed a massive shed, Professor Yang looked out the window and said leisurely, "What you see now is our Office of Strategic Deception's Number 1 Heavenly Dao Broccoli Farm. Number 1 Farm is currently the largest of its kind in all of Huaxiu nation. The Heavenly Dao broccoli which our sect produces will go on the market in the future, and will be sold in supermarkets as well as food markets, marked with the Office of Strategic Deception's label of authenticity."</p>

    <p>"How... is a Heavenly Dao broccoli different?" A lot of the sect heads felt like they were choking.</p>

    <p>"Studies have shown that the Heavenly Dao broccoli which our sect grows can alleviate the problem of toxins which can accumulate in the bodies of cultivators below the Soul Formation stage. Put simply, it's a laxative."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Furthermore, long-term consumption can extend a person's lifespan. Our sect head, Lord Diulei, who is also Chief of the Office of Strategic Deception, will personally eat Heavenly Dao broccoli produced by our sect at the opening ceremony," Professor Yang said.</p>

    <p>When he said this, someone gave a sudden sneer. "I was wondering how good it was. Unless eating this broccoli will help you comprehend Heavenly Dao, it's nothing much."</p>

    <p>"That will depend on how you eat it; who knows, you really might be able to comprehend Heavenly Dao."</p>

    <p>Professor Yang replied with a smile, "Nationally renowned botanist Zhang Xiaohua, who wrote the authoritative work on the cross-breeding of spirit plants, <em>History's First Chaos </em>, has joined our Office of Strategic Deception as the leader of the spirit plants team."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, the expressions of these sect heads of major sects froze. Even Zhang Xiaohua had joined...</p>

    <p>Professor Yang: "Professor Zhang said that, while the chances are certainly very low, you can sense Heavenly Dao by consuming Heavenly Dao broccoli; that's why we call it Heavenly Dao broccoli. There is so much false advertising out there nowadays, but our Office of Strategic Deception only deals in what's real!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
