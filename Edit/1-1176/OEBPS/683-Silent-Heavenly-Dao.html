  <h1>Chapter 683 Silent Heavenly Dao</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was a full hour since the start of the live stream, and thousands of people had already been banned from "Singers Institute's" live stream room. Two administrators with the nicknames "Mr Li" and "Zhang Fei" banned anyone who mentioned the keywords "lip-sync" or "piracy" for seven days, regardless of the actual situation; even some of the live streamer's fans who carried his tags suffered the same treatment when they came asking about the situation.</p>

    <p>Father Wang stared at the live stream room, speechless and helpless.</p>

    <p>Yet this live streamer didn't seem flustered at all. The black half-mask completely and neatly hid the subtle changes in his expressions. Father Wang now seemed to understand why the live streamer wore a mask in his live stream - it was because he had no face at all!</p>

    <p>After a little over an hour, Father Wang started to see Yang Zhong interact with the fans in the live stream room: "It turns out everyone thinks that this song 'The Starry Sky's Language of Love' sounds good? In fact..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang thought this guy had finally gotten a conscience and was going to apologize; who knew he would abruptly go the other way: "In fact, the song is well written, and I sing it well! Right! As the original singer of this song, my singing is really too outstanding!"</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "..."</p>

    <p>"Oh, by the way, I'm about to upload this song to a music platform. When the time comes, I hope everyone will download 'Singers Institute's Record.' Currently, no version of this song exists on the Internet because I haven't uploaded it yet. After we upload the record later on, I hope everyone will download it in support. If you like it, click 'Follow' or 'Favorite,' then comment on it! It'll be on NetEase Cloud Music! You just need to search directly for 'The Starry Sky's Language of Love'!"</p>

    <p>After hearing this, Father Wang felt the urge to smash his keyboard for the first time ever.</p>

    <p>He didn't feel like this even when he had writer's block, but after hearing the other side shamelessly dupe the audience, Father Wang was truly enraged... He was stunned and couldn't understand how a person could be so thick-skinned!</p>

    <p>The most important thing was that this guy actually wanted to upload the song ahead of him. This guy had to be crazy... This was outright infringement!</p>

    <p>Next to Father Wang, Lie Mengmeng was also surprised when he saw this. "If this person does this, we'll probably sue him, wouldn't we?"</p>

    <p>"We definitely will!"</p>

    <p>Father Wang said, "This song's copyright belongs to me. What he's done is an act of theft... Worse still, it's for commercial use. If a tremendous amount of money is involved, he might be put away for several years. But I don't think he's brave enough to do it on his own; it's probably the guild behind this person that's helping him out."</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng nodded. "I think so too. This person seems quite young, and is unlikely to have the guts to do it himself."</p>

    <p>Furthermore, how many people had already been banned?</p>

    <p>In Lie Mengmeng's eyes, the two administrators in the live stream room were already no different from lunatics... Basically, they were the type to ban people right away regardless of the actual situation; whether you were a passerby asking a question or a fan looking for an explanation, as long as you raised this issue, you would be banned.</p>

    <p>When Lie Mengmeng had opened an account to comment in the live stream room before, he had just typed a question mark and was immediately banned for seven days.</p>

    <p>"Really, I've never seen such a shameless person before." Lie Mengmeng gave a heartfelt sigh</p>

    <p>"That's right, this type of disavowal tactic is truly shameless. Compared with my delayed chapter updates and extraneous words, I'm simply a pure white lotus..."</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng: "..."</p>

    <p>This case of copyright infringement wasn't over yet; Father Wang knew that he needed to get even tougher. The important thing right now was to continue collecting evidence of the other party's violation of copyright and go through the relevant certification procedure for the copyright of "The Starry Sky's Language of Love" as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>Since Father Wang had decided not to use that big big big big shot behind him, this battle was destined to be drawn-out slightly longer than the ones before, and it was going to be a battle that revolved around fans from different circles. Live stream fans vs novel fans... which side was stronger? Father Wang was looking forward to finding out.</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, Zhuo Yi had already picked out a whole kit for himself. The shoes, coats, undergarments, socks and even the briefs he would be wearing were all genuine magic treasures; most crucially, he had never heard of them before. It could only be said that it was just like <em>shifu </em>to walk an extraordinary path... even the magic treasures he used weren't the same as the ones on the market.</p>

    <p>You could now search the ranking of basically every magic treasure on a relevant magic treasure app, but there wasn't any information at all on these magic weapons from Wang Ling. He had picked them from the original <em>Eight Classes of Divine Weapons </em>text; the book that was sold on the market was the incomplete version, and a lot of the data it contained was too lacking to be inputted into the software app.</p>

    <p>As a result, the magic treasures from the original <em>Eight Classes of Divine Weapons</em>couldn't be found in the online magic treasures software.</p>

    <p>After Zhuo Yi was done picking out the magic treasures he wanted, Wang Ling silently noted them down, then took back the exercise book. He would give this exercise book to the Heavenly Dao later in exchange for the materials to make the magic treasures.</p>

    <p>Moreover, Wang Ling had deliberately used very elaborate writing inside the exercise book in order to exchange it for a larger amount of materials.</p>

    <p>Since he would be making more magic treasures this time, Wang Ling felt the materials might still not be enough.</p>

    <p>He wondered if the Heavenly Dao accepted copies...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling pondered this, chin in hand.</p>

    <p>Heavenly Dao: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was July 25th on Tuesday in the fourteenth week of the semester.</p>

    <p>Today was the day the overseas returnee elites of the Demon Hunters Association had organized to attack Number 60 High, but the school was as calm as always.</p>

    <p>At the pancake stall in front of the school gate, Uncle Qiu still enthusiastically served the students early in the morning. As the old man who sold Chinese pancakes in front of Number 60 High's gate all year long, he heard most of the rumors of Number 60 High.</p>

    <p>As Chen Chao passed by, he bought a pancake and put five yuan into the money box next to the old man's cart. "Here you go, uncle!"</p>

    <p>"Got it, just leave it there." Uncle Qiu nodded and then very proficiently poured out a layer of batter on the pancake cart, spread it evenly, and directly cracked two eggs on it.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "Uncle, I gave you money for one egg..."</p>

    <p>Uncle Qiu: "It's fine, it's a promo today, buy one and get one free."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "... By the by, uncle, do you know that a bunch of criminals have declared that they're going to attack our school today?"</p>

    <p>Uncle Qiu raised his eyebrows. "Do you mean the Demon Hunters Association?"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao nodded. "That's right! The Demon Hunters Association. Aren't you scared, uncle? You're so close to the school, what if you get pulled into it?"</p>

    <p>Uncle Qiu: "There's nothing to be afraid of; I've been selling pancakes in front of your school gate for so many years, there aren't any demons and ghosts I haven't seen."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "..."</p>

    <p>This was indeed true. Uncle Qiu had been selling pancakes at Number 60 High's front gate for many years, and seniors from the previous years presumably had all seen him. Most importantly, almost everyone at Number 60 High had bought Uncle Qiu's pancakes before. Old Li at the school gate especially loved to eat them!</p>

    <p>Uncle Qiu: "That Shadow Stream group that came to pick a fight with your school a few months ago - isn't the grass on their graves taller than a man now?"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "..."</p>
