  <h1>Chapter 530 Er Ha's Paranoia </h1>

  <div>

    <p>The villa that Lord Diulei had bought in Wenxian Garden was in a luxury villa district populated by the wealthy and the respected. The villa Lord Diulei himself lived in was in the bungalow zone, and the house prices there were shocking. There were bungalow and townhouse zones in the villa district, and while the houses in the townhouse zone were actually more affordable, Lord Diulei had preferred to live alone to begin with.</p>

    <p>But after living alone for a long time, it was unavoidable that he would sometimes feel a little lonely. Therefore, Xiao Yin's arrival had added some spice to Lord Diulei's life.</p>

    <p>About an hour after leaving the Wang family's small villa, a light green figure appeared under the sun at the gate to Wenxian Garden villa estate.</p>

    <p>This really was Er Ha's first time visiting Lord Diulei's place, but it had already gone out on its own several times before, after all, so it wouldn't get lost. Anyway, even if Er Ha couldn't find its way in Songhai city, it could give Zhuo Yi a call, and someone from a nearby branch office would immediately come to pick up this "lost green dog offorgiveness <sup>1</sup> ."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Related to green as the color of infidelity, and possibly forgiving a person for it.)</dfn>

    <p>But that was a last resort.</p>

    <p>In fact, Zhuo Yi was quite busy these days; it could be said that he was deeply troubled by the Demon Hunters Association. In addition to that, they were still appraising the evidence related to the "big shots" that had been sent to Songhai First Prison, and the final verdict had yet to happen; it would be at least another six months before the actual trials.</p>

    <p>But that didn't mean that Zhuo Yi would be idle in those six months. Not only had he been a participant in the major incidents that had happened previously, he had also directed the operations, so he had to personally approve all aspects of the process himself. Signing, stamping his seal, auditing - it was the same thing every round, and only after one round was over could he start on the next one.</p>

    <p>In reality, it hadn't been long since Zhuo Yi had become Wang Ling's disciple, but it really wasn't easy for him to bear all this pressure.</p>

    <p>Earlier at home, Wang Ling had already planned to prepare a birthday present for Wang Ming for August 1st, Army Day. In fact, he had also thought about getting a present for Zhuo Yi, which could be considered his first gift as a teacher to his disciple.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling hadn't decided exactly what to give him yet.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Er Ha waited for a while on the opposite side of the road from the entrance to Wenxian Garden villa estate. It had already sent Xiao Yin a text message asking him to pick it up. However, it had already been ten minutes and Xiao Yin still hadn't done anything.</p>

    <p>This guy probably hadn't read the text...</p>

    <p>Forget it...</p>

    <p>The corners of Er Ha's eyes twitched as it decided to do things the old-fashioned way: pick an outer wall and climb over it.</p>

    <p>But the security measures at the upscale Wenxian Garden villa estate were too good. After Er Ha jumped onto the outer wall, he patted the top with its dog paw and found that a transparent barrier had actually been set up, just like a glass dome. When Er Ha smacked it, it thumped loudly.</p>

    <p>This hardness...</p>

    <p>Could easily withstand a Soul Formation bombardment!</p>

    <p>In the end, this was an upscale villa estate, and its security measures were airtight.</p>

    <p>Er Ha walked along the barrier for several dozen meters and realized that the outer walls were all wrapped up in this barrier; not even a bird could fly through it... Wall invasion plan, failed!</p>

    <p>At that moment, Er Ha took out its cell phone for a look, and saw that Xiao Yin still hadn't replied... It immediately despaired a little.</p>

    <p>It had no other choice now but to try walking through the main entrance.</p>

    <p>Sighing in its heart, Er Ha jumped off the outer wall and walked toward the main entrance again. But just as it got to the gate, it suddenly realized with a start that the guards there were looking at it strangely.</p>

    <p>"Is this... the dog?</p>

    <p>"Mm, seems like it..."</p>

    <p>The two guards were speaking in low voices, but Er Ha could hear them extremely clearly.</p>

    <p>Instantly, Er Ha's mind was filled with news of cases in which pet hunters had pretended to be familiar people before kidnapping spirit beasts. For example, there was a type of pet hunter that would pose as a security guard for a residential area and catch the unwary spirit beasts that wandered around in the area.</p>

    <p>Was this... the Demon Hunters Association's revenge?</p>

    <p>The moment it met the gazes of these security guards, Er Ha was almost instantly on the alert.</p>

    <p>So it turned out that this group of people had been lying in wait for it here!</p>

    <p>In a split second, Er Ha promptly thought about escaping â€” there was no guarantee that this "Demon Hunters Association" bunch wouldn't chase it down and intercept it on the street, so it was no use running outside. It had to look for help from someone it knew! Lord Diulei's house was in this villa estate, so it had to find Lord Diulei first!</p>

    <p>At this thought, when Er Ha met the gazes of these security guards, it instantly raised its paw and pointed at the sky. "Look! A Playful Blue Moon <sup>2</sup> !" It didn't know if there was something too magical or charming about these words, but the security guards really did straightaway look in the direction it was pointing!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(A Chinese RPG game.)</dfn>

    <p>Er Ha felt that this was a tried and true trick.</p>

    <p>It had also used this move to deal with the "bone dragon man" group from the Demon Hunters Association the last time!</p>

    <p>The moment the security guards turned their heads, Er Ha darted into the villa estate and ran...</p>

    <p>When the guards turned back, the lyrics of a song suddenly came to mind.</p>

    <p><em>Anticipating some luck and a shock... How miraculous is this encounter... Climbing over the mountaintop ahead and above the white clouds... The green light is overthere <sup>3</sup> </em>.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(From the song "Green Light" by Stefanie Sun.)</dfn>

    <p>Er Ha was way too fast!</p>

    <p>It directly turned into a green ray of light right before the eyes of the guards...</p>

    <p>Dazed, the head of security then hurriedly knocked the heads of the two guards together. "Why are you still spacing out! Hurry up and chase it! You must have scared it!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Er Ha hadn't run very far when it noticed a group of security guards on segways and a car chasing it!</p>

    <p>There were five of them! That was a pretty big lineup! And behind the five guards, there was actually a little sports car!</p>

    <p>This wave stunned Er Ha... Was the Demon Hunters Association spending all their capital on capturing it?!</p>

    <p>But actually, Er Ha thought that this group of people might not be from the Demon Hunters Association and might be pet hunters from some other organization. How much guts did these people have to make a move when the country was currently cracking down on the illegal trafficking of spirit beasts?</p>

    <p>They were actually openly pursuing a dog of the people in an upscale villa estate in broad daylight...</p>

    <p>Come to think of it, where was the villa's security?</p>

    <p>Were they so poorly managed that they didn't even know that their security guards were fake?</p>

    <p>As Er Ha ran, it cast a glance behind at the men chasing it.</p>

    <p>Logically speaking, the less noise pet hunters made when capturing spirit beasts, the better. However, this group was so loud, as if they were afraid people wouldn't know what they were doing.</p>

    <p>For some reason, Er Ha felt something wasn't right...</p>

    <p>As it ran, moreover, it noticed that there seemed to be more and more people behind it. Some were on segways, and some were directly running.</p>

    <p>Er Ha couldn't bear it any longer, and when it got to an intersection, it stopped and turned around to ask, "Why are you chasing me?"</p>

    <p>The main point was... it wasn't carrying any Ji Zhi Syrup <sup>4</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>4</sup>(This refers to a TV ad in which a leopard chases a woman down for the Ji Zhi Syrup she's holding ..)</dfn>

    <p>When they saw that Er Ha had stopped, the horde of security guards also all stopped chasing it...</p>

    <p>They all yelled in their hearts in unison: <em>Fuck! Finally stopped! This dog can really run!</em></p>

    <p>After gasping for air, the team leader jogged over to stand in front of Er Ha and saluted. "May I ask, Mr Dog, are you here for Mr Thunder?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha nodded weakly...</p>

    <p>The team leader then opened the door of the sports car behind him. "We're here to pick you up!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>
