  <h1>Chapter 322 Do You See That Pretty Boy Up Ahead with the Dead Fish Eyes? </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Father Wang's black cigar had a unique origin, and people with little life experience wouldn't recognize it. But the head of Kitchen Knife Sect was different. Jiang Haifu might only be at the late Golden Core stage and hadn't graduated from any renowned university due to how poor his family had been when he was a kid, but he was the founder of a sect, after all. All these years, he had traveled all over the world to collect all kinds of food ingredients â€” he could sniff out the celestial treasures which had been added to this cigar.</p>

    <p>When Father Wang had been exercising his poisonous tongue to its fullest, Jiang Haifu's subordinates around them had already been unable to take it. If it wasn't because there were other parents and teachers here as well as for the sake of Kitchen Knife Sect's face, they would already have long rushed Father Wang and bore him away.</p>

    <p>But when these people saw Jiang Haifu's face suddenly turn pale, they were stunned; they had rarely seen such an expression on the sect leader's face.</p>

    <p>Just a moment ago, he had still looked like he was choking down his anger. But when he saw that black cigar, he had instantly turned to stone.</p>

    <p>After being lost in thought for a full minute, Jiang Haifu came back to his senses and took out a lighter to give Father Wang a light. He said a little faintly, "Brother, your cigar... it's not bad! Where did you buy it?"</p>

    <p>He didn't use the same impatient tone as earlier; after seeing the black cigar which Father Wang had pulled out, Jiang Haifu felt like he had been cut down to size in front of the other man.</p>

    <p>"Oh, a fan gave this to me." Father Wang took one puff on the cigar and blew out a light smoke ring, downplaying his words.</p>

    <p>The corners of Jiang Haifu's mouth twitched violently. "..."</p>

    <p>A... fan gave it to him?</p>

    <p>What kind of fan could gift this kind of national treasure level cigar?!</p>

    <p>His eyes were glued to the cigar in Father Wang's hand, a look of envy on his face. It was difficult to experience the effects of this cigar unless you were above the Golden Core stage. The cigar smoke wouldn't make people choke at all, and instead had a delicate and undefinable fragrance of fine perfume.</p>

    <p>If you were in the middle of seclusion in particular, and could smoke this type of cigar every day, you would simply gain twice as much in your cultivation for half the effort. Furthermore, it also had the effect of preventing inner deviation... There was a good saying: A smoke after, and you will surpass the immortals <sup>1</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Basically, smoking is a comfort..)</dfn>

    <p>This kind of national treasure level cigar was something you could only obtain fortuitously.</p>

    <p>Father Wang gazed at Jiang Haifu with a knowing expression. Then he smiled. "I only brought one out with me today. If you want, I'll send some to you later on. That fan of mine sends me some every six months."</p>

    <p>Jiang Haifu was stunned for a moment, and then laughed like a peach blossom flowering. "How can I accept that..."</p>

    <p>"We're both parents, don't be so polite! Our sons are in the same grade; from now on, they can look after each other at school." Father Wang smiled, squinting. "My son's name is Wang Ling, Ling in 'command' <sup>2</sup> . He's very introverted and probably doesn't have any friends in the other classes."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>('Command' in Chinese is 'ming ling..')</dfn>

    <p>Jiang Haifu nodded. "That'll be good! We actually run a restaurant. Brother Wang should come by whenever you're free..."</p>

    <p>On the side, several Kitchen Knife Sect disciples were already dumbstruck at this scene. It hadn't been long, but they were already calling each other brother.</p>

    <p>If ladies could build a friendship over a handbag, then there were times when men could build a friendship over a cigar or a glass of wine.</p>

    <p>By then it was already their turn, and the teacher at the school gate very seriously verified their identities. Father Wang stood by the gate and waited for Wang Ling to come out of the gym.</p>

    <p>He stood next to Jiang Haifu and pointed at Wang Ling from a distance. "Do you see that pretty boy up ahead with the dead fish eyes? That's our Wang Ling."</p>

    <p>The corners of Jiang Haifu's mouth twitched again. "..."</p>

    <p>He finally understood that Father Wang's poisonous tongue was a natural and genuine part of him; even his own son wasn't spared. Pretty boy with dead fish eyes? Who would slander their own son like that?</p>

    <p>Jiang Bai and Jiang Yan came out first, just in front of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Seeing that Father Wang had introduced Wang Ling, Jiang Haifu began to introduce his own son. "The one wearing a white shirt inside the school uniform is my son, Jiang Bai. The girl next to him is my second brother's daughter, Jiang Yan."</p>

    <p>Father Wang tsked. "So thin?"</p>

    <p>Jiang Haifu sighed. "Mm... my son is a bit more of a homebody and usually doesn't eat much. Look at how big I am, Brother Wang, yet he's so thin and completely unlike me that I can't believe he's my son. He doesn't have even the smallest bit of my majestic genes..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang couldn't help laughing. "There are times when genes really can't be explained scientifically."</p>

    <p>Father Wang felt he had the most say in this matter.</p>

    <p>Both he and Mother Wang weren't very gifted, but they had given birth to Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>After collecting Jiang Bai, Jiang Haifu handed a name card to Father Wang before he left. Looking at it carefully, Father Wang was surprised to find that Kikkaro Restaurant was also one of Kitchen Knife Sect's businesses. Grandfather Wang had worked there for a period of time when he had been younger. He had started out as a cook, then later rose to head chef and became a food consultant for some time.</p>

    <p>"So this Kikkaro Restaurant is your business?" Father Wang raised his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>"Mm, this can be considered our Kitchen Knife Sect's brand, and is the foundation of my Kitchen Knife Sect. All our supply chains revolve around the profits of Kikkaro Restaurant." Jiang Haifu couldn't help laughing. "In fact, I was lucky. When I was young, I was once instructed by an expert who gave me a recipe. Otherwise, this Kikkaro Restaurant business wouldn't have been able to get off the ground."</p>

    <p>And so, Father Wang and Jiang Haifu, Head of Kitchen Knife Sect, got to know each other just like that.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling and Jiang Bai came out of the gym, both of them were bewildered.</p>

    <p>As reality showed, sometimes men's friendships weren't that complicated. Put simply, it was just a matter of finding common ground.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After saying goodbye to Jiang Haifu and the others, Father Wang led Wang Ling toward a park. There were a lot of people on the streets now, so brazenly teleporting home would be too eye-catching.</p>

    <p>Besides, given the thing with Shuigou Sect now, security had been significantly increased in in every area, and there was a police car parked on almost every street.</p>

    <p>Father Wang sighed deeply at the sight.</p>

    <p>"Ling, don't you think this is a little peculiar? The police are out in force, but even in this tight net, there hasn't been the slightest trace of this Shuigou Sect... it's too strange!" Father Wang frowned and looked at Wang Ling as he spoke.</p>

    <p>In that moment, Wang Ling also felt deeply helpless.</p>

    <p>To be honest, Shuigou Sect's appearance had actually surprised him. After all, the furor over the Immortal Mansion incident had yet to completely die down, and just when the government was using Immortal Mansion as a launching pad in a bid to crack down on the dark forces, this type of sect which revelled in crime had popped up.</p>

    <p>Father Wang had been about to continue analyzing the situation, but in the end, when the both of them approached the park, they could hear the faint sounds of a girl shouting up ahead: "You're not my dad! I'm not going with you! You... who are you?! Let me go!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's gaze narrowed to a point in the distance.</p>

    <p>He saw a man in a woollen hat gripping a girl's wrist and dragging her along as he cursed non-stop. "You damn kid! Hurry up and come home!"</p>
