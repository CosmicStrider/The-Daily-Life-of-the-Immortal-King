  <h1>Chapter 259 White Night Spell </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Lao Gudong's words sounded like a joke, but his eyes were extraordinarily serious. His past predictions about what would be tested in the college entrance exam had all been on point. Therefore, Number 60 High School had been consistently number one in the district over the years in class scores for history.</p>

    <p>The "White Night Spell" was Immortal She Pi's specialty, but most people had never heard of it. This was because most of these skill specialties had been developed by the users themselves.</p>

    <p>As a follow-up to Immortal She Pi's renowned supreme skill, Lao Gudong recalled something interesting. "Do you remember the lesson I gave you on the Gua Pi War about a month ago?"</p>

    <p>That lesson was still fresh in everyone's minds.</p>

    <p>Because it was during that lesson that Lao Gudong had shared gossip related to Immortal She Pi's end, which was that before being executed, Immortal She Pi had been found to be pregnant, and had left a child behind.</p>

    <p>"During the trial in the morning, that devil stated that he had been sealed away in the stone ghost mask before Immortal She Pi had been caught, so he hadn't known anything at all about his own disciple's situation after that."</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong tsked and shook his head. "In my opinion, if Immortal She Pi is still alive, I'm afraid that he'll be much, much harder to deal with than the old devil. Back then, the melon rind which was reputedly developed by Devil Emperor Gua Pi had in fact been made by Immortal She Pi, who had been years ahead of his time in terms of drugs and weapons research. In other words, he had already mastered the heart of science and technology during that era!"</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, Lao Gudong sighed with a little regret. "Unfortunately, he misused this knowledge and strayed off the right path."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Teacher Ye Han's PE class was in the afternoon. He was quite popular in the ranking of school teachers. There was a good saying that if looks weren't enough, then height would make up for it... Because of his naturally curly blonde hair and his tall and large frame, he was very popular with the girls.</p>

    <p>Before the start of every PE lesson, there would always be girls around him asking how they could lose weight: How could they get rid of unwanted flab? Were there any target exercises that they could do? Teacher Ye would always answer these questions very patiently.</p>

    <p>But today, his figure looked a little lonely...</p>

    <p>Both elite classes had the PE lesson together. When the students from Class Two and Class Three came together for the lesson this time, the girls' attention was all focused on the new transfer student.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing was escorted by a group of girls out of the school building. This bunch of people were so absorbed in talking and laughing that they didn't even hear the bell. It was only when Teacher Ye angrily shouted at them twice that the girls scattered reluctantly and obediently got into line.</p>

    <p>This was Fang Xing's first PE lesson after coming to Number 60 High School and it was Teacher Ye's first time meeting him. After the girls around Fang Xing had scattered, Teacher Ye began to look the new transfer student up and down.</p>

    <p>Hm... he had really long legs!</p>

    <p>Teacher Ye felt that 'chopstick spirit' wasn't a good enough way to describe the length of Fang Xing's legs anymore. From what he could see, 'stilt spirit' was more accurate!</p>

    <p>The students lined up according to height; Fang Xing was one hundred and eighty-eight centimeters tall, so he was last in the boys' line. Noticing that Teacher Ye was staring at him, he hurried closer and greeted him with a smile. "Hello, Teacher Ye! I'm Fang Xing."</p>

    <p>The voice caught Teacher Ye a little off guard as he stared blankly.</p>

    <p>It was only after a long, stupefied moment that he responded.</p>

    <p>"Oh, Student Fang... hello!"</p>

    <p>To be honest, he felt a little embarrassed â€” what kind of student hadn't he seen after being at Number 60 High School for so many years? He had actually been struck dumb for three seconds by a transfer student! No wonder this Student Fang Xing was so popular with the girls.</p>

    <p>Teacher Ye couldn't help sighing slightly with sorrow... how nice it was to be young! He had been young once too!</p>

    <p>After calming down, he stood at the front and clapped his hands. "Alright, as usual, everyone warm up first! Follow behind me as we run, make sure to keep up your speed and pace! As you're running, make sure to stay in line, otherwise, you'll do another round!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was next to Guo Hao, his heart as tranquil as an ancient well.</p>

    <p>This familiar jogging session... was just as troublesome as usual.</p>

    <p>Jogging was a matter of endurance, but the rules in cultivation high schools were different compared with normal schools; it wasn't just about building up endurance, it was also about tempering concentration. As everyone jogged, they also had to maneuver their swords to float above their heads.</p>

    <p>This was a special exercise method which experts from the city Sports Department had come up with.</p>

    <p>Jogging itself didn't have much of an impact on the endurance of cultivators. Even an early Foundation Establishment stage cultivator would be able to jog for a day and a night as long as their spirit energy didn't run out. But with the need to control a sword at the same time, this became a great test of spirit. Controlling the sword and jogging simultaneously also consumed more spirit energy, which would toughen the students up.</p>

    <p>"I was worried before that this would be too intense for you, so all this time I've gotten you to use the special teaching spirit swords which, comparatively speaking, consume less spirit energy. But I want to increase the difficulty today." Teacher Ye smiled. "Please take out your personal spirit swords. Compared with the teaching spirit swords, your personal spirit swords consume energy at a normal rate, and controlling your swords as you jog will deepen your rapport as well as help spawn a sword spirit as soon as possible."</p>

    <p>Compared with the start of the semester, Wang Ling wasn't as awkward now when he took Jingke out in public.</p>

    <p>After he had come back from the spirit sword exchange meet at Number 59 High School, everyone in Number 60 High School knew that he used a peach wood sword, so it wasn't unusual anymore.</p>

    <p>Therefore, when he heard Teacher Ye's request, Wang Ling summoned Jingke agreeably enough and held it in his hand.</p>

    <p>Of course, the focus was actually still on Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>"I wonder what kind of sword Classmate Fang Xing uses." At that moment, a lot of girls gave Fang Xing curious looks.</p>

    <p>But Fang Xing rubbed the back of his head a little apologetically. He looked at Teacher Ye with some embarrassment on his face. "Teacher Ye, I use a knife."</p>

    <p>"Oh, did you major in knife techniques at your previous school?" Teacher Ye nodded his head. "That's fine, the theory behind knife and sword techniques is pretty much the same. Generally, if you can control a sword, then you can control a knife. Student Fang Xing is so outstanding, there definitely won't be any problems if you use a knife!"</p>

    <p>"But everyone is using a sword... wouldn't it be strange for me to use a knife?" Fang Xing asked.</p>

    <p>Teacher Ye laughed loudly. "Student Fang Xing, don't worry. Since you've come to Number 60 High School, you're one of us. No one will laugh at you!"</p>

    <p>"But Teacher Ye... my knife, it's a little big." Fang Xing still had his concerns.</p>

    <p>"It's fine, Student Fang!" Teacher Ye's gaze was firm as he patted Fang Xing on the shoulder.</p>

    <p>"...All right then."</p>

    <p>Under everyone's gazes, Fang Xing finally took out his big knife from the pocket of his school uniform.</p>

    <p>Then, under everyone's terrified gazes...</p>

    <p>A fully forty-meter long steel broadsword stretched down the center of the sports field.</p>

    <p>Teacher Ye: "..."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>
