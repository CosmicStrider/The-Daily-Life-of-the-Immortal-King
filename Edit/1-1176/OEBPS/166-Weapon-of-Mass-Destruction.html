  <h1>Chapter 166 Weapon of Mass Destruction </h1>

  <div>

    <p>In ancient times, people smashed rocks on their chest; today, a weaponized chest had been used to smash handcuffs...</p>

    <p>Looking at the crushed handcuffs, Jiang Liuying abruptly felt moved in her heart, as if she had performed a historic feat.</p>

    <p>The main reason was because this armor-penetrating talisman was just too useful!</p>

    <p>Elder sister had drawn this specialized talisman, and it was more destructive than the regular ones sold on the market. This was the reason why she had been able to generate enough power to directly reduce the handcuffs to smithereens.</p>

    <p>Without the restraints of the handcuffs, Jiang Liuying could feel her spirit energy recover significantly.</p>

    <p>Although the restraining magic array under the prison had played a role in suppressing her spirit energy, she had gradually gotten used to the restrictive environment during her time in prison. Her body had two golden cores that were like two CPUs, so her spirit energy circulated much faster than ordinary people's. In a restrictive environment, she could still use half of her strength... this had played a vital role in helping her escape from prison!</p>

    <p>For an ordinary major criminal, without the help of the prison's resistance crystal, and limited both by the restraining magic array under the prison and the handcuffs, it would be utterly impossible for them to flee.</p>

    <p>But the girl felt that her chances of escaping were now much higher.</p>

    <p>This prison covered quite a vast area; she had only escaped from the main building. She was currently in a training zone three kilometers behind the main building, in a grove of trees. This was where prisoners came to exercise, but now it had become a hideout for Jiang Liuying.</p>

    <p>If she rushed out recklessly, the prison officers who were already searching for her nearby would catch her straightaway...</p>

    <p>Her priority now was to make use of the invisibility talisman in the escape service pack and find a sewer leading out of the prison as soon as possible. Before the armor-penetrating talisman lost its effectiveness, she could use her chest weapon to smash a hole in the protective barrier outside the prison wall; the high steel wall around the prison was ridiculously thick, so there was no way she could smash her way through from inside.</p>

    <p>Under the circumstances, Jiang Liuying already had no other choice; she only had one last chance at escaping out of here!</p>

    <p>In the grove, the girl grit her teeth and circulated her spirit energy to activate the invisibility talisman. She stuck it on her body, then sped off in one direction.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Half an hour later, after the prison officers patrolling outside had found the crushed handcuffs on the ground, Secretary Sun and Zhuo Yi swiftly reached the scene with a group of other people.</p>

    <p>When he saw that the handcuffs had been reduced to pieces, the warden's heart trembled with fear, and his expression was distressed. With the restraining magic array in place and handcuffs on, how had the other party destroyed these specialized handcuffs?</p>

    <p>"The other party had the strength to escape, so it would make sense that she could destroy these handcuffs." Secretary Dakang stared at the handcuffs and thought for a while. "But what kind of thing could have such destructive power? Little Zhuozi, do you have any ideas?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi's expression was blank. "..."</p>

    <p>The old Secretary continued to speculate: "The handcuffs used in the national maximum security prison are all made of extremely dense and highly refined black iron; that this lady could actually damage them so badly proves without a doubt that the other party is carrying some weapon of mass destruction."</p>

    <p>Warden: "Old Secretary, do you think this prisoner will harm the other major criminals in our prison?"</p>

    <p>"Not really." Secretary Sun shook his head. "From the beginning, this lady's objective had been to escape from here. It's very likely that instead, she'll use the weapon of mass destruction to destroy the high prison wall or the protective barrier outside the wall."</p>

    <p>Just as he said this, everyone heard an earth-shattering boom .</p>

    <p>The warden spoke into his transceiver. "Go and check at once! What was that sound?"</p>

    <p>Very soon, a reply came from the prison gatekeepers on the other end of the transceiver. "Reporting! We found the target, she's destroying the barrier!"</p>

    <p>Warden: "Then go and quickly subdue the target!"</p>

    <p>Prison officer: "Reporting! The target is moving very fast. It seems that she's using an invisibility talisman. We're using a scanner to locate her..."</p>

    <p>Warden: "After determining her position, immediately seize her weapon and arrest her!"</p>

    <p>"...Seize? Seize her weapon?"</p>

    <p>At the maximum security prison barrier, the scanner showed that the girl had exposed herself.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>A group of prison officers watched as the girl held her breasts in her palms and did her best to try and smash the barrier with them, and they couldn't help sinking into deep thought.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was June 4th, the sixth Saturday after the start of the semester.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling woke up and turned on the TV in the morning, he found that all the channels were broadcasting the same news â€” at around six o'clock last night, a major criminal had broken through the barrier of Songhai's maximum security prison and successfully escaped.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was surprised to see that this person was actually that girl who had been caught at Number 59 High School back then. From their related investigation, the cultivation police had confirmed that she was in fact the younger sister of the Master of Shadow Stream. Because of her identity, she had been directly sent to Songhai First Prison without trial.</p>

    <p>After careful calculation, Wang Ling realized that it had been three weeks, almost a month, since she had been caught.</p>

    <p>" Ai , so many officers in the prison and they were still no match for a girl." Sitting in front of the TV, the old man ate a mouthful of green vegetable porridge before directly turning the TV off.</p>

    <p>"Dad, why did you turn off the TV?" Father Wang had been enjoying the news since this girl had a really big chest... of course, this wasn't the point. The main point was that Father Wang wanted to continue watching the news report as he was curious about how this girl had actually broken out of prison.</p>

    <p>The old man shook his head. "Even without watching the rest, I can roughly guess what's going to happen next. Based on their usual style, if anything big happens, the department leaders involved will probably deny all responsibility. If you don't believe me, I'll turn it on again for you to see..."</p>

    <p>The old man turned the TV on again. Coincidentally, the news at that moment was showing the person-in-charge at Songhai First Prison making a statement.</p>

    <p>In a crowd of reporters with flashing cameras and a bunch of microphones, a middle-aged warden had a remorseful expression on his face. "We deeply regret making everyone worry! The situation this time in fact isn't as serious as it seems. We have issued a nationwide top-priority arrest warrant, and we are already on the trail of the fugitive. We will assemble our forces right away to capture and arrest the criminal."</p>

    <p>A female journalist with black-rimmed glasses asked, "Warden Liang, can you explain the main reason for how this prisoner was able to escape?"</p>

    <p>"In fact, the fault this time lies with our new prison staff. They still aren't familiar with the business, so during the time the wanted criminal was in custody, they made some mistakes in their check..."</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, this Warden Liang lowered his head with a grieved expression. "Yes, that's right. This was all the part-timers' fault!"</p>

    <p>Father Wang and Wang Ling: "..."</p>
