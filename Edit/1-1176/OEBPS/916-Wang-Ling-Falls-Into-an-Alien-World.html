  <h1>Chapter 916 Wang Ling Falls Into an Alien World</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Also, what?" asked Lord Diulei hurriedly.</p>

    <p>Breaking off at the end of a chapter was disgraceful.</p>

    <p><em>But if the author is very handsome, he believes that the readers may forgive him!</em></p>

    <p>"I heard Senior Immortal mention before that the keeper of order came back here from the future to carry out a discreet, private investigation?" said Shen Eryue, unperturbed.</p>

    <p>"Brother Gu Shunzhi..." Lord Diulei patted his head; when he was flustered, he would forget things, and he had actually almost forgotten this senior! That shouldn't have happened!</p>

    <p>This was a person who maintained the order of the universe, and furthermore had been appointed by Heavenly Dao. In this sort of inexplicable situation, the keeper of order would indeed know more than ordinary cultivators.</p>

    <p>But for some reason, Lord Diulei felt a vague sense of unease, and his face tensed up as he had a bad feeling.</p>

    <p>After stepping into the extraordinary realm that was True Venerated, his understanding of Heavenly Dao had reached a new level. The game pods in front of him were covered in a disturbing and unusual force which had nothing to do with the power of Heavenly Dao!</p>

    <p>What on earth was this?</p>

    <p>"Let me contact Senior Gu." Lord Diulei pulled up Gu Shunzhi's number.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi wholeheartedly admired Wang Ling's strength after their fight and had wanted his phone number. In the end, it was Lord Ma who gave him a number, but when Gu Shunzhi dialed it, the call was intercepted by Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>This was one of the treatments Wang Ling got as the group favorite; the Office of Strategic Deception would automatically intercept calls from any unknown number as a precaution and shelter Wang Ling from the world, thus upholding world peace in passing.</p>

    <p>This month, the Office of Strategic Deception had already shut down a number of small, illegal moneylenders and arrested over a thousand text scammers.</p>

    <p>A lot of these swindlers had been sending texts from the same company, and when they were tracked down, the entire company was stamped out.</p>

    <p>In addition, the Office had also arrested plenty of extraordinary swindlers claiming noble connections - they caught over ten thousand "First Emperor Qins," and after interrogation, there was still one person at the moment who was pig-headedly insisting that he was the reincarnation of First Emperor Qin.</p>

    <p>Dialing Gu Shunzhi's number, Lord Diulei waited for the call to go through. However, Gu Shunzhi's voice was slow to sound on the other end. Several seconds later, Lord Diulei suddenly heard an ear-piercing sound on his phone!</p>

    <p>"Watch out!" At the critical moment, Shen Eryue abruptly stretched out his hand and smacked the phone away before sending it flying out of the Internet cafe with a kick.</p>

    <p>" <em>Boom </em>"! There was a deafening sound.</p>

    <p>The phone caused a nuclear explosion and a massive mushroom cloud rose up outside the Internet cafe.</p>

    <p>"This..."</p>

    <p>Having narrowly escaped death, Lord Diulei wasn't able to calm down for a long time.</p>

    <p>It was all too terrifying.</p>

    <p>If it hadn't been for Shen Wuyue, and this phone had exploded next to Lord Diulei's ear, he might not die given his current realm, but he would still be gravely injured by the blast.</p>

    <p>This was a surprise bomb attack which had caught them completely off guard.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, Shen Wuyue had lightning quick reflexes!</p>

    <p>As a legendary divine beast, the kydeer's ability to sense danger was indeed greater than that of a regular person.</p>

    <p>Was this a warning...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei sunk into silence for a very long time.</p>

    <p>The enemy they were facing this time was unlike any they had faced before.</p>

    <p>They didn't have a clue!</p>

    <p>Nor were they prepared!</p>

    <p>So much so that they couldn't guard against it at all.</p>

    <p>The other party had launched attacks one after another, like a dealer behind the scenes who rigged the game however he wanted.</p>

    <p>What the hell kind of enemy was this?</p>

    <p>They had no idea at all.</p>

    <p>"How was it? Did the call go through?" asked Shen Wuyue.</p>

    <p>"That was a warning."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei frowned deeply. "I'm afraid something might have also happened to Senior Gu."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>As reality proved, Lord Diulei's premonition was spot on.</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, Gu Shunzhi had indeed run into unprecedented trouble.</p>

    <p>Before that unusual energy had covered the game pods, Gu Shunzhi had already sensed it while exploring the flow of space-time spirit power in the outer domains.</p>

    <p>As he stood in place and felt it out for a moment, Gu Shunzhi was startled when he couldn't sense where this unusual energy was coming from.</p>

    <p>"What in the world is this..." Gu Shunzhi couldn't help murmuring.</p>

    <p>He closed his eyes after that, and his consciousness connected with Heavenly Dao Space.</p>

    <p>Since he was having difficulty sorting this out, he could only ask the Heavenly Dao little golden men and see if the six Great Heavenly Dao knew the source of this unusual energy.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi landed in the office of the Heavenly Dao Governing Committee.</p>

    <p>The six Great Heavenly Dao seemed to have foreseen his arrival.</p>

    <p>"You've come," Strength Heavenly Dao said gloomily.</p>

    <p>Although Strength Heavenly Dao's expression was indistinct, this clearly wasn't his usual voice, which sounded a little down.</p>

    <p>"What on earth is going on?" Gu Shunzhi asked as the keeper of order; vaguely, he had a bad feeling.</p>

    <p>As someone who maintained the order of cosmic space and was acknowledged by the Domain of the Gods, it was utterly ridiculous for him to have no idea at all what was going on.</p>

    <p>Besides Strength Heavenly Dao, the rest of the Heavenly Dao were silent.</p>

    <p>This made Gu Shunzhi even more nervous.</p>

    <p>This had never happened before.</p>

    <p>After a long silence, Strength Heavenly Dao said, "Beyond the Domain of the Gods."</p>

    <p>"Beyond the Domain of the Gods?" Gu Shunzhi was startled.</p>

    <p>He wore the same expression as Lord Diulei when the latter heard of this phrase for the first time.</p>

    <p>"You are the keeper of order, but there are some places you can't oversee."</p>

    <p>Heavenly Dao murmured a little dully, "The universe we're in is infinite. The Founder of Heavenly Dao once said that the universe in essence is like a matryoshka doll: there are layers within layers, and mountains beyond mountains."</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi had traversed all kinds of cosmic space, but this was the first time he had heard this theory.</p>

    <p>He had an utterly shaken expression on his face.</p>

    <p>"You see the giant rock, but not the high mountain behind it; you see the river, but not the sea it flows into..." Strength Heavenly Dao sighed.</p>

    <p>All the Heavenly Dao didn't utter a word; the entire Heavenly Dao Governing Committee was lifeless, as if the end of days had come.</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren, Ling Zhenren might have a solution!" Gu Shunzhi's voice resounded in the space.</p>

    <p>Ever since his fight with Wang Ling last time, he had become a fanboy.</p>

    <p>He could vaguely guess what Wang Ling's identity was, but didn't dare confirm it.</p>

    <p>In terms of strength, Gu Shunzhi admitted that they weren't on the same level.</p>

    <p>At the very least, Wang Ling's strength wasn't even in the same dimension.</p>

    <p>It already could no longer be measured by realm.</p>

    <p>"It's too late, he's already been sucked in." As Strength Heavenly Dao spoke at that moment, he waved one hand, and an image appeared in the air; it was the very scene of Wang Ling and the others sealed inside the game pods.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi: "How can this be..."</p>

    <p>Strength Heavenly Dao: "In no more than an hour, the spirit qi of this world will be completely enveloped by this unusual energy... who knows if we'll be able to weather this calamity."</p>

    <p>The more Gu Shunzhi thought about it, the more he felt something wasn't right. "But I'm from the future."</p>

    <p>Strength Heavenly Dao: "Haven't you noticed?"</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi: "???"</p>

    <p>Strength Heavenly Dao: "Your body is starting to fade."</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi: "No, I'm fine."</p>

    <p>Strength Heavenly Dao: "When you disappear, the first thing to go is usually where you store your Yang energy."</p>

    <p>"Ah?"</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi unbuckled his belt and checked his crotch. "No, it's still there!"</p>

    <p>Strength Heavenly Dao: "I meant the golden core in your dantian! See whether your golden core is still there or not!"</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, Wang Ling and his group arrived in a completely unfamiliar city.</p>

    <p>They landed on a mountain top, and in the far distance were the splendid lights of a city. This wasn't Earth, and it didn't contain the slightest trace of spirit qi.</p>

    <p>"Can't perform magic?" Wang Ling tried using several regular spells one after another, but none of them worked.</p>

    <p>There was no spirit qi in this world, which meant no spirit energy. Without spirit energy, he naturally couldn't cast any spells.</p>

    <p>Currently, the only thing Wang Ling could use was Heavenly Dao spells.</p>

    <p>These were driven purely by primordial qi. In addition, Wang Ling's condition was a little unique, as his primordial qi was something that his body had naturally produced since he was little.</p>

    <p>It was because he couldn't control this primordial qi that not long after his birth, Wang Ling drew a talisman seal which he stuck on himself.</p>

    <p>He never expected the primordial qi to come in handy now.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling braved the cold wind on top of the cliff while Fang Xing, Chen Chao, Guo Hao and Su Xiao were still unconscious. They had fallen into this place the instant the doors of the game pods closed.</p>

    <p>It was very clear that this wasn't the game.</p>

    <p>But a trap.</p>

    <p>They had been sent into another world...</p>

    <p>"Hey, it's useless to just stand around - you may as well check out the situation." A familiar voice rang out as someone appeared behind Wang Ling. It was none other than Bai Qiao.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had already known that Bai Qiao was also here, since he had sensed her aura the moment they landed.</p>

    <p>"I looked around up ahead just now; the people here all look strange, and this looks like an alien planet." Bai Qiao pursed her lips; she obviously knew that this wasn't the game. Pulling her cap down, she folded her arms in annoyance. "I was halfway through my game when I suddenly fell here with you lot. When I find out who did this, I'm going to cut them up!"</p>

    <p>"Mm." Wang Ling responded indifferently.</p>

    <p>Sitting with his legs crossed, he finally plucked out one of his King's Eye out of his eye socket and tossed it into the sky.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling could vaguely sense the conspiracy in all this.</p>

    <p>It had happened so abruptly that he didn't even have time to respond.</p>

    <p>Even his eyelid hadn't twitched.</p>

    <p>This was a major event, but he hadn't even had a prophetic dream.</p>

    <p>That was enough to prove how powerful the enemy was.</p>

    <p>At the moment, he tossed out the King's Eye out for a clear and full picture of this world.</p>

    <p>As Bai Qiao said, this was a planet that was tens of thousands of times larger than Earth which was inhabited by strange lifeforms.</p>

    <p>Some were octopuses that looked like coal balls which sprayed transparent ink as they walked down the streets, like the water trucks that washed the roads clean.</p>

    <p>Some were jelly-like creatures that were soft and boneless with wide, pitch-black eyes, wandering along the streets.</p>

    <p>There were also all kinds of monsters on two legs with human-like forms; some looked like demons and devils, but weren't.</p>

    <p>This was because there wasn't any demon or devil qi on them.</p>

    <p>"This world doesn't have spirit energy but has its own set of rules; those monsters use an energy source different from ours." At that moment, Fang Xing regained consciousness.</p>

    <p>"You were actually awake?" Bai Qiao was a little surprised.</p>

    <p>"I have a White Transformation Spell which doesn't require spirit energy to be used; I looked around the city a bit just now," Fang Xing said. "However, they speak another language, which I can't understand."</p>

    <p>"Won't the whole world eventually wind up speaking Mandarin?"</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao sneered, then looked at Chen Chao and the others who were still lying on the ground. "What are we going to do with them? We won't be able to do anything if we take these deadweights with us!"</p>

    <p>"Calling them deadweights is too much - naturally, they have their uses." Fang Xing patted Chen Chao's face and woke him up.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao felt like he had been asleep for a very long time. He rubbed his eyes before opening them blearily.</p>

    <p>The scene in front of him gave him a huge shock. "Holy shit, what is this place?"</p>

    <p>"You're already inside the game world, in a simulation of a city. Since this is your first time linking up to the virtual game pod, your mind is a little unstable, which is normal." Fang Xing smiled as he earnestly spouted nonsense.</p>

    <p>"Is that so... Why do I feel like you're lying? Don't tell me that we all fell into an alien world?" Chen Chao rubbed his face to clear his head a little.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Fang Xing and Bai Qiao: "..."</p>

    <p>At that moment, Chen Chao noticed Bai Qiao on the side. "This girl is...?"</p>

    <p>"This is the boss of the Office of Strategic Deception's Internet cafe. Her surname is Bai." Fang Xing made the introductions.</p>

    <p>"Hello, Miss Bai." Chen Chao's face reddened with some embarrassment. "This is the first time I've seen a girl more beautiful than Student Sun Rong; she doesn't feel quite real! Miss Bai is like a fairy from a painting and doesn't seem human."</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao placed one hand on Fang Xing's shoulder with the expression of one admitting defeat. "I take back what I just said."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing smiled in reply. "You'll get used to it."</p>

    <p>"So what's our situation?" Chen Chao looked around, feeling a little lost.</p>

    <p>"This game is a little different; we're unable to use spirit energy. Also, the BOSS is hiding somewhere, and the clues are in the city up ahead." Standing on top of the cliff, Fang Xing gazed at the city in front of them. "The game is set in an alien city; unfortunately, this city hasn't been fully converted to Chinese, and the monsters all speak an alien language."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao rubbed his chin and nodded. "Is there a time limit?"</p>

    <p>"Twenty-four hours," Fang Xing answered.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing knew that making things up like this wasn't right.</p>

    <p>But there was no other option.</p>

    <p>He had to keep Chen Chao and the other two calm.</p>

    <p>There were times when a white lie was necessary.</p>

    <p>After all, Chen Chao, Guo Hao and Su Xiao were just high school students.</p>

    <p>If they knew the truth, it would be a problem if they couldn't withstand the pressure.</p>

    <p>This wasn't a game.</p>

    <p>They had fallen into an alien world on an alien planet.</p>

    <p>And the person who had summoned them was still watching from the shadows.</p>

    <p>If they didn't do this right, they would die.</p>

    <p>"No equipment?" Chen Chao asked after some thought.</p>

    <p>"No." Fang Xing shook his head.</p>

    <p>"Then I think I know how we can clear the game," said Chen Chao. "Have you played GTA?"</p>

    <p>Fang Xing: "I have..."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "This game should be more or less like Vice City; once we enter the city, we just need to create as much havoc as possible. After all, we won't die, right? After that, we'll definitely trigger the main plot or sub-plot. When that happens, we can follow the clues back to the BOSS - even if he's hiding, he'll have to come out and face us when the time comes."</p>

    <p>"No! No one will die! Since you've said so, I'm not worried anymore." Fang Xing smiled and nodded, his face full of gratitude.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Bai Qiao: "..."</p>
