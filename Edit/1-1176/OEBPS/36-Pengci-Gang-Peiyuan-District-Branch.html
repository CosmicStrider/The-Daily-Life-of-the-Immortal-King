  <h1>Chapter 36 Pengci Gang, Peiyuan District Branch </h1>

  <div>

      

      <p>After receiving the assignment from Liang Wei, the old lady from the Pengci Gang had been lying in wait behind a tree for a long while. The instant the people from Number 60 High School drew near, she straightaway locked her eyes on Wang Ling in the crowd.</p>

      <p>She was just an ordinary old lady without any cultivation. Because of her aging and slack skin, her thick eyelids were completely creased and drooped to cover most of her eyes.</p>

      <p>However, this little obstruction to her vision wouldn't stop her from committing pengci.</p>

      <p>Wang Ling was the pengci target indicated by the client, and the experienced old Madam Dong had practised her expertise perfectly for years.</p>

      <p>Madam Dong was one of the four elders of the Peiyuan district branch of the Pengci Gang. She didn't have any cultivation, but she was able to become a chief elder of the gang after so many years, recognized by handsome old men and pretty old ladies alike, so she definitely had outstanding abilities of some sort.</p>

      <p>First of all, Madam Dong had incredible eyesight.</p>

      <p>She was over seventy years old, but she still had eyes like a hawk. It was an ability which those ordinary, long-sighted old men and women revered! In a crowd of people, she could quickly lock onto the pengci target indicated by a client and perfectly execute her objective.</p>

      <p>Secondly, when she was young, Madam Dong had actually been a top student... of course, she herself didn't think it was anything worth bragging about. But it was precisely because of this that she could consolidate her position as an elder.</p>

      <p>The moment Wang Ling came into sight, Madam Dong immediately calculated the speed and distance between them.</p>

      <p>She estimated that there was twenty meters between them. Currently, Wang Ling was walking at a speed of six meters per second... so, she just needed to jump out from behind the tree at a speed of four meters per second at the same time...</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>As a result, after two seconds...</p>

      <p>Everybody saw an old woman hobble toward Wang Ling, throw away the walking stick in her hand with a clatter and grab onto the leg of his pants, her body twitching and her face full of pain.</p>

      <p>Wang Ling hadn't expected to really encounter a pengci fraudster. He remembered when he had gone through the Gate Between Worlds to rescue Old Li — the demons that had touched him had all been reduced to ashes. A lot of his power was being constrained by the quickly deteriorating talisman seal on his arm, plus the old woman didn't have much strength. Otherwise, if this had happened a couple of days later, when the talisman seal expired for real...</p>

      <p>In his heart, Wang Ling was thinking that this old lady would probably be instantly reduced to fine powder...</p>

      <p>Of course, Wang Ling had no intention of helping her up, since he had never been able to control the strength in his hands. Besides, this old lady had no cultivation at all; it would be bad if he wasn't careful, and tore her arms off.</p>

      <p>"Old grandmother, are you okay?" Sun Rong crouched down and asked in a soft voice.</p>

      <p>Although everyone from Number 60 High School were well aware that this old lady had deliberately committed pengci... the rule in a civilized society had always been that the weak are always right.</p>

      <p>In this Spirit Energy Information era, cultivators now typically had access to a quality education — who would dare commit pengci at a cultivator's feet?</p>

      <p>The old lady could consider herself lucky that she hadn't been chopped up by a sword!</p>

      <p>She acted very realistically; for a long time, she twitched madly on the ground without uttering a single word, as if she was having an epileptic fit.</p>

      <p>It was only until Sun Rong and Lin Xiaoyu had repeatedly asked more than ten times if she was alright that the old lady turned around trembling and pointed weakly at Wang Ling, gasping for breath. "You! You..."</p>

      <p>"???" Guo Hao and Chen Chao were dumbfounded, wearing black expressions like question marks on their faces.</p>

      <p>Nowadays, the Pengci Gang's acting skills were certainly pretty good. But it appeared that they weren't very dedicated to their work! The pengci elderly used to spare no effort to throw themselves under the wheels of a car. But forget a car, there wasn't even a two-wheeled bicycle here. She actually had the gall to accuse Wang Ling to his face of knocking her down in broad moonlight?</p>

      <p>Guo Hao curled his lip. "This old grandmother, please be reasonable. Since we're not using any means of transport, how can you say that my classmate knocked you down?"</p>

      <p>If the person committing pengci had been an ordinary old man or woman, they might have withered in the face of Guo Hao's derisive inquiry.</p>

      <p>But as an elder of the Peiyuan district branch of the Pengci Gang, Madam Dong was worthy of her name. It was her exceptional pengci style that distinguished her from the rest. Seeing her composed expression, the group from Number 60 High School understood...</p>

      <p>...Clearly, this old lady was already a seasoned veteran.</p>

      <p>Confronted with Guo Hao's noteworthy question, Madam Dong just sat stock still on the ground before slowly pointing feebly at Wang Ling. "It was him... he assaulted me with spiritual pressure!"</p>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p>Spiritual pressure assault...</p>

      <p>Realization instantly dawned on everyone — fuck! This was the new pengci ruse!</p>

      <p>Guo Hao rested his forehead heavily in his hand. Sure enough, the older the ginger, the spicier it was! Who would have thought that there would be someone who would come up with this pengci strategy?</p>

      <p>"How about we just call the police?" Lin Xiaoyu was thoroughly at a loss.</p>

      <p>"Call the police?" Madam Dong hummed. "Do you know how many people our Pengci Gang has? As long as this student compensates me, I'll let it go."</p>

      <p>"How much do you want then?" Sun Rong sighed. Anything that could be solved with money wasn't a problem for her.</p>

      <p>The old lady stretched out a palm. "I don't want much, just five million..."</p>

      <p>Five million...</p>

      <p>Although it wasn't a huge sum to Sun Rong, it wasn't something she could come up with straightaway.</p>

      <p>She could already tell... this wasn't just a simple case of pengci — this old lady was deliberately making trouble for them!</p>

      <p>"Why don't you just go and rob someone?!" Chen Chao couldn't take it anymore.</p>

      <p>Only after he said it did he realize...</p>

      <p>That was what she was doing right now! Robbing them blind, to boot!</p>

      <p>Before they could recover from their shock, she pointed at Wang Ling again. "Also, I'll only accept compensation from this student and no one else. We pengci members are also professionals!"</p>

      <p>"..." Lin Xiaoyu felt that her three views <sup>1</sup> had been refreshed.</p>

      <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The 'three views' refer to values, life philosophy, and worldview. This is taken from the phrase "to destroy three views," which is used to complain about something disappointing enough to disillusion someone.)</dfn>

      <p>Nowadays, even the Pengci Gang was beginning to stress professionalism... this nation was in danger of collapsing!</p>

      <p>"Let's just call the police, and get her locked up." Guo Hao sighed, helpless.</p>

      <p>"Ho ho... you still want to send me to prison? You have guts."</p>

      <p>The old lady smiled at them mockingly. "Why don't you give me a reason first?"</p>

      <p>Guo Hao rolled his eyes. "You popped out of nowhere and randomly grabbed my classmate's leg. As the saying goes, men and women shouldn't touch intimately. You may be old and shrivelled, but you can tentatively still be considered a woman, yes? Then, aren't you a child molester? In cultivation court, this would be a felony!"</p>

      <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p>The corner of Madam Dong's mouth twitched sharply.</p>

      <p>A child molester? Is your child 1.8 meters tall? A giant baby?!</p>

      <p>Obviously, Madam Dong didn't buy it. "Even if you send me to the police station, I'll be out in two days. But then all of you will need to watch out, since our Pengci Gang is all over the nation... if this student compensates me, I'll let it go. Otherwise, our gang's chief elder will personally make sure this debt is settled."</p>

      <p>"You dare to threaten us?"</p>

      <p>Sun Rong glared fiercely at Madam Dong; this was truly the first time that she had encountered such an unreasonable pengci fraudster. "Do you know who..."</p>

      <p>Before she could finish her sentence, Wang Ling slowly strode forward, blocking Sun Rong from the old lady with his body.</p>

      <p>Because at that moment, he had already gotten a clear and complete look at Madam Dong's memory.</p>

      <p>Since this was a plot by Liang Wei and the others which was aimed specifically at him, Wang Ling naturally didn't want to get other people mixed up in it.</p>

      <p>After all, he had already thought of a hundred ways to deal with this old ruffian lady...</p>
