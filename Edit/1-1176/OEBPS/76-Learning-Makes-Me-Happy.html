  <h1>Chapter 76 Learning Makes Me Happy </h1>

  <div>

      <p>Wang Ling sat at his desk, which had a lot of workbooks on it. Although he had participated in the four-day spirit sword exchange meet as a school representative, Teacher Pan's homework principle hadn't changed — what should be handed in had to be handed in, and you had to make up the homework, however much you missed.</p>

      <p>The spiritual intelligence of the two pen and eraser gremlins was linked to Wang Ling; he could order them to do his homework for him, with the condition that he had already mastered the required knowledge for the assignments. Since he had missed a full four days of classes, what he had to do now was to catch up on the content from this period. It would be fine to give the task of writing to the pen and eraser gremlins later.</p>

      <p>It took him two minutes to compile a study list for a clearer picture of this week's content. He realized that there was actually a lot of knowledge he had missed out on, especially in cultivation physics and cultivation advanced maths. The teachers for these two classes had actually assigned five worksheets each to be completed in one weekend!</p>

      <p>One word to describe it: infuriating!</p>

      <p>Yet another word to describe it: insane!</p>

      <p>...This was probably the first reaction and the attitude of most students at seeing this large pile of assignments.</p>

      <p>In contrast, Wang Ling was someone who really loved to study. From a young age, he had taught himself cultivation spells, including the Three Thousand Great Spells. Just like how a baby is born with five senses and hair, from the moment of his birth, these spells had already existed deep in his mind... but he learned language and culture through his own efforts. Moreover, he also really enjoyed the learning process.</p>

      <p>Only studying could make him happy!</p>

      <p>At his desk, Wang Ling opened a textbook, put in his earplugs, and then went into self-teaching mode. Before, he hadn't been able to stop hearing people complain in his ears; the reason these earplugs were able to cut off the endless telepathic voices from his Mind-Reading Ability was very simple — they had been made from the same materials used to produce the Dao talisman seal; furthermore, they had been personally created by Wang Ming himself.</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>It was a peaceful and quiet weekend, and Wang Ling's eyelid warning alarm hadn't issued any sort of advance alert.</p>

      <p>Around noon, a grey commercial Chuanjianguo <sup>1</sup> limousine came to a stop not far from the Wang family's small villa.</p>
      
      <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Chinese netizens joke that Trump (Chinese pinyin: 'chuangpu') is 'Chuangjianguo,' which translates to "nation-building Trump.")</dfn>

      <p>"Miss, we have arrived, it's here."</p>

      <p>In the limousine, a well-dressed old butler turned his head and spoke to a young girl.</p>

      <p>The girl sitting with her slender legs crossed looked to be only about twelve years old, and was not very tall. She was wearing a pair of capri jeans, a loose, branded hip-hop shirt, and an Arale cap with the two little eye-catching wings sticking out on each side <sup>2</sup> .</p>
      
      <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Arale is the main character in the Japanese cartoon series Dr Slump, who wears a trademark cap with her name on it; occasionally it has two little white wings sticking out on each side.)</dfn>

      <p>This was a little Lolita with a delicate face and the appearance of a child star; luckily, there weren't many people around the Wang family's small villa, otherwise this girl would definitely have been recognized.</p>

      <p>Of course, she did enjoy the glorious feeling of being recognized at a glance, but now that she had arrived at a place that had very few passerbys, she already had no expectations whatsoever of anyone here recognizing her. With a little sigh, she peeked out the window at the Wang family's small villa not far away. "The guy elder sister has taken a fancy to is in that villa?"</p>

      <p>"Yes, we've already thoroughly investigated this matter, Miss..."</p>

      <p>"Eh?! Are you sure you didn't make a mistake? How can my future brother-in-law be a pauper living in such a remote suburb?"</p>

      <p>"There's absolutely no mistake, Miss. This is the address I was given when I inquired with Eldest Miss' chauffeur, Lu Zhao," the old butler replied precisely. "But I must remind Miss that it is too early to call him brother-in-law. Although free love is advocated nowadays, the matter of Eldest Miss' marriage is very complicated. When she was born..."</p>

      <p>"Okay, okay, you don't have to tell me these things. You're so annoying..." The girl rolled her eyes. "It's about the Yin and Yang Death Calamity, right? I already know all about it! I also know that back then, that fortune-telling sham already told all of you how to break it."</p>

      <p>The old butler broke out in a cold sweat. "Miss, be careful with your words, that is an Exalted Immortal from Mo Immortal Castle..."</p>

      <p>The girl shrugged helplessly. "It's the Scientific Cultivation era now! Where do all of you get so many feudal superstitions from?! I really don't think that old sham's solution is reliable... what 'When Yin and Yang fall into chaos, our Mo blood will paint the sky'... doesn't that simply sound like crazy nonsense?"</p>

      <p>The old butler shook his head with a bitter smile. "Better to believe the worst and be pleasantly surprised, than to be optimistic and face the worst! Besides, these are the words of the Exalted Immortal from Mo Immortal Castle... Eldest Miss has to find the person powerful enough to paint the sky red with Mo blood in order to break the death curse."</p>

      <p>The girl couldn't be bothered to continue debating with the intractable old butler. Instead, she straightened her clothes and got ready to get out of the car. She gave the butler a look. "Has the gift been prepared?"</p>

      <p>Since they would be meeting for the first time, a gift was a must so that Huaguo Water Curtain Group's reputation wouldn't be tarnished. This was what the family had taught Sun Yu since she was a kid.</p>

      <p>The old butler handed Sun Yu a cosmic storage bag. "Miss, in the storage bag there are two longevity peaches which can extend life and cure constipation; two youth-retaining, moisturizing elixirs to nourish the skin and cure constipation; two Xuanhuang detoxification pills to clear the intestines and cure constipation; two Eight Immortals health pills to nourish the stomach and cure constipation. Also, there are..."</p>

      <p>"...Enough!"</p>

      <p>Sun Yu didn't wait for the chatterbox butler to finish speaking before she grabbed the storage bag with some annoyance and hurried out of the car.</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>The young girl stood at the front door of the Wang family's little villa, completely unaware that a serious man was currently immersed in studying on the second floor.</p>

      <p>Dithering in front of the door for a moment, Sun Yu racked her brain for opening remarks. It was a weekend... the person who opened the door might not be that guy classmate her elder sister was interested in; there was a high chance it could be one of his parents.</p>

      <p>Also, once the door was open, should she introduce herself with her real name or her stage name?</p>

      <p>Her stage name was Xuetao, which she thought was relatively well-known. But there was no guarantee that her reputation had reached such a rural place... it would be very embarrassing if she used her stage name and they didn't know it.</p>

      <p>Just as she had mustered up her courage and was about to knock on the door, a couple of silhouettes suddenly flashed in front of her eyes and two strong men ten feet tall unexpectedly jumped down from the roof beam of the house...</p>

      <p>"Bloody hell! Who are you?" Sun Yu was stunned.</p>

      <p>"Miss, we are very sorry."</p>

      <p>One of the strong men looked at the girl and said seriously, "...No one can disturb my Lord when he is concentrating on his studies!"</p>
