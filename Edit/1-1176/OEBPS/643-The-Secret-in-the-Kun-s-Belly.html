  <h1>Chapter 643 The Secret in the Kun's Belly</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Red Moon Blade Disk was like a gear wheel, and when Immortal Zhenyuan did the incantation, it grew steadily in size, its blades sharp enough to cut the sky open!</p>

    <p>When the might of a world-defying magic weapon was truly unleashed, its destructive power was undeniably earthshaking. Red Moon Blade Disk's spinning blades cut into the adult scavenger kun's weakened body inch by inch as a huge amount of blood gushed unceasingly from the wound.</p>

    <p>The corrosive blood flowed out slowly like lava. The moment it touched the ground, it corroded and burnt the earth, sending up billows of thick smoke.</p>

    <p>Both Er Ha and Xiao Yin had sealed their nasal orifices. The smell was so foul that if they didn't cut off their sense of smell, they might suffocate here.</p>

    <p>"It really works!"</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan was pleasantly surprised in his heart. This hammer was too useful!</p>

    <p>When all was said and done, this was Senior Dog, who was actually able to create such a powerful limited use magic weapon... It could only be used ten times in total, he should use it sparingly!</p>

    <p>The adult scavenger kun erupted with a pained scream, and it seemed that the mysterious angler on the other side of the rift had sensed it. Under the angler's control, the adult scavenger kun that had come scouting out of the rift started to pull its upper body back.</p>

    <p>"Want to leave? Forget it!" Zhenyuan grit his teeth and went all out with Red Moon Blade Disk. In a flash, the disk grew hundreds of inches more in size and directly cut off the entire upper body of the adult scavenger kun along with the "fishing line" on it!</p>

    <p>"Repair!"</p>

    <p>The moment the scavenger kun's body was cut in half and fell, Immortal Zhenyuan directly extracted primordial qi from the heart demon stone as an energy source and used a "sky-repairing stone" to plug up the crack. The sky-repairing stone was made from artificial synthetic cultivation industrial materials for the purpose of repairing space rifts. It was very expensive, but very effective in repairing space.</p>

    <p>But Er Ha's heart was still shaken when it saw Immortal Zhenyuan take out the sky-repairing stone. This single sky-repairing stone... could probably buy five houses in Jinghua city...</p>

    <p>This was in the end a cultivation big shot who was a legend among mankind. Fishing out such a costly stone so nonchalantly just caught Er Ha off guard.</p>

    <p>After mending the abnormal space rift, Immortal Zhenyuan breathed a sigh of relief. He had initially wanted to conserve the power of the primordial qi stored in the heart demon stone and use spirit energy instead to activate the sky-repairing stone. While this would result in a successful repair, it was quite time-consuming. Now, using primordial qi as the main energy source, the sky-repairing stone actually stoppered the space fissure in just a short while.</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan had never done a comparison so hadn't noticed it before. Looking at this difference now, he realized that the disparity between spirit energy and primordial qi was really a little big!</p>

    <p>Gazing at half the body of this adult scavenger kun, he was about to draw closer for a look when it actually directly turned into rotting mud on the spot, corroding the surface of the ground to create a large pit.</p>

    <p>"Not dead?" Immortal Zhenyuan frowned.</p>

    <p>"This is a prehistoric vicious beast, there's no way it would die so easily," Xiao Yin said on one side. Holy beasts and vicious beasts were like polar opposites: holy beasts were mainly attributed with spiritual intelligence, and vicious beasts with brute strength. At a later stage of growth, however, there actually wasn't any difference in their levels of strength; it was only during the middle stage when they developed different attributes.</p>

    <p>Vicious beasts thus were extremely resilient; even if half their bodies were cut off, they could still survive as long as their cores weren't damaged.</p>

    <p>But finding the core inside the body of such an enormous vicious beast wouldn't be easy.</p>

    <p>A vicious beast's core was very small, the size of a millet grain.</p>

    <p>In a normal situation, a person fighting a vicious beast for the first time would already be using all his might in battle, and simply wouldn't have time to consider looking for the core at all.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin stared at the rotting sludge and sighed in his heart. If it was Master, killing a vicious beast like this would be a piece of cake, wouldn't it?</p>

    <p>He couldn't help recalling when he had fought Master for the first time. At the time, Master had been wearing a sports jacket, and he had very coolly raised his hand to slap Xiao Yin in his beast form and send him flying! Xiao Yin vividly recalled his feelings at that moment. He hadn't felt enraged, nor had he felt pain... Instead, after he was thrashed, he had been excited by that addictive sense of strong oppression!</p>

    <p>Now that Xiao Yin carefully thought about it...</p>

    <p>It was probably from that moment on when he had already set his heart on Wang Ling as his master.</p>

    <p>Thinking this, Xiao Yin still felt some regret in his heart.</p>

    <p>Who knew when Master would be able to hit him again...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The adult scavenger kun fled, leaving behind this young scavenger kun that had already escaped the angler's control. The young scavenger kun itself wasn't aggressive, unless someone was pulling the strings behind it. Now that the fishing line attached to this scavenger kun was already cut off, it lay motionless on the ground.</p>

    <p>The Three Views-Shattering Hammer's weakening function had a crowd effect that could forcibly weaken oncoming opponents who bore malice. Before this state of weakness completely disappeared, Immortal Zhenyuan continued to use Red Moon Blade Disk with the intention of operating on this scavenger kun's body to see what on earth was inside it.</p>

    <p>Since he couldn't find the core, he just needed to continue doing damage to this scavenger kun...</p>

    <p>Furthermore, a young scavenger kun didn't have as good a recovery ability as an adult scavenger kun. Given the kun's weak "all living beings are equal" state, Immortal Zhenyuan felt that everything was now under control.</p>

    <p>"Let me see, what on earth do you have inside you..." His eyebrows knitted into a little knot. Then, he carefully manipulated Red Moon Blade Disk to perform a precise cut. The scavenger kun let out a pained roar and wanted to flee, but Immortal Zhenyuan raised his hand and a golden light pinned it in place.</p>

    <p>Er Ha's heart was shaken when it saw this, and it sighed feelingly at how awesome Little Master Ling's hammer was.</p>

    <p>This weakening effect was too abnormal...</p>

    <p>In their weakened states, neither the young scavenger kun nor the adult scavenger kun had any power to resist.</p>

    <p>This thing had rough skin and thick flesh. As Red Moon Blade Disk continued to cut into it, the first skin layer was finally completely split apart. Zhenyuan and Er Ha initially thought that they would discover some Gu bug or other inside the body. In the end, they were utterly stunned by the scene that met their eyes after the operation.</p>

    <p>Another scavenger kun was actually curled up inside this young scavenger kun...</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan: "???"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "???"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "???"</p>

    <p>Tempering an even smaller kun to act as a "Gu bug" and then using the "Puppet Gu Spell" to house the Gu bug inside another kun...</p>

    <p>What kind of operation was this...</p>

    <p>"Senior Dog, I'll try again..."</p>

    <p>A little dumbstruck, Zhenyuan had the blade disk continue spinning to cut into this second kun layer...</p>

    <p>Although it was a little hard to believe, they did indeed see it.</p>

    <p>Hm...</p>

    <p>In this second kun hidden inside the body, there was actually a third kun!</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin and Er Ha were stunned. Was this... a Matryoshka doll?</p>
