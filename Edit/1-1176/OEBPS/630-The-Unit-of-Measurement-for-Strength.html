  <h1>Chapter 630 The Unit of Measurement for Strength</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Killing intent permeated the clouds along the side. After Xiao Yin's sensitivity alerted them to it, Lord Diulei could also feel the faint killing intent within the clouds. While the other party was well hidden, Xiao Yin had still sensed him. A holy beast's power of perception was extraordinary and far sharper than a cultivator's.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, Xiao Yin was very sure that the other party was from the Demon Hunters Association.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei frowned. "It seems that President Bai has more than one trusted aide at his side. Mr Lu wasn't the closest one."</p>

    <p>"Did Mr Lu deceive us?" Xiao Yin was suspicious.</p>

    <p>"That shouldn't be the case." Lord Diulei shook his head. "Mr Lu was probably kept in the dark himself. This President Bai is very cunning!" It was true that Mr Lu was a secretary under President Bai, but who said that a person could only have one secretary?</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei couldn't help being reminded of a piece of social news some time ago... A boy used a single chat app to chat up more than six hundred girls at the same time and played with their feelings while he classified them according to their bust, waist, hips and height.</p>

    <p>If an ordinary boy could do something like this, what more then the cunning President of the Demon Hunters Association!</p>

    <p>After Mr Lu went into witness protection, Lord Diulei had actually been wary about President Bai getting revenge, but he never thought that the other party would be brazen enough to stalk them and make a move when they were out.</p>

    <p>This was an air bridge, with strict altitude control measures and all types of surveillance. It definitely wouldn't be smart to be seen attacking here. If the other party was determined to do so, then there was only one possibility, and that was that he had a magic artifact that could instantly create an isolated space.</p>

    <p>This reminded Lord Diulei of the "Wuji Umbrella" which Mr Lu had mentioned before. It was a quasi world-defying magic weapon comprised of forty-nine different types of holy beast skins, and was an incomplete product with one skin still missing.</p>

    <p>Gripping the steering wheel, Lord Diulei turned up his spiritual awareness to the fullest and pressed a red button next to the steering wheel.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "What's that?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Brother Xiao, you don't know, but this is the absolute field special modification which I added to the car. As long as you press this button, you can produce a powerful spirit magnetic shield, also called the A.T. Field <sup>1</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Short for Absolute Terror Field, from the series "Evangelion.")</dfn>

    <p>"Oh~!" Xiao Yin was enlightened. Although he didn't quite understand, it seemed very amazing!</p>

    <p>Not long after Lord Diulei pressed the button, Xiao Yin saw a bright blue spherical spirit magnetic shield encircle the car to securely protect the triphibian SUV as if it was in an egg.</p>

    <p>The purpose of this shield was to prevent the enemy from using flying swords to pierce the car at long range. There was already vehicle armor on the car, and activating the spirit magnetic shield was equivalent to doubling the protection.</p>

    <p>And just as Lord Diulei had expected, shortly after he activated the spirit magnetic shield, the other party launched a flying sword at them in a probing attack.</p>

    <p>From the image on the feed for the thermal defense system inside the car, they could clearly see a peculiar fluctuation in the spirit magnetic shield at the back of the car. This was exactly the shield's response to an attack.</p>

    <p>"Was that an invisible flying sword?" Lord Diulei did his best to remain calm.</p>

    <p>It had happened suddenly, but so far everything was within his expectations.</p>

    <p>Usually, an invisible flying sword was the most common strategy used in a probing attack. If it was successful, the vehicle would be destroyed and the passengers killed. If it failed, it wasn't any sort of loss since it was just a basic way of testing if there was a defense system in place.</p>

    <p>As the well-known "Great Death-Courting Senior" in the cultivation world, Lord Diulei had experienced all kinds of emergencies, and thus was very mindful in this regard.</p>

    <p>"Can Brother Xiao perceive what this person's strength is like?" Lord Diulei asked.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin cupped his chin and pondered for a moment before replying quickly, "Roughly as strong as four Thunders."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "???" When had he become a unit of measurement?</p>

    <p>"But this person is slightly weaker than Mr Lu. He'll be pretty easy to deal with. But we can't get off now, can we?" Xiao Yin said.</p>

    <p>It had to be said that Xiao Yin had raised a crucial problem â€” they couldn't get out of the car!</p>

    <p>That was because it was very dangerous to stop the car halfway while traveling on the sky bridge, unless you were waiting to get off the bridge. Whether you caused an accident or not, as long as you were caught stopping on camera, your license would be revoked right away.</p>

    <p>It was now very difficult to pass the test to get a driving license!</p>

    <p>And it was very clear that the other party was taking advantage of the fact that they couldn't get out of the car to take them down.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei clenched his teeth, refusing to just sit and wait for death.</p>

    <p>At that moment, a more violent attack hit them from the side. Even with double the protection, the triphibian SUV still shook hard and was almost forced out of the car lane.</p>

    <p>It was still an invisible flying sword, but its strength was much greater than the one earlier!</p>

    <p>The situation had taken a slight turn for the worse. Lord Diulei furrowed his brow. This was still a probing attack, but it was very clear that the other party's invisible flying sword wasn't aimed at him!</p>

    <p>And in fact, Lord Diulei had guessed correctly once again!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, hidden amidst the clouds, a member of the Demon Hunters Association was sitting on a floating gourd as he emitted faint killing intent. President Bai had bestowed this gourd on him, and it had the ability to create an isolated space.</p>

    <p>This person was Elder Zuo Wu, the other top-level personnel in the Demon Hunters Association apart from Elder Lu.</p>

    <p>Elder Zuo Wu had come to seek revenge today since his only little brother Strong Zuo had been captured not long ago, and the main culprit was that green-furred dog. Before that, Strong Zuo had left a soul mark on the green-furred dog (which Wang Ling had transferred to Xiao Yin). Later, President Bai sent Mr Lu to investigate the situation, but until now, Mr Lu's whereabouts were unaccounted for.</p>

    <p>Though they currently couldn't be sure whether Mr Lu had defected, Elder Zuo Wu could already no longer resist the urge to take revenge.</p>

    <p>He applied to President Bai to carry out this operation, which was quickly approved.</p>

    <p>This time, President Bai gave Elder Zuo Wu a floating gourd with the ability to create an isolated space in order to conceal himself, along with a large number of single-use invisible flying swords amounting to over six hundred in total.</p>

    <p>Since then, Elder Zuo Wu had been looking and waiting for a chance to act.</p>

    <p>In everyday life, the success rate in using an invisible flying sword to mount a sneak attack actually wasn't high. Furthermore, it was very easy to arouse suspicion.</p>

    <p>Thus, Elder Zuo Wu had waited all this time...</p>

    <p>Finally, the day when both targets set out in their car came!</p>

    <p>Furthermore, the other party even used the sky bridge!</p>

    <p>Elder Zuo Wu was well aware that no cars were allowed to stop on the sky bridge! This was thus a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity! For Elder Zuo Wu, they were moving live targets!</p>

    <p>The best would be if he could attack and destroy the car and its passengers together, and disguise it as a spontaneous combustion car accident.</p>

    <p>Elder Zuo Wu sat on the floating gourd as he secretly observed and pondered.</p>

    <p>A moment later, he untied a brocade pouch at his waist and patted it gently - over a hundred single-use invisible flying swords flew out of the pouch, and all their tips were pointed as one in the direction of the triphibian SUV.</p>

    <p>The next second, Elder Zuo Wu gave the order: "Infinite Creation of Swords <sup>2</sup>!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(From the Japanese series "Fate/Stay Night..")</dfn>

    <p>Immediately, these numerous flying swords lunged at the moving SUV...</p>
