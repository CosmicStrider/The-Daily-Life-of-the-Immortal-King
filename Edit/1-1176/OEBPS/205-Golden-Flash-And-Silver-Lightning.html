  <h1>Chapter 205 Golden Flash And Silver Lightning </h1>

  <div>

    <p>The gold crescent had unexpectedly been stopped!</p>

    <p>Everyone choked at this scene!</p>

    <p>Moreover, that rampant sword qi was just stupidly stuck there, stopped by one forefinger and unable to push forward even half an inch.</p>

    <p>Honestly speaking, Wang Ling felt that he had cut it close; if he had been a few seconds late, Thunder and Song Qingshu would have been cut down along with the house by this crescent sword qi.</p>

    <p>So far, the scene had sunk into dead silence.</p>

    <p>While keeping this gold crescent at bay, Wang Ling also sensed the energy contained in this sword qi. This young man was very formidable, stronger than the old devil's devil spirit at the Void Refinement stage as well as other cultivators whom Wang Ling had seen before.</p>

    <p>But first, he should disperse the sword qi...</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling had been able to ward it off, it felt like an unstable nuclear warhead, which made him uneasy.</p>

    <p>He raised his thumb, and after rubbing together with his forefinger, this gold crescent instantly disintegrated into golden specks which dissipated into thin air.</p>

    <p>One couldn't help associating this scene and the feelings it evoked with the lyrics of a song: You gently rub your fingertips and crumble me to pieces<sup>1</sup>...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is from the song "Can't Leave You" sung by Susan Huang)</dfn>

    <p>Everything had happened so easily and smoothly.</p>

    <p>The old devil gazed at Wang Ling; he was only looking at this person's back — and he was even wearing big white bunny pajamas, which contrasted sharply with how strong he was — and even in his dejection, the old devil recognized this person.</p>

    <p>This was definitely that junior who had crushed his ancient magic blade outside the convenience mart back then!</p>

    <p>"Who are you?" The young man from Immortal Mansion stared at Wang Ling, cold sweat beading on his forehead.</p>

    <p>He wore a disbelieving expression. His fifty-fold sword qi had actually been stopped by one finger and then easily dissolved.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't answer him, and just turned his head slightly to look out of the corner of his eye behind him. Both the old devil and the devil spirit couldn't help shuddering.</p>

    <p>This expression... if they remained here, they would definitely die!</p>

    <p>"Excuse me, my venerable self is going to leave first..."</p>

    <p>There was cold sweat on the old devil's head; as soon as he finished speaking, that purple gold fog rose up again and he disappeared into thin air with it.</p>

    <p>For the old devil, this had definitely been a painful decision to make.</p>

    <p>From the moment the world had dubbed him "Devil Emperor," he had very rarely disgraced himself by doing such a shameful thing.</p>

    <p>The old devil's escape was completely within Wang Ling's expectations; protected as the former was by the fog of the Purple Gold Gourd, there was no other way of tracing the old devil back to his small world until that ancient magic blade had been officially fixed.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling knew that this old devil's days were numbered.</p>

    <p>That look which Wang Ling had given him had been a warning.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Just like that, the old devil left...</p>

    <p>This Devil Emperor Gua Pi, who brought terror to the whole world, also had his weak point, and that weak point was Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Between preserving his life and saving face, the old devil had decisively thrown away all his face and dignity.</p>

    <p>He flicked his sleeves, and didn't take even a wisp of cloud away with him<sup>2</sup>...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(As a reminder, this is based on the last line of the poem "Taking Leave of Cambridge Again" by the renowned 20th century Chinese poet Xu Zhimo)</dfn>

    <p>It was a pity, however, that this young man from Immortal Mansion didn't realize how serious the problem was.</p>

    <p>"Whoever you are, if you dare stand in Immortal Mansion's way, there is no saving you!" this young man said coldly as he looked at Wang Ling. With just a flick of his fingers, he had formed a hand seal.</p>

    <p>With a "pa!" sound, it was as if that sword had been imbued with spirit, and in a flash it flew at Wang Ling's back at a shocking speed.</p>

    <p>This was a sword technique which could take an enemy general's head off from a thousand li away. As the young man executed this technique, his lips curved up slightly and he looked very confident.</p>

    <p>He was the most familiar with this sword technique among all the ones he had; it was all about dispatching the enemy with one killer move!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had just turned his head and the blood-red sword in the young man's hand was already flying toward him.</p>

    <p>This sword's speed was so great that even cultivators at the Soul Formation stage might not be able to catch it.</p>

    <p>Its sword qi was completely gold in color, like lightning!</p>

    <p>Looking at this scene, Lord Diulei suddenly seemed to recall something, and his eyes instantly widened. "This man said earlier that the sword was called Abyss Avoidance."</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu: "Has Senior Immortal recalled something?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "I remember that there's a legendary ancient magic sword also called Abyss Avoidance; it ranks top on the historical cultivation list of swords because of its speed. It has a nickname, Golden Flash, and its brother sword is codenamed Silver Lightning, and is ranked second on the list..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Song Qingshu couldn't help trembling a little. A young man from Immortal Mansion who actually wielded a legendary ancient magic sword... his imagination ran wild as he wondered how powerful the force behind Immortal Mansion was.</p>

    <p>But though he was a little scared, he didn't actually feel true dread.</p>

    <p>For some reason, every time Ling Zhenren showed up, it gave Song Qingshu a strong sense of security, especially when the former appeared in those big white bunny pajamas — Song Qingshu could feel a trace of warmth and kindness from them...</p>

    <p>"Go to hell." At the scene, the young man from Immortal Mansion sneered as he promptly launched Abyss Avoidance forward.</p>

    <p>At the same time, hiding behind the wall of the villa, Thunder and Song Qingshu couldn't help sighing; why were there so many people looking for death nowadays?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>As Wang Ling's gaze followed the sword shadow's trajectory as it hurtled toward him, he mused in his heart that if the person standing here now had been Lord Diulei, the result of this battle would already have been a foregone conclusion.</p>

    <p>Whoosh! While he was pondering, this sword had already closed in on him at a strange angle, and looked liked it was going to stab him in the back.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling just leaned to the side and evaded it. At the same time, he easily caught hold of this blood-red sword's hilt so that it was now in his hand.</p>

    <p>The young man from Immortal Mansion was wide-eyed.</p>

    <p>He was thunderstruck, and felt like his world view had been completely turned upside down... this, how was this possible?!</p>

    <p>This was the Golden Flash, the legendary ancient magic sword which was the fastest sword in all of cultivation history!</p>

    <p>The young man from Immortal Mansion was stunned. To actually be able to catch Abyss Avoidance's killing strike... how fucking fast was this person's hand speed? How many years had he remained single<sup>3</sup> in order to achieve it?</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(Don't know if people need a reminder about this, but again, this implies that single men only have their hands to keep them company)</dfn>

    <p>Gritting his teeth, the young man silently recited the sword spell to call Abyss Avoidance back.</p>

    <p>However, no matter how he chanted, that Abyss Avoidance gripped in that teenage boy's hand didn't budge an inch.</p>

    <p>He immediately understood — it wasn't that his magic had failed, but that this teenager had unimaginably freakish strength!</p>

    <p>Which holy being was this?</p>

    <p>Behind the half-ruined villa wall, Lord Diulei and Song Qingshu had already anticipated this scene, but they both still couldn't help sighing.</p>

    <p>"Senior Immortal, you mentioned that the Golden Flash was called Abyss Avoidance. Then, do you know the name of that second fastest sword, Silver Lightning?" Song Qingshu couldn't help asking curiously.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Oh, you mean that Silver Lightning?"</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu nodded. "Yes."</p>

    <p>"It's called Lake Avoidance<sup>4</sup>," Lord Diulei replied without a second thought.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>4</sup>(Lake Avoidance is the translation of "bichi". The joke here is that "bichi" is also the Chinese transliteration of the word "bitch")</dfn>

    <p>Song Qingshu: "..."</p>
