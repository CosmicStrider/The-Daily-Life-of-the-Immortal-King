  <h1>Chapter 763 I Can Only Do a Fireball</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After Xiao Yin's holy beast blood successfully passed the verification at the entrance, everyone was sucked into the interior of Beast King's tomb.</p>

    <p>The one thing for certain was that this was by no means a technique for expanding space in a crack or a small world. This crack in the Imperial tree was only one of the entrances to Beast King's tomb.</p>

    <p>As for the exact location of Beast King's tomb, this was still a mystery...</p>

    <p>While they shuttled through space, Wang Ming began to suspect that the precise location of Beast King's tomb might not even be in Devil Valley at all.</p>

    <p>Perhaps the whole of Devil Valley was a cover that Devil King had set up.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming and the others fell down a space passage and landed on the floor of the tomb like a string of beans.</p>

    <p>"It hurts!" Luo Chuang rose from the ground, rubbing his head.</p>

    <p>He had fallen headfirst earlier, and directly made a hole in the ground.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming felt a little cold when he saw this. It was a good thing he was wearing mecha armor, otherwise if he had fallen like that, his body would have likely been smashed to pieces... The "Wang Ling One" suit he was now wearing had powerful anti-gravity and shock absorption capabilities. Although he had also fallen down just now, he didn't feel much pain.</p>

    <p>It could only be said, as expected of himself?</p>

    <p>Even when his silly otouto wasn't around, he could still rely on his deft hands to make it look like his otouto was with him!</p>

    <p>Thinking this, Wang Ming suddenly flushed, and unexpectedly felt a little excited!</p>

    <p>"Lao Gudong Xiaoer, your mecha armor can also change color?" Luo Chuang watched in amazement as the mecha turned a fiery red.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Shit!</p>

    <p>Wang Ming forgot that he had added a new anthropomorphic design feature to Wang Ling One, where the armor would change color according to the wearer's mood.</p>

    <p>After Wang Ming did his best to regain his composure, the mecha armor's color returned to its original silver gray.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming suddenly felt that this design seemed a little redundant.</p>

    <p>It was too stupid to reveal his own emotions...</p>

    <p>What if people found out he was a pervert?</p>

    <p>Fix it!</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Ming made up his mind.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>They surveyed their surroundings. Roughly ten meters in front of them was the edge of a cliff, under which was a bottomless abyss.</p>

    <p>The mouth of the abyss was exceedingly wide and long as it stretched out to both sides with no end in sight.</p>

    <p>"A great world?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi crouched at the mouth of the abyss and looked down.</p>

    <p>He sensed the aura of a great world. A lot more was required to set up a great world compared with a small world. A small world could be stored in a magic treasure through technological means, but a great world couldn't.</p>

    <p>The space of a great world was equal to that of a thousand small worlds.</p>

    <p>Because the space was too vast, there was no way for an ordinary magic treasure to contain it, unless it was a first-rate spatial magic treasure.</p>

    <p>"Mm, it indeed is a great world. Even I am only capable of swallowing two great worlds," Wuji said.</p>

    <p>As the king of beasts, it wasn't surprising that Devil King could create a great world. But Wuji could swallow two great worlds... That was incredibly terrifying.</p>

    <p>It could only be said, as expected of a first-rate spatial magic treasure made from forty-nine holy beast skins...</p>

    <p>"Can you analyze this great world?" Zhuo Yi asked.</p>

    <p>"Of course." It was just a great world, and was still within Wuji's scope of perception.</p>

    <p>Wuji closed her eyes and meditated for a moment. A while later, black light that looked like ink blossomed in her palm like a lotus and rose into the air. The ink in the air flowed and blended together to finally create a grand sight of the great world.</p>

    <p>This scene which stunned everyone who saw it was also followed by Wuji's analysis of this "tomb map."</p>

    <p>"The transparent part of the map is the abyss of this great world." When Wuji spoke, her words were astonishing.</p>

    <p>Their mouths dropped open one by one.</p>

    <p>It turned out that the abyss in front of their eyes was actually an array...</p>

    <p>When Devil King created this great world, he split the earth and set up an array by means of an abyss.</p>

    <p>Up close, it didn't look like anything out of the ordinary, but Wuji's analysis now revealed a stunning planimetric map of an array constructed using the abyss.</p>

    <p>This was an absolutely exquisite array, so exquisite that everyone here, including Xiao Yin, had been fooled.</p>

    <p>If it wasn't for Wuji's analysis, they might have never noticed this gateway.</p>

    <p>"Devil King used this abyss to construct an array; for what purpose?" Zhuo Yi's eyes closed slightly as he stared into the abyss before him and pondered.</p>

    <p>His realm was a little low, so he couldn't sense the marvelous fluctuations of this abyss array. In contrast, Luo Chuang, Xiao Yin and Wuji next to him all looked like they had seen something utterly mind-blowing.</p>

    <p>"I see!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming suddenly jerked and opened his eyes wide. "Could this be, the legendary... Nationwide Transmutation Array <sup>1</sup> ?!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Adapted from "Fullmetal
Alchemist," and is an array
designed to consume the lives
of the citizens in a whole
country ..)</dfn>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang: "..."</p>

    <p>Wuji: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "Think about it! The holy beasts were suddenly wiped out, and as the king of beasts, Devil King would naturally be unwilling to accept such an ending. Therefore, he deliberately faked his death and set up this array inside his tomb for the day when all the holy beasts can be brought back to life at the expense of an entire country!"</p>

    <p>"Really?" Xiao Yin was dazed at Wang Ming's words.</p>

    <p>"Maybe, but we don't have proof! Currently, we still can't confirm if Devil King is still alive. But I don't think the king of beasts would die so easily." Wang Ming sighed very regretfully.</p>

    <p>At that moment, everyone suddenly heard the voice of an old man behind them.</p>

    <p>"All of you, breaking into the tomb... you're looking for death."</p>

    <p>This was the old man who had appeared outside the Imperial tree tomb entrance after everyone had entered the space tunnel.</p>

    <p>The old man wasn't tall and stood at less than one and a half meters. He wore a thick golden-brown robe covered with strange mushrooms, and his head was covered in the golden-red diamond-shaped leaves that were unique to the Imperial tree.</p>

    <p>He was a small man, but he gave off a very frightening aura. He spoke lightly, but exuded an air of great dignity.</p>

    <p>"A tree goblin of the Imperial tree?" Xiao Yin already recognized the old man.</p>

    <p>This was a tree goblin of the Imperial tree, but he didn't belong to the demon race. Demons used demon qi, but the tree goblin in front of them used genuine spirit energy, so he should be considered a special type of spirit beast.</p>

    <p>"You are?" Wang Ming asked, staring at the old man.</p>

    <p>"I'm the guardian of the tomb," the old man answered. "You've entered a forbidden area. Except for holy beasts, no one leaves this place alive."</p>

    <p>"Is there no room for discussion?" Zhuo Yi asked. "We didn't mean to offend anyone..."</p>

    <p>The old man narrowed his eyes and said firmly, "No!"</p>

    <p>"Very well... then we can only fight." With that, Zhuo Yi took out a ring, and a white flame emerged from it.</p>

    <p>Flame... Flame of Purification?</p>

    <p>How could a Golden Core cultivator wield such an amazing thing?</p>

    <p>The old man was instantly drenched in sweat and he withdrew his spiritual pressure.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi held the Flame of Purification aloft. "Come! Let's fight! I can't do anything except a fireball!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming, Luo Chuang, Xiao Yin and Wuji: "..."</p>

    <p>"... Young hero, take it easy. Put the flame away first... Hm... Actually, I'm not the guardian of the tomb, I'm a guide!" At that moment, the old man's eyes turned incomparably sincere.</p>
