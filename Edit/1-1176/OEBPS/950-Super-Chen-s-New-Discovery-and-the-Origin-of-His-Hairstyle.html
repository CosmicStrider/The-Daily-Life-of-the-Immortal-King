  <h1>Chapter 950 Chen Chao's New Discovery and the Origin of His Hairstyle</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Ever since Father Chen's mouth cannon attack on Tiger Liang at the hospital, four-year-old Chen Chao seemed to have understood something about the art of language.</p>

    <p>The next day, he didn't stare at the half-bald trunk of the old pagoda tree, but sat under the tree to read <em>A Comprehensive Collection of </em><em>Crosstalk </em>.</p>

    <p>Father Chen thought that Chen Chao was probably upset about what happened yesterday and had yet to calm down. From afar, reading a book under the pagoda tree made it look like he had retreated into himself.</p>

    <p>Father Chen didn't urge him to cultivate, and instead sat down next to Chen Chao and said attentively, "Son, cultivating body techniques shapes the body and nourishes the mind. I'm very proud of you for bravely stepping forward to save that poor mute girl yesterday."</p>

    <p>Honestly speaking, Chen Chao had made tremendous progress, and as his father, Chen Yi was indeed very happy from the bottom of his heart. Nowadays, even helping an old woman who had fallen down took courage <sup>1</sup> , to say nothing of confronting a kid five or six years older than you.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Refers to the "pengci" phenomenon in China.)</dfn>

    <p>Father Chen thought that Chen Chao had one hundred percent inherited his brave, hot-blooded and fearless personality, and then some.</p>

    <p>Four-year-old Chen Chao seemed braver than Father Chen had been at that age.</p>

    <p>Father Chen didn't rebuke Chen Chao at all for hitting Tiger Liang yesterday, and instead shouldered the responsibility; Father Chen and his son were very clear on who had been right and wrong. Yesterday, Father Chen had paid the medical fees so that Liang Heng couldn't find any fault with them. On the contrary, it was Liang Heng's disappointment of a son acting up in the hospital who made a fool of himself in front of so many onlookers.</p>

    <p>But something seemed to have gone wrong somewhere, as Chen Chao seemed a little withdrawn today.</p>

    <p>Picking his words, Father Chen wanted to ask, "Son, you did nothing wrong yesterday. So..."</p>

    <p>"I know." Holding <em>A Comprehensive Collection of </em><em>Crosstalk </em>, Chen Chao replied, "Dad, I'm pursuing the art of language."</p>

    <p>"The - the art of language?"</p>

    <p>"'A gentleman uses his mouth and not his fist.' Father, what you said to Tiger Liang yesterday left him speechless, which was so cool! So I think that apart from regular physical cultivation, I also need to practice smooth talk," Chen Chao replied excitedly.</p>

    <p>For one moment, Father Chen was unable to respond; it turned out the problem was what had happened at the end yesterday!</p>

    <p>He had only shot his mouth off at the time when he could no longer stand Tiger Liang's aggressive and vile attitude. Teaching this sort of kid a lesson was actually very easy â€” the questions he had asked yesterday had hit Tiger Liang's sore spots, as a second rich generation who never studied.</p>

    <p>Father Chen never expected to inadvertently trigger in his son a fascination with the art of language.</p>

    <p>He couldn't help laughing. "So, what art of language have you discovered in this <em>Comprehensive Collection of </em><em>Crosstalk </em>?"</p>

    <p>Four-year-old Chen Chao thought for a while before answering seriously, "Smoking!"</p>

    <p>Father Chen: "..."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "Drinking!"</p>

    <p>Father Chen: "..."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "And perming hair! <sup>2</sup> "</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(From a performance by
popular crosstalk duo Guo
Degang and Yu Qian, where
the former teased the latter of
having these three hobbies ..)</dfn>

    <p>Father Chen: "But you're a kid. Underaged children aren't allowed to drink or smoke, which is also in our family rules."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "But... isn't there still perming hair?"</p>

    <p>"Mm, you have a point, son." Father Chen smiled faintly.</p>

    <p>And so, when Chen Chao was four -</p>

    <p>To prevent his son from going overboard in his pursuit of the art of language, and instead have him focus on cultivating body techniques, Father Chen duped him into going to the hairdresser's and told the barber, "Just trim my son's hair a bit."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao was four that year.</p>

    <p>It was the year he got a crew cut.</p>

    <p>And he had maintained that hairstyle to this day.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After the conflict with the Liang family, the Chen family's Strength Super Martial Dojo suddenly experienced a boom in business. In one month, the dojo accepted close to twenty disciples, many of whom were preschoolers just slightly older than Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>There were two reasons for this change.</p>

    <p>First, the Liang family's Balance Magic Center had always been a well-known school in this area, but the son of the head of the center, ten-year-old Tiger Liang, had lost to four-year-old Chen Chao. This news spread from the hospital that day.</p>

    <p>So since that day, people had marveled at the strength of the "Iron Sand Palm."</p>

    <p>No one had expected a four-year-old to be able to use this move to beat up Tiger Liang badly enough to be wrapped up like a mummy after that.</p>

    <p>Of course, the incident had naturally become increasingly exaggerated. After all, none of them had personally witnessed it. The very first person who spread the news had only relied on hearsay and Tiger Liang's wretched-looking appearance.</p>

    <p>Second, the fight between Chen Chao and Tiger Liang had directly helped boost Strength Super Martial Dojo's name. This family body techniques dojo run by Father Chen had always had a good reputation, but with the rising trend in magic, the dojo's disciples slowly decreased in number. However, with this fight, the dojo was thrust into the limelight.</p>

    <p>Plus, human beings were animals who always liked to follow the trend.</p>

    <p>When parents felt that other people's kids were more outstanding, their first reaction wasn't that there was something wrong with their own kid's learning ability, but more that they weren't giving them the right supplementary lessons!</p>

    <p>After the end of the incident starring Chen Chao and Tiger Liang, some parents immediately signed up at Father Chen's body techniques dojo, and the number of applicants continued to increase... There were a number who got refunds from Balance Center before coming over to sign up.</p>

    <p>Father Chen could practically imagine Liang Heng's furious look.</p>

    <p>All in all, there were both pros and cons for Father Chen as a result of this incident.</p>

    <p>On the plus side, their family business had improved and he would no longer need to kneel on a washboard as punishment very night for their poor business...</p>

    <p>But the downside was also very obvious.</p>

    <p>His fellow brother Liang Heng had always like to compete with him since the beginning.</p>

    <p>Back then, a female college teacher had kissed Father Chen in a game of Truth or Dare. His fellow brother had mistaken her for his girlfriend, and in the following month, had captured this teacher's heart and put on a show of French kissing her in front of Father Chen on Valentine's Day.</p>

    <p>Now, Father Chen had unintentionally stolen Balance Center's business; god knew what mean trick this unlucky brother of his would use against him.</p>

    <p>Father Chen didn't care if it had to do with himself.</p>

    <p>He looked at Chen Chao in the courtyard, and somehow felt uneasy.</p>

    <p>While he was thinking, two familiar figures showed up at the entrance to their courtyard.</p>

    <p>Wang Xiaoling and her mother were at the entrance of the Chen family's dojo. Mother and daughter huddled together under the "Strength Super Dojo" sign, gratitude and some timidity in their eyes.</p>

    <p>"I'm looking for the dojo leader..." Wang Xiaoling's mother said, her voice shaking slightly.</p>
