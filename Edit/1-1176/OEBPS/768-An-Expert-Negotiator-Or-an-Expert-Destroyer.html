  <h1>Chapter 768 An Expert Negotiator Or an Expert Destroyer?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor's heart was as clear as a mirror. He knew very well that this wasn't some Creation Art, but another art similar to it in form... But when Night Ghost Spirit Emperor learned from President Bai's mouth that this was the Reverse Polarity technique, he had instantly realized the peril of his situation.</p>

    <p>Because Reverse Polarity didn't conform to Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>This was an extremely rare Outer Dao technique, with the power to turn a situation around and change one's fate!</p>

    <p>President Bai sneered. "Lord Spirit Emperor is truly naïve. Do you really think that there is a technique in this world for quick healing that doesn't ask a price of you? The so-called Creation Art is just a cover. To deceive everyone, when the Bai clan ancestors obtained this Reverse Polarity technique, they called it Creation Art and made it look like an advanced medical spell."</p>

    <p>"You set me up from the very beginning..." Night Ghost Spirit Emperor never expected Bai Zhe's scheme to be this big.</p>

    <p>"Endure." President Bai flicked his fingers. "This was the last thing my father said to me when my Bai clan was exterminated back then. Although he had never thought much of me, this bastard son, blood is still thicker than water. With your help, it is indeed true that I climbed to the top of the Bai clan. But to prevent the Creation Art from being leaked, you killed my entire clan..."</p>

    <p>"You accepted this yourself at the time." Night Ghost Spirit Emperor ground his teeth.</p>

    <p>"I merely accepted it - did I ever offer an opinion?" President Bai said.</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor was silent for a very long time.</p>

    <p>"Young man... It's not good to be too vindictive."</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor could more or less guess what President Bai planned to do next.</p>

    <p>President Bai was now already blinded by hatred.</p>

    <p>Now that he had obtained a new body through the power of Outer Dao and had returned from the grave, there was no way he would give up on his revenge.</p>

    <p>Night Ghost Spirit Emperor speculated that it was likely that President Bai would once again take revenge on that mysterious expert who looked like a teenager...</p>

    <p>"Even if you have my body, you're no match for him." Night Ghost Spirit Emperor sighed; this could be considered kindly advice.</p>

    <p>"He has over a thousand Heavenly Dao, I am naturally not his match for now." President Bai smiled. "But Reverse Polarity... isn't the only power of Outer Dao..."</p>

    <p>President Bai had already formulated his revenge plan: he would collect even more Outer Dao and use their power to stand up to the Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>But President Bai had no idea what kind of opponent he was up against.</p>

    <p>True, Wang Ling had all along been demonstrating the power of Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>But that didn't mean that he didn't know Outer Dao...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In Beast King's tomb, Wang Ming and the others were methodically putting the rescue plan into action.</p>

    <p>"Connect the cable." Wang Ming gave a very simple instruction, and a very long conduit instantly came out of Wang Ling One's back to connect to Beast King's body.</p>

    <p>This conduit was a kind of neural connector which was originally used to extract memories, but which also had the special function of spying on dreams. Wang Ming was now using it to access the mind, before Qin Lang finally stepped in and used magic to link everyone's minds together.</p>

    <p>Although Xiao Yin didn't understand what was going on, he still felt it was very amazing.</p>

    <p>"The connection is about to open. Everyone, relax."</p>

    <p>Qin Lang's tree roots had already wrapped around everyone's ankles to anchor them in place.</p>

    <p>In almost a split second, the scene before them started to change.</p>

    <p>It immediately switched to the interior of an apartment.</p>

    <p>This was a story which revolved around three bionic robots, one of whom was an android called Connor.</p>

    <p>The entire game was a mix of three main storylines. Only when the three lead characters of the three storylines survived to the very end could this be considered a relatively satisfactory ending. But the perfect ending that Beast King wanted was one in which not only did the three of them survive, the humans in this game world would also acknowledge the existence of bionic robots as new intelligent lifeforms.</p>

    <p>"I looked up the data before; the chance of getting this perfect ending is two percent," Xiao Yin said, pursing his lips.</p>

    <p>This was a very low probability.</p>

    <p>While Xiao Yin knew of this game, when all was said and done, he had never played it himself. He had only read a rough summary of the game's plot. Now, he had to play it from scratch. Whether or not they were in the two percent and could achieve a perfect ending was up in the air for everyone.</p>

    <p>But after they entered the game, they strangely didn't receive any system prompts. Following Wang Ming, everyone went up to the roof.</p>

    <p>In this storyline, a housekeeper bionic robot named Daniel had kidnapped a little girl.</p>

    <p>The little girl's name was Medusa, and it was her romance with a younger boy she had met online called Yandi that caused Daniel's heart to change.</p>

    <p>That day, when Daniel saw Medusa chatting happily with Yandi as she ignored him, he unexpectedly became enraged. Picking up a spirit sword, he kidnapped Medusa and brought her to the roof.</p>

    <p>The company Membrane Control Life which created the robots sent the police robot Connor to negotiate with him. Wang Ming and the others had to rescue the little girl hostage from this abnormal android by way of negotiation.</p>

    <p>"Let me explain the situation."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said, "Right now, we are not viewing this from the perspective of the protagonist, who is still being operated by Beast King. But because we don't know what kind of choices Beast King will make, we must make ample preparations, and help him clear the game. I can switch all of us with random NPCs in the game."</p>

    <p>"So that's how it works!" The others nodded.</p>

    <p>At that very moment, it just so happened that the plot had developed to a point where Beast King had to make a choice.</p>

    <p>The abnormal android Daniel snarled at the character Connor operated by Beast King, "Back off, back off! Or I'll kill this girl!"</p>

    <p>At that moment, options for dealing with Daniel popped up on Beast King's interface.</p>

    <p>"Calm Daniel down △"</p>

    <p>"Insult Daniel □"</p>

    <p>"Placate Daniel ○"</p>

    <p>"Sympathize with Daniel ×"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>To everyone's surprise, Beast King directly chose "□"...</p>

    <p>And so, Beast King's character Connor conformed to this choice and roundly cursed Daniel. "Why're you looking at me?! If you keep staring, you think I won't kill you?"</p>

    <p>Daniel suddenly became emotional and was on the verge of breaking down. "I thought... Medusa and I could be happy together! But she only has Yandi in her heart!"</p>

    <p>Options appeared again.</p>

    <p>"Calm Daniel down △"</p>

    <p>"Tell Daniel to face reality □"</p>

    <p>"Care for Daniel ○"</p>

    <p>"Spit at Daniel ×"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Sure enough, Beast King predictably chose the most unreliable "×."</p>

    <p>Connor: "Bah! You're just a housekeeper android, but you actually want to be happy with a girl? Don't you know that your thing down there was turned off before you left the factory?"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>As Xiao Yin had initially predicted, Beast King hadn't planned to win the game from the very beginning. He was just choosing the complete opposite of the commonsense options, deliberately preventing himself from clearing the game as he escaped reality...</p>

    <p>Wang Ming sighed. "Does anyone have any good suggestions?"</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang volunteered. "Turn me into a girl! It's been a while since I crossdressed!"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi and Xiao Yin remembered that when Luo Chuang and Dharmaraja had broken into Immortal Mansion the last time, they had worn women's clothes...</p>

    <p>Sure enough, you either crossdressed just once, or many times <sup>1</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Adapted from an online
phrase "You either crossdress
many times or not at all,"
which implies that there's no
in-between when it comes to
an obsession ..)</dfn>
