  <h1>Chapter 990 Symbol Of Peace</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Congratulations, you are a member of the Human Path now." The registrar in the dream house smiled at Wang Ling, then took out a red seal and stamped the back of Wang Ling's hand.</p>

    <p>This was the mark of the dream house. Everyone who entered this world got this emblem upon registration as proof of their identities. Of course, Wang Ling and the others were intruders, so there actually weren't any records on them in the registrar's computer. At the moment, however, this dream house registrar was under Wang Ling's control; something like this was a piece of cake for him.</p>

    <p>Right now, they didn't know where Fang Xing was, so they could only use infiltration to take part in and destroy this organization's hidden conspiracy.</p>

    <p>Er Ha also smoothly cleared the audit, but Wang Ling didn't let the wheel stop on the Human Path. The dream house registrar looked at Er Ha amiably. "Congratulations, Mr Dog, you're still a beast in this life!"</p>

    <p>"..." Er Ha didn't think the registrar's words were wrong, but they still sounded strange for some reason! â€” How could this person curse other people?!</p>

    <p>The registration process went smoothly for Wang Ling and the others. As they were about to leave, they were stopped by the two shadow goons next to the registrar. "You guys wait!"</p>

    <p>One of the shadow goons had a vigilant expression on his face. He stared at Wang Ling and the others and felt that something was a little strange. "How can dead people come to this world in groups? How did all of you die?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "We died in the Infinity War... Someone snapped his fingers, and we died."</p>

    <p>The shadow man frowned. "Infinity War?"</p>

    <p>He was a mercenary who had died hundreds of years ago; in the end, he was a person from ancient times and didn't understand what Wang Ming was referring to. He just thought the name of this war sounded very impressive.</p>

    <p>Was this a battle campaign that had happened after he died?</p>

    <p>The shadow man didn't understand.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Guo Ping whispered an additional line in the befuddled shadow man's ear.</p>

    <p>Guo Ping: "Hail Hydra."</p>

    <p>The shadow man froze on the spot.</p>

    <p>He didn't know what a "hydra" was, but it was as if these words had an odd devilish power for some reason, which actually made him a little absent-minded when he heard them.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and the others got into a spirit car. As Dream Matron said, transport and any sort of expenditure in this world didn't require any money; anyone could get by, by relying on the mark on their hand.</p>

    <p>The dead might feel that this could indeed be called a perfect world, but the most frightening thing was that most of their memories had been tampered with. Although they knew how they had died, they didn't know why. They might have become residents of this world after coming here, but they lived more like puppets whose strings were being controlled.</p>

    <p>They might start over: find work, marry, and have kids again...</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling realized that the people in this world were living aimless lives.</p>

    <p>Sitting in the spirit car, Wang Ling observed everyone he could see. None of them had smiles on their faces.</p>

    <p>"Is this really okay?" After leaving the dream house some distance behind them, Er Ha stared in the direction of the shadow goon and asked the question telepathically.</p>

    <p>"It's fine," Wang Ming replied telepathically. "These people have simple mentalities; they're just goons, and easy to fool. However, we still have to be a little careful when we run into them."</p>

    <p>"Wait, you can use telepathy?" Er Ha was shocked.</p>

    <p>"You underestimate my mecha suits." Wang Ming smiled.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Ling Two had already activated the brain wave transmission function. By relying on brain waves, a telepathic LAN was established which allowed them to communicate directly without being detected.</p>

    <p>"Where are we going now?"</p>

    <p>"This world has already fallen under the control of the mysterious organization. Naturally, we need to figure out where the organization's nest is. I put a tracker on the researcher who was taken away earlier, and we should be able to find leads on the researchers if we track him," Wang Ming said confidently.</p>

    <p>The place they were headed to now was a munitions factory in the northern outskirts of Songhai.</p>

    <p>It used to be the headquarters of Weapons Saint Minister Ke, one of the Ten Generals.</p>

    <p>After numerous researchers were killed in the real world, they were brought here after coming to this world. The other side was probably cooking up some big hidden plot.</p>

    <p>"Is this the place?"</p>

    <p>After the spirit car stopped as close to the northern outskirts as possible, Wang Ling and the others decided to proceed on foot to avoid inadvertently alerting the enemy.</p>

    <p>This was because on the way over, they realized that apart from the black shadow men, no one was flying around on spirit swords in the sky and everyone used land transport. This was in direct contrast to the real world. In an age of national cultivation, crossing the road on spirit swords was a common thing; as long as you didn't drink and drive, there was nothing to be punished for.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling then opened the King's Eye and used an eye technique to cover the scene so that it was frozen on an image of it an hour ago. The munitions factory was heavily guarded in a desolate area; anyone could tell with one look that it was hiding a massive secret inside.</p>

    <p>There were now many methods for detecting invisibility, but fortunately they had the power of the King's Eye, so it wouldn't be that easy for them to be discovered.</p>

    <p>As they approached the munitions factory, Wang Ling heard a conversation between several of the shadow guards at the door.</p>

    <p>"Bros, what on earth is being created inside?"</p>

    <p>"It seems to be a magic staff," someone who knew replied. "When I escorted a man in a white coat in just now, I had a look. The appearance of this magic staff is a little bizarre: it's of a pretty boy wearing suspenders and holding a basketball. There were light waves coming directly out of the basketball, and they were pretty powerful."</p>

    <p>"A pretty boy with a basketball... could it be..."</p>

    <p>"You don't understand. In our Palace of Mirrors, this bro is now a symbol of peace!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and the others: "..."</p>

    <p>The world was a little scary!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, in the real world, Huaxiu Alliance's Ten Generals had convened for an emergency meeting in the conference room.</p>

    <p>In one short moment, an unknown shadow organization had killed so many researchers; higher-ups all over the world were utterly shaken.</p>

    <p>The head of state showed up as a projection, his expression unsightly. "Who can tell me what's going on?"</p>

    <p>"This group of people is organized and planned well; they were definitely prepared for this. Looking at the current results, there is definitely a spy in our research institute," President Qi said.</p>

    <p>"A spy?"</p>

    <p>"I'm afraid so, Your Excellency Head of State." President Qi said, "The fortifications of research institutes around the world are of the highest level, but the other side was able to break through so easily. This has to be due to spies secretly reporting to them behind the scenes. All of this is likely related to the destruction of Mixiu's border defense base a few days ago."</p>
