  <h1>Chapter 366 The Tree Brothers </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling followed Teacher Ye to the sports teaching and research room on the third floor of the teaching block. This classroom had been set up especially for the PE teachers to use; if the weather that day wasn't suitable for outdoor activities, the students would still have a place to go.</p>

    <p>The PE teachers could also use this classroom to give students detailed explanations on PE assessments as well as instruct them on the use of all kinds of magic treasures, give them small tips for flying spirit swords, and so on, since the magic treasures and flying sword courses had currently been lumped under physical education.</p>

    <p>But most unfortunately, every time it rained, the PE class would be snatched away by almost every other subject teacher, so this room existed in name only. The only time the other teachers wouldn't pillage this period was at the start and end of the semester, when the students had their phys ed exams; every other time, this room wasn't used at all.</p>

    <p>For the majority of people, senior high school was an important time for grasping cultivation theory in the cultivation education system, and students should only delve into magic treasures and flying swords in university. Thus, they didn't attach much importance to PE class - when it came down to it, it was a problem with the organization and education system.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling stepped into the room, he saw two lonely people sitting inside; one was Fang Xing and the other was Jiang Bai, the son of the head of Kitchen Knife Sect Jiang Haifu whom Father Wang had come to know the other day.</p>

    <p>Although Jiang Bai had been put in the normal class after the placement test at the beginning of the semester, he wasn't a good-for-nothing; Teacher Ye had discovered that he was a gifted sportsman.</p>

    <p>So this time, Jiang Bai would be representing Number 60 High School at the sports meet in the spirit archery event.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had never expected that Jiang Bai, who looked frail enough that a gust of wind might knock him over, would actually have such an amazing gift.</p>

    <p>However, the assessment criteria in a spirit archery competition wasn't quite the same as for running while controlling a sword, or manipulating a spirit sword: it wasn't strength or endurance, but accuracy that was the most important. Apart from that, the ability to track something with your eyes and to predict movement was also necessary. These were things that were almost impossible to gain in the short term without talent and years of training.</p>

    <p>The reason why Jiang Bai was so accomplished in this aspect was because his dad Jiang Haifu had taught him to fly kitchen knives since he was young, even frequently using people as target practice; Jiang Bai was a timid person and didn't dare disobey his dad, and so had been forced to do all this.</p>

    <p>Seeing Wang Ling approach them, Fang Xing instantly smiled and greeted him. "Oh! Classmate Wang Ling! Good morning!"</p>

    <p>Without a single expression on his face, Wang Ling found a seat in the back row.</p>

    <p>In the end, as soon as he sat down, Fang Xing stood up and then dragged Jiang Bai, who was next to him, to sit on either side of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "???"</p>

    <p>Teacher Ye didn't understand what was happening. "..." What was going on?</p>

    <p>Fang Xing grinned. "The classroom is so big and there's so few of us, so it's very cold. We're huddling together for warmth."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling silently rolled his eyes. "..." Songhai city's weather might be as unpredictable as a woman's period, but in any case it was going to be summer soon. <em>Who are you kidding about the cold? Also, how can it be so easy for you to feel cold at your realm?</em></p>

    <p>But this wasn't the main problem. The main issue was... why had Jiang Bai also come over to sit here?</p>

    <p>Sensing Wang Ling's suspicious side-eye, Jiang Bai scratched his head and said weakly, "He-</p>

    <p>hello, Classmate Wang Ling, I'm called Jiang Bai. My dad said I should make friends with you."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling now understood: this Jiang Bai was a daddy's boy who would always listen to his father...</p>

    <p>At that moment, Teacher Ye spoke from the dais. "There should actually be sixteen students in this meeting, but because of the Shuigou Sect incident, it's just the three of you... but it's fine since everyone present is a primary member of our Number 60 High School sports team. We'll have a simple meeting for now, and Student Fang Xing will later convey the gist of it to the students who aren't here."</p>

    <p>After saying this, Teacher Ye paused before he continued, "This time, our opponents will be outstanding students from other senior high schools in Peiyuan district. Apart from our old rival Number 59 High School, we'll also be competing against Reliance High School. This district sports meet is a large-scale sports competition among the three schools, and is primarily geared toward Senior Grade One freshmen.</p>

    <p>"We'll be taking part in several events: the ten thousand-meter relay marathon with a sword, the ten thousand-meter sprint with a sword, spirit archery, the medicine ball shot put, the ten-person tug-of-war, and the grand finale, the battle of soul pets."</p>

    <p>Teacher Ye looked helplessly at the blue notebook in his hand. "I actually wanted to gather everyone for training, but we don't have much time left. Student Fang Xing has signed up for all the events and Student Jiang Bai will be taking part in every round of the spirit archery event."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Wang Ling somehow suddenly had a bad feeling.</p>

    <p>"Currently, Student Wang Ling is only signed up for the ten thousand-meter relay marathon with a sword..." Teacher Ye smiled pitifully. "How about signing up for a couple more?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>He could see that the Shuigou Sect incident had left too big an impact, and Teacher Ye was truly helpless in its wake.</p>

    <p>From what many outsiders could see, Number 60 High School winning the district sports meet would be as difficult as trying to ascend to the heavens.</p>

    <p>While the students would recover in three to five days from their spirits being sealed, they would still continue to feel weak for a while.</p>

    <p>A person at the peak late Foundation Establishment stage had a maximum strength of roughly two thousand <em>jin </em>, but in a weakened condition following the seal on their spirit, that number would be reduced by half at the very least.</p>

    <p>Of course, it was just an example. After all, many freshmen would have yet to reach the late Foundation Establishment stage.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling cupped his chin and thought for a bit. Apart from his awesome self and Fang Xing this jinx, only Chen Chao and Sun Rong came closest among all the freshmen in terms of strength. Currently, however, Chen Chao had yet to recover, and Sun Rong had signed up for the girls' events, which Teacher Ye wasn't in charge of.</p>

    <p>This was very awkward.</p>

    <p>Trying to pull Wang Ling in, Teacher Ye looked at him very seriously and said, "Student Wang Ling, it would be good if you can select another event: the medicine ball shot put or the ten-person tug-of-war, one of the two. If we don't have enough participants, that's the same as giving up.</p>

    <p>"Furthermore, our opponents this time are very tough, especially the three extremely strong students who just entered Reliance High School. This opportunity to compare skills is hard to come by, and even if you lose, you may learn a lot."</p>

    <p>Jiang Bai was curious. "Teacher Ye, do you have any information on these three students?"</p>

    <p>Teacher Ye: "I'm still collecting detailed information on them, but I do know their names at least. They're the three famous brothers of the Tree family: Iron Tree, Copper Tree and Aluminum Tree."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Reasonably speaking, Wang Ling felt that it wouldn't be too good if he refused in the face of Teacher Ye's sincere attitude.</p>

    <p>After all, Teacher Ye was the teacher most bullied by the other teachers in the school... Wang Ling didn't feel he could be that ruthless.</p>

    <p>In the end, he signed up for two more events.</p>

    <p>One was the medicine ball shot put and the other the battle of soul pets.</p>

    <p>All the spirit animals taking part in the battle were domestic animals and only those that were suitable for battle would be pre-selected for the competition. Currently, Number 60 High School had an extremely suitable candidate.</p>

    <p>Back then, it was Fang Xing who had pulled Wang Ling into this business.</p>

    <p>Now, Wang Ling was planning to do the same to Er Ha.</p>
