  <h1>Chapter 103 Lord Diulei Is Shocked Once Again </h1>

  <div>

    <p>After Lord Diulei arrived at the Wang family home, he obediently sat on the sofa in the living room at Father Wang's invitation and didn't dare move after that.</p>

    <p>At this moment, he was feeling a little nervous in his heart... if Father and Mother Wang were seniors who were living fossils tens of thousands of years old, then Grandfather Wang, who had suddenly appeared... had to be a hidden BOSS great senior at the level of a creator god!</p>

    <p>"Dad, let me introduce you to someone. This is Little Lei, Ling Ling's friend." Father Wang pulled the old man over and introduced the man in white sitting ramrod straight on the sofa.</p>

    <p>"Oh, so it's Ling Ling's friend!" The old man nodded.</p>

    <p>Although the old man suffered dementia, his level of intelligence was still relatively normal whenever he was lucid. He had served as a chef for many years and had also cooked for many powerful cultivators, and so had seen many different types of people. Judging from the man's attire, the old man could basically guess that this person was from the cultivation field, and furthermore, possessed genuine strength.</p>

    <p>Considering that the other party was a cultivator, the old man felt that he had to be cautious when speaking, and was thinking about how to phrase his words when the man in white in front of him shot up to stand and shake his hand with unusual fervor. "Hello, senior, this humble one is Lei Mouren, 'lei' as in <em>tianlei </em>, 'mou' as in <em>mouhua </em>, 'ren' as in <em>yigeren </em><sup>1</sup> . My Taoist name is Lord Diulei. I'm very happy to meet you, senior!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(天雷 tianlei is 'a thunderous sky,' 谋划 mouhua is 'to plot,' and 一个人 yigeren is 'one person.')</dfn>

    <p><em>Erm... why is he calling me senior?</em></p>

    <p>When the old man heard the man call him "senior," he was bewildered at first, but was quick to respond.</p>

    <p>Maybe this was the normal etiquette in the cultivation field...</p>

    <p>The old man didn't bother to think so much; he hurriedly waved his hand for the man to sit down, and opened with small talk. "Where do you work, Little Lei?"</p>

    <p>It was just an ordinary question, but it caused Student Lei Mouren to become lost in deep thought.</p>

    <p>If he said out right that he was an owner of some online discussion forum, that would be a little demeaning! Furthermore, it would be a very bad start in building a relationship with this great senior!</p>

    <p>Because in the eyes of most people, an owner of a gossip forum was like the water armies on the Internet, and wasn't decent work.</p>

    <p>Hence, after thinking for a moment, Student Lei Mouren answered, "I'm the owner of a website which often receives requests from the public, and I help them with some cultivation tasks. Senior can consider it... a public service."</p>

    <p>"That's very good."</p>

    <p>The old man nodded repeatedly as he praised the other man. "There really aren't many children nowadays who think of the people. Doing good is indeed not easy, but as long as you follow your principle, you will definitely succeed..."</p>

    <p>"Senior, please advise me..."</p>

    <p>"This saying is 'from the masses, to the masses'... have you heard of it?"</p>

    <p>"..." Lei Mouren felt that there was something off with this saying for some reason, but still heaved a secret sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>It looked like he had already passed the first hurdle!</p>

    <p>Er Ha lolled lazily on the floor next to them and already couldn't even be bothered to mock this current scene... <em>what the heck is with this three-man joint hearing and matchmaking session?! Your damn reason for coming is to look for Wang Ling, right?!</em></p>

    <p>After making small talk about work, the three men in the living room chatted happily about life. Mother Wang put on her apron, looked at the three people and smiled. "Ling Ling just sent me a message to say that Teacher Pan is keeping him back to go over his test paper. He'll probably be home a little late."</p>

    <p>"That's fine, there's a lot to cook for tonight. By the time Ling Ling gets home, we'll be about ready to have dinner."</p>

    <p>The old man also stood up and strode toward the kitchen.</p>

    <p>"It wasn't easy for Little Lei to come here today, and he even brought fairy wine. Dad, you have to demonstrate your skills this time," said Father Wang.</p>

    <p>"Of course." The old man waved his hand, took the white gown off the clothes stand and put it on. The word "SPECIAL" glittered on the right sleeve of the gown, giving the old man the air of a master.</p>

    <p>Lei Mouren was stunned, but only after the old man had gone into the kitchen did he ask Father Wang in a low voice, "Senior Wang, do you mind if I ask, Great Senior Wang... what did he use to do?"</p>

    <p>"Chef."</p>

    <p>Father Wang's answer was light.</p>

    <p>"Chef?!" This answer immediately shocked Lei Mouren.</p>

    <p>A great senior who was an even older living fossil than this living fossil and had been a chef before... combining all these traits together, Lord Diulei almost instantly thought of one person... the legendary Magic Chef of Fire and Ice <sup>2</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is an online Chinese xuanhuan novel..)</dfn>

    <p><em>Oh my god! What a powerful legendary grandmaster!</em></p>

    <p>Looking at the busy figure of the old man in the kitchen, Lord Diulei was shocked once again...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>An hour later, dinner was ready. The table in the Wang family home was covered with all kinds of home-cooked dishes, a dazzling line-up that gave off warm aromas to please the senses.</p>

    <p>Mother Wang removed her apron, gave the pendulum clock a look and frowned. "It looks like it will be some time still before Ling Ling gets home. How about Little Lei you start first?"</p>

    <p>When Lord Diulei looked at the table of dishes and thought about how they had been personally cooked by someone who was probably the legendary grandmaster Magic Chef of Fire and Ice, he completely didn't dare eat them... he also tried his best to think about the story behind each dish.</p>

    <p>For example, what profound thought had gone into the red braised pork... what was the meaning behind the stir-fried spinach... and what on earth could he say about the pangolin?</p>

    <p>For a moment, Lord Diulei felt that the things he should be thinking about had increased...</p>

    <p>There weren't too many rules for eating in the Wang family home, and they were usually relatively casual.</p>

    <p>"Make yourself at home, Little Lei. Just like in your own home, eat a little more." The old man saw that Student Lei Mouren seemed reluctant to start, so promptly put a broccoli into the other man's bowl.</p>

    <p>Lei Mouren was flattered, and shot to his feet. "Thank you, great senior!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Next to them, Father and Mother Wang were startled. They felt that since the last time they had seen Little Lei, which was quite a while ago, he seemed to bluster a lot more now and would suddenly become flustered for no reason. Who knew what it was that had triggered this behavior?</p>

    <p>The couple stared at Student Lei Mouren as he sat down. He then held the bowl in both hands and gazed thoughtfully at this jade-like broccoli as if he was looking at an exquisite antique.</p>

    <p><em>A... broccoli?</em></p>

    <p><em>Why did great senior give me a broccoli? What in the world is the profound meaning behind it?</em></p>

    <p>Student Lei Mouren cupped his chin as he pondered.</p>

    <p>"Little Lei, why aren't you eating? Is it not to your taste?" Seeing this, Old Man Wang promptly ladled a bowl of soup for him. "Sour things can stimulate your appetite, come, taste my tomato egg drop soup."</p>

    <p><em>A bowl of... tomato egg drop soup?</em></p>

    <p><em>Why did great senior serve me a bowl of tomato egg drop soup? What in the world is the profound meaning behind it?</em></p>

    <p>At this moment, Student Lei Mouren was very troubled and remained puzzled no matter how much he thought about it.</p>

    <p>He couldn't help but sigh.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei thought that he had accomplished much in his wanderings all over the cultivator world all these years as he had cracked countless cultivation mysteries. At this very moment, however, he was deeply aware that his powers of understanding, which had been obtained through hard work and cultivation, amounted to nothing... he couldn't even decipher this little hint which this great senior had given him; it seemed that he hadn't cultivated enough at all!</p>

    <p>Looking at the broccoli and tomato egg drop soup, Lord Diulei couldn't help sighing...</p>

    <p>Er Ha: <em>You idiot! Can't you have dinner quietly?!</em></p>
