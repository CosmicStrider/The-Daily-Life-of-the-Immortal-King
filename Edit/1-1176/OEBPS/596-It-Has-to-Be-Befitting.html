  <h1>Chapter 596 It Has to Be Befitting</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Yes, Senior Dog."</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan was as obedient as ever and nodded straightaway.</p>

    <p>Actually, he was well aware in his heart that this was just a scare tactic; there was no way he would take action for real. However, seeing the faces of the thousands of demon beasts below him turn deathly white, Zheyuan actually felt it was a little fun, and the corners of his mouth couldn't help tilting upward â€” teasing these little demon beasts was turning out to be so interesting!</p>

    <p>There was something wrong with that smile, which made Er Ha wonder whether he had inadvertently aroused some weird, hidden tick in Immortal Zhenyuan...</p>

    <p>Years later, Er Ha would endlessly regret summoning Zhenyuan here to help it today.</p>

    <p>If it had known earlier, it would have been more frank in getting Little Master Ling to help it.</p>

    <p>Of course, all of this was a story for later.</p>

    <p>"Senior Dog, would you like to sit down? Beheading thousands of demons will be a magnificent sight!" Immortal Zhenyuan said something that sounded very frightening in an excited tone as he stared at the thousands of pale faces below him.</p>

    <p>"Very well," Er Ha replied.</p>

    <p>"Mm, let me prepare a chair for you, senior." Immortal Zhenyuan nodded his head. Afterwards, Er Ha didn't see him make any big moves; Zhenyuan just drew a magic array in the air with his index finger and finally pushed it toward the sky.</p>

    <p>"Hu!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha saw Zhenyuan blow softly at the array, and instantly it released a golden mist.</p>

    <p>Er Ha reckoned Zhenyuan was most likely performing some fancy operation again. It realized Immortal Zhenyuan was a little OCD about the spells he cast; they all had to be extremely gorgeous... Moreover, these weren't spells from Huaxiu nation; judging from the layout of the golden array, most of the symbols inside were from the west.</p>

    <p>"Since it's a chair for senior, it has to befit you." Zhenyuan turned to look at Er Ha and smiled. Quickly, he formed a seal with one hand, and the whole world immediately shook with massive tremors. The thousands of demons directly felt the pressure of the rumbling earth and couldn't help the way their heads shook, rattling their brains.</p>

    <p>Er Ha saw that some of the demon beasts in the back row had already been shaken to the point of frothing at the mouth.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>The golden array in the sky then spun like a disc on its side as it grew countless times larger. A passageway opened in the center of the array, out of which emerged many western soldiers in armor.</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan: "This is the grade nine spell I learned from Mixiu nation, 'Heroic Spirit Summoning Spell<sup>1</sup>.' When I saw the junior below use the Ghost Summoning Array, I remembered this spell. And after I modified it, it's almost at grade ten. It also incorporates a lot of eastern ideas! Senior, look!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(From the "Fate" visual novel/anime series..)</dfn>

    <p>While speaking, Immortal Zhenyuan pointed to the entrance of the summoning array; sure enough, apart from the western soldiers, a lot of Huaxiu ancient soldiers in gray armor poured out.</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan: "I integrated these Huaxiu ancient soldiers into the spell after I modified it. The downside of this spell is that I had to look for a corresponding offering so that my heroic spirit summons would incorporate our eastern culture. A hundred years ago, I bought lots of terracotta warriors in bulk."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>All the demons: "..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan smiled. "Now the total number of western soldiers and eastern ancient soldiers I can summon is exactly a hundred thousand."</p>

    <p>A hundred thousand...</p>

    <p>Er Ha was stunned.</p>

    <p>"Come out, all of you." Zhenyuan controlled the heroic spirits that poured out of the Heroic Spirit Summoning Array in an unending stream. When there were roughly ten thousand of them, they arranged themselves into phalanxes, making for a spectacular sight! Most importantly, every single heroic spirit had actually reached the Soul Formation stage...</p>

    <p>Buried in the earth, Ghost Emperor of the South paled when he saw this scene. He had actually thought about using his ghost generals and ghost soldiers in this confrontation... for every one thousand ghost soldiers he could summon, there would only be one ghost general at the Soul Formation stage.</p>

    <p>But every single one of the heroic spirits in front of him now was at the Soul Formation stage, and the most frightening thing was that there were ten thousand of them! According to the red-haired young man, he still had ninety thousand more in reserve!</p>

    <p>The huge gap in strength made Ghost Emperor speechless.</p>

    <p>They treated grade eight spells as the rarest of treasures, while the other party had casually thrown out a grade ten spell...</p>

    <p>"Senior, wait a second, I'll build a chair for you at once!" Immortal Zhenyuan said in the air as he looked at the ten thousand soldiers that he had summoned.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>All the demons: "..."</p>

    <p>Build a... chair?</p>

    <p>Then these thousands of heroic spirit soldiers started to move. On this vast land that was the pass to the western territory, everyone watched as the soldiers in the back row stepped onto the shoulders of the soldiers in front as they piled up layer upon layer. They used their own bodies as building blocks, finally creating a gargantuan chair... This was a heroic spirit royal throne created by heroic spirits with a very high back and wide armrests. It was amply gorgeous and magnificent-looking. Above all, it was imposing and majestic, and there was an overbearing air about it which stupefied everyone.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha tried its best to contain the shock in its heart.</p>

    <p>"Senior, please!" Immortal Zhenyuan raised his hand and made a welcoming gesture.</p>

    <p>Then Er Ha sat at the top...</p>

    <p>To be honest, it wasn't very comfortable, but when all was said and done, the chair triumphed in grandeur.</p>

    <p>"Senior Dog, do you need to make a speech? I have a lighting director among my heroic spirits." Zhenyuan smiled as he floated next to Er Ha.</p>

    <p>"A lighting director?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, a lighting director."</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan then clapped his hands, and Er Ha saw an outstanding young man in gold armor with artfully styled blonde hair and earrings slowly walk out of the Heroic Spirit Summoning Array in the sky. The young man folded his arms, and looked very defiant and arrogant.</p>

    <p>This blonde young man strolled through the air to Er Ha's side, and it felt the man's figure land behind its back! Along with this figure, a cluster of lights gathered above Er Ha's head, and in that moment it felt like the main star!</p>

    <p>The only drawback was that the magic weapon for gathering this light wasn't very stylish. Er Ha took a look and discovered that it was actually a lamp post...</p>

    <p>"Senior Dog, you don't know, but it cost me a lot in the beginning to summon this lighting director." Staring at the blonde young man holding the lamp post, Zhenyuan sighed deeply. "To be honest, I didn't really want him at first, but then I thought it wouldn't be a bad idea to have him around as a flashlight. The point is that he looks gorgeous! He's bright and golden all over!"</p>

    <p>"Hm..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha looked up at the yellow light of the lamp post. "But isn't this light a little dark?"</p>

    <p>"Does Senior Dog feel it's dark? No problem, it can be adjusted."</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan snapped his fingers and said directly to the blonde young man, "Gilgamesh, did you hear that?! Senior Dog wants you to make the light brighter!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>All the demons: "..."</p>
