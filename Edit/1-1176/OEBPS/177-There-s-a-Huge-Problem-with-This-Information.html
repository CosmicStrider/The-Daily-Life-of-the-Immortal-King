  <h1>Chapter 177 There's a Huge Problem with This Information </h1>

  <div>

    <p>The annihilation of Shadow Stream in fact had affected quite a number of people.</p>

    <p>In that magnificent edifice in the heart of the city, after Ah You's death and the confirmation that Ah Zuo had become a vegetable, it was as if the Lady of the Castle now lived permanently in her office. With Mo Immortal Castle being hit by major events one after another, she had too many matters to deal with. Almost every ten minutes or so, there would be someone delivering the latest intelligence to her office.</p>

    <p>The Lady's penthouse office had all the signs of a presidential suite; bathroom, bedroom — it had everything she needed. Early this morning, the Lady of the Castle had woken up from her state of breath regulation and had felt much more refreshed. Her dead brain cells from yesterday had all been replenished in one night.</p>

    <p>For a cultivator, cross-legged breathing meditation was much more effective than the sleep of normal people.</p>

    <p>When she pushed her bedroom door open, the files on the office table had already piled up like a small mountain. A lot of them had to do with the impact which the annihilation of Shadow Stream had on Mo Immortal Castle. After all, Mo Immortal Castle had over the years had quite a fair bit of private dealings with Shadow Stream, so the latter's sudden collapse would naturally have affected them. But this wasn't critical, since Mo Immortal Castle had only worked together with Shadow Stream and wasn't dependent on them.</p>

    <p>After searching for a while through the stack of data that had been delivered early in the morning, the Lady of the Castle finally came upon a piece of information which caught her interest.</p>

    <p>It was on that family in the "small villa" on the outskirts on East Huang Road.</p>

    <p>Previously, the Lady had sent two Mo Immortal Castle cultivators there, but their life signs had been lost after they had entered that villa. After that day, she had gotten her intelligence personnel to probe into this family's background.</p>

    <p>She started scanning the information word by word from the beginning, for fear of missing any important clues.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, she almost flipped her table over after reading it.</p>

    <p>It was just a normal family! —The lady homeowner was a housewife and the master of the house was a website novelist! Their son was still in Senior Grade One, and was just a student at the Foundation Establishment stage! There was also an old man in the family who already had one foot in the grave...</p>

    <p>The Lady of the Castle really couldn't figure out how her cultivators had been sent to their deaths by such an ordinary family. Had they bumped into a fucking ghost?!</p>

    <p>Her first thought was that she had been hoodwinked by the intelligence department.</p>

    <p>However, as a responsible leader, she still continued reading the information. After all, Mo Immortal Castle's intelligence personnel had all been trained by a retired old man from Chaoyang District whom they had employed at high cost, and the work of gathering information which the department had done all this time had always been very reliable.</p>

    <p>According to the information collected by a Mo Immortal Castle intelligence agent, in March this year, Shadow Stream killers had launched a surprise attack on Number 60 High School. As a result, the Three Young Masters of Burying Love who were ranked in the top twenty on the international list of killers, along with dozens of their subordinates, had all died in battle. Number 60 High School hadn't experienced any casualties, and not even a single hair on any student's head had been harmed at all...</p>

    <p>The second piece of information: in May this year, elite students from Number 60 High School had been sent to Number 59 High School to participate in a inter-school spirit sword exchange meet. During the exchange meet, the younger sister of the Master of Shadow Stream, Gold Ribbon killer Jiang Liuying, had attempted to instigate a night attack on the eve of the exchange meet, but in the end had been arrested instead...</p>

    <p>Then there was the third piece of information, which had to do with the Shadow Stream incident this time.</p>

    <p>On the surface, there didn't seem to be anything else that could be inferred from these three incidents apart from "Shadow Stream" as the thing that linked them all together.</p>

    <p>But the Lady had still found a slight connection between all of them!</p>

    <p>She realized that these three incidents had all had something to do with that high school student at the Foundation Establishment stage who lived in that villa on the outskirts! It seemed like wherever this high school student was, Shadow Stream would follow! But this still wasn't the most important thing; the most important was that each emergency situation which had been caused by Shadow Stream had been perfectly resolved. This forced the Lady to wonder about the truth behind these incidents.</p>

    <p>As for the third incident, although Wang Ling didn't seem connected to it on the surface, according to information from the intelligence department on the recently popular "Director of the General Administration of 100 Schools, Zhuo Yi," the latter actually had a complex relationship with this family...</p>

    <p>All in all, after looking at these three incidents together as a whole, the Lady couldn't help cupping her chin and pondering deeply.</p>

    <p>In the beginning, this family had inadvertently bought the stone ghost mask online. When Song Qingshu had gone to acquire it, he had been obstructed in every way possible. If this had been a normal family, there was no way they could have resisted the lure of so much money.</p>

    <p>After careful thought, the Lady of the Castle suddenly understood that in the last few months, there was a reason why Mo Immortal Castle had failed in their efforts to grab the stone ghost mask.</p>

    <p>She drew in a sharp breath and felt that this time, they had really provoked a very troublesome opponent...</p>

    <p>From a summary of current intelligence, Zhuo Yi, Director of the General Administration of 100 Schools; Lord Diulei, founder of the cultivation forum; plus this family's master of the house, a well-known website novelist; along with some cultivation big shots who had one after another demonstrated support online after Mother Wang's groping incident... this inconspicuous small villa on the desolate outskirts was unexpectedly connected to so many world-shakers in the cultivation circle.</p>

    <p>Who the hell was this Wang Ling?</p>

    <p>Was he really just a normal high school student?</p>

    <p>If the other party was just a high school student... then, who was the almighty senior who stood behind him?</p>

    <p>The Lady of the Castle didn't dare to continue with this line of thought. Under the circumstances, she didn't have solid evidence to prove that there was something wrong with this family; at the most, she could only hazard a guess that there was an unimaginable big shot watching from behind them. The Lady was already very clear on the fact that they had all underestimated this family repeatedly by assuming that they were just an ordinary family; that was why they had ultimately failed each time they had engaged with them.</p>

    <p>Whatever the case, before they made a move the next time, they had to clearly assess the situation first.</p>

    <p>Linking her slender fingers together, the Lady rested her chin on them, and her gold-rimmed women's glasses perched on the high bridge of her nose glinted in the light.</p>

    <p>A moment later, she picked up the phone and dialed the director of their intelligence department, Gongsun Liancheng. "Is this Director Gongsun?</p>

    <p>On the other end of the phone came an elderly voice. "It is, Lady."</p>

    <p>"I've read all the intelligence on that villa on the outskirts. Investigate anything to do with this villa again carefully; the family's overall basic income, their regular activities, I want to know everything. Also, send someone to specially investigate a student for me; find out who his classmates and teachers are. You have one day to give me all the information you have."</p>

    <p>"Not a problem, Lady. What is the student's name?"</p>

    <p>"He's called..."</p>

    <p>Er, wait... what was his name?</p>

    <p>Fuck!</p>

    <p>What on earth was his name?!</p>

    <p>The Lady was very embarrassed; how could she have forgotten the information she had just read?!</p>

    <p>As her lips twitched awkwardly, her gaze fell on the data in her hands once more... then, she was stunned!</p>

    <p>Because now, the data was actually all covered in mosaic tiles!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, Wang Ling, who had been sitting cross-legged, let out a deep breath; he had just finished upgrading his "Great Shielding Spell," which was one of the Three Thousand Great Spells.</p>
