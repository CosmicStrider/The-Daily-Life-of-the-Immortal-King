  <h1>Chapter 811 The Diligent and Thrifty Office Of Strategic Deception</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Hundreds of Soul Formation cultivators... what kind of momentum was this?!</p>

    <p>The sect leaders were all dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>If one had to know, it was already quite extravagant to invite several Soul Formation cultivators to be the guard of honor at a regular sect's founding ceremony. Not only was hiring Soul Formation cultivators costly, the most important thing was that they were extremely difficult to hire. And yet, the Office of Strategic Deception had actually gathered such a large number of Soul Formation cultivators to be their honor guard... For one moment, the group of sect leaders on the ground who saw this felt their insides hurt.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, this was the gap between renminbi players and ordinary players...</p>

    <p>On the other side, in the machine room under the stage on the Office of Strategic Deception's northern square.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei, Chief of the Office of Strategic Deception, was secretly watching everything on a screen. There was a machine room under the stage in each square. When the time came later, he would use the lift in the center of the machine room to appear directly in the middle of the stage.</p>

    <p>At that moment, the celebration of the Office of Strategic Deception's founding began.</p>

    <p>Watching hundreds of Soul Formation cultivators slowly descend from the immortal warship as they waved red streamers, Lord Diulei was overwhelmed with emotion.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin and Er Ha were both with Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "So many Soul Formation cultivators must have cost quite a bit... woof?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "And to gather so many Soul Formation cultivators to do nothing more than wave ribbons for that money is truly amazing!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha spread its dog paws. "Maybe Grandpa Yuan fed them too much <sup>1</sup> ! Woof!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>("Grandpa Yuan" refers to Yuan
Longping, the "father of
hybrid rice." The phrase is
now used online to mock
others who are deemed
useless or inferior.)</dfn>

    <p>Xiao Yin nodded, crouched down and gave Er Ha a high-five.</p>

    <p>Although this Silver and this dog were usually foes, they were unexpectedly on the same wavelength when it came to this matter.</p>

    <p>"Brother Dog... why are you suddenly adding a suffix to your words now?" Lord Diulei sweated.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Since learning the 'Basic Dog Skills,' I can't help but want to piss whenever I see a pole, woof!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei and Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>"I spoke about this to Shen Wuyue, Sage Master of the demon race. Later, he thought up a way for me to deal with it. He said that if I wanted to deal with this aftereffect, I can't fight it psychologically - instead, I have to be more like a dog. Since I wasn't a dog to begin with, my soul might have unconsciously experienced some conflict when I learned this technique... woof."</p>

    <p>"So this is what you came up with?"</p>

    <p>"That's right, woof!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Coming back to the main topic, Lord Diulei looked at the screen in front of him and said, "Actually, I didn't spend much at all for this group of Soul Formation cultivators. Our sect has only just been founded, how can I spend money so recklessly? Sects will generally invite two or three Soul Formation cultivators to act as a guard of honor at their founding ceremonies. These several hundred people actually cost about the same as two or three Soul Formation cultivators."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin and Er Ha were shocked. "How can it be so cheap???"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei touched his head and grinned. "Brother Ling drew me a large stack of Soul Formation talismans before. These talismans can upgrade auras to the Soul Formation stage in the short-term, but in truth aren't very helpful for increasing strength. This lot in the sky now are actually all at the Foundation Establishment stage."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin and Er Ha: "..." Even this could work?!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Brother Ling also said before that he would draw Void Refinement talismans. But I looked at the VIP list later and realized that a lot of the guests were Void Refinement cultivators, so it didn't seem very polite to organize a Void Refinement honor guard, even if it's fake! It would be too embarrassing and shameful for them!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha broke out in a sweat.</p>

    <p>That group of sect leaders looking at this momentum outside right now might already be feeling ashamed...</p>

    <p>At that moment, a signal light in the machine room lit up, and a familiar voice came through the speaker next to it. "Senior Immortal, everything is ready. The host has already arrived backstage."</p>

    <p>It was Cailian Zhenren's voice.</p>

    <p>Today, she was in charge of venue proceedings.</p>

    <p>"Alright, then have the host enter as planned." Lord Diulei nodded.</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren: "Roger!"</p>

    <p>A few seconds later, a middle-aged host wearing black-rimmed glasses and a smile on his very familiar-looking face approached from backstage. He had very long sideburns, which gave this uncle the appearance of a middle-aged elite. Back straight, he strolled unhurriedly onto the stage.</p>

    <p>At that moment, dozens of buses were driving in from different directions to the northern square, and more and more people began to gather.</p>

    <p>Sect leaders, deputy sect leaders and relevant representatives from Earth-, Black-, Yellow- and Dust-level sects, as well as regional leaders, media reporters and others, were now all in place.</p>

    <p>But this wasn't the highlight...</p>

    <p>When he went onstage, this middle-aged host gave the immortal warship in the sky a look.</p>

    <p>As the host, he already knew what was going to happen throughout the entire founding ceremony, and naturally he knew what kind of bigwigs were on the immortal warship.</p>

    <p>Pa!</p>

    <p>A spotlight was projected down from the immortal warship to light up the middle-aged host's figure, and a deep and stately voice was broadcasted all of a sudden.</p>

    <p>Everyone present instantly quieted down until there was only the sound of the host's voice. "Guests, leaders, executives, sect leaders, deputy sect leaders, representatives, and friends from the media, good morning! The celebration ceremony for the founding of the General Office of Strategic Deception, or the Office of Strategic Deception, is about to begin."</p>

    <p>When they had a clear look at the face of the middle-aged host under the spotlight, a lot of people couldn't help being startled</p>

    <p>Because this host's identity wasn't simple...</p>

    <p>This was the royal host who hosted Huaxiu's annual state ceremony - Wang Han!</p>

    <p>"My god, Lao Gudong Han is also here..."</p>

    <p>"It's actually Lao Gudong Han. Is this for real..."</p>

    <p>"It's really Lao Gudong Han! Look at his sideburns and black-rimmed glasses, that's him in the flesh!"</p>

    <p>"WTF?! It's really him! How did the Office of Strategic Deception manage to invite him?"</p>

    <p>The moment Wang Han appeared in the spotlight before everyone, even the media reporters were stupefied. For a moment, the square was silent, and they were so surprised they even forgot to press their camera shutters.</p>

    <p>This was a host whose experiences were pretty legendary. Not only was he a master professional host, his strength wasn't ordinary, as he was a genuine Void Refinement cultivator.</p>

    <p>Many people still dimly remembered how Wang Han had become famous back then.</p>

    <p>He had once done an ad for lao tan pickled cabbage beef noodles, but when they were reshooting some scenes, the crew was attacked by gangsters. In that moment, Lao Gudong Han stepped forward, and used the pickled cabbage inside the noodles he had been eating to hang and kill the gangsters, and thus made a name for himself through this fight.</p>

    <p>After that, the ad slogan spread far and wide and became a classic...</p>

    <p>â€” Some copy my face, some copy my noodles, but you can't copy how I uphold world peace with pickled cabbage <sup>2</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Adapted from the ad slogan
for Tong Yi instant lao tan
pickled cabbage beef noodles ..)</dfn>
