  <h1>Chapter 149 Shock! The Real Godly Weapon Is Actually... </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was pretty common for an education institution to sell healthcare products, but Wang Ling truly felt that Mo Immortal Castle had chosen the wrong place — they had neglected to take Sun Rong into account. As the young miss of a pharmaceutical group, she was naturally highly sensitive to drugs. False advertising of healthcare products was a common occurrence nowadays in the market... Sun Rong had never heard of any of the four experts who had been mentioned in the promotion video, so she was a little worried.</p>

    <p>During recess, she gave her butler Lin San a call.</p>

    <p>"Liu Hongbin? Li Zhiming? Wang Zhijin? Gao Zhenzhong?" On the other end of the call, Old Butler Lin frowned grimly. "Young Miss, are you sure it was these four in the video?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong nodded. "Yes, it was them!"</p>

    <p>Old Butler Lin was lost in silence. "...These four people usually appear on midnight healthcare programs, pretending to be experts. In fact, none of them have medical qualifications. People have given them the nicknames East Poison, West Lunatic, South Weakling and North Swindler."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was a little vexed. "Doesn't that mean the quality of this Mo Immortal Water isn't guaranteed?"</p>

    <p>Lin San: "It's far more than that! This type of product with false certification definitely carries other risks!"</p>

    <p>"Then Uncle Lin, what should we do now?" asked Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Lin San nodded. "Young Miss, don't worry. I'll call Headmaster Chen now, and use our privilege as director of the school board to ban this private tuition institution from selling this product in the school."</p>

    <p>Needless to say, Lin San was very efficient. As soon as he ended the call with Sun Rong, he straightaway went to work on this school-related matter.</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu was agitated as he made a call to Headmaster Chen's office. "Headmaster Chen, you've already received our advertising fee, how can you back out now?"</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen's face was full of regret. "We've already played the promotion video in all our classes. But with regard to publicly selling Mo Immortal Water in the school, the director of our school board at Number 60 High School feels that it's very unreliable, and is afraid to take the risk. How about I return part of this fee back to you?"</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu's expression grew dark. "I don't care! Give me the board director's phone number! I'll make a call to ask right now!"</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen was helpless. "Mr Song, it's best that you don't waste your energy... our board director is occupied with important matters, and your phone call won't go through. You'll probably be put on a waiting list, and looking at the duration, I'm guessing that you'll only get through to him in half a year..."</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu: "Who is your board director?"</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen: "Oh... he's the CEO of Huaguo Water Curtain Group, Sun Kaiming. His daughter studies here, didn't you know that, Mr Song?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>After hearing this, Song Qingshu felt like crying but had no tears left to shed.</p>

    <p>This school clearly had the CEO of Huaguo Water Curtain Group as their board director... and they still pretended to be poor!</p>

    <p>Hello! Was that 110 <sup>1</sup> ? He wanted to report someone here for swindling advertising fees!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(110 is the emergency number for police in China..)</dfn>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Sometimes, people who had a run of bad luck would even get something stuck between their teeth when drinking water. Song Qingshu had just picked the most inconspicuous school based on high school statistical data from the city office. How could he possibly have known that the Young Miss of Huaguo Water Curtain Group was a student there?!</p>

    <p>This was bad — there was no way Mo Immortal Castle could sell the potion in the school now, which meant that half his plan had already failed... but if he gave up here, he would have failed for good.</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu was extremely familiar with the Lord of the Castle's ruthlessness. Over the years, many people had died under the Lord's hand and their souls turned into house pets. Whether it was veteran staff who had worked for Mo Immortal Castle for many years or newbies who had just joined the company, for those who didn't meet the performance standard or hadn't accomplished anything, there was only one ending for them — death.</p>

    <p>However, Song Qingshu wasn't going to sit around and wait for his doom.</p>

    <p>Before the mission was deemed a complete failure, he decided to run away first!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In Songhai city, Song Qingshu was sorting out his belongings inside a luxury apartment.</p>

    <p>He had bought a plane ticket with a fake ID card, and planned to escape abroad. As he hadn't been removed from his position yet, it hadn't been difficult to get a fake ID made for himself. Furthermore, based on what he knew about Mo Immortal Castle's capabilities after all these years, they couldn't track him overseas to kill him... if everything went smoothly, Song Qingshu felt that his escape plan had an over eighty percent chance of being successful.</p>

    <p>He checked his briefcase one last time and confirmed that he had all the fake papers required to hide his real identity. After that, he put them away in a separate wallet. Although all these were forged, they could fully pass as genuine. He had asked his comrade in the City Cultivation Police's technology department to alter his online profile, so there wouldn't be any problems at all if his identity had to be verified online.</p>

    <p>But there were really too many things in the apartment. Running out of time, Song Qingshu couldn't take everything with him. At least he didn't have to worry that he wouldn't have enough space, since it was much easier for cultivators to run off than ordinary people — a common spatial magic treasure could solve everything.</p>

    <p>Apart from that wallet full of forged papers, his briefcase also contained clothes, magic treasures and some precious elixirs.</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu assumed that after the Lord of the Castle found out that he had fled, the first thing he would definitely do would be to freeze all the bank accounts in his name. But drawing out huge amounts of cash in a short period of time would make people suspicious anyway, so after careful thought, Song Qingshu decided to leave with just the magic treasures and elixirs.</p>

    <p>These magic treasures had just been lying around — after he was abroad, he could make a huge fortune by selling them.</p>

    <p>When everything was ready, Song Qingshu picked up his small briefcase. But when he opened his front door, there was a tall woman with long hair down to her waist standing there in a black jacket and sunglasses.</p>

    <p>The instant she saw him, her lips curved slightly and she laughed coldly. "Mr Song Qingshu, you really were going to run."</p>

    <p>"You are...!" Song Qingshu was stunned. This woman had to be a killer sent by the Lord or Lady!</p>

    <p>"I'm Ah Zuo and I work for the Lady of the Castle. She already knew you were going to flee." While she spoke, she played leisurely with her pretty, manicured nails. "Did you think you could hide your little scheme from the Lady? There really have been too many people who have attempted to flee over the years, and Ah You and I have had a hard time killing all of them."</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu instantly broke out in a cold sweat. He could sense how formidable this woman was! She was at the Soul Formation stage at the very least, which was more than enough to kill him!</p>

    <p>"Miss Ah Zuo, please let me go. I can give you whatever you want!" Song Qingshu hugged his briefcase to his chest and quivered violently as he spoke. His heart was filled with terror and also endless sorrow... in all his years as a Mo Immortal Castle executive, when had he ever been as humble as this?</p>

    <p>He had never expected to be reduced to such a state today.</p>

    <p>"Do you think what you can offer me is more than what I can get from the Lord and Lady?"</p>

    <p>Miss Ah Zuo spread her slender fingers open, and Song Qingshu saw her blood-red nails emit a faint golden glow... this woman didn't carry any weapons on her because she had in fact refined her own fingernails into a magic treasure!</p>

    <p>"My nails are on par with a seventh-class holy weapon." As the woman approached him slowly, that golden light surged violently. She looked straight at Song Qingshu from behind her sunglasses.</p>

    <p>A seventh-class holy weapon...</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu was utterly stupefied. A ninth-class holy weapon could already easily injure anyone with a realm under the Soul Formation stage.</p>

    <p>If these nails with the strength of a seventh-class holy weapon scratched him, he would undoubtedly die!</p>

    <p>Hu !</p>

    <p>Brandishing her fingernails, Ah Zuo directly swiped at Song Qingshu.</p>

    <p>He squeezed his eyes shut as her attack directly penetrated his briefcase, leaving five deep finger holes.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, it won't hurt..."</p>

    <p>But after Miss Ah Zuo's nails pierced his briefcase, they seemed to be blocked by something and were unable to push in any further.</p>

    <p>"What's going on?!"</p>

    <p>She struggled as hard as she could.</p>

    <p>And then, there was a " crack "...</p>

    <p>Dumbfounded, she realized that her fingernails had unexpectedly snapped off!!</p>

    <p>Following that, there was a massive backlash from Song Qingshu's small briefcase which directly sent this Miss Ah Zuo flying to smash into the wall behind her!</p>

    <p>The unbelievably powerful impact forced Ah Zuo to cough up a mouthful of blood, and she gave Song Qingshu a disbelieving look. "What the hell do you have inside your briefcase?"</p>

    <p>He promptly opened his briefcase to check...</p>

    <p>Very quickly, he found a pair of glowing long johns!</p>

    <p>Holding the long johns in his hands, Song Qingshu had a dumbstruck expression on his face — these were the long johns from the Wang family's small villa back then! When he had been sorting out his clothes previously, he had been in such a hurry that he had also packed the long johns.</p>

    <p>The most frightening thing was that this pair of long johns had actually warded off the power of a seventh-class holy weapon and saved his life!</p>
