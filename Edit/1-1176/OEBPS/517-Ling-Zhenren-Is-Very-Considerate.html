  <h1>Chapter 517 Ling Zhenren Is Very Considerate </h1>

  <div>

    <p>The truth was that Wang Ling was well aware of Er Ha's thoughts.</p>

    <p>Why did Wang Ming know how to use Lord Ma, and in so much detail?</p>

    <p>The reason was very simple...</p>

    <p>It was actually because Wang Ling and Wang Ming these two brothers were colluding together.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ming had just arrived at the villa earlier, Er Ha had still been lying outside, and Wang Ling had immediately communicated the ins and outs of the matter to Wang Ming telepathically.</p>

    <p>Why did it have to be Wang Ming to give the explanation?</p>

    <p>Because it would look more natural and Er Ha wouldn't be quick to become suspicious.</p>

    <p>On top of that, Wang Ling had also asked Wang Ming beforehand to secretly hack Er Ha's account and check its recent online transactions. They had confirmed two things.</p>

    <p>One: The money which Er Ha had obtained recently had indeed been swindled from Xiao Yin...</p>

    <p>Two: They could tell from the materials Er Ha had purchased that this money was for completing a teleportation array. Wang Ling had never seen this array before, but it wasn't hard to figure out that this was a spell similar to a "Homecoming Array" since the array structure was pretty much the same, and roughly sixty to seventy percent of the same materials were required to set it up.</p>

    <p>Most importantly, the money which Er Ha had was far from enough to complete this "Homecoming Array"; currently, it couldn't even buy three or four tenths of the materials required...</p>

    <p>In addition, it was actually very risky for Er Ha to go back. Wang Ling had already modified its core so that it no longer used demon qi, but spirit energy. For one thing, using pure spirit energy to mobilize a demon clan's magic array might not work, and there was a pretty high possibility, moreover, that it might trigger a reverse chain reaction.</p>

    <p>Therefore, to sum up, Wang Ling thought that the best and safest way for Er Ha to return to its clan was to use Lord Ma.</p>

    <p>Moreover, he had already done something to Lord Ma so that the moment Er Ha was teleported, it would be boosted by a top-secret "Buff" which would ensure that Er Ha would return to its clan safely and without a hitch. Although Wang Ling didn't know exactly what was happening in the Tuntian Ha clan, his Buff would be more than enough to help Er Ha achieve the heights of its monstrous goals in the demon world...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Lord Ma usually lay dormant and had to be flushed awake in order to be used.</p>

    <p>In fact, Er Ha didn't remember ever seeing Lord Ma completely transformed into a human before... Lord Ma was probably the only gremlin in the villa that didn't have a human form. When all the gremlins in the villa had gathered together before, Er Ha had heard Eraser and Pen say that water kept running out of Lord Ma's seven orifices in human form, which was too disgusting... Little Master Ling had thus later canceled this transformation.</p>

    <p>So how was he supposed to use Lord Ma after rousing it?</p>

    <p>Er Ha wondered if Lord Ma's voice would carry the sound of rich experience and a faint echo...</p>

    <p>The toilet lid on Lord Ma's body lifted by itself and a voice came from inside: "I serve only the Supreme King <sup>1</sup> ..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is a line from the "Overlord" series which has become a meme..)</dfn>

    <p>Er Ha: "..." So damn chuuni!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling also sweated a little at this voice.</p>

    <p>When he had enlightened Lord Ma, he hadn't given it a personality. Because he wanted each gremlin to have their own character, Wang Ling had let them develop their own personalities after enlightening them.</p>

    <p>And then, Lord Ma had become like this...</p>

    <p>Transmission to the coordinates wasn't as complicated or as dirty as Er Ha had thought it would be... it wouldn't have to stick its head inside Lord Ma.</p>

    <p>After Wang Ling recited the fixed coordinates, Er Ha saw Lord Ma emit a radiant light which wrapped around Little Master Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling glanced at Er Ha at his feet, and the light that was already wrapped around him instantly split off to envelop Er Ha as well.</p>

    <p>"???" Er Ha completely hadn't expected Wang Ling to bring it along.</p>

    <p>By the time Er Ha reacted, Wang Ming saw one person and one dog instantly vanish on the spot with something like a clap of thunder.</p>

    <p>Why had Wang Ling brought Er Ha along?</p>

    <p>Because you might have an adverse reaction after being transported by Lord Ma for the first time, which might make you puke.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling wanted Er Ha to get used to it beforehand.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that he was being very considerate of his family's Er Ha!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>About a quarter of an hour ago...</p>

    <p>The drab world which Evil Sword God had visited before, where the clouds were all dark gray, was like a newborn planet with unusual rocky terrain. There was no life here and the oxygen was very thin. This place had a completely different composition to Earth; even gravity was different here.</p>

    <p>A red-haired young man in a black cloak stood alone in this dry and cracked land. He tilted his head to the sky with his eyes closed as he felt the faint ripples of this world. This was a planet which he had brought here from outside the Milky Way. It was completely bereft of life, without even a blade of grass or a flower.</p>

    <p>Between the red-haired young man's eyebrows was a Daoist mark that resembled a flower. Upon closer look, it resembled the "yuan" character.</p>

    <p>Standing in this land, the young man had reckoned that someone would be coming today and that the other party would be an Almighty.</p>

    <p>After a while, his senses were hit by an astral wind as an intangible figure appeared in front of him; it looked like a wind spirit, and only the outline of its figure could be seen.</p>

    <p>When this person spoke, it instantly caused millions of ripples throughout this world. "Zhenyuan... the human world is doomed to be annihilated; the savior you seek does not exist. You and I should join hands and go forth together; we can start a new life outside the Milky Way and become masters of creation!"</p>

    <p>"Perhaps."</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan opened his eyes and said slowly, "I've already done all I can to look for this person, and my search has proven fruitless so far. But what a pity that when I was about to give up recently, I did feel that it was possible that such a person does exist."</p>

    <p>"Because someone forced the Gate Between Worlds shut the last time?" The wind spirit person waved his hand. "That was nothing more than a coincidence - perhaps something went wrong with the summoning array. The Gate Between Worlds is a world-defying magic weapon and can only be shut when all the True Immortals of Huaxiu join hands and release all their power. Their vitality also undoubtedly sustained heavy damage at the time."</p>

    <p>The wind spirit person laughed. "You don't really think that the door was closed by a person, do you? If there had been any realm fluctuations in that world, both you and I would have felt it. And aside from the two of us, there are no other Venerated Immortals in the world..."</p>

    <p>"You're right, maybe there aren't any other Venerated Immortals..."</p>

    <p>The red-haired young man sighed. "But..."</p>

    <p>In fact, he had always felt that there should an existence in this world that was more powerful than they were...</p>

    <p>"After stepping into the Spirit Energy Information era, you and I have already proven that a Venerated Immortal is the pinnacle of cultivation," the wind spirit person mused.</p>

    <p>"We're not familiar with each other, don't use 'you and I.' Other people will misunderstand."</p>

    <p>The red-haired young man raised his head to look at the indistinct outline of the wind spirit person in front of him. "Sooner or later, I'll destroy you."</p>

    <p>"Destroy me?" The wind spirit person's laugh was cruel and grim. "You and I share a common origin... Back then, in order to expel your inner demon, you abandoned me. If I kill myself or someone else kills me, your cultivation will be greatly impaired, unless you can kill me yourself... But you and I are evenly matched, there's no way I'll die."</p>

    <p>"You demon spirit, can you kill yourself?"</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan laughed. "I am already determined to wait in this place, to wait for the savior of the world; he will definitely be able to save it."</p>

    <p>"Even if it's Brother Echo?" the wind spirit person sneered.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, in a holding cell in Songhai First Prison, Evil Sword God sans eyeshadow sneezed violently.</p>
