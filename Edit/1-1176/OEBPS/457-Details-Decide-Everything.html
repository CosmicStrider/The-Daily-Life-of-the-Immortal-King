  <h1>Chapter 457 Details Decide Everything </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Using a frying pan to block a bullet once could be called a coincidence... but this was the second time! Even if it was a coincidence, could it happen twice in a row?</p>

    <p>However, it wasn't as if stopping a bullet with a frying pan didn't happen... There were times you could even wave a pan and send a hand grenade flying back!</p>

    <p>But this basically only happened in a 'best of' collection of "funny game videos," or when people teamed up and tried countless times before succeeding in this operation. Otherwise, in most cases, it was a false positive!</p>

    <p>At that distance, Daoist Guang had used the frying pan to send two sniper bullets flying away one after another.</p>

    <p>If this wasn't a cheat, then this reaction truly defied the heavens!</p>

    <p>In addition to the horde of brainless "Light Chaser" supporters madly sending "666" bullet messages and yelling "awesome," there were even more messages that were starting to get more and more intense in their questioning.</p>

    <p>"Isn't that a cheat? Waving a pan to block bullets, and two times at that?"</p>

    <p>"From the very beginning, Lord Island has always been an outdoor all-round entertainment live streamer. The game live stream is only three hours a day, it can't be a cheat at all!" A Light Chaser defended Daoist Guang in a bullet message.</p>

    <p>"Does anyone know a super administrator?! Strongly requesting that a super administrator check the room <sup>1</sup> . The anti-cheat system is so advanced now, they'll be able to tell straight away if cheats have been used or not!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This refers to admins that can enter live stream rooms at will to check whether live streamers have done anything against the rules or not.)</dfn>

    <p>"Yes, yes! Strongly agree! Have a super administrator check!"</p>

    <p>"Agree! If he didn't use cheats, I'll immediately become a Light Chaser and send the live streamer ten immortal boats!"</p>

    <p>"What? My live streamer is awesome! Go do it if you can! If you can't, can you stop yammering about it?!"</p>

    <p>"Our Lord Island can behead you with a katana at ten thousand meters without wasting a single breath!"</p>

    <p>"Enough! Can the reverse fans and trolls shut up and let the rest of us watch the live stream? Do you want to ruin esports <sup>2</sup> ?!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is a statement made by the CEO of EDward Gaming, a professional League of Legends esports team in China, in response to some players dissing the team.)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>He felt that this last statement seemed a little familiar somehow!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>There was increasing demand in the bullet messages to test for cheats. After all, Daoist Guang had survived until now with just a katana and had successfully killed two people. He had also blocked two sniper shots in succession with a frying pan. From an outsider's point of view, all of these looked like the operation of an immortal... including Lord Island's amazing hearing, his ability to instantly lock onto a target's location and his superb response skills, when all of these particulars were added together, suspicions of him using cheats grew stronger.</p>

    <p>There were plenty of times when a person would be suspected of most likely using cheats when they were able to do something that no one else could.</p>

    <p>And most important of all, Daoist Guang had been in the limelight too much in the last two days; tall trees attracting the wind <sup>3</sup> was also another factor.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(Has the same meaning as the tall poppy syndrome.)</dfn>

    <p>Whenever Daoist Guang's live stream started, large numbers of viewers would flock in from other live stream rooms.</p>

    <p>From the bullet messages in the live stream currently misdirecting attention and starting fights, or which even had reverse fans putting on a show, Wang Ling felt that they could be divided into three types.</p>

    <p>Type 1: Water armies who might have been hired by other live streamers or other live streaming platforms.</p>

    <p>Type 2: Fans of other live streamers who wanted to deliberately make trouble.</p>

    <p>And Type 3: Those who didn't know what was going on at all but were just going with the flow...</p>

    <p>However, since Daoist Guang wanted to engage in this industry, it was impossible to avoid these three types of people.</p>

    <p>The waters in any circle were deep, and the live streaming industry was no exception.</p>

    <p>Besides, even if there were times when it had been clarified whether someone had used cheats or not, only a small number of people would believe it while most of them would still believe in their own conclusions.</p>

    <p>Clean hands didn't need to be washed; Daoist Guang's heart was as clear as a mirror. He knew very well that even if a super administrator came by to check, they wouldn't find anything, so he continued to play with an unperturbed face.</p>

    <p>Now was not the time to care about those unreasonable bullet messages. He needed to fully concentrate on dealing with the player in the tower with the ID GAYLIGAYQI.</p>

    <p>After Lord Island switched from the frying pan back to the katana, Little Brother GAYLIGAYQI in the tower was stunned again.</p>

    <p>He just realized...</p>

    <p>The person in front of him didn't have a gun! Or even a pistol!</p>

    <p>In addition to a backpack, a helmet and armor, the only other equipment that could be seen on him were the katana and the frying pan.</p>

    <p>On the other side of the screen, Little Brother GAYLIGAYQI had a face full of black question marks. "????"</p>

    <p>So, this person... what on earth was he trying to do?</p>

    <p>Did he really intend to cut him down with a sword?</p>

    <p>This was completely unscientific!</p>

    <p>Little Brother GAYLIGAYQI was now realizing... this LORD ISLAND wasn't a normal person at all!</p>

    <p>At that moment, Little Brother GAYLIGAYQI finally realized the benefits of having a machine gun! If he had one in his hand right now, this LORD ISLAND wouldn't be able to continue protecting himself even if he had the frying pan!</p>

    <p>But generally speaking, few people would be carrying a machine gun on them halfway through the game unless they were really poor and only picked up rubbish along the way.</p>

    <p>Rifle + sniper gun were the standard equipment for most players.</p>

    <p>Seeing that Daoist Guang was already rushing forward with his katana in hand, Little Brother GAYLIGAYQI panicked and changed his SKS sniper gun to a M16A4... As long as his aim was accurate, one shot would be enough to kill the other party.</p>

    <p>However, Daoist Guang's assault was fiercer than he had imagined.</p>

    <p>This was an active attack starting at the bottom of the tower.</p>

    <p>Little Brother GAYLIGAYQI was standing at the top of the tower as he held an absolutely advantageous position.</p>

    <p>But at this point, he began to doubt life...</p>

    <p>He, who occupied an advantageous position, was instead like a weak lamb waiting to be slaughtered!</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang's steps were getting closer and closer. Little Brother GAYLIGAYQI held his breath and aimed at the mouth of the corridor.</p>

    <p>Like most players, Little Brother GAYLIGAYQI had already practiced shooting Daoist Guang in the head with his rifle countless times in his mind...</p>

    <p>Holding his breath, he pointed the muzzle of his black rifle at the bend in the corridor.</p>

    <p>As long as Daoist Guang dared show his head, GAYLIGAYQI would immediately start shooting wildly!</p>

    <p>At the same time, Wang Ling noticed that the bullet messages in the live stream room had petered out.</p>

    <p>Everyone knew that these two were on the cusp of meeting each other.</p>

    <p>Given Daoist Guang's unfavorable position, how to kill Little Brother GAYLIGAYQI with the katana was now his biggest concern.</p>

    <p>At this point, Wang Ling couldn't help taking a look at the number of viewers.</p>

    <p>Number of people: 3.98 million!</p>

    <p>Because there had been people earlier intentionally starting fights in the bullet messages, a lot of people had shared impromptu links to Daoist Guang's live stream in their chat groups, WeChat Moments, Tieba and elsewhere.</p>

    <p>Spectating would forever be an essential attribute of online users, which had directly led to the explosive growth of viewer numbers in the live stream.</p>

    <p>At that very moment, Daoist Guang was deliberately standing in a blind spot in the last stretch of the corridor as he flashed the katana in his hand. Seeing this, GAYLIGAYQI Little Brother became nervous and couldn't help shifting his feet for a better shooting angle.</p>

    <p>However, it was precisely this slight step which Daoist Guang caught once again.</p>

    <p>After confirming Little Brother GAYLIGAYQI's position, Daoist Guang charged forward with the katana without the slightest bit of hesitation!</p>

    <p>"Fuck!"</p>

    <p>Little Brother GAYLIGAYQI's complexion paled at Daoist Guang's ferocity and he released a spate of " <em>da da da da </em>."</p>

    <p>The bullets shot out, but Daoist Guang's body seemed to flicker a bit and the bullets brushed past him!</p>

    <p>"The hell? Z Shake <sup>4</sup> ?!" Little Brother GAYLIGAYQI couldn't help exclaiming.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>4</sup>(A remarkable dodging method used by the protagonist in the novel "The King's Avatar..")</dfn>

    <p>Because this little brother had turned on his public audio, everyone in the live stream room heard this yell.</p>

    <p>Viewers: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..." What fucking Z Shake!</p>
