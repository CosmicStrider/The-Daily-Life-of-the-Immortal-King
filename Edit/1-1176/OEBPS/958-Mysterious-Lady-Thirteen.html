  <h1>Chapter 958 Mysterious Lady Thirteen</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The appearance of Dark Governor Lady Thirteen caught the widespread attention of website members, rendering them speechless.</p>

    <p>Zhu Ge's <em>Shameless </em>and Father Wang's <em>Wet Nurse </em>were released in almost the same period, and both their sales were in the top ten, with Father Wang's novel being the top bestseller. Nevertheless, Dark Governor Lady Thirteen had never chosen a side nor commented on either novel or given them any gifts.</p>

    <p>At the very beginning, many people had assumed that Lady Thirteen was preparing to do something big, and they waited for a whole month. They never thought that on this last day of the month, Lady Thirteen would unexpectedly flex her muscle and directly stand on Guru Zhu Ge's side.</p>

    <p>With this single magnificent gift of one hundred thousand, the readers who had dropped into the comments section and whom Father Wang and his group had painstakingly worked on all morning were instantly drawn away.</p>

    <p>Zhu Ge this sly fox! This was too cunning!</p>

    <p>Father Chen and the rest never expected the other party to actually rely on such a fat cat.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, the "Closed" sign was hung up prominently at the entrance to Balance Magic Center.</p>

    <p>Balance Magic Center was also closed today. Inside, a long table had been set up with a spread of fruits, food and drink. Liang Heng sat on one end, while both sides of the tables were occupied by some teenagers; each one was a representative of the major fan groups in Zhu Ge's camp.</p>

    <p>That was right, Liang Heng was Zhu Ge's fan.</p>

    <p>The truth, however, was that Liang Heng didn't read online novels - but Father Chen did! Liang Heng knew that Father Chen always voted for Wang Situ's novel, and given this competitive relationship between Wang Situ and Zhu Ge, Liang Heng would naturally stand on Zhu Ge's side and compete with Father Chen.</p>

    <p>From the moment he met Chen Yi, Liang Heng had never lost in taking whatever he wanted, including that female teacher during their college years who had taken a fancy to Chen Yi! So what if it was a student and a teacher together? Liang Heng hooked up with her in the end and had Tiger Liang.</p>

    <p>After Lady Thirteen's magnificent gift of one hundred thousand, Zhu Ge's votes led by a wide margin.</p>

    <p>"Hahaha! At this rate, Wang Situ won't be able to catch up no matter how hard he tries."</p>

    <p>"After all, our Zhu Ge is a veteran. Wang Situ is a newbie and doesn't have many fans; how can he possibly compete with our lord? This year's Best Author has to belong to our Lord Zhu Ge." The group leaders cheered inside Balance Magic Center — they were already happily celebrating what they saw as their victory.</p>

    <p>They clinked their beer cans together in a toast, feeling so good.</p>

    <p>At the same time, however, it was a bit of a pity that Dark Governor Lady Thirteen hadn't shown up in person.</p>

    <p>Liang Heng had invited her over previously, and the seat at the other end of the long table had been specially reserved for her.</p>

    <p>But she said that her company had a New Year Eve's dinner that night, and so she was unable to come.</p>

    <p>Liang Heng hadn't read Zhu Ge's <em>Shameless </em>, but he spent no less money than Father Chen on the novel website; the gifts he had given in total had already exceeded a hundred thousand yuan, which was also from his secret stash of cash which he had accumulated over the years. However much Father Chen gave, Liang Heng made sure to double it!</p>

    <p>It was at their last university alumni meetup that he had seen Father Chen reading a book, and he had covertly memorized Father Chen's reader ID. It was also from that moment on that he had started putting together a comprehensive plan.</p>

    <p>"After all, Lady Thirteen is a lady and comes from money. She might have turned us down, but we knew she wouldn't make an appearance so easily." Liang Heng smiled faintly. "Also, no one has actually seen her. This is one thing about women - they need to keep a sense of mystery about them."</p>

    <p>"I heard that Chief Liang spoke with Lady Thirteen before?" asked a group leader.</p>

    <p>"That's right." Liang Heng nodded. "To help Guru Zhu Ge compete for Best Author, I spoke to Lady Thirteen previously; this is a little sister with a very sexy and lovely voice."</p>

    <p>"As expected of Chief Liang. You know so many women."</p>

    <p>"Chief Liang might be the first person of all the readers to speak to her!"</p>

    <p>"Hahaha! You flatter me. But please, don't let my wife know about this." Liang Heng smiled very amiably.</p>

    <p>"Of course! We understand! Don't worry, Chief Liang!"</p>

    <p>"One reason why I'm helping Guru Zhu Ge fight for Best Author this time is to help promote my Balance Magic Dojo; the other reason is to help take revenge for my son. You should have already heard me mention this before in the group: that barbaric father and son of Strength Super Dojo beat up my son." Liang Heng said the words easily, but actually, one only needed to ask around for a bit to find out the truth.</p>

    <p>However, these group leaders knew that Liang Heng himself was a fat cat, and they couldn't offend him.</p>

    <p>A number of them would be releasing books in the future. Given Liang Heng's close relationship with Lady Thirteen, if they could build a good relationship with him and when the time came, ask for Lady Thirteen's help to recommend their works on the website, their revenues would basically be guaranteed.</p>

    <p>Each industry had its own circle, which in turn had its own rules.</p>

    <p>These group leaders were well aware of these rules, and since they were now part of society, they would naturally do things by the rules.</p>

    <p><em>Don't ask what didn't need to be asked.</em></p>

    <p><em>Don't listen to what shouldn't be heard.</em></p>

    <p>However... there were times when the truth wasn't what it seemed.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the side, Father knew that they were coming to the end and losing morale. They had been busy from morning to noon, but the outcome was nothing like they had expected; the moment Lady Thirteen appeared, everyone had been drawn away.</p>

    <p>To be able to rely on a historical novel to attract so many readers, Zhu Ge was really something.</p>

    <p>"What should we do? Brother Chen, is there no other way?" <em>Wet Nurse </em>fan group leader Lin Gang asked.</p>

    <p>"A lot of our forum posts have already been banned. Zhu Ge has a good relationship with the administrators, and as <em>Wet Nurse </em>fans, we no longer have a foothold in those literary forums." Father Chen frowned.</p>

    <p>"What about other forums?"</p>

    <p>"The users in other forums aren't novel readers; I'm afraid we won't be able to attract any novel fans there!" Father Chen raised his misgivings.</p>

    <p>"But..." At that moment, Chen Chao suddenly said, "But, if we catch the attention of some sect leader..."</p>

    <p>As soon as Chen Chao said that, everyone turned to him.</p>

    <p>A sect leader...</p>

    <p>Were there any sect leaders who read novels?</p>

    <p>They didn't know.</p>

    <p>Nor had they tried finding out.</p>

    <p>But when it came to a forum where many sect leaders congregated, and where numerous passersby gathered for cultivation gossip, Father Chen and the group leaders instantly thought of one place — the cultivation forum!</p>

    <p>Its leader was the famous and legendary Great Death-Courting Senior: Lord Diulei!</p>
