  <h1>Chapter 414 Lord Diulei's Shocking Secret </h1>

  <div>

    <p>After the medicine had been administered, Father Wang's hemorrhoids were completely cured, but the cool and invigorating after effects was like being blasted between the thighs by Wang Zhaojun<sup>1</sup>...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Refers to the character in the RPG "King of Glory" who has ice abilities ..)</dfn>

    <p>This icy sensation would last a long time. After the violent stab of pain from the medicine being administered subsided, Father Wang would feel a persistent numbness that would spread throughout the lower half of his body, so during that time he wouldn't be able to move.</p>

    <p>"Women are the most vicious!" Lying down on the sofa, Father Wang wailed in despair deep in his heart. When he thought about how he would no longer be able to sit on the toilet for long periods of time anymore as he contemplated his plot while writing, he truly felt desperate and couldn't help raging â€” the toilet was an author's food for thought... er, source of thought!</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>This was also Er Ha's first time seeing Father Wang's hemorrhoids flare up, and it was unnerved by this event.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, it really didn't understand why some stubborn people were so obsessed with their so-called "dignity." It was just hemorrhoids. Er Ha thought that if it got hemorrhoids, it would stick its butt out for Wang Ling's hand to grope without a second thought.</p>

    <p>It was just a butt rub, and it wouldn't hurt!</p>

    <p>This was a rare anecdote of everyday life, and Er Ha thought that this was a matter worth thinking about.</p>

    <p>In the end, Er Ha decided to write this incident down in its "Human Observation Diary" with the heading: If you have hemorrhoids and you can be cured by a butt rub, would you choose to be groped for a bit or to preserve your integrity?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Of course, Wang Ling didn't dare disobey a personal order from Mother Wang. In the Wang family's small villa, there were three toilets, thus there were three toilet bowls. Wang Ling's bedroom had its own ensuite, which had the enlightened Lord Ma; it was the other two toilets that Mother Wang wanted to replace.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming replied almost instantaneously after Wang Ling sent him a message. "Yo? Missing me again?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling struggled to resist the urge to crush his wristwatch, and texted what Mother Wang had said to Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>After understanding the situation, Wang Ming grinned with amusement in front of the screen, which baffled the other people in the research institute. Only President Qi, with one hand in his pocket and the other holding the type of large cup that the old cadre used, gazed at the scene calmly with the expression of one who had already seen through everything.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming's reply text was very quick: "What? Uncle Wang's hemorrhoids flared up again? I told him before to sit less and exercise more. Squatting on the toilet bowl all the time isn't good since it's the easiest way to get a bacterial infection. Don't worry, leave this to me. I'll arrange for someone to drop by tomorrow to assemble and install it!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming had already prepared this birthday gift earlier on, so he just needed to send it in advance.</p>

    <p>But sending it off would create another awkward situation: he would have to prepare a new gift for Father Wang's actual birthday.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming also voiced his opinion on Father Wang's hemorrhoids.</p>

    <p>Very quickly, Wang Ling received yet another text message from Wang Ming. "Actually, this is Uncle Wang's fault; who asked him to have such an unbalanced routine? Once his endocrine system is out of whack, no matter how much nutrition he gets, it won't be any use."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared blankly at the text; he was thinking that it was rare for his idiot elder brother to be so serious, and he wondered whether he should give a serious reply in return.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming sent his next text. "Doesn't his son just need to grope his butt a bit? If it needs to be rubbed, just rub it... If I get hemorrhoids, feel free to do so."</p>

    <p>The corners of Wang Ling's mouth twitched. "..." Sure enough, this guy could never be that serious!</p>

    <p>On the other end, Wang Ming who was in front of the screen could almost picture Wang Ling's expression after reading that text.</p>

    <p>Apart from conducting research and inventing things, the one other thing in Wang Ming's life which he derived pleasure from was Wang Ling. He thought that it was very interesting to tease Wang Ling! An ordinary person wouldn't be able to do so at all!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After Wang Ling was done texting Wang Ming, the chat group was still lively. He saw a notification pop up on the screen, and was surprised to suddenly find that he had unexpectedly been added to a chat group called "Gossip Room."</p>

    <p>Also, this chat group had only just been set up, and its creator was Lightning Dharmaraja... At the moment, Dharmaraja was pulling in more and more people from Lord Diulei's chat group into this interim group chat he had created.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling scanned the members of this group and realized that most of the people from the chat group were in it... except for Xiao Yin and Lord Diulei!</p>

    <p>Mm... it was already clear where this was going.</p>

    <p>Gossip Room.</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja: "Everyone! I want to burst! I want to burst! I have gossip, I can't take it anymore!"</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren sent a few emojis that were wiping at sweat. "Dharmaraja... Calm down and speak slowly... Remember last time when you were so excited that your godly thunder inheritance leaked out and caused a large-scale power failure in the area..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya was stunned. "That actually happened?"</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren: "Yes! Afterwards, Dharmaraja pretended to be a concerned citizen and personally went over to do emergency repairs... they even bestowed a silk banner on him after that."</p>

    <p>Seeing what Cailian Zhenren had divulged, everyone couldn't help sucking in sharp breaths in front of their screens... What kind of operation was this?!</p>

    <p>Lightning Dharmaraja: "Zhenren, don't interrupt, I'm talking serious business... Why are you airing my faults? What I'm going to reveal today is much more shocking."</p>

    <p>Mr Toya had been about to refine elixirs, and had already prepared a pile of materials. He had been interrupted just as he was about to start his furnace, so he was slightly unhappy. "I say, Dharmaraja, you were never this gossipy before."</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja: "You don't know how shocking this news is! I tell you, it's possible that Senior Immortal has secretly gotten married!"</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren: "What???"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "What the hell???"</p>

    <p>Fang Xing: "???"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren took a deep breath and tried to keep her cool. "Isn't Senior Immortal bringing us something? How do you know he's married?"</p>

    <p>"Ring! I saw Senior Immortal wearing a ring!" Without further ado, Dharmaraja posted a photo he had taken of the Soul Suppression Ring in the group. "See? This is the ring Senior Immortal is wearing! Furthermore, he gave me an identical magic ring... isn't that fishy?"</p>

    <p>Fang Xing couldn't help laughing. "It turns out that Senior Immortal is bringing us magic rings... But Dharmaraja, isn't it a little too subjective to assume that Senior Immortal is secretly married from the ring alone?"</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja: "The problem is that Senior Immortal is wearing it on the ring finger of his left hand!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja: "He's giving each of us an identical ring. It's very obvious that he's into public displays of affection. I think we need to band together and ask Senior Immortal in person!"</p>

    <p>The corners of Wang Ling's mouth twitched. "..." This had become a huge misunderstanding!</p>
