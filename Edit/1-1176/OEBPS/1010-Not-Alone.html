  <h1>Chapter 1010 Not Alone</h1>

  <div>

    <p>With experts arriving from all over to help, it was a magnificent scene.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was touched. Next to him, Wang Ming, Er Ha, Guo Ping and the Palace of Mirrors' Mother Juan were all stunned. They couldn't help but look at the numerous golden space tunnels in the sky, which seemed to swirl with the timeless and mighty auras of numerous experts.</p>

    <p>Various experts had come right away from their respective domains, as if they were on a mission.</p>

    <p>Their auras overlapped: the fearsome primordial qi released by the cultivators from the supreme holy land, Nine-fold Star Domain of the Gods; the spiritual energy of Wang Ling's bunch of like-minded friends from Earth; the demon qi of the demon world; the divine aura of the divine realm... in that moment, they all converged.</p>

    <p>In that moment, Wang Ling finally realized that he truly wasn't fighting alone.</p>

    <p>Although Demon Saint hadn't come in person, he provided long-range support; the will of the demon world that was upon Shen Wuyue was the best proof of this. He carried the will of Demon Saint with him, and the antlers on his head exuded the qi of the bloodline of an ancient divine beast. His blood aura alone was enough to frighten the black shadow army into halting their advance, as the soldiers didn't dare press forward rashly.</p>

    <p>And when the Hundred-Winged God from the divine realm arrived, the sky was filled with a pure and holy radiance as countless pure white feathers drifted down. Instantly, it seemed to instantly dispel the gloom.</p>

    <p>A god's might was indeed boundless.</p>

    <p>Although only one Hundred-Winged God had been sent over, it was more than enough for dealing with the current situation.</p>

    <p>A Hundred-Winged God was the result of a combination of a hundred Winged Gods.</p>

    <p>"Forgive us, Ling Zhenren, we have to preserve the balance of power. If Lord Thousand-Winged God descended, I'm afraid the world might be destroyed..." After landing, the Hundred-Winged God volunteered the reason of his own accord. After all, the person they were helping out was Wang Ling; the divine realm should treat him with the highest courtesy.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "Mm..."</p>

    <p>"Lord Diulei, the demon world, Divine Dao Star and the divine realm have always been in Ling Zhenren's care. We shouldn't let him take on everything on his own this time, given how unusual the enemy is. As the keeper of order, I'll organize everything! Everyone, please assist Ling Zhenren and me: now, split up and head for the other altars. Drive out the intruders in this world!"</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi spoke from one of the golden space tunnels in the sky; his voice wasn't loud, but it seemed to reach every corner of the Palace of Mirrors.</p>

    <p>The moment Gu Shunzhi said the words, Yin Jiuquan, who was covered all over in Fate Dao runes, flew into a rage. He had been ordered to guard the Altar of Water on pain of death, and to not allow it to be destroyed before the master plan was completed.</p>

    <p>The instant the Fate Dao runes exploded with light, countless streams of foul aura suddenly burst from the marsh and lunged at the people in the sky.</p>

    <p>This was the power of the Palace of Mirrors' Altar of Water, which was tinged with decay. Once a chain touched a person, it would wrap around the body tightly. The more strength a person used, the heavier the foul chain would become, before finally dragging them into the marsh.</p>

    <p>"You think too highly of yourself." Lord Diulei shook his head. He was still holding the Royal Scepter which Zhuo Yi had taken out of a gift box. Lord Diulei waved the scepter lightly, and countless foul chains instantly changed direction in the air and abruptly pierced the ground instead.</p>

    <p>The Royal Scepter's "one hundred percent kneel" power was indeed extremely useful; it didn't affect just people but also things - it even had a similar effect on spells.</p>

    <p>Yin Jiuquan was also affected by the scepter as he dropped to his knees on the ground, pinned down by a tremendous force and completely immobile.</p>

    <p>However, Lord Diulei could feel how much effort it took to do so, as if he was armwrestling with someone. Gripping the scepter, it felt like the other party could throw off his control at any time.</p>

    <p>"As expected, the Fate Dao runes are powerful." Lord Diulei was still a little fearful. Fortunately, the Fate Dao runes on the two imposters hadn't been as strong, otherwise he might not have been able to suppress them even with the Royal Scepter.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, I'm leaving things here to you! I'm off to the Altar of Fire!" After an initial show of strength against Yin Jiuquan, Lord Diulei took everyone from the Office of Strategic Deception with him as they turned into golden streams of light that flew in the direction of the Altar of Fire.</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren, I will lead the demons to the Altar of Metal!" Shen Wuyue bowed to Wang Ling before disappearing with his people.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi: "We will have to trouble Ling Zhenren to handle things here! I'll head for the Altar of Wood!"</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren, I will go to the Altar of Earth..."</p>

    <p>Spreading his wings, the Hundred-Winged God vanished in a glow of white, holy light.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling never expected the fight to instantly turn on its head in the final moment; once again, he had won without trying.</p>

    <p>Under the Royal Scepter's immense suppression, Yin Jiuquan knelt with his forehead touching the ground, and didn't dare move an inch.</p>

    <p>As Wang Ling and the others walked over, they smelled a foul odor on him.</p>

    <p>"He stinks... is it because of the marsh?" Wang Ming frowned, and when he drew nearer for a look, he realized that Yin Jiuquan was covered in long hair...</p>

    <p>Jabbed in his sore spot, Yin Jiuquan immediately cried bitter tears. "I haven't bathed for a very, very long time."</p>

    <p>He had received formidable power as the altar envoy but was unable to leave the altar at all; the worst thing about it was that he could only eat, drink and shit inside the altar.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming and Guo Ping scanned the Altar of Water again before asking, "Is there anyone else? Why doesn't there seem to be anyone here?"</p>

    <p>"Everyone else is kneeling inside..." Yin Jiuquan answered honestly, "Some of them couldn't take my stench, and passed out."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Er Ha, Wang Ming and Guo Ping: "..."</p>

    <p>Looking at the sorry state that the Altar of Water envoy was in, the other envoys were probably in the same situation.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling then found the eye of the array of the Altar of Water, which showed clear signs of being tampered with. Raising his hand, Wang Ling used the Great Revocation Spell to restore the array to its original state. The other altars were sure to have also been modified, but since everyone who had been dispatched were supreme experts, Wang Ling didn't think it would be a problem for them.</p>

    <p>"It's all over, just like that?" Wang Ling was still a little doubtful.</p>

    <p>Everything was proceeding a little too well.</p>

    <p>With the Five Great Alters shut down, the black shadow army's plan was a failure. Then, the biggest problem now was that the person controlling everything from behind the scenes had yet to reveal himself.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that the crisis this time was likely the other party's way of testing them.</p>

    <p>He was sounding out their overall fighting strength.</p>
