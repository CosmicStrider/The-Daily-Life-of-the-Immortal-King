  <h1>Chapter 645 The Sleeping Girl</h1>

  <div>

    <p>A kun's stomach was large enough to begin with. Even a baby kun could swallow ten thousand elephants. Once the stomach was peeled open, it wouldn't be strange no matter what creature spilled out of the cavity. However, this girl wasn't inside the baby kun's stomach, but lying quietly on it, with her knees curled up like a baby as she slept.</p>

    <p>The girl had long blue hair which covered half her face but couldn't hide her beauty.</p>

    <p>Contrary to expectations, her entire body was actually very clean; even her face was the same, and didn't have the faintest trace of blood on it — everything had been kept out by a layer of dark blue magic light, which was coming from the extremely simple and crude-looking old gray clothes that she was wearing.</p>

    <p>This was a scavenger kun that was highly corrosive; every part of it was strangely and intensely acrid. The girl was able to lie peacefully inside it like this all because of the protection of the magic light which emanated from her old gray clothes.</p>

    <p>"Where did this girl come from?"</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan was dumbstruck. He had completely never expected to actually dig out a girl from inside the kun's body!</p>

    <p>Furthermore, she was a pretty girl!</p>

    <p>"What do we do, Senior Dog..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan used magic to lift the girl out and smoothly put her on the ground. He used the Immortal Eye to inspect her carefully, for no other reason than purely to see if she had any injuries.</p>

    <p>Although the girl was indeed very pretty, it was an otherworldly beauty that didn't feel like it belonged to the mundane world.</p>

    <p>In some sense, Er Ha felt that this girl was very similar to Little Master Ling...</p>

    <p>"What now? Want me to feed her holy beast blood?" Xiao Yin asked, his hands on his knees.</p>

    <p>"Not for now... This lady's vital signs are stable, it's just that she's fallen into a deep sleep for some unknown reason," answered Immortal Zhenyuan, chin in his hands. He then raised his head and gave Xiao Yin an extremely strange look, only now perceiving Xiao Yin's identity with amazement. "Miss Xiao Yin... so you're a holy beast?"</p>

    <p>"Only now you know." Xiao Yin sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p>He felt that this legendary cultivator really wasn't that great — only now did he know!</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan laughed foolishly. "Ah~ no offense, Miss Xiao Yin, I've always been more the hindsight type. I thought earlier that Miss Xiao Yin's aura was a little strange; it wasn't like a spirit beast, demon beast, or devil beast, and was even less like a human... I actually completely forgot about holy beasts. I've been wondering if Miss Xiao Yin is an alien."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>A- alien...</p>

    <p>While this answer was a stab to the heart, Xiao Yin had to admit that all these years after the extinction of holy beasts, most human cultivators had started to forget about them. The only two greatest impacts which the extinction of holy beasts had had on history were: the establishment of an annual "Spirit Beasts Protection Day"... and an uptick in dog meat hot pot culture in a particular region, thanks to Dog Saint.</p>

    <p>But the dog meat used in that regional dog hot pot was supplied through lawful channels. The type of dog used was a kind of meat dog specially bred for hot pot, similar to the dragon pork that Zhai Yin normally used when frying pork chops for Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>To be honest...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin really wanted to eat it later when he was free.</p>

    <p>Because it was said that the seasoning used for dog hot pot in that region was made from an exclusive and secret recipe based on when Dog Saint had been cooked back then!</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin remembered huddling inside the Dog clan's depository of Buddhist texts as he watched Dog Saint being cooked at the time. On one hand, his eyes were terrified; on the other, his mouth watered uncontrollably... Until now, it was hard for him to forget the smell of that spicy hot pot!</p>

    <p>"We'll take the girl back first; I'll leave you to deal with things here."</p>

    <p>After staring at the sleeping girl for a long time, Er Ha finally made a decision.</p>

    <p>Judging from the style of the old gray clothes she was wearing, Er Ha felt that the girl likely wasn't an ordinary person. It was no use just leaving her here — it would be better to take her back and see if Little Master Ling had any way of waking her up.</p>

    <p>"Okay, Senior Dog, just leave everything here to me! This vicious creature is under my control now; I'll think of a way later to find its core and then deal with it once and for all." Immortal Zhenyuan patted his chest and smiled.</p>

    <p>"Very well." Er Ha nodded. "If the hammer is about to run out of energy, you can directly call me with your immortal seal and I'll come over to charge it."</p>

    <p>A limited use magic weapon could only be used a particular number of times, but as long as it wasn't used up completely and was recharged in a timely manner, it could be used continuously.</p>

    <p>"Thank you, Senior Dog!" Immortal Zhenyuan nodded. He naturally understood the stakes here.</p>

    <p>Hence, this was also one of the biggest reasons why Immortal Zhenyuan would do everything he could to save on using the hammer.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Afterwards, Er Ha put its dog paw lightly on the girl's shoulder and Xiao Yin stamped his foot. In a ray of golden light, two people and a dog reappeared in front of Lord Ma.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling already knew about the girl in gray.</p>

    <p>In fact, he had already sent Immortal Toya a text message the moment Immortal Zhenyuan cut open the vicious beast and rescued the girl in gray from its belly.</p>

    <p>The girl had to have her own reasons for being in a coma. Moreover, they didn't know where she was from. Wang Ling didn't want to directly wake her up in his home; they were complete strangers to each other. Since her vital signs were stable and she was just in a mysterious coma, Wang Ling felt that the only thing he could do was send the girl to the hospital without delay.</p>

    <p>He wasn't a hero; he didn't need to especially show off by acting as a hero rescuing the damsel in distress!</p>

    <p>What was more, he still had to worry about the "Beast King's Remains" summer camp that would be happening in two days!</p>

    <p>And after the summer camp were the final exams!</p>

    <p>Was there anything more important than this?</p>

    <p>Thus, when Er Ha and Xiao Yin brought the girl back, the only thing Wang Ling could do was very gentlemanly place her on his own bed using a traction spell. Fortunately, the girl was clean and didn't need any special purification treatment.</p>

    <p>The one thing that Wang Ling was a little curious about was her gray clothes...</p>

    <p>Because it had the aura of Heavenly Dao on it...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stretched out his hand to touch the gray clothes and check what it was made of.</p>

    <p>In the end, he had barely done so when Mother Wang directly opened the door and came in.</p>

    <p>What she saw made Mother Wang suck in her breath...</p>

    <p>A girl in gray was fast asleep on the bed...</p>

    <p>And Ling Ling was stretching out a hand to touch the edge of the girl's clothes...</p>

    <p>What... was going on?</p>

    <p>Mother Wang covered her mouth in astonishment!</p>

    <p>Then with a "bang," she slammed the door shut.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Mom! Let me explain, mom!</p>
