  <h1>Chapter 942 Clues</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The Ying Zheng in front of him was very fat, and a little different from what Evil Sword God had imagined - it was probably because of the junk food and lack of exercise on Group Leader Detention Island.</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God didn't doubt the man's claim that he was Emperor Qin. His Purple Investigative Demon Eyes could distinguish truth from lies, and it seemed that this man wasn't lying to him... Furthermore, Evil Sword God couldn't find the slightest trace of spirit qi on this person.</p>

    <p>This was an age of national cultivation. Even the bodies of cultivators at the Physical Build stage would pulse faintly with spirit qi. If they didn't have the least bit of it at all, that person was either an alien or from ancient times.</p>

    <p>"How did you get here?"</p>

    <p>"Someone summoned me here with a holy relic," Emperor Qin answered.</p>

    <p>"Where's the summoner?"</p>

    <p>"I heard he was knocked out in the first round of the Holy Grail War <sup>1</sup> , so this emperor can't go back."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Refers to the battle royale competition in the "Fate" series.)</dfn>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"This era is far more prosperous than I could have ever imagined, and this emperor settled down here... The person who summoned me shared memories of this era with me, so I know the language of this time. Unfortunately, after he died, this emperor became homeless and penniless, and I had no idea how to go back. Thus, in order to get on with life, this emperor started to write messages about being Emperor Qin."</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God turned pale. It turned out that that famous text message had really been written by Emperor Qin himself...</p>

    <p>Saying this, a frustrated expression appeared on Ying Zheng's face. "But who would have thought that such a highly irregular message would actually spread so far and wide. In the end, the Governor found this emperor, and thought that I had the aptitude to be a text message scammer, so he appointed this emperor as a group leader to get group members to write phishing text messages and send them out every day."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Evil Sword God, Old Devil and Cheng Yu were dumbfounded. They never thought that there would be so many "fantastic" figures among these water army group leaders...</p>

    <p>"You will destroy the order if you stay here," Evil Sword God said solemnly.</p>

    <p>"I knew this day would come sooner or later," Ying Zheng said with a melancholy air. "This emperor's end is near. Very soon, the situation will be forcibly rectified and I will turn into powder that will scatter on the wind. All this time I've been waiting, waiting for someone to find me here. Let this emperor say my final words..."</p>

    <p>"Then... do you have anything else to say?"</p>

    <p>"In this era of prosperity, men are not like they were in times past; too many people show off from where they hide in the shadows. If this emperor hadn't been struggling to survive, I would have long dug a hole and buried this group of shameless and fickle criminals behind me along with that bunch of Confucian scholars <sup>2</sup> ."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(From "the burning of books and burying of scholars," two purported historical events that happened under Emperor QiÌ±n's reign.)</dfn>

    <p>"Mm, sounds logical." Evil Sword God agreed.</p>

    <p>After saying this, Ying Zheng's body gradually started to dissipate and scatter.</p>

    <p>At his last words, the corrective power of order descended and was about to erase him right away.</p>

    <p>"This emperor can only be straightened out, but not exterminated. The mastermind behind the scenes thus can do nothing to this emperor. This person is an alien, not an Earthling. Also..."</p>

    <p>When he said this, an expression of one who had been relieved ultimately appeared on Ying Zheng's face. "The Coke in this world is too delicious."</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God: "..."</p>

    <p>The Old Devil: "..."</p>

    <p>Cheng Yu: "..."</p>

    <p>The trio sunk into silence for a moment at Emperor Qin's disappearance, but thanks to the important information Ying Zheng provided, they had now locked down the suspect's basic identity.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, Zhuo Yi received information on the interrogation from Old Devil and the others; the results were outside of everyone's expectations.</p>

    <p>"It appears that the Governor's human identity might be fake." Zhuo Yi was discussing the arrest plan with Warden Liang at Songhai First Prison.</p>

    <p>"Fake?"</p>

    <p>"According to reliable intelligence, neither this Governor nor the person behind the former are from Earth," Zhuo Yi said with a grave expression. Maybe they should have thought of this earlier on; how could the criminal merely be a small Golden Core cultivator, when he could control such a large water army legion so perfectly?</p>

    <p>If this was the case, then the severity of this matter had escalated.</p>

    <p>This had initially been a very simple large-scale operation to clean up the Internet before school started again, but unexpectedly, aliens were now involved.</p>

    <p>The Earth was now establishing diplomatic ties with Divine Dao Star. At this critical juncture, both sides were striving for cosmic peace, which absolutely could not be disrupted by external factors.</p>

    <p>As for the diplomacy project, the leaders of the United Nations had decided to formulate a set of "Cosmic Laws" in collaboration with Divine Dao Star's Star Lord to illustrate their determination to safeguard cosmic peace together.</p>

    <p>But what power in the universe was trying to get in the way?</p>

    <p>No one knew.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi lowered his head. Somehow, he felt like he was forgetting something in the whole matter.</p>

    <p>"Did the man who broke into my house last time tell you anything?" Zhuo Yi suddenly thought of Kong Ruye. Previously, on August 23rd, the famous Dark Network thief, Kong Ruye, had broken into the staff apartment and tried to do something unlawful against Zhuo Yi. People had given him the nickname "Thief Saint Bai Yutang <sup>3</sup> ."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(From the Chinese TV series "My Own Swordsman..")</dfn>

    <p>It was just that this Bai Yutang wasn't capable of the Sunflower Acupuncture Skill...</p>

    <p>"Does Director Zhuo think this Kong Ruye is related to this matter?" asked Warden Liang.</p>

    <p>"Maybe." Zhuo Yi thought for a while before replying, "He has always insisted that he doesn't know who hired him, and that he was contacted via a customized chat app; this seems quite like the Governor's style."</p>

    <p>Warden Liang: "Then what was the other party's purpose for collecting Director Zhuo's DNA? It doesn't seem like they want to use it for a paternity test..."</p>

    <p>"I have a hunch that this Governor might have been ordered by someone to look for something."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi theorized, "The other side controls a huge amount of information resources on the Internet, so it shouldn't be difficult for him to get into our official database. Perhaps they needed the DNA to do a profile comparison..."</p>

    <p>"So the plot thickens." Warden Liang had a vague feeling that this matter was going to get even bigger.</p>

    <p>At the very beginning, they had been targeting the Governor for two reasons. One was for the sake of cleaning up the online environment. The other was because the Governor was using water army groups to spread rumors, to charge fees for deleting posts, to send scam text messages, and to continually expand offline. This setup, which was very similar to a pyramid scheme, constituted a massive crime against the economy.</p>

    <p>But it now appeared that this Governor stood accused of endangering national security and stealing information on government officials. The punishment for his countless crimes might be much worse than for Old Devil and the others.</p>

    <p>"What should we do now, Director Zhuo?" asked Warden Liang.</p>

    <p>"Have the Mahjong Squad continue interrogating these group leaders and see if that Governor has collected anything from them, like hair, teeth, or blood... Anything that can be used to detect DNA..." Zhuo Yi stroked his moustache as he pondered. He somehow felt that he had overlooked some detail.</p>

    <p>Should he give his cute little <em>shifu </em>a call to ask?</p>
