  <h1>Chapter 516 How Many Other Undisclosed Inventions Does Wang Ming Have? </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Of course, this was just one-sided speculation on Wang Ming's part, and there was no proof to back it up yet.</p>

    <p>But scientists nowadays liked to use data in their presentations, and theoretical science was also a type of science in itself; moreover, Wang Ming's theories were in fact usually very accurate.</p>

    <p>This primordial qi had been in Wang Ling's body since he was a kid. He only knew what this thing was called, and didn't know what it was, exactly.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, there was another important point: If Wang Ming's theory was correct, and a cultivator had to reach a certain level before their bodies started to produce primordial qi, then it didn't really fit Wang Ling's current situation. This was the only thing he could think of at the moment that contradicted Wang Ming's view.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was indeed very powerful, but his true realm in fact wasn't necessarily as high as Immortal Zhenyuan's... based on the shorter time it took now for his realm to rise, Wang Ling roughly calculated he would only reach Venerated Immortal level in the later half of this year at the quickest.</p>

    <p>Unlike when he had been younger and his realm had automatically advanced every two years, his current situation had long changed, with the intervals between realm stages getting shorter.</p>

    <p>So from the very beginning, Wang Ling had in fact thought that it was impossible to explain his current situation simply with science. Most of the time, he didn't even care how high his realm was. In any case, there was no one in the world right now who could survive one slap from him unscathed...</p>

    <p>Last time, even with the Dao talisman seal on his arm, he had smacked Evil Sword God half to death.</p>

    <p>At that time, Wang Ling had thought that with the Dao talisman seal on, he and Evil Sword God would at least be evenly matched.</p>

    <p>Of course, Wang Ming being who he was, he would have naturally considered whatever Wang Ling could think of.</p>

    <p>"Perhaps your situation is inconsistent with my current theory..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming rubbed his head and laughed. "In fact, I think I'm talking nonsense! How can I apply regular theoretical knowledge to your situation! My analysis just now is that after cultivators reach a certain realm, they can rely on their physical bodies to gather energy... In fact, you're different because you were fully automated since you were born!"</p>

    <p>" <em>Pu </em>!" Er Ha couldn't help laughing.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was speechless. "..."</p>

    <p>But he had to admit that Wang Ming's description was quite vivid.</p>

    <p>"But it's all right. The best, naturally, would be if we could collect some of that energy source for comparison. Maybe this thing isn't primordial qi, or it's an unknown form of energy that's just similar to your primordial qi." At this point, Wang Ming activated artificial spirit energy once again and took out a purple black round vessel from the ring.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "What's this?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "An energy collector which hasn't been made public yet. I made it yesterday."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "How many other undisclosed inventions do you still have..."</p>

    <p>Previously there was the thermal toilet, just now was the smart cleaning tissue, and now an energy collector...</p>

    <p>"I invented a lot, but applying for patents is troublesome, so it's just for personal use. Anyway, my identity is a secret, and even if they were made public, it would officially be under the Academy of Science. What a loss that would be!" Wang Ming spread his hands. "Also, if they were really made public, that green-eyed bunch would start badmouthing me behind my back again!"</p>

    <p>"Mm." Wang Ling nodded as he agreed with Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>Given Wang Ming's character, he had been unable to resist showing off in WeChat Moments in the past whenever he had invented something new. In the past few months, however, he had appeared a lot more subdued... Wang Ling felt that this could probably be credited to Zhai Yin's "training."</p>

    <p>"There have actually been quite a few designs, but this is the latest one; it'll be able to store the unknown energy at those coordinates. This energy collector contains data on all known forms of energy, so it won't absorb those. In the case of multiple forms of unknown energy, the collector will be able to separate them inside."</p>

    <p>"Awesome, big bro!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha couldn't resist clapping its paws. "But how do you use this thing?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "Have you ever played Pokemon? Just use it like you would a Pokeball."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>"You want to go yourself?" Wang Ling lifted an eyebrow as he asked telepathically.</p>

    <p>"How can I go myself... do you think I'm an idiot?!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming immediately waved his hands. "I indeed may have dreams of being a hero sometimes, but not to the point of courting death. The link between the Gate Between Worlds and the demon world is probably a chaotic space, right? If I go in, I'll immediately break down into Pop Rocks!"</p>

    <p>As he spoke, Wang Ming slipped the round collector into Wang Ling's hand. "This is something you'll have to do."</p>

    <p>"How long?" asked Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>When he opened his mouth, Er Ha was nearly frightened to death.</p>

    <p>What the hell! Little Master Ling actually spoke!</p>

    <p>"The sooner the better, of course!"</p>

    <p>Sitting on the bed with narrowed eyes and his arms folded, Wang Ming smiled at Wang Ling. "Actually, my main reason for coming this time was to hurry up and get this thing!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming had actually been very excited ever since he had detected this energy which could plausibly be Wang Ling's primordial qi. After years of research without any progress, he had now found a lead at long last. It was the kind of thrill that only a scientist would understand.</p>

    <p>Besides, there was actually another important point.</p>

    <p>Given the more frequent trips out which Wang Ming had been making recently, the people in the research institute now had something on him. A lot of them were now smarter, and rather than report him to Old Qi, they sent their reports directly to Jinghua city.</p>

    <p>President Qi hence suggested that Wang Ming stop going out for a while, and Wang Ming had agreed for the sake of the overall situation.</p>

    <p>He thus wouldn't be leaving the institute in the near future, so Wang Ming wanted to take advantage of the opportunity today to finish this matter.</p>

    <p>"Okay, give me half an hour." Wang Ling nodded.</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Er Ha was taken aback once again.</p>

    <p>Damn! Little Master Ling had actually said a second sentence today!</p>

    <p>Er Ha had a vague feeling that Wang Ling was going to break a record today!</p>

    <p>But very quickly, Er Ha started muttering in its heart.</p>

    <p>Half an hour?</p>

    <p>Wasn't that space in the transmission link between the Gate Between Worlds and the demon world...?</p>

    <p>Without the Gate, how was Wang Ling going to get there?</p>

    <p>Seeing Wang Ling rise from his chair, Er Ha jumped off the desk.</p>

    <p>One person and one dog went straight to the bedroom's ensuite.</p>

    <p>At that point, Er Ha finally reacted... They had Lord Ma! Toilet Lord Ma!</p>

    <p>They had used Lord Ma before to flush away two cultivators hired by Mo Immortal Castle who had tried to spy on the Wang family - who knew what space Lord Ma had flushed them away to.</p>

    <p>"Lord Ma... has a transportation ability?" Er Ha was completely stupefied.</p>

    <p>"You've been here for so long, you don't know?" Shrugging with the air of someone used to the unexpected, Wang Ming said, "If a space hasn't been specified, you'll be flushed out into some random place. If you specify a space, you can go anywhere. When you want to come back, just stamp your foot three times!"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Er Ha suddenly had a small thought.</p>

    <p>It had in fact been looking for a way to enter the Gate Between Worlds. During this time, It had been painstakingly saving money to buy materials for setting up a teleportation array to return to its original clan. Only the generations of leaders of the Tuntian Ha clan knew about this array. However, trying to set up this teleportation array by just relying on the ten thousand HNY or so which it had swindled from Xiao Yin was actually far, far from enough...</p>

    <p>At that very moment, Er Ha stared at the toilet with a huge sense of relief.</p>

    <p>â€” It realized it could save money!</p>
