  <h1>Chapter 919 Earth Crisis</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When Guo Ping said this, Wang Ling suddenly recalled a period of time six years ago when Wang Ming dropped by the villa particularly often, and would always run off to the toilet when he was free. Looking at it now, it was likely that Wang Ming had gone to the bathroom to collect Wang Ling's hair... Wang Ling washed his hair every day. In addition to showering every night, he would wash his hair in the sink every morning.</p>

    <p>Because he washed his hair so diligently, he would always drop one or two strands of hair... Listening to Guo Ping suddenly mention this, Wang Ling was now finally aware of his dumbass brother's secret and impure motive back then.</p>

    <p>Actually, Wang Ling had felt a long time ago that Wang Ming had seemed a little sneaky during that period, and he had thought that Wang Ming was after his crispy noodle snacks. But each time Wang Ming found an excuse to use the toilet in Wang Ling's ensuite, Wang Ling's crispy noodle snack supply had never dwindled, so Wang Ling stopped being so suspicious over time... Who the hell would have thought that his dumbass older brother's target turned out to be the hair Wang Ling dropped when he washed it...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling couldn't imagine this guy hunched over the bathroom drain, pulling out hair with a metal hook - who knew how vulgar his expression must have been when he was doing it! In fact, what Wang Ling didn't know was that Wang Ming had used the extra hair he had taken out for a figurine, which was locked away in a safe in his research office.</p>

    <p>This was a Wang Ling version of the Barbie doll, whose hair was made from the strands Wang Ming had carefully collected.</p>

    <p>If this "Barbie doll" was used as an energy source, it would fuel power consumption for hundreds of millions of light years in space at the very least...</p>

    <p>"Then were you the one who summoned us?"</p>

    <p>"I don't have that ability - it was Star Lord of Divine Dao Star. His plan is to confine the most powerful person on Earth on Divine Dao Star, and then launch his plan to engulf the Earth." Saying this, Guo Ping's gaze swept over everyone. He knew that the legendary strongest person on Earth was in this group, and that the rest of them had been dragged into it.</p>

    <p><em>Sure enough, this problem is because of me again, isn't it? </em>... Wang Ling let out a sigh.</p>

    <p>As he pondered this, Wang Ling saw Guo Ping turn to look at Bai Qiao. "Young lady, are you the legendary strongest person on Earth?"</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao darted a look at Wang Ling out of the corner of her eye, thought for a bit, then nodded her head. "That's right! It's me!" She didn't reveal the truth, not because she was afraid of Wang Ling's strength.</p>

    <p>Miss Bai Qiao wasn't like those coquettish skanks who "followed their hearts."</p>

    <p>In contrast, Bai Qiao was more pragmatic - she was thinking that Wang Ling was her boss, so it didn't hurt for her to carry the wok for a bit...</p>

    <p>"So, what on earth is this plan to engulf the Earth?" Bai Qiao asked, folding her arms.</p>

    <p>"This has to do with the origins of Divine Dao Star... Including the time I drifted or was moored in space, it took me nearly a year to get to Divine Dao Star, and another one after that to learn the basics of the Divine Dao language used on this planet."</p>

    <p>Sorting out his thoughts, Guo Ping said, "I call the unusual energy used on Divine Dao Star godly power. This is a special energy source which expands by devouring other sources of energy. Over the years, Divine Dao Star's Star Lord has used his power to devour many inhabited planets, draining their energy sources to nothing in order to strengthen his own self. He wants to make Divine Dao Star the strongest in the entire universe, and this time, Star Lord's newest target is Earth..."</p>

    <p>"Bat- Battle of Balls?" Chen Chao suddenly thought of a phone game.</p>

    <p>"You can think of it that way," Guo Ping said; he had heard of this game.</p>

    <p>Back then, he had drifted through space before arriving on Divine Dao Star, and had been further stymied because of the language barrier.</p>

    <p>A lot of people thought he was dead...</p>

    <p>But though Guo Ping hadn't been on Earth all these years, he still received the latest news and scientific intelligence via the data terminal in the lab.</p>

    <p>Alone on an alien planet, he led a very cautious life. The culture, the language, and the way of life were all completely new to him. For Guo Ping, a stranger from Earth, this was simply like being in prison. If a person who had been in "prison" for a long time didn't understand what was going on in the outside world and couldn't integrate back into society after he got out, he would go crazy!</p>

    <p>"Young lady."</p>

    <p>At that moment, Guo Ping looked at Bai Qiao. "If we want to save the Earth, the only thing we can do now is to negotiate with Star Lord - we don't have much time left."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean? Divine Dao Star is so far away from Earth and also so huge - even if he wanted to go over to engulf the Earth, it won't be so easy," Fang Xing said.</p>

    <p>"No... Divine Dao Star's clone is already in the Earth's core..."</p>

    <p>"What?"</p>

    <p>"It's like magnets being pulled together," Guo Ping said. "Divine Dao Star's clone resonates with the main star's godly power. According to my calculations, as long as the clone can draw out half of the main star's godly power and expand, it'll be able to swallow up the entire Earth inch by inch from the inside..."</p>

    <p>"You said to negotiate - how? Surrender in exchange for immunity? Or is there any other way?" said Bai Qiao. "Oh, right, my surname's Bai, I'm called Bai Qiao."</p>

    <p>"There is another way."</p>

    <p>Guo Ping said, "Currently, there are two ways to deal with this. First: figure out the formula for converting godly power into spirit power, and ultimately convert spirit power into spirit qi by using our specialized equipment. This way, we can supplement the spirit qi on Earth and solve the issue of lack of spirit qi in the future. But there are two problems with this plan: I've only just calculated one-tenth of the formula, and the equipment I need is still on Earth..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Second, after negotiating with Star Lord to surrender and secure immunity, we find a way for the two stars to peacefully coexist as much as possible. But I cannot be the one to make this agreement. Furthermore, this Star Lord wouldn't want to negotiate with a nobody like me. However, if Miss Bai comes forward, we might have a chance..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"There are only two ways?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, only two..." Guo Ping sighed. "I have witnessed the might of Divine Dao Star's Star Lord with my own eyes. His strength isn't in the same dimension as that of the people of Earth or the Domain of the Gods... We are no more than ants to Star Lord."</p>

    <p>"Not necessarily. There may be a third way." Just then, Fang Xing and Bai Qiao both raised their heads and spoke in unison.</p>

    <p>"A third way? What is it?" Guo Ping was blank for a moment.</p>

    <p>"Beat him up."</p>

    <p>At that moment, a voice sounded in Guo Ping's head.</p>

    <p>He then saw the youngster with the dead fish eyes, who had been standing at the back of the group this whole time, look up at him.</p>

    <p>Beat up Star Lord...</p>

    <p>Was this youngster talking to him?</p>
