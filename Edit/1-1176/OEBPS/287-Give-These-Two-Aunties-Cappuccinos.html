  <h1>Chapter 287 Give These Two Aunties Cappuccinos! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Lord Diulei thought that these two female cultivators were very bizarre, so he took out his cellphone to take a couple of photos. When the phone camera flashed, they turned pale with fright. The one with celebrity looks immediately covered her face. "What... what kind of dark weapon is this?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was flabbergasted. Although there were still plenty of old seniors nowadays who clung stubbornly to tradition and didn't use modern technology, it wasn't to the point that they didn't even know what a cellphone was.</p>

    <p>He simply flipped his phone around and showed them the picture he had just taken.</p>

    <p>The female cultivator with the celebrity face was stunned when she saw her countenance. "What magic treasure is this? It can actually preserve an image..."</p>

    <p>Next to her, the female cultivator with the oval face also looked stunned. "Sister Beauty, look! Your skin looks much fairer in this magic treasure! Does it have the ability to retain youth?"</p>

    <p>Her question made Wang Ling and Lord Diulei speechless. "..." This was just the phone's built-in skin enhancement function.</p>

    <p>It was just a cellphone, but these two female cultivators were transfixed by it for a long while.</p>

    <p>After two minutes, the one with the oval face whispered, "Sister Beauty, is this the magic treasure they call modern technology?"</p>

    <p>"It should be!" The female cultivator with the celebrity face nodded her head very seriously.</p>

    <p>"Are you really from Immortal Mansion's top level?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was beginning to doubt their identities; even if they were powerful, it was unnatural for them to be ignorant of modern technology to this extent. How long had it been since the world had already entered the Spirit Energy Information era?</p>

    <p>"We were sent here when we were young, and have never stepped outside before. This is also our sect's rule, that inner sect disciples must sever all ties with the outside world. We only learned about technology when people from the outer sect came to headquarters to report on the situation," replied the female cultivator with the oval face.</p>

    <p>It was a short explanation, but in truth, there was a long story behind it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Lord Diulei and the others would later find out that Immortal Mansion selected innately talented girls, in the same way that child brides were chosen, to join the inner sect, and parents would formally sign guardianship over to Immortal Mansion.</p>

    <p>These disciples had to recite scriptures as designated by Immortal Mansion every day; if they were unable to do so, they would be flogged with a dragon whip as punishment. Apart from that, they also received special cultivation training. Every year, there were people who died during Immortal Mansion's training; only those who survived could truly become inner sect disciples.</p>

    <p>The difference between Immortal Mansion's inner and outer sect disciples was that the former didn't need to cultivate the Panwu Immortal Martial Arts, but at the same time, they had no access to outside technology. Furthermore, the main thing about Immortal Mansion's inner sect disciples was that they were all female.</p>

    <p>At that moment, for these two female disciples who were like villagers who had just gotten Internet access, the phone was proving to be a large temptation, and to them was no less than a first-class magic treasure.</p>

    <p>"If I give this phone to you, can you help us sneak in?" Lord Diulei asked as he grinned his hallmark smile, full of white teeth.</p>

    <p>"Are you joking?"</p>

    <p>The female cultivator with the celebrity face hmphed. "If I kill you, then everything you're carrying will belong to us."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei still had his smile on. "No room for discussion?"</p>

    <p>"No!" The two cultivators waved their hands.</p>

    <p>"Alright..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei sighed, then turned his head toward Wang Ling. "Brother Ling, give these two aunties cappuccinos<sup>1</sup>!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Chinese online user Lu Benwei once played Chinese poker in a live stream against a girl whom he called auntie. Thinking he was about to win, he was so happy that he said he would "give this auntie a cappuccino". In the end, however, he lost the game, &amp; online users turned his words into a meme)</dfn>

    <p>"Who are you calling aunties?!" The two female cultivators were furious.</p>

    <p>In the next moment, they were about to rush at them.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately for them, Wang Ling was the first to make a move before they could draw near.</p>

    <p>This was followed by the sound of two dull thuds, "peng peng."</p>

    <p>In an instant, Wang Ling had punched the two female cultivators with his friendly face-breaking fist. They fell to the ground, bleeding from their seven orifices and their faces turned into pumpkins.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling blew the smoke from his fist and sighed in his heart: Too weak!"Ai~ did you have to go that far?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei crouched down to check their breathing. After discovering that they were still alive, he breathed a sigh of relief. "Lucky..."</p>

    <p>Although they hadn't exchanged many words, he felt that these inner sect disciples of Immortal Mansion were all victims themselves. For them to have been sent here at a young age and trained to be killing machines... to be able to survive all that really wouldn't have been easy.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, every debt had its debtor; he who had given rise to this doomed fate had to end it.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei asked, "Brother Ling, can you read their memories to pinpoint the Master of Immortal Mansion's location?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling shook his head. He had already tried earlier on, but hadn't been able to uncover any useful clues. Although these two were inner sect disciples of Immortal Mansion, their positions were still too low.</p>

    <p>Jingke's aura had disappeared shortly after Wang Ling had discovered Sanyuan Road, so he assumed that the Master of Immortal Mansion had likely used some method or magic treasure to hide Jingke's aura.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't think it would be strange if the Master of Immortal Mansion had taken out some prehistoric magic weapon this late in the game.</p>

    <p>After all, he had viewed this person as a very troublesome enemy since the beginning.</p>

    <p>"Looks like we have to think of a way to sneak in and look for someone with a higher rank." Lord Diulei rubbed his jaw as he turned the thoughts over in his mind.</p>

    <p>When he looked at the two female cultivators on the ground, his eyes suddenly lit up.</p>

    <p>His expression gave Wang Ling a bad feeling.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, come help me!" Lord Diulei dragged the two girls into the palace. This was Sister Beauty and Sister Discount's private palace, and there was no one else here apart from them.</p>

    <p>A moment later, Wang Ling saw Lord Diulei bow to the two female cultivators lying on the ground. "Forgive me, fellow Taoists!"</p>

    <p>Then, he started to take off their clothes.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's astonishment was indescribable. In broad daylight, the grand Great Death-Courting Senior of the cultivation world was actually attempting to take advantage of two women... Had he eaten too much broccoli, and now wanted to start eating meat again?</p>

    <p>Unraveling one of the female cultivator's sash, Lord Diulei felt Wang Ling's burning hot glare. He raised his head and sighed. "Brother Ling, you've known me for so long, am I the type of person to take advantage of other people?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>After untying the sash, it was as if Lord Diulei had discovered a brand new world. "This is my first time seeing the female version of the Taoist robe â€” even the dudou<sup>2</sup> is attached to it... Brother Ling, do you know how to take it off?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(The traditional Chinese form of the bodice)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling sunk into silence. "..."</p>

    <p>After a full five minutes of examination, the young man in white finally figured out the internal structure of this women's Taoist robe. He had never expected that the straps of the dudou would be attached with a talisman, and only the female cultivators could undo them with their own fingers.</p>

    <p>It took Lord Diulei a long time to arrange their limp bodies in position before he could turn their hands over to undo their clothes.</p>

    <p>"Success!"</p>

    <p>The young man removed one set of the Taoist robes as if it was precious treasure.</p>

    <p>Then, he directly flung them at Wang Ling. "Brother Ling, take this! It's for you!"</p>

    <p>After saying that, he started to take off the other female cultivator's clothes.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "???"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Don't just stand there, hurry up and put it on! We'll use women's clothes to sneak in!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
