  <h1>Chapter 1080 The Second Semester of Senior Grade One</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The workload was heavier in the second semester of Senior Grade One, and after the summer break, the school administration board organized a meeting for all the teachers in order to emphasize that their main task right now was to quickly get the students to refocus after a relaxing summer break and get back into the race toward the college entrance exam.</p>

    <p>There were still two years to go from Grade One to Grade Three, but based on the frequency of chapter updates and the number of chapters, it would take the author over three thousand more chapters to reach the college entrance exam arc... But even then! Studying was still the most important!</p>

    <p>The second half of Senior Grade One already wasn't easy, since most schools would have their students finish learning Senior Grade Two content during this time, and in Grade Two, get them to finish learning Grade Three coursework.</p>

    <p>When they entered Grade Three, they would keep doing the same thing non-stop - they would continue to do the school exercises over and over again until they almost died.</p>

    <p>That was Grade Three!</p>

    <p>Apart from doing exercise questions, Grade Three cultivation school students had to take cultivation assessments at the same time, such as a spirit sword control exam, magic treasure operation exam, pill refining exam, talisman drawing exam and so on.</p>

    <p>After Teacher Pan was done with her lecture, Su Xiao started handing out booklets from the pile in his arms, which he had gotten from the office.</p>

    <p>"What's this?" someone asked.</p>

    <p>"Last year's enrollment regulations for the cultivation colleges," replied Su Xiao.</p>

    <p>"Why are you handing these out?"</p>

    <p>"Old Pan wants all of you to look at the cut-off scores for the top cultivation colleges," said Su Xiao.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling turned to the first page.</p>

    <p>A detailed table leapt to his eye â€” this table listed the minimum cut-off scores and the corresponding page number for each school's enrollment regulations.</p>

    <p>Currently, the number one cultivation college was Jinghua Seven Stars College; minimum cut-off score: 209,300.</p>

    <p>Second was Jinghua Sword Immortal Star College; minimum cut-off score: 199,670.</p>

    <p>Third was Northern Swallow College; minimum cut-off score: 199,400.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The top three colleges had a minimum cut-off score of around 200,000, which would make anyone flinch. Wang Ling thought he could enter these three colleges easily enough if he performed normally and wasn't suppressing his scores... but this would be violating the Wang family's rules.</p>

    <p>It wasn't up to Wang Ling which college he got into anyway - ultimately, it was Father Wang and Mother Wang who would make the decision. Actually, Wang Ling himself didn't have any idea one way or the other. Of this dazzling array of cultivation colleges, there were practically none that could truly teach him anything new.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had also imagined what college life would be like. Just like the college entrance exam, this was an important milestone in a person's life. While it wasn't necessary, it might become a lifelong regret for Wang Ling if he didn't go.</p>

    <p>On the side, Super and a few others were looking at the enrollment regulations and discussing them.</p>

    <p>"Chinese, maths, English, physics, chemistry, plus general arts and general science; each subject is worth 20,000 marks, so the total score for the cultural courses is 140,000. Talismans, sword techniques, magic treasures, pills, theory of cultivation history; these cultivation subjects are worth 120,000 marks in total, so the full mark is 260,000. What score do you think we can get right now?" Guo Hao stared at the enrollment regulations in his hand, and couldn't help sinking into deep anxiety and thought.</p>

    <p>"At my current level... I can get 150,000 at most, which is only just enough for a second-tier college. I need to work harder." Chen Chao sighed. Actually, when school started at the very beginning, he had already voiced his ambition to get into Seven Stars.</p>

    <p>However, he was still short of the target cut-off score by 50,000 marks. To close this gap, not only did he have to pull up his scores in his cultural subjects as much as possible, he also couldn't fall behind in all his cultivation subjects.</p>

    <p>Getting 100,000 out of 120,000 marks in the cultivation subjects would be a safe bet for enrollment.</p>

    <p>But getting this 100,000 was easier said than done.</p>

    <p>"Ai, I remember there were bonus points in previous years?"</p>

    <p>"There were bonus points, but the requirements were also very strict. Look at the back of the enrollment booklet," said Su Xiao.</p>

    <p>Everyone flipped to the back; sure enough, it clearly explained the conditions for the bonus points.</p>

    <p>[First: A person who assists the Cultivation Police Bureau or the Immortal Arts Mobile Squadron while in high school, and obtains an Honorary Cultivator's Medal for helping to uphold law and order, can obtain bonus points. A third-rank medal is worth 1000 points, a second-rank medal is worth 3000 points, and a first-rank medal is worth 5000 points. A person can only have five medals at most at any one time.]</p>

    <p>"I know this first condition; I think my dad got 1000 bonus points before because of it," said Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>"What did your dad do?"</p>

    <p>"When he was grocery shopping, he happened to catch a criminal on the run, and so got a third-rank medal." Chen Chao laughed. "But my dad was lucky - that criminal was already out of strength from the chase, and just happened to run into the market. He was easy pickings for my dad."</p>

    <p>"Come on, stop talking about your dad - let's read the next one..." said Guo Hao.</p>

    <p>[Second: A person who obtains a special national certificate of honor while in high school can obtain 10,000 bonus points after an audit.]</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>"Next, next... That's so hard!" someone cried out in disbelief.</p>

    <p>A special certificate of honor was something that they could only dream of, and was completely impossible to get. The probability of obtaining such a thing was even lower than a person's looks in real life matching the photo sent to an online friend...</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi and Zhenyuan were lost in silence when they gazed at these conditions.</p>

    <p>Frankly, people as old as they were shouldn't be messing around here. In the end, however, they had come in order to learn from Wang Ling. Since Wang Ling would be taking the college entrance exam, they definitely couldn't avoid it. Given their strength, it wasn't hard for them to get full marks.</p>

    <p>But the main point was that they wanted to go to the same college as Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>Then, they now faced the problem of keeping their grades down.</p>

    <p>These senior high cultivation subjects were really too easy for them.</p>

    <p>"How about just not taking the exam and getting points through certificates? That seems easier to control than grades..." Gu Shunzhi and Zhenyuan cupped their chins and thought the same thing at that moment.</p>

    <p>Finally, everyone looked at the third and final condition for getting bonus points.</p>

    <p>[Third: A person who breaks through the Foundation Establishment stage while in high school can obtain bonus points. Golden Core stage: 10,000 points.]</p>

    <p>[Those who reach the Nascent Soul stage do not have to take the college entrance exam. They can select the college they want and directly enter after obtaining approval from the General Administration of 100 Schools.]</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>"Is there anyone who has ever broken through to the Nascent Soul stage in high school?" Everyone looked at the table and then at each other in dismay.</p>

    <p>"Impossible... If there really was such a genius, why bother studying in high school..."</p>

    <p>"There definitely are people like that - it's just our worldview that's too narrow, and we don't understand these geniuses." At that moment, Chen Chao suddenly said, "I sometimes wonder if there's someone like that around us - big shots with ordinary identities who quietly hide in the crowd..."</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan: "..."</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
