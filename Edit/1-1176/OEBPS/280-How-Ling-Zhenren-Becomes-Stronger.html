  <h1>Chapter 280 How Ling Zhenren Becomes Stronger! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>In fact, even Wang Ling wasn't clear when this doomed fate had befallen him.</p>

    <p>Of course... if he had been able to tell, then it couldn't be called doomed fate.</p>

    <p>But now that he was silently eating the crispy noodle snack, Wang Ling was well aware that this doomed fate had already started to deepen...</p>

    <p>Finishing off the crispy noodle snack, a young man in white sucked his fingers and couldn't stop singing praises. "Brother Fang Xing, your crispy noodle snack is good!"</p>

    <p>In the front rows, Dharmaraja, Immortal Toya, Luo Chuang and Cailian Zhenren all nodded and agreed. "Indeed, after eating it, my body feels like it's full of spirit energy."</p>

    <p>"Brother Fang Xing, your crispy noodle snack also contains a lot of spirit herbs?" Immortal Toya savored the taste. "This small crispy noodle snack packet contains hundreds of spirit herbs. It's very difficult to neutralize all their smells in favor of preserving the snack's flavor."</p>

    <p>"Senior, you flatter me." Fang Xing smiled. "I just applied what I learned in school in our family's noodles shop. These instant noodles, including the crispy noodle snack, are new products researched and developed by our family's noodles shop, and aren't officially on the market yet."</p>

    <p>"Ha ha, then aren't we the first batch to eat crabs <sup>1</sup> ?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A phrase that just basically
means the first to do
something ..)</dfn>

    <p>As Dharmaraja laughed like a two hundred- jin kid, he directly turned his head to look at Wang Ling. "Speaking of which, Ling Zhenren, what do you think?"</p>

    <p>Everyone knew that the only thing Ling Zhenren was crazy about was crispy noodle snacks, so there was probably no one here better than Wang Ling to comment on it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought this was a simple question.</p>

    <p>However, it made him sink into silence for a long time...</p>

    <p>For some reason, any simple question inexplicably became a prickly issue as soon as Fang Xing was involved.</p>

    <p>It wasn't that Wang Ling hated him; he just thought that this guy... was very troublesome.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought at first that he could avoid answering Dharmaraja's question to maintain his aloof image, but there was a saying which put it well: tit for tat... Since Wang Ling had eaten the snack, he thought that a slight nod wasn't asking for much.</p>

    <p>And so, after about two minutes of silence...</p>

    <p>He stared at this sparkling packaging and nodded.</p>

    <p>At this scene, Lord Diulei clicked his tongue. "Brother Ling seldom praises other people. Brother Fang Xing, your product will definitely sell like hot cakes!"</p>

    <p>"If Classmate Wang Ling likes it, that's great." Fang Xing grinned his trademark bright smile. His gaze was a little hot when he turned to Wang Ling, but Wang Ling had already turned to look at the passing scenery outside the window.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After that, the carriage fell into a short lull. This time, they were on their way to Winter city to drop in on Immortal Mansion and wipe them out. This was actually a secret, so when they had set out, Lord Diulei had stressed that no one was to bring it up, in case the walls had ears.</p>

    <p>Since Immortal Mansion was able to gain a foothold in Winter city despite the military troops stationed there, there had to be a staggering number of spies working in the shadows.</p>

    <p>Apart from when he was receiving customers, Luo Chuang was a taciturn person. Toya Immortal was even more of an ascetic; as an alchemist, there were times when he would sit in front of his furnace for several days and nights. For this elegant-looking man in traditional dress, three hours by train to Winter city would pass in a blink of an eye.</p>

    <p>Seeing that everyone had dropped the subject, Cailian Zhenren straightaway started knitting a scarf in the carriage.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had heard Lord Diulei say before that this scarf was for her new boyfriend...</p>

    <p>And so, this journey was agony for Dharmaraja.</p>

    <p>When he couldn't take it anymore, he decided to stir up things with a bit of gossip. "By the way, how do Lord Diulei and Brother Fang Xing know each other? Senior Immortal, you only mentioned earlier that you met Brother Fang Xing on assignment?"</p>

    <p>Although Lord Diulei had introduced Fang Xing to them, most of the people from the chat group had no idea about his past. Dharmaraja's question was something that Cailian Zhenren and Luo Chuang also wondered about.</p>

    <p>Moreover, what they were even more curious about was Fang Xing's strength. Judging from his current aura, he was powerful, and was even above the average level of the people present.</p>

    <p>"...Actually, I wasn't going to mention it because it involves Brother Fang Xing's privacy. But he especially told me that I could explain it if someone did ask."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei crossed his legs as he prepared to launch into gossip, but silently uncrossed them again when he realized that they weren't as long as Fang Xing's. "To be precise, I came to know Brother Fang Xing three years ago when he had still been studying in Jinghua city.</p>

    <p>"Student Fang had been adopted by the Fang couple at a very young age. Because his results were very good, Tianshi Imperial High School made an exception for him and took him in. Do you still remember that girl whose family had all been massacred three years ago? I accepted a one yuan coin from her and helped her get revenge by directly slaughtering that evil bunch. That actually happened not far from Tianshi Imperial High School."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei recalled the matter. "It was during that incident when I bumped into Brother Fang Xing. It was already dark by the time I was done, and someone had called the police. Before they arrived, it was Brother Fang Xing who helped me deal with the aftermath and get rid of the bodies."</p>

    <p>Everyone had heard of that incident back then. This Great Death-Courting Senior had accepted a one yuan coin from a little girl as payment for wiping out all the underground forces in Jinghua city â€” news of this had spread like wildfire in the cultivation circle back then.</p>

    <p>But no one had imagined that Fang Xing would actually have been involved.</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja was satisfied with this gossip. "So it's like that... but when Senior Immortal said that, I seem to remember reading a related article in a tabloid somewhere that it wasn't just Senior Immortal, but that there had also been a girl who had joined you in killing that evil bunch in Jinghua city."</p>

    <p>"That's probably just a coincidence." Lord Diulei laughed. "I was very secretive about the operation. If I hadn't pulled Brother Fang Xing into it, most likely no one would have known about it. As for that tabloid article, it was probably just trying to draw public attention."</p>

    <p>"Maybe."</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja nodded doubtfully, then turned his gaze to Wang Ling. "Ling Zhenren, what do you think?"</p>

    <p>After that, Lord Diulei promptly covered his mouth and put a finger to his lips as he whispered, "Under no circumstances do you disturb Ling Zhenren when he's studying, it's taboo..."</p>

    <p>Everyone looked over and were stupefied to realize that while they had been discussing Fang Xing's origin, Ling Zhenren had actually been immersed in doing the exercises in the On Talismans book in his hands...</p>

    <p>Could it be... this was Ling Zhenren's special method for becoming stronger?!</p>
