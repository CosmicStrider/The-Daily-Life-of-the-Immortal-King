  <h1>Chapter 701 General Yi's Boundless Dao</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Finally angry?"</p>

    <p>Looking at General Yi who seemed to have become another person, the head of state smiled.</p>

    <p>It was rare to see General Yi in this state. As far as the head of state could remember, except for when they had fought the seven demon gods back then with all their might, he had rarely seen General Yi activate this form.</p>

    <p>"What mode is this?" Father Wang was very curious.</p>

    <p>"This is when Little Yiyi's potential is activated. Simply put, this is a method for activating the meridians in the body with boundless sword qi to stimulate the body's potential, and it carries certain risks..." The head of state said, "Back then, it was Sword Immortal Fan Rui who developed this Boundless Sword Dao, but Little Yiyi was the only one to inherit it."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, realization dawned on Father Wang.</p>

    <p>He also knew about Evil Sword God's arrest previously. If that was the case, then Evil Sword God had very likely murdered his <em>shifu </em>back then because of jealousy.</p>

    <p>The head of state's next words also confirmed Father Wang's speculation. "Brother Situ has probably heard that Fan Rui had two disciples. One was Little Yiyi, and the other was Chen Nanxuan, who is now known as Evil Sword God. Fan Rui was of two minds when selecting the successor to the Boundless Sword Dao; he even came to me for advice."</p>

    <p>"The head of state and Sword Immortal knew each other?"</p>

    <p>"We were fellow students." The head of state nodded and said, "In retaliation for Fan Rui passing the Boundless Sword Dao on to Little Yiyi, Chen Nanxuan plotted the murder of his <em>shifu </em>. But the truth was that Fan Rui had already long been aware of it. Fan Rui had always been a cautious person, so he wouldn't be caught unawares so easily."</p>

    <p>"So Sword Immortal is still alive?" Father Wang remembered once searching the news on Evil Sword God out of curiosity, and amidst the numerous comments online, there was in fact information going around which said that Fan Rui wasn't really dead.</p>

    <p>But these online views were just speculation after all, and had no proof to back them up.</p>

    <p>"Fan Rui indeed has already passed on." At this moment, the head of state revealed the truth of what happened back then. "But unlike what the rumors say, he didn't die because he couldn't defeat Chen Nanxuan. The truth is that during that battle, Fan Rui deliberately yielded, which allowed Chen Nanxuan to seize the advantage. Chen Nanxuan naively thought that his sword skills had surpassed his <em>shifu's </em>, when they actually hadn't..."</p>

    <p>When Father Wang heard this, he couldn't help clicking his tongue.</p>

    <p>No wonder Evil Sword God had been so endlessly haughty all these years, looking for people everywhere to PK with; it appeared that he had a gross misunderstanding of how strong he was.</p>

    <p>No wonder he got thrashed by Ling Ling...</p>

    <p>Father Wang couldn't help sighing. "Did Sword Immortal do this in order to guide him?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, Brother Situ is right." The head of state said non-committedly, "After Fan Rui chose the sole successor of the Boundless Sword Dao from among the two of them back then, Chen Nanxuan harbored a grudge ever since. But Fan Rui always believed that Chen Nanxuan wasn't bad by nature. He wanted to use his death to guide this disciple toward the right path, but what a pity... Chen Nanxuan still took this type of path in the end."</p>

    <p>"Then, does Your Excellency know why Sword Immortal chose General Yi as the successor of the Boundless Sword Dao? On what specific basis?"</p>

    <p>"I truly don't know."</p>

    <p>The head of state tsked. He really wasn't clear about this matter. "I asked Little Yiyi before privately, but he said this had to do with the secret of the Boundless Sword Dao, so it wasn't good for me to ask too much. But one thing's for sure: when Fan Rui picked his successor, the final stipulation had nothing to do with sword skills or overall combat ability. Back then, Little Yiyi and Chen Nanxuan had been almost neck to neck in their sword skills."</p>

    <p>Listening to the head of state, Father Wang raised his eyebrows and felt that this was becoming more interesting.</p>

    <p>If it wasn't based on sword skills or combat ability, then what was it based on?</p>

    <p>On who had more cheek?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At that very moment, Blademaster General Yi's aura seemed to undergo a one hundred and eighty-degree turn after he entered Boundless mode.</p>

    <p>He clenched one fist. "Boundless Sword Qi Rush!"</p>

    <p>The Cold Frost Sword then unexpectedly burst with the golden-red sword qi that was coming off General Yi, as if it was getting a power boost, before it emitted a dazzling cold, azure light!</p>

    <p>The water drops on the sword had already completely disappeared, and its powers of ice and frost were once again on display at that moment.</p>

    <p>"Your Excellency, your spirit field is very strong, but perhaps you don't know how formidable this humble one's boundless sword qi is..." General Yi let go of the Cold Frost Sword as he stood with his hands behind his back, and the sword started to rotate around his body, forming a three- <em>zhang </em>sword circle which firmly enclosed General Yi inside it.</p>

    <p>The Boundless Sword Dao had strengthened the Cold Frost Sword as well as the Cold Frost Armor on General Yi to protect him from the blistering hot environment.</p>

    <p>But this was only the beginning...</p>

    <p>Because General Yi had yet to take out his most powerful sword.</p>

    <p>Father Wang stared intently at the image projected in the air.</p>

    <p>Several dozen seconds later, General Yi spread his palm once more. The entrance to the infinite sword repository opened again in the air, and General Yi took out something unexpected.</p>

    <p>What he took out wasn't a complete magic sword, but a sword hilt!</p>

    <p>"A sword hilt?" Father Wang looked blankly at this scene.</p>

    <p>Next to him, the head of state seemed deeply moved when he saw this sword hilt. "After so many years, I never thought that I would see Little Yiyi take out this magic sword again... truly, how nostalgic."</p>

    <p>"What kind of magic sword is this?" asked Father Wang.</p>

    <p>"People think that Heaven-Cleaving and Brilliant Victory were Sword Immortal Fan Rui's principal swords, but that's not the case. It is this sword hilt that was Fan Rui's biggest treasure, and it was also given to Little Yiyi as an emblem of him inheriting the Boundless Sword Dao. Only those who comprehend Boundless Sword Dao can wield this sword..." The head of state stared at the image and smiled slightly. "If Little Yiyi gets serious, my infinite spirit field truly won't be able to hold him."</p>

    <p>The head of state was very clear on this sword's background, because this was a world-defying magic weapon!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At that moment, General Yi made a move once again.</p>

    <p>With the Cold Frost Sword's protection on him, he grasped this sword hilt with both hands and held it high above his head.</p>

    <p>A few seconds later, Father Wang saw masses of "qi" inside the spirit field stream toward the hilt as they gathered little by little to coalesce into the body of a sword...</p>

    <p>"Brother Situ, this is Little Yiyi's Boundless Sword Dao..."</p>

    <p>The head of state said with a smile, "Boundless Sword Dao is a building technique which uses all qi under heaven. Using sword qi as a foundation, it absorbs other different types of qi and condenses them together. If it's in a place with a lot of people around, even the air we exhale will be collected by Little Yiyi and turned into power. In the end, the power in the water droplets will coalesce into a mighty force as magnificent as a rolling sea, and will turn into the Boundless Sword!"</p>

    <p>"So the name of the sword is Boundless Sword..." Father Wang was enthralled as he listened.</p>

    <p>"No, Boundless Sword is just the name of the blade."</p>

    <p>The head of state corrected him. "With the sword hilt, the name of this sword should be... Qicalibur <sup>1</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The first character of the
name Excalibur in Chinese,
誓约胜利之剑, replaced with
'qi,'气 ..)</dfn>

    <p>Father Wang: "..."</p>
