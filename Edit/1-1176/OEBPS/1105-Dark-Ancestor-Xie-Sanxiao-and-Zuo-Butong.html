  <h1>Chapter 1105 Dark Ancestor Xie Sanxiao and Zuo Butong</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"What do you want me to do..." At that moment, Xia Ming was a little frightened by the fact that he couldn't move at all. His spirit almost couldn't bear the mysterious force that was pressing down on him. It was a torturous feeling, and like this person's name suggested, Xia Ming felt like he was in a nightmare.</p>

    <p>It was very common for people to struggle while they were having a nightmare, and that was what Xia Ming was feeling â€” he just wanted to escape the nightmare as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>After lying in the hospital for a whole day and calming down with much difficulty, Xia Ming's frame of mind was thrown into chaos once again with the appearance of this man called Nightmare.</p>

    <p>"It'll be the national high school body technique exchange meet soon, and it'll be held on the famous Nine Dragon Mountain. Student Xia, you only have one task, which is to look for a chance to climb to the top of the mountain; I'll give you further instructions then," said Nightmare.</p>

    <p>"National? Isn't it held by our district..." Xia Ming was startled.</p>

    <p>"Plans can change. As for the details, Student Xia will find out tomorrow. I hope you'll be there. Of course, to prove that I indeed have the ability to make you stronger, let me first give you a small gift." After the man called Nightmare said that, Xia Ming felt the pressure that was holding him down suddenly ease up; it was like the joy of suddenly being set free after being imprisoned for so long, or the feeling of releasing your piss after holding it in for a long time.</p>

    <p>Very quickly, Xia Ming woke up.</p>

    <p>At that moment, he was amazed to realize that his body no longer hurt...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The man called Nightmare completed his task. He didn't have a specific form, and was just a shadow which moved swiftly and didn't leave any traces behind.</p>

    <p>Nightmare appeared in a completely abandoned factory in Songhai city, and reported to someone standing on the other side of an iron door. "The preliminary task has been completed."</p>

    <p>"Well done. As expected of the Dark Network's number one leader three hundred years ago."</p>

    <p>The person on the other side of the door said, "Without this Ancient Divine Clan as the key, the main vein can never be opened. I no longer have the patience to wait - I have to take this chance."</p>

    <p>"It's all thanks to the lord," Nightmare relied reverently. He had been resurrected by this white-haired lord behind the door. He had no idea what type of methods this lord had used, but Nightmare was convinced of his strength.</p>

    <p>Three hundred years ago, he had been number one in the Dark Network. If he hadn't died, that Ultimate King of Killers, who had already been caught, wouldn't have risen to number one.</p>

    <p>Nightmare didn't expect that after sleeping for so long, he would actually be brought back to life.</p>

    <p>It was simply like a dream.</p>

    <p>"Now, you still have one final task," White Hair said from inside.</p>

    <p>"Lord, please say it."</p>

    <p>"I want you to sneak into the Residence of Reincarnation and bring back that guy's broken bone piece."</p>

    <p>Residence of Reincarnation... broken bone piece...</p>

    <p>Nightmare was startled.</p>

    <p>Naturally, he couldn't be any more familiar with the Residence of Reincarnation.</p>

    <p>This so-called Residence of Reincarnation was also called the Prison of Reincarnation! This was the largest underground prison in Huaxiu nation! All kinds of vicious spirits which couldn't be completely exterminated as well as savage criminals were imprisoned there! And speaking of broken bones in the Residence of Reincarnation, the first person Nightmare could think of was that legend who founded the Dark Network back then - Xie Sanxiao! People called him: Dark Ancestor!</p>

    <p>"Lord wants to...?"</p>

    <p>"That's right, I want to bring him back to life. However, it's inconvenient for me to make a move directly, which is why you're going. This person is the key to the later part of the plan," said the person behind the door. He wasn't the least bit worried that Nightmare would leak the plan; on the contrary, he told Nightmare what he was going to do next. "Xie Sanxiao's original surname is actually Xia. A long time ago, he was called Xia Sanxiao."</p>

    <p>"Xia Sanxiao?" Nightmare's attention was instantly caught by this surname. "Can it be..."</p>

    <p>"Xie Sanxiao, whom people call Dark Ancestor, was in fact a founding figure of the Ancient Divine Clan. Unfortunately, he died too early."</p>

    <p>Speaking about Dark Ancestor Xie Sanxiao, this was still vivid in Nightmare's mind. When the news broke back then that this Dark Ancestor had finally been arrested and executed, the entire Dark Network had been shaken! No one believed that this legendary founder of the Dark Network would actually die! He had also died at the hands of a person named Zuo Butong. In order to catch Xie Sanxiao, the International Alliance of Cultivators had gathered cultivators from various nations to form a team, and the first Alliance Heavenly Dao warrant was issued; under the Alliance's command, five hundred thousand cultivators from all over the world acted as one to besiege Xie Sanxiao!</p>

    <p>But in the end, when everyone found Xie Sanxiao, a four-man cultivator team dispatched by Huaxiu nation had already taken Xie Sanxiao's head - and the team leader was that very Zuo Butong.</p>

    <p>The entire world had been utterly shaken after that.</p>

    <p>And Huaxiu nation gained worldwide fame after that operation</p>

    <p>In the end, Dark Ancestor Xie Sanxiao was completely incinerated and his body reduced to ash; the only thing left of him was half his skull, the hardest part of the body. Huaxiu Alliance tried several times, but was unable to completely burn it. In the end, it became a keepsake for the Huaxiu team which took down Dark Ancestor Xie Sanxiao, and was stored at the Residence of Reincarnation.</p>

    <p>"Back then, it wasn't this Zuo Butong, the team leader, who dealt the killing blow. Xie Sanxiao died after he failed to absorb the power of the main vein; Zuo Butong finding him at that moment was just a coincidence."</p>

    <p>"A coincidence... so that was what actually happened?"</p>

    <p>"This wasn't a secret among the higher-ups back then; someone from the International Alliance of Cultivators even raised the issue. They made such a big fuss about issuing the first Alliance Heavenly Dao warrant to hunt down the most wanted head of the Dark Network. After mobilizing an army of hundreds of thousands of cultivators from all around the world, Xie Sanxiao ultimately died because of something he himself did. If this got out, what do you think public opinion would've been like?"</p>

    <p>"..." Nightmare was silent; he completely never expected that there would be this sort of story behind what happened back then.</p>

    <p>"At that time, Xie Sanxiao couldn't absorb the power of the main vein, and exploded from the backlash. Zuo Butong's team just happened to be nearby, and took his head in passing. Furthermore, this Zuo Butong's descendant is also one of the organizers of the national high school body technique exchange meet this time."</p>

    <p>"Who is it??"</p>

    <p>"Xie Sanxiao's real name was Xia Sanxiao, while Zuo Butong's real name naturally wasn't Zuo Butong. Although he shot to fame after this battle and was awarded a first-class contribution medal by the International Alliance of Cultivators, he didn't want to be envied for how quickly his star had risen, and he hurriedly applied to change his name. The people who knew what happened back then buried this secret in their hearts; even now, Zuo Butong's descendants don't know about their ancestor's achievement back then."</p>

    <p>Behind the door, the man who knew everything chuckled lightly. "And so, he changed his name from Zuo to Zhuo. His descendants now have the surname Zhuo. Currently, his most famous descendant is Zhuo Yi."</p>
