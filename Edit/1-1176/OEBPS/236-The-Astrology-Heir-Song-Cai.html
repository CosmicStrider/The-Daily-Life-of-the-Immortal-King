  <h1>Chapter 236 The Astrology Heir Song Cai </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling knew that Immortal Toya was refusing on his behalf, but it was the first time a guy had pulled him to his chest... when two deeply attractive young boys came together in this way, he instantly thought of a famous dish that Mother Juan had once cooked: curry gay gay <sup>1</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is a homophone for the transliteration of the 'gotta get that' refrain from the song "Boom Boom Pow" by the Black Eyed Peas.)</dfn>

    <p>General Yi gave Wang Ling a regretful look. "So he's already your disciple?"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "Yes, senior. I took him in as my direct disciple a long time ago."</p>

    <p>This might have appeared to be a very casual remark, but Immortal Toya had given it deliberate thought; if he randomly gave a specific timeframe, it would be bad if General Yi found a hole in his story. Hence, tried and true phrases like "a long time ago" were immensely useful in times like these.</p>

    <p>"Well, since he's your disciple, it wouldn't be nice for me to take him away by force."</p>

    <p>General Yi sighed. "Also, I was just thinking about it; after the old devil goes back with me, there'll be a trial, his sentence, and a whole lot of things I'll need to sort out, so I wouldn't be able to take care of this little student for the time being.</p>

    <p>"Your strength is also pretty good, and your achievements in alchemy have surpassed even the Xiao clan, who are specialists in the field. This little student should do well in the future if he follows you," he said as he looked at Immortal Toya.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya's fair face flushed slightly. "You flatter me, senior."</p>

    <p>"No, it's the truth. There actually aren't many little juniors whom I acknowledge nowadays," General Yi said, hands behind his back. "But I'm curious â€” since he's your disciple, why not make it public?"</p>

    <p>This question made Immortal Toya break out in a cold sweat.</p>

    <p>General Yi was a great senior with formidable prowess and who had a nose for investigation; a normal person would very likely have already given the game away at this question.</p>

    <p>But Immortal Toya's response was swift. "Erm... making it public might be beneficial for his academic development, and his university enrollment in the future wouldn't be a problem, but the effects of this celebrity halo would be really bad for his growth..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, General Yi's eyes lit up; he was very satisfied with this explanation. "Mm, what you said is very reasonable. There are indeed too many juniors nowadays who are too impatient to achieve great things."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya smiled and looked at General Yi. "Therefore, I beseech senior to continue to hide this matter for this junior."</p>

    <p>"Since you have asked and he is your disciple, of course this old man will do so."</p>

    <p>General Yi nodded his head very readily, then looked at Wang Ling with reluctance in his eyes. "This little student, if we meet again in the future, I hope you will have made more progress by then. Of course, to reach the Golden Core stage at this age is already not easy; you're already much stronger than your Senior Zhuo Yi!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya sweatdropped. "..."</p>

    <p>What damn Golden Core stage! What Golden Core cultivator could shut the Gate Between Worlds with his bare hands?</p>

    <p>"Then I'll take my leave first. The old devil and his companion whom he put in the stone ghost mask, Master of Shadow Stream Jiang Liuyue, have now been arrested together, and it'll take a long time to interrogate them. I'll leave the survival contest to you." General Yi led the old devil by a spirit tether, one end of which was tied to the Spirit Shackles. Behind him, the old devil was silent.</p>

    <p>With the Spirit Shackles on, all the old devil's spirit energy was restricted and his five spiritual senses blocked, so he was now like an ordinary man.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya cupped his fists and saluted General Yi respectfully. "Goodbye, senior!"</p>

    <p>"Mm."</p>

    <p>General Yi waved at the two of them, opened a space where he was standing, and walked in with the old devil.</p>

    <p>Just as the spatial crack was about to close, a spirit light flew out and landed securely in Wang Ling's hands.</p>

    <p>"This little student, our meeting this time was fate. Take this. This old man had promised you earlier that I would give you a lucky charm..."</p>

    <p>General Yi had already left through the space with the old devil; his voice came from far away through the void and was transmitted directly to Wang Ling's ears.</p>

    <p>It was a lustrous and warm runestone inscribed with intricate and complex characters. It was the size of the palm of his hand and looked a little like a seashell.</p>

    <p>"Senior Ling... what's this?" Immortal Toya stared blankly at this thing.</p>

    <p>The corner of Wang Ling's mouth twitched, because this runestone was the source of power for this small world!</p>

    <p>"The runetone that controls the source of power for the small world?" Immortal Toya was surprised. "The toxic fog is generated by the system based on the situation, but with this runestone... when the last wave of the toxic fog contracts, it'll be toward this runestone as the center."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "So control of this power source is the same as controlling a god-blessed circle."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "Hey, so... can you let me go first..."</p>

    <p>"Ah! Sorry, Senior Ling!"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya quickly dropped his arm.</p>

    <p>It seemed like he had accidentally brushed Ling Zhenren's hair just now, and it was really super soft! What brand of shampoo did he use?</p>

    <p>Oh... wait!</p>

    <p>That wasn't the main point!</p>

    <p>Damn!</p>

    <p>Did Ling Zhenren open his mouth to speak just now?!</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya carefully recalled what had just happened, and in addition to his astonishment, an intoxicated fanboy expression appeared on his face: Ah~ Ling Zhenren's voice was really nice...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After a three-hour time-out, the survival contest finally resumed.</p>

    <p>In a large supermarket, He Bufeng, Su Xiao and Guo Hao all squared their shoulders in anticipation. Earlier, the supermarket's side entrance had been smashed open by some Xiao clan disciples from Shenye High School with a large wave of fire.</p>

    <p>On their side, there were only ten or so of them left hiding in the supermarket; the number had dropped by more than half since the competition began.</p>

    <p>"What should we do now?" asked a Number 59 High School student.</p>

    <p>"When the survival contest was suspended earlier, those bastards also found a building to hide in. There's not much time left before the final wave of the toxic fog comes in. We have to find a suitable location as soon as possible." He Bufeng frowned.</p>

    <p>"Now we're still in the circle, but there's no guarantee that the next safe zone will work in our favor. If we leave the supermarket now, we'll just be live targets. Do you have any ideas, Senior He?" said Su Xiao.</p>

    <p>"We're in a very bad position. If we want to win now, we need to refresh our god-blessed circle."</p>

    <p>He Bufeng thought for a long while before a mysterious light appeared in his eyes. "Actually, we still have one last option..."</p>

    <p>He turned to look at a teenager wearing a pair of gold-rimmed glasses, and said to the crowd, "Let me introduce all of you to Classmate Song Cai. This is the thirteenth generation heir of the Tuochuqikanjiji <sup>2</sup> Astrology family."</p>
