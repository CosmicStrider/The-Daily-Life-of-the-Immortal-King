  <h1>Chapter 509 The Truth About the Extinction of the Holy Beasts </h1>

  <div>

    <p>"It's the Wuji Umbrella... the <em>ji </em>from 'supreme <sup>1</sup> '!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The Chinese word is 太极 'taiji ..)</dfn>

    <p>When Lord Diulei gave the name of the umbrella, Zhuo Yi instantly looked enlightened. Even though he didn't know what on earth this umbrella was, he felt that its name at least sounded very awesome.</p>

    <p>He remembered seeing an online post before by a well-known magic treasures research specialist who had put up a short excerpt from his paper in which he argued that the shorter and simpler the name, the powerful more the magic treasure.</p>

    <p>This theory was actually debatable, but Zhuo Yi felt that it made sense because he had noticed that most of the magic weapons on the ranking list of magic treasures had names that weren't more than three characters in length.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, those with only two characters were even more amazing...</p>

    <p>For example, Jingke...</p>

    <p>Those with a single character were just plain awesome.</p>

    <p>When he thought this, Zhuo Yi couldn't help sneaking glances at his <em>shifu </em>, Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Because he realized that his <em>shifu </em>Wang Ling's Daoist name was just one character —"Ling"...</p>

    <p>"Wuji Umbrella?"</p>

    <p>Mr Lu was also blank when he heard this name. He had also seen the all-time ranking chart of magic treasures in the human world. Although Huaxiu's culture was extensive and profound, Mr Lu actually didn't know much about it; in some sense, you could even say that his understanding was very poor. However, he still wouldn't overlook the names of magic treasures.</p>

    <p>A lot of the magic treasures in the demon world were actually imitations made from designs pilfered from the human world. Magic treasure knock-offs were in fact a pretty big industry in the demon world at the moment. The humanoid demons who had integrated into the human world would try whatever they could to buy original magic treasures or obtain original design blueprints.</p>

    <p>These original blueprints could sell for sky-high prices in the demon world...</p>

    <p>As a matter of fact, when Mr Lu had still assumed that this fake "Skywalker sword" was real, he had initially intended to bring it with him to the demon world and then directly sell it off.</p>

    <p>If it had been the genuine Skywalker sword, it could have been sold to a magic treasure knock-off agency in the demon world for at least double or triple its value.</p>

    <p>Mr Lu shook his head. "I've never heard of this magic treasure before in the human world."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was already browsing on his phone. There was an app called "Library of Magic Treasures" which was a record of all the renowned magic treasures in the world. The magic treasures inside were ranked by category, and there was also an all-time ranking chart.</p>

    <p>The origin, grade and maker of each magic treasure in the library were clearly stated, but there wasn't any specific data on them; this app was only for listing the records and ranks of the magic treasures.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin put in the name 'Wuji Umbrella,' but in the end he discovered that the Library of Magic Treasures had no relevant record of it.</p>

    <p>"There's really nothing on it!" Xiao Yin said.</p>

    <p>"Looks like that post was actually credible." Lord Diulei tsked.</p>

    <p>An informant?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared blankly.</p>

    <p>They had now cycled back to that mysterious informant on the cultivation forum whom Lord Diulei had mentioned before. In that post, the informant had already emphasized that the demon world wasn't peaceful and that a war was imminent.</p>

    <p>In fact, this informant had revealed some other things as well... For example, Lord Diulei had seen something to do with this Wuji Umbrella in this post.</p>

    <p>But he remembered that this mysterious informant had deleted the post not long after putting it up because a lot of people had questioned it.</p>

    <p>But as the cultivation forum's highest administrator, it was at times like these that Lord Diulei's level of authority was of great use.</p>

    <p>Looking through the history of deleted items in the forum's background was a piece of cake.</p>

    <p>Very quickly, Lord Diulei found the informant's post on his computer, and he scrolled until he found the image of the Wuji Umbrella. "Have a look, Mr Lu, is this the umbrella?"</p>

    <p>Mr Lu was very excited. "Yes! It's this umbrella!"</p>

    <p><em>Who is this informant?</em></p>

    <p>Wang Ling cocked an eyebrow as he asked the question telepathically.</p>

    <p>"The person who posted it is completely anonymous, so I can't find out. In addition, it seems that they even used a fake IP address... This person built on the recent incident with the Demon Hunters Association to talk about how the holy beasts had become extinct due to lies and slander at the time - they then mentioned the Wuji Umbrella. I thought this person was just spouting rubbish back then, but now it looks like it might be some hidden big boss."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei sighed. "I actually did ask Little Black to check it out before, but he couldn't find out who it was at all."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "What is the origin of this umbrella?"</p>

    <p>"Both divine weapons and quasi-divine weapons are born out of nature, and cannot be manufactured. But according to this informant, the Wuji Umbrella is in fact a man-made world-defying magic weapon," Lord Diulei said, his face darkening visibly. "What's more, it was made from forty-nine different types of holy beast skins..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei had already carefully weighed his words when he said this, out of consideration for Xiao Yin's feelings; according to what the informant had originally said in the post, it had been a bloody and brutal massacre.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin naturally froze instantly when he heard this.</p>

    <p>Although it had been a very long time since holy beasts had become extinct, hearing that someone had actually used the skins of forty-nine holy beasts to make a world-defying magic weapon short-circuited Xiao Yin's brain.</p>

    <p>The skins of forty-nine different holy beasts...</p>

    <p>Even when the holy beasts had flourished back then, there had still only been fifty clans! But this person had actually collected forty-nine skins!</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was stupefied.</p>

    <p>No wonder he had smelled a faint trace of something hot and spicy on Mr Lu's hand earlier!</p>

    <p>Because Mr Lu had touched this small black umbrella...</p>

    <p>And it was clear that this small black umbrella contained the skin of Dog Saint, who had been turned into a spicy hot pot stew back then!</p>

    <p>Noticing Xiao Yin's expression, Lord Diulei really couldn't bear to continue speaking, but all this currently was important information which he had to share.</p>

    <p>After sorting out his wording, he continued, "According to this informant, the Wuji Umbrella is actually an incomplete product, and lacks the skin of one holy beast before it's completely finished..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi clenched his teeth and couldn't help pounding the table. "What a lunatic!" No wonder the ranking list of magic treasures didn't have a record of this magic treasure - not only was it an illegal magic treasure, it was also full of evil!</p>

    <p>"Judging from the current situation, it was probably President Bai who created this Wuji Umbrella. Even if he hadn't personally made it himself and instead hired someone else to do it, this is pretty terrible." Lord Diulei sighed. "But there's something which still puzzles me: holy beasts have already been extinct for a long time, so how was he able to collect so many skins?"</p>

    <p>"The reason is very simple."</p>

    <p>At that moment, Mr Lu suddenly said, "I said earlier that I want to bring charges against Bai Zhe for his evil behavior. In fact, there's another very important piece of information... When I worked for him, I once accidentally learned something about the extinction of the holy beasts. If it's true, it was he who engineered the massacre of the holy beasts back then!"</p>
