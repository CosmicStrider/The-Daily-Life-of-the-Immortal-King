  <h1>Chapter 667 The Person You Want to Kill Is Great Death-Courting Senior</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Was it a hallucination just now?</p>

    <p>At that moment, Elder Poisonous Dragon was complete gobsmacked... He licked the blood on his hand; it was still thick and warm. His attack just now had indeed run this "Great Death-Courting Senior" through the heart; there was no mistake! And he had indeed left a big hole in his chest, as if the other party had been hit by a big cannon!</p>

    <p>But in the blink of an eye, why was the other side actually getting up like nothing had happened?</p>

    <p>"How did you do that?" Incredulity was written all over Elder Poisonous Dragon's face; he knew without a doubt that his move just now had indeed hit the target, and it had been a critical hit.</p>

    <p>The second form of this "Lightning Poisonous Dragon Drill" technique cut directly into the chest to destroy the heart at lightning speed. The moment that purple lightning invaded the body, it produced an extremely strong major damage effect. No matter how powerful a person's healing ability was, they wouldn't recover.</p>

    <p>Most critical of all was that this Great Death-Courting Senior was clearly just a Soul Formation cultivator with a realm so far below Elder Poisonous Dragon's; it was impossible for him to survive this move.</p>

    <p>Unless, the man had hidden his strength...</p>

    <p>"You're just a Soul Formation cultivator; none such can survive my stab..." Elder Poisonous Dragon's face was full of grievance. He had thought he'd succeeded, so seeing that his plan had been disrupted made him a little twitchy.</p>

    <p>What was more, he had to handle two people this time; there was also a silver-haired young man on the second floor who was a little more troublesome than this Great Death-Courting Senior. It was said that both Mr Lu and Elder Zuo Wu had been defeated by this young man, which was why Elder Ji Xing had sent Elder Poisonous Dragon this time; he was stronger than Mr Lu and Elder Zuo Wu, and most importantly, he wasn't the least bit sloppy in getting things done.</p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon refused to accept it. He grit his teeth and his right hand transformed once again!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei saw it very clearly this time. This was a spell for transforming the body, and Elder Poisonous Dragon's "Lightning Poisonous Dragon Drill" move was to change his hand into a drill. It had a similar appearance to mercury, but it was very hard and almost on the level of a holy weapon!</p>

    <p>At the moment, both of Elder Poisonous Dragon's hands had turned into huge drills that crackled with wild purple lightning as they lunged at Lord Diulei! Because his body could change shape, Elder Poisonous Dragon's arms could extend like a rubber man's!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei had never seen this technique before, but from a theoretical perspective of cultivation, this "shapeshifting" method couldn't be achieved with magic alone.</p>

    <p>So Lord Diulei thought of another possibility: a life bonded magic treasure implant?</p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon's life bonded magic treasure probably had the ability to freely transform the body into various types of substances, and it was very likely that this life bonded magic treasure had been implanted inside Elder Poisonous Dragon's body to make it easier to use in combination with spells.</p>

    <p>"Go to hell!" Elder Poisonous Dragon braced himself and growled in a low voice.</p>

    <p>His Poisonous Dragon Drill hands pierced right through Lord Diulei's heart and head. "â€” Auldey Double Drills <sup>1</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Auldey Double Diamonds is
actually a toy company.
'Diamond' and 'drill' share the
same word in Chinese ..)</dfn>

    <p>The drills were more brutal and much faster this time! When Elder Poisonous Dragon withdrew his hands, there weren't any bloodstains on them at all. The energy which erupted out of the Poisonous Dragon Drill was so strong that it directly shattered the head and torso, evaporating the blood in its wake and destroying the body in a gruesome way.</p>

    <p>When Elder Poisonous Dragon withdrew his hands, he confirmed that this "Great Death-Courting Senior" had been completely killed by his second attack before he finally heaved a deep sigh.</p>

    <p>He had completely destroyed this "Great Death-Courting Senior's" upper body, leaving just his two long legs behind - it would be really weird if he could survive this state.</p>

    <p>Any resurrection spell had a core, and if it wasn't the head, then it was usually the heart.</p>

    <p>Even if this Great Death-Courting Senior had set up a "resurrection spell" in his body as a precaution, Elder Poisonous Dragon's "Auldey Double Drills" move this time had directly pierced his chest and skull; there was no possibility of him surviving!</p>

    <p>When everything was done, Elder Poisonous Dragon pulled his hands back and couldn't help wiping the sweat from his forehead.</p>

    <p>He hadn't expected this setback today; he had already used up so much energy to deal with a Soul Formation cultivator!</p>

    <p>Staring at Lord Diulei's half body, he snorted coldly. "Heh! For you to die from this venerable man's Auldey Double Drills, your cultivation journey wasn't in vain."</p>

    <p>Saying this, he turned around with the intent of going to the second floor, but he had only taken one step when a hand fell on his shoulder once again. "Bastard, can't you be gentler?! It's damn painful!"</p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon: "???"</p>

    <p>=.= Was this person a cockroach that couldn't die?</p>

    <p>The person he had to kill was Great Death-Courting Senior! Not Great Can't Die Senior!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei touched his head. The Daoist robe he was wearing was very expensive. Thankfully, the "Soul Suppression Ring" could even restore clothes! And after it was restored, the Daoist robe was like brand new: it didn't have any wrinkles and it even emitted a radiant light!</p>

    <p>He had suddenly discovered a new way of refurbishing old Daoist robes!</p>

    <p>But the price was a little heavy...</p>

    <p>And most importantly, the moment he was killed was really very painful!</p>

    <p>But Lord Diulei discovered that he seemed to already be gradually getting used to being killed! He didn't know if it was due to his entire body being directly destroyed by "Evil Sword God" previously, but he felt that Elder Poisonous Dragon's Poisonous Dragon Drill was far less painful than that first time.</p>

    <p>In fact, Lord Diulei had asked Xiao Yin before to kill him repeatedly in order to test the Soul Suppression Ring's traits... but Xiao Yin had adamantly refused to do so.</p>

    <p>With Elder Poisonous Dragon's arrival now, Lord Diulei realized that this was a great opportunity to perform a test! There actually weren't many villains these days who would attack without talking a lot. Lord Diulei felt he had to cherish this chance!</p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon looked at Lord Diulei who had been resurrected on the spot. "You..."</p>

    <p>"Don't say anything, Elder Poisonous Dragon!" Lord Diulei looked at him expectantly with an excited expression on his face, and then grabbed his hand.</p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "What other techniques do you have? Use as many as you like!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon suddenly felt that this Great Death-Courting Senior in front of him seemed to be severely masochistic!</p>

    <p>He was going crazy!</p>

    <p>Discomfited, Elder Poisonous Dragon ramped up the power in his attack and served Lord Diulei a Poisonous Dragon Drill package!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Five minutes later.</p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon had his hands on the knees as he gasped for breath. He gazed at Lord Diulei, who had been revived perfectly again, with the expression of one whose body had been played to death. "Great Death-Courting Senior? Why... why can't I kill you..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei clapped his hands. "The person you want to kill is Great Death-Courting Senior. What does that have to do with me, Lord Diulei?"</p>

    <p>Elder Poisonous Dragon: "..."</p>
