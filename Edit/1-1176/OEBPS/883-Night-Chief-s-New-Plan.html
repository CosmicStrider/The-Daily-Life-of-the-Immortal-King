  <h1>Chapter 883 Night Chief's New Plan</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The Toya clan's Nine Cycles Exquisite Pagoda housed the clan's secrets, and contained the Toya clan's supreme and exclusive pill recipes. Furthermore, it was only in the hands of the Toya clan that the value of this magic artifact would be brought out prominently.</p>

    <p>Holding the pagoda, Immortal Toya dropped a bit of his blood on the top, and a golden light burst out suddenly.</p>

    <p>"What a powerful fluctuation..." Lord Diulei was secretly shocked.</p>

    <p>"I've roused the pagoda spirit, and it's waking up. The pagoda spirit can directly combine with me in battle and improve my combat strength," Immortal Toya said. "But only my Toya clan's bloodline can rouse it, and it's a slightly troublesome process. We have to hit the eye of the pagoda with blood. It took me quite a while to aim that drop of blood just now before I let it go."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Several dozen seconds later, the fluctuations from the Exquisite Pagoda stopped...</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya and Lord Diulei waited for a while, but unexpectedly, there wasn't any response from the Exquisite Pagoda at all.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "What... What's the meaning of this? Why isn't there any movement? Was Brother To's positioning wrong?"</p>

    <p>"Impossible! I've been practicing this 'blood in the eye' move for a long time! I've got very good aim, there's no way I could have made a mistake!" Immortal Toya wouldn't believe it. He started looking through the Toya clan's ancient records for information on the pagoda spirit.</p>

    <p>In the end, he confirmed that it wasn't his fault.</p>

    <p>"Mm... The problem probably isn't with me..."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

    <p>"According to my ancestors, this pagoda spirit has a personality flaw, which is that it's rather cheeky. Furthermore, it has a reverse personality," Immortal Toya said telepathically.</p>

    <p>"Reverse personality?"</p>

    <p>"It means that if we expect it to come out now, it won't come out... The best thing to do is ignore it."</p>

    <p>With that, Immortal Toya and Lord Diulei turned around and pretended to be indifferent.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, the Exquisite Pagoda started to give off fluctuations again...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei sweated. "This pagoda spirit is kind of interesting, Brother To... But speaking of which, how are you going to manipulate it into melding with you?"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya sighed.</p>

    <p>At that moment, he trembled all over.</p>

    <p>His heart resisted, but right now, he had no other way to improve his fighting strength.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya turned his head, ripped apart his own clothes, adopted the expression of a young girl being cruelly treated by some burly guys, and said in a thready voice, "Ah! Yamete! Yamete! Don't! Don't take me!"</p>

    <p>As soon as he said that, the Nine Cycles Exquisite Pagoda vibrated slightly, then a faint figure started to appear out of thin air over the top of the pagoda.</p>

    <p>By the time Immortal Toya regained his composure, the figure had already fully manifested itself. It was a girl dressed in blue. She was tall, slender and graceful, with a small face, red lips, big breasts and wide hips.</p>

    <p>The moment she manifested, she promptly turned into a light which merged with Immortal Toya's body.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya felt a miraculous change in his body.</p>

    <p>Mm...</p>

    <p>Indeed, he felt a lot stronger than before!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, on the border of Mixiu nation, Night Chief was still active. Night Chief's reputation in the Dark Network had taken a heavy blow after the failure of their operation against the Office of Strategic Deception, and President Bai felt how difficult it was to be a boss for the first time.</p>

    <p>It took more than strength to prop up Night Chief. But President Bai was in no hurry; he was preparing a new plan, the "Night Chief National Fitness Program,""National Fitness Program" for short!</p>

    <p>With this program, President Bai planned to target the middle-aged and elderly members of the world to help Night Chief raise a huge amount of funds for its next big operation.</p>

    <p>Thus, after the Office of Strategic Deception's opening ceremony, a chain of clinics called Night National Fitness Fire Therapy Spa popped up like mushrooms after the rain. This fire therapy spa didn't require a lot of capital, and was started up by the members of Night Chief. It didn't take a lot of resources to set up: a 10 square-meter house, two fire therapy beds, and one emphatically not professional massage therapist...</p>

    <p>At that moment, Long Ming was reporting on the set up of the fire therapy spa. "Lord President, the foundation has already been laid for Night National Fitness Fire Therapy Spa. So far, 121 branches are currently doing well, and have collected a lot of money. Furthermore, our sales reps have sold tens of thousands of fire therapy beds, raising almost hundreds of millions in capital. At this rate, it won't be long before we have several billion in savings! Half a month at the soonest!"</p>

    <p>"Very good!" President Bai nodded. "I've seen the tweets on the official account, they're written very good! However, I feel that we can embellish the healing effects a little more."</p>

    <p>Long Ming sweated. "Then... there's a chance that we'll draw the attention of Mixiu's Consumer Association..."</p>

    <p>"When did my Night Chief start to become afraid of swindling people? Anyway, this is a short-term fundraiser; once we're rolling in cash, we'll run." President Bai smiled. "Just do as I say!"</p>

    <p>Long Ming sweated and didn't dare refuse.</p>

    <p>Thus, Long Ming put considerable effort that night into hiring a water army of hundreds to promote the magical effects of the fire therapy bed alongside the new tweets on the official account.</p>

When he was about to advance to the Nascent Soul stage, his nascent soul escaped his dantian. The doctor said that this was a conception outside the dantian, and if it was allowed to continue to grow and wasn't treated in time, my friend would probably lose all his cultivation. My friend didn't buy it, and pig-headedly didn't believe the doctor. In the end, because his nascent soul was exposed to too much smog outside his dantian, it directly contracted pneumonia and died! Just like a stillbirth! When my friend went to look for the doctor again, the doctor said that his nascent soul couldn't be saved, and advised for my friend to have it removed, otherwise even his own life would be in danger. In the end, it was by happy coincidence that my friend encountered Night National Fitness Fire Therapy Spa... After two days of fire therapy, his dead nascent soul was actually revived, and even returned to the dantian itself, live and kicking!</em></p>

    <p><em>Please support National Fitness Fire Therapy Spa. Old Li, who lives below us, was born with a disability, with no feeling in both his legs. After being insulted for it when he was young, he was so pissed off that he cut off his legs. But in the end? After using fire therapy, not only did he grow a new pair of legs, he even had feeling in them. Even the one in the middle turned thick and solid!</em></p>

    <p><em>As the spring breeze of reform blows, National Fitness Fire Therapy Spa is also lively... Small fire therapy beds are good for the kidneys, can extend your life, and give you vigorous health! Guess what happened after my friend's spirit beast, Salted Fish King, used a fire therapy bed? It directly underwent a Mega Evolution! And became a Golden Gyara Rayquaza <sup>1</sup> </em><em>! That was such a huge gain! ÃÅ_&gt;` I'll stop here! I'm going to buy a bed!</em></p>
