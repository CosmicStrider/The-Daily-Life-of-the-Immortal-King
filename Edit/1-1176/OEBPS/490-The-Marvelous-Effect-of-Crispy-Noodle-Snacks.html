  <h1>Chapter 490 The Marvelous Effect of Crispy Noodle Snacks </h1>

  <div>

    <p>How did he feel after eating the crispy noodle snack?</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin couldn't say...</p>

    <p>He had only eaten the crispy noodle snack in his hand earlier because he had been too nervous just now, and had also forgotten to sprinkle the seasoning... Who the hell knew what it felt like?</p>

    <p>But before he could say anything, Xiao Yin really did feel a burning power surge through him after eating this crispy noodle snack, as if there was a big ball of fire burning in his <em>dantian </em>!</p>

    <p>Abundant spirit power?</p>

    <p>No way...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was stunned. Generally speaking, this was a phenomenon that only happened on the point of a breakthrough in realms. He had had this feeling one thousand years ago, when he had advanced from seventh class to sixth class! It was perhaps different from what normal human cultivators felt when they broke through, but abundant spirit power was indeed a phenomenon unique to holy beasts when they were about to break through to a higher realm.</p>

    <p>The hell?! Had he experienced a super evolution after eating a crispy noodle snack?</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin shook his hands and felt a strange power surge through his body, which stunned him stupid.</p>

    <p>It turned out Er Ha really wasn't lying - crispy noodle snacks could really help him cultivate?!</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin thought that this was unfathomable. He suddenly remembered that Er Ha had said before that this batch of crispy noodle snacks had all been personally enchanted by Master himself, and each packet was a prized collectible. The outer packaging and sachet of seasoning were different! This was clearly far grander than the cheap versions of the crispy noodle snacks sold outside!</p>

    <p>At this time, Xiao Yin suddenly remembered how Lord Diulei had begged piteously for one crispy noodle snack packet, even selling himself without hesitation as physical labor to brush Xiao Yin's fur for him... It looked like the crispy noodle snacks Master had given him were really something!</p>

    <p>Reflecting on how Lord Diulei had only exerted a little physical labor in return for one crispy noodle snack packet, Xiao Yin immediately felt like fainting. He now had eighteen packets left, and he had to make sure to use them well...</p>

    <p>At that moment, feeling the spirit power roil about in his body, Xiao Yin suddenly felt a little regretful — he should have eaten the crispy noodle snack earlier!</p>

    <p>He had already stagnated at sixth class for many years, but this crispy noodle snack had actually enabled him to directly attain spirit power abundant enough for him to almost achieve a breakthrough; this was something which Xiao Yin could never have predicted.</p>

    <p>However, once the spirit power in his body reached the saturation point, which was the "abundant spirit power" condition which all holy beasts possessed, he would have to go into seclusion for at least three to five days in order to fully digest this spirit power.</p>

    <p>And the key thing was that in these three to five days, he had to avoid fighting as much as possible, because battle was bound to consume spirit power, which would cause this "abundant spirit power" condition to disappear.</p>

    <p>But it was clear that it was now too late to say anything.</p>

    <p>Although it hurt to lose an opportunity to advance to another level, he still had eighteen crispy noodle snack packets left, so he still had another chance!</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin comforted himself in his heart as spirit power amassed in the soles of his feet little by little...</p>

    <p>At that moment, Lord Diulei, who had already entered the game, suddenly thought of something. With a "not good" expression on his face, he turned his head and yelled in alarm, "Brother Xiao!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "???"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Remember to take the stairs."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the gate to the villa, Mr Lu rang the bell again. Through the monocle's infrared sensor, he saw everything that was happening inside, and that someone was headed toward him.</p>

    <p>When he saw the figure approach the door, his hand clenched on the cane he was holding. This wasn't an ordinary cane, but a special cane-type spirit sword. While it looked like nothing more than a walking cane on the outside, it in fact contained something profound inside.</p>

    <p>Mr Lu had purchased this cane at Jingxi International Mall's annual auction, and it had been delivered to him a few months ago from across the ocean.</p>

    <p>This was a second-class holy weapon which cost ten million immortal gold — the Skywalker sword! Seventh in the general spirit sword rankings!</p>

    <p>Of course, it was President Bai who had settled the bill for him, and the sword could be considered the first gift President Bai had bestowed upon him after Mr Lu had become his assistant. Originally, Mr Lu had planned to resign several months ago once his contract expired in order to return to his clan.</p>

    <p>After all, he was part of the demon race, so remaining so long in the human world had never been part of his long-term plan. But because of this sword, Mr Lu had renewed his labor contract with President Bai for another fifty years.</p>

    <p>Mr Lu was a sincere and sophisticated man, as could be seen from him ringing the bell.</p>

    <p>After all these years standing by President Bai's side, he did have some feelings as an old employee.</p>

    <p>Thus, half the reason he had renewed for another fifty years was because of the sword, and the other half was because of affection.</p>

    <p>Mr Lu grasped the cane.</p>

    <p>Very soon, the moment the person inside opened the door, he would force his way in with this Skywalker sword worth ten million immortal gold and then behead the other party!</p>

    <p>The front door cracked open...</p>

    <p>Narrowing his eyes, Mr Lu jumped lithely over the iron gate surrounding the villa and brandished the Skywalker sword as he attacked Xiao Yin.</p>

    <p>An Itinerant Immortal was very fast, and to an ordinary person, his whole figure looked like lighting leaping up from the ground. Xiao Yin had only opened the door a little when he saw a sword light shining bright in front of him.</p>

    <p>"No wonder the demon qi is so heavy, it really is an Itinerant Immortal!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin closed his eyes and folded his arms; he had already prepared for this.</p>

    <p>The instant Xiao Yin opened his eyes, the space around him changed, startling Mr Lu so much that he paused in his attack. He spun around in midair and took a few steps back as he realized that the scene around him had actually transformed into a desert.</p>

    <p>"Intrinsic spirit field?" Mr Lu paled.</p>

    <p>He hadn't expected the silver-haired young man in front of him to be so powerful. Only someone who was at the very least a True Immortal would have this ability.</p>

    <p>However, Xiao Yin's current strength wasn't at True Immortal level.</p>

    <p>The reason why he could cast an intrinsic spirit field was in fact similar to Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing had inherited his intrinsic spirit field from his biological father Immortal She Pi, and Xiao Yin's intrinsic spirit field was also handed down.</p>

    <p>However, Xiao Yin was more proficient at casting the intrinsic spirit field than Fang Xing. After thousands of years of practice, he could release his intrinsic spirit field almost instantaneously.</p>

    <p>"Are you the owner of that green-furred dog, or a friend? Or are you the green-furred dog transformed?" Mr Lu asked Xiao Yin as he pointed the tip of his sword at him.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin cocked his head. "???"</p>

    <p>Was this person looking for Er Ha?</p>

    <p>Hearing this question, Xiao Yin's reaction was swift.</p>

    <p>He remembered that Er Ha had apparently mentioned before that there were people hunting it down after the Demon Hunters Association had been exposed. But the other party must have gotten something wrong - they kept assuming that he was Er Ha in human form, so whenever anyone came looking for trouble, it fell on him!</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin immediately felt some despair.</p>

    <p>No matter to what extent a green-furred dog could transform, it was impossible for it to become a silver-haired Adonis like him!</p>

    <p>Were the members from this organization called "Demon Hunters Association" all colorblind?</p>
