  <h1>Chapter 392 Moving the Orange Trees Daily is Very Tiring! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>At the moment, Xiao Yin looked very nervous as he sat cross-legged on the floor of the room.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was still reviewing his lessons at this time, and no one could interrupt him. Although Xiao Yin had been invited in, he was being strictly monitored by Pen and Eraser these two brawny brothers.</p>

    <p>Unlike humans and spirit beasts, transformed goblins were different in that they had unique energy fluctuations which were generally hard for cultivators to sense. But as a holy beast, Xiao Yin's sixth sense was very acute, and it didn't take long for him to realize that the two brothers sitting cross-legged behind him and gazing at him weren't ordinary people...</p>

    <p>Apart from that, the rest of his attention was on Er Ha, who was sleeping at Wang Ling's feet. Xiao Yin could feel that the waves of spirit energy emanating from this green-furred akita were also unusual.</p>

    <p>All in all, he noticed something observing his surroundings in Wang Ling's room.</p>

    <p>He abruptly realized that there wasn't a single normal person in this entire room!</p>

    <p>But saying this might seem a little ambiguous.</p>

    <p>Did it mean that Ling Zhenren couldn't be considered human?</p>

    <p>- Of course he couldn't!</p>

    <p>He was so strong!</p>

    <p>So cool!</p>

    <p>He was clearly a god!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin looked at the time; roughly five minutes after he had entered the room, Wang Ling finished studying, and he closed his book.</p>

    <p>Then he swiveled around in his chair in Xiao Yin's direction. "Did you bring it?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling spoke telepathically as always, but while the sound was clear and crisp as usual, Xiao Yin found it surprisingly pleasant to listen to!</p>

    <p>Light flashed in Xiao Yin's hand, and a red crystal appeared in his palm. "...Four thousand milliliters of holy beast blood have been condensed into this blood crystal. When Senior Ling wants to use it, just drop it in an equal amount of water."</p>

    <p>Picking up this blood crystal with two fingers, Wang Ling could already sense the vibrant power which emanated from it.</p>

    <p>As Xiao Yin had said, the blood crystal contained four thousand milliliters of holy beast blood.</p>

    <p>After examining it, Wang Ling went into the bathroom and filled a wooden bucket with four thousand milliliters of water, using his Heavenly Eye to measure it out.</p>

    <p>Not a drop more and not a drop less.</p>

    <p>Then, Xiao Yin watched Wang Ling throw the blood crystal into the bucket...</p>

    <p>"What is Senior Ling doing?" Xiao Yin stared blankly.</p>

    <p>"See that plump green-furred akita? That's our Lord's pet, Er Ha."</p>

    <p>Pen said, "Now, we're going to give it a bath."</p>

    <p>A bath?</p>

    <p>Bathing in holy beast blood...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin couldn't help twitching his lips - this was too extravagant!</p>

    <p>He had collected so much blood yesterday without stopping to rest, but had never expected that it would in the end be used for a bath!</p>

    <p>For some reason, he suddenly felt his liver hurting!</p>

    <p>Before he could figure out Wang Ling's exact intention, Xiao Yin saw Wang Ling cut his hand through the air, and the oblivious sleeping green-furred akita was suddenly floating.</p>

    <p>After that, Wang Ling crooked one finger.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin heard a "putong" as the dog was directly dumped into the wooden bucket just like that...</p>

    <p>On the side, Pen explained, "Our Lord's pet suffers from severe narcolepsy for some reason; once it falls asleep, it's as if it's lost consciousness. In order to thoroughly deal with this condition, our Lord is using an ancient art to treat it, and the most important component of this art is holy beast blood; ancient texts say that holy beast blood has magical effects in treating narcolepsy!"</p>

    <p>"Ancient art?" Xiao Yin was a little surprised. As he pondered this, he gnawed his finger out of habit.</p>

    <p>This was a bad habit he had acquired in his human form; he would gnaw his finger at every little thing.</p>

    <p>He never did this at all in his beast form, since there was no way he could gnaw on his hooves!</p>

    <p>"My impression is that there are very few detailed records on using holy beast blood in the healing arts!"</p>

    <p>"Do you know Immortal Doctor Kang Nuo?" The Pen explained, "He left this art behind in an ancient medical text. In addition to the Immortal Doctor's book, our Lord also has texts by Holy Doctor, Demon Doctor, King Doctor, Emperor Doctor, Monarch Doctor and Bitch Doctor..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>When he heard this, Xiao Yin immediately had a curious look on his face. "But what on earth is Senior Ling doing?"</p>

    <p>As a genuine holy beast, there was no one here who was more familiar with the properties of holy beast blood than Xiao Yin; he had no way of knowing if it could cure narcolepsy, but he knew that just soaking in holy beast blood wouldn't be any use at all.</p>

    <p>While he was engaged in scientific discussion with Pen, Xiao Yin saw that Wang Ling was about to do something else.</p>

    <p>After placing the dog into the wooden bucket full of holy beast blood, Wang Ling swiftly took out a spirit grass which looked a lot like a "Chinese green onion."</p>

    <p>The moment Wang Ling took it out, Xiao Yin could immediately sense dense currents of overflowing spirit qi; this green onion contained a terrifying amount of spirit power!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling broke this green onion up and scattered it like chopped onion pieces inside the wooden bucket.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was dumbfounded; this was a spirit grass he had never seen before. "This spirit grass that looks like a green onion - what is it?"</p>

    <p>Pen: "Allow me to clarify: this spirit grass that looks like a green onion, is actually a green onion."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>Motherfucker! This green onion was overflowing with spirit power! It wasn't a proper green onion at all!</p>

    <p>Pen: "The difference is that our Lord personally grew this onion, so it has extraordinary effects."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>After putting the dog in the bucket and scattering the green onion pieces, Wang Ling actually found a lid and then covered the whole bucket.</p>

    <p>Finished with that, Wang Ling crossed his arms on the side - the only thing he could do now was wait.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was a little confused. "Excuse me... what is the point of this step?"</p>

    <p>Pen answered pragmatically, "This wooden bucket looks very ordinary, but it's something which our Lord personally transformed, and it has the ability to heat up once the lid is put on. Now, we just need to wait for it to heat up."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin somehow felt that there was something wrong with this method. "..."</p>

    <p>Hold on!</p>

    <p>Put in holy beast blood, add dog, scatter green onion pieces, cover with a lid, heat it up...</p>

    <p>These series of actions seemed a bit familiar!</p>

    <p>Seeing the silver-haired young man's alarmed and pale expression, Pen explained earnestly, "What you are seeing is the 'Instant Noodles Treatment' recorded in Immortal Doctor Kang Nuo's ancient text, carried out perfectly!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>It was his first time hearing that holy beast blood could be used in this way!</p>

    <p>- What damn "Instant Noodles Treatment"!</p>

    <p>The Second Battalion Commander was already very tired from holding the noodle bowl!</p>

    <p>Moving the orange trees around daily was very tiring!</p>

    <p>Giving out awards everyday was very hard on Mr Chen Duxiu!</p>

    <p>Swinging a forty-meter broadsword around was arm-breaking!</p>

    <p>Dihuazixiu's liquid hand soap had increased in price!</p>

    <p>The trophy had been rubbed so much the paint had come off!</p>

    <p>So please, don't show off anymore <sup>1</sup> !</p>
