  <h1>Chapter 114 Brother Ling, Come over for a Bit... </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Fighting lions, a kind of hybrid spirit beast that could possess wind and fire attributes, had been bred by the Xiao clan since the Spirit Energy era. Most fighting lions possessed the fire attribute, followed by those that had the wind attribute. A small number of fighting lions possessed both, which made them invaluable.</p>

    <p>A young fighting lion's strength was equal to a human at the Golden Core stage. Not only were they powerfully built, fast and smart, their ability to learn was also very high; they were ranked first among all spirit beasts in terms of overall intelligence.</p>

    <p>Because of the fighting lion's ferocity, the breeding of these spirit beasts was restricted by Huaxiu nation's Regulatory Office of Spirit Pets. As a result, fighting lions were very rare. The Xiao clan only had about five hundred of them; they were reared in Uta Forest, which was clan territory.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya had one which he had won in an elixir competition previously.</p>

    <p>And now, he was an Alchemists' Association consultant for the Xiao clan — his relationship with the clan was pretty unusual.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "This little thing is very difficult to deal with; when I first got it, it was only the size of a basketball, but it chewed through eight of my pill furnaces... may I ask, why do you want to borrow this fighting lion, Brother Lei?"</p>

    <p>"I want it to guard something for me. This thing is only watching an orchard for you, right? And even stealing spirit fruit to eat. Now is the time to test its actual combat strength!"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya's shoulders shook. "Then... how long do you need it for?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei quickly replied, "Half a month."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya asked again, "That... will it be dangerous?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "It might die."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "..."</p>

    <p>"But don't worry, Brother Toya, if it dies, I'll reimburse you with something even better. Do you know the fighting phoenix? This is the latest hybrid bird the Xiao clan is breeding, and it's damn strong! Next time I'll steal one for you!" Lord Diulei swore solemnly.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "..."</p>

    <p>The value of fighting lions went without saying. If it was any other person who had wanted to borrow it, Immortal Toya would have definitely refused straightaway. But this time, it was Lord Diulei who was asking; given their friendship and for the sake of face, Immortal Toya knew that he had no choice but to lend him the lion.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At night, Lord Diulei received a text message from Wang Ling containing some points for attention in relation to the parent-teacher conference. To sum it up in two words: low profile...</p>

    <p>He was well aware of Brother Ling's character as someone who didn't like to show off his talents or abilities.</p>

    <p>But honestly speaking, he was a bit disconcerted by the parent-teacher conference. He didn't even have a child of his own, but now he had to pass himself off as a guardian and attend this event. Just thinking about it gave him a damn headache.</p>

    <p>After racking his brains, Student Lei Mouren suddenly thought of something, and he called Little Black once again. "Hello, Little Black, help me investigate one more thing. Um... right, please help me look up any information to do with the parents and teachers of Grade One, Class Three at Number 60 High School."</p>

    <p>After saying that, he happily ended the call.</p>

    <p>There was a good saying: know yourself and know your enemy, only then will you win every war!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, in the foreign languages research office at Landscape Manor, two men in suits, one tall and one short, stood in front of Director Song's table to give their report.</p>

    <p>The tall man in a suit submitted a report which clearly documented the results of monitoring Lord Diulei for the whole of today.</p>

    <p><em>At 4:00, the target got out of bed, went to the back garden and sat down to survey a piece of broccoli, head bent in concentration...</em></p>

    <p><em>At 5:00, the target was still staring at the broccoli, head bent in concentration...</em></p>

    <p><em>At 6:00, the target was still staring at the broccoli, head bent in concentration...</em></p>

    <p><em>At 7:00, the target was staring at the broccoli, but then suddenly stood up...</em></p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Director Song stared at the report, his face bewildered. "..." What the hell was this man doing?!</p>

    <p>Before he could think further on it, a call came in on his wristwatch. Looking at the caller ID, he became so frightened that his wrist shook...</p>

    <p>It was the Lord calling.</p>

    <p>"How are things coming along?" Over the phone came the deep male voice of the Lord of Mo Immortal Castle.</p>

    <p>"Lord, today we surveilled the target for the whole day, but his behavior... seems very suspicious. He actually spent three whole hours sitting and staring at a piece of broccoli!"</p>

    <p>"..." The person on the other end of the line was clearly taken aback for several seconds, before he slowly began to speak. "...This Great Death-Courting Senior is very famous in the cultivation world, what makes you think you can fathom the thoughts of a man at the Soul Formation stage?"</p>

    <p>"What the Lord says is true..."</p>

    <p>"No matter what this Great Death-Courting Senior is thinking, one thing is for certain... given the way this senior thinks, the more suspicious his behavior, the more it's clear that this matter cannot be allowed to drag on."</p>

    <p>"Then, are we taking the mask by force?" Director Song was a little apprehensive.</p>

    <p>So in the end, it had still come to this...</p>

    <p>But it wasn't going to be easy to swipe this mask from a Soul Formation cultivator.</p>

    <p>"I know what you're worried about, it will indeed not be easy to take this mask from Great Death-Courting Senior. This senior must certainly have a thorough understanding of the extremely strong curse on the stone ghost mask, and so he can't carry it around with him. I'm sure the mask is still in the villa; perhaps this senior has sealed it away by some means?"</p>

    <p>"The Lord is right!"</p>

    <p>Director Song nodded. "Even if we can break into the villa, it will also take us some time to break the seal."</p>

    <p>" <em>Hehe </em>, not necessarily."</p>

    <p>There was a low sneer on the other end of the line. "I will admit that this Great Death-Courting Senior is indeed troublesome, and it won't be easy to deal with a Soul Formation cultivator. But won't the results be different if we send people with the same level of strength?"</p>

    <p>"Lord, you mean..."</p>

    <p>"How about five Soul Formation cultivators?"</p>

    <p>There was a laugh. "I want you to outline a plan and send them to invade the villa and grab the stone ghost mask!"</p>

    <p>"Five... five Soul Formation cultivators?!" Director Song's hands trembled.</p>

    <p>"Is five not enough?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"If it isn't..."</p>

    <p>The voice on the line continued, deep and shocking. "Then ten!"</p>

    <p>Ten Soul Formation cultivators...</p>

    <p>Director Song had already become completely incoherent. The two men in suits standing in front of him, both of whom were at the Golden Core stage, had lifeless looks on their faces. Director Song was just a Nascent Soul cultivator, but now he had to direct ten cultivators with higher realms than his at the Soul Formation stage in order to complete this mission...</p>

    <p>"I recently expended a priceless treasure in exchange for these ten Soul Formation cultivators. They've signed contracts to serve my Mo Immortal Castle for three years. You've been with me for many years and have seldom failed in the tasks I assigned you. This time, I hope everything will be accomplished smoothly. The stone ghost mask is something that my Mo Immortal Castle must have, and it cannot fall into the hands of anyone else!"</p>

    <p>Director Song clicked his heels together as he replied, "Rest assured, Lord! Your subordinate will definitely execute this mission successfully! I won't let you down!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>While Director Song was on the phone, Lord Diulei had once again gotten caught up in his tangled thoughts.</p>

    <p>He sometimes had OCD, anxiety and the perfectionist attitude of a Virgo. He had to ensure that the stone ghost mask was absolutely safe in the villa when he wasn't around tomorrow.</p>

    <p>Although he already had the fighting lion guarding the villa, Lord Diulei still felt a bit worried — it was the feeling you got when you weren't even five minutes out the door, but then suddenly began to wonder whether you had locked the door or turned off the gas...</p>

    <p>So, after some consideration, he made another call.</p>

    <p>"Hello, is that Brother Ling? Yeah, it's Thunder... so, tomorrow I'll attend the parent-teacher conference for you, can you come to my place to watch the stone ghost mask?"</p>
