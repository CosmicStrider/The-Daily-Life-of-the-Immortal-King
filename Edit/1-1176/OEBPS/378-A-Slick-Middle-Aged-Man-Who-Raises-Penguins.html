  <h1>Chapter 378 A Slick Middle-Aged Man Who Raises Penguins </h1>

  <div>

    <p>The test at the assessment center was divided into many parts. In addition to the strength test, speed test, jump test, defense test and intelligence test, which were the five basic ability tests, the most important part was the last actual combat assessment segment.</p>

    <p>Before Wei Zhi had gone in, Er Ha had heard him say that the spirit beasts used in the actual combat segment had been bred together by the assessment center.</p>

    <p>All the test beasts had the same abilities; the only difference was in their grades.</p>

    <p>The assessment center's general rule was that after the five basic ability tests, the assessment center instructor would directly determine the grade based on the spirit beast's overall ability. For example, if it was a fourth-class spirit beast, a fourth-class test beast would be arranged for the last actual combat segment.</p>

    <p>If the spirit beast won, it would ultimately be upgraded to third class or its grade would remain the same depending on its performance in the fight. But if the spirit beast lost, it would be downgraded to a lower level.</p>

    <p>This was a rule that had been put in place back when the assessment centers had been first set up, and was in fact pretty fair.</p>

    <p>The only troublesome thing was the test beast's ability.</p>

    <p>Because from what Wei Zhi had said, the test beasts which all the assessment centers used were spirit emperor penguins.</p>

    <p>Er Ha had some knowledge of this type of spirit beast. In addition to their strong ability to endure and resist attacks, they had an annoying but extremely powerful ability to mimic other spirit beasts â€” in a short span of time, they could completely duplicate any spells used by a spirit beast in battle, so they could be considered pretty omnipotent spirit beasts.</p>

    <p>But they also had a weakness, which was that they usually dealt very little damage. Hence, spirit emperor penguins were very suitable for use as test beasts in assessment centers.</p>

    <p>While Er Ha was contemplating this, one of the test rooms had been vacated, and at the same time, the broadcast system started to call out a number, which was Er Ha's very number: number 177.</p>

    <p>There were five test rooms in the test hall. Wei Zhi had entered room number 4. The room Er Ha was going to enter was room number 5, next to Wei Zhi.</p>

    <p>Er Ha glanced at the screen and saw that Wei Zhi and his Pushing Large Butterfly had just started the speed test.</p>

    <p>After its number was called, Er Ha disgorged its number plate from its mouth and waited quietly at the door to room 5.</p>

    <p>After a while, the person who had entered room 5 previously came out. It was a man in a black windbreaker, and unexpectedly, it was followed by a small bone dragon.</p>
    
    <p>This small bone dragon following the man appeared very docile, but the two balls of hellfire in its eyes looked very horrifying.</p>

    <p>Was this person a foreigner?</p>

    <p>Er Ha was shocked because bone dragons were spirit beasts that belonged to the dead souls category and weren't seen in Huaxiu nation. Furthermore, local cultivators mostly chased luck in fengshui, so very few of them would raise a dead soul-type spirit beast. Hence, they didn't really sell well in Huaxiu. However, this kind of spirit beast was quite popular abroad.</p>

    <p>"I really want to know what this bone dragon's grade is, it should be pretty awesome."</p>

    <p>"But it seems that its owner didn't choose to make its test public. What a pity! It's rare to see one!"</p>

    <p>There were sounds of discussion around Er Ha.</p>

    <p>It watched as the man in the black windbreaker and the little bone dragon walked out the door. When they reached the entrance to the test hall, Er Ha saw the man suddenly pause.</p>

    <p>Then, Er Ha could very clearly sense a formidable wave of spiritual awareness bear down on it.</p>

    <p>Wanted to feel it out?</p>

    <p>Er Ha narrowed its eyes and deliberately released its demon king soul in return.</p>

    <p>As a result, the man in the black windbreaker at the doors was clearly stunned as he staggered and almost fell.</p>

    <p>This scene made Er Ha sneer in its heart - a Golden Core cultivator wanted to act cocky with it?</p>

    <p>After the man in the black windbreaker left with his bone dragon, Er Ha waited for over three minutes at the door before a very slick-looking middle-aged male instructor walked out of the test room. "Mr Er, sorry to have kept you waiting. We've just finished tidying up the room; you can come in for your test now."</p>

    <p>When Er Ha heard this address, the corners of its mouth immediately couldn't help twitching.</p>

    <p>Mr... Er? This address really sounded idiotic <sup>1</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The pinyin for Er Ha is 'Erha,' and 'er' is used in Chinese slang to mean idiotic or foolish.)</dfn>

    <p>The middle-aged instructor leafed through the information in his hands. "According to this information, this is Mr Er's first visit here?"</p>

    <p>"Mm."</p>

    <p>Er Ha nodded, and then looked at the middle-aged instructor a little strangely. "Don't you think it's strange that I can talk?"</p>

    <p>The middle-aged instructor shook his head with the expression of one who was unmoved by the unusual. "I've been in this field for ten years... There's a good saying: you may not have eaten pork, but surely you've seen a pig run <sup>2</sup> ."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Someone may not have experienced something for themselves, but still has some knowledge of it.)</dfn>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>The middle-aged instructor: "Generally speaking, spirit beasts only begin to grasp the ability to speak when they reach second class. But of the ten thousand or so spirit beasts that I've assessed, I've occasionally come across several who can talk despite not yet having reached second class. Based on the requirements of that Society of Saints that's become popular lately, these spirit beasts would also be considered unusually gifted."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>The middle-aged instructor looked at Er Ha and couldn't help laughing. "But it seems that you can also write? Then you are a talent among talents. You should be careful on your way home, otherwise you might really be snatched up by this Society of Saints."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "The Society of Saints also takes in spirit beasts?"</p>

    <p>The middle-aged instructor looked at Er Ha in extreme surprise. "You don't even know that? The Society of Saints has spirit beast classes. Do you still remember their TV ad? There were several dragonflies that flew past that youngster - those were high-ranked spirit beasts."</p>

    <p>Er Ha was startled... There was actually this detail? It hadn't noticed at all!</p>

    <p>It should be said that most people's attention would have been focused on that youngster, Chu Yuanhao, from Jiancai High School.</p>

    <p>The middle-aged instructor looked at Er Ha as he walked along. "This might be an occupational disease I've developed after so many years: I am far more sensitive to spirit beasts than other people. When I saw those dragonflies, I wondered if the Society of Saints had any spirit beast classes. In the end, I looked it up online and found that they did have classes. Furthermore, it seems that recently, the society wants to collaborate with spirit beast assessment centers nationwide to find spirit beasts with unusual talent."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>For some reason, Er Ha suddenly felt a creeping sense of danger.</p>

    <p>While the person and the dog were chatting, they officially arrived at the test room.</p>

    <p>Several machines had been set up inside the room.</p>

    <p>The middle-aged instructor said, "Mr Er would probably have seen it on the screens outside; you'll undergo five basic ability tests. After you're done with them, I'll work out your grade and then arrange a test beast to fight you in actual combat."</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, he suddenly looked proud. "To tell you the truth, I was the one who raised all the spirit emperor penguins used for testing in this assessment center!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "You raised them?"</p>

    <p>"That's right! Our Ma family has been raising all kinds of penguins for generations."</p>

    <p>The middle-aged instructor held out his work permit in front of Er Ha very proudly. "I am the only son of the thirtieth generation of the Ma family, Ma Huateng <sup>3</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(Ma Huateng is the founder of Tencent Holdings, which developed the instant messenger Tencent QQ whose logo is a penguin wearing a red scarf ..)</dfn>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>
