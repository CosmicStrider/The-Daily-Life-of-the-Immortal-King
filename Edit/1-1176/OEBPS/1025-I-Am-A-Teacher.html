  <h1>Chapter 1025 I. Am. A. Teacher!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Ever since the incident with the Shadow Stream assassins, extreme precautions had been taken when it came to Sun Rong's personal safety. Retrieving the Jade Scroll of School History was indeed very important, but the current situation had suddenly changed. As Number 60 High's vanguard teacher as well as Grade One, Class Three's homeroom teacher, there was no way Teacher Pan would stand by and watch! The safety of the students was always the top priority!</p>

    <p>Even so, she was still shocked by the number of people - over a hundred killers had actually been hiding on a commercial street like this (It actually wasn't a hundred, but the black shadow soldiers and the killers were wearing very similar clothing, so Teacher Pan had completely lumped the two forces together.)?</p>

    <p>Including the bodyguards dispatched by Huaguo Water Curtain Group, there were now three forces on this commercial street.</p>

    <p>When you were heavily outnumbered, it was only right to retreat. Teacher Pan knew that the killers had absolutely come prepared for the assassin operation this time, but they would only hurt her students over her dead body! Otherwise, don't even think about it!</p>

    <p>"Everyone! Please protect my two students and evacuate them safely!"</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan raised her spirit sword as she stood alone as cover at the very front, her words directed to the group of bodyguards.</p>

    <p>While these bodyguards were at the Golden Core stage, the professional bodyguards from security companies in most cases had accelerated realms: their foundations were shaky and they had pitifully little real combat experience. In a crisis, they could only surround their employer in a "parked bus" formation <sup>1</sup> according to the crisis plan provided by the company.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>("Parking the bus" in soccer
refers to an ultra-defensive
strategy. The Chinese term for
it literally translates to "metal
barrel.")</dfn>

    <p>What was the worst situation in a battle? Naturally, it was a set method!</p>

    <p>No matter how amazing a set method was, it would eventually be seen through. These people were professional killers, who were wise in the ways of breaking formations and assassination - what could a parked bus formation do against these people?</p>

    <p>Fortunately, it seemed that the assassins sent to kill Sun Rong only had a numbers advantage; Teacher Pan felt that she would still have a good chance of winning if it were a one-on-one match up, but now that she was outnumbered, her response strategy had to change.</p>

    <p>"Teacher Pan!" The two girls were worried about Teacher Pan's safety.</p>

    <p>Protected by numerous bodyguards, they retreated inch by inch along the wall on the street.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan gripped the spirit sword, and light reflected off her stylish gold-rimmed glasses. Looking at the hundred or so assassins out of the corner of her eye, she couldn't help the beads of cold sweat which trickled down her cheeks.</p>

    <p>It was explicitly forbidden to fight on the streets. There was one exception, however, and that was reasonable self-defense!</p>

    <p>"All of you! As long as I'm here, don't think that you can do anything to my students."</p>

    <p>Saying that, Teacher Pan stuck the spirit sword into the ground.</p>

    <p>She had never revealed her fighting capability in front of her students before. She had a pretty pure spirit root inside her â€” an earth spirit root! Cultivators with the earth spirit root used the forces of nature. A spirit root that was properly developed could both attack and defend! While it wasn't as lethal as the fire spirit root or as invulnerable as the metal spirit root's defense, it had well-rounded abilities!</p>

    <p>The greatest advantage of the earth spirit root, moreover, was that it could disregard the terrain!</p>

    <p>Even in a cultivation world, it was still earth that was under the feet of cultivators!</p>

    <p>"What do we do?"</p>

    <p>Neither the killers nor the black shadow soldiers planned to kill anyone. The former wanted to grab homework, while the latter wanted to block the killers.</p>

    <p>They were two different forces, and enemies to boot... But Teacher Pan's appearance had thrown the battle situation into disarray and these two factions were both considered assassins!</p>

    <p>"Sword wall!" Following Teacher Pan's low cry, the spirit sword in the ground began to tremble, and there was a violent sound of an earthquake on the street before a wall of earth tens of meters tall rose out of the ground. The wall resembled a precious sword, springing out of the ground like a bamboo shoot!</p>

    <p>When the killers and black shadow soldiers heard Teacher Pan's words, the corners of their lips twitched.</p>

    <p>Cheap... bitch <sup>2</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>("Sword wall" and "cheap bitch" share the same pinyin.)</dfn>

    <p>How could this teacher of the people swear at others?!</p>

    <p>Behind the earth wall, Teacher Pan was still on high alert. She didn't know how long the wall would be able to ward off the attack, but at least it could buy their side some time.</p>

    <p>Someone had already sounded the alarm, and the cultivation police were on their way.</p>

    <p>As soon as reinforcements arrived, the curtain would fall on this dramatic farce.</p>

    <p>The leader of this group of killers knew they were running out of time. Whether they succeeded or failed, they could only give it a try. "You lot, jump over and cut them off! If there's an opportunity, grab the thing, otherwise retreat if there really is no other choice! The rest of you, follow me and stall this teacher and this bunch coming out of nowhere!"</p>

    <p>With the clear assignation of tasks, the killers were promptly divided into two groups.</p>

    <p>Seeing this, the black shadow soldiers also hurriedly split into two groups as they rushed over, but the killers who stayed behind were calm and fearless, and wouldn't let them leave.</p>

    <p>"Brother! Do you have to do this? We all have masters to answer to; you should have sensed that we're not here to kill anyone," one of the black shadow soldiers said.</p>

    <p>The two forces looked at each other, neither side giving way. The whole street had fallen into chaos and businesses shut their doors one after another, unwilling to get involved in the fight. Just then, sirens sounded in the distance.</p>

    <p>How could such a brawl not attract the police's attention?</p>

    <p>"Brother! The cultivation police station is sending people over. This sort of confrontation in public is distasteful!" one of the killers replied</p>

    <p>"That's right, it's too distasteful!" The black shadow soldiers also agreed since they understood how serious the situation was</p>

    <p>"Then how about we retreat? Let's fight another day!"</p>

    <p>"Good! Retreat first! Everyone retreat on the count of three!"</p>

    <p>Standing opposite each other, the leaders of both sides counted down from three to one, and the two groups vanished from the street together, escaping into the shadows.</p>

    <p>As for the killers that had been sent after Sun Rong, they also chose to swiftly withdraw after hearing the sirens.</p>

    <p>In the blink of an eye, the auras of both forces disappeared without a trace.</p>

    <p>"They're professional assassins, after all..." Teacher Pan released the earthen sword wall she had set up. The sun shone again, and her figure cast a long shadow on the ground.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Su Xiao looked at this scene from a distance. Chen Chao and Guo Hao also came out of the coffee shop. They had always had a very stereotypical impression of Teacher Pan, but everyone was now deeply moved.</p>

    <p>"Teacher Pan..." Sun Rong and Lin Xiaoyu never expected that in such a moment, faced with over a hundred killers, Teacher Pan would step forward like a female knight. They also never thought that Teacher Pan's figure would become so tall and big on this day.</p>

    <p>"It's nothing, I was just doing what I had to do."</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan put the spirit sword away and pushed up her glasses. "I. Am. A. Teacher!"</p>

    <p>"Old Pan!!"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao shouted excitedly at the coffee shop entrance, "Old Pan! You're 2.8 metres <sup>3</sup> tall today!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(2.8m is slang for someone
impressive or domineering,
and is often used to describe
someone who has done
something admirable ..)</dfn>

    <p>Teacher Pan's smile vanished.</p>

    <p>It could only be said that as a vanguard teacher of Number 60 High, Teacher Pan was in the end Teacher Pan; even when she was being praised, her expression was still composed.</p>

    <p>She looked up at Chen Chao and Guo Hao standing at the coffee shop entrance and said, "So you've finally come out."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao and Guo Hao: "???"</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan: "Before I left the office, I heard you two making noise inside the coffee shop's private room about copying homework."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao and Guo Hao: "..."</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan: "Both of you, give me your homework. I'm going to wipe it clean."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao and Guo Hao wanted to cry, but had no tears to shed.</p>

    <p>They never thought that coming out today, not only would they fail to copy homework, the sections they had done would even be wiped completely clean...</p>

    <p>Tragic!</p>

    <p>Too tragic...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Su Xiao, Sun Rong and Lin Xiaoyu observed a moment of silence for them.</p>
