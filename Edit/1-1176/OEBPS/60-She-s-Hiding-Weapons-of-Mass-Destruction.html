  <h1>Chapter 60 She's Hiding Weapons of Mass Destruction </h1>

  <div>

      

      <p>It wasn't just Jiang Liuying and Wang Ming who were stunned as they stared at the hole in the wall; even the woman on the other end of the phone call was dumbstruck.</p>

      <p>Obviously, words alone were utterly unable to describe and directly convey the impact and shock of the scene in front of their eyes.</p>

      <p>What Jiang Liuying saw was a black cat with protection goggles on and one hand resting on a battery pack at its waist as it stared at her.</p>

      <p>Everywhere around this black cat were cats as far as the eye could see... on the ground, in the trees... there were even ninja cats wearing black, hanging on the wall. Furthermore, Jiang Liuying realized that most of them were standing on two feet! Bloody hell... if they had wings, wouldn't they be an all-mighty species? Had they been possessed by Happy <sup>1</sup> ?!</p>

      <p>In the last few years, there were plenty of pets that had achieved spiritual enlightenment, but they were all strictly regulated by Huaxiu nation's Quarantine Department.</p>

      <p>With this huge gathering of spiritually enlightened stray cats, some even wielding a terrifying Yidali Cannon... Jiang Liuying felt that this scope and power were comparable to a small-scale demon rampage.</p>

      <p>The reason why the Gate Between Worlds was so frightening lay not just in the catastrophic might of the demons, but more in their organization and discipline.</p>

      <p>Each time the demons invaded the earth from the Gate Between Worlds, it was always after they had already talked it over and settled on an invasion plan.</p>

      <p>The current situation was far beyond Jiang Liuying's expectations.</p>

      <p>This was obviously a premeditated rescue operation...</p>

      <p>And the party executing this rescue operation... was actually a bunch of cats?!</p>

      <p>The woman on the other end of the phone call sounded baffled. "Are you... still asleep?"</p>

      <p>"Sis, I'm really not joking... believe it or not, I've really been surrounded by a bunch of cats... oh, no, a troop of cats. Especially the black cat that's their leader, it's staring at me with lust!"</p>

      <p>Hei Tan <sup>2</sup> : "..." <em>Fucking hell, you dare to defame this father <sup>3</sup> </em><em>?!</em></p>

      <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Hei Tan literally translates to 'black Tan' to describe Zheng Tan's black fur.)</dfn>

      <dfn><sup>3</sup>(In Chinese, people sometimes refer to themselves with elder family positions like father, grand aunt and so on, in either an arrogant or teasing way, to emphasize status or capability.)</dfn>

      <p>On the other end of the phone call, the woman went quiet. After an enigmatic silence, she spoke once again. "I think there really is something wrong with your brain, are you not feeling like yourself right now? Why don't we cancel the mission this time?"</p>

      <p>"Sis, let me explain!" Jiang Liuying spluttered at her elder sister's words.</p>

      <p>Without waiting for her to continue, the woman on the other end went on to say, "...To be on the safe side, I'll give you half an hour to return."</p>

      <p>After saying this, the woman directly ended the call, leaving Jiang Liuying no opportunity to explain the situation as she stood in front of the troop of cats with a dumbfounded look on her face.</p>

      <p>After staring blankly for a while, she finally rolled up her sleeves and pouted at this bunch of cats. "You puny gits, do you think this grand aunt is afraid of you?!"</p>

      <p>She was formidable, and different from most Golden Core cultivators. With one glance, Wang Ling's radar-like eyes had seen through to her true strength — she was a rare cultivator with two golden cores! They lay in her <em>dantian </em>region, and together, made her ten times stronger than a cultivator at the peak Golden Core stage!</p>

      <p>The oppressive force generated by the girl's anger was very obvious. Even if it was only a small wave of emotion, it was enough to make Wang Ming's cheeks ripple.</p>

      <p>Although enlightened, Zheng Tan was only a cat at the Foundation Establishment stage at best. The oppressive force which the girl had generated was already enough to make its black fur stand on end. Similarly, the entire division of cats behind it all looked like hedgehogs with their fur sticking up.</p>

      <p>All of a sudden, a bald cat burst out of the crowd and snarled, "Watch out, Regiment Commander!"</p>

      <p>Battalion One's commander, The Monk, threw itself at Zheng Tan. Even some of the cat guards behind it followed its action and also threw themselves one after another at Zheng Tan.</p>

      <p>Honestly speaking, Zheng Tan was very moved since they were protecting it, after all... but it almost suffocated under tens of cats suddenly piling on top of it and pinning it down!</p>

      <p>"What on earth are you doing..." With a sour face, Zheng Tan popped its black head out from deep within the pile of cats.</p>

      <p>"Protecting the boss, be careful of her chest <sup>4</sup> !" several cats cried out in unison.</p>

      <dfn><sup>4</sup>(The Chinese word 胸器 used here is a mix of two words that have the same pinyin, xiongqi: 胸器 which can mean 'perky breasts'and 凶器 which is a 'lethal weapon.')</dfn>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p>The Monk nodded. "This woman's chest is much bigger than that of a normal human woman's, so I highly suspect it contains weapons of mass destruction."</p>

      <p>Zheng Tan: "..."</p>

      <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

      <p>Even Wang Ming gasped, stunned by these cats speaking human language and astonished at how fluent they were.</p>

      <p>As the most powerful brain in Huaxiu nation, he could broadly estimate how intelligent these cats were. The black cat that was the leader had the highest IQ, and the bald cat next to it had the second highest IQ. For animals, Wang Ming felt that their IQs were possibly higher than a regular human's. Of course, there was no way that their IQs would surpass his.</p>

      <p>Wang Ming looked at the girl. "Hey, elder sister, haven't you noticed?"</p>

      <p>"???" Jiang Liuying had a blank look on her face, and for the first time, Wang Ling and Wang Ming, these two brothers at odds, shared a tacit understanding. There was a saying, big breasts and no brains... looking at it now, it really wasn't an unreasonable saying.</p>

      <p>"Elder sister, with your realm, you can crush a Golden Core cultivator with one hand. But haven't you notice that your oppressive force isn't the least bit of use at the moment? These cats may have spiritual intelligence, but they're not that powerful... yet now, even under your oppressive force, they're still so lively."</p>

      <p>This time, realization suddenly hit the girl as beads of sweat started to form on her small, fair face.</p>

      <p>She should have noticed it earlier!</p>

      <p>This bunch of kitties, along with this man who had no spirit energy at all, should have been immobilized under her oppressive force... but these cats were actually still frolicking around?</p>

      <p>Taking every factor into consideration, the girl could think of only one possibility! — There was a nature-defying person here with a more formidable realm than hers! Only such a person could exert an impact on the fluctuations of her oppressive force and prevent it from taking effect from the start, like suddenly blocking the mouth of a dam.</p>

      <p>...Who the hell was it?</p>

      <p>Jiang Liuying's gaze swept swiftly over the horde of cats, and at the same time she bombarded them with her spiritual senses, trying her best to detect a particular aura among them. At this moment, it seemed that the girl's brain power had finally caught up, and she began to suspect that there was something fishy about these cats. For example, a master could have used the Transformation Spell or something like an illusion technique to sneak into their midst.</p>

      <p>If this really was the case, it was sometimes possible to pick the person out by carefully distinguishing the auras.</p>

      <p>However, this ability to identify auras only applied if there was a minor gap in realms between the two individuals in question.</p>

      <p>To be honest, if there had been time, Wang Ling would certainly have calmly played with the girl for a while.</p>

      <p>But now was not the time for hide-and-seek...</p>

      <p>There were only ten minutes left before the end of the world!</p>

      <p>Thus, under Jiang Liuying's utterly stunned gaze, a black-and-white Persian cat strolled elegantly through this large crowd of cats, which conscientiously parted to give way to it.</p>

      <p>So this was the cat...</p>

      <p>The girl was instantly vigilant, but just as she was about to call up her spirit energy, this Persian cat released a strong power which pressed down on her.</p>

      <p>Then, the girl was shocked to realize that her spirit energy had only moved halfway, and was actually stuck in her <em>dantian </em>! What was more, she found herself in the grip of an oppressive force, completely immobilized!</p>

      <p>This Persian cat... was it a freak?!</p>
