  <h1>Chapter 1135 Mysterious Sea's Appearance</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Sun Rong's ability to control her spirit sword had already reached perfection, to the point that she could regularly open up a sword spirit space as well as summon her sword spirit even if her sword wasn't with her.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was the only person in Number 60 High's elite stream who already had a sword spirit. This was what everyone currently understood... Of course, this knowledge obviously didn't take Wang Ling and the others into account.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong planned to summon Mysterious Sea to send them up in a column of water, so she definitely had to summon Mysterious Sea's true sword spirit form.</p>

    <p>And this would actually be everyone's first time seeing Mysterious Sea's appearance.</p>

    <p>"Has anyone ever seen Classmate Sun Rong's sword spirit?" Li Youyue asked curiously.</p>

    <p>Mysterious Sea... It sounded like the name of an uncle, but a sword spirit took after its master, and its specific appearance was based on what its master preferred.</p>

    <p>Could it be that Classmate Sun Rong was actually a secret uncle fan?</p>

    <p>Li Youyue didn't think it was impossible.</p>

    <p>In an era bursting with fresh young meat, a lot of girls were actually tired of male stars with fair faces, high nose bridges, straight eyebrows and double eyelids. Conversely, the suave uncle look was even more attractive!</p>

    <p>But everyone else also had their own ideas about what Mysterious Sea looked like.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "I haven't seen Mysterious Sea either, but it shouldn't have dead fish eyes, right?"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Wang Ling's eyelids twitched violently, as he felt that there was something implied in the words.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong deliberately kept them guessing. She closed her eyes and began the summoning in earnest. Like everyone said, she had never revealed Mysterious Sea's real appearance in public, and had sometimes even gotten Mysterious Sea to disguise itself for its own protection.</p>

    <p>But this was a national event, and so many people were watching. Sun Rong felt that there was no longer any need to hide.</p>

    <p>She was the captain of the team this time. In the face of the initial show of strength by Zhu Hanyun, captain of Titan High, and Gao Tianming, captain of Devil-Subduing High, she naturally wouldn't admit defeat easily.</p>

    <p>In terms of momentum at least, she wouldn't be the first to lose!</p>

    <p>"Boundless sea, eastward tide..." The incantation was followed by a ray of blue light that started to glow behind Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>For a moment, it was as if everyone could smell the salty scent of the rolling sea; it really was as if they were next to the sea and could vaguely hear the sound of the rolling waves.</p>

    <p>The teachers maintaining order on the field noticed the activity here and were astonished.</p>

    <p>A Foundation Establishment student had actually produced a sword spirit?</p>

    <p>It was unfathomable to them. Moreover, judging from the aura, this sword spirit clearly hadn't been formed recently; this was an old sword spirit with a very "mature" aura.</p>

    <p>It was very easy to discern whether a sword spirit was a newborn or not; a newly conceived sword spirit was just like a newborn baby, and would give off a "milky" scent.</p>

    <p>Mysterious Sea didn't have this scent.</p>

    <p>After the blue light glowed for a while, a girl in a sea-blue dress fell from the sky; even her hair was dark blue with silver streaks, and she radiated a youthful vitality.</p>

    <p>Looking at Mysterious Sea's appearance, everyone was enlightened.</p>

    <p>So, Mysterious Sea's true form was that of a magical girl?</p>

    <p>This was a reasonable outcome. After all, Mysterious Sea had been conceived early, and Sun Rong hadn't been very old at that time. The magical girl transformation was something every girl had probably imagined at one point in their childhood. Looking at Mysterious Sea's appearance, Wang Ling instantly recalled the very nostalgic "Clow Cards."</p>

    <p>It was something that people of Wang Ling's age would remember from their childhood, at least.</p>

    <p>"Then, next, please lend me your spiritual energy, everyone!" Sun Rong smiled. The two girls, Liu Qingyi and Li Youyue, were the first to step forward and grab her hands. One after another, each of the boys put their hand on the shoulder of the person in front of them.</p>

    <p>This was in fact the pose that two chuuni kids who read wuxia novels would act out to pass strength to each other, which was also indescribably nostalgic.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao felt a little bashful. He put one hand on Li Youyue's right shoulder and covered his face with the other.</p>

    <p>"Everybody, stand firm." After a few moments of preparation, Sun Rong repeated the incantation again. Tremendous waves of spirit power burst forth from Mysterious Sea, and a huge column of water bubbled up like a fountain under the feet of the Number 60 High students.</p>

    <p>And then, boom! With a loud bang, a huge column of water shot into the sky!</p>

    <p>"It worked!" Sun Rong was thrilled! She had thought that the combined spiritual energy of ten people might not be enough, and had never expected it to be so effective!</p>

    <p>Soon, Number 60 High's water column also drew the gazes of countless people. The students climbing the stairs were attracted by the water column... and then were horrified.</p>

    <p>"WTF? Which high school is this? The school uniform is so ugly! It even has the word 'ELITE' on the back..."</p>

    <p>"Why does it look like Number 60 High?" Someone tried to make out the figures of the Number 60 High group who flew past the window.</p>

    <p>"You're right, it's Number 60 High! That's where Zhuo Yi graduated from! But I remember that their overall ranking isn't very high. How can they be this amazing?" Someone was puzzled.</p>

    <p>All the students on the stairs made "lemon<sup>1</sup>" sounds.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Sour and jealous.)</dfn>

    <p>Someone scoffed. "Amazing? Their captain is Sun Rong; she's the only one who's slightly more amazing. The rest don't look like much. They still can't compare with Titan High and Devil-Subduing High."</p>

    <p>Some people snorted disdainfully.</p>

    <p>Because Number 60 High's overall ranking wasn't high, the students who were still climbing the stairs absolutely refused to admit that Number 60 High could surpass them.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High?</p>

    <p>How could it?</p>

    <p>A cultivation high school that wasn't even a key city high school...</p>

    <p>But no matter how sour they felt, facts were facts, and they felt very helpless. Number 60 High was a dark horse no one had expected. No one could imagine that a high school which had always ranked last in the district ranking would actually stand out in the first round of a national competition.</p>

    <p>Just then, there was another loud bang in the air!</p>

    <p>It was followed by a violent shock wave which almost caused some of the students climbing the stairs to fall.</p>

    <p>"Now what?" someone asked uncomprehendingly.</p>

    <p>"It's Titan High! And Devil-Subduing High! It looks like they're attacking Number 60 High!"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, everybody turned their eyes to the window, and poked their necks out to look at the top.</p>

    <p>It seemed that the two schools that had been the first to reach the top really were attacking Number 60 High, which was charging upward.</p>

    <p>A dazzling array of spirit lights glowed at the top, and a wave of attack spells were aimed right at Number 60 High's ascending column of water!</p>
