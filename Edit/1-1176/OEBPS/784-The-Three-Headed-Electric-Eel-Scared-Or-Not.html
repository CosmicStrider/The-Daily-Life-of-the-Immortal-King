  <h1>Chapter 784 The Three-Headed Electric Eel, Scared Or Not?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When the ultimate Yin spirit beast as the emblem of the Five Yin Lightning revealed its form, the students let out cries of surprise. Given how close they were to the scene, it simply felt like they were watching a blockbuster with special effects at close range and surround sound, which was a mind-blowing experience.</p>

    <p>At school, even a duel between two Golden Core teachers was unusual enough, so this competition of power between two Itinerant Immortals was indeed an experience that was hard to come by for most high school kids.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling already knew that after this contest, a lot of the students would definitely write this down in their summer camp diaries.</p>

    <p>This was rare source material that had been offered up on a platter - most importantly, they could pad their diaries with words.</p>

    <p>Writing about the fight between cultivators was the easiest way to make up words!</p>

    <p>As long as your vocabulary was good enough, you could spend several hundred words describing a skill used!</p>

    <p>And thousands of words on describing the clash between the two!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was familiar with this method.</p>

    <p>Since Father Wang was a perfect representation of it...</p>

    <p>It was said that all website novelists did was churn out words, and how good they were depended on whether or not it made their readers happy.</p>

    <p>Hm, this was straying from the subject...</p>

    <p>Back to the fight.</p>

    <p>This purple spirit Yin eel which Wu Zhenjun had summoned was the one which Irascible Dharmaraja had tamed back then. After Wu Zhenjun had inherited his legacy, this thousand-year-old eel naturally fell into his hands.</p>

    <p>But he was usually reluctant to summon it.</p>

    <p>As the emblem of ultimate Yin, the eel's tremendous Yin energy was a heavy burden on Wu Zhenjun's body. Even if he had a peak Yang body, it would still take him a month at the very least to recover.</p>

    <p>And most crucially, during this month, he! Had! To! Be! Abstinent!</p>

    <p>Otherwise, the consequences of his Yang energy leaking out wouldn't just be a burden on his body; it would create extremely problematic side effects for Wu Zhenjun later on.</p>

    <p>And the most serious side effect of them all was permanent impotence...</p>

    <p>So when Wu Zhenjun produced this purple spirit Yin eel, Wang Ming had already used the global database to analyze Wu Zhenjun's next move.</p>

    <p>This was an ultimate move created by Irascible Dharmaraja, and the only level six sound wave destructive spell which needed to be performed in cooperation with the purple spirit Yin eel â€”"Buddha Lightning Combo."</p>

    <p>Hence, this was going to be a tough test for Wang Ming and his Wang Ling One invention.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The biggest advantage which sound wave spells had over other types of spells was its short casting time.</p>

    <p>If one had to know, some complicated, destructive spells might only need to be recited with a hand seal, but took a very long time to cast.</p>

    <p>Thus, when the purple spirit Yin eel revealed its large, glossy tail under everyone's gazes, Wang Ming knew that the true contest had already begun. At that moment, the entire black pool under his feet was the eel's domain.</p>

    <p>Using the mecha armor to perform a detailed analysis, Wang Ming discovered that this purple spirit Yin eel was more than forty zhang in length. It crackled with purple electricity, and looked like a rain dragon in a sea of mud. Most importantly, Wang Ming realized... that this eel actually had three heads! Any female live streamer would have no choice but to concede defeat against this three-headed electric eel<sup>1</sup>!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup></sup>(A reference to a live streamer who stuck a live eel up her vagina...)</dfn>

    <p>"Lao Gudong Xiaoer, do watch yourself," Wu Zhenjun warned in a low voice.</p>

    <p>The three-headed electric eel had already swum over to him, before it unexpectedly soared into the air and coiled its thick and glossy body in front of Wu Zhenjun.</p>

    <p>A turbulent wind roared and the black pool below roiled. Even the air started to warp as in a split second, fierce purple lightning ruthlessly lashed out within the entire space inside the barrier.</p>

    <p>It had only been several dozen seconds since the purple spirit Yin eel was summoned, but in a flash, the entire environment inside the barrier had changed dramatically to resemble the end of the world.</p>

    <p>The space was radically compressed until it was almost entirely occupied by Wu Zhenjun - the magnetic shield with a three-zhang radius which encompassed Wang Ming looked like the last pure land at the end of the world.</p>

    <p>Many people were inwardly apprehensive when they saw this. If Wang Ming hadn't opened up the magnetic shield at that moment, what would have happened?</p>

    <p>Unhurried and patient, Wu Zhenjun slowly walked toward the coiled body of the purple spirit Yin eel in the air, then took a deep breath before his mouth moved closer.</p>

    <p>Now, even those who hadn't known at all how this spell worked at first could see that this was a special "electric horn"!</p>

    <p>"There's even this kind of operation?"</p>

    <p>A lot of the teachers were stunned.</p>

    <p>Although they had long heard of the "Buddha Lightning Combo" ultimate move created by Irascible Dharmaraja, they were still stupefied when they saw it with their own eyes. To actually use the coiled body of an electric eel as a horn - what kind of incredible operation was this?!</p>

    <p>The head of state, who was secretly observing the fight from a distance, similarly froze at this scene, and almost instinctively recognized the danger in this technique.</p>

    <p>"Your Excellency Head of State..." Old Qi was anxious. While he wasn't at the scene, he knew how dangerous this technique was.</p>

    <p>In the end, Wang Ling One was a suit of armor which Wang Ming had built himself outside; without any official computational data simulations, they had no idea how strong it was.</p>

    <p>President Qi was concerned that Wang Ming would be utterly crushed with this move by Wu Zhenjun.</p>

    <p>Huaxiu Alliance's logistics department had only just sent back the coffin that had been custom-made for Wang Ming...</p>

    <p>"There's no rush, I'm here."</p>

    <p>Finally, the head of state shook his head and didn't step in to intervene.</p>

    <p>That was because he didn't feel any panic from Wang Ming at all.</p>

    <p>This enhanced electric horn had indeed caught Wang Ming off guard.</p>

    <p>From the data analysis in the global database, Irascible Dharmaraja had summoned the purple spirit Yin eel back then to perform the Buddha Lightning Combo using its purple lightning, but this wasn't what Wu Zhenjun was doing.</p>

    <p>Wu Zhenjun had obviously modified this move, but he hadn't used it in public for a very long time.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling One thus had no way of analyzing it.</p>

    <p>"Lao Gudong Xiaoer, you've already lost," Wu Zhenjun said through the electric eel horn.</p>

    <p>This wasn't the official Buddha Lightning Combo - Wu Zhenjun was only speaking normally, but it already turned into an extremely powerful sound wave.</p>

    <p>As if it was coming from outer space, Wu Zhenjun's voice echoed unceasingly through the many layers of the space barrier, and a lot of the students and teachers covered their ears at the piercing sound.</p>

    <p>Thanks to the barrier, they weren't directly affected by this force - 99.9% of it was contained within the barrier. Despite that, many of the students and teachers present still couldn't bear the ear-piercing sound wave, which felt a lot like a cat scratching its nails down a blackboard.</p>

    <p>It was a good thing that it was the head of state who had put this barrier up himself, otherwise any barrier built by the teachers working together would probably already have been blown apart.</p>

    <p>"Maybe not."</p>

    <p>Contrary to everyone's expectations, Wang Ming gave a light, straightforward response.</p>

    <p>And then, he raised his hand to the sky.</p>
