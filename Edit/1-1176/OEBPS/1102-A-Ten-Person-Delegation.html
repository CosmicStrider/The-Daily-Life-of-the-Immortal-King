  <h1>Chapter 1102 A Ten-Person Delegation</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Who knew whether it was because he felt he and Wang Ling were kindred spirits, or because his granddaughter liked Wang Ling, but as Old Man Sun listened to Headmaster Chen and swiftly analyzed the situation, he grew more satisfied the more he heard about Wang Ling. Although it wasn't to the extent of marriage, Sun Yiyuan felt that Wang Ling was someone Sun Rong could date.</p>

    <p>Of course, Sun Yiyuan himself couldn't guarantee that there would be feelings, but he felt that even if they didn't wind up together in the end, being friends was also good.</p>

    <p>In contrast, he didn't have the slightest interest in Xia Ming; it could even be said that he was set against him.</p>

    <p>What made this person think he could meddle when it came to who Old Man Sun's granddaughter wanted to date - the boy had even specially challenged Wang Ling to a duel, but not only didn't he win, he himself was severely injured instead.</p>

    <p>How could a person like this protect his granddaughter?</p>

    <p>Walking stick in hand, Old Man Sun's mind spun with various thoughts.</p>

    <p>While he was dissatisfied with Xia Ming, he couldn't show it outright, so he took a deep breath and asked, "How is Student Xia Ming?"</p>

    <p>"He's still in the hospital."</p>

    <p>"Is his condition serious?"</p>

    <p>"He's fine."</p>

    <p>"Our company will pay his medical fees," said Sun Yiyuan.</p>

    <p>"That won't do..."</p>

    <p>"It's nothing; then, it's decided." Old Man Sun was resolute, and Headmaster Chen naturally couldn't do anything.</p>

    <p>This chairman's style was to keep this word.</p>

    <p>Of course, apart from paying the medical fees, Old Man Sun actually had his own plan.</p>

    <p>After asking Headmaster Chen about Xia Ming's situation, he quickly made a call to Huaguo Water Curtain Group's finance department, and didn't scruple to turn the speaker on so that Headmaster Chen could listen in on the conversation from the side.</p>

    <p>"Is that Little Zhang in the finance department?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, Chairman, this is Zhang Jie. Do you have any instructions?"</p>

    <p>"Go to Peiyuan City Hospital's trauma unit and find a patient called Xia Ming, in Room 207."</p>

    <p>"Yes, Chairman. May I ask, what do you want me to do?"</p>

    <p>"Take our legal team with you and have a chat with him. Ask him how much money he wants to leave my granddaughter alone."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>After hearing that, Headmaster Chen took a deep breath.</p>

    <p>What was this bullshit melodramatic novel plot?!</p>

    <p>It could be said that this conversation was completely out of the blue, and Headmaster Chen was dumbfounded when he heard it.</p>

    <p>But it wasn't over yet.</p>

    <p>"Chairman, out of curiosity, is this Student Xia Ming the one from the live broadcast yesterday..."</p>

    <p>"You also know?"</p>

    <p>"I... I heard about it."</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan furrowed his brow. Unexpectedly, this matter had a negative impact!</p>

    <p>Logically speaking, staff in the finance department were too busy to pay a matter like this any heed; when they weren't handling outside affairs, they were working overtime to complete the accounts. But even the finance department staff knew of this incident, which displeased Old Man Sun. Indeed, its impact exceeded what he had imagined - the main thing was that it damaged his granddaughter's reputation.</p>

    <p>After the live broadcast yesterday, he had already shelled out a great deal of money to crack down on the incident and stop the media from reporting it. But while he had managed to block the major media outlets, the online accounts which took advantage of this momentum weren't as easy to stop.</p>

    <p>"The person who told you, where did they find out about it?"</p>

    <p>"From a company group chat. The impact of this incident isn't actually as big as Chairman imagines. I also had a look at those Weibo accounts, and all the videos have been completely deleted," said this finance department staff member.</p>

    <p>Completely deleted? Who was it? (It was Wang Ming.)</p>

    <p>Old Man Sun was startled.</p>

    <p>He definitely didn't have that much ability, and he hadn't hired anyone to do it.</p>

    <p>Forget it - it was good that it wasn't being spread over the Internet.</p>

    <p>"Before you go to the hospital later, scan the group chat records and see who is it that likes to gossip so much. Have him collect his salary from the finance department and tell him to beat it right away"</p>

    <p>"Yes, Chairman." Little Zhang shivered on the other end of the phone. "Then, the compensation for Student Xia Ming..."</p>

    <p>"Do as you see fit. If it's under ten million, you don't have to report it to me," said Old Man Sun.</p>

    <p>"Yes, right away."</p>

    <p>And so, the call ended.</p>

    <p>The truth was that Sun Yiyuan didn't think that Xia Ming was worth ten million, but to ensure that things worked out, it was necessary to use the right amount of money as bait.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Hanging up, Old Man Sun looked at Headmaster Chen and smiled. "I'm sorry that Headmaster Chen had to see that."</p>

    <p>"No, no..." Like that staff member of the finance department, Headmaster Chen also shivered. "May I ask, Mr Sun - do you deal with every person who confesses to Student Sun Rong like this..."</p>

    <p>"Money is the most straightforward method. Of course, the main thing is that this matter has blown up too much, and I'm afraid that Student Xia might be unwilling to give up and still have some ideas about Rongrong. Most people do know how to back off and let go of impractical thoughts; these are the ones that don't need to be bribed with money," said Sun Yiyuan.</p>

    <p>Money was nothing to him; there was nothing he couldn't do, with money.</p>

    <p>"I heard that Peiyuan district's body technique exchange meet is happening soon? Will Student Wang Ling be taking part?" Old Man Sun asked as he changed the subject at that moment.</p>

    <p>"About that... the name list isn't fixed yet," replied Headmaster Chen.</p>

    <p>He wasn't being evasive; it really hadn't been fixed yet.</p>

    <p>Until now, Headmaster Chen had still been dithering over the ten-person delegation. This was because only five of them would truly compete, and the other five were reserve participants.</p>

    <p>The few transfer students who had just entered the school this semester were very strong, but they were new, after all, and Headmaster Chen didn't think it was very good to send them out right away as their main force. Thus, the name list for the primary participants had yet to be fixed so far.</p>

    <p>He didn't stop the fight between Xia Ming and Wang Ling previously because he wanted to figure out which one of the two would be the better choice for the main force.</p>

    <p>In the end, after Old Man Sun's words, Headmaster Chen immediately made a decision.</p>

    <p>He went on to say, "Although the name list isn't fixed yet... Student Wang Ling has been confirmed as our main force. He prevailed over Student Xia Ming in the confrontation yesterday; whether it was by luck or strength, this is an indisputable fact."</p>

    <p>"Mm, a sensible decision." Listening to Headmaster Chen's words, Sun Yiyuan was instantly cheerful. He stood up and shook hands with Headmaster Chen. "Number 60 High is fortunate to have such a smart headmaster!"</p>

    <p>As an elderly, Old Man Sun clearly didn't know that the word "smart" had already been twisted in today's culture.</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen understood the younger generation very well, and when he first heard this word, he thought that he was being disparaged...</p>
