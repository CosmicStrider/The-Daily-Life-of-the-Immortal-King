  <h1>Chapter 311 We Are Focused On the Wrong Thing </h1>

  <div>

    <p>The extermination of Immortal Mansion thus headlined the evening news on all major channels, whether it was government or regional media. Its impact was no less inferior to the old devil's arrest previously. As he watched the news, Wang Ling thought in his heart that it was a good thing that he had hidden the holy beast away, otherwise those scary animal lovers groups would take advantage of this event to kick up a fuss.</p>

    <p>It wasn't wrong to love animals, but overprotection could often be torture.</p>

    <p>The holy beasts were originally formed through the coalescence of the spirit energy of heaven and earth, and since ancient times had relied on the evolutionary strength of bloodlines. In modern terms, it was evolution and mutation. In fact, there hadn't been many holy beasts in ancient times to begin with, and they had now almost completely died out. Now, a silver unicorn had been discovered at long last; simply just handing it over would truly be a pity.</p>

    <p>Of course, in Wang Ling's eyes, holy beasts were actually a type of "animal," and in most situations, it was only right that the "animal's" will itself was given more consideration.</p>

    <p>The extermination of a dark force powerhouse would naturally cause some to feel glad and some to be grieved.</p>

    <p>On the top floor of the most luxurious office building in Jiashi Square in downtown Songhai city, the Lady of the Castle, secretary to the Lord of Mo Immortal Castle, couldn't sit still.</p>

    <p>She had seen the evening news about Immortal Mansion's annihilation. Winter city was Immortal Mansion's central headquarters, and none of the hundreds of people inside, from the elders to the disciples to the core members, had been exempted! The rest of their smaller forces scattered across the country were also being cleaned up one by one by local police working together.</p>

    <p>The Master of Immortal Mansion was a peak late-stage Itinerant Immortal, but when he had been arrested, he looked as if he had been sick for a long time, given his shrivelled appearance and graying hair... what on earth had he gone through?</p>

    <p>The Lady leaned back against the huge sofa, her expression a little absent-minded. She had worked overtime last night wiping clean all accounts between Mo Immortal Castle and Immortal Mansion. Although the fire hadn't touched Mo Immortal Castle, she still felt fearful.</p>

    <p>What kind of person had Immortal Mansion offended?</p>

    <p>While she was pondering this, a shadow suddenly covered the initially clear French windows. Startled by the figure reflected on the window, the Lady hurriedly stood up and bowed. "My Lord!"</p>

    <p>The shadow gave a gentle "Mm," and then stepped out. When it touched the floor, numerous crows appearing out of thin air like a tide. When they scattered, a somber-faced, middle-aged man with a beard and long hair instantly appeared in front of the Lady.</p>

    <p>The bearded man gave the Lady a look, and without a shred of politeness, sat down and leaned back in the boss's chair as he waved a hand at her. "Don't just stand there! Go and make me a cup of milk tea. The fresh milk you made last time from the eight-hundred-year old rhinoceros horn milk powder was pretty good. Bring that to me, and add two lumps of sugar."</p>

    <p>"Very well... my Lord..." The Lady's mouth twitched. She hadn't expected the Lord to personally show up at all. The cupboards in her office were filled with high-quality tea, but there was one can of milk powder which had been specifically prepared for this leader. In Mo Immortal Castle, she was the only one who knew that the Lord had a special liking for milk.</p>

    <p>"Have you finished sorting out the business with Immortal Mansion?" the man tsked and asked as the Lady dissolved the milk powder in water. The sound made her hand tremble as she held the spoon.</p>

    <p>She nodded. "Rest assured, my Lord. All our recorded dealings with them have been wiped clean; no one will be able to trace anything back to us."</p>

    <p>"Weren't there those two girls before? One was called Ah Zuo and the other was Ah You. Both of them went after Song Qingshu, but one is now lying half-dead in the hospital and the other is already dead," the middle-aged man said, sitting in the boss's chair with his fingers steepled and his chin resting on them. "Although these two girls are from Immortal Mansion's outer sect, we must be especially prudent and avoid giving ourselves away."</p>

    <p>"Ah You is already dead and there is no way to find out where she fell. As for Ah Zuo, I will handle it accordingly. Please rest assured, my Lord."</p>

    <p>The Lady nodded and brought the man a steaming cup of milk tea. After a moment of silence, she lowered her head and asked, "Since my Lord personally came this time, is there anything that you need to tell me in person?"</p>

    <p>The man picked the cup up, blew on it, and directly took a large gulp although it was still hot. His upper lip was covered in a layer of milk foam.</p>

    <p>Only then did he nod contentedly. "Mm... I came this time wasn't really for much; I wanted to talk about what we'll be doing after this."</p>

    <p>"Previously, my venerable self was going to use the stone ghost mask to climb to the top, but before we could get very far, that devil got caught before he had popped up again for even half a month."</p>

    <p>The Lady: "..."</p>

    <p>"Then my venerable self noticed that Immortal Mansion was developing quite nicely, but before we could pass them a MOU, their core division was wiped out..."</p>

    <p>The Lady: "..."</p>

    <p>"Looking at these situations together, have you noticed something? Both of them have one person in common," the man said.</p>

    <p>The Lady: "Do you mean the Great Death-Courting Senior whom Song Qingshu relied on for help?"</p>

    <p>"No."</p>

    <p>The man shook his head and stared at the Lady. "Have you heard of Zhuo Yi?"</p>

    <p>Him? Realization dawned on the Lady; this was the rising star of the General Administration of 100 Schools.</p>

    <p>"Think about it: from the Shadow Stream incident to the arrest of the old devil and finally the annihilation of Immortal Mansion, aren't all these major events linked together through this person?" The man hmphed. "So, we've been focusing on the wrong thing from the very beginning."</p>

    <p>After that, he stroked his beard, and discovered two drops of milk in it. He quickly swiped them with his finger and then licked his finger clean.</p>

    <p>After licking his finger, he smiled. "Therefore, I think that our focus from now on should be on this man! It's quite possible that this person is responsible for coming up with all the plans, and he's impossible to predict."</p>

    <p>"But Great Death-Courting Senior and that mysterious expert in the villa on the outskirts..."</p>

    <p>"Forget these petty things." The man waved his hand. "My venerable self firmly believes that the root of all this evil begins with this person called Zhuo Yi!"</p>

    <p>The Lady: "..."</p>

    <p>The man stared at the Lady with a very confident expression. "Before coming here, my venerable self investigated this man's past, and I discovered a very interesting person in his high school."</p>

    <p>While speaking, spirit light flashed in his hand.</p>

    <p>The next moment, he was holding a photo, which he passed to the Lady. "Look at this man."</p>

    <p>"This is..." The Lady took the photo and frowned.</p>

    <p>The photo showed a fatty in the middle of teaching. He didn't look very old, perhaps somewhere in his early thirties, and he was leaning against a lectern with a latiao between his fingers.</p>
