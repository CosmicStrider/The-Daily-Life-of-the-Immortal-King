  <h1>Chapter 499 Wang Zilong Is Here! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ming was hiding in a small two-story building. It was a very safe position which Wang Ming's game character "TTXS" had selected after intelligently calculating the safe zone's location after the last circle contraction and the players' nearby travel routes.</p>

    <p>Based on the software's calculation results, the game character would prioritize the safest and closest location with cover and a relatively wide range of view, and move into position itself.</p>

    <p>As a cheats adjudicator specialist, Wang Ming had constantly debugged and improved his anti-cheat software, to the point it felt like the character in the game had a soul of its own and was able to operate automatically.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming didn't even need to use the mouse or keyboard; he just needed to use voice input to issue instructions.</p>

    <p>"TTXS" was currently crouched on the balcony on the second floor of this house. No one could approach him from behind, and whatever direction his muzzle was aimed in, there were sure to be people walking into its view.</p>

    <p>But "TTXS" hadn't occupied this dominant position in the small building for very long when Wang Ming immediately issued a command: "TTXS, move immediately! Find WF's location!"</p>

    <p>Although Father Wang had already said not to worry about the other party, Wang Ming was still a little concerned about the player with the ID "WF."</p>

    <p>Perhaps... this was the intuition of a brother-con!</p>

    <p>Anyway, this "WF" made Wang Ming uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>While the character "TTXS" moved on its own to track down WF's specific location, Wang Ming also swiftly cut out of the screen and his fingers flew over the keyboard as he searched for the terminal code to try and find information on this "WF."</p>

    <p>He had been able to directly modify the data on deaths in the game company's terminal and bring those water friends that had already died back with the "Samsara of Heavenly Life"- looking for information on a person was a piece of cake.</p>

    <p>As Wang Ming worked, President Qi watched from the side, a cup of fairy coffee in his hands. "Tch, is it worth doing all this for a game?"</p>

    <p>"My uncle rarely asks me to help out, of course I have to do it," Wang Ming said.</p>

    <p>"You're doing it for your brother, I suppose?" President Qi asked.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "..."</p>

    <p>President Qi laughed. "Let me remind you, Zhai Yin will be back in thirty minutes."</p>

    <p>As soon as Zhai Yin was mentioned, faint signs of sweat already appeared on Wang Ming's forehead. "There's still time, there's still time..."</p>

    <p>Deliberately chatting inanely with Wang Ming, President Qi in the end realized that it didn't affect Wang Ming's productivity at all. Personal information on players was important data for the game company, and there were many measures in place to protect them. In theory, it was much harder to retrieve personal information than to modify the data on a water friend's death at the terminal.</p>

    <p>It also involved the game company's security measures; what Wang Ming was trying to do now was steal this "WF" ID's player information without being detected by the game company's defense system.</p>

    <p>Judging from Wang Ming's expression, it was too easy...</p>

    <p>Less than a minute later, Wang Ming had already given his IP address the highest level of clearance as he hacked into the game company's computers.</p>

    <p>"Tch, so quick?"</p>

    <p>President Qi couldn't help sighing; when all was said and done, Wang Ming had the strongest brain.</p>

    <p>Back when he had been young, President Qi had also been able to perform similar operations, but in the end he still hadn't been as fast as Wang Ming was now. President Qi felt that in his prime, it would still take him at least five minutes to sneak in and steal a player's information.</p>

    <p>Still, President Qi couldn't help asking, "You infiltrated them so quickly, they shouldn't be able to detect you, right?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming shook his head. "No way - if they find me, I'll cut my brain open for you to take a look."</p>

    <p>President Qi: "Actually... I've always wanted to do that."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "..."</p>

    <p>President Qi: "You can change your name; don't use Wang Xiaoer on your fake ID card anymore... it's so old-fashioned!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "What do you mean, president?"</p>

    <p>President Qi: "Just change your name to Wang Zilong."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "???"</p>

    <p>President Qi laughed. "You're popping in and out of the game company's client information like it's Changban <sup>1</sup> ... shouldn't you give the security consultants some face?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Zilong, more commonly known as Zhao Yun, was a military general who, during the Battle of Changban, went in to save warlord Liu Bei's son and wife ..)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ming: "..."</p>

    <p>While Wang Ming's hack had been a success, retrieving the data still took some time. Regular computers wouldn't be able to analyze this massive amount of data, and it really was difficult to precisely single out one person in the vast swarm of player data - it would have been really impossible without the research institute's computers.</p>

    <p>But speaking about searching for data, it suddenly occurred to Wang Ming that he really had to find time to meet Wang Ling soon.</p>

    <p>The data from the sword qi left behind on the tattered Daoist robe from Daoist Guang had already yielded a reverse trail.</p>

    <p>But the data coordinates were very strange as it seemed to be located inside the Gate Between Worlds and yet not.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming felt that he needed to find time to explain this matter clearly to Wang Ling face to face. The outcome of the data analysis was a series of encryption codes... he wouldn't be able to explain them clearly just through an online chat.</p>

    <p>While Wang Ming was thinking this, the computer search results came out.</p>

    <p>Online games now required user verification.</p>

    <p>This "WF" ID was no exception.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming also saw the real name registered for this ID: Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>"Fang Xing?" Wang Ming scratched his chin.</p>

    <p>Wasn't this the kid who had been harassing his family's Wang Ling recently?</p>

    <p>After seeing this name, Wang Ming made up his mind.</p>

    <p>He was going to get rid of this guy...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, Lord Diulei had already returned after eating his broccoli salad. He saw that his and Wang Ling's characters were still lying unmoving on the roof.</p>

    <p>At that moment, the fourth circle had already shrunk, and the number of people was already less than fifty.</p>

    <p>But he and Wang Ling were still in the center of the safe zone...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei got up to take a look. Actually, he thought that the second half of the game would be a little more interesting now that the circle was a little smaller. At the very least he would be able to spot people on the map and shoot... Since the start of the game, he had yet to use his fully-loaded M416 silencer to shoot any of his 5.56mm bullets!</p>

    <p>"105 Blue House. Someone's on the second floor." At that moment, Lord Diulei suddenly heard Wang Ling's telepathic communication.</p>

    <p>Wow! Finally!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei switched to a 4x scope; he knew it was time for him to show off what he could do.</p>

    <p>When he opened his scope to take a look, sure enough, he could see a figure moving around in the window of the blue house that Wang Ling had mentioned.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, look at me!"</p>

    <p><em>Bang </em>! — A shot!</p>

    <p><em>Bang </em>! — Two shots!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was very confident in his marksmanship. The first shot had knocked the person's helmet off, and the second one had hit his bulletproof vest. As long as his third shot hit the other party in the head, this person would undoubtedly die.</p>

    <p>But when Lord Diulei pulled the trigger a third time, he discovered that this person had already fallen down.</p>

    <p>And the one who had killed him hadn't been Lord Diulei...</p>

    <p>He looked at the top right corner of the public screen.</p>

    <p>WF!</p>

    <p>Fuck! His kill had been stolen from him!</p>
