  <h1>Chapter 660 Perhaps The Most Tragic Villain</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After drinking the juice, it felt like the burning in his throat eased a little.</p>

    <p>But what puzzled Elder Ji Xing was that this bottle of juice didn't taste sweet, and instead had a very strange flavor. Maybe it wasn't watermelon juice, but made from some other spirit fruit. Smacking his lips, Elder Ji Xing felt that the juice was a little thick. Although it wasn't very refreshing, it did indeed moisten his throat.</p>

    <p>"What kind of spirit fruit is this juice made from?"</p>

    <p>When he lifted his head to ask, he realized that it was quiet all around him as unexpectedly, no one gave him an answer. He did a headcount in passing and discovered that they seemed to be missing two people. "Didn't Brothers Mingren and Yaren come?"</p>

    <p>Silence all around.</p>

    <p>Elder Ji Xing: "Someone give me an explanation!"</p>

    <p>Both Mingren or Yaren were very strong members.</p>

    <p>Mingren had inherited the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's bloodline... When he was young, his inability to control the rampaging demon fox inside him had led to several disastrous events. But after studying on Sun Island during this period of time, Old Brother Mingren had successfully mastered the skill of suppressing the demon fox's aura through his diligent cultivation! Now, he was able to use his strength at will in combat.</p>

    <p>If he attacked Number 60 High with this strength and released the demon fox, it would definitely be a crushing blow to the spirits of the teachers and students!</p>

    <p>There was even less to say about Brother Yaren, who had been born with an immortal body like President Bai. The difference was that President Bai had developed his immortal body through cultivation and its foundation could be tempered to become even stronger. Although Brother Yaren had a natural immortal body, resurrection took longer for him; in any case, however, he couldn't die.</p>

    <p>Because they still didn't know what the overall combat strength of that mysterious youngster from Number 60 High was like, Elder Ji Xing had summoned Elder Yaren here from Sun Island.</p>

    <p>"Reporting to Lord Sonico."</p>

    <p>A member called Erzhu replied, "There's a small problem with the demon fox in Brother Mingren's body."</p>

    <p>"How can that be?" Elder Ji Xing was alarmed.</p>

    <p>"The Nine-Tailed Demon Fox was stifled on Sun Island for too long. When it arrived in Huaxiu nation this time, it demanded that Brother Mingren take it to do a straight perm, and trim its fur while they were at it."</p>

    <p>"And... then?"</p>

    <p>"It just wanted the hairdresser to trim its fur a bit, but the hairdresser shaved its nine tails bald, so now it's shut itself away."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Currently, Brother Mingren's taken it for urgent mental therapy."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Elder Ji Xing utterly never expected a mishap like this to happen. He hurriedly picked up this red-colored spirit juice and took a gulp of it to calm his shocked nerves.</p>

    <p>"Then, what about Brother Yaren?"</p>

    <p>For some reason, everyone's complexions seemed to turn unsightly; there was an evasive look in their eyes and their expressions were gloomy, like they had something to say but didn't know whether they should voice it or not. Elder Ji Xing couldn't be any more familiar with this expression: it was the kind of look a doctor wore when they told you that you had a terminal illness!</p>

    <p>Had Brother Yaren met with a serious accident?</p>

    <p>Elder Ji Xing's heart sank and he didn't dare let his imagination run wild.</p>

    <p>He and Yaren had always had a good relationship. Back on Sun Island, when he still hadn't gotten used to the study environment in the beginning, it was Yaren who helped him out time and time again. Not only did Yaren guide him in learning the language, he even lent Elder Ji Xing his homework to copy when the latter hadn't been able to finish it on time. Although copying homework wasn't a good thing to do, it was indeed through this ongoing habit that their friendship deepened!</p>

    <p>But among all those present, the person least likely to encounter a situation had unexpectedly run into a problem.</p>

    <p>Elder Ji Xing never thought something like this could happen.</p>

    <p>Yaren had been born with an immortal body - how could something happen to him so easily?</p>

    <p>Elder Ji Xing had been planning to appoint Yaren as deputy commander of this operation, but given this sudden and unforeseen event, he was caught a little off guard.</p>

    <p>At that moment, the atmosphere in the tent was stifling and even the air felt like it had frozen.</p>

    <p>Almost everyone had their heads lowered, their expressions ashen.</p>

    <p>Actually, Elder Ji Xing could understand the current situation — after all, this mishap had suddenly cropped up on the eve of battle, and Elder Yaren was very popular, so this would impact everyone's mood to a certain degree. No one wanted to see anything happen to Elder Yaren. Elder Ji Xing dropped his eyes; they had sent text greetings to each other just a few days ago.</p>

    <p>Who would have thought something would actually happen.</p>

    <p>Elder Ji Xing took out his powder puff to fix his makeup; this habit helped suppress his nerves and seemed to calm him down.</p>

    <p>After a moment, he broke the silence by taking a deep breath and speaking first. "Anyone who knows the actual situation, please tell me: did Elder Yaren meet an accident?"</p>

    <p>He turned his gaze to Erzhu; in this situation, he couldn't depend on anyone else to have the courage to open their mouths, but Erzhu was different. This person had experienced a lot and had extremely strong mental fortitude; practically nothing could shake him.</p>

    <p>After some careful consideration, Erzhu started to organize his words as he looked at Elder Ji Xing and replied, "Sonico, you should know the ability Teacher Yaren uses the most, right?"</p>

    <p>Most used ability?</p>

    <p>Elder Ji Xing frowned.</p>

    <p>The range of abilities of an immortal body was too broad; he assumed this Brother Erzhu was referring to an ability generated as an extension of an immortal body.</p>

    <p>As Elder Yaren's friend of many years, it could be said that Elder Ji Xing knew Elder Yaren's abilities like the back of his hand.</p>

    <p>Hence, he promptly thought of a spell Elder Yaren had told him about before which had evolved out of the immortal body's wide range of abilities — the Body Transformation Spell.</p>

    <p>After suffering a fatal attack, Elder Yaren could break down his body into thick, slimy lumps which could slowly reassemble together to reconstruct his body, thus making it a type of resurrection spell.</p>

    <p>Seeing Elder Ji Xing's thoughtful expression, this Brother Ezhu said quietly, "Elder Yaren has already cultivated his Body Transformation Spell to the highest level, and it's no longer limited to breaking his body down into lumps of flesh."</p>

    <p>"Then... did Elder Yaren experience a deviation in his cultivation?"</p>

    <p>"No."</p>

    <p>Erzhu shook his head. "Beyond simple lumps of flesh, Elder Yaren is now adept at breaking his body down into fine particles. Before you arrived, Elder Yaren wanted to break himself down and then reassemble himself after you showed up."</p>

    <p>"So, Yaren is here?"</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>"Where is he?"</p>

    <p>"You're drinking him..."</p>
