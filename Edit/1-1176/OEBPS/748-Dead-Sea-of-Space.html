  <h1>Chapter 748 Dead Sea of Space</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ming woke up...</p>

    <p>The first thing he felt was sharp pain, as if his head had been sliced open with a watermelon knife and almost split apart. It was a very long while before Wang Ming recovered slightly from the sensation.</p>

    <p>Even when he moved, he didn't dare make any big movements in case it injured his head.</p>

    <p>When he sat up to determine where he was, two hours had already passed since the moment he had opened his eyes.</p>

    <p>His head hurt so badly that he couldn't think straight. When he sat up, he was wet with sweat and his white coat was already drenched.</p>

    <p>Finally, he could clearly see his surroundings.</p>

    <p>He was in the middle of an aurora...</p>

    <p>Before him was a sea of glass with no end in sight. The splendid colors of an aurora filled the sky as the lights tangled together in a dazzling display.</p>

    <p>Currently, he was sitting on the Heavenly Materials sword which had taken the form of a bamboo raft and which was floating in this sea of glass.</p>

    <p>"Is this the brain pit Old Qi mentioned before..."</p>

    <p>Calming down, Wang Ming recalled how he had arrived here.</p>

    <p>He clearly remembered that he had forcibly performed the Brain Deduction Technique with his overloaded brain in order to save Zhai Yin, hence why he had ended up here.</p>

    <p>If it hadn't been for the Heavenly Materials sword, he would likely already have been torn apart by the storm as soon as he had been sucked into the space...</p>

    <p>All high-end magic swords had a "save master spirit blade" mechanism. Normally, the activation of this mechanism depended on the sword spirit. When its rapport with its master was higher, the sword spirit could come out at a critical moment to block an attack, even at the cost of its own life.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ming's Heavenly Materials sword didn't have a sword spirit. This current "save master" mechanism was nothing more than Wang Ming using scientific means to produce a similar effect.</p>

    <p>When all was said and done, the Heavenly Materials sword was a rare magic sword which Cheng Yu had created at great cost. When he had been redesigning the Heavenly Materials sword, Wang Ming thought that apart from incorporating certain scientific elements into it, he should try to align it as close to a conventional magic sword as possible.</p>

    <p>Simply put, his scientific magic sword had all the functions of a regular magic sword!</p>

    <p>It was just that Wang Ming never thought that his idea back then would actually come in so handy at this moment...</p>

    <p>"Brat... you're awake?"</p>

    <p>Just as Wang Ming was pondering how to get out of here, Ghost Head Blade's voice rang out on the bamboo raft.</p>

    <p>Startled, Wang Ming hurriedly scooted backward. When he looked harder, he realized that Ghost Head Blade really was on the bamboo raft... the Heavenly Materials sword's "save master" mechanism should only work on the sword's owner; Wang Ming was guessing that the Heavenly Materials sword had mistaken Ghost Head Blade's blade form to be Wang Ming's magic treasure, and thus had also saved him...</p>

    <p>This could be regarded as a flaw in Wang Ming's design.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming gnashed his teeth. Who would have thought he would overlook this small detail?</p>

    <p>If he got out of here, he definitely had to fix this bug!</p>

    <p>Hm...</p>

    <p>If...</p>

    <p>He could get out...</p>

    <p>However, Ghost Head Blade seemed to be in much more dire straits than Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>Logically speaking, Ghost Head Blade should absolutely kill Wang Ming, but he wasn't in a hurry to do so now. He lay quietly at the front of the bamboo raft in his blade form, without projecting even the slightest bit of killing intent.</p>

    <p>Or rather, Ghost Head Blade already no longer had the energy to emit killing intent.</p>

    <p>"I never thought that in the end, you and I would actually suffer together... sucked into this Dead Sea of Space." Ghost Head Blade's voice was very weak.</p>

    <p>So this was the Dead Sea of Space?</p>

    <p>Wang Ming narrowed his eyes, and didn't dare make any overly big movements. He had been startled into scooting backward by Ghost Head Blade's voice earlier, and now his head hurt so much it felt like it was going to explode.</p>

    <p>He remembered that Old Qi had told him about cultivation space before. The Dead Sea of Space should be considered a type of spatial turbulence and was better than being in a spatial storm, but a person would still experience the pain of a tear in space when they were first sucked in. The only difference was that the spatial turbulence phenomenon correlated with the Dead Sea of Space, which was a slightly safer environment, while a spatial storm correlated with an even bigger storm... Except for Almighty-level cultivators, most people who entered a spatial storm never came back out.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming stuck out his hand and lightly touched a drop of "water" in this Dead Sea of Space... This was a type of spatial fluid that was extremely buoyant. This spatial fluid was bottomless. A light touch wasn't dangerous, but you absolutely couldn't immerse yourself in it for too long, otherwise it would slowly corrode you inside out, even if you had bones of steel.</p>

    <p>So if he were to throw Ghost Head Blade out of the raft now...</p>

    <p>Instantly, a bold idea struck Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>But it was very quickly dispelled by Ghost Head Blade's voice. "Brat... I know what you're thinking... I warn you, while it now almost hurts too much for me to move, if you dare lay a hand on me, do you think that I won't instantly cut your throat and take you down with me?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming backtracked, his intuition telling him that this wasn't an empty threat.</p>

    <p>Given Ghost Head Blade's current state, he wouldn't be able to seize Wang Ming's body for the time being, but he definitely had the strength to take both of them down together...</p>

    <p>The Heavenly Materials sword had now turned into a bamboo raft to protect him. This was the only weapon Wang Ming had now. If the Heavenly Materials sword was still in its original form, he might still have had the strength to fight Ghost Head Blade, who now had "Residual Blood <sup>1</sup> ." But in a situation where Wang Ming couldn't directly use the Heavenly Materials sword, confronting the enemy would be an illogical choice. After all, he only had a normal body.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Very low health.)</dfn>

    <p>"Of course, I have to save my last bit of strength for getting out of here... If you don't try anything sneaky with me, I naturally won't attack you, since it'll do me no good." Ghost Head Blade laughed bitterly.</p>

    <p>"You still want to get out of here?" Wang Ming was amused. "Once you're sucked into the Dead Sea of Space, unless you can tear the space open yourself, we'll have to wait for the space to get rid of foreign matter and spit us out. How long do you think that will take?"</p>

    <p>Many people had a mistaken notion about the spatial turbulence phenomenon, and thought that after being sucked into it, they would be spat out by the space itself in a few hours.</p>

    <p>It was true that the Dead Sea of Space would spit living things out in a few hours in real time, but time flowed at a different rate here compared with the real world. One day of drifting in the Dead Sea of Space was only ten minutes in the outside world.</p>

    <p>"Looks like you know quite a bit about the Dead Sea of Space, don't you?"</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade chuckled sinisterly. "Just like you've said, it's almost impossible for me to get out given my current state. But I bet you definitely have a way to get us out... Your brain can help me escape, which is one of the reasons why I decided not to kill you."</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, Ghost Head Blade's voice suddenly turned cold. "So now you have two options... One: die with me. Two: we cooperate and get out together."</p>

    <p>"Very well, I choose option two."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming spread his hands without hesitation. "But what do you mean by cooperation?"</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade: "You think of a way to get us out, I'll cheer you on."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "..."</p>
