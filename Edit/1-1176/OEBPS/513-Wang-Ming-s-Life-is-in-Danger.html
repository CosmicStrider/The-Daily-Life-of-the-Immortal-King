  <h1>Chapter 513 Wang Ming's Life is in Danger! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Basically, Wang Ming had to report if he wanted to go out, and he needed Old Qi's approval.</p>

    <p>Actually, he had already broken this rule the last time when he had gone out with the Heavenly Materials sword to catch Xiao Yuncheng. In the end, however, President Qi had suppressed this matter... he really pampered Wang Ming like his own grandchild.</p>

    <p>There were actually a lot of young and talented scientists at the academy. To many outsiders, this was a group of geniuses who were far above them; they were the pillars holding up the whole nation, and each of them was unbridled and wilful.</p>

    <p>But this group of people still weren't as smart as Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>Where there were comparisons, there naturally was envy, and where there was envy, there naturally was hate. Wang Ming indeed was usually a little wilful, resulting in him unintentionally provoking plenty of people. These people had tried everything to file complaints about him, but these had all been intercepted by Old Qi. But the more President Qi protected him, the more envious they became.</p>

    <p>Why had President Qi gone out of his way to look for an expert bodyguard for Wang Ming?</p>

    <p>He was afraid that the other scientists would one day lose control and hurt Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming's safety was the topmost priority. It wasn't enough to protect him outside, he also needed to be guarded at home.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ming had always been a terror at home...</p>

    <p>Actually, with Zhai Yin around now, his behavior was a lot more restrained.</p>

    <p>The rules of the Cultivation Academy of Science were no less severe than military rules; the academy was basically under militarized administration, but there actually weren't any restrictions on Wang Ming - the only restriction on him was that he wasn't allowed to leave without permission, and even if he announced he wanted to go out, it might not necessarily be approved.</p>

    <p>The Wang family's small villa was the only exception.</p>

    <p>Because Father Wang had talked to the upper management in his fan group...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the very beginning, Wang Ling hadn't known Zhai Yin's identity and thus had been a little cold toward her. But after carefully analyzing the pros and cons of Zhai Yin following Wang Ming around now, Wang Ling suddenly thought that President Qi had made a very good decision.</p>

    <p>Given Wang Ming's normally vicious tongue, his sharp words would increase the ire of the people around him by nine hundred and ninety-nine points.</p>

    <p>At this rate, there was a real possibility that his colleagues would poison him!</p>

    <p>Since Zhai Yin's arrival, she could, for one thing, restrain Wang Ming from doing whatever he wanted, and for another, indirectly protect him. Apart from his brain, he was a muggle without an ounce of spirit energy at all - an ordinary person would be able to poison him without much effort.</p>

    <p>Of course, even if Wang Ming was actually poisoned to death...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had a way of bringing him back to life.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was also capable of performing the "Samsara of Heavenly Life" which Wang Ming had used in his software several hours ago when he had gamed with Daoist Guang.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling could do it in real life...</p>

    <p>It was just that once he used it, not only would Wang Ming's identity become widely known, Wang Ling himself would very likely be exposed.</p>

    <p>His chin in his hand, Wang Ling thought about it for a while. He felt that it was time to give Wang Ming something like Lord Diulei's "Soul Suppression Ring" which could bring people back to life. Of course, this would actually be a little harder because the ring could only be activated when spirit energy was poured into it; artificial spirit energy wouldn't work.</p>

    <p>Hence, Wang Ling had to make a resurrection magic treasure which didn't require spirit energy to be activated.</p>

    <p>Even if Zhai Yin was Wang Ming's bodyguard, she couldn't always be with him. Wang Ling felt it was better to have some insurance in case the worst happened.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked up at the wall calendar that hung on the door.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming's birthday was August 1st, which was Army Day.</p>

    <p>It was more than half a month away, which was enough time for Wang Ling to make the preparations.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When Zhai Yin was brought up, Wang Ming clearly had a lot of complaints.</p>

    <p>He wasn't reserved as he lay on his stomach on the bed, Wang Ling's pillow in his arms. He stretched out his hand toward the ceiling with the tragic and heartbroken air of the marginalized. "Ling! You have no idea how terrible that woman is!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling could tell that this guy's main reason for coming hadn't been to share the assessment results at all, but to complain; sharing the space assessment results was just an afterthought.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming's face was gloomy when he said, "She has a mouthful of whatever I'm drinking first to make sure it's not poisoned before I can drink it."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Lying on the ground, Er Ha raised its dog head; it felt that at the moment, Wang Ming looked like a bitter housewife who had just been abused.</p>

    <p>"And that's not all!" Wang Ming suddenly sat upright and dropped his forehead into his hand. "Even when I go to the toilet... she also needs to sit on it first!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>"And do you know what the most terrifying thing is? This girl actually started to learn how to cook recently! She even bought a dragon pig the day before yesterday and insisted on making me a fried pork chop!"</p>

    <p>"Dragon pig? She treats you well..." Er Ha tsked.</p>

    <p>The price of dragon pig meat on the market currently could be as high as five hundred immortal gold per jin for the best parts of the dragon pig; ordinary families couldn't afford it at all.</p>

    <p>Although this was the case, Er Ha was already no longer interested in meat after being away from the demon world for so long. Plus, Guo Hao's family supplied it regularly with fly-flavored dog food.</p>

    <p>Naturally, the dog food was artificially flavored, and didn't use real flies, which made Er Ha realize that when it ate flies now, they tasted a little strange.</p>

    <p>"Treats me well?" Wang Ming's lips twitched. "Have you eaten a black-colored pork chop? And that fried pork chop was the size of a basin!"</p>

    <p>"That can't be right, aren't all the people from Magnificent Immortal supposed to be talented?" Listening to Wang Ming's words, Er Ha's mind was blank. "Their people are basically all-rounders, how can she be so bad at cooking?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "Bullshit! That's because they eat raw food in the army."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"She'll kill me with her cooking first before anyone can poison me." Wang Ming heaved a heavy sigh. "I heard that her teacher is a veteran chef."</p>

    <p>"Who?"</p>

    <p>"I don't know, I just heard that the person's name has the <em>juan </em>character in it."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Juan...</p>

    <p>He happened to know a chef with the surname Juan...</p>

    <p>This probably wasn't a coincidence, right?</p>

    <p>If Mother Juan really was Zhai Yin's teacher, she would definitely straightaway poison Wang Ming to death with her dishes!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sucked in a cold breath of air.</p>

    <p>It looked like he would have to make that resurrection object for Wang Ming as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling already felt that Wang Ming's life was in huge danger...</p>

    <p>"Lingzi, what's wrong? Your face doesn't look so good."</p>

    <p>Looking at Wang Ling's pale complexion, Wang Ming couldn't help snickering. "Auntie told me just now... today you were sneakily doing <em>that </em>?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"It's fine, it's fine, big brother won't laugh at you... young people should learn moderation."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming laughed with the air of someone who was unsurprised. "These tissues probably aren't comfortable, right? I've actually invented a new kind of tissue, but it hasn't been patented yet. This tissue is lubricated but dries quickly and doesn't stick to your hands! One piece can be used multiple times, and it also has a self-cleaning function, and is one hundred percent germ-free."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Hm...</p>

    <p>Just go be poisoned to death...</p>
