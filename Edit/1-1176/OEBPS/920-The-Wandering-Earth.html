  <h1>Chapter 920 The Wandering Earth</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Beat up Star Lord.</p>

    <p>These crazy, aggressive four words echoed unceasingly in Guo Ping's head. This was indeed an extraordinary plan which Guo Ping could never have thought of... But how could it be so easy to hit Star Lord, let alone beat him up...</p>

    <p>Was it really possible?</p>

    <p>Guo Ping couldn't imagine it. Although he hadn't been on Divine Dao Star for long, he had seen how brutal this Star Lord was - this was a tyrant on par with the God of Destruction! Once he targeted you, it was all over!</p>

    <p>"Star Lord has done many inhuman things over the years to expand Divine Dao Star." Guo Ping couldn't help trembling whenever he thought of this.</p>

    <p>He learned a lot of information from the alien news. Translating this alien language into a human one took a very long time, and there had been countless times during the process when fear would well up from the depths of his soul.</p>

    <p>Each time he successfully expanded the planet, this Star Lord would declare it to the world with an aloof and proud face.</p>

    <p>He announced to everyone.</p>

    <p>He was the god of the universe.</p>

    <p>And an omnipotent expert.</p>

    <p>Guo Ping trembled. Wang Ling could clearly see how Guo Ping's eyes resembled dead ash as his face instantly drained of color. "Resistance is futile."</p>

    <p>He said the words lifelessly, and dropped to his knees as if he had lost all his strength.</p>

    <p>"Divine Dao Star's Star Lord has never failed to seize a planet... Even those that struggled to escape were all devoured." Guo Ping said sadly, "I once witnessed the demise of an alien civilization, of fully over twenty billion people. To escape being hunted down by Divine Dao Star's godly power, twenty billion people worked together to stop their planet from rotating, and installed hundreds of thousands of thrusters on one side of the planet to flee Divine Dao Star's pursuit."</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, Guo Ping smiled bitterly. "So, even if you could stop Divine Dao Star's clone from expanding continuously in the Earth's core and escape for a time, it may not be forever. If his plan fails, Star Lord will directly manipulate Divine Dao Star into flying over and engulfing the entire solar system... Even if we had the "Wandering Earth Project," or Liu Cixin's imagination, or Wu Jing <sup>1</sup> , we can't escape!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>("The Wandering Earth" is a
sci-fi novel by Liu Cixin
featuring Wu Jing as the
protagonist ..)</dfn>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>After being trapped on Divine Dao Star for so many years, Guo Ping could barely endure it anymore. When he saw Wang Ling and the others speaking Mandarin in the bar, it had felt like grabbing at one last life-saving straw.</p>

    <p>He had previously intercepted classified intelligence which showed that Star Lord would capture the strongest person on Earth and imprison them on Divine Dao Star. Guo Ping had already been prepared early on, but when he brought Wang Ling and the others to his base, and the moment Wang Ling had canceled their transformations, Guo Ping saw Guo Hao...</p>

    <p>Although this was only a distant nephew, it still gave Guo Ping a feeling of homesickness as he began to long for his wife and his children... He wanted to give up everything - he wanted nothing more than to go home. Even if the Earth surrendered and was enslaved, that had nothing to do with him.</p>

    <p>Even if he was going to die, he wanted to see his wife and children in his final moments.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao, Guo Hao and Su Xiao were all stunned. They were shocked by the "NPC's" range of emotions in the game - what game NPC would be so into their role?!</p>

    <p>They whispered to each other in very low voices.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "Guo Hao, this Easter egg your uncle planted... is too amazing. It seems so real it almost doesn't feel like a game."</p>

    <p>Su Xiao: "Do you really have an uncle who works at the research institute?"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao nodded. "I do! My dad told me before that I have a distant uncle who does scientific research. This is probably a story which my uncle who makes games came up with based on my uncle who works at the research institute, which is why the script sounds so real."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>For a long time, there was silence in the base.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao nudged Fang Xing and said in a low voice, "Don't space out; the NPC is now feeling very desperate. We should say something encouraging at this moment; only then can we push the plot along. He might look like he has lost all hope and doesn't want to live anymore, but this is like a person sending text messages to his friends and relatives to say that he's jumping off a building. This kind of people lack care and attention; as long as they feel warmth, their spirits will recover quickly!"</p>

    <p>"Mm..."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing came forward and patted Guo Ping's shoulder. "Don't give up, we still have hope..."</p>

    <p>Guo Ping's lifeless face instantly glowed with new light. "Really?"</p>

    <p>"My god... You're the one who wrote the script, aren't you?" Guo Hao couldn't help exclaiming.</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>"In any case, it's better to try than just sit around and wait to die." Bai Qiao said, "Know yourself and your enemy, and you will win every battle. Tell us everything you know about Star Lord - my hair has been very itchy lately."</p>

    <p>As soon as she said that, everyone gave Bai Qiao strange looks.</p>

    <p>Realizing how ambiguous her words sounded, Bai Qiao's tender face reddened and she hurriedly said, "You perverts! I was referring to my ahoge! What were you thinking?"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>As if sensing the awkward atmosphere, Guo Ping coughed softly and said, "All of you have probably seen how lizards make up a very large part of the people of Divine Dao Star. The fact is that these aren't lizard people, but the legendary dragon people... On Divine Dao Star, they are called Divine Dragons. It is the Divine Dragons who rule this planet; Star Lord might look like a human, but he changed his appearance - he is a Divine Dragon."</p>

    <p>"Why is he using a human form?" Guo Hao asked.</p>

    <p>"That's actually why I'm in favor of peace talks - because this Star Lord in fact likes Earth very much, and even admires humans, which is why he's taken on the appearance of one. Right now, there are plenty of cosmetic surgery clinics on Divine Dao Star that offer human face plastic surgery - idol faces are very popular here."</p>

    <p>"If he likes Earth, why is he doing this? Wouldn't it be better for him to leave Earth as it is?"</p>

    <p>"Do you know why there are so many strange monsters on Divine Dao Star?" Guo Ping said, "Each monster represents an alien civilization. There is a strange creature in this universe called the yandere - the way they treat things they like is different from normal people."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"After the earth is devoured, Divine Dao Star will have a record of the human genome, and the first pair of humans will come into being here. To Star Lord, this is nothing more than a game of rearing all the things he likes together on this planet."</p>
