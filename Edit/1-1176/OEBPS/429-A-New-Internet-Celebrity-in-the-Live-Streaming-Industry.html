  <h1>Chapter 429 A New Internet Celebrity in the Live Streaming Industry </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Seeing Wang Ling brandish the <em>Three Years of College Exams and Five Years of Simulations </em>cudgel, Lord Diulei thought of a song lyric: <em>This cudgel... will wipe you out completely <sup>1</sup> </em><em>...</em></p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(From 'Wukong,' a song by Dai Quan for the Monkey King series.)</dfn>

    <p>And indeed, it was true...</p>

    <p>This scene was really too astonishing, and Taoist Guang was immediately dumbstruck in front of the screen for a long time.</p>

    <p>This Way of the Sword qi from Evil Sword God was so difficult to deal with! Who knew that Wang Ling was able to directly break it up like he was swatting a fly...</p>

    <p>After coming back to his senses, the expression on Taoist Guang's face was very complicated; there was some amazement and horror mixed into it, as well as the urge to laugh.</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang: "Senior Ling... may I ask, what type of operation is this?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Compared with Taoist Guang, Lord Diulei had the air of someone who had experienced a lot and his expression was completely unruffled. "Brother Guang, it's nothing to be surprised about, you just need to get used to it." After seeing Wang Ling use the microwave to refine weapons in a series of godly operations, the young man in white was naturally no longer perturbed at seeing other amazing operations.</p>

    <p>He was unable to guess how strong Wang Ling was, but in any case, in his heart, Wang Ling wasn't just a brother, but also a marvel.</p>

    <p>In the past, the young man in white had always thought that the gap between him and Wang Ling was just a difference in strength... But looking at it now, he felt that he was severely lacking in every aspect.</p>

    <p>Thinking this, he emotionally typed a series of heartfelt words into the three-person group: "Sure enough, knowledge is power."</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling spent a sleepless night thinking about many things.</p>

    <p>He felt that although Taoist Guang's hypothesis did make sense, it was just a hypothesis after all.</p>

    <p>As for whether there were any other entrances hidden in the transmission link, in the Gate Between Worlds which connected the human world and the demon world, he felt that this was something he needed to verify himself.</p>

    <p>He would definitely check out the Immortal's Treasure House. In his current to-do list, investigating the Immortal's Treasure House was only second to the upcoming midterm exams.</p>

    <p>However, he couldn't be hasty. He needed to consider the matter at some length. Moreover, he wasn't placing all his hopes of restraining his power on this Immortal's Treasure House. It was true that it held a lot of Immortal Zhenyuan's treasures, but whether it had a magic treasure that could help him control his power was another matter.</p>

    <p>If it was possible, Wang Ling hoped that one day, he would find a way to curb his power without the help of any magic treasure, or that his power didn't need to be controlled; the best would be if he could get used to his power... But as things currently stood, this was just wishful thinking.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling got up very early in the morning, packed Taoist Guang's tattered Taoist robe, and had Sheep help deliver it to Lord Diulei's place.</p>

    <p>The demonic Way of the Sword qi that had suffused this tattered robe had been completely eliminated, but there were still traces of a sword aura attached to it. This was the normal sword qi left behind by the Heaven-Cleaving Sword. Actually, a lot of it had already dissipated, but Wang Ling could still sense it.</p>

    <p>After the conversation in the three-person chat group yesterday, Wang Ling and Lord Diulei had had a private discussion about whether they could use modern space assessment technology on the minute traces of sword aura left behind on the tattered robe and follow it back to the location of the Heaven-Cleaving Sword.</p>

    <p>In theory, Wang Ling thought that it was possible.</p>

    <p>But assessing it would have to be left to Wang Ming to handle.</p>

    <p>But it happened to be a Monday, and Wang Ling had to attend class, so after Sheep left to deliver the robe to Lord Diulei, it would be the latter who would have to run errands for the rest of the assessment work.</p>

    <p>If Evil Sword God was still in that "Otherworld" right now, as long as they could trace the Heaven-Cleaving Sword, they would be able to follow it back to the Otherworld where Evil Sword God was.</p>

    <p>Even if this Otherworld didn't exist, Wang Ling felt that finding Evil Sword God in the flesh was also pretty good.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was July 10th on Monday in the twelfth week of the semester.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling got to the classroom as usual, and the noise inside was led by Chen Chao and Guo Hao as always.</p>

    <p>He was a little stunned to find these two guys actually watching live streams on their phones.</p>

    <p>This was the critical juncture before the midterm exams, and students simply didn't bring their smart devices like cell phones and watches to school, or would turn them off in school. Otherwise, if they were discovered, their devices would be confiscated at best, or at worst, parents would be called in; Teacher Pan had never hesitated in this respect.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, there were always one or two people in each class who would ignore this warning, and the "Two Heng-Ha Generals<sup>2</sup>" in Grade One, Class Three were precisely Chen Chao and Guo Hao.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Two characters in the classical Chinese fantasy novel 'Fengshen Yanyi.' One is called Zheng Lun, who could defeat enemies by snorting (heng 哼) and the other one is named Chen Qi, who could capture enemies by breathing out (ha 哈) yellow gas.)</dfn>

    <p>To be honest, these two actually didn't have bad scores, which were above average... However, their usual style of learning was based on the principle of "being cheeky whenever possible," which was a real headache for Teacher Pan.</p>

    <p>When they saw a shadow flash at the classroom door, Guo Hao and Chen Chao were so scared that they almost dropped their phones.</p>

    <p>"Oh my god! It's you, Wang Ling! You almost scared me to death! I thought it was Old Pan!" Guo Hao yelled.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Standing next to them after collecting homework from the first row, Su Xiao's face was full of helplessness. "You two should be a little more careful. Teacher Pan will be coming to school early these two weeks... I also heard that teachers have been patrolling outside the classrooms recently!"</p>

    <p>"It's fine, it's fine! You need to be cheeky if you want to succeed <sup>3</sup> !" Guo Hao waved his hand airily.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(Adapted from the phrase 'You need to take risks if you want to succeed.')</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Su Xiao: "Anyway, what are you looking at? You're so energetic so early in the morning..."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "An old man's live stream! He started streaming on the cultivation live streaming platform at ten o'clock last night. His ID's Lord Island, and it's very interesting!"</p>

    <p>Su Xiao: "What's it about?"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao answered, "Survival on a deserted island! Furthermore, the deserted island Lord Island is on right now is overseas, and since he started streaming last night, it's still daylight! It's surrounded by the sea and in the live stream you can hear the sound of the waves."</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling somehow felt that Chen Chao's description sounded familiar.</p>

    <p>He quietly came closer to give the screen a look... and saw Taoist Guang interacting with the audience, his face as cheerful as an open peach blossom!</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling dropped his forehead into his hand as he felt his head ache.</p>

    <p>At that time, Guo Hao added, "When I was surfing online yesterday, I found Lord Island opening a coconut; he only had a few hundred fans then."</p>

    <p>Su Xiao asked casually, "What about now?"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "It's already over a million..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Su Xiao was also surprised. "What the hell?!"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "Also, Lord Island used the island's mineral resources just now to forge a big pot with a fire spell."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao turned up the volume on his phone and turned the screen to the onlookers around him, and Wang Ling saw countless "666 <sup>4</sup> " scroll across the screen.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>4</sup>(A reminder that in Chinese, this buzzword means "super awesome .. ")</dfn>

    <p>The sound of the waves was very loud. Although the voice function on Taoist Guang's notebook for the elderly wasn't able to pick up words in such a noisy environment, when the live stream was combined with a sound amplification spell, the live stream audience could still pick out Taoist Guang's voice.</p>

    <p>At that very moment, Taoist Guang was standing in the iron pot, which was filled with seawater...</p>

    <p>He looked at the notebook's webcam and shouted exuberantly to his million viewers, "Friends, give me 666! Next, Lord Island will bring you the latest talent demonstration... Stewing myself! In an iron pot!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
