  <h1>Chapter 999 Number 60 High's Native Inhabitant</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The Number 60 High in the Palace of Mirrors was the same as Wang Ling had imagined: it was basically consistent with the layout of the real Number 60 High, but its decor was much more luxurious. The palm trees at the entrance, which to Wang Ling looked like they were clinging to life, now radiated vitality in the world of the Palace of Mirrors.</p>

    <p>"Why is the school gate closed? It's not the weekend today, is it?" Guo Ping was confused.</p>

    <p>"Don't forget, everything is the complete opposite in the Palace of Mirrors. Look here." Wang Ming pointed to a sign with very small words detailing points for attention.</p>

    <p><em>Number 1: In order to alleviate the burden on students, the Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools has approved for school to be held on Saturday and Sunday, while Monday to Friday are rest days. Teachers are not allowed to assign homework during the rest period. All schoolwork must be completed in school. If students are unable to do so, the teachers will guide them.</em></p>

    <p><em>Number 2: In order to protect the mental health of students, teachers cannot contact parents without permission if a student's grades are not good. Teachers should take full responsibility for the students' learning.</em></p>

    <p><em>Number 3: Without student consent, their free time and rest period cannot be encroached on (for PE class and so on, for example). The proposed use of this time should be reasonably communicated to the whole class for them to put to a vote, where the majority will rule.</em></p>

    <p><em>Number 4: If students are not satisfied with the food in the school canteen, they are allowed to order takeout during the lunch break. Teachers-in-charge cannot interfere.</em></p>

    <p><em>Number 5: Students must buy the school uniform, but if they are not happy with it, they can choose not to wear it. Teachers-in-charge cannot interfere with a student's individuality.</em></p>

    <p><em>Note: If any of the above regulations are violated, both the student and teacher will be given a major demerit.</em></p>

    <p>"This... is the complete opposite." Guo Ping was dumbfounded when he stared at these five points for attention.</p>

    <p>He suddenly gave a deep sigh - the teachers in the Palace of Mirrors didn't have it easy... students were the most rebellious in high school, and no matter if teachers were too strict or too lenient, problems would pop up either way. Outstanding teachers all had gauges in their hearts and knew how to weigh between right and wrong, and when to push or to relax.</p>

    <p>Then again, they couldn't be completely indulgent!</p>

    <p>An orderly world was one with rules.</p>

    <p>These points for attention might look like rules, but were more like means of indulging students. If students had no self-control, this could cause chaos.</p>

    <p>However, Guo Ping didn't think such a thing would happen in the Palace of Mirrors.</p>

    <p>The Palace of Mirrors did have native inhabitants, but more than that, they took in the souls of the deceased from the rest of the universe. Although people were resurrected in the Palace of Mirrors, they lost memories of their past lives and only remembered how they died. Then, the shadow men arranged for them to settle down in this world, build new families, and live every day without hopes or dreams.</p>

    <p>There were jobs in the Palace of Mirrors, but all resources were shared; even if one had a salary, there was no need for the people here to spend money on what they wanted.</p>

    <p>Money here was just for show.</p>

    <p>Although they were brought back to life and could obtain all the material things they wanted, they lived without dreams or hopes.</p>

    <p>They were like puppets, living repetitive lives under the control of these shadow men.</p>

    <p>"So, is this really a happy place?" Wang Ming grinned mockingly.</p>

    <p>"It's nothing more than a world that seems to have rules when it actually doesn't." Guo Ping couldn't help trembling. He could sense how bizarre this world was. When he thought carefully about it, he shuddered with horror. Guo Ping was a man who had also experienced much of life. When he drifted through space back then and everyone thought he was already dead, he arrived alone on Divine Dao Star, delved into the language of the Divine Dragons using his human intelligence, and experienced all kinds of strange things.</p>

    <p>But now, standing at the entrance of the fake Number 60 High in the Palace of Mirrors, Guo Ping got goosebumps all over his body, and he utterly didn't dare think too hard about this world anymore.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling never thought that he would come into contact with a world in another sense of the term; this world was different from the "secret land" as understood by many cultivators.</p>

    <p>Although secret lands were also in a different space, generally speaking, they still existed in the same dimension.</p>

    <p>But this world which Wang Ling had come to was completely different from the real world. The shadow men here radiated a mysterious power. Star Lord of Divine Dao Star said that this was a special power called "Fate Dao," but after going deep into the Palace of Mirrors, Wang Ling felt that it wasn't that simple.</p>

    <p>To avoid being detected, Wang Ling and the others put on Number 60 High's school uniform after climbing over the wall. Wang Ling always had Number 60 High's school uniform on hand. He was a good kid who was fond of being clean, and had several spare sets in case his uniform got dirty from battle or some mishap.</p>

    <p>The truth was that Wang Ling wasn't the only one who had several sets of clothes on hand. A lot of cartoon protagonists were actually equipped as such, which was why their clothes forever looked the same and weren't the least bit damaged in the cartoon, regardless of wind, rain, thunder and lightning, or after a battle... Everyone had several spare sets of clothes ready!</p>

    <p>Guo Ping and Wang Ming didn't need to wear the school uniform. The mecha armor they were wearing could camouflage itself and change outfits at any time. Wang Ling just needed to change into the school uniform, and after scanning it, identical clothes would appear on them. This was a very practical function, similar to how a chameleon changed its appearance.</p>

    <p>"Which class are you students from?" In the distance, a very pretty girl suddenly appeared from around the corner of the teaching building. She was wearing a snow-white apron, which was actually part of a full goth maid costume. Her voice was incomparably clear and sweet, and was as melodious as a small bell.</p>

    <p>"Grade One, Class Three," Wang Ling replied quietly.</p>

    <p>The girl frowned. "So it's Grade One, Class Three... How rare for you to actually show up at school. But what are you doing here? Students from the loser class hate coming to school the most. Even if it's two days on Saturday and Sunday, they still try their best to cut class."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Loser class?" Wang Ming was taken aback.</p>

    <p>He remembered that Wang Ling's Grade One, Class Three was supposed to be an elite class...</p>

    <p>Sure enough, everything in the Palace of Mirrors was the opposite.</p>

    <p>"Who are you?" Guo Ping probed.</p>

    <p>The girl in front of them sighed very helplessly and spread her hands. "You don't come to school often, no wonder you don't recognize me. I cook all the food in school on Saturday and Sunday! My name is Li Juan. You can call me Juan'er."</p>

    <p>Juan'er...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that the word seemed a little familiar.</p>

    <p>Then, he raised his head in astonishment.</p>

    <p>WTF!</p>

    <p>It turned out that this person was the Palace of Mirrors' Mother Juan!</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling could clearly sense that this person wasn't a departed spirit who had wandered over, but was a native inhabitant of the Palace of Mirrors!</p>
