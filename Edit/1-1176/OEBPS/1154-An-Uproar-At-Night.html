  <h1>Chapter 1154 An Uproar At Night</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The temperature on Nine Dragon Mountain plummeted at night. Looking into the distance from his high vantage point on Fire Peak, Wang Ling saw that a lot of areas were actually covered in ice, and it was even snowing; it was a completely different world from Fire Peak.</p>

    <p>Fire Peak had a tropical climate, where it was very hot during the day but dropped to a decent temperature at night.</p>

    <p>Theoretically speaking, Fire Peak was thus a pretty ideal site for barracks. However, the Number 60 High team never expected that even after setting up camp here for so long, nobody showed up to fight them for this territory.</p>

    <p>The cold air in the distance converged with the warm air here to instantly create a vast fog which looked remarkably similar to scenes in <em>The Game of Thrones</em>.</p>

    <p>It was more dangerous to act at night than during the day, but if someone was in fact good at using the fog as cover, the chances of a successful sneak raid increased significantly.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was hence currently wondering whether anyone would decide to use this opportunity to launch a night attack on them.</p>

    <p>But whether there was a night raid or not, Wang Ling didn't really care. In his eyes, this competition was nothing more than a game to pass the time. He didn't treat it seriously, nor did he release his spiritual perception to spy on the enemy.</p>

    <p>It was fine to just take things as they came.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Ling felt something heavy hit him in the back of his head with a fierce thud, which was then followed by a crisp sound of a collision.</p>

    <p>Hm...</p>

    <p>Someone had launched a sneak attack on him.</p>

    <p>But he had long sensed this person.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought that this blow might trigger the life-saving effect of the golden talisman, and if he seized the opportunity to collapse and wait to be rescued by the teachers, he might be able to leave the competition as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, that pathetic strike was far from lethal when it came to Wang Ling, and thus didn't trigger the life-saving effect.</p>

    <p>The person who had attacked Wang Ling was none other than the team captain of Titan High School, Zhu Hanyun.</p>

    <p>It had been a precise blow to the back of the head. The strength which Zhu Hanyun had put into it should have been enough to trigger the golden talisman's defense mechanism before the other party realized what was happening. However, Wang Ling just scratched his head like nothing had happened, which stupefied Zhu Hanyun, who was behind him, as well as instantly caused the latter to raise his guard!</p>

    <p>This person...</p>

    <p>There was something wrong with him.</p>

    <p>That was Zhu Hanyun's shocked thought.</p>

    <p>Not only wasn't Wang Ling injured by the blow, it turned Zhu Hanyun's palm numb instead.</p>

    <p>"Retreat!" In this desperate situation, Zhu Hanyun sent out a telepathic signal, and Titan High School, who had been prepared to besiege Number 60 High, immediately retreated from the front line.</p>

    <p>The truth was that there were a few schools at the foot of Fire Peak at that moment who had joined hands in a plan to surround and attack Number 60 High.</p>

    <p>Titan High School had been dispatched as the vanguard, but not long after the school had gone up, everyone unexpectedly received Zhu Hanyun's retreat order.</p>

    <p>The temporary cultivation high school alliance formed by Titan High, South Sea Sky High, North Fist High and West Leg Tyrant High gathered together to enquire about the situation.</p>

    <p>"What happened?"</p>

    <p>"Senior brother is injured!" The little junior sister from Titan High School, Yan Xiaochun, supported Zhu Hanyun as they retreated back down Nine Dragon Mountain.</p>

    <p>"How was he hurt?"</p>

    <p>South Sea Sky High immediately sent a healing-type student over, who examined Zhu Hanyun's injury. "His right arm is broken - it needs to be put into a splint and wrapped right away, otherwise there might be repercussions."</p>

    <p>"Broken?" The team captain of South Sea Sky High, Nan Yixiu, frowned deeply.</p>

    <p>Zhu Hanyun's body was extremely hard, yet even with such a physique, he had suffered a fracture; it must have been a violent attack. The problem, however, was that they had been watching the mountain peak closely from the bottom, and there hadn't been any movements at all...</p>

    <p>So, the question was: How did Zhu Hanyun injure his arm?</p>

    <p>At that moment, Zhu Hanyun's entire face was red; he was so ashamed that he didn't want to say a single word about what happened.</p>

    <p>Even if he did, he wasn't going to tell the truth.</p>

    <p>He had picked up a rock to attack someone else. Furthermore, he had hit the person on the back of the head, which was a lethal weak point. In the end, not only wasn't the other party injured, Zhu Hanyun himself had gotten a fracture.</p>

    <p>What utter humiliation!</p>

    <p>"The other side is very dangerous!" Helpless, Zhu Hanyun could only exaggerate his words to magnify Number 60 High's strength. "I was going to ambush them, but was spotted. They already made preparations earlier on, and used a very strange defensive spell which caused my power to rebound back on me, which is how I ended up like this..."</p>

    <p>"The other side was already prepared?" Hearing that, Nan Yixiu frowned deeply.</p>

    <p>It seemed that there was also a perception-type player on Number 60 High's team.</p>

    <p>Not only had they foreseen this night attack, they had even taken precautions.</p>

    <p>If it really was as Zhu Hanyun said, and the other side had set up a defensive spell which caused his attack to rebound... Nan Yixiu could only think of the Reverse Shield Spell.</p>

    <p>But given Zhu Hanyun's physique, even if he had been hit with the Reverse Shield Spell, it shouldn't be to the extent of getting his arm broken.</p>

    <p>Unless, the other side had cultivated the Reverse Shield Spell to a very high level, which had to be level seven or eight at the very least...</p>

    <p>They were all Foundation Establishment students.</p>

    <p>Someone had actually cultivated the Reverse Shield Spell, which was a spell that wasn't part of their main syllabus, to such a high level - Nan Yixiu found this utterly inconceivable.</p>

    <p>He never expected their plan to attack Number 60 High from all sides to actually fail at the get go...</p>

    <p>But Fire Peak was a very important stronghold, and with their four major high schools joining forces, they had to crack this tough nut.</p>

    <p>"Don't send anyone up for now; the best would be to force them to come down the mountain somehow."</p>

    <p>"Set a fire?" someone suggested.</p>

    <p>"Set fire to the mountain and you'll spend the rest of your life in prison..."</p>

    <p>"Of course we can't randomly set the mountain on fire. Given Nine Dragon Mountain's unique terrain, however, the rainbow mist in the morning can restore the vegetation and also put out the fire. There shouldn't be any problems.</p>

    <p>"But our main aim for competing with Number 60 High over Fire Peak is to obtain resources. It'll take some time for the rainbow mist to restore the vegetation. If we seize this territory by setting a fire, it'll be meaningless since all the spirit plants will have been burned. We have to think of another way," said Nan Yixiu.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, in Number 60 High's camp on the mountaintop, Gu Shunzhi had already long noticed the movements at the foot of the mountain. While the bottom of the mountain was covered in a heavy fog, it meant nothing to Gu Shunzhi at all.</p>

    <p>"There are forty people at the bottom." Gu Shunzhi used a stick to sketch out on the ground the distribution of forces at the foot of the mountain. Students from four cultivation high schools had locked onto Number 60's camp, and were ready to move.</p>

    <p>"Are we surrounded?"</p>

    <p>Both Chen Chao and Guo Hao frowned; for the time being, they couldn't see a way to break out.</p>

    <p>A few minutes later, countless nether flames appeared down below.</p>

    <p>"The other side is using the Spirit-Summoning Technique." Chen Chao immediately recognized this spell.</p>

    <p>Because this was the first thing they had learned in Teacher Pan's talisman class in the first semester!</p>

    <p>It was also during that very talisman lesson that Wang Ling had used this method to call forth the remnants of Er Ha's soul...</p>
