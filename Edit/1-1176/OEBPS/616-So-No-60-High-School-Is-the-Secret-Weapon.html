  <h1>Chapter 616 So Number 60 High School Is the Secret Weapon</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling realized that Guo Hao had been a little "cheeky" recently and would poke fun at him from time to time. Logically speaking, Wang Ling thought that he should actually already have a pretty low profile in class, but instead, it felt like people were constantly paying attention to him. Oddly enough, this feeling didn't bother Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Somehow, Wang Ling felt that every single person at Number 60 High School was especially approachable.</p>

    <p>In fact, he thought that this was something worth mulling over. After all, back when he had created the "intrinsic spirit field," the landscape had been directly modeled on Number 60 High School for background modeling. This had been a subconscious reaction and also reflected the weight which Number 60 High School carried in his mind.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High School might not be the best school, but in his mind it was at least the most impressive.</p>

    <p>It was the thirteenth week of the semester.</p>

    <p>So many bad things had happened, which made him dead tired.</p>

    <p>They had Teacher Pan's class in the morning, which was two Dao talisman lessons in a row. Because the weather was a little gloomy and the sports meet had just ended, Teacher Pan thought it was time for the students to concentrate on their studies.</p>

    <p>As Number 60 High School's teaching pioneer, it could only be said that Teacher Pan truly was Teacher Pan; without saying a single thing, she directly occupied the third period, which was the PE class, and unceremoniously started a third round of lessons. When Teacher Ye came, he just flashed past the classroom door and knocked as a mere formality. When he met Teacher Pan's eyes, he promptly pulled his head back and disappeared.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao and Guo Hao couldn't help giving Teacher Ye the finger in deep protest at his "cowardly" behavior.</p>

    <p>As a PE teacher, how could he gravely bow and scrape to men of high rank and men of high office <sup>1</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Derived from a line in the poem "Tian Mu Mountain Ascended in a Dream" by famous Chinese poet Li Bai.)</dfn>

    <p>Teacher Ye, be firm! Be firm!</p>

    <p>But regretfully, Teacher Ye left, just like that...</p>

    <p>Like the Fragrant Concubine <sup>2</sup> who turned into a butterfly and left without a trace...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(A consort of the Qianlong Emperor in Chinese legend. This adaptation is from the TV drama "Princess Pearl .. ")</dfn>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>School class periods were all systematically organized by the education consultants at the General Administration of 100 Schools based on the habits of students in every school. The arrangement took into account a lot of factors, such as the frequency of students raising their hands in a lesson, of lifting their heads, and so on... There was even data that pinpointed how long students maintained eye contact with the teacher.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling initially didn't know all this, but had heard about it from Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>So sometimes, three lessons in a row didn't work very well. Usually, the period Teacher Pan occupied would be for nothing more than dictation and tests, but against everyone's expectations this time, Teacher Pan actually used the third period to hold a class meeting.</p>

    <p>Standing on the dais, Old Pan looked around the classroom with the expression of one who knew everything. "I know that when I had Teacher Ye leave just now, there were definitely people criticizing me in their minds, isn't that right?"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao and Guo Hao didn't dare say anything.</p>

    <p>Old Pan: "Chen Chao, Guo Hao! You two, don't look at me and smile! I'm talking about the both of you, there's nothing to smile about."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao and Guo Hao: "..."</p>

    <p>Old Pan really knew them too well...</p>

    <p>"This class meeting is about Devil Valley. Has everyone heard of it?"</p>

    <p>As soon as Old Pan finished speaking, the class fell deathly silent for a moment. Everyone was startled. Many students in the elite class read widely on topics outside of school, so plenty of them were utterly stunned when they heard this information.</p>

    <p>Devil Valley?</p>

    <p>Wasn't this the secret land that opened once every century?</p>

    <p>"Devil Valley is a 5A state-protected secret land, and is also called Beast King's Remains. This is because according to legend, Devil Valley was a tomb which the king of holy beasts, Devil King, built for itself," said Teacher Pan. "This time, our nation has already detected that the entrance to the secret land, Devil Valley, will open somewhere in Songhai city. Most importantly, our Grade One students are very fortunate since Secretary Dakang of the Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools has given his personal endorsement for Number 60 High School's Grade One summer camp this year to be held in Devil Valley."</p>

    <p>What kind of amazing news was this...</p>

    <p>All the students were extremely astonished.</p>

    <p>To be able to see Devil Valley with their own eyes, the legendary Beast King's Remains... this was truly a rare stroke of luck that could only happen serendipitously.</p>

    <p>If Teacher Pan hadn't announced this herself, no one would have believed it, not even if Guo Hao was the first to hear inklings of it and break the news in class.</p>

    <p>Old Pan smiled. "This is a stroke of luck for each of you. I hope you will make use of this summer camp opportunity. Peanut, come to my office after class to collect the notices on the summer camp for distribution. Everyone go home and ask your parents to sign it."</p>

    <p>"Will it be dangerous?"</p>

    <p>"It won't. Since this activity involves all Grade One students, all Grade One teachers will go to protect everyone," Teacher Pan said. She didn't mention one thing, and that was who would be leading the operation this time. The chief commander of the operation wasn't the Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools, but Huaxiu Alliance â€” Huaxiu Alliance of Cultivators.</p>

    <p>This was the highest authority in charge of all the light forces in the whole of Huaxiu nation. Data registration and records on the light forces were collated under Huaxiu Alliance, which directly regulated light forces nationwide.</p>

    <p>The immediate leaders were the head of state and the Ten Generals who had founded Huaxiu nation.</p>

    <p>If there was a security issue, Huaxiu Alliance would directly intervene, so Teacher Pan actually thought that the school teachers going along was redundant...</p>

    <p>No one had expected the summer camp this time to actually be in Devil Valley. This matter also spread after class, first to Grade Two and Grade Three. Then, with Number 60 High School at the center of the explosion, the other high schools in the whole of Peiyuan district also posted various messages online expressing their envy, jealousy and hate.</p>

    <p>Devil Valley was a 5A secret land. Each time the entrance opened, the state would set up blockades and regulatory controls, and only allow approved scientific experts to enter accompanied by an inspection team in order to collect intelligence data inside Devil Valley.</p>

    <p>Therefore, it wasn't a place you could enter whenever you wanted; the inspection team would go through stringent regulations and examinations each time in order to control the number of people who went in.</p>

    <p>Hence, a lot of people didn't understand why the Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools would directly make Devil Valley the site for the summer camp.</p>

    <p>When school was over, Guo Hao suddenly said, "A lot of people are now saying that the remains we will be visiting might be fake. What do you think?"</p>

    <p>Su Xiao: "I actually also think they might be fake... There are a lot of extinct resources inside Devil Valley, how can they let us Foundation Establishment students enter?"</p>

    <p>"Not necessarily..."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao refuted. "I feel like this activity was arranged for some reason; maybe the higher-ups are using us as a secret weapon."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao didn't understand. "Secret weapon? What do you mean?"</p>

    <p>"Think about it..."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao broke it down. "Last time at our spirit sword exchange meet, it was the end of Shadow Stream. Then there was the military training for six schools, and it was the end of the old devil... This time it's a combined summer camp..."</p>

    <p>When Chen Chao spoke up to this point, every single person in class started to feel scared after some careful thought.</p>

    <p>Indeed, Number 60 High School really was a secret weapon...</p>
