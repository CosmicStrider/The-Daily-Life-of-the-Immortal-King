  <h1>Chapter 986 Plaster Cast</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Guo Ping and Wang Ming had successfully avoided this assault, but Wang Ling was guessing that this group of shadow men wouldn't let them off so easily. The two of them would be under threat if they remained on Earth, so after some discussion, Wang Ling directly took Wang Ming, Guo Ping as well as the five shadow men he had captured to Divine Dao Star.</p>

    <p>This was the second time Wang Ling frightened Star Lord of Divine Dao Star as he fell off the bed... His injury tore open a second time - it didn't seem he would be able to make a full recovery so easily.</p>

    <p>"Rest assured, Ling Zhenren, I'll do everything I can to protect these two." When Star Lord made this promise, his subordinates were pressed to the door outside as they listened in.</p>

    <p>Interrogation of the five shadow men started that night on Divine Dao Star as they were stripped of their black shadow suits roughly by the Divine Dragons. Interrogation on Divine Dao Star wasn't complicated since the Divine Dragons had their own methods: the thousand-degree blade and the hydraulic press.</p>

    <p>The so-called thousand-degree blade was a knife made from highly concentrated divine energy molecules which was used to cut the skin. Although the cuts weren't large, they were a thousand times more painful than those caused by a common blade; even just a small cut on an acupuncture point would be excruciating.</p>

    <p>The second was the hydraulic press.</p>

    <p>The hydraulic press on Divine Dao Star ran on divine energy. During torture, the Divine Dragons would hook up some body part, usually the arm, of the person being interrogated to the hydraulic press.</p>

    <p>When the hydraulic press was activated, whatever was in its path would be crushed to dust.</p>

    <p>These people weren't afraid of death, and even sought it; as long as they weren't killed, they refused to speak, which was why Star Lord's first reaction was to double the pain they received.</p>

    <p>Since their lips were tightly sealed and they weren't afraid to die, he could only use these methods to make them open their mouths.</p>

    <p>Although it was very painful, these methods wouldn't create large wounds; even using the divine energy hydraulic press to press down on a person's arm wasn't lethal. The moment it pressed down, highly concentrated divine energy molecules would immediately cause the injury to clot and stop the bleeding. However, the pain it caused was hundreds of thousands of times more painful than getting your arm cut off.</p>

    <p>Previously, to force other aliens to sign unequal treaties with Divine Dao Star, Star Lord had used these tried-and-true methods to force their leaders to give in.</p>

    <p>In Divine Dao Star's divine prison, Wang Ling, Wang Ming and Guo Ping had come to observe the interrogation, which was being personally handled by Star Lord. The Divine Dragons had never seen this happen before, but they recognized who Wang Ling was from his dead fish eyes...</p>

    <p>All the Divine Dragons shivered.</p>

    <p>They absolutely couldn't be mistaken. Back then, Jingke and Bai Qiao had combined to create Jingbai, and those pair of dead fish eyes left a deep impression on them. The Divine Dragons knew of Jingbai's true identity as a sword spirit, and that he had been summoned by a teenager. None of them had seen Wang Ling before, but they knew that Jingbai also had a pair of dead fish eyes...</p>

    <p>It was said that a sword spirit resembled its master.</p>

    <p>Now, with Wang Ling presiding over the situation behind Star Lord, the latter didn't even dare fart.</p>

    <p>From Star Lord's attitude, it really wasn't hard to guess Wang Ling's true identity.</p>

    <p>By the time Wang Ling arrived, Star Lord had already ordered the five shadow men to be stripped of their clothes, and they were all interrogated separately to prevent collusion beforehand.</p>

    <p>The interrogation room was made from a special material and odd divine patterns were carved into it which prevented the possibility of telepathic communication.</p>

    <p>Star Lord surveyed the five individuals after they were stripped and waved his hand right away. "Prepare to begin."</p>

    <p>However, just as several Divine Dragons were about to make cuts with the thousand-degree blade, one of the torturers noticed something odd.</p>

    <p>"Your Excellency Star Lord, there seems to be a problem..."</p>

    <p>"What is it?"</p>

    <p>"These people have a mark on their buttocks which I've never seen before."</p>

    <p>"Mark?" Star Lord furrowed his brow. Just as he was about to step forward, he thought of something, and then stepped aside to make way for Wang Ling and the others first.</p>

    <p>"This young man is worth teaching." Wang Ming and Guo Ping patted Star Lord's shoulder one after another as they brushed past him.</p>

    <p>Star Lord choked with vexation at losing face in front of so many subordinates. However! It was his desire to live that made him act that way.</p>

    <p>"What mark is this?" Wang Ming mused as he gazed at it. Although he couldn't cultivate, he was very well-read. However, he couldn't recall ever seeing such a mark, and he felt that it was a little strange.</p>

    <p>"In all my years of research, I've never seen this thing." Guo Ping shook his head.</p>

    <p>Star Lord of Divine Dao Star took a look and also frowned. Initially, he had wanted to step forward and show off, only to realize in the end that he too didn't recognize this mark. The situation lapsed into awkwardness for a moment.</p>

    <p>But at that moment, a familiar voice rang out. "Perhaps, I recognize it..."</p>

    <p>Looking in the direction of the voice, Wang Ling realized that it was actually coming from the cast that Star Lord was wearing.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "???"</p>

    <p>Star Lord was also startled. "What the hell... you are..."</p>

    <p>"Don't remember my voice?" The plaster cast laughed.</p>

    <p>While Star Lord had yet to react, Wang Ling had recognized the voice: it was that divine throne which Jingbai had cut in half previously.</p>

    <p>"You're that throne..." Wang Ling said as he gazed at the cast on Star Lord's leg.</p>

    <p>"As expected of Ling Zhenren - indeed, it is I!"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>"How did you turn into a cast?" Guo Ping was curious.</p>

    <p>"I'm made of very costly material, after all. Without me, it might be very hard for Star Lord's leg to be completely healed. So God crushed me and ground me into a plaster and had me stick to Star Lord's thigh."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Also, this is my punishment from God for going up against Ling Zhenren... Star Lord has a little too much leg hair, which is really unbearably prickly."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>After everyone calmed down, Wang Ling continued and asked, "Do you recognize this mark?"</p>

    <p>"I do." The divine throne-turned-cast said, "I was created by God; I know all things in the universe and have seen all kinds of buttocks. I've lived for so long, what kind of ass have I not seen..."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>The divine throne said, "This mark is called the fate mark. The means by which it is activated is very special: one has to cultivate a special Dao called Fate Dao to bring this mark about and to use Fate techniques."</p>

    <p>"So there really is another power in the universe apart from Heavenly Dao, Outer Dao and Divine Dao?"</p>

    <p>"Of course," the divine throne replied. "But Fate Dao is very special and only extraordinary people with the designated right to do so can cultivate it. Those without such a privilege will never be able to comprehend it in their lifetimes."</p>
