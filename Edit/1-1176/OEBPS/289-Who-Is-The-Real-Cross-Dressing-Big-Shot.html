  <h1>Chapter 289 Who Is The Real Cross-Dressing Big Shot? </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Unlike normal clothes, Taoist robes were very flexible and stretchy. You just needed to squeeze into them a little to put them on; in Luo Chuang's view, it was like a woman's chest — squeeze them a little, and they seemed bigger.</p>

    <p>Using the godly thunder inheritance to knock out two passing female cultivators, Dharmaraja dragged them into an alley, laid them out in a secluded corner, then removed their clothes.</p>

    <p>"Brother Luo, it's so tight! My chest feels stuffy, I can't breathe!" Dharmaraja felt like a tightly wrapped dumpling in the blue Taoist robes, and both his chest and hips were bound so tight it hurt.</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang wasn't that much better. "If you feel like you can't breathe, then use the turtle-breathing skill."</p>

    <p>"Can we really do this?"</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang was silent for a bit. "I'm not sure if this will work, but at the very least, the holy array won't be able to lock onto us, now that we've changed clothes.</p>

    <p>"Now we can think of a way to meet up with Ling Zhenren and Lord Diulei," Luo Chuang said. "From now on, if we bump into other people, I'll have to trouble Brother Dharmaraja to knock them out with your lightning; before we find the Master of Immortal Mansion, we should avoid fighting and save our strength."</p>

    <p>"Lord Jingke should be fine, right?"</p>

    <p>"Currently, there's no way to tell."</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang's first reaction had been that there was no way the eastern branch chief's spirit-suppressing flags could have imprisoned Jingke. This was all just Ling Zhenren's move in a game of chess to draw the Master of Immortal Mansion out. But after seeing the legendary holy array, the Ice Crystal Array, Luo Chuang now knew more about what Immortal Mansion was like... did that mean that the Master of Immortal Mansion still had other techniques to use?</p>

    <p>Frankly speaking, he was a little worried. "If Lord Jingke's form was complete, there would be absolutely nothing to be afraid of. The problem is that he doesn't have a sheath, and only has a perpetual protective layer of sword qi. But from another point of view, since Ling Zhenren is using Lord Jingke as bait, I think he must be confident in his plan..."</p>

    <p>After saying this, he looked up into the sky, which by now was completely dark. He could feel the Twelve Stars Palace Array guardian spirits that had been eliminated earlier start to coalesce once more.</p>

    <p>"I wonder how Immortal Toya, Cailian Zhenren and Brother Fang Xing are doing..."</p>

    <p>He stared into the air with a very deep expression; not everyone could withstand repeated attacks by the Twelve Stars Palace Array guardian spirits. Once these spirits regenerated, they would definitely start looking for the other intruders.</p>

    <p>Previously, whether it had been Luo Chuang or anyone else, they had felt that this would be a relaxed operation. But it was only after they had entered Immortal Mansion for real that they truly felt how dangerous it was.</p>

    <p>Whether they survived or not would truly depend on their luck!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ling and Lord Diulei hadn't been in a hurry to leave after changing into the women's Taoist robes, and instead were looking around the palace of Beauty and Discount, these two female cultivators.</p>

    <p>When they had stepped through the spatial wall before, Lord Diulei had already noticed that each palace had been made out of unusual bricks; they contained large amounts of spirit energy and at the same time had the ability to restore themselves.</p>

    <p>Bricks which could restore themselves; what kind of concept was this?</p>

    <p>It was as if each brick had a Dharmaraja inside, and even then, this ability to restore itself was still far more convenient than Dharmaraja using the godly thunder inheritance to weld broken parts together.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, I feel that this Master of Immortal Mansion isn't that simple." The young man in white touched one brick of a stone pillar inside the palace. Less than three seconds later, he jerked his hand back as if he had gotten an electric shock.</p>

    <p>At that moment, he had actually sensed the fluctuation of nomological power inside the brick; it had been like a viper winding around his finger before biting it.</p>

    <p>"This is actually nomological power?" Lord Diulei was astounded. This meant that the Master of Immortal Mansion had very likely reached True Immortal level. Having said that, the set-up of nomological power here was very far-ranging, enough so that a trace of it was mixed into every brick — not even True Immortal level cultivators could do that.</p>

    <p>On the side, Wang Ling narrowed his eyes, and a bead of cold sweat actually formed on his forehead.</p>

    <p>Based on the standard list of cultivation realms, only cultivators at True Immortal level were able to use nomological powers at will. Of course, that didn't exclude the fact that there was a very small number of extremists who could use it without having reached True Immortal level. But relatively speaking, it was far easier to use nomological powers at True Immortal level.</p>

    <p>However, to cast it out like a spider web to encompass everything... even General Yi would find this difficult to accomplish.</p>

    <p>In Wang Ling's view, this level of power had already surpassed True Immortal.</p>

    <p>But this probably wasn't the Master of Immortal Mansion's own power; if he had this ability, Jingke would already have switched owners, and the man wouldn't have to go through all this effort.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling couldn't help sighing in his heart. Sure enough, putting an end to this matter was the right thing to do.</p>

    <p>If they put it off, Immortal Mansion would be a ticking time bomb, and no one knew when it would explode.</p>

    <p>After Wang Ling conveyed his thoughts to Lord Diulei through his mind, the young man in white was startled. "Brother Ling, you suspect that there's still another power behind Immortal Mansion? And that it's directly connected to the Master of Immortal Mansion?"</p>

    <p>In fact, while Wang Ling had been speaking, the young man in white had already come up with a theory.</p>

    <p>Gazing at the stone pillar in front of him, he took a step back. "Brother Ling, can you remove a brick from this stone pillar?"</p>

    <p>Crack!With his eyes fixed on the stone pillar, Wang Ling curled his fingers and directly stuck them into the groove around a brick.</p>

    <p>Shortly after that, he felt the same electric shock as Lord Diulei had; the nomological power in the brick lashed out at his fingers.</p>

    <p>Frowning, Wang Ling felt the tips of his fingers turn a little numb.</p>

    <p>And yet the power felt very gentle, even a little comfortable; it was like the kissing gourami that picked at your fingertips during a fish spa.</p>

    <p>Firmly gripping the brick in front of him, Wang Ling slowly increased the strength in his hand.</p>

    <p>The brick came out easily!</p>

    <p>"Let me see!" Lord Diulei didn't dare touch the brick, and only came closer to take a look. Very quickly, realization dawned on him. "Just as I expected!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling observed the brick carefully. Apart from the massive nomological power and the pattern on it, he didn't notice anything unusual. But he felt that the pattern seemed somewhat familiar, as if he had seen it somewhere before.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, do you know what familiars are?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei looked at Wang Ling as he said, "The Almightys who died on the ancient battlefield could combine what remained of their lives with a special magic array in order to become spirits of the brave departed. In cultivation terms, we call these spirits familiars. The traces you can see on the brick were definitely left by a familiar, I am absolutely sure of it. Also, it's very likely that this familiar's special ability is to create massive amounts of restorative nomological power — Immortal Mansion's entire palace was built with it.</p>
