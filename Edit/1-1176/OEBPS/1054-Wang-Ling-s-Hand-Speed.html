  <h1>Chapter 1054 Wang Ling's Hand Speed</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Elsewhere, Fu Fusheng was still waiting in the detention center. He didn't get any good news, but received word that Wu Yuanji had been caught alive. Fu Fusheng was instantly full of despair as he slumped down in his chair. According to the police at the detention center, a lot of Fu Fusheng's hair turned white overnight.</p>

    <p>Wu Yuanji was placed in Spirit Shackles and stripped of his shadow form on the spot.</p>

    <p>When Gao Tian asked Wu Yuanji why he was able to exhibit such power, Wu Yuanji's answer startled everyone.</p>

    <p>"Frozen dumplings. I ate a pack of frozen dumplings," Wu Yuanji said.</p>

    <p>"Frozen dumplings again?" Chief Zhao's eyes were wide open. After Zheng Tianqiang's confession, Chief Zhao had gone to buy a pack that night! And it was even the broccoli-flavored frozen dumplings produced by the Office of Strategic Deception! This pack of frozen dumplings was even more expensive than the broccoli produced by the Office of Strategic Deception! One might as well buy broccoli themselves to mash for their own dumplings!</p>

    <p>"What is the filling for the dumplings?" Even Gao Tian couldn't help but be curious.</p>

    <p>"Three delicacies; I remember that they were nutritious dumplings that are especially suitable for pregnant women," said Wu Yuanji.</p>

    <p>"Why did you eat that sort of thing? Are you pregnant?" Xiao Yin had an astonished look on his face.</p>

    <p>"I also have office staff I need to pay. This pack of frozen dumplings was in the returned goods section, and was cheap."</p>

    <p>"The returned goods section again..."</p>

    <p>Gao Tian lowered his head in thought.</p>

    <p>Returned goods section. Frozen dumplings. Nutritious dumplings especially for pregnant women... This basic information was identical to the content of Father Zheng's confession back then.</p>

    <p>Could it be that some manufacturer was using these frozen dumplings as an experiment, and adding illicit medicine to them?</p>

    <p>Gao Tian thought of this possibility.</p>

    <p>It was everyone's responsibility to bust drugs and illicit medicine, and the people of the world should pay attention to this issue - how many families had been destroyed because of drugs and illicit medicine? How many anti-drug officers had been sacrificed on the frontline because of these hateful drug dealers?</p>

    <p>The fight against drugs and illicit medicine should be a national resistance movement!</p>

    <p>New drugs were now popping up incessantly on the market. If someone was really using frozen dumplings to make this sort of bewildering medicine, it was an outrage!</p>

    <p>"Look for any leads on these dumplings at once!" Chief Zhao was clearly aware of how serious the problem was, and he couldn't sit still anymore.</p>

    <p>But when Zhuo Yi heard about these "frozen dumplings for pregnant women," his expression turned hesitant...</p>

    <p>He remembered that his shifu's mother had gotten pregnant and seemed to have bought a lot of things from the cultivation department store a while ago, and frozen dumplings were on the list... When Zhuo Yi dropped by the Wang family's small villa previously, Mother Wang had been returning goods because she had bought too many things, and Zhuo Yi remembered that a box of frozen dumplings had been moved to the truck.</p>

    <p>Thus, in this returned goods section, there was a box of frozen dumplings which had once been at the Wang family's small villa... Whether or not the box of frozen dumplings had any specific connection to the dumplings which Wu Yuanji and Father Zheng had eaten, Zhuo Yi wasn't sure...</p>

    <p>"It can't be such a coincidence, right?" Actually, Zhuo Yi was still a little scared.</p>

    <p>He made a note of the matter and planned to text his shifu for confirmation. He knew that his shifu was fond of enchanting things to play with when he had nothing to do - if his shifu had truly enchanted this pack of frozen dumplings, then everything made sense.</p>

    <p>It would be strange if anyone who ate the frozen dumplings enchanted by his shifu didn't level up quickly in their realms!</p>

    <p>It was fine if they used this sudden increase in fighting strength to do what was right - if they were like Wu Yuanji, and used this sudden gift of power to break the law however they could, not only would this create havoc in society, the police would also be kept perpetually busy.</p>

    <p>During the interrogation that very night, Wu Yuanji confessed to his crimes. He had been caught in the act on camera by Gao Tian, and plus Miss Little Liang's disability report, Wu Yuanji had no way to defend himself even if he wanted to.</p>

    <p>He was looking at a prison sentence as long as a hundred years.</p>

    <p>This devil of the legal profession, who had been stirring up trouble for so long with his intellect and malicious strategies, was unable to escape the law in the end.</p>

    <p>The next day, September 20th, was the thirty-seventh day of the summer vacation.</p>

    <p>Fu Fusheng appeared in court alone; he no longer had a defense lawyer.</p>

    <p>This was because Wu Yuanji had been arrested, and given that Fu Fusheng had hired Wu Yuanji, this public enemy of the legal profession, not a single lawyer in the lawyers' circle in the whole of Songhai city was willing to help take this case for Fu Fusheng after the latter requested a substitute defense lawyer.</p>

    <p>Similarly, Miss Little Liang's appearance also shocked the entire cultivation world.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling got up in the morning, the class chat group was already abuzz.</p>

    <p>No one thought that a cockroach would actually be used as a witness.</p>

    <p>"A cockroach... is this for real? My prediction came true?" Chen Chao exclaimed. A while ago, he had mentioned that a cockroach or some other bug in the house might have seen what had happened, but he never thought that the court would actually find a cockroach to testify.</p>

    <p>Since this was a public trial, a lot of people took screenshots of the live broadcast, which they shared directly in the group.</p>

    <p>Seeing Miss Little Liang, with the two feelers on her head, assert the facts in court, everyone couldn't help laughing.</p>

    <p>"Why does this cockroach look a little cute? I used to think cockroaches were very disgusting..."</p>

    <p>"Maybe it's because this little cockroach has a lolita voice?"</p>

    <p>Lolita voice... Sure enough, it was the root of all evil.</p>

    <p>Some used it to swindle others out of money, while a cockroach used it to act cute...</p>

    <p>At that moment, Teacher Pan couldn't help speaking in the group. "Students, this proves that all living things are equal to begin with. As long as there is harmony among all living things, even cockroaches can grow to assist humans. This is a very momentous event that is worth reflecting on. To that end, students, I'm going to give you another assignment."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>"With cockroaches and humans as the main topic, write an essay of no less than 800 words with a clearly defined theme, bright determination, and positive energy! Show the special bonds and friendship between living creatures!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>The chat group instantly sunk into an awkward silence.</p>

    <p>"???"</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan wasn't happy. "Students, why aren't you saying anything? Is it because you feel that the word count is too low? Then how about this: the first five students to respond will only need to write 800 words, and everyone else will have to write at least 2,000 words."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Seeing this, Wang Ling instantly replied with an ellipsis.</p>

    <p>"Very good, congratulations to Student Wang Ling, the first person who only needs to write 800 words." Teacher Pan nodded in satisfaction.</p>

    <p>"Fuck! Wang Ling, you damn person, I knew you were lurking! Your hand speed has never been this fast!" Chen Chao couldn't help roasting him.</p>
