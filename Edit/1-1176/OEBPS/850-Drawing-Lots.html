  <h1>Chapter 850 Drawing Lots</h1>

  <div>

    <p>To Wang Ling, the excuse that the account had been hacked was utterly ridiculous and somewhat brainless. It seemed that most foreigners had one-track minds. When those well-known foreign companies abroad saw that there were no more sheep to shear in their own countries, they turned their eyes to Huaxiu nation with its large population base and market potential.</p>

    <p>Thus, many foreigners who wanted to make money in Huaxiu basically lumped together what they knew of Huaxiu with whatever subconscious stereotypes they had, to put out products which they proclaimed contained Huaxiu native characteristics, when in fact these products were extremely vulgar and laughable.</p>

    <p>Switching to a new area after exhausting the old one made sense, but if you didn't grasp the correct approach, the end result would naturally be a huge mistake.</p>

    <p>So, this announcement didn't calm the anger, but instead infuriated even more people. Originally, most people just lashed out at the student who posted and started the fight, but no one thought that DG High as the school authority wouldn't take the least bit responsibility, which was very disappointing.</p>

    <p>This nonsense about the account being hacked was in a similar tone to the live streamer back then who said "I have a friend <sup>1</sup> "; in the end, it was nothing more than shooting themselves in the foot.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Refers to the game live
streamer Lu Benwei who tried
to cover up the fact that he
cheated in a game by
pretending that it was a friend
who had used his account to
play and cheated.)</dfn>

    <p>When DG High School released this statement, it took only an instant for the initial conflict between Number 60 High and DG High to spread to the whole of Peiyuan district, and finally to Songhai city and other parts of the country.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High's Golden Core rate wasn't as high as DG High's and its campus facilities weren't as advanced, but as a local cultivation educational institution that had been long established in Songhai city, students who had gone through Huaxiu's local education system and entered society were no less proud of it.</p>

    <p>"What do we do?"</p>

    <p>The student who had posted sat in a chair inside DG High School's guidance office as the teachers had an emergency meeting.</p>

    <p>They thought at first that this sudden incident wouldn't stir up much of a disturbance, and never expected it to have this type of impact.</p>

    <p>The student who had posted was called Li Hao, but he wasn't related to the four big families Of Songhai City.</p>

    <p>Li Hao's parents were foreign citizens with Huaxiu ancestry. As a child, he went to Lixiu nation's noble cultivation kindergarten, and once was even awarded first place in the Martial Arts Miao Miao Class <sup>2</sup> . His father Li Diao, currently called Brando, had had very strict expectations of him since young.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Xie Na is a Chinese host,
singer and actress who once
joked on TV that she learned
martial arts in the Martial
Arts Miao Miao Class as a kid ..)</dfn>

    <p>Furthermore, Li Hao was one of the successors of the modern vampire clan...</p>

    <p>As long as modern vampires got enough nutrients from fresh blood every day, they no longer had to fear sunlight.</p>

    <p>Li Hao thus had a superior advantage compared with an ordinary cultivator. He had a longer lifespan, was extremely agile, could jump very high, and had possessed uncanny strength since young. Not only that, he also had a strong regenerative ability.</p>

    <p>This was a vampire cultivator, and also one of DG High School's pillars this year.</p>

    <p>This was also one of the main reasons why DG High School chose to protect Li Hao after the incident.</p>

    <p>Of course...</p>

    <p>Another reason was that Li Hao's father, Li Diao, was one of the directors on the school board...</p>

    <p>"Teachers, why are you worried? As long as I win against the other party, that'll solve everything." Li Hao wasn't the least bit panicked as he sat in his chair. "Although my realm is only at the late Foundation Establishment stage, you know what my actual fighting strength is like. I can easily defeat a cultivator at the middle Golden Core stage - these Number 60 High students are nothing! I think I can defeat ten of them!"</p>

    <p>"It seems Young Master Li is quite confident of winning?"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, the educational administration teacher also nodded. "I've already looked at their student profiles; except for Miss Sun Rong from Huaguo Water Curtain Group, I don't think the others are a threat at all."</p>

    <p>"So what if it's Sun Rong?" Li Hao slammed his hand down on the arm of the chair. "I, Lin Hao, have lived for so long already - this time, I won't be human! Who cares what other people think? As long as I win, that's proof of everything!"</p>

    <p>"Young Master Li makes a good point." The educational administration teacher nodded. "But Young Master Li should know..."</p>

    <p>Li Hao: "?"</p>

    <p>"You're not human to begin with."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The draw event came to a close in the afternoon.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan came to class to announce the results of the draw.</p>

    <p>This was a draw for a 2v2 battle, which would be two transfer students versus two Number 60 High elite students.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong and Chen Chao were one team.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao and Su Xiao were one team.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Fang Xing were one team...</p>

    <p>After going through the teams for the Number 60 High students, Teacher Pan then pushed up her gold-rimmed glasses. "Next are the battle match-ups...</p>

    <p>"Student Sun Rong and Student Chen Chao, you will be up against Tang Jingze from Number 59 High and Wu Yang from Tianshi Imperial High."</p>

    <p>Why wasn't it against that damn Li Hao?</p>

    <p>Chen Chao sighed regretfully. He had been fired up with indignation since the morning, and wanted to beat up that jeering DG High School student.</p>

    <p>"Guo Hao and Su Xiao, your opponents are Student Li Mingyao and Student Zhou Youzheng from Remnant Elder Senior High School."</p>

    <p>"WTF..."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao and Su Xiao were alarmed.</p>

    <p>These were two absolutely tough opponents who would be difficult to deal with!</p>

    <p>Li Mingyao was known as the king of skills, because his family ran a string of skills stores, and he knew a whole bunch of skills and spells.</p>

    <p>Zhou Youzheng wasn't a pushover either. There was no restriction on the use of magic treasures in the battle this time. As a descendant of a family that refined artifacts, Zhou Youzheng basically had a natural advantage.</p>

    <p>Worse still, Li Mingyao and Zhou Youzheng were classmates to begin with, and had a certain rapport; if they teamed up together now, they would be even harder to handle!</p>

    <p>However, Teacher Pan had expected this result earlier on. "Student Li Mingyao and Student Zhou Youzheng are elite students of Remnant Elder Senior High School, and furthermore are the cream of the crop, so naturally they won't be easy to deal with. Our advantage, however, is the information which we have on them, so I can customize tactics and strategies for you. If you feel that they'll be difficult to deal with, feel free to consult me any time."</p>

    <p>"Is that alright..."</p>

    <p>"Yes!" Teacher Pan nodded. "It's never wrong to know who your opponent is. This is also a test of what you have learned this semester."</p>

    <p>At that point, Teacher Pan paused, then turned her gaze to Wang Ling. "Student Wang Ling will have to come with me later. Along with Class Two's Student Fang Xing, the three of us will have a meeting. Your opponents are that Li Hao from DG High School as well as his dad Li Diao, who is on the way here from abroad."</p>

    <p>All the students were hugely alarmed. "Da- dad?"</p>

    <p>"That's right... To be honest, even I didn't expect the other side to be this shameless."</p>
