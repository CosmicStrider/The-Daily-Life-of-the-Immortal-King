  <h1>Chapter 341 Fruit </h1>

  <div>

    <p>That night, Wang Ling read all the novel drafts that were inside the time capsule.</p>

    <p>Mm... it was indeed Mother Wang who had written about the One Thousand Years of Death which Killer Taoist had mentioned before. It was a main setup in her unpublished novel, and was one of the minor techniques taught by a killer clan.</p>

    <p>After confirming Mother Wang's identity, Wang Ling's brain short-circuited that night.</p>

    <p>He had to acknowledge the terrifying truth that his mother, his biological mother who had raised him, had in one night actually transformed from an ordinary housewife of an ordinary household into a great ancestor in the world of killers!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't tell Wang Ming about this - it was so shocking that even Wang Ling was taking a while to digest the fact.</p>

    <p>Above all, the most painful thing about the entire matter was that Mother Wang was utterly unaware that the main setup in her novel had actually had such a profound influence on the rise of the current world of killers...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was July 3rd on the eleventh Monday of the semester.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling hadn't completely absorbed what he had learned last night when a terrible thing happened in the school circle at noon that day.</p>

    <p>It had happened at Shenye High School, which was close to Number 60 High School. The school had been established through investments from Xiao clan shareholders, and a lot of Xiao clan outer sect disciples attended God Vision. In the survival contest back then during the combined military training for the six schools, Wang Ling had traded blows with the Xiao clan's number one outer sect disciple, Xiao Yuncheng.</p>

    <p>And this incident revolved around him.</p>

    <p>According to informant Guo Hao, during the PE class at noon in Shenye High School, Xiao Yuncheng had clashed with the PE teacher. Everyone had thought that Xiao Yuncheng was going to get it, but the outcome was out of their expectations.</p>

    <p>As the PE teacher had lunged at Xiao Yuncheng, the latter had turned his hand over and sent this Golden Core teacher flying!</p>

    <p>According to Xiao Yuncheng's account after that, he actually hadn't used a lot of strength at the time, yet the result had been overwhelming! With a simple defensive push, he had sent this PE teacher flying several dozen meters; most crucially, the teacher had sustained internal injuries!</p>

    <p>Everyone in class who heard this all had shaken expressions on their faces.</p>

    <p>In most people's minds, no matter how outstanding a Foundation Establishment student was in all respects, there was no way they could hurt a Golden Core teacher!</p>

    <p>Furthermore, Shenye High School was strict and their teachers were top-notch; even the PE teachers were the cream of the crop that had been very carefully selected. So how could a student win over a Golden Core teacher?</p>

    <p>At first, many people who heard this thought it was a rumor, but very quickly, a video started doing the rounds on Tieba, QQ zone and WeChat Moments.</p>

    <p>It was from Shenye High School's surveillance camera on the sports field, which had clearly recorded everything that had happened. It was probably some God Vision teacher who had carelessly shared it with friends or relatives, and it had gone viral online in a flash.</p>

    <p>Once it reached Guo Hao, he had been quick-witted enough to make a copy. Later, a lot of people discovered that the original video had been deleted.</p>

    <p>"What on earth happened?"</p>

    <p>Su Xiao was still a little skeptical after watching the video.</p>

    <p>The division between the Foundation Establishment stage and the Golden Core stage might seem like a minor gap, but for many people, it was an insurmountable barrier in realms.</p>

    <p>Thus, a lot of people couldn't help trembling when they thought about this. "This can't be real, right? Although our Teacher Ye isn't that powerful among the PE teachers, he is still at the Golden Core stage... I can't imagine that any student in our school would be able to beat him up."</p>

    <p>Hearing this view, the corners of Wang Ling's mouth couldn't help twitching. "..." Did Teacher Ye offend you until you have to talk bad about him behind his back like this...</p>

    <p>However, it was true that Teacher Ye indeed wasn't strong.</p>

    <p>During their noon break, this topic once again exploded in class.</p>

    <p>How could a Foundation Establishment student send a Golden Core teacher flying - this was the magical question.</p>

    <p>"Is it because he ate Shuigou Sect's fruit?" Some clever person remembered the previous Shuigou Sect incident, and Guo Hao had once said in the class group chat over the weekend that those twelve missing students had been forced to eat some type of fruit and had been imprisoned for several days before they were released.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yuncheng had been among those twelve missing students.</p>

    <p>Combined with the information from Killer Taoist when he had dropped by the villa, Wang Ling could basically confirm that Xiao Yuncheng's sudden superhuman strength had definitely been because of that fruit. Given the way things stood, the situation wasn't reassuring - one push had been strong enough to send a Golden Core cultivator flying and even cause him internal injury; even the Taichi Push Palm wasn't that amazing.</p>

    <p>At the very least, this showed that after being ingested by Xiao Yuncheng and the other students, the fruit was already starting to produce immense amounts of energy. Once it reached a saturation point, these students would be unable to bear it any longer, and their bodies would explode.</p>

    <p>This was the "spirit explosion" which Killer Taoist had specially mentioned.</p>

    <p>Head down, Wang Ling contemplated this.</p>

    <p>The national soccer team... er... these students clearly didn't have much time left.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>As a result, Shuigou Sect and the matter of these twelve missing students became the hot topic in the afternoon once again. Furthermore, after the incident with Xiao Yuncheng, the rest of the students that had been taken by Shuigou Sect previously were all examined one by one, and they were all found to have reached the late Golden Core stage! Moreover, their strength was still increasing at a steady rate!</p>

    <p>When word of this got out, Wang Ling could already hear plenty of envious and discontented voices in the school.</p>

    <p>"It turns out cultivation is actually that easy nowadays!"</p>

    <p>"Nowadays, you can eat fruit and your strength will shoot up! Come catch me, please! I also want to be a fruit user!"</p>

    <p>Before school was over for the day, Wang Ling already saw a lot of students on Tieba enviously or mockingly ask Shuigou Sect to take them away to eat fruit and transform their bodies.</p>

    <p>Even top students in the school couldn't avoid being swept with emotion, let alone those students who normally weren't as good as them. Ultimately, this trend could be traced back to the stone ghost mask back then, when countless cultivators had listened to the rumors and had chased madly after the mask for the sake of inheriting the so-called Taoist principles and taking a cultivation shortcut.</p>

    <p>But did a shortcut in cultivation truly exist?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling returned home that night, he received a rare express delivery.</p>

    <p>It was from an anonymous sender.</p>

    <p>When he opened it, he saw that it actually contained a fiery red fruit.</p>

    <p>He narrowed his eyes, then quickly opened the class group chat.</p>

    <p>As he had expected, other students from class had sent photos to the chat, saying that they had received the fruit. More and more people started to text the same thing. Based on this situation, Wang Ling guessed that every single student in Number 60 High School had received one.</p>

    <p>He now knew the reason why Shuigou Sect hadn't made a move against Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>In the end, they had been waiting for the right opportunity to mass produce fruit users in Number 60 High School...</p>
