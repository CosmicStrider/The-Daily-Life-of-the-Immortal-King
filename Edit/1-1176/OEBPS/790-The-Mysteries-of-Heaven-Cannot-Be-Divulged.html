  <h1>Chapter 790 The Mysteries of Heaven Cannot Be Divulged</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Regrettably, Wang Ling himself actually didn't know that he was on the Heavenly Dao's white list of clients.</p>

    <p>The Heavenly Dao white list wasn't made public. Once you were added to the list, it was a secret that only the Heavenly Dao knew.</p>

    <p>But whether or not Wang Ling knew that he was a white list client actually wasn't important... When all was said and done, even if he wasn't a white list client, they couldn't defeat him...</p>

    <p>Each of the Three Thousand Heavenly Dao was from a large family clan, and they were divided into numerous little golden people that differentiated between generations by size.</p>

    <p>To defeat Wang Ling, if the three thousand Heavenly Dao family clans joined hands... then they might have a faint chance of winning.</p>

    <p>A few minutes later, Wang Ling followed the little golden man's instructions and opened the Book of Heavenly Mysteries.</p>

    <p>Previously, Wang Ling had written down three questions in the book:</p>

    <p><em>One: Is President Bai, Bai Zhe, dead or not?</em></p>

    <p><em>Two: Is the angler an inhabitant of the Domain of the Gods?</em></p>

    <p><em>Three: Where on earth is the Domain of the Gods?</em></p>

    <p>The Book of Heavenly Mysteries answered the above three questions in turn.</p>

    <p>Just as Wang Ling expected.</p>

    <p>President Bai didn't die back then.</p>

    <p>During the summer camp, Wang Ling had had a bad feeling. He knew that Night Ghost Spirit Emperor had absorbed President Bai's soul, and the slap he gave Night Ghost Spirit Emperor when he invaded President Qi's mind at the time had been a little hard.</p>

    <p>After that, Wang Ling wondered if President Bai would take that opportunity to make a comeback.</p>

    <p>And sure enough, it was as he expected.</p>

    <p>This cockroach was still alive...</p>

    <p>So now the situation was a little complicated.</p>

    <p>Because President Bai would definitely continue to try and get his revenge. Also, the Heavenly Dao had already confirmed that the angler from before was someone from the Domain of the Gods...</p>

    <p>As for the location of the Domain of the Gods -</p>

    <p>The Book of Heavenly Mysteries didn't give a direct answer.</p>

    <p>According to the book, Wang Ling had to find the angler and verify the latter's identity first before the answer to the third question could be revealed...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling frowned when he saw this, since the third question was obviously the most important one.</p>

    <p>This was the little golden man's first time seeing a frustrated expression on this little master's face, and he said a little testily, "It's like this because you asked too many questions. As for the answer to the third question, the original asking price was very high; this is already a pretty good answer. After all, the mysteries of heaven cannot be divulged <sup>1</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The title of another Chinese novel..)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, Lord Diulei and Xiao Yin were enjoying a dinner of broccoli salad.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei hadn't been idle while Xiao Yin was gone. He had been looking into the identities of both the mysterious angler as well as the informant who continued to leave clues on the forum. After the incident with President Bai, the informant had continually shared new information anonymously on the cultivation forum... Lord Diulei's instinct told him that there was definitely some sort of connection between the angler and the informant.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei picked up a piece of broccoli with his fork and put it in his mouth. "Looks like a lot happened at Beast King's Remains this time?"</p>

    <p>His mouth stuffed full, Xiao Yin's words were muffled. "Unfortunately, we were still played. His Majesty Beast King wasn't dead, but had been scammed for over a thousand years..."</p>

    <p>"When will you be able to open that box which Beast King gave you?" Lord Diulei was very curious about the little black box.</p>

    <p>"It's going to take a while to open the box. His Majesty Beast King gave me a set of martial art techniques, and I have to master them first before I can open the box; I need to practice and cultivate them to at least level five first before I'll be able to open the box."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei sweated. "Level five... You haven't started practicing, have you?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin nodded. "No, I haven't; I need to start from scratch. I did consolidate the art's heart sutra on the way back."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Then... How long will you need to study for?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin sucked his finger, a look of deep contemplation on his face. "Cultivating to level one will take two or three days. Based on the martial art's increasing level of difficulty, cultivating to level five will take at least a week, so at the most half a month to a month?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Even if it took a month to cultivate to level five, that was already the speed of light...</p>

    <p>As expected, the holy beast race were monsters of the highest kind. Each holy beast could be said to be a cultivation genius blessed by their ancestors... But still the most crucial thing was their long lifespans, and apart from the relative difficulty of cultivating realms, they learned everything else quickly.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, if you compared yourself with "Silver," it would only make you angry...</p>

    <p>This learning speed was actually very astonishing, but in Xiao Yin's eyes, this was a basic operation that couldn't be any more ordinary.</p>

    <p>It was like a curve wrecker getting 98 on an exam and exclaiming over why two marks had been deducted while you sighed over how they managed to score 98 marks...</p>

    <p>This was the gap...</p>

    <p>A human's cultivation rate couldn't compare with a holy beast's at all.</p>

    <p>At this thought, Lord Diulei took a deep breath.</p>

    <p>He felt that he still had to be like Buddha in his cultivation and have patience.</p>

    <p>Old Senior Wang at the Wang family's small villa had already shown him a shortcut on the path to enlightenment â€” broccoli!</p>

    <p>Though, he had already been eating broccoli for almost two months, and had yet to comprehend the meaning inside it...</p>

    <p>However, since this was a hint from Old Senior Wang, there had to be some basis for it.</p>

    <p>Perhaps he hadn't eaten enough of it yet?</p>

    <p>Perhaps he wasn't enlightened enough yet...</p>

    <p>"What have you been playing lately? Are there any new games?" Xiao Yin nonchalantly poked at his dinner, completely unaware of the internal storm Lord Diulei was experiencing after learning of Xiao Yin's speed in learning techniques.</p>

    <p>"Games? I haven't been playing much lately. Brother Xiao... games are a waste of time. Originally, to help you to quickly adapt to the human world, I didn't tell you about the evils of playing games. Do you know how many people play until they lose all their money through small purchases?"</p>

    <p>"That bad?" Xiao Yin rubbed his head.</p>

    <p>It was clear that he had no idea at all.</p>

    <p>"Of course it's that bad!" Lord Diulei's expression was very solemn. "You should know, to obtain the legendary gold card, some people will frequently pay a very hefty price: usually, people who look for the meaning of life in a game are often hollow in reality. Brother Xiao, you should find something to do that has more meaning."</p>

    <p>"Aren't I writing a novel?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin spread his hands. "Although I don't write as well as Senior Wang, I actually feel it's not too bad. And in any case, games don't actually cost much, plus I rarely spend money..."</p>

    <p>"Then last month, you..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei recalled Xiao Yin's e-bill last month.</p>

    <p>The online purchases section took up over sixty pages...</p>

    <p>"Thunder, think of it this way: the money I spend on games... can it be as much as I spend on takeout?"</p>

    <p>"Er... it doesn't seem so..."</p>

    <p>"Then that's fine. As long as I'm not spending more money on takeout than on games, then that's proof that I'm not a good-for-nothing Silver."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was taken aback. "..." What kind of devilish reasoning was that?</p>

    <p>To be fair, Lord Diulei thought that this wasn't all Xiao Yin's fault.</p>

    <p>It was he who had spoilt Xiao Yin rotten.</p>

    <p>It wasn't right to be addicted to games. Lord Diulei felt that he had to guide Xiao Yin back onto the right path as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>"I've started prepping for a new project recently. Brother Xiao, do you have time to take part? Just nice, you can also gather some source material for your novel," Lord Diulei cleared his throat and asked.</p>

    <p>"What project? Tell me about it?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei looked at Xiao Yin in deadly earnest. "I'm preparing to establish a sect."</p>
