  <h1>Chapter 224 The Correct Way to Use "Impure Earth Reincarnation" </h1>

  <div>

    <p>After inhaling the white haze, Wang Ling's stomach instantly swelled like a balloon, but very quickly, he purified the poisonous haze internally. A Sage Body wasn't just impervious to external harm; its organs' purifying ability was top-class and could break down any type of exotic poison in the world in a split second.</p>

    <p>Looking at this scene, Wang Ming finally heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>"Chen Chao? Chen Chao?"</p>

    <p>He prodded Chen Chao, but the brat showed no signs of waking up. Instantly, Wang Ming was a little unhappy. He had privately thought that the only other person in the world aside from Wang Ling who he would hold in his arms was his future wife! Under normal circumstances, he would definitely have never allowed a third person to take advantage of him.</p>

    <p>Looking at the deep consideration in Wang Ming's expression, Wang Ling knew, even without reading Wang Ming's heart, that this idiot elder brother of his was most likely thinking about nonsense again.</p>

    <p>The tip of Wang Ling's finger lit up with a small sphere of white light, and he touched it to Chen Chao's forehead, using the Great Purification Spell to dispel from inside the other boy's body the poisonous white haze which Chen Chao had inhaled.</p>

    <p>Although he was still unconscious, his condition was no longer so serious.</p>

    <p>What they had to do now was to find the source of this poisonous white haze.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling narrowed his eyes. Opening the Heavenly Eye to its maximum level, he began scanning the ruins inch by inch like a searchlight.</p>

    <p>The origin of the white haze was very abnormal; furthermore, Wang Ling felt that there was something familiar about it...</p>

    <p>He remembered when he had been duped into acting as a spells consultant for the Seven Stars Cultivation Special Forces three years ago; when he had entered the Gate Between Worlds at the time to save Old Li and his group, it seemed to have contained some elements similar to what was in this poisonous white haze... when he considered this, a light bulb lit up in Wang Ling's mind.</p>

    <p>He remembered; this white haze contained the demon qi found in the Gate Between Worlds!</p>

    <p>But why would there be demon qi here?</p>

    <p>While he was pondering this, his eyes caught sight of something behind a stone pillar in the center of the ruins.</p>

    <p>There, he found... an array-guiding flag!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Underground in the small world, the old devil reopened a secret chamber; it had been completely enveloped in the Purple Gold Gourd's fog, which had formed a natural barrier that had thoroughly cut the chamber off from all outside interference.</p>

    <p>In front of the old devil was a crystal sarcophagus which housed a skeleton. The entire skeleton had been preserved perfectly. It looked like a carved work of art; every bone was crystal clear and sparkled.</p>

    <p>In the stone ghost mask, Jiang Liuyue was stunned.</p>

    <p>This was the first time that she had come face-to-face with a skeleton of an Ancient Almighty.</p>

    <p>This was a skeleton worthy of this old devil who had once created tumultuous waves in Huaxiu nation... Jiang Liuyue already couldn't imagine who the Ancient Almighty behind this skeleton had been. At the very least, it had to have been a great senior above the Fusion stage! Jiang Liuyue guessed the Almighty's prowess should have been between the Ascension stage and the Immortalization stage.</p>

    <p>"Are you shocked?" The old devil stroked the crystal sarcophagus and sighed deeply. "Two thousand years ago, when my venerable self found this skeleton, how could I also not look upon it with such amazement? This skeleton is so perfect, it's almost as if it had been tailor-made for my venerable self..."</p>

    <p>Two... two thousand years? Once again, Jiang Liuyue was amazed by the old devil's long-term vision. Had he unexpectedly already found a way out for himself at that time?</p>

    <p>With his hands behind his back, the old devil did some calculations. "It's already been a while since the array-guiding flag has been set up; the demon qi from the Gate Between Worlds should have already penetrated this little world, and the Gate is about to descend... now is the time to set up the reincarnation array!"</p>

    <p>Saying this, the old devil opened the crystal sarcophagus.</p>

    <p>Free of the restrictions of the crystal sarcophagus, the pressure which the skeleton of the Ancient Almighty emanated was simply suffocating.</p>

    <p>The moment the sarcophagus was opened, mighty pressure abruptly fell on them.</p>

    <p>The ground under the old devil's feet trembled, and both his legs sunk into the earth from the pressure.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, he had made preparations earlier, and thanks to the cassock he was wearing plus the protective light which covered his body, he was just barely able to withstand the pressure.</p>

    <p>"Everything is within my calculations!" The old devil smiled slightly. As he spoke, he waved his hand, and eight candles instantly appeared in this narrow underground space.</p>

    <p>The first step in setting up the reincarnation array was a crucial one, and involved using magic power to light the candles with the flames of the underworld. During the reincarnation process, any one of the candles going out would lead to failure. This was also the reason why the old devil had chosen to open the space underground.</p>

    <p>"Next, as long as my venerable self fleshes out this skeleton and absorbs vitality, we will have succeeded!" Looking at the eight candles as they lit up, the old devil's movements started to become more cautious.</p>

    <p>In the stone ghost mask, Jiang Liuyue saw the old devil take out two sacks from his storage space.</p>

    <p>"Lord Devil Emperor, this is...?"</p>

    <p>"It's impure earth," the old devil replied in a low voice. "My venerable self just needs to put it on the skeleton and start the reincarnation array, and it will be done."</p>

    <p>So it was impure earth?</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue was once again dumbstruck, shocked to the extreme in her heart. "Don't tell me, is this... the legendary Impure Earth Reincarnation Spell <sup>1</sup>?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Impure Earth Reincarnation Spell: The official English translation is 'Impure World Reincarnation.' This is a jutsu in the anime 'Naruto' that is used to bind the soul of a dead person to a living being.)</dfn>

    <p>"Impure Earth Reincarnation? You're referring to 'life,' <sup>2</sup> right?" The old devil sneered. "This kind of spell actually doesn't exist at all. How can one be reborn just by simply molding impure earth into a body? Do you take those Ancient Almightys for fools?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Life: This will make more sense by the end of the chapter, but the word for reincarnation in Chinese literally translates to 'turn life.' The old devil is taking issue with the word for 'life,' sheng .)</dfn>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue: "..."</p>

    <p>"The requirements for reconstructing a body for reincarnation are very demanding. Apart from finding a skeleton which matches your body type, you also need sufficient amounts of impure earth. On top of these basic requirements, you still need to consider the issue of the reincarnation array. These are all non-negotiable."</p>

    <p>The old devil sighed. "Furthermore, the sale of impure earth has probably been banned in every country as it's probably a strictly regulated natural resource now, as valuable as tukela <sup>3</sup>. My venerable self found two sacks of impure earth in the tomb of this great master when I found this skeleton. I believe that this Almighty had initially intended to use it for himself, but unfortunately his days were numbered, and he wasn't lucky enough to enjoy it."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(Tukela: This refers to the fertile but highly friable soil of the Loess Plateau in China.)</dfn>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue was taken aback. "So, Lord Devil Emperor, you just happened to find this?"</p>

    <p>"You can't say that." The old devil shook his head. "The ability to take advantage of a situation is also a reflection of your luck. Back then, it would have only taken a little more for Yi Jianchuan to completely destroy me, but unfortunately for him, he hadn't thought that due to my carelessness, I would seal myself into the stone ghost mask, which resulted in my aura vanishing from the world. My flesh might have disappeared, but the time that I was sealed away enabled my soul to recover. So, all of this proves that my venerable self isn't meant to die..."</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue: "Then may I ask, senior, what is the spell that you are using now?"</p>

    <p>The old devil: "Have you heard of the Impure Earth Body-Turning Spell? I'm referring to 'body' <sup>4</sup>."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>4</sup>(Body: The words 'body' and 'life' in Chinese have almost the same pronunciation.)</dfn>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue: "Impure Earth... Body-Turning Spell?"</p>

    <p>"That's right."</p>

    <p>The old devil nodded.</p>

    <p>After he spoke, the old devil used his spirit energy to turn the skeleton of the Ancient Almighty in front of him over. "So, the key to this spell is to cover both sides of the skeleton with impure earth. When you're doing this, you must always, always remember... to turn it over."</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue: "..."</p>
