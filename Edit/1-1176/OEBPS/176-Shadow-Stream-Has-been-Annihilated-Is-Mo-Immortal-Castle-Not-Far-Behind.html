  <h1>Chapter 176 Shadow Stream Has been Annihilated; Is Mo Immortal Castle Not Far Behind? </h1>

  <div>

    <p>The appearance of this stone chest was a huge revelation for Lord Diulei. As for why it had been in the hands of the Shadow Stream killers, it actually wasn't hard to guess after careful consideration. After all, the stone ghost mask was something that opportunists scrambled madly for in a bid to obtain great power within a short time frame.</p>

    <p>It wasn't just Mo Immortal Castle that was looking for it; dark forces were also carrying out their own investigations, which wasn't anything odd.</p>

    <p>But the fact of the matter was that with the annihilation of Shadow Stream's headquarters, there was no opportunity for international killer organizations to rise up. This was also true of the dark forces within Huaxiu that had initially been stirring restlessly. The saying that guilt made cowards of people was really true. Through the Shadow Stream incident, these dark forces could clearly sense that in Huaxiu nation, there was an expert whom they were incapable of touching or detecting...</p>

    <p>His mastery over spatial magic, the fluctuations of which even the space tower couldn't detect precisely, was really too abnormal.</p>

    <p>Later, Lord Diulei left with this mask chest. Wang Ling had never wanted to become involved in this matter since the beginning, so it was best to leave it to the other man... before the latter left, Grandfather Wang also praised him for the quality of the broccoli which he had planted.</p>

    <p>Then, from the window on the second floor, Wang Ling saw this idiot bounce off with a face full of excitement as if the kindergarten teacher had awarded him a little red flower.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After leaving the villa, Lord Diulei went to Midnight Dining Hall. Before midnight, the small, shabby shop was as wretchedly dilapidated and desolate as usual. Boss Tan was still doing the dishes inside. When he saw Lord Diulei, his expression was blank for a bit before he lifted his eyes slightly. "Yo, come to have noodles again?"</p>

    <p>Frankly speaking, Lord Diulei had felt that Boss Tan's beef noodles was nothing special. But today, he had come with a question again. Now that he was here, it wouldn't be nice to start asking without ordering anything.</p>

    <p>Pondering for a while, he asked, "Are there any other dishes...?"</p>

    <p>"Ah... yes, there is. I learned a dish from my shifu recently called elk velvet antlers and pine jellyfish soup. Are you interested? It's made from imported ingredients, so it's a little expensive, but it definitely tastes better than when my shifu uses local ingredients for the soup," the boss replied after thinking for a moment.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei's expression was blank. "Er, aren't elk velvet antlers and pine jellyfish local ingredients?"</p>

    <p>Boss Tan threw up his hands. "They used to be... but Aoxiu nation applied earlier on for these two soup ingredients to be declared cultural heritages. They're just as shameless as Nanhan nation, which claims that everything originated with them."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Then I'll order one..."</p>

    <p>Anyway, if it wasn't good, he wouldn't pay for it!</p>

    <p>"Go on then, why are you looking for me?" Boss Tan looked up at Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>First time strangers and second time friends; this routine of asking questions while ordering was something he was quite familiar with.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei didn't beat around the bush; with a flash of spirit light, the mask chest dropped on the table with a "duang" sound. "This thing, boss, have you seen it before?"</p>

    <p>Boss Tan didn't say anything and only lowered his head to concentrate on the ingredients in his hands. He chopped the elk velvet antlers into pieces and sliced the transparent pine jelly. After washing them in the colander and then putting them into an earthenware pot, he added some spice and then covered it with the pot lid. After doing all this, Boss Tan raised his head and stared at Lord Diulei. "Do you mind if I smoke?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei shook his head, but secretly used his spirit energy to control his nose hairs and modify them for filter mode. Nobody would expect that this Great Death-Courting Senior was someone who didn't smoke. Furthermore, he had developed this simple spell for controlling his nose hairs himself; it was an effective way of reducing the harmful effects of passive smoking.</p>

    <p>Boss Tan took a drag on the cigarette. "The truth is that this chest was indeed made by one of my friends."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei's eyes instantly sparkled â€” this was very important information!</p>

    <p>Actually, Boss Tan had recently started feeling concerned about the stone ghost mask. Although he had chosen to live a secluded life, it was undeniable that the mask which he had originally made with that little girl was creating unpredictable waves in this world. The government and light forces were looking for these two masks to seal them, while the dark forces wanted to use the masks to become a power to be reckoned with.</p>

    <p>"Back then, we spared no effort to make this thing." Boss Tan sighed deeply. "Unfortunately, I have to tell you that the maker of this stone chest has passed away."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei's eyes dimmed. Although he badly wanted to ask how that person had died, it would be a little abrupt and rude.</p>

    <p>He had known that this Boss Tan's identity was definitely a complicated one; given the way his aura waxed and waned, he was very likely a great senior whose level he had no hope of matching...</p>

    <p>Of course, this was all just speculation.</p>

    <p>But Lord Diulei had ineffable confidence in himself, since his sixth sense tended to be accurate!</p>

    <p>Boss Tan fixed his eyes on the stone chest for a long time. It was clear that he didn't want to share the reason why his friend had passed away. He was silent for a while before he finally gave Lord Diulei a warning. "I suggest that you give up on following this lead. If you continue, whether it's you or your genius friend who can write songs, it'll go very badly for the both of you. This isn't something you can touch."</p>

    <p>He touched the knife scar on the right side of his face. "Do you see this knife scar...?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei frowned. "Judging from the wound, you were hurt by a magic weapon?"</p>

    <p>"It's easy to join a sect, but it's hard to get out. Sometimes, if you sink too deep into the muddy water, it's difficult to pull yourself out," Boss Tan said. "I got this knife scar back when I left the sect. At that time, fighting had broken out, which was when I got this scar..."</p>

    <p>Saying this, Boss Tan was heartbroken. "This injury was caused by a holy weapon. Given my realm at that time, even if my body was cured, there was no way to heal this knife scar. I've tried so many cosmetic beauty institutions over the years, but all in vain. When I think about back then... I was the sect male beauty, and there were so many sect female beauties who were waiting on me. I used to be an idol type! I earned a living with my face!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Was this scar a blade wound?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, not really."</p>

    <p>Boss Tan shook his head like a rattle-drum. "When I was fleeing the sect, I accidentally tripped and fell, and my face was slashed by a knife that happened to be on the ground..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>
