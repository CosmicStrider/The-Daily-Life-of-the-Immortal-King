  <h1>Chapter 978 Bai Youquan</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Although the second generation intrinsic spirit field was powerful, Fang Xing knew he couldn't let this battle drag out. His intrinsic spirit field's attribute was gravity, and anyone who stepped inside wouldn't be able to move so much as an inch.</p>

    <p>The identity of anyone inside the intrinsic spirit field would also be fully revealed, and Fang Xing saw the person's appearance clearly: it was a familiar-looking person with deathly white skin.</p>

    <p>The teenager wore a white shirt and jeans with suspenders under a gray coat, which gave him a very elegant air.</p>

    <p>"Bai Zhe?" Fang Xing was taken aback; he never expected this President Bai to actually still be alive.</p>

    <p>As far as he remembered, Bai Zhe had already been destroyed along with Devil Gut Fungus Lord, as if they had been struck down by a god; even their souls had been annihilated. There was no possibility of them being resurrected.</p>

    <p>The person standing in front of him had the same face as Bai Zhe.</p>

    <p>Bewildered and uncertain, Fang Xing knitted his eyebrows as he stared at the other party with a wary expression.</p>

    <p>"No, you're not Bai Zhe..." Fang Xing frowned. Although this person resembled Bai Zhe very closely, their auras were entirely different.</p>

    <p>The teenager with the deathly white face applauded. "As expected of the descendant of True Immortal She Pi. You can actually tell us apart. That's right, I am indeed not Bai Zhe, but his son, Bai Youquan."</p>

    <p>"He has a son?" Fang Xing was astonished.</p>

    <p>Bai Youquan smiled somewhat tauntingly. "True Immortal She Pi shook the cultivation world with his might back then and there wasn't anyone who didn't know him. But everyone knows he remained unmarried and alone until the end of this life. It was only at the end of his imprisonment that he gave birth to you. If a damn tranny can have an heir, why can't my dad?"</p>

    <p>"Shut your mouth!"</p>

    <p>Fang Xing grit his teeth as his fury surged and stirred his golden hair. He glared angrily at Bai Youquan. "Now that you're in my intrinsic spirit field, don't think of escaping!"</p>

    <p>With one stomp of his foot, the ground in front of him instantly collapsed!</p>

    <p>His footprint expanded to leave a deep hole in the ground. At the same time, a massive meteor came crashing down toward the deep hole.</p>

    <p>Bai Youquan had clearly come prepared. Although he was stuck inside that deep hole, there wasn't the slightest change in his expression.</p>

    <p>He had been expecting the second generation intrinsic spirit energy, which was a family legacy and which contained True Immortal She Pi's power. Furthermore, Fang Xing had never stopped refining it all these years, and what Bai Youquan faced now was eighty-nine times the gravity.</p>

    <p>Indeed, it was hard for him to take even a single step.</p>

    <p>Under such heavy gravity, even a True Immortal would find it hard to move. Bai Youquan knew that as a mere Soul Formation cultivator, he didn't have the slightest chance of winning in a showdown with Fang Xing using normal cultivation methods.</p>

    <p>However...</p>

    <p>In the next moment, a golden light enveloped Bai Youquan's body and he flew out of the hole.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing stared fixedly at Bai Youquan, who was giving off an exceedingly strange air.</p>

    <p>What Bai Youquan was using wasn't spirit qi!</p>

    <p>Instead, it was a power that Fang Xing had never seen before!</p>

    <p>Fang Xing knew that previously, in order to deal with Wang Ling, Bai Zhe had collected four Outer Dao. However, the strength which Bai Youquan was revealing now far surpassed that of Outer Dao.</p>

    <p>"Not divine magic, not Outer Dao... and not Divine Dao." This was beyond Fang Xing's expectations. Bai Youquan didn't have a high realm, but he was displaying strength beyond what he should have.</p>

    <p>Slowly rising out of the hole, Bai Youquan gave off an aura which Fang Xing had never sensed before. "True Immortal She Pi's son truly lives up to his name. But I hear that you have another form. If you don't use it, I'm afraid you might not be my match."</p>

    <p>His voice was low, but every word penetrated the marrow and seemed to reverberate in the soul and echo throughout the intrinsic spirit field.</p>

    <p>"If you won't do it, then I'll act first." With one step, Bai Youquan shot forward, his aura splitting the air like a dragon blade and the earth crumbling in his wake to create a terrifying abyss.</p>

    <p>"Even this is so destructive..." Fang Xing was shocked. Wrapped in that strange aura, the other party was able to move so easily in eighty-nine times gravity - this wasn't the strength of a Soul Formation cultivator.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Fang, give up. You're not my match, much less my father's." Bai Youquan sneered, and sent Fang Xing flying backward and spitting out blood with one punch.</p>

    <p>Moving extremely fast, he aimed his second punch at Fang Xing's leg.</p>

    <p>"Snake scales!" Fang Xing responded swiftly as he sent out his life bonded magic treasure to form a protective barrier when the punch landed, but it could only cushion the impact.</p>

    <p>This no-frills and ruthless punch was enough to fracture Fang Xing's hip bone.</p>

    <p>"It's over, Classmate Fang." Bai Youquan recited a spell, and the suspenders he was wearing suddenly slipped off him to firmly wrap themselves around Fang Xing's limbs like tentacles!</p>

    <p>Under Fang Xing's stunned gaze, Bai Youquan stood in front of him in just his pants; even the gray coat and white shirt had been taken off.</p>

    <p>A flasher...</p>

    <p>Fang Xing stared at the other party, a storm raging in his heart. This person's realm was strange - although it wasn't high, he exhibited strength beyond his realm, and used power that Fang Xing had never seen before.</p>

    <p>"Who wants me captured?" Fang Xing knew that it was pointless to go all out in battle for now, and he looked at Bai Youquan as he asked his question.</p>

    <p>"My father wants to meet you." Bai Youquan smiled. "As you can see, I'm only at the Soul Formation stage, but I'm far stronger than a True Immortal - even the Ten Generals aren't necessarily my match. And my father is still a dozen times stronger than I am!"</p>

    <p>"Your father should already be dead..."</p>

    <p>"Who determines life and death in this world? This is simply fate." Bai Youquan shrugged.</p>

    <p>"What do you want from me..."</p>

    <p>"There's no need to beat around the bush, Classmate Fang, you can't escape me. There's no harm in telling you the truth. We're looking for True Immortal She Pi's cremation urn. After his death, the authorities gave it to you. If you give it to us, who knows, we might be able to resurrect your father."</p>

    <p>"You want to bring my father back to life?" Fang Xing was shocked.</p>

    <p>Bai Youquan: "I'm not clear on how, but my father was resurrected too. I'm sure that for you, bringing your father back to life is a worthwhile deal. Surely you have many questions you want to ask him?"</p>

    <p>Fang Xing: "What do you want from my father?"</p>

    <p>Bai Youquan: "Everyone knows True Immortal She Pi gave birth to you on his own. When it comes to infertility, he's an expert in this field. Who else can I look for if not him?"</p>

    <p>Fang Xing: "..."</p>
