  <h1>Chapter 290 Who Is Your Plastic Surgeon? </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling had long heard of familiars, but had never expected to encounter any so soon.</p>

    <p>With the pattern left by a familiar on the stone brick as evidence, it went without saying that Immortal Mansion was indeed linked to familiars.</p>

    <p>Summoning familiars was strictly banned under Huaxiu's laws; like certain methods of legacy inheritance, they were on the list of crimes of "opportunistic reactionary cultivation."</p>

    <p>However, the main problem at the moment wasn't the familiars. Instead, what was worth pondering was how the Master of Immortal Mansion had learned the magic array to summon familiars.</p>

    <p>A thought struck Lord Diulei. "There was a time when there were rumors about a magic array for summoning familiars being sold on the market; in the end, it turned out to be just a hoax. Some criminals had disguised a teleportation array as a familiar-summoning array, and had tricked a lot of people into frantically dropping antiques inside it..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Also, a lot of people only know half the truth about the familiar-summoning array; not all so-called antiques or relics can be used to summon a familiar. To do so, the relic must contain tremendous amounts of remaining spirit energy... For example, if Dharmaraja used the godly thunder inheritance as a medium and combined it with the familiar-summoning magic array, it would definitely work," said Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded at his explanation. After all, the godly thunder inheritance was a holy relic left behind by the Thunder Clan.</p>

    <p>"But that would be breaking the law. Even if Dharmaraja knew the familiar-summoning magic array, he would never use it." Lord Diulei sighed and waved his hand. "Brother Ling, why don't you keep this brick first? Just this brick would be enough evidence of the Master of Immortal Mansion's huge crime and the volatile threat it poses to national security; this is already even worse than what the old devil did."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling put the brick away in his vision field. As they were about to move, they suddenly heard the sound of hasty footsteps at the entrance of these two female cultivators' residence.</p>

    <p>"Someone is coming!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei quickly dragged the two female cultivators further inside.</p>

    <p>After a handful of seconds, a female cultivator shouted at the front door, "Beauty? Discount? Are you here? Justice Elder has called us to gather together and discuss how we will deal with the intruders."</p>

    <p>"Shall I open the door, Brother Ling?"</p>

    <p>While Lord Diulei was hesitating, the female cultivator outside in the end directly pushed the door open and came in.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling noticed that this slit-eyed female cultivator's Taoist robes were orange in color. From the memories of the previous two female cultivators, he immediately knew that she was a top-level Immortal Mansion inheriting disciple, with a higher rank then inner sect disciples. The Taoist robes worn by elder disciples were purple.</p>

    <p>The slit-eyed female cultivator caught sight of them from ten meters away.</p>

    <p>In that instant, the young man in white felt like his brain was buzzing.</p>

    <p>What should they do?</p>

    <p>Were they going to be exposed?</p>

    <p>After about ten seconds of silence, this slit-eyed female cultivator exclaimed, "Wow! Beauty? Discount? How did you turn into this? Did you have plastic surgery without shifu's permission?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>The slit-eyed female cultivator moved closer and swept her gaze up and down Wang Ling. "You're Discount, right? Your oval face is the same!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>The female cultivator look at him. "Which Mansion plastic surgeon did your face? I think your dead fish eyes are quite in character! Not bad, not bad!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>After that, she looked at Lord Diulei, and stroked her chin. "Beauty, did you increase your height and get breast implants?"</p>

    <p>"Anyway, why is Senior Sister Ya Xuan looking for us?" Lord Diulei used spirit energy to change his voice, imitating the female cultivator with the online celebrity face from before as he spoke. He had seen the word "Ya Xuan" on the nameplate at her waist, and knew that it had to be her Taoist name.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei remembered that the two ladies with the celebrity face and oval face had also had nameplates at their waists, but he hadn't taken them.</p>

    <p>"Looks like we better take the nameplates with us, otherwise it'll definitely look suspicious," thought Lord Diulei... even though they already looked pretty suspicious now.</p>

    <p>"I came to let you know that Justice Elder wants all inner sect disciples to gather together." This Senior Sister Ya Xuan gave the disguised Wang Ling and Lord Diulei a very solemn look. "The matter this time is very serious, and she wants you to go over as soon as possible. You know the flat top on Yuntai Pavilion? Assemble there in ten minutes."</p>

    <p>"Yes, Senior Sister Ya Xuan."</p>

    <p>"Don't be late, hey." The slit-eyed female cultivator smiled.</p>

    <p>After that, she went to the next palace with the message.</p>

    <p>Watching her walk off into the distance, Lord Diulei couldn't help sweating. Just now, she had been so close, almost face to face, but in the end she hadn't seen through their disguises... It seemed that not everyone with slit eyes were monsters <sup>1</sup> â€” some were just blind!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A reminder that slit eyes in
anime, manga and gaming
culture can denote a
conniving or sinister
personality)</dfn>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Following instructions, Wang Ling and Lord Diulei arrived on the flat top of Yuntai Pavilion ten minutes later. Wang Ling hadn't known the specific location of the pavilion, but when the senior sister had come to the palace earlier, he had left a spirit mark on her.</p>

    <p>That Sister Ya Xuan was already there ahead of time. Standing next to her on a platform on the flat top was a female elder in purple Taoist robes.</p>

    <p>At the moment, several hundred inner sect disciples had gathered on the flat top, and Wang Ling and Lord Diulei slipped into the line-up. These inner sect female disciples were all trembling under the elder's wrath.</p>

    <p>"I just did a headcount, and I've noticed that two people have actually yet to arrive!"</p>

    <p>The female elder in purple sucked in a deep breath. "Master is already furious! Furthermore, he suspects that some spies have already infiltrated our ranks. These people who have snuck into our Immortal Mansion are likely to be disguised as our disciples! In an emergency situation like this, there are people who are actually late! Ya Xuan, can't you do things properly?"</p>

    <p>Under this harsh reprimand, the slit-eyed female cultivator trembled slightly. "This disciple was careless, I will take any punishment..."</p>

    <p>"You certainly will be punished." The elder hmphed. "Who are these two missing female disciples? Give me their names!"</p>

    <p>"They are Little Bamboo and Little Chrysanthemum. I did let them know." The slit-eyed female cultivator felt wronged. "But it seems they've put on weight recently, and are probably having trouble climbing the mountain..."</p>

    <p>The elder in purple was stupefied. "Put on weight?"</p>

    <p>It was just as she said this that Wang Ling and Lord Diulei saw in the distance two stout female cultivators reach the top of the stairs to the flat top. Because their Taoist robes were too short, their calves were directly exposed, and their leg hair fluttered in the wind...</p>

    <p>This scene almost made Lord Diulei cough up blood.</p>

    <p>Brother Ling... I feel like my eyes have been blinded, Brother Ling!</p>
