  <h1>Chapter 793 The General Office of Strategic Deception's Goon Squad</h1>

  <div>

    <p>For some reason, Xiao Yin felt that this name didn't seem very reliable!</p>

    <p>"This name doesn't sound very conventional?" Xiao Yin asked diffidently.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei just shrugged and spread his hands. "A regular name won't attract new students. Also, let me ask you, Brother Xiao, who among the people around us is conventional?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was instantly blank at this question.</p>

    <p>He was truly stumped.</p>

    <p>Because it was indeed like Thunder said: there wasn't a single conventional person among them.</p>

    <p>"I thought a lot about the plan for the sect, but the name was fixed a long time ago. Cailian Zhenren also knew about it then, and praised it for being an avant garde name." Lord Diulei grinned and gave a thumbs-up. "After Brother Luo performs maintenance on Wuji, I've already gotten him to get Wuji to bring Cailian Zhenren, Brother Er Ha and Dharmaraja here for a meeting. Brother To was also going to come, but I heard that there's been new developments with that girl from the kun's belly, and he's now doubling his efforts in that regard."</p>

    <p>Speaking of the girl from the kun's belly, Zhuo Yi had shared details of her case with Devil King back in Beast King's Remains back then, and Devil King had instantly felt that she was inextricably connected with the Domain of the Gods.</p>

    <p>Hence, Xiao Yin was immediately startled when he heard this. "She's going to wake up?"</p>

    <p>This was a big deal!</p>

    <p>"When Brother Ling was at the summer camp, her toes finally moved!" Lord Diulei said, "Brother Toya is now trying something new, and is sticking acupuncture needles into the soles of her feet."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "Damn..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was still August 5th on the fifteenth Saturday of the semester.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei's sect project was in full swing.</p>

    <p>Today, a lot of big shots were gathered in his Wenxian Garden villa. Those in the chat group who could come had come: Zhuo Yi, Lightning Dharmaraja, Cailian Zhenren, Luo Chuang, Fang Xing and Er Ha.</p>

    <p>They would be the core members of the future "General Office of Strategic Deception" sect, and would be responsible for a department each.</p>

    <p>Under each department leader, many branches could also be created, like a 1st division, 2nd division, and so on.</p>

    <p>If future disciple recruits made great contributions to the sect, they could become division leaders. While their authority wouldn't be on the level of the chief department leader, they would enjoy the same treatment.</p>

    <p>"Our sect is one big loving family - this is our sect's core tenet. If you don't have any problem with that, I'm going to explain the role that each core member present here will play after the sect is founded."</p>

    <p>Saying this, he delivered into everyone's hands, as well as Er Ha's paws, a project blueprint handbook for the sect which he had prepared beforehand.</p>

    <p>"My initial thought was for Brother Ling to be the deputy chief or honorary chief, but given Brother Ling's personality, it's unlikely he will agree to my willful request. So if nothing unexpected happens, Brother Zhuo will assume the roles of deputy chief of the General Office of Strategic Deception, leader of the supervisory and investigation team, as well as leader of the scapegoat team.</p>

    <p>"Brother Dharmaraja will be the leader of the logistics team, which will be mainly responsible for the maintenance and general layout of our sect.</p>

    <p>"Cailian Zhenren and Brother Toya, who isn't here, will be in charge of the medicine team. Cailian Zhenren will be deputy leader and Immortal Toya the leader.</p>

    <p>"Brother Luo, needless to say, will be the leader of the magic treasures team.</p>

    <p>"Brother Dog, leader of the spirit beast team.</p>

    <p>"Brother Fang Xing, leader of the goon squad."</p>

    <p>When Lord Diulei was done assigning the main positions, Dharmaraja was immediately blank. "Wait! What the hell is the goon squad?"</p>

    <p>He dimly recalled what Lord Diulei had just said.</p>

    <p>Wasn't this future sect supposed to be a big, harmonious and loving family?</p>

    <p>Why was there such a strange department like the goon squad?!</p>

    <p>"This goon squad is essential. Although nowadays there isn't any heated conflict between sects, it's necessary for us to set up some kind of security team in case someone drops by to stir up trouble. So this goon squad is actually a security organization."</p>

    <p>Everyone was blank at what he said.</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang waved his palm-leaf fan and offered a very constructive suggestion. "So the goon squad needs to be equipped with a full set of magic treasures, doesn't it? It'll at least look a little more official if we have a Daoist robe uniform as a dress code. But we'll need funding."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry about funding, our sect has ample start-up capital," Lord Diulei said. "As for the Daoist robe Brother Luo mentioned, that's a definite must. Our sect isn't a conventional one, but we still need to be united and have a standard management system in place. But the robe design can be simple and doesn't have to be too complicated. We're just a goon squad, we're not going to war."</p>

    <p>Narrowing his phoenix eyes, Fang Xing stroked his chin. "If someone drops by to make trouble, how far can we go?"</p>

    <p>"Brother Fang Xing hasn't looked at the handbook yet, right? There's a detailed outline for the goon squad in it; I remember that it's on page 68." Lord Diulei smiled faintly.</p>

    <p>When everyone flipped to page 68, they all revealed stunned expressions on their faces.</p>

    <p>Holy shit, was this the legendary goon squad?</p>

    <p>It was truly awesome...</p>

    <p>And so harmonious!</p>

    <p>The goon squad...</p>

    <p>Really were just slapping hands <sup>1</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The Chinese word for 'goon' or
'hired thug' is 打手, which
literally translates to 'hit the
hand.')</dfn>

    <p>Screw the goon squad!</p>

    <p>"Everyone see it?"</p>

    <p>Gazing at everyone's expressions, Lord Diulei's smile didn't waver. "As a big harmonious and loving family, the General Office of Strategic Deception will never act outrageously. This is the so-called 'avoid hitting someone else's face <sup>2</sup> ,' so our goon squad is only allowed to hit the other party's hands."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>('Avoid hitting someone else's
face and cursing someone's
shortcomings' is a Chinese
saying which means 'to avoid
attacking someone where they
are the most vulnerable .. ')</dfn>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>A moment later, Dharmaraja took a deep breath. "But will this type of protection really be effective?"</p>

    <p>"Why not? Slapping the hands is the easiest and also most civilized form of physical protest. What it needs to be is quick, accurate, and crisp. On this point, I'm going to have Brother Ling share his experience with the goon squad later."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei smiled. "After all, those three men in Songhai Prison were all sent there by Brother Ling's slaps."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>At that moment, Zhuo Yi suddenly jumped to his feet. "Senior Immortal, excuse me."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Brother Zhuo, please speak."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi shook his phone. "It's like this: there's been a response to the investment plan Senior Immortal submitted to the municipal Green Sect Enterprise Investment Committee."</p>

    <p>The Green Sect Enterprise Investment Committee was an angel investment foundation set up by Huaxiu nation's Finance Ministry more than ten years ago to support newly set-up light forces.</p>

    <p>It was also aimed at encouraging more sects to follow procedure and apply for legal business permits.</p>

    <p>"That's great, Brother Zhuo! How much is this boss willing to invest?" asked Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>Although they had a huge amount of start-up capital, they naturally wouldn't decline if someone wanted to invest with them, which would benefit the future development of the sect.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "That boss said that if the sect picks a good location, he'll consider injecting a billion first."</p>

    <p>"Just a billion?"</p>

    <p>"A billion... immortal gold."</p>

    <p>"WTF..."</p>
