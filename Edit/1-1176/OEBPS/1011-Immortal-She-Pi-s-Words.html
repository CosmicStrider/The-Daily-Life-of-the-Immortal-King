  <h1>Chapter 1011 Immortal She Pi's Words</h1>

  <div>

    <p>With so many experts taking action at the same time, they took control of the warped Five Great Altars in the Palace of Mirrors very quickly.</p>

    <p>Only the Altar of Fire was left...</p>

    <p>The Altar of Fire envoy seemed to still be putting up a stiff resistance, but the altar's distorted nature had in fact already been fixed by Lord Diulei and the others. Now, the Altar of Fire envoy was nothing more than a spent arrow and wasn't a threat at all.</p>

    <p>What everyone had to do next was execute the five altar envoy substitutes at the same time, and the guardian envoys who had been murdered by the shadow army previously would be resurrected by Divine Dao and would take back their positions. The Five Great Altars would recover their strength, and the Palace of Mirrors would become peaceful once again.</p>

    <p>"Senior Immortal, aren't we going to act now?" Cailian Zhenren asked. She was worried that some mishap would happen if they continued to delay.</p>

    <p>"Just a little longer..." Lord Diulei stared into the sky.</p>

    <p>It wasn't just him, but everyone was waiting at that moment.</p>

    <p>They were waiting for someone's return.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Fang Xing could sense that something had happened outside.</p>

    <p>Taking a horde of black shadow soldiers with him, Bai Youquan had already left the place Fang Xing was imprisoned in.</p>

    <p>Although his strength had been suppressed, Fang Xing, who had cultivated the Snake Form since childhood, had an unusually acute sense for danger.</p>

    <p>Bai Youquan had left in a hurry, as if something big had happened outside.</p>

    <p>And most importantly, Fang Xing had already sensed Wang Ling's aura.</p>

    <p>He knew that Wang Ling would come.</p>

    <p>"Your friend?" Immortal She Pi asked behind Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>"My classmate!"</p>

    <p>Fang Xing nodded solemnly. After careful thought, he then added, "The best classmate!"</p>

    <p>After their battle with words, father and son finally recognized their relationship. Fang Xing talked about his experiences after he was born, and Immortal She Pi was overwhelmed with mixed emotions as something clicked in his mind. Bai Youquan had tampered with Immortal She Pi's memories, but had never thought that the distorted and false memories could be untangled with the power of Immortal She Pi's bloodline.</p>

    <p>The snake scales and intrinsic spirit field which Fang Xing had inherited from Immortal She Pi contained Immortal She Pi's power to begin with, and it was this very power that helped Immortal She Pi straighten out his chaotic thoughts.</p>

    <p>"I'm relieved that you're doing well." Immortal She Pi's smile was identical to the one Fang Xing usually had on at school.</p>

    <p>Right after he said this, the door of the room they were locked in was split in half by Shen Wuyue's antler, which had turned into a dart.</p>

    <p>As the door was cut open, Fang Xing saw a young man with antlers, with blood spurting out of his head... one of the antlers had been broken off to use as a dart.</p>

    <p>"Student Fang Xing, I am Shen Wuyue, Sage Master of the demon world. I've come to rescue you under Ling Zhenren's command." Shen Wuyue saluted. He then crushed the antler he had pulled out into fine powder, and he mixed it with the deer blood spurting out of his head. Rolling it into a ball, he gave it to Fang Xing. "Student Fang, please eat this. This Great Deer Pill can activate all your blocked meridians and undo the seal on your spiritual energy."</p>

    <p>"Many thanks." Fang Xing knew of Shen Wuyue.</p>

    <p>Although he hadn't participated directly in the demon world issue, Fang Xing knew quite a fair bit from the messages in the chat group about Er Ha's trip to the demon world.</p>

    <p>The Great Deer Pill was a rare medicine made with Shen Wuyue's own deer antler and divine blood. Although the creation process seemed a little violent, it was indeed effective.</p>

    <p>After Fang Xing swallowed the pill and cycled the spiritual energy inside his body, the effects were immediately apparent.</p>

    <p>His blocked body meridians were completely unclogged.</p>

    <p>"Student Fang, I'll wait for you outside." Seeing that the Great Deer Pill had worked, Shen Wuyue relaxed slightly. He patted Fang Xing on the shoulder and left the room to give the father and son some time alone.</p>

    <p>"Dad..." Fang Xing gazed at Immortal She Pi, his expression emotional.</p>

    <p>Immortal She Pi hadn't moved from this spot; he had already made up his mind.</p>

    <p>"Go and do what you have to do."</p>

    <p>Immortal She Pi looked at Fang Xing. "I don't belong to that world anymore, son. For a long time, I was lost as I wondered what cultivation was, exactly. And it seems that you found the answer before I did.</p>

    <p>"A true cultivator doesn't just have formidable strength; a true cultivator also has a tenacious heart at all times.</p>

    <p>"Haha, it seems I'm being too serious." Immortal She Pi smiled. "Choose the path you think is right and keep going, son. You have a group of very good friends. You will always be my pride and joy..."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing hesitated. "Will I really find the answer one day?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, son."</p>

    <p>Immortal She Pi: "Sooner or later, you'll find it. The answer to cultivation, and my answer as well..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Shen Wuyue hadn't waited for more than a few minutes at the door before Fang Xing came out of the room.</p>

    <p>"You're not going to talk for a bit longer?" Shen Wuyue asked.</p>

    <p>"It's enough." Fang Xing nodded.</p>

    <p>He did his best to hold back the tears that were clouding his vision.</p>

    <p>"Let it out; it might make you feel better." Shen Wuyue comforted him as he led the way.</p>

    <p>In that moment, Fang Xing couldn't hold back his tears anymore.</p>

    <p>The mixed emotions and the longing he had carried in his heart for so many years instantly caused his tears to fall despite himself.</p>

    <p>"He's still a child after all..."</p>

    <p>Up ahead, Shen Wuyue sighed inwardly with relief.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Five minutes later, Shen Wuyue and Fang Xing appeared above the Altar of Fire.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei expressed his gratitude to Shen Wuyue repeatedly. "Many thanks, Brother Shen!"</p>

    <p>"My pleasure, Senior Immortal, it was nothing." Shen Wuyue saluted. "Everything is happening as Senior Immortal expected: President Bai's son Bai Youquan, the person who captured Student Fang, has already withdrawn. It seems they already had defensive measures in place earlier on, and they've disappeared without a trace."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Not only that, we've discovered that the munitions factories in the Palace of Mirrors have self-destructed."</p>

    <p>"We'll need to discuss what to do after this. Right now, it's more important to restore the order of the Palace of Mirrors." Shen Wuyue nodded.</p>

    <p>"Brother Shen is right. Then, it's now time for the joint execution." The Royal Scepter in hand, Lord Diulei looked at the guardian envoy of the Altar of Fire in front of him. Heavily suppressed by the Royal Scepter, the guardian envoy was in a kowtow position and didn't have the power to resist at all.</p>

    <p>"It's been hard on you, Brother Fang Xing."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei then walked over to Fang Xing's side and said with a wide smile on his face, "Welcome home, Brother Fang Xing."</p>
