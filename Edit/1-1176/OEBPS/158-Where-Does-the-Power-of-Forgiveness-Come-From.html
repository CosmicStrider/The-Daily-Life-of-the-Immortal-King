  <h1>Chapter 158 Where Does the Power of Forgiveness Come From? </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was incredibly difficult to create a meditation talisman. Apart from Guo Hao who had inadvertently completed one, everyone else's had ended up being failures. Of course, Wang Ling had been pretending, and had deliberately made a mistake in the last step of writing the sigils.</p>

    <p>Most of the talismans that were produced were failures, so there was no way he would make himself stand out here; that would be way too eye-catching.</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling's sigils were far more uniform than Teacher Pan's. But for him, this was all just for fun; the meditation talisman wasn't of much use to him. When it came to warnings about impending disaster, his eyelid warning system was far more straightforward.</p>

    <p>Generally speaking, this talismans lesson had been a fairly harmonious one, apart from the little disgusting episode with Guo Hao.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao had successfully completed the meditation talisman by accident, and even he himself didn't know why such a large roulingzhi had appeared...</p>

    <p>For one moment, the scene had been deathly awkward.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao could only smile apologetically to alleviate the tense atmosphere.</p>

    <p>However, Teacher Pan was, in the end, Teacher Pan. As the lead teacher at Number 60 High School and a teaching pioneer whom students were proud of, she had recognized the true meaning of this roulingzhi at one glance!</p>

    <p>She frowned as she abruptly remembered that Student Guo Hao was often absent-minded, both in his expression and thoughts... sometimes when she was on patrol, she would even see from the back window of the class this silly student slumped over his desk, asleep! This was clearly the result of using the roulingzhi too often!</p>

    <p>Even the meditation talisman had projected this kind of thing, which was enough to prove how lethal this roulingzhi was to teenagers... how could the flowers of the motherland indulge in this kind of strange thing?!</p>

    <p>No amount of awkward smiles or chitchat would be able to help this situation.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan directly called Guo Hao's parents to come in, with the intention of discussing the roulingzhi issue.</p>

    <p>This was really very embarrassing.</p>

    <p>After class was over, Guo Hao returned from Teacher Pan's office and slumped over his desk, feeling exceptionally weary.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he was howling in his heart: M y reputation, my whole life! It's ruined!</p>

    <p>Chen Chao couldn't help patting Guo Hao on the shoulder. "That, Brother Guo, we're all men, we understand... there's actually nothing to worry about! Our class is very united, no one will tell the other classes about it!"</p>

    <p>"At least it ended fine." Su Xiao comforted him to one side.</p>

    <p>Tears were already gathering in the corners of Guo Hao's eyes, and he simply wanted to cry. "What fine... my parents were called in!"</p>

    <p>Su Xiao: "When I delivered the homework to Teacher Pan just now, I heard the teachers in the office discussing your dad..."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "My dad?"</p>

    <p>Su Xiao: "They were discussing whether or not your dad is a botanist."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was coming up to noon, and the atmosphere in the classroom was a little heavy, which made the two fellows from another school, He Bufeng and Tang Jingze, feel very awkward. They completely didn't understand what was going on.</p>

    <p>After careful inquiry, they found out that Mother Juan was going to deliver lunch today!</p>

    <p>Every time everyone thought about her black-style love bento, they shuddered despite themselves.</p>

    <p>"Doesn't Mother Juan only make bentos on Friday? Why today..." asked Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>"Mother Juan heard that there were two students from Number 59 High School today, so she decided to make the bentos earlier, and she'll bring them here in a little while..." Su Xiao answered weakly.</p>

    <p>Hearing this, He Bufeng and Tang Jingze felt a bit moved in their hearts...</p>

    <p>They had long heard that Number 60 High School was hospitable. Sure enough, the kitchen auntie was too considerate! Not only had she specially made the bentos, she was also delivering them to the classroom herself!</p>

    <p>In contrast, their Number 59 High School's attitude toward Number 60 High School back then had been simply terrible!</p>

    <p>He Bufeng and Tang Jingze felt deeply ashamed in their hearts.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>These two people clearly weren't aware of how serious the problem was!</p>

    <p>Even Wang Ling couldn't deny that in Number 60 High School, Mother Juan was a unique lady in the world of kitchen aunties.</p>

    <p>For some reason, he felt that her identity wasn't simple. Furthermore, she had disciples practically everywhere; he had already seen the shadow of Mother Juan's cuisine in too many places, the most famous of which was the heavenly silkworm potato strips. Most people now also had the impression that this was her specialty — this was probably her highest rated dish after she had said goodbye to communal meals and turned to specialist study in new cuisine.</p>

    <p>Last time, in a campus star interview in the school magazine, there had been a segment at the end where she had generously shared her insight in making heavenly silkworm potato strips; that was, don't fry the potatoes all the way through in one go! Halfway through frying them, transfer the potatoes into another pan; this would change their taste!</p>

    <p>It was nearly twelve o'clock when the silence in Grade One, Class Three was broken at this moment by the sound of a trolley, its wheels squealing over the floor.</p>

    <p>Mother Juan had come...</p>

    <p>She pushed open the classroom door, still wearing a light yellow apron, still wearing a snow-white chef's uniform, and no other accessories on her plump figure. When she smiled, there were faint wrinkles at the corners of her eyes. "I've made everyone wait, it's time to eat!"</p>

    <p>Saying this, light flowed from her hand in every direction, and the delicately wrapped lunchboxes on the trolley were instantly dispersed to settle in each student's hands.</p>

    <p>With an assertive air, she put her hands on her hips. "Today's bentos were specially made to welcome the two students from Number 59 High School. The menu is also different!" She knew that the relationship between the students from Number 60 High School and Number 59 High School was actually quite tense, so for this afternoon's love bentos, she had painstakingly racked her brains over them. At last, she had been struck by inspiration!</p>

    <p>Except for Tang Jingze and He Bufeng, the rest of Grade One, Class Three sucked in cold breaths... damn it! Even the regular heavenly silkworm potato strips in the love bentos had been changed! They were really going to die this time!</p>

    <p>Everyone took deep breaths and opened the lunchboxes...</p>

    <p>The first thing they saw was fried green peppers with mushrooms that were still giving off steam. However, the mushrooms were a bit strange in shape, and looked a little like miniature horses. Chen Chao ate a mouthful, and the taste of mushroom exploded on his tongue. He couldn't help asking, "Mother Juan, what's this..."</p>

    <p>Mother Juan quickly answered, "This is a particular mushroom that's very nutritious! Its elk velvet antlers! And see this jellyfish salad?"</p>

    <p>"Yes..." Chen Chao nodded.</p>

    <p>Mother Juan slowly explained, "It's called the pine jellyfish, and lives on the sea pine! I went to the Frozen Sea and directly jumped into the water to catch it, so it's very fresh! If you eat this with the elk velvet antlers, it will give you the power of forgiveness! I hope that everyone can live more harmonious and pleasant lives after eating these two dishes!"</p>

    <p>Su Xiao: "Then this soup..."</p>

    <p>Mother Juan: "Mm, this is white lily soup, simply called Bai Baihe <sup>1</sup> soup."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(白百合 just literally translates
to 'white lily .. ')</dfn>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>
