  <h1>Chapter 722 Gag Authority Technique!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After some consideration, Zhou Youzheng and Li Mingyao instantly felt that their plan was so clever that it was already godlike. Even if Number 60 High was tight-lipped, could that Classmate Wang Ling really continue to be indifferent to them, two young masters from the big families?</p>

    <p>When all was said and done, to Zhou Youzheng's and Li Mingyao's minds, most Foundation Establishment cultivators didn't have a broad worldview. The reason why they were confident in this aspect was because after the incident with President Bai, they had secretly sent people to gather some information on Wang Ling, which showed that he had received a government subsidy before.</p>

    <p>Although they didn't know exactly what this subsidy was, the fact that this Classmate Wang Ling had accepted it was a clear sign that his family situation definitely wasn't great!</p>

    <p>Zhou Youzheng and Li Mingyao both felt that they were offering Wang Ling a chance to touch the upper levels of society. They just needed to continue with their sugar-coated offensive - it didn't make sense that they wouldn't be able to convince him!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling already couldn't be bothered to look at the chat group, which was now full of messages asking about him. All along, he had never been used to a lot of contact with people he wasn't familiar with.</p>

    <p>Back then, Zhuo Yi had gone to a crazy lot of trouble to find him.</p>

    <p>But the reason why Wang Ling had finally acknowledged Zhuo Yi and accepted him as a disciple wasn't just because of the crispy noodle snacks membership card that Zhuo Yi had given to him when the latter had paid him a visit... Actually, what Wang Ling had paid more attention to was how their fates were linked.</p>

    <p>Their fates had already started to become inexplicably entwined when the Gate Between Worlds descended six years ago and Zhuo Yi had become Wang Ling's scapegoat for the first time.</p>

    <p>So for Wang Ling, Zhuo Yi was someone who was already part of his fate and wasn't a passerby.</p>

    <p>Of course, Wang Ling had always thought since young that he himself wasn't anything special, and that he was just an ordinary kid who couldn't quite control his powers.</p>

    <p>He liked to eat snacks, watch cartoons, and follow and discuss hot news in society. Of course, he loved the "sugar-coated bullets" which Zhou Youzheng and Li Mingyao had mentioned, but these things should be obtained in an upright manner.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling really didn't dare take something for nothing...</p>

    <p>The Heavenly Dao's principle of equivalent exchange had taken root deep in Wang Ling's mind from a very young age. There was no such thing as a free lunch; in giving and taking, all food had its own price.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling didn't care at all about the thing with Zhou Youzheng and Li Mingyao.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Wang Ming was delighted. That Li Mingyao was a typical rich second generation son, crazily firing sugar-coated bullets in the canteen earlier. At first, Wang Ming had wondered whether he should mess around with this person, but now things were getting even more interesting... Now there were two of them! Even Zhou Youzheng, the third young master of the Zhou family, had become involved. This was simply double the fun!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>With less than half an hour to go before the Rainbow Glass Box arrived at their destination, Li Mingyao and Zhou Youzheng started to stir things up in the chat group.</p>

    <p>As if he was telling the whole world, Li Mingyao directly announced in the group, "Ah, dear friends of Number 60 High, it's fine even if you don't tell us. Zhou Youzheng and I have already found Classmate Wang Ling, and have already asked him to be our big brother. If you don't believe me, you can ask him later."</p>

    <p>Most of the people in the group were stunned at these words. It didn't sound like a joke -</p>

    <p>if it was, shouldn't there at least be a funny emoji at the end of this statement?</p>

    <p>Moreover, this was the main group, which also had the teachers from various schools!</p>

    <p>Who were Li Mingyao and Zhou Youzheng? They were the young masters of the Li family and the Zhou family, two of the four big families of Songhai city. The teachers would usually give them some face in school; even when criticizing them, the teachers didn't dare use too severe a tone. These two had now actually announced that they had become that Classmate Wang Ling's underlings...</p>

    <p>It wasn't just the teachers and students from other schools, but even the students and teachers from Number 60 High in the group were all blank.</p>

    <p>Because given Wang Ling's personality, the first reaction that a lot of the people from Number 60 High had was that Wang Ling wasn't this type of person. He was average in his studies and he wasn't very talkative. If it hadn't been for that incident with President Bai, a lot of them probably wouldn't have remembered Wang Ling... In short, in the eyes of many from Number 60 High, Wang Ling was a bit of a "lone ranger."</p>

    <p>It was only his classmates like Chen Chao and Guo Hao who didn't think so.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling indeed usually didn't like to say much, and was aloof with outsiders because he wasn't familiar with them. However, he had studied together with this bunch from Grade One, Class Three for almost half a year.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Chen Chao, Guo Hao and everyone else in Grade One, Class Three had once animatedly discussed Wang Ling's real character when he hadn't been in the classroom.</p>

    <p>Finally, they had summed it up in one word: "mensao"...</p>

    <p>Having said that, it indeed wasn't in-character for Wang Ling to accept underlings.</p>

    <p>Hence, people from Number 60 High started to question how true this was.</p>

    <p>"Really? Why don't I believe it?" Guo Hao, Wang Ling's deskmate, was the very first person to question it.</p>

    <p>Actually, while it was uncertain whether the same could be said of the other people from Number 60 High, absolutely no one in Grade One, Class Three would give away information on Wang Ling so easily to people from other schools, even without the Great Shielding Spell in effect.</p>

    <p>As the saying went, "a friend in need is a friend indeed." When they had previously heard that something terrible had happened to Wang Ling, everyone in Grade One, Class Three had been grieved for a long time.</p>

    <p>The most crucial point, moreover, was that the students and parents who had been coming to Number 60 High recently to absorb fortune by paying homage to "Wang Ling" actually disgusted the whole school.</p>

    <p>"Are these Li Mingyao and Zhou Youzheng fishing?" Chen Chao wondered in his room.</p>

    <p>He and Guo Hao were in the same room.</p>

    <p>Actually, anyone who used their brains just a little would be able to guess what these two rich young masters were up to, but even then there were some people who still fell into the trap.</p>

    <p>Because of Li Mingyao and Zhou Youzheng's words, momentum in the group immediately picked up, and some even asked for Wang Ling's room number...</p>

    <p>"This is a good opportunity." Li Mingyao's face lit up when he saw the flood of messages in the group.</p>

    <p>"As soon as someone asks that Classmate Wang Ling later, we'll know who he is," Zhou Youzheng said with a smile.</p>

    <p>In the end, no sooner had the two of them finished speaking when a system notification promptly popped up in the chat group.</p>

    <p>System message: User "Li Mingyao" is banned for 6 hours.</p>

    <p>System message: User "Zhou Youzheng" is banned for 6 hours.</p>

    <p>Li Mingyao and Zhou Youzheng: "???"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming had activated his skill â€” Gag Authority Technique!</p>

    <p>It was Wang Ming who had originally designed this internal chat software, so he had the highest level of authority. It took only a matter of minutes to ban two people.</p>

    <p>"Done."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming dusted his hands.</p>

    <p>Dare to bully Wang Ling?</p>

    <p>These two guys had a lot of nerve...</p>

    <p>So what if they were from the four big families of Songhai city? If it wasn't for the fact that the Wang family heir was obsessed with crispy noodle snacks, these four big families would be nothing!</p>
