  <h1>Chapter 1028 Xiao Yin Helps Crack a Case</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Since the advent of an era of national cultivation, order in the cultivation world no longer depended completely on strength, where the strong were revered and held power. In this era, realm didn't mean anything. Strong cultivators who acted immorally or against the law would also be severely punished.</p>

    <p>Peace.</p>

    <p>This was what all cultivators on Earth worked toward, but there were also those who liked to act recklessly and break the law. The cultivation police was thus a necessary existence.</p>

    <p>Apart from specially deploying civil police, the cultivation police had a large cultivator patrol team under their banner — the Immortal Arts Mobile Squadron.</p>

    <p>This was the most basic-level position in the cultivation police, and a huge number of police officers comprised this group. Every day, they diligently patrolled the areas assigned to them on their flying swords in order to protect the city. The moment they received an alert, they could promptly dispatch people to check out the situation.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi had in fact been a member of the Immortal Arts Mobile Squadron before.</p>

    <p>In order to enter a government department, most cultivators had to start with the Immortal Arts Mobile Squadron. It was just that Zhuo Yi had lucked out; he had just passed the cultivation police assessment after graduating from university, and not long after obtaining an internship with the Immortal Arts Mobile Squadron... the Gate Between Worlds descended.</p>

    <p>And then... there was no "and then."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi became a hero of the times.</p>

    <p>As for Officer Gao Tian, he wasn't as lucky as Zhuo Yi. However, his luck seemed to have changed; he had always felt that meeting Mr Xiao Yin was his misfortune, but in some sense, he had to admit that after encountering this Mr Xiao Yin, his career seemed to be progressing a lot more smoothly.</p>

    <p>It took him five years to be promoted from the Immortal Arts Mobile Squadron to a second rank officer in the cultivation police. He didn't have to go out every day, and instead was responsible for handling easy call-ins from residents in the vicinity. After another five years, he then became a frontline police officer, and was responsible for dealing with online public sentiment at the main office.</p>

    <p>In short, he was in charge of running all the official media accounts of the local police station and screening eye-catching rumors on WeMedia. Occasionally, he needed to ask his female colleague to help take selfies of herself to prove that the person running the official accounts was a lovely little sister police officer and not a rough fellow sitting guard in front of the computer with a bowl of instant noodles in his hands.</p>

    <p>Of course, there were times when his colleagues from other departments were busy, and Gao Tian had to go help out with work like interrogation. For example, the last few times Xiao Yin was interrogated, it was Officer Gao who had offered to help out, which was how he had run into Xiao Yin.</p>

    <p>His work day after day was dry and dull, but as an outstanding first rank cultivation police officer, Officer Gao was quite content. A first rank police officer could be promoted to a first rank police superintendent and get their own office. Gao Tian initially thought that it would take him another five or even ten years to reach that level.</p>

    <p>Who would have thought that in the end, after arresting Xiao Yin twice, his leader would suddenly call him up one day and promote him.</p>

    <p>When Officer Gao received the call, he was excited.</p>

    <p>The senior officer on the other end told him that because of a change in personnel, there happened to be a vacant position for a police superintendent in another district. After careful screening, they determined that he had the best merits and overall performance, and thus promoted him.</p>

    <p>Gao Tian didn't know whether this had anything to do with Xiao Yin.</p>

    <p>But there indeed was a belief that silver-horned beasts could bring luck to the people around them.</p>

    <p>The luck was like a widespread WIFI signal that could be absorbed by others. And so, after other people absorbed Xiao Yin's luck, he himself became very unlucky...</p>

    <p>This was also why, whenever Xiao Yin went out, he would wind up in the police station. There were too many people around him, sucking away his luck! Conversely, he wouldn't run into any sort of problem if he was a shut-in who was holed up at home.</p>

    <p>In the end, Gao Tian still ordered twenty lunchboxes from the canteen for Xiao Yin on his meal card. Actually, what Xiao Yin said was indeed true — they had caught the wrong person, so they needed to compensate him... What was more, after this Brother Xiao Yin was inspected, his feet indeed didn't smell.</p>

    <p>When he bought the meals, Gao Tian took Xiao Yin to a pond next to the police station to verify it.</p>

    <p>If his feet really stank, the fish in the pond would absolutely flip over belly up. In the end, some of the lotuses in the pond even bloomed, to say nothing of dead fish, and the crowd of police personnel was stupefied.</p>

    <p>"After you're done eating, hurry up and leave." Gao Tian's mood was sour as he put the lunchboxes in front of Xiao Yin with a defeated air. He knew that with Xiao Yin's appetite, a mere twenty portions was far from enough.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin didn't stand on ceremony as he hadn't had breakfast before going out; an appetizer before hurrying over to Master's place wasn't bad. The food at the police station was always good; even if Xiao Yin had eaten it before, he found it delicious since it was free.</p>

    <p>Although Xiao Yin knew it was a bit shameless to say so, but was there anything better than free food?</p>

    <p>As he ate, Xiao Yin gazed at the worried frown on Gao Tian's face.</p>

    <p>The truth was that Gao Tian currently had two cases to deal with.</p>

    <p>The first was the wide-scale clash between the killers and the mysterious force that had happened within Officer Gao's jurisdiction yesterday. Just as he was about to report it to his superiors, Xiao Yin had shown up. It was only now that Officer Gao finally sent the report as an official internal email.</p>

    <p>But they didn't have to rush with this first case. Not only didn't Officer Gao have any clues, he still had to wait for instructions from his superiors.</p>

    <p>It was actually the second case that was a real headache for Gao Tian.</p>

    <p>This was a serial murder case that had happened within his jurisdiction. Currently, all the residents of an entire apartment building were suspects, but the fact was that Officer Gao was unable to find any substantial evidence.</p>

    <p>The mastermind behind the serial murders was very crafty; their arrangements were meticulous and their plots well thought out. There weren't even signs that magic had been used to wipe down the scene, which was ample proof that the mastermind hadn't left the slightest bit of evidence behind from the very first murder, and hence didn't need to use magic to clean up the crime scene.</p>

    <p>"What kind of case is it?" Xiao Yin chewed on a braised pork meatball, eyes fixed on Gao Tian.</p>

    <p>Gao Tian: "Mr Xiao Yin, this is an internal police matter."</p>

    <p>"I know, but that doesn't mean you can't look for outside help," Xiao Yin said as he ate. "Don't look down on me; I'm actually also a team leader of the Office of Strategic Deception. Maybe I can help you."</p>

    <p>"The Office of Strategic Deception?"</p>

    <p>Gao Tian was blank for a moment before he immediately stood up in shock.</p>

    <p>He was sure he hadn't heard wrong.</p>

    <p>That was the super sect that had been set up in the shortest amount of time in the cultivation world, and the fastest to jump up to the top as the number one light force.</p>

    <p>Gao Tian never expected Xiao Yin to actually be one of them, and part of the cadre to boot.</p>

    <p>Pondering it carefully, he then had a terrifying thought.</p>

    <p>He remembered that the last two times Xiao Yin had been taken to the police station, the person who had helped bail him out... it seemed to be the Chief of the Office of Strategic Deception, Lord Diulei?</p>
