  <h1>Chapter 361 Gorgeous Itinerant's Great Weapon </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Elsewhere, Wang Ming's operation had proceeded very smoothly; after hurrying to the hospital, he had immediately gathered all the kids together and sealed their spirit with the Heavenly Materials sword.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi had put up a curtain screen and had gotten Wang Ming to treat the kids behind it. After all, sealing their spirit involved cutting each of them with the Heavenly Materials sword, and if they did it blatantly and openly, neither the students nor their parents would be able to accept it.</p>

    <p>As reality proved, Wang Ling and Lord Diulei's theory had been spot on.</p>

    <p>The Heavenly Materials sword did have a miraculous effect on unusually concentrated spirit power!</p>

    <p>After Wang Ming sealed the students' spirits, the hospital re-examined the concentration of spirit power inside the students' bodies, and found that they were gradually coming down to the normal levels expected of the Foundation Establishment stage.</p>

    <p>But given the seal on their spirits, this bunch of kids wouldn't be able to use their spirit energy for the next three to five days.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin stood behind Wang Ming with a deep frown on her face. "You're pushing yourself too hard."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming shrugged nonchalantly. "It's not a big deal - I'm not using my own spirit energy anyway to control the spirit sword."</p>

    <p>But while this was true, he did indeed feel a little tired. He was the hero tonight, but he seemed to have forgotten that he was still an ordinary man. Furthermore, in the confrontation with Shuigou Sect's Chou Shisi earlier, he had indeed used up quite some strength with the Brain Deduction Technique.</p>

    <p>"This should be the last student, right?" Behind the curtain, Wang Ming yawned as he looked at Zhuo Yi and asked.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi nodded and pressed the call button. The student was ready and waiting outside, and he directly stretched his hand in through an opening.</p>

    <p>Holding the Heavenly Materials sword with both hands, Wang Ming stood up and aimed the sword tip at a spot on the student's arm.</p>

    <p>But just then, he started to feel dizzy, and the student's arm seemed to split up in front of his eyes, turning into countless shadows.</p>

    <p>Then.</p>

    <p>" <em>Clang </em>!" The Heavenly Materials sword dropped from Wang Ming's hands onto the floor with a loud noise.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin heaved a sigh. Before Wang Ming could fall down, she supported him with a steady hand, then directly picked him up in a princess carry.</p>

    <p>The atmosphere immediately turned silent. Zhuo Yi's eyes widened at this scene.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin stared at him. "You deal with the last kid. I'm going to have him take a rest; we'll come back for the sword later."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Al...alright..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the rooftop, the two fellow brothers were still discussing what had happened in the past.</p>

    <p>With the passing of so many years, their moods and states of mind were actually a lot more stable than they used to be, so today was a rare opportunity.</p>

    <p>Using this opportunity, they could talk out various misunderstandings; this was probably the most peaceful way of resolving things.</p>

    <p>They sat crossed-legged in front of each other. Holding the photo of Black Gauze in his hand, Lao Gudong couldn't help sighing gloomily. "I'm sorry, Black Gauze... you were only six years old, but I did that to you..."</p>

    <p>Watching from the shadows, Wang Ling wanted to flip a table - what freaking six-year-old child!</p>

    <p>Taoist Taotie felt a twinge of sadness, and he directed a piercing stare at Lao Gudong from under the face mask. "I still want to know, what were you thinking at the time..."</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong answered, "Junior brother, you should know that your senior brother is typically worried about health. When I saw Black Gauze back then, I could tell at one glance that it was a spiritually enlightened baby tortoise you'd only ever come across once in a hundred years. In Chrysanthemum House, this type of rare quality tortoise would cost at least two thousand immortal gold bars when turned into a dish... it is in fact a food supplement that usually isn't treated as a pet."</p>

    <p>Taoist Taotie's face under the mask suddenly turned black as the corners of his mouth twitched. "So...that's why you turned him into tortoise jelly <sup>1</sup> ?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>('Guilinggao' literally translates to 'tortoise jelly' and is a jelly-like Chinese medicine that is also eaten as a dessert ..)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Thinking about Killer Taoist's previous story about keeping a dog and eating it, Wang Ling now finally understood where he had learned this from... as expected, like master, like disciple!</p>

    <p>Taoist Taotie looked very sorrowful under the face mask. "Everything happened so suddenly. In the time it took me to go get my hair done, senior brother turned Black Gauze into tortoise jelly!"</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong lowered his head with regret. "I was wrong, I was really wrong."</p>

    <p>Taoist Taotie gritted his teeth firmly. "Later, you must come with me to burn incense at his grave!"</p>

    <p>After a short silence, Lao Gudong finally nodded. "Very well."</p>

    <p>Taoist Taotie breathed a sigh of relief. "Don't worry about those kids downstairs. I've already sent people to deliver the antidote to each household. After this is all over, I'll disband Shuigou Sect... we can consider this incident a lesson for those kids. We might be where we are now because we picked up Ghost Ax Sect's original techniques manual, but we still had to walk the cultivation path step by step."</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong: "Hm, junior brother is correct."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was stupefied when he heard the whole story. There were too many things about it to ridicule, and he didn't know where to start!</p>

    <p>This was even more absurd than the old devil invading the National Palace for the wheel of time in order to find his girlfriend's reincarnation.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had seldom seen Lao Gudong as docile as this.</p>

    <p>The good news was that they had solved their conflict in a relatively peaceful way; Wang Ling felt it would have been really troublesome if they had fought for real.</p>

    <p>It already wasn't easy for them to sit down and talk things out peacefully after they had parted ways for hundreds of years. This proved that they hadn't completely given up on each other - was there any other better ending than being able to bury the hatchet?</p>

    <p>Standing inside the boundary, Wang Ling felt satisfied when he saw this scene.</p>

    <p>Earlier, Zhuo Yi had sent him a message to say that the matter with the kids in the hospital had been resolved, and that the unusual spirit power generated by the fruit had been perfectly sealed with the Heavenly Materials sword.</p>

    <p>This incident had come to a perfect end.</p>

    <p>And so, Wang Ling raised his hand to undo the boundary, and was prepared to leave.</p>

    <p>But right at that moment, something seemed to strike Taoist Taotie as he abruptly looked at Lao Gudong. "Senior brother, there was something else... the intelligence division of the organization which provided me with this information said that you had some supreme weapon on you?"</p>

    <p>At this, Wang Ling paused - his gossipy heart was aroused once again!</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong couldn't help laughing at this question. "Who told you that?"</p>

    <p>Taoist Taotie. "Is the information false?"</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong shook his head. "No... indeed, I did have one before, but now, it no longer exists."</p>

    <p>Taoist Taotie asked, "What do you mean?"</p>

    <p>Without saying a word, Lao Gudong popped one of those potent appearance-molding pills which he had found online into his mouth.</p>

    <p>It immediately took effect after he swallowed it... in a flash of spirit light, Wang Ling saw Lao Gudong's entire body transform from head to toe.</p>

    <p>Realization immediately dawned on Taoist Taotie.</p>

    <p>Gorgeous Itinerant's great weapon was actually this!</p>

    <p>This was also Wang Ling's first time seeing Lao Gudong in the form of Gorgeous Itinerant... He didn't know how to describe Lao Gudong's current appearance.</p>

    <p>He touched his nose, and realized that it was actually bleeding.</p>

    <p>Hm...</p>

    <p>This was indeed a lethal "weapon."</p>
