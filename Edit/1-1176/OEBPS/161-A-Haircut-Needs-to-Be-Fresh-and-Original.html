  <h1>Chapter 161 A Haircut Needs to Be Fresh and Original </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Er Ha had no intention of killing these two people, but they had broken into the Wang family's villa and were plotting something sinister... if Little Master Ling knew about this, he definitely wouldn't be happy. Er Ha had little interest in the two men's souls, but it also didn't want them to leave alive, so it was best to let the pen and eraser gremlins deal with them.</p>

    <p>The two men were now completely immobilized, and had no idea what the two brawny brothers were going to do with them. They were scared to the point of pissing their pants, but unfortunately, the Aura-Freezing Spell was so strong that even their genitals were frozen...</p>

    <p>Immobile, their bodies still couldn't help trembling.</p>

    <p>Pen: "Want to kill them?"</p>

    <p>Eraser: "Forget it, if we get blood everywhere in the bedroom, Little Master will definitely not be happy."</p>

    <p>If that was the case, there was only one option...</p>

    <p>The two muscular brothers looked at the attached washroom in Wang Ling's bedroom, then escorted the two men there.</p>

    <p>Pen: "Lucky for you, our Little Master likes things neat and tidy, so we won't make you bleed today..."</p>

    <p>The two Mo Immortal Castle cultivators were scared witless. "What are you going to do?"</p>

    <p>Hehe, what to do?</p>

    <p>Goblin eraser cracked its knuckles, then lifted the toilet lid and grabbed the foot of one of the men. It then directly stuffed his entire body into the toilet bowl and quickly flushed. This man was directly sucked down to the sound of running water and disappeared.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had spelled this toilet so that it led to some alien space, no one knew exactly where. But theoretically speaking, once these two men were flushed down the toilet, they would essentially disappear from the world.</p>

    <p>The other Mo Immortal Castle cultivator broke out in a sweat. "You..."</p>

    <p>Goblin eraser put one leg up on the toilet seat and pointed arrogantly at it. "Are you going to go in yourself, or shall I throw you in?"</p>

    <p>Mo Immortal Castle cultivator: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>There were actually quite a lot of things happening on Thursday. When Wang Ling came to class in the morning, Su Xiao was distributing a school notice with a deeply bitter face.</p>

    <p>"What's this?" Guo Hao gave the notice, printed on the school's official yellowish-gray stationery, a look.</p>

    <p>The notice was about the military training in the middle of the month. It listed the items required for the training as well as points for attention. All the students went through the notice line by line, and soon all the boys in class burst out in cries of distress.</p>

    <p>"Fuck! We need to shave our heads for the military training?" Chen Chao was completely unwilling; it hadn't been easy for him to grow his bangs, and it would be a real shame to shave it all off in one go! Also... why did the girls get special treatment?!</p>

    <p>Chen Chao felt that this was serious gender discrimination!</p>

    <p>Guo Hao said in a cold, resentful voice, "Everyone, calm down... and don't talk about gender discrimination. Let me ask you, are bangs or teapots <sup>1</sup> more important?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>("Teapot' is yet another word
used in China as a euphemism
for the penis.)</dfn>

    <p>All the boys thought for a moment, then said nothing...</p>

    <p>Seeing that things had quieted down, Guo Hao nodded in satisfaction. "That's right... actually, a buzz cut is also very good, since it's summer in Songhai city and it's hot. It'll feel cool after you shave! Back in the old days, I also had bangs, but after thinking about it carefully, I realized that it didn't matter. After all, my humble self relies on talent alone to weather the storms of life!"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, all the guys in class for some reason suddenly thought of a quote: He was once a king. Later, he said 'Forget it' <sup>2</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is a lyric from a 'rap' song
by popular live-streamer MC
Tianyou.)</dfn>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling felt that Guo Hao's skin was already too thick to be fixed.</p>

    <p>Getting a haircut wasn't anything strange for Wang Ling; coincidentally, he had had bangs before. Furthermore, he could direct the spirit energy to his scalp to rapidly stimulate hair growth.</p>

    <p>This technique focused on a steady control of spirit energy and inwardly directing it to a precise position; actually, any Golden Core cultivator could do this. However, after Wang Ling had used this technique, his hair had started to grow at a much faster rate compared with ordinary people.</p>

    <p>There had been a time when he had been obsessed with trying out different hairstyles before he finally came to a realization.</p>

    <p>Actually, it wasn't the hairstyle that was the main point; it was how good-looking you were that was the key...</p>

    <p>So to this day, Wang Ling had simply maintained a crew cut.</p>

    <p>He looked at the notice and ran a hand over his hair.</p>

    <p>Well... it did seem a little long.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After school, Wang Ling went to a small, inexpensive hairdresser's. While small, its ambiance and facilities were still pretty good; furthermore, it had a special price for students.</p>

    <p>Of course, there were many other larger hairdressers' around it, but their haircut prices were too expensive, and Wang Ling couldn't afford them on his monthly allowance... it was just a buzz cut, wouldn't it be the same if he went anywhere?</p>

    <p>With that in mind, he entered "Alice" hairdresser's.</p>

    <p>Upon entering the shop, he heard the whirr of a hairdryer.</p>

    <p>The boss was a middle-aged man with slicked-back hair, though he was experiencing some Mediterranean hair loss <sup>3</sup> . His face was slightly chubby, and he wore a small pair of steel-rimmed glasses. When he saw Wang Ling, he was immediately all smiles. "Is there a particular hairdresser you're looking for, handsome?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(This refers to a receding hair line..)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling was silent for a bit, then shook his head.</p>

    <p>The boss's eyes lit up as he immediately saw an opportunity. "Handsome, we have top-class hairdressers at the thirty-yuan level, hairdressing directors at the sixty-yuan level, and chief hairdressers at the one hundred and fifty-yuan level... if you get a card with us and top it up with five hundred yuan in our shop, you can enjoy the services of our chief hairdressers at ninety percent off, so for just fifteen yuan!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling shook his head again. He looked around, and finally his eyes fell on a young man.</p>

    <p>The young man was assisting a hairdresser with a yellow quiff as they stood around an auntie having her hair permed.</p>

    <p>"...Who's that?" Wang Ling's voice rang out in the boss's mind, startling the latter.</p>

    <p>But the boss regained his composure quickly.</p>

    <p>His shop saw a lot more ordinary people than cultivators; even Foundation Establishment high school studens would choose the larger, neighboring hairdressers', so Wang Ling's appearance had been a bit of a surprise to him.</p>

    <p>Cultivators were supposed to be rich! They thought nothing of material wealth, and spent money like water... they could even spend several million yuan on phone charges! Had he happened to stumble onto an easy mark?</p>

    <p>The boss rejoiced In his heart, and quickly explained, "This little brother is a new apprentice in our store, but no customer has ever dared to let him cut their hair; for the moment, he's just practising on wigs. But if you sign up for a card, I'll have this apprentice's shifu , Master Kevin, cut your hair! He's the top hairdresser in our shop!"</p>

    <p>Do I need to pay?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised an eyebrow as he asked his question telepathically.</p>

    <p>"Handsome, as long as you have a card, it'll only cost fifteen yuan for Master Kevin to do your hair."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling shook his head and looked at the young man as he spoke telepathically again. "I meant him..."</p>

    <p>The boss was stupefied, feeling that the situation had somehow taken a little turn for the worse. "Uh, he's an apprentice... so no charge."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded and then pointed to the young man â€” Then I choose him!</p>

    <p>Boss: "..."</p>
