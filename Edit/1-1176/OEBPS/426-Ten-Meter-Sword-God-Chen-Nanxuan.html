  <h1>Chapter 426 Ten-Meter Sword God Chen Nanxuan </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Chen Nanxuan's name really sounded too strange. People virtually called each other by their Taoist names in the current cultivation circle, thus overlooking real names. Chen Nanxuan was a typical example... Lord Diulei didn't recognize this name, but when it came to the titles "Ten-Meter Sword God" and "Evil Sword God," he understood instantly.</p>

    <p>It was actually him?</p>

    <p>In front of the screen, Lord Diulei had a stunned expression on his face.</p>

    <p>This was because Evil Sword God was a more terrifying figure than the old devil in history. Any incident related to him horrified the people who heard it; it was just that he hadn't created the same kind of violent waves that the old devil had.</p>

    <p>When the old devil had led the Gua Pi Army in an invasion of the National Palace back then, media exaggeration had turned it into a large terrorist attack, and thanks to modern cultivation technology, the entire country had access to these media reports. As for "Evil Sword God" this title, no one in the modern era had much of an impression of it.</p>

    <p>During Evil Sword God's time, the development of spirit energy information had only just began, so things actually hadn't been perfect, and relying purely on the power of paper media to disseminate news had clearly been far from enough.</p>

    <p>Even when Lord Diulei had first come across information on Evil Sword God, it had been when he was flipping through the old newspapers archive in Songhai Cultivation Library. At that time, he had been investigating other incidents and had just happened to read an old newspaper article on Evil Sword God.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei clearly remembered that the newspaper had published a description of three of Evil Sword God's crimes at the time.</p>

    <p>First, the hostage case.</p>

    <p>When the first incident happened, Evil Sword God had still been on the side of "justice," but the media had explicitly added quotation marks to "justice." This was because it was Evil Sword God's own brand of "justice," and the hostage case that shocked the cultivation circle at the time amply demonstrated this.</p>

    <p>At that time, Huaxiu nation had just been founded, and comprehensive domestic security measures had yet to be fully established. There still were some cultivators who broke the law. Back then, a group of people had robbed a bank and taken all the people in the bank hostage. Sword in hand, Evil Sword God had charged in alone, killing all the robbers... as well as wiping out all the hostages involved.</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God believed that the timid weren't qualified to live...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Second, the murder of his <em>shifu </em>.</p>

    <p>This report had baffled Lord Diulei because back then, there hadn't been any details on it in the newspaper and it had occupied the least amount of space.</p>

    <p>However, combined with the clues provided by Taoist Guang, Lord Diulei suddenly understood... Because the person Evil Sword God had murdered wasn't just his <em>shifu </em>, but also General Yi's <em>shifu </em>. News like this which involved the distinguished military founders of the nation would certainly be restricted!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei hadn't understood it at that time, but after connecting the dots, it was completely clear to him!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>And third, the case of revenge...</p>

    <p>After the first two major events, Evil Sword God's reputation in the cultivation circle plummeted. Under the rule of law, modern society became less and less accepting of the use of this type of method, which was almost tyranny. Enraged, Evil Sword God Chen Nanxuan was determined to take revenge... That night, he killed all the media personnel who had exposed his exploits, and then, in an atmosphere of national fear, vanished without a trace.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei gave an account of this history in the three-person chat group. It was, however, banned history; anything to do with Evil Sword God couldn't be found online at all: it was either a 404 error or not accessible. A lot of information and content had been blocked... When all was said and done, all these events had happened two or three thousand years ago when Huaxiu had just been founded.</p>

    <p>The most important thing, moreover, was that it involved General Yi, so naturally, no media outlets were gutsy enough to treat General Yi, one of the Ten Founding Generals, as entertainment news hype.</p>

    <p>Hearing about Evil Sword God again after a thousand years, Lord Diulei's heart was rocked for a long time as he was shaken to the core.</p>

    <p>"Is Evil Sword God still alive?" His heart trembled as he typed the words. As Great Death-Courting Senior in the cultivation circle, he already thought that he had nothing else to fear, whether it was power or threat. The reason why people in the cultivation circle looked up to him was because he wasn't afraid of power and had an outspoken character.</p>

    <p>However, speaking of Evil Sword God, Lord Diulei found that his body couldn't stop shivering... After inadvertently reading the news about Evil Sword God back then, he had been curious and had found video recordings of Evil Sword God's battles through minor channels. Even though these videos had been censored, they were to this day still vivid in Lord Diulei's mind.</p>

    <p>After the murder of his <em>shifu </em>, Evil Sword God was the first person to be classified as a wanted criminal by Huaxiu nation, and a Heavenly Way Hunt and Kill order was officially put out on him. Countless Soul Formation experts went after him, but they were all easily beheaded and their skulls sent to the National Palace.</p>

    <p>Any astute person would know that this was a provocative act of contempt, but in the face of absolute strength, the horror which Evil Sword God instilled in people was too overwhelming.</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang understood Lord Diulei's feelings very well. He was older than Lord Diulei and naturally understood the terror of that "dark era."</p>

    <p>He was from that era, and after those dark and terrible things happened, its widespread impact lasted for more than a hundred years... It wasn't until Wang Ling's era that this history, covered in dust, gradually faded from public view.</p>

    <p>Now with this old topic raised once more, even Taoist Guang's heart was still unsettled. "During the century after Evil Sword God Chen Nanxuan faded from public view, no one could find him, no matter how many cultivators Huaxiu dispatched in its search. But I came face-to-face with him in the Gate Between Worlds..."</p>

    <p>"In the end, what happened?" Lord Diulei was curious.</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang shook his head and sighed. "I ran into him at a space exit and fought him, but in the end I was defeated and fled..."</p>

    <p>"How could that be..." Lord Diulei found this hard to believe.</p>

    <p>"I attacked him fiercely with eighth-grade water spells, but he raised a protective barrier and blocked my attacks easily without moving an inch!"</p>

    <p>As he typed this sentence, Taoist Guang's heart trembled. "Furthermore, his sword isn't an ordinary one - it's the Heaven-Cleaving Sword which he seized from his <em>shifu </em>, Sword Immortal Fan Rui! This is the godly sword which tops the spirit sword power rankings today!"</p>

    <p>When he saw Taoist Guang's words on the screen, Wang Ling involuntarily looked at Jingke...</p>

    <p>But Taoist Guang wasn't finished. "What's more, when I was fighting him, I could already feel that this person had already grasped Sword Dao, one of the Three Thousand Great Spells... Although it wasn't complete at the time, its power was already so frightening!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was extremely astonished. "The Three Thousand Great Spells?!"</p>

    <p>"That's right... the Three Thousand Great Spells!" Taoist Guang said. "At True Immortal level, If you can master one spell, it's already enough to make you stand out in the world. If you can master two or even three spells... Most likely only a legendary existence like Immortal Zhenyuan can do it... There is absolutely no one in this world who can completely master the Three Thousand Great Spells!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
