  <h1>Chapter 170 Wasn't It Agreed That Animals Couldn't Be "Awakened"?! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>When Wang Ling manifested as Immortal Meow in front of the three cat tyrants, they stared wide-eyed at him with disbelieving expressions. The other cats in the apartment were also all stunned, as they had never seen Immortal Meow before and had only heard hearsay of him from the three cat leaders, Tang Shi, Song Ci and Yuan Qu.</p>

    <p>None of the cats had anticipated that Immortal Meow would appear at this very moment.</p>

    <p>The three cat tyrants were instantly so moved that they couldn't hold back their tears.</p>

    <p>Seeing Tang Shi, Song Ci and Yuan Qu once again, these three cats that he had personally groomed, Wang Ling also felt deeply moved in his heart. He had never thought that the three mongrels cats that he had found in a paper box back then would actually grow this big.</p>

    <p>They were all cats that had been abandoned by their owners; now, these unwanted kittens from back then had become the leaders of three cat armies, and had even purchased a high-class condo in the heart of Jinghua city to use as their command post... actually, the thought of it was truly astounding.</p>

    <p>It was already one o'clock in the afternoon, and based on conservative estimates, two hours had already passed after Zheng Tan had launched its assault. With the firefight centered around Zheng Tan, the nearby cat regiments were obstructing the enemy and supporting the attack... it was just Tang Shi's headquarters that had been left in the dark.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's appearance could thus be said to be very timely.</p>

    <p>He stretched out a cat claw to point at a particular point on the map.</p>

    <p>Seeing the position, Song Ci immediately connected the dots. "Aren't these the coordinates that we received recently, that was rumored to be where Shadow Stream's headquarters is located? The information hasn't been verified, right? Yet the fighting's already started... which troop is it?"</p>

    <p>After saying this, Song Ci and Yuan Qu both looked at Tang Shi in unison.</p>

    <p>Tang Shi: "What are you looking at me for..."</p>

    <p>Song Ci and Yuan Qu spoke in one voice. "Except for your family's Zheng Tan, no other cat has such guts!"</p>

    <p>Tang Shi: "..."</p>

    <p>Song Ci scratched its head, then turned to Wang Ling with paws clasped in a salute. "Thanks to Immortal Meow, at least we've found the flashpoint of the fighting."</p>

    <p>"Then what do we do now?" Yuan Qu cupped its chin.</p>

    <p>"What else can we do? The fight has already started... it's no use stopping Zheng Tan now. First, we should try and obstruct enemy reinforcements, then do our best to help Zheng Tan seize the headquarters." Song Ci sighed, feeling its head hurt as it answered.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't intend to linger in these headquarters of Tang Shi and the others, and instead wanted to go and take a look at the situation with Zheng Tan. And so, he gave Tang Shi a large pile of spirit talismans.</p>

    <p>These were light armor talismans with strong protective properties which Wang Ling had drawn at Little Black's lab. Wang Ling wanted Tang Shi and the others to quickly distribute these spirit talismans in all the battle zones.</p>

    <p>He had also reinforced the initial effectiveness of the light armor talismans with a discernment spell and a transmission spell. When the spirit talismans were in effective range, they would automatically discern all the cats present and then automatically create a protective connection. Actually, it worked in pretty much the same way as WIFI — oh, by the way, Wang Ling had plagiarized this creative concept from the WIFI pill that Immortal Toya was researching.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was already half past one in the afternoon. Shadow Stream's secret headquarters on the hilltop was still doing its best to try and block Zheng Tan's offensive. A total of about twenty Shadow Stream killers were using every type of defensive spell they had to build a defensive barrier around their headquarters.</p>

    <p>Before reinforcements arrived, the headquarters only had a pitiful number of twenty-odd people...</p>

    <p>"Commander, we currently have an absolute advantage on all fronts, and there hasn't been a single casualty!" First Battalion Commander, The Monk, was giving Zheng Tan, who was directing them from the rear, a simple report.</p>

    <p>Everything was within Zheng Tan's expectations.</p>

    <p>There hadn't been many people in Shadow Stream's headquarters to begin with. Some of them might have higher realms than the cats, but they were so caught up in defense mode that their realms weren't of any damn use to them. This bunch of killers were most skillful at sneaking around the back to stab someone and blow up things. As long as the cats could defend against this and trap all the enemy on the hilltop, forcing them to build a defense array, the battle plan could already be considered halfway a success.</p>

    <p>"Do we have enough cannons?" Zheng Tan asked as he raised a high-powered military telescope to survey the top of the hill.</p>

    <p>The Monk answered, "Yes, Second Battalion Commander brought a lot."</p>

    <p>Zheng Tan: "That's good. This time, our regiment brought about thirty Yidali Cannons in total, and we have enough firepower to hold the advantage. Pass my order along: tell Second Battalion Commander not to be stingy with its artillery shells; have it keep up a barrage of explosions."</p>

    <p>"Yes, Commander!" answered The Monk.</p>

    <p>The impact from the continuous and fierce bombardment by the Yidali Cannons was torturous for the Shadow Stream killers on the hilltop who were doing their best to support the protective barrier; for some of them, their hukous were already numb from the shock. An Yidali Cannon could be used up to ten times, and could fire thirty shells at a time. Hence, if there were more than enough artillery shells, a Yidali Cannon could shoot three hundred of them!</p>

    <p>Most importantly, this kind of artillery shell was as powerful as an all-out attack by a middle Golden Core stage cultivator. The most terrifying thing was that its damage output was passively increased based on the number of women present in the target of their bombing... including the Master of Shadow Stream Jiang Liuyue, there were six female Shadow Stream killers trapped on the hilltop right now!</p>

    <p>This directly increased the power of each of the Yidali Cannons by sixty percent.</p>

    <p>At the sound of the rapid and heavy bombardment, Mo Li looked anxiously at the barrier outside. He was doing all he could to strengthen their defense; if Shadow Stream reinforcements continued to be delayed, they really might not be able to survive.</p>

    <p>A Shadow Stream killer who had sustained internal injuries from the bombardment of artillery couldn't help spitting blood. "Lord Mo Li, how about we surrender..."</p>

    <p>Surrender?</p>

    <p>Mo Li gnashed his teeth hard. Surrender to a bunch of cats? What kind of foreign joke was that?!</p>

    <p>"Master, what should we do now?" Although Mo Li didn't want to surrender, the situation was already beyond any tears he could shed. After the nation had been founded, hadn't it been agreed that animals couldn't be "awakened"? These ones were damn near about to become immortal!</p>

    <p>"Is there any way to get in touch with Ah Ying? Tell her to stay away for a while and not to return here!" Jiang Liuyue was also struggling hard to prop up the barrier; she had a bad feeling.</p>

    <p>Bzz ! —</p>

    <p>At that moment, there was a flash of spirit light in the air on the top of the hill, and a snowy-white figure suddenly appeared.</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue had very sharp eyes, and clearly saw straightaway that it was a white Persian cat.</p>

    <p>Her intuition told her that this Persian cat was in cahoots with that bunch of cats down the hill!</p>

    <p>But why was this cat here? Had it been sent here by a magic weapon?</p>

    <p>There was no time to think so much given how urgent the situation was. She looked at this white cat, then bent down to abruptly lunge at it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, who had just teleported here, was still focused on locking down Zheng Tan's position when he saw a woman unexpectedly attack him with her "balls" as she caught him and held him firmly to her bosom.</p>

    <p>Before Wang Ling could figure out what this woman was thinking, Jiang Liuyue lifted him high aloft and projected her voice with a spell as she shouted down the hill: "Listen up, cats down the hill! Your little bro is now our cat hostage! Please cease your assault! Otherwise, my venerable self will kill him right away!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
