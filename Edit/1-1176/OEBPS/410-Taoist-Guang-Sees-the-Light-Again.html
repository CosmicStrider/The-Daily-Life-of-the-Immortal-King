  <h1>Chapter 410 Taoist Guang Sees the Light Again </h1>

  <div>

    <p>In a normal situation, only cultivators with high realms were capable of soul space transference since the magic required was also considerably advanced. Normally, a Soul Formation cultivator could only use fifth-grade spells at the most, Perfected Beings sixth-grade, Itinerant Immortals seventh-grade and True Immortals could use eighth-grade spells.</p>

    <p>The spell for soul space transference was an advanced eighth-grade spell.</p>

    <p>However, there was still a risk of failure with this eighth-grade spell, and in the worst case scenario, it could even destroy the soul space. Thus, Taoist Guang had taken a huge risk back then when he had implanted the soul space into the heavenly fissure stone.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling could completely disregard this.</p>

    <p>That was because the Three Thousand Great Spells were above the eighth level, and were classified as supreme spells; to be precise, Wang Ling reckoned that they were more or less at level fourteen or fifteen. Using one of the Three Thousand Great Spells to move the space would be vastly different... could an eighth-grade spell be compared with a fifteenth-grade spell? Of course not!</p>

    <p>With the ring in his hand, Wang Ling stroked Er Ha's green head, ready to transfer the space into the Soul Suppression Ring.</p>

    <p>There wasn't any seal to be seen, but Er Ha felt its head burn hot, though it was within a range it could still tolerate. Spirit light sprung up in Wang Ling's palm and enveloped Taoist Guang's soul space.</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang waited calmly on his island. He had already waited for so many years, a little while longer was nothing.</p>

    <p>Then, at that moment, he looked up at the sky.</p>

    <p>A dazzling ray of light suddenly pierced through the clouds, swiftly suffusing them with color like the spread of golden ink. In a few seconds, the entire horizon of the soul space was covered in this light.</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang was utterly shaken; what incredible spirit power! Even if he were to successfully pass through the Samsara Spirit Tribulation and reach his peak, it would be impossible for him to possess this level of power!</p>

    <p>This senior was even more terrifying than he had imagined!</p>

    <p>Just as Wang Ling's power had almost completely merged with the space, the head of a green dog was suddenly projected in the air.</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang: "..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha's voice resounded in the air, muffled as if it was the voice of Buddha. "Senior Pang, my master is currently moving your space. Please don't be nervous, just relax and don't resist it."</p>

    <p>"Right..." Taoist Guang nodded his head.</p>

    <p>He knew that the senior outside was creating a way out for him... even if Taoist Guang had been at his peak, he wouldn't have been able to resist or block this level of strength at all.</p>

    <p>He was well aware of this point and he couldn't help sighing in his heart.</p>

    <p>When all was said and done, this was an old senior who had grasped the essence of Dao, who was decisive and thorough in whatever he did, taking care to consider all the details... Taoist Guang felt that the gap between him and Wang Ling wasn't a small one.</p>

    <p>After thinking about it carefully, he had already lost. Furthermore, it was a complete defeat; in terms of virtue, intelligence, physique, and a cultured mind, it appeared that there was not one aspect in which he could top Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Activating the spell this time took a little longer; it took Wang Ling a full ten minutes to implant the entire soul space into the Soul Suppression Ring. This was a True Immortal soul space, after all, so it would still resist slightly at being transferred.</p>

    <p>Actually, this was already a hundred times faster than using a normal method of transference; the most important thing was that there truly was zero risk involved.</p>

    <p>"You can come out, Senior Pang," Er Ha said as it stared at the Soul Suppression Ring in Wang Ling's hand.</p>

    <p>The moment the soul space had been placed into the ring, Taoist Guang had already sensed the ring's power. His soul gradually started to emerge from the ring, and finally, his figure landed on the floor of Wang Ling's room.</p>

    <p>Sweeping his gaze around the room, Taoist Guang saw a green-furred dog, a young man in white, and a young man with a ring in his hand.</p>

    <p>"Many thanks, senior, for rescuing me!" Taoist Guang turned to Wang Ling at once, clasped his hands together, and bowed in thanks.</p>

    <p>"Your turn." Wang Ling got to his feet and spoke telepathically in an indifferent tone.</p>

    <p>He had done his part and would leave the rest to Lord Diulei; it was good enough for him to just listen on the side.</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang had obviously noticed that Lord Diulei and Wang Ling's relationship wasn't so simple, so he turned to ask, "This brother is...?"</p>

    <p>"I'm Brother Ling's friend, Lei Mouren. My Taoist name is Lord Diulei."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei answered, "Also, there are times when I moonlight as his secretary... Brother Ling, Ling Zhenren, usually doesn't like to talk, so Senior Pang will have to get used to it."</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang nodded his head in understanding. "Of course; after all, given the realm of a capable person like Senior Ling, every single word he utters would be a mystery only known to the heavens! But having said that, why do you call him Perfected Being when Senior Ling has such a profound realm?"</p>

    <p>"We're already used to this form of address. Brother Ling also doesn't mind, so we simply stuck to it. It's just a title, senior doesn't have to think too much about it," Lord Diulei said as he sat down on the floor.</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang let out a sigh. "I was too particular. But on the other hand, I haven't come out in so long, and I don't know what today's social customs are like in the cultivation circle. I was sealed away for almost nine hundred years, I'm sure the world has changed a great deal since then."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Senior Pang's level is so high, I believe your ability to adapt is also very high; you'll get used to it very quickly."</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang hmphed before he couldn't help asking, "One last question: what kind of thing is this magic ring holding my soul?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei replied, "This is a Soul Suppression Ring forged by Brother Ling."</p>

    <p>Soul Suppression Ring?</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang looked a little absent-minded.</p>

    <p>"Does senior know the origin of this ring?"</p>

    <p>"No... It just reminded me of something..."</p>

    <p>"So let's get started. In exchange for our help, Senior Pang agreed to tell us what you know about the Immortal's Treasure House."</p>

    <p>"Mm... I will definitely tell you every-" But before Taoist Guang finished speaking, Lord Diulei unexpectedly saw his soul directly disappear with a flash.</p>

    <p>He turned to Wang Ling. "Brother Ling, what's going on?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Ran out of power???"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling cupped his chin and thought for a bit. He guessed that there hadn't been enough spirit power contained in the Soul Suppression Ring when Taoist Guang's soul came out of it for the first time, which was why his soul had been pulled back inside. And in a situation where the soul was bound to the ring, if it couldn't come out, then there was no way to communicate with it.</p>

    <p>The Soul Suppression Ring was initially a magic weapon for preserving souls, while the one on Lord Diulei's hand was of a higher quality and thus had other unique effects compared with the holy-level Soul Suppression Ring.</p>

    <p>It would take a very, very long time for the Soul Suppression Ring to be fully recharged with spirit power...</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, do you have another way?" Lord Diulei broke out in a sweat at Wang Ling's telepathic analysis.</p>

    <p>After all, a True Immortal's soul was sure to consume massive amounts of spirit power, but to be pulled back into the ring like this each time without being able to say more than a few words... this was a real headache.</p>

    <p>"Send a computer into the ring," Wang Ling said telepathically after thinking for a while.</p>

    <p>"There's this kind of operation?"</p>

    <p>Both Er Ha and Lord Diulei were stunned when they heard this.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that they didn't have any other option now. Since he had been able to set the soul space in the ring, he could also send other things into the ring as well... If they could send an electronic gadget like a computer or a cell phone into the ring, Taoist Guang would be able to chat with them even if he couldn't show up.</p>

    <p>In addition, since the soul space had been planted in the ring, Er Ha wouldn't be able to enter it through its dream again because of the change in location.</p>

    <p>Although the ring and the old man were indeed a perfect match, after careful consideration, it wasn't like they couldn't send a computer or a cell phone into it.</p>
