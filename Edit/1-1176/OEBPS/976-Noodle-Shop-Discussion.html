  <h1>Chapter 976 Noodle Shop Discussion</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When Wang Ling led Er Ha inside, Guo Ping and Wang Ming were drinking tea, and a LCD sign on the door of the noodle shop read "Closed."</p>

    <p>Knowing that Wang Ling would be coming today, Fang Xing had talked to his foster parents last night about closing the shop, not only in consideration of Wang Ling, but also of Guo Ping's and Wang Ming's identities.</p>

    <p>Naturally, nothing needed to be said about Wang Ming: he was the institute's precious gem, and President Qi usually wouldn't let him out with his face exposed. There was even less to say about Scholar Guo Ping, the big figure at the center of heated online discussion in the last two days, who was both the diplomat for alien affairs and cosmic peace ambassador.</p>

    <p>These two dropping by was enough reason to close shop for the day.</p>

    <p>Of course, for Fang Xing, the most important person was still Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He knew that Wang Ling didn't really like dealing with strangers. Fang Xing had invited him over so many times, and now that Wang Ling was finally here, Fang Xing naturally had to consider all aspects of Wang Ling's mood.</p>

    <p>That was right - after saying so much, in the end, it was still all for Classmate Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>As Wang Ling led Er Ha in, he saw that the noodle shop was laid out in a typical way: the kitchen was right in the middle, with several pots set up and all the cooking done in front of the customers.</p>

    <p>At the back of the noodle shop was the room for the food ingredients. Fresh ingredients were restocked and replaced on a daily basis at a fixed time. Cameras had also been set up at the back to make the whole environment open and transparent so that customers could eat with peace of mind.</p>

    <p>Although this was Wang Ling's first time at the Fang family's noodle shop, he knew that it had a high rating online and was ranked first in the area of noodle dishes.</p>

    <p>This wasn't something any ordinary noodle shop could achieve.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling, you're here."</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling sat down on one side with Er Ha, he saw Fang Xing come out of the ingredients room. He was wearing a face mask, a chef's hat, and a pure white apron.</p>

    <p>"Do you know, you look very much like someone's wife today." Wang Ming laughed; when he had come before, Fang Xing had never dressed like this.</p>

    <p>"My parents said they weren't coming today, so I have to do it myself," Fang Xing shrugged and said.</p>

    <p>"Did they really not come, or did you send them away?" Wang Ming laughed.</p>

    <p>Guo Ping's gaze swept from Fang Xing to Wang Ling, the knowing expression of an old uncle on his face.</p>

    <p>"Think whatever you like. My parents are outsiders, after all. Without them around, we can discuss things more freely." Fang Xing gave a sunny smile. "In any case, I'm the chef today - do you want to eat or not?"</p>

    <p>"Eat! How can we not eat?" Wang Ming cheered; he recalled those steaks which Zhai Yin had fried on his forehead when he had been unconscious yesterday... Reportedly, when those steaks had been tossed inside the chemical disposal station, they almost burnt a huge hole in the protective wall.</p>

    <p>This was the so-called student surpassing their master; compared with Mother Juan's cooking, Zhai Yin's cooking had its own distinctive trait - a delayed toxic reaction...</p>

    <p>Those who ate Mother Juan's food would instantly "drop dead," while Zhai Yin's food didn't look poisonous nor did there seem to be any problems with eating it... However, the poison would slowly take effect after a few hours - this was the most dreadful thing about it!</p>

    <p>"Then it's settled. I'll go buy some crude oil." Fang Xing smiled as he untied the apron.</p>

    <p>"Crude oil?"</p>

    <p>"To fry crispy noodle snacks, we need to use a special type of oil, and we have to buy them from a designated supplier, who doesn't do deliveries. When I was checking the ingredients earlier, I noticed we ran out of crude oil."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing smiled at Wang Ling as he untied his apron. "Everyone, order whatever you like on the menu. If there aren't enough ingredients, I'll buy more while I'm out."</p>

    <p>"Then, a bowl of rhino horn milk noodles for me," said Guo Ping.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "I want a large bowl of housefly noodles!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "I want a bowl of elegant chicken noodles."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Okay, got it." Fang Xing smiled. He didn't ask Wang Ling what he wanted; in any case, he just needed to prepare a portion of each crispy noodle snack flavor.</p>

    <p>"Go ahead and chat, I'll be back shortly," Fang Xing said to Guo Ping and Wang Ming before taking off his apron and leaving the noodle shop.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After Fang Xing left the noodle shop, the atmosphere quieted down. After some thought, Wang Ming decided to introduce Guo Ping first since he knew it had been a little awkward when Guo Ping had dropped by the Wang family's villa last night.</p>

    <p>"Ling Ling, let me introduce you to Professor Guo Ping once more," said Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling finally gazed at Guo Ping with an air of recognition.</p>

    <p>"Professor Guo was indeed involved in a small part of the talisman seal research, but this small part was an important one. Thus, I think we will also need Professor Guo's continued assistance with follow-up research on the talisman seal," said Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>To tell the truth, Wang Ling's research had proceeded smoothly on all fronts with Guo Ping's help previously. After they had received news of Guo Ping's "death," however, Wang Ming's research hit a bottleneck.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming indeed had the most powerful brain, but sometimes, this didn't mean that he could completely do without the help of a team.</p>

    <p>Guo Ping could be considered the first comrade Wang Ming had acknowledged in the field of scientific research.</p>

    <p>Since Wang Ming had already said this, Wang Ling naturally didn't have any complaints.</p>

    <p>He could see that Guo Ping wasn't a bad person.</p>

    <p>"Why do you look frustrated?" Er Ha asked at that moment. Having a new member join them should be a happy thing.</p>

    <p>Guo Ping and Wang Ming exchanged looks, and after coming to an unspoken agreement, Guo Ping frowned. "It's like this: last night, Wang Ming received news that a huge hole had mysteriously appeared in Mixiu nation's newly constructed defense barrier on the border."</p>

    <p>"A huge hole?"</p>

    <p>"That's right. Furthermore, it was clearly man-made, and the AI security robot Mose was completely destroyed. However, Mose didn't send out any sort of warning before the problem was detected. This proves..."</p>

    <p>"This proves that this person did things quickly and neatly," Wang Ming continued. In fact, the damage to the border defense barrier was just one of several things.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming paused, and then continued. "Although we currently don't have concrete evidence, my guess... is that Devil Gut Fungus Lord and President Bai, Bai Zhe, who were already confirmed dead, have most likely been resurrected."</p>

    <p>Resurrected...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sank into silence when he heard this.</p>

    <p>The Three Thousand Great Dao did include a resurrection spell, but Wang Ling never used it as it would break the balance of life.</p>

    <p>But the issue was that if someone had used the Resurrection Heavenly Dao, Wang Ling should have sensed it. However, there hadn't been the least bit inkling yesterday of this happening.</p>

    <p>This person clearly hadn't used any of the Heavenly Dao, Outer Dao or even Divine Dao.</p>

    <p>Resurrecting Devil Gut Fungus Lord and President Bai...</p>

    <p>What was this person's aim?</p>

    <p>It didn't seem like he was looking for a cure for constipation...</p>
