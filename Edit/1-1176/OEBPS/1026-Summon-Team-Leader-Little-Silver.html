  <h1>Chapter 1026 Summon Team Leader Xiao Yin</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Not only hadn't Chen Chao and Guo Hao these two slippery fellows gotten away with their plan, their whereabouts this time had been exposed, and they would probably become Old Pan's main target of surveillance in the days to come. After this incident, Wang Ling felt that rather than say that Teacher Pan was inflexible, it was more that she was a person with principles. The main problem with copying homework wasn't the failure to absorb knowledge, but that it easily bred laziness.</p>

    <p>Once it developed into the "laziness cancer," then it really would be completely incurable...</p>

    <p>When Foundation Establishment high school students entered the second semester of Senior Grade Two, they started to do wave after wave of practice exercises, as if they were stir-frying leftover rice<sup>1</sup>, which was bound to be boring and tedious. A lazy student might feel that to copy someone else's homework was to master the content already, when in fact there was no improvement at all.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(To rehash something or serve up the same old product.)</dfn>

    <p>Review the old to understand the new.</p>

    <p>The reason why Old Pan was so strict was so that the kids could get through the college entrance exam smoothly.</p>

    <p>She didn't blame them for not understanding her intentions now; in any case, once the college entrance exam was over, gratitude and grudges alike would end with it.</p>

    <p>Thus, it wasn't like Wang Ling hadn't obtained anything from this outing.</p>

    <p>It gave him a little more understanding about the kind of person his homeroom teacher Old Pan was.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan's "vanguard teacher" title was a hot topic both in and outside school. After her ex-student Zhuo Yi made a name for himself in battle, Teacher Pan's career took off; she was awarded the title "City Gold-Class Teacher" several years running after that.</p>

    <p>This selection naturally aroused criticism and dispute.</p>

    <p>Some felt that Teacher Pan's abilities didn't live up to the title and she didn't deserve it at all; with her own hands, however, she had ultimately proven that she was indeed an outstanding teacher of the people.</p>

    <p>Apart from understanding Old Pan a little better, Wang Ling had also gained something else.</p>

    <p>While it had looked like one group coming to grab homework on the street, it was actually two different forces.</p>

    <p>After the Palace of Mirrors incident, the black shadow army that had disappeared had revealed themselves here once again.</p>

    <p>Someone else might not have been able to confirm that the second force among the group of killers were black shadow soldiers, but that definitely couldn't escape Wang Ling's eyes.</p>

    <p>The other party had spent a long time setting up the Palace of Mirrors, but when it came down to the crunch, there wasn't any resistance at all and the entire army had retreated. The purpose behind this was very clear: the Palace of Mirrors was a stepping stone in a bigger plot.</p>

    <p>This was a far trickier villain than any he had faced before; if the Night Chief task difficulty was S-level, Wang Ling felt that the reappearance of this black shadow army could be rated 3S for the time being.</p>

    <p>"Are there two parties?"</p>

    <p>That night, Wang Ling had a text message conversation with Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>The reappearance of the black shadow army was the greatest piece of news, because they still knew nothing about this force. They currently didn't know what this group's objective was, and any bit of information they could get was good.</p>

    <p>Speaking of the Office of Strategic Deception gathering information, this was handled by the intelligence team, and the team leader was Xiao Yin. But in truth, Xiao Yin just supervised the Lord and Lady of the Castle. Before Mo Immortal Castle was annexed by the Office of Strategic Deception, it had once been the largest intelligence organization in Huaxiu nation and even enjoyed a good reputation overseas.</p>

    <p>After being annexed, their intelligence network wasn't impaired; on the contrary, it was enhanced with funding. However, the Office of Strategic Deception didn't keep this intelligence network to itself; apart from private commissions, which weren't made public, the intelligence, for the most part, was also shared with Huaxiu Alliance.</p>

    <p>For example, the intelligence on the black shadow army this time.</p>

    <p>With the other party exposing themselves in Songhai city, the crucial task now was to track down their base.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, Brother Ling, I'll take care of it," Lord Diulei vowed. He realized that right now, the black shadow army was a formidable enemy which would likely become a problem for the Office of Strategic Deception in the future. Thus, before the real war broke out, it was crucial for them to learn everything about this group.</p>

    <p>When it came to gathering information, Wang Ling actually had a second task he wanted carried out. It was a private matter, however, so Wang Ling didn't go into detail with Lord Diulei, and decided to wait for Xiao Yin first.</p>

    <p>It was actually about Number 60 High's missing Jade Scroll of School History. Teacher Pan had already made up a reason and taken Sun Rong's homework back with her, but Er Ha had smelled something on the exercise book.</p>

    <p>Exercise books that had bits of the Jade Scroll of School History mixed into them were clearly different from the rest. Wang Ling thought that if Er Ha and Xiao Yin teamed up for a search, they should be able to find all the fragments of the scroll very quickly.</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong's detector, which had been developed by the office of academic affairs, only had a fifty-meter range, to say nothing of how dangerous it was with the dispatched killers lurking all over Songhai city. But Er Ha and Xiao Yin were different; after being raised by Wang Ling, Er Ha was almost on the level of a quasi-holy beast, while Xiao Yin was a holy beast to begin with.</p>

    <p>Holy beasts aside, a quasi-holy beast's level of aura perception was already very acute, and was even more accurate than some magical instruments.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling hadn't planned to get involved in school matters at first.</p>

    <p>But he decided to help out this time.</p>

    <p>Not for Number 60, or for Headmaster Chen, but for Old Pan.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin had been holed up inside Lord Diulei's villa ever since the Beast King's Remains incident. Occasionally, he would go to the Office of Strategic Deception's Internet cafe to test out Cultivation Emulator with Bai Qiao.</p>

    <p>Cultivation Emulator's first trial run had been a success, garnering a lot of good reviews from players. However, the virtual pod's mind link function had to be made more stable for a better gaming experience, so the beta test was postponed yet again.</p>

    <p>Actually, quite a number of big shots among the internal staff had participated in the first trial run.</p>

    <p>For example, Holy Beast King and Daoist Guang.</p>

    <p>While Holy Beast King had been rescued from his seclusion and was no longer trapped inside an endless plot loop in his game world, he had been trapped for too long, and had completely become a gamer shut-in. Furthermore, he had become obsessed with live streams and was now a fan of Daoist Guang.</p>

    <p>As for Daoist Guang, he was now at his peak.</p>

    <p>His number of believers could already make one loop around the earth.</p>

    <p>But it seemed that Daoist Guang still had no intention of being resurrected - it was too much fun being a live streamer!</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin also kept himself busy; after becoming addicted to Father Wang's novels, he started to write his own stories. He loved sharing them with Lord Diulei, and would sometimes read it in the latter's face, looking for praise.</p>

    <p>"Thunder, Thunder! Look! What about this section I wrote? Master will definitely like it!"</p>

    <p>This was the sentence Lord Diulei heard the most from Xiao Yin recently.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei wasn't familiar with raising holy beasts, but he had come to realize that no matter how good he was to Xiao Yin, Master was still number one in the latter's heart. Honestly speaking, Lord Diulei felt a little jealous sometimes.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was slouched somewhat dispiritedly on the sofa in the morning; he was feeling a little weary after going out several days in a row to collect materials around the clock.</p>

    <p>"Brother Xiao, you should slow down..."</p>

    <p>"I don't have a choice; collecting materials is like this, but you don't need to worry about me." Xiao Yin waved his hand.</p>

    <p>Then, he slowly got up from the sofa and struggled to change his clothes to go out. "Thunder, I'm leaving... I won't be back for dinner."</p>

    <p>"It's only seven in the morning; where are you going so early?" Lord Diulei was startled.</p>

    <p>"I checked my inbox earlier, and I just saw Master's text... I need to hurry over."</p>

    <p>"Your aura is so weak, are you really alright?"</p>

    <p>"Hm, I do seem a little down... this isn't like me..."</p>

    <p>After saying that, Xiao Yin bit his finger and sucked the holy beast blood that trickled out. After that, he bounced back to life as his expression glowed once again and he brimmed with vitality.</p>

    <p>He ran to the door. "I'm leaving!!!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>
