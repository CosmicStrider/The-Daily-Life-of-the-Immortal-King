  <h1>Chapter 264 Who Says All Novel Editors Are Damn Fat Nerds?! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was still quite early at around eight o'clock. While Wang Ling ate some boiled dumplings for breakfast, he skimmed through the group chat and noticed that it was very lively that morning. Dharmaraja had opened a can of worms by talking about Devil Valley.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had heard of this legendary secret land before, but it was unfortunate that it appeared very rarely. Additionally, this legend had basically come about through rumors in the cultivation circle, which in turn appeared most often in WeChat Moments. No one had ever seen it with their own eyes, and according to reliable statistics, it had appeared fewer times than the Gate Between Worlds.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was thus very interested in this mystical land. At the same time, he was actually looking for Lord Diulei in relation to another matter.</p>

    <p>The giant troll arm which had been severed by the closing of the Gate Between Worlds during the joint military training exercise for the six schools a few days ago was still in his vision field. This was the limb of a demon king, and even in the vision field, it wouldn't decompose.</p>

    <p>But honestly speaking, it wasn't of any use to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Certainly, this demon king's arm would actually be very valuable to a cultivator. Unfortunately, however, neither Father Wang nor Mother Wang could enjoy it. Even if it was just one limb, the demon energy it contained was too dense. If an ordinary person ingested just one mouthful of it, they definitely wouldn't be able to withstand the impact of the demon energy, and their body would explode, resulting in their death.</p>

    <p>Hence, Wang Ling thought it was best to hand it over to Thunder for recycling as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>The arm of a demon king troll, from tendon to bone, was priceless.</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang could use the bones in refining weapons, and the remaining muscles could be ground into powder for Immortal Toya to use in medicine.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When Lie Mengmeng went upstairs to take a shower, Mother Wang cleared the table. Wang Ling was just about to go upstairs when he heard her voice from the kitchen. "Ling Ling, there seems to be an express delivery at the front door. Check and see if it's for you."</p>

    <p>Someone had sent him something?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling hesitated; he couldn't think of anyone who would send him something. And now... even the delivery person had come and gone like a thief, leaving as soon as they had put down the package and without even asking for a signature to confirm the delivery. Just the thought of it was intriguing.</p>

    <p>As expected, when he reached the door, Wang Ling discovered that an express delivery package had been left on the ground.</p>

    <p>It was wrapped tightly enough that it could be described as airtight. It was a thin cardboard box actually wrapped in a black iron membrane that was in turn wrapped in a thick layer of plastic. In other words, only a cultivator, and not an ordinary person, would be able to open this express package.</p>

    <p>Given the quality and durability of the black iron membrane, you had to be at the Core Formation stage at least if you wanted to open this package without using a magic treasure.</p>

    <p>But... who on earth had sent this to him?</p>

    <p>The sender's name on the package was a string of asterisks, so clearly it had been handled anonymously.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought it was very strange and also a little suspicious, because he hadn't sensed anyone at all passing by the villa earlier. It was very clear that the delivery employee was likely an expert, and furthermore was very good at concealing themselves, so Wang Ling had been negligent, and had been caught unawares.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling picked up the package. After listening for any sounds, he gave it an abrupt shake. The contents of the package had also been treated with extreme care, and there wasn't the slightest trace of movement inside. Wang Ling then opened his Heavenly Eye to look directly inside the package and confirm that it didn't contain anything dangerous like bombs.</p>

    <p>It actually contained a very small USB drive.</p>

    <p>After some contemplation, he used his fingernails to cut open the package as easily as if he was cutting through tofu.</p>

    <p>"Elder sister, your water heater is so amazing! It actually uses a smart sensor thermostat! When I started feeling a little cold, it immediately warmed up!" As Lie Mengmeng come downstairs, he sang the praises of the smart water heater that had been developed through Wang Ming's research.</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng was wearing a long-sleeved shirt and jeans which belonged to Father Wang; under the collar, Wang Ling could just see the bright red long johns which Lie Mengmeng was wearing inside.</p>

    <p>"Don't be shy, make yourself at home," Mother Wang replied.</p>

    <p>The water heater Lie Mengmeng was talking about was probably one of the very few things in the Wang family home which Wang Ling hadn't enlightened. The Wang family's small villa had three bathrooms, and apart from his own ensuite toilet, Wang Ling hadn't touched the others.</p>

    <p>The water heater had been installed above the infrared heater in the bathroom. If Wang Ling had transformed this guy into a goblin with its own awareness, it would be weird to be stared at every day when you were taking a bath.</p>

    <p>After his bath, Lie Mengmeng was in much better spirits. His eyes were so sharp that when he saw the USB in Wang Ling's hand, he recognized the logo on it at a glance, and his expression turned excited. "Isn't that the new game, Escape? !"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling never expected that this USB would have just a game on it. He had initially thought that it would contain something like "educational videos" on human reproduction...</p>

    <p>"I've seen the previews for this game. According to the deity lord in the game, once you complete each of the tasks given and survive the checkpoints, you win after reaching the last point!" Lie Mengmeng stared at the USB in Wang Ling's hand, his face full of envy. "But the game hasn't been officially released on the market, and whatever is being released now are all advanced editions. How on earth did you get it?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at the USB in bewilderment, and seriously wondered if this game had been sent to the wrong person.</p>

    <p>After all, he loved studying so much!</p>

    <p>"A lot of people can participate in this game at the same time! Do you want... to give it a go?" Lie Mengmeng stared at the USB and swallowed. Wang Ling felt that if he didn't hold this otaku back, he would definitely eat this USB.</p>
    
    <p>Looking at Lie Mengmeng's expression, Wang Ling suddenly recalled when Father Wang had once said that all editors were in fact damn fat nerds<sup>1</sup> ... but now, Wang Ling could see how Lie Mengmeng was different to other editors - it turned out that there weren't just damn fat nerds, but there were also damn skinny nerds!</p>

<dfn><sup>1</sup>(As a reminder, this is a literal
translation of a phrase a girl
used to mock guys who only
know how to play games, and
which has since become a
meme.)</dfn>

    <p>Unable to withstand Lie Mengmeng's hot gaze, Wang Ling could only take the other man back to his bedroom, turn on the computer, and put in the USB.</p>

    <p>In less than a minute, the game called Escape had automatically been installed onto the computer.</p>

    <p>Once the progress bar was full, the game window popped up directly.</p>

    <p>Normally, Wang Ling seldom played games, but he was still stunned by how refined this game was; after it loaded, the entire interface was directly projected from the computer screen as it enveloped the whole room, creating a holographic effect!</p>

    <p>"This game is too awesome!" Lie Mengmeng was very excited. "The computer graphics are so well done. This USB is a piece of black technology!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't say anything as the scenery around him fluctuated.</p>

    <p>Then, a line of scarlet words suddenly appeared in the void in front of him.</p>

    <p>"Want to understand the meaning of life? Want to live... a real life <sup>2</sup> ?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is a line from a scene in
the first chapter of the web
novel 'Terror Infinity' which
has become something of a
meme in itself ..)</dfn>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>For some reason, Wang Ling felt like he had heard these words before.</p>
