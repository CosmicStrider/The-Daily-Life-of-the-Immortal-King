  <h1>Chapter 493 Heartbroken Mr Lu </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Mr Lu hadn't expected his Skywalker sword to be so thoroughly destroyed...</p>

    <p>This was a second-class holy weapon!</p>

    <p>Why had a second-class holy weapon turned into a ball of slag after colliding with a physical fist?</p>

    <p>Gazing at this scene, Mr Lu froze the instant the Skywalker sword shattered. When he came back to his senses, Xiao Yin's fist was already glued to his face...</p>

    <p>Mr Lu's face and Xiao Yin's fist came into intimate contact without the slightest gap between them... and his entire body was sent flying by this single attack.</p>

    <p>His face completely caved in.</p>

    <p>This punch was like hitting a thick and solid tree trunk, and it left a deep impression of a fist in his face.</p>

    <p>"So weak..."</p>

    <p>Staring at Mr Lu who had been sent flying by his fist, sweat suddenly ran down Xiao Yin's face as he blurted out the words almost subconsciously.</p>

    <p>The Tree clan wasn't very lethal to begin with. They only had superior toughness and a formidable regenerative ability. Additionally, the spells they used mostly had to do with containment.</p>

    <p>Spirit beasts and demon beasts had their own attributes, and it was the same for holy beasts.</p>

    <p>As a representative of the Silver Unicorn clan, Xiao Yin's role was that of a Tank Berserker; they weren't just capable of fighting and carrying a battle, they were also absolute strength-type warriors. If a holy war erupted, the silver unicorns would be at the very front of the line... what a pity that in the end, a holy war had never happened back then.</p>

    <p>Starting a holy war was a very complicated process which required holy beast representatives to convene together at a general assembly where clan leaders participated in a vote which would decide the outcome.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin remembered when the first holy beast general assembly had convened back then; it had been the largest number of holy beast representatives to come together. As a junior from the younger generation, Xiao Yin had been permitted to sit in the back during the assembly.</p>

    <p>At the first holy beast general assembly, representatives from all the clans had engaged in heated discussion on the recent chatter among human cultivators and the capture of holy beasts. Some representatives had proposed launching a holy war; unfortunately, since this incident hadn't had much of an impact, the holy beasts from the other clans hadn't sensed how serious the problem was.</p>

    <p>And so the first proposal for a holy war fell through.</p>

    <p>Then came the second general assembly.</p>

    <p>Dog Saint, as the representative of the Dog clan, had brought up the idea of a holy war again, demanding that all holy beasts unite to stand in opposition against those human cultivators who mercilessly hunted holy beasts.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, this proposal hadn't passed, either...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin had sat in the back at every holy beast assembly, so his memory of the proceedings was very vivid.</p>

    <p>He clearly remembered that when the third holy beast general assembly had been held, the number of holy beast representatives from the different clans had already declined by half.</p>

    <p>It was said that those who hadn't shown up had been eaten...</p>

    <p>And spectacularly, Dog Saint was on that list...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin remembered how detached his expression already had been back then - he remembered that he hadn't spoken for a very long time; after all, he had witnessed Dog Saint being turned into hot pot stew...</p>

    <p>At that holy beast general assembly, the holy beast representatives finally realized how serious the problem was when they saw how their numbers had been halved.</p>

    <p>But given how violent and crazed the humans were, the representatives had felt that it was ill-advised to start a holy war at that time since it would mean putting everything on the line; in the end, the holy beasts could all be completely wiped out. Back then, they had suggested sending a holy beast ambassador to negotiate with the human cultivators, clarify the rumor that eating holy beasts could boost realms, and sign a nonaggression treaty with them.</p>

    <p>Then Xiao Yin remembered...</p>

    <p>The holy beast ambassador that had been sent that year never returned.</p>

    <p>And then... there was no "and then"...</p>

    <p>Because there had been no holy beast representatives at the fourth holy beast general assembly.</p>

    <p>The assembly never convened again after that...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>While analyzing the traits of his Silver Unicorn clan in a split second during this battle, Xiao Yin recalled events to do with the holy beast general assembly, and felt both frustrated and sorrowful.</p>

    <p>Therefore, as the last remaining physical Tank Berserker of the Silver Unicorn clan, Xiao Yin could be said to already hold an overwhelming advantage from the very beginning in terms of combat power.</p>

    <p>But even so, he felt that it was still a bit of an exaggeration for him to destroy a second-class holy weapon with one blow... Furthermore, he hadn't used all of his strength at all!</p>

    <p>When he saw his Skywalker sword destroyed, Mr Lu became distracted during the battle and suffered a punch from Xiao Yin head on. He hit the ground in the distance, a burning pain in his face.</p>

    <p>"Spell of... Creation and Rebirth!" Mr Lu roared in his heart, and a green light poured out of the injury on his face. But this light only fixed the depression in his face, while the wound wasn't the least bit healed; even the swelling hadn't gone down.</p>

    <p>"How can this be?!"</p>

    <p>Mr Lu's face was full of shock. His Spell of Creation and Rebirth actually wasn't working?</p>

    <p>Not far away, Xiao Yin brushed the sawdust off his fist and went over to Mr Lu. He crouched down, looked at this badly battered Mr Lu, and couldn't help sighing. "It's useless... I smeared a layer of my saliva on my fist earlier; it's especially effective against spells."</p>

    <p>Mr Lu: "..." What kind of operation was this?</p>

    <p>Actually, Xiao Yin was worried about Mr Lu's feelings, so he had told him it was saliva when in fact it wasn't.</p>

    <p>Instead, it was Xiao Yin's phlegm...</p>

    <p>Apart from dissolving corpses, his phlegm had a lot of different "magical effects."</p>

    <p>"Even if that's the case, you shouldn't be able to destroy my Skywalker sword with just one punch!" Mr Lu's heart ached and his eyes instantly turned red like a pitiful old man.</p>

    <p>Tree goblins were originally creatures with tough bodies... and fragile hearts. Xiao Yin stared at this old man who looked like he was about to cry, and for the moment didn't have the heart to kill him.</p>

    <p>Because this Mr Lu was indeed really pitiful.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin curled his fingers to catch some fragments of the Skywalker sword before he weighed them in his hand.</p>

    <p>Sure enough...</p>

    <p>It was as he had expected.</p>

    <p>There was something fishy about this Skywalker sword.</p>

    <p>Even when a genuine second-class holy weapon was reduced to chips, the texture shouldn't feel this poor.</p>

    <p>So this "Skywalker sword" was a genuine fake.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"You've been duped... this isn't the Skywalker sword at all." Xiao Yin pursed his lips and didn't know how to open his mouth because he could already hear Mr Lu sobbing.</p>

    <p>"Impossible! That's impossible! Our president spent ten million immortal gold bars to buy this for me! It's impossible for Jingxi International Mall to stock fake goods!" Unconvinced, Mr Lu took his phone out of his pocket and even showed Xiao Yin a screenshot of the electronic purchase.</p>

    <p>The "picture of actual object" above it did indeed look the same as the one in Xiao Yin's memory.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin stared at the picture with his chin in his hand and thought it was very strange. "But why is yours a cane sword?"</p>

    <p>"The seller said that he modified the Skywalker sword!" After saying that, Mr Lu provided a second screenshot. This time, the picture in it was of Mr Lu's cane sword.</p>

    <p>Then, in front of Mr Lu, Xiao Yin used the product search function to browse the online mall, and in the end discovered a lot of the exact same version of that cane sword.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, the name of this cane sword was actually quite similar to the Skywalker sword...</p>

    <p>The full name of this cane sword was: Gentle Walker sword <sup>1</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The Chinese character for 夭 'gentle' looks almost the same as 天 'sky .. ')</dfn>
