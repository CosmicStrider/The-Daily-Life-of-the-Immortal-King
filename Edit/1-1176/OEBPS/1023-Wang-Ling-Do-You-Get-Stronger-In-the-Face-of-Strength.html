  <h1>Chapter 1023 Wang Ling, Do You Get Stronger In the Face of Strength?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>As a pioneer teacher at Number 60 High, Teacher Pan was without doubt a capable and formidable woman. Wang Ling had to admit that when he first entered Number 60 High, he hadn't liked his teacher-in-charge of his. However, after prolonged association, he had discovered a side of Teacher Pan which no one knew. As for when his view of her completely changed, it was during the incident with Lao Gudong and his junior brother Daoist Taotie a few months ago.</p>

    <p>Their quarrel had led to the Shuigou Sect incident, which affected a number of innocent students. It was during this very incident that Teacher Pan had proven to everyone that she was an outstanding teacher of the people of the cultivation world.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, there were times when she was very inflexible.</p>

    <p>For example, she attached great importance to her students' grades.</p>

    <p>And as another example, in an age of free love, she was inflexible about banning puppy love among her students.</p>

    <p>But in this world, was there anyone who could be the best and most perfect person?</p>

    <p>It could only be said that as a teacher-in-charge, Teacher Pan stood by her own teaching style.</p>

    <p>Even though she was well aware that such insistence looked like "inflexibility" in the eyes of some students.</p>

    <p>In the convenience store, Wang Ling looked out the window.</p>

    <p>He felt that given Old Pan's personality, she would probably still go out to catch students copying homework even if the Jade Scroll of School History hadn't gone missing.</p>

    <p>Su Xiao sent their location to Chen Chao in the group chat. "We're in the convenience store next to the coffee shop, but we can't get in..." After that, he sent a picture taken from the window of the convenience store. Although it wasn't very clear, it still caught half of Old Pan's back.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Inside the coffee shop, Chen Chao and Guo Hao were stupefied when they saw the photo.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "Shit! Why is Old Pan at the entrance now... the summer break isn't over yet, right???"</p>

    <p>Su Xiao: "Did they bring forward the period to catch people?"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao was upset for a moment when he heard this; in the past few years, the teachers only started hunting down those copying homework close to the end of the summer break; it was happening a little too early this year.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "Surely the teachers aren't that free? Maybe she has some other task? But to be on the safe side, let's end today's operation here and meet another day..."</p>

    <p>"We have no choice, that's the only thing we can do." Guo Hao nodded his head.</p>

    <p>These two crafty class fellows instantly turned into wusses in front of Old Pan, and Wang Ling couldn't help but sigh at their true nature.</p>

    <p>But given the situation today, they indeed had no other choice, and Wang Ling could only leave with Er Ha first.</p>

    <p>Getting to his feet, he looked down involuntarily, and his brain mind blank — unexpectedly, Er Ha had disappeared!</p>

    <p>"The hell, Wang Ling, did you bring Er Ha with you?" At that moment, Su Xiao was struck by fright when he looked outside the convenience store.</p>

    <p>At the convenience store entrance, Teacher Pan was rubbing Er Ha's chubby, green body... Poor Er Ha had been caught, and its face was full of despair as it stretched out its paws in the direction of the convenience store...</p>

    <p>It had left Wang Ling just now to relieve itself at the base of a tree, and never expected to be caught by Teacher Pan on its way back to the convenience store.</p>

    <p>To Er Ha, she was a scary woman... the reason it was able to become a dog back then was largely thanks to her.</p>

    <p>Trouble always came in twos and threes! Who would have thought that Er Ha would once again fall into Teacher Pan's hands?</p>

    <p>At the same time, Su Xiao saw Er Ha waving at the convenience store and was immediately anxious. "Shit! Don't wave in this direction!!! Old Pan will see everything!!!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Thus, what Wang Ling was most worried about still happened.</p>

    <p>At Er Ha's waving, Teacher Pan finally noticed the two figures in the convenience store. She walked in with Er Ha in her arms and adjusted her gold-rimmed glasses. "Students Su Xiao and Wang Ling, why are you here?"</p>

    <p>Despite her question, she didn't seem to think Su Xiao and Wang Ling were copying homework.</p>

    <p>Su Xiao was the class commissary in charge of studies and a well-behaved kid, as well as the Dao talisman class representative, so Old Pan had a good impression of him at school.</p>

    <p>As for Wang Ling, this kid didn't like to talk and his grades never changed; he was always in the middle in the class ranking. However, Teacher felt that he was an open and guileless kid, which was rare — at least, he didn't create havoc at school. Also, the most important thing was that Wang Ling's handwriting was very good — beautiful and neat. Thus, while Teacher Pan's impression of Wang Ling wasn't as good as of Su Xiao, she didn't detest him.</p>

    <p>What was more, Wang Ling was the class mascot.</p>

    <p>The sudden appearance of the class commissary and mascot naturally wouldn't arouse Teacher Pan's suspicions.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, she didn't see any other students nearby, which excluded the possibility that they were lending their homework out to be copied.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling heard Teacher Pan's thoughts, a few beads of cold sweat trickled out...</p>

    <p>When all was said and done, she was a vanguard teacher of Number 60 High, and her instincts were absolutely spot-on.</p>

    <p>"Hello, Teacher Pan!" Su Xiao hurriedly greeted her. "It's like this: Classmate Wang Ling was just about to come over to my place with Er Ha to play!"</p>

    <p>"I see." Teacher Pan nodded.</p>

    <p>Su Xiao had simply made up an excuse, but it was foolproof since his place indeed wasn't far from here. It was completely possible that Wang Ling had come with Er Ha to play with Su Xiao; Teacher Pan was even a little happy to hear that.</p>

    <p>She thus said, "If it were anyone else, I would think they had come out to copy homework, but Su Xiao would never do such a foolish thing."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Su Xiao: "..."</p>

    <p>After that, Teacher Pan turned to Wang Ling and gave him a rare smile. "I never thought that Student Wang Ling could be so motivated."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "???"</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan: "Taking Er Ha out on such a hot day to look for Su Xiao, you probably have some study problem you want him to help you with?"</p>

    <p>Su Xiao hurriedly nodded his head and replied very quickly, "Yes yes yes!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Su Xiao actually wasn't good at lying, but after hanging around Chen Chao and Guo Hao these two slick customers, this Student Su Xiao had completely turned into Peanut Oil...</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan: "It's good to want to make progress. Your grades have always been right down the middle in class, and I find it strange that they've never changed. Looking at your previous test papers, your grades are always in the middle whether the questions are difficult or easy... Wang Ling, do you get stronger in the face of strength, and weaker in the face of weakness?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>"But as long as you're motivated, I believe your grades will definitely improve." Teacher Pan nodded meaningfully before reaching out to rub Wang Ling's head lightly.</p>

    <p>It was at that moment that her wristwatch suddenly vibrated.</p>

    <p>It was in response to a fragment of the Jade Scroll of School History!</p>

    <p>It was inside a range of fifty meters around them!</p>

    <p>"Student Wang Ling, Student Su Xiao, I still have something urgent to deal with! We'll talk later! I'm leaving first!" After that, Teacher Pan directly summoned her spirit sword, stepped on it, and flew out of the convenience store with a whoosh.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At that moment, not far from the convenience store —</p>

    <p>Sun Rong and Lin Xiaoyu, who hadn't shown up in the book for so long that even the author might have forgotten about them, were walking out of a mall hand-in-hand...</p>
