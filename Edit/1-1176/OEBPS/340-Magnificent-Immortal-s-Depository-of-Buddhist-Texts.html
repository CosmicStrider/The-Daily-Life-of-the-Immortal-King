  <h1>Chapter 340 Magnificent Immortal's Depository of Buddhist Texts </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Spending time with Zhai Yin felt like being possessed by a ghost... another way to put it was that this Zhai Yin was harder to deal with than a ghost. Now that Wang Ling had given him a warning in the Wang family's small villa, he didn't follow them upstairs. But in fact, after leaving the villa the last time, Wang Ming had personally raised the issue with President Qi. If it hadn't been for President Qi's directive, it was likely that Zhai Yin might have continued to be bull-headed about following Wang Ming everywhere.</p>

    <p>As soon as they got back to the room on the second floor, Wang Ming flopped onto the bed as if it was his own; he truly felt utterly drained.</p>

    <p>The most troublesome part was that Zhai Yin wasn't afraid of Wang Ming complaining about him to President Qi at all; this was obvious in his attitude after he had entered the villa. When all was said and done, it was President Qi who had roped him in with much difficulty, and he couldn't just dismiss Zhai Yin at will. At most, Wang Ming could only submit his complaints.</p>

    <p>This was the so-called "easy to invite a spirit in, but difficult to get rid of them."</p>

    <p>Of course, there were a lot of complicated factors involved. One of them was that Wang Ming was someone under state protection, so in theory he couldn't reject whoever they had arranged to protect him. As a state researcher, he couldn't get away from Zhai Yin's "protection," not even when he was just doing everyday research. That feeling of being stared at all the time was truly painful.</p>

    <p>"Ling Ling! I want to die!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming grumbled on the bed. "Do you know, this guy is from the Magnificent Immortal Special Army Brigade."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's expression couldn't help twitching at this name. Since encountering Number 60 High School's school guard Old Li, he had privately started to find out about the structure of the national special combat forces. The Magnificent Immortal Special Army Brigade stood on top of all these special forces and was a leader's division that had direct jurisdiction over many special forces. Compared with the Magnificent Immortal Special Army Brigade, Old Li's Seven Stars was just a small branch.</p>

    <p>Anyone who came out of Magnificent Immortal was an expert with strength that was definitely not ordinary.</p>

    <p>"Now you probably know the reason why President Qi pulled him in and can't dismiss him so easily, right?" Wang Ming looked at Wang Ling and sighed helplessly. "Also, this guy has a special identity..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "?"</p>

    <p>"Magnificent Immortal has the largest depository of Buddhist texts in the whole of Huaxiu nation. It has many secret martial arts manuscripts that have been handed down since ancient times. In order to safeguard this depository back then, the country established a special force to guard it round the clock. That was the beginning of this Magnificent Immortal," Wang Ming said. "Do you know the sweeper high monk <sup>1</sup> ?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Adapted from a character in the Chinese series 'Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils' who maintains the Shaolin Sect's library ..)</dfn>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling nodded.</p>

    <p>"This guy's identity is similar to the high monk's; he used to watch the depository, and his position was like that of a librarian. What kind of idiot would let themselves be dragged over here by Old Qi..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Perhaps it was because he had been tormented relentlessly by Zhai Yin during this period, but Wang Ming spent half an hour upstairs venting his pain before he was able to release the stifling grievances in his heart. He knew that Wang Ling's bedroom had a soundproof barrier, thus he completely wasn't afraid of Zhai Yin hearing him.</p>

    <p>It had been pretty good when no one had followed him around before, but now that Zhai Yin was always with him, even checking his phone messages from time to time, it really got on Wang Ming's nerves.</p>

    <p>But even though he was spouting all these complaints, Wang Ling actually knew that Wang Ming had his own motives.</p>

    <p>Since he couldn't drive Zhai Yin away, he would make full use of him. Apart from protecting Wang Ming, there was actually another large potential that could be exploited here... In some sense, Wang Ming thought that Zhai Yin's brain was also a fine rarity which wouldn't lose out to his most powerful brain. After all, Zhai Yin had been at the depository of Buddhist texts for hundreds of years - his whole being was now a walking depository!</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "Ling... given the huge amount of knowledge Zhai Yin has, do you think there are any records in the depository that might help me to cultivate?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's lips twitched. "..."</p>

    <p>What crazy thoughts was this guy having...</p>

    <p>Since young, Wang Ming had been unable to cultivate because of his physique, which wasn't something that could be changed easily. Of course, if he really wanted to cultivate, it wasn't like he couldn't. Wang Ling knew a forbidden spell which involved an equivalent exchange. However, Wang Ming's most valuable asset was his brain - exchanging it for the chance to cultivate... in Wang Ling's eyes, this would be an utterly stupid trade.</p>

    <p>If you didn't even have your brain, what kind of freaking cultivation could you do?!</p>

    <p>"There are a lot of things inside Magnificent Immortal's depository which you would never have heard of or seen before. Who knows, it may have a technique to help you contain your aura so that you won't need to use the talisman seal anymore!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming cupped his chin and looked at Wang Ling seriously. "Ling, how about you knock Zhai Yin out, then I can cut his head open to study his brain?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..." Who on earth would consider this scary thought so seriously...</p>

    <p>Ignoring Wang Ming's wild imagination, Wang Ling directly opened his Heavenly Eye and took out the Heavenly Materials sword from his vision field to give to Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming patted his head. It wasn't until he saw this sword that he remembered his real business!</p>

    <p>"I'll take this sword back and study it." Wang Ming nodded his head as he put it in his storage ring. The ring was charged with spirit energy, otherwise Wang Ming, who lacked spirit energy, wouldn't be able to operate the the storage space at all. When the ring ran out of spirit energy, he would recharge it; a full charge could last up to roughly a week.</p>

    <p>This was Wang Ming's specialty: researching and inventing cultivation magic treasures which were fused with black technology.</p>

    <p>"Oh, that's right; Lingzi, I have something to give you."</p>

    <p>He took out an egg-sized object the size of his palm from the storage ring and handed it to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"You probably don't know, but this is auntie's time capsule. Before you were born, all of auntie's novel drafts were placed in this capsule. At that time, uncle and auntie asked me to store them, so I took them back to my lab and created a time capsule." Speaking up to this point, Wang Ming looked embarrassed. "However, there was a small accident at the time..."</p>

    <p>"?" Wang Ling had a puzzled expression on his face as he held the capsule in his hand.</p>

    <p>"Back then, when General Yi was pursuing the old devil, he planned to activate the power of the Stone Gate and send the surveillance chip which I'd developed back into the past. But before that, that bunch of people decided to test it out first with something else."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>When he said this, Wang Ming covered his face helplessly. "I don't know which dumbass then sent this time capsule back into the past - it was only sent back here recently..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "So, I think it's still better if you hold on to it."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming had felt apprehensive the entire time that the time capsule had been missing; now that he had delivered it back into Wang Ling's hands, he could finally sigh in relief.</p>

    <p>"Oh, that's right, that unpublished novel which auntie had been working on under her new pen name before she stopped writing is also inside the capsule. If you're interested, you can take a look, it's pretty good!" Wang Ming sat cross-legged on the bed as he looked at Wang Ling and said excitedly, "Also, her new pen name was pretty impressive!"</p>

    <p><em>What was it? </em>Wang Ling asked.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "Numinous Mother with the Magic Hands!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
