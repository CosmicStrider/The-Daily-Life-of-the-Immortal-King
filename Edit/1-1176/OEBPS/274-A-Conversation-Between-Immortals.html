  <h1>Chapter 274 A Conversation Between Immortals </h1>

  <div>

    <p>As he stared at the nine question marks, the eastern branch chief was lost in deep thought for a long time.</p>

    <p>The eastern branch chief: "What's this?"</p>

    <p>"This is the surveillance data on that spirit sword... according to Master, this spirit sword's power index is already beyond the range that our instruments can measure," said Tan Qian.</p>

    <p>"Something like this can happen?" The eastern branch chief frowned tightly.</p>

    <p>"Just now, Master ordered us to thoroughly investigate the master of this spirit sword."</p>

    <p>"Investigate? Hehe, then don't we have a big advantage?" The eastern branch chief laughed sinisterly. "At the very least, we know that this spirit sword's master is definitely connected to the people in that villa... Sure enough, it was the right decision back then to send you, Little Tan, to investigate the truth of the situation! My venerable self is really smart, ha ha ha!"</p>

    <p>Tan Qian broke out in a sweat. "...That might not be the case, chief. According to my investigation, the family that lives in that villa is very ordinary."</p>

    <p>"I don't care! In monitoring the game space this time, apart from that Luo Chuang's metalware shop, the only other place we sent a USB to was this villa... Even if it has nothing to do with this family, it might be connected to their relatives. This is the only lead we have for now!"</p>

    <p>The eastern branch chief directly waved his hands. "This time, I'll go and investigate it myself! It's better to kill them all than let the one we want escape!"</p>

    <p>Tan Qian: "..." Chief, you really don't want to think twice about it?</p>

    <p>"As long as my venerable self is the first to find a lead and report to Master, my promotion to Immortal Mansion's top level as an elder won't be far off." The eastern branch chief looked at Tan Qian and patted him on the shoulder. "Once I've been promoted as an elder, Little Tan... you'll be the next eastern branch chief!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>In his heart, Tan Qian sighed deeply.</p>

    <p>He had to report this matter to Lord Diulei first.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was June 26th on Sunday in the ninth week of the semester.</p>

    <p>In the morning, Lord Diulei arrived at the door with fresh broccoli.</p>

    <p>The old man was at the entrance watering the plants, a smile on his face. Yesterday, he had specially gone to the noodles shop run by Fang Xing's family, and had been able to swap pointers on cooking.</p>

    <p>The old man had always been very ardent in pursuing culinary excellence, and he was naturally delighted to have encountered someone whom he could compare notes with; when he thought about it, he couldn't help but feel happy.</p>

    <p>"Old Senior Wang, morning!" Lord Diulei greeted him reverently.</p>

    <p>"Yo! Is it Little Lei? Have you had breakfast?" The old man raised the garden hose in his hand and responded warmly.</p>

    <p>"Mm, I have, Old Senior Wang!" Lord Diulei laughed. "I saw senior laughing, what's made you so happy?"</p>

    <p>"Yesterday I went to Ling Ling's classmate's place. His family runs a noodles shop, and his father is pretty good at cooking, so we swapped pointers."</p>

    <p>The old man stroked his beard as he recalled solemnly, "I heard that his father had already become a top-grade chef by the time he turned thirteen, but he usually covers his medal of honor with a white cloth. When I went over yesterday, an apprentice next to his father accidentally uncovered it as he was walking past, and I saw the glorious radiance of that special word 'Masterchef'... tch, so awesome!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>"Anyway, why is Little Lei here today?" the old man asked.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei bowed and cupped his fists. "I'm looking for Brother Ling, is he in?"</p>

    <p>"It's the weekend, of course he's home," the old man replied. "But it seems that Ling Ling's shut himself inside his room today, and hasn't come out."</p>

    <p>"Has Brother Ling gone into seclusion?" Lord Diulei clicked his tongue. Something like seclusion was mainly for consolidating one's realm or breaking through to another. For Wang Ling to go into seclusion was actually quite rare; was Brother Ling about to advance another level again?</p>

    <p>But Lord Diulei very quickly dismissed this notion. Looking at Grandfather Wang, he asked, "Does senior know what's going on with Brother Ling?"</p>

    <p>"He seems to be conversing with Jingke," Grandfather Wang replied. "There's one day every month when Ling Ling shuts himself in his room to have a heart-to-heart with Jingke."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Lord Diulei immediately widened his eyes and asked in fascination, "Brother Ling... can have a heart-to-heart talk?" No one could blame him for being so shocked. After all, for Ling Zhenren to speak at all was so rare that it was almost a miracle. In Lord Diulei's eyes, the probability of such a thing happening was almost as low as a sow climbing a tree!</p>

    <p>"But Ling Ling's way of conversing is very strange; he just holds Jingke without speaking." On this topic, the old man also had his own concerns. "His father and mother have been worrying that Ling Ling might have some sort of mental problem... Little Lei, you're resourceful, do you know a way to find out what Ling Ling and Little Jingzi are talking about?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei's face instantly showed a touch of embarrassment; he had yet to learn advanced spells like the Mind-Reading Ability.</p>

    <p>But very quickly, he had an idea. "Old Senior Wang, just a minute, I'm going to call my friend!"</p>

    <p>He took out his phone and made a call directly across the mountains and seas to Little Black's laboratory on the border. "Hello? Little Black? Can you lend me the mind-reading software you developed the last time for a bit? Yes... I'm in a hurry, can you just send it to my phone?"</p>

    <p>On the other end of the call, Little Black was obviously a little hesitant. "But Brother Lei, the software is currently still in the testing stage..."</p>

    <p>"Are you saying that this software doesn't work?" Lord Diulei smiled knowingly.</p>

    <p>"Impossible! I was very careful in researching and developing this software. It's remotely connected to the mind-reading device in my lab, so it can translate thoughts wherever it is!"</p>

    <p>Little Black gritted his teeth. "Since Brother Lei wants to try it out, I'll send it to you now!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Roughly two minutes later, Lord Diulei saw his phone screen light up.</p>

    <p>Little Black had sent him an unknown file after remotely locating Lord Diulei's phone.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei revealed a mouth full of white teeth as he looked at Grandfather Wang with an excited face. "Senior, I have it! Let's go to Brother Ling's door and take a look!"</p>

    <p>The old man looked a little doubtful. "Will... will this work?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei opened the software and aimed his phone at the old man. After some monitoring, a string of words appeared on the software's interface: Ling Ling won't be angry, right?</p>

    <p>The old man was dumbfounded when he saw this. "It actually works!"</p>

    <p>"Of course!" Lord Diulei was full of confidence.</p>

    <p>They walked up to the second floor and stopped in front of Wang Ling's room door. It was very quiet inside, without the slightest sound to be heard.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei aimed his phone at the door.</p>

    <p>Because the software had detected two sets of fluctuations, it used the codes "A" and "B" to distinguish between the people inside. "A" was Wang Ling, and "B" Jingke.</p>

    <p>The old man curiously moved closer. "What does it say?"</p>

    <p>After about a minute, the analysis of three sets of dialogue came out.</p>

    <p>A (Wang Ling): "..."</p>

    <p>B (Jingke): "..."</p>

    <p>A (Wang Ling): "..."</p>

    <p>B (Jingke): "..."</p>

    <p>A (Wang Ling): "..."</p>

    <p>B (Jingke): "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Grandfather Wang: "What're they talking about?"</p>

    <p>Reading this, Lord Diulei just wanted to smash his phone. "This is a conversation between immortals..."</p>
