  <h1>Chapter 698 General Yi's Probe</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This wasn't the head of state's first time dropping by the villa, but he knew absolutely nothing about Wang Ling. Wang Ling's room was right in front of Father Wang's study, but the head of state had never entered it.</p>

    <p>However, he had seen a photo before; it was the only undoctored photo of Wang Ling, which was kept in a drawer in Father Wang's study. Even if the head had never seen Wang Ling in person, this photo wouldn't be turned into a bunch of pixels by the "Great Shielding Spell." This photo had been specially prepared for the head of state. Whenever he came, all the gremlins in the Wang family's small villa would enter sleep mode in case the head noticed something fishy.</p>

    <p>Hm, from the photo, this was indeed a very average-looking, ordinary high school student.</p>

    <p>This was the head of state's first impression of Wang Ling after seeing his photo.</p>

    <p>Entering the study, he directly sat down in the chair next to Father Wang; this chair had initially been put out for Lie Mengmeng, but he hadn't come today.</p>

    <p>Of course, Lie Mengmeng had no idea at all that the chair he always used was the same one that the head of state did.</p>

    <p>In Father Wang's eyes, this chair was now very valuable.</p>

    <p>If the head of state ate a vegetable steamed bun, this could translate to the launch of a head of state set meal which would be several times more expensive. This chair had become an even more culturally significant collector's item. There were now plenty of chairs identical to this one in the villa's basement, all of which the head of state had sat on before. Every time he came, Father Wang would replace the chair with a new one...</p>

    <p>"Brother Situ? Is Little Wang Ling alright?" the head of state directly asked not long after he sat down. "If you're having a tough time, you must tell me, and I'll have someone make some arrangements."</p>

    <p>"What kind of arrangements?"</p>

    <p>"For example, a psychologist? Do you know Minister Luo?" said the head of state.</p>

    <p>Father Wang broke out in a sweat on the spot.</p>

    <p>How could he not know Minister Luo? This was one of the Ten Founding Generals and also the Medicine Saint...</p>

    <p>"No need..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang laughed and scratched the back of his head. "Thank you for Your Excellency's concern. His mental state is pretty good and he went to school this morning after getting up."</p>

    <p>"Really? Looks like Little Wang Ling's mentality is pretty good! He's very strong at resisting pressure!" The head also laughed. "Nowadays, young people need to live with pressure if they want to get anywhere. Looks like Little Wang Ling definitely has a bright future!"</p>

    <p>"Hahaha! Your Excellency, you flatter him! His grades are just so-so!"</p>

    <p>"Also, when will you be done with that singer who stole your song previously?"</p>

    <p>This was beyond Father Wang's expectations as he realized that the head of state was still pretty concerned about this matter.</p>

    <p>In fact, the head had sent Father Wang a private message before to ask him about it, because some time ago, he had been pissed off by a music-cutting whiz called "Li Yuanjie <sup>1</sup> ," who had plagiarized several melodies and crammed them together in a song.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Worth noting here that this is
a direct mention of a real case,
as it'll pop up again in a later
chapter ..)</dfn>

    <p>"There's no rush, we're now heating up the water to boil the frog, and we're planning to slowly cook him to death. Fans are regularly entering his live stream room daily to demolish it and ferret out his deeds."</p>

    <p>"Mm, he has to pay for what he's done sooner or later." The head of state nodded. "When it comes to internal affairs, as long as it isn't against the law or unethical, and it's nothing that crosses the line, I can help Brother Situ sort out everything neatly!"</p>

    <p>Saying this, the head gave a thumbs-up and grinned.</p>

    <p>"Alright..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang was overwhelmed by this favor.</p>

    <p>Once again, he couldn't help sighing emotionally in his heart.</p>

    <p>To have the head of state as a fan was truly a good thing; he could make the arrangements and everything would be sorted...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Around lunchtime at noon, Father Wang and the head of state were eating in the dining room. Mother Wang had prepared a table full of home cooking.</p>

    <p>The Wang family's small villa received a phone call from the "Poverty Relief Foundation."</p>

    <p>From the other end came the sweet voice of the customer service lady. "May I ask if this is Student Wang Ling's parent?"</p>

    <p>Mother Wang: "That's right, may I ask what's the matter?"</p>

    <p>"It's like this. We noticed that a month ago, Student Wang Ling accepted charity aid and asked for crispy noodle snacks."</p>

    <p>Mother Wang: "..."</p>

    <p>"Student Wang Ling was in perpetual danger recently, and the leaders of the Poverty Relief Foundation are highly concerned. They have thus decided to pay a visit in person to express their sympathies as well as to present you with double... the crispy noodle snacks." When she said this, the customer service lady already couldn't help dropping her forehead in her hand. What kind of weird relief aid was this!</p>

    <p>Mother Wang: "Ah... then may I ask when the leaders will come?"</p>

    <p>"Please hold, let me check the time."</p>

    <p>Mother Wang was actually bewildered when she listened to this on the phone. She knew about the Poverty Relief Foundation, but she had never expected the foundation to give them a call at this time, and even less that it would draw their leaders' attention enough to pay them a visit.</p>

    <p>After all, their family had indeed received this "relief aid," so Mother Wang felt that it wouldn't be very proper to directly reject them.</p>

    <p>"Is this afternoon a convenient time?"</p>

    <p>"So soon?" Mother Wang was startled.</p>

    <p>After she hung up, Father Wang raised his head and asked, "Who was it?"</p>

    <p>"It was the Poverty Relief Foundation. They said that a leader would be coming here this afternoon."</p>

    <p>"Did you confirm their identity? It's not a swindler, is it?" Father Wang frowned.</p>

    <p>"This is a government organization. If someone dares pretend to be from the foundation, I'll definitely sort them out." The head of state chuckled.</p>

    <p>Father Wang and Mother Wang: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At noon, General Yi brought the supplies with him as he personally left for the Wang family's small villa; he had a strong feeling that the puppeteer behind this entire affair was in this villa...</p>

    <p>Moreover, before he could get close, he already sensed an unusual aura inside the villa.</p>

    <p>The supply van carrying the crispy noodle snacks followed closely behind General Yi's car. In the passenger seat, General Yi looked into the distance and sent out his spiritual senses.</p>

    <p>He was one hundred percent certain that there was an expert inside this villa... furthermore, this person wasn't any less powerful than he was, and even surpassed him!</p>

    <p>Who on earth was it?</p>

    <p>General Yi acknowledged that he was in no way the most powerful in Huaxiu nation, but he ranked in the top ten in terms of overall battle strength; he could count on his fingers those who were stronger than him. Of course, he couldn't eliminate the possibility that there were some cultivation experts in the dark that he didn't know about.</p>

    <p>Finally, was everything going to come to light?</p>

    <p>He narrowed his eyes, highly curious about the identities of the people in the villa.</p>

    <p>When they approached the Wang family's small villa, he ordered the driver, "Stop the car. I'll take a look around first."</p>

    <p>He had the driver stop his car fifty meters from the villa and he got out. The moment the car door opened, General Yi straightaway put his hands behind his back and floated over.</p>

    <p>"Let me see who on earth you are..."</p>

    <p>He floated at the entrance to the Wang family's small villa and directly sent out his spirit senses in a probe.</p>

    <p>Although this was a probe, a clash in spiritual senses between cultivators was the most direct way of sounding out the other party. It was similar to two people shaking hands when they met and competing to see whose grip was stronger; it was the most direct reflection of basic strength.</p>

    <p>Inside the villa, the head of state was absorbed in reading Father Wang's draft when he suddenly felt a chill on his back. This was the feeling of a probe with spiritual senses.</p>

    <p>The head was taken aback. "???"</p>

    <p>Someone was actually feeling out this place?</p>

    <p><em>Heh...</em></p>

    <p><em>You have guts.</em></p>
