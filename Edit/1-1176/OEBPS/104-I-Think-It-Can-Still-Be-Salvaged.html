  <h1>Chapter 104 I Think It Can Still Be Salvaged... </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Half an hour later, Mother Wang had cleared away the dishes on the table and only put a few of the ones that Wang Ling liked into a lunchbox in the kitchen. After the old man and Father Wang chatted with Student Lei Mouren for a short while longer, both of them went upstairs. Father Wang had to rush his manuscript, while the old man couldn't help feeling sleepy given his advanced age and especially after eating, which was when one always felt lazy.</p>

    <p>Since retiring, Old Man Wang had had little opportunity to meet any cultivators. He had always been very curious about this group of people; he had often heard people say that there were times when cultivators often just needed a little luck in order to achieve enlightenment and there were times when it just took a bit of creative inspiration to achieve a promotion in realms... but Old Man Wang had never imagined that the broccoli and tomato egg drop soup which he had cooked could actually have the same effect!</p>

    <p>Before he left, Old Man Wang patted Student Lei Mouren on the shoulder three times when he saw the bemused expression on the other man's face. He had seen this before. When he had been a head chef previously, he had heard a lot of cultivation stories, and a number of them had been about cultivators who, in the course of trying to achieve enlightenment, became possessed by the devil in a moment of inattention, and ended up losing their realms...</p>

    <p>He gave Lord Diulei three pats on the shoulder as a reminder to Student Lei Mouren to not think too much, in case he experienced an inner deviation...</p>

    <p>However, Lei Mouren suddenly stood ramrod straight again, as if he had been electrocuted. "Thank you for your advice, great senior! This junior will definitely come to you for direction at sangeng !"</p>

    <p>Old Man Wang: "..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..." What fucking direction! He's not Master Puti <sup>1</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(In the Chinese classic 'Journey to the West,' Sun Wukong was knocked three times on the head by Master Puti as a reminder to go to his place for instruction at 'sangeng' (the time between 11pm and 1am).)</dfn>

    <p>When Wang Ling arrived home, he saw a man in white with his arms crossed and head lowered, staring solemnly at a broccoli and a bowl of completely cold tomato egg drop soup.</p>

    <p>Er Ha told Wang Ling that the man had already been in this position for a whole hour...</p>

    <p>Both Father Wang and the old man were already upstairs, leaving Mother Wang to accompany Lei Mouren. The latter had stared at the broccoli and tomato egg drop soup the whole time and hadn't said a word, which had discomfited her greatly.</p>

    <p>Seeing that Wang Ling had finally returned, Mother Wang looked like someone grasping at a straw to be saved. "Ling Ling, do you think Little Lei might have depression?"</p>

    <p>He gazed at the man for a while in silence. "..."</p>

    <p>This... was clearly an epileptic fit!</p>

    <p>Then, without saying a word, he pulled on Student Lei Mouren's collar and straightaway dragged the man upstairs.</p>

    <p>When Mother Wang saw Lord Diulei being dragged upstairs, she was secretly relieved in her heart and began to clear the leftovers from the table.</p>

    <p>As Lord Diulei was being dragged up the stairs by Wang Ling, he watched helplessly as Mother Wang poured the tomato egg drop soup down the sink and immediately screamed, "No! My tomato egg drop soup! What a miserable death!</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling! I think my tomato egg drop soup can still be salvaged... as long as you leave with me now, we can intercept it at the sewage plant before it flows into the Frozen Sea!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Okay, Brother Ling... I know I'm exaggerating a bit. But at the very least, please leave me the broccoli that great senior picked for me... I want to make it into a collector's item!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling hadn't seen Lord Diulei in a long time, he felt that the man's niaoxing <sup>2</sup> really hadn't changed. To describe it in one phrase, he seemed more mentally unhinged.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Niaoxing literally translates into 'urine character,' and while it can be an offensive term, it is also used to describe someone who is awesome or cool for doing something extraordinary ..)</dfn>

    <p>In his bedroom, Wang Ling took out a square sandalwood box from under his bed. He usually used this box to store the previous versions of the Dao talisman seals. Including the one that had just been replaced, there were five in total.</p>

    <p>While the strength of the talismans had decreased too much to be of use to Wang Ling, they were otherwise still effective. He had placed the stone ghost mask together with these Dao talismans so that the strength of the mask's curse would be restrained to some extent.</p>

    <p>"Is this the stone ghost mask?" When Wang Ling took the mask out of the box, the man in white next to him was surprised.</p>

    <p>The rumored stone ghost mask was older than he had thought; it had mysterious colored eyes, cold and sinister hooks, and the mild discoloration that showed how old it was... if the man in white hadn't seen it with his own eyes, he really wouldn't have been able to see so many details, not by relying on just several pictures of the object on the Internet.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei stared at the mask for quite a long while, then suddenly realized a terrible problem and turned to Wang Ling abruptly. "Brother Ling, did you put it on?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded his head and then conveyed that he hadn't felt very much of anything after putting on the mask, so then he had taken it off.</p>

    <p>"...Brother Ling, are you saying that you took it off?!"</p>

    <p>Something occurred to the man in white, and he drew in a sharp breath. "Taking this stone ghost mask and the results of my investigation over the last few years into account, I can basically confirm that this mask is genuine. But I just realized something; I thought that the hooks on both sides of the stone ghost mask were a bit crooked... at first I thought that it was a fake or it was a defect in the workmanship, but judging from what Brother Ling has said..."</p>

    <p>What are you talking about?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was a little puzzled as he looked at the man.</p>

    <p>"Simply put, when Brother Ling tried wearing the stone ghost mask previously, it actually was already going to possess your body. Furthermore, from written accounts, the way it possesses someone is by piercing the face with its hooks..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"But it's very obvious that this stone ghost mask failed to do so..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, Lord Diulei couldn't help sighing. "The thickness of Brother Ling's skin... this humble person is really too inferior!"</p>

    <p>"..." Motherfucker!</p>

    <p>"In any case, it will be very troublesome for Brother Ling if this stone ghost mask remains with you. What about giving it to me? Brother, I will definitely deal with this mask properly," Lord Diulei pledged as he thumped his chest.</p>

    <p>Hearing the man's words, Wang Ling was lost in deep thought for a short while. Compared with the scheming, unsavory organization that was Landscape Manor, Wang Ling certainly would rather believe this brother whose immortal fate was aligned with his at a rate as high as seventy percent. But nowadays, everything was a trade... Wang Ling felt that he also couldn't afford to suffer a loss here.</p>

    <p>After a short silence, the man in white received Wang Ling's telepathic message and was surprised. "What? Attend a meeting? Brother Ling, are you saying that you'll give me the mask as long as I attend a meeting for you?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded solemnly.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, that's very kind of you... that is such a trivial thing, you don't even need to use the stone ghost mask as a condition. As long as you say so, I will definitely come! But then again... you haven't mentioned, what is this meeting about?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling smiled slightly, and then put a notification about the parent-teacher conference at Number 60 High School into the man's hand.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>
