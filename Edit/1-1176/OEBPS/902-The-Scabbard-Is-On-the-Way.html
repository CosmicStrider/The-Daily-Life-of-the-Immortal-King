  <h1>Chapter 902 The Scabbard Is On the Way</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling acted quickly to get rid of Pen Fairy at midnight on the dot, dumbfounding all the exorcists in the exorcism competition. They already saw that Boss Jin had tremendous momentum this year, and now that Mr Fang wasn't taking part, Boss Jin indeed could potentially rank in the top three. But the competition had barely begun and he had already eliminated the biggest boss Pen Fairy... Everyone was caught off guard.</p>

    <p>This Pen Fairy was a malicious ghost that had a reputation all these years of being the most difficult ghost to find!</p>

    <p>Did that mean that the other side had already long confirmed Pen Fairy's position, and had hung around waiting for the competition to start before getting rid of it?</p>

    <p>Everyone had yet to recover from their astonishment when there was yet another system announcement from the exorcism center: "Team Jin Ke has broken the record for the quickest top-ranked devil kill, and earns two hundred thousand points. The kill time from the official start of the competition was 0.0001 seconds (Note: the last record was 12:21:44). This is a genuine and valid kill. All exorcists are welcome to try and break the record."</p>

    <p>After looking at this record, the exorcists leading teams all over Huaxiu nation threw their compasses and exorcism magic artifacts to the ground with a "pia.""Fuck! Are you kidding me?! 0.0001 seconds! How the fuck are we supposed to break this record?!"</p>

    <p>At the top of the exorcism center, the president Yang Hu was working in his office. The giant screen in front of him had various red dots on it which were the exorcists that had gone out to hunt devils all over the country.</p>

    <p>When news of Boss Jin's kill arrived, President Yang Hua was also bewildered... That was too fast! Plus, there was no possibility of cheating at all!</p>

    <p>"President, I've investigated the profiles of Boss Jin's team members," said the female secretary standing next to Yang Hua. She had just looked up some information. "The identities and backgrounds of these four people are all very ordinary. One of them is a minor. As for further details, we're still verifying the information..."</p>

    <p>The fact was that when he had submitted the information, Zhuo Yi hadn't used their real identities for fear of stirring up trouble. Only the ages given in the information were real, so that their fake identities looked more genuine. Zhuo Yi had intentionally retained Wang Ling's age, which meant that the team had a minor.</p>

    <p>"You can look up the minor."</p>

    <p>The female secretary: "The youngster's surname is Gan and his given name is Cui <sup>1</sup> ."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(i.e. "gan cui mian" or "dry and crispy noodles.")</dfn>

    <p>Yang Hua was blank. "Why is it that surname? How is he connected to Gan Jiang <sup>2</sup> ?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Gan Jiang and his wife Mo Ye
are a swordsmith couple in
Chinese literature ..)</dfn>

    <p>The female secretary: "This, we don't know..."</p>

    <p>"Alright... Look deeper into it then. If there really isn't any information, give Boss Jin a call directly and ask for details. This is very important for us. The prize pool for our exorcism competition this year is bigger than ever since I have to find a powerful exorcist to do one thing for me..."</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, Yang Hua fell silent.</p>

    <p>The appearance of Boss Jin's team had given him new hope.</p>

    <p>The female secretary nodded. "Very well, Sir President, I'll go and do that now."</p>

    <p>Yang Hua said, "Mm... make sure to be discreet about it. Huaxiu Alliance must never know about this..."</p>

    <p>The female secretary: "Yes! This subordinate will definitely be careful!"</p>

    <p>In front of the huge French windows, Yang Hu sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>A while ago, because of the exorcism center's negligence, the seal on a million-year-old devil had accidentally come loose.</p>

    <p>And now, this devil would reappear in the world in a few days...</p>

    <p>Time was running out for President Yang.</p>

    <p>If Huaxiu Alliance found out about this, his position as president of the exorcism center would be in jeopardy.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, in Boss Jin's shop, he received congratulatory calls and texts from countless people.</p>

    <p>"Old Jin! Who on earth did you recruit for your team? Can you tell me? Or how about we cooperate next year? If you're looking for someone to invest in your shop, I'm your man!"</p>

    <p>"Dear Old Jin! Congratulations on killing Pen Fairy! Now that I'm asking sincerely, can you sincerely tell me who on earth is in your team?"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In a split second, Boss Jin received a little over a hundred texts, the contents of which were pretty much the same as they all asked about his teammates and offered congratulations in passing.</p>

    <p>Boss Jin sighed and thought about how this was the way the world worked.</p>

    <p>Previously, when he couldn't keep his Shop Number 83 open for much longer, he had asked everyone in his contact list one by one if he could borrow money, but these people never replied... Now that his situation had changed, they too suddenly changed their minds.</p>

    <p>"Boss Jin, aren't you going to reply?" Zhuo Yi asked.</p>

    <p>After news of that kill went out, he saw Boss Jin's phone enter guichu mode as the texts came in non-stop and the screen flashed incessantly.</p>

    <p>Boss Jin was clearly a little upset when he saw these messages and he directly turned off his phone.</p>

    <p>"Many thanks to all of you for this."</p>

    <p>Boss Jin said to Zhuo Yi and the others, "The other two devils ranked second and third..."</p>

    <p>"Is Boss Jin talking about Man-Eating Dove and Lemon Gremlin?" Fang Xing smiled. "Our second and third teams have already pinpointed their locations."</p>

    <p>"So soon..."</p>

    <p>"Most of these devils are souls; as long as you're strong enough, you don't need to use a magic compass to locate them. You can just sit at home and determine their approximate location through their auras, and then go look around for them."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Besides, Man-Eating Dove and Lemon Gremlin aren't strong - they're only at the Soul Formation stage. If it wasn't for this team-building activity this time, we normally wouldn't bother with these small hobgoblins."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Saying this, Fang Xing glanced at a text, then looked up and said, "Mm, it's confirmed; our sect head says that a lot of exorcists are now searching high and low for these two devils. He wants us to wait a while before taking action, so that we don't ruin the game for them and destroy their mindsets."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>The mouths of Boss Jin and his shop assistant Ling Huan dropped open when they heard this.</p>

    <p>This group of people...</p>

    <p>Who on earth were they?</p>

    <p>Initially, they had already thought that this Zhuo Yi, Director of the General Administration of 100 Schools, was ridiculously strong - they never expected this Director Zhuo's friends to also be all so formidable.</p>

    <p>Coming back to his senses, Boss Jin wiped his sweat. "In any case, I still have to thank everyone... Also, I've already texted the scabbard that you're looking for, and she's on her way over."</p>

    <p>"Boss Jin, what... do you mean?"</p>

    <p>"Actually, I haven't told you: that peach wood sword scabbard also spawned an artifact spirit. She's a very beautiful girl, and I've been raising her as my daughter all this time."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>"Little Scabbard is already on her way, and you'll see her soon. She's usually more of a shut-in, and she only agreed to come over when I promised I would buy her a game with my winnings."</p>

    <p>Everyone and Wang Ling: "..."</p>
