  <h1>Chapter 687 Wang Ling's Warning</h1>

  <div>

    <p>That afternoon, Zhuo Yi was in his office, feeling gloomy.</p>

    <p>He had been answering phone calls all morning from "enthusiastic citizens" who were mainly complaining about the Number 60 High issue. A lot of these enthusiastic citizens didn't understand why Number 60 High wasn't on holiday today and was carrying on with classes.</p>

    <p>Although there was no movement with regard to the Demon Hunters Association's revenge plan, this was a gang of crafty hoodlums! God knew what kind of sick things they would do to kids... Nowadays, there were many cases of these psychopaths causing injuries!</p>

    <p>For example, there was a scumbag some time ago who should be struck by lightning for stabbing two primary school children on their way to school. This kind of person should be cut to pieces and go to hell, his soul never to be reincarnated! Why attack kids... If you can, go attack Ling Zhenren!</p>

    <p>When Zhuo Yi read this news, he had been utterly furious.</p>

    <p>So it actually wasn't as if he couldn't understand when it came to this matter, but a lot of the time, suspending classes wasn't up to him alone... Conversely, when you held a high position, there were times when you were actually more limited in what you could do, and you had to be prudent in how you handled each matter.</p>

    <p>The reason why Number 60 High hadn't suspended classes this time was a combination of various factors. While Zhuo Yi didn't know exactly what factors Headmaster Chen and the higher-ups had taken into account before they made this decision, Headmaster Chen had never made a wrong decision when it came to Number 60 High... And this indeed was the reality: the overseas returnee elites of the Demon Hunters Association had announced that they would be getting their revenge in the morning, but it was now the afternoon with not even a shadow to be seen.</p>

    <p>"Brother Zhuo, it seems like there's no movement?" The director and the deputy director shared the same office space. Zhong Lang looked at the time, then poked his head out to ask Zhuo Yi the question.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi shrugged and spread his hands. "No idea..."</p>

    <p>He didn't know what the situation was.</p>

    <p>But for some reason, he could feel a massive shadow slowly covering him; he had a very strong premonition that it was ultimately going to directly turn into a wok on his head...</p>

    <p>Just as Zhuo Yi's thoughts were running wild, his phone suddenly vibrated...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi looked at the caller ID.</p>

    <p>It was Secretary Dakang calling...</p>

    <p>"No way, right?" The corner of Zhuo Yi's lips twitched, and he picked up the phone.</p>

    <p>From the other end of the line came the old secretary's wholehearted praise. "Little Zhuozi! Beautifully done!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>What... What did he do this time?</p>

    <p>Secretary Dakang: "We discovered the bodies of the Demon Hunters Association overseas returnee elites in an area of mountain forest, including the Elder Ji Xing who organized the plan! He's now the only one who survived! That overseas returnee team of elites from the Demon Hunters Association has already been wiped out! Tell me the truth, was it that old shifu behind you who took action again?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Old secretary, I..."</p>

    <p>"Don't deny it, I can tell right away that this was a setup!"</p>

    <p>Secretary Dakang: "If that senior expert is willing to come out and meet me, he's welcome anytime. He's helped us out so much, after all!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Then now..."</p>

    <p>Secretary Dakang: "Why are you still spacing out now? Hurry up and hold a press conference. The overseas returnee team of elites from the Demon Hunters Association was completely eliminated this time, I want to see what that bunch online have to say about that."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The Demon Hunters Association's grand plan for their overseas returnee elites to attack Number 60 High ultimately came to an end with almost all of them dead, except for two people: One was Elder Ji Xing, who was struggling painfully, while the other was Elder Yaren who had already been captured earlier, and who was at the stage of twitchy revival.</p>

    <p>These were the top two experts among the overseas returnee elites this time, yet even then they had both already completely lost the ability to fight, and wouldn't be able to participate in any battles any time soon.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High was still tranquil at noon, which was when Uncle Qiu prepared to close up his pancake stall. Just as he was about to leave with the cart, a customer with a snow-white face and carrying a black umbrella appeared all of a sudden. The customer's aura was so gloomy and cold that even the stove on the pancake cart seemed to cool down a few degrees as he drew near.</p>

    <p>The small black umbrella covered half the newcomer's face, so Uncle Qiu didn't have a full view of it.</p>

    <p>Uncle Qiu raised his eyebrows and then sighed in his heart. "Sir... I don't have enough batter, and can only make one last pancake. Do you want crackers or youtiao? My pancake ingredients aren't as fresh by noon, but if you still want them, I can give you a cheaper price..."</p>

    <p>The man under the black umbrella said quietly, "Youtiao."</p>

    <p>It was succinct and to the point, without any unnecessary words.</p>

    <p>"Alright." Uncle Qiu nodded and began to make a pancake.</p>

    <p>When he cracked open an egg, Uncle Qiu couldn't help sighing with feeling. "It really is peaceful today."</p>

    <p>The man under the black umbrella listened to him silently.</p>

    <p>"To be a person is just like making this pancake: whether you're adding sweet or spicy sauce, you ultimately have to be careful when you make your choice. There are some places you can provoke and some you can't..." At this point, Uncle Qiu was done making the pancake, and he then expertly wrapped it in oilpaper. "Here you are, young man, your pancake."</p>

    <p>This customer with the black umbrella stared at the pancake without moving for a long time. He watched as Uncle Qiu left, pushing the cart down to the end of the road...</p>

    <p>Under the black umbrella, President Bai was utterly stupefied.</p>

    <p>He had stood there unmoving for a long time not because he was reflecting on something, but because a powerful aura had held him in place... He hadn't been able to move at all!</p>

    <p>Could it be that this Number 60 High really was full of hidden dragons and crouching tigers?</p>

    <p>Even the uncle selling pancakes at the gate was so frightening?</p>

    <p>President Bai narrowed his eyes and started to weigh the stakes.</p>

    <p>Then he lowered his head to take a bite of the pancake in his hand...</p>

    <p>Hm...</p>

    <p>It was overcooked...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the window of Grade One, Class Three, Wang Ling relaxed inwardly as his pupils refocused. That Great Soul Transformation Spell just now was a technique for attaching his soul to another person. He had used Uncle Qiu's body to give President Bai a warning. Although he couldn't be sure that it made an impact, it could be said that this was Wang Ling's "ultimatum" this time.</p>

    <p>Mother Wang had taught him to be a polite child since young, to try talking things out first before resorting to violence! Wang Ling felt that his warning just now... could be considered quite polite!</p>

    <p>But whether President Bai understood his meaning in the end was another matter...</p>
