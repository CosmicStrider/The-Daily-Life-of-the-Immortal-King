  <h1>Chapter 333 The Great Ancestor of Killers </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Killer Taoist: "In assassination circles, One Thousand Years of Death is recognized as the most powerful assassination technique to use in close combat. If you use it just right, this technique can kill an enemy in one strike... But it also has a drawback; it's hard to find an opportunity to use it, and in most situations, it needs to be paired with the use of soap."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>The baldie said solemnly, "Of course, apart from this high-level assassination Taoist technique, Numinous Mother also introduced many original things in the field of assassination. My shifu and shishu learned most of what they know from her."</p>

    <p>"Have you met her before?" asked Er Ha.</p>

    <p>"No." The baldie shook his head. "Only shifu and shishu have ever seen her original form, and she comes and goes like the wind; only those at epic level are able to see her. Given my current realm, I probably need to cultivate for one thousand years more to catch up to my shifu and shishu before I can see her... This is one of the biggest regrets in my life.</p>

    <p>"However, I was lucky enough to read Great Ancestor's original Self-Cultivation for Assassins . Great Ancestor wrote this in exercise books, and there are ten of them in total, filled with her neat handwriting. It was my shifu who showed them to me! But the originals all disappeared in the end. It was said that Great Ancestor confiscated them!"</p>

    <p>The baldie sighed. "At that time, shifu only let me take a look for thirty seconds, but I really benefited even just from reading the title page alone. Great Ancestor is indeed Great Ancestor, so awesome!"</p>

    <p>Even without Killer Taoist's explanation, Wang Ling could imagine how powerful this Numinous Mother was. According to the strict ranking system in assassination circles, gaining the rank of legendary killer was as difficult as scaling the heights to heaven, while epic killers like Gorgeous Itinerant and Taotie Taoist only appeared once every ten thousand years.</p>

    <p>Rank among killers wasn't based on credentials but on true competence. In fact, Killer Taoist didn't have as many abilities as some of the top killers in the list, but he had a renowned shifu . Coupled with his innate talent, he managed to climb to the rank of legendary killer despite his youth, and became the new guardian envoy of the list.</p>

    <p>As the only great ancestral killer in the assassination world, needless to say, Numinous Mother with the Magic Hands had to be truly formidable.</p>

    <p>The crucial thing was that this name felt a little familiar to Wang Ling, who didn't know where he might have heard it before.</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, the baldie couldn't help sighing. "My shifu and shishu were truly lucky to pick up that ancestral martial arts text."</p>

    <p>Er Ha was startled again. "They picked this up?"</p>

    <p>"That's right." The baldie nodded. "There was a sentence on the title page of that text — Whoever finds this book is deemed to have joined Numinous Mother's sect ."</p>

    <p>The corners of Wang Ling's lips couldn't help twitching when he heard this. "..." Did masters nowadays all recruit disciples this casually?</p>

    <p>"My shifu and shishu' s luck was truly extraordinary," the baldie said. "Although I became a legendary killer at a young age, it's not that great being an assassin nowadays. Look at my hair loss; no matter how many elixirs I use, it won't grow back. If I had known earlier, I would have started using Bawang shampoo <sup>1</sup> long ago."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The shampoo brand that Jackie Chan used to endorse, one of which claims anti-hair fall ..)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "...So why are you here?"</p>

    <p>Hearing this question, the baldie suddenly patted his head; after blathering on for so long, he had almost forgotten his business for being here!</p>

    <p>Hands on his knees, he stared at Wang Ling. "This Shuigou Sect incident stems from resentment between two epic-level killers, and as a junior, I have no power to persuade them... so I hope that Ling Zhenren can mediate this conflict for us!"</p>

    <p>After that, he got to his feet to prostrate himself before Wang Ling. "Please! Ling Zhenren!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>This was an assassination circle matter, and Wang Ling didn't actually want to get tangled up in it at all. However, this Shuigou Sect incident had still impacted his peaceful high school life recently, so Wang Ling was of two minds about getting involved.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "What's in it for us?"</p>

    <p>At this time, the baldie laughed, and with a flash of spirit light, a gold card appeared in his hand. "Ling Zhenren, do you know the old crispy noodle snacks flagship store on Spirit Creek Road? This is its gold card, and it's good for one hundred years. Apart from being able to try the latest crispy noodle snack flavor every month, you can go in every week and eat as much as you want until you're full!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "!!!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>And so... Wang Ling happily decided to take part in this endeavor.</p>

    <p>He felt that he had given it serious consideration; furthermore, he had made this decision after three rounds of deep thought... Mm, he hadn't been sloppy about it at all!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Mother Wang and the old man had already returned home, and were cooking in the kitchen by the time the baldie was about to leave; right up until he got to the front door, he didn't have the courage to go greet the old man. Wang Ling felt that with every new visitor to the Wang family's small villa, their impression of the old man had continued to build until he had now become thoroughly deified...</p>

    <p>First time stranger, second time friends — he would have the opportunity next time!</p>

    <p>As he was leaving, the baldie consoled himself with this thought.</p>

    <p>"I will have to trouble Ling Zhenren with this matter... If you truly can't mediate, it's fine to just beat them up and teach them a lesson, especially my shishu — if you can beat him until he's paralyzed, even better! He's ugly anyway; he shouldn't be going out to scare people." When he said this, the baldie looked like he was screwing up immense courage, and his face and tone were slightly dejected when he said, "...I'll look after him for the rest of his life after that!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had heard a lot of rumors about Taotie Taoist in these two days, and he was curious to know exactly how ugly he could be.</p>

    <p>"The resentment between the two of them wasn't something that happened in one or two days... There's something I forgot to tell Ling Zhenren. This time, it seems that my shishu has come to an agreement with Mo Immortal Castle."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded slightly; it had to said that he was very familiar with this Mo Immortal Castle... however, he had never paid attention to it since the beginning because it was so weak.</p>

    <p>In fact, it was still a little unexpected when the baldie mentioned it.</p>

    <p>"Do you know what their objective is?" asked Er Ha.</p>

    <p>"If my assumption is correct, it was Mo Immortal Castle which gave Shuigou Sect all the intelligence for its operation against the high schools this time, including information on the twelve missing students and on my shifu after he withdrew from the assassination circle. I've investigated this organization, and while its strength is average, it has a lot of gossip," the baldie said. "They were the ones who provided my shishu with leads, and in return, he'll help them retrieve a supreme weapon in my shifu' s possession."</p>

    <p>Both Wang Ling and Er Ha's expressions perked up. Gorgeous Itinerant's supreme weapon?</p>

    <p>"I've followed my shifu for so many years, but I've never heard of this supreme weapon... Surely it has to be a mistake." The baldie looked completely puzzled.</p>

    <p>After saying this, he suddenly recalled something. "Oh, that's right, there's another thing — my shifu Gorgeous Itinerant looks completely different now after retirement."</p>

    <p>As he said this, he took out a picture and thrust it into Wang Ling's hand. "This is his photo, please have a look."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling couldn't help being taken aback when he looked at the image.</p>

    <p>He couldn't be more familiar with the person in the photo... It was a fatty eating latiao !</p>
