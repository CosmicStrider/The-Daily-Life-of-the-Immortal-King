  <h1>Chapter 1066 Poor Heavenly Dao</h1>

  <div>

    <p>For some reason, the moment Tong Ling wanted to play a trick on Wang Ling, his body felt like it was in the firm grip of an external force; an evil power manipulated his body, squeezing out his spirit energy unceasingly and shooting laser beams in all directions!</p>

    <p>If this went on, Tong Ling felt that he would be drained dry very soon!</p>

    <p>The Purple Flame Beam Cannon swept over the ground and kicked up dirt. The more the chief director watched this scene on the screen, the more he felt something wasn't right.</p>

    <p>"Cut!"</p>

    <p>The director called for a stop.</p>

    <p>It was useless.</p>

    <p>It seemed as if Mr Tong Ling had gotten carried away by his ego in the sky.</p>

    <p>"Can anyone tell me what's going on?"</p>

    <p>"Mr Tong Ling seems to have lost control!"</p>

    <p>Lost control?</p>

    <p>Why would he lose control?</p>

    <p>Such a haphazard attack which completely didn't follow the script already posed a threat to some of the extras in the green safe zone.</p>

    <p>"Don't shoot us! Mr Tong Ling! Hurry up and wake up!"</p>

    <p>"Ah! My flaming biceps<sup>1</sup>!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(From the show "My Own Swordsman..")</dfn>

    <p>Someone was hit by the Purple Flame Beam Cannon! He screamed in agony!</p>

    <p>For a moment, the scene descended into chaos.</p>

    <p>No one had expected something like this to happen.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling!" Guo Hao thought of Wang Ling. He brought out his spirit sword and planned to dash over to save him.</p>

    <p>The executive director dragged him back by the arm. "Nephew! It's dangerous!"</p>

    <p>"Uncle! Think of a way to save him!" Guo Hao was distraught. He was the one who had introduced Wang Ling to this job! And Wang Ling was his most adorable deskmate! If Wang Ling died like this, where would Guo Hao find another person with such neat handwriting whom he could copy homework from?!</p>

    <p>In the smoke, Wang Ling opened his eyes slowly.</p>

    <p>It seemed that his eyelid had been warning him about Tong Ling losing control.</p>

    <p>Listening to the chaos around him, Wang Ling already confirmed that Tong Ling had lost control. Moreover, he detected a very familiar aura on Tong Ling... It was like the one that had been on Wu Yuanji and Father Zheng before.</p>

    <p>He speculated that this Mr Tong had also eaten frozen dumplings.</p>

    <p>The box of frozen dumplings which Mother Wang had returned at the time contained twelve bags...</p>

    <p>In other words, the frozen dumplings bestowed with the power of Shadow might have been bought from the discounted returns section by twelve hapless people and taken home, and they had obtained this power after eating the dumplings.</p>

    <p>Staring at Tong Ling, who was out of control, Wang Ling still lay unmoving on the ground. He could clearly sense the Purple Flame Beam Cannon's trajectory and predict what would happen in the next three hundred seconds, and he was confident that Tong Ling wouldn't hit him. At this stage, the best was for him to sit tight, since the director had said that his pay would go down if he moved.</p>

    <p>It hadn't been easy for Wang Ling to find such a relaxing job, and he didn't want to waste it just like that.</p>

    <p>Also, he had a feeling that Tong Ling was going to run out of spirit energy very soon; once his energy reserves were all used up, the attacks would stop.</p>

    <p>And so, roughly three minutes later, the site was peaceful once more.</p>

    <p>Getting up from the ground and shaking off the dirt on him, Wang Ling saw Guo Hao throw himself at him with a face full of snot and tears. "Fuck! It's great, Wang Ling! You didn't die! If you had died, who will give me their homework to copy?!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's lips twitched in disdain. "..." This was the only thing this guy was good at.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling walked out safe and sound, greatly astonishing everyone present.</p>

    <p>He had been in the red zone, which was the most dangerous and where the attacks were the most concentrated. In the end, during that moment of turmoil, he had still managed to lie as dead as a doornail on the ground... Some of the senior actors were shamed by this dedication and dropped their heads - this was something they could never learn to do!</p>

    <p>"Student Wang, you're truly amazing." Every director on site was dumbfounded. They looked at Wang Ling, who was covered in grime, and for a moment, had no words to describe what they were feeling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared silently at the director with a hopeful expression.</p>

    <p>The director couldn't resist such a "dedicated" gaze. "Student Wang, I understand... Don't worry, I'll definitely look for you the next time I film a movie! Your dedication is something we can all learn from! But Student Wang, when you have to run, you should run, understand? What if you get hurt?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed softly at the director's words.</p>

    <p>Of course it had nothing to do with dedication...</p>

    <p>The reason why he had remained lying there during the turmoil was naturally for his pay!</p>

    <p>While Wang Ling seldom spoke, Guo Hao had still come to know him somewhat after being his deskmate for over half a year.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao understood Wang Ling's meaning.</p>

    <p>"Uncle... that's not what my classmate means..."</p>

    <p>"Then??"</p>

    <p>"He wants you to pay him..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>And so, Wang Ling went home that day in high spirits, with 1200 HNY.</p>

    <p>One thousand was for Wang Ling's performance, and the director had given him an extra two hundred as compensation for mental trauma... As for the movie Birth of the Demon Child Zhuo Yi, it was impossible to continue shooting it in the short-term since there were problems with the site; when Tong Ling lost control, he had wrecked the studio's surroundings. This incident very quickly entered Weibo's list of hot searches, and there were varied opinions on the reason for Tong Ling's loss of control.</p>

    <p>The truth was that after Tong Ling had released all of his spirit energy, Wang Ling had used his Great Seal Spell to seal off the power of Shadow on Tong Ling. Like Wu Yuanji and Zheng Tianqiang, Tong Ling had obtained this power unawares, and naturally didn't know how to properly use Shadow Dao. Without seeing the might of Shadow Dao for himself, Wang Ling also wouldn't be able to learn and mimic it as he had done with Fate Dao.</p>

    <p>And because of today's incident, his unborn little sister had thoroughly captured Wang Ling's attention.</p>

    <p>Making a seal was one part of it, and Wang Ling now had enough money to do so.</p>

    <p>Of course, the other important thing was to find the remaining nine people who had accidentally eaten the frozen dumplings.</p>

    <p>This was absolutely vital.</p>

    <p>As a big brother, it was very normal to sort out a mess caused by his little sister...</p>

    <p>But given Huaxiu's large population, looking for these nine people would indeed be very difficult.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had no other choice; he could only ask the Heavenly Dao for help again.</p>

    <p>Heavenly Dao Equivalent Exchange Array...</p>

    <p>After Wang Ling drew the familiar array in his room, Er Ha circled around it excitedly.</p>

    <p>It hadn't seen the Heavenly Dao for quite a while, and sorely missed them.</p>

    <p>But when Wang Ling summoned the Heavenly Dao little golden man, he and Er Ha were astonished by what they saw.</p>

    <p>The Heavenly Dao little golden man who had been summoned lay prone on the ground as his stomach gurgled, as if he was about to starve to death...</p>

    <p>Had Wang Ling squeezed so much out of the Heavenly Dao that they didn't even have enough to eat?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's mind was full of doubts.</p>

    <p>Was he so ruthless...</p>
