  <h1>Chapter 211 A Qigong Wave Without Waves... </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ming's identity as a transfer student was only a cover; after the military training drill was over, he would disappear. After the two brothers met privately on the roof, Wang Ling promised that after Wang Ming's disappearance, he would erase the memories of the people who had been around him.</p>

    <p>As for the other unoccupied bed in the room, this was actually a deliberate decoy on Wang Ming's part. Actually, he would be the only other person staying in the room.</p>

    <p>To avoid suspicious problems, the military instructors weren't allowed to stay with the students during the military training, and they had their own separate dormitory building.</p>

    <p>After Guo Hao had dragged Chen Chao off to gather the military supplies and they both returned, they saw that there was one more new brother in the dorm. They instantly started chatting familiarly with him. For them to coincidentally get a transfer student during this military training period and who had also been dragged into the military training... both of them felt that Wang Ming's identity wasn't simple.</p>

    <p>The most crucial thing was that they couldn't sense even the faintest hint of an aura on him. This aura concealment skill was really too powerful! If they used it during this survival drill, it could be a hugely advantageous weapon. In a situation where their auras couldn't be detected at all, they could become "Voldemort" and hide in the grass and wait for a chance to make a move. This was definitely a great trick for confusing the enemy!</p>

    <p>"Which school was this brother at before?"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao was very curious about Wang Ming's identity. Currently, they had learned from Wang Ming's mouth that he and Wang Ling had actually been neighbors who had grown up together.</p>

    <p>It was a tacit and mutual understanding that they would hide their relationship as brothers.</p>

    <p>After Chen Chao asked this question, everyone else looked eagerly at Wang Ming. Only Wang Ling lay on the bed with his hands under his head. He wasn't in the mood to go along with this idiocy, and he wasn't worried that Wang Ming wouldn't be able to integrate into the group.</p>

    <p>The reason was because this guy could make friends instantly — also, he could lie casually. After all, all these "lies" had been directly made official. This manipulation was so blatant yet even the cultivation police hadn't been able to discover any clues when they had checked his ID card.</p>

    <p>So faced with Chen Chao's question, Wang Ming answered almost without hesitation, "I studied in Xiangxieshuige in Yunding Heavenly Palace."</p>

    <p>"Xiangxieshuige in Yunding Heavenly Palace?" Chen Chao was surprised because it was a school he had never heard of before.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao patted his head and was also a little astonished in his heart. There were unexpectedly still things on this earth that he, Guo Hao, didn't know. He knew everything about all of the major high schools in Huaxiu nation; if there was something he was missing, there could only be one possibility.</p>

    <p>This Xiangxieshuige in Yunding Heavenly Palace was most likely a private institution...</p>

    <p>If it was a private institution, it was quite normal to not know about it. The government had made it compulsory for even those at the Golden Core stage to get an education, but it didn't have to be at a public school since private schools and light sects were also other alternatives. Furthermore, private institutions generally didn't accept students via online enrollment, and students got in through private connections... the main point was that those who entered these institutions were from wealthy and respectable families.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao, Guo Hao and Su Xiao stared wide-eyed and flabbergasted at this Classmate "Wang Xiaoer" in front of them — it turned out that this guy was a big boss!</p>

    <p>The thing cultivators liked to do most was to swap experiences. It wasn't easy to find a big boss from a private institution, and Chen Chao and the other two worshiped Wang Ming fervently; because the name on Wang Ming's card was Wang Xiaoer, Chen Chao simply called him second brother <sup>1</sup> . "Second brother, I want to ask, what do they teach you in a private institution?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>('Er' is 'two' in Chinese.)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ming hummed and rubbed his chin, then answered after thinking for a bit, "The Turtle Wave Heart Sutra."</p>

    <p>"Turtle Wave Heart Sutra?" Guo Hao opened his eyes wide. "Don't tell me it's the legendary heart sutra for cultivating the Turtle Qigong Wave <sup>2</sup> ? This is a heavenly technique... there are only a few people in the world who are able to grasp it!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is the translation of the
Chinese phrase used for the
'kamehameha' energy attack
in 'Dragonball .. ')</dfn>

    <p>"It doesn't seem that hard." Wang Ming spread his hands. "Almost everyone in our school can basically do it. And let me tell you, the Turtle Qigong Wave is actually already out-of-date. It has too much momentum; as soon as you release it, the enemy is already able to detect it from a distance. Even if a technique looks showy, what use is it if it can't defeat someone?!"</p>

    <p>"That's true..." The three people nodded noncommittedly.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "So now in the 'Turtle Wave Heart Sutra' and using the Turtle Qigong Wave as a base, there's a kind of qigong wave which our headmaster invented that can take someone down from thousands of li away without a sound and without causing any fluctuations."</p>

    <p>The three were petrified. "There is such an operation? What qigong wave is this? What's it called?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming's eyes were slitted mysteriously, then he said two words, "Non-Showy Wave!"</p>

    <p>"Non-Showy Wave?"</p>

    <p>They were dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>What kind of cultivation technique was this?</p>

    <p>It was actually called Non-Showy Wave?</p>

    <p>Wang Ming continued, "Like I said just now, releasing a qigong wave without sound or even the slightest fluctuation is for the sake of looking less showy."</p>

    <p>After he said this, he slowly stood up. Looking out the window, he slowly took off his coat to reveal a sinewy body, then pointed to a red mark on his back. "For the sake of cultivating this technique, your second brother suffered a lot. The headmaster threw me deep into the mountain forest where I drank dew when I was thirsty, ate grasshoppers when I hungry, and wrestled with spirit beasts every day. This red mark is from when I was struck a blow while cultivating."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling dug at his ears and almost couldn't continue listening, because that red mark was actually just a birthmark!</p>

    <p>Hearing Wang Ming's words, Chen Chao and the others sucked in sharp breaths and were crazy excited. "Second brother, you're too awesome!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming put his clothes back on and there was an unusually deep look in his eyes. Like the main character in Kung Fu Hustle who in the end defeated the Beast with his Buddhist Palm, he put his hands behind his back and calmly looked at the three people who were gazing at him in awe. "If you want to learn, I can teach you..."</p>

    <p>And so, with this type of supreme bluff, Wang Ming had already completely played these three individuals in a mere ten minutes of interaction.</p>

    <p>"Second brother, second brother, when can you explain the principle of this Non-Showy Wave to us?"</p>

    <p>"Second brother, what is the basic formula for the 'Turtle Wave Heart Sutra'? Can you teach us? When we're cultivating it, is there any specific point which we need to pay attention to?"</p>

    <p>"Points that need attention? No." Wang Ming smiled with a very gentle expression. "As long as you follow me in your cultivation, I guarantee that all of you will be able to achieve super high scores in the martial arts section of the college entrance examination!"</p>

    <p>After he said this, he didn't forget to look at Wang Ling on the upper bunk. "This brother upstairs, aren't you also going to take me as your master?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>I'll just silently watch you be a pretentious prick...</p>
