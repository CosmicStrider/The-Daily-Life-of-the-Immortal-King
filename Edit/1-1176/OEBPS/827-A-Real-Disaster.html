  <h1>Chapter 827 A Real Disaster</h1>

  <div>

    <p>By now, Wang Ling's expression was no longer the same since he didn't have much time left. He had hung around a bit to see what the legendary Ultimate King of Killers could do; in the end, he was hugely disappointed. The Dark Network Number One was only at this level!</p>

    <p>Ultimate King of Killers's spirit also instantly crumbled under this look. From that finger flick at the very beginning, the other party seemed to have a way to directly suppress the soul without hurting the body...</p>

    <p>How could a person capable of such a technique be ordinary?</p>

    <p>Moreover, it wasn't hard for Ultimate King of Killers to assume that the other party might have already seen through his body possession technique. The "Anti-Last Hit Spell" was a Dark Network forbidden spell which was widespread in the Western world. There was a book called the Black Bible in the Western world which contained all the forbidden spells, and Ultimate King of Killers paid a huge price back then to obtain the spell.</p>

    <p>The "Anti-Last Hit Spell" was one of the forbidden spells in this Black Bible.</p>

    <p>Of course, only someone who had seen the Black Bible would understand this spell.</p>

    <p>As expected, this Lord Diulei was really something.</p>

    <p>But there was no point in dwelling on this now. Ultimate King of Killers knew that this was a battle he had to face.</p>

    <p>And the first thing he had to do...</p>

    <p>... Was circulate qi and dry the underwear that this damn body was wearing!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei had just given him a look, and he was drenched in cold sweat. Ultimate King of Killers's clothes were plastered to his skin, making him feel very uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>For Ultimate King of Killers, killing was an art. Since it was an art, each murder should be carried out with sincerity and an appreciation for beauty.</p>

    <p>"Ha!"</p>

    <p>And so, Ultimate King of Killers started to amass qi. His body released boiling hot True Immortal qi which hissed like an electric iron on a hot plate.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling couldn't wait anymore. He didn't know what this Ultimate King of Killers was doing, nor was he interested in waiting for the other man to be done.</p>

    <p>For Wang Ling, getting this battle over and done with was the first priority.</p>

    <p>The next second, Lord Diulei's figure flashed as he directly disappeared. He reappeared on the horizon, and turned into a fiery meteor which streaked toward Ultimate King of Killers.</p>

    <p>Powerful wind pressure instantly enveloped the earth.</p>

    <p>This was clearly General Yi's home ground, being his intrinsic spirit field, but Wang Ling had actually turned the tables in that moment.</p>

    <p>This sudden move caught Ultimate King of Killers off guard.</p>

    <p>— His underwear wasn't dry yet!</p>

    <p>This wasn't the least bit beautiful!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei fell from the sky in the form of a fiery meteor.</p>

    <p>He came whistling down like a nuclear bomb, the wind pressure forcing Ultimate King of Killers's head down at an angle. He couldn't even open his eyes as he was pressed flat down on the ground like a toad suppressed by the Buddha Palm.</p>

    <p>Marshal Jiang cried out in astonishment on the side.</p>

    <p>What precision in this attack...</p>

    <p>This was clearly a large-scale attack to cause mass, lethal destruction, but apart from a blast of wind, Marshal Jiang didn't feel the slightest bit of pressure at all.</p>

    <p>This was enough to prove that when casting this spell, Lord Diulei had already fixed the strike trajectory so that all the pressure would pour down on Ultimate King of Killers.</p>

    <p>Ultimate King of Killers was utterly unable to withstand this pressure. Lying face down, he could only do his best to turn his head slightly and squint at the sky before he could clearly see the shocking scene. It was like the descent of divine punishment on an epic scale — it was clearly a human, but in his eyes, this human was like a planet that was about to hit the Earth. As the other party fell, the space actually cracked inch by inch in his wake to create a long and narrow cavity, and he rushed straight at Ultimate King of Killers!</p>

    <p>"I never thought... I, Ultimate King of Killers, would die here..."</p>

    <p>In that split second, memories of his life flashed before his eyes.</p>

    <p>He was sure that this Lord Diulei was going to destroy him along with General Yi's body.</p>

    <p>It was likely already too late for Lord Diulei to take back such a powerful attack.</p>

    <p>Ultimate King of Killers sneered coldly. What if he withdrew from General Yi's body at that moment, and let General Yi feel for himself what it was like to die?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>A few seconds later, the people who had been anxiously waiting outside the intrinsic spirit field saw Lord Diulei, Marshal Jiang as well as General Yi walk out intact.</p>

    <p>When Ultimate King of Killers attached himself to his body, General Yi's soul had been imprisoned. He couldn't control his body, but could clearly see what was going on outside.</p>

    <p>When he saw Lord Diulei fall, he also thought he was going to die.</p>

    <p>The worse thing was that at the very last moment, Ultimate King of Killers decided to return to his own body, giving General Yi's body back to him.</p>

    <p>So the instant General Yi regained his own body, he was scared into wetting his underwear again...</p>

    <p>But overall, it was a satisfactory ending.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling, in Lord Diulei's body, performed what looked like an all-out move to kill King of Killers, it was actually to force the latter to retreat and pull out of the body.</p>

    <p>So from the very beginning, that attack had been a coercion tactic, and Wang Ling had never intended to drop it.</p>

    <p>In the split second that it was about to hit, Wang Ling withdrew all his strength.</p>

    <p>This had all been part of his plan, so to speak.</p>

    <p>"That... That's impossible!"</p>

    <p>On the other side, Ultimate King of Killers, who had returned to his own body, had an incredulous expression on his face.</p>

    <p>That attack just now had been full of enough wild godly power to destroy a True Immortal's body - how could it be completely recalled in the last second before it hit?</p>

    <p>This was far beyond Ultimate King of Killers's expectations, as well as that of General Yi and Marshal Jiang, who had witnessed everything.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was ridiculously strong!</p>

    <p>But this powerful man had actually presented himself as a Soul Formation cultivator all these years?</p>

    <p>What kind of tolerant and low-key mentality was this...</p>

    <p>The Ten Generals should learn from him well!</p>

    <p>"Ultimate King of Killers, is there anything else you want to say?" General Yi stared at Ultimate King of Killers. He wasn't in a hurry to act this time, as he was worried that Ultimate King of Killers would use the "Anti-Last Hit Spell" again.</p>

    <p>But he didn't have to worry about Ultimate King of Killers escaping. For one thing, a barrier had already been set up at the scene. On top of that, Ultimate King of Killers had deliberately let General Yi severely injure him earlier, in order to use the "Anti-Last Hit Spell"; now that he had returned to his original, heavily wounded body, it was basically impossible for him to think of escaping!</p>

    <p>On the whole, the incident had wrapped up successfully.</p>

    <p>While the Ten General discussed how they should deal with Ultimate King of Killers, Lord Diulei sent Wang Ling a message of thanks: "Brother Ling! Thanks! Many thanks for helping out!"</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling didn't reply...</p>

    <p>Because at that moment, Teacher Pan had called his name in class...</p>

    <p>In Teacher Pan's Dao talisman class, Wang Ling spent a few minutes extricating his soul from Lord Diulei's body, which gave his own body a somewhat lifeless look. Hence, when Teacher Pan called on him to answer a question, he couldn't stand up and reply in time.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling came back to his senses, Teacher Pan had already called his name three times...</p>

    <p>Now was the fourth...</p>

    <p>"Student Wang Ling, not paying attention in class! The final exams are coming! It seems I need to contact your parents!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
