  <h1>Chapter 818 The Ten Generals Make Their Entrance</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Although this Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch clone had its own consciousness, its memories were synchronized with Wang Ling's.</p>

    <p>Thus, when the clone's palm hit Su Xing's, sect leader of the Dust-level Palm Sect, this memory was also transmitted to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>It was an evenly-matched collision of palms. The moment they met, a powerful wind was kicked up, as if from a huge mountain collapsing, and the pressure surged out in all directions from the arena like an ocean tide. Many people couldn't help toppling backward under this formidable wave.</p>

    <p>No one thought that a mere sect leader of a Dust-level sect would be strong enough to fight Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch head-on... and furthermore force him to respond to his strike...</p>

    <p>No one thought that the first-class holy artifact grand prize would ultimately be won by this Dust-level sect leader.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei had said earlier to throw the match, but the truth was that Su Xing had won fair and square. Even though his palm strike hadn't hurt the Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch clone in the slightest, the latter still hadn't had any choice but to respond to it.</p>

    <p>A palm strike which contained the power of Heavenly Dao was absolutely lethal and explosive. Wang Ling was sure that if his clone hadn't met it head-on just now, and this attack had landed elsewhere, the entire arena would have instantly crumbled under this terrible destructive force, which would then have spread across the northern square... The worst-case scenario would be Heavenly Dao radiation, which was a force that even a cultivator's body had no resistance to.</p>

    <p>With current cultivation science and technology in Huaxiu, the cure for and prevention of cancer had already been found. However, the cancer caused by Heavenly Dao radiation belonged to a very special class, and was known as spirit cancer.</p>

    <p>That was, even the spirit energy the cultivator used contained cancer cells...</p>

    <p>Currently, this was the only major scientific problem that remained unsolved.</p>

    <p>Of course, spirit cancer wasn't discovered by the people of Heavenly Dao, but by some cultivators who had failed a tribulation.</p>

    <p>Cultivators who failed to pass through a tribulation were highly likely to be punished by Heavenly Dao, and the survival rate after this punishment was twenty percent. Of those who were lucky to survive, there were many cases of them developing spirit cancer after the punishment.</p>

    <p>According to official statistics, the probability of developing spirit cancer after surviving Heavenly Dao punishment was 0.5%.</p>

    <p>0.5% didn't look like a lot, but this was a global statistic...</p>

    <p>Thus, Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch had no choice but to meet this palm strike head-on to neutralize the power of Heavenly Dao in it and prevent the spread of Heavenly Dao radiation.</p>

    <p>But after that, Wang Ling was sure of one thing — this Sect Leader Su Xing of Palm Sect probably didn't know he could use the power of Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>A person who truly mastered Heavenly Dao could control the force of its radiation. Wang Ling was one example, and so was that Wang Zhen who had come looking for trouble recently.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling couldn't control his output of primordial qi, but he had full control over Heavenly Dao. He had always been very confident in his grasp of Heavenly Dao — this thing was a lot simpler than midterm and final exams!</p>

    <p>"You win," Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch said lightly, as he straightened his clothes and brushed off a few specks of dirt.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Lord Diulei also received a text message from Wang Ling inside the machine room.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin stared at the screen. "This person somehow feels like Master, though much, much weaker! He's a little strange!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei nodded. "Yes, he's a little strange. Brother Ling has already texted me, and he thinks that this Brother Su has unconsciously comprehended Heavenly Dao."</p>

    <p>"Woof? Unconsciously comprehended it?" There were question marks all over Er Ha's face.</p>

    <p>"That's right. This is Brother Ling's preliminary guess, but it isn't confirmed yet." Lord Diulei said, "If we can learn the main reason for the involuntary comprehension of Heavenly Dao, this will be a major breakthrough!"</p>

    <p>"Makes sense!" Xiao Yin and Er Ha both nodded.</p>

    <p>"Lao Gudong Han, please tell this Brother Su Xing to come and accept his prize at the sect's main hall after the celebration is over," Lord Diulei turned on the transmitter and said to Lao Gudong Han.</p>

    <p>In this way, arrangements were quietly made for Su Xing...</p>

    <p>As the saying went, you couldn't judge a book by its cover — even if he was the sect leader of a Dust-level sect, you couldn't look down on him.</p>

    <p>The majority of the people present were fine with the outcome of this match; even the few Sky-level sect leaders who had gone up earlier might not necessarily have been able to produce the same power and lethal force of that palm strike.</p>

    <p>That was because a lot of people could tell that while Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch had seemed to respond to this palm strike with his own, he was in fact neutralizing it with a natural sort of power. The moment it collided with Su Xing's explosive palm strike, the latter was like a knife piercing a sponge, as a lot of its power was absorbed.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, the sight in the northern square wouldn't be as simple as just people toppling backward.</p>

    <p>If Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch hadn't acted to neutralize the palm strike, Lu Youming thought that even he would have been sent flying...</p>

    <p>"According to the rules, the prize for this stage performance has been won by Mr Su Xing, sect leader of Dust-level Palm Sect. Mr Su Xing, you may leave the stage and get some rest. Please go to the sect's main hall later to accept your prize." After Lao Gudong spoke, he was the first to clap, and for a moment after that, the northern square was filled with thunderous applause.</p>

    <p>Numerous cameras flashed in Su Xing's face, and he felt excited for the first time in a long while.</p>

    <p>He would absolutely be able to pay off the sect's debts in one swoop with this first-class holy artifact, and there might even be some money left after.</p>

    <p>And after the reporters released this news, Palm Sect's reputation would definitely increase.</p>

    <p>Those who were here today in the northern square were prestigious media reporters in the cultivation circle!</p>

    <p>How much Palm Sect would gain as a result of these news reports was truly hard to measure.</p>

    <p>"Palm Sect is going to become popular. Go look for this Sect Leader Su and get along with him." Lu Youming could also see the situation clearly.</p>

    <p>"Us, get along with him?" Sect Leader Sun Hanzhe said.</p>

    <p>"Palm Sect is a Dust-level sect, but after this momentum, it won't be difficult at all for it to advance to Earth or even Sky level in a short period of time. Besides, this sect leader isn't someone without power... You too should have felt how destructive that palm strike was," Lu Youming said.</p>

    <p>"Alright! I'll listen to you!" Sect Leader Sun said.</p>

    <p>Public opinion, reviews, popularity, and the final impetus, direct benefits...</p>

    <p>Now was a great time to rope Palm Sect in.</p>

    <p>The highlight of the celebration that everyone had been waiting for finally arrived.</p>

    <p>There was finally new movement on the immortal warship, which had been hovering in the sky for a long time.</p>

    <p>A golden pillar of light shone straight down from the belly of the immortal warship.</p>

    <p>A lot of people broke out in discussion below as they tried to guess who on earth the person in the immortal warship was.</p>

    <p>"Could it be... the sect leader of Immortal Palm Tree Sect?" someone speculated.</p>

    <p>As the only Sky-level first-class sect, Immortal Palm Tree Sect wasn't taking part in this celebration. Some people surmised that its sect leader might have been invited as a mystery guest.</p>

    <p>What kind of spectacle was the Office of Strategic Deception going to show them this time? While Immortal Palm Tree Sect was usually aloof, it wouldn't go so far as to not give the former face...</p>

    <p>During this hubbub of discussion below the stage, a figure descended in the golden light from the immortal warship to appear in front of them.</p>

    <p>It was an old man in a training outfit, with spiky gray hair and a grizzled beard.</p>

    <p>Some of the sect leaders in the northern square had already started to rub their eyes.</p>

    <p>Blade...</p>

    <p>Blademaster??</p>

    <p>They didn't dare believe their eyes!</p>
