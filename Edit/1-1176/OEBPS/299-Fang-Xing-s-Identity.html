  <h1>Chapter 299 Fang Xing's Identity </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Even the Master of Immortal Mansion hadn't anticipated this decisive swing of the blade. Before he could send his next telepathic message, the aura of one of the female elders had already completely disappeared.</p>

    <p>Without any room for negotiation, Fang Xing had really chopped off her head in one move.</p>

    <p>What was even more stupefying was that this wasn't the end.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing dealt with things very firmly; gathering spirit energy in his palm, he raised his hand again and chopped off the head of a second female elder immediately followed by the third.</p>

    <p>The heavy pressure in the intrinsic spirit field had faded, and the three heads rolled over the ground with open eyes; they died with lingering grievances, and there wasn't any bleeding from their necks at all.</p>

    <p>It could only be said that Fang Xing wasn't just unwavering, he was also ruthless. The most important point was that, without even giving them time to breathe, he had beheaded three Itinerant Immortals like he was slicing radishes.</p>

    <p>Anyone would be transfixed with horror at this scene.</p>

    <p>"Very well! You have guts! You're just courting death!"</p>

    <p>The sound of the Master of Immortal Mansion's fury penetrated the intrinsic spirit field, and a moment later, the roof of Linglang Pavilion outside the field was directly torn off.</p>

    <p>With a wave of Fang Xing's hand, the intrinsic spirit field disappeared. He picked up the heads of the three female elders, leaving their bodies buried forever in the intrinsic spirit field.</p>

    <p>After the roof of Linglang Pavilion had been torn off, the Taoist in red and that eastern branch chief from before showed up. Fang Xing shook the heads in front of them before causally tossing them behind him.</p>

    <p>The Taoist in red and the eastern branch chief gnashed their teeth at this painful scene, already about to erupt with rage.</p>

    <p>Actually, while Fang Xing had been battling the three female elders, the Master of Immortal Mansion had already been observing him from the shadows.</p>

    <p>After seeing Fang Xing call forth his intrinsic spirit field, the Master had already had some idea about the other person's general strength â€” he definitely wasn't ordinary. Also, his aura indeed felt familiar. It was highly likely that this was a descendant of someone whom he had fought before. Basically, the Master already had a hunch.</p>

    <p>"This intrinsic spirit field isn't yours, right? Relying on something that you were favored with is nothing to be proud of." The Taoist in red hovered above the clouds and looked down at him from on high.</p>

    <p>What he said was right, and Fang Xing couldn't refute it; this intrinsic spirit field indeed wasn't his. It could perhaps be considered a relic. It contained an intensely dense accumulation of spirit energy, and together with the secret key to this space, had been engraved on his body when he had been born.</p>

    <p>The year he turned five, he had inadvertently opened the space, and only after a long span of time did he realize that this thing was called an intrinsic spirit field.</p>

    <p>When he thought about it, Fang Xing felt that his childhood had been quite tragic; like the protagonist in a novel who picked up a golden finger <sup>1</sup> , he had only been able to rely on himself as he muddled his way through life.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(High-level 'cheat' items that

    <p>Although the Fang couple had raised him with a lot of love, he still hadn't been able to forgive the guy who had pushed his biological father step by step toward the abyss for the sake of his own interests.</p>

    <p>History had completely painted his father as heinous and tragic... whether this was true or not, Fang Xing had drawn his own conclusions.</p>

    <p>In the air, the Master of Immortal Mansion continued to sneer when he saw that the young man was silent. "Given your strength, if you hadn't sucked my subordinates into your intrinsic spirit field to suppress them, you wouldn't be a match for any one of them at all."</p>

    <p>"What use is it saying that now?"</p>

    <p>Fang Xing sighed in his heart, but his face showed that familiar harmless smile once again.</p>

    <p>"To be able to develop an intrinsic spirit field to this point based on your abilities alone... this is indeed a surprise. But now that you've already shown your final hand, isn't it already game over?" The Taoist in red laughed sinisterly.</p>

    <p>Revealing your trump card at the beginning of a fight was a huge mistake. To be able to call forth the intrinsic spirit field with his current realm, Fang Xing must have already reached his limit. The three female elders had been the backbone of Immortal Mansion, but Master of Immortal Mansion Cheng Yu felt that their deaths hadn't been in vain; they had at least forced this young man to play his final hand and use up a lot of his spirit energy, otherwise it really would have been a little tough to deal with him.</p>

    <p>At the moment, Cheng Yu didn't think he had completely lost; as long as he killed Fang Xing, and used his secret key to enter the intrinsic spirit field and look for the three elders' primordial spirits, Immortal Mansion had yet to truly lose this battle.</p>

    <p>The biggest advantage of Itinerant Immortal level was that after the body was destroyed, the primordial spirit could still linger for over a month, and furthermore wouldn't be affected by light.</p>

    <p>While Fang Xing had beheaded the three female elders one after another, he obviously hadn't had enough time to extinguish their primordial spirits.</p>

    <p>This was why Cheng Yu had appeared here in haste; if he hadn't shown up in time, he wouldn't have been able to protect any of these spirits.</p>

    <p>Following this thought, Cheng Yu felt that all this had been preordained somehow. While Fang Xing's appearance could be considered an unexpected one, it could conversely be considered a pleasant surprise.</p>

    <p>Back then, he had seized almost all of Immortal She Pi's riches except for some valuable treasures like the intrinsic spirit field. Cheng Yu had been searching for it all these years, and had never expected that someone would actually bring it to his doorstep of their own accord.</p>

    <p>This was the treasure that he had failed to wrest from Immortal She Pi; now, he would naturally fight over it again with the other party's son.</p>

    <p>Strength was supreme among cultivators; that thing was always meant to be his.</p>

    <p>Two dazzling rays of light interrupted his thoughts.</p>

    <p>Master of Immortal Mansion Cheng Yu was utterly astonished. It was hard to believe that this youngster could still have such tremendous spirit energy after a fight with the three female elders.</p>

    <p>He dodged to the side. The two dazzling rays of light hit the massive stone pillars that held up the palace, and they instantly collapsed.</p>

    <p>Cheng Yu hadn't been able to see these two rays of light clearly, but he could absolutely confirm that this wasn't some type of magic or magic treasure. Furthermore, they had truly been too fast, so much so that he hadn't been able to grab hold of them at all.</p>

    <p>"Too arrogant!"</p>

    <p>Fuming, the eastern branch chief gritted his teeth and stared at Fang Xing. "Master, you must definitely teach this person a lesson!"</p>

    <p>Fang Xing looked at him with a smile. "Excuse me, who do you think you are?"</p>

    <p>Then, he waved his hand, and the two rays of light from earlier instantly flew back from behind.</p>

    <p>This time, they swiftly pierced the body of the eastern branch chief one after another.</p>

    <p>The Master of Immortal Mansion could finally see them clearly.</p>

    <p>They were actually two scale plates...</p>

    <p>But at the price of being able to clearly see what these two rays of light were...</p>

    <p>The poor eastern branch chief perished right after the three female elders.</p>
