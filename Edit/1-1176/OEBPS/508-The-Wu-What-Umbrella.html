  <h1>Chapter 508 The Wu What Umbrella?! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>From what Mr Lu currently knew of President Bai, the latter was someone with a strong self-healing ability; furthermore, he had created his own self-healing techniques.</p>

    <p>To be honest, even Wang Ling was a little amazed by this.</p>

    <p>After all, Wang Ling felt that apart from him, there shouldn't be anyone else, whether in the human or demon world, who could match the Tree clan in terms of self-healing ability. And most importantly, Wang Ling felt that there was no person that existed who could hurt him, so in reality, he had never had the chance to use his regenerative ability up until now.</p>

    <p>His primordial qi had a powerful self-healing attribute to begin with; even a slight break in his skin would be healed at the speed of light.</p>

    <p>Now a person with a strong self-healing ability had suddenly appeared; Wang Ling felt that in some sense, this man was also a prodigy!</p>

    <p>In prison right now, there was the old devil who was a mage; Cheng Yu, the Master of Immortal Mansion, who was an archer; and Evil Sword God, who was a melee expert. There was also Jiang Liuyue, the Master of Shadow Stream, who was in solitary confinement. Although she wasn't as strong as the others, she was in any case an assassin. If they could catch this President Bai and put this "wet nurse" in prison, the team battle lineup would be complete!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed deeply in his heart and in truth felt a little tired.</p>

    <p>It seemed that in half a semester, he had already sent quite a number of people to prison, and furthermore, they were all big shots. But the point was that even then, his life still wasn't peaceful.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Ling had the fanciful idea that if things continued to develop at this rate, Songhai First Prison might be packed by the time he graduated high school.</p>

    <p>Now it was just a team battle lineup... by the time he graduated, there might be enough of them to make up an army.</p>

    <p>This President Bai was a little awesome!</p>

    <p>But...</p>

    <p><em>There's no way he can defeat shifu!</em></p>

    <p>But...</p>

    <p><em>There's no way he can defeat Wang Ling!</em></p>

    <p>After listening to Mr Lu's account, Zhuo Yi and Lord Diulei pondered in their hearts, and almost as if they had come to an agreement after discussing it together, they had the same thought in perfect unison.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was in charge of asking the questions and Lord Diulei was recording everything down; this was Mr Lu's first testimony as an informant, and would be important reference for reducing his sentence in the future. All these years, Mr Lu had committed many wrongs under orders from President Bai. It could be said that he had secretly aided and abetted President Bai in the illegal trafficking of spirit beasts, so he was bound to be punished.</p>

    <p>Although Lord Diulei had arranged for Mr Lu to later follow Song Qingshu to atone for his sins by becoming an "air purifier" to eliminate formaldehyde for a period of time...</p>

    <p>A crime was a crime!</p>

    <p>There was no way for him to escape punishment.</p>

    <p>The only thing possible was to give him a lighter sentence.</p>

    <p>According to the latest "Laws Against the Mistreatment and Murder of Spirit Beasts," even a light sentence carried a minimum prison term of five years, and exoneration was almost impossible. Of course, if Mr Lu hadn't voluntarily confessed his crimes and become a witness, he could have been sentenced as an accomplice of President Bai's and directly locked up for two hundred years.</p>

    <p>Five years was neither short nor long, but for a member of a long-lived Tree clan like Mr Lu, it would probably go by in a flash.</p>

    <p>And if Mr Lu was sent to prison, who knew, his sentence could be commuted if he did an excellent job of purifying the prison air...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi stared at what Lord Diulei had written down. The latter had recorded down everything Mr Lu had said without leaving even one character out. It was Zhuo Yi's first time seeing Lord Diulei's handwriting, and given the other man's lively and trippy nature, this handwriting was a little too beautiful.</p>

    <p>There was a saying that a person's handwriting reflected their character. But Lord Diulei's writing didn't give people a sense of bubbliness at all. Each character was beautiful, neat and dignified, as if they were printed, and for one brief moment, Zhuo Yi was a little dazed.</p>

    <p>Gazing at the notes, he suddenly noticed a key point that had been written down, and he promptly looked up at Mr Lu. "Mr Lu, can you tell me where this black magic umbrella came from?"</p>

    <p>Hearing this question, Wang Ling and Lord Diulei's expressions also hardened a little.</p>

    <p>The nation had always imposed strict controls on spatial magic treasures. Currently, most of the spatial magic treasures sold in the magic treasures trade market were for storage use, and it was impossible that any of them were powerful enough to instantly create a barrier and teleport people. But from what Mr Lu had said, this black magic umbrella clearly had an unusual origin.</p>

    <p>Given its space teleportation and barrier abilities, its grade would surpass even that of the Purple Gold Gourd which Immortal Zhenyuan had developed back then.</p>

    <p>After some thought, Immortal Zhenyuan said, "Although all I did was hold the umbrella for Bai Zhe, I did once privately sense the power that flowed out of it. It is at the very least a first-class holy weapon; furthermore, there's a real possibility that it could be a quasi-divine weapon... It has a very unusual origin."</p>

    <p>Quasi-divine weapon?</p>

    <p>Everyone present was slightly dazed.</p>

    <p>The circulation of divine weapons was absolutely prohibited as their existence was on par with national treasures. One or two divine weapons in a country's possession were already strong deterrents, and the country would even have a strong voice on an international stage. However, divine weapons couldn't be manufactured, and instead were unique products born of nature.</p>

    <p>At present, the highest level of magic weapons that human cultivators could create, with power equal to that of divine weapons, were only world-defying magic weapons.</p>

    <p>Quasi-divine weapons, which were a level below divine weapons, couldn't be manufactured either, and they weren't as powerful as divine weapons.</p>

    <p>But even if they were inferior to true divine weapons, they were still a lot more powerful than first-class holy weapons!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei cupped his chin in his hand as he pondered.</p>

    <p>He was someone who knew all the ranked magic weapons that were on file. If this small black umbrella was really a first-class holy weapon or close to being a quasi-divine weapon, there was no way that it wouldn't be recorded on an international list somewhere.</p>

    <p>"How bold is this man to actually dare use this type of strictly restricted magic weapon in public?!" Zhuo Yi tsked. "Does <em>shifu </em>, Senior Immortal or Brother Xiao Yin have any idea about where this black magic umbrella might have come from?"</p>

    <p>In reality, Zhuo Yi really didn't know much about this area. After all, his experience was limited as it hadn't been long since he had graduated from university and started working. Even though his popularity and prestige had swelled after becoming a scapegoat a few times, he certainly wasn't as experienced as canny Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>After all, this Great Death-Courting Senior ran such a large cultivation forum, and at every minute of every hour of every day, he would be receiving all kinds of the latest gossip and news, so it made sense that he would have a lot of experience.</p>

    <p>Folding his arms, Lord Diulei racked his brains for a bit, then seemed to remember something as he suddenly looked up and said, "It's the Wuji Umbrella!"</p>

    <p>"What?!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was stunned. "What <em>ji </em>? The <em>ji </em>in 'funny <sup>1</sup> '?!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The Chinese word for funny here is 滑稽 'huaji .. ')</dfn>
