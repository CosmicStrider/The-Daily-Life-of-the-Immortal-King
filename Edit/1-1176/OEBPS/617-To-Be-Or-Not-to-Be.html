  <h1>Chapter 617 To Be Or Not to Be</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Even Wang Ling never expected Devil Valley to be openly selected as the site for the school summer camp this time. For this type of 5A state-protected secret land, even specialist teams from state organizations had to go through layers of bureaucratic tape, and even then their applications might not necessarily be approved. But this time, Devil Valley had been directly opened as a summer camp site for students, which Wang Ling thought was a little outrageous.</p>

    <p>He knew that Luo Chuang had coveted this place for a long time. In order to look for the main ingredient, the "One Thousand Dried Bone," to create a scabbard for Jingke, Luo Chuang had started to make plans to enter Devil Valley several months ago, and had taken an exam for his expert certificate. Luo Chuang had been painstakingly planning this for so long, but in the end this opportunity to enter Devil Valley had fallen into Wang Ling's lap like it was nothing...</p>

    <p>Vaguely, Wang Ling had a bad feeling.</p>

    <p>He thought what Chen Chao said actually wasn't unreasonable...</p>

    <p>Every time they had a group activity, it felt like something big was going to happen...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was now about four o'clock and four full hours had already passed since Xiao Yin left Wenxian Garden.</p>

    <p>There had been several traffic jams on the way, and Driver Liu had suggested that they take a detour. Xiao Yin hadn't refused, and as a result, Driver Liu had turned in the opposite direction and taken several winding routes before driving the car down a road which Xiao Yin didn't recognize.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin had already been on guard against this driver when he had gotten into the car. He had then checked online for anything to do with Didi Shun Feng spirit cars recently and had found information on a man called "Bi Mad Devil."</p>

    <p>This was a murder suspect currently on the run who had committed a series of rapes, ransom kidnappings and murders...</p>

    <p>After comparing and confirming the profile with the online description, Xiao Yin couldn't help sighing on the spot â€” he was really unlucky!</p>

    <p>"It's already been four hours. Haven't we arrived yet?" Xiao Yin was impatient. He didn't know what on earth Driver Liu was up to.</p>

    <p>"Almost there, Mr Yin." Liu Zhenhua licked his lips slightly. "The roads were too jammed so we took a detour which is a little longer. If we had taken those congested roads, I'm afraid Mr Yin might not get there even by nightfall."</p>

    <p>As the car drove on, Liu Zhenhua looked in the rearview mirror and saw that this "Mr Yin" who looked like a young lady had crossed his arms in the backseat with an impatient expression on his face.</p>

    <p>"Mr Yin, don't be anxious, listen to some music first." Liu Zhenhua smiled strangely.</p>

    <p>Then, he flicked a small mechanism behind the steering wheel, and instantly, all the doors were secretly sealed tightly shut. He had modified this car, and once this mechanism was triggered, a separate secret lock was activated which silently sealed all the doors tightly shut except for the driver's car door.</p>

    <p>Driver Liu then turned on the music, and the car's stereo system started to play a melodious tune, but there was something else mixed into it...</p>

    <p>This stereo system had also been modified by Driver Liu and wasn't just a simple stereo system.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin sensed something right away. Focusing his eyes on the stereo system, he could see some fine white powder on the honeycomb-like covers of the stereo system that was shaken loose with the musical beat and which dissolved bit by bit in the air until it disappeared completely.</p>

    <p>This was a very covert trick; if your realm was too weak or your power of sight wasn't strong enough, you wouldn't be able to detect it at all.</p>

    <p>No wonder the previous reports said that a lot of Golden Core cultivators and even one Nascent Soul cultivator had fallen into this trap; if you weren't vigilant enough, it was very easy to fall for this kind of trick. Seeing the driver suddenly turn on the air-conditioning might make someone wary, but most people wouldn't expect a hallucinogen to be spread through the stereo system.</p>

    <p>Once the music played, the hallucinogenic powder would spread with the vibrations of the music, carrying the powder on the air so that it would spread throughout the car.</p>

    <p>Seeing that his plan had been smoothly carried out, Liu Zhenhua couldn't help laughing sinisterly in his heart. He had purchased this hallucinogenic powder off the black market at a high price. Even a Nascent Soul cultivator would feel dizzy and wouldn't be able to use spirit energy, so this hallucinogenic powder was also called "Nascent Soul Also Drunk" powder...</p>

    <p>Most importantly, furthermore, was that this hallucinogen could be spread in various ways, such as through vibrations, immersions, and so on.</p>

    <p>For the best cover possible, Liu Zhenhua had modified his car's stereo system and had installed a separate recess to put the hallucinogenic powder in. As long as the music played, this light hallucinogenic powder would be picked up by the vibrations and dispersed through the small holes of the stereo system into the air.</p>

    <p>Even a Nascent Soul cultivator would collapse in five seconds when the air in the car was filled with this hallucinogenic powder.</p>

    <p>In that moment, Liu Zhenhua sneered cruelly in his heart.</p>

    <p>He looked at the time. Five seconds had flashed past.</p>

    <p>But Mr Yin, was completely unharmed...</p>

    <p>Liu Zhenhua: "???"</p>

    <p>Was it possible that his powder was past its expiry date? That shouldn't be the case...</p>

    <p>He had just put this packet of hallucinogenic powder in not long ago, and he had previously confirmed that it had a shelf life of more than three years.</p>

    <p>Besides, this was just a Foundation Establishment cultivator; shouldn't he have collapsed with just one whiff?</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin crossed his arms and couldn't help laughing in his heart as he gazed at Driver Liu, whose face was full of black question marks.</p>

    <p>Then, thirty seconds passed...</p>

    <p>Driver Liu saw this "Mr Yin's" smiling face in the rearview mirror and immediately felt a chill.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "So you're that 'Bi Mad Devil'?"</p>

    <p>Liu Zhenhua narrowed his eyes. "I don't know what Mr Yin is talking about..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "You changed your appearance, and you installed a lot of mechanisms in your car. I've already seen all of them. You did something to your stereo system, didn't you? I saw white powder inside; this is probably a hallucinogen?"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Liu Zhenhua instantly hit the brakes and the harmless smile on his face turned into a fiendish expression as he stared at Xiao Yin. "When did you find out?"</p>

    <p>"When I got in the car, I was a little suspicious. On the way, I looked up information online, and confirmed your identity." Xiao Yin spread his hands.</p>

    <p>Liu Zhenhua was very curious. "You never thought of running?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was even more curious. "Why should I? Clearly, the person who should run is you!"</p>

    <p>Liu Zhenhua: "..."</p>

    <p>"I was pondering a very philosophical question since just now: to be or not to be? Should I get rid of you? Because whether to cry or not to cry after running into a bad guy, both options won't do any good."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin reviewed the situation with a stern face. "But when I signed a contract with my Master, he already said that I'm not allowed to kill people wantonly. Dying just like that would be too easy a death for a person like you."</p>

    <p>"You..." Liu Zhenhua clenched his teeth. He realized that this pretty Mr Yin in front of him wasn't at the Foundation Establishment stage at all, but was a formidable person... He couldn't tell exactly what his realm was, but what he could be sure of was that since his hallucinogenic powder hadn't had any effect, this person was at least a Soul Formation expert!</p>

    <p>"Don't move! I've already sealed all the doors shut!" Liu Zhenhua took out a crystal ball from the front of his shirt. "This is a spirit bomb; if I squeeze it, it'll explode. Get out of the car now and we'll act like we never met, or I won't mind burying someone else with me..."</p>

    <p>But just as Liu Zhenhua finished speaking, he suddenly felt a stabbing pain in his hand.</p>

    <p><em>Pei </em>!</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin directly spat thick phlegm at Liu Zhenhua's hand. In extreme agony, Liu Zhenhua realized that his hand had dissolved along with the spirit bomb!</p>

    <p>"Ah..."</p>

    <p>Liu Zhenhua screamed in pain as his hand instantly melted like an ice cube at boiling temperatures.</p>

    <p>He wanted to make a report!</p>

    <p><em>Uncle police!</em></p>

    <p><em>A "Silver" person is spitting everywhere<sup>1</sup>!</em></p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>('Yin' from 'Xiao Yin' means silver.)</dfn>
