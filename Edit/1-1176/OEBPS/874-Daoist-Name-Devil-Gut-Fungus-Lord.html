  <h1>Chapter 874 Daoist Name! Devil Gut Fungus Lord!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The enlightened E. coli had turned into Lord Fungus, with the terrifying abilities to upgrade, devour and reproduce. Lord Ma was well aware why his Eye of No Beginning hadn't worked - it wasn't because of his eyes, but because Lord Fungus's ability to reproduce was too strong.</p>

    <p>This Lord Fungus was very smart, using this reproduction ability so that small E. coli constantly multiplied to form bacteria armor around its main body - it was like an orange which you could never finish peeling. There was no way to destroy the "pulp" of the main body, which was the most frustrating thing.</p>

    <p>Lord Ma and Miss Yu never expected that Lord Fungus's plan all along had been to rely on the excrement in the inner space to evolve. After crawling across Miss Yu's branch and entering space, it rapidly evolved, and furthermore obtained spatial abilities.</p>

    <p>They were in real trouble this time!</p>

    <p>Even Miss Yu herself was at a loss. "Is - is there still time to use hand sanitizer..."</p>

    <p>Lord Ma broke into a sweat. This Miss Yu who had been eating in his inner space was actually now thinking about washing her hands like a clean freak -<em>you were eating with your bare hands, you still dare talk about cleaning them </em>!</p>

    <p>"Miss Yu, can you sense where this Lord Fungus is headed?" Lord Ma surveyed every space with his Eye of No Beginning from within his inner space.</p>

    <p>This was the Eye's second ability: to see through space. However, it was limited to places that had toilets.</p>

    <p>In this world, any place that had a toilet was like an "eye stone" for Lord Ma; he could use the toilets scattered all over the world as eye stones to observe their surroundings. However, his observation range was limited to a radius of five meters.</p>

    <p>Even though there were so many toilets, the truth was that he couldn't see much. Furthermore, a lot of the images from these spaces were dark since the toilets were being used; if he wanted to check out the surroundings, he could only wait until these people's butts left first...</p>

    <p>There was no way for him to take a good look!</p>

    <p>"I'm contacting my Tree Clan comrades to help keep a lookout!" said Miss Yu.</p>

    <p>Actually, she was feeling very remorseful about letting this Lord Fungus mature. Half of it was her fault; she had been too naive when dealing with that E. coli, and never thought this would happen.</p>

    <p>She should have set her branch on fire right away, and burned the other party up along with it!</p>

    <p>Bacteria were afraid of high heat!</p>

    <p>But it was now too late.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Lord Ma and Miss Yu were using their spatial abilities to try and track down Lord Fungus, who was on the run.</p>

    <p>Compared with Lord Ma's limited spatial ability, Miss Yu could work together with her Tree Clan comrades, which made the search a lot easier.</p>

    <p>But both of them never expected this Lord Fungus to be so cunning.</p>

    <p>It headed for a place without any trees.</p>

    <p>At that moment, on Immortal Toya's Chrysanthemum Island, the only respectable toilet was currently occupied by Li Diao. To temper Jinshi's and Yinshi's leg muscles as well as have them form good toilet habits, Immortal Toya set up squat toilets for his two disciples. They were outfitted with wifi signal blockers, so there wasn't any Internet access inside the toilets.</p>

    <p>Since Lord Ma couldn't monitor the surroundings from a toilet in use, plus the fact that Chrysanthemum Island was covered in bright chrysanthemums, without a tree in sight, it was the perfect place for Lord Fungus's scheme.</p>

    <p>Lord Fungus was afraid of light and fire, but the lush chrysanthemums on the island gave it enough shade to move around in.</p>

    <p>The reason why it chose to come to Chrysanthemum Island was because the host it was eyeing was on this island.</p>

    <p>Yes, that host wasn't just anybody.</p>

    <p>It was the master of Chrysanthemum Island, Immortal Toya.</p>

    <p>As someone from a family of medical practitioners, Immortal Toya had been in the trade for a thousand years and was highly knowledgeable. Currently, he was the Toya Clan's only descendant. Normally, a bacterium would never look for a highly-experienced medical specialist as a host, especially a host who was highly resistant to poison; it wasn't easy to invade this host's body and fuse with it.</p>

    <p>But the situation now was different.</p>

    <p>It was the new and advanced Lord Fungus, and probably the strongest E. Coli in the universe right now! Given its strength, if it could successfully fuse with Immortal Toya, it could become exceedingly drug-resistant, maybe even immortal!</p>

    <p>Lord Fungus had already decided to give itself a new Daoist name.</p>

    <p>If this operation to occupy its host succeeded, it wanted to infect the entire world; whatever was gone forever would never return.</p>

    <p>Devil Gut Fungus Lord!</p>

    <p>It had already thought of its Daoist name!</p>

    <p>Now, it just had to wait to act!</p>

    <p>On the other side, Li Diao was still receiving emergency treatment when Immortal Toya heard the alarm from the chrysanthemum array on the island.</p>

    <p>It was an intruder!</p>

    <p>But who was it?</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya furrowed his brow.</p>

    <p>" <em>Shifu </em>, want us to go take a look?" Jinshi asked obediently.</p>

    <p>"The two of you just take good care of Mr Li - I'll go check it out. After Mr Li has emptied his bowels, have him drink the medicine as planned. After that, he will have ongoing diarrhea for three days and three nights. As long as he can make it through that, he'll recover," Immortal Toya replied.</p>

    <p>"Yes, <em>shifu </em>!"</p>

    <p>"Mm..."</p>

    <p>After that, Immortal Toya left the room and went outside.</p>

    <p>Frowning, he gazed in the direction the alarm had come from.</p>

    <p>In fact, he had a bad feeling, and it was because of this that he turned down Jinshi and Yinshi's suggestion that they go take a look.</p>

    <p>"Senior Immortal, it appears that there's an intruder on my island. If I don't reply in fifteen minutes, please send someone to come and take a look." To be on the safe side, Immortal Toya typed out a message and sent it to Lord Diulei before he went to check.</p>

    <p>Then, he went deep into the chrysanthemum array. The array beneath his feet was a top secret design by his ancestors which would cause ninety-nine percent of people to lose their bearings. With every step, the chrysanthemums around them would constantly change the path, creating a dizzying effect. Each chrysanthemum was specially custom-made and gigantic, standing two meters tall.</p>

    <p>What was more, the array had a flight restriction, so it wasn't easy to fly over it.</p>

    <p>After entering the array, Immortal Toya looked up at the blue sky - the other party hadn't invaded by air.</p>

    <p>Thus, he could only go deep into the array to where the alarm had come from to look for the intruder.</p>

    <p>But Immortal Toya never thought that the intruder wouldn't be human.</p>

    <p>It was a lump of enchanted bacteria whose aura even he couldn't sense.</p>

    <p>As Immortal Toya entered the array to investigate, danger slowly crept up on him from behind...</p>
