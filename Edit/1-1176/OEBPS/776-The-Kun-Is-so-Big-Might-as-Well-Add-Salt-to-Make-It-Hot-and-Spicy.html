  <h1>Chapter 776 The Kun Is so Big, Might as Well Add Salt to Make It Hot and Spicy</h1>

  <div>

      <p>"New results?"</p>

      <p>"That's right." Wang Zhen nodded. "In addition to finding what I was looking for, I also discovered a new breed of kun during my space probe, called the air kun. This kun tastes like vegetables, and so is called a vegetable kun, or vegetable air kun.</p>
      
      <dfn><sup></sup>(A literal translation of "cai
xukun," the name of a Chinese
pop idol who was accused of
being too "effeminate" to star
in an NBA promo ad ..)</dfn>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p>President Bai was secretly fearful when he heard this story.</p>

      <p>Prehistoric vicious beasts were a species that had already become extinct on Earth a very long time ago. In the end, they were living in large numbers in the world above, and someone had even opened a kun farm.</p>

      <p>As it was said, "A kun is too big for a pot ...</p>

      <p>"The tender and fragrant meat tastes like wax ... might as well add salt and turn it into a hot and spicy dish."</p>

      <p>This was a very well-known poem by an Almighty who was describing the taste of a kun after eating it.</p>

      <p>And it was precisely because of this poem that most people thought ...</p>

      <p>The kun wasn't tasty ...</p>

      <p>But the fact was that they had just chosen the wrong breed.</p>

      <p>According to Dao Master Wang, there was a diverse range of kun breeds, and the ones which he used to fish around and explore space with were low-grade, mutated scavenger kun.</p>

      <p>"What does Dao Master Wang mean?"</p>

      <p>"My venerable self has already ascertained the thief's whereabouts, and I intend to capture him in the next few days." Wang Zhen took a deep breath. For the longest time, he had been painstakingly searching for the thief who had stolen his Heavenly Dao, despite his clan's objections.</p>

      <p>He was invincible on Nine-fold Star, and all these years had defeated everyone under heaven, except for a single person ...</p>

      <p>The reason for his defeat was that he had too few Heavenly Dao. As long as he wrested back his Heavenly Dao, he would at the very least be able to fight that man to a draw.</p>

      <p>At this point, Wang Zhen raised his hand to produce a ball of blue-green light. In an instant, it was as if the whole of Night Chief general HQ was enveloped in peace and tranquility, like a force of nature had been generated in Wang Zhen's hand.</p>

      <p>He seemed like a man who controlled the laws of nature; it was just a small ball of light, but it seemed to contain the godly power of heaven and earth within it.</p>

      <p>After a few seconds, this ball of spirit light spread out in the air to take the shape of a map marked with dots of light.</p>

      <p>"While I was using the low-grade kun to explore space, I also looked for some locations where the power of Outer Dao might appear. You'll have to collect and comprehend the power of Outer Dao yourself. They are the only laws of nature that can take material form. You need to find them and conquer them one by one. However, there are quite a number of places marked on the map. You should think it over and search them slowly."</p>

      <p>"Many thanks, Dao Master Wang, this junior understands," President Bai said.</p>

      <p>Wang Zhen then waved his hand and tossed several marble-like magic artifacts to President Bai. "These are law-catching balls. There is a button in the center of each ball; tapping it will cause the ball to enlarge. You'll need these balls to catch Outer Dao. The six Great Outer Dao are like the five elements, and exist in mutual subjugation to one another. You have already mastered the most unique Outer Dao, the 'Power of Reverse Polarity.' I don't need to remind you what to do next, do I?"</p>

      <p>"Of course, this junior will not disappoint Your Excellency Dao Master." President Bai was utterly delighted.</p>

      <p>As Wang Zhen said, what President Bai had to do next naturally was to create a snowball effect with the Outer Dao he had. The power of Outer Dao existed in mutual subjugation to one another. Thus, as long as he could successfully collect two Outer Dao, the other four would involuntarily fall into his hands. It was now only a matter of time ...</p>

      <p>"You have to be careful. Patience, patience ... be more patient. As for the rest, my venerable self has nothing else for you to take note of." Wang Zhen sighed.</p>

      <p>To be honest, Wang Zhen was skeptical as to whether Bai Zhe could collect all the six Great Outer Dao.</p>

      <p>Although he had already tracked down clues about Wang Ling, for some reason, he had a bad feeling.</p>

      <p>But for the time being, he didn't dare return to Nine-fold Star right away ...</p>

      <p>Even if things ultimately didn't work out on Earth, he would go for a walk outside the Milky Way first.</p>

      <p>Wang Zhen lifted his head and gazed into the air in one direction.</p>

      <p>That was the direction Nine-fold Star was in.</p>

      <p>At that very moment ...</p>

      <p>He could more or less guess that the Liu family was looking for him everywhere on Nine-fold Star.</p>

      <p>The Liu family was currently ranked third in strength on Nine-fold Star.</p>

      <p>To stand against the Gu family, whose strength put them firmly in first place, Wang Zhen's father had thought of allying with the Liu family through marriage - but the problem was that Wang Zhen didn't like the young miss of the Liu family!</p>

      <p>Thus, while Wang Zhen had found leads on Wang Ling, he hadn't truly planned to deal with the latter when he came down this time.</p>

      <p>Before Bai Zhe had completely gathered all the power of Outer Dao, Wang Zhen would wait and see for a bit.</p>

      <p>Once Bai Zhe had gathered all this power and forced that thief to use all his strength, Wang Zhen would decide then whether or not to make a move.</p>

      <p>So, his purpose for coming down to the world below this time ...</p>

      <p>Was ostensibly to look for the thief ...</p>

      <p>When it was in fact to escape marriage.</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>Elsewhere, in Beast King's tomb, everyone was still researching ways to open the Heavenly Dao Treasure Box.</p>

      <p>As Devil King had said, the password to open the box was more complicated than they had imagined. Even if they worked together for another ten thousand years, they wouldn't be able to break the code this way. Hence, in the end, their only hope was to destroy the Heavenly Dao Treasure Box by force.</p>

      <p>"Let me try." Finally, Zhuo Yi stared at the box and sighed.</p>

      <p>"You?" Devil King was skeptical.</p>

      <p>Then he saw Zhuo Yi directly kneel to the sky. "Lord Jingke! Grant me strength!"</p>

      <p>Seeing this, Xiao Yin and the others patted their heads. They had almost forgotten that in order to protect Zhuo Yi, Wang Ling had permitted him to summon Jingke in his hour of need - but only once a day.</p>

      <p>And so, when a brown spirit light directly streaked through the sky from afar to reach the tomb, and directly penetrated the mind space, even Devil King couldn't help jumping in fright.</p>

      <p>... What kind of sword was this?</p>

      <p>He couldn't see through it ...</p>

      <p>He couldn't see through it at all ...</p>

      <p>Also, the moment he saw this brown peach wood sword, Devil King somehow unexpectedly had a sense of the senior who had given him the Heavenly Dao Treasure Box back then.</p>

      <p>"Where did this sword come from ... " Devil King asked, and it seemed to Xiao Yin that his voice was trembling.</p>

      <p>As Jingke's number one fan, Luo Chuang looked like a girl who had seen her idol. "Ah ah ah! My Lord Jingke! Lord Jingke! After cutting through this Heavenly Dao Treasure Box, give me a good spanking!"</p>

      <p>But his words were directly ignored by everyone else.</p>

      <p>"This is Lord Jingke, my shifu's exclusive sword," Zhuo Yi said to Devil King as he received Jingke with both hands.</p>
