  <h1>Chapter 271 Do You Know What It Feels Like to Encounter a Bug? </h1>

  <div>

    <p>The scene fell into awkward silence.</p>

    <p>There was a village which lay between Jinghua city and Songhai city. After leaving Songhai city, Boss Tan's brother Tan Qian had gone there directly. The mountain behind the village was called Ninth Boundary Mountain, and there was a modern Taoist temple at the top. This was in fact one of Immortal Mansion's strongholds.</p>

    <p>Given Tan Qian's current level, he didn't know the exact location of Immortal Mansion's headquarters; it was only if he was promoted to chief of the eastern branch that he might be able to discover its location at Immortal Mansion's executive meeting, which was held once every ten years.</p>

    <p>Two days after his return, Tan Qian was able to perfectly suppress his addiction to the Panwu Immortal Martial Arts with the help of the bottle of sleeping pills which Lord Diulei had given him. The Panwu Immortal Martial Arts was originally a forbidden technique which consumed a cultivator's spirit and energy, numbing the body and stimulating its nine orifices to expand through self-hypnosis. The most difficult problem with it was the addiction.</p>

    <p>Indeed, as his brother Tan Siming had said, after Tan Qian stopped cultivating the Panwu Immortal Martial Arts, he could feel his strength diminish significantly, but his mental state was obviously improved.</p>

    <p>Today, after the effects of the sleeping pill wore off, Tan Qian woke up from his deep sleep.</p>

    <p>When he approached the rear court, he heard the chief of the eastern branch swearing inside the room.</p>

    <p>As soon as he entered the room, he straightaway saw a large TV screen and the eastern branch chief sitting in front of it frenziedly operating a game control. "Tan Qian? Good timing! Come and help me see what on earth is wrong with this!"</p>

    <p>Tan Qian stared at the image on the screen, a little baffled. "...This is...?"</p>

    <p>A moment later, his eyes abruptly widened, because he had unexpectedly seen Lord Diulei on the screen!</p>

    <p>Knowing that it was Tan Qian who had entered the room, this chief didn't turn to look at him. "This is the first step in Master's grand plan. Using the secret of the USB combined with the Great Illusion Spell and a spatial magic array, we're currently gathering all known smiths together to find the strongest one! But there are too many spatial dimensions, and Master can't handle all of them, so this one is now in our hands. Using this game control, we can change the settings for this space at any time."</p>

    <p>When he heard this, Tan Qian understood. To put it simply, the eastern branch chief was actually now playing as the deity lord of this space.</p>

    <p>This was obviously a very big deal.</p>

    <p>Tan Qian's view was that as long as Lord Diulei, this "Great Death-Courting Senior" in the cultivation world, was involved, things definitely wouldn't be so simple.</p>

    <p>The eastern branch chief pointed at a fatty on the screen. "Our target this time is this guy. Luo Chuang, owner of Luo Chuang Metalware, was born into a smithing family, and his real strength is nothing to scoff at. But when we opened the space this time, we were careless and also brought this Great Death-Courting Senior in as well. Furthermore, in order to feel out the true strength of the owner of that villa I asked you to investigate the last time, I also sent them a USB."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Instantly, Tan Qian understood... that legendary Ling Zhenren had most likely become involved in this matter.</p>

    <p>Although he had never seen this Ling Zhenren in the flesh, he had seen his spirit sword, which had almost cut him up into salt and pepper mantis shrimp!</p>

    <p>Even if Tan Qian hadn't truly experienced Wang Ling's prowess, he had already known it in his heart at that time.</p>

    <p>This person wasn't simple.</p>

    <p>Tan Qian even felt that Ling Zhenren was stronger than the Master of Immortal Mansion!</p>

    <p>He couldn't help the few drops of cold sweat that broke out on his skin. "Chief, what problem have you run into?"</p>

    <p>The eastern branch chief's face was very black, and could be completely described as scorched earth. "There's been a popular game recently called PUBG. Have you ever played it?"</p>

    <p>Tan Qian: "...Yes, but I'm very bad at it."</p>

    <p>Subsequently, the eastern branch chief became lost in deep thought. He cupped his chin as he pondered for a long time, and then replied, "Now that I'm manipulating this space, I get the feeling that I've come up against an immortal who can pull players, perform headlocks, speed up, and auto-lock on their targets <sup>1</sup> ."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(These are some game cheats used in PUBG..)</dfn>

    <p>Tan Qian: "..."</p>

    <p>The eastern branch chief: "The minions I summoned in the space were wiped out instantly, and the enhanced Voldemorts I created were scared off by the other party to the point that they turned around and ran!"</p>

    <p>Tan Qian: "..."</p>

    <p>The eastern branch chief: "Furthermore, this bunch of people aren't using the standard gameplay in following the plot at all! They're wantonly destroying everything in their path in the space!"</p>

    <p>Tan Qian: "Did Great Death-Courting Senior do all that?</p>

    <p>"It's that person from the villa! The worst thing is that I don't even know who he is!"</p>

    <p>As he spoke, the eastern branch chief switched the view to Wang Ling, and then all Tan Qian saw was a huge mosaicked image on the screen...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At that moment, the Great Shielding Spell was working perfectly.</p>

    <p>In the game space, Wang Ling couldn't help sneezing.</p>

    <p>He had the vague feeling that someone was talking about him behind his back.</p>

    <p>But now wasn't the time to care about something like that. Following the thrust of the plot, Lie Mengmeng led Wang Ling and the others to the ward where the woman's husband had stayed. The array pattern on the wall on the first floor even stretched all the way up here.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei crouched down and gently stroked the pattern as he carefully felt it out. "Brother Ling, this array pattern seems a little different from the one we saw before."</p>

    <p>The miniscule difference couldn't be described in words, and only a cultivator with over one thousand years' worth of cultivation would have been able to perceive it clearly. Large magic arrays were usually designed with the pattern split into sections that might appear chaotic, but which also had a core.</p>

    <p>"This is the core array pattern!" Lord Diulei stared at it with a confident expression. "As long as we cut through the core array pattern, we can at least block this Great Illusion Spell. If we disturb the spatial order, we might be able to get out!"</p>

    <p>"But severing the array pattern won't be easy. This core array was set up by an Itinerant Immortal, so it's bound to be able to restore itself. The best would be to directly cut it off at the root, otherwise it might regenerate." Luo Chuang frowned. "But we don't have anything with us right now. My magic treasures are all in the shop... now that we're trapped in this space, I've lost my connection to them, and I can't summon them directly."</p>

    <p>At that moment, the two individuals swiveled almost in unison to look at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Brother Ling, do you have a solution?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded, his eyes fixed on empty air.</p>

    <p>A moment later, there was a fluctuation which shook the air and the ground.</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang and Lord Diulei were utterly astonished. This sound was too loud! There was an invisible and immense sense of oppression! Furthermore, it was a very familiar aura, and they already knew what was coming!</p>

    <p>Just a few seconds later, the point in the air that Wang Ling was staring at actually split open, and inexhaustible sword qi surged forth, sweeping through the space.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling directly reached into this violently fluctuating crack in the air, and pulled Jingke out from within.</p>
