  <h1>Chapter 613 This Won't Do! It Can't Go on Like This!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Those familiar dead fish eyes made Er Ha's dog fur tremble all over. Furthermore, after it calmed down, Er Ha noticed that Jingke was lying beside Little Master Ling, and the both of them were staring at it in the same position with their heads propped up... Like an old father and his son.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>At that moment, Er Ha in fact instantly already knew.</p>

    <p>Little Master Ling had probably already known earlier on about it going to the demon world and had been thinking of ways to help it secretly. The golden light shield absolutely hadn't been an effect of Lord Ma sending it over, but had been set up by its little master at the very beginning.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, trying to hide this from Little Master Ling had really been a dumb choice.</p>

    <p>"Do, you have, anything, you want to, explain?" Jingke asked as it looked at Er Ha with an expressionless face.</p>

    <p>Er Ha swallowed its saliva. "When did you know..."</p>

    <p>"From, the very, beginning," Jingke answered.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Then..."</p>

    <p>"That's right, we saw, everything, you did, just now," Jingke said. "Ling, likes, to lurk. It's not like, you don't, know that."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>"???" Wang Ling felt that Jingke had definitely been led astray by Shen Wuyue!</p>

    <p>Learning bad things like Shen Wuyue's undermining ways, unfortunately.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling didn't say anything, that didn't mean that he wasn't going to punish Er Ha.</p>

    <p>He decided to give it the cruelest punishment he could think of, for keeping its owner in the dark...</p>

    <p>For the next month, Wang Ling wouldn't walk Er Ha; Er Ha could go walk itself!</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling let Er Ha know this telepathically, it grit its teeth in agony.</p>

    <p>This punishment was indeed very cruel.</p>

    <p>It was too cruel!</p>

    <p>It flew into Wang Ling's arms and cried its dog tears.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Er Ha looked at the time; it had just turned six in the morning.</p>

    <p>It was July 21st on Friday in the thirteenth week of the semester.</p>

    <p>It was time for Little Master Ling to get ready for school.</p>

    <p>While on its trip to the demon world this time, Er Ha had actually expected that its little master might be very angry after it came back. But reality proved that Wang Ling was truly a very gentle person.</p>

    <p>Er Ha couldn't help taking out its diary as it started to write down its experiences from its journey to the demon world last night. Back then, Er Ha had named this diary "Human Observation Diary" and wrote it with the initial intention of promoting peace between the demon world and the human world. Recorded in the diary were the numerous prejudices which Er Ha had held against humans while it had been a demon king, and how these "prejudices" had changed after living in the human world.</p>

    <p>Er Ha wrote down a rough retelling of its experiences from last night from beginning to end.</p>

    <p>Of course, there were two things it didn't put down. One had to do with the secret of Demon Saint's inheritance, and the other was the truth about how Second Generation Demon Saint had assumed the position... These two things were classified. Shen Wuyue that old man couldn't control his mouth, but Er Ha felt that it was quite tight-lipped itself. Some things could be said, and some things not.</p>

    <p>If the diary got out later and other people saw it, there would be no saving Second Generation Demon Saint's face.</p>

    <p>Ah! So tired!</p>

    <p>Writing with a dog paw ultimately wasn't very convenient, and it made Er Ha's paw ache.</p>

    <p>But there was an improvement in every character written down in the diary. From illegible chicken scratch at the beginning to this now beautiful slender gold style <sup>1</sup> , Er Ha actually felt very accomplished!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The "slender gold" style of calligraphy invented by Emperor Huizong refers to how his writing resembled twisted and curved gold filament ..)</dfn>

    <p>It had done it!</p>

    <p>Take a photo! Share with Xiao Yin!</p>

    <p>Er Ha actually also really wanted to show it to Wei Zhi. After all, Wei Zhi was one of the few friends it had in the human world. However, given the restricted contents of the diary, Er Ha thought it wouldn't be very good for Wei Zhi to see it; what if it scared Wei Zhi?</p>

    <p>An image was sent to Xiao Yin not long after that.</p>

    <p>About two minutes later, Er Ha's chat window shook.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "Damn! You went to the demon world! But you hid it from Master! And Master didn't blame you???"</p>

    <p>Er Ha shrugged its shoulders and replied a little smugly, "Perhaps this is the power of the 'first wife'."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "You are our Ling Ling's second contract beast. Actually, I've always said to Little Master Ling that he has to be fair in his treatment, but unfortunately he likes to pamper me alone... what can I do? I also feel very helpless! Maybe it's because I'm cuter... I don't eat so much and I'm pleasing to the eye, and at night, I'm an environmentally friendly fluorescent night light that's easy on the eyes. I'm small in size and easy to take around, and I'm essential for the home or travel. Look at you, you're so big in your beast form, you're not cost-effective at all!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin felt attacked.</p>

    <p>Consumed by envy at Er Ha's words, he directly punched a hole in the sofa.</p>

    <p>This wouldn't do! He couldn't go on like this!</p>

    <p>"Thunder, Thunder!!" Xiao Yin couldn't help yelling.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was really very busy. He hadn't been idle these two days, and had been investigating President Bai who was still on the run. Furthermore, another mysterious person had uploaded a scoop on the cultivation forum not long ago claiming that there was internal chaos in the foreign power which President Bai was associated with, Night Chief.</p>

    <p>A president named Edmark had been killed in a long-range attack and had died on the spot... the cause of his death was an unknown spherical magic weapon.</p>

    <p>And Lord Diulei had specially looked up information on this Edmark.</p>

    <p>He was the first leader brought in when the organization Night Chief had first been set up, and he was the head of the current six generals of Night Chief! Although Night Chief's hierarchy didn't have a deputy leader position, Edmark's overall strength and seniority was already at this level. It could be said that under Night Ghost Spirit Emperor as the captain of this organization, this President Edmark was second only to him and was an outstanding existence.</p>

    <p>But now, Edmark, the head of the six generals, had inexplicably died, which was extremely baffling... Who had done it? Was there someone else watching this foreign force? Were they friend or foe?</p>

    <p>No one knew anything...</p>

    <p>Thunder was thinking this when Xiao Yin started shouting.</p>

    <p>"Brother Xiao, what's wrong?"</p>

    <p>After getting up and going over to Xiao Yin, Lord Diulei saw the big hole in the broccoli sofa and immediately took a deep breath. "Brother Xiao... the cost of this broccoli sofa will be deducted from your living expenses next month, which is a total of five hundred thousand."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei had decided to help Xiao Yin completely rectify his "bad habit" of breaking things when he got excited.</p>

    <p>Hearing how much the sofa cost, Xiao Yin immediately neighed. "This sofa is so ugly, how can it be so expensive?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei's lips twitched. "Have you heard of Raising A Kun?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin bit his finger. "An online game?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "While playing this game, there was a person who made a mistake and kept a corpse of a kun until it decayed. But even though it smelled bad, it tasted good."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei smiled. "The principle applies to this sofa as well: it looks ugly, but it's expensive."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>
