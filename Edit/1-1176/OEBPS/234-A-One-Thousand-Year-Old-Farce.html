  <h1>Chapter 234 A One-Thousand-Year Old Farce </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was supposed to be an incomparable showdown a thousand years in the making and one for the history books, but no one could have expected that it would happen in such a situation.</p>

    <p>The old devil was confined to the six-pointed star array of the Five Elements Great Array. The center of the city in this small world was shrouded in a colorful haze. Secretary Dakang, Zhuo Yi, the six headmasters as well as the students hiding in the buildings were all witnesses to this showdown.</p>

    <p>Of course, neither the old Secretary nor the six headmasters would choose to interfere as they were well aware of the feud between these two.</p>

    <p>This confrontation was simpler than Wang Ling had imagined. From a distance, he watched as a dull-colored sword light appeared in General Yi's palm.</p>

    <p>This was the unique technique which had made General Yi famous — the Palm Sword.</p>

    <p>Back then, one of the old devil's vital points had been hit by this Palm Sword in a final strike, and the surveillance chip which Wang Ming had invented had been planted in the old devil's soul, where it had remained for a thousand years.</p>

    <p>"Old Yi, your Palm Sword really makes me nostalgic." The old devil sneered. Now that it had come to this, what did he have to be afraid of? Red mist and a purple cloud appeared in his hand and condensed together into several purple-black magic balls which hovered in his palm.</p>

    <p>Chaos Ball. This was the technique which had made the old devil famous.</p>

    <p>Neither of their techniques was the kind of great spell that had cool and dazzling special effects which filled the sky. Conversely, these types of spells could be cast and used in an attack at any time. In fact, the Palm Sword and the Chaos Ball were very similar in nature. They were not spells with special effects, but the kind that could create a powerful destructive force with minimal light effects.</p>

    <p>However, these two simple-looking spells couldn't be learned by just anyone. Extremely delicate manipulation skills and acute mental focus were required to compress spirit energy that densely in the palm of one's hand.</p>

    <p>At that moment, each of them was wielding their famous technique.</p>

    <p>But the outcome of this battle had already been decided.</p>

    <p>The power which the old devil could release was really too limited given the confinement of the Five Elements Great Array and the fact that he had yet to return to his peak strength.</p>

    <p>General Yi wasn't using all of his strength since there was absolutely no need for him to do so.</p>

    <p>As things stood, even just half of his strength was already enough for him to take the old devil down.</p>

    <p>After their respective techniques had solidified, they eyed each other for a while.</p>

    <p>A minute later, General Yi attacked first.</p>

    <p>The Palm Sword in his hand slashed through the air. Instantly the sky changed, and an invisible wave rolled overhead, creating tremors for one hundred li around and spreading to the ends of the small world.</p>

    <p>The white shadow in exercise clothes closed in on the old devil, whose eyes couldn't follow him at all given that his realm wasn't on the same level and imprisoned as he was in the Five Elements Great Array.</p>

    <p>All he could do now was rely on his intuition.</p>

    <p>Given their countless confrontations in the past, the two men had a certain level of understanding of each other's attack pattern.</p>

    <p>The old devil raised his hand and blocked the blow with difficulty.</p>

    <p>The Palm Sword collided with the Chaos Ball, producing a great roar, and the powerful vibration directly made him spray a mouthful of blood.</p>

    <p>In the end, he had been able to fend off the attack, but it had cost him eight hundred years of cultivation.</p>

    <p>The Palm Sword's wave was like an electric current that pierced his body, making his entrails twitch. His knees were trembling, but he clenched his teeth and tried to remain standing.</p>

    <p>"Old Yi..."</p>

    <p>Blood oozed from the old devil's mouth, turning it red.</p>

    <p>At this moment, even though the old devil was wearing Jiang Liuyue's body, it was as if everyone could see the old devil's past figure.</p>

    <p>He had always been a man who never gave up; no matter how grievously he had been wounded, he would never fall, and would stubbornly remain standing.</p>

    <p>Clashing again after one thousand years, the old devil had already lost his ability to fight in just one collision.</p>

    <p>General Yi's Palm Sword also dispersed, and he didn't call it up again as he slowly walked to the old devil and looked at him. "You have always been like this. If you had pleaded guilty earlier back then, the disciple you were most proud of, Immortal She Pi, wouldn't have been struck by thunder and lightning for ten years before being executed under Leifeng Pagoda..."</p>

    <p>"My venerable self only wants to find her, where is the crime in that?" The old devil covered his chest and sneered.</p>

    <p>"Resurrection is against heaven's laws. Acting against heaven never ends well."</p>

    <p>General Yi narrowed his eyes. "And you should know very clearly that a genuine method of resurrection doesn't exist in this world."</p>

    <p>"Of course my venerable self knows that!"</p>

    <p>The old devil growled, "That's why my venerable self is hoping to find her reincarnation! I heard that the wheel of time in Huaxiu's National Palace might be able to find the reincarnation of a specific person..."</p>

    <p>When General Yi heard this, he was startled. "So, the Gua Pi Army that you assembled a thousand years ago to invade the palace wasn't a rebellion, but for the sake of this wheel of time?"</p>

    <p>"Rebellion? That was never my intention..." The old devil smiled bitterly. "The wheel of time is my true objective! Back then she was already fading quickly, and my venerable self could only fight for her with everything I had! But unfortunately, I stormed the palace only to find that it was empty, and then I knew that it had been a trap."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>The old devil's account made the people in and outside the small world fall silent.</p>

    <p>After a long time, General Yi sucked in a deep breath. "So, you did all that for your wife?"</p>

    <p>"Otherwise?"</p>

    <p>The old devil rolled his eyes.</p>

    <p>Outside the small world, the headmasters and Secretary Dakang couldn't help the way their faces twitched. This bag of dog food was completely unexpected <sup>1</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Following on from the
description of a single person
as a 'single dog' in colloquial
Chinese, being force fed 'dog
food' means being forced to
endure PDA ..)</dfn>

    <p>Seeing the speechless expression on the face of the elder with the hedgehog head in front of him, the old devil immediately said suspiciously, "Don't tell me the wheel of time doesn't exist at all..."</p>

    <p>"No, don't worry, it is indeed real..."</p>

    <p>The corners of General Yi's mouth couldn't help twitching. "What I wanted to say is... although it's a banned artifact, if it's a special case, you can submit a report and go through the management process to apply to use it..."</p>

    <p>The old devil: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Of course the process is very troublesome..." General Yi was silent for a bit before saying, "However, given your realm when you were at your peak and your status in the cultivation circle before you established the Gua Pi Army, it's definitely likely that your application to use it will go through, as long as you perform some meritorious deeds for the country."</p>

    <p>The old devil: "..."</p>

    <p>It was now silent on the scene.</p>

    <p>After being embroiled in a thousand years of fighting, it turned out that he had been shooting himself in the foot all this time. This was an outcome that no one would feel good about.</p>

    <p>Hands propped on his knees, the old devil laughed bitterly and lamented the feeling of fate messing around with him.</p>

    <p>General Yi looked at him and said unsympathetically, "If you agree to come with me and be put on trial — and beg me on your knees while you're at it — this old man can act on your behalf to turn the wheel of time and find her reincarnation for you..."</p>

    <p>"I beg you."</p>

    <p>The old devil stared at General Yi with sparkling eyes.</p>

    <p>He didn't kneel, but he said the words without the slightest bit of hesitation.</p>
