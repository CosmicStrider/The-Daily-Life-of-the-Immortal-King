  <h1>Chapter 523 Immortal Zhenyuan Makes a Very Important Decision! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>A grade eleven spell was already a major lethal weapon that could annihilate planets - Immortal Zhenyuan couldn't imagine how powerful a grade twelve spell would be.</p>

    <p>The main reason why he hadn't been able to subdue Wind Spirit and completely destroy him was because the dark energy would double Wind Spirit's strength when he was in berserker mode.</p>

    <p>It was hard for Immortal Zhenyuan to defend himself in pure hand-to-hand combat when Wind Spirit was in this state, and he had narrowly missed being injured during some of their fights.</p>

    <p>It had never occurred to the red-haired young man that the dark energy could be combined with a spell to double its strength!</p>

    <p>Worse still, he had never seen the magic that Wind Spirit was using; he had no idea what was going to happen.</p>

    <p>In the distance, the black magic sphere floated in Wind Spirit's palm. Although it was only the size of a glass marble, the red-haired young man frowned at the extremely terrifying energy inside it.</p>

    <p>In the next moment, Wind Spirit moved. He flew higher in the air to look down on them, and the small black sphere that had been floating in his palm flew out into the sky!</p>

    <p>He spread his arms. "Let the world feel pain."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Somehow, Wang Ling felt that this scene was a little familiar, as if he had seen it somewhere before <sup>1</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is a quote by the
character Nagato in the series
"Naruto .. ")</dfn>

    <p>The instant this black magic sphere was absorbed by the dark sky, the thunderclouds that had gathered suddenly settled, and even wisps of air seemed to freeze in place.</p>

    <p>In that moment, Immortal Zhenyuan gazed up at the sky with unseeing eyes.</p>

    <p>He knew that this was the calm before the storm, and that there was enough power in this magic sphere to wipe out everything.</p>

    <p>It was the first time the red-haired young man had encountered a grade twelve spell, and he was shaken by its demonic power. Although a grade eleven spell could destroy a planet, it wasn't powerful enough to seal off a planet's entire space.</p>

    <p>Through his Immortal Eye, Immortal Zhenyuan could see that at that very moment, the entire Drought Star was like a sparrow trapped in a birdcage, covered in layer upon layer of dark energy that was gradually beginning to contract.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was also looking at this scene, but he didn't know exactly what this spell was called.</p>

    <p>It was obvious, however, that this was a type of spell which could use energy to seal off a space, compress it from the outside, and then ultimately cause its core to blow up.</p>

    <p>"The space has been sealed off - Senior Dog, there's no way out for us now!"</p>

    <p>It had been so many years since the fear of death had taken hold of Immortal Zhenyuan, and his heart trembled violently. He had seen so much and encountered countless dangers, but none of them had struck him with a sense of terror as strong as this.</p>

    <p>It had already been a very long time since he had felt this dread - it was a deathly sense of oppression that welled up from the depths of his soul which suffocated him a little.</p>

    <p>"I call this technique Divine Planet Devastation."</p>

    <p>Wind Spirit laughed darkly and a little savagely. "All of you will die today!"</p>

    <p>After Wind Spirit said that, Wang Ling instantly felt his body grow heavier; under the dark energy's pull, the gravitational force on Drought Star increased!</p>

    <p>"Is he pushing us toward the core?" Brow furrowed, Immortal Zhenyuan struggled to maintain his position and stop himself from dropping down.</p>

    <p>In a few short seconds, the gravitational force had swiftly increased a dozen times over.</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan couldn't help clenching his teeth as he struggled painfully to maintain his footing!</p>

    <p>But at this rate, he would only be able to hold on for two more minutes at the most.</p>

    <p>It was as Wind Spirit had said; Immortal Zhenyuan would undoubtedly die!</p>

    <p>After struggling to brace himself for several dozen seconds, he felt his eyelids grow heavy, and it was very hard to keep his eyes open!</p>

    <p>It seemed that this senior dog truly wasn't the savior of the world after all.</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan couldn't help sighing.</p>

    <p>At that moment, he turned to look at "Senior Dog" next to him. "Senior, I'm very happy to fight you!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan lamented in his heart: he had initially wanted to say something like "I'm very happy to have met you" or "It's been an honor to fight with you."</p>

    <p>But he quickly realized something!</p>

    <p>This senior dog hadn't budged an inch as it floated in the air, and there wasn't the slightest change in its dog expression!</p>

    <p>The important point was that this senior dog's fur was still moving freely! It seemed that it was completely unaffected by the gravitational force!</p>

    <p>Er Ha stretched out one paw to gently poke the red-haired young man next to it, and a ripple spread out from its claw!</p>

    <p>Of course, it was actually the invisible Wang Ling who was casting this spell to restore the gravitational force back to normal!</p>

    <p>No matter how powerful a grade twelve spell was, it couldn't rival a Heavenly Dao!</p>

    <p>Er Ha had deep faith and couldn't be any clearer on how things stood.</p>

    <p>Every single one of the Three Thousand Great Spells which his Little Master Ling had grasped was at level fifteen... How could a grade twelve spell compare with a Heavenly Dao?</p>

    <p>"The gravity... is back to normal?" Immortal Zhenyuan sensed the unbelievable change as the pressure on him instantly vanished!</p>

    <p>With his Immortal Eye, he could see that the sinister energy which enveloped Drought Star hadn't dissipated - this meant that the Divine Planet Devastation hadn't been dispelled!</p>

    <p>The earth had cracked under the gravitational force, and massive pits opened up as the ground gradually collapsed.</p>

    <p>Hm, it seemed that it was the gravitational force on Immortal Zhenyuan's own body that had been adjusted.</p>

    <p>He sucked in a cold breath of air. In this large-scale AOE magic attack, the gravitational force on his body alone had been corrected - once again he was witnessing again how extraordinary this "Senior Dog" was!</p>

    <p>He had actually even doubted this senior dog's true identity as the "savior of the world" just now... that had simply been foolish of him!</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan stared at Er Ha with a face full of excitement.</p>

    <p>At that moment, he made a very important decision!</p>

    <p>If they were victorious in this battle, he would become a diehard dog lover! He would follow senior dog all the way to the apex of cultivation!</p>

    <p>What was going on?</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wind Spirit stared blankly at this scene and couldn't help cocking his head.</p>

    <p>He carefully inspected his activated spell, but there was nothing wrong with it; the Divine Planet Devastation was operating normally. The space was still sealed off, and apart from the spellcaster, no one could escape.</p>

    <p>The Divine Planet Devastation had made Drought Star's gravity several hundred times heavier.</p>

    <p>Wind Spirit had wanted to see what kind of expressions this dog and Zhenyuan would wear when they were pulled down next to the planet's core by that tremendous gravitational force - he had never ever expected this dog to somehow free them of the gravitational effects.</p>

    <p>How had it done it?</p>

    <p>Wind Spirit's gaze grew heavy.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ling was pretty much done analyzing the principle behind the Divine Planet Devastation.</p>

    <p>It was more or less what he had thought earlier: despite the boost from Wind Spirit's dark energy, Heavenly Dao had to be integrated into the Divine Planet Devastation in order to create its explosive force.</p>

    <p>After advancing to Venerated Immortal level, Immortal Zhenyuan might have comprehended two Heavenly Dao, but the crucial point was that he hadn't grasped their essence - this had been the same problem with Evil Sword God previously.</p>

    <p>Since there were Heavenly Dao mixed into this spell, then it was easy.</p>

    <p>Looking upward, Wang Ling searched out the black magic sphere that Wind Spirit had tossed into the air.</p>

    <p>Then, he directly transmitted his voice to these two Heavenly Dao that had been mixed into the magic sphere: "Get lost!"</p>

    <p>In the next moment... the clouds in the sky dispersed...</p>

    <p>Everything was peaceful once more.</p>
