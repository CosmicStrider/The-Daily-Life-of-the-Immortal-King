  <h1>Chapter 174 Always Be on the Alert! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>This preemptive and large-scale anti-terrorist mission conducted by the Independent Regiment had ended in a crushing defeat for Shadow Stream and zero casualties for the local cat regiments. During the mission, Wang Ling's light armor talismans had played a very important role, because many of Shadow Stream's reinforcements had died due to the backlash from the talismans.</p>

    <p>In the luxury condo, Tang Shi, Song Ci and Yuan Qu, these three cat army leaders, were looking at a post-war summary report. It was thanks to prompt handling of the situation, active responses from all divisions, brigades, regiments and local stray cat groups, along with Immortal Meow's backup support, that Zheng Tan had been able to obtain great success in Operation Decapitation this time.</p>

    <p>But in terms of disciplinary behavior, it had absolutely broken the rules. Whether to punish it or not was actually quite a serious issue.</p>

    <p>Tang Shi was struggling with this, since it was the one who had groomed Zheng Tan, after all. It pushed up its glasses and turned to Song Ci and Yuan Qu next to it. "What do the two of you think?"</p>

    <p>Song Ci crossed its arms with a serious expression. "This time, Zheng Tan directly led tens of thousands of cats in an unsanctioned anti-terrorist operation. Based just on this, it wouldn't be too much to dock all its dried fish for the future! However... looking at tactical results alone, Zheng Tan's Independent Regiment had dared to attack Shadow Stream's secret headquarters on its own, preemptively bombarding them with oppressive shellfire which forced these brutal killers into defense mode. That was truly beautifully done! Furthermore, through this operation, every combat unit reaped considerable profits and all the local stray cat groups inadvertently banded together as one on a scale no less than a large-scale anti-terrorist military campaign."</p>

    <p>Yuan Qu unfolded a data map and spread it out on the table. "This is the latest statistics we've just received, come and take a look. This is the increase in cat numbers for the three armies after this battle."</p>

    <p>As soon as Tang Shi caught sight of the incline in the curve, it was completely astounded. "A net increase of eight million cats? Our three armies in total only had two million cats before!"</p>

    <p>Song Ci cupped its chin with its claws. "After this operation, these local cats from tens of different cities wanted to join us. Of course, these are preliminary statistics, and the number is indeed too big. The stray cats in our armies are combat fighters, and they must still go through the selection process. As for the cats that won't be chosen, we'll find suitable shit-shoveling officers to take them in."</p>

    <p>Tang Shi scratched its head. "So many cats... will we be able to manage them? Won't our funds run out?"</p>

    <p>Yuan Qu smiled. "Zheng Tan this guy seized so many supplies from Shadow Stream's headquarters that even after several decades, our three armies still won't have used them up. Along with some one-off magic treasures and antiques, after we go through them and sell off the useless ones, we will definitely have adequate funds!"</p>

    <p>"Mm, that's good."</p>

    <p>Tang Shi nodded. "By the way, what is the situation with that Master of Shadow Stream, Jiang Liuyue?"</p>

    <p>Song Ci: "We all overlooked this Master of Shadow Stream; no one expected the opponent to be so cautious as to use a spirit clay clone as an escape plan. But Immortal Meow has said that for the time being, we don't have to be too wary about this person; after Immortal Meow destroyed her clone, she has lost at least six hundred years' worth of cultivation."</p>

    <p>"Six hundred years, so many?"</p>

    <p>Song Ci chuckled. "This time, she lost six hundred years of cultivation in one go. After a period of time, Zheng Tan's level might well be higher than hers. Zheng Tan is on the rise right now; the rumor is that after receiving personal instruction from Immortal Meow, its realm has skyrocketed."</p>

    <p>"This guy is too impulsive. However, after some refinement, it'll be a simple thing for it to become the backbone of the army." Yuan Qu stroked its cat beard.</p>

    <p>Tang Shi was a little speechless; originally, it had thought that its two brothers would punish Zheng Tan, but they ended up sticking up for it... as expected, it was a wonderful thing to be backed by Immortal Meow!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, right after the end of the matter with the Shadow Stream maiden's prison break, Warden Liang was writing a post-event self-reflection after the conference. This time, thanks to Zhuo Yi, the girl who had been at large had once again been caught in time before she had had any further impact on society. Although he had managed to retain his position as warden, he still had to write a self-reflection.</p>

    <p>Warden Liang had a headache; apart from listing his shortcomings in the self-reflection, he also had to submit a prison reinforcement bill to improve Songhai First Prison's security measures in all aspects in order to prevent something like this from ever happening again.</p>

    <p>After pondering for a long time, Warden Liang sent a message to Zhuo Yi. "Director Zhuo, this is Little Liang. I'm writing my self-reflection now. Regarding the prison reinforcement bill, do you have any ideas?"</p>

    <p>When Zhuo Yi received this message, he almost dropped his phone. Based on government ranks, his position as Director of the General Administration of 100 Schools was on par with the Warden of Songhai First Prison. After the end of the matter with the maiden's prison break, this Warden Liang had started calling himself Little Liang, which made Zhuo Yi feel quite embarrassed.</p>

    <p>Something like a best friend scandal <sup>1</sup> would never happen.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This refers to South Korea's
ex-president Park Geunhye,
who was charged with
corruption and coercion as a
result of collusion with her
close friend.)</dfn>

    <p>Since every department had its own role, Zhuo Yi felt that he had no authority to meddle. Of course, out of courtesy, he couldn't ignore this message.</p>

    <p>A moment later, he was struck by a flash of inspiration as he recalled a face mask that had been a hot online item on Tianmao <sup>2</sup> . He immediately screencapped an image of that shop and sent it to Warden Liang.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(A Chinese shopping website.)</dfn>

    <p>After receiving this screenshot, Warden Liang was stupefied. "Director Zhuo... excuse me, what's this?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi replied, "It's a chatterbox mask. After putting it on, a person will become talkative. If every brother in the prison puts one on, they'll be in high spirits every day, be constantly alert, and never feel sleepy!"</p>

    <p>Warden Liang: "...So reliable? Who is the boss of this shop?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Huang Shaotian <sup>3</sup> ."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(This is a character from the
web novel 'The King's Avatar'
who is well-known for being
an extreme chatterbox.)</dfn>

    <p>Warden Liang: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The next day was Sunday, June 5th. When the old man turned on the news, it was all about Shadow Stream's headquarters being flattened by shellfire.</p>

    <p>All the core Gold Ribbon killers in Shadow Stream's headquarters had been captured. Before Wang Ling had left, he had erased all their memories of the cat army. After these killers had been given cursory medical treatment, they were escorted by a special motorcade to the cultivation police department where they had been interrogated that very night. They could clearly describe the events of the attack on their headquarters, but unfortunately, none of them could recall who had done it.</p>

    <p>The female news broadcaster glanced at the script out of the corner of her eye, then reported with a smile, "Experts from the relevant departments have said that this inability to remember anything is a symptom of being injured by an Yidali Cannon."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>And so, the unknown party that had attacked Shadow Stream's headquarters went down as one of Huaxiu nation's most intriguing unsolved mysteries since its founding. It wasn't just an unsolved mystery for the country, but also raised a lot of doubts and suspicions around the whole world. Some anti-terrorist experts even said that Shadow Stream had been annihilated by aliens!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought that this was half right.</p>

    <p>Because it hadn't been aliens that had annihilated Shadow Stream, but cats <sup>4</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>4</sup>(Aliens in Chinese is
'waixingren' 外星人 and the
Chinese Internet slang for cats
is 'maoxingren' 喵星人 ..)</dfn>
