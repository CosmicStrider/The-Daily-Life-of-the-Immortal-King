  <h1>Chapter 646 Damn! A Heart-Pounding Feeling!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This was already the second time...</p>

    <p>What was it like to be misunderstood by your own mother for the second time?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought it was as embarrassing as spilling drops of yogurt on your pants while drinking it in your room, and then being caught wiping them with a tissue.</p>

    <p>Looking at the bedroom door, Wang Ling felt it was time for him to enlighten it... at the very least, he should add a defense function. It wasn't like Mother Wang didn't usually knock, but sometimes she would forget to do so when she was in a hurry to say something.</p>

    <p>It could only be said that the mothers of the world were by and large like this...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at the girl in gray on his bed, his eyebrows forming a knot.</p>

    <p>This was because he sensed that the identity of this girl in gray was different from that of a human cultivator. When he had touched her gray clothes just now, he couldn't tell what material it was made from. Hence, there were two possibilities: either the material of this gray robe was from outside the Milky Way, or it was a resource from a prehistoric era that was already extinct...</p>

    <p>In both cases, there was only one way for Wang Ling to find out about the material's origin â€” that was to set up an array to summon the "Heavenly Dao" for information.</p>

    <p>Did he have to give away crispy noodle snacks again...</p>

    <p>Speaking of which, the box of baked gluten-flavored crispy noodle snacks which he had gotten specially made previously seemed to be en route to him now.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling frowned and sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>Heavenly Dao: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was July 22nd on Saturday in the thirteenth week of the semester.</p>

    <p>It was already the next morning by the time Immortal Toya arrived. He had initially planned to set off from Chrysanthemum Island the night before. After all, this was a command from Ling Zhenren, so he utterly didn't dare disregard it. In the end, it just so happened that his two disciples, Jin Shi and Yin Shi, had an extracurricular seminar at cram school.</p>

    <p>After this brother and sister pair came to the island as Immortal Toya's disciples and received personal training from him, their damaged spirit roots were completely restored. During their last thirteen years on the island, the siblings learned a lot of knowledge and life principles from Immortal Toya. However, it wasn't good for them to live isolated from the outside world for so long.</p>

    <p>Jin Shi and Yin Shi were still very young, and now that they had reached a stage where they could absorb new things fairly quickly, Immortal Toya had decided to help the siblings find a cram school in the city so that they could interact more with other kids.</p>

    <p>Time continued to march forward and science and technology continued to advance... In this era, even alchemy furnaces saw new developments as some people even used the pots for hot pot to refine pills in! This was a newly developed automatic hot pot-style alchemy furnace which Immortal Toya had only just seen recently. As long as you plugged it in, and put in the right proportions of medicinal ingredients to stew, it was too easy!</p>

    <p>The most terrifying thing was that this alchemy furnace had been designed by a college student! Later, he directly sold the patent and became rich!</p>

    <p>It could only be said that every generation had its own talents... Young people always had new and unique ideas.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya had always been confident in Jin Shi and Yin Shi's gifts.</p>

    <p>Thus, he decided to send the pair to the city for experience.</p>

    <p>After all, times had changed...</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya couldn't help feeling a little emotional.</p>

    <p>In the very early days, it was the city kids who braved the rugged countryside for experience. But it was obviously unwise to fall behind in the times. Rural kids also needed to find ways to experience life in the city.</p>

    <p>Chrysanthemum Island actually had a lot of black technology, but in the end this was just the tip of the iceberg!</p>

    <p>Thus, he took his two precious apprentices to their extracurricular seminar at cram school and wasn't able to go over to Wang Ling's place right away.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling wasn't in a hurry. After all, the girl was just in a coma and her life wasn't in danger.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya drove a wooden vehicle, which had a very special name: Wooden Ox.</p>

    <p>The name sounded very stupid, but the truth was that it was quite fast. The car had special custom-made machinery combined with modern technology, and had the same function as a triphibian car: when necessary, it could turn into a mechanical bird to fly in the sky, a mechanical whale that acted like a submarine, or a mechanical dolphin that acted like a speedboat!</p>

    <p>"I'm taking you out today since I have something to do, and I want you to familiarize yourself with the city. Given your temperaments, I'm sure you won't clash with other people in the city, but we also can't let them bully our Chrysanthemum Island people, understand? When it's time to fight back, you must fight back," Immortal Toya reminded Jin Shi and Yin Shi as they sat in the back while he prepared to start "Wooden Ox."</p>

    <p>"Yes, shifu," Jin Shi and Yin Shi replied in unison. "But when is it time to fight back?"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya was stumped; it was difficult to determine something like this, which was also one reason why he wanted this pair of siblings to experience life in the city for a while.</p>

    <p>To be a pure and kind-hearted child nowadays was admittedly a good thing, but if you wanted to survive... a heart that was too benevolent was sure to suffer.</p>

    <p>These two siblings had already suffered much in their lives...</p>

    <p>Alchemists generally paid close attention to the calm in their hearts, and didn't get angry too easily.</p>

    <p>Jin Shi and Yin Shi had been with him for many years. Although they might not have had as much contact with elixirs as those old alchemists in the market, these children had been exposed to pill refinement since childhood, and had completely different temperaments.</p>

    <p>Thus, Immortal Toya's reply to their question was: "You can fight back if you feel angry. Remember not to kill the other party, but leave them alive. It'll make it easier for me to save their lives."</p>

    <p>"Alright, shifu." The siblings exchanged smiles.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>As Immortal Toya hurried over to the Wang family's small villa, Wang Ling made a video call to Daoist Guang to ask about the gray Daoist robe which the girl wore.</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang's live streaming business had been flourishing recently and his average viewer numbers had just broken the twenty million milestone not long ago, which brought huge traffic to the website.</p>

    <p>He had been just about to start his live stream when Wang Ling called him in the morning.</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang looked attentively at the photo Wang Ling had sent him and then shook his head. "Senior Ling, I won't lie, this humble one is very stupid; I can't tell what this gray Daoist robe is made of at all..." Daoist Guang had truly studied it very carefully even though he hadn't held out any hope since the beginning; how high was Ling Zhenren's realm? If he couldn't determine the robe's origin, what could Daoist Guang do? He was also full of despair!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded his head.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, he still had to ask the Heavenly Dao about it in the end...</p>

    <p>"Senior Ling, while I can't tell what this Daoist robe is made of, I wonder if senior knows the origin of the clothes I'm wearing?" Daoist Guang smiled a little, and then the camera zoomed out all the way. Only then did Wang Ling see that Daoist Guang was no longer wearing that white Daoist garment, but a full maid's outfit!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang scratched his grizzled hair. "This is a flag I put up for myself a while ago: I said that as long as my audience numbers break twenty million, I'll crossdress. Later, based on online images, I used the island's resources to make this dress - the audience's taste now is becoming stranger and stranger. What does Ling Zhenren think?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's reply: "Damn!"</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang: "Is it a heart-pounding feeling?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "It's the feeling of a heart attack..."</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang: "..."</p>
