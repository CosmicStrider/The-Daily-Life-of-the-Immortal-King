  <h1>Chapter 196 Godly Thunder Inheritance </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was an unprecedented and grand event at the entrance of the barbecue shop. There were so many people that it simply felt like the air was boiling.</p>

    <p>The barbecue shop waiters were so busy that even the staff in charge of queue numbers at the door had started to carry trays of drinks to serve the customers in line.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that this would be a waste of time. Judging by the flow of customers, they wouldn't even reach the shop while in line before Dharmaraja finished his work.</p>

    <p>But just then, a girl suddenly came over from the front of the queue and extended an invitation to Immortal Toya with some embarrassment.</p>

    <p>This girl was from a girl group that had been expressly invited to dance at the Xiao Family Compound. However, several of the group members had something else on for the moment today, which directly led to a few seats becoming available.</p>

    <p>Initially, it wasn't a big deal that there were fewer people. However, this girl standing in the crowd had turned her head to look behind her, and had suddenly noticed two "little darlings" standing toward the rear of the crowd.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya didn't say anything and just smiled slightly as he stood with his arms crossed; just like that, they had been inexplicably invited by a girl from a girl group to make up table numbers.</p>

    <p>There were now hundreds of people waiting in line. Even if they were now waiting for a table to accommodate their numbers, Wang Ling still thought that it would never reach their turn.</p>

    <p>However, he was now of half a mind to take back his previous "What was the use of being good-looking" remark...</p>

    <p>Sure enough, in an era which emphasized looks, everything was fleeting! Only attractiveness was king!</p>

    <p>Even though they no longer had to line up, Wang Ling felt a little out of place; he admitted that he was actually more of a lone wolf, and it felt a little strange to eat with people he didn't know, especially strangers whom he hadn't even chatted with online before.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, Wang Ling could admit that these girls were all very cute. Including Wang Ling and Immortal Toya, there were ten of them in total, and a waiter brought them to a private room. A young girl in a black miniskirt and with eyes so big that they could provoke a person introduced herself. "You can call me Bamboo, I'm the vice-captain of the group."</p>

    <p>Initially there had been twelve people in the group who were supposed to come for the barbecue, but now four were out. Because they would be putting on a performance, the barbecue expenses would be directly written off by the Xiao Family Compound... so in theory, the vouchers in Wang Ling and Immortal Toya's hands were no longer of any use as they could completely freeload off someone else.</p>

    <p>After entering the room, Wang Ling moved to sit in one corner with an expressionless face.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "Sorry, everyone, this senior isn't good at talking..."</p>

    <p>Bamboo shook her head. "It's fine, we were the ones who invited you to join us. Eat whatever you like, just help yourselves."</p>

    <p>Several people passed the menu around in order. When it was Wang Ling's turn, a spirit light glowed in his hand and a plastic bag emerged.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "Senior, this is..." He had seen this plastic bag before!</p>

    <p>This was the Chinese soup dumpling-flavored crispy noodle snacks which the old man had prepared previously, and which Wang Ling had held on to until now.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was thinking that he had finally found an opportunity to eat them today; after grilling them a bit, he could even eat them nice and warm!</p>

    <p>Without saying a word, Wang Ling straightaway put the crispy noodle snacks on the hot plate one by one; very soon, the aroma of the crispy noodle snacks which were specially made by the old man filled the air.</p>

    <p>After several of the girls from the girl group smelled the tear-provoking Chinese soup dumpling-flavored crispy noodle snacks, tears gradually started to well up in their eyes.</p>

    <p>"Ladies, what's wrong?" Immortal Toya was at a bit of a loss when he saw their red eyes.</p>

    <p>Bamboo blew her nose, her big eyes already brimming with tears. "I don't know either..."</p>

    <p>The aroma couldn't be described; unexpectedly, it could make a person recall the taste of their mother's cooking!</p>

    <p>And so, even before the barbecue in the private room had officially started, everyone inside apart from Wang Ling were wiping their tears.</p>

    <p>The most terrifying thing was that the aroma gradually permeated the entire barbecue restaurant, and everyone present burst into tears...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>By the time Dharmaraja was finished with his work, it was already nearly one o'clock in the afternoon and later than Immortal Toya had imagined.</p>

    <p>Saying goodbye to Bamboo, Immortal Toya and Wang Ling left the barbecue restaurant. Immortal Toya's eyes were still red. Just now in the restaurant, he had been researching how to use spirit energy to seal his tear ducts. In reality, this had proven very difficult to carry out. It was just like bending your fingers; some people could bend them to an inconceivable degree, while some just couldn't do it even when they tried bending their fingers to the point of almost snapping them off.</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja had sent Immortal Toya a message, and the two people headed for the Xiao Family Compound's Public Service Center.</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja was the office director of the service center's services department.</p>

    <p>When they entered the office after knocking at the door, Wang Ling saw a slightly plump man with black slicked-back hair sitting inside. He was drenched in sweat, and a pair of goggles still hung around his neck; he used these to prevent the bright light of the godly thunder inheritance from blinding him.</p>

    <p>"Brother Toya?" Dharmaraja stood up from his chair and looked at Immortal Toya with pleasant surprise.</p>

    <p>The two individuals had met offline before and had even drunk together a few times; they could already be considered drinking buddies.</p>

    <p>Lightning Dharmaraja turned to look at the silent Wang Ling and saluted him with clasped fists. "This has to be Senior Ling? Senior Ling truly looks younger than I had imagined..."</p>

    <p>Like most people, when Lightning Dharmaraja saw Wang Ling for the first time, he had an inexplicable feeling; a man with power so great he was like a monster could actually be this young and possess such enduring vitality of the body... this maintenance was a bit too good!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling also didn't do more than nod in greeting before he straightaway took out the broken fragments of the ancient magic blade.</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja instantly frowned.</p>

    <p>"What is it?" Immortal Toya asked.</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja picked up a magnifying glass from the table to scrutinize the magic blade. "Well... I just feel that the blade's damage is far more serious than it had looked in the photo. The break is uneven and it would be a little difficult to weld the pieces together."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "Can it be fixed?"</p>

    <p>"Of course it can. Give me two days, I'll take it back and do it properly." At this point, Lightning Dharmaraja turned his gaze to Wang Ling. "However, I have a small request."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya had a bad feeling. "What are you trying to do? Senior Ling is a very busy person!"</p>

    <p>Lightning Dharmaraja: "Brother Toya, rest assured, I'm not trying to steal your boyfriend."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "..."</p>

    <p>Lightning Dharmaraja didn't beat around the bush either and simply cut to the chase. "I've already heard of Senior Wang's prowess since before, and I have the honor of being able to meet Senior Wang today, so I hope senior can grant my unreasonable request..."</p>

    <p>"You want to compare battle notes with Senior Ling?" Immortal Toya was shocked. After all, this was a man who could crush an ancient magic blade with his bare hands.</p>

    <p>"Let's forget about comparing notes... I know that in terms of sheer strength, there is no way I can win against Senior Ling. That's why I hope instead that senior can stand still and let me punch him. I would like to test the full extent of the power of the godly thunder inheritance." Dharmaraja nodded and appeared very confident.</p>

    <p>Up until now, no one had been able to remain absolutely motionless after enduring a punch wrapped in his godly thunder inheritance!</p>
