  <h1>Chapter 838 Mo Immortal Castle's Bait-and-Hook</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Everyone knew that before Mo Immortal Castle was officially absorbed into the Office of Strategic Deception's intelligence team, it had been the largest underground intelligence network in Songhai city, and was famous in the industry for selling information on the cultivation world... Of course, before Mo Immortal Castle was absorbed, Lord Diulei and several of the major team leaders at the Office of Strategic Deception's management level discovered a very important pattern.</p>

    <p>They realized that any organization that bought intelligence from Mo Immortal Castle was ultimately caught...</p>

    <p>So after discussion, everyone felt that Mo Immortal Castle couldn't withdraw from their base in Songhai city even though it had officially been absorbed into the Office of Strategic Deception, and that their underground information business should continue. Of course, this was on the basis that everything proceeded under the strict joint surveillance of the Office of Strategic Deception and Huaxiu Alliance; what intelligence could be disclosed and what could not, and whether the intelligence could be sold - it would be the Office of Strategic Deception that made the final decision.</p>

    <p>The intelligence sold would be a lure for catching big fish so that Huaxiu Alliance could crack down further on the dark forces.</p>

    <p>But this situation couldn't last long. Most people had no idea about Mo Immortal Castle being absorbed into the Office of Strategic Deception, but no one could guarantee that this fact would never come to light. Once that happened, they would no longer be able to use this bait-and-hook approach.</p>

    <p>So before that, they had to at least catch a few big fish.</p>

    <p>The Dark Network's founder and several major dark force leaders were currently still at large, and were key targets whom Huaxiu Alliance had issued bounties for among the light forces.</p>

    <p>After the close of the incident with Ultimate King of Killers, General Yi and the others had a feeling that this year might be the most fruitful one yet. Thanks to Ultimate King of Killers's influential position in the Dark Network as well as among the dark forces, his end was bound to have a major impact on the whole underground Dark Network and the dark forces network.</p>

    <p>Of course, rice could only be eaten one mouthful at a time, a road traveled one step at a time, and characters written one stroke at a time.</p>

    <p>All this was work that could only unfold slowly.</p>

    <p>It was August 12th on Saturday in the fifteenth week of the semester.</p>

    <p>It was the second day of the first semester final exams at Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>Countdown to the end of the semester: one day.</p>

    <p>Countdown to Wang Ling's high school graduation: roughly 500 days.</p>

    <p>(Countdown to the end of this novel... depends on the author's mood...)</p>

    <p>Guo Hao wasn't in a good mood after the exams today, and almost seemed a little depressed.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "Screwed up?"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "Shut up!"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "..."</p>

    <p>Recently, Guo Hao realized that Chen Chao's mouth seemed a little blessed.</p>

    <p>If someone else said that he screwed up, Guo Hao would just take it as a joke, but when Chen Chao opened his mouth, Guo Hao instantly panicked.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao raised his hands in surrender. "I was wrong... bro... You did great in the exams! Over 90 in all your subjects!"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao breathed a sigh of relief. "Great! It's all good, all good..."</p>

    <p>But on second thought, Guo Hao felt something wasn't right... They were using the 150-marks system now!</p>

    <p>Dammit!</p>

    <p>This milk mouth <sup>1</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(From the popular Chinese
buzzword "poisonous milk" in
games, which refers to how
the more someone is
encouraged, the more likely
they'll lose ..)</dfn>

    <p>Guo Hao put his hand over his heart, instantly feeling like he had a heart attack.</p>

    <p>When he played his game tonight, don't tell him his keyboard would also spill milk?</p>

    <p>Guo Hao sighed. "I have an uncle I'm close to, who actually isn't very old, but his family is forcing him to get married... Don't you think that sucks?"</p>

    <p>Su Xiao asked, "How does your uncle feel about it?"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "Of course he doesn't want to! He hasn't played enough; it's so free, being a single man! Why does he have to settle down so early?"</p>

    <p>"Why are you unhappy that your uncle is being forced to get married? Don't tell me..."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao took a deep breath. "Are you... Geez! I always thought you were straight!"</p>

    <p>"Nonsense! Of course I'm straight! I'm unhappy because my pocket money has always been from this uncle! If he gets married, it's likely my pocket money will be given to his girlfriend!" Guo Hao sighed. "I just used the pocket money he gave me to buy <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> two days ago... If he gets a girlfriend in the future, who'll buy me games?!"</p>
    
    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>This reasoning made too much sense!</p>

    <p>"And that's not the worst part." Guo Hao frowned. "Have you heard? That Net rehab center that was shut down two years ago is actually still open... It's now a correction and recuperation center for abnormal behavior. My uncle told me his family was planning to send him there."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao was dazed. "No way... they're sending him there over something this small?"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "A lot of people are sent there over trivial things..."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "Your poor uncle!"</p>

    <p>"I'm having coffee with my uncle after school today so that he can complain to me. I'll leave first later, then you can have a look at my unlucky uncle from behind after that." At that point, Guo Hao suddenly turned his gaze to Wang Ling. "Actually, my uncle looks a little like Wang Ling."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "Which part?"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "Dead fish eyes..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "That's why when I first met Wang Ling at the beginning of the semester, he gave me a comforting and familiar feeling!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After the exams that day, nothing was planned and everyone went home. Since Guo Hao's uncle was looking for him to give vent to his grievances, Guo Hao left first. There were always people at the heart of a party who controlled the pace and brightened up the atmosphere.</p>

    <p>This had always been Guo Hao's role.</p>

    <p>So, no Guo Hao, no party...</p>

    <p>Thus, there was nothing on today.</p>

    <p>Everyone went back home to their mothers... mm, actually, Wang Ling was pretty happy about it.</p>

    <p>He had almost died of embarrassment at KTV yesterday.</p>

    <p>At the school gate, Wang Ling along with Chen Chao and Su Xiao saw the young man who was being pressured to get married.</p>

    <p>Just like Guo Hao had said, his uncle was quite young and was a very sunny and charming guy. The most important thing was that, just as Guo Hao had said, this young man did indeed have a pair of dead fish eyes that was very much like Wang Ling's - it was just that he didn't have quite the same bearing...</p>

    <p>It seemed this "uncle" was a bit of a crybaby. When he saw Guo Hao come out, the rims of his eyes went red, and he hastily put on sunglasses he had prepared.</p>

    <p>What a pitiful person...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed.</p>

    <p>Parting with Chen Chao and Su Xiao at a fork in the road, Wang Ling was walking with his head down when he was suddenly blocked by two huge figures.</p>

    <p>One of them looked down at the picture in his hand and asked the other man, "Is that him?"</p>

    <p>The other person: "Yeah, dead fish eyes, no mistake! Take him!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "???"</p>

    <p>The two men then grabbed Wang Ling's arms and dragged him into a van...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling guessed that this bunch was probably from the Net rehab center Guo Hao had been talking about earlier.</p>

    <p>It was just that these two dumbasses had probably mistaken him for someone else...</p>

    <p>Hm...</p>

    <p>These guys had guts...</p>
