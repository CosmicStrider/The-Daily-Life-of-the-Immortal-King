  <h1>Chapter 719 The Four Big Families Of Songhai City</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Well...</p>

    <p>Wasting food indeed wasn't good behavior, but the problem was that this student acted as if they knew each other!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling watched as the other party directly swallowed his braised Dahuan pill. This person let out a soft burp and then took a silver handkerchief out of his pocket to wipe his mouth lightly with the elegance of a lady of the capital... It seemed he was full.</p>

    <p>After a long while, the person straightened and fixed his eyes on Wang Ling. "It's wrong to waste food. This classmate doesn't seem to have an appetite, but I don't think it's because the food here isn't to your taste - it's probably because you have something on your mind, right? And I can see that this classmate must be upset about what happened recently."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming and Wang Ling were surprised since what he said was pretty accurate...</p>

    <p>"As for this braised Dahuan pill, I won't owe you. I, Li Mingyao, have never liked owing anyone anything." The very graceful young man declared who he was, and then looked at Wang Ling. "Hm... Go ahead, what level skill book do you want? Level one to level three, I have them all."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Wang Ming: "..."</p>

    <p>"It's fine if you can't think of any right now. There's a spell app called 'Cool Collection of Four <sup>1</sup> ,' do you know it? You can download it. It has level one to level three skills. Go through them and pick one, I can be your sponsor and help you get it," Li Mingyao said.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Adapted from the Siku
Quanshu, a translation of
which has been given as
"Imperial Collection of Four"
and which is the largest
collection of books in Chinese
history ..)</dfn>

    <p>Neither Wang Ling nor Wang Ming had absolutely any interest in a petty low-level skill book at all...</p>

    <p>After all, a random yawn from Wang Ling was likely a lot more lethal than these low-level skill books.</p>

    <p>However, a person who could freely use a skill book to return a favor certainly didn't have a simple identity.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming pondered this person's name carefully.</p>

    <p>Li Mingyao...</p>

    <p>Somehow, the name sounded a little familiar.</p>

    <p>It was a pity he wasn't in his lab now, otherwise Wang Ming could directly use the official database to specially bring up information on this person.</p>

    <p>"You don't have to doubt my identity, I'm not a bad guy."</p>

    <p>However, Li Mingyao seemed to enjoy this kind of skeptical look. "I often use skill scrolls in an exchange, so it's just a basic operation for me. You may not know this, but there's a limited supply of this braised Dahuan pill as a main course in the canteen, so I believe that it isn't a bad deal to return the favor with a level one or three skill scroll and get to know you guys while I'm at it."</p>

    <p>This intense business way of thinking jarred Wang Ming's brain all of a sudden.</p>

    <p>He gave Li Mingyao an abrupt stare. "Are you from the Li family?"</p>

    <p>"This teacher seems well informed." Li Mingyao smiled and said, "Among the four big families in Songhai city, my Li family's online skills store chain is known all over the country, but few people know my identity as the young master of the Li family."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't really care about the four big families of Songhai, but Wang Ming was well aware who they were.</p>

    <p>Among the four big families of Songhai, Li Mingyao's Li family had built their family fortune by purchasing the copyrights of various spells and selling them through online collaborative revenue sharing.</p>

    <p>In addition to the Li family who built their business on skills, the other three big families were the Zhou family whose main business was crafting artifacts, the Lin family and their spirit beast business, and the Sun family which manufactured pills. Currently, the representative of the Sun family's young generation was Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>These four families absolutely dominated in these fields in the current cultivator consumer market, and since going commercial, their success had continued to snowball. In Songhai city, the market was now evenly split between these four big families, who were on equal footing.</p>

    <p>Anyone familiar with this circle would know how amazing the four big families of Songhai were...</p>

    <p>Especially before the nation's capital had moved from Songhai to Jinghua back then, the four big families had held the balance of power in Songhai city... But that was something that had happened hundreds of years ago, before Wang Ling was born.</p>

    <p>What a big family paid attention to was their history.</p>

    <p>Thus, even though a lot of time had already passed and the four families in Songhai city were already no longer as influential as before, they had taken the business route and relied on their core elements to each seize a share of the market; this alone made other people feel far inferior to them.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling carefully sized up this elegant youngster called Li Mingyao in front of him.</p>

    <p>It turned out he had run into a super rich second generation kid like Sun Rong today...</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect you to be the young master of the Li family. My apologies." Wang Ming laughed and his heart was unperturbed.</p>

    <p>This was something Li Mingyao probably never expected.</p>

    <p>The truth was that using the family resources which he had on hand to develop networks and trade resources was a very smart strategy. Regular people found it very hard to resist this sugar-coated bullet. However, this was utterly wasted on Wang Ling and Wang Ming these two brothers.</p>

    <p>Level three skills...</p>

    <p>In Wang Ling's opinion, they weren't as useful as crispy noodle snacks.</p>

    <p>Because of the impact from being given his family resources since he was a kid, Li Mingyao had encountered all sorts of people, and so was especially good at reading a person's words or actions. Honestly speaking, he never thought he would ever receive the kind of cold treatment that he was getting today.</p>

    <p>Logically speaking, Number 60 High was just a key city high school candidate... it could be said that the overall quality of their students was far below that of Remnant High students, but this student and teacher were unexpectedly completely unmoved by his bait?</p>

    <p>Li Mingyao was a little baffled...</p>

    <p>Actually, eating that Dahuan pill hadn't been his real intention. He had eaten the other party's pill to find an excuse to return the favor with a skill, and then ask him something he was interested in.</p>

    <p>Who would have thought that this plan had actually failed...</p>

    <p>The other party was just a Foundation Establishment student, surely Li Mingyao didn't have to go as far as an exchange with a level four skill?</p>

    <p>It wasn't like he couldn't, but level four... Li Mingyao acknowledged that he himself couldn't learn level four skills. If he wanted to, he had to reach the late Golden Core stage first at the very least.</p>

    <p>Besides, the market price for a level four skill book was a whole two hundred thousand immortal gold bars.</p>

    <p>And this was only the average market price for a level four skill book. If it was a rare level four skill book, the price would likely be several times more expensive.</p>

    <p>This was by no means a price that an average family could afford...</p>

    <p>So what now?</p>

    <p>The situation turned awkward in that moment, and Li Mingyao felt a little at a loss.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming actually had some idea of what this young master was thinking about. He looked at Li Mingyao who had a complicated expression on his face and asked with a smile, "If you have a question, you might as well just ask it. You don't have to beat around the bush."</p>

    <p>Li Mingyao was dazed since Wang Ming had seen right through him, but he did his best to keep his graceful smile on. "Then I'll ask..."</p>

    <p>"Go on, let's hear it," Wang Ming said.</p>

    <p>Li Mingyao looked at Wang Ling. "I see that this classmate is wearing the Number 60 High school uniform... Do you know Classmate Wang Ling?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "..."</p>

    <p>Li Mingyao: "I'm his fan!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
