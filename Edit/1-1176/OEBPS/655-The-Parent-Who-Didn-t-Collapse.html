  <h1>Chapter 655 The Parent Who Didn't Collapse</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Just like that, Elder Ji Xing inexplicably infiltrated Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>Food tasting event? What was that?</p>

    <p>In order not to arouse suspicion, Elder Ji Xing went over to the doors of the canteen building on the right under Old Li's watchful gaze. He then saw a sign that read "Parents' Food Tasting Event" at the door... It really was a food tasting event! How free was this school that it could hold such an activity?!</p>

    <p>When he was staring at the sign, an old auntie in a chef's uniform came out of the building, a wide smile on her face as she looked at him. "Parent, are you here for the food tasting?"</p>

    <p>This old auntie in the chef's uniform was that very Mother Juan, who was smiling good-naturedly at that moment.</p>

    <p>Elder Ji Xing: "Erm..."</p>

    <p>He was going to ask where the toilet was, then pretend to look for it as he stealthily slipped away. But he had only gotten out an "Erm" and had yet to say the second half when Mother Juan directly latched onto his hand and pulled him through the doors. "That's great! I knew it! There are still some parents with integrity! I sent out invitations to this food tasting event a week ago. I already prepared all the dishes today, but in the end not a single person came... They all suddenly said that they had something to do! I waited for so long at the entrance! Finally, I caught a live parent!"</p>

    <p>Elder Ji Xing: "..."</p>

    <p>Not far behind him at the school gate, Old Li watched Mother Juan pull Elder Ji Xing inside and sighed lightly in relief.</p>

    <p>Today was indeed Mother Juan's food tasting event, but none of the parents had shown up at all. Although Old Li understood their reasons, he thought Mother Juan was a little pitiful. If not a single parent showed up, she would definitely be very hurt!</p>

    <p>Just as he was wondering whether he should look for several fake parent stand-ins to attend the food tasting, he happened to see this Elder Ji Xing disguised as a blonde beauty standing at the school gate... Although she didn't look very familiar, she was in any case a live parent!</p>

    <p>Old Li didn't even think about it before he buzzed her in...</p>

    <p>On a street corner outside the school, a plainclothes little brother watched the blonde-haired young woman walk in before silently taking out his cell phone to make a call to none other than the leader of Kitchen Knife Sect, Jiang Haifu.</p>

    <p>"Sect leader."</p>

    <p>"How's the situation?"</p>

    <p>The little brother scanned the list. "I've already stopped all the parents on the list who were on their way to the food tasting event. But a parent still went in... this parent doesn't seem to be on the list."</p>

    <p>"How many parents?"</p>

    <p>"Just the one."</p>

    <p>The leader of Kitchen Knife Sect gave a sigh. "One... how unfortunate..."</p>

    <p>But they had already achieved their objective by intercepting the other parents.</p>

    <p>After all, saving one life was better than building a seven-storied pagoda!</p>

    <p>Other people had never eaten Mother Juan's food before, but Jiang Haifu had tasted it way before school opened - he was a Golden Core cultivator, and it had almost drilled holes into his stomach!</p>

    <p>He understood Mother Juan too well - the scariest thing about her food wasn't that it was poisonous.</p>

    <p>It was how beautiful that poison was.</p>

    <p>When they came out, Mother Juan's dishes looked like the real deal and were absolutely exquisite, from the arrangement on the plate to the decor; there wasn't even anything wrong with the taste. It was after eating it, however, when the dreadful chemical reactions happened.</p>

    <p>In the eyes of the leader of Kitchen Knife Sect Jiang Haifu, those dishes were actually like the beautiful but poisonous mushrooms in the forest.</p>

    <p>"Then sect leader, what should we do now?"</p>

    <p>"Continue keeping watch. If anything happens to this parent, remember to call an ambulance."</p>

    <p>"Yes, sect leader..." The little brother nodded his head obediently. "But sect leader, I'm a little puzzled. Since this Mother Juan's food is so terrible, why don't the parents complain?"</p>

    <p>"No, you're wrong." The leader of Kitchen Knife Sect Jiang Haifu replied, "Most parents actually don't know how terrible Mother Juan's food is... the reason I stopped them is to save Mother Juan some face. She's already an old woman in her mid-sixties; wholeheartedly studying new cuisine at her age isn't easy. As for why I'm going out of my way to help her, it's actually very simple."</p>

    <p>The little brother: "???"</p>

    <p>The leader of Kitchen Knife Sect Jiang Haifu covered his face and laughed bitterly. "She's my <em>shifu </em>."</p>

    <p>The little brother: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Number 60 High's canteen was very big, with the standard set-up of tables for four people each. Mother Juan enthusiastically dragged Elder Ji Xing inside; he was utterly baffled and didn't know what on earth was happening.</p>

    <p>In this empty canteen, there were just him and this enthusiastic kitchen lady, a total of two people.</p>

    <p>At a loss, Elder Ji Xing was shown to a seat by Mother Juan. There were fully ten dishes on the table, and they were all covered with lids to preserve an air of mystery.</p>

    <p>Elder Ji Xing sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p>He was still casing the school, so he wouldn't directly make a move.</p>

    <p>There was no other option... He could only tolerate it for now and eat all the food here. After pretending that he was about to leave the school, he would think of a way to sneak in for a look.</p>

    <p>He sighed again at this thought.</p>

    <p>When he lifted his head, he realized that the kitchen lady in front of him was already wearing an extremely moved expression and looked like she was about to cry. "I'm so touched! Parent! Of all of them, you're the only one who came today!"</p>

    <p>Elder Ji Xing took a deep breath. He wondered if it was because this kitchen lady's cooking wasn't good that no parent had dared to come. But when Mother Juan lifted the lid off the first dish, Elder Ji Xing froze at the sight that met his eyes!</p>

    <p>It was fried rice, but the grains had been put together in the shape of snowflakes so that it looked like a snowy landscape on a winter day. Embellished with ketchup along the sides, this dish felt like a work of art!</p>

    <p>This arrangement, this design! The most important thing, moreover, was that when the lid was taken off, the dish actually glowed!</p>

    <p>This first dish was Mother Juan's newest specialty â€” fan bing bing <sup>1</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Literally "rice ice ice," and a homonym of the name of a well-known Chinese actress ..)</dfn>

    <p>Elder Ji Xing was overwhelmed.</p>

    <p>It looked like this kitchen lady wasn't a simple person! It was possible she was an expert!</p>

    <p>Elder Ji Xing was even more baffled now.</p>

    <p>From the arrangement on the plate and its appearance, this should be a very delicious dish! And it smelled so good! After cultivating to this point, Elder Ji Xing had resigned himself to the fact that his appetite for good food had completely withered. But the moment the lid had been opened, he realized he was actually craving it!</p>

    <p>Swallowing his saliva, Elder Ji Xing picked up the spoon on the side, dug into the rice, and put a spoonful in his mouth.</p>

    <p>His eyes opened wide.</p>

    <p>It was full of flavor!</p>

    <p>Simply put, it was delicious!</p>

    <p>Elder Ji Xing was now even more confused. His gaze swept over the other nine dishes which were still covered; anyone would know that each one would be better than the one before.</p>

    <p>He then looked at Mother Juan and commented, "Old auntie, this dish is really good."</p>

    <p>"That's great!" Mother Juan couldn't be happier.</p>

    <p>This parent actually hadn't collapsed?! It looked like her experiment was successful?!</p>

    <p>After a moment of silence, Elder Ji Xing said, "But why didn't any parents come for the food tasting?"</p>

    <p>Talking about this, Mother Juan was a little sad. "That's right, it wasn't easy for me to cook all these dishes... If you like them, just eat them all! Then my efforts won't have been in vain."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Elder Ji Xing instantly felt a little moved.</p>

    <p>He remembered how he had experienced all kinds of rejection when he had studied on Sun Island. In some sense, he felt that he and Mother Juan were fellow sufferers.</p>

    <p>As a result, he nodded very solemnly. "Very well! Don't mind if I do!"</p>

    <p>How could he let the dishes that this old woman had put so much effort into go to waste?</p>
