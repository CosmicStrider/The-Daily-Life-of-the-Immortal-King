  <h1>Chapter 502 A Fight Between Immortals </h1>

  <div>

    <p>As he said these words, Wang Ming knew that Wang Ling was definitely watching the live stream.</p>

    <p>He knew Wang Ling's personality too well, and it took practically nothing to guess what Wang Ling's intentions were.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming thought it was a rare opportunity to show off.</p>

    <p>He couldn't compare with Wang Ling when it came to cultivation strength, but in this digital world of games, at least, Wang Ming felt that he could do anything.</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang and Father Wang had a jeep that had been fully kitted out - they had specially prepared it in order to dash to the circle. Wang Ming now was in the driver's seat as he blared the horn and floored the gas, headed in the direction of <em>Youtiao </em>.</p>

    <p>Of course, it wasn't Wang Ming who was really driving the jeep, but the "TTXS" character he had created.</p>

    <p>So he completely wasn't worried about turning the car over, and instead performed many inhuman maneuvers in it.</p>

    <p>"Speed up!" Wang Ming ordered TTXS, and the jeep abruptly revved to its maximum speed.</p>

    <p>There were various types of obstacles on the edge of the airfield. Once they were in range, many people would often abandon their cars and choose to walk since there were many typical cases of cars blowing up after running into obstacles, killing the people inside.</p>

    <p>When the jeep jumped over a boulder, a lot of the people in the bullet messages thought that the car was going to flip.</p>

    <p>"Ahhh! The airfield's iron gates are just up ahead, can't you go around the stone block?! Crazy live streamer!"</p>

    <p>"Damn! The car's going to flip!"</p>

    <p>"It's definitely going to blow up..."</p>

    <p>"That's the death rock, I've flipped my car here so many times."</p>

    <p>"This anti-cheat brother doesn't know to drive, I bet he never got his license!"</p>

    <p>A lot of discussion was happening in the live stream room at that moment.</p>

    <p>In the end, a scene beyond anyone's expectations happened. When the jeep jumped over the stone block at high speeds, not only wasn't there a crash, it seemed to rise up as it blew through the iron gates up ahead like a tornado.</p>

    <p>What the hell?! What kind of operation was this?</p>

    <p>No one knew that this was a smart maneuver performed by Wang Ming's software character after it had done the precise calculations, and they thought that it was Wang Ming himself who had done it. In an instant, 666s were pasted all over the live stream room; even Daoist Guang and Father Wang hadn't expected it.</p>

    <p>"Wasn't that awesome?" Wang Ming asked coolly.</p>

    <p>"I really couldn't tell that little brother would have this sort of skill." Daoist Guang tsked.</p>

    <p>To be honest, this was a pretty stunning performance.</p>

    <p>With these driving skills, Wang Ming could already star in <em>Fast and Furious 8 Plus </em>...</p>

    <p>"Wow! This anti-cheat little brother's technique is too awesome!"</p>

    <p>"Coach, teach me!"</p>

    <p>"Coach: 'No matter how much you want to learn, I can't teach you!' This move is too difficult, I won't be able to learn it!"</p>

    <p>Glancing at the bullet messages in the live stream room, Wang Ming couldn't help laughing. "Do you guys want to learn? I can teach you. Mm, this technique is called the Cyclone Magnum Hurricane! The four racing brothers, please understand <sup>1</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(From the manga "The Racing Brothers Let's &amp; Go !! " which was created as a tie-in to toy company Tamiya's mini-4WD toy car franchise.)</dfn>

    <p>Water fans: "..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang and Daoist Guang: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>What damn Cyclone Magnum Hurricane! Was the Spin Cobra going to suddenly catch up to him from behind then <sup>2</sup> ?!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Another car model styled as a rival in the manga series..)</dfn>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>This required meticulous and highly precise maneuvering. Wang Ming was very confident in the software he had designed. The game was just one large ball of data, and not only could the software's built-in AI system control the character precisely, it also brought out the best of the character's abilities based on what it could reasonably do given the available data.</p>

    <p>That was to say, whatever Wang Ming's character could do was already the maximum operation possible in this game.</p>

    <p>It was already down to the final circle, and there were less than thirty people left.</p>

    <p>Gunfire had already stopped.</p>

    <p>In the live stream, some cheeky water fans had given this battle a name:<em>Showdown At the Summit of the Crane ( </em>Youtiao <em>) </em>...</p>

    <p>Everyone's attention was on this moment.</p>

    <p>All the water fans participating in the match this time had already agreed that until Wang Ming and Fang Xing's great battle was over, no one was allowed to open fire.</p>

    <p>Soon, the jeep arrived at the crane and Wang Ming got out.</p>

    <p>"Good luck, brother," Daoist Guang said solemnly.</p>

    <p>In the end, Father Wang chose to stay in the vehicle while Daoist Guang followed behind Wang Ming, tasked with broadcasting the fight live.</p>

    <p>They were several body lengths apart. Because Daoist Guang controlled the view perspective in the live stream room, he could only switch angles as much as possible in order to provide the water friends in the live stream room with a clearer view.</p>

    <p>On the other side, that mysterious WF finally revealed himself for the first time.</p>

    <p>It was a female character with a ponytail and a baseball cap on her head. The black jacket and miniskirt which she was wearing were rare fashion items in the game; most importantly, this miniskirt was pink in color!</p>

    <p>The miniskirt was the most valuable of all the rare fashion items, while a limited edition skirt could sell for a very high price.</p>

    <p>Usually, a miniskirt could sell for several thousand, maybe even over ten thousand HNY.</p>

    <p>Players could trade and obtain miniskirts online.</p>

    <p>However, only the pink miniskirt couldn't be bought... That was because there were only three limited edition pink miniskirts on the entire server and it was forbidden to sell this item on its own!</p>

    <p>Hence, it could only be bought linked to an account.</p>

    <p>Previously, an account which had the pink miniskirt had sold at the super high price of three thousand immortal gold... for a lot of ordinary players, this value was already beyond what they could imagine.</p>

    <p>A game account that could sell for three thousand immortal gold just because of a piece of clothing was jaw-dropping.</p>

    <p>The bullet messages peppered the screen in Daoist Guang's live stream room after WF showed up in the flesh.</p>

    <p>"What the hell?! What did I see? A pink miniskirt!"</p>

    <p>"As expected, there's no understanding the world of the rich."</p>

    <p>"That's not necessarily the case, the player might not have bought it. But if he had gotten it through a lottery draw, then this little brother's account must be a very old one."</p>

    <p>For many of the players who were intimately familiar with this game, the pink miniskirt had already become a symbol of sorts... it was the symbol of a master.</p>

    <p>To put it another way, this player WF really was something...</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Ming's and Fang Xing's characters were face to face.</p>

    <p>The tension was at its peak.</p>

    <p>Everyone's gazes were fixed on the image from Daoist Guang's perspective.</p>

    <p>Father Wang...</p>

    <p>Er Ha and Wei Zhi...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Lord Diulei...</p>

    <p>Everyone was watching attentively.</p>

    <p>As if they had already talked it over, the two people standing face to face switched out the guns in their hands for sniper rifles.</p>

    <p>98K rifles in this fight?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling also stared blankly at this scene.</p>

    <p>Very quickly, everyone heard the sound of two overlapping gunshots.</p>

    <p>Shots fired!</p>

    <p>Wang Ming's character reacted almost the moment Fang Xing opened fire, and he swiftly ducked sideways behind an iron pillar on the crane while returning fire at the same time.</p>

    <p>This happened almost synchronously with Fang Xing opening fire; it was a quick and smooth response which the eye couldn't keep up with at all.</p>

    <p>But if a person had dynamic vision, they could see this scene very clearly.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw Fang Xing's bullet hit the center of the iron pillar in front of Wang Ming, while Wang Ming's return fire was blocked by the frying pan which Fang Xing had instantly switched to...</p>

    <p>"He can do even that..." Everyone was dumbfounded; the two players were shooting each other at close range, but unexpectedly no one had been hit.</p>

    <p>But it was at that moment when everyone saw a jaw-dropping scene...</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang also saw Wang Ming take out a frying pan!</p>

    <p>Wang Ming's character waved it languidly!</p>

    <p><em>Bang </em>!</p>

    <p>The bullet which Fang Xing had deflected with the frying pan... was actually sent flying back at him again!</p>

    <p>"What the fuck!"</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang couldn't help swearing.</p>

    <p>What the hell!</p>

    <p>This was a fight between immortals!</p>
