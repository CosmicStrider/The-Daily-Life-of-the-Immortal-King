  <h1>Chapter 195 Do You Think the Power of Lightning Is Only Used for Teaching? </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Having said that, it wasn't as if Wang Ling disliked Immortal Toya. The latter was a very sensible brother. Although his handsome appearance was a bonus, it was the last item on Wang Ling's list of priorities.</p>

    <p>In a world which emphasized looks, Wang Ling didn't pay attention to appearance. It wasn't important to him because his face could be kneaded into whatever appearance he wanted without the need for cosmetic surgery. When he was young, he had been too handsome and too popular with his classmates. Thus, he had changed his face several times at a very young age, and based on what the popular standards of beauty were each year, he would modify his face to fit the average mold.</p>

    <p>His current appearance was probably slightly above the ordinary level, which was enough for him.</p>

    <p>What was the use of being good-looking?! In a critical moment, you could only sing: Look at this noodle<sup>1</sup>, it's long and wide; like this bowl, it's large and round<sup>2</sup>...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The Chinese word for 'noodle' Èù¢ also means 'face.')</dfn>
    
    <br/>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is from idol singer Kris Wu's freestyle rap about making noodles on a Chinese variety show ..)</dfn>

    <p>The reason why Wang Ling thought that Immortal Toya was a sensible person was because he felt that the latter really knew how to read a situation; they had only just met in the flesh the last time, but Immortal Toya already had a good grasp of Wang Ling's personality.</p>

    <p>As Immortal Toya drove, he was well aware in his heart that this Ling Zhenren wasn't someone who liked to speak; even when there was a problem, he was disinclined to move his lips. His most common method of communication was through a telepathic link.</p>

    <p>But it had to be said that telepathy could actually be very awkward sometimes. If there were no outsiders around, then that was fine. But if someone was communicating with you telepathically when there were strangers around you, you would just look like you were talking to yourself. Immortal Toya had always thought that this behavior was a little idiotic...</p>

    <p>Additionally, if both individuals didn't speak and communicated wholly through their thoughts, that was even more awkward. Moreover, this was rather impolite behavior. The standard courtesy observed by cultivators for thousands of years was that a junior should always reply out loud if an elder spoke to them telepathically.</p>

    <p>Hence, in view of this situation, Immortal Toya had very sensibly found out how to run missions with Ling Zhenren in a way that was amicable and able to alleviate any awkwardness, and furthermore, wouldn't be discourteous... that was, to learn to take the initiative, consider the problem from all angles, anticipate the questions that this Senior Ling might want to ask, and then explain them one by one.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling really liked this method. With Immortal Toya now by his side, not only didn't he need to move his lips, even his brain could stop thinking...</p>

    <p>"Senior Ling, we're now on our way to the Xiao Family Compound," Immortal Toya said as he drove.</p>

    <p>The Xiao Family Compound?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling hadn't anticipated that it would be a place familiar to him.</p>

    <p>He suddenly recalled when Sun Rong had invited him there back then, and how they had run into a spot of trouble. Now that he thought about it, that was probably the day when Shadow Stream's grudge had begun.</p>

    <p>"Lightning Dharmaraja from the group works in the Xiao Family Compound," Immortal Toya continued. "Dharmaraja's godly thunder inheritance is a holy relic. He is the last descendant of the Thunder clan and also the heir to this holy relic."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised his eyebrows. If Immortal Toya hadn't mentioned it, he would have almost forgotten this thing. There were holy magic treasures that were passed down from ancestors of ancient clans from the Great Battle Qi era. People called them holy relics, and a holy relic could only be inherited by descendants of the ancient clan which it belonged to. Nowadays, however, half of the descendants of the twelve major ancient clans had almost disappeared, and many of the holy relics were still missing.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't know much about Lightning Dharmaraja, but he hadn't expected him to actually be a descendant of the Thunder clan, and to have moreover inherited a holy relic... Wang Ling had always thought that this Dharmaraja was just involved in teaching!</p>

    <p>"Actually, Dharmaraja has been misunderstood all these years. He's used his godly thunder inheritance to cure many teenagers who were gaming addicts. After all, cultivation is about good karma and good deeds... but that isn't his main business," Immortal Toya explained solemnly. "His real occupation is in the Xiao Family Compound."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "???"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "The buildings in the Xiao Family Compound are all antiques, and using current scientific methods to repair them when they get damaged sometimes results in more damage. But the godly thunder inheritance can disassemble the broken parts and then recombine them, or even weld them together. So Dharmaraja is actually a repairs engineer specially employed by the Xiao Family Compound."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was the second time that Wang Ling was visiting the Xiao Family Compound. Without Sun Rong around, he couldn't use the green passage this time, but he could enter through the staff passage.</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja gave the security office at the entrance a call, and the security guard opened the gate to let them through.</p>

    <p>By the by, there were very few visitors in the Xiao Family Compound today. Since many of the scenic spots were under maintenance, many customers who had bought the three-day travel pass had decided to take a break today. Of course, to make up for it, the Xiao Family Compound had given each customer a five hundred-yuan voucher for the barbecue shop inside the Xiao Family Compound.</p>

    <p>This barbecue shop was owned by the Xiao clan, and its biggest difference with the barbecue shops outside was that it used the Heavenly Flame to barbecue the meat, which gave it a different type of taste.</p>

    <p>The security guard uncle was very generous and gave Immortal Toya and Wang Ling each a voucher. "You can use the vouchers when you spend over one thousand yuan; the more vouchers you use, the more value you get for your money, and it's just for these three days."</p>

    <p>"Is this really alright?"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya accepted the voucher with a little embarrassment. "We're just here to look for someone..."</p>

    <p>"What's that got to do with anything? I still have plenty here!" The security guard uncle shook his head and went back to his office table in the small pavilion. When he pulled open a drawer, Immortal Toya took a good look and saw heaps of vouchers inside worth five hundred yuan. Most importantly, these vouchers had no dates on them!</p>

    <p>"The higher-ups printed too many, and the extras were all put here. I can afford to eat for several months on these vouchers." After saying this, the old security guard uncle rubbed his beer belly. "I've worked here for so long, and now I'm finally getting some benefits. Look at how thin I've become..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling : "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When they officially entered the Xiao Family Compound, Dharmaraja took the initiative to send Immortal Toya a text message to let them know that he was still performing maintenance at Treasure Cliff; it would be at least an hour before he could come out.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya looked at the time and heaved a sigh, then looked at Wang Ling and said, "Senior, why don't we go to the barbecue shop first and get something to eat while we wait for him? We have two vouchers, we can eat for free!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't speak but just nodded in agreement.</p>

    <p>But when they reached the Xiao clan barbecue shop, he saw that there was already a long line at the door... as long as you spent a thousand yuan and you could use as many vouchers as you wanted in a single transaction, given that the vouchers were worth five hundred yuan each, this meant in theory that your meal could be completely free.</p>

    <p>This kind of material compensation was nothing for a nouveau riche family like the Xiao clan.</p>

    <p>And this in turn had led directly to the current unprecedented and grand situation at the door...</p>

    <p>The scene reminded Wang Ling of a gourmet food store he had once visited which had become a hot topic online for its famous green rice balls.</p>

    <p>He had once queued for six hours at that store before he could finally buy the green rice balls with crispy noodle filling.</p>
