  <h1>Chapter 693 Are You Scared Now?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>All this was just a test performance on Wang Ling's part; he wanted President Bai to recognize the gap in their strengths.</p>

    <p>At that moment, President Bai's eyes were blank; he was utterly frightened by the youngster's enormous strength. Ever since cultivating an immortal physique, he had never been afraid of death, but given the youngster's ungodly techniques, President Bai was convinced that the other party had thousands of ways to finish him off.</p>

    <p>He, Bai Zhe, who had cultivated for thousands of years, would finally be defeated here?</p>

    <p>He lowered his eyes in dread, his heart shaken by the number of Heavenly Dao which Wang Ling had. At the same time, he gnashed his teeth as a trace of helpless envy sprouted quietly in his heart.</p>

    <p>This was the first time Wang Ling had taken the talisman seal off. Even though it was only halfway, the power that had exploded out had been formidable enough. The reason why this was a so-called test performance was that Wang Ling wanted to see whether he could precisely control the Heavenly Dao, if half of his strength was released at his current stage of growth.</p>

    <p>He got his answer when he destroyed the nine gates.</p>

    <p>In his current condition, taking the talisman off was actually still a very dangerous thing to do.</p>

    <p>He had only sighed casually and had been about to perform a spell. But before he could do so, the nine gates had been destroyed straightaway by his sigh...</p>

    <p>President Bai was dumbstruck, and actually, so was Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The Heavenly Dao was a good thing, and so, so many people pursued it in vain, but sometimes, too many of them was in fact a pain in the neck.</p>

    <p>If this hadn't been an independent space that had been completely partitioned off and the destruction of which wouldn't have any impact on the outside world, Wang Ling would never have taken the seal off so easily.</p>

    <p>However, the damage which his inadvertent sigh had caused just now had dealt this President Bai a heavy blow. After a moment of silence, Wang Ling stuck the talisman seal fully back on again.</p>

    <p>By now, President Bai should clearly understand the gap in strength between them. No one could withstand an attack from one thousand and five hundred Heavenly Dao, let alone three thousand of them. If the three thousand Heavenly Dao were all released at the same time, all the cultivators on Earth would probably be reduced to nothing but dust.</p>

    <p>Not only had the King's Sigh just now destroyed the nine gates in a flash, President Bai had also been heavily injured. Although there were no surface wounds, the sigh had caused severe internal injuries, and his organs had probably been shaken to pieces. But it hadn't killed President Bai.</p>

    <p>Compared with Wang Ling's previous opponents, this President Bai was really like a cockroach.</p>

    <p>But though he was tricky to deal with, Wang Ling still had ways to do so.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling smoothed the talisman seal back into place. He felt a little disturbed by half the strength he had released earlier, so it was better to stick the talisman back on. Such an ordinary sigh already had that sort of power, not to mention if he had cast a spell... But this action was a stab to President Bai's heart as he felt that he was being looked down on.</p>

    <p>President Bai picked himself up on trembling legs and hastily popped a spirit-replenishing pill into his mouth.</p>

    <p>President Bai had already recovered from most of the internal injuries caused by the King's Sigh just now, but Wang Ling could see that this kind of healing wasn't infinite â€” it consumed a great amount of spirit energy, and President Bai was currently close to his limit, forced to rely on elixirs to maintain his physical strength.</p>

    <p>"Damn it... You're actually looking down on me..." When he saw Wang Ling stick the talisman back on, President Bai felt like he had never been struck a blow like this before.</p>

    <p>This was naked disdain.</p>

    <p>He was so angry he shook. "Even if you're a tiger, today I'm going to pull out your teeth!"</p>

    <p>Saying this, he narrowed his eyes and in the blink of an eye, countless glowing talismans enveloped his body.</p>

    <p>In an instant, President Bai's body suddenly grew to fill the space. Runes as black as ink wrapped around his body. These dark runes hid godly might which contained immeasurable power.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling instantly realized that President Bai had sold his body again in another exchange.</p>

    <p>But it was obvious that this time, he hadn't used his lifespan, but his soul in the trade!</p>

    <p>The power obtained in exchange for your soul was completely different from using your lifespan. Wang Ling was taken aback, and felt that things had become troublesome. He never thought that his off-handed action would actually provoke President Bai into directly selling his soul in exchange for even greater power to fight... Although it wouldn't be to the extent of their mutual destruction, it really was likely that Wang Ling's clothes would be damaged!</p>

    <p>The Wang family's house rule was that if Wang Ling's school uniform was damaged by anything other than an act of god and needed to be replaced with a new one, the amount would be deducted from his allowance!</p>

    <p>In that instant, Wang Ling broke out in a cold sweat. Although Number 60 High's school uniform was inordinately ugly, it wasn't cheap! It was worth several boxes of crispy noodle snacks!</p>

    <p>On the other side, President Bai was pleased when he saw the dramatic change in Wang Ling's expression.</p>

    <p>Although he didn't know what had caused this composed youngster to unexpectedly reveal this flustered expression, President Bai's first reaction was that the other party was already holding back his fear at the power which he had traded his soul for.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, it was impossible for this youngster to reveal such an expression.</p>

    <p>"Are you scared now?" The gigantic President Bai sneered cruelly. It was practically a roar, the wild and unrestrained sound echoing in that world.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Seeing no response from the youngster, President Bai's smile grew even more brilliant. "As expected! You're scared! You finally know how to be afraid!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>At that moment, President Bai's body was hundreds of times larger and he looked down at Wang Ling. "In return for my soul, I obtained double the power of Heavenly Dao. No matter what, you will taste suffering with this strike!"</p>

    <p>As soon as he said this, his gigantic body unexpectedly changed shape again and actually transformed into an enormous pitch-black spear! A strong wind blew out in all directions, creating a lot of cracks in the space and kicking up a massive storm that ruffled Wang Ling's bangs!</p>

    <p>Staring at the scene in front of him, Wang Ling was blank for a while - blank because he couldn't see how on earth this was powerful...</p>

    <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

    <p>President Bai, who had transformed into a huge spear, was already thrusting down at Wang Ling. It was very fast and it undoubtedly contained devastating, destructive power.</p>

    <p>"Sword, come..." Wang Ling pursed his lips and stretched out his hand.</p>

    <p>Before President Bai could even completely make out the appearance of this youngster's weapon, he saw the youngster swing his arm, and a brown spirit light flew at President Bai head on!</p>
