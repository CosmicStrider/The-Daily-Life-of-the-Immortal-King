  <h1>Chapter 735 The Signal For Action</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In the command center of the Huaxiu Alliance building, President Qi carefully checked the list of Dark Network members that the government had investigated. Most of the troublesome ones had by happenstance been assigned to the fake remains by Night Chief, such as Bloody Butterfly and Lord Anxiang.</p>

    <p>But from beginning to end, President Qi felt uneasy. Furthermore, it was such an intense feeling, like an axe was suddenly hanging high in his heart, and the rope tied to the top of the axe was already about to snap.</p>

    <p>The last time he had felt this uneasy was before the sudden descent of the Gate Between Worlds six years ago...</p>

    <p>In fact, it wasn't just President Qi, but General Yi also felt the same.</p>

    <p>This was the ability to foresee a crisis, and anyone who reached the True Immortal realm would more or less have it.</p>

    <p>As for the rumored sixth sense...</p>

    <p>In general, the higher a cultivator's realm, the more accurate this sixth sense became.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's twitching eyelid warning itself was also a kind of sixth sense.</p>

    <p>But this twitching eyelid warning was more precise than a normal sixth sense. If you had to find fault with it, it would be that any crisis it predicted was focused on Wang Ling himself and couldn't foresee other people's situations.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had had a premonition before that Lord Diulei was in danger, but he had gotten this from a prophetic dream. Wang Ling rarely had such dreams, so when he did have one, it would definitely come true.</p>

    <p>But it just so happened that because he had to prepare for the summer camp and the final exams recently, he had actually been suffering from insomnia lately...</p>

    <p>It wasn't that Wang Ling didn't want to sleep - it was just that compared with sleep, studying was the most important!</p>

    <p>So long as you couldn't literally die from studying, you could study to death...</p>

    <p>"If you are lazy in your prime, you will be sorry in your old age"...</p>

    <p>This was what Father Wang had taught Wang Ling about studying since his childhood.</p>

    <p>While Pen and Eraser these two gremlins could write Wang Ling's homework for him, this was based on the premise that he had to master all the knowledge first.</p>

    <p>"Given His Excellency Head of State's strength, his presence this time is more than enough to keep the students safe." Gazing at the screen, General Yi stroked his goatee and spoke slowly.</p>

    <p>"I hope you're right." President Qi sighed.</p>

    <p>Be that as it may, they were still outnumbered. The main problem was that they still didn't know what the other side was planning. However, looking at the enemy's movements, the one thing President Qi could be sure of was that Night Chief's objective this time was already no longer just that "level thirteen magic treasure."</p>

    <p>"Command center, send out the order! Have all the teachers in the real remains be on alert! Prepare to close the net!" President Qi gave the latest command to the staff.</p>

    <p>He had initially wanted to see what this group of people were going to do before he acted, but now he was worried that the students might be pulled into the danger, so he immediately gave the arrest order.</p>

    <p>This President Dylan thought he could slip quietly into their ranks, but before he had done so, Huaxiu Alliance had already acquired information on Night Chief's foreign force as well as the Dark Network rebels.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After Huaxiu Alliance issued the order, Wu Zhenjun immediately received the news on the other side.</p>

    <p>The Night Chief and Dark Network members that had been detected previously had been isolated. They were lurking inside the medical team, and even their military tent for the evening picnic had been specially prepared by Wu Zhenjun.</p>

    <p>Furthemore, in order not to arouse their suspicions, Wu Zhenjun had specially put the medical team in two military tents, and had had the regular medical personnel act as Barb Wolves <sup>1</sup> inside.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(From the Chinese boardgame
"Werewolf," and refers to the
werewolf who acts
undercover.)</dfn>

    <p>It would be suspicious if the entire group they wanted to apprehend were put together in one tent.</p>

    <p>The moment Wu Zhenjun received President Qi's command, he instantly posted in a side chat group called "FisherKing <sup>2</sup> ": "Attention, everyone, prepare to close the net!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(A Chinese game app.)</dfn>

    <p>The members of the FisherKing group were all the teachers who were participating in the operation to close the net this time, and who had been very carefully selected by Wu Zhenjun.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin and Wang Ming were both in it.</p>

    <p>"So soon?" Wang Ming replied with a quick message.</p>

    <p>Wu Zhenjun nodded. "Yes, the higher-ups believe that this group is on the verge of taking action, which might pose a threat to the students' safety, so we have to act first. Everyone should have already read the information on this group lurking in our midst. Please remember not to hurt our allies when we close the net."</p>

    <p>"Alright." Wang Ming nodded.</p>

    <p>"Can Head of State 001 be activated properly?" Wu Zhenjun asked again.</p>

    <p>"Yes, I was debugging it just now, but that won't affect its use," Wang Ming replied.</p>

    <p>He had been in the process of debugging Head of State 001. He still didn't understand which program it was that was responsible for Head of State 001's intelligence evolving, but since a task had been assigned, he would have to wait for Head of State 001 to complete it first before he could continue with his research.</p>

    <p>He still hadn't figured out how this Head of State 001 had learned this "Super Transformation Mode" skill on its own...</p>

    <p>Wu Zhenjun: "Everyone get ready. In thirty seconds, wait for my signal and then move in together on members of the medical team in the two military tents!"</p>

    <p>"Alright! May I ask what the signal will be?"</p>

    <p>"Skr~ Skr~!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On this side, President Dylan's infiltration plan had already begun.</p>

    <p>There was a hiccup now in the master plan as Huaxiu had sent too many people to deal with them. Their main objective this time was Wang Ming; as long as they grabbed Wang Ming first and used him as a hostage, they believed that their master plan would ultimately still proceed smoothly.</p>

    <p>Just a few minutes ago, Night Chief had sent over the latest information on this "Wang Ming"...</p>

    <p>There was barely anything on him, just one information sheet which was his resume from his time in college, when he had still used the alias "Wang Xiaoer." The only thing they knew so far was that Wang Xiaoer was a fake name, and the young man's real name was Ming.</p>

    <p>Based on this information sheet alone, it was clearly illogical for him to be a lead teacher qualified to enter Beast King's Remains with everyone else this time.</p>

    <p>"The more he conceals, the more it proves that his identity isn't simple..." President Dylan had already come to this conclusion in his heart after looking at this information sheet.</p>

    <p>He was quite sure that this Lao Gudong Xiaoer absolutely wasn't an ordinary person.</p>

    <p>President Dylan also had his own side chat group, and the signal they had agreed on previously was a funny emoji. Once President Dylan sent "funny," all personnel would immediately carry out their individual missions.</p>

    <p>But not long after this funny emoji was sent out, several powerful spotlights instantly lit up outside the military tent which President Dylan was in.</p>

    <p>This was followed by two sharp artificial "skr~ skr" signals.</p>

    <p>Dozens of figures instantly surrounded the military tents in a tight circle...</p>

    <p>Outside the military tents, Wu Zhenjun's voice rang out. "Skr~ skr! The criminals inside, listen up! You are surrounded! Give up - to struggle and resist is futile! Otherwise, I will play Wu Yifan's raw vocal <sup>3</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>("Skr" is a somewhat
nonsensical buzzword made
popular by Chinese rapper Wu
Yifan or Kris Wu, whose poor
singing in an unedited video
online became a controversial
topic)</dfn>

    <p>"..."</p>
