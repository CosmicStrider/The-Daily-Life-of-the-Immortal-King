  <h1>Chapter 386 Wei Zhi's Strength </h1>

  <div>

    <p>"This dog can actually talk?"</p>

    <p>Like everyone else who had heard Er Ha talk, the people in this house looked at it in amazement.</p>

    <p>"Uncle Zuo? Is this a second-class dog?" A very thin-looking young man lit the butcher uncle's cigarette for him.</p>

    <p>The uncle immediately shook his head. "This dog is definitely not a second-class beast."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi and Er Ha took a rough measure of the strength of everyone present. The butcher uncle was only at the Golden Core stage, but realm clearly wasn't everything in the Demon Hunters Association. This butcher uncle called Uncle Zuo was obviously a longtime member of the Demon Hunters Association, and was experienced in appraising spirit beasts.</p>

    <p>Uncle Zuo stared at Er Ha and reached out to stroke its dog fur, which made it feel disgusted. "Normally, spirit beasts aren't capable of language until they've reach second class, but it's clear that this dog... is very special."</p>

    <p>Uncle Zuo smiled as he exhaled a ring of smoke and stared at Wei Zhi. "So, little brother, where did you get this dog?"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi scratched his head. "I grabbed it from a friend... He's a good person, and his family runs an inn. They have a collection of exotic animals; when I first saw this dog, I felt that it wasn't an ordinary one, so I wanted to take it away."</p>

    <p>Strong Zuo: "It didn't resist?"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "It's mentally retarded."</p>

    <p>Er Ha took a deep breath. "..."</p>

    <p>"So it's like that."</p>

    <p>Uncle Zuo sneered. "You actually stole it from a close friend; it looks like this little brother has promise."</p>

    <p>"I'm flattered." Wei Zhi gave a fake smile.</p>

    <p>"I'm in charge of appraisal here; if this little brother is ready to sell, then give us your price." Strong Zuo had a cigarette in his mouth, his expression relaxed.</p>

    <p>"I'll have you know that my dog is very special."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi laughed. "So I want to see the top management here before I make a decision."</p>

    <p>The young men on the side were clearly dissatisfied with Wei Zhi's attitude, but Uncle Zuo stretched out one hand to stop them. "Hehe, of all the newcomers who have dealt with our Demon Hunters Association, there are very few people like you, little brother, who have directly said that they want to see the top management during the first transaction. A dog like yours which can talk despite not yet having reached second class is indeed rare, but its level is in fact not high. Even if our president takes a look at it, he won't give you an especially high price for it; furthermore, it's not so easy for newcomers to meet him so easily."</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, Strong Zuo narrowed his eyes slightly. "But all of that doesn't matter now."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi frowned as he suddenly felt a hint of killing intent.</p>

    <p>Crossing his arms, Strong Zuo said with a smile, "In our Demon Hunters Association, even if we can't agree on a price, you don't have any room to bargain."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi's expression twitched. "You want to take it by force?"</p>

    <p>"Young man, this is your first time doing business with our Demon Hunters Association; you don't know how dangerous society is. If you leave the dog here willingly, everyone will be happy. If you refuse, you'll suffer for it." After he finished speaking, Strong Zuo couldn't help adding, "This is the rule of society nowadays; it's also not good to kill people."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "???"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "???"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi and Er Ha were both stupefied when they heard this... A gang of lawbreaking pet traffickers were actually starting to talk about the law here?!</p>

    <p>"Looks like the only thing we can do is fight."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi sighed in his heart; he hadn't expected things to ultimately come to this point.</p>

    <p>He had initially intended to make his move after the highest level of management appeared, but he had overlooked one thing: from the beginning, there was no way that this gang of illegal pet traffickers was ever going to deal with him properly.</p>

    <p>"Are our odds of winning good?" Er Ha asked telepathically; it had already jumped out of the travel bag, gaze fixed on the people surrounding them.</p>

    <p>There were twelve people in total, and while the leader Strong Zuo didn't have a high realm, his subordinates were very troublesome, with four of them being at the peak late Golden Core stage.</p>

    <p>"What, want to fight?"</p>

    <p>Strong Zuo stared at Wei Zhi with a sneer. "The one thing our Demon Hunters Association doesn't lack is people; the twelve of us can be considered experts in the association. If you want to make a move here, it won't do you any good."</p>

    <p>"Doesn't matter."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi waved his hand lightly. "I wanted to wait until your president came out at first, then take care of all of you in one go. It's just twelve Golden Core cultivators."</p>

    <p>Seeing this, Er Ha was inwardly very reassured: as expected, this Wei Zhi was an expert! After all, he had used body movements back then which were completely beyond his realm, and it was hard to get a read on his aura; he had definitely concealed his level. Since he could be so calm in the face of twelve Golden Core cultivators, he was obviously very confident in his realm.</p>

    <p>Hearing Wei Zhi's words, Strong Zuo began to sense that Wei Zhi's identity wasn't simple, and he glared at him. "Who the hell are you?"</p>

    <p>Since things had come to this point, Wei Zhi had nothing to hide, and he simply took out his pet trainer medal.</p>

    <p>"Pet trainer?"</p>

    <p>Everyone in the room was alarmed.</p>

    <p>Strong Zuo stared at Wei Zhi and clenched his teeth. "Are you undercover?"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi flicked his peaked cap back and forth and laughed. "When I entered the backstreet just now, I'd already sent out the coordinates of this place. I believe a whole lot of police are making their way here right now."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Strong Zuo and the others became deeply unhappy and couldn't take it anymore.</p>

    <p>"Grab them!"</p>

    <p>"Shitty brat, don't blame us since you want to court death!"</p>

    <p>"Damn kid!"</p>

    <p>Three Golden Core cultivators instantly stretched out their hands at the same time to subdue Wei Zhi.</p>

    <p>This was the "Grab Hand," which wasn't a top-level technique of any kind, but when the three Golden Core cultivators moved at the same time, the pressure and might generated was extraordinary. The three men flanked Wei Zhi from different directions, and the Grab Hand seemed to form a strong triangular shackle in the air. Once a cultivator at the same realm level was suppressed by it, it was very hard to break free.</p>

    <p>Er Ha knew that now was the time for Wei Zhi to show his true strength!</p>

    <p>"A petty trick!"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi snorted, and that familiar body movement came out in front of Er Ha once again; in the split second that he was surrounded by the three people, he actually slipped passed them at a weird angle.</p>

    <p>What great movement!</p>

    <p>On the side, Er Ha couldn't help sighing at this scene.</p>

    <p>But gradually, it started to realize something...</p>

    <p>It noticed that Wei Zhi seemed to be dodging all this time, and didn't have any intention of making a move.</p>

    <p>What was going on?</p>

    <p>Why wasn't he taking action?</p>

    <p>While his body movements were indeed remarkable, it was impossible to win with them alone.</p>

    <p>Just as Er Ha was wondering what Wei Zhi would do next, a telepathic call for help came its way while Wei Zhi was dodging these people's attack. "Brother Dog! Why are you just looking? Help me out!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "???"</p>

    <p>Telepathically, Wei Zhi said anxiously, "Body movement is the only skill I have!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>
