  <h1>Chapter 388 The Legendary Deer Demon... </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Every dog had its day. The twelve Golden Core cultivators were dumbstruck at this change in events. With the support of fully forty-odd auxiliary spells, various kinds of light and sigils swirled around Er Ha to form an unbreakable circle that was three feet in diameter... Aura poured out in whirls like a vortex, with Er Ha at its center.</p>

    <p>Bolstered by forty-nine augmentation spells in total, Er Ha's power couldn't be compared with what it had been like earlier.</p>

    <p>For five minutes, Er Ha stood there, quietly regarding everyone.</p>

    <p>"You..."</p>

    <p>Finally, there was a hint of fear in Strong Zuo's eyes.</p>

    <p>An auxiliary spell would weaken the longer it was in effect. Usually the most it could last for was just two minutes, but this was in the case of low-grade spells.</p>

    <p>In Strong Zuo's experience, anything longer than five minutes was already very long.</p>

    <p>However, the effects of the spells on Er Ha showed no signs of weakening at all after five minutes.</p>

    <p>This proved that these auxiliary spells were of a very high level, and were very likely top-grade!</p>

    <p>The most important thing was, given that each auxiliary spell was at its most refined, Strong Zuo was starting to realize that he might have provoked a great senior with an unfathomable realm.</p>

    <p>"Who... who the hell is your owner?!" Strong Zuo had long lost his arrogant tone after his aura had been completely suppressed; under the absolute pressure of this aura, even breathing was very difficult!</p>

    <p>Twelve Golden Core cultivators from the Demon Hunters Association had actually been suppressed by a dog that had yet to attain second class... If this incident got out, they would definitely become laughingstocks.</p>

    <p>But Strong Zuo had no time to think about such things right now.</p>

    <p>The only way they could win now was to think of how to drag out the duration of the auxiliary spells or avoid fighting as much as possible.</p>

    <p>"Everyone, transfer all your spirit power into my Mystery Umbrella! Let's join together and fight!" Standing in the front, Strong Zuo raised his hand, and a huge umbrella actually appeared.</p>

    <p>The twelve Golden Core cultivators acted together, and spirit light burst forth above the umbrella as the bright light that was released took the form of a halo.</p>

    <p>But very quickly, this light actually disappeared straightaway!</p>

    <p>"What's going on?"</p>

    <p>Strong Zuo was aghast when he discovered his umbrella covered in a layer of ice.</p>

    <p>This was... the Aura-Freezing Spell?</p>

    <p>When he saw this scene, Wei Zhi couldn't help narrowing his eyes on the side - this was a very advanced demon race spell! When the Gate Between Worlds had descended the first two times, every major pet trainers guild had thoroughly analyzed the spells commonly used by the demon race, in response to the demon beasts that had poured out of the Gate.</p>

    <p>The "Aura-Freezing Spell" was one of them. It released a special qi which could counteract a spirit wave or blade produced by a magic weapon, and could even make the weapon malfunction temporarily.</p>

    <p>Back then, the demon god Li Xiaolu, a deer demon, had used a highly refined version of the Aura-Freezing Spell, and General Yi and the others had suffered bitterly for it in battle.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi wasn't clear on the exact details, and only knew the rough history.</p>

    <p>At that time, Li Xiaolu had certainly shocked everyone with this demon race "Aura-Freezing Spell"! In the first confrontation with the enemy, which was the heavenly-level human race Hip-Hop Sect, it had directly and completely wiped out all the sect's top rhythm cultivators -</p>

    <p>it was said that even the air had frozen then.</p>

    <p>After that first battle, Li Xiaolu had been bestowed the grand title of King of Hip-Hop Destruction<sup>1</sup>!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Actress Li Xiaolu's extramarital affair with well-known hip-hop artiste PG One was said to have destroyed the hip-hop circle, hence the nickname ..)</dfn>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi was now becoming more and more interested in Er Ha.</p>

    <p>It was clearly just an akita, which was a breed that wasn't part of the ranks of spirit dogs, yet it was hiding a tremendous amount of spirit power.</p>

    <p>Such a unique spirit dog was actually capable of using a spell of the demon race.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi thought he could already guess what Er Ha's specific situation was.</p>

    <p>The Mystery Umbrella had barely made an appearance before it had instantly malfunctioned after just a few seconds!</p>

    <p>Strong Zuo's face had changed dramatically, and he took several steps back in terror... He could see that not only was this dog's owner very powerful, even the dog's identity wasn't as simple as he had thought.</p>

    <p>"You can't even get close to me with your current realm; you still want to combine forces to fight me?" Er Ha raised its dog head and smiled coldly.</p>

    <p>In the next instant, Wei Zhi saw Er Ha's body emit a magnificent light which then enveloped Wei Zhi!</p>

    <p>Was it afraid he would be affected? Was it going to release some great skill?</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi watched the scene in front of him attentively.</p>

    <p>"I can't move!"</p>

    <p>Strong Zuo blurted loudly on the other side!</p>

    <p>He was aghast when he realized that the unusual aura that had frozen the Mystery Umbrella had made its way up the magic weapon to seize their bodies and also freeze them!</p>

    <p>This definitely wasn't what a normal third-class spirit dog could do... Even if it had been strengthened, the extent of this power was something that even second-class spirit beasts found difficult to achieve!</p>

    <p>All kinds of thoughts spun around in Strong Zuo's mind.</p>

    <p>"You shouldn't have provoked me." Er Ha swept a lazy gaze over these people.</p>

    <p>The next moment, it released a green aura which looked like countless hands that lunged for the heads of these Golden Core cultivators!</p>

    <p>The cultivators couldn't avoid them at all, much less resist!</p>

    <p>The moment this aura penetrated his skull, Strong Zuo promptly felt like collapsing.</p>

    <p>Did this spell have a weakening effect?</p>

    <p>No, it didn't seem that simple...</p>

    <p>Roughly ten seconds later, a dozen Golden Core experts fell to the ground simultaneously with a loud bang.</p>

    <p>Strong Zuo, the butcher uncle who was the leader, stretched out one miserable hand. "Senior Dog... spare me! I was wrong!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha was unperturbed as it completely paid no attention to all the screams. It was only after a full minute that the large incorporeal aura hands detached themselves from the heads of the twelve Golden Core cultivators.</p>

    <p>These Golden Core cultivators hadn't been killed, but their auras were extremely faint; most of all, their faces looked very unsightly, as if they had been robbed of their essence.</p>

    <p>Looking at this chaotic scene of tragedy in the wooden house, Wei Zhi's brain felt numb, and his mouth was dry as he asked, "...Brother Dog, would it be possible for you to please explain what on earth just happened?"</p>

    <p>Although Wei Zhi could think of several spells that could cause these effects, he couldn't be entirely sure what had just happened.</p>

    <p>In short, this definitely wasn't a spell with a weakening function... If it had just been such a spell, these twelve Golden Core certainly wouldn't look this depressed, as if they had been toyed with and thrown away.</p>

    <p>Er Ha narrowed its eyes and smirked. "I took fifty years off each of them."</p>

    <p>What the fuck?!</p>

    <p>Extending its own life?!</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi was shaken by this operation.</p>

    <p>This was really too vicious!</p>
