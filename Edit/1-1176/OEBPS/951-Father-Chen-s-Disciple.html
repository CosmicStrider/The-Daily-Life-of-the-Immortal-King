  <h1>Chapter 951 Father Chen's Disciple</h1>

  <div>

    <p>With one glance, Father Chen could tell that this was Wang Xiaoling's mother. The woman was very dirty. It seemed that she had mustered up all her courage to stand timidly at the entrance of the dojo with her daughter. She didn't even dare lift her head, but only surveyed everything inside the dojo out of the corner of her eye.</p>

    <p>Her shoes were very old. It was clear that the woman had already cleaned them before coming to the dojo, but they still looked dusty.</p>

    <p>"Come on in." Father Chen smiled. He had seen Wang Xiaoling's mother before, and thought that she was a woman who didn't have it easy, so the Chen family would gather together the dilapidated items and jars at home and put them in one place for Wang Xiaoling's mother to pick up.</p>

    <p>Of course, they didn't charge anything.</p>

    <p>Father Chen and Mother Chen were both warmhearted people. They could imagine how difficult it was for a mother with a mute girl.</p>

    <p>Now, standing here and in tune with the girl's memory, Wang Ling was also feeling very moved.</p>

    <p>Wang Xiaoling felt nothing but grateful deep in her heart. Although Wang Xiaoling was very young, Chen Chao rescued her. Wang Xiaoling didn't know how it felt to like someone, but she was standing at the entrance of the dojo, and just like her mother, had drummed up the courage to come here.</p>

    <p>The moment she saw Chen Chao, Wang Ling could clearly feel his face unconsciously start to turn hot.</p>

    <p>He felt that this first-person perspective was pretty amazing...</p>

    <p>Looking at the way the story was unfolding, it was very obvious that this "Wang Xiaoling" was an important part of Chen Chao's childhood.</p>

    <p>Each time he considered this, Wang Ling couldn't help but feel torn inwardly.</p>

    <p>The memory fragment about "Wang Xiaoling" which he had grabbed earlier was gray in color... This hinted that the story about Wang Xiaoling didn't have a very good ending...</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling was very curious to know what happened later.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Although Father Chen invited her in, Xiaoling's mom continued to stand at the dojo entrance and didn't dare enter.</p>

    <p>The dojo was so clean and she was afraid she would get it dirty. After careful consideration, she decided not to go in. She stood at the entrance, and along with Wang Xiaoling, bowed to Father Chen. "Thank you, thank you, Teacher Chen.</p>

    <p>"Teacher Chen, please take this..." The woman was clutching a bag and was clearly a little nervous. Inside the bag was spirit fruit she had just bought. The spirit fruit actually wasn't worth much for many people, but Father Chen knew what Xiaoling's family situation was like - this was the best thing Xiaoling's mom could come up with.</p>

    <p>"Public opinion was fair in this incident; Xiaoling's mom, you don't have to be so polite. Thank you for the spirit fruit." Father Chen accepted the bag of spirit fruit. Actually, he wasn't a fan of how sweet and fragrant they were, but he wanted to put Xiaoling's mom at ease so that in their dojo at least, she didn't have to be so humble.</p>

    <p>Taking the bag of fruit, Father Chen persisted in inviting Xiaoling's mom in, an amiable smile on his face the whole time. "Xiaoling's mom, do come in for a chat. I have something to discuss with you."</p>

    <p>It was close to dusk, and pretty much all the children in the dojo had left. Chen Chao, Xiaoling and her mom were the only ones left in the dojo. Seeing that Xiaoling's mom was hesitating, Chen Chao directly stepped forward to drag Xiaoling away. The two kids ran to the back of the dojo, which had some of the toys that Chen Chao usually played with.</p>

    <p>Xiaoling's mom was embarrassed by his enthusiasm, but when she saw her daughter actually smile the moment Chen Chao dragged her off, Xiaoling's mom froze for a moment.</p>

    <p>She hesitated at the entrance before finally taking off her shoes outside and then stepping barefoot on the dojo's cold wooden floor.</p>

    <p>When they sat down on yoga mats, Father Chen came straight to the point. "Xiaoling's mom, I want to ask for your help with something."</p>

    <p>"Me? Help..." Xiaoling's mom thought she had heard wrong and couldn't quite believe it. She was someone who collected rubbish - what could she help him with?</p>

    <p>"It's like this: my Chen Chao will be five soon, which is just the right time to learn sword fighting, and I'm going to have him practice it.</p>

    <p>"He doesn't yet have a foundation in sword fighting, but in general, it's best to find someone on the same level to practice sword fighting with, which will be more effective.</p>

    <p>"Xiaoling might not be able to speak, but I can see that she's a smart girl and she plays well with our Chen Chao. Also, she's of the right age..."</p>

    <p>On the side, Wang Ling, who had possessed Wang Xiaoling's body, was playing with Chen Chao. These were memory fragments, so even if Wang Ling didn't want to move, his body would move on its own to replay what happened in the memory...</p>

    <p>So while he was playing with Chen Chao, he was also eavesdropping on what Father Chen was saying.</p>

    <p>For some reason, Father Chen's words sounded like he was setting up a marriage interview...</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, Father Chen wasn't Father Wang or any sort of literary scholar. He had already done his best to phrase his "appeal" in a way that didn't sound like he was arranging a marriage interview.</p>

    <p>But clearly, he had failed.</p>

    <p>"My Xiaoling doesn't have the least bit foundation in anything at all, let alone sword fighting..." Xiaoling's mom was a little worried.</p>

    <p>"Xiaoling's mom, you don't have to worry about that. I'm just looking for a partner for Chen Chao." Father Chen said, "Our body techniques dojo also offers sword fighting programs. I have a wise saying: when the sword is inseparable from the body, style and the body both blossom<sup>1</sup>."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Yet another meme related to Zhang Jinlai and "The Sixology Scripture.")</dfn>

    <p>Xiaoling's mom: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was astonished. "..."</p>

    <p>What damn "both blossom"...</p>

    <p>"Of course, Xiaoling won't be a training partner for nothing. From now on, you and your daughter can live in the dorm behind the dojo, like some of the kids who board here. Every month, I will pay Xiaoling some money for being a training partner. Xiaoling can also take this opportunity to learn some self-defense techniques, so that she'll no longer be bullied by brats like Tiger Liang in the future."</p>

    <p>Father Chen said in a sincere tone, "Xiaoling's mom, what do you think?"</p>

    <p>Xiaoling's mom was deeply touched by what he said. She was well aware that by doing this, Chen Yi was trying to help her and her daughter.</p>

    <p>At that moment, her heart shook with gratitude as well as fear; more than that, she was in awe of this overwhelming favor she had received. She gazed at Xiaoling, who was playing with Chen Chao nearby.</p>

    <p>Xiaoling hadn't worn such a happy smile on her face in a long time.</p>

    <p>They were originally a pitiful mother and daughter duo who had survived domestic abuse. After Xiaoling's father died, they were no longer subject to the abuse in their lives, but Xiaoling could no longer speak...</p>

    <p>"Then let Xiaoling stay." Xiaoling's mom lowered her head; in the end, she was too embarrassed to inconvenience Father Chen by staying. "I can still live off of recycling... if I move here, no one would be able to find me..."</p>

    <p>Father Chen nodded. "No problem, Xiaoling's mom. Don't worry, you can leave Xiaoling with me. As for the dorm in the back, I'll still leave you and Xiaoling a double room. Come by anytime you want to see Xiaoling and keep her company."</p>

    <p>He knew that this was as far as they could go for now with this matter.</p>
