  <h1>Chapter 1070 Void Gate and Master Li Xiaokai</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that he had underestimated the power of Shadow Dao.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, the Heavenly Dao spell he cast was devoured - this was the first time something like this had ever happened to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"His mind has already been devoured!" All of Er Ha's fur stood on end when it instinctively sensed the danger. This Shadow Dao could devour people's minds; the lower a person's realm, the greater the extent to which they were devoured. What was more, their hidden potential could be stimulated. This was different from Wu Yuanji and Father Zheng; their realms were at a particular level, so their minds hadn't eroded completely.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling frowned slightly. In other words, if ordinary people were boosted with the power of Shadow Dao, they would instantly become world-defying masters. And when their minds were completely devoured, their hidden potential was completely triggered and their fighting strength was brought up to the level of Huaxiu's best; they could even stand shoulder-to-shoulder with members of the Dark Network.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that this was somewhat similar to his Great Enlightenment Spell. Furthermore, it was enlightenment in the opposite direction...</p>

    <p>Since Wang Nuan was still immature, it was very normal for something like this to happen. What Wang Ling needed to do now was prevent the situation from deteriorating further.</p>

    <p>"What should we do?" asked Er Ha.</p>

    <p>"An experiment," Wang Ling said calmly.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>An experiment?</p>

    <p>Listen... was that something a human would say?!</p>

    <p>Compared with Wu Yuanji and Zheng Tianqiang, this undertaker Li Daiwei had been devoured by Shadow Dao to a greater extent, and Wang Ling felt that he was a more suitable test subject for investigating Shadow Dao. Wang Ling currently knew very little about this brand new Great Dao. Although he had plenty of thoughts on it, they were all just ideas - all scientific progress was achieved through repeated experiments and a verification process.</p>

    <p>What Wang Ling needed to do was verify his hypothesis.</p>

    <p>And currently, this undertaker was a relatively more suitable test subject.</p>

    <p>"What strong energy." After devouring Wang Ling's Great Purification Spell, this undertaker licked his lips and felt that he was even stronger than before. When the Great Purification Spell was stripped of its effect, it was just Heavenly Dao energy! For the undertaker, this was just like an energy supplement.</p>

    <p>"Again! Again! Again!"</p>

    <p>After the sweet taste of power, the undertaker's expression gradually became even more deranged, and an extremely fiendish black shadow swirled around his feet in smoky wisps like a tornado.</p>

    <p>"Energy materialization?" Er Ha was so frightened it fell back a few steps, its tail wagging wildly on reflex.</p>

    <p>This was the mark of a supreme-level expert; very powerful experts could give their energy form. According to the Cultivation Encyclopedia, there was a martial dao master called Li Xiaokai whose ability to materialize energy was at the height of perfection. His consummate body technique was unmatched in all of history. Furthermore, Battle Saint Marshal Jiang, one of the Ten Generals, was one of Li Xiaokai's inner disciples.</p>

    <p>But this Master Li later attempted to breach the Void Gate with this body technique. In the end, he was unable to withstand the Void Gate's power to rip things apart, and he vanished inside it.</p>

    <p>The Void Gate, Gate Between Worlds and Heavenly Dao Gate were on par with each other. The difference was that the Void Gate came into being naturally, the Gate Between Worlds was created by Immortal Zhenyuan, and the Heavenly Dao Gate was access which the Heavenly Dao Governing Committee specially set up for those experts who had comprehended Heavenly Dao. To be able to enter the Heavenly Dao Gate meant that one had already touched the Heavenly Dao realm.</p>

    <p>As for this Void Gate, it was more like a wandering secret land in the cultivation world. There were plenty of explorers, but the chances of the Void Gate appearing was extremely low. In addition, there hadn't been any new fluctuations from it in the last thousand years; even the most precise surveillance equipment couldn't accurately detect the Void Gate's location.</p>

    <p>The Void Gate's last appearance had been at Master Li's birthday banquet. On that day, after smashing the void open with his fists, he disappeared.</p>

    <p>Hundreds of years later, the government believed that Master Li was dead.</p>

    <p>But all along his body had yet to be found, and the speculation that he was dead was nothing more than a hypothesis.</p>

    <p>The center of the Void Gate was almost like a black hole. Many people believed that despite Master Li's formidable body technique, it would be very hard to struggle free once you were sucked in.</p>

    <p>Even if his body wasn't ripped apart, he had probably starved to death after a few hundred years of drifting in space without nourishment...</p>

    <p>In spite of that, the people still recognized this master as the one who had accomplished the materialization of energy.</p>

    <p>Hence, every time someone materialized energy, a lot of people couldn't help but associate this phenomenon with Li Xiaokai.</p>

    <p>Even someone like Er Ha, who was from the demon world, knew the name Li Xiaokai, which demonstrated how influential and famous this master had been back then.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't stop this undertaker from performing his trick. He saw the black energy mist at the undertaker's feet gradually take form behind the man and turn into a pure black phantom. This phantom looked like a malevolent spirit, and with two horns on its head and six arms, it made for a very bizarre image.</p>

    <p>"Stand attack<sup>1</sup>!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(In the manga and anime series "Jojo's Bizarre Adventures," a Stand is a psychically generat heed entity which is viewed as a visual manifes tation of a person's fighting spirit.)</dfn>

    <p>Er Ha couldn't help crying out in fear.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't think it was as simple as that.</p>

    <p>This was probably similar to the manifestation of the inner demon. Since this undertaker's mind had been devoured by Shadow Dao, his shadow had become an intelligent lifeform which reflected the most sinister heart demon inside him, and took on its appearance.</p>

    <p>Tentatively call it "Shadow Image."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling silently gave this phenomenon a name.</p>

    <p>For those whose minds had been corroded by Shadow Dao, the Shadow Images probably differed from person to person.</p>

    <p>At that time, the undertaker gazed at Wang Ling, who was expressionless where he stood, and burst out laughing. "Two juniors! Didn't your mothers tell you not to hang around the cemetery in the middle of the night? Go, Soul Devourer! Gobble them up completely!"</p>

    <p>As soon as he said the words, this Shadow Image called Soul Devourer roared on the spot and lunged at Wang Ling and Er Ha with a wide open mouth that was full of fine, black teeth.</p>

    <p>This power...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling frowned.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, Shadow Dao was far more powerful than he had imagined. Such an attack looked simple and straightforward, but it was in fact extremely concentrated and stronger than Wang Ling had ever seen from any expert before.</p>

    <p>In other words, this Shadow Image was able to far better endure beatings than Evil Sword God; at least, Wang Ling didn't think he could kill it with a single slap.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, Wang Ling speculated that normal physical attacks probably wouldn't work on this Shadow Image.</p>

    <p>What should he do?</p>

    <p>Pulverize it from the inside?</p>

    <p>Relaxing his muscles and bones, Wang Ling stretched out his hands and actually pulled the Shadow Image's mouth open to enter its stomach.</p>
