  <h1>Chapter 906 Natural Enemy</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Any girl would find it utterly shameful to have her thighs held aloft, and Bai Qiao was no exception. She now couldn't care less about the battle and instead buried her face in her hands as she sunk into embarrassed bewilderment.</p>

    <p>The last person to demonstrate this state was that book girl on the riverbank <sup>1</sup> . At that moment, their postures and expressions across time and space were practically identical, and Wang Ling couldn't help applauding admiringly in his heart.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Probably a reference to the
Japanese light novel "Book
Girl" or "Literature Girl .. ")</dfn>

    <p>It was clear that Miss Bai Qiao had lost because she forgot who she was; as a scabbard, she and Jingke shared the same origins, and their battle strength was in fact pretty much on par with each other. However, Miss Bai Qiao forgot her identity as a scabbard.</p>

    <p>A scabbard existed to protect the sword.</p>

    <p>But Bai Qiao had fought until she'd gone crazy just now - she'd gotten the order of things confused and had even intended to press this sword down under her. Jingke didn't have a choice except to activate his passive skill "Jingke Assassinates Emperor Qin"... This move in fact existed at the very beginning to limit the scabbard's strength.</p>

    <p>The space layer dissipated, and everything nearby was restored. The moment the space layer was removed, the ruined world returned to its former state, as if nothing had happened; the shattered ground and the smell of gunpowder smoke on the battlefield all vanished.</p>

    <p>Miss Bai Qiao pulled her legs up in her chair, arms around her knees. She was no longer noisy or vented her feelings, and had lost her initial air of arrogance. She just pulled her cap down very, very low on her head and began to sob to a beat. "Boohoo! Boohoo boohoo! Boohoo ah boohoo..."</p>

    <p>Although she was sobbing, Miss Bai Qiao didn't shed a single tear.</p>

    <p>"Is Miss Bai Qiao trying to say something?" Zhuo Yi scratched his head.</p>

    <p>He suspected that she wasn't crying at all, but was trying to convey something. Who would cry in tune, like Morse code?! Wait... this was absolutely Morse sword code.</p>

    <p>Standing next to her, Jingke translated with an expressionless face, "She says, she's too ashamed, to see anyone."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Fang Xing and Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>"Boohoo! Boohoo! Boohoo hoo!..."</p>

    <p>"She says, she'll never, be my scabbard, even if, she's beaten up, and thrown down, from here."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Boohoo hoo! Boohoo hoo! Boobooboo, hoohoohoo!"</p>

    <p>"She says, there's no good ending, for a girl, to fall in love, with a younger man."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>This actually wasn't the first time Miss Bai Qiao had cried. Usually when Boss Jin didn't buy her a game, she would act like this too. However, Boss Jin didn't understand a single word of Bai Qiao's Morse sword code at all.</p>

    <p>In the end, despite Bai Qiao's extraordinary background, she was still a girl.</p>

    <p>More often than not, there was some meaning to a girl's tears.</p>

    <p>But things couldn't go on like this.</p>

    <p>They couldn't ask anything this way, and they naturally had no way of understanding this Miss Bai Qiao's thoughts.</p>

    <p>The only thing they knew was that Bai Qiao still loved city life and didn't want to return to being a docile scabbard.</p>

    <p>They had gone to a lot of trouble to find the scabbard, and naturally, their goal was for the scabbard to return.</p>

    <p>But they couldn't "force" someone else's daughter, either!</p>

    <p>This was all about mutual consent!</p>

    <p>"Miss Bai, if you cry like this, only Lord Jingke can understand you. You need to calm down, then state what you want, and we'll think of a way to resolve it together." Zhuo Yi persuaded her patiently.</p>

    <p>He then pushed Fang Xing forward.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing: "???"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Student Fang Xing... Lord Jingke's happiness is also tied to <em>shifu's </em> happiness. Your male form is the kind girls like the most - it's all up to you!"</p>

    <p>To be honest, Fang Xing didn't want to do it at first.</p>

    <p>He was actually someone who could hold a grudge, and he had been very annoyed when Bai Qiao had ridiculed his gender earlier.</p>

    <p>The "White Night Spell" was a unique spell which he had inherited from his father; he couldn't do anything about the fact that he changed genders when he used the spell. To actually use this point right away in a personal attack on him caused Fang Xing's impression of Miss Bai Qiao to drop into the negatives from the very beginning.</p>

    <p>But Zhuo Yi's words reminded him.</p>

    <p>A sword took after its master.</p>

    <p>A spirit sword and its master had always shared an inextricable bond since ancient times.</p>

    <p>It was like the daughters of noble houses who had servant girls in the olden days; they would naturally care for the welfare of their servant girls. If the latter lived well, these noble ladies would also be happy.</p>

    <p>So, all this was for Wang Ling's honor!</p>

    <p>Thus, Fang Xing took a breath, then bit the bullet and walked forward.</p>

    <p>"Miss Bai Qiao, if there's something you're unhappy about, you can tell me - you can lean on my chest." Fang Xing flipped his blonde hair and held out a gentlemanly hand to Bai Qiao.</p>

    <p>Several minutes later, Bai Qiao stopped sobbing. She then looked up at Fang Xing with a vacuous expression.</p>

    <p>Everyone was exultant at this scene.</p>

    <p>It actually worked?</p>

    <p>When all was said and done, she was still a girl!</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was secretly delighted, but just as he was sighing over the fact that Fang Xing was indeed a ladykiller, who would have thought that Bai Qiao would suddenly slap Fang Xing's hand aside. "Go away! I won't talk to a shitty tranny!"</p>

    <p>Fang Xing (╬̄ ̄): "You're dead..."</p>

    <p>"Student Fang Xing, calm down!" Zhuo Yi hurried forward and held Fang Xing back by his waist.</p>

    <p>"Let me go! I'm going to fight it out with her today!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Everyone knew that Fang Xing's heart had crumbled at that moment.</p>

    <p>Everyone had their own share of pain.</p>

    <p>And while Fang Xing was helpless to do anything about his share, it was in the end something which his father had given to him.</p>

    <p>For a moment, the room fell silent.</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao knew what she had said was wrong, and she pressed her face to her knees again.</p>

    <p>It was just as Boss Jin had said - Bai Qiao was unruly from being raised and spoilt by Boss Jin all these years. Also, her poisonous tongue seemed to be something that came about from her getting angry at her weakass teammates in a game, and which was now a habit for her.</p>

    <p>Calling someone a "shitty tranny" was indeed out of line.</p>

    <p>But it had actually been unintentional; she just hadn't wanted Fang Xing to get close to her just now... she never thought she would blurt out the phrase "shitty tranny."</p>

    <p>"Miss Bai Qiao, since things have already come to this point, there's no harm in speaking plainly - is there anything you want?" Zhuo Yi stared at Bai Qiao and said, "Actually, you going back doesn't mean that you'll lose your freedom. You can still play whatever game you want; no one is going to put restrictions on you. However, you can't forget that you and Lord Jingke are one."</p>

    <p>"I can ask for anything?"</p>

    <p>"Anything." Zhuo Yi nodded.</p>

    <p>Raising her head, Bai Qiao instantly brightened up. "I want to develop a game!"</p>
