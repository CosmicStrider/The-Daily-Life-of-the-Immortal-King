  <h1>Chapter 436 Evil Sword God Steps Into the World </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Space assessment required a certain amount of time. About ten minutes after connecting the Daoist robe with the dimension line, Zhai Yin separated them and returned the tattered Daoist robe to Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>Because he had always thought that Zhai Yin was a man, Lord Diulei wasn't used to changing the way he addressed her. "Brother Zhai Yin..."</p>

    <p>"Hm?"</p>

    <p>Under Zhai Yin's fixed gaze, the young man in white couldn't help wiping at his sweat with the tattered Daoist robe. "That... Miss Zhai Yin... What about the assessment result?"</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin replied indifferently, "The dimension line has finished extracting sword qi data from the Daoist robe, but it will still take time. The assessment report will come out in twenty-four hours."</p>

    <p>She stared at Lord Diulei. "You can leave for today. I'll let you know if there's anything."</p>

    <p>On the side, Wang Ming frowned and couldn't help grumbling, "Twenty-four hours? So long? That shouldn't be..."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin's gaze froze. "I said twenty-four hours, so it's twenty-four hours. Any more nonsense from you and I'll break the machine."</p>

    <p>The corners of Wang Ming's mouth twitched. "Did you eat the wrong kind of meds?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Somehow Lord Diulei felt a very strange malevolent aura around these two people... But actually, the young man in white could roughly guess why this Miss Zhai Yin was so angry.</p>

    <p>At this time, there was no one else in the research institute except for Wang Ming and Zhai Yin. Lord Diulei seemed to have heard Wang Ming mention before that all the other experts in the research institute had been dispatched to do fieldwork all over the place this week and would only be back in two or three days.</p>

    <p>So there was only one truth! — He had become a lightbulb<sup>1</sup>!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A 'lightbulb' in colloquial Chinese has the same meaning as 'a third wheel.')</dfn>

    <p>As Great Death-Courting Senior in the cultivation circle, the reason why so many people admired him, in addition to his chivalrous sense of justice, was because of his high EQ.</p>

    <p>Even in modern cultivation society, people without emotional intelligence couldn't survive. In this circle, learning to "read the situation" was a very important thing.</p>

    <p>Looking at these two people's expressions, something was definitely wrong between them... RBQRBQ<sup>2</sup>...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(RBQ is a derogatory term for women who are treated as sex objects ..)</dfn>

    <p>Believing that he had interrupted their "happy time," Lord Diulei could only force a smile. "Then Brother Wang Ming, I'll take my leave first for today and go back to wait for news."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "Will that be alright?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei shook his head and said, "It's fine, it's fine, the matter between Brother Wang Ming and Miss Zhai Yin is more important..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "Ah?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei patted Wang Ming on the shoulder with the expression of one who had seen through everything. "I won't bother you any longer, but Brother Wang Ming, when you act, you better be careful..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "???"</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, Lord Diulei took Wang Ming aside and said in a very low voice, "I had a friend who lost control of his power before when he was doing it, and directly caused a magnitude ten earthquake... at your realm, Brother Wang Ming, it's better to be careful when you're playing around in the institute..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "..."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Standing at the entrance to the institute, Lord Diulei couldn't help heaving a long sigh.</p>

    <p>He recalled how Great Senior Wang had put a broccoli in his bowl at the dining table in the Wang family's small villa... At that time, Lord Diulei had already sensed how unusual the broccoli was by analyzing the expression in Great Senior Wang's eyes!</p>

    <p>And this time, he had been able to detect the unspoken secret between these two people through their expressions... Damn! He was actually a little genius!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, in an unknown space somewhere...</p>

    <p>This was a grayish-black world; the clouds were all a deep gray and it was dark everywhere.</p>

    <p>On a craggy mountain top, a young man with long black hair sat upright on a large black rock.</p>

    <p>Thick eye shadow lined the corners of his eyes, and sinister bluish-green lines spread out from his cheeks to the back of his neck, giving him a very evil air.</p>

    <p>"Immortal Zhenyuan, you can't trick me! The entrance to the Treasure House is here. I also know you're here... So? Won't you come out to meet this junior?" The evil young man closed his eyes and sneered.</p>

    <p>His voice couldn't be considered loud, but it was so penetrating that it echoed throughout the whole world. This was a powerful sonic spell. Cultivators below the Soul Formation stage would be unable to withstand this burst of spirit power, and would directly explode and die.</p>

    <p>The young man clearly knew that there weren't any living things in this space, but had still done this on purpose.</p>

    <p>This was a provocation!</p>

    <p>And most crucially, the young man felt that creating an echo as he spoke would make him look very cool! He felt that he, Evil Sword God, was a grand Almighty, so his words had to have momentum!</p>

    <p>After a long time, however, there was no response.</p>

    <p>He was very sure that Immortal Zhenyuan was here; even if the latter himself wasn't in this world, he was definitely keeping a very close watch on it.</p>

    <p>About a minute later, the young man felt spiritual pressure fall from the sky, accompanied by a restraining force, and he realized that his sonic spell had been suppressed.</p>

    <p>"Immortal Zhenyuan... do you think with this, you can suppress my echo..."</p>

    <p>"Can suppress my echo..."</p>

    <p>"Suppress my echo..."</p>

    <p>"...press my echo..."</p>

    <p>"My echo..."</p>

    <p>"Echo..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>About five minutes later.</p>

    <p>In the next moment, Evil Sword God opened his eyes and looked at the sky as he couldn't help sneering in his heart. "There is actually a junior in this life who dares to try and use sword qi to track me down? Too ridiculous!"</p>

    <p>Since mastering the power of Sword Dao, Evil Sword God could clearly sense the underlying pattern of sword qi; he had a very clear picture of this massive web-like grid in his mind.</p>

    <p>"Sword, come!" Evil Sword God roared in his heart. He waved his hand, and with a boom, countless light particles converged in the air and coalesced into a purplish-black spirit sword in his hand — this was the sword at the top of the spirit sword power rankings, Heaven-Cleaving!</p>

    <p>Sword in hand, Evil Sword God slashed lightly at the air. Spirit power whistled in the primal chaos of the space, and a gap suddenly appeared.</p>

    <p>This was a space fissure which Evil Sword God had forcibly created using the power of Sword Dao. He used it as a transmission gate, and after using sword qi to create an opening in a particular place, he could freely visit it again whenever he wanted.</p>

    <p>He looked up and laughed loudly at the air. "Immortal Zhenyuan, after I deal with this rude junior, I will look for you again!"</p>

    <p>"...Junior, I will look for you again!"</p>

    <p>"I will look for you again!"</p>

    <p>"Will look for you again!"</p>

    <p>"Look for you again!"</p>

    <p>"For you again!"</p>

    <p>"You again!"</p>

    <p>"Again..."</p>

    <p>After that, Evil Sword God stepped into the space fissure with his sword.</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan: "Psycho..."</p>
