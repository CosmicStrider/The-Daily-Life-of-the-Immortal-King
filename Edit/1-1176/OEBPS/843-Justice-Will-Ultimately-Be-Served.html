  <h1>Chapter 843 Justice Will Ultimately Be Served</h1>

  <div>

    <p>On Saturday August 12th in the fifteenth week of the semester, the covert correction center for abnormal behavior finally received the punishment it deserved. Because this treatment center was a mobile log cabin, and along with Yang Huai's remarkable ability to escape detection, the police had never been able to track it down.</p>

    <p>Although there were many reports on it outside, there were never any good leads to follow up on.</p>

    <p>Actually, Yang Huai's encounter with Wang Ling this time was also Heavenly Dao retribution: he had only moved the mobile log cabin to Songhai city because of Guo Hao's uncle, Guo Feng's case.</p>

    <p>After getting Wang Ling's call, Zhuo Yi and Immortal Toya rushed over, accompanied by more than thirty ambulances and a busload of cultivation security officers who were armed to the teeth.</p>

    <p>Yang Huai was already restrained, and none of the big men he had hired at the treatment center could escape. They all had criminal records, and many were mercenaries on the lowest rung of the Dark Network who did any work for coin. After Yang Huai was punished by Heavenly Dao, the majority were aware that they had lost the upper hand. They squatted with their hands behind their heads in surrender, though some still tried to resist and escape.</p>

    <p>The cultivation security team was thus deployed to control this bunch of people and in case of emergencies.</p>

    <p>"Hello, Director Zhuo, Senior Immortal Toya! Let me brief you on the situation!"</p>

    <p>The security team's Captain Cui, who had a sexy little mustache and sideburns, and looked like an astute and capable person, reported the situation: "Our security team already has the entire park under control. The criminals inside the log cabin as well as those that tried to escape have already been restrained. The ambulances have taken the victims inside the log cabin to various hospitals in central Songhai. The actual number of victims we recovered is 113, 87 of whom are teenagers and 26 are middle-aged or older. This bastard! According to initial estimates, 68 of them have severe injuries, 33 have mild injuries, and the rest have been sent to ICU. This damn bastard!"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "Bastard! What a bastard!"</p>

    <p>"Calm down, Captain Cui, Brother To..." Listening up to this point, Zhuo Yi took a deep breath. "Mothefucker! This damn bastard!"</p>

    <p>Captain Cui: "..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: " <em>Cough cough </em>, excuse me, I forgot myself. Captain Cui, please go on."</p>

    <p>Captain Cui lowered his voice. "Currently, we need to do further professional assessment of the victims' injuries for legal purposes, and we'll need to trouble Immortal Toya for your help!"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya nodded his head. "Captain Cui, rest assured, I have my two disciples here to help me. They may be young, but they already have their medical qualifications, and their assessments are just as valid."</p>

    <p>Captan Cui was blank as he recalled seeing a young boy and young girl who looked extremely professional and were carrying medical kits before he entered the log cabin. They were younger than his daughter! As expected, you couldn't judge a book by its cover.</p>

    <p>"Senior Immortal Toya's two disciples are truly amazing!" Captain Cui was extremely envious. Being a doctor nowadays was easy and lucrative! And the key thing was that it was really cool! He wanted his daughter to study to become one!</p>

    <p>"Captain Cui, you flatter me. My two disciples still have a long way to go." Immortal Toya laughed modestly.</p>

    <p>"Ah, that's right, Director Zhuo!" Speaking up to this point, Captain Cui suddenly asked, "How did you track down Yang Huai's mobile log cabin?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Erm..."</p>

    <p>How could it be him... He just got a call and came over to shoulder the wok!</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi could only randomly make up an excuse. "I just happened to be passing by at the time. I realized there was an unauthorized building here, and I felt something was wrong..."</p>

    <p>"As expected of Director Zhuo! You caught yet another big shot!" Captain Cui laughed heartily. "But thanks to Director Zhuo, this major case is finally solved in our Songhai city! Although the victims are from all over the place, this at the very least proves that we are very good at cracking down on crime!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Be that as it may, don't be too arrogant or complacent. To let this type of person get away with what he was doing for so long is a disgrace to us all."</p>

    <p>"Director Zhuo is right. Yang Huai will finally be punished..." Saying this, Captain Cui continued in a low voice, "I've been thinking, if parallel universes or other world lines really exist, would a Yang Huai as ruthless as this one also exist there, and would he also ever be punished..."</p>

    <p>After he said this, everyone fell silent.</p>

    <p>A moment later, Zhuo Yi raised his head and said resolutely, "There will always come a day when justice is served."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya gave a nod. "What is going to happen to this Yang Huai?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "We've currently sent him to Songhai First Prison, and Warden Liang is preparing to interrogate him. Apart from Yang Huai, all the family members who contacted Yang Huai and sent the victims to him will also be punished, but it will be the victims themselves who will ultimately decide what the punishment will be - unless they receive a document from the victims granting forgiveness, none of these people will be able to escape!"</p>

    <p>After he said this, Zhuo Yi paused, before turning to say to Captain Cui, "Now that this case is under Songhai city jurisdiction, Captain Cui may need to travel to other provinces to arrest people."</p>

    <p>"Handling intercity cases isn't easy..." Captain Cui was a little concerned.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi smiled slightly, since he had already considered this point. He was the director of the General Administration of 100 Schools, but now he had yet another identity â€” team leader of the supervisory and investigation team of the General Office of Strategic Deception and Huaxiu Alliance.</p>

    <p>After receiving his <em>shifu </em>Wang Ling's call, Zhuo Yi had directly contacted Lord Diulei to submit an application to Huaxiu Alliance in the name of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>And that document with its red seal, which was issued by Huaxiu Alliance and authorized intercity arrests, was now in Zhuo Yi's hands! Apart from the seal, there were only sixteen characters on it: <em>Handle each case lawfully! Fairness and justice! Strive harder! Zero tolerance!</em></p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, Yang Huai had been sent to Songhai First Prison for interrogation, but it wasn't coming along smoothly.</p>

    <p>It wasn't that Yang Huai didn't want to confess...</p>

    <p>As soon as Zhuo Yi entered the interrogation room, he saw Warden Liang's dark expression, and the prison officers inside also had helpless looks on their faces.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "What's going on?"</p>

    <p>Warden Liang pointed at the surveillance headphones on the table. "Old Zhuo... Listen for yourself..."</p>

    <p>Puzzled, Zhuo Yi put on the headphones, then heard Yang Huai's dumb-sounding and non-stop laughter: "Hahaha... ahahaha... ehehehe... erhihihi..."</p>

    <p>This was the residual effect from Strength Heavenly Dao tickling Yang Huai's feet. It was obvious that Strength Heavenly Dao had used too much strength, and Yang Huai just couldn't stop for now...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi dropped his forehead in his hand. "Send him to the Mahjong Room for help..."</p>

    <p>Warden Liang nodded his head and couldn't agree more. "Exactly what I was thinking!"</p>
