  <h1>Chapter 397 Stiff Face, Kind Hear </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Full of doubts, Xiao Yin left that night with the box of crispy noodle snacks.</p>

    <p>In theory, he didn't think a mere few packets of crispy noodle snacks would be anything useful. But the monster pen's words to him before he left the villa clearly hinted that these crispy noodle snacks were indeed invaluable. Xiao Yin could only wait until he got home to slowly study their exact effects.</p>

    <p>Although he was a holy beast, it wasn't like he had never heard of crispy noodle snacks.</p>

    <p>For many people, it was a childhood snack that was hard to forget, but as they got older, many of them didn't go out of their way to especially buy crispy noodle snacks anymore. Many people ate them when they were kids in a bid to collect the Water Margin cards inside the packets; once they collected all the corresponding generals, they could claim a prize.</p>

    <p>So why were card games so popular now? It was because the kids who had bought crispy noodle snacks to collect cards back then had grown up.</p>

    <p>Although Xiao Yin was still only a "baby" in terms of the age of a holy beast, there was no way he would open a crispy noodle snack packet and eat it out in public on the streets. Based on age alone, Xiao Yin had actually lived for a very long time. The cultivation calendar started with the founding of Huaxiu nation, but Xiao Yin was born long before that.</p>

    <p>Hence, he had witnessed a lot of history.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, many holy beasts had vanished into hiding, and holy beast numbers had long suffered a devastating blow... it was just Xiao Yin who had survived strongly up to now.</p>

    <p>Sometimes when he reflected on it, he felt that it really hadn't been easy for him.</p>

    <p>When he thought about it carefully, this was probably the first time in his long life that he was in such close contact with human society. He was now living in Lord Diulei's house, which could be considered pretty safe. Furthermore, he had also accepted Wang Ling as his master... Although this master was a little stingy, his strength was absolutely beyond question and he could completely protect Xiao Yin.</p>

    <p>Holy beasts lived very long lives - it was so long that even Xiao Yin didn't know how long he could live for.</p>

    <p>He now had three wishes. One was to find other surviving holy beasts in his lifetime.</p>

    <p>The second was to cultivate hard and break through to become a fifth-class holy beast.</p>

    <p>The last wish was to take good care of Ya Xuan and help the girl figure out her origins. This girl wasn't just naturally muddle-brained, her memories were also scattered and she couldn't remember a lot of things.</p>

    <p>Back when she had been severely poisoned, Xiao Yin had made the mistake of taking her to Immortal Mansion to look for a cure, but had wound up being controlled by the Master of Immortal Mansion. Fortunately, Wang Ling had appeared in time, otherwise Xiao Yin thought he might have died.</p>

    <p>Ya Xuan had saved him before, so he had to repay the favor.</p>

    <p>On the way home, Xiao Yin suddenly missed Ya Xuan a little. He didn't know how she was doing at Cailian Zhenren's place.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was only after Xiao Yin left that Er Ha talked to Wang Ling about his dream of entering Taoist Guang's space while it had been soaking in the holy beast blood. This was the agreement it had made with Taoist Guang - without Taoist Guang's consent, it wouldn't be very good if other people knew about this matter, even if Er Ha didn't really see Xiao Yin as an outsider; after all, the other person had given so much blood to alleviate its narcolepsy.</p>

    <p>But an agreement was an agreement, so before things were worked out, it would be better for it to talk personally with Little Master Ling first.</p>

    <p>To be honest, Er Ha didn't know where to start.</p>

    <p>After thinking about it carefully, it felt that this Taoist Guang was actually quite pitiful. For the sake of pursuing a realm, he had sealed his soul inside the space to look for the predestined person. Now, he was appealing to Little Master Ling to help him find a way to gain his freedom.</p>

    <p>The world changed, and you couldn't get everything you wanted.</p>

    <p>In this world, every time a person needed to make a choice, it would be difficult and they would be extremely hesitant, because most people suffered from acute indecision.</p>

    <p>Er Ha felt that Taoist Guang wasn't a bad person.</p>

    <p>A spirit beast's sixth sense was always very accurate. This kind of sixth sense wasn't limited to perceiving danger and detecting an enemy's aura and realm level, but could also judge a person's nature.</p>

    <p>When it had been in the soul space, Er Ha had felt a sense of closeness with Taoist Guang. Therefore, though it felt that this senior was a little silly and didn't have much integrity, he wasn't a bad person fundamentally.</p>

    <p>Considering how serious this matter was, Er Ha raised its head and wore a rare serious expression. "Wang Ling, I have something to say."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's mind was instantly awhirl at this look - this was the first time since he had brought Er Ha home that it had called him by name, and it had such a serious expression on its face as it wanted to discuss something.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's thoughts instantly started to run wild...</p>

    <p>After all, he was only sixteen years old, and in a sense, he had inherited the gene for writing novels from both Mother Wang and Father Wang; thus, his imagination was even more colorful than that of his peers.</p>

    <p>What on earth did Er Ha want to say with such a serious face on?</p>

    <p>Moreover, there seemed to be a trace of nervousness mixed in with this seriousness, as if Er Ha didn't know how to open its mouth; it was just like a normally honest and well-behaved child suddenly returning home to say that he had a girlfriend, and that she was pregnant!</p>

    <p>â€” Wait a minute!</p>

    <p>Preg... nant?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling couldn't help sucking in a sharp breath of air between this teeth before he asked in a low voice, "What did you do to some other house's female dog?"</p>

    <p>" <em>Pu </em>!" Hearing this, Er Ha almost spat out a mouthful of blood... How could it simply go look for a female dog! Whatever happened, it was going to wait until it had cultivated a human form before going to look for a busty sister!</p>

    <p>The most disturbing thing was that Little Master Ling had spoken telepathically... and not just telepathically, it had also been in a very low voice.</p>

    <p>That was how afraid he was of someone else finding out...</p>

    <p>Er Ha thought that this was the legendary "don't air your dirty linen in public."</p>

    <p>But in a way, it was actually quite happy. At the very least, this proved that it had already integrated into this place and also into Little Master Ling's heart, and that it was truly regarded as a family member.</p>

    <p>In fact, after being around Wang Ling for a long time, Er Ha had already discovered a lot about Ling Zhenren's temperament. He might look like he had facial paralysis, but he had the fiery passion of youth inside him. Er Ha called this: stiff face, kind heart.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling usually didn't like to speak, Er Ha was certain that Little Master Ling's mind was undoubtedly very colorful. Unfortunately, it couldn't learn the "Mind-Reading Ability," otherwise it would be very interesting.</p>

    <p>To put it bluntly, Little Master Ling usually kept people at a distance; he was wary of outsiders, and only associated with people he was familiar with.</p>

    <p>Er Ha suddenly thought of the astrology successor Song Cai whom it had come across during the combined military training for six schools.</p>

    <p>Song Cai was well-versed in astrology.</p>

    <p>Er Ha didn't really believe in this thing at first...</p>

    <p>But looking at this matter now from a different angle, Little Master Ling indeed seemed to have the facial paralysis syndrome that was characteristic of Capricorns!</p>
