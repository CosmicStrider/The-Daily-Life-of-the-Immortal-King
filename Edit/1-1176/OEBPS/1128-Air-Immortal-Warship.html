  <h1>Chapter 1128 Air Immortal Warship</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Sun Rong didn't want special treatment, but she didn't expect things to turn out this way.</p>

    <p>Honestly speaking, however, her driver Old Li wasn't to blame; it was largely her fault for not making herself clear. In the end, Old Li had come straight over to "let them know," and scared this Conch Lady branch manager so much that the latter had returned to work despite being in the middle of a health spa.</p>

    <p>Now, he led a team of staff in saluting Sun Rong respectfully at the entrance, which made her feel quite awkward. However, the truth was that the others didn't really care, because this was very normal to them. After all, Huaguo Water Curtain Group was so rich — so what if it opened a seafood restaurant?</p>

    <p>There were a lot of delicacies on Earth. Before this, Gu Shunzhi and Zhenyuan had always been busy with official and private matters respectively, and were in the Milky Way all year around as they shuttled back and forth between various planets. The only word to describe food on other planets was: terrible... Thus, they would rather eat fasting pills when they were hungry; who knew when was the last time they had feasted on Earth. They also had only gotten a little taste of what it was like to eat with everyone in Number 60 High's canteen in these two days at school.</p>

    <p>Nothing needed to be said about Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi — for this young master and young miss pair who were in dire straits, it didn't matter who paid, as long as they could eat!</p>

    <p>As for Chen Chao and Guo Hao, they cared even less.</p>

    <p>Seeing that everyone didn't particularly care, Sun Rong sighed with relief.</p>

    <p>"Order whatever you want," said Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"Don't be shy. It's Headmaster Chen's treat, after all. Since there are ten of us, it wouldn't be nice if we didn't eat more," said Li Youyue. As a girl, she in fact knew what Sun Rong was thinking; indeed, it wouldn't be very nice to publicly exercise privilege on an occasion like this.</p>

    <p>At that moment, the manager on the side smiled slightly. "Thank you for your understanding. Please rest assured that I'll give you a discount and won't waste Headmaster Chen's consideration for you. You can also rest assured that we use the freshest ingredients. We have a sea king spirit beast that was just caught from the sea."</p>

    <p>"Wow, just caught? How was it sent here?" said Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>"There is a teleportation array in the kitchen. If you like, you can put on the protective suits over there and go in for a look." The manager extended the invitation with a smile.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao and Guo Hao were the sort of people who could never sit still: one was hyperactive and the other was crazy about gossip. Naturally, they wouldn't skip an opportunity to visit the kitchen. Moreover, they would be able to see a sea king spirit beast! On average, these sea kings were at the Golden Core stage, and a special immortal sea fleet was required to catch them! Their meat was incredibly delicious!</p>

    <p>But to eat sea king spirit beast sashimi... three thousand yuan might not be enough for the ten of them.</p>

    <p>Li Youyue was in charge of ordering the food. A dozen minutes or so later, the kitchen in the back served up seafood sashimi, roasts and kebabs. For mains, there were steamed rolls, fried noodles and onigiris. The mains here were different to what was served outside; mains usually consisted of rice and noodles, but as a seafood restaurant, Conch Lady in fact processed sea animal parts and incorporated them into its mains.</p>

    <p>They looked like mains, but were actually still seafood.</p>

    <p>"Eat, everyone." Wang Zhen impatiently picked up a fat squid tentacle with his chopsticks and shoved it into his mouth. His face shone with pleasure; it was so good that he didn't want to say anything at all.</p>

    <p>This was a combination of the freshest ingredients; the chefs had been urgently dispatched from the city center after Sun Rong's driver Old Li had informed the restaurant that she was coming, so naturally, their skills were beyond question.</p>

    <p>They ate over ten plates of seafood, yet the boys actually weren't full. Since cultivators consumed more energy, they naturally had bigger appetites. Only Li Youyue, Sun Rong and Liu Qingyi put down their chopsticks; girls needed to maintain their figures, and eating until they were half-full was fine.</p>

    <p>"Are there any more dishes coming?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, there's still a crunchy fried deep sea giant crispy fish."</p>

    <p>"Deep sea giant crispy fish?"</p>

    <p>"It's a kind of deep sea spirit fish that's very big and which feeds on crispy noodle snacks to survive," Li Youyue explained.</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Wang Ling suddenly felt his spirits lift.</p>

    <p>"Feeds on crispy noodle snacks..." Everyone was petrified. When they heard this, they felt that they were still inexperienced. The world was indeed full of extraordinary things; who would have thought that there would actually be a fish in the vast ocean which had the same taste as Wang Ling! It was crazy!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Friday, November 14th.</p>

    <p>That morning, an air immortal warship shaped like a spirit sword was moored on Number 60 High's sports field. Relying on the repulsive force generated between magnetic spirit stones and the underground spirit veins, it used magnetic power to hover in the air, and the captain piloting the ship didn't have to use the slightest bit of spirit energy to steer it.</p>

    <p>This sort of air immortal warship in fact wasn't rare. Air immortal warships like this one, which relied on magnetic spirit stones, were used all over the world. Given its high performance capability, low energy consumption, and the fact that it was environmentally friendly, it was prized by every country. As long as the underground spirit veins still existed, these air immortal warships would be able to operate eternally.</p>

    <p>The warship moored on Number 60 High's sports field was in fact the small-scale air immortal warship dispatched by Jinghua city's Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools; the Alliance had clearly spared no effort to ensure that all participating high school students would arrive by the stipulated time.</p>

    <p>"Picked up by a magnetic-powered air immortal warship - this is too good!"</p>

    <p>"My god, such fancy treatment! I'm jealous!"</p>

    <p>"I've decided: from now on, I'm going to become a lemon person! If our school team doesn't get into the top sixty schools, I'll be the first to turn into a Warwick<sup>1</sup> and slaughter them!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A monster character in LOL..)</dfn>

    <p>The crowd of spectating students who lined the corridors of Number 60 High chatted among themselves as they looked enviously at Wang Ling and the others, who were on the sports field.</p>

    <p>"Who knows how the competition works?"</p>

    <p>"I heard that they'll report in at five this afternoon, which is then followed by the first elimination report."</p>

    <p>"The elimination starts today?"</p>

    <p>"There are 102 high schools, of course they have to cut down the numbers. Otherwise, it'll be a mess when they're dropped onto Nine Dragon Mountain."</p>

    <p>Everyone was whispering and talking to one another in the corridors.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ling and the others had packed lightly and were ready to go into battle. They formed a neat and tidy row, with Headmaster Chen in the lead at the front of the line. The supporting teacher for the team this time was still Lao Gudong, while San Yuan had also joined the Number 60 High team as the security advisor.</p>

    <p>He had made this decision last night; in any case, he was still on break and had a lot of time to spare, so he wanted to tag along as a spectator for this spectacular competition.</p>

    <p>Mainly, San Yuan was genuinely curious to know if Number 60 High could truly go as far as he had predicted...</p>

    <p>They were clearly just a group of Foundation Establishment high school students, but looking at the row of ten people in front of him, a strange feeling came over San Yuan.</p>

    <p>He felt that there were some people in this line who could send him off to see Buddha with one punch...</p>

    <p>But San Yuan was aware that this was probably just his mistaken impression.</p>

    <p>They were just a bunch of Foundation Establishment high school students - how could it be possible?</p>
