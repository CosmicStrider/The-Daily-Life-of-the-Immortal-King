  <h1>Chapter 1117 Li Youyue</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was clearly unrealistic to consume a coconut-sized spirit fruit in five seconds by eating it. The truth was that when San Yuan acted, Wang Ling had used his King's Eye to clearly analyze everything in front of him.</p>

    <p>Instead of eating that Blue Crystal Fruit, San Yuan used a spell to absorb it into his body; it was probably a devouring spell of some sort.</p>

    <p>The reason to eat was to provide the body with energy. People from the special army brigade didn't care what the food tasted like. As long as it provided their bodies with the nutrients they needed in order to quickly replenish their strength and spirit energy, everything was just plain protein to them.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling had to admit that San Yuan's movements were surprisingly fast. He took off his mask and swiftly used a devouring spell to vaporize and absorb the Blue Crystal Fruit through his pores. It looked like it was eaten in an instant. This was a sort of breathing method. The disadvantage was that you couldn't enjoy the delicious taste of the food itself, but the point was that it could replenish energy quickly.</p>

    <p>And most importantly, it didn't make people feel like they had overeaten. The stomach's capacity was limited, after all. If they didn't control their eating, they wouldn't be able to complete the assignment even if they ate until they died!</p>

    <p>So, San Yuan had already given quite a clear hint. Their training assignment today was to eat something in the shortest time possible. If they simply relied on the ordinary way of eating to achieve their goal, clearly it would be very difficult to achieve the ultimate effect.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw through San Yuan's movements, and naturally, so did Wang Zhen and the others, but they couldn't be too obvious about it.</p>

    <p>But in the end, these were the handpicked elites of Number 60 High. Although there were many hidden bigwigs, the genuine elite students weren't just for show; Sun Rong, Chen Chao, Xia Ming, Super Guo and the others also quickly picked up on this clue.</p>

    <p>The first person to come up with a conjecture was Li Youyue.</p>

    <p>"...Teacher San Yuan probably didn't really eat it with his mouth, right?" Li Youyue said with a smile.</p>

    <p>This was the girl Wang Ling had mentioned before, who was in the same class as Fang Xing and Xia Ming. She was also the class monitor and had outstanding grades.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling heard that her family was in the F&amp;B business, and she was very focused on the research of culinary arts.</p>

    <p>As Class Three's monitor, Sun Rong wasn't as unfamiliar with Li Youyue as Wang Ling was. There were many ways for girls to bond with each other: Going to the bathroom hand in hand and having lunch together were good ways to promote friendship.</p>

    <p>"I heard my grandfather say before that food makes people happy. Thus, cooking food to make it as tasty as possible doesn't just show respect for the food, but is also a way to make the people who eat it feel happy. People who don't taste food properly insult and trample on life."</p>

    <p>Li Youyue's ponytail shook with her movements. There was a special sort of air about her; Wang Ling couldn't be any more familiar with this sort of respect for food and self-confidence in one's cooking.</p>

    <p>Grandfather Wang carried the exact same air.</p>

    <p>People who could make delicious food generally had pretty good temperaments. Li Youyue was clearly a sunny girl. "But my grandfather also said that there is a special exception: Only those who quietly shoulder heavy burdens year in and year out in order to clear the way forward for others, and who make great contributions to the country - only these people have the right to invest more energy elsewhere."</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, she turned to look at San Yuan. "Teacher San Yuan, in order to save time and focus your energy on your mission, It should have been a long time since you've carefully savored the taste of food itself."</p>

    <p>After saying this, Li Youyue didn't continue beating around the bush. They had a time limit, after all, and she immediately put forward her conjecture for everyone to consider.</p>

    <p>"My father said that professional soldiers tend to use a special method to speed up the digestion and absorption of food in the wild. These methods fall under the main category of 'devouring spells.'"</p>

    <p>San Yuan lifted his eyebrows slightly when he heard this. To be honest, he was a little surprised that the Number 60 High students were able to find the key points in this special training so quickly.</p>

    <p>When Headmaster Chen found him, San Yuan had planned out the special training for the next few days.</p>

    <p>Food was only the first lesson in the special training program, as well as the easiest. Considering Number 60 High's overall standard among the other schools, even if these were elite students, San Yuan thought that it would take them some time to see through his trick.</p>

    <p>Who would have thought that a student would pick up on it right away.</p>

    <p>When Li Youyue saw San Yuan's surprised expression, she was even more sure of her guess. "Looking at Teacher San Yuan's expression, I must be right. Moreover, looking at how you absorbed the food just now, this devouring spell should be the kind that absorbs energy through the pores, which is also called the Pore Devouring Spell. From how quickly Teacher San Yuan absorbed it, he's definitely cultivated this technique to its peak."</p>

    <p>"Not bad. I didn't expect you to see through it so quickly." Under the mask, San Yuan's smile was gratified. "You seem to know more than I thought."</p>

    <p>"This is just an accumulation of my knowledge outside school. I believe that the other students also had some idea about it themselves." Done speaking, Li Youyue stepped back and to the side.</p>

    <p>San Yuan shrugged helplessly and took out another Blue Crystal Fruit. "I will now teach you slowly. Just follow me. The Pore Devouring Spell isn't hard to learn, but if you want to get to my level, it'll take a long time and a lot of hard work. Everyone must work hard."</p>

    <p>However, as soon as San Yuan said this, Sun Rong had already cast the Pore Devouring Spell and absorbed the Blue Crystal Fruit.</p>

    <p>"Teacher San Yuan... is it like this?" Sun Rong humbly asked for advice.</p>

    <p>Although she wasn't as fast as San Yuan, he was astonished. "Student Sun Rong, did you learn this spell before?"</p>

    <p>"No, I saw through it when Teacher San Yuan gave us a demo the first time round."</p>

    <p>"..." San Yuan's lips twitched...</p>

    <p>The first time round...</p>

    <p>He didn't teach them the first time round! He had only demonstrated it in passing.</p>

    <p>San Yuan felt that Headmaster Chen had tricked him. When Headmaster Chen came to him, he had clearly said that this was the worst class he'd ever had. In the end???</p>

    <p>This rotten old man was too evil!</p>
