  <h1>Chapter 804 Wang Zhen's Fellow Townsman</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Zhen, a man with an extremely tragic childhood.</p>

    <p>He had been beaten since he was born. In order to stimulate the power of his bloodline to the fullest extent, his parents used this method of thrashing him into obtaining 1500 Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>Because it was so painful, Wang Zhen had used magic once he was an adult to forcefully and selectively eliminate his childhood memories. But when all was said and done, this was only treating the symptoms and not the root cause.</p>

    <p>After countless recurring nightmares, he eventually recovered all the memories he had already discarded...</p>

    <p>When Wang Zhen woke up for the last time, his surroundings were completely different, and he rejoiced when he realized that he had walked out of his nightmares and wasn't dreaming now.</p>

    <p>This place was unfamiliar to him.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, it seemed that he couldn't do anything but open his eyes and mouth to speak...</p>

    <p>Hm...</p>

    <p>Someone had used Heavenly Dao to restrain him...</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen couldn't be any more familiar with this sort of situation.</p>

    <p>Because when he had resisted his parents as a child, the couple had often used Heavenly Dao to restrain him before they started hitting him.</p>

    <p>So many years had passed, but Wang Zhen was still very familiar with this feeling.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Zhen had already worked out a set of ways to break this restraint.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen closed his eyes and began to recite in his heart, "Key which hides the power of Heavenly Dao, show your true from before me. I, Wang Zhen, command you as your master... Release <sup>1</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Sakura's incantation for releasing her Clow Wand in "Cardcaptor Sakura.")</dfn>

    <p>The incantation was done.</p>

    <p>Seconds passed...</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen didn't feel any response.</p>

    <p><em>Release!</em></p>

    <p>He continued to roar in his heart.</p>

    <p><em>Release!!</em></p>

    <p><em>Release ah!!!</em></p>

    <p>After struggling for more than ten minutes, he finally gave up resisting.</p>

    <p>This were Heavenly Dao seals stronger than what his parents used... That terrifying person had cast at least a dozen or so seal-type Heavenly Dao spells on him.</p>

    <p>Now that he had been banned from using his own power of Heavenly Dao, it was unlikely that he would be able to escape.</p>

    <p>This... truly was a flood dashing up against the Temple of the Dragon King <sup>2</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Refers to a misunderstanding
between people on the same
side.)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Zhen thought he had most likely gotten it wrong. This person might not be the real thief... the thief had stolen 1500 Heavenly Dao from him at the very most, while this person was clearly far, far stronger, with power already beyond what Wang Zhen could imagine.</p>

    <p>If that was the case...</p>

    <p>Even if Bai Zhe collected the six Great Outer Dao, it might still be very difficult to fight this person...</p>

    <p>For a while, Wang Zhen lay in bed, countless wild thoughts crowding his heart.</p>

    <p>The most urgent thing right now was to first figure out a way to retrieve his power of Heavenly Dao, and then leave this place.</p>

    <p>Although Earth was just a lesser world in the eyes of the people of Nine-fold Star...</p>

    <p>It was at the same time the most unpredictable planet.</p>

    <p>After all, Dao Ancestor Wang, founder of Nine-fold Star, had ascended from Earth...</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>In the end, he had underestimated this lesser world!</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Zhen heard footsteps approach him.</p>

    <p>"Are you awake, senior?" It was Immortal Toya's voice.</p>

    <p>A man with idol looks then entered Wang Zhen's field of vision; from what he was wearing, he looked like a doctor.</p>

    <p>"You've been in a coma for two days, senior," Immortal Toya said. "You'll find that you can't move; this is because Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch cast several Heavenly Dao suppression spells on you, mainly because he was worried that you would wake up in an agitated state and hurt me."</p>

    <p>"Hurt you?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, senior. You suddenly attacked Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch for no reason at all, so we all agree that you have an anger disorder, and possibly a slight mental problem. We had no choice but to take this step," Immortal Toya answered truthfully.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen smiled bitterly in his heart.</p>

    <p>The other side addressed him as senior, but was still worried that he was the type to willfully slaughter the innocent... Wang Zhen had formidable strength, and while it was true that it was certainly terrifying, he always believed that every debt had its debtor, and he would never hurt the innocent.</p>

    <p>Just like in Night Chief, when Bai Zhe offhandedly killed a technician who had pissed him off, it was still Wang Zhen in the end who saved that innocent little brother...</p>

    <p>Did he seem like such a monster?</p>

    <p>Did they have to treat him like this?</p>

    <p>He didn't understand.</p>

    <p>He was a "senior" who was most like an open book, wasn't he?</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen sighed. "Then how long will I be confined for..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "Since senior is awake, I'll let Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch know right away. As long as we confirm that you're not a threat, I'll naturally help to release you. A lot of Heavenly Dao suppression spells have been cast on senior. You can't cast any spells, nor can you circulate your spirit energy as usual. However, if senior can agree to one thing for me, I can use the privilege Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch gave me and undo the seals on senior's upper body first."</p>

    <p>"Half is good..." Wang Zhen knew he wasn't in any position to negotiate at the moment, so he could only settle for second best.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya narrowed his eyes and said in a serious tone, "The reason why I'm so cautious is that I'm worried that senior might be impulsive and commit irreversible acts."</p>

    <p>As he said this, Immortal Toya took out a golden talisman.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had left this with him after casting the multiple Heavenly Dao seals previously, and it could unlock Wang Zhen's ability to move. To be on the safe side, however, Immortal Toya only restored Wang Zhen's upper body and helped prepare a wheelchair for Wang Zhen... Then, Immortal Toya directly stuck his hands under Wang Zhen's waist and legs.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen was surprised. "The hell?! What are you doing?"</p>

    <p>"I'm going to help senior into the wheelchair," Immortal Toya answered very naturally.</p>

    <p>"Then thank you..." Wang Zhen never thought that not only would he become a paralytic in the world below, someone would even lift him in a princess carry!</p>

    <p>"You're welcome, senior." Immortal Toya smiled slightly.</p>

    <p>If Wang Zhen's friends in the world above found out about this, there would be no place for him to hide his face!</p>

    <p>He didn't come back to his senses until Immortal Toya placed him in the wheelchair.</p>

    <p>Who was he?</p>

    <p>Where was he?</p>

    <p>What was he doing???</p>

    <p>He had come down to the world below to look for a thief, but how had he ended up in this situation???</p>

    <p>Was this truly retribution for fleeing marriage?</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen dropped his forehead into his hand.</p>

    <p>"What's wrong, senior? Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?"</p>

    <p>"My head hurts..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya took out a kitchen knife. "I can do a craniotomy on you!"</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen: "It doesn't... doesn't hurt now..."</p>

    <p>"Alright, senior. If you feel any discomfort, you must tell me." Immortal Toya narrowed his eyes and smiled.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen felt like he could now tell what type of person this doctor was - it turned out that this guy was a hidden yandere <sup>3</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(Refers to somebody who is
sweet and kind at first glance,
but will act obsessive and
violent when it comes to their
crush ..)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Zhen: "By the way... what did you want me to help you with?"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "It's like this, senior: a while ago, I took in a female patient, who has been in a deep coma for a very long time. Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch determined that this patient is likely from the same place as you."</p>

    <p>"The same place?"</p>

    <p>"A person from the world above."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Wang Zhen immediately shook his head. "That's not really possible..."</p>

    <p>There were a lot of processes involved in passing from the world above to the world below, and you had to pass a combined examination and approval check before you were allowed to enter the portal. The issue was that Wang Zhen was very sure that he was the only person who had used the portal recently.</p>

    <p>"Senior, take a look first."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya pushed Wang Zhen in the wheelchair to the bedside of the kun belly girl.</p>

    <p>After getting a clear look at the girl's face, Wang Zhen was so scared that he almost fell off the wheelchair...</p>

    <p>The fianc√©e he was running away from, the young miss of the Liu family... why was she here??!</p>
