  <h1>Chapter 651 Xiao Yin's New Inspiration</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Clear Sky Knife Luo... Xiao Yin felt like he had heard this title from somewhere; it sounded very familiar!</p>

    <p>Because Grandfather Wang had been occupied these last few days with honing his knife skills, Mother Wang was now responsible for making all the meals in the Wang family. Ever since she stopped writing to become a housewife, she actually learned a lot of life skills. Apart from managing the household, she spent all her free time taking all kinds of qualification exams.</p>

    <p>Mother Wang had taken especial care with the dishes tonight and had meticulously planned the pairing of the meat and vegetables.</p>

    <p>The first dish was crystal radish. This was an imported ingredient which was very expensive. However, it just so happened to be on sale today, and she had bought two of them in passing. One she saved for another time, while she sliced the other and stir-fried it with shredded meat. She called this dish: stir-fried radish king.</p>

    <p>The meat dish was vegetable meatballs, also called vegetable lion's head <sup>1</sup> . It was made with a mix of diced broccoli and meat rolled into balls with egg and flour. Broccoli actually wasn't the original vegetable ingredient, but they couldn't finish all the broccoli they had at the Wang family home. As a result, every time Mother Wang left home, she would take a few bags of broccoli with her to give out.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is the name of a dish made with pork meatballs.)</dfn>

    <p>Although broccoli had been used as the vegetable substitute, which made the lion's head less chewy, that didn't stop Wang Ling from enjoying it. Since it was a little more troublesome to make this dish, Mother Wang would usually only make it if they had visitors, which proved just how much Mother Wang liked Xiao Yin!</p>

    <p>Oh, that was right, Mother Wang named the dish: lion's head eating vegetables.</p>

    <p>With the remaining two dishes, one was Wang Ming's favorite coral grouper; it was a pity he wasn't there today. The other dish was tonight's soup; it was a mushroom soup made with imported C mushrooms and bottled mushrooms <sup>2</sup>, which was very good for the intestines.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(C菌 is a popular uploader/live streamer,and 瓶子菌 is possibly the same ..)</dfn>

    <p>"Miss Silver, you're so thin, eat more. If it's not enough, there's more in the pot." Mother Wang smiled at Xiao Yin as she ladled out a bowl of rice.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin lowered his head shyly. "It's enough, enough. I actually eat very little, usually!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Er Ha cast disdainful looks at him one after another.</p>

    <p><em>I've never seen such a shameless Silver!</em></p>

    <p>Holding the bowl and chopsticks, Xiao Yin didn't dare eat until he saw Wang Ling pick up some food. "That, where's Senior Wang?"</p>

    <p>Master's lord father! He remembered that the few times he had visited the Wang family's small villa, he had had very little opportunity to see Senior Wang.</p>

    <p>"He's busy writing, let's eat first. He's always like this." Mother Wang smiled helplessly. "I'll deliver some food to him later."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin gazed at the second floor and was unable to stop chattering. "What book is Senior Wang writing? Can I read them?"</p>

    <p>"It's an online serialization called <em>The Live Streaming Life of the Immortal King </em>; his earlier book is called <em>Let Go of That Wet Nurse </em>," Er Ha replied. "You can search for them online, but remember, you must subscribe to the official ones!"</p>

    <p>"Of course!" Xiao Yin vowed in reply.</p>

    <p>He silently recorded down the titles of these two novels in his mind. They were Senior Wang's masterpieces, he definitely had to read them! Not only that, he should put down the main points in a notebook as well!</p>

    <p>He suddenly recalled seeing Lord Diulei reading a book when the latter had spare time at home, and not just reading but also studying from it. Xiao Yin now completely understood — it turned out that Lord Diulei was reading Senior Wang's novel!</p>

    <p>If Master was already so awesome, then how strong was Senior Wang... there definitely had to be some lessons to be gleaned from the novel!</p>

    <p>At night, it was Lord Diulei who specially came to the Wang family's small villa to bring Xiao Yin home, because he was afraid that if Xiao Yin went back on his own, the latter would be detained and taken to the police station yet again. Thunder could be said to be taking great pains with this...</p>

    <p>On their way home, he noticed that Xiao Yin unexpectedly wasn't watching anime or online soap operas, but was reading an e-book very seriously. He was straightaway startled. "What are you reading? So serious!"</p>

    <p>"Senior Wang's great work! You've been reading it all this time right? ... Can you lend me your notes to copy later?" Xiao Yin looked at him.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei broke out in a sweat. "I don't have notes... they're just some of my thoughts. Senior Wang's book is a little deep and I haven't completely understood it yet! If you're interested, we can study it together!"</p>

    <p>For Lord Diulei, this was certainly a problem.</p>

    <p>Tens of millions of people chased Senior Wang's novels. A casual call for monthly votes, and his ranking crushed everything else. So many people read his books, but how many truly understood them? Perhaps until now, no one had gleaned any sort of lesson from Senior Wang's novels; they definitely wouldn't be so easily understood.</p>

    <p>The profound principles of Heavenly Dao required careful examination. In the past, it was possible to take over a hundred years of persistent study to uncover the profound meaning in an ancient arts volume.</p>

    <p>Senior Wang's new book had only been serialized for a few months; how could anyone possibly comprehend it so easily?</p>

    <p>After some thought, Xiao Yin frowned. "Thunder, did we skip some step, so we have no way of comprehending what Senior Wang wrote?"</p>

    <p>Thunder thought this sounded interesting. "For example?"</p>

    <p>"I think what we lack is practice!" Xiao Yin turned off his phone. Although he had only just started reading the novel, he was so excited as he was seized by a strong urge to write.</p>

    <p>Previously, Xiao Yin had wondered if there was a way for him to make money without needing to leave the house! He had looked online for a long time and had only found some positions for freelance typists, half of which were probably fake.</p>

    <p>After living at Lord Diulei's place for so long, Xiao Yin felt that he needed to learn to rely on himself!</p>

    <p>And just then, he was hugely inspired by "Senior Wang."</p>

    <p>"Thunder!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin looked at him with a very earnest expression.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "???"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "I'm going to write novels!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Sometime that night, Xiao Yin, who already couldn't hold back his desire to write, quickly started to write in the vein of a novel. Lord Diulei sat next to him and waited, looking forward to seeing what kind of great work he could create...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "Lord Diulei, what do you think about this opening?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "What's your theme?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was full of confidence: "It's a story about Senior Wang's image as a writer, and is about a guru author who falls and struggles to get back on his feet."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei looked at the screen.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin's book started like this...</p>

    <p><em>Average subscription: 30.</em></p>

    <p>The young man was expressionless as he stared at the background stats. His sneer was faintly self-mocking. His fists were clenched so tight that his slightly sharp nails dug into his palms.</p>

    <p>"Wang Situ, average subscription: 30 readers, loser third-tier writer!" After looking at this internal data, an editor sent the announcement in an indifferent tone to the authors' group.</p>

    <p>It wasn't the least bit surprising that the editor's voice message would cause a sensation in the group.</p>

    <p>"Average subscription is 30? As I expected, this trash writer is a loser!"</p>

    <p>"This trash is a real embarrassment to us authors!"</p>

    <p>"If it wasn't because he's the editor's friend, the website would have dumped him a long time ago."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, in the editing department, the editor who had announced the news sighed deeply.</p>

    <p>The editor-in-chief next to him patted his shoulder. "Two years ago, he still had an average subscription of five thousand. It's been two years... he's slipped backwards instead of making progress. If it continues like this, he might even drop under the loser third tier."</p>

    <p><em>...</em></p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "What do you think?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>
