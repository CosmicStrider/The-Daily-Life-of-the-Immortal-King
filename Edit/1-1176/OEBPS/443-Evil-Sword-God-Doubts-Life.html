  <h1>Chapter 443 Evil Sword God Doubts Life </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Lord Diulei hadn't expected the bigwig in his hand to be so fierce. Although it knew that Evil Sword God was near invincible in a range of ten meters, it still took him flying across the sky.</p>

    <p>In contrast to the roiling demonic purple sword qi on the other side, when Jingke moved, easily taking Lord Diulei along with it, there weren't any exaggerated light effects; it was merely covered in a layer of light brown spirit light, just like a Daoist robe to protect the body.</p>

    <p>This sword thrust forward in the direction of Evil Sword God's "Hyper Beam," creating an elegant arc in the sky.</p>

    <p>Without any gaudy sword skills, a sword and a man gracefully lunged forward just like that.</p>

    <p>And when the brown sword qi of the peach wood sword made contact with the Hyper Beam that had been discharged from afar, an amazing thing happened. Like a miracle descending, the brown sword qi which had a distinctly weak appearance split this Hyper Beam, as thick as a qiulong, all the way down the center!</p>

    <p>Sky... Sky Flying Immortal <sup>1</sup> ?</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A sword art practiced by the character Ye Gucheng in the wuxia "Lu Xiaofeng" novel series.)</dfn>

    <p>Evil Sword God's complexion turned pale with shock; this move by the young man in white reminded him of a legendary sword art... It was a complex style made simple with small moves that generated large effects, specially used to counter large-scale attacks and able to cancel out a formidable sword technique like the "Hyper Beam"!</p>

    <p>But this divine sword art had already vanished earlier on. Whether it was his<em>shizun </em>Sword Immortal Fan Rui or the Magnificent Immortal's Depository of Buddhist Texts, currently the largest in the cultivation circle, records of this sword art had long disappeared; forget the records, not even an image of the title page existed...</p>

    <p>But why was this mongrel cultivator in white able to use it?</p>

    <p>Pondering this, Evil Sword God could think of only one possibility, and that was the peach wood sword which the mongrel cultivator in white was holding that was leading him into battle.</p>

    <p>If so, a lot of things would make sense.</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God exhaled, and the Heaven-Cleaving sword spirit behind him let out a long shrill cry. True Immortal spirit power fluctuated wildly all around them, shaking the school sports field in the intrinsic spirit field and tearing down the dozen or so palm trees. All the windows of the school building shattered, and the entire building collapsed in utter ruin under the violent sound.</p>

    <p>Why did every single Almighty who stepped into an arena like to showcase their presence by destroying buildings?!</p>

    <p>Holding Jingke, Lord Diulei also sighed in his heart. It was a good thing this was just the intrinsic spirit field modelled on Brother Ling's school.</p>

    <p>If this really had been Number 60 High School, the True Immortal roar just now would have finished off all the students and teachers in the school...</p>

    <p>"Your friend's spirit sword is actually a little interesting..." Evil Sword God licked his lips, and the demonic purple sword light rendered his long pointed tongue a different color.</p>

    <p>"Hehe, I'll let you experience my ten-meter Sword Dao!" Evil Sword God said in a deep voice.</p>

    <p>With that, the Heaven-Cleaving sword spirit behind him rose suddenly and sharply, and the skeleton grew to fully twice its size.</p>

    <p>Then, Sword Dao gravitational force as powerful as a planet was generated, and runes leapt up to turn into a circle with a ten-meter radius!</p>

    <p>In an instant, Lord Diulei could feel a great gravitational force dragging him in, even with the sword.</p>

    <p>In a flash, he was pulled into that ten-meter radius Sword Dao circle.</p>

    <p>The moment he entered the Sword Dao circle, a ring of light came down to envelop him.</p>

    <p>"A depletion ring?" Lord Diulei squeezed his hands and felt a little feeble, but very quickly, brown sword light split away from Jingke's body to weaken this depletion force and make him feel a little more comfortable.</p>

    <p>But instead of saying anything, he covered his chest with a petrified expression. "What's this?"</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God smiled and said, "This is the holy depletion light carried inside my ten-meter sword circle. How is it? Don't you feel weak? Can't exert your strength? Feel a little like sweating? Even my <em>shizun </em>Fan Rui and Senior Brother Yi Jianchuan experienced the same thing in this circle, what more to say you!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Jingke: "..."</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God: "What? Are you afraid now? If you can't undo my depletion ring, you won't be able to move at all inside my ten-meter sword circle. Of course, I am invincible to begin with!"</p>

    <p>But as soon as he said that, Jingke pulled Lord Diulei into making a move once more.</p>

    <p>It looked like Lord Diulei was wielding the peach wood sword to draw a six-pointed star in the air. He then recited a spell as he held the sword in his left hand and formed hand seals with his right hand.</p>

    <p>Brilliant blue spirit light instantly burst out of the six-pointed star inside the ten-meter sword circle. The air was dotted with stars, as if they were inside a sea of them.</p>

    <p>Under the light of these stars, all the depletion effects faded away...</p>

    <p>It just looked like a minor spell, but was Evil Sword God greatly shocked. "Nine Heavenly Stars Art <sup>2</sup> ?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is an outstanding technique mastered by the protagonist of the xuanhuan novel of the same name.)</dfn>

    <p>Yet another legendary sword technique...</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God narrowed his eyes, his heart greatly shaken. This was a legendary sword technique used to purify DEBUFFs <sup>3</sup> , and which had also been lost...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>("Purify" and "Debuff" are two game terms. A "Debuff" is a status effect that negatively affects a character's performance. "Purify" means to dispel negative effects ..)</dfn>

    <p>Actually exhibiting two legendary sword skills one after another?</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God suddenly felt a little tired.</p>

    <p>"Is this the 'Nine Heavenly Stars Art'?" Evil Sword God asked.</p>

    <p>"That's right," Lord Diulei replied. After listening to Wang Ling's telepathic message, he also had a basic understanding of this sword skill. "Also, this sword art is the most advanced of the ninth-class sword arts in the Nine Heavenly Stars Art â€” Heavenly Body East Art!"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Evil Sword God's face immediately darkened. This was actually the most advanced of the ninth-class sword arts. No wonder it could dispel his holy depletion light so easily...</p>

    <p>At this point, he suddenly started to doubt life.</p>

    <p>"It's, over, now..." Lord Diulei was holding the peach wood sword.</p>

    <p>But at that moment, the voice that came out of his mouth actually wasn't his, but Jingke's.</p>

    <p>Eyes shining with brown spirit light, his gaze was fixed on Evil Sword God. "Plebe... Have you, ever seen, a Sword Falling From the Sky?"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked up at the scene.</p>

    <p>Just as Evil Sword God had said, everyone understood the "Great Sword Dao Spell" differently and grasped different things about it.</p>

    <p>If the Sword Dao attribute that Evil Sword God had grasped was "invincible within ten meters," then the attribute that Wang Ling had grasped was "omniscience." All Sword Dao under heaven was contained in it, and there was no sword skill that Wang Ling didn't know; it was just that he didn't bother to use them in his daily life.</p>

    <p>That was because up until now, all the enemies he had encountered could be defeated with his fists and feet alone. In many cases, Wang Ling didn't think it was worthwhile to use weapons...</p>

    <p>The "Great Sword Dao Spell" attribute which Wang Ling had was omniscience, and he had long already transmitted through the spirit sword contract all the sword skills that he had mastered to Jingke as his spirit sword.</p>

    <p>Of course, this was a legitimate, officially authorized copy, different from the shameless behavior of using some quick video software to steal the background data of other online users.</p>
