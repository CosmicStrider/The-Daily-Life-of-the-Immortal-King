  <h1>Chapter 706 Xiao Yin's Skin!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>These two days, there was one more person at Lord Diulei's villa.</p>

    <p>It was the human form of the Wuji Umbrella's weapon spirit, a young lady called Wuji.</p>

    <p>In theory, weapon spirits didn't need to eat, but Lord Diulei was happy that Wuji was very fond of eating broccoli.</p>

    <p>It was July 27th on the fourteenth Thursday of the semester.</p>

    <p>Wuji was perfectly content as she ate two full basins of assorted broccoli salad. Her face all wrapped up in bandages, she would only remove the lower half when she ate. Despite the fact that they didn't know what she actually looked like, it was easy to tell, just from the lower half of her face, that Wuji was a very pretty girl.</p>

    <p>"Are the other holy beasts truly no more?" Xiao Yin cupped his chin and gazed fixedly at Wuji.</p>

    <p>Heaving a sigh, she put down the fork she was using to eat the broccoli with. "That is the three hundredth and second time you've asked this question in two days. The one thing I am very sure of is that since my creation, you are the only living holy beast I've ever sensed."</p>

    <p>"Maybe you overlooked something?"</p>

    <p>"No way." Young lady Wuji quickly shook her head like a rattle-drum. "You should know that I'm a spatial magic weapon. After I was created, I traveled with that President Bai all over the place and never sensed the aura of any other holy beast, but when I arrived in Songhai city, I detected Mr Yin's scent!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei nodded. He believed Wuji's words; although this girl had been a little conflicted when she had first arrived, ultimately she was no match for the ten flame purification spells which Wang Ling had deposited inside the Soul Suppression Ring.</p>

    <p>Wuji had had a taste of Wang Ling's strength and was afraid of possible consequences...</p>

    <p>Although she didn't know what this flame purification was, it sounded really scary!</p>

    <p>If she was touched even a little by this thing, would she be utterly annihilated?</p>

    <p>Thus, when Wuji spoke, her gaze never once strayed from Lord Diulei's ring.</p>

    <p>In this situation, it was even less likely that she would lie.</p>

    <p>Of course, in the face of Xiao Yin's repeated inquiries these two days, it actually wasn't as if Lord Diulei couldn't understand him.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was very innocent by nature. Initially, he had held on to the faint fantasy that even if there was only one other holy beast left in the world, the holy beasts in some sense couldn't be considered truly extinct...</p>

    <p>But now, faced with this cruel reality, Xiao Yin truly found it a little hard to accept.</p>

    <p>Hence why he kept asking Wuji the same question.</p>

    <p>After thinking for a while, Wuji finally said to Xiao Yin, "Mr Yin, of course you don't have to be too discouraged. There are some places I cannot search, like the demon world, or outer space... If there are remaining holy beasts that have fled to the demon world or left Earth, I won't be able to detect them."</p>

    <p>Although these words were actually meant to comfort Xiao Yin, after Wuji said them, she felt even more sorry for him...</p>

    <p>"Then the truth of the holy beasts going extinct back then - was it really President Bai who caused it?" asked Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>Wuji nodded. "That's right, he was the ringleader! But I don't know very much about it, since I was created after that massacre."</p>

    <p>And the person who had created her was none other than that Elder Ji Xing.</p>

    <p>"What a shame, I was young and didn't know anything, so I was under their thumb!" Saying this, Wuji clenched her teeth in resentment.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>"Of course, if I can expand my detection range, I might be able to search some other places. Also, I have a very strong feeling." When she said this, Wuji revealed an enigmatic expression. "I think that there's definitely a secret inside Beast King's Remains. If you want me to do another search... the demon world, Beast King's Remains, beyond the Milky Way - I can search all these places. If I can move up a level, my detection range will be able to cover a whole planet!"</p>

    <p>The corner of Lord Diulei's lips twitched. "Beyond the Milky Way...?"</p>

    <p>That was an endless place...</p>

    <p>Even if Wuji's detection range could be upgraded to cover an entire planet, there were trillions of planets outside the Milky Way; it would be dead impossible to go over all of them!</p>

    <p>This was a pretty ridiculous idea. In contrast, Lord Diulei thought it would be easier to look for clues in Devil Valley.</p>

    <p>It was when Devil King had been sleeping back then that it had been stewed and turned into a pot of meat broth...</p>

    <p>Of course, there wasn't enough evidence to prove that Devil King had truly been stewed to death... But there had been absoluely no sign of Devil King all these years, and it was difficult to differentiate between what was real and what was fake when it came to information on Devil King.</p>

    <p>"I have a feeling that there's definitely some secret to do with Devil King in Devil Valley."</p>

    <p>Wuji said very earnestly, "I've always had the same dream about Beast King's Remains... Although I couldn't see it very clearly, there's definitely something there! You must believe a woman's intuition!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Although Wuji was now in the form of a young lady, a weapon spirit's appearance was based on their master's will; the forms that they turned into were the ideal types of the first generation owners.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Wuji... theoretically speaking, weapon spirits don't have genders."</p>

    <p>"Impossible!"</p>

    <p>Wuji felt the lower part of her body and confirmed her gender again. "I don't have that thing!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei didn't want to argue about it, and said, "Do you have a way to expand your detection range?"</p>

    <p>"Of course!"</p>

    <p>Wuji replied, "You should know by now that in order to make me, that insane Bai Zhe collected forty-nine holy beast skins, and was only missing one to complete the set. As long as I have the last one, I can complete my upgrade!"</p>

    <p>When she said this, her gaze shifted to Xiao Yin on the side, which sent a chill through him. "Shit... what do you want to do to me?!"</p>

    <p>Wuji: "Actually I don't need much... If you cut a bit off, Mr Yin, that'll be enough."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "No way! All of my body belongs to Master!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Wuji threw up her hands. "Then there's no other way. Of course, we can always search for Devil King; the skin of the king of holy beasts is multi-purpose; it'll be fine to mix it in."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei kneaded his brow as he felt his head hurt slightly. He then asked, "As long as it's skin from Xiao Yin's body, it'll do?"</p>

    <p>Wuji thought for a second before nodding. "That's right!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei smiled and looked at Xiao Yin. "Brother Xiao, start scraping your feet from today onwards and collect the skin."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>Wuji: "..."</p>
