  <h1>Chapter 88 Your Son Looks Just Like You </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't think it was a good idea. It would have been fine if Er Ha was just an ordinary family dog, but it was in essence a demon king. Although its prowess was not what it used to be, it was still dangerous.</p>

    <p>He could clearly sense that Er Ha's aura was a lot heavier than at the start of the semester, which was enough confirmation that it hadn't given up its toad life while it continued to struggle to get used to its current body. Besides that, it was also attempting to cultivate again.</p>

    <p>It had been peaceful at Number 60 High School during the few days Wang Ling had been participating in the spirit sword exchange meet; Er Ha hadn't taken the opportunity to create mischief in his absence. From day to day in its life after rebirth, it learned to be a dog, allowed students to pinch its face and was molested by Er Dan the parrot.</p>

    <p>Er Ha was actually very popular in Number 60 High School since a green akita was really eye-catching. Its reputation didn't stop at Grade One, Class Three, but had also spread to other classes. Every day, students from the neighboring classes and even seniors would come bearing food for Er Ha: dog biscuits, sauce bones, beef and so on...</p>

    <p>During this time, Er Ha learned a lot of things. For example, it had become more proficient at barking, and even its posture as it gnawed on a sauce bone was a lot more dog-like than it used to be... looking at the situation from all these aspects, Er Ha appeared to be working hard to cast aside its former identity and to blend into the communal life at Number 60 High School as it strove toward becoming a dog god after rebirth.</p>

    <p>But being able to gain other people's trust didn't mean it could also gain Wang Ling's trust. In his opinion, Er Ha still needed some training before it could become a truly loyal dog. No matter who brought it home, he was still worried.</p>

    <p>The class discussed it animatedly. Apart from four students who said that they couldn't keep dogs at homes, the remaining eleven students in Grade One, Class Three all showed their keen desire to take in Er Ha.</p>

    <p>According to Guo Hao, only someone who was a professional could keep a dog as a pet. Wang Ling certainly didn't doubt the professionalism of this masochist. If Er Ha was handed over into Guo Hao's care, Wang Ling would feel relatively reassured, since Er Dan the parrot wasn't an ordinary bird. It was a bird that could even train its owner, so he reckoned that Er Ha might find it very exciting if Guo Hao brought it home...</p>

    <p>When it was time to make the final decision, Teacher Pan Shengcong realized that she had ultimately underestimated the weight of the position which Er Ha held in the students' hearts.</p>

    <p>Seeing how heated the discussion in the class had become, she cleared her throat and said, "How about we let Er Ha decide?"</p>

    <p>After all, it wasn't an ordinary dog, and this was the moment for it to demonstrate its intelligence.</p>

    <p>Hearing Teacher Pan's words, Er Ha stood up excitedly.</p>

    <p>After being stifled in school for so long, it finally had the opportunity to go out!</p>

    <p>A lush world of temptation, adorable girls with plump boobs, and also fatter... flies! The flies in Number 60 High School were so skinny and tiny, and Er Ha had long wanted to look for more elsewhere!</p>

    <p>But very quickly, the excitement on its face was snuffed out with one look from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>It had seen this look before.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, it was a look that almost instantly evoked the innermost terror in Er Ha's soul.</p>

    <p>This was the legendary Killer Eye from when Wang Ling had attended the placement meeting at the start of the semester...</p>

    <p>At last, Er Ha dejectedly went to Wang Ling's feet, its ears drooping as it obediently lay down on the floor, not daring to resist or do anything rash at all.</p>

    <p>Mm, very sensible...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded in satisfaction.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After school was over, Wang Ling found a quiet corner, directly picked Er Ha up in his arms, and in the blink of an eye, returned to the Wang family's small villa in the outskirts.</p>

    <p>Er Ha was stunned! Bloody hell?! What was this? Instant transport? One of the Three Thousand Spells, the Great Instant Transport Spell?</p>

    <p>As a reborn demon king, Er Ha still knew the basics. It was said that there were three thousand spells of immeasurable strength, and that each of these so-called Three Thousand Great Spells would lead to the final destination, the Heavenly Spell.</p>

    <p>The ancient saying was that it would take one hundred years to fully comprehend one of the Three Thousand Great Spells, a thousand years to cultivate it and ten thousand years to reach the end of understanding.</p>

    <p>A sixteen-year-old youngster was actually capable of using the Three Thousand Great Spells... Er Ha felt that its one thousand years of cultivation as a demon king were all just chopped liver.</p>

    <p>There was probably no one else in the world who was more acquainted with the truth about Wang Ling and how fearsome he was than Er Ha, since it had personally experienced his prowess six years ago as a toad. At just ten years old, Wang Ling had killed it, an all-powerful, millennial demon king from the Gate Between Worlds, with just one punch. And six years later, he had clearly grown even stronger.</p>

    <p>Er Ha couldn't help feeling a little dejected when it thought about this, even if it was a demon king. For the sake of its self-esteem, it had told itself repeatedly that it had to advance diligently and work hard; who knew, there might still be a chance for it to salvage its vitality... but in front of Wang Ling, it always felt powerless.</p>

    <p>Even more appallingly, as it was being held by Wang Ling now, the thought "It's just better to obey..." had flashed through its mind.</p>

    <p>Er Ha facepalmed, feeling that its integrity as a demon king had been completely annihilated.</p>

    <p>When he opened the front door, Wang Ling found two unfamiliar men inside the house. Both of them wore suits and sunglasses, and one was carrying a suitcase. With one glance, Wang Ling saw into the suitcase and discovered that it was packed with wads of cash amounting to at least a million yuan.</p>

    <p>Father Wang stood in the entrance hallway as he solemnly showed the two men in suits the door with an unsmiling face. "Goodbye, please see yourself out."</p>

    <p>Looking at this scene, Wang Ling knew that negotiations were already over.</p>

    <p>The two men in suits gave him a look. "This is...?"</p>

    <p>"This is my son," Father Wang said.</p>

    <p>"Your son looks just like you!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Father Wang's lips twitched abruptly. "..." <em>Fuck, if he doesn't look like me this father, is he supposed to look like you?!</em></p>

    <p>Wang Ling knew that the men in suits were blatantly trying to curry favor with him. Sure enough, one of the men in suits offered him his hand. "Hello, handsome young man, I'm from Landscape Manor."</p>

    <p>Landscape Manor? After some careful recollection, Wang Ling suddenly remembered he had heard this name from somewhere; it seemed to show up often in TV ads, and appeared to... sell wine?</p>

    <p>He was holding Er Ha so he had no hands free. Seeing this, the man awkwardly took back his hand and instead said, "It's like this, our Landscape Manor is very interested in the antique mask which Mr Wang bought not long ago and we are willing to purchase it at a high price. We are almost done with today's negotiations, and we came here in full sincerity..." At the word "sincerity," the man didn't forget to lift the suitcase. "I hope Mr Wang and his esteemed father will think it over. We'll call on you again in two days."</p>

    <p>Then, the two men removed the shoe protectors on their leather shoes, bowed respectfully to Wang Jiao and Wang Ling, and turned away to leave the Wang family's small villa.</p>

    <p>Out of the corner of his eye, Wang Ling gave their shoes a look... what the hell! The price of just one pair was enough for him to buy a full ten years' worth of crispy noodle snacks!</p>
