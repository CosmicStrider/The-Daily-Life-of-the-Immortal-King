  <h1>Chapter 453 Daoist Guang's Battlegrounds </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling actually didn't pay much attention to games because they didn't make sense to him. In his view, no matter how much time ordinary players spent developing their characters, they probably couldn't compare with those who spent six yuan on an initial large gift pack <sup>1</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(i.e. the special deals for buying inventory to equip your character.)</dfn>

    <p>Money should be spent where it counted the most!</p>

    <p>Life was about meticulous planning and careful accounting.</p>

    <p>Just like how Father Wang would use all sorts of petty excuses to dock Wang Ling's pocket money; Wang Ling certainly felt wretched about it. Furthermore, he had an agreement with his parents where he wasn't allowed to earn extra money using his cultivation abilities. Wang Ling understood the reason behind this: on one hand, it was to stay low-key, and on the other, the sole request his parents had of him at this stage was to study well.</p>

    <p>This was what a sixteen-year-old teenager should be doing!</p>

    <p>So when Wang Ling had requested that the delivery fees be included in his purchases several times before, was he really being stingy? Did he really care about the postage fee? This was for the sake of saving enough money to buy practice exercises in order to study well so that when he graduated in the future, he could give back to society.</p>

    <p>Like what he had said earlier.</p>

    <p>Money should be spent where it counted the most!</p>

    <p>When playing games, money should be spent where it counted the most! (Not including crispy noodle snacks in the game store.)</p>

    <p>When buying snacks, money should be spent where it counted the most! (Not including crispy noodle snacks.)</p>

    <p>When buying drinks, money should be spent where it counted the most! (Not including crispy noodle snack-flavored ones.)</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>But even if Wang Ling didn't touch games much, young people definitely found it easier to adapt to new things compared with the elderly. Daoist Guang hadn't learned to use a computer for very long and was still at the stage of feeling his way through it. Compared with a lot of professional players, he knew very well what his status was: he was an entertainment live streamer who was doing his best to improve his skills.</p>

    <p>From the bullet messages on screen, Wang Ling could tell that a lot of newcomers had joined the live stream room out of curiosity after hearing about an old fellow playing online games on an island.</p>

    <p>Actually, a lot of people weren't interested in how good his gaming skills were; they were watching him purely for his commentary as he played.</p>

    <p>The main thing was that Daoist Guang's live stream had a variety of content given his environment.</p>

    <p>From eight to ten o'clock in the morning was Daoist's Guang island survival segment.</p>

    <p>He would demonstrate how to create all types of magic treasures bare-handed for survival in a wild environment.</p>

    <p>From noon to two o'clock in the afternoon was his island delicacy segment.</p>

    <p>He would demonstrate how to use the island's natural resources to survive in a wild environment as well as which animals and insects were rich in protein.</p>

    <p>After that, the period from six to nine o'clock was when Daoist Guang gamed...</p>

    <p>A lot of viewers would recommend other games to him via the bullet messages, and he would very attentively write the titles down in a notebook as he planned to give them a shot at a later date.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling opened the live stream room, Daoist Guang was actually almost done for the day.</p>

    <p>He was doing poorly in this last round.</p>

    <p>After landing, he had only found level one body armor and a knapsack, a katana, and five bandages; there wasn't even a helmet...</p>

    <p>Apart from that, there was nothing else.</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang had always played solo and had never joined fierce combat. He felt that given his position as an entertaining old man, it was better to stay on the sidelines as an "observer." But this also depended on his luck and whether or not there were plenty of items for him to pick up. This time, for instance, he had entered what looked like a pretty big house on the outskirts, but it was actually empty.</p>

    <p>Some people teased him in the bullet messages.</p>

    <p>"It's over, it's over, Lord Island is going to give away a delivery<sup>2</sup> this time."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This refers to players dropping their inventory after being killed.)</dfn>

    <p>"Lord Island's luck is bad, he's going to drop as a box <sup>3</sup> ."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(In PUBG, when a player is killed in the first ten seconds of appearing in the game, they turn into boxes that fall to the ground.)</dfn>

    <p>The most hilarious thing was when Daoist Guang picked up the only weapon, the katana, in the room, and the screen was filled with the same two-word bullet message over and over: <em>Game Over </em>.</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang couldn't help laughing as he glanced at them.</p>

    <p>Of course he knew that they were poking fun at him.</p>

    <p>" <em>Aiya </em>, I'm running out of time..." Daoist Guang couldn't help whispering in his heart as he took a look and realized that he didn't have much time left.</p>

    <p>He had also told the viewers in the live stream room that this would be the last round.</p>

    <p>Could it be... was he really going to go offline in disgrace?</p>

    <p>Hm, of course that was impossible!</p>

    <p>He had been fooling around for almost three hours, and no matter what, he had to put on a show for the viewers in the final round.</p>

    <p>Of course, he couldn't use cheats as live streaming platforms nowadays had built-in anti-cheat systems. Live streamers who used cheat software would be banned straightaway; Daoist Guang had read the rules and was of course aware of this point.</p>

    <p>So there was no using cheats.</p>

    <p>But he felt that he could still use a little bit of magic.</p>

    <p>Katana in hand, he pretended to hide in the house when in fact he was pondering what type of magic he should use.</p>

    <p>In this type of survival game, it was crucial to pinpoint the locations of both friends and foes; this was especially important information for some LYB <sup>4</sup> . But computer games were all about digital data; even if Daoist Guang opened his Heavenly Eye, it wouldn't be able to help him see through things, and even less to sense auras - it was all virtual data, what aura was there for him to sense?</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>4</sup>(An acronym for 老阴通,which refers to players who camp out in a particular position and patiently wait for kills ..)</dfn>

    <p>Furthermore, he only had a katana; unless he could ambush someone inside the house, he would just be a target if he went outside.</p>

    <p>After thinking for a while, Daoist Guang pretended to stretch, and when both his hands were out of the screen's range, he secretly made a hand seal to cast the Focus Spell on himself.</p>

    <p>This was an extremely ordinary minor spell, but could stealthily help to greatly improve his awareness.</p>

    <p>When all was said and done, it wasn't enough to pinpoint everyone else's positions - the most important thing still was your immediate reaction when you ran into them.</p>

    <p>At this thought, Daoist Guang couldn't help laughing in his heart.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if anyone else was using this spell in the game, but his was at the most advanced level; now that he had activated this spell, he was very confident that no one in the game could beat him!</p>

    <p>When all was said and done, Daoist Guang deeply believed that in this world, there was no other True Immortal more bored than he was!</p>

    <p>At that moment in the game, there was the sound of the door opening downstairs, and Daoist Guang instantly heard it with his enhanced awareness.</p>

    <p>Holding the katana, he waited for the intruder to come upstairs to the second floor.</p>

    <p>Before that person could react, they saw a shadow appear before their eyes.</p>

    <p>One hit! Half blood!</p>

    <p>"???"</p>

    <p>The player panicked and instantly raised his gun to shoot wildly at the shadow. However, Daoist Guang's response was too fast as he actually directly leapt behind the player and with a second strike, took his life.</p>

    <p>The screen was filled with exclamations of surprise.</p>

    <p>"What the fuck?! What is this?!"</p>

    <p>"Ha? Is a katana that lethal?"</p>

    <p>"Cheat! Lord Island definitely cheated!"</p>

    <p>"Cheat +1!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Everyone stared at the unperturbed Daoist Guang in the live stream as he confidently searched the boxes on the ground.</p>

    <p>This person was rich; he had a level three bag, three First Aid Kits, two drinks and a level two helmet...</p>

    <p>After picking up just these things, he directly left.</p>

    <p>The screen was full of question marks again. "???"</p>

    <p>"Lord Island didn't take the gun???"</p>

    <p>"You forgot the automatic rifle! Lord Island!"</p>

    <p>Holding his katana, Lord Island was extremely confident. "Sorry, I don't need a gun."</p>

    <p>Bullet messages: "???"</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang: "The moment I had this katana, the game was already over!"</p>

    <p>"Come on, Lord Island, you may have killed someone, but that doesn't mean you're very strong!" Someone couldn't help mocking him.</p>

    <p>When he saw that bullet message, Daoist Guang didn't say anything and instead simply activated the quiz function.</p>

    <p>[Active]: <em>Live streamer kills twenty or more people</em></p>

    <p><em>Yes/No</em></p>

    <p>In addition, Daoist Guang directly changed the room's title.</p>

    <p>[Live Streamer "Lord Island" Live Stream Room Title]: <em>Katana in Hand! Game Over! The Whole Game is My Pig Farm - One Hit, One Peppa Pig!</em></p>
