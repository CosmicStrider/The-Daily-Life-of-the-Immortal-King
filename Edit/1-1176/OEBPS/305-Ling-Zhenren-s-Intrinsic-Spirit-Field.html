  <h1>Chapter 305 Ling Zhenren's Intrinsic Spirit Field </h1>

  <div>

    <p>In that instant, Master of Immortal Mansion Cheng Yu finally understood what true despair felt like.</p>

    <p>His eyes had sunken in, making him look decades older, and even his hair had turned gray in a blink of an eye. In one short instant just now, over a thousand spirit swords had terminated their contracts with him at the same time, and his jade palace meridian felt like it was on fire, causing endless agony.</p>

    <p>Cheng Yu now understood a little better what kind of person the other party was. If the familiar which he had accidentally summoned back then had been a supreme cheat bestowed on him by the heavens, then this guy standing in front of him was a genuine renminbi player!</p>

    <p>In that moment, he finally realized that this was a meaningless fight — since the beginning, he had never had the slightest chance of winning!</p>

    <p>"Who on earth... are you?"</p>

    <p>As Cheng Yu coughed up blood from the backlash of the spirit sword contracts being severed, Jingke gave him a meaningful look.</p>

    <p>In that moment, that unchanging expression and those dead fish eyes which had been inherited from Wang Ling seemed particularly eloquent.</p>

    <p>Then, the one thousand spirit swords behind Jingke hummed and glowed as they dazzled the eye like a star-studded Milky Way.</p>

    <p>Jingke saw the master's eyes fill with mortification.</p>

    <p>A grand peak late-stage Itinerant Immortal, head of a large and formidable dark force, had in the end actually been reduced to this.</p>

    <p>Cheng Yu gritted his teeth; he already knew that he had nowhere to hide.</p>

    <p>The backlash from the one thousand spirit swords breaking the contracts hadn't stopped yet. He gritted his teeth and made a hand seal, terminating the intrinsic spirit field at once.</p>

    <p>Cheng Yu had used the familiar back then to seal these spirit swords inside the intrinsic spirit field. Theoretically speaking, once he terminated the field, these spirit swords wouldn't be able to harm him.</p>

    <p>After that, if he used a Dao talisman to flee, at the very least he would survive.</p>

    <p>As for revenge, that would be for another day.</p>

    <p>Anything was possible as long as he stayed alive.</p>

    <p>Each time before a fight, Cheng Yu would have already organized an escape route for himself. But it had never, ever occurred to him that this day would actually come so soon. Before his dream of making the ultimate godly sword had come true, he had been beaten up and subdued in his own intrinsic spirit field... If this got out, he would definitely become the butt of jokes for tens of thousands of years as it was just too hilarious.</p>

    <p>But no matter how people might jeer at him, it was better to live than die.</p>

    <p>And so, Cheng Yu's speed increased significantly as he swiftly made a hand seal, for fear that Jingke would attack him halfway through.</p>

    <p>"Made it!"</p>

    <p>The moment he succeeded, he couldn't help smiling in relief even as he coughed up blood. Everything in the intrinsic spirit field slowly faded away.</p>

    <p>In fact, Jingke had already noticed the moment Cheng Yu had created the seal.</p>

    <p>If he had wanted to, he could have chopped both of Cheng Yu's hands off in a flash.</p>

    <p>But he hadn't done so.</p>

    <p>Because the only task Wang Ling had given him this time was to use his identity as the king of spirit swords and take control of these one thousand spirit swords.</p>

    <p>And now, he had completed his task.</p>

    <p>Jingke was well aware that his Little Master Ling would always do what he said he would do; if Jingke overstepped when he hadn't been asked to do so, Little Master Ling would be mad!</p>

    <p>There would be serious consequences if Ling Zhenren got mad!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In Linglang Pavilion, as Lord Diulei watched the Master of Immortal Mansion terminate the intrinsic spirit field, he immediately had a hunch that the other party would produce some sort of Dao talisman to flee for his life.</p>

    <p>"Should we set up an array?" asked Luo Chuang.</p>

    <p>In this situation, using a magic array to seal off the space and restrict the use of Dao talismans was a good idea. As soon as Dharmaraja noticed that the intrinsic spirit field was being withdrawn, lightning instantly flashed in his hand as he straightaway called forth the godly thunder inheritance to block off all exits in Linglang Pavilion.</p>

    <p>Anyone who wanted to force their way through this blockade would have to endure being electrocuted by the godly thunder inheritance. This might not have worked if Cheng Yu had been at full strength, but given his current injuries, he would definitely be knocked out by electricity if he tried to escape.</p>

    <p>"Whatever the case, there is nowhere for him to run!" Dharmaraja laughed, completely confident in his godly thunder inheritance. Even Pikachu wouldn't be able to escape the godly thunder inheritance when it was at one hundred percent!</p>

    <p>"Don't relax your guard..."</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren somehow had a bad feeling. "This Master of Immortal Mansion has endless tricks up his sleeve, and the holy Ice Crystal Array is still running. It's possible that he has more than just Dao talismans to cover him."</p>

    <p>"I agree." Lord Diulei nodded. "Everyone stay focused; don't let him escape again!"</p>

    <p>At that moment, the silver unicorn let out a sigh. "Unfortunately, I've already discharged my intrinsic spirit field once, otherwise I could trap him in my field after he leaves his, like a matryoshka doll. This is the most reliable method; no matter what tricks he might have, there would be no way for him to escape!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's eyes suddenly lit up when he heard the silver unicorn's suggestion.</p>

    <p>However, everyone was fully concentrated on Cheng Yu, so none of them had noticed Ling Zhenren's slight expression.</p>

    <p>After that, Wang Ling slowly rose to his feet. As spirit light glowed in his hand, everyone saw that Jingke had returned in its form as a peach wood sword.</p>

    <p>Then, Fang Xing appeared as well. Immortal Toya straightaway hurried over to support him as they moved to one side so that Immortal Toya could administer emergency treatment.</p>

    <p>Now, it was just the Master of Immortal Mansion left.</p>

    <p>Everyone held their breaths as they waited for Cheng Yu to appear.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling could already imagine how, the instant Cheng Yu showed up, everyone here would smother him in their auras and use every means possible to prevent him from running.</p>

    <p>The truth was, Wang Ling had already thought of a way to impede this Master of Immortal Mansion.</p>

    <p>When the intrinsic spirit field disappeared, everyone else would be pulled out first, and Cheng Yu as the spirit field's owner would appear a little later.</p>

    <p>But that was already no longer important.</p>

    <p>Because the moment Cheng Yu's figure appeared in Linglang Pavilion, everyone saw that Wang Ling had already taken one step forward, his red and black jacket fluttering in the wind.</p>

    <p>In the next moment, their surroundings had changed again.</p>

    <p>They were in a square, where they saw an old-fashioned stone sculpture and what looked like dozens of palm trees next to it on the verge of dying.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing couldn't be more familiar with this scenery.</p>

    <p>Because this was Number 60 High School...</p>

    <p>"What's going on?!"</p>

    <p>Cheng Yu's face was contorted in terror. He couldn't be more familiar with this feeling — this was an intrinsic spirit field!</p>

    <p>He had just left his own intrinsic spirit field and had already taken out the Dao talisman; in the end, he had been immediately sucked into another spirit field!</p>

    <p>The silver unicorn was dumbstruck. It could feel from the magnetic field that this was a brand new intrinsic spirit field, with the purest kind of spirit energy source.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei couldn't help the way the corners of his mouth twitched as he stared at Wang Ling. "Brother Ling... is this your intrinsic spirit field?"</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling nodded his head.</p>

    <p>As a result, they were all taken by surprise. "What?! When did Ling Zhenren learn to set up his own intrinsic spirit field?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling remained silent at this question and was unable to answer for fear of shaking everyone's confidence in their own cultivation paths.</p>

    <p>Because he had just learned this intrinsic spirit field...</p>

    <p>A minute ago...</p>

    <p>This could be seen from the setting.</p>

    <p>He hadn't given it much thought, and had directly modelled it after Number 60 High School...</p>
