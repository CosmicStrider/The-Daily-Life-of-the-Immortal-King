  <h1>Chapter 725 A Perverted Mage's Dream</h1>

  <div>

    <p>There was a dismayed expression on Bloody Butterfly's face. In her camouflaged state, she didn't dare move at all, but the Old Devil was already slowly moving in her direction.</p>

    <p>"Don't tell me he actually noticed me?" Bloody Butterfly's face was so tense that she was sweating like a waterfall.</p>

    <p>When the Old Devil was less than three <em>zhang </em>from her position, Bloody Butterfly's feet shook and she immediately dropped her camouflage and swiftly put some distance between her and the Old Devil.</p>

    <p>"There you are." The Old Devil looked slowly at Bloody Butterfly.</p>

    <p>Her twin ponytails trembled with anger. "You..."</p>

    <p>She realized that she had probably been tricked. This guy in fact hadn't discovered her just now!</p>

    <p>"My venerable self only knew your general position, but didn't expect you to be so close. Who would have thought I would really force you to come out." The Old Devil chuckled.</p>

    <p>Bloody Butterfly: "..."</p>

    <p>Sure enough! Those who played tricks were dirty!</p>

    <p>"But now it won't be so easy for you to try and escape me." The Old Devil pointed at Bloody Butterfly's feet.</p>

    <p>"Huh?"</p>

    <p>A puzzled expression on her face, Bloody Butterfly looked down, and her face turned pale.</p>

    <p>When had this devil marked her with a tracker?!</p>

    <p>Was it in the moment she had betrayed herself?</p>

    <p>This reaction was too terrifying...</p>

    <p>Facing this devil who had once shocked the nation, Bloody Butterfly started to feel increasingly nervous.</p>

    <p>Generally speaking, the Old Devil felt that this Bloody Butterfly was a pretty good opponent and at the very least was on par with the strength of his current body. He was still adapting to this imitation body, and he didn't yet have full coordination while in it - it was far worse than the original body which he had had before entering the Stone Ghost Mask.</p>

    <p>Fighting was always the fastest way to quickly adapt to a body. Ordinarily, stuck as he was in prison, the most he could do was beat up Evil Sword God.</p>

    <p>Helping the government clean up these foreign terrorists and apprehending members of the Dark Network thus wasn't just a path of atonement, but also a rare opportunity to fight.</p>

    <p>The Old Devil estimated that this Bloody Butterfly's strength was at the ninth level of the peak Soul Foundation stage, which was only half a step away from the Itinerant Immortal realm.</p>

    <p>While the Old Devil was currently in an imitation body which wasn't at its peak, he had the strength of an Itinerant Immortal. While he had a higher realm than Bloody Butterfly, his coordination inside this body was certainly piss poor.</p>

    <p>Hence, the instant he faced off against Bloody Butterfly, the Old Devil had already come up with a plan.</p>

    <p>In this battle, the best would be if he could avoid physical contact.</p>

    <p>The daily life of a Dark Network most wanted criminal like Bloody Butterfly was filled with knives and blood. Close-range combat was like breathing for this sort of person. Until he fully adapted to his body, the Old Devil would suffer greatly in a drawn-out close-range fight.</p>

    <p>Besides, he was a mage to begin with.</p>

    <p>He wasn't used to magic weapons like knives and swords...</p>

    <p>Then here was the question: What kind of spell should he use to deal with this Bloody Butterfly?</p>

    <p>The Old Devil was stuck.</p>

    <p>The Chaos Ball was the technique he was renowned for, but the Old Devil didn't think that this petty Dark Network wanted criminal Bloody Butterfly deserved to have it used on her.</p>

    <p>The Old Devil felt that if he directly used the Chaos Ball, then the game would be no fun.</p>

    <p>He could wipe out ten of her with the Chaos Ball!</p>

    <p>As he pondered this, a wind was kicked up ahead of him as Bloody Butterfly attacked.</p>

    <p>The best defense was offense!</p>

    <p>Soaked in cold sweat, this was the decision Bloody Butterfly ultimately made.</p>

    <p>A slender black shadow darted out from under a tree and swiftly spiraled toward the Old Devil's back like an agile tentacle!</p>

    <p>"Twin Ponytails Thrust!"</p>

    <p>This black shadow was none other than Bloody Butterfly's twin ponytails!</p>

    <p>She had refined her twin ponytails into a killing weapon and as another magic treasure for survival!</p>

    <p>This was a surprise attack, but she failed. The instant the shadow attacked, the Old Devil had already made a quick decision based on his rich experience.</p>

    <p>A light shield swiftly coalesced around him in a spiral, keeping him safe like he was in an egg and perfectly fending off the shadow's surprise attack.</p>

    <p>Intangible Magic Shield!</p>

    <p>This was a level five spell!</p>

    <p>It could block magic-based attacks!</p>

    <p>Bloody Butterfly clenched her teeth. From this spell alone, she could already tell how difficult it was going to be to deal with this devil.</p>

    <p>The scariest thing was that the Old Devil had cast this level five spell in a flash!</p>

    <p>Without any hand seals!</p>

    <p>A spell without the use of hand seals... This was proof that the Old Devil had already reached the height of proficiency with this spell!</p>

    <p>This was undoubtedly a fearful opponent, but Bloody Butterfly didn't give up attacking.</p>

    <p>The ambush by the shadow just now had just been a feint!</p>

    <p>The real attack...</p>

    <p>Was behind!</p>

    <p><em>Chi!</em></p>

    <p>At that moment, a blood-red dagger stabbed at the Old Devil's back!</p>

    <p>The dagger in hand, Bloody Butterfly smiled cruelly — she had him!</p>

    <p>This Blood Blade in her hand was an extremely powerful magic weapon, specially designed for assassination and which caused real damage — both shield and armor were useless against this dagger!</p>

    <p>"A body double?" The Old Devil's face was unruffled.</p>

    <p>It had to be said that Bloody Butterfly's plan seemed to be proceeding smoothly so far, and could certainly give people a real sense of being overwhelmed. In such a short moment, she had created a body double to launch a feint, allowing her true self to sneak behind the Old Devil in camouflage to stab his back with the Blood Blade.</p>

    <p>This series of actions could be said to be so smooth and natural that if it had been anyone else, they would have fallen for it.</p>

    <p>But Bloody Butterfly underestimated the opponent in front of her.</p>

    <p>The next moment, the smile on her face froze.</p>

    <p>The moment she thrust the Blood Blade at the Old Devil's back, Bloody Butterfly felt her scalp tighten - he had grabbed hold of her twin ponytails!</p>

    <p>"Fuck... ow ow ow ow ow!"</p>

    <p>This pain was like from a boy sitting behind her in junior high and pulling on her hair, and Bloody Butterfly's scalp instantly turned numb!</p>

    <p>She felt herself being completely dragged away!</p>

    <p>The Old Devil hadn't cast any spells; he had simply grabbed her twin ponytails and the whole situation had immediately been turned on its head.</p>

    <p>"Your hair's quite smooth, but nothing like my wife's." Twin ponytails in hand, the Old Devil sighed with sorrow.</p>

    <p>General Yi had promised him previously that he would help him find the reincarnation of his wife with the Wheel of Time, but until now there still hadn't been any news. Now, these two soft ponytails unexpectedly made the Old Devil think of her.</p>

    <p>"You... let me go!"</p>

    <p>With her pigtails caught, Bloody Butterfly couldn't put up the least bit resistance. "This is a foul! Aren't you a mage?! How can you resort to something so uncouth?!"</p>

    <p>This move by the Old Devil was completely outside of Bloody Butterfly's expectations.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, did every mage dream of close-range combat?</p>

    <p>Holding Bloody Butterfly's twin ponytails, the Old Devil cast a depletion magic ring around her, and Bloody Butterfly's entire body jolted as she instantly lost her strength.</p>

    <p>Affected by the depletion magic ring, Bloody Butterfly's voice was weak. "Wh... What are you going to do..."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, my venerable self isn't going to do anything. It's just that your twin ponytails suddenly made me think of my wife." The Old Devil stared at Bloody Butterfly lying limp on the ground, and his smile gradually turned mean. "My venerable self has decided, I'm going to cut off your twin ponytails."</p>

    <p>Bloody Butterfly: "Are... are you a pervert..."</p>

    <p>The Old Devil shook his head and sighed. "Even if I am a pervert, I am simply a gentleman burdened with that title..."</p>

    <p>Bloody Butterfly: "No... noooo! Don't come near me..."</p>
