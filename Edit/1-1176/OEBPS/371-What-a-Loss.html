  <h1>Chapter 371 What a Loss... </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Er Ha hadn't been able to adapt to its new body at the beginning, and more than that, it had deeply dreaded the modern human cultivator urban lifestyle. Later on, however, it had found it to be quite enjoyable after it had integrated into the times and gotten used to the rhythm of human life.</p>

    <p>At the very least, it didn't have to work day and night for the lives of millions of toads in the toad nation; for Er Ha, this could be summarized in six words: the death of its toad nature.</p>

    <p>Toads were naturally fond of sleeping, but after becoming the demon king of the nation, Er Ha would spend almost its entire day in service to its people, and still had to think of ways to get along well with neighboring demon clans. It would be on edge even when playing mahjong, afraid that one wrong word could spark a war. By Wang Ling's side, however, Er Ha didn't feel as tired, and furthermore, had found a sense of belonging.</p>

    <p>It might be a bit irresponsible to think that way... but Er Ha felt that it couldn't be blamed for it. It had already been in the human world for six years, and during that time, it had never once sensed the aura of any other member of the toad clan; there weren't even any who had come to the human world to look for it.</p>

    <p>All the toads probably thought that it was already dead...</p>

    <p>Six years had passed. It was a long enough time for the toad clan to get back into the swing of things and elect a new king by referendum. Perhaps the newly elected king of toads had already assertively led the toad clan into an era of peace and prosperity on the other side of the Gate Between Worlds.</p>

    <p>As the old ruler, no matter how much it cared for its people, it would probably just be snubbed if it returned to the toad clan.</p>

    <p>As its mind wandered, Er Ha fell asleep with its head pillowed on Wang Ling's thigh. As it was drifting off, it was still thinking that it was probably the only one on this earth to receive this sort of treatment.</p>

    <p>It was a toad's nature to be fond of sleeping. In addition, cultivating the "Demon King Heart Sutra" consumed a lot of vitality, so Er Ha became tired and weary more easily compared with other spirit beasts with the same realms.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling rubbed Er Ha's ear between two fingers. After confirming that it was completely asleep, he used spirit energy to directly move Er Ha to the side of the bed.</p>

    <p>Immediately after that, he sent Lord Diulei a text message asking about the condition of that "foolish" girl Yaxuan whom they had arranged to stay with Cailian Zhenren, as well as the current situation with the silver unicorn.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had initially intended to ask Cailian Zhenren directly, but after careful consideration, he thought that doing so would easily cause misunderstandings. Wang Ling wouldn't hook up with girls, nor would he actively try to do so. Hence, when it came to relationship matters, he had always maintained an aloof distance.</p>

    <p>While modern education didn't pay too much attention to puppy love, and Father Wang and Mother Wang were actually pretty open-minded about it, Wang Ling was in the end Wang Ling, and had his own thoughts on the matter.</p>

    <p>Em... sixteen should be the age when one focused on studying.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei replied almost instantly. "Miss Yaxuan is now Cailian Zhenren's helper; she's quite diligent, though a little clumsy. The silver unicorn is at my villa for now. Does Brother Ling need it for something?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling replied with godly speed on his watch, and swiftly sent back the message: "Mm, ask it to give me some blood."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>After thinking for a while, Wang Ling felt that asking for this out of the blue was a little brazen and not very appropriate.</p>

    <p>Hence, he sent another message: "Five packets of crispy noodle snacks."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was undaunted. "Ten packets?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Standing next to Lord Diulei, the silver unicorn had taken the form of a young man with long silver hair and was wearing a white shirt and jeans. These were Lord Diulei's clothes, and were unexpectedly a decent fit.</p>

    <p>When it saw Wang Ling's offer, it almost puked blood on Lord Diulei's phone screen: ten packets of crispy noodle snacks in exchange for the blood of a holy beast... Why don't you just go and rob someone?!</p>

    <p>The silver unicorn couldn't stand it and directly snatched the phone from Lord Diulei. "Big brother... if you're going to make an offer, you can't make one like this; the blood of a holy beast is priceless. You'll just be spoiling the market otherwise... you can't even buy chicken blood with this."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling took a deep breath. "Twenty packets."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>After reading this message, the silver unicorn and Lord Diulei were silent for two to three minutes.</p>

    <p>A moment later, Lord Diulei picked up his tea to drink a mouthful and calm himself down.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ling sent yet another text: "I can't offer more than this, otherwise it'll be a loss for me."</p>

    <p>The silver unicorn: "???"</p>

    <p>Pu!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei directly sprayed the tea he had yet to swallow.</p>

    <p>The silver unicorn was already stupefied... What kind of person was this? Using immortal gold would have been well and good, but this was the first time that it heard of "crispy noodle snacks" used as a trade currency.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei smiled bitterly and patted the silver unicorn on the shoulder. "Just sell it to him. A favor from Brother Ling is far more meaningful than crispy noodle snacks. Besides... isn't he your master?"</p>

    <p>The silver unicorn: "..." The problem was that it had never met such a stingy master before!</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling had saved Yaxuan's life with the Great Purification Spell at Immortal Mansion previously, so in some sense, the silver unicorn was still truly indebted to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He just wanted a bit of holy beast blood; the silver unicorn could consider it a blood donation... What was more, it had the heart of a holy beast, so its qi and blood recovered at a much faster rate compared with ordinary spirit beasts. If it was five hundred milliliters of holy beast blood, the silver unicorn could recover immediately.</p>

    <p>So it thought.</p>

    <p>After a good long while, the silver unicorn finally wrote and sent a text message on Lord Diulei's phone: "How much do you want?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling answered almost to the second. "A ton."</p>

    <p>The silver unicorn: "???"</p>

    <p>After sending the text, Wang Ling felt that his request was a little too much, so he followed it up with another: "You can give me one thousand milliliters first, and then a bit each day after that until we reach one ton."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>The silver unicorn looked at the content of the message, its eyes full of bitter complaints.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei looked at the silver unicorn. "You should be able to recover quickly, right?"</p>

    <p>The silver unicorn: "This is animal cruelty..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Strictly speaking, holy beasts are extinct, so you're not protected by the state."</p>

    <p>The silver unicorn opened its mouth, but was unable to say anything...</p>

    <p>I've been shanghaied into joining the bad guys, haven't I?</p>

    <p>While it was already feeling utterly disheartened, Wang Ling's next text message gave it the final K.O..</p>

    <p>The text wasn't long, and only contained nine words...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The first six words: Remember to include the delivery fee.</p>

    <p>The last three words: Cash on delivery...</p>
