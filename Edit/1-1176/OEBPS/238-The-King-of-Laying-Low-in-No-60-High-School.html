  <h1>Chapter 238 The King of Laying Low in Number 60 High School </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was June 16th on Thursday in the eighth week of school.</p>

    <p>The survival contest portion of the week-long combined military training exercise for the six schools finally came to an end with the final contraction of the toxic fog circle.</p>

    <p>The ending was a little surprising because until then, before the last contraction of the toxic fog circle, there had still been over four thousand students crammed together and struggling hard to "lay low."</p>

    <p>In the end, most people had been poisoned to death by the last wave of the toxic fog.</p>

    <p>It was a fine, sunny day.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi, Director of the General Administration of 100 Schools, announced the final result on the command platform in the big square of the military training base on the western outskirts of Songhai city. "The final number of people left in the survival contest: one. Student Guo Hao of Number 60 High School, who was in the toilet at the time, is the final winner..."</p>

    <p>Then, Zhuo Yi and Immortal Toya next to him both clapped. Unfortunately, this ending was just so scary that the ten thousand students, six headmasters, and Secretary Dakang were all overwhelmed in that instant, creating an awkward silence.</p>

    <p>For some reason, the headmasters of Number 59 High School and Number 60 High School couldn't be happy at all despite their victory.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao, the man of the hour, had been forced to withdraw from the military training and had been sent directly to the hospital's emergency ward after leaving the small world because of abdominal pains.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi felt a little embarrassed. He cleared his throat and said into the microphone, "Next, because Student Guo Hao is unable to be present, let's welcome the teacher-in-charge of Grade One, Class Three, Pan Shengcong, to accept the medal and trophy."</p>

    <p>Of everyone present, Teacher Pan was the only one smiling like a sunflower.</p>

    <p>Under everyone's gazes, this middle-aged woman with a ponytail, who was a teaching pioneer at Number 60 High School, quickly jumped onto the platform and cheerfully took the trophy. She was happier than some actresses winning the Queen of Movies at the Golden Rooster Awards <sup>1</sup> . "Thank you! Thank you for your support and encouragement! This trophy and this silk banner belong to our Number 59 High School and Number 60 High School!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The Golden Rooster Awards are China's film awards..)</dfn>

    <p>Maybe it was because Teacher Pan was so happy, but finally there was some applause at this moment.</p>

    <p>Taking advantage of this enthusiasm, Zhuo Yi continued, "Now, we'll invite Teacher Pan to unroll the banner, which was personally inscribed by Secretary Dakang from the Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools."</p>

    <p>"Okay!"</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan nodded and slowly unfurled the silk banner. It was as if the glaring gold letters on the banner were shining brightly, hitting everyone with understanding.</p>

    <p>Secretary Dakang had written these words using his great power, and the moment the silk banner was unfurled, there was a spirit light so blinding that it forced people to close their eyes.</p>

    <p>Standing in the crowd, Wang Ling's Heavenly Eye wasn't affected by the glare of the golden light. His gaze penetrated the brightness, and instantly he saw the big words printed on the silk banner: Lay Low...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The military training wasn't over; the next few days consisted of general basic training, including military postures like standing at attention and at ease... there was no escaping any of it.</p>

    <p>During this time, Guo Hao became a well-known figure among the six schools. Winning the contest by relying on the god-blessed circle showed how explosive his luck was. Most importantly, through this joint military training exercise for the six schools, he had drawn attention from all levels of society, and it could be said that his academic path in the future would be paved with gold.</p>

    <p>According to news which Wang Ling had heard, many universities had already extended an olive branch to Guo Hao's family. In the eyes of many university chancellors, prowess and talent were important on the road to cultivation, but luck was also a strength.</p>

    <p>That evening after Wang Ling had come back from the military training's session for the day, he saw a message on the Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools' official media account.</p>

    <p>Secretary Dakang wanted to put an inscription on the trophy for Guo Hao, but didn't know what to write, so he had used the public platform to ask for everyone's opinions.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling scrolled down the screen and saw a lot of selected replies in the messages.</p>

    <p>Among them, there were chuunibyou suggestions such as The Chosen One and Dopey Nicholas.</p>

    <p>There were also funny and mocking ones like King of the Squat Toilet, The Strongest Squat Toilet King, Mother Juan's Victim...</p>

    <p>And the most popular message was the one which Chen Chao had written: Number 60 High School's King of Laying Low.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw that there were more than eight thousand likes for this message...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>During the period that Wang Ling was away from home, it was also lively at the Wang family's small villa.</p>

    <p>On the morning that the outcome of the survival contest was announced, a black limousine stopped at the entrance of the Wang family's small villa. A man with high slicked-back hair and wearing goggles got out of the car at the entrance, carrying a briefcase.</p>

    <p>"This is where Senior Ling lives..." Dharmaraja stood at the front door of the villa feeling a little excited. After Lord Diulei and Immortal Toya, he was the third person in the whole chat group to visit the Wang family home.</p>

    <p>Before he had come to the villa, Lord Diulei had implored him repeatedly to go with reverence in his heart for the seniors.</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja stood at the door and rang the bell.</p>

    <p>Soon he heard the faint sound of footsteps inside, and it was Grandfather Wang who opened the door. "Who is it?"</p>

    <p>When Grandfather Wang opened the door, Dharmaraja's expression straightaway faltered. He had heard from Lord Diulei that there were three seniors in the villa in addition to Ling Zhenren! Among them, the one with the most unfathomable strength was an old man...</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja never thought that he would straightaway see this great senior on his first visit.</p>

    <p>Since it was their first meeting, Dharmaraja immediately bowed at a ninety-degree angle. "Hello, Old Senior Wang! Ling Zhenren entrusted a spirit sword to me for repairs, and this junior has specially come to deliver it to him."</p>

    <p>"Oh, thank you for taking the trouble, why don't you come in first. You can change your slippers at the entrance, and remember to close the door behind you."</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja took the tea from the old man nervously. "So Senior Ling's father is a writer?"</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>The old man nodded. "His pen name is Wang Situ."</p>

    <p>Holy shit! Wang Situ?</p>

    <p>Lightning Dharmaraja was stunned. He remembered reading this great god's writing on the subway to work! He had never expected that this person would be Senior Ling's father!</p>

    <p>"At first he just started writing for fun, and we never thought he could make money from it." Grandfather Wang smiled.</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Dharmaraja's reverence for Father Wang grew even greater. To just write for fun but still be able to make money... this was indeed a great senior hiding behind the scenes! Sure enough, he was talented in every aspect! Furthermore, Dharmaraja seemed to remember listening to an interview which had been recorded with Father Wang. He wasn't just a genius, he also spoke well! Dharmaraja really liked him!</p>
