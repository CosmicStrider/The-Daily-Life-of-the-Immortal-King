  <h1>Chapter 995 Zhuo Yi Calls For Help</h1>

  <div>

    <p>On the other side, Zhuo Yi had successfully activated the barrier and immediately rushed in the direction of the Wang family's small villa. Everyone was in the dark and had no idea at all about what was happening. The whole of the Office of Strategic Deception was in a mess, and he had to find out exactly what was going on.</p>

    <p>After activating the barrier blockade, Zhuo Yi sorted out his thoughts properly. He couldn't help out in the fight if he stayed; instead, he could be a distraction if everyone had to protect him. Hence, Zhuo Yi's first reaction was to look for his <em>shifu</em> at the Wang family's small villa.</p>

    <p>As Wang Ling's first disciple, this was his prerogative!</p>

    <p>When necessary, he could ask those gremlins in the Wang family's small villa that had been enlightened by his <em>shifu</em> for help!</p>

    <p>Thus, he could still look for backup at the small villa even if he couldn't find his <em>shifu</em>.</p>

    <p>Things had happened too suddenly this time, catching everyone off guard.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi flew to the entrance of the Wang family's small villa and noticed that Er Ha was also missing, which made him curse even more in his heart.</p>

    <p>"Uncle, aunt, are you home?" Zhuo Yi knocked on the door of the villa, but there was no reply.</p>

    <p>Father Wang, Mother Wang and Grandfather Wang had all disappeared!</p>

    <p>"Crap, something really happened!" Zhuo Yi felt that the situation didn't look good. He straightaway took out a pen from his chest pocket. With a press of his finger, it instantly transformed into a dazzling and cool bluish-gray spirit sword!</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi didn't know what the situation was inside the villa, but he was already on guard.</p>

    <p>He knocked on the door and said the password: "Crispy noodle snacks are number one!"</p>

    <p><em>Kacha!</em></p>

    <p>There was the sound of the front door unlocking, and it slowly opened...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had enlightened this door a long time ago, and this version 1.0 enlightened gremlin's capabilities weren't as strong as Wang Ling's newly enlightened bedroom door. The latest enlightenment technique was version 3.0, and Book of Sage Immortal and the bedroom door were the beneficiaries of this version.</p>

    <p>Lord Ma was a version 2.0, but he was very strong. As a version 2.0 gremlin that frequently received Wang Ling's trust, Lord Ma was just as powerful as the 3.0s.</p>

    <p>The small villa was extremely quiet, and there was something strange about this silence.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi swallowed before slowly moving forward step by step and finally making his way up to the second floor with his sword in hand.</p>

    <p>There were no signs of intrusion, let alone a fight, but the fact was that Father Wang, Mother Wang and Grandfather Wang were all missing, which Zhuo Yi felt was very strange.</p>

    <p>What on earth happened?</p>

    <p>"Try <em>shifu</em>'s bedroom and take a look around." Zhuo Yi took a deep breath and went to Wang Ling's bedroom.</p>

    <p>With one glance, he saw Book of Sage Immortal on the table.</p>

    <p>Given its omniscience, it might know something.</p>

    <p>"Book of Sage Immortal! What on earth is going on?" asked Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>"Master has gone to the Palace of Mirrors and has lost contact with this world," answered Book of Sage Immortal. It was connected to Wang Ling's soul, so naturally it knew what was going on, and it related everything it knew in detail.</p>

    <p>"How could this happen all of a sudden... Student Fang Xing was captured, and it turns out <em>shifu</em> went to rescue him. Since you knew this, why didn't you tell us?" Zhuo Yi rebuked the book.</p>

    <p>"As a gremlin enlightened by Master, I can't take even half a step out of the bedroom, nor use my strength to change anything, without an order from Master or an authorized person," Book of Sage Immortal said helplessly.</p>

    <p>"Fine." Zhuo Yi sighed. "Even if that's the case, where are Father Wang, Mother Wang and Grandfather Wang?"</p>

    <p>"They took Grandfather Wang back to his hometown."</p>

    <p>"Why so suddenly..." Zhuo Yi was blank, and then made a shocked sound. "But their son has suddenly disappeared! Don't tell me they're not worried?"</p>

    <p>"Before Mr Wang and Lady Wang left, I did remind them, but Mr Wang didn't seem to care..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi covered his face and laughed bitterly.</p>

    <p>For them to have such a reaction, it looked like Wang Ling was indeed their biological son.</p>

    <p>"Then, Book Sage, you should know that the Office of Strategic Deception is under attack by fakes impersonating <em>shifu</em> and Student Fang Xing," said Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>"I am naturally aware," answered Book of Sage Immortal. "Without reinforcements, your chances of winning are 1%."</p>

    <p>1%...</p>

    <p>It was at that moment that Zhuo Yi suddenly understood the meaning of Lord Diulei's hand gesture earlier.</p>

    <p>He had actually been referring to their chances of success!</p>

    <p>What a bizarre misunderstanding...</p>

    <p>"Then, Book Sage, as an authorized person, I now order you to use all your strength to dispose of those two imposters! And try to find out what their objective is!" Zhuo Yi spoke at that moment.</p>

    <p>When he displayed his palm, the character "Ling" glowed brightly in the center.</p>

    <p>Having received the order, Book of Sage Immortal could at last act. "Understood. I have now sent the first wave of reinforcements to the frontline."</p>

    <p>"The first wave of reinforcements? Aren't all of you going to take action?" Zhuo Yi was curious.</p>

    <p>"As gremlins enlightened by Master, the main thing is still to remain low-key. We won't leave the villa unless we have no other choice. I've already notified the reinforcements, however, so our chances of winning this battle now has already significantly increased," answered Book of Sage Immortal. "In the end, fakes are fakes - there's no way they can match the real Master."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, not long after Book of Sage Immortal had passed down the information.</p>

    <p>A space tunnel opened outside the Office of Strategic Deception's massive dome-shaped barrier.</p>

    <p>"It looks very lively down there."</p>

    <p>The person who had come was none other than Wang Zhen.</p>

    <p>As a result of offending Wang Ling previously, the Heavenly Dao had blacklisted him. After some time had passed, he had now recovered some of his strength. He crossed his arms as he hovered in the sky. Next to him, Liu Qingyi frowned. "Sure enough, there's a very strange air about these two imposters - it's a type of power I haven't seen before."</p>

    <p>"To help out, we'll have to enter the barrier," Wang Zhen said as he looked at the huge dome-shaped barrier beneath them. It was a terrifying scene, just like the end of the world.</p>

    <p>Thick, black clouds had gathered outside this enormous barrier, which covered the size of a football field. Thunder rumbled and the surrounding space was constantly torn apart; even the ground had collapsed, and showed no signs of settling.</p>

    <p>Outside the barrier, the disciples of the Office of Strategic Deception were panic-stricken and had utterly no idea what to do.</p>

    <p>"This barrier was set up by Ling Zhenren and it's impenetrable. We won't be able to get in using regular means. The only thing we can do is to be drawn naturally into the space, and then use the flow of energy around the barrier like a whirlpool to send us inside," said Liu Qingyi. "But this means that someone has to open a path."</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen: "You're saying..."</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi: "My power hasn't been restricted, so I'm the main fighting force, and I have to conserve my strength. So, it's up to you to open the path. Since your parents beat you growing up, it's absolutely not a problem for your physique."</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen: "You..."</p>

    <p>"There's no time to think about it. It's you, Wang Zhen!" As soon as she said that, Liu Qingyi kicked Wang Zhen downward and followed behind him.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen was drawn right into the energy flow at the front, and the pain was torturous.</p>

    <p>It hurt far more than being beaten by his mother!!!</p>
