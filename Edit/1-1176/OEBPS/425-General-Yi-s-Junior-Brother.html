  <h1>Chapter 425 General Yi's Junior Brother </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling thought that burning a recording booth would be a bit excessive... besides, the kind of recording booth that had solid soundproofing in fact cost a lot of money. Of course, money might not be an issue for Lord Diulei at all, but going so far as to burn a recording booth would definitely be a magnificent spectacle.</p>

    <p>If they had to blame someone, it was Taoist Guang, since his typing speed was really too slow. Additionally, typing was something that took a while to improve; the only way was to become familiar with the position of the keys on the keyboard and practice typing as much as possible. Generally, people who were good at typing could basically do it without looking at the keyboard.</p>

    <p>"Is there any other way?" Lord Diulei asked in the group.</p>

    <p>Slow typing was a real weakness, and in the absence of voice function, an average of typing one word a minute was too tiring!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at the screen as he pondered. He had wondered earlier whether he should enchant a keyboard to send to Taoist Guang... Taoist Guang would only need to dictate what he wanted to type, and the keyboard would move by itself, even without him using the notebook's voice function.</p>

    <p>Three minutes later, Taoist Guang replied, "Yes... wait..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Lord Diulei waited in silence with no idea what kind of method Taoist Guang was going to try out.</p>

    <p>After about ten minutes, Taoist Guang finally replied, "Everyone, I'm ready!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei didn't know if he was mistaken, but he felt that Taoist Guang's typing had sped up quite a bit.</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang swiftly typed, "This old man is able to communicate normally now; Senior Ling and friend Thunder, please rest assured."</p>

    <p>Both Wang Ling and Lord Diulei were very surprised.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "How did you do it, Senior Taoist Guang?"</p>

    <p>"It's something I just came up with..." Taoist Guang replied. "My main spells are water-based. I don't want to brag, but my water spells have reached the peak of perfection."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded in front of the screen. This indeed wasn't a boast; creating such an island space and integrating his soul into the space was indeed something no ordinary person could have done. Moreover, it was very obvious that Taoist Guang had carefully designed this island space. The island was surrounded by the sea not just for the aesthetics, but also as a means of nourishing and stabilizing his soul.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, to fix up such an island space, Taoist Guang's water spells had to at least be at peak grade eight, and Wang Ling surmised that it was extremely likely that he could cast ninth-grade water spells.</p>

    <p>Although the main spells used by the majority of True Immortals were grade eight, it wasn't impossible for them to cast ninth-grade supreme spells.</p>

    <p>Of course, given Taoist Guang's current situation as a soul, it would be very hard for him to cast eighth-grade spells. If he had been at peak strength, then it might have been possible.</p>

    <p>Since they had come to this point, Taoist Guang was disinclined to keep them guessing and instead disclosed the reason to them. "Just now, I used a sixth-grade water spell, the 'aquatic beast form technique,' in the space."</p>

    <p>Aquatic beast form technique?</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei had the vague feeling that he had heard of this spell before. "May I ask, senior, is this a spell for turning yourself into an ocean spirit beast?"</p>

    <p>"That's right." On the other side, Taoist Guang nodded and quickly typed, "But I seldom use it because the beast form is very ugly... I turned myself into a deep-sea spirit octopus earlier, and now I have almost a hundred tentacles to hit the keyboard with."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Also, there's another huge flaw. After using this spell, I can type a lot faster, but the keyboard will get sticky. Do you have anything to clean it with? Burn some for me..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei couldn't help laughing. "Senior, you can just wash it with water directly; this notebook model for the elderly which I bought is completely waterproof."</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang nodded. "Oh, good! Then that's fine!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "So, can we start now?"</p>

    <p>"Of course, this old man already promised you," Taoist Guang replied with a laugh. "Then, let's start talking about the Immortal's Treasure House."</p>

    <p>Staring at the screen, Wang Ling schooled his expression into something a little more serious.</p>

    <p>"In fact, how I discovered the entrance to the Immortal's Treasure House is actually related to the Gate Between Worlds. The Gate Between Worlds is a world-defying magic weapon which was created by Immortal Zhenyuan, and after undergoing modifications twenty times, it goes without saying how tough it is. When news of the Immortal's Treasure House got out, countless cultivators searched for it all over the world, but back then and now, they found nothing.</p>

    <p>"I also checked online a little earlier, and up to now, even in an advanced age which combines cultivation with science and technology, no one has been able to find the whereabouts of the Treasure House yet, let alone Immortal Zhenyuan's shadow... At that time, I was reflecting on whether Immortal Zhenyuan might have hidden the Immortal's Treasure House in the Gate Between Worlds."</p>

    <p>When Taoist Guang said this, both Wang Ling and Lord Diulei were instantly riveted.</p>

    <p>What Taoist Guang posited in fact wasn't impossible.</p>

    <p>Because theoretically, the Immortal's Treasure House created by Immortal Zhenyuan was a great world that contained all the riches of his life, and such a great world would usually need to rely on world-defying magic treasures for support. To use an example, it was a bit like another magic treasure which Immortal Zhenyuan had invented, the Purple Gold Gourd.</p>

    <p>The difference was that the Purple Gold Gourd was just a holy weapon, and the world inside it was also small.</p>

    <p>Only divine magic treasures and world-defying magic treasures could accommodate a great world.</p>

    <p>So here was the problem: from the beginning, the Purple Gold Gourd had been invented for its small world; it was originally a space storage magic treasure!</p>

    <p>But the Gate Between Worlds invented by Immortal Zhenyuan obviously had a different function. Its role was to act more like a link to connect the human world to the demon world.</p>

    <p>If you had to classify them, you could only put them in the category of magic weapons with space transfer systems, but one of them was for storage and the other was for transmission; they were too different!</p>

    <p>It wasn't just Wang Ling who considered this issue; after Lord Diulei thought the same thing, he immediately made some conclusions and sorted out his thoughts before raising his doubts.</p>

    <p>"In fact, this old man had also considered this issue back then. So after that, I spent a very long time traveling around the Gate Between Worlds as I wondered if Immortal Zhenyuan might have set up this great world, the Immortal's Treasure House, as a secret territory in some corner of the demon world."</p>

    <p>As he typed, Taoist Guang recalled the past in his mind. "Unfortunately, however, as I trudged through the demon world, I didn't find any clues to the Immortal's Treasure House... until I met someone just as I was about to depart from the Gate Between Worlds."</p>

    <p>"Who was it?" Lord Diulei asked.</p>

    <p>"You may not know this man, but you would definitely be familiar with his senior brother," Taoist Guang typed. "His senior brother is one of the Ten Founding Generals of Huaxiu nation, General Yi."</p>

    <p>"General Yi has a junior brother?"</p>

    <p>"Mm."</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang nodded. "In today's cultivation world, this person is known as 'Ten-Meter Sword God,' the Evil Sword God, Chen Nanxuan."</p>
