  <h1>Chapter 332 There Is a Traitor In Our Midst </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Er Ha directed the baldie to follow after Wang Ling. Everyone who came to the Wang family's small villa for the first time would be a little reserved, and Killer Taoist was no exception. This was because all of them had almost the same thought: that the old man in this villa was a warrior at the level of a living fossil who had withdrawn from the world. Whenever anyone considered this, they were overwhelmed with strong reverence in their hearts.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling reached the villa and opened the front door, he suddenly heard Er Ha ask the baldie an interesting question behind him.</p>

    <p>Er Ha looked at the bald man. "How did you find this place?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling also felt that it was strange; because of the Great Shielding Spell, he had never worried that outsiders would be able to find any information on the Wang family's small villa. Generally, people didn't know that the legendary "Ling Zhenren" actually lived here; not even a legendary killer like Killer Taoist, with his formidable intelligence network, could have known. Hence, after excluding the possibility of an external crime, Wang Ling's first reaction was that he had been betrayed by one of his friends!</p>

    <p>The baldie said: "I bought this information on the cultivation forum; it cost me eight thousand gold bars."</p>

    <p>The corners of Er Ha's eyes twitched. "Gold bars?"</p>

    <p>The baldie nodded his head. "Mm... genuine gold bars made by hand out of immortal gold."</p>

    <p>"...Fuck! Immortal gold!" Er Ha was dumbfounded because immortal gold was extremely pricey!</p>

    <p>It had studied the current monetary system, and knew that HNY was the standard currency used in Huaxiu nation. In an age of national cultivation, even ordinary families traded with cultivators in HNY. However, cultivators were more used to the old way of doing things among themselves, and immortal gold was the commonly used standard.</p>

    <p>One immortal gold bar, created from the essence of heaven and earth, was roughly the price of a toilet within Jinghua city's fifth ring! It was priceless...</p>

    <p>With eight thousand immortal gold bars, Er Ha estimated that it could buy four houses in the fifth ring, three houses in the fourth, one house in the third, and perhaps put a down payment on one in the second <sup>1</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Based on Beijing's ring roads
system, the closer one gets to
the center, the first ring, the
more expensive real estate
becomes.)</dfn>

    <p>Er Ha: "Who on earth gave you this information?"</p>

    <p>The baldie: "I think he's a big shot in the industry. He gave me the information anonymously, but when he sold it to me at the time, he also gave me enough homegrown vegetables to fill a car."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Vegetables?"</p>

    <p>The baldie nodded seriously, and his hand flashed with spirit light... an instant later, a large broccoli appeared in his palm.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..." That profiteer!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>While the old man was preparing dinner, Wang Ling led the baldie upstairs. He had no intention of inviting him to eat dinner; there was an order to everything, and after all, he wasn't that close to this legendary killer. Even from the chat group, only Dharmaraja and Lord Diulei had been invited to dinner before.</p>

    <p>After being shown to Wang Ling's room, the baldie forthrightly sat down on the floor and crossed his arms, a profound expression on his face.</p>

    <p>Sitting in his chair, Wang Ling held Er Ha in his lap and patted its butt, directly getting it to speak for him.</p>

    <p>Er Ha stared at the baldie. "Tell us what's going on."</p>

    <p>"I believe Ling Zhenren will have heard a lot about the Shuigou Sect issue recently." The baldie came straight to the point as he fixed his eyes on Wang Ling. "Actually, the person behind Shuigou Sect is my shishu <sup>2</sup> , Taoist Taotie..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Literally translates to 'teacher
uncle,' and is the sect brother
of a person's shifu.)</dfn>

    <p>Hearing this, Wang Ling arched his eyebrow as he remembered Lao Gudong recounting the events to do with Taoist Taotie and Gorgeous Itinerant in his theory of history class.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "So your shifu is Gorgeous Itinerant?"</p>

    <p>"That's right."</p>

    <p>The baldie let out a sigh. "All of this stems from a grudge between them. I'm still investigating the details, but based on current leads, my shishu' s reason for establishing Shuigou Sect was for revenge. Back then, my shifu accidentally killed my shishu' s adopted son, Black Gauze."</p>

    <p>Er Ha licked its fur. "Was he a killer as well?"</p>

    <p>The baldie shook his head. "No, he wasn't. I've gone through everyone on the ranking list of killers, and I've never seen his name. Furthermore, I only learned about this matter when I fought my shishu recently; this is most likely the reason for why they parted ways and then withdrew from the assassination circle."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Then why did he establish Shuigou Sect?"</p>

    <p>The baldie furrowed his brow and said, "Shuigou Sect is currently researching and developing a kind of fruit which can trigger the potential of Foundation Establishment cultivators in a short period of time. From the information I obtained, there is an incubation period after the fruit is eaten. Once it ends, the energy inside the fruit is released... But it's difficult to keep this energy suppressed purely by relying on a Foundation Establishment physique, which then ultimately results in a spirit explosion."</p>

    <p>A spirit explosion? Er Ha trembled, and even Wang Ling's pupils contracted.</p>

    <p>If this was the case, then the reason why Shuigou Sect had returned those twelve missing students was obvious: It was the same as placing twelve human bombs in the schools.</p>

    <p>A spirit explosion contained the same amount of power as a mini nuclear warhead. Generally speaking, the higher a cultivator's realm, the more powerful the spirit explosion would be, since a cultivator would have amassed tremendous amounts of spirit energy in their body. Now that those missing students had eaten fruit that could trigger their spirit potential, once they became unable to contain it, they would blow up on the spot one after another.</p>

    <p>The baldie sighed. "Initially, I had planned to mediate this matter, but in the end I was too weak and unable to persuade my shishu ."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Even you failed? Aren't you a legendary killer?"</p>

    <p>The baldie's lips twitched. "In the murder industry, the lowest-ranked killers are divided into three classes, from third to first; middle-ranked killers are divided into advanced and peak classes; and top-ranked killers are divided into legendary and epic classes... A legendary killer like me can't beat an epic killer."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "If I may ask, what is the difference between the legendary and epic classes?"</p>

    <p>The baldie: "Hm... it's the difference between a village novice's wooden bench and a dragon-slaying sword."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>"Also, there are only two acknowledged epic killers in the assassination world: one is my shifu Gorgeous Itinerant and the other is my shishu Taoist Taotie."</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, the baldie paused. "Of course, there is actually another great ancestral figure... that is my shifu and shishu' s shifu , Numinous Mother with the Magic Hands."</p>

    <p>Er Ha and Wang Ling were both startled by this name.</p>

    <p>Great ancestor?</p>

    <p>And so, Wang Ling pinched Er Ha's butt to indicate it should keep asking questions.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Is this person very strong?"</p>

    <p>"I've never traded blows with her, so I don't know." The baldie shook his head, then said, "But she was the one who wrote a compendium of all the martial arts in our assassination circle. Do you know the One Thousand Years of Death <sup>3</sup> ? She was the one who came up with it!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(A reminder that this is a
translation of the Japanese
'Sennen Goroshi,' which is a
ninja technique used in the
Japanese cartoon Naruto,
and involves clasping the
hands together so that the
index fingers are sticking out and poking them into a person's anus..)</dfn>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
