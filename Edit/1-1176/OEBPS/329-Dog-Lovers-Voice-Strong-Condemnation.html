  <h1>Chapter 329 Dog Lovers Voice Strong Condemnation </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling was surprised by Killer Taoist's visit.</p>

    <p>It could be said that of all the people who had ever visited the Wang family's small villa, this person was the best at containing his aura.</p>

    <p>Generally, as long as there were cultivators on East Huang Road outside the villa, Wang Ling would immediately sense them. There were not more than twenty people in the entire world who were capable of this kind of aura concealment skill. This was a required course in a killer's education; for a legendary killer in particular, his proficiency in this technique would have already reached the pinnacle of perfection.</p>

    <p>"Is Ling Zhenren busy now?" the middle-aged baldie asked, looking at Er Ha after glancing at the bright lights on the second floor.</p>

    <p>Like Wang Ling, Er Ha had also guessed the person's identity. With this type of body movement and superb aura concealment skill, coupled with the rumored penchant for floral underpants, it knew that this person had to be Killer Taoist... but Er Ha still couldn't quite accept this appearance.</p>

    <p>He was at the very least a legendary killer among human cultivators, but he had shown up in floral underpants and flip-flops... He was like the old man who sold youtiao at the entrance to the food market; his style, so to speak, was very unique.</p>

    <p>Er Ha looked at the man in front of it and lay back down disinterestedly. It then pointed to the lights on the second floor and mimed writing on the ground with its claw. Finally, it stared at the man and drew a small claw across its throat.</p>

    <p>What he meant was: Ling Zhenren is doing homework. Anyone who disturbs him, die!</p>

    <p>To Er Ha's surprise, the man actually understood the meaning conveyed through its claws.</p>

    <p>The other party just smiled and looked very amiable. "That's fine; since Ling Zhenren is busy, I'll wait here."</p>

    <p>Then he came up to Er Ha and nudged its butt with one flip-flop.</p>

    <p>Killer Taoist: "Make room for me."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "???"</p>

    <p>Er Ha startled; the Wang family's garden might not be especially big, but it wasn't to the point that there wasn't anywhere else to sit... Go sit somewhere else, why do I have to fucking make room for you?!</p>

    <p>Killer Taoist smiled. "It looks like you've been lying in that spot for a long time, so it must be very warm."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..." Psycho!</p>

    <p>Taking a deep breath, Er Ha got up in the end and moved to the side, shaking out its dog tail with a face full of resentment. God knew what strange fetish this legendary killer might have. As a loyal and well-behaved dog, it was really too lazy to argue with other people. It would just treat this as respecting the old.</p>

    <p>The middle-aged baldie got what he wanted, and sat down in Er Ha's original spot. Then, completely ignoring Er Ha's resistance, he directly reached out to grab it by the waist and pull it into his lap.</p>

    <p>Er Ha would have struggled, but it didn't dare move at the faint killing intent hidden in the baldie's smile. It wanted to cry, but had no tears to shed. If it had known earlier, it wouldn't have lolled about in the garden. Why did it have to encounter this freak? Er Ha was spoiled by everyone in the Wang family's small villa; it had never been so aggrieved before.</p>

    <p>Now, however, it could only stifle its anger, and it didn't even dare take deep breaths... because it couldn't guess what Killer Taoist's next move would be at all.</p>

    <p>It could only be said that Killer Taoist was truly a legendary killer... his way of thinking was like a winding mountain road that completely befuddled people.</p>

    <p>After that, Killer Taoist started to stroke Er Ha's dog fur. He was surprised to find that it actually had pretty solid muscles. He had thought that it was just a green akita with spiritual intelligence. Through this contact, however, he realized that this dog wasn't as simple as it seemed.</p>

    <p>"You're a dog with potential." He patted Er Ha on its springy butt.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>The baldie lavished praise on it. "You're great! As expected of Ling Zhenren's pet. If you continue cultivating, it won't take you more than a hundred years to become a superb first-class spirit beast."</p>

    <p>Er Ha didn't say anything, but it wagged its tail proudly.</p>

    <p>If an outsider heard this, they would definitely think the person saying it was an idiot. A top-class spirit beast would already be able to take on human form, but it wasn't easy to advance to this level; it required at least a thousand years' worth of cultivation, and the beast would need to experience the heavenly tribulation once.</p>

    <p>But Er Ha was different.</p>

    <p>It had the original soul of a demon king and had the necessary cultivation experience. In addition, Little Master Ling had specially modified its cultivation technique and customized it exclusively for Er Ha; hence, it could reap twice the results for half the effort.</p>

    <p>It was like many characters who were reincarnated in novels; most of them just cultivated the same technique again as in their previous lives. Generally, as long as they weren't dumbasses, their cultivation speed would definitely increase.</p>

    <p>Originally, it would have taken Er Ha several thousand years to reach the level of a first-class spirit beast, but it wasn't an exaggeration to say that it would take only a hundred years or even less now.</p>

    <p>This was also a testament to Killer Taoist's keen insight as a legendary assassin.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In actual fact, Wang Ling had already finished his homework earlier on. Pen and Eraser, these two hardworking paragons in the world of homework, had come together the instant Wang Ling had finished reviewing his lessons, and had finishing writing up his homework in less than five minutes.</p>

    <p>He stood on the second floor and looked out the window at the harmonious scene of a person and a dog in the yard.</p>

    <p>Holding Er Ha, the baldie continued to stroke its dog fur. "Do you know, I used to have a dog. I picked it up off the street, and back then it had been sick, so I'd actually always felt a special attachment to it. The first time I saw it, I thought that it wasn't a simple dog."</p>

    <p>Er Ha wagged its tail; it had never expected this legendary killer to be a dog lover.</p>

    <p>"Then I took the dog home to treat it. I fed it elixirs and all kinds of heavenly treasures, and it ate better than I did. But half a month later, before it was fully recovered..." At this point, Killer Taoist's eyes were already sparkling a little with tears as he recalled the past, and he said very emotionally, "I especially bought a barrel to bathe it in everyday in heated water."</p>

    <p>Er Ha was very moved when he heard this, but the baldie paused before he continued, "Until one day, I forgot to turn off the fire..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Killer Taoist: "After that, I discovered that that guy was pretty delicious."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Killer Taoist: "I should say that when I saw it for the first time, I did think it would taste very good!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>As he spoke, Killer Taoist pointed to a glistening tear in the corner of his eye. "See this tear? Every time I recall how good that dog meat tasted, it makes me want to cry!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..." Freak!</p>
