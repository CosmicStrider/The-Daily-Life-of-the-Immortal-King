  <h1>Chapter 1109 Preparing For The Competition</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was Monday, November 10th.</p>

    <p>The special training which Teacher Pan had previously announced officially began.</p>

    <p>During this period, Number 60 High set up a temporary special training class for all participating students.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Sun Rong, and Xia Ming... were here.</p>

    <p>Xia Ming actually felt a little awkward.</p>

    <p>But it seemed that Wang Ling didn't mind so much.</p>

    <p>All of a sudden, Xia Ming felt that he really was a complete loser compared with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He saw that Wang Ling was the same as usual with his poker face and not even a smile, as he sat by the window like an old man who was indifferent to everything. Xia Ming's heart burst with stifled resentment.</p>

    <p>Why was this person so calm?!</p>

    <p>Was he really just a teenage high school student?</p>

    <p>This special training was mainly focused on the following three aspects.</p>

    <p>One: Understanding of spirit plants.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan had already clearly explained the specific reasons for this in the chat group. There were tens of thousands of spirit plants on Nine Dragon Mountain, and most of them were inedible. Even if you were fine after eating a spirit plant, you might still get food poisoning if it wasn't completely digested before you ate another kind of spirit plant.</p>

    <p>Although, Wang Ling didn't think there were any plants that could poison him...</p>

    <p>Two: Understanding of the opponents.</p>

    <p>Now that the scale of the competition had expanded, the number of enemies Number 60 High had to deal with suddenly increased from less than ten to 101. Each cultivation high school had a different background and education focus, so it was very important to have a rough understanding of these rival schools.</p>

    <p>Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will be victorious. Of course, given the limited time they had, Headmaster Chen could only select some key schools to focus on. As for the other high schools which he felt were more or less on par with Number 60 High in terms of combat ability, he organized the information for the participating students to memorize.</p>

    <p>So, at the beginning of the lesson, Wang Ling saw a thick pile of papers on each person's desk...</p>

    <p>With just one sweeping glance from his King's Eye, all the information on the high schools was instantly recorded in his mind.</p>

    <p>Hm....</p>

    <p>There was nothing special to take note of.</p>

    <p>As long as he was careful not to kill anyone when he hit them, it would be fine... If he really did accidentally kill someone, he could resurrect them, but the problem was they would carry that mental trauma with them for the rest of their life!</p>

    <p>That was even if the memory of it was erased.</p>

    <p>There would still be a subconscious reaction in the mind every now and then.</p>

    <p>It was like how so many people were afraid of heights.</p>

    <p>Maybe it was because they accidentally fell from a high place before, and while that memory was gone...</p>

    <p>In addition to the two points above, the third and final point was the body techniques special training.</p>

    <p>It was obviously somewhat unrealistic to improve body techniques and abilities quickly in a few days.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling was guessing that Headmaster Chen might share something a little more technical. It was very common in using body techniques to create tremendous force with little effort. Someone who was always in high alert mode in a battle royale which would last for eight days wouldn't be able to hold out to the end, and would ultimately be knocked out.</p>

    <p>"Students, this large-scale battle is very important. You will be competing against students from 101 other schools on Nine Dragon Mountain to determine a winner. It's going to be a war of attrition over eight days, so we must formulate our tactics well in advance."</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen began to teach from the dais. "This is different from the previous joint military training for six schools. During the training, the terrain and environment were man made, and while it appeared dangerous, it was in fact safe. However, anything unexpected can happen on Nine Dragon Mountain at any time. If you're going to battle it out with people in the jungles of Nine Dragon Mountain, you have to divide the work between yourselves well in advance, and maintain team unity at the same time. If someone goes missing and you're short of team members, there is a very high chance that you'll be swallowed up by students from the other schools."</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, Headmaster Chen took out an iron chopstick. "This is a black iron chopstick."</p>

    <p>He then handed it to Gu Shunzhi. "Student Gu, try breaking this chopstick."</p>

    <p>CRACK!</p>

    <p>The chopstick broke in two with a crisp sound.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi had done as requested.</p>

    <p>Breaking chopsticks was a standard test in demonstrating the importance of teamwork, and most of them could already see it at that point.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, Headmaster Chen then took out ten more chopsticks. "Student Gu, try breaking these again."</p>

    <p>CRACK!</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi broke them without breaking a sweat.</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen: "..."</p>

    <p>He then took out the last of the chopsticks in a huge bundle. "Student Gu... Try again..."</p>

    <p>CRACK!</p>

    <p>Again, Gu Shunzhi showed no mercy.</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen: "Come, everyone... Let's move on to the next topic..."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Teamwork.</p>

    <p>This was the keyword Headmaster Chen had mentioned at the beginning of the lesson.</p>

    <p>This large-scale battle was a team battle.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, it was a point-based system this time, and was based on the total number of points that team members collected. All schools had to ensure that as many of their team members as possible remained alive until the very end.</p>

    <p>Only in this way could they get more points.</p>

    <p>Because points were awarded according to a fixed system, Headmaster Chen would touch on it later.</p>

    <p>The points awarded were standard, so if too many people were knocked out from the team, it didn't matter how strong the remaining team members were individually; the number of points that could be obtained in the end wouldn't be much, since one person's strength couldn't compare with the strength of several combined.</p>

    <p>Teamwork was the essence of the battle this time.</p>

    <p>But Headmaster Chen was still more concerned about conflict inside the Number 60 High team; he was worried that some problem might crop up between Xia Ming and Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling wasn't a student who proactively looked for trouble, while in comparison, Xia Ming was more impulsive...</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen had to figure out a way to resolve this before the start of the competition.</p>

    <p>At the very least, he had to get Xia Ming and Wang Ling to shake hands as a demonstration of cordiality.</p>

    <p>"Next, I'm going to introduce you to the stronger cultivation high schools in this large-scale battle. If you run into students from these schools and you are unable to grasp the situation, please avoid fighting them as much as possible for the sake of our school's honor, and ensure that you yourselves survive..." said Headmaster Chen.</p>

    <p>"Are they that strong?" Although Guo Hao had heard from his uncle earlier on that there was indeed a fair number of strong high school students participating in the competition, he never thought that if their Number 60 High bunch went out, they weren't even qualified to face them, and that it was fine for them to directly run away...</p>

    <p>"The first one is Number 1 Devil-Subduing High School in Jinghua city." Headmaster Chen turned the magic ball in his hand, and an image was instantly projected into the air. It was a picture of students of Number 1 Devil-Subduing High School. This was a group of students in black and white sports uniforms. The uniform color was very gloomy, and the students didn't look like they could be trifled with.</p>
