  <h1>Chapter 337 No Zuo No Die<sup>0</sup> </h1>

  <div>
  
    <dfn><sup>0</sup>('Zuo' means 'do,' so the phrase reads as 'no do, no die,' and means that as long as you don't do something dumb, it won't come back to haunt you.)</dfn>

    <p>Like the coconut old man had said, there were various ways to undergo the Samsara Calamity, and many of the souls that entered the Reincarnation Gate went the conventional route with the Thunder Calamity. Naturally, it carried the least risk. While it was painful, it was still better than some other peculiar ways... like the coconut old man setting up this space in the heavenly fissure, waiting for a disciple to come here before the person went on to build statues of him all over the world; he might as well wait until hell froze over.</p>

    <p>Leaving the space, Wang Ling recalled his Heavenly Eye and tossed the ancient jade to Luo Chuang.</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang stared at him expectantly. "Ling Zhenren, is it real?"Wang Ling nodded his head.</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang had indeed discovered treasure.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling hadn't had a lot of time, so he hadn't been able to determine what kind of nomological law was contained inside the heavenly fissure stone. Hearing Wang Ling's reply, Luo Chuang's smile grew as wide as Vileplume's. "I can't believe that this thing I simply bought would turn out to be such a treasure!"</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang was naturally happy, while Wang Ling wasn't happy in the slightest... He had just wanted to help the other man verify whether the heavenly fissure stone was genuine or not. Who would have ever thought that there would actually be a sealed True Immortal space inside. While that coconut old man didn't look like he was a bad person, Wang Ling didn't want to have anything to do with someone like that at all.</p>

    <p>Actually, this was the beginning of Wang Ling's doomed fate...</p>

    <p>A heavenly fissure stone contained boundless spirit potential. For those who could harness it, it would be equal to possessing the strength of a True Immortal. Also, the stone could help a person advance in realms; it was a priceless treasure that was hard to come by. But a priceless treasure usually led to the misfortune of being killed.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling lowered his eyes and gave Luo Chuang a meaningful glance as a sign of caution; this could be considered a kind reminder.</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang immediately understood.</p>

    <p>Putting the heavenly fissure stone away properly, he smiled widely. "Ling Zhenren, rest assured, I have no need of this ancient jade at this time; at the most, it's just a collector's item."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded his head and straightaway turned around. Luo Chuang saw his body turn transparent, and then directly disappear in front of him.</p>

    <p>He couldn't help exclaiming with admiration in his heart at this scene.</p>

    <p>This was probably the legendary teleportation spell, right?</p>

    <p>His heart was full of envy; Ling Zhenren's realm was truly too high... Even if Luo Chuang devoted all his time to chasing him, he probably still wouldn't be able to catch up even after several thousand years.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Back home, Wang Ling lay on his bed and thought about that coconut old man from earlier.</p>

    <p>He never thought that there were actually people in this world persistently chasing after the Venerated Immortal realm. For most people, this was an unreal level, and there were very few ancient texts that described the individuals who had attained this realm. The only one that was recorded to some extent was the legendary Immortal Zhenyuan. The rumor was that he was a Venerated Immortal, but in fact, there was no basis to this rumor, and no way to verify it in the texts.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling clenched his fist. The purpose of the talisman seal stuck on his arm was to better control his aura and suppress his spirit energy so that he could live a normal life. When he needed to, he could still wield an astonishing amount of power. For example, when he had shut the Gate Between Worlds with one hand, he remembered that he had already released power on par with the level of a True Immortal without needing to remove the seal.</p>

    <p>Then, if he were ever to remove this seal... even Wang Ling himself didn't know what would happen.</p>

    <p>After lying on his bed for a while, Wang Ling's eyelids suddenly twitched violently and he actually felt a little sleepy. That was strange - since young he had always had one shortcoming, and that was that he didn't like to sleep. He could even count the number of times he had ever felt sleepy in his entire life on his fingers.</p>

    <p>...Had he consumed too much energy when he had used the Heavenly Eye earlier?</p>

    <p>He didn't know that using the Heavenly Eye to examine a heavenly fissure would actually consume so much vision power. But after thinking it through, Wang Ling felt that that shouldn't have been enough to make him sleepy. Instead, the most likely reason was the amount of vision power that had been consumed when he had used the Heavenly Eye to leave that old man's space.</p>

    <p>In that island space back then, he remembered the coconut old man solemnly vowing that Wang Ling would never be able to leave the space.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately for the coconut old man, that wasn't something for him to decide.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had initially planned to do a light review for the next class after delivering the old man's kitchen knife to Luo Chuang for maintenance. But given his sleepiness now, he didn't want to move, and he stuck to his bed like cotton candy. Staring at his desk a few meters away, he stretched out one hand, but it slowly dropped down...</p>

    <p>Maybe this was the legendary "Cancer of Laziness."</p>

    <p>Forget it... sleep for a bit, he could do the review later.</p>

    <p>Looking at his study table, Wang Ling had already given up resisting.</p>

    <p>Before he closed his eyes, he sent a message on his watch to Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>He had retrieved the Heavenly Materials sword from Luo Chuang; Wang Ling felt that it was still safer for Wang Ming to come get the sword himself rather than rely on express delivery, even with insurance. Given the materials contained in the Heavenly Materials sword, if the delivery company really lost it, selling off the entire company still wouldn't be able to compensate for it.</p>

    <p>After writing up the message and sending it off, Wang Ling turned onto his side on the bed and slowly closed his slightly aching eyes.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling seldom dreamed; under normal circumstances, he wouldn't dream when he slept, though he would occasionally have precognitive dreams.</p>

    <p>After four minutes or so, he could confirm that he had entered dreamland...</p>

    <p>In front of him was a boundless ocean, and he was actually standing on an island...</p>

    <p>Wait a minute...</p>

    <p>There was something familiar about this scene!</p>

    <p>The corners of Wang Ling's mouth twitched. Turning around resolutely to look behind him, he happened to see that coconut old man from before, gazing at him with a crafty smile. "Hehehe! Little brother, I told you, you can't escape!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>The coconut old man said proudly, "I already set up a soul binding agreement in this space earlier on. The first person to enter this space will automatically form a contract with me. From now on, whenever you dream, you'll dream of me! Isn't that nice? Exciting? Amazing?"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the next moment, Wang Ling woke up with a start.</p>

    <p>Was it because he hadn't slept for so long that his sleeping pattern had been thrown off?</p>

    <p>He looked at the time and realized that despite being in the dream for such a short time, he had actually slept for twenty whole minutes.</p>

    <p>What kind of feeling was this...</p>

    <p>If Wang Ling had to describe it, it was like being startled awake on your deathbed after holding your girlfriend, only to realize that she had a third leg <sup>1</sup> ...</p>
