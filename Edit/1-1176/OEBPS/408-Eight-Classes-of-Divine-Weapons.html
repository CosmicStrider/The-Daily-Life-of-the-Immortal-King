  <h1>Chapter 408 Eight Classes of Divine Weapons </h1>

  <div>

    <p>As expected, this microwave had also been enchanted?</p>

    <p>Perhaps the question instead should be: Was there anything in this villa that wasn't enchanted...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei couldn't help wiping at his sweat; he had in fact seen a lot of transformed magic treasures here, from the fridge, the air-conditioner and the washing machine to the toilet, the wardrobe and the rice cooker... There didn't seem to be anything that had not been enchanted. As for the enchanted microwave, this was Lord Diulei's first time seeing it...</p>

    <p>He didn't know whether these household items enchanted by Wang Ling were lethal or not, but they were definitely practical. Even if some of the furniture still looked like nothing more than decoration after being enchanted, they were like geoducks: they seemed useless but looked impressive!</p>

    <p>Staring at the microwave that was on, Lord Diulei was lost in deep thought.</p>

    <p>Then, very quickly, this train of thought was interrupted by a "ding" from the microwave.</p>

    <p>What the hell?! It was done?</p>

    <p>It hadn't even been two minutes!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei couldn't help twitching his lips as he did his best to contain his urge to swear.</p>

    <p>The metal which a magnetic stone was made of was one of the harder metals used in refining weapons. In order to smelt it in a furnace, it usually required a spirit flame at a controlled temperature of more or less fifteen thousand degrees, and would take roughly two hours.</p>

    <p>In the end, Wang Ling had managed to do it by placing the magnetic stone in an enchanted microwave for less than two minutes.</p>

    <p>If this leaked out, how many weaponsmiths would spew mouthfuls of blood in front of their furnaces...</p>

    <p>Very good!</p>

    <p>It was very scientific...</p>

    <p>Opening the microwave, Wang Ling used a gravity spell to draw out the liquid metal of the smelted magnetic stone. After smelting, the liquid metal was a dusky gold in color and had a faint sheen to it.</p>

    <p>Manipulating this liquid, Wang Ling had it coalesce into a ball and it hovered in the air.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, what's the success rate of this refining method? What are the odds of it failing?" Very curious, Lord Diulei couldn't help but ask the question.</p>

    <p>This method of refining was really too quick; at this speed, it would really be abnormal if its success rate could still remain high! It was like using up almost all your money in a game to buy twenty weapon upgrade scrolls, directly boosting your weapon twenty-fold in one go. In a normal situation, whether it was refining weapons or a power boost, it was all a matter of probability.</p>

    <p>Just as there was a probability of success, there was naturally a probability of failure...</p>

    <p>Back then, who knew how many times Luo Chuang had failed while he had been trying to create the pigskin armor.</p>

    <p>"It won't fail."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling replied telepathically, eyes fixed on the floating ball of liquid metal.</p>

    <p>One hundred percent success rate?</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei sucked in another sharp breath at this; he already didn't dare reveal too much astonishment on his face, for fear of being ridiculed by the green-furred dog lying at his feet.</p>

    <p>Actually, while the success rate of the Great Weapon-Refining Spell was very high, there was indeed still the possibility that it could fail. The reason why Wang Ling could be so confident that it wouldn't was because he still carried the effects of the Great Fortune Spell from a few days ago.</p>

    <p>He had activated this spell when he had drawn the lottery for Father Wang, and its effects had yet to disappear.</p>

    <p>Once activated, it could last for ten days. Because he wasn't really familiar with the spell, it had always been on the backburner until now.</p>

    <p>It was a complete coincidence that he could use it in tandem with the Great Weapon-Refining Spell now.</p>

    <p>With the two spells combined together, the success rate of refining a weapon had jumped to 99.99 percent - he couldn't fail even if he wanted to!</p>

    <p>Unlike the normal weapon-refining process, there was a unique step in the Great Weapon-Refining Spell which was "modeling."</p>

    <p>While other weaponsmiths refined weapons by hand, Wang Ling relied on meditation...</p>

    <p>Next, standing in front of this hovering ball of liquid metal, Wang Ling did some hand seals.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei saw a ray of light spring forth from the seal and slowly blend into the ball of liquid metal.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, what kind of ring are you forging?" Observing from the side, Lord Diulei was very curious.</p>

    <p>There were different types of magic rings, so there were different types of spaces built into them. With the magic rings currently sold on the market, if a ring didn't have an independent space set up inside, it would be embarrassing to call it a magic ring - it would be even rarer still if the ring could hold a person!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei looked on with an ineffable expression on his face as Er Ha took out a atlas on refining weapons with its paws.</p>

    <p>It was a rather worn antique book that was impressively thick; it looked like those magic texts in the western world, with a leather cover and five traditional cultivation characters inscribed on it in gold lettering: <em>Eight Classes of Divine Weapons <sup>1</sup> </em>...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is a literal translation of 八门神器,which is an app for using cheats or modifying aspects in a game.)</dfn>

    <p>Lord Diulei also studied the cultivation classics, so he could read these old characters.</p>

    <p>This was indeed a atlas on refining weapons, but it actually wasn't anything uncommon at all. It was on par with an encyclopedia in the weapon-refining industry or the Four Classic Novels in the literature circle: they were circulated widely, though no one could be sure who their authors were.</p>

    <p>Since there weren't any copyright issues with this atlas, different versions had been published by major dealers and were sold in bookstores; it was the type of book that could be found in any random Xinhua bookstore <sup>2</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(China's largest bookstore chain..)</dfn>

    <p>Most importantly, although <em>Eight Classes of Divine Weapons </em>was an almost comprehensive record of all kinds of magic weapons which were described in detail, it was typically impossible to use this book as a reference to forge magic weapons.</p>

    <p>Refining weapons was a complex art; one minor mistake could lead to failure. Although <em>Eight Classes of Divine Weapons </em>was comprehensive, it only gave an overview on how to forge the magic weapons and lacked exact details... To be blunt, it was an incomplete atlas.</p>

    <p>Although every single magic weapon recorded down in it was very powerful, as far as Lord Diulei knew, no one had ever been able to refine a weapon from the book.</p>

    <p>But he thought it was a little strange. "Brother Er Ha, why does the cover of this book seem different to what I remember?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "You don't know, but this <em>Eight Classes of Divine Weapons </em>is the original; it was Father Wang's fan who gave it to him. All the versions reproduced on the market are more or less incomplete, but this one is complete!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was astounded. "Old Senior Wang's novel fan?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "That's right, this fan said that it was to give Father Wang source material for his novels."</p>

    <p>"What kind of novel fan can give this thing?" Lord Diulei broke out in a sweat.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, it was considered pretty good already if authors weren't receiving razor blades in the mail from fans! Or there were those that stirred up trouble by madly sending the authors gifts to make them update... nowadays, an author's liver was in a worrying state of suffering!</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "This fan is awesome - he even sent Father Wang cigars that not just anybody can get their hands on."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Who is he?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Can't say, can't say..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>
