  <h1>Chapter 785 Wang Ling One's Killing Move</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Was it the Spirit Energy Cannon?</p>

    <p>Wu Zhenjun narrowed his eyes at the sky.</p>

    <p>It indeed felt like the Spirit Energy Cannon, since he could sense energy rapidly accumulating in the cannon muzzle on Wang Ming's right arm.</p>

    <p>"Lao Gudong Xiaoer wants to use the Spirit Energy Cannon to counter my killing move? Dream on." Wu Zhenjun shook his head.</p>

    <p>The next moment, his aura turned heavy.</p>

    <p><em>Rumble!</em></p>

    <p>The black fountain on the ground suddenly started to roil; it was a sign of danger.</p>

    <p>"Wu Zhenjun is moving!" the students shouted one after another.</p>

    <p>Inside this apocalyptic-looking contest space within the barrier, the purple spirit Yin eel's ultimate Yin electricity swept across the whole scene like a lightning dragon. A sky-shattering crash shook the entire barrier as a thunderstorm raged inside; without this barrier restriction, Beast King's Remains might suffer a calamity if this thunderstorm spread.</p>

    <p>Students in an era of peace had never seen such a scene. Although they knew very well that they were separated from the battlefield by the barrier and that this power wouldn't touch them, many of them still trembled at this momentum, their faces pale.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong and Lin Xiaoyu subconsciously hugged each other. "So scary!"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao and Guo Hao were also terrified. "How frightening..."</p>

    <p>Sweeping his gaze over his surroundings, Wang Ling realized that everyone nearby all looked alarmed, and he hurriedly performed a small spell to instantly make his face pale.</p>

    <p>Honestly speaking, while this was indeed a frightening spectacle, it was nothing compared with that showdown back then between Immortal Zhenyuan and Wind Spirit.</p>

    <p>When the two Venerated Immortals fought, they had almost flattened a planet.</p>

    <p>So in contrast, Wang Ling didn't think this kind of fight was much of anything.</p>

    <p>But in a sea of drunk people, he didn't want to look like the only one who was sober.</p>

    <p>It was still safer to follow the crowd; it wouldn't be good if he aroused suspicion.</p>

    <p>Thus, Wang Ling performed the "Turn White Spell," which turned his face deathly pale.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, he did his best to secrete a few beads of sweat...</p>

    <p>In the end, when Chen Chao came back to his senses and looked at Wang Ling, he was frightened by the latter's complexion. "Oh my god! Are you ok?"</p>

    <p>Those next to them who had been watching the battle were all distracted by this cry and turned to look in Wang Ling's direction.</p>

    <p>Many people saw that a Number 60 High student was actually so frightened that his face had drained of all color and his forehead was covered in cold sweat.</p>

    <p>Su Xiao was also frightened by Wang Ling's face, and then recalled the incident with President Bai. "Is he still traumatized by his near-death experience from being sucked into the space by President Bai?"</p>

    <p>After all, it had only been less than a week since it happened.</p>

    <p>The wreath which the class had chipped in to buy for Wang Ling had yet to wither...</p>

    <p>How could it be so easy to overcome such mental trauma?</p>

    <p>Guo Hao patted Wang Ling's shoulder cheerfully and laughed in a low voice. "As a mascot, how can you be so timid?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"It's ok! Let this brother hug you and see if it makes you feel a little better." After saying that, Guo Hao spread his arms wide to hug Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But as Guo Hao plastered himself to Wang Ling, he felt a shiver go down his spine and his forehead felt cold all of a sudden.</p>

    <p>His complexion then started to turn deathly pale as he trembled slightly.</p>

    <p>Both Chen Chao and Su Xiao were alarmed. "What the hell?! It's contagious?"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "I'm fine. Just that for some reason, it feels like a cold wind is blowing, and it's stifling, like a snake is wrapped around me."</p>

    <p>After Guo Hao said this, Wang Ling looked into the distance out of the corner of his eye.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing immediately avoided his gaze.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, a huge fight was about to happen at any moment.</p>

    <p>After Wu Zhenjun gathered his qi in his dantian, a tremendous sound wave crackling with fierce purple electricity blasted forth from the huge horn formed by the coiled purple spirit Yin eel, like a world-destroying electromagnetic cannon.</p>

    <p><em>Rumble!</em></p>

    <p>A terrifying force tore through the air. The electric ripples that sparked the air, along with the mixed sounds of the waves, wind and electricity of the black fountain on the ground, reverberated continuously within the barrier, as if the sound of a Great Dao was contained deep within.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's eyebrows knitted slightly at this scene.</p>

    <p>Irascible Dharmaraja was indeed a rare cultivation genius. When he had created the Buddha Lightning Combo back then, it actually involved a lot of know-how.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, the rumor was that after Irascible Dharmaraja took in Wu Zhenjun as his disciple, he suddenly disappeared one day, and even his disciple couldn't find his whereabouts.</p>

    <p>A large part of the reason why Wu Zhenjun had been out in the field all these years was in fact to look for his <em>shifu </em>Irascible Dharmaraja.</p>

    <p>The rumor in the outside world was that Irascible Dharmaraja knew that his life was coming to an end, and after finding a disciple to inherit his legacy, he went looking for a quiet and peaceful place to die in.</p>

    <p>No one knew whether this was true or not.</p>

    <p>In a word, if Wang Ling were to comment on this Buddha Lightning Combo...</p>

    <p>Of all level six spells, this spell probably came the closest to Heavenly Dao. While it was much less powerful than Heavenly Dao, it was still very intimidating.</p>

    <p>This technique was powerful to the extreme.</p>

    <p>Next was to see how Wang Ming responded.</p>

    <p>Obviously, Wang Ming had already come up with a countermeasure. Almost the instant Wu Zhenjun had discharged this killing move, Wang Ming's ten-layer Spirit Energy Cannon was already firing at the sky.</p>

    <p>This Spirit Energy Cannon wasn't aimed at Wu Zhenjun, nor was it meant to counter his technique - it was to break open the space wall!</p>

    <p>This move instantly drew the attention of many of the teachers, since they didn't know what Wang Ming was going to do. However, relying solely on a suit of armor to break open the space wall was already pretty astonishing.</p>

    <p>"What is Lao Gudong Xiaoer trying to do, breaking open the space wall?"</p>

    <p>"He's not planning to run, is he..."</p>

    <p>A lot of the people watching had no idea what Wang Ming's move meant.</p>

    <p>"Wu Zhenjun, it's too na√Øve of you if you think the Spirit Energy Cannon is the only thing I have."</p>

    <p>After breaking open the space wall, Wang Ming smiled at Wu Zhenjun with sheer confidence.</p>

    <p>Wu Zhenjun didn't know what Wang Ming was going to do, but when he saw the latter's expression, he was already on guard.</p>

    <p>The next moment, Wang Ming fixed his gaze on Wu Zhenjun. "Heavenly E-Satellite! Lock onto target! E-Bomb Raining Down From Above! Fire!"</p>

    <p>After he said this, a speck of light actually appeared in the cracked space wall, which rapidly started to increase in size.</p>

    <p>At that moment, it wasn't just Wu Zhenjun, but the surrounding students and teachers plus President Qi and the rest of the Ten Generals at the command center in Huaxiu Alliance HQ all had indescribably alarmed expressions on their faces.</p>

    <p>Heavenly E-Satellite?</p>

    <p>When on earth...</p>

    <p>Wu Zhenjun finally realized what the killing move Wang Ming had mentioned was.</p>

    <p>His complexion changed dramatically.</p>

    <p>Bang!</p>

    <p>A devastating column of silver energy shot through the space wall. Like an energy wave, it pierced the air in Wu Zhenjun's direction and directly smashed into the Buddha Lightning Combo sound wave, the searing heat distorting the space around it.</p>

    <p>Web-like space fractures even appeared in the wake of that silver light beam, which brought ruin and chaos.</p>

    <p>In a mere split second, the dazzling light from this column of silver energy covered the whole of the inside of the barrier, and no one could clearly make out what on earth was happening...</p>
