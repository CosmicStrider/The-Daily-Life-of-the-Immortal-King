  <h1>Chapter 460 Meeting Is the Destiny Which Is Too Wonderful for Words... </h1>

  <div>

    <p>The bullet messages on the live stream screen instantly burst into exceptionally delighted laughter following Little Brother GAYLIGAYQI's professional gym marketing cry.</p>

    <p>"Does this little brother work as a fitness instructor?"</p>

    <p>"Not necessarily, he might have had a part-time job distributing leaflets before..."</p>

    <p>For a while, many people couldn't help trying to guess the little brother's identity.</p>

    <p>Based solely on his performance earlier, the little brother's marksmanship could be said to be very bad, to the extent that Wang Ling thought it was on par with Jiang Bai, the son of the head of the Kitchen Knife Sect at school, and his body outline-tracing arrows. However, this passerby little brother was very entertaining and seemed quite funny.</p>

    <p>However bad a player you were, being able to entertain the audience while gaming was number one.</p>

    <p>Even live stream gamers were divided into entertainment and professional live streamers.</p>

    <p>Thus, on many current live streaming platforms, it was common to see a lot of live stream duos. Their roles were usually clearly separated, with one in charge of skill and the other in charge of humor. Based on this, many people immediately thought that Lord Island and Little Brother GAYLIGAYQI were quite compatible!</p>

    <p>"Lord Island, Lord Island! Want to try winning double first place with Little Brother GAYLIGAYQI?"</p>

    <p>"This little brother is stupidly adorable, I think this can work."</p>

    <p>"I think it's totally OK!"</p>

    <p>"Let's talk about it after they win..."</p>

    <p>A lot of people were being rowdy in the bullet messages, but Daoist Guang paid them no attention. He crouched down in the tower with his katana in hand as he listened to the fragmented sounds of Little Brother GAYLIGAYQI's footsteps up ahead. Actually, the footsteps of all game characters were pretty much the same, and when they overlapped, it was very hard to pick individual ones out.</p>

    <p>But when Daoist Guang had watched the little brother walk out in that direction, a radar had automatically taken shape in his mind as he marked the little brother's position. From the sound of his footsteps, he was already pretty close to that group.</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang's guess was that this group which had hurried over from another town was also a temporary squad of four people.</p>

    <p>Although this was single player mode, in order to improve the chances of winning the Fish Pond Round, many people coming across other players in the first circle would propose to mutually cooperate with each other and divide their equipment and supplies equally. When the number of people was reduced to a particular limit, like if there were only twenty people left, they would disperse once again to fight each other.</p>

    <p>This was in fact quite the test of trust...</p>

    <p>Because there were times when some players would deliberately propose an alliance and ultimately stab others in the back in order to brush up their KDA <sup>1</sup>.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Kill/Death/Assist stats.)</dfn>

    <p>Daoist Guang had in fact already seen someone suggest in a bullet message that he and the little brother team up in the future.</p>

    <p>To be honest, he thought that this was good advice, but he still needed to see what this little brother's general level was like. It didn't matter if he was bad, as long as he could move forward. Besides, sending someone out to lure people in was something that only worked for sure in the Fish Pond Round... After all, there were a lot of fools in the Fish Pond Round!</p>

    <p>If it was a round which depended on high ability, it would be a showdown between experts.</p>

    <p>Forget openly trying to lure the other party in; if you dared show yourself, you would be shot in the head straightaway, no questions asked.</p>

    <p>The little brother had already been gone for twenty to thirty seconds, and Daoist Guang and his water friends <sup>2</sup> in the live stream room were all waiting for news. To be honest, though this seemed an easy thing to do, it might not necessarily work. If that little brother was killed, Daoist Guang would have wasted a lot of time here and definitely wouldn't be able to achieve his target of twenty kills.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Mutuals on social media platforms.)</dfn>

    <p>But there were times when Daoist Guang preferred to trust his intuition...</p>

    <p>He had chosen not to kill this little brother earlier because he felt that this was profound destiny!</p>

    <p>There was a saying...</p>

    <p><em>Meeting is a destiny which is too wonderful for words <sup>3</sup> </em><em>...</em></p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(This si derived from a common line in a particular TV program.)</dfn>

    <p>There were fewer and fewer people now. There were only forty-odd people left, but Daoist Guang still had eighteen people to kill.</p>

    <p>Many people were discussing this on the screen and sending all kinds of gloating bullet messages.</p>

    <p>This group of people had all bet that Daoist Guang wouldn't be able to kill twenty people; in their eyes, it was basically hopeless for him now. Their winnings might not be much, but in any case, it was a sure win. It was a discount on immortal elixirs! Live streaming platforms opened discount days every two months for viewers who wanted discounts when converting immortal elixirs into HNY.</p>

    <p>One million immortal elixirs was equal to eight hundred HNY, which actually wasn't much. But in the end, it was about the entertainment value: being happy was the most important thing.</p>

    <p>"Give up, live streamer, you've already lost!"</p>

    <p>"I don't think that little brother is coming back!"</p>

    <p>"If that little brother acting as bait is killed, it's an instant game over for the live streamer!"</p>

    <p>Many people stared at the top right corner of the screen in the game. The players in the current circle were more cautious and there would be fewer deaths. If the little brother died, his ID would appear in the top right corner of the public screen.</p>

    <p>"This little brother won't die, right..."</p>

    <p>"Who knows! But I feel 'getting a card to swim and get fit' this phrase isn't appealing at all!"</p>

    <p>For a while, many Light Chasers were anxious. They didn't understand how "Lord Island" could be so confident as he patiently kept watch. Given the current number of people, if he didn't go out and risk everything now, just killing ten people would be pretty good already, not to mention twenty!</p>

    <p>All the players were fighting... the game was in its final stage and the number of players was dwindling one at a time!</p>

    <p>What an annoying live streamer!</p>

    <p>After another thirty seconds or so, Daoist Guang and his water friends in the live stream room finally heard the little brother's familiar cry. "Lord Island! Lord Island! Here I come!"</p>

    <p>The little brother was jumping and running as bullets flew at him. He had already been hit!</p>

    <p>Through Daoist Guang's viewpoint, the water friends in the live stream could see Little Brother GAYLIGAYQI being chased by four people!</p>

    <p>There were cries of surprise in the bullet messages: <em>Oh my god! He really lured people over! This little brother is not bad!</em></p>

    <p>The little brother very quickly covered the distance back to the tower. He stayed low as he climbed the tower. When he was halfway up, he lay prone on the floor to heal himself.</p>

    <p>"How is it?" Daoist Guang moved his character to the little brother's side as reinforcement.</p>

    <p>"Residual Blood <sup>4</sup> ! My bulletproof vest is almost gone! But thankfully I'm not dead yet..." The little brother was sweating. After all, he had run through a hail of bullets from four people!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>4</sup>(Very low health.)</dfn>

    <p>"What about your helmet? Is it damaged?" Daoist Guang asked.</p>

    <p>The little brother examined his equipment. "No... It's intact."</p>

    <p>The water friends in the live stream could already no longer help ridiculing the situation...</p>

    <p>This was in the end a Fish Pond Round, and its level was really low!</p>

    <p>No wonder these four people chasing him couldn't kill him!</p>

    <p>It turned out that they were all bad players...</p>

    <p>"There's actually four people!" Daoist Guang had already determined earlier on how many people they were from their footsteps, and pretended to smile nervously in front of the screen.</p>

    <p>But his expression changed very quickly as he said coldly, "But they all have to die!"</p>

    <p>The first player was already charging at them. "The guy promoting swimming to keep fit! Come out! I know you're in the tower! What I hate the most are damn salesmen!"</p>

    <p>The player was about to rush upstairs with his rifle, but just as he approached the base of the tower, he saw a figure carrying a blade of light fall from the sky...</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang was too fast!</p>

    <p>This time, Lord Island didn't say anything unnecessary and just directly beheaded the player!</p>

    <p>This player didn't even have time to shout out as he straightaway turned into a box.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the kill notification had already appeared in the top right corner of the public screen.</p>

    <p><em>Player "LORD ISLAND" has used "Katana" to kill player "HaroRunDeKuai" with a headshot.</em></p>

    <p>Three kills...</p>
