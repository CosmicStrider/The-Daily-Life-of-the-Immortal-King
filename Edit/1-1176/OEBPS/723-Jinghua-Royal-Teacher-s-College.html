  <h1>Chapter 723 Jinghua Royal Teacher's College</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Li Mingyao and Zhou Youzheng were caught off guard by Wang Ming's Gag Authority Technique. They were from Songhai's four big families - usually, even the headmaster had to be respectful when he saw them, yet there was actually a teacher who dared to directly ban them?</p>

    <p>Li Mingyao and Zhou Youzheng felt that this was utterly inconceivable.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing was that this was still in the main group. After being banned, the two of them instantly felt that they had lost face - what would those in the group who knew their identities think of them?</p>

    <p>Instantly, Li Mingyao and Zhou Youzheng felt like they had been struck a further blow.</p>

    <p>Li Mingyao was stupefied. "I'm going to find our teacher and see if he can lift the ban."</p>

    <p>All the lead teachers had been set as administrators in this summer camp chat group. Li Mingyao thought this would work, and quickly started to type a message which he then sent to his lead teacher.</p>

    <p>In the end, the message directly turned into an exclamation mark, which was a sign that the other party hadn't received the message.</p>

    <p>System message: During the period of the ban, you have been put on a PM blacklist and are forbidden from chatting with anyone in the group. Time of ban remaining: 5 hours and 58 minutes...</p>

    <p>Li Mingyao and Zhou Youzheng: "???"</p>

    <p>Being banned also included being blacklisted?</p>

    <p>What the hell was with this operation??</p>

    <p>Wang Ming could already picture how discomfited those two young masters must be. He had just set up this secondary blacklist effect. Wang Ming had expected that given the characters of Li Mingyao and Zhou Youzheng these two young masters, they would definitely PM their lead teacher to lift the ban, so he had spent roughly thirty seconds rewriting the rules just now.</p>

    <p>Except for him and Wu Zhenjun, both of whom had the highest level of administrative authority, the rest of the administrators could only ban someone, but couldn't lift it. Moreover, once someone was banned, the system would blacklist them for the duration of the ban.</p>

    <p>It was just like Wang Ming to go the whole hog...</p>

    <p>The point was that it wasn't just Li Mingyao and Zhou Youzheng who were stunned stupid by this gag rule, the teachers from Remnant High were also shocked.</p>

    <p>Li Mingyao and Zhou Youzheng's lead teacher then directly looked for Wang Ming in a private chat. "Lao Gudong Xiaoer from Number 60 High? Why did you ban my students?"</p>

    <p>This teacher's name was Yuan Hua, who had graduated from Jinghua Royal Teacher's College. Before Wang Ming had confirmed his own participation in this summer camp, he had investigated all the teachers. This Teacher Yuan Hua's qualifications weren't simple. Moreover, among the lead teachers this time, the chief commander Wu Zhenjun was actually also a graduate from this Jinghua Royal Teacher's College.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, back when Wu Zhenjun and this Teacher Yuan Hua graduated, they were included on the list of most outstanding graduates of the last century. To this day, their photos still hung in the school's exhibition building on campus... Very few people were actually qualified to be regarded as the top graduates of the last century at Jinghua Royal Teacher's College.</p>

    <p>Including Teacher Yuan Hua and Wu Zhenjun, Jinghua Royal Teacher's College had awarded this title to only seven people.</p>

    <p>It was also because of this that these seven graduates were now known in the outside world as the "Royal Seven Scholars<sup>1</sup>"...</p>

    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A play on the "Royal Seven Warriors of the Sea" from the series "One Piece.")</dfn>

    <p>Bearing in mind the development of Number 60 High's future relationship with other schools, Wang Ming replied in as smooth a tone as possible to this lead teacher from Remnant High, "Teacher Yuan, your students started a rumor about my student. The fact that I only banned them for six hours is already a courtesy. Outside, those who spread rumors now are detained when the rumor has been forwarded over five hundred times, for at least seven to fifteen days. So many people in our group have already seen it, but I only banned them for six hours... This is already giving you and Remnant High face with this discount!"</p>

    <p>Teacher Yuan Hua was speechless. "..." What fucking discount!</p>

    <p>Yuan Hua took a deep breath and tried to keep calm. "Lao Gudong Xiaoer, you should know who these two students are, right?"</p>

    <p>"Yes," Wang Ming replied quickly. "They are the third young masters of the Li and Zhou families of the four big families of Songhai city. But the people I banned are Li Mingyao and Zhou Youzheng. What does that have to do with the third young masters?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Yuan Hua: "Lao Gudong Xiaoer, for the sake of the future relationship between our two schools, I think it would still be better for you to lift the ban. The Rainbow Glass Box is going to land at the base station soon. If this matter makes students in both schools unhappy, can you shoulder that responsibility?"</p>

    <p>When Wang Ming heard this, he had to say that Teacher Yuan Hua's words actually did make sense.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High was a key city high school candidate, while Remnant High was a famous key high school in a different district. Students in such key high schools had a strong sense of collective honor. While everyone had come on this summer camp to learn and in the name of joint progress, this process of learning and broadening their horizons was actually similar to an inter-school competition.</p>

    <p>And this perhaps was what Teacher Yuan Hua wanted to imply: What if the students from Remnant High didn't care about friendship in the competition and instead struck Number 60 High a heavy blow...?</p>

    <p>Seeing that Wang Ming hadn't replied for a long while, Yuan Hua was a little impatient. "Lao Gudong Xiaoer, what do you think?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming typed his reply: "Let me think about it."</p>

    <p>About two minutes later...</p>

    <p>Another system message popped up.</p>

    <p>System message: User "Yuan Hua" is banned for 6 hours.</p>

    <p>Yuan Hua: "???"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>As a graduate of Jinghua Royal Teacher's College and a special-grade teacher who had a reputation as one of the "Royal Seven Scholars," Yuan Hua was very popular in Remnant High. When he was banned, a lot of the students instantly voiced their discontent, not to mention the other bewildered teachers from Remnant High.</p>

    <p>A Remnant High student directly asked in the group, "Why did you ban Teacher Yuan Hua?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming wasn't in a hurry to reply, and instead sent screenshots of his chat with Teacher Yuan Hua. "Teacher Yuan wanted to have a private chat with me, but we are both cultured people. How can we scrape and bow to nobility?"</p>

    <p>But the Remnant High student didn't buy it. "I don't believe it! This image was definitely photoshopped. Teacher Yuan is so cultured, there's no way he can do such a thing! How can a teacher from Number 60 High dirty someone else's name like this?!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming chuckled and swiftly replied, "If silence is golden, can a speaking ban on a cultured person be considered a ban?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>The student who had challenged Wang Ming flushed, but couldn't help denouncing him. "You think you're so hot just because you have authority?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "Sorry. It's because I have authority that I can do whatever I want."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, the banned Teacher Yuan Hua was depressed.</p>

    <p>He was online friends with Wu Zhenjun to begin with, so it wasn't considered a PM when he messaged the latter, nor was he pulled into the PM blacklist which Wang Ming had set up.</p>

    <p>"Wu Zhenjun, hasn't this Lao Gudong Xiaoer gone a little too far?" Teacher Yuan couldn't help complaining.</p>

    <p>"Should apologize."</p>

    <p>Wu Zhenjun replied after quite a while.</p>

    <p>"That's right, that's right, he should apologize!"</p>

    <p>"I mean, you should take those two students who were banned to apologize to him."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
