  <h1>Chapter 1059 Do You Think Wang Ling Is a Sis-Con?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Tian Gang Infinite Health Array.</p>

    <p>This was a branch of the Great Infinite Health Spell, which was one of the thirty thousand Heavenly Dao that Wang Ling had mastered.</p>

    <p>Combined with the Great Array Spell, you could get an instant spell and array combo effect. It was also this Great Array Spell which endowed the runes in Wang Ling's palm with something like spiritual consciousness the moment Wang Ling brought his hand down, as they swiftly sketched out the array Wang Ling wanted to set up.</p>

    <p>After that, Wang Ling just need to press his palm, and the array would be complete!</p>

    <p>Shadow Brute was a manifestation of Fate Dao and was extremely difficult to deal with. Warden Liang was very strong, but he still wasn't Shadow Brute's match when it came to genuine fighting strength. However, Wang Ling also knew full well that as an embodiment of Fate Dao, Shadow Brute didn't have tough endurance; once its strength was exhausted, it would have to go back to replenish its energy, which was similar to recharging a battery.</p>

    <p>It was precisely because of this that Wang Ling was able to instantly grab hold of its weakness.</p>

    <p>The prison had so many combat officers. Using a clone technique to help them one by one would be too eye-catching, so Wang Ling decided he might as well use the Great Infinite Health Spell and create an opportunity.</p>

    <p>No other Heavenly Dao could compete with the Great Infinite Health Spell when it came to durability. According to the rules, the consumption of spiritual energy would increase with every second the Heavenly Dao was used. However, Wang Ling's primordial qi could be described as infinite. When all was said and done, there were few monsters like Wang Ling in this world who could ignore this consumption...</p>

    <p>"No need to panic, everyone! Director Zhuo must have foreseen this situation, so he set up the array beforehand! Our health is infinite right now, and we won't feel any pain! Let's take this opportunity to arrest all these intruders!" At Warden Liang's bellow, the prison combat officers instantly regained their fighting spirit!</p>

    <p>In the air, Wang Ling gazed at Bai Youquan's figure in the distance. He was using Zhuo Yi's body this time, so he didn't have to worry about who would carry this wok for him. Plus, this was beneficial for Zhuo Yi himself.</p>

    <p>During this period when he was being possessed by Wang Ling, Zhuo Yi could actually learn a lot of battle skills, such as the angle of Wang Ling's slap... This was also something that Zhuo Yi would be able to experience up close during this time, since Zhuo Yi normally couldn't even see Wang Ling's movements clearly.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was naturally overwhelmed by this sort of beneficial hands-on learning; he never thought that there would be a day when his own body would be able to cast such a powerful Heavenly Dao spell!</p>

    <p>"This Zhuo Yi... is stronger than reported in the news?" Bai Youquan looked shocked after Zhuo Yi's sudden appearance. He had investigated Zhuo Yi before, and this person was most assuredly at the Golden Core level - logically speaking, there was no way he could use such a powerful Heavenly Dao spell.</p>

    <p>But if Zhuo Yi really was that strong, then this attack wasn't a loss - it at least made them aware of a potentially powerful enemy.</p>

    <p>Why not feel out Zhuo Yi? See exactly how amazing he was?</p>

    <p>Coming up with this bold idea, Bai Youquan was instantly excited.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was controlling Zhuo Yi's body, and while he was a little unaccustomed to it at first because of the slipped disc, he was now completely used to the body's configuration after breaking it in for a bit.</p>

    <p>It was far more inferior to his own body, but in any case, it was his disciple's body, and not as bad as Wang Ling had imagined.</p>

    <p>"King's Eye..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling swiped his sword fingers over his pupils. His left eye instantly turned fiery red like a blaze and the pupil unfolded into a golden three-petaled flower.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was worried that Zhuo Yi's body wouldn't be able to withstand the full visual power of the King's Eye, so he only used half of it. However, even half was powerful enough.</p>

    <p><em>Chi!</em></p>

    <p>Wang Ling turned into a streak of golden light in the sky, which lunged at Bai Youquan. The air rolled with this immense destructive power, creating friction and gouging out a deep trough in the ground in Wang Ling's wake.</p>

    <p>Alarmed by this powerful destructive force, Bai Youquan's heart jumped, but he clearly wasn't any ordinary person. The moment Wang Ling's body pierced him, Bai Youquan had completed turned into shadow and his body became transparent.</p>

    <p>Was this the power of shadow again...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was now one hundred percent sure that this new black soldier army had to be intricately linked to Wang Nuan, his unborn little sister. In the Palace of Mirrors, this gang had retreated so cleanly that they hadn't left any traces behind at all. Now that Wang Ling thought about it, it was precisely during that time that Mother Wang had become pregnant with Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>Were there really such coincidences in this world?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was aware of how serious this matter was.</p>

    <p>They actually had the nerve to plot against Ah Nuan...</p>

    <p>These people were really too bold.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't want to be a sis-con, but as a big brother, it was his duty to protect his little sister.</p>

    <p>Bai Youquan...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had to catch this person, and then follow the trail back to uncover the mastermind behind everything!</p>

    <p>He remembered that Wang Ming had mentioned a dream of his before, in which an impostor with Wang Ling's face was running everything behind the scenes. Not only did this imposter revive President Bai and Devil Gut Fungus Lord, he even gave this Bai Youquan, President Bai's son, an important position.</p>

    <p>It was just that Wang Ling never expected this impostor's true target to be Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>"You can't hurt me." In shadow mode, Bai Youquan was completely immune to physical attacks. Wang Ling's deadly charge just now had been fierce, but hadn't hit Bai Youquan.</p>

    <p>In the face of Bai Youquan's arrogance, Wang Ling only had three words: "You missed something..."</p>

    <p>When Bai Youquan came back to his senses, he was astonished to realize that at some point, his soul had been marked! The physical attack just now had been a feint - it was his soul that Wang Ling had been aiming for from the very beginning!</p>

    <p>King's Eye Soul Lock!</p>

    <p>As long as Wang Ling willed it, a person whose soul had been locked down would be instantly recalled and detained, even if they fled to the ends of the earth.</p>

    <p>Even the Old Devil and Evil Sword God hadn't received this sort of treatment back then...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was too afraid that the other party would just run away. If he escaped this time, who knew how long Wang Ling would have to wait for the next opportunity.</p>

    <p>Rather than do the investigation himself, Wang Ling much preferred this, with the other party cockily dropping by to court death.</p>

    <p>Bai Youquan had thought too highly of his strength.</p>

    <p>At that moment, he saw this terrifying Director of the General Administration of 100 Schools walk over to him step by step...</p>

    <p>"Kneel."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at Bai Youquan. His expression wasn't the least bit friendly, and his words were unquestionable. There wasn't any room for discussion in his tone; this was a nomological law of Heavenly Dao that was similar to a decree â€” Word Magic! With just one word, Bai Youquan's knees already couldn't withstand the pressure, and they bent completely and hit the ground hard.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>A little survey: Do you think Wang Ling is a sis-con?</p>

    <p>1: Yes (please reply: 1)</p>

    <p>2: No (please reply: 2)</p>
