  <h1>Chapter 798 A New Investor</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After Wang Zhen passed out, Wang Ling cast the Great Teleportation Spell to instantly transport Lord Diulei and Wang Zhen to Chrysanthemum Island where Immortal Toya was.</p>

    <p>In the process of trying to solve the problem of the coma which the kun belly girl was in, Immortal Toya had made new breakthroughs in his research of hard-to-treat cases. He developed many new drugs, and while they didn't work for the girl, they were surprisingly effective on other vegetative patients.</p>

    <p>Supposedly, quite a number of patients who had been in comas for over a hundred years miraculously woke up recently...</p>

    <p>Now, express couriers came to Immortal Toya's island almost every day to deliver silk banners from all over the place.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei, Wang Ling and Wang Zhen landed directly in the alchemy room, where Immortal Toya refined pills. The kun belly girl was dressed in a snow-white hospital gown which Cailian Zhenren had changed her into at Immortal Toya's request.</p>

    <p>The gown was made of a special material that could automatically clean her skin so that she didn't need to bathe even when she was unconscious. Additionally, the gown material was very thin, so acupuncture needles could still be used on her even with her clothes on.</p>

    <p>"Brother To, where are Jin Shi and Yin Shi?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei asked the question as soon as they landed.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei had texted to say they were coming, so Immortal Toya wasn't startled at all. He responded with a smile, "Jin Shi and Yin Shi are outside receiving deliveries. It's probably more silk banners today."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Where's the patient? Let me take a look."</p>

    <p>Saying that, Immortal Toya washed his hands and looked at Wang Zhen.</p>

    <p>He wriggled his fingers at a distance, and Wang Zhen's eyelids were pulled up by a small gravitational force. After checking Wang Zhen's pupils, Immortal Toya felt his pulse and examined Wang Zhen's internal condition.</p>

    <p>"Brother To, how is he?"</p>

    <p>"It should be a coma brought on by sudden shock, but it's nothing compared with the kun belly girl's symptoms. This gentleman is so strong that even if I don't prescribe him anything, he'll be able to recover himself... Actually, there are times when this is usually caused by psychological factors. How long it will take him to wake up depends entirely on the extent of this man's psychological trauma."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Of course, we can still use medicine. I'll prepare some later and give this gentleman an IV. It might not be long before he wakes up," Immortal Toya said.</p>

    <p>"That's good."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei nodded.</p>

    <p>"In any case, Senior Immortal, what was it that scared this man to this extent?"</p>

    <p>"He's an investment client. We initially arranged to meet today, and I wanted Brother Ling to check him out for me, but I didn't think he would probe Brother Ling spiritually as soon as he arrived. When it was over, Brother Ling had frightened him to this extent..." Lord Diulei sighed a little glumly.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Frightened by Ling Zhenren to this point?" Immortal Toya frowned deeply. "Ling Zhenren is such an affable person, how can he scare anyone to this extent... I think it's better for Senior Immortal to be careful. This gentleman is most likely up to no good. Maybe he didn't come to invest at all, and this so-called investment is just an excuse..."</p>

    <p>"Thank you for the reminder, Brother To, I will be very careful from now on." Lord Diulei said, "Actually, while we were waiting at Midnight Dining Hall, Brother Daoist Guang did give me a referral for a reliable investor; I heard it was a recommendation from his number one fan. Brother Guang pulled some strings and built a wonderful bridge for us."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Number one fan...</p>

    <p>This number one fan was without doubt Father Wang.</p>

    <p>Father Wang had been obsessed with Daoist Guang's live stream recently. Since Daoist Guang's online game, Father Wang had watched the live stream almost every day, and he was far in front on the fan list in terms of contributions, his ID still that "Has Three Days And Two Sleeps Been Updated."</p>

    <p>In other words, Father Wang helped recommend an investor?</p>

    <p>Who on earth could it be?</p>

    <p>"What kind of investor?" Immortal Toya asked.</p>

    <p>"We still don't know exactly who it is, and we'll only find out when we meet later. The other party's representative has already arranged to meet us tonight. If Brother Ling and I leave now, we'll make it just in time," Lord Diulei said.</p>

    <p>"In that case, let me congratulate Senior Immortal on your success in advance." Immortal Toya smiled. "But before the two of you leave, I hope that you'll be able to help cast a restraining spell on this gentleman. He's very powerful - if he's alarmed when he wakes up and does something to wreck my Chrysanthemum Island, it's not worth it... I'll let Senior Immortal and Zhenren know immediately once this gentleman wakes up."</p>

    <p>"Mm."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded - restraining Wang Zhen should be a given.</p>

    <p>Given Wang Zhen's strength... Wang Ling reckoned that even a thousand Immortal Toyas would still fall far short of one- or two-tenths of Wang Zhen's battle strength.</p>

    <p>This was a very strong opponent.</p>

    <p>Thus, Wang Ling raised his hand and didn't hold back as he cast suppression spells on Wang Zhen, directly casting the "Great Imprisonment Spell,""Great Prohibition of Magic Spell,""Great Spirit-Sealing Spell,""Great Suppression Spell,""Great Gravity Spell"... It was a total of more than thirty Heavenly Dao to suppress Wang Zhen in every way. If Wang Ling didn't remove these spells, Wang Zhen would in fact be no different from a vegetative patient.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>That evening, after the failed negotiation that afternoon, Lord Diulei and Wang Ling returned to Midnight Dining Hall.</p>

    <p>This second investor, whom Daoist Guang and his number one fan had both recommended as a reliable one, had arranged to meet at seven o'clock.</p>

    <p>It was now less than five minutes to seven.</p>

    <p>Since this was someone introduced by Father Wang, Wang Ling wasn't sure if this person had seen him before, so he made simple changes to his appearance with the Great Transfiguration Spell.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling always did things cautiously, so Lord Diulei understood and didn't ask questions when he saw what Wang Ling had done.</p>

    <p>A few minutes later, a figure appeared at the door to the shop. After pushing the door open, the man bowed deeply to Lord Diulei and Wang Ling inside. "Hello, I am the person in charge of this investment negotiation. You can call me Mai Yuqiang or Ah Mai."</p>

    <p>"Brother Ah Mai, please sit." Lord Diulei hurriedly got up.</p>

    <p>Seeing this, Tan Qian promptly turned around to go prepare some food.</p>

    <p>"There's no need to be so polite, I'm only following orders." This gentleman called Ah Mai smiled. "Senior Immortal can rest assured regarding this investment. Our superiors have decided to give the construction of Senior Immortal's sect their full support."</p>

    <p>"You don't need to look at the site location?" Lord Diulei was stunned. Was this already a done deal?</p>

    <p>"The higher-ups are very comfortable with leaving the running of sect operations to Senior Immortal. We'll just be responsible for sending the money - oh, no, responsible for the investment..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"May I ask, who are Brother Ah Mai's superiors?"</p>

    <p>"The Huaxiu Alliance of Cultivators, also known as: Huaxiu Alliance."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"The head of state will take the lead in this investment plan, and the Ten Generals will each invest a portion. The total investment amount is two billion immortal gold."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei and Wang Ling: "..."</p>
