  <h1>Chapter 825 Being a Pretentious Prick Is a Profound Area of Learning</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This was the second time that Lord Diulei was being possessed by a big shot. Although it felt slightly uncomfortable on the whole, which was a reaction to the body and soul rejecting each other, Lord Diulei could basically still tolerate it. There was a limit to how long a possession lasted, like holding your breath in water. Once it reached the limit, the soul and flesh would separate on their own.</p>

    <p>Usually, the longest time a body could be possessed for was five minutes.</p>

    <p>It was very different from Ultimate King of Killers borrowing a body, which was an advanced type of possession that wasn't constrained by time.</p>

    <p>But five minutes or not made no difference to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>In any case, he didn't need even three minutes to settle this fight...</p>

    <p>After successfully possessing Lord Diulei's body, he tore open the space to step onto the battlefield, and saw sword light as bright as the sun come slicing down. Thick with domineering intent, it carried boundless, majestic pressure, and was hard to look at directly.</p>

    <p>In this world, only the fastest martial arts were unstoppable. This sword move, which carried the profound truth of Boundless Sword Dao, was even more so; all evil would be spooked out of their minds by this sword.</p>

    <p>Although his body was under Wang Ling's control, Lord Diulei could clearly see what was going on. This was a battle between True Immortals. If it wasn't for Wang Ling controlling his body now, there was no way he would be able to stand, given his Soul Formation stage.</p>

    <p>What kind of powerful move was this...</p>

    <p>The scene was even more stunning than when he fought Evil Sword God.</p>

    <p>Because back when he fought Evil Sword God, it had been a pure, crushing defeat.</p>

    <p>But this was a duel between Blademaster and Battle Saint right now.</p>

    <p>While it was King of Killers who had forced this confrontation, it was still utterly mind-blowing.</p>

    <p>In the face of this torrent of Boundless Sword intent, Marshal Jiang frowned and responded almost instantly.</p>

    <p>Sticking both his thumbs into his mouth, he bit hard, and his arms suddenly and instantly swelled up in the next moment to several hundred times their normal size. They looked like godly iron from heaven, as even the skin turned a deep, glossy black.</p>

    <p>Marshal Jiang brought his arms down and crossed them in front of him. When the Boundless Sword Dao intent crashed into these enhanced arms, it gave a deep ringing sound of godly iron colliding.</p>

    <p>The ground cracked, and the collision between Boundless Sword intent and Marshal Jiang's arms exploded with boiling hot energy which instantly scorched and melted the earth, turning it into burning lava.</p>

    <p>With no ground to stand on, Marshal Jiang could only fight in the air.</p>

    <p>And this was the most dangerous moment!</p>

    <p>Anything in General Yi's intrinsic spirit field could be turned into sword intent!</p>

    <p>'Battle Saint, you're trapped..." King of Killers smiled slightly as he manipulated the Boundless Sword Dao intent in General Yi's body. With just a crook of his finger, the blazing lava on the ground instantly turned into thousands of fire swords that lunged at Marshal Jiang.</p>

    <p>King of Killers didn't hold back at all. This was a move meant to directly kill Marshal Jiang on the spot.</p>

    <p>Marshal Jiang had obviously sensed how merciless Ultimate King of Killers was.</p>

    <p>Hampered by the fact that Ultimate King of Killers was using Blademaster's body, Marshal Jiang had been forced to take a defensive position since the beginning since he didn't dare attack too fiercely. Now, however, he could feel that there was something odd about this possession technique.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if he was mistaken, but he felt that after Blademaster was possessed, the latter seemed to be exerting more power than usual...</p>

    <p>Of the Ten Generals, he had fought Blademaster the most, so it should be said that he was well acquainted with Blademaster's condition.</p>

    <p>At that moment, thousands of fire swords lunged at Marshal Jiang, each one aimed at his heart.</p>

    <p>Marshal Jiang swung his godly arms to block them, but these fire swords were too agile!</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, you can act now!" Lord Diulei urged Wang Ling. The situation was just too dangerous for Marshal Jiang now.</p>

    <p>"Mm."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling just replied softly.</p>

    <p>He took one step forward, and it directly boomed like thunder. Several lightning bolts immediately shattered the thousands of fire swords, and both Marshal Jiang and King of Killers couldn't help turning to look in the direction of the sound of thunder.</p>

    <p>It wasn't just Marshal Jiang, but even Ultimate King of Killers was utterly flabbergasted.</p>

    <p>Because they hadn't sensed another person entering the intrinsic spirit field.</p>

    <p>"Senior Immortal, when... when did you come in?"</p>

    <p>"Not long ago." Lord Diulei opened his mouth.</p>

    <p>In fact, it was Wang Ling who was speaking and now in control of the body... But it was still Lord Diulei's voice, so Marshal Jiang and Ultimate King of Killers didn't suspect anything.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had never been fond of speaking, but considering that he was pretending to be Lord Diulei and had possessed his body, he had to be a pretentious prick in the latter's place... what needed to be acted out should be acted out, otherwise how good could the result be?</p>

    <p>Marshal Jiang and Ultimate King of Killers clearly froze on the spot at his words.</p>

    <p>Not long ago...</p>

    <p>They actually hadn't noticed at all!</p>

    <p>And the most important thing was that this Lord Diulei had only entered the intrinsic spirit field after Marshal Jiang was dragged in. How was this possible?</p>

    <p>"Senior Immortal, how did you get in?" Marshal Jiang was utterly astonished.</p>

    <p>"Is it very hard, tearing the space open by hand?" Manipulating Lord Diulei's body, Wang Ling cocked his head slightly.</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Ultimate King of Killers and Marshal Jiang sucked in cold breaths of air.</p>

    <p>Tearing the space open by hand...</p>

    <p>Easier said than done!</p>

    <p>The technique involved was incredibly difficult, and the space he tore open wasn't any ordinary space. A True Immortal could typically tear space open to travel through it.</p>

    <p>But tearing open space and passing through various spatial layers wasn't the same - it was a completely different level of difficulty!</p>

    <p>"It's hot." Lord Diulei looked down at the ground.</p>

    <p>The collision between two True Immortals had turned the ground in the intrinsic spirit field into lava, and he really did feel a little hot.</p>

    <p>"You must be hot, too." Lord Diulei gazed at Marshal Jiang next to him.</p>

    <p>Marshal Jiang nodded. "A little... But a True Immortal can tolerate very high temperatures. I'm sweating, but not to the point that I feel like I'm boiling."</p>

    <p>"Since it's hot, then don't go so wild. Wouldn't it be better to be more zen when you fight?" Wang Ling did his best to speak the way Lord Diulei usually did to avoid arousing suspicion.</p>

    <p>Marshal Jiang was a little dazed by this question. "Senior Immortal is right..."</p>

    <p>"You were fighting for so long, but nothing happened, so I came in to take a look."</p>

    <p>"... Anyway, I have to thank Senior Immortal. Your arrival was a huge help! We can attack together. Senior Immortal, you just need to suppress Old Yi's body; leave the rest to me."</p>

    <p>"Too troublesome."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei shook his head.</p>

    <p>Marshal Jiang: "Then Senior Immortal's meaning is..."</p>

    <p>At that moment, Lord Diulei gazed at the ground, and gave a soft sigh.</p>

    <p>It was just a sigh, but the lava on the ground actually froze in a flash!</p>

    <p>While Marshal Jiang and King of Killers were still in a daze, Lord Diulei's body at some point was already in front of King of Killers. "Hey, what are you looking at?"</p>

    <p>This speed was really too fast...</p>

    <p>Before King of Killers could come back to his senses, Lord Diulei flicked his forehead.</p>

    <p><em>Pa!</em></p>

    <p>With a crisp sound, General Yi's body was sent flying like a shooting star through several massive mountains.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was in his own body as he allowed Wang Ling to control it at will, and he felt that he had learned something new...</p>

    <p>It turned out that being a pretentious prick was also a huge field of learning!</p>

    <p>He definitely wouldn't have known this if he had gone into battle himself!</p>

    <p>As expected of his dearest Brother Ling!</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, you're too cool!" Inside his body, Lord Diulei showered Wang Ling with endless cheers. "Please use my body as much as you like, Brother Ling! Don't be gentle with me just because I'm a broccoli!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
