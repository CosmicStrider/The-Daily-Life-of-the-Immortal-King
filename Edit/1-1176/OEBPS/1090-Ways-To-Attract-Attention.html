  <h1>Chapter 1090 Ways To Attract Attention</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At lunch time, Wang Ling experienced what it was like to walk unimpeded into the canteen for the first time, as most of the boys had taken advantage of the lunch break to consult Xia Ming on relationship issues; there were thus less students in the canteen for food.</p>

    <p>With less people to feed, the hands of the aunties who ladled out the food in the canteen were steady, and they just hoped that the students who did come for lunch would eat a little more. Otherwise, the leftovers would be collected into slop buckets and sent to the dragon pig breeders. The most horrific thing was that after the dragon pigs were grown and sold in the market, Zhai Yin would just turn them into poisonous pork chops again! It was truly a waste!</p>

    <p>"All of you are still growing; how can you not eat?" Mother Juan asked a student why there were so few students in the canteen. Untying her apron, she went to look for Xia Ming and to drag people back to eat.</p>

    <p>Five or six minutes later, a student who had obediently come for lunch before he was able to seek advice from Xia Ming said that Mother Juan had also fallen...</p>

    <p>Everyone was petrified. "So Mother Juan actually still isn't married?"</p>

    <p>A person in the know replied, "She was... but her old man didn't live long."</p>

    <p>"Because of her black cuisine?"</p>

    <p>"I heard it wasn't that - he was just in poor health, and didn't live long."</p>

    <p>"..." Everyone was speechless.</p>

    <p>Mother Juan looked like someone who brought her husband bad luck<sup>1</sup>...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Based on the traditional practice of reading one's fate from one's appearance.)</dfn>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling picked up a plate, and the old auntie who ladled out the food filled it with meat. Today's lunch was tomato with fried egg, braised meatballs in brown sauce, braised pork, stir-fried vegetables, and pork rib soup with white gourd.</p>

    <p>Every time he saw braised meatballs in brown sauce or braised pork, Wang Ling had a habit of asking the auntie to pour some sauce on the rice to make it more delicious.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling, you eat so much every time, but why don't you put on weight?" Chen Chao was green with envy; he was a gym freak who also liked to eat meat, but he had to control his food intake. Otherwise, he would lose the figure he had so painstakingly cultivated and get fat again without knowing it. Boys like Chen Chao who cared especially about muscles usually paid attention to their body fat percentage.</p>

    <p>So far, Chen Chao's body fat percentage was at a good level of 11%.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling picked up a meatball with his chopsticks and put it in his mouth.</p>

    <p>It was impossible to not gain weight after eating too much, but Wang Ling could rub it off; every time he put on weight, he would rub a little. Furthermore, this fat he rubbed off wasn't completely useless.</p>

    <p>This was flesh which had been rubbed off Wang Ling's body; he stored this extra flesh inside his King's Eye space with the thought that if he got hurt some day, he could use it to fill his injury in an emergency.</p>

    <p>But most unfortunately, there was not a single living creature in the universe so far that could hurt Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>After surveying the fat that had been stored in the King's Eye space all these years, Wang Ling estimated that it weighed two hundred or so kilos, which was about as heavy as a pig...</p>

    <p>During lunch, he saw Liu Qingyi and Wang Zhen eating at a table not far away, and it was quite a harmonious scene. From hearsay, the two of them quarreled practically every day at Wei Shi's place, and only quieted down at school because Wang Ling was there.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Gu Shunzhi and Zhenyuan picked at their food as they sat at the table next to Wang Ling. They actually wanted to sit at the same table, but it was first come first served.</p>

    <p>Blame Wang Ling for being more popular than they had imagined. Wherever he sat, Chen Chao, Guo Hao, Su Xiao and Fang Xing would basically follow and sit with him.</p>

    <p>Today, three of the four had lunch with Wang Ling; it seemed that Su Xiao had gone to consult Xia Ming about love.</p>

    <p>Halfway through the meal, Guo Hao suddenly started to gossip. "Wang Ling, are you really ok?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "???"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "If Sun Rong really starts to like Xia Ming because of this, don't you have a lot to lose? She only has a good opinion of him at most right now. If you give it a shot now, you might still have a chance to win back her heart!"</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling silently chewed the braised meat in his mouth.</p>

    <p>If Xia Ming and Sun Rong became a couple in the end, he naturally wouldn't mind... That way, Sun Rong would shift all her attention from Wang Ling to Xia Ming.</p>

    <p>To Wang Ling, Sun Rong was actually an outstanding young lady, but it was precisely because she was too remarkable and eye-catching that Wang Ling often felt uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>Feelings couldn't be forced - everyone was free to choose who they liked.</p>

    <p>Of course, everyone was also free to be liked by others.</p>

    <p>"Does anybody want meat? If you want it, help yourself." Chen Chao had a few mouthfuls, and there was a lot left on his plate, since he still had to control his food intake today.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao wasn't polite at all, and finished off all the meat on Chen Chao's plate.</p>

    <p>"Why aren't you eating?" After taking Chen Chao's meat, Guo Hao glanced at Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao realized that after Wang Ling, the most indecipherable person in Number 60 High was this Fang Xing from Class Two - he was a rather strange guy.</p>

    <p>"No need - listening to your gossip made me full." Fang Xing crossed his fingers together and narrowed his eyes slightly as he smiled.</p>

    <p>If Sun Rong and Xia Ming ended up together, he would raise both his hands and support them!</p>

    <p>But as Wang Ling ate, he somehow felt that there was something wrong with the way things had turned out.</p>

    <p>He recalled the conclusion that had come out of Chen Chao's blessed mouth regarding the relationship between Sun Rong and Xia Ming: At most, it was just a good impression, and wasn't necessarily "like."</p>

    <p>The key point was: It wasn't necessarily "like"...</p>

    <p>That was to say, Sun Rong may not necessarily like Xia Ming.</p>

    <p>This blessed mouth hadn't come up with an official, final conclusion!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling suddenly felt that things had become messy...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>That afternoon, the female protagonist finally appeared.</p>

    <p>All of Number 60 High was stirred up once again.</p>

    <p>After wrestling fiercely with her thoughts all night, Sun Rong finally decided to face her heart.</p>

    <p>After class in the afternoon, a bunch of people practically pushed Xia Ming toward Grade One, Class Three to face Sun Rong. There were students inside the class as well as students from other classes who packed the corridor, and the two of them flushed as they faced each other.</p>

    <p>"Good luck, Master Xia Ming!"</p>

    <p>"Support Xia Ming, get Sun Rong!"</p>

    <p>The students caused a racket in the corridor.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sat in one corner of the classroom, quietly eating a melon.</p>

    <p>He was genuinely eating a melon<sup>2</sup>.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(As opposed to the "melon-eating" masses, i.e. onlookers.)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling had a habit of eating fruits after a meal. Today's fruit was watermelon, which Mother Wang had put in a lunchbox and given to him that morning. When he took it out, he cast a Freeze Spell and was instantly able to eat iced watermelon.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Sun Rong..."</p>

    <p>"Classmate Xia Ming..."</p>

    <p>At that moment, Xia Ming and Sun Rong spoke at the same time.</p>

    <p>Everyone's gazes started to drift between the two.</p>

    <p>"You first!"</p>

    <p>"You first!"</p>

    <p>They spoke at the same time yet again!</p>

    <p>Everyone yelled inwardly that this was probably going to be a good show... They were so compatible! They even spoke to the same beat!</p>

    <p>"Then, I'll go first," Sun Rong said slowly, after sorting out her thoughts.</p>

    <p>Xia Ming's legs almost gave out when he heard Sun Rong's words; no girl had ever confessed to him before. If Sun Rong really did confess to him and this was a dream, he would still wake up laughing!</p>

    <p>"Classmate Sun Rong, go ahead." Xia Ming took a deep breath in that moment, and was already prepared to be confessed to.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong looked at Xia Ming, a smile in her eyes. "Xia Ming, what you did yesterday... you were actually trying to catch my attention with this unique approach, right... Actually, I'm not angry."</p>

    <p>Xia Ming: "I know..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong smiled. "So you don't have to apologize to me. In fact, it's all thanks to you, Classmate Xia Ming, that I was inspired!"</p>

    <p>Xia Ming was startled. "Ah?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong took a deep breath to calm down.</p>

    <p>To be honest, Xia Ming's novel confession yesterday had indeed inspired Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>She had been trying to get a person's attention all this time...</p>

    <p>But that person had always ignored her.</p>

    <p>After wrestling with her thoughts for a night and a morning, Sun Rong was finally enlightened by Xia Ming's confession method.</p>

    <p>With so many people watching, if she loudly declared in front of everyone that she hated Wang Ling, would that attract Wang Ling's attention?</p>

    <p>She had already prepared her lines, most of which were copied from what Xia Ming said yesterday.</p>

    <p>The lines were: Classmate Wang Ling! I hate you! I hate you the most! I beg you, don't appear in front of me again!</p>

    <p>At that thought, Sun Rong thus turned her gaze on Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's loud confession resounded at the scene: "Classmate Wang Ling! I like you! I like you the most! I beg you, always stay by my side!"</p>

    <p>In that moment, everyone's hearts were shaken!</p>

    <p>Everyone: "???"</p>

    <p>What the hell? Wasn't she going to confess to Xia Ming? Why had she confessed to Wang Ling?</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "???"</p>

    <p>What the hell? Shouldn't she say that she hated Wang Ling? Why did the words in her heart and what she actually said change again...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "???"</p>

    <p>What the hell? Wasn't this the Single's Curse? Why did she suddenly confess to him?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was so frightened that he immediately spat out a mouthful of watermelon juice, and he even dropped the fork which he was using.</p>
