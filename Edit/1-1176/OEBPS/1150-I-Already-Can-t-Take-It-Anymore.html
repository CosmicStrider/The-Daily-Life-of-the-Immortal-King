  <h1>Chapter 1150 I Already Can't Take It Anymore</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When the headmasters of Number 8 West City High and Purple Garden High School saw everyone from Number 60 High pull out their spirit swords and launch a surprise attack on the students from both schools, they flew into a rage.</p>

    <p>"Chen Tianxiang! You - you're shameless! You actually had your students bring in spirit swords! Smuggling in personal items... I've never seen such a shameless person!"</p>

    <p>"President Qi, I think that Number 60 High should be disqualified at once! This isn't in line with the rules of the body technique competition at all! It's unfair!" Headmaster Zi Yan from Purple Garden High School frowned deeply as she expressed her dissatisfaction.</p>

    <p>The two headmasters got up in protest, but President Qi just shook his head. "It is truly rare for students to be able to cultivate a spirit sword space at the Foundation Establishment stage. Since Number 60 High was able to pass the inspection round undetected, this can't be considered a violation of the rules.</p>

    <p>"While the battle this time is focused on the exchange of physical techniques, students still need to observe the situation and adapt accordingly when it comes to survival. As long as their actions make sense when using magic or even collecting supplies, this can't be seen as violating the rules."</p>

    <p>President Qi made himself very clear with his words.</p>

    <p>To observe the situation and adapt accordingly...</p>

    <p>Simply put, as long as you passed the anti-cheat inspection at the very beginning, no one could say anything even if you took out some heaven-defying, earth-shattering magic treasure during the competition.</p>

    <p>Although it was a body technique competition, it was, in the end, a battle for survival; in this sort of situation, those who were too naive wouldn't survive...</p>

    <p>A number of the headmasters present approved of President Qi's words.</p>

    <p>"That's right! What President Qi said is right!"</p>

    <p>"I also agree with President Qi's opinion! To be able to bring weapons in is a testament to their skills! We can't say it's unfair!"</p>

    <p>Headmaster Zi Yan's lips twitched at these words.</p>

    <p>When all was said and done, she and the headmaster of West City Middle School had been a little too naive... Seeing how this lot was agreeing with President Qi, anyone could tell that they had also thought of ways for their students to bring in personal items.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, why would they be so vocal in their support?</p>

    <p>Both schools thus could only accept their bad luck.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, not all their students were lost during this surprise attack. Of the twenty students in total from Number 8 West City High and Purple Garden High School, four ultimately escaped.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High didn't pursue them either.</p>

    <p>Since it was the first day, there was no need to directly eliminate them all, and it was better to leave them some dignity.</p>

    <p>Besides, only four people remained from both schools; they were pretty much done for. Even if they didn't act, they might not necessarily be able to survive the next seven days.</p>

    <p>Although Number 60 High won this battle, they didn't feel like they had done anything, mainly because the two schools had already been worn down by their fight earlier. Number 60 High had chosen the perfect moment to launch a surprise attack, which practically sealed their victory.</p>

    <p>Moreover, Wang Ling had only coasted along throughout the whole thing, and felt that he had done even less. He very carefully evaded all attacks in order to prevent the force of the backlash rebounding on these students.</p>

    <p>The life-saving function of the protective golden light was useless; Wang Ling's backlash was so powerful that even when restricted, the rebound was still over a hundred times stronger.</p>

    <p>In other words, if someone punched Wang Ling, the force of the backlash would completely trigger the protective golden talisman into activating the shield, only to directly shatter it.</p>

    <p>It was so hard for Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>Not only couldn't he hit someone directly, he still had to evade their attacks, so from beginning to end, Wang Ling couldn't launch any attacks himself; instead, he gave the impression that he was riding everyone's coattails as he avoided attacks non-stop.</p>

    <p>But the truth was that Wang Ling did give some extra battle support.</p>

    <p>For example, it looked like Guo Hao had cut down the tree with Ghost Tooth, but it was actually Wang Ling who had done it... He had no other choice. As an upstanding individual who upheld core socialist values, Wang Ling had always understood what it meant to "become spring soil to nourish the flowers."</p>

    <p>To be a supporting character wasn't a bad thing</p>

    <p>The main thing was that it was the way of the Wang family to not stand out too much.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"We should find a place to set up camp before the sun sets." After sending the students from both schools packing, Sun Rong calmed down and analyzed the map once again.</p>

    <p>They had to be careful when choosing the camp site. For example, they would be easily surrounded if they chose terrain that was too high; choosing a cliff or some place similar might prevent them from being attacked by spirit insects and beasts, but once they were surrounded by other people, they would have no choice but to jump off the cliff.</p>

    <p>Thus, they had to find a place with food, water, and a relative abundance of spirit plants. As long as there were spirit plants, Sun Rong would be able to create some simple pills for driving away insects and even spirit beasts.</p>

    <p>She was from Huaguo Water Curtain Group, and was the future successor; there was no way she would disgrace her family in this national competition.</p>

    <p>As long as there were enough spirit plants, Sun Rong had enough room to display her skills.</p>

    <p>But the problem now was where they should set up camp.</p>

    <p>Nine Dragon Mountain was called as such because of its terrain. Like dragon claws, nine mountain peaks encircled a massive mountain dome, which was Nine Dragon Mountain's main peak.</p>

    <p>Nine Dragon Mountain was thus in fact made up of ten mountains in total. The main peak naturally was the richest in resources, but it was also very likely where most people would be competing for them. Wang Ling and the others were too far away; even if they hurried over now, it was very likely that someone else had already grabbed key resources. The group would need to consider it at length if they wanted to seize these resources.</p>

    <p>Thus, Number 60 High could only pick the closest Dragon Claw mountain peak and claim a place relatively rich in resources first.</p>

    <p>"Nine Dragon Mountain â€” Fire Peak," Sun Rong suggested after analyzing the map.</p>

    <p>Fire Mountain was one of the Dragon Claw peaks of Nine Dragon Mountain, which had something like a tropical environment. While it was slightly warmer, it was abundant in resources, and more importantly, it wasn't far from their position.</p>

    <p>Apart from that, there was also a supply point next to Fire Peak.</p>

    <p>Based on the current map, there already wasn't a better place than Fire Peak.</p>

    <p>Of course, they couldn't rule out the possibility that a school might have already entered and occupied Fire Peak.</p>

    <p>After some discussion, they still decided to seize Fire Peak.</p>

    <p>Since using the turtle-breathing skill would slow them down tremendously, Sun Rong came up with a fabulous solution.</p>

    <p>She used Mysterious Sea's strength to combine everyone's spirit energy together to ultimately form a massive turtle shell to shield them.</p>

    <p>"This is the Blue Turtle Shell Spell; your aura won't be exposed when you breathe inside this shell, and it produces the same effect as the turtle-breathing skill," Sun Rong explained.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong knew how to use this spell, but she would have worried about how long it could last, if everyone's spirit energy hadn't been combined together. Now, it was like ten people driving a train as they lent Mysterious Sea their spirit energy and cast the spell together.</p>

    <p>But this created a problem...</p>

    <p>Mysterious Sea realized that Wang Ling really had too much energy.</p>

    <p>As a sword spirit, this was the first time in her life that she was sensing such boundless spirit energy, and she suddenly felt the urge to cry out loudly in her heart: <em>Stay away... I already can't take it anymore...</em></p>
