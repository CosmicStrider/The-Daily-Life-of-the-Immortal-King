  <h1>Chapter 1086 Wang Ling's Observation</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was destined to be a sleepless night. Every time Single's Curse's passive effect was triggered, Wang Ling was always worried about there being new bugs.</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, Sun Rong, who was lying in her 50-meter large bed, was also in deep thought and regretting her confession today. She had summoned up the courage to speak up, but when she opened her mouth, it turned out to be something else.</p>

    <p>Ah... Luckily, there had been no one around, otherwise it would have been too humiliating!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong buried her face in a pillow and kicked around on the bed with her long legs.</p>

    <p>5th November was the second day of the semester at Number 60 High.</p>

    <p>The news spread in class that several Senior Grade Three students had interrupted the one-on-one study sessions and had made a hole in the ceiling... Although the ceiling had been repaired overnight, many people were still praising them inwardly: Good job!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>It turned out that it was too easy to pull aggro when studying with Sun Rong... But this clearly wouldn't stop Old Pan's plan from proceeding. Wang Ling wondered if he should raise his marks slightly instead of keeping it down to the average in the next test. This way, the one-on-on study sessions could carry on with someone else: Wang Ling could free himself from the annoyance of staying back after school for extra lessons, and give this glorious, great learning opportunity to the next unlucky fool.</p>

    <p>It was Lao Gudong's history class in the morning.</p>

    <p>After being apart over the summer break, the students had missed him.</p>

    <p>When that familiar figure stepped into the classroom, everyone's eyes unblinkingly started to look Lao Gudong up and down.</p>

    <p>"Why do I feel that Lao Gudong has lost some weight?"</p>

    <p>The class silently examined Lao Gudong's round figure, and were astonished to discover that Lao Gudong seemed much thinner after the summer break.</p>

    <p>"I heard that Lao Gudong did some volunteer teaching over the summer break," someone in the know finally said.</p>

    <p>"Volunteer teaching?"</p>

    <p>"Mm... I heard it's a very poor place. Our city will organize teachers to do volunteer teaching every year. This year, it was Number 60 High's turn, along with several other high schools in the Peiyuan district, to send teachers. Lao Gudong was one of them. He did it for half a month," the student said. "In addition to volunteer teaching, the school also raised funds to buy school supplies like textbooks and spirit swords for teaching which you can't find in rural areas."</p>

    <p>When this classmate said this, everyone couldn't help sighing in their hearts. Huaxiu had always been regarded as a prosperous and powerful nation since its founding, but this development wasn't spread out evenly given the inherent geographical disadvantages of some poor areas. The motherland was prosperous, but it had to be admitted that the gap between the rich and poor still existed.</p>

    <p>"Everyone..." Lao Gudong stood on the dais. After returning from his volunteer teaching, his heart was filled with mixed emotions. Half a month of volunteer teaching was very short, but it was enough for Lao Gudong to experience the poverty in the countryside. "I'm sure everyone knows that half a month ago, I went to West Sea village in West Sea county to do volunteer teaching."</p>

    <p>"This volunteer teaching operation is part of a volunteer teaching campaign which the Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools launched many years ago, and it actually doesn't only run during the winter and summer holidays. Every day, schools in thriving cities will organize for their teachers to take turns to do volunteer teaching in various places. This volunteer teaching has greatly improved the level of cultivation education in our country's impoverished areas, and is also an immense help to children in these poor areas."</p>

    <p>"It was definitely tough, right, teacher?"</p>

    <p>"I would be lying if I said it wasn't," Lao Gudong replied with a wry smile. "The terrain is harsh in these areas, so the teachers who do this volunteer teaching have to be on average above the Golden Core stage, or it could be very dangerous. Because of the highly acidic nature of the underground spiritual veins, the residents in these areas have to endure harsh conditions."</p>

    <p>"Can't they move to a big city?" Chen Chao asked.</p>

    <p>"They've lived here for generations, and their physiques have adapted to the environment. Outsiders can't live in this place, while residents also cannot move elsewhere as they won't be able to easily adapt to a new environment. If volunteer teachers teach in such dangerous territory over a long period of time, it will have a huge impact on their health, which is why the volunteer teaching locations move around."</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong said, "Due to these unique geographical conditions, local residences can't easily expand outward, while outsiders also can't settle down and establish a commercial foothold, and the region's economy thus falls behind over time. There are many other places like West Sea village that have this sort of harsh terrain.</p>

    <p>"But the underground spiritual veins can't be changed, so our country has to intervene in other ways to promote economic development in poor areas, such as launching spirit power missiles into the sky that can suppress the strong acidity to stabilize the situation for a period of time.</p>

    <p>"Another example is to make use of the unique acidic nature of the underground veins and turn the strength of this corrosive acid into an energy source. Like in the West Sea village where I went, the villagers are very savvy at decomposing rubbish. Their houses all have a garbage chute that runs straight into the ground. Everyday household waste is thrown inside this garbage chute and is immediately and completely decomposed by the highly acidic spiritual veins... In a sense, this is also one way to protect the environment."</p>

    <p>"You worked hard, teacher; you lost weight..." At that moment, someone finally raised the main issue.</p>

    <p>"Actually, the main reason why I lost weight isn't due to the volunteer teaching... But because there weren't any snack shops in that place! I finished all the <em>latiao</em> I brought with me on the first day! It wasn't enough at all!" Lao Gudong cried up a storm.</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In this history lesson, Lao Gudong used the subject of his volunteer teaching to raise a very important assessment point: underground spiritual veins.</p>

    <p>Underground spiritual veins were a special sort of energy reserve hidden in the depths of the earth. It didn't have substance, but circulated in a particular location like a flowing dragon.</p>

    <p>Cultivators often chose the best feng shui spot for when they went into seclusion, and many relied on calculating the location of underground spiritual veins to do so.</p>

    <p>There were large and small underground spiritual veins, and they had different attributes. The spiritual veins under big cities undoubtedly contained massive energy. This was especially true of the spiritual vein under Jinghua, the capital.</p>

    <p>After class, Lao Gudong gave each student a reference list of the locations of every underground spiritual vein that had appeared throughout history. These were compulsory test points for the next monthly exam. For the exam, ten spiritual veins would be randomly selected from the hundreds on the list, and students would have to respond with which historical period these spiritual veins appeared in as well as what their attributes were before the answers could be considered correct.</p>

    <p>After helping Lao Gudong hand out the reference lists and forms, Sun Rong couldn't help but look in Wang Ling's direction.</p>

    <p>Yesterday's confession... had in fact been a little embarrassing...</p>

    <p>She had no idea what Wang Ling thought about it. She was going to sneak a look at him, but didn't expect to see that he was also looking at her...</p>
