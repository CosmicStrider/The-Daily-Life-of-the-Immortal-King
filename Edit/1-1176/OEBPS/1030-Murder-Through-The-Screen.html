  <h1>Chapter 1030 Murder Through The Screen</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Gao Tian couldn't help gritting his teeth. The murderer really had guts, striking in broad daylight! Most importantly, he actually dared to commit the crime even when the police were already camping out in the apartment? He was completely looking down on them.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin rushed up with Gao Tian. At Unit 605, which was a suite, Xiao Yin could smell the strong scent of blood inside. He kicked the door open with one bare foot. He didn't use a lot of strength, but the entire door was sent flying into the living room wall.</p>

    <p>Gao Tian hurriedly summoned his police sword and rushed in. The police sword was standard issue for a first rank superintendent. The hilt was shaped just like the grip of a gun, and the sword could be used as a gun or as a close combat weapon. Once a person was used to it, the sword could even transform into an anti-explosion spirit shield, and had a variety of other uses.</p>

    <p>Worried that the murderer was still around, Gao Tian was on high alert as he moved forward slowly, his spirit sword in hand. Gao Tian and Xiao Yin then saw a young man lying back in a computer chair, his neck at a crooked angle - it had been cut, and the blood had sprayed onto the computer screen. Although his windpipe had been cut, it wasn't completely severed.</p>

    <p>Hearing them come in, the young man began to struggle desperately. He couldn't speak, and there was utter panic on his face.</p>

    <p>"Don't be scared, I'm a police officer!" Gao Tian pressed down on the young man's shoulder. He took out all his equipment and began to give the latter first aid. Until now, no one knew what the murderer looked like or how he was killing people - if they could save this young man, it would be a major breakthrough for this case!</p>

    <p>It had to be said that Gao Tian was still very calm as he didn't lose his head. However, Xiao Yin looked at the bottles and jars scattered on the ground and frowned. "Are these things useful?"</p>

    <p>"His windpipe has been cut open and I've already called an ambulance. This is just basic first aid." To be honest, even Gao Tian himself didn't know if the young man would survive.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin's eyelids dropped slightly. After thinking for a while, he bit his finger and squeezed out two drops of holy beast blood, one for the young man's neck and the other for the corner of his mouth. With a burst of spirit power, the blood turned into vapor, and the young man's wound began to heal at a visible rate.</p>

    <p>"This is..." Gao Tian was astonished.</p>

    <p>"Don't tell anyone." Xiao Yin looked at Gao Tian.</p>

    <p>He didn't know whether he had done the right thing.</p>

    <p>After all, by treating an outsider with his blood, he risked exposing his identity.</p>

    <p>"Thanks." Gao Tian nodded and didn't say anything more.</p>

    <p>The two drops of holy beast blood brought the young man back from the brink of death. He was petrified, but grateful at the same time. Thankfully, he hadn't seen how he had been saved; he only felt that this brother with silver hair behind him seemed to have dropped something on his wound. It then felt like he had come back to life and his breathing started to smooth out.</p>

    <p>He must have used some sort of secret medicine, right?</p>

    <p>That was what the young man thought.</p>

    <p>As someone who had walked on the edge of hell, the young man wouldn't think too much and didn't care at all how he had been saved - all he knew was that he was incredibly lucky to still be alive!</p>

    <p>Gao Tian then began questioning this young man who had been in distress. He turned on the recording function on the police sword, and a red light started to blink on it.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin's lips twitched. This sword... was so omnipotent!</p>

    <p>"What's your name? Age? Job?"</p>

    <p>"My name is Shen Guangrong. I'm graduating from a Golden Core university this year, and I'm currently working on my graduation project at home."</p>

    <p>"What's your major?"</p>

    <p>"Spirit sword modeling and design; I'm in the department of magic treasure design, and I specialize in designing the appearance of a magic treasure."</p>

    <p>"Mm." Gao Tian nodded. "You don't have to be afraid. Since we're here, the murderer won't do anything to you again. Can you tell us what happened?"</p>

    <p>The young man clenched his fists and sweat started to appear on his forehead.</p>

    <p>To be honest, the attack had been so quick. It happened practically in the blink of an eye, and he had no idea what was going on.</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry, officer, I didn't see what the murderer looked like..." said Shen Guangrong. He then looked at the laptop in front of him with lingering fear. "A pair of hands suddenly stretched out from the computer. Before I could react, they started attacking me with a knife and my throat was cut..."</p>

    <p>"Screen murder?"</p>

    <p>Gao Tian was shocked. "What did the hands look like?"</p>

    <p>"They were hairy and a little dark... They looked like the hands of a middle-aged man. The fingernails were very long and had some blood under them."</p>

    <p>"It looks like it has to be the same murderer." Based on the details provided by this Student Shen Guangrong, Gao Tian determined that the person who had attacked the former was the suspect in the serial murders.</p>

    <p>From the detailed description of the hands, the suspect should be a dark-skinned man who was 1.7 meters in height, of medium build, and about 130 jin in weight. The murderer hadn't cleaned off the bloodstains under his fingernails - he probably regarded them as a "badge" of sorts, and couldn't bear to wash them off. From this, Gao Tian determined that the murderer was one hundred percent mentally ill.</p>

    <p>But killing people through the screen...</p>

    <p>Gao Tian had never encountered this technique before.</p>

    <p>There were a lot of techniques in the cultivation world. To kill someone through the screen, you had to convert your body into spirit fiber... Such spells weren't unheard of. A lot of cultivation delivery companies provided this service of transmitting express deliveries through the screen, but the problem was that the items transmitted were all non-living things; a person's body had to be broken down into something as insubstantial as spirit fiber before it recombined on the other side of the screen. In Gao Tian's view, this was playing with fire.</p>

    <p>In addition, if living bodies really could be transmitted through the screen, the network police would be able to detect it instantly, given the level of Songhai's cultivation technology</p>

    <p>Gao Tian knew what the murderer's MO was now. It was true that killing people through a screen could be done quietly and would leave no traces behind, but the murders still didn't make sense.</p>

    <p>Take university student Shen Guangrong for example, who had just been attacked. The murderer cut his throat, which was very similar to how the programmer on the fifth floor had died.</p>

    <p>However, this didn't match the alchemist and the female live streamer who had died earlier. The alchemist's place was designed in a classic style and didn't have anything like a computer screen - the murderer must have broken in some other way.</p>

    <p>As for the female live streamer, if she really had been killed through the screen, she should have died right in front of her audience. However, it was confirmed that she was killed when she opened the door.</p>

    <p>One murderer, using two completely different killing methods. Was this really possible? Was the murderer trying to mislead them? Or was it in fact two murderers from the very beginning?</p>
