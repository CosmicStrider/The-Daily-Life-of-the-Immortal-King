  <h1>Chapter 761 Out and Proud Wang Ming</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ming had long known that Luo Chuang was a craftsman of some repute, but this also confirmed the rumor that the outstanding elites in some fields more or less had some unknown peculiarities...</p>

    <p>It seemed that this Luo Chuang wasn't just a sword spirit-con, he was also a Jingke fanboy!</p>

    <p>At this rate, he was going to become a sasaeng fan!</p>

    <p>Wang Ming patted Luo Chuang on the shoulder and said in a very earnest tone, "That... Brother Luo, don't you think you might be a little perverted?"</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang scratched his head and his large belly wobbled as a very strange expression came over his face. "What's wrong with a man being a little perverted?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming, Zhuo Yi, Xiao Yin and Wuji: "..." This guy was hopeless!</p>

    <p>Wang Ming waved his hands and didn't argue with Luo Chuang any longer.</p>

    <p>As a person of noble character, he had to do the right thing. Wang Ming decided to use his "noble" conduct to influence Luo Chuang and bring him back from the perverted path to the right one to prevent him from sinking any lower. Otherwise, if he reached that point, there really would be no way to save him.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming couldn't let that happen.</p>

    <p>He sighed in his heart before saying to Luo Chuang, "Come and help me. I have the blueprint for the mecha armor; if we work together, it should be a lot faster."</p>

    <p>"How long will it take?" Xiao Yin asked.</p>

    <p>"Ten or twenty minutes," Wang Ming said.</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang had a complete set of materials on hand, and could act as his assistant. The most important thing was that this first mecha armor hadn't yet reached the point of being written off.</p>

    <p>After getting out of the remains, Wang Ming was definitely going to use the equipment in the research institute to develop a second generation mecha armor.</p>

    <p>Currently, however, without the relevant computer equipment, he could only do some basic repairs on this first mecha armor. Moreover, after the earlier fight with Ghost Head Blade, Wang Ming felt it was necessary to modify the spirit power cannons on his arms after testing them.</p>

    <p>Especially the recoil.</p>

    <p>He wanted to avoid being flung backward each time after firing the cannon.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Beside the quiet, little lake, Zhuo Yi and the others waited as Wang Ming and Luo Chuang worked together to repair the first mecha armor.</p>

    <p>So far, Zhuo Yi had only told Wang Ling and no one else about finding Wang Ming. This was because looking at the time, they should only reach the site of the unusual space fluctuations after a very long while.</p>

    <p>But because they had used Wuji's space transference ability, they'd arrived at the coordinates in an instant.</p>

    <p>If they reported back right now, it would be difficult to avoid suspicion.</p>

    <p>So Zhuo Yi thought it would be better to wait for some time before saying anything.</p>

    <p>Roughly ten minutes later, Wang Ming took off his goggles and stood up from a crouch. "The repairs are done!"</p>

    <p>Curious, Zhuo Yi and Xiao Yin came close for a look, and saw the ground littered with components from this first mecha armor. Wang Ming was holding a palm-sized disk in his hand which glowed faintly - this was precisely the core center that had been embedded with spirit power from the storage ring.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming had already connected this core center earlier to Rolling Wheels to recharge its spirit power. Rolling Wheels had a built-in solar energy system; as long as there was light, spirit power could be restored little by little.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ming hadn't exercised restraint at all when he extracted spirit power from Rolling Wheels.</p>

    <p>"Watch this."</p>

    <p>He grinned, and when he locked the core center in place on his chest, the scattered parts on the ground flew up one by one, as if they were alive, and swiftly wrapped themselves around Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>"As expected of Lao Gudong Xiaoer... This is the first time I've seen this type of smart assembly mecha armor," Luo Chuang marveled.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "A mere trifle."</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang: "Does this mecha armor have a name?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "Yes: The First Mecha â€¢ Wang Ling One!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was startled. "Wang... Wang Ling One?"</p>

    <p>"Yes." Wang Ming nodded. "I was newly inspired by Brother Luo's mechanical arm, and I reinforced Wang Ling One's arms so that when I fire the spirit power cannons, my own arms won't hurt from the blast. In addition, I also added a recoil adjustment system and dead fish eye lasers. My eyes can now fire spirit power lasers!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Of course, these aren't what I'm most proud of! My favorite is still... Wang Ling One's tongue!"</p>

    <p>After saying this, Wang Ming directly controlled the mecha armor to stick out its tongue. "This was also inspired by Brother Luo. But it's different from Brother Luo's tongue, which identifies materials. Using his tongue as a foundation, I added a new function! Speaking of, when I stuck out the tongue just now, did you feel the urge to hit me?"</p>

    <p>"Yes!" Zhuo Yi nodded with sweaty cheeks.</p>

    <p>He indeed felt that way and almost hadn't been able to resist the urge to punch Wang Ming!</p>

    <p>After Wang Ling One stuck out its tongue, it seemed to be especially asking to be beaten up!</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "This is 'taunt,' a visual capture mechanism that I added to the tongue. The sight of it sends a taunting signal to the brain... Think of it as a 'mass taunt<sup>1</sup>.'"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A literal translation of a
gaming term for taunting
multiple monsters to make
them all attack at the same
time ..)</dfn>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang was hugely astonished by Wang Ming's invention, and directly asked Wang Ming the question which the latter had asked him earlier, "Lao Gudong Xiaoer, don't you think you might be a little perverted?"</p>

    <p>"Maybe."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming nodded. "But I'm obviously different from you!"</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang: "???"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "You're a closeted pervert, but I'm out and proud! Do you dare call your mechanical arm Jingke One?"</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang sucked in a cold breath of air. "..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi, Xiao Yin and Wuji: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the thick woods of the eastern region of Beast King's Remains, a plump figure appeared.</p>

    <p>A short while later, a dark shadow dropped down behind it.</p>

    <p>"Senior brother," the shadow said.</p>

    <p>"Everything is settled?"</p>

    <p>"The children who fainted from fright in the chaos have been rescued. I don't think I exposed myself."</p>

    <p>"Mm, that's good." Lao Gudong nodded.</p>

    <p>Then he turned around and looked at Daoist Taotie. "I personally got rid of that Ghost Head Blade for our sect, and wasted one of my space chalks... He was supposed to be our third junior brother, but it's a pity that he went astray in the end. Killing ten thousand people was nothing more than the sect's test of our wisdom. I guess he didn't have the complete book of secrets, and it's missing the second half."</p>

    <p>"I'll check Ghost Head Blade's residence myself later and retrieve the book before it falls into someone else's hands..." Daoist Taotie also felt a lot of regret over this incident.</p>

    <p>"By the by, what does senior brother think about that mysterious senior?"</p>

    <p>"He has to be among the teachers; I'm still searching." Lao Gudong frowned. "But given that senior's strength, I'm afraid he won't reveal himself so easily. We need a master to show us how to relieve ourselves of the side effects of cultivating from our sect's book of secrets. We've been searching high and low for shizun to no avail. For now, this senior is our best hope..."</p>
