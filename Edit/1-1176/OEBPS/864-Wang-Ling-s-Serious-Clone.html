  <h1>Chapter 864 Wang Ling's "Serious Clone"</h1>

  <div>

    <p>If it was anyone else who had come to investigate Wang Ling so brazenly, the six Great Heavenly Dao would have joined forces to ruthlessly crush the other party right away and kick them out of the Heavenly Dao Governing Committee... But Gu Shunzhi's identity was very special as he was the keeper of order for three universes.</p>

    <p>Similarly, he was one of the clients on the Heavenly Dao whitelist, although his exact ranking was far below Wang Ling's... Yes, the Heavenly Dao whitelist also had a ranking. Even after clients were added to the list, Heavenly Dao ranked them according to their overall cosmic contributions. In fact, Gu Shunzhi's ranking couldn't be considered low, but compared with Wang Ling, there was still a lot of room for improvement.</p>

    <p>Not everyone was qualified to enter the whitelist. For example, Liu Qingyi and Wang Zhen weren't eligible.</p>

    <p>So using Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi as a yardstick, a large number of people would already be directly cut out.</p>

    <p>While Gu Shunzhi was filling in the information, Wang Ling, who had received the news, sent a clone to the Heavenly Dao Governing Committee.</p>

    <p>Because the cooking contest was still ongoing in the Wang family's small villa, he had to stay back, but the clone he sent was his "serious clone." It was even stronger than Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch, who had an independent consciousness and wouldn't disappear, so Wang Ling deliberately added the word "serious" in front to demonstrate how seriously he viewed the opponent!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had always wanted to know the limits of his power. Although he had now learned from Book of Sage Immortal where his Three Thousand Great Dao had come from, Wang Ling had actually always felt that his three thousand Dao was just so-so... They weren't as powerful as he imagined. The only problem was that he couldn't control them...</p>

    <p>He was only sixteen years old - if he had sixteen thousand years of practice, Wang Ling was confident that he would be able to master all of them!</p>

    <p>Even if he didn't have sixteen thousand years, but sixteen hundred, it would still be a lot better than now.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi was a person who had grown up in the Domain of the Gods, and who became a "keeper of cosmic order" in the future - such a person shouldn't be too weak.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, Gu Shunzhi had already sensed it when Wang Ling's "serious clone" appeared in the Heavenly Dao Governing Committee's Heavenly Dao space.</p>

    <p>He stopped answering the questionnaire and smiled slightly. "Sure enough, answering these questions was just to buy time?"</p>

    <p>The six Great Heavenly Dao clones directly faded into nothing on the spot, leaving the Heavenly Dao space to the two people.</p>

    <p>The original six Great Heavenly Dao felt that it would be better for them to create a subspace for these two - if they were to fight here, it was possible that they would affect the spatial order of the neighboring universes, given their strength.</p>

    <p>But it was too late to mention it now.</p>

    <p>The six Great Heavenly Dao didn't want to be drawn into this fight.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi turned his head to gaze at Wang Ling's serious clone, and stared blankly at the latter's face.</p>

    <p>He never thought that this person whom the six Great Heavenly Dao viewed with extreme reverence would actually be his classmate at Number 60 High School!</p>

    <p>When he entered Number 60 High, his objective at the very beginning hadn't been to track down Wang Ling, but to approach Liu Qingyi and Wang Zhen. When he found out that these two people wanted to hang around in a Foundation Establishment high school, he decided to take the transfer test as well.</p>

    <p>But Gu Shunzhi had never expected such a person to actually be hiding next to him...</p>

    <p>And most crucially, he hadn't sensed it at all.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi's expression turned serious as he started to size up Wang Ling. The youngster in front of him was very average-looking, but he gave off an astonishing pressure, when there in fact weren't many people who could pressure Gu Shunzhi.</p>

    <p>The other keepers of cosmic order were all skilled, and Gu Shunzhi had had the honor of comparing notes with them. However, none of them had made him shudder faintly just from their breathing alone, even before the battle began. If there was one, it would be his own father, Gu Cheng.</p>

    <p>But his father Gu Cheng wasn't that powerful yet in this era...</p>

    <p>"We, the keepers of order, have a list of the strongest people in each universe, but you're not on it." There was a forbidding expression on Gu Shunzhi's face as he fixed his eyes on Wang Ling. "Since you aren't on the list, you must be a disruptor of order... You must be annihilated."</p>

    <p>This was empty talk.</p>

    <p>It was very clear in Gu Shunzhi's mind that since the other party wasn't on the list, there had to be special circumstances - it was just that he didn't know what they were.</p>

    <p>When he saw how frightened the six Great Heavenly Dao were, he was actually already well aware in his heart.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's identity and background might be more complicated than he had imagined.</p>

    <p>Although there was a serious expression on Gu Shunzhi's face... actually, his heart was full of excitement!</p>

    <p>Any showdown or challenge against an expert made him excited!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Since they were now in Heavenly Dao space, which was an absolutely neutral spatial sphere in which timelines didn't cross, Wang Ling could hear Gu Shunzhi's thoughts...</p>

    <p>This guy was also a master at acting!</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi kept silent as he stared at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>That had clearly been a provocation just now...</p>

    <p>But the other side unexpectedly could still keep his composure, and didn't make the first move...</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi felt even more excited!</p>

    <p>Only a bigwig could have this kind of calm bearing!</p>

    <p>What should he do?</p>

    <p>Attack first?</p>

    <p>No...</p>

    <p>He absolutely couldn't!</p>

    <p>What if the other party could tell that despite his serious look on the surface, he was in fact very excited in his heart?</p>

    <p>He would lose his elegant demeanor as a keeper of order!</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi lowered his head and released fifty percent of his aura to probe Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But even after dozens of seconds passed, the other party's eyebrows didn't even so much as twitch.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi was even more excited!</p>

    <p>The oppression of his aura actually didn't have any effect?</p>

    <p>It seemed that the other party was far more powerful than he had thought.</p>

    <p>He could let go as much as he wanted when they fought, and he no longer had to restrain himself...</p>

    <p>In his previous fights with some of the other keepers of cosmic order, Gu Shunzhi had had to suppress his nature countless times since their overall fighting strength wasn't as good as his.</p>

    <p>Now!</p>

    <p>He!</p>

    <p>Had at long last met a person he could fight!</p>

    <p>The corners of Gu Shunzhi's mouth curled up slightly, but he quickly covered his mouth with his hand.</p>

    <p>Damn it...</p>

    <p>Because he was too excited, he couldn't even control his mouth!</p>

    <p>"Disruptor of order, fight me, if you dare!" Gu Shunzhi stared at Wang Ling's serious clone and spoke in a deep voice.</p>

    <p>His face was flushed with excitement and all the blood in his body was boiling as it released a blast of steam. "Before we fight, I need to make one thing clear! I'm not excited! Definitely! Not excited!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling finally understood.</p>

    <p>This guy was a tsundere...</p>
