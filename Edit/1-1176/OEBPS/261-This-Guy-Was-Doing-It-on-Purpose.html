  <h1>Chapter 261 This Guy Was Doing It on Purpose! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling stared blankly at this scene. He was sitting in the shade of a tree as he pretended to be resting. This should have been a very inconspicuous position. But Wang Ling had miscalculated, because this position happened to put him opposite Fang Xing, and they were actually quite close to each other.</p>

    <p>As a result, Teacher Ye had barely finished speaking before Fang Xing had straightaway walked toward Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"This classmate, can you lend me your sword for a bit?" Fang Xing smiled with a natural and relaxed expression.</p>

    <p>Deep down, Wang Ling in fact wasn't willing to do so. For a cultivator, their personal magic treasure was quite a private thing. And, most crucially, Jingke was very special to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>After Fang Xing made his request, neither of them moved. They looked at each other, separated by just a meter. It was also the first time that Wang Ling was face to face with Fang Xing. One person was sitting in the shade of a tree while the other was standing in the sun, creating a sharp contrast.</p>

    <p>In the sun, Fang Xing's hair was slightly brown. He was still in the white short-sleeved shirt and the blue and white striped track pants. His face was so fair that Wang Ling felt that if he wore women's clothes, he would definitely be a beauty.</p>

    <p>After a full minute of silence, Wang Ling finally handed Jingke to him.</p>

    <p>Because he really couldn't stand the scorching gazes of the girls around them.</p>

    <p>At the moment, Fang Xing was like the sun, shining brightly after having just arrived at Number 60 High School â€” he was really way too dazzling. In fact, Wang Ling could guess that if he refused Fang Xing's request, it was likely that he would become the target of more hate.</p>

    <p>So even if he did lend Fang Xing his sword, he didn't quite like him.</p>

    <p>It might not look like Fang Xing had deliberately set out to borrow his spirit sword, and it had seemed very natural, but Wang Ling had the feeling that Fang Xing had done it on purpose.</p>

    <p>Of course, Wang Ling also had his own reasons for handing Jingke over. Jingke had its own consciousness; if there was something fishy about Fang Xing, Jingke would definitely be able to detect it with its strength.</p>

    <p>Then, the PE class completely became Fang Xing's personal show.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High School's performance in the district school sports meet had always been poor, which had always been a headache for Teacher Ye as the head of the sports team's teaching and research group. This year, several students talented in sports, including Chen Chao, had joined the school's elite stream. Coupled with the sudden discovery of Fang Xing this young seedling, Teacher Ye felt that this was an opportunity that absolutely couldn't be wasted.</p>

    <p>Holding Jingke, Fang Xing stood at the starting line and waited for Teacher Ye's direction to begin. When he had used the teaching spirit sword earlier, he had completed the ten laps with a good time of one and a half minutes.</p>

    <p>With a normal spirit sword, the margin of difference was under thirty seconds, or two minutes at the most. Teacher Ye thought that Number 60 High School's chances in the sports meet's running event this year were pretty solid.</p>

    <p>When Teacher Ye waved his hand, Fang Xing started to run along the track.</p>

    <p>A cultivator's jogging pace was a lot faster than an average person's sprint. As soon as Fang Xing started out, he left a string of afterimages behind him, which instantly turned the girls around them into cheerleaders.</p>

    <p>The girls were all cheering and the boys were all gossiping. As a transfer student, Fang Xing had really made waves, which made some of the boys unhappy.</p>

    <p>But they could only contain this disgruntlement in their hearts, since anyone who decided to lock horns with Fang Xing at this critical juncture would definitely suffer bitterly for it; it was a given that the girls would view them with disdain. Furthermore, even if they tried to find trouble with him in private, there was a good chance that they still wouldn't be able to defeat him!</p>

    <p>What was the saying... I like how you hate me but can't get rid of me <sup>1</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is an online meme.)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that this saying currently suited Fang Xing very well.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, Fang Xing ran the first six laps easily as Jingke floated steadily in the air above his head.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling had passed Jingke to Fang Xing, he had already asked it to stay as relaxed as possible, and find a way to deplete more of Fang Xing's spirit energy.</p>

    <p>To Wang Ling's slight surprise, Fang Xing was actually able to handle it.</p>

    <p>On the seventh lap, sweat finally started to roll down Fang Xing's cheeks, and it was clear that he was slowing down. Of course, in the eyes of average people, he still looked like a string of afterimages. Teacher Ye was intensely focused as his eyes followed Fang Xing closely.</p>

    <p>After teaching PE for so many years, Teacher Ye was actually very sensitive to this type of faint disparity in speed.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling watched this performance from where he sat in the shade of the tree. He saw Chen Chao put his hands on his hips as he looked on in amazement. "Classmate Fang Xing... is such a freak!"</p>

    <p>To call Fang Xing a "freak" was in fact a great compliment. Chen Chao's level was at the standard of first-class athletes at the Formation Establishment stage in Huaxiu nation, which very likely would have colored his appraisal of Fang Xing, so his words were already enough to prove that Fang Xing wasn't normal.</p>

    <p>But since the beginning, Wang Ling had felt that Fang Xing was far from simple.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at the track. In just a blink of an eye, Fang Xing was already on his ninth lap. Unexpectedly, his previously slow pace changed, and to a burst of cheers from the female students, Fang Xing abruptly began to speed up.</p>

    <p>On the tenth lap, he blew by Teacher Ye like a gust of wind, and in the end, the stopwatch stopped at one minute and thirty-one seconds.</p>

    <p>"Too... too awesome!" Teacher Ye looked at the stopwatch and almost jumped up and down with how excited he was.</p>

    <p>The difference was only one second when Fang Xing used a normal spirit sword!</p>

    <p>Moreover, the most important thing was that the spirit sword which he had used belonged to Wang Ling; it wasn't his own personal spirit sword, nor had he made a contract with it. In a situation where they didn't share such a rapport, Fang Xing had actually obtained more outstanding results than the sports students... Teacher Ye instantly felt like he had unearthed treasure!</p>

    <p>After the run, Fang Xing's face was a little red, and he was panting as he went to Wang Ling to express his thanks and return Jingke to him.</p>

    <p>When he took Jingke back, Wang Ling could already confirm that Fang Xing's exact realm was far from being as simple as the Foundation Establishment stage.</p>

    <p>What on earth was this person hiding?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't like this feeling of not knowing the exact situation.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing lifted the bottom of his white short-sleeved shirt to wipe at his sweat, then smiled very brightly. "Classmate, thank you! Oh, by the way, what's your name?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's deep gaze was hidden under his fringe.</p>

    <p>For a second time, the two individuals looked at each other.</p>

    <p>Before Wang Ling could open his mouth, Chen Chao next to him interjected, "He's called Wang Ling and he doesn't like to talk much."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao had always gotten along with people, and would always take a liking to sports talents, so his impression of Fang Xing wasn't bad.</p>

    <p>"Oh, so you're Classmate Wang Ling." Fang Xing nodded.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, he looked at Teacher Ye next to him. "Teacher Ye, do we have all the people we need for the sports meet?"</p>

    <p>Teacher Ye stroked his chin in contemplation. "The specific line-up has yet to be decided, but we want to become a key city high school this year, so we have to take this district competition seriously. Headmaster Chen wants me to create the strongest line-up possible. Speaking of our two elite classes, Student Chen Chao's and your spots have already been confirmed."</p>

    <p>"I see..."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing grinned as he looked at Teacher Ye. "Actually, I think Classmate Wang Ling is pretty strong. Why not have him join us?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling could see it now.</p>

    <p>This guy... was definitely doing it on purpose!</p>
