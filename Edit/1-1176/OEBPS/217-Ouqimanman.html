  <h1>Chapter 217 Ouqimanman </h1>

  <div>

    <p>All his life, Wang Ming had never experienced what it was like to personally wield a magic treasure, so this was actually a rare opportunity for him.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, his fantasy of fighting back had already hit a wall before it had even gotten off the ground.</p>

    <p>This bunch of people were really too good at laying low!</p>

    <p>For a full hour and a half, there wasn't even the slightest movement — even the red dots on the radar hadn't moved. It looked like everyone was planning to keep still and wait to accept a delivery! Moreover, there wasn't a single magic treasure on the ground as far as the eye could see; this location was the worst and horribly bare!</p>

    <p>Time flowed at a different rate in the small world. Although the military training drill was to last three days, that was according to time in the outside world. If you could lay low while that toxic fog continued to close in, you could at the very least end up ranked in the top one hundred.</p>

    <p>They had to find a way to stir up things; this was much too boring!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling knew that this mad scientist cousin of his had never been a person who could remain inactive for very long.</p>

    <p>Just as this idiot second brother was lamenting in his heart about how boring it was, suddenly there was a bright light high up in the air, and a square box slowly drifted down.</p>

    <p>An airdrop?</p>

    <p>"There could be something good in it," Wang Ming said. "According to the law of checks and balances in this drill, this desert is probably the place with the fewest magic treasures, so if an airdrop happens here, the things inside must be very valuable! Talismans, elixirs... there might even be snacks!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Wait... snacks?!</p>

    <p>Wang Ming cupped his chin and smiled as he looked at Wang Ling. "Snacks were my idea. When we were creating the airdrops, I got them to put large snack gift packs inside. These will help people to keep calm and break up the loneliness of long waits. Oh, by the way... there are crispy noodle snacks in the gift pack. Want to check it out?"</p>

    <p>For some reason, Wang Ling, who had had an indifferent attitude toward this survival contest since the beginning, suddenly became a little more interested.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It had to be said that Wang Ming's trick had been brilliant.</p>

    <p>Now that they had a target, he noticed that Wang Ling's attitude was now a lot more serious compared with his indifference before. It was clear that previously, he had just been using his Heavenly Eye lazily, but now he was keeping it open the whole time as they forged forward in the direction of the airdrop.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming knew that for Wang Ling to keep his Heavenly Eye open for long periods of time was actually very difficult. This was because his Heavenly Eye was a little special; when it was activated, Wang Ling's pupils would take on an extraordinary color that would gradually turn golden and in the end eventually bloom like three petals of a golden flower.</p>

    <p>He would look like he was wearing colored contact lenses, and it made him so good-looking it was a crime.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming remembered seeing the ultimate Heavenly Eye once when he had been playing hide-and-seek with Wang Ling as kids. Seeing it again after all these years, he didn't think that it would make him feel like it had been a lifetime ago.</p>

    <p>In his heart, he was well aware that this memory was tinged with a trace of envy, but it was steeped even more in nostalgia...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was indeed very strong, but looking back on the past, returning to that time when they were kids would be very hard.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming often thought that if he had developed the talisman seal earlier on back then, maybe Wang Ling would have been more outgoing now, or at the very least, he wouldn't be so anti-social.</p>

    <p>"The location of the airdrop is up ahead." Wang Ming pointed out the direction. Previously, Wang Ling hadn't been too attentive in scouting out this desert with his spiritual senses; in fact, it wasn't a completely empty place — it actually had a planned landmark.</p>

    <p>It was a place that looked like ruins and which could only be found in the desert.</p>

    <p>Instead of choosing to directly teleport there, Wang Ling inched closer bit by bit, because he had already smelled the conspiracy in the air from far away.</p>

    <p>There was definitely an ambush waiting at the airdrop's location.</p>

    <p>If he teleported suddenly, this type of skill would look like a bug in the system, and it would be bad if someone reported it as an anomaly!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>As far as one could tell, the ruins were surrounded by broken stone walls which were very high. Contained inside were giant stone arrangements and several ancient stone temples.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming chose to steer clear of the front of the ruins, and instead moved along the side. The front was brightly lit, and walking in the sun would grab too much attention. A huge stone wall ran down the side, and it was a good decision to enter the location from the shadow which the wall cast.</p>

    <p>But just as they approached their target, Wang Ming immediately stopped when he noticed a red dot on the radar, which showed that someone was behind the stone wall. "That brother up ahead, come out. I can already see you!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling really couldn't help swearing in his heart. This radar truly defied the heavens!</p>

    <p>The person behind the stone wall actually had concealed himself very well. Wang Ling thought that if it had been anyone else passing by, they might have never sensed that there was a person hidden here.</p>

    <p>After a brief moment, Chen Chao stepped out from behind the stone wall. "Second brother, you're awesome, I hid myself so well, but you could still find me!"</p>

    <p>"So it was you."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming stared at the cushion in Chen Chao's hands with an astonished expression. "Is this... a hassock?"</p>

    <p>"Yep; what's more, it's an eighth-grade hassock!"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao smiled. "I found it when I was looking for all of you. I was able to sense second brother's aura from far away."</p>

    <p>"Your luck's pretty good, you managed to pick up the eighth-grade hassock so quickly." Wang Ming looked astonished because this was the top perception-type magic treasure in this survival contest. The students here were all at the Foundation Establishment stage, so the perception range of their spiritual senses was limited. However, as long as they were sitting on this hassock when they were using their spiritual senses, their perception range could be expanded up to fifty times! With this eighth-grade hassock, it was like having a portable radar.</p>

    <p>"Have you seen anyone else?" Wang Ming asked.</p>

    <p>"I came from the outskirts, and saw a few people on my way here. Most of them are now moving around in groups. I haven't seen Su Xiao or Guo Hao, who knows where those two went running off to," Chen Chao answered honestly. "By the way... do you need anything? I picked up a lot of things along the way."</p>

    <p>Saying this, he took out a small golden silk bag, startling Wang Ming once again. "Eighth-grade storage bag? Where did you find this?"</p>

    <p>This was the magic treasure with the largest storage capacity in the entire survival contest. In order to survive long enough in this competition, it was essential to find a magic treasure with a huge storage space. The larger the storage space, the more supplies that could be collected and stored away during the competition.</p>

    <p>Staring at the eighth-grade storage bag, Wang Ming couldn't help sucking in a sharp breath.</p>

    <p>This guy's luck was too good, it was simply ouqimanman <sup>1</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>('Ouqimanman' just means
someone is ridiculously,
fantastically lucky.)</dfn>

    <p>"I just picked up stuff on the road that people overlooked."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao scratched his head and said a little bashfully, "On the way here, I came across two groups of people fighting each other. It seemed like the Xiao clan disciple from Shenye High School had accidentally killed his teammates in an explosion. Then a bunch of girls with knives were chasing another guy from Shenye High School."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming frowned: "Was it infighting?"</p>

    <p>"Didn't seem like it. It looked like a relationship problem." Chen Chao thought for a moment, then said with some surprise, "I think I heard someone call that boy Brother Cheng <sup>2</sup> ..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This refers to the character
Makoto Itou from the anime
"School Days" who slept
around a lot ..)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
