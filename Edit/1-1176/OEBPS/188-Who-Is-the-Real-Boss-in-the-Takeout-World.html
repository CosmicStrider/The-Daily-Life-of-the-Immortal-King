  <h1>Chapter 188 Who Is the Real Boss in the Takeout World? </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Before Wang Ling was about to fight Devil Emperor Gua Pi, a figure of an old Taoist in white appeared in front of this luxury apartment.</p>

    <p>After a close encounter with "Killer Taoist" in Lord Diulei's Wenxian Garden villa, Third Saint had been looking up a lot of information on the sly.</p>

    <p>He had discovered that the killer reputed to be the most savage killer in the murder industry was actually a chivalrous man whose heart burst with righteousness. Everyone who had died violently by his hand had all been heinous ruffians. The more despicable they were, the more violent their deaths after Killer Taoist had caught them.</p>

    <p>To his dismay, Third Saint realized that while he had been imitating this great senior in the murder industry for many years, there was unexpectedly a huge problem with the direction he had taken in his mimicry!</p>

    <p>An idol was very powerful!</p>

    <p>Thus, after officially skipping out on his job with Mo Immortal Castle, he had been looking for an opportunity to uphold justice as a way of wiping clean the crimes that he had committed all these years.</p>

    <p>Following the location on his phone, Third Saint stood at the entrance to a Green Orange <sup>1</sup> luxury apartment in Jinghua city.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Green Orange or Qingcheng is a Chinese brand name.)</dfn>

    <p>Based on the news on TV, he had investigated the location where the deliveryman had disappeared and had found himself here. According to the position given on his phone, the closest location to the coordinates was the convenience mart in the basement of this apartment building.</p>

    <p>Third Saint was about to go in when the same security guard from before stopped him at the entrance and said, "Sir, if you are here to look for someone, the owner has to call our security office first before you can enter."</p>

    <p>Third Saint scratched his head. "Then, can an owner enter directly?"</p>

    <p>"Of course..." The security guard nodded and stared warily at him, thinking that this remark was familiar somehow.</p>

    <p>Third Saint nodded, then took out his phone and tapped on the screen a few times before he showed the security guard a list of online purchases. "Can I enter now?"</p>

    <p>"..." The security guard was completely dumbstruck.</p>

    <p>Because this old Taoist in white had unexpectedly bought the entire building! This was the third phase of the Green Orange luxury apartments, and there were three apartment buildings in total. Before the second building had been completed, the first one had already been purchased!</p>

    <p>The little security guard was utterly stunned... were the nouveau riche nowadays so common?! And yet he was still a single dog who didn't even have time to look for a girlfriend as he struggled on the bottom rung of society and served the people all day long!</p>

    <p>Glaring at the receding figure of the old Taoist in white, the little security guard clenched his fists in extreme grief and indignation.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya crouched down in an inconspicuous little corner not far from the convenience mart. He had already ground the materials he had brought into powder, and he blended them in even proportions inside a transparent pharmaceutical glass receptacle. "Congeal!"</p>

    <p>As he gave a soft shout, he generated a ball of spirit light in his hands. The powder in the glass vessel then visibly and rapidly congealed into a sticky substance; in this way, the soul-gathering incense was done.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya held the glass vessel in his right hand and slivers of flame emerged in his palm. After he was done, he released a soft breath. "It's been warmed up; all we have to do now is wait for the wronged ghosts to come. I wonder how Senior Ling is doing..."</p>

    <p>This gray-haired youth lifted his beautiful eyes and looked in the direction that Wang Ling had gone in; there was still no movement from that side, so it was obvious that the fight hadn't started yet.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, it was only a handful of seconds after the soul-gathering incense had been lit when it got a reaction. Immortal Toya opened his Heavenly Eye and instantly saw faint green wisps coming from every direction to gather in a cloud as they followed the scent of the soul-gathering incense.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya opened the big gourd on his back. "Little brothers, don't be nervous. Your souls may have already left your bodies, but as long as you enter my gourd, I can guarantee that your souls won't be extinguished, and you might be able to return to a corporeal body again in the future..."</p>

    <p>Actually, he wasn't really very confident when he said this. Returning a soul to a body sounded easy, but it wasn't so simple to carry out. Each soul had a particular level of compatibility with a body. From a scientific point of view, it was just like finding a bone marrow match. If the compatibility wasn't high enough, it wouldn't be long before the body exploded â€” it wasn't as simple as legend made it sound like, that any body would do.</p>

    <p>"Can Exalted Immortal see us?!" Instantly, ten or so ghosts nearby floated over, and when they saw Immortal Toya, who had opened his Heavenly Eye, they acted as if they had been granted amnesty.</p>

    <p>Looking at these ghosts, Immortal Toya asked, "Are you all the deliverymen who were murdered recently?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, Exalted Immortal... that evil demon in the convenience mart was too quick and knocked me down as soon as the door was opened. If it had been a one-on-one fight, how could the other party be my opponent?" said a ghost in a thick northeastern accent.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "...Why are there so few of you? The news outside reported thirty-two people in total missing."</p>

    <p>"Exalted Immortal, you don't know, but in the last few days, quite a number of brothers floated out carelessly, and wound up being directly burned to nothing by the sun. These days, we've been floating around in the basement and we got to know one another. We've started calling each other by the takeout we deliver; it's easier to remember," the northeastern delivery ghost spread its hands and said.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "..."</p>

    <p>"Exalted Immortal, can the gourd really preserve our souls?" a ghost asked. "I'm Power Chicken <sup>2</sup>. I only just delivered the chicken here when I was knocked down... sure enough, there are still perverts around nowadays who can't even afford to eat chicken. It's really impossible to defend yourself against this type of people!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Power Chicken is famous for its fried chicken cutlets.)</dfn>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya sighed. "This gourd is a magic weapon which I have refined. It contains a small world inside, and everyone can stay in it for the time being. Wait for us to find a way to restore your bodies. Of course, in the meantime, we may need to trouble you to come out and point out your murderer."</p>

    <p>"Since Exalted Immortal has said so, it won't be a problem!"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya nodded. "Mm, then everyone register first before entering my gourd in single file."</p>

    <p>Ghost: "I have a question, Exalted Immortal!"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "Speak..."</p>

    <p>Ghost: "Actually there is still one Yang's Braised Chicken Rice brother whose life now hangs in the balance. We think that he has probably been imprisoned by that demon in the convenience mart. Lord Exalted Immortal, if you can help us save him, we would be forever grateful!"</p>

    <p>"I never expected all of you to have such close relationships with each other." Immortal Toya sighed. "Rest assured. The one standing at the entrance to the convenience mart is our great senior in the cultivation world whom we specially asked to come and deal with this matter."</p>

    <p>"Thank you, Exalted Immortal! Thank you, Exalted Immortal!"</p>

    <p>As soon as the ghost had finished thanking him, three more clouds of green mist immediately floated over from the side, and shoulder to shoulder, the four ghosts began to introduce themselves one by one.</p>

    <p>"Hello, Exalted Immortal, I'm Lanzhou Hand-Pulled Noodles."</p>

    <p>"I'm Shaxian Delicacies."</p>

    <p>"I'm Guilin Rice Noodles."</p>

    <p>"Exalted Immortal, may I ask, does your small world have a presidential suite? Give me, Chongqing Chicken Pot <sup>3</sup>, some face..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(The dishes mentioned here are all well-known Chinese food specialties.)</dfn>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "..."</p>
