  <h1>Chapter 1001 Fang Xing's Idol Burden</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In the Palace of Mirrors' Songhai city, Fang Xing was being held captive in an underground research institute in some unknown location.</p>

    <p>The strong containment magic array set up in the underground institute suppressed Fang Xing's spiritual energy and prevented him from acting freely; it was as if this underground institute had been specially built for him.</p>

    <p>But Bai Youquan, who had brought him here, didn't treat him disdainfully at all. The room was decorated in Fang Xing's favorite European style and had massive French windows. Although it was underground, he could adjust the holographic view outside the windows according to his preference.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing's dinner tonight was a kun steak, cut from the meatiest part of an ancient vicious kun's belly and well done, and blood wine brewed with the fresh blood of a qiongqi. The wine smelled strongly of strawberries, which was the mark of genuine qiongqi blood.</p>

    <p>Although Fang Xing had never had food made from ancient vicious beasts, he had learned of them from ancient texts.</p>

    <p>But these culinary delicacies did nothing to improve his mood; on the contrary, his expression turned increasingly heavy.</p>

    <p>The strength of the person behind the scenes already far surpassed his imagination.</p>

    <p>To turn vicious beasts already long extinct into food was astonishing to Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>While he was pondering as he was held captive in a room inside the institute, a large, high-tech door slowly opened.</p>

    <p>"What's the matter, Classmate Fang? You seem down? Your father was brought back to life in this world, you should be happy." With a smile, Bai Youquan clapped his hands.</p>

    <p>A slim man with delicate and pretty features and white hair that fell to this waist was pushed forward by two black shadow men. He wore a white long gown, and scales glittered on his neck.</p>

    <p>"Dad?" Fang Xing was emotional.</p>

    <p>But the expression of the man in front of him was completely unruffled. He looked at Fang Xing as if he was a stranger.</p>

    <p>"Your father's memories were altered after he was resurrected. He didn't even witness your birth. To him, you're just an egg - he has no impression of you at all. Even if he's been resurrected, you're nothing but a stranger to him." Bai Youquan laughed coldly and said telepathically, "But thanks to your father's research, we are at long last starting to see results in our own research. We're having a celebratory feast tonight, so I won't take your father away. You can use this time now for some father-and-son bonding."</p>

    <p>After speaking, Bai Youquan straightaway took the black shadow men with him and left.</p>

    <p>He was very confident in his arrangement.</p>

    <p>Even if the two of them were related by blood, he wasn't worried at all.</p>

    <p>How much could blood ties be worth?</p>

    <p>Didn't his own dad Bai Zhe use him as a dumbbell when he was a kid...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>For a long while, the room was utterly silent.</p>

    <p>True Immortal She Pi found a place to sit, his posture dignified and his manner demure.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing had never seen his father's real appearance before. What he had seen was mostly in historical texts, and practically all of them were portraits. Fang Xing never expected his father to actually be so good-looking, unlike some famous figures like Zhu Yuanzhang<sup>1</sup>, whose face was shaped like a shoehorn... The artist who had drawn his father's portrait back then must have belonged to the abstract school of art.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup></sup>(First Ming dynasty emperor.)</dfn>

    <p>From his father's appearance, he was indeed a lot younger after being resurrected than Fang Xing had imagined; this was probably what his father had looked like when he was young.</p>

    <p>"Dad..." Fang Xing called out tentatively.</p>

    <p>Next to him, True Immortal She Pi looked alarmed. "Young man, don't randomly call anyone 'dad.'"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing: "But you really are my father. Didn't you hear what that person just said..."</p>

    <p>True Immortal She Pi blushed. "Don't try to trick me. I... I never married, how could I have a son?"</p>

    <p>It was as Bai Youquan had said: True Immortal She Pi had practically no impression of Fang Xing after his memories were tampered with; he didn't even remember spitting out an egg.</p>

    <p>"Do you truly remember nothing?" Fang Xing coaxed him patiently. "Back then, you gave birth to a male ball! That was me!"</p>

    <p>"M- male ball..."</p>

    <p>Actually, the male ball referred to the egg, but saying he gave birth to a male ball sounded a lot better.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing just never thought that these words would make his father's expression change. "Young man, what kind of joke is that? I am a man - how can I possibly give birth to a child? There is no freak in the world who can do that! Are you mocking me? I may look like this, but I'm a man! In all the cultivation research I've done, there isn't a spell that can make a man bear children!"</p>

    <p>"..." Fang Xing was silent.</p>

    <p>He had no idea at all how to explain this.</p>

    <p>This was because back when True Immortal She Pi had given birth to him, his father's body indeed hadn't gone through any sort of transformation. To be precise, it had been an instinctual response to propagate. The unique White Night Spell immortal technique which they cultivated had a particular ability, which was to automatically and magically back up cells when their lives were in danger.</p>

    <p>Just before death, the White Night Spell would recombine the best cells that had been put aside, which would grow inside the body and finally form an egg; the truth was that this egg was a massive cell formed from non-stop cell reproduction in the body!</p>

    <p>It was very obvious that True Immortal She Pi didn't remember anything about the White Night Spell, likely because his memories had been tampered with.</p>

    <p>In his view, Fang Xing was a strange young man who randomly called other people "dad."</p>

    <p>So young... what a pity that he was an oddball!</p>

    <p>And thus, Fang Xing got a headache.</p>

    <p>This was a situation that was hard to deal with.</p>

    <p>First of all, tampering with memories didn't mean memory loss. Before True Immortal She Pi was resurrected, Bai Youquan had somehow completely erased that part of his memory. That was to say, he had been reborn without that particular memory, and retrieving it would be a lot more complicated than dealing with memory loss.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing sighed and stared at True Immortal She Pi's face as all sorts of solutions flew through his mind. He couldn't use any spells since his magic was restricted, so he had to think of a tangible way to prove his relationship to True Immortal She Pi.</p>

    <p>No choice...</p>

    <p>Fang Xing realized that now was the time to drop his idol burden.</p>

    <p>In front of True Immortal She Pi, he opened his mouth wide.</p>

    <p>It was a snake's mouth!</p>

    <p>It could open up to a 180-degree angle!</p>

    <p>He had never shown anyone this ability before! But today, for his father's sake, he decided he would do whatever it took!..</p>
