  <h1>Chapter 1033 An Era Which Emphasizes Looks</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was very clear... that this wasn't Lin Shiyao's first time doing this. She was very open about it, though - helping other people with their homework was originally a job behind the scenes, but the girl was unexpectedly not shy at all about taking orders in the canteen.</p>

    <p>Actually, Lin Shiyao would have holed up in her own dorm room as usual, had it not been for the serial murders this time, which had led to the express deliveries needing to be physically sent to the campus. She took this job extremely seriously, because the number of orders she took every summer and winter holiday helped her earn sixty to seventy times more money than her school scholarships. Not only could she cover her tuition fees and even some of her living expenses herself, she was able to reap in a huge amount of additional funds through this winter and summer holiday homework ghostwriting business.</p>

    <p>Helping to do someone else's homework by mutual consent and with the prices clearly stated wasn't against the law. Even if the police knew about it, they couldn't do anything. Usually, even parents would come over themselves to pay Lin Shiyao to do their children's homework when the latter couldn't complete it... In the business of ghostwriting holiday homework, Lin Shiyao could be said to be a big boss.</p>

    <p>As for why she was the boss, this was very obvious...</p>

    <p>Lin Shiyao took out the QR code. Seeing that Xiao Yin and Er Ha were still hesitating, she placed it on the table casually. She never stopped working, and instead spoke to someone behind her as she wrote. "I'm busy right now. Help me entertain these guests."</p>

    <p>"Yes!" someone behind her quickly replied.</p>

    <p>Only then did Xiao Yin realize that Lin Shiyao actually had helpers... There were ten tables full of university students doing homework behind her.</p>

    <p>So, this ghostwriting homework gang was actually pretty big?</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was stupefied when he saw this.</p>

    <p>This was a team which Lin Shiyao had specially hired. She came up with this business idea since ordinary university students didn't have her sort of reputation and couldn't draw in as many orders. Using her own work foundation every year, she would charge an additional order and distribute it to other college students. She would just sign share agreements with them, and only take thirty percent of the cost of the homework task as a broker fee.</p>

    <p>Thus, in this way, Lin Shiyao's team continued to expand.</p>

    <p>There were four people to a table in the canteen, and as many as ten tables, so fully forty people were working under Lin Shiyao.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, to ensure the homework's quality, Lin Shiyao even divided it up so that some people would be responsible for doing the literary homework in particular, and some for the Dao talismans course. Those who were proficient in alchemy skills or spirit sword techniques were responsible for doing the supplementary homework - there was even an outdoor film crew that could cosplay to look like employers and which specialized in filming videos to complete the extra-curricular practicums which some schools had.</p>

    <p>"How many fragments?" Xiao Yin gave Er Ha a meaningful glance and asked telepathically.</p>

    <p>"There are at least six fragments here..." Er Ha replied.</p>

    <p>A lot of people hired Lin Shiyao. Since a large amount of homework in the city was concentrated around Lin Shiyao, this saved Xiao Yin and Er Ha a lot of hassle.</p>

    <p>"There's something we hope you can help us with."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin crouched down and smiled gently.</p>

    <p>Er Ha jumped onto a canteen chair and sat down obediently, wagging its tail as it gazed at Lin Shiyao.</p>

    <p>Miss Lin glanced at Xiao Yin and Er Ha, but didn't stop working. The person behind her who had initially put his work aside to receive guests saw that Xiao Yin had come looking for Lin Shiyao specifically, so he sat back down silently.</p>

    <p>"Unfortunately, I'm very busy now. If you're asking about the serial murders, I have no comment. A police officer with the surname Gao already questioned me; I don't want to repeat myself." Lin Shiyao was someone who liked being efficient.</p>

    <p>A police officer with the surname Gao? Xiao Yin was blank.</p>

    <p>It appeared that Gao Tian had been here to question the students about the murders.</p>

    <p>But that wasn't what Xiao Yin and Er Ha were here for. Xiao Yin sat down patiently in front of Miss Lin.</p>

    <p>What Xiao Yin had was time, and he could wait. There were as many as six fragments here, when their job today initially was to collect five.</p>

    <p>As a result, when Xiao Yin sat down, Lin Shiyao feel uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>She was an innocent, single woman from a good family, helping people to ghostwrite homework in the clear light of day, and a handsome guy had actually sat down opposite her to watch her write... This was something Lin Shiyao had never experienced before.</p>

    <p>She was somewhat a celebrity at Magic Treasure Development University. When Xiao Yin sat down in front of her and watched her do homework, the atmosphere felt strange.</p>

    <p>"Wow, who's that silver-haired young man? He's very handsome... and has a green-furred dog?"</p>

    <p>"He isn't Lin Shiyao's boyfriend, is he? I always thought she was abstinent."</p>

    <p>"Holy shit, big news! Lin Shiyao actually has a boyfriend..."</p>

    <p>(The above are all Lin Shiyao's delusions...)</p>

    <p>Lin Shiyao shook her head hard. She felt that if this went on, she would end up hearing things that weren't there.</p>

    <p>"What are you doing?" After a few minutes, Lin Shiyao finally stopped working under Xiao Yin's bright and innocent smile.</p>

    <p>Quality customer service always came first. Xiao Yin sitting here and staring at her already made Lin Shiyao feel that she couldn't work normally. However, she just couldn't get angry with Xiao Yin. Actually, most female university students liked the "little milk dog <sup>1</sup> " type, and Xiao Yin just so happened to fit the bill. His smile made one feel refreshed, and could even erase most of the shadows in one's heart.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(It refers to boys who are like puppies, i.e. cute, playful and clingy ..)</dfn>

    <p>When Lin Shiyao raised her head to look at Xiao Yin, she felt as if she was sitting in front of a small sun: it was warm and gentle, and wasn't glaring. It made people want to reach out and touch it, and they wouldn't be burned.</p>

    <p>"Are you finally willing to talk to me?" Xiao Yin continued to smile.</p>

    <p>"Don't say such misleading things... Just say what you want..." Lin Shiyao blushed and immediately lowered her head.</p>

    <p>This scene made Er Ha very envious. Sure enough, it was good to look attractive! Who knew when it would be able to take on a human form... Er Ha stared at Xiao Yin's human form and pondered. It was constantly worried that its human form would be ugly; it had even dreamt countless times that when it took on a human form, its skin and even its hair were green, the type that was fluorescent at night... It was a green color that would give even the Hulk a run for his money.</p>

    <p>If it was too ugly, Er Ha didn't think it would be able to accept it.</p>

    <p>After adapting to life in the human world, Er Ha actually realized that it, too, had an idol burden, and moreover, it understood the importance of looks.</p>

    <p>This was an era which emphasized looks!</p>

    <p>If you had a very attractive face, you could rid yourself of a lot of worries...</p>
