  <h1>Chapter 1085 Flowers Might Bloom Again, But A Person Will Never Be Young Again</h1>

  <div>

    <p>According to general survey data in Huaxiu nation, the number of single cultivators in the country was increasing year by year. Currently, there were already more than one billion single people, and this was just for Huaxiu; when it came to the whole world, the number of single people might be even more extreme.</p>

    <p>A more detailed investigation revealed all sorts of reasons for why they were single.</p>

    <p>Based on poll results, the top three reasons people remained single were... 
    
    </p><p>1) Addicted to staying single.</p> 
    
    <p>2) Unwilling to settle for second best.</p> 
    
    <p>3) Realms and strength weren't compatible, so it wasn't a good match.</p>

    <p>The first reason, which was the one with the most votes, was actually pretty easy to explain.</p>

    <p>Addicted to staying single.</p>

    <p>After a person was single for a long time, they would indeed become used to the single life, and thus would develop a mental aversion to being in a relationship. This was a psychological thing, especially when a person became older and passed the adolescent age of being easily agitated - they were even less likely to be hot-blooded and impulsive about relationships. After they grew up, the social environment caused them to have complicated feelings about their younger years. Even if they decided to get into a relationship, they would still take many factors into consideration.</p>

    <p>So rather than being bogged down by the details, they might as well not bother with a relationship...</p>

    <p>When it came to dating, you spent a lot more, your freedom was compressed to a certain extent, and your everything would be shared with your other half.</p>

    <p>People who weren't used to these inconveniences would rather be single. Over time, they would realize that being single was really good! This was especially true of those with failed relationships - they felt that being single was much more comfortable.</p>

    <p>The second reason was that they were unwilling to settle for second best.</p>

    <p>It was actually very easy to understand this reason.</p>

    <p>After all, as long as they were bothered to maintain their physique and appearance, cultivators could look forever young. When female cultivators didn't have to worry about their looks fading with age, they were naturally even more hopeful of finding their Mr Right. The same was true of male cultivators, who felt that they could wait for something better; they believed they could find their fated person, and so were unwilling to settle for second best.</p>

    <p>And so, both male and female cultivators would dilly-dally for longer and longer, until they finally became addicted to being single...</p>

    <p>As for the third reason in the poll, it was in fact pretty easy to understand.</p>

    <p>Matchmaking had been a thing since ancient times.</p>

    <p>But in a cultivation world, matchmaking didn't simply refer to equal material things - compatible realms were also very important. According to marriage laws in the cultivation world, the gap between two cultivators couldn't be more than two different realms. For example, Golden Core cultivators couldn't date cultivators at the Body Condensation stage or above the Soul Formation stage.</p>

    <p>This was because if the gap between realms was too large, problems might easily occur when two cultivators started dating.</p>

    <p>For cultivators, age was no longer an issue when it came to dating. Even if it was a difference of a few hundred years, it was acceptable as long as they liked each other. However, they still had to abide by the rule about realms.</p>

    <p>Accidents had occurred before, when cultivators who didn't listen to advice started dating despite the large realm difference.</p>

    <p>Like the kiss of death...</p>

    <p>There was once a case of a Soul Formation cultivator who fell in love with a Body Condensation cultivator, but because the difference in realms was so large, the Soul Formation cultivator sucked out the tongue of the Body Condensation cultivator when they kissed...</p>

    <p>Hm...</p>

    <p>In short, there were many reasons for remaining single.</p>

    <p>On the way home this time, Wang Ling had mixed feelings.</p>

    <p>Pensive, he looked up information to do with the single people survey on his cell phone.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had his own reasons for considering himself a very sensitive person from a young age.</p>

    <p>It was precisely because of this that he knew what Sun Rong's feelings were...</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, he had actually been deprived of the right to love, based on current marriage laws.</p>

    <p>So instead of thinking about these impossible things, Wang Ling felt that he might as well focus on the present, study hard, and do his best to find a way to completely control his power.</p>

    <p>Flowers might bloom again, but a person would never be young again.</p>

    <p>The truth was that Wang Ling had long anticipated that many people would confess to him when he was a teenager.</p>

    <p>So, as early as when he was in junior high, he created a spell called Single's Curse, which he cast on himself.</p> 
    
    <p>Note: this spell has no effect on people who are already married.</p>

    <p>The specific way the spell worked was also very simple: If he ran into someone who suddenly wanted to confess to him, the words she said would have nothing to do with what was in her heart at all.</p>

    <p>Since Wang Ling had randomly come up with this spell when he was in junior high, it wasn't free of bugs.</p>

    <p>But this was a passive spell, and Wang Ling couldn't say for sure what the bug was until the effects of the spell were demonstrated after it was cast. Just like for an electronic program, monkey coders had to constantly run tests to discover the holes and fix them bit by bit.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling could only go through junior high with the people around him confessing to him in order to spark the effects of Single's Curse, before he could fill in the gaps of his spell one by one.</p>

    <p>He calculated that after he developed Single's Curse, no less than twenty people had tried to confess to him since junior high, and he had repeatedly tweaked Single's Curse twenty times.</p>

    <p>The glaring holes in the spell had basically already been filled in, and there might still be some minor ones...</p>

    <p>When Sun Rong tried to confess to him just now, that was the twenty-first time that the spell Single's Curse was triggered.</p>

    <p>Sitting in the spirit bus on the way home, Wang Ling sighed. It looked like he would have to keep an eye on Sun Rong's reaction tomorrow.</p>

    <p>He had already refined Single's Curse twenty times, so there should no longer be any major problems with it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling remembered that when Single's Curse was first developed, it had contained a massive bug: after Single's Curse was triggered, a temporary curse would be placed on the person who had confessed... It ultimately turned into an infectious curse spell, and was transmitted in a very simple way: as long as there was skin-to-skin contact, a person would be infected by Single's Curse.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, this spell directly led to an "excellent" atmosphere in Wang Ling's junior high days prior to his graduation: in the whole junior high school, no one started dating, and all the students studied diligently.</p>

    <p>In the end, even the younger school teachers didn't date, and were all obsessed with their teaching jobs.</p>

    <p>The junior high school which Wang Ling had chosen was actually very ordinary - just like his reason for choosing Number 60 High, his biggest objective was to keep a low profile.</p>

    <p>But it was precisely because of Wang Ling's Single's Curse that everyone became obsessed with studying.</p>

    <p>Their junior high school's ranking soared directly from the very bottom all the way to the top three in the entire city.</p>

    <p>The year Wang Ling graduated, an exception had already been made for his junior high as it was upgraded to a key city junior high school...</p>
