  <h1>Chapter 1171 As Expected of You</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Trapped in the sweatshop, Wang Zhen had managed to avoid losing his sense of self because he actually enjoyed the sensation of being beaten...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling couldn't help sucking in a cold breath at such a heaven-defying reason.</p>

    <p>It could only be said, as expected of Wang Zhen; as a man who had suffered all kinds of brutal beatings, he had still managed to survive to this day. For one moment, Wang Ling couldn't help but feel utterly moved by Wang Zhen's experiences.</p>

    <p>There were so many prodigies in the world, and Wang Zhen in fact hadn't been as talented to begin with. However, after enduring beatings from the moment he was born, Wang Zhen's strong desire to live triggered his deeply hidden potential, and he was enlightened bit by bit with every beating...</p>

    <p>That was how Wang Zhen became stronger.</p>

    <p>A person's personality formed at an early age, and was largely influenced by the family environment; Wang Zhen's predisposition toward being beaten probably could no longer be changed in this life.</p>

    <p>In some sense, Wang Ling thought that the bad-tempered young miss of the Liu family and Wang Zhen were quite compatible. Wang Zhen was a meat shield, while Liu Qingyi was naturally short-tempered. Wang Zhen was used to all kinds of beatings since young, and could naturally endure better than an ordinary person. If they got together, this would simply be a harmonious balance of Yin and Yang...</p>

    <p>But feelings couldn't be forced.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling wasn't a matchmaker, and wouldn't meddle with other people's feelings - a relationship should be allowed to take its natural course.</p>

    <p>The next moment, Wang Ling raised his hand to cast a spell and reconstruct this Shadow Image world with his current understanding of Shadow Dao.</p>

    <p>He had to resolve this as soon as possible, and couldn't linger for too long in this Shadow Image world. The longer he tarried, the greater the damage to Gao Tianming's mind.</p>

    <p>After roughly three seconds, Wang Ling snapped his fingers, and all the strings which the puppets in the puppet factory hung from were cleanly cut. After that, everyone's bodies turned into light particles that quickly vanished.</p>

    <p>Everything happened extremely fast, and in the blink of an eye, Wang Zhen had already returned to reality. All the rescued students were lying in neat order on the ground. There was a huge difference in pressure from the change in worlds, and it felt like there wasn't enough oxygen on the way back, which was the main reason why these students were unconscious.</p>

    <p>Hence, Wang Zhen was the only one awake.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Ling had one hand on Gao Tianming's forehead as the latter knelt on the ground and cried out in pain, but there was no one else around to hear his hoarse and gut-wrenching cries.</p>

    <p>A few minutes later, Wang Ling pulled out a black shadow which reeked of evil from Gao Tianming's body. Under Wang Ling's direction, it hovered around his fingertips before gradually converging into a black ball the size of an egg in the center of his palm.</p>

    <p>Finally, Wang Ling flipped his hand and pressed down. On the side, Wang Zhen saw several golden chains stretch out of thin air to firmly secure the black ball before dragging it into some space.</p>

    <p>The seal was complete!</p>

    <p>"Heavenly Dao Lock!" Wang Zhen recognized these chains, which originated from the power of the six main Heavenly Dao. Wang Zhen had always known that Wang Ling was very strong and was in a different dimension of power altogether, but he was still shocked by the appearance of the Heavenly Dao Lock.</p>

    <p>It wasn't uncommon for people to possess Heavenly Dao nowadays; in the Domain of the Gods in particular, there were as many people who could use Heavenly Dao as hairs on an ox.</p>

    <p>But knowing how to use Heavenly Dao and comprehending Heavenly Dao were two different things. No one with Heavenly Dao would ever dare say that they comprehended it...</p>

    <p>There were innumerable profound mysteries in Heavenly Dao; one universe contained three thousand Heavenly Dao, and ten universes contained thirty thousand Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>It already wasn't easy for a person to spend their whole life pursuing and seeing into the profound mystery of one Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>As for the so-called Heavenly Dao Lock...</p>

    <p>It was actually a symbol - a symbol of the complete rule and control over the power of Heavenly Dao...</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren, who on earth are you..." Wang Zhen started to feel curious about Wang Ling's identity.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>But the truth was that even Wang Ling himself didn't know who he was... Who the hell knew why he was so strong? And the scariest part was he wasn't someone reborn - he didn't have any such "rebirth" setting on him!</p>

    <p>Seeing that Wang Ling didn't say anything, Wang Zhen knew he might have offended him, and thus quit asking questions. However, he still had some doubts about Gao Tianming. "Why didn't Ling Zhenren just directly eliminate this evil rather than seal it?"</p>

    <p>A seal.</p>

    <p>This was currently the best solution Wang Ling could come up with.</p>

    <p>He explained the situation to Wang Zhen telepathically.</p>

    <p>Gao Tianming's case was more unusual. He had merged so closely with Shadow Dao that if his Shadow Image was destroyed outright, he would also die. A seal was thus the safest way. In addition, Gao Tianming himself wouldn't be affected by the seal; it was the same as him having his ability confiscated so that he could no longer use the power of Shadow Dao.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, after rescuing everyone, the first thing Wang Ling did was to use the Great Memory Spell to completely replace everyone's memories that had to do with Shadow Dao.</p>

    <p>Gao Tianming was essentially also a victim.</p>

    <p>He couldn't be considered inherently evil - it was just that someone had deliberately taken advantage of his fierce competitive streak and ambition.</p>

    <p>The important thing now was to ferret out the mastermind behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had initially planned to take things as they came and wait and see, since based on his past experience, someone would definitely show up to upset this national competition. He had never expected, however, for the culprit to actually make use of Wang Nuan's power of Shadow Dao.</p>

    <p>This immediately gave Wang Ling a sense of danger.</p>

    <p>The power of Shadow Dao was still unstable, and its misuse could lead to a massive and devastating crisis...</p>

    <p>Making use of his little sister, who had yet to be born, to do evil was something that Wang Ling wouldn't forgive no matter what.</p>

    <p>"I need your help." At that moment, he turned his eyes to Wang Zhen.</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren, please speak." Wang Zhen was full of reverence.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's task for him was quite simple: He wanted Wang Zhen to act like a human radar to check if there were other participants in this competition who had the power of Shadow Dao.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had more or less finished studying Shadow Dao, but was worried that the power would be uncontrollable if he used it himself. So, the best way was for Wang Zhen to check things out in his place.</p>

    <p>"I will do my duty." Wang Zhen agreed without any hesitation.</p>

    <p>There was no need for Wang Zhen to eat a frozen dumpling or whatnot; Wang Ling simply poked him lightly in the forehead.</p>

    <p>In the next breath, it was as if the shadow under Wang Zhen's feet was imbued with magic as it started to take visible shape and finally turned into a human Shadow Image form.</p>

    <p>A normal Shadow Image was human in shape.</p>

    <p>This was a brawny man with great muscle tone and who was only wearing a pair of white pants. Apart from that, he was distinctively wrapped from head to toe in layers and layers of rope.</p>

    <p>This was Wang Zhen's unique Shadow Image, called: Bound Man...</p>

    <p>After getting a clear look at this Shadow Image's appearance, Wang Ling sighed in his heart once again: As expected of you!</p>
