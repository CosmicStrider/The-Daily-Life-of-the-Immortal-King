  <h1>Chapter 1084 You Should Know Your Place</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling could of course deliberately choose the wrong options, but he knew that if he chose the correct answer, this bunch of bros wouldn't be able to help charging down through the ceiling.</p>

    <p>And so, with the collapse of the ceiling, the one-on-one tutoring session which had just started, came to a stop.</p>

    <p>The room was swamped with bodyguards from Huaguo Water Curtain Group and a bunch of school security guards led by Old Li as soon as they received word. The commotion had been so loud that the school guards and bodyguards thought that there had been an explosion in the classroom, and they had immediately panicked. Carried anti-explosive magic treasures, they poured into the classroom, and it was packed with people in an instant. Wang Ling and Sun Rong were crammed together in the center of the crowd and couldn't budge an inch.</p>

    <p>Everything only calmed down over ten minutes later.</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong was still on the night shift at school and marking test papers. He chastised those boys severely for damaging school property.</p>

    <p>"Troublemakers!" Lao Gudong glared at these boys from other classes.</p>

    <p>They were Senior Grade Three students and were Wang Ling and Sun Rong's seniors. Thus, the essence of the spells they cast was purer as well as more destructive. Although Number 60 High wasn't a city key high school at the moment, its students this time were better than previous batches.</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong knew some of the boys; one of them was even a member of the student union. Now that they had committed an offense, however, Lao Gudong would naturally treat them all equally and strictly.</p>

    <p>A student leader who had erred would usually receive heavier punishment.</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong swept his gaze over them and deliberately lowered his voice. Honestly speaking, he wasn't used to being the bad guy. "Do you know how dangerous your behavior was... Without prior instructions from a teacher, you are forbidden to use magic in the school building. Isn't this written in the rules in the high school student handbook? Did you memorize the rule or not when you started school?!"</p>

    <p>The school building was made from special construction materials, and it absolutely wasn't a shoddy job. As long as magic wasn't involved, it was basically impossible to damage the walls and floors of the school building. Lao Gudong could thus tell that these boys had most likely used some sort of trick.</p>

    <p>A boy stepped forward. "Lao Gudong... I just gathered some power together."</p>

    <p>"So? The Power Gathering Spell is also magic!" Lao Gudong glared at this quibbling student. "You! Give me a 5,000-word self-reflection by tomorrow!"</p>

    <p>"Ah?" The boy felt a bit wronged.</p>

    <p>"So we can't gather strength, but Classmates Wang Ling and Sun Rong are allowed to dual cultivate?"</p>

    <p>"You, a 10,000-word reflection!" The corners of Lao Gudong's mouth twitched as he stared at this student.</p>

    <p>"Why?" The second boy refused to accept it.</p>

    <p>"Because of your dirty thoughts! They were having an academic discussion!" Lao Gudong showed the boys the multiple choice question which Wang Ling had just done, and they lowered their heads.</p>

    <p>They couldn't do anything but take the blame.</p>

    <p>Their thinking had indeed been dirty.</p>

    <p>"They are now in the second half of Senior Grade One; it's very normal for them to take extra lessons after school together. As for all of you, you're already in Senior Grade Three. Your energy should be focused on your studies!" Lao Gudong looked at those boys and said meaningfully, "As students, you should know your place."</p>

    <p>The Grade Three students: "..."</p>

    <p>"I don't care whether you did wrong or not. In any case, you're at fault right now. Since you're wrong, you have to change! As for how to change, that's your problem! Find your own reasons..."</p>

    <p>Bombarded with Ming's Principle<sup>1</sup>, these male students finally surrendered.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(From when actor Huang Xiaoming joined the Chinese reality show "Chinese Restaurant," and was criticized for his overbearing and unreasonable behavior when he acted as head chef ..)</dfn>

    <p>"Alright, teacher... we were wrong... We shouldn't have stayed back after school and gone upstairs to eavesdrop on them..."</p>

    <p>"Mm, quite sincere." Lao Gudong nodded his head. "What spells did you use upstairs?"</p>

    <p>"Only the Ground Monitoring Spell and the Power Gathering Spell."</p>

    <p>"What levels are you at with these two spells?"</p>

    <p>"These are compulsory spells, so we usually practice them together. We're already proficient, and will reach level six soon."</p>

    <p>"Oh? The ongoing energy consumption for these two spells isn't small. Don't you feel tired?"</p>

    <p>"We don't, teacher... thank you for thinking of us. Our main task in Grade Three is to improve our endurance with each spell we use, to avoid something like failing to cast spells or create clones during an exam because we don't have enough spirit energy."</p>

    <p>The leader of these Grade Three boys replied in a deferential manner. He spoke in a low voice and with a modest attitude, and thought that he could move Lao Gudong this way so that they could avoid being punished.</p>

    <p>But Lao Gudong wasn't buying this trick. Eavesdropping on a study session was a minor issue, but damaging school property was too much. Even if they went without disciplinary punishment, they still had to write the reflection.</p>

    <p>"Oh, if you aren't tired, then each one of you write a 20,000-word reflection. Give it to me tomorrow."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ling was finally able to get away thanks to the classroom ceiling falling down. Usually in a situation like this, most people would think that they didn't need to go to school tomorrow... but the truth was that this was a very foolish and na√Øve notion.</p>

    <p>The school building was made of special restorative clay. With the help of magic, the collapsed ceiling would be restored.</p>

    <p>It was just that it was a little troublesome to clean up the classroom, but this job would naturally be given to the Grade Three boys who had broken the rules.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Ling was walking toward the school gates with his hands in his pockets. Following behind him, Sun Rong was hesitating over the words she wanted to say.</p>

    <p>Since no one was around, Sun Rong felt that this might be a good chance.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling... I..." Finally, she opened her mouth.</p>

    <p>In front, Wang Ling stopped and half-turned to gaze at her, his hands still in his pockets.</p>

    <p>The girl's face was completely red, as if she was restraining herself. The words were clearly already on the tip of the tongue, but she just didn't have the courage to say them.</p>

    <p>One reason for this had to do with her personality; she had been doted on since young, and had calmly rejected countless suitors. She never thought that there would be a day when she would understand what it felt like to be rejected.</p>

    <p>Would she feel lost?</p>

    <p>Or full of utter despair?</p>

    <p>It might be both...</p>

    <p>It was for this very reason that right at that moment, Sun Rong felt herself being caught up in the vortex known as youth. She didn't know if this was love, but she was certain that this might be what it felt like to like someone.</p>

    <p><em>Sun Rong...</em></p>

    <p><em>You can do it...</em></p>

    <p><em>You have to say it!</em></p>

    <p><em>Say it in a loud voice!</em></p>

    <p><em>Tell the young man in front of you everything that you're feeling!</em></p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling!"</p>

    <p>The girl plucked up her courage and said again, "I..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "???"</p>

    <p>"I..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"I... I also think crispy noodle snacks taste good!"</p>

    <p>"Mm..." Wang Ling nodded and sighed with relief inwardly. Turning back around, he started off for home without looking back.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's heart was crushed at that moment.</p>

    <p>She threw her bag to the ground with a "<em>pia</em>" sound!</p>

    <p>Why were the words she said completely different to what was in her heart?!</p>

    <p>Damn it!</p>
