  <h1>Chapter 510 Technique for Using a Silver Bell </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Sometimes the truth was often closer than you could imagine. Even Xiao Yin himself never expected that the truth he had been painstakingly searching for all these years would actually be so close to him, and could almost be said to be within his grasp.</p>

    <p>"So you're saying that it was President Bai who was the source of the rumors back then which led to the extinction of the holy beasts..." Zhuo Yi was utterly stunned.</p>

    <p>This was an unresolved case which the country had been investigating until now without any breakthroughs. After all, the level of technology back then wasn't as advanced as it was now.</p>

    <p>The rumor that eating the heart of a holy beast could help a person comprehend the Heavenly Dao had spread roughly six thousand years ago, long before the founding of Huaxiu nation. Xiao Yin had only been two thousand years old at the time, a little kid among the holy beasts... When the holy beasts were discovered to be already extinct after the nation's founding, by the time they started to investigate the matter, it was already too late.</p>

    <p>Because it was impossible to trace the source of the rumor.</p>

    <p>But it wasn't the same now; the Internet was more advanced and cultivators had to be responsible for whatever they said on online platforms. As long as you wanted to look for something, you could. It wasn't in fact that hard to track down anonymous users, but that "informant" on the cultivation forum this time obviously knew something and had come prepared; even Little Black was unable to track this person down.</p>

    <p>While Little Black's technology was slightly inferior to Wang Ming's, this thing wasn't impossible for the former.</p>

    <p>If there was anything to be afraid of, it was that the other party might have laid traps.</p>

    <p>In the end, Wang Ling thought that asking Wang Ming to investigate this matter would be more reliable; if even Wang Ming couldn't track down that informant's location, then they were really out of options.</p>

    <p>"If this is true, President Bai's crimes are far worse than that of Cheng Yu, Master of Immortal Mansion, and the old devil." Zhuo Yi tsked; he hadn't expected to run into such a big fish this time. No wonder it was so hard to catch him!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei twirled his pen and said, "Mr Lu, do you have any material evidence to back up your words?"</p>

    <p>"The Wuji Umbrella is evidence. Additionally, Bai Zhe still has many other peculiar magic weapons on him. I'm guessing that these magic weapons might have also been made from holy beasts. If we can take him down, these will all be material evidence."</p>

    <p>At this point, Mr Lu had in fact pretty much told them everything they needed to know. As for drawing President Bai out, Mr Lu had already told Lord Diulei how to do so.</p>

    <p>In fact, even Mr Lu himself didn't know where President Bai resided. The only way he could contact President Bai, apart from using his phone, was with a silver bell. Moreover, this President Bai was very cunning. His cell phone number was different every time, and Mr Lu could only contact him through his phone once a day, after which the number would directly change.</p>

    <p>Mr Lu had already used this when he had been outside the villa entrance earlier. The new number would only be sent to Mr Lu's cell phone at six in the morning the next day.</p>

    <p>Apart from that, if Mr Lu wanted to meet President Bai in person, he had to use this silver bell.</p>

    <p>When Mr Lu handed the silver bell to Lord Diulei, he specifically exhorted the latter, "There's a technique for using this silver bell. You need to ring a specific melody in a specific place before Bai Zhe will show up. The venue we settled on before was the central park."</p>

    <p>"What melody?"</p>

    <p>"Do you know Qiansi Xi? Just play that<sup>1</sup>..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This means 'puppet show,' and refers to a classical Chinese song about the affection between a puppet and its owner ..)</dfn>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After that, Wang Ling used a minor spell to hide the demon qi on Mr Lu and prevent that President Bai from tracking him down. Now that Mr Lu had become an important witness, he needed to be protected, but this didn't mean locking him up somewhere since that would make it easier for President Bai to find him.</p>

    <p>So Lord Diulei had Song Qingshu take Mr Lu to go absorb formaldehyde; probably no one would think of this possibility.</p>

    <p>But just in case, Wang Ling drew three teleportation talismans and gave them to Song Qingshu. Like the name implied, these teleportation talismans would swiftly transport Song Qingshu and Mr Lu to the coordinates of a particular place if they felt that they were in danger. Furthermore, the coordinates were for the Wang family's small villa... If the other party dared follow them there, even if Wang Ling wasn't at home, the gremlins in the villa would be enough to make the intruder suffer.</p>

    <p>Besides, Jingke guarded the villa, so Wang Ling wasn't worried at all.</p>

    <p>"Thank you very much, Ling Zhenren!"</p>

    <p>At the gate of Lord Diulei's villa, Song Qingshu respectfully accepted the talismans.</p>

    <p>After leaving Mo Immortal Castle, Song Qingshu had become more and more like a supervisor under Lord Diulei's guidance. Furthermore, he had an imposing righteous temperament that was clearly displayed on the outside; in fact, he was a promising talent.</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu drove the car. Mr Lu sat in the front passenger seat and was afraid to move, because out of the corner of his eye, he could see Wang Ling looking at him... That mousepad earlier had really scared him! Now, he just wanted to quietly be a virtuous tree, and he completely didn't dare do anything rash...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin stood at the front door and waved. "Good luck, Mr Lu!"</p>

    <p>"I will do my best to purify the air!"</p>

    <p>Mr Lu looked at Xiao Yin resolutely and gave him a thumbs-up.</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu said goodbye once more, then stepped on the gas and left with Mr Lu.</p>

    <p>But with Mr Lu gone, the rest of the pressure now fell completely on Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>If he wanted to catch Bai Zhe, these two days would be the best time to do so since Mr Lu hadn't completed his assignment and his demon qi was now masked. Besides, the longer Bai Zhe and Mr Lu were out of contact, the more suspicious it would look.</p>

    <p>Although President Bai's surname meant "white"...</p>

    <p>It was clear that he was a very suspicious man. In addition, this person had single-handedly engineered the near extermination of all the holy beasts six thousand years ago, so his heart and bones were actually very black.</p>

    <p>"Then, according to the plan we've agreed on, Brother Xiao and I will go meet President Bai tonight. Brother Zhuo Yi, you're responsible for tightening the net in the end!" Lord Diulei said.</p>

    <p>"Then we will have to trouble Senior Immortal." Zhuo Yi nodded.</p>

    <p>"It's fine, it's fine, it's not a big deal." Lord Diulei was very confident since he had the Soul Suppression Ring and so had nothing to fear. As for Xiao Yin, after eating the crispy noodle snack, his fighting strength had been boosted to a lofty level, which could be completely described as devastating.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that it would be more than enough if these two people coordinated together and combined their battle strength to deal with that President Bai.</p>

    <p>According to Mr Lu, President Bai's strength was at True Immortal level, but the damage he could inflict might not necessarily be at the level of a True Immortal. Perhaps the most troublesome part still was that unknown terrifying self-healing ability.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was very curious about this.</p>

    <p>A human cultivator with a self-healing ability beyond that of the Tree clan; how was this possible... infinite health?</p>
