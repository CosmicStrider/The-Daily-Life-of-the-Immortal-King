  <h1>Chapter 868 Wang Ling Opens His Mouth to Speak!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>There was a Cosmic God Tree sapling in the center of each of the ten universes, but the Cosmic God Tree in the seventh universe had the most robust growth. Everything had gotten out of hand in this universe since eight thousand years ago, from the moment Star Monarch Gu Yuan, who was Gu Cheng's father and Gu Shunzhi's grandfather, took a piss there.</p>

    <p>After that...</p>

    <p>Six thousand years ago...</p>

    <p>Five thousand years ago...</p>

    <p>Four thousand years ago...</p>

    <p>More and more people visited the Cosmic God Tree at the center of the seventh universe, and the scariest thing was that if they weren't Dao Masters, then they were Dao Gods... Traveling solo through the universe, they could never find a place to take a piss. This piss contained their primordial qi and couldn't be sprayed just anywhere. Besides, relieving themselves wherever they liked was very impolite!</p>

    <p>Thus, this Cosmic God Tree in the seventh universe became a transfer point for this group of bigwigs on their travels through the cosmos, acting as something like a highway rest stop.</p>

    <p>As it turned out, these bigwigs' holy water was exceedingly rich with nutrition, causing the Cosmic God Tree to grow to such an unprecedented size...</p>

    <p>"Look! His Excellency Ling's barrier is breaking open!"</p>

    <p>The six Great Heavenly Dao had just reviewed the Cosmic God Tree's growth history, when Strength Heavenly Dao suddenly cried out.</p>

    <p>Under their extremely astonished gazes, these golden leaves which looked as frail as cicada wings exhibited the greatest power in front of the barrier. Like the life-threatening mechanism in the film <em>Saw </em>which could cut open a person's guts, the sharp discs formed by the spinning golden leaves cut through and shattered the serious clone's barrier.</p>

    <p>These spinning golden leaves didn't have any strong light effects and didn't even leave a ripple.</p>

    <p>However, with their persistent force, they cut through the rigid barrier.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling frowned inwardly. No one could see how these spinning golden leaves attacked, but Wang Ling could see it clearly with the dynamic vision of his King's Eye.</p>

    <p>The golden leaves of the Cosmic God Tree disintegrated and regenerated to complete the attack.</p>

    <p>The leaves themselves couldn't withstand the barrier's powerful thickness and shattered, but thanks to their formidable vitality, they regenerated to complete the glorious task of cutting the barrier open.</p>

    <p>"He actually broke His Excellency Ling's barrier!" Strength Heavenly Dao tsked. "This is the first time I've seen someone who can cut open His Excellency Ling's barrier. It seems that the leaves of this Cosmic God Tree are indeed unusual. The Cosmic God Tree has acknowledged Gu Shunzhi and made its power available for his use - indeed, there is a reason why he is ranked first of the keeper of orders and oversees three universes."</p>

    <p>Time Heavenly Dao nodded. "Gu Shunzhi's performance indeed isn't bad; it's worthy of a little red flower <sup>1</sup> ."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The equivalent of giving kids a gold star for a job well done..)</dfn>

    <p>As they talked, Gu Shunzhi spread open his slender fingers and summoned back the golden leaves of the Cosmic God Tree. The seven golden leaves, which had spiritual intelligence, turned into seven balls of light which swirled between his fingers.</p>

    <p>"So? Am I qualified to be your opponent now?"</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi stared at Wang Ling and narrowed his eyes. "Honestly speaking, these golden leaves of the Cosmic God Tree are my final trump card; you are the first person to force me to use them."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling straightened his expression - he had a hunch that these seven golden leaves brimming with vitality weren't the only things which Gu Shunzhi had gotten from the Cosmic God Tree.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, Wang Ling's guess was spot on.</p>

    <p>Just as he was wondering this, he saw the smile on Gu Shunzhi's face gradually disappear, and Wang Ling immediately knew that Gu Shunzhi was going to pull out a truly huge move!</p>

    <p>At that moment, Gu Shunzhi's aura soared, and he made a hand seal.</p>

    <p>The instant he completed it, some force actually shook the Heavenly Dao space apart.</p>

    <p>Right after that, Wang Ling and the six Great Heavenly Dao saw golden branches stretch through the cracks in the space.</p>

    <p>The branches of the Cosmic God Tree!</p>

    <p>The six Great Heavenly Dao were utterly shaken!</p>

    <p>They should have known! The seven golden leaves of the Cosmic God Tree couldn't be Gu Shunzhi's only trick!</p>

    <p>Not only had the Cosmic God Tree acknowledged Gu Shunzhi, the latter had become its spiritual master!</p>

    <p>His hand seal just then was a summoning seal!</p>

    <p>He had summoned the Cosmic God Tree over!</p>

    <p>As the most powerful god tree in the cosmos, the instant the Cosmic God Tree appeared, the situation on the battlefield seemed to turn in Gu Shunzhi's favor.</p>

    <p>Terrifying golden branches stretched through the cracks as if they could reach the end of the universe; even Wang Ling was shaken by this divine aura.</p>

    <p>It had to be said that Gu Shunzhi had truly given him the most pleasant surprise.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was sixteen this year, and had yet to meet such a strong person.</p>

    <p>None of the opponents he had faced before could be placed on the same level as Gu Shunzhi.</p>

    <p>If the six Great Heavenly Dao knew what Wang Ling was thinking at that moment, they would definitely be astonished since this was a pretty high estimation.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi wasn't in a hurry to act. He summoned the Cosmic God Tree and had its branches occupy the entire fractured Heavenly Dao space.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was surrounded!</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi stared at Wang Ling, full of confidence. "So? Is this good enough? This truly is my final trump card, so why don't you summon something and fight me on equal footing? If I win, I don't want anything - I just want to know who on earth you are."</p>

    <p>At Gu Shunzhi's words, the entire Heavenly Dao space went silent for several seconds.</p>

    <p>The Cosmic God Tree's branches were aimed at Wang Ling. With a mere thought from Gu Shunzhi, these branches would immediately lash out to tie Wang Ling up.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, Wang Ling could sense that the branches had a suppressive force in them that was similar to Jingke's aura, though he was sure that they weren't the same.</p>

    <p>"You're very strong."</p>

    <p>To the surprise of the six Great Heavenly Dao, Wang Ling actually opened his mouth.</p>

    <p>This wasn't mind speech!</p>

    <p>This, wasn't mind speech!!</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling spoke, Gu Shunzhi's knees almost went weak.</p>

    <p>- Because this was the sound of a youngster whose voice had yet to break.</p>

    <p>He thought that given Wang Ling's strength, he should at least have several thousand years' worth of cultivation...</p>

    <p>Generally, there were some big shots like this who indeed wanted to maintain their youthful appearance. However, in order to emphasize their bigwig identities, they still kept their adult voices.</p>

    <p>Thus, Gu Shunzhi felt that Wang Ling's teenage voice was in poor taste.</p>

    <p>But this wasn't surprising, since like everyone else, Gu Shunzhi didn't know Wang Ling's real age...</p>

    <p>"So, are you going to summon something for a fair fight?" Gu Shunzhi crossed his arms and looked at Wang Ling. "I can wait, my word as a gentleman! I promise that I won't do anything before your summons!"</p>

    <p>"It seems, you're too confident."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling gazed at Gu Shunzhi as he said his second sentence.</p>

    <p>He stretched out his hands and clapped them, and a summoning array instantly appeared in the air.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi was stunned at this scene... a summoning without seals?</p>

    <p>What kind of operation was this?</p>

    <p>He had never seen this before!</p>

    <p>He was even more stunned by the summoned object.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi rubbed his eyes to confirm that he wasn't seeing wrong.</p>

    <p>Hm...</p>

    <p>That was...</p>

    <p>A toilet...</p>
