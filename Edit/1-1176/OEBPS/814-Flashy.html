  <h1>Chapter 814 Flashy</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Inside the machine room, Xiao Yin and Er Ha frowned deeply as they looked at these sect leaders who had volunteered and jumped into the arena.</p>

    <p>This wasn't right! Why didn't any of them seem the least bit proper?</p>

    <p>Except for Leaping Sect, whose name sounded a little serious, the rest of the sects sounded like they were from funny novels! They could tolerate Steamed Broth Sect and Sweet Bean Curd Sect... It wasn't strange nowadays for foodies to build their own sects and uphold their preferences. In addition to Sweet Bean Curd Sect, there were also Salty Bean Curd Sect and Spicy Sweet Bean Curd Sect. These three factions had been locked in an ongoing battle for ages; now, sects had even been set up to recruit people and engage in mutual disdain.</p>

    <p>Hm, then the question now was...</p>

    <p>What the hell was this Three Days And Two Sects?</p>

    <p>Was some irresponsible author besmirching some person again <sup>1</sup> ?</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Referring to the web author
Three Days and Two Sleeps.
"Sect/teaching" 教 shares the
same pinyin as "sleep" 觉..)</dfn>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "This Three Days And Two Sects..."</p>

    <p>"Brother Xiao is referring to this sect? Well, the name indeed sounds very odd, but it's a genuine major Earth-level second-class sect."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei explained, "But I'm a little surprised that the sect leader stepped out to fight. Because the sect is more used to fighting with words."</p>

    <p>"Fighting with words?"</p>

    <p>"In fact, this sect was originally called Three Days Sect. It earns money by recording down all kinds of secret stories of the cultivation world, and compiling them into novels for online publication. Most of the disciples they recruit are talented writers. After signing the sect contract, they become paid novelists and completely hole up in the sect. The name refers to the godly speed at which they write books. Their record is three days; a sect disciple wrote a novel in three days and even won a literary prize for it."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei laughed. "However, their biggest enemy right now in fact is Senior Wang. In the last monthly battle for votes, this Three Days Sect was messing around behind the scenes, but unfortunately were still beaten back by Senior Wang in the end."</p>

    <p>"Then the current name..."</p>

    <p>"As for the current name, we have to start with Zhu Ge, the Cultivation Chinese Network guru author who several years ago was so enraged by Senior Wang that he left. At that time, Wang Situ angering Zhu Ge into leaving caused a huge stir. After leaving the Network, Zhuge found a new home with Three Days Sect. At the time, the sect leader of Three Days Sect did all he could to invite Zhu Ge to join them, offering him equal shares and the position of deputy sect leader."</p>

    <p>"And then?"</p>

    <p>"The sect leader of Three Days Sect meant well, but after Zhu Ge joined the sect, he started to constantly demand that the sect go out and collect reference material for writing. This didn't align with the sect's original aim of sticking to the keyboard and pounding out words as the front line. Not long after Zhu Ge joined the sect, the conflict between sect leader and deputy sect leader increased."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"But even though they quarreled, they never considered splitting the sect, because Three Days Sect would definitely drop from Earth to Black or even Yellow level. Thus, after Zhu Ge joined the sect, it was subdivided into the Materials Collection faction managed by Zhu Ge and the Shut-Ins faction managed by the original sect leader. Finally, they simply changed the sect name to Three Days And Two Sects."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin and Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>By then, more and more people had gathered in the arena. A dozen or so sect leaders had stepped onto the stage.</p>

    <p>However, most of these sect leaders were from Earth- and Black-level sects. Some of the Sky-level sect leaders, like Lu Youming, were still biding their time.</p>

    <p>To be honest, Lu Youming didn't dare make a move at all.</p>

    <p>Even if the prize was a very attractive first-class holy artifact...</p>

    <p>Instinct was telling Lu Youming that this Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch's strength wasn't simple at all...</p>

    <p>At the moment, because there was already quite a number of people on stage, a few other sect leaders who had initially intended to go up decided to withdraw for now, and if there was another chance later, to step up then.</p>

    <p>On one hand, the arena was only so big; it wouldn't be easy controlling your attacks with so many other people on stage.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, if these dozen or so people all lost to one person, how embarrassing would that be?!</p>

    <p>"Everyone, I propose that we all join hands to exert pressure and lock him inside a strong array, and then attack him! Whoever touches him first takes the prize. How about it?" suggested Sakamoto Shisaburo, sect leader of Leaping Sect.</p>

    <p>"Agreed!"</p>

    <p>"I'm fine with that."</p>

    <p>"Mm, that's fair! But when we attack him later, we must all stand on the same starting line."</p>

    <p>After some consideration, these dozen or so sect leaders all nodded.</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Lu Youming also nodded privately. That was pretty smart.</p>

    <p>In a situation where they weren't sure exactly how strong the other party was, it was indeed a good idea to join hands to first suppress, and then collectively fight the other party.</p>

    <p>Whether they would succeed or not, however, remained to be seen.</p>

    <p>Since there weren't any restrictions on the number of people in this contest, this meant that Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch, who was representing the Office of Strategic Deception, was indeed prepared for a one versus many fight...</p>

    <p>"Ready! — Do it!"</p>

    <p>Sect leader of Leaping Sect, Sakamoto Shisaburo, gave the command in the next moment.</p>

    <p>Twelve Earth-level sect leaders each cast their own sealing spells in the arena. For a moment, all kinds of talisman runes twined together and surged into the sky in a dazzling and colorful array of light. These Earth-level sect leaders were all at the Soul Formation stage, and were extremely fast at forming hand seals.</p>

    <p>Cast in coordination, the twelve sealing spells combined together, and in a split second, an immensely powerful pressure fell on the arena, shaking everyone and freezing their blood.</p>

    <p>Twelve sealing spells...</p>

    <p>The Sky-level sect leaders of the Alliance who were watching secretly sighed at the pressure of these twelve sealing spells.</p>

    <p>As Void Refinement cultivators, they would naturally be able to throw off this pressure, but it still wouldn't be easy.</p>

    <p><em>Boom!</em></p>

    <p>There was a loud bang!</p>

    <p>Twelve talisman seal runes twined together and charged toward Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch in a colorful display of light. In that moment, these spells, being of the same type, resonated with each other, unexpectedly generating an even greater power than anticipated. As the spells surged through the sky, they instantly coalesced into a gigantic rune dragon.</p>

    <p>Below the arena, a shocked person said, "Grade 67 seal..."</p>

    <p>A lot of people looked at the numbers on the bracelets they were wearing — it was indeed a Grade 67 seal.</p>

    <p>The sports bracelets which cultivators wore nowadays had the added function of being able to predict fighting strength, and could quickly analyze the damage effect of an attack, grading all types of spells between 1 and 100.</p>

    <p>A Grade 67 seal was already at the standard of a level six magic seal, with power close to level seven!</p>

    <p>This was far beyond the strength of a magic seal which a Soul Formation cultivator could cast...</p>

    <p>However, when the rune dragon rushed toward him in the arena, Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch didn't look flustered at all.</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch: "Ha ha ha! As expected, everyone is truly very strong! These twelve sealing spells resonating with each other to pull out this group effect is really amazing!"</p>

    <p>At that moment, his bright black eyes absorbed the colors of the approaching light.</p>

    <p>Everyone was focused on his movements, and thought that he was going to perform some spell in response.</p>

    <p>However, they only saw him cross his arms in front of his chest in an "X.""Rebound!"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "???"</p>
