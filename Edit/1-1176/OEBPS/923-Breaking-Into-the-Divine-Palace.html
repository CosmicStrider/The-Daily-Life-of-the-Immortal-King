  <h1>Chapter 923 Breaking Into the Divine Palace</h1>

  <div>

    <p>A group of people flying an aircraft was breaking into Star Lord's Divine Palace!</p>

    <p>For one moment, all of Divine Dao Star was shocked.</p>

    <p>Enslaved monsters from various planets swarmed the main city district. The sky was densely packed with lizard cavalry maintaining order and suppressing the crowds.</p>

    <p>This had never happened before.</p>

    <p>Monsters from all walks of life exhibited their prowess. The moment Chen Chao crashed the aircraft into this palace fortress, the resentment that had been accumulating in the hearts of these monsters for so long exploded.</p>

    <p>They had originally been from different planets and had led peaceful lives. If it hadn't been for Divine Dao Star forcefully devouring their home planets, they wouldn't be living here as Star Lord's slaves. Recalling what had happened in the past, the monsters still seethed with deep resentment.</p>

    <p>Now, at that very moment, all the grief at their families being wrenched apart erupted!</p>

    <p>Chen Chao's collision with Divine Palace reverberated like a clock over the centuries, shaking the hearts of billions of monsters on Divine Dao Star. Speaking their native tongues, monsters young and old all used their strengths to wildly besiege the main city district.</p>

    <p>This momentum shook the "Divine Dragon clan," which was the clan in power on Divine Dao Star.</p>

    <p>"Sir, what should we do?" For a moment, the Divine Dragons were in some disarray.</p>

    <p>There was turmoil outside Star Lord's Divine Palace. Left Protector and Right Protector of the front hall and middle hall had been thwarted and the intruders piloting the aircraft had crashed violently into the rear hall, destroying a number of barriers in the process.</p>

    <p>But this wasn't the only thing they had to deal with - the city center was being attacked by monsters from all directions!</p>

    <p>This was the consequence of plundering planets for so long.</p>

    <p>The energies of these planets had been devoured, but faced with cultural differences, home was where the heart was for most of these monsters. Once they rebelled, they would be hard to quell.</p>

    <p>The Divine Dragon knight commander was a lizard man in golden armor, who was also the commander of twenty million Divine Dragons in the imperial army.</p>

    <p>At that very moment, his expression was a little heavy.</p>

    <p>Someone had broken into Star Lord's Divine Palace, and had even directly crashed an aircraft into it, which was an unprecedented event.</p>

    <p>And it was precisely because it was unprecedented that it stirred up the blood of this group of monsters, whose spirits had almost been suppressed.</p>

    <p>They had never expected this!</p>

    <p>At that moment, the Divine Dragon knight commander's thoughts were very complicated.</p>

    <p>The Divine Dragon clan had plundered countless planets, some of them even stronger and more amazing than Earth.</p>

    <p>And they had used the same strategy every time.</p>

    <p>They captured the most powerful person on the planet and enslaved them right away on Divine Dao Star before plundering the planet.</p>

    <p>They never expected a mere planet like Earth to actually cause so much chaos.</p>

    <p>"Sir! With only twenty million soldiers, we won't be able to hold them back! The monsters have already broken through the eighteenth ring of the main city district." At that moment, a Divine Dragon had hurried over with the message. He was injured and had a miserable air about him.</p>

    <p>What they were facing now was billions of monsters from different planets pouring wildly into the city non-stop from all directions - it was utterly unrealistic to think that twenty million imperial soldiers could stop them.</p>

    <p>"Go set up a barrier in the fifteenth ring. As for the other rings, don't bother stopping them there!"</p>

    <p>The Divine Dragon knight commander's face darkened as he swiftly made a decision. "Kill those who resist!"</p>

    <p>"Then the intruders..."</p>

    <p>"Forget about those Earthlings for now. What we have to do is suppress this mob! These monsters from other planets are nothing more than slaves! How can we let slaves retaliate against us? These Earthlings were daring enough to break into Star Lord's Divine Palace, but they won't live for long."</p>

    <p>The Divine Dragon knight commander sneered. "This is courting death! His Excellency Star Lord will deal with them."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At this reminder from the commander of the imperial army, a bloody war erupted on Divine Dao Star. Millions and millions of creatures revolted as the people on the whole of Divine Dao Star together launched a counteroffensive in the direction of the main city district.</p>

    <p>In his base, Guo Ping looked at this scene on the screen as tears pooled in his eyes.</p>

    <p>He had waited for this day for too long.</p>

    <p>Creatures from different planets with all kinds of blood running through their veins came together in all the colors of the rainbow and spread throughout the streets.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao's aircraft traveled unimpeded - basically, there wasn't anyone who could stop them any longer. Countless Divine Dragon men on wyverns rushed out of Star Lord's Divine Palace to the frontline to suppress the riots, and had no time for Chen Chao and the others... Besides, the latter couldn't be stopped at all.</p>

    <p>There were BUFFs on everyone and BUFF effects on this old aircraft - as it charged through, it knocked down and killed several Divine Dragon knights as well as the wyverns they had been riding...</p>

    <p>This aircraft was really too wild - like a knife, it pierced the bellies of these wyverns in a whirl of intense halos and special effects, and completely sapped the spirits of these Divine Dragons.</p>

    <p>"Are they really Earthlings?"</p>

    <p>"Aren't Earthlings said to be weak?"</p>

    <p>The lips of a lot of Divine Dragons twitched.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Before arriving at the inner hall, Chen Chao moored the aircraft on Guo Ping's instructions.</p>

    <p>"We'll split into groups for the next stage: Nephew Guo, you, Chen Chao, Su Xiao, and Fang Xing will return to outside the city and hold off the dragon knight commander of the imperial army - he's the one in the photo who looks as short as Pan Changjiang <sup>1</sup> . Remember what he looks like. Miss Bai Qiao and Student Wang Ling will be responsible for fighting Star Lord." Guo Ping assigned them their tasks directly.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A Chinese skit actor, sitcom
actor, and recently turned TV
director. He is around 160cm
tall ..)</dfn>

    <p>Actually, Bai Qiao and Fang Xing had already spoken quietly with Guo Ping... Only then did Guo Ping understand why Chen Chao and the others had been eyeing him strangely all this time - they had completely taken him for a game character.</p>

    <p>But that was fine, and Guo Ping didn't reveal the truth; as Bai Qiao and Fang Xing requested, he went along with it.</p>

    <p>As for the exact persuasive words to use, Bai Qiao and Fang Xing had also coached Guo Ping beforehand.</p>

    <p>Everything went as Fang Xing predicted, and Chen Chao wasn't satisfied with the assignments. "Why does Wang Ling get to fight the BOSS, while we wipe out the small fry?!"</p>

    <p>"First, the assignments are random. Second, Student Wang Ling is a good luck charm. You won't be able to clear the game unless both tasks are completed. You are the first to test out this game; if you can clear it, you get a mystery prize," Guo Ping answered, according to the plan that had been discussed before.</p>

    <p>"Alright! It's fine if there's a prize!" After that, Chen Chao instantly had no objections.</p>

    <p>The aircraft then set Wang Ling and Bai Qiao down.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing looked at Wang Ling. Inwardly, he was loath to part with him, but he had to go with Chen Chao and the others. With his fighting strength and a little guidance, it would be easy for them to fight a commander of the imperial army.</p>

    <p>"Go for it, Miss Bai and good luck charm!" Chen Chao said excitedly as he flew the aircraft away.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>When Chen Chao's aircraft left, a ray of light shot out from the inner hall up ahead at the aircraft.</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao's ahoge swung out to block the ray.</p>

    <p>In the inner hall, Star Lord, who loved Earth culture, spoke in halting Mandarin. "So, you are the strongest girl on Earth? I underestimated your native place a little!"</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao and Wang Ling were surprised.</p>

    <p>This Star Lord had actually learned the Northeastern accent!</p>

    <p>But as soon as Star Lord opened his mouth, Wang Ling's tense heart was immediately reassured.</p>

    <p>He had thought at first that this Star Lord would be something.</p>

    <p>In the end, it turned out that all this time, the other party thought that Bai Qiao was the strongest...</p>

    <p>Even this Star Lord couldn't detect Wang Ling - what kind of Almighty was that?</p>

    <p>Grabbing Bai Qiao and bragging about it here - annoying!</p>
