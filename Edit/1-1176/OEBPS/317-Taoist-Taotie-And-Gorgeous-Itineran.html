  <h1>Chapter 317 Taoist Taotie And Gorgeous Itineran </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Taoist Taotie's achievements had actually once been well-known in older cultivation circles. However, he was so ugly that those who had met him in person would feel sick whenever they recalled his face, and those who had never met him before would still lose their appetites at the mere description of his appearance... After that, the senior cultivators in the circle had started to treat this name as taboo, and had never brought it up again.</p>

    <p>A reputation was only considered as such when everyone talked about it; since no one mentioned him anymore, he would naturally be forgotten.</p>

    <p>Thus, students Wang Ling's age had no idea at all that such a person existed in history.</p>

    <p>"Teacher, exactly how ugly is this Taoist Taotie...?" someone raised a hand and asked.</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong had talked about Taoist Taotie in general, but in the end everyone was focused on his looks. Everyone had seen ugly people before, but they were really curious to know exactly how ugly he could be.</p>

    <p>From what Lao Gudong had said, Taoist Taotie's looks could shake the world and make the gods cry. He looked like the mythological Taotie beast and also had a huge appetite, which was how he had gotten this nickname.</p>

    <p>However, Lao Gudong hadn't gone into detail about Taoist Taotie's appearance at all. Seeing that someone had raised this question, he frowned and smiled bitterly. "You shouldn't place so much emphasis on what other people look like; you should pay more attention to inner beauty. Besides, Taoist Taotie hadn't been born ugly; it was because he cultivated the wrong art. No matter what plastic surgery he had, or what appearance-molding elixirs he used, he would instantly revert back to his original appearance in less than a quarter of an hour."</p>

    <p>Everyone now understood why Taoist Taotie hadn't gotten any plastic surgery done — even plastic surgery couldn't fix his ugliness.</p>

    <p>"Apart from his identity as the founder of Qiongchi Sect, Taoist Taotie was also the person who set up the international ranking list of killers, and was the guardian envoy of this list," said Lao Gudong.</p>

    <p>"Isn't the legendary Gorgeous Itinerant the guardian envoy of the list?" Guo Hao was startled by what Lao Gudong had said; this was completely different to what his uncle had told him.</p>

    <p>A mysterious smile flickered across Lao Gudong's face. "In fact, the list had two guardian envoys. Gorgeous Itinerant as mentioned by Student Guo Hao was also one of them. Back then, Gorgeous Itinerant and Taoist Taotie set up this role together. However, shortly after that, the two of them had a falling-out and withdrew from the cultivation world. Qiongchi Sect was also disbanded during that time. Currently, the number one killer on the list, Killer Taoist, is acting as the guardian envoy."</p>

    <p>"Disbanded?" The students couldn't help twitching their lips.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, gluttons were the only group of people in this world that could be summoned and dismissed at will. No wonder online searches for Qiongchi Sect didn't yield any results; as it turned out, this dark force had already disbanded before the authorities could crack down on it.</p>

    <p>"Why did they have a falling-out?" Someone was very curious.</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong drew in a breath before he slowly said, "Rumor was that Gorgeous Itinerant had slipped up during an operation, but no one knows the precise reason. The only thing we know is that after that, the two of them had a falling-out and went their separate ways. Taoist Taotie, moreover, swore that he would definitely get even with Gorgeous Itinerant."</p>

    <p>This answer disappointed the class. Even Lao Gudong didn't know, which meant that no matter how much they researched it, no one would uncover the reason.</p>

    <p>But Lin Xiaoyu was clearly excited compared with everyone else. "Teacher! Why is he called Gorgeous Itinerant? Is it because... he's very erotic <sup>1</sup> ?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The second character 色 in the
word for 'gorgeous' 绝色 on its
own can mean 'lascivious' or
'dirty .. ')</dfn>

    <p>Lao Gudong: "..."</p>

    <p>"Obviously it was because he was too handsome, okay?"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao explained in place of Lao Gudong. Although he hadn't heard of Taoist Taotie's achievements from his uncle, he had heard of Gorgeous Itinerant.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "As far as I know, Gorgeous Itinerant was the most magnificent beauty of his generation, and anyone who saw him had their breaths taken away. He's famous for being the most beautiful man in the cultivation world!"</p>

    <p>"Is he that good-looking?" All the female students in class were stirred up.</p>

    <p>"Let's take that Senior Immortal Toya, the chief instructor for the military training the last time, as an example. If the cultivation circle had a beauty contest, Senior Immortal Toya's looks would put him in the top twenty, but he wouldn't be number one. Gorgeous Itinerant's beauty was widely acknowledged in the cultivation circle back then. I remember that there's a ranking list online, you can go check it out."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao said, "One of my uncles told me that a female cultivator took one look at Gorgeous Itinerant back then, and because he was so handsome, her blood reversed direction and rushed into her brain; rumor is that she's still in a coma now."</p>

    <p>"To that extent?"</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong smiled slightly. "...What Student Guo said is true; I've also heard this."</p>

    <p>Hearing these stories, Lin Xiaoyu grew more and more curious about Gorgeous Itinerant, and her heart felt as itchy as if claws were scratching at it. "Ahh! Wouldn't it be great if I can see him with my own eyes!"</p>

    <p>"Perhaps everyone will have the opportunity to meet him."</p>

    <p>On the dais, Lao Gudong rubbed his belly and laughed. "When I was young, I was also handsome in my prime!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>After he said that, the class was deathly silent.</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong felt like crying but had no tears to shed. "...None of you agree?"</p>

    <p>I'm so hurt!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Today after school, the three class representatives Guo Hao, Chen Chao and Sun Rong gathered together and seemed to be discussing something. Wang Ling glanced at them and noticed that Su Xiao was with them.</p>

    <p>"Do you guys feel that Lao Gudong seemed a little strange today?" asked Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>"That's right, that's right! He was acting very strangely!" Guo Hao crossed his arms as he gazed at the others. "Lao Gudong never really cared about his appearance before. But this time after class... can you guys guess what I saw when I passed by the toilet?"</p>

    <p>"What did you see?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"I saw Lao Gudong looking at himself in the mirror."</p>

    <p>"Damn! Really?" The rest of them were stunned.</p>

    <p>It did sound a little weird; even Wang Ling sighed in his heart when he heard this. This was because given Lao Gudong's normal behavior, if he had the time to look at himself in the mirror, he would rather use it to eat a few bags of latiao .</p>

    <p>"Everyone wants to be beautiful."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong sighed before she said earnestly, "I also want to warn everyone about something else; you should be careful this month after school lets out at the end of the day."</p>

    <p>"Why?"</p>

    <p>"Recently, there's been an organization called Shuigou Sect creating havoc in the district. They're targeting students, forcing them to ingest some unlicensed two-bit product. I heard some students have already experienced mutations in their bodies from taking this product," said Sun Rong.</p>
