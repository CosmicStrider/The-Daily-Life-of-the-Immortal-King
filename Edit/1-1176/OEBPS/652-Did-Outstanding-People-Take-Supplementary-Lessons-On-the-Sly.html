  <h1>Chapter 652 Did Outstanding People Take Supplementary Lessons On the Sly?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was July 23rd on the thirteenth Sunday of the semester.</p>

    <p>Dressed in a black robe, the tall and sturdy Lord of the Castle with sideburns unexpectedly arrived early that morning at the penthouse office of the upscale office building, which was the Lady of the Castle's office to begin with. They were going to receive the most important guest Mo Immortal Castle had had recently, so they had to extend the highest courtesy â€” a glass of fresh milk made from eight-hundred-year-old rhinoceros horn milk powder! Plus two lumps of crystal sugar!</p>

    <p>Close to the appointed time, the Lady started to make the milk. This tin of eight-hundred-year-old rhinoceros horn milk powder was part of the Lord's collection. There were only two of them; one was secreted away in his place and the other was placed in the Lady's office for when they received important guests and for the Lord to drink when he came by in person.</p>

    <p>"My Lord... is President Bai looking for us this time because there was something wrong with the information we gave him? Does he blame us?" The Lady of the Castle was clearly a little flustered. Previously, President Bai had rushed off to look for that green-furred dog and its owner to get revenge on them. Mo Immortal Castle had supplied the dog's coordinates, and President Bai had dispatched Mr Lu to scout out the situation. In the end, it had been a silver-haired young man who had taken up the fight.</p>

    <p>"Our information is always accurate; it's impossible for there to have been a mistake. It's because of this that President Bai is visiting us again." The Lord sat in the executive chair and rested his chin on his steepled fingers as he said, "As for what happened the last time, I don't believe our information was wrong at all; it was the other party who was vigilant and took action beforehand."</p>

    <p>"This... what do you mean?"</p>

    <p>The Lady of the Castle was baffled. "This subordinate is slow-witted. Will my Lord please explain?"</p>

    <p>The Lord's eyes turned dark. "Our Mo Immortal Castle's soul mark is unique and unmatched, and very covert. It's an important means by which we can gather tremendous amounts of information and leads. But we can't eliminate the possibility that an Almighty was able to detect the soul mark and even transfer it without us sensing it at all."</p>

    <p>The Lady was hugely alarmed. "My Lord suspects that someone transferred the soul mark from that green-furred dog?"</p>

    <p>"I'm afraid so."</p>

    <p>The Lord nodded his head. "Nevertheless, we can still draw two conclusions. First, that silver-haired young man has an unusual connection to that green-furred dog."</p>

    <p>"My Lord is utterly correct!" The Lady nodded. "We've already taken photos of both their movements... but what is the second point?"</p>

    <p>The Lord answered, "The second point is that this green-furred dog's master absolutely isn't some ordinary person; I'm afraid he might be an extremely powerful Almighty. Not just anyone can pass on our Mo Immortal Castle's soul mark without the slightest trace. As for whether or not this dog's owner is the young man in that villa, we actually still need to verify this."</p>

    <p>If he was an exceedingly powerful Almighty, the Lord just couldn't put the image of an Almighty together with a youngster.</p>

    <p>Although the ten generals which Mo Immortal Castle had dispatched suffered a crushing defeat at this mysterious young man's hand, it actually still remained to be seen whether he truly was an Almighty capable of passing on the soul mark.</p>

    <p>From the intelligence which the Lord currently had...</p>

    <p>Whether it was that green-furred dog, that silver-haired young man, that Great Death-Courting Senior, or that youngster Zhuo Yi, whom the Lord had already viewed as a thorn in one's side before this, they weren't small or simple characters. Furthermore, this Zhuo Yi was currently at the height of his popularity!</p>

    <p>The relationships among these characters appeared complicated, but it was in fact very simple: they could be explained when everything came down to that young man.</p>

    <p>"Did we find anything on that young man?" The Lord frowned at this thought.</p>

    <p>Previously, they had dispatched many intelligence spies to investigate that mysterious young man's identity, but all they had gotten was just pixels.</p>

    <p>"We found something..." The Lady of the Castle nodded. "This time, our spies started with the people around this young man, and finally obtained information on his family. Their investigations then circled round to a very mystical place which this young man attends regularly for learning."</p>

    <p>A place of learning?</p>

    <p>The Lord was blank; logically speaking, even if this young man and that Almighty weren't the same person, the young man wouldn't be so weak... But he was actually going to school... Sure enough, did outstanding people take supplementary lessons on the sly?</p>

    <p>"Where does this young man go to study? Which sect is it?" The lord couldn't help drinking a mouthful of milk; he also wanted to enroll in some classes later.</p>

    <p>"Number 60 High School," was the Lady's honest reply.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Then, with a "pu" sound, the Lord directly sprayed a mouthful of milk.</p>

    <p>He was alarmed; why was it that damn place again?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Less than ten minutes after the Lord and Lady's conversation, President Bai finally showed up.</p>

    <p>The person who accompanied him this time was no longer Mr Lu or Elder Zuo Wu, but that very feminine-looking Elder Ji Xing.</p>

    <p>When they appeared, Elder Ji Xing was powdering his face.</p>

    <p>This time, President Bai had come to inquire specifically about that young man. When the Lord had learned from the Lady earlier that this young man studied at Number 60 High School, he inexplicable started to feel nervous...</p>

    <p>The truth was that there were few places that the Lord would wholeheartedly describe as "that damn place." Thanks to its massive spy network, Mo Immortal Castle's intelligence network was outstanding. However, there were some places that this intelligence network couldn't reach. For example, Huaxiu Alliance HQ, the family apartment building where Wei Zhi lived, and every place that was related to the Ten Founding Generals; these were all restricted areas for their intelligence spies.</p>

    <p>Just a while ago, the Lord had been thinking about designating Number 60 High as a restricted area...</p>

    <p>Because this school was too weird!</p>

    <p>It seemed to have something to do with all the big shots that had been captured recently!</p>

    <p>He had never ever thought that even this young man whom they were painstakingly investigating... would actually be a student at this high school!</p>

    <p>Such a formidable youngster was actually studying at a Foundation Establishment high school?</p>

    <p>The corner of the Lord's mouth couldn't help twitching as he felt like his three views had already been shattered.</p>

    <p>As soon as President Bai entered, he didn't speak, but sat down on the sofa himself and took the glass of rhinoceros horn milk from the Lady without even looking at the other party.</p>

    <p>"Have you prepared the information we asked for?" Elder Ji Xin asked from beside President Bai.</p>

    <p>"Since it was President Bai's request, we've naturally prepared accordingly." The Lord waved his hand and the Lady was ready to hand over the data in a small USB.</p>

    <p>But when the USB was handed over, the Lord hesitated a little and stared at President Bai with an awkward smile. "That... President Bai, are you sure you don't want to reconsider?"</p>

    <p>Although Mo Immortal Castle's main business was selling information and it had an excellent intelligence department, there were actually still times when it was very important to protect their clients' personal safety.</p>
