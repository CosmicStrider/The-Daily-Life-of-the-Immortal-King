  <h1>Chapter 243 The Multi-Purpose Holy Relic </h1>

  <div>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja really wanted to smash his head against a wall. What Lord Ma!</p>

    <p>He already couldn't follow these great seniors' line of thought.</p>

    <p>Was talent no longer enough, did cultivation also require imagination now?!</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja was lost in deep thought over this.</p>

    <p>The fact was that Wang Ling had transformed quite a number of things in passing in the Wang family's small villa. Apart from Lord Ma, there was also Lord Bao. However, this Lord Bao couldn't take on a human form, so Eraser had unconsciously ignored him.</p>

    <p>Lord Bao's original form was a LV handbag <sup>1</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Bag is 'bao' in Chinese.)</dfn>

    <p>Father Wang had given Mother Wang this bag for their twentieth wedding anniversary. So that it could hold more things when Mother Wang went shopping, Wang Ling had "blessed" this bag the day Father Wang had given it to her.</p>

    <p>Lord Bao possessed remarkable mystical abilities. Besides helping Mother Wang to hold a lot of things, if something unexpected happened while she was out, she could directly hide in Lord Bao's storage space. In short, Lord Bao's space was far more practical than the robot cat's, and his "skin" was tougher than the long johns.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>While Dharmaraja was still pondering the meaning of life after witnessing all kinds of bizarre things in the Wang family's small villa, a ray of light was approaching the villa very swiftly.</p>

    <p>A moment later, a man in white with beautiful hair dropped from the sky — this was precisely that Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>He was carrying a lesser known immortal sword on his back, and those extremely dangerous-looking gray grenades still hung around his waist.</p>

    <p>This was his regular look whenever he went out.</p>

    <p>In this getup, however, he would definitely be arrested on the spot if he took the subway.</p>

    <p>That grenade was the secret weapon of Lord Diulei's clan. It was obvious to anyone who had seen it before how lethal and destructive it was.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, it was a secret weapon that was even ranked first on the list of destructive secret weapons, and it could injure cultivators at the Soul Formation stage.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Yo, hello everyone!"</p>

    <p>"Senior Lord Diulei!" Eraser and Pen stood up to greet him.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Ah? Sheep! Why does it look like your color's faded again? Next time you come to this uncle's place, I'll wax and paint your body!"</p>

    <p>"Okay!" Sheep clapped her hands happily.</p>

    <p>As soon as he entered the villa, he greeted Pen, Eraser and Sheep with a warm smile, but when he saw Dharmaraja on the side, his smile froze.</p>

    <p>Then, he chose to ignore Dharmaraja on the spot, and turned to carry several bags of broccoli into the kitchen and cosy up to Grandfather Wang and Mother Wang.</p>

    <p>After taking two or three minutes to give his greetings, Lord Diulei came out of the kitchen looking much more relaxed.</p>

    <p>"Senior Immortal!" Dharmaraja raised his hand to greet Lord Diulei. The other man had directly ignored him when he had entered earlier, which made him feel a little embarrassed.</p>

    <p>"You..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei cast a glance at the man from Immortal Mansion whose acupuncture points had been sealed, then looked at Dharmaraja and sighed with some disappointment. "As the successor to the godly thunder inheritance, it's bad enough that you don't cultivate diligently, and you just hang around the Xiao Family Compound every day. You have the godly thunder inheritance, but even in a clash of auras with this guy, you lost... this is the consequence of not moving forward!"</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja was instantly speechless and fell silent.</p>

    <p>Because this was the truth.</p>

    <p>Of the descendants of the twelve ancient clans, he was the last remaining descendant of the Thunder clan, and also the successor to the clan's holy relic. After all, the godly thunder inheritance was currently the only known holy relic to have completely evolved beyond the Great Battle Qi era to rely on spirit energy for its operation.</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja had always thought that he alone could never return the Thunder clan to its former glory, so all these years, he had instead taken advantage of the Thunder clan's name and used the godly thunder inheritance to make himself a living.</p>

    <p>He had initially thought that even without cultivating, he could still wield strong power with this holy relic.</p>

    <p>But after visiting the Wang family's small villa today, Dharmaraja realized that he really was just a frog in the well... he was really too insignificant!</p>

    <p>"I won't say any more — from now on, you must put more effort into cultivating, with Ling Zhenren as our goal."</p>

    <p>Seeing Dharmaraja lower his head in self-reflection, Lord Diulei didn't bother to say anything else. He had only said that thing about Dharmaraja leaving the group out of anger. After all, everyone in the group were brothers and sisters; there were times when it wasn't necessary to say more; pointing out the problem was enough.</p>

    <p>Everyone was at the Soul Formation stage and trying their best to break through to the Void Refinement stage; this was something they were all aware of.</p>

    <p>"Senior Lord Diulei, you've come just in time. This is the person from Immortal Mansion we captured. What's more, he's probably a leader in the organization. Lord Jingke has already sealed his spirit acupuncture points." Eraser pointed at the man whom Sheep was sitting on.</p>

    <p>"Mm, this time you've really worked hard. It was also thanks to Brother Ling since he knew this bunch of people would definitely come looking for trouble, so he planned ahead."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei smiled, his expression bright. "In fact, even if we weren't able to catch this person today, Brother Ling would have eventually found another way to track down Immortal Mansion's den. Back then at my place, he put a mine inside that Abyss Avoidance sword, so we would have been able to track that Immortal Mansion red-headed youngster's location at any time."</p>

    <p>Eraser and Pen were quiet since they already knew this.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was deliberately saying it for the benefit of this man.</p>

    <p>Later on, he pointed a finger at the man and directly unsealed his tongue. "So, is there anything you want to say now?"</p>

    <p>This tall and sturdy man of Immortal Mansion kept his lips tightly sealed. "I have nothing to say. Don't expect me to tell you anything. Also, I advise you not to try going through my memories, since our Immortal Mansion people all bear the Lord's brand. If anyone tries to take our memories by force, it'll explode, and all of you will die as well."</p>

    <p>"An explosion? Are you going to add a Thomas flair sky spiral <sup>2</sup> too? You dare threaten us?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Probably trying to convey the
idea of the explosion sending
them pinwheeling into the sky.)</dfn>

    <p>Pen let out a hmph and wanted to teach this person a lesson.</p>

    <p>But Lord Diulei stopped him before he could make a move. "— Hang on!"</p>

    <p>Flipping his own hair back, he carefully checked the man's nape, and then sighed. "It seems he's telling the truth; there are traces of a brand on the back of his neck."</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja furrowed his brow. "Senior Immortal, what should we do now?"</p>

    <p>"We can only wait until he's ready to talk."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei looked at the man on the ground and said, "People from Immortal Mansion like to refine some part of their body into a magic weapon. I heard that this man seems to be extremely confident in the power of his eyes...?"</p>

    <p>Eraser nodded his head. "They are indeed very powerful; before Lord Dharmaraja could do anything, the shock already caused his eyes to bleed!"</p>

    <p>It felt like another arrow to Dharmaraja's knee. "..."</p>

    <p>Can you stop bringing this thing up?! It's so humiliating!</p>

    <p>"Very well."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei laughed sinisterly, stood up, and patted Dharmaraja's shoulder. "Dharmaraja, it's time for you to redeem yourself!"</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja: "???"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Someone come and force this person's eyelids open. Then Dharmaraja, you can blind his damn eyes with your godly thunder inheritance until he confesses!"</p>
