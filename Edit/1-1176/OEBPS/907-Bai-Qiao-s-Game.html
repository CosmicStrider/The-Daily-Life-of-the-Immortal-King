  <h1>Chapter 907 Bai Qiao's Game</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Bai Qiao's wish was surprisingly unusual, but it wasn't unachievable. After the exorcism convention, Boss Jin received a massive sum of prize money. He was extraordinarily good to his wild daughter, even though in Bai Qiao's eyes, Boss Jin this daddy was nothing but a means for her own enjoyment...</p>

    <p>After the negotiation, Bai Qiao signed a new agreement with Wang Ling: as long as he could fulfill her wish to develop a game, she would be willing to return with him.</p>

    <p>But now there was another problem.</p>

    <p>Everyone here was good at playing games, but not at making them... Games didn't just require a high level of creativity - the level of scrutiny had progressively increased in recent years, and many new games weren't even able to obtain license approvals from the relevant body, all of them ultimately rotting away in the hands of the game companies.</p>

    <p>In exchange for these huge investment costs, the games couldn't even be released - for the time being, game companies big and small on the market were caught in a dilemma.</p>

    <p>So, the question was what kind of game they should make. Large game companies like Horseguin and NetHard <sup>1</sup> dominated the top rankings with games like MOBA and PUBG. If they developed a similar type of game, it would be very hard to steal a piece of this pie.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A riff on Tencent's penguin

    <p>But before even getting that far, no matter how exquisitely made a game was, small game companies couldn't compare with established companies in terms of server operations and maintenance - as soon as a huge number of users flooded the server, it would most likely crash.</p>

    <p>But Bai Qiao already had her own ideas about the game design. If a new game wanted to gain a foothold in the game market monopoly, creativity would be a key factor.</p>

    <p>It was August 29th, the sixteenth day of the summer vacation. Wang Ling's room had never been this lively with so many people. Wang Ming, who had been pushed around for a long time in the lab by Zhai Yin, had also come... however, it wasn't Wang Ming himself who came, but the mecha armor he was controlling remotely, Wang Ling Two.</p>

    <p>After the trip to Beast King's Remains the last time, the latest Wang Ling Two had been upgraded and modified using Wang Ling One as the base. Not only could it be used in battle via long-range control, it could also be recalled at a click to combine with the original body. Most crucially, Wang Ling Two already had basic artificial intelligence and thus had its own consciousness.</p>

    <p>That was to say, Wang Ling Two's current capability was already very close to that of the advanced clone "Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch" which Wang Ling had created by using the Great Separation Spell. Wang Ling Two's memories would also synchronize with Wang Ming's brain. The only difference was that Wang Ling Two wasn't as strong as Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch.</p>

    <p>In the room, Er Ha, Jingke, Xiao Yin, Lord Diulei and Wang Ling Two surrounded Bai Qiao in a circle.</p>

    <p>"Tell us your ideas for the design first; you can leave the rest to me after that." When Wang Ling Two this artificial human replica spoke, it was with Wang Ming's distinct voice.</p>

    <p>"I want to design a cultivation simulation sandbox game with a high degree of freedom!" Bai Qiao's face brightened when the subject of games was brought up, and her eyes seemed to shine with light. "I'm going to call it 'Cultivation Emulator.' Characters, spells, cultivation arts, magic artifacts... including the world itself, everyone can set the parameters themselves. Players don't operate characters, but an entire world - they have to consider the power balance between forces and maintain order in the world. To ensure that the world you create can develop in a sustainable way - this is the key to this game!"</p>

    <p>"So the main point of the game is to run a whole world? Will in-game purchases be possible?" Xiao Yin asked. As another fan of games, he had played some of the top-ranking games in the months that he had been living at Lord Diulei's place, and whatever he could spend on, he would! The one he hated the most was "Dungeon &amp; Devils." He was rendered speechless by the game's weapon upgrade system - he had even thrown in his food delivery money, but still couldn't upgrade his weapons no matter what.</p>

    <p>Later, after Xiao Yin watched some online videos, he found out that those who had successfully upgraded their weapons had been kowtowing on the side as it happened - they used their foreheads to click the mouse to demonstrate their sincerity...</p>

    <p>"There won't be any in-game purchases; it's an absolutely fair game. In order to make money, however, we can instead design trendy fashion to sell."</p>

    <p>"Will wearing trendy clothes add to your attributes? Like an extra 10 ATK?" Xiao Yin raised his hand and asked.</p>

    <p>"No."</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao resolutely shook her head.</p>

    <p>"What about the power struggle?"</p>

    <p>"That will automatically take place depending on the design parameters and the basic characters. For example, you can pre-set how many major forces your world will have, the distribution of power, and so on. However, the composition and size of the force will depend on character parameters. As for each character's talents, attributes, personality and so on... the player can freely design all these at the beginning.</p>

    <p>"Based on their attributes and personalities, these characters will develop freely in the world and finally form their own forces according to the pre-installed script. Players won't have any control over this, which is why the characters' personalities have to be defined right from the start."</p>

    <p>"Can we set up a world without any villains?" Er Ha asked.</p>

    <p>"You can! In this free cultivation world, the player is god. Of course it's fine if you want to create a perfect world without any evil. However, whether a world like that can continue to run is another matter. You've heard the story of the catfish and sardines, right? A civilization grows in strife. If there is no pursuit of or desire to change, the world itself will not progress," Bai Qiao said.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Two nodded. "I have a rough idea of what you want now. However, we still need a sandbox game template and some basic programming parameters. I need some real data as reference."</p>

    <p>Right after Wang Ming said that, Book of Sage Immortal suddenly spoke up before Wang Ling could say a word. "I calculate that there's a 98% chance that my lord will have me search for a suitable world and imitate its parameters."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Can a super outdated tablet like you do that?" Bai Qiao's eyes sparkled.</p>

    <p>"Yes, Miss Bai Qiao! It's very easy!" Book of Sage Immortal replied.</p>

    <p>Book of Sage Immortal then projected an image of a blue and brown planet. "These are the parameters for Earth in the tenth universe from six hundred million years ago. Miss Bai Qiao can create the characters now; I'll combine them with this tenth universe, and extrapolating from that, simulate the future development of the world.</p>

    <p>"Not just Miss Bai Qiao, but everyone here can also try creating your own characters. Let's see what sort of impact they'll have on the world in the future..."</p>

    <p>Saying this, Book of Sage Immortal turned to look at Wang Ling. "My lord, would you like to create the first character?"</p>

    <p>Book of Sage Immortal was well aware that in the end, its master was Wang Ling. Giving Wang Ling first priority in creating a character was giving him face, and there was a 78% chance that its lord wouldn't smash it to bits...</p>
