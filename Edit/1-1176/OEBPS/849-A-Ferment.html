  <h1>Chapter 849 A Ferment</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The ferment this caused spread quicker than anyone expected, the main reason for it being the message Wang Ling sent. And this time, it wasn't a string of ellipsis... Just looking at this point, one could already see how serious the problem was!</p>

    <p>After all, this had to do with the reputations of both schools. When a student made a mistake, the school generally wasn't involved. After receiving the message, the first thing Lord Diulei did was have Zhuo Yi find out about the situation. To avoid arousing suspicion, Zhuo Yi had Zhong Lang make the call.</p>

    <p>In the end, DG High's attitude toward ordinary people was arrogant - two hours after calling to warn them, Zhong Lang called again, and the director of education on the other end replied unhurriedly in heavily accented Mandarin, "We're currently verifying this. Please don't worry, and give us some time."</p>

    <p>So, after another two hours...</p>

    <p>The other party's reply was: "We're currently verifying this. Please don't worry, and give us some time."</p>

    <p>"Damn it."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was actually next to Zhong Lang as the latter made the inquiry over the phone, and this attitude pissed him off.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi smacked the tabletop and stood up on the spot. "One minute, I want all the information on this school!"</p>

    <p>A major nuisance of schools established by foreign companies was that they could bypass the local General Administration of 100 Schools and directly report their activities to the Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools. It thus wasn't strange for DG High to act so arrogantly toward the General Administration of 100 Schools. This was more or less the same problem with schools established by foreign companies in other cities - they weren't willing to directly follow the arrangements of the local General Administration of 100 Schools.</p>

    <p>But DG High hadn't taken into account the fact that this was Songhai city!</p>

    <p>Furthermore, they had no idea what kind of relationship Zhuo Yi had with the head of the Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools, Secretary Dakang.</p>

    <p>The database of the Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools contained information on every school in the whole of Huaxiu nation. To access the database for an investigation usually required that notification be given at least eight hours beforehand. However, Zhuo Yi now had another important identity, as team leader of the Office of Strategic Deception's supervisory and investigation team. Given the Office's relationship with Huaxiu Alliance, plus Zhuo Yi's position, his request to access this data was reviewed far more quickly.</p>

    <p>This data was extremely detailed.</p>

    <p>Because this was official data from the Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools, it contained both the information submitted by the school as well as information that wasn't submitted, but which had been secretly investigated by the Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools and put in the database.</p>

    <p>"This school's Golden Core rate isn't low." Zhong Lang glanced at the statistics.</p>

    <p>"Children of the rich rely on medicine to advance." Zhuo Yi laughed. "Nowadays, the rich rely on technology while the poor rely on mutations. Our nation has never advocated taking drugs for cultivation growth, since it greatly undermines one's foundation. You know about the beef on the market that was injected with water? To increase the weight, sellers injected a lot of water into the beef in the short term to make it heavier, which massively reduced the quality. The same reasoning applies here."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi very carefully searched through the thick stack of information, and then unexpectedly burst out laughing.</p>

    <p>"Brother Zhuo, why are you laughing?" asked Zhong Lang.</p>

    <p>"My <em>shifu </em>wants this school dealt with. Since we're doing this, we need to find a suitable excuse. Looking at the information we have, this school has committed previous offenses. DG has a high profile overseas, but it isn't in the top ten in Songhai city. The other party has always sent papers to foreign media mocking the level of our country's cultivation education level and degree of understanding."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi said, "But it's very interesting that these were all reported abroad, whereas they haven't released anything in the local media."</p>

    <p>"The nerve of these people..." Zhong Lang was shocked.</p>

    <p>This was the typical hypocrite!</p>

    <p>Making a profit off Huaxiu students while expressing their superiority abroad...</p>

    <p>And unfortunately, the most hateful thing was that those kids who entered DG High were really brainwashed by this sense of superiority, making them think they were hot shots. Of course, these kids couldn't be blamed; it was solely because of their environment that had led to such a problem.</p>

    <p>"DG thinks that no one can deal with them, but I already have some ideas." Zhuo Yi skimmed the information repeatedly. When he saw the list of medicines which DG provided the schoolkids with, he noticed that its biggest supplier was: Chrysanthemum Island.</p>

    <p>So, it was someone on their own side.</p>

    <p>Then the rest was very easy to arrange.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Roughly five minutes later, Immortal Toya posted on his official Weibo and Chrysanthemum Island's official account: <em>I and my company Chrysanthemum Island are terminating our partnership in medicine resources with DG High School.</em></p>

    <p>Attached under the post were several screenshots of DG High students insulting Number 60 High students, as well as some articles in another language that mocked the local education system.</p>

    <p>This Weibo post was like a dropped bomb.</p>

    <p>What was Immortal Toya's status now?</p>

    <p>He was the team leader of the Office of Strategic Deception's medicine team, and the vice-chairman of Huaxiu's Alchemists' Association! He was now publicly declaring his stance.</p>

    <p>And what even DG High School never expected...</p>

    <p>Was for this declaration to trigger a boycott by the entire alchemy industry.</p>

    <p>One after another, many major first- and second-class alchemists publicly stated that they were going to stop outsourcing medicine to DG High School.</p>

    <p>In the space of a short morning, the matter completely blew up.</p>

    <p>In addition to this, a new movement was already in full swing on Number 60 High's school Tieba â€” cheering on the students of the elite classes!</p>

    <p>"Isn't that so-and-so from DG High looking down on us? Let him come! Beat the shit out of him, then send him packing!"</p>

    <p>"That's right! We must beat him up! Our Number 60 High elite classes aren't just for show!"</p>

    <p>"Does he think he can do whatever he wants just because his family has money? Our school's poor Classmate Wang Ling eats crispy noodle snacks every day, but can still get into the elite class - now that's real ability!"</p>

    <p>Many students from the remedial and even regular classes spontaneously voiced their support for the elite class students on Tieba, firing up the elite students who had been feeling aggrieved that morning.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, at DG High School, the school leaders finally realized how serious the problem was.</p>

    <p>Because the student who had posted had been so unbridled, putting up pictures on Tieba of his school uniform and the luxury pills he used regularly, the school clearly couldn't use the excuse that this person wasn't their student.</p>

    <p>And so, this bunch of quick-witted, foreign leaders hit on an exquisite excuse.</p>

    <p>Wednesday, August 16th.</p>

    <p>It was roughly one o'clock in the afternoon, six hours after the incident happened.</p>

    <p>There was a post on DG High School's official Weibo: <em>We're very sorry: our student's account was hacked!</em></p>

    <p>And the image that came with it: <em>NOT ME!</em></p>
