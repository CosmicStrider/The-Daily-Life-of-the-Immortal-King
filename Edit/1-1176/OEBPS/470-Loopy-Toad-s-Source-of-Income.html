  <h1>Chapter 470 Er Ha's Source of Income </h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Isn't Master busy with his midterms... how can you trouble him..."</p>

    <p>For some reason, Xiao Yin felt his own words were pretty weak.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, it was really wonderful to live with Master as you could consult him on strange spirit techniques or spells. While Dog Saint had been turned into stew and the entire holy beast Dog clan had been destroyed, so that Xiao Yin was currently the only person who could use these Dog Skills, he didn't doubt Wang Ling's teaching ability at all.</p>

    <p>This was currently the case for a lot of spellmasters. This was a popular new profession in the cultivation circle, and a spellmaster's role was to help people work out various types of difficulties as they studied spells or close combat spirit techniques. They themselves weren't necessarily capable of performing these kinds of spells and spirit techniques, but they could often analyze the main points according to their theoretical knowledge so that it greatly shortened the time needed to learn a spell or a close combat spirit technique.</p>

    <p>It was like swimming instructors who taught kids how to swim. In fact, many of them couldn't swim... After all, they taught the children to swim in shallow water, so no one could drown anyway.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin's heart collapsed, but at the same time he was a bit envious; his emotions were very complicated.</p>

    <p>Sure enough... whoever came first was lucky...</p>

    <p>But when on earth could he form the contract with Wang Ling?!</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin had in fact already hinted to Wang Ling previously about the contract agreement. He had quietly assumed that if Master really had had utterly no desire to form a contract with him, he would never have been allowed to live here, with Thunder looking after him. And Thunder was probably Master's best friend...</p>

    <p>Suddenly, Xiao Yin was very worried that Wang Ling was ignoring him out of dislike.</p>

    <p>How about asking Er Ha to help him ask Wang Ling when on earth they could finalize the contract?</p>

    <p>At a loss as what to do, Xiao Yin couldn't help sighing in his heart... In the end, it was still him begging Er Ha for a favor...</p>

    <p>"That, Brother Dog... are you still there?"</p>

    <p>He stopped using voice and directly switched to typing as he sent the text to the chat window, then clicked the shake function.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "???"</p>

    <p>In front of the screen, Er Ha couldn't help smiling. Switching instantly from voice to text generally meant that Xiao Yin clearly had something big to say.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "You want to request something of me again?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha recalled how Xiao Yin had done the same thing a few times before when he had looked for Er Ha.</p>

    <p>After shaking the chat window, he had immediately started asking Er Ha about all kinds of things to do with Wang Ling's life, such as his typical daily routine, his living habits, his preferences and so on.</p>

    <p>To be honest, after bathing in Xiao Yin's holy beast blood the last time, Er Ha's narcolepsy had indeed been greatly alleviated. Although Little Master Ling had returned the favor with twenty packets of crispy noodle snacks, Er Ha still had to repay this debt.</p>

    <p>In fact, if Xiao Yin really needed its help, Er Ha certainly wouldn't refuse...</p>

    <p>However, simply giving out information about its little master was a little unkind!</p>

    <p>Er Ha felt that it was a very loyal dog!</p>

    <p>A dog who would never betray its owner!</p>

    <p>It was impossible for it to betray Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>Unless it was over its dead body... Er Ha was a toad made of steel!</p>

    <p>Mm...</p>

    <p>That was indeed how it felt, before it received Xiao Yin's money transfer...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin typed very slowly as he weighed his words carefully before sending them. He pondered for a long time before summoning up the courage to send his text. "I want to ask Brother Dog whether you can help me ask Master when on earth he's going to form a contract with me..." Actually, he had always felt that asking outright like this wasn't very nice, and Master might even be disgusted. However, once a spirit beast or a holy beast had set their heart on an owner, only the guarantee of a contract could give them enough sense of security.</p>

    <p>Er Ha remembered that Wang Ling had mentioned the contract with Xiao Yin before at home.</p>

    <p>But it just so happened that the midterm exams were approaching at the time, so the contract had been put on hold. Er Ha actually knew that Wang Ling hadn't forgotten; once this busy period passed, he would conclude the agreement with Xiao Yin sooner or later.</p>

    <p>There was only one holy beast left now in the entire world. For the sake of protecting endangered animals, Er Ha believed that Wang Ling wouldn't forget to finalize the contract - however, Little Master Ling was only sixteen years old, after all, and for children at this age, there was nothing more important than study.</p>

    <p>Er Ha felt that in this world, there was no one who could fight Little Master Ling head-on.</p>

    <p>However, there might be one thing that could go up against him and even had the chance to defeat him... and that was exams.</p>

    <p>The midterm exams was the small boss and the final exams was the big boss... It simply couldn't be more real than that.</p>

    <p>Er Ha stared at the screen and thought for a bit before simply sending a text. "Xiao Yin, do I look like a dog that will betray its owner?"</p>

    <p>When Er Ha sent this message, Xiao Yin almost spat out a mouthful of holy beast blood...</p>

    <p>He couldn't help but gape as he wondered how thick-skinned Er Ha this green dog was, to be able to say something like this.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin couldn't resist sending the meme of Zhuge Liang <sup>1</sup> saying "I have never seen such a shameless person before," but he crossed out the word "person" and replaced it with "dog."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is a line Zhuge Liang says in the 1994 TV adaptation of the "Romance Of The Three Kingdoms.")</dfn>

    <p>Xiao Yin couldn't help sitting rigidly on the sofa, his shoulder-length silver hair hanging loose. He was so annoyed that he even threw the broccoli pillow in his hand aside.</p>

    <p>He typed indignantly: <em>Isn't some dog well aware of how many red packets it received previously...</em></p>

    <p>But while he did type this out, Xiao Yin didn't dare directly send the text, and he pressed the backspace key to delete the words completely.</p>

    <p>After all, the only connection he had to Master was in fact Er Ha. If this bridge collapsed, he might not be able to cross it in the future...</p>

    <p>No...</p>

    <p>He had to endure!</p>

    <p>His lips twitching, Xiao Yin sent Er Ha a red packet of two thousand HNY.</p>

    <p>One question cost two thousand; that was the rule Er Ha had set the last time.</p>

    <p>He would just consider it as losing money to avoid disaster...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin actually understood this point very well. Anyway, the money wasn't his; the pocket money he had on him was from Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>After confirming and accepting the red packet, Er Ha couldn't help nodding its dog head as it sent a thumbs-up. "Brother Xiao Yin, you're smart. I didn't expect you to still remember the two thousand I set last time."</p>

    <p>In fact, Er Ha had asked him for two thousand HNY last time without thinking, but it hadn't thought that Xiao Yin would really send it...</p>

    <p>But speaking rationally, Er Ha had been in human society for so long and had been eating and drinking with the Wang family since coming to live in their small villa, but it had no income or savings.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin received pocket money from Lord Diulei... In comparison, Er Ha had nothing.</p>

    <p>Little Master Ling was thrifty by nature and basically didn't spend much except on crispy noodle snacks.</p>

    <p>Hence, when Er Ha saw this transfer of two thousand HNY, it couldn't help sighing. "I was initially going to charge less this time..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Xiao Yin almost sprayed blood. "Then give it back!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "No no no... I've accepted it, it doesn't make sense to give it back. I'll keep this matter in mind and will talk it over with my little master."</p>

    <p>In front of the screen, Xiao Yin pursed his lips angrily. "You dog <em>bapi <sup>2</sup> </em>..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Zhou Bapi is an antagonist in the story "The Chickens Make Noise at Midnight" who would stir the chickens in the henhouse so that the rooster would crow earlier than usual, forcing his laborers to get up earlier for work ..)</dfn>
