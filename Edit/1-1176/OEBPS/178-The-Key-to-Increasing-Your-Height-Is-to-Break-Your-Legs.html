  <h1>Chapter 178 The Key to Increasing Your Height Is to Break Your Legs </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was June 7th on the seventh Tuesday of the semester.</p>

    <p>A lot of things had happened in this one night. Wang Ling had upgraded his Great Shielding Spell and Lord Diulei had had a very long "heart-to-heart" conversation with Boss Tan at Midnight Dining Hall. By the time they had finished speaking, the elk velvet antlers and pine jelly soup had grown cold. The final bill had come to four hundred and nineteen HNY... this was probably the most expensive dish of all the ordinary dishes in Boss Tan's shop.</p>

    <p>It was around dawn when Lord Diulei finally started to make his way back to Wenxian Garden with the stone chest.</p>

    <p>At that time, the sky was already starting to lighten, and the sun's rays broke through the clouds. Some of them shone on the face of the man in white who was on a flying sword. The man's expression hadn't eased up since leaving Midnight Dining Hall.</p>

    <p>Immortal Mansion...</p>

    <p>From Boss Tan's lips, Lord Diulei once again heard the name of this organization. The last time he had heard it was when the woman called Ah You who had been employed by Mo Immortal Castle had mentioned it.</p>

    <p>At that time, Lord Diulei had tentatively determined the nature of this organization, and after returning home, he had specially checked the current list of light forces present in and outside of Huaxiu nation. As expected, however, he hadn't discovered any clues.</p>

    <p>This wasn't a listed sect regulated by Huaxiu nation or another government; instead, it was under dark force administration, which was the most dangerous thing about it.</p>

    <p>Boss Tan also appeared to be a retired expert who recognized this murky group called Immortal Mansion. Although Lord Diulei didn't know the specific connection between Boss Tan and Immortal Mansion, his sixth sense told him that it was likely he himself would run into trouble in the days to come...</p>

    <p>Such were his thoughts as he made his way home.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The fervor surrounding the Shadow Stream incident subsided as quickly as it had emerged. Whether it was government officials or the melon-eating masses, they would only focus on this type of huge gossip for a short period of time.</p>

    <p>During that period, netizens would maintain a pretentious attitude of focusing on the facts and make frenzied comments as if they were trying to drag the whole world into even more chaos. Worse still, some malicious self-publishing media would embellish the original facts of the incident and spread rumors mainly for the sake of increasing their "page views" by freeloading off this hot incident.</p>

    <p>However, as reality had shown, whether it was Shadow Stream's prison break this time, or those soldiers who had been sacrificed during government rescue operations, or the disappearance of Maxiu nation's aeroplane a few years ago... some netizens would be severely critical, some netizens would mourn. After this period of time, interest would start to wane, and finally no one would pay attention to the issue any longer.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling understood this well from experience; the recent incident with Mother Wang being groped had perfectly reflected this situation, after all. During that period of time, every major blogger had been advocating anti-pervert guidebooks for women. But things were always easier said than done. After this hot topic had dropped out of the limelight, public "wandering hands" once again had been unable to restrain themselves.</p>

    <p>Today, the topic of discussion in Grade One, Class Three had shifted again and had been completely supplanted by the latest gossip on the school's military training.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, this news had unexpectedly been brought to them by Tang Jingze and He Bufeng, Number 59 High School's delinquent senior.</p>

    <p>In the brief span of time that they had been at Number 60 High School so far, these two people had fitted in pretty quickly; at the very least, they had already integrated into the class's male population.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling felt that these two guys had been infected by a terrible disease, and that was gossip...</p>

    <p>Needless to say, they had definitely picked up this disease from Guo Hao, Guo Hao. Wang Ling had always thought that this disease was far more frightening than a virus since gossip was contagious — and this was in no way an exaggeration!</p>

    <p>"I heard about this military training from a couple of senior brothers who are about to graduate."</p>

    <p>During the free study period in the morning, He Bufeng sat at his desk and waved the stack of mysterious files which he had in his hands. The students of Grade One, Class Three all surrounded He Bufeng; Wang Ling alone sat in his seat as he waited and watched from afar.</p>

    <p>"Did you spend money on this?" Guo Hao was very curious.</p>

    <p>"No, I didn't."</p>

    <p>He Bufeng shook his head. "I just promised them that after they graduated, they can bring their student IDs to my family's hospital to get height-increasing surgery done free of charge... but this surgery is limited to guys, and is our hospital's latest project for which we are applying a patent."</p>

    <p>Bluntly speaking, this was a business transaction — height-increasing surgery in exchange for information.</p>

    <p>"This actually works?" Chen Chao was stunned.</p>

    <p>"Genetically speaking, your height, like cultivation genius, is set from birth. Even cultivators aren't able to improve their heights through cultivation. The height-increasing pills available on the market actually still aren't as reliable as height insoles, since a pill's effect can only last for half a month at most, and it's also very expensive."</p>

    <p>When He Bufeng said this, Su Xiao sullenly lowered his head.</p>

    <p>"But technology nowadays is so advanced that it's actually not hard to increase your height by two to four centimeters. Surgery at our family's hospital is quite reliable; the results are permanent and there are no side effects. But you have to wait until you graduate from high school before getting the surgery so that you can make full use of the two-year long seclusion break," He Bufeng said.</p>

    <p>Su Xiao was suddenly interested. "How is it done?"</p>

    <p>"The specific process begins with anaesthesia. Then, we look for two burly fellows to break both your legs; the best is if the bone is shattered. After that, the height-increasing liquid developed by our hospital will be injected into the broken bones, and our special German orthopedic medicinal powder will be applied over it," He Bufeng answered indifferently. "That's right... the crux of the entire surgery is that you need to break the legs!"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>He Bufeng: "The more broken they are, the better, and no matter what, don't touch the nerves. The two bruisers who will fracture your legs have been specially trained by our hospital."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao covered his face and laughed bitterly. "...This is simply too brutal!"</p>

    <p>"That's why this surgery is suitable for boys only. Girls' legs are too thin, so it'll be hard for the men to control their strength when breaking them," He Bufeng said.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "I just want to know, the two people whom you traded with for information, do they know about this?"</p>

    <p>He Bufeng shrugged his shoulders. "Of course not."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "Wouldn't you be in danger once they learn the truth?"</p>

    <p>He Bufeng patted Guo Hao's shoulder. "Don't worry... by then, their legs will already have been broken!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>It wasn't until now that Wang Ling finally realized how scary this delinquent senior was.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Getting down to business, He Bufeng broke down the information in his hands, which he had already gone through last night. "Let me explain to everyone the brand new content of the military training this time in simple terms. Apart from military stance drills, a survival contest has been added to the team event."</p>

    <p>Lin Xiaoyu: "Sand-washing <sup>1</sup> contest? Are we going to play with mud?!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>('Sand-washing' and 'survival'
have the same pronunciation
in Chinese ..)</dfn>

    <p>"It's survival, not sand-washing..."</p>

    <p>He Bufeng rubbed his temple as he continued. "This survival contest will put all the students from the six schools taking part in the military training on one map. Two schools will form one alliance, and the three alliances will carry out an actual combat simulation exercise on the map. The last ten people standing will be the victors of the contest."</p>

    <p>After He Bufeng said this, Tang Jingze looked around from where he was standing on the side. "This time, our Number 59 High School and Number 60 High School will form an alliance and fight the other four high schools together!"</p>
