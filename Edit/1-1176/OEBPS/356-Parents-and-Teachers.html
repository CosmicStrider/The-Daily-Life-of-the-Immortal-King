  <h1>Chapter 356 Parents and Teachers </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Some of the teachers from Number 60 High School were sitting in Second Hospital's breakroom drinking coffee. They were all feeling physically and mentally exhausted. Although Golden Core cultivators could stay up for several days on end, even going dozens of days without sleep, they couldn't endure the ongoing "tiredness" of the spirit and mind; even Golden Core cultivators couldn't withstand it continuously.</p>

    <p>No one had expected this to happen at this critical juncture after school today. After getting off work, the teachers had hurried over to the hospital one after another to care for the students as well as to placate agitated parents.</p>

    <p>While most of the parents were in fact reasonable people, there were inevitably some agitators. When something happened to their children at school, they didn't look to themselves, but would blame the school and the teachers first, to the point that female teachers would feel like their balls were aching when they didn't even have balls.</p>

    <p>Actually, with this Shuigou Sect incident, apart from those like Chen Chao, Guo Hao and Su Xiao who had eaten the fruit by mistake, the reason why the students had eaten the fruit for the sake of becoming stronger was closely related to how they were brought up at home.</p>

    <p>The students who had eaten the fruit in order to obtain power had parents who generally had very high expectations of them. If they didn't achieve the scores their parents wanted in their tests, they would instantly be berated or even beaten and scolded.</p>

    <p>When all was said and done, this was in fact the parents' fault.</p>

    <p>The pressure they put on their children was just too much.</p>

    <p>According to the way most parents thought, apart from wanting their children to do well on the college entrance exam, they also wanted them to reach the Golden Core stage before they graduated from high school; that way, they could get the government's super spirit elixir subsidy, and their future prospects would be bright and prosperous.</p>

    <p>But how could it be so easy to reach the Golden Core stage?</p>

    <p>In this modern day and age, the time it took to get to the Golden Core stage from the Foundation Establishment stage had been greatly reduced with the assistance of various kinds of elixirs and supplements.</p>

    <p>But while the time it took was shorter, many parents had ignored a very important issue, and that was talent - in equal circumstances, some people might be able to reach the Golden Core stage in a very short period of time, while others might need decades or even centuries to do the same.</p>

    <p>Talent was not something that could be enhanced by eating an aptitude elixir like in a game; after all, there was no such thing in the real world.</p>

    <p>But parents were in the end parents... they would always believe that their children were prodigies and the smartest! They should be able to reach the Golden Core stage in no time!</p>

    <p>This kind of parents were the ones which teachers usually couldn't stand and who gave them extreme headaches.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, you couldn't speak the truth in society, otherwise you'd be hated.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>A group of Number 60 High School teachers were chatting in the breakroom. At that moment, Teacher Ye entered with a dejected face, his complexion as white as a corpse.</p>

    <p>"What's the matter?" A female teacher stood up and helped him sit down.</p>

    <p>Seeing his state, Teacher Pan hurriedly gave him a glass of water before sighing. "Most likely those parents were making a commotion."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Teacher Ye's eyes unexpectedly turned red and he looked extremely wronged.</p>

    <p>A moment later, Lao Gudong also came in with a very unsightly expression on his face.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan cupped her chin in her hands. "From both your expressions, is it possible that the parents you ran into are Hu Su's, from the remedial class?"</p>

    <p>The female teacher nearby was surprised. "Teacher Pan, how can you tell?"</p>

    <p>"After all, these are the most difficult parents to deal with in our school." Teacher Pan looked at the young female teacher. "You haven't been posted at Number 60 High School for very long, but you'll become acquainted with them sooner or later."</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan dropped her forehead into her hand with a bitter smile. "This Hu Su has already repeated a year four times in our Number 60 High School... and he's still in Grade One's remedial class."</p>

    <p>The female teacher: "Our Number 60 High School only has one remedial class, right? And although it's the remedial class, it has the best teacher!"</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan shook her head. "It's useless; for students who are truly unable to study, even joining with Lord Wen Qu Xing <sup>1</sup> won't be of any use."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Wen Qu Xing is one of the nine Emperor Gods, or the nine stars around the Big Dipper, and is the god of language and culture.)</dfn>

    <p>The female teacher: "..."</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong leaned against the wall and sighed. "Hu Su's mother is too much. It's fine if she just scolded me, but she even jabbed a finger in Old Ye's face and called him trash... She asked him why he was so bad in teaching her kid to study, to the point that the boy had eaten the fruit to become stronger. The problem is, Old Ye is just a PE teacher!"</p>

    <p>The female teacher: "..."</p>

    <p>"If Old Li the school guard hadn't held her back, it looked like Hu Su's mother would have started a fight. We've already found a psychiatrist to calm her down, and Headmaster Chen has personally gone to see her."</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong patted his face helplessly. This was the first time that he didn't even have the appetite to eat some latiao . "Why did we end up with this kind of parent..."</p>

    <p>"There's no help for it."</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan also spread her hands. She gazed at the frustrated Teacher Ye on the side and racked her brain for something comforting to say.</p>

    <p>Any teacher, even one who taught PE, would suffer a blow to their pride when their teaching ability was called into question. There was a saying that a master could lead you to the door, but the rest was up to you; after the dishes were cooked, you had to learn to eat it yourself... teachers nowadays were eager to personally feed their students, but unfortunately there were some students who were still too lazy to open their mouths.</p>

    <p>There truly wasn't anything else that could be done.</p>

    <p>"Teacher Ye, don't feel too depressed..."</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan crouched down and pointed out the window. "Look! A sky full of stars!" <sup>2</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is adapted from the first line in the closing song of the Chinese cartoon "Spiritpact." Fans joked that they 'didn't want to see stars,' or that they didn't want the episode to end ..)</dfn>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Teacher Ye lifted his head, his face expressionless.</p>

    <p>The breakroom had also lapsed into temporary silence because of Teacher Ye's dispirited mood. Every teacher would have their abilities called into question in the course of their career. For the older teachers, this was already a common occurrence, while the younger ones who saw Teacher Ye's miserable state felt a little panic sprout in their hearts.</p>

    <p>However, as a pioneer teacher at Number 60 High School, Teacher Pan was indeed Teacher Pan.</p>

    <p>She immediately analyzed the overall situation. "I actually have a deep understanding of situations like Teacher Ye's today. A small number of parents often do question my teaching ability. As a teacher who has been on the front line of Number 60 High School for many years, I suggest that all of us teachers should learn to cultivate a positive attitude."</p>

    <p>"Then... what should we do?" asked the young female teacher.</p>

    <p>"It's very simple," Teacher Pan replied. "Can't you shift the blame onto someone else? Even though I teach the elite class, in my first lesson every year, I stress again and again that they're the worst class I've ever taught!"</p>

    <p>The teachers: "..." This was a popular phrase in the teachers' circle, and now they'd finally found its source!</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan looked at Teacher Ye and smiled. "Teacher Ye, don't be too discouraged. A parent might have ridiculed you today, but at least you still don't have a girlfriend yet! There's still half a year left! We should strive to look ahead!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Teacher Ye couldn't help the tears that streamed down his cheeks as he felt even more grieved.</p>
