  <h1>Chapter 213 All of You Have Overlooked a Bug </h1>

  <div>

    <p>The question which the old Secretary had raised was certainly not a superfluous one. If the magic artifacts weren't easy to use, it would indeed greatly slow down the pace. The group of experts had predicted that from beginning to end, after over ten thousand people battled it out on the map to be the last ones standing and the outcome of the contest was decided, the survival drill would take three days. This deadline would force students to enhance their ability to adapt and to work with one another. At the same time, this was the optimal time limit to ensure that it would be an exciting drill.</p>

    <p>But if the magic artifacts as an unpredictable factor would have an impact on the time limit, that would be disastrous.</p>

    <p>"How about limited drops of instruction manuals near the map?" Immortal Toya immediately asked.</p>

    <p>Secretary Dakang nodded. "I also thought about that. Moreover, we can make it into something like an electronic illustrated handbook. Students only need to scan a magic artifact, and the handbook will automatically explain it to them. This can also help students understand the characteristics of each magic artifact. What do you think?"</p>

    <p>Headmaster Jin of Number 59 High School shook his head. "I have no objections."</p>

    <p>"No objections." The others agreed one after another.</p>

    <p>"Good, then that's settled." The old Secretary looked at the little notebook. "Then the next issue has to do with the number of people participating in the survival drill. In total, there are over ten thousand students, but the students from Number 59 High School and Number 60 High School together add up to less than eight hundred."</p>

    <p>This issue of parity in the military exercise was in fact a very serious one.</p>

    <p>"How can it be so little?" Headmaster Sun of Shenye High School frowned.</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen sighed pitifully. "Even though right now we are key city candidates, we naturally can't compare with true key city high schools. Our annual enrollment numbers are limited. Four hundred new enrollments is already the most we get every year..."</p>

    <p>With his remark, Headmaster Chen had laid bare the problem. A key city high school, on the other hand, could easily get a thousand enrollments every year.</p>

    <p>The other headmasters all had helpless expressions. They had actually overlooked such a problem. Even though a big highlight of this military training exercise was the contest between two key city high school candidates against four key city high schools, if student numbers weren't equal, there in fact wouldn't be any point to this competition.</p>

    <p>"That's why now, we can only come up with checks and balances in other ways," the old Secretary said. "In our survival drill this time, the students will be sent into the sky above the map using a magic array, and then they will be dropped together. I have a suggestion... what do you think about setting up the array so that the students of Number 59 High School and Number 60 High School are dropped in zones where the magic artifacts are more concentrated?"</p>

    <p>"I have no objections."</p>

    <p>Headmaster Hong of Jinyuan High School added, "This is indeed an unfair situation; I think we can also give each child from Number 60 High School and Number 59 High School an illustrated handbook of the magic artifacts. What do you think?"</p>

    <p>The other headmasters nodded their heads again. "Mm, that would be fine. We have no complaints."</p>

    <p>It was only eight hundred people; in the eyes of these headmasters, it was utter nonsense to think that this eight hundred could stand against over nine thousand students from the other four schools combined.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>It was only Immortal Toya whose lips couldn't help but twitch slightly.</p>

    <p>There were only eight hundred students in total from Number 59 High School and Number 60 High School... but among them was Ling Zhenren this bug in the system!</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya felt that he could already see this story's ending.</p>

    <p>"When will the transmission begin?" Headmaster Chen asked after they had more or less discussed everything.</p>

    <p>The old Secretary looked at the time and replied, "We'll start tonight at six o'clock."</p>

    <p>"So soon? Don't the students have training?"</p>

    <p>"It's only in unexpected situations that we can test these children's ability to adapt. As for the conventional military training, that can be carried out after the drill," said the old Secretary.</p>

    <p>Saying that, he turned his gaze to Zhuo Yi. "Is the transmission array ready?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi nodded seriously. "Yes, everything's been prepared. Before the children arrived at the military base, the transmission array had already been secretly set up around the dormitory building. Once the array is activated, all the students in the dormitory will be instantly sent to the map for the drill this time."</p>

    <p>Some of the headmasters were a little astonished when they heard this. They had initially thought that the students would need to assemble first before everyone entered the magic array together; they had completely never expected this type of operation. This meant that the students would be sent directly to the map completely unprepared.</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, Zhuo Yi sighed lightly. "The only thing we're missing now is the signature of Reliance High School's Headmaster Yue. Once he signs, we'll be able to activate the array."</p>

    <p>"Hm... call him right away. Tell him this is an order: I want him here in ten minutes. Otherwise, Reliance High School will straightaway lose the right to practice in the drill! And Little Zhuozi, tell him that if he isn't here in ten minutes, his Reliance High School will very likely be demoted next year," said the old Secretary.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Would this be too severe?"</p>

    <p>"Not at all." Secretary Dakang shook his head in pain and let out a sigh with deep feelings only he could understand. "He's at the police station now, right? I'm worried that in the time he's drinking tea, he'll start thinking about going into seclusion."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The sky in the western outskirts of Songhai city was crowded with stars. That evening, all the students were called back into the dormitory to fill in their camp handbooks with their details.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling knew that this had been deliberately arranged by the headmasters of the six schools with the purpose of gathering all the students inside the dormitory.</p>

    <p>He had already earlier on discovered the magic array which had been set up around the dormitory building. The survival drill this time was definitely going to be a sudden ambush; what the six headmasters were plotting in their hearts was clear as crystal to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The only thing that worried him a little was those exotic magic treasures which General Yi had developed. God knew what kind of crazy stuff they could pick up on the map this time.</p>

    <p>After filling in his handbook, he sat thinking on the bed. At that moment, there was movement outside the door â€” it was Wang Ming returning with his three new little brothers.</p>

    <p>"Second brother, please take a seat!" As soon as they entered the room, Chen Chao pulled a chair out like a lackey for Wang Ming to sit in, then looked at Guo Hao and Su Xiao. "You two, go and pour second brother a glass of water!"</p>

    <p>He then rolled up his sleeves and planned to help Wang Ming massage his shoulders. Just as he placed his hands on Wang Ming's shoulders, the other man straightaway shivered. "What are you doing?"</p>

    <p>He turned his head to look at Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao answered truthfully, "Second brother just showed us how to cultivate the Non-Showy Wave, and it must have been hard on you. Our family is into physical education, and I learned from my dad how to knead acupuncture points. I just want to help second brother massage your shoulders."</p>

    <p>"It's fine, it's fine, I'm not tired..."</p>

    <p>As Wang Ming said this, he actually felt a little diffident.</p>

    <p>Given his muggle body, he was keenly aware of what the consequences would be if this person at the Foundation Establishment stage massaged his shoulders.</p>

    <p>He couldn't help sweating. He had just narrowly avoided having the bones in his shoulders shatter...</p>
