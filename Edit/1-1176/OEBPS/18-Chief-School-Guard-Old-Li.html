  <h1>Chapter 18 Chief School Guard Old Li </h1>

  <div>

      

      <p>After so many years, Wang Ling finally realized the truth of one of Father and Mother Wang's guidelines for him growing up — knowledge is power!</p>

      <p>The killer didn't even know the basic law of physics, that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction... Wang Ling felt that the murder industry needed to place more emphasis on a cultural education. Even then, Wang Ling still underestimated the damage caused by the backlash from his body.</p>

      <p>Xu Ying was now truly dead. Though he had just passed out earlier, the backlash had been too powerful, causing severe trauma to the golden core inside his body.</p>

      <p>Wang Ling probed Xu Ying's body with his spiritual senses, and discovered that the golden core had completely tarnished to a color darker than Mylikes <sup>1</sup> . It no longer had any shape, having directly broken down like porridge in his <em>dantian </em><sup>2</sup> ...</p>

      <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Mylikes is a brand of chocolate in China that are a solid dark brown in color.)</dfn>

      <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Dantian is a concept in traditional Chinese medicine translated to "sea of qi.")</dfn>

      <p>The rooftop was usually completely closed off. If Xu Ying's body was found here, the rumors might turn it into yet another mysterious school incident.</p>

      <p>To avoid stirring up trouble, Wang Ling had to move the corpse to a relatively visible place.</p>

      <p>Under the shade of the trees on the sports field seemed like a good spot.</p>

      <p>Carrying Xu Ying's body over took less than five seconds, and Wang Ling was about to teleport back.</p>

      <p>However, a voice abruptly came from behind him. "Who are you?!"</p>

      <p>Wang Ling: "..." He didn't dare turn his head, but he felt a gaze burn into his back, making him feel uncomfortable from head to toe.</p>

      <p>But he was familiar with the owner of this voice, which was one that had been roughened by all that life had to offer. This was the distinctive voice of Old Li, the Chief School Guard.</p>

      <p>Wang Ling secretly thought <em>c rap </em>in his heart — Old Li was exactly the one person he had been trying hard to avoid, even more than teacher-in-charge Teacher Pan and the <em>fujoshi </em>Lin Xiaoyu.</p>

      <p>He had said previously that there was talent hiding in Number 60 High School, with Lao Gudong being one of them. Old Li's prowess, in fact, was also very fearsome.</p>

      <p>When Old Li saw the school uniform Wang Ling was wearing, he frowned and asked in an interrogative tone, "Are you a student of our school?" This was an occupational habit — he had become Chief School Guard at Number 60 High School after retiring as Captain of the Seven Stars Cultivation Special Forces.</p>

      <p>Seeing that Wang Ling still hadn't said anything, he stared hard at the body which Wang Ling had put down. "Were you the one who killed him?"</p>

      <p>Wang Ling didn't want to admit to it, because to be precise... this person had killed himself. How could he be blamed for Xu Ying punching his immortal body and then dying due to the backlash? There was no way he was going to be made culpable for that!</p>

      <p>Old Li: "..." Although he was only looking at this person's back, his intuition told him that it was definitely this guy who had done it!</p>

      <p>"Turn around!" he shouted again, a warning in his voice.</p>

      <p>Wang Ling still didn't move. Right now, he really wanted to knock the old man out, but he was afraid that he wouldn't be able to hold back his power, and might directly kill him.</p>

      <p>"Turn around! Hurry up!" Old Li shouted a second time.</p>

      <p>This time, Wang Ling turned around helplessly, but only enough so that half his profile was still concealed.</p>

      <p>"Turn all the way around!" Old Li enunciated each word, impatience now evident in his tone.</p>

      <p>Wang Ling finally turned around, but he covered his face with his hands. The Great Transfiguration Spell really took too long to cast, and Wang Ling was already at his wits' end.</p>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p>Old Li: "Put your hands down!" Damn it! How many persistent and extremely vicious criminals had he interrogated before? He had never needed to yell at them more than three times.</p>

      <p>Wang Ling sighed in his heart, and finally put his hands down as he completely gave up on resisting.</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>Perhaps this was fate...</p>

      <p>The instant Old Li saw Wang Ling's real face, he couldn't help shouting, "Holy shit!... Consultant Wang?"</p>

      <p>Wang Ling guessed his cover was blown when he saw the old man's excited expression.</p>

      <p>Old Li rubbed his eyes, and his dark pupils swept carefully up and down Wang Ling, to confirm that he wasn't seeing things... the person standing in front of him was the special spells consultant whom the Seven Stars Cultivation Special Forces had specifically hired three years ago — Wang Ling!</p>

      <p>"..." Wang Ling still said nothing. The dumbest thing he had probably done ever since he was born was to become a temporary spells consultant for the Seven Stars Cultivation Special Forces for two days three years ago...</p>

      <p>And the biggest pain in the ass was that this old man, whom he had only ever encountered during that time, not only hadn't forgotten him, but after retirement, was freaking causing trouble by being at the same school.</p>

      <p>A Nascent Soul heavyweight running here to become a school guard? What was<em>he </em>thinking?</p>

      <p>An unrivalled superhuman running to an ordinary high school to study? What was <em>he </em>thinking?</p>

      <p>In that moment, the two individuals who were seeing each other for the first time in three years unexpectedly shared the same thought.</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>After an enigmatic silence, Old Li gave the body on the ground a weak glance; only then did he realize that this Red Ribbon killer was one of the internationally famous Three Young Masters of Burying Love, Eldest Young Master Xu Ying.</p>

      <p>Examining him with his spiritual senses, Old Li was immediately shocked. Damn, his death was too horrible! From the skull to the bones of the toes, there was nowhere on the whole body that had been left unharmed; it was as if everything had broken down.</p>

      <p>These, however, were not critical. For a Golden Core cultivator, even if his meridians were all broken and his bones all fractured, he could still recover as long as his golden core was safe.</p>

      <p>But Xu Ying's golden core wasn't just broken... it had completely broken down to nothing!</p>

      <p>Seeing this injury, and Wang Ling standing hale and hearty before him, Old Li immediately knew what had happened.</p>

      <p>It was definitely this guy who had stupidly attacked Wang Ling first — he had become like this because of the backlash! Only Wang Ling had such power.</p>

      <p>Old Li remembered the last mission he had run three years ago before his retirement from the Seven Stars Cultivation Special Forces...</p>

      <p>At that time, the foreign terrorist cultivation organization Dark Night had attempted to unlock the Gate Between Worlds, and planned to attack major cities in countries all over the world at night. After receiving the alert, Old Li's team had immediately set out to stop Dark Night's terrorist activities. In the end, all seven members of the team had fallen prey to Dark Night's scheme, and when they weren't careful, they had been sucked into the Gate Between Worlds.</p>

      <p>Old Li would never forget those three hellish days!</p>

      <p>The Gate Between Worlds was filled with poisonous smog and the gases from corpses, and they hadn't been able to find any water or any herbal medicines to replenish their spirit energy. But the most fearful thing of all was the horde of demon kings that lurked there. Just one set loose would wreak untold devastation on any modern city.</p>

      <p>For three whole days they had struggled, separated and scattered...</p>

      <p>In the end, only three of the seven remained alive.</p>

      <p>Old Li had thought he was going to be buried there.</p>

      <p>But at this critical moment, Wang Ling had suddenly appeared, and he killed hundreds of demon kings, leaving a trail of blood in his wake. He searched for and found everyone, and brought all seven of them back.</p>

      <p>Wang Ling remembered that at the time, Old Li's group had fallen unconscious from the toxic smog, so he hadn't thought to erase their memories.</p>

      <p>Wang Ling hadn't at all expected that Old Li would actually still be conscious on the trip back to their world... and he had gotten a good look at the person who had saved them.</p>

      <p>For the rest of his life, he would never ever forget that moment...</p>

      <p>Wang Ling had merely been a temporary spells consultant arranged for the team by their superiors. Old Li and his team despised these spells consultants; in their eyes, they were a bunch of idiots who only knew theory and nothing else.</p>

      <p>Hence, almost no one had liked Wang Ling when he joined the team.</p>

      <p>Old Li had never imagined that in the end, the person who had saved them would actually be Wang Ling. He had been able to bring all of them out of the Gate Between Worlds, after slaying hundreds of demon kings... this level of power was almost beyond what he could comprehend.</p>

      <p>By the time he had been discharged from the hospital after his recovery, Wang Ling had already left, vanishing without a trace.</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>For Wang Ling, the fact that he had been forced to become a temporary spells consultant for two days three years ago had been a pure accident. And entering the Gate Between Worlds and revealing his true power to bring everyone back had also purely been due to his humanitarian nature.</p>

      <p>In this world, there were not many people who knew of his true power, and Wang Ling knew who they were. But as it turned out, he had overlooked Old Li.</p>

      <p>However, Old Li also didn't know the whole story.</p>

      <p>He had always thought that Wang Ling just looked very young, and was in fact a monster who was thousands of years old.</p>

      <p>But the truth was...</p>

      <p>This year, Wang Ling really was only sixteen years old...</p>
