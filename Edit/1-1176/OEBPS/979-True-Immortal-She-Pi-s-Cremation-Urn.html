  <h1>Chapter 979 True Immortal She Pi's Cremation Urn</h1>

  <div>

    <p>More than ten years ago, True Immortal She Pi was found guilty by Huaxiu Alliance, stripped of all his power, and sentenced to death. Before he died, True Immortal She Pi bore an egg which he entrusted to General Yi. The baby born from the egg was none other than Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>Actually, Fang Xing had never given up investigating his biological father's death all this time, but had still been unable to find anything.</p>

    <p>As he listened to Fang Xing's story on the road, Bai Youquan couldn't help the strange expression that crossed his face. "So, you're not human?"</p>

    <p>"You're the one who isn't human..."</p>

    <p>"But humans are mammals. You popped out of a freaking egg! Wouldn't someone say you're copying Demon King Piccolo <sup>1</sup> ?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(From "Dragonball.")</dfn>

    <p>"Chickens are also born from eggs..."</p>

    <p>"That's true..."</p>

    <p>Bai Youquan had captured Fang Xing. At that very moment, they were in a spirit car. This was a unique vehicle made of a very peculiar material; it would never leak engine oil, nor cause a female graduate student to cry sitting on the hood of the engine <sup>2</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Alluded to in the doggerel
about the Mercedes-Benz in
Chapter 977.)</dfn>

    <p>"True Immortal She Pi's death that year was very strange. He was Devil Emperor Gua Pi's disciple and had always worked behind the scenes. But after Devil Emperor Gua Pi was arrested, True Immortal She Pi suddenly led a large devil army in revolt, which was completely unlike the way he normally did things and rather peculiar." Bai Youquan was puzzled.</p>

    <p>Before setting out to capture Fang Xing, he had also done his homework.</p>

    <p>"You also think there's something wrong with how my father died?"</p>

    <p>"It's just a gut feeling; I think there might be a hidden story here. But True Immortal She Pi has been dead for more than a decade; there's not much meaning in discussing this now." Speaking up to this point, Bai Youquan fixed his gaze on Fang Xing. "Actually, I don't hate you. I can even help you."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing: "Help me?"</p>

    <p>Bai Youquan: "Haven't you always wanted to know the truth of what happened that year? With my father's current strength, it would take no effort at all."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Fang Xing fell silent.</p>

    <p>"I know what you're thinking; you're trying to come up with a way to escape in your head. If you had gone all out in your intrinsic spirit field just now, it wouldn't have been so easy for me to take you away." Bai Youquan laughed. "You deliberately gave up so easily because you wanted me to take you to our base before you secretly sent the information to your comrades, isn't that right?"</p>

    <p>Fang Xing remained silent. He had never expected Bai Youquan this person to be so perceptive.</p>

    <p>"Since Classmate Fang isn't saying anything, then it looks like I guessed right." Bai Youquan leaned back comfortably in his seat. He didn't think much of Fang Xing's abilities at all, and was even less worried that Fang Xing would suddenly attack him.</p>

    <p>Bai Youquan laughed. "So, Classmate Fang Xing, don't go looking for trouble. The address you gave me earlier for where Immortal She Pi's cremation urn is hidden was fake, wasn't it?</p>

    <p>"After you were born, some of the Ten Generals were worried that the great power you inherited would become a danger to everyone in the future, so they raised you in secret until you were four years old, then sent you to the private school Tianshi Imperial High, which had many other children with unusual gifts who had similarly lost their parents.</p>

    <p>"However, the children who come out of Tianshi Imperial High are reclusive, so in many cases, no family is willing to adopt them.</p>

    <p>"But you were lucky; you met your foster parents of the Fang clan, who also currently run a noodle shop. Later, you had the opportunity to transfer to Number 60 High."</p>

    <p>"What else do you know..." Fang Xing frowned. He felt that he had thoroughly underestimated Bai Youquan. This person knew more than he thought.</p>

    <p>"I know everything about you." Bai Youquan smiled. "You transferred to Number 60 High to search for your childhood hero. It was all for that Classmate Wang Ling, wasn't it?"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Fang Xing couldn't help the way his eyes widened.</p>

    <p>There was no way anyone could know that! He had never mentioned it to anyone before!</p>

    <p>"Are you overwhelmed, Classmate Fang?" Bai Youquan chuckled. "I may as well tell you the truth. In this newly established organization, my father is nothing more than a foot soldier - our master is far stronger than you can ever imagine."</p>

    <p>Listening to Bai Youquan's words, Fang Xing felt for the first time an unprecedented sense of danger. The enemy this time was indeed nothing like any other adversary he had ever faced before.</p>

    <p>Not only did the other side have unknown, matchless strength, they had a frightening information network that could discover things no ordinary enemy could possibly know.</p>

    <p>"Since things have come to this point, I don't think Classmate Fang needs to keep anything from us. The organization welcomes you with open arms; you should cherish this opportunity." Bai Youquan crossed his legs as he spoke. He didn't need to drive; the spirit car was in full automatic cruise mode and could steer itself.</p>

    <p>But Bai Youquan knew that the address Fang Xing had given him was fake, so from the beginning, the car had just been going around the city in circles without actually going anywhere.</p>

    <p>"What exactly do you want me to do?" Fang Xing sighed.</p>

    <p>"To show us your sincerity, Classmate Fang can hand over True Immortal She Pi's urn first, then we'll discuss the deal. Classmate Fang can rest assured that we have no interest in the urn; we just need some of the ashes," Bai Youquan said.</p>

    <p>"Are you going to make milk <sup>3</sup> ...?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(In episode 13 of the Chinese
sitcom "iPartment," Lin
Wanyu wonders if Zeng
Xiaoxian mistook ashes for
milk powder and made
himself something to drink
from it.)</dfn>

    <p>"There's no point in Classmate Fang asking these questions. If you want to know about your father, it's very simple: we just need to resurrect him and you can ask him yourself." Bai Youquan said, "You are his son, I don't believe he'll hide anything from you, and you will finally get the answers you have been looking for all these years."</p>

    <p>"Then, wait one moment."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing drew in a deep breath.</p>

    <p>The next instant, his belly promptly swelled up. Bai Youquan seemed to know what Fang Xing was going to do, and he exclaimed in disbelief, "WTF, did you eat your dad's urn?"</p>

    <p>Fang Xing didn't say anything. Moments later, he spat out a small black iron box that was plain and unadorned.</p>

    <p>Immortal She Pi's ashes were contained within.</p>

    <p>The entire box was well preserved.</p>

    <p>Heedless of where it came from, Bai Youquan picked up the box and used his sleeve to wipe off the drool before taking a selfie with it.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing: "???"</p>

    <p>Bai Youquan: "Don't get me wrong, I'm not revealing any information on the cremation urn; I just want to post a commemorative selfie. Actually, I've always been a fan of True Immortal She Pi. Us fans are called iShes, and our fan club numbers are no less than iKuns <sup>4</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>4</sup>(Idol singer Cai Xukun's fan club.)</dfn>

    <p>Fang Xing: "..."</p>

    <p>But right after Bai Youquan finished speaking, there was suddenly a blare of sirens next to the spirit car.</p>

    <p>"Police?"</p>

    <p>Bai Youquan rolled down the window, but the person outside wasn't wearing a police uniform.</p>

    <p>It was a young man in sportswear and wearing a helmet, who had a megaphone on him. "Hello, this is Visual China <sup>5</sup> . The selfie you just took is an infringement of our image copyright. Please pay the copyright fee, friend!"</p>
