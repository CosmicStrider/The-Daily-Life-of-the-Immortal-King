  <h1>Chapter 138 I Have a Bold Idea </h1>

  <div>

    <p>"It looks like this is the real information that Third Saint wanted to give us. The accounts on top of it were just for pretend." Lord Diulei suddenly got a little excited.</p>

    <p>Whether it was him or Wang Ling, both of them had experienced Mo Immortal Castle's foolproof way of doing things. However, to err was human; even with cultivators, no matter how meticulous their thinking was, they could still make mistakes.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei flipped the bag and poured out its contents. Apart from a gray notebook, there was also a glass bottle filled with a black-colored liquid.</p>

    <p>"What's this?" Lord Diulei opened the bottle and took a whiff. It had a refreshing smell similar to <em>pipagou </em><sup>1</sup> , which instantly surprised him. "This... isn't this the legendary essential balm which can make a female broadcast host feel like she wants to die <sup>2</sup> ?!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>('Pi Pa Gou' is a traditional
Chinese herbal syrup for
coughs.)</dfn>
    
    <br/>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is a reference to a
well-known female live
streamer Han Xiya, who
once put essential balm on
her private parts when a
viewer said he would send
her money as a gift for it.
Five seconds after she
applied it, she started to cry
from the pain, and when
she couldn't wash it off, she
ended up going to the
hospital. She never got the
money ..)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling was already too tired to mock this man who acted like a lunatic from time to time. "..."</p>

    <p>"This doesn't seem to be a body-refining liquid, and its ingredients are a little odd."</p>

    <p>Under Wang Ling's dead fish gaze, the man in white finally became a little more serious. He carefully put down the glass bottle and flipped open the gray notebook next to it.</p>

    <p>As he continued to page through it, his expression became darker and darker before he finally exclaimed, "This...! This is big news! Brother Ling!"</p>

    <p>While Lord Diulei had been going through the notebook, Wang Ling had been reading his mind at the same time.</p>

    <p>Then, both of them sat on the sofa in the same pose, chins cupped in their hands as they began to stare at this black potion in deep contemplation.</p>

    <p>According to what was written in the gray notebook, this black potion was the very first in a range of strength-reinforcing drugs developed by Mo Immortal Castle and designed for cultivators who had no other way of further improving their realms; it would consume a cultivator's lifespan and cause the body to mutate and display formidable strength far beyond a person's realm!</p>

    <p>Of course, this wasn't the most important thing.</p>

    <p>The most critical thing was what the second half of the notebook contained; it was data on medical experiments which Mo Immortal Castle, in its guise as an education institution, was performing on their students!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei frowned fiercely, his eyes flashing with hatred. "Who would have thought Mo Immortal Castle would do this sort of insane thing behind the scenes! No matter what, they shouldn't harm the flowers of the motherland!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling also frowned, then thought of something before directly telling Lord Diulei about it telepathically. The latter nodded immediately. "Brother Ling, don't worry. I'll deliver this drug to Immortal Toya myself straightaway. Given his experience, it shouldn't be a problem for him to determine the ingredients in it."</p>

    <p>Saying that, the man sighed deeply.</p>

    <p>"Nowadays, those who have money depend on equipment, while those who have no money depend on mutation. I never thought that this saying would be so true..."</p>

    <p>In that moment, Lord Diulei felt really grieved about this strength-reinforcing mutation drug. He felt that this was similar to when cultivators had once persistently held on to legacy as a last resort in their quest for instant success. For the sake of their realms, they were willing to defy the natural order of things and try unscrupulous methods. For their realms, they racked their brains for shortcuts they could take.</p>

    <p>However, since ancient times in the cultivation world, the powerful cultivators who could rise above everyone else and receive the people's reverence had always been those who relied on their own cultivation, accumulating it a little at a time and moving forward step by step.</p>

    <p>That was right, there were no shortcuts to immortality to begin with.</p>

    <p>"There are no shortcuts on the cultivation path. Why are there so many people who don't get this?" Lord Diulei's heart was very tired. He had been promoting cultivation values in the cultivation forum all these years... but it was all for nothing!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After obtaining this lead from the silk brocade bag, Lord Diulei left the Wang family's small villa in a very depressed mood.</p>

    <p>Before he left, he still hadn't forgotten to ask Wang Ling to personally give Grandfather Wang his broccoli.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't know what this man was planning to do next.</p>

    <p>It was because Mo Immortal Castle wouldn't be easy to deal with... if it had just been a small, ordinary organization, given this Great Death-Courting Senior's personality, he would have erupted in fury much earlier on and would have definitely rushed over to Mo Immortal Castle straightaway, bursting with righteousness, to wreak havoc.</p>

    <p>But looking at the current situation, they clearly didn't have enough to warrant him doing so.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei still didn't have concrete evidence that Mo Immortal Castle was conducting experiments on the students. It was no use just relying on a notebook â€” there were some things that had to be seen to be believed.</p>

    <p>After leaving the Wang family's small villa, he called Little Black yet again. "Hello, Little Black? That's right, I have to trouble you again... I hope you can find out the addresses of several students for me. Oh, by the way, how's the restoration of the lab coming along?"</p>

    <p>On the other end, it was obvious that Little Black was already used to being bossed around. "Well, it's not bad... except for the Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon, basically almost everything else has been repaired. That... Brother Lei, last time you told me you would help me find the bastard who destroyed my lab. Are you sure about that?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei nodded solemnly. "Don't worry about that, I remember it! Once you have that cannon fixed, I'll straightaway look for Ling Zhenren and we'll use advanced spiritual senses to track down the bastard! Then we'll both bring the cannon with us and blow up the bastard's house!"</p>

    <p>Little Black: "Wouldn't that be a little too cruel?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Is there any point in talking with this kind of bastard? I tell you, Little Black, you're my brother! My brother's home was destroyed, I won't even let that bastard fart! When I find that person's address, I'll be the first to bring the cannon over and blow his place up! Just leave it to me!"</p>

    <p>Little Black: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei nodded. "Mm, so, please help me find the addresses for these students as soon as possible."</p>

    <p>Little Black: "What information do you have? The more you have, the quicker my search will be."</p>

    <p>This question made Lord Diulei frown, as the information given in the notebook was really limited. It only had data from the students' physical exams, such as age, height, weight and so on, along with changes in the data after the students had consumed the mutation drug. There really wasn't much of anything else.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Uh... there's not a lot of information."</p>

    <p>Little Black's heart thumped. "How much?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei replied precisely, "Height; weight; age; bust, waist and hip measurements; and the length and thickness of their Tower of Babel... oh, that's right, there are also medical records from when they were circumcised!"</p>

    <p>Little Black: "..."</p>

    <p>All of a sudden, a bold idea occurred to Lord Diulei. "Maybe we can start with the men's hospital first! Perhaps there will be some clues there. Check and see if they have group circumcisions or something... if we can get into their medical records, wouldn't we be able to track down the addresses then?"</p>

    <p>Little Black: "..."</p>
