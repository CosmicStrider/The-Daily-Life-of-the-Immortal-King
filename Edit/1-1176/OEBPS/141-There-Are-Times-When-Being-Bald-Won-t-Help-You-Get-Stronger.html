  <h1>Chapter 141 There Are Times When Being Bald Won't Help You Get Stronger </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Director Li entrusted the nurse in charge of this floor with the task of fetching them detailed information on the three students.</p>

    <p>All three of them were students from Foundation Establishment high schools. Furthermore, they were coincidentally all from Peiyuan district. One was from Jiancai High School, one from Shenye High School, and the third from Number 59 High School.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling saw this piece of information, his eyelids couldn't help twitching.</p>

    <p>After all, Number 59 High School had left him with plenty of "unforgettable" memories back then...</p>

    <p>Xie Hui?</p>

    <p>Looking at the information, Wang Ling wasn't able to place the face from the name alone.</p>

    <p>He lifted his eyes and started to carefully size up this teenager lying prone on the floor and learning to shoot out spider webs... the more he looked, the more he felt this guy looked familiar!</p>

    <p>In a split second, Wang Ling used the memory retrieval effect of the Great Memory Spell to finally recall the identity of that "Spiderman" teenager â€” this was delinquent senior He Buliang's <em>shamate </em>underling!</p>

    <p>The reason why Wang Ling hadn't recognized him at first glance was that the other party had shaved off his colorful <em>shamate </em>hair! Now he was a true baldie!</p>

    <p>"..." Looking at the current Xie Hui, Wang Ling sighed deeply in his heart. There were times when being bald really couldn't make you stronger... even if you ran and did push-ups every day and didn't have air-conditioning in summer, it was useless <sup>1</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is a reference to the
Japanese comic and cartoon
series One Punch Man. After
intensive training, the
protagonist becomes the
strongest person in the world,
but at the cost of all his hair.)</dfn>

    <p>"Does Brother Ling know this teenager?" Lord Diulei felt that Wang Ling's expression was a little different when he looked at this Xie Hui. Minute changes in his expression were actually easy to pick up because he usually had a poker face, so when there was the slightest ripple in it, you could tell.</p>

    <p>After serious consideration, Wang Ling nodded noncommittally.</p>

    <p>He didn't think he had any feelings for Number 59 High School, or felt any friendship for it.</p>

    <p>However, no matter what, he couldn't deny that it was a place that held memories for him...</p>

    <p>He stared at Xie Hui on the floor, frowning slightly. Then, with a flick of his fingers, the three teenagers in the ward unexpectedly all fell deeply asleep. Xie Hui, who had been on the floor crazily trying to learn how to shoot out webs like Spiderman, had already collapsed and was snoring away. After that, Wang Ling used a Gravitation Spell to lift Xie Hui onto the bed before he heaved a sigh.</p>

    <p>This was the calamity which these three people were destined to experience; whatever the result was, Wang Ling couldn't interfere.</p>

    <p>The only thing he could do was just this.</p>

    <p>To recklessly meddle with heavenly law was to invite its wrath.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt very tired. He was just a sixteen-year-old high school student!</p>

    <p>"They actually calmed down..." Director Li was startled when he saw this. He knew it had to be this Ling Zhenren wielding his remarkable abilities!</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling's Hibernation Spell can make those under its influence fall fast asleep for seven days; they won't wake up even if the sky falls down." Lord Diulei was very familiar with this trick because he had seen Wang Ling cast it when they had met several years ago. At that time, however, Wang Ling hadn't been able to cast it accurately yet, and with a wave of his hand, he had made a large number of living creatures lethargic and drowsy.</p>

    <p>Director Li's realm wasn't high, so he revered both Lord Diulei and Wang Ling from the bottom of his heart.</p>

    <p>After all, a lot of hospital patients couldn't sleep because they were tormented by pain. Ordinary people could take a sleeping pill or a sedative shot to solve the problem, but with cultivators, most of them had bodies that were resistant to common drugs.</p>

    <p><em>It would be wonderful if I can learn this Hibernation Spell! Then mother never has to worry about my studies </em><sup>2 </sup><em>!</em></p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This line is from a Chinese TV

    <p>But Director Li clearly knew that this was just a pipe dream... he probably wouldn't ever be able to learn this type of remarkable ability in his whole life.</p>

    <p>Therefore, after Wang Ling had cast the spell, Director Li's eyes glowed as his reverence for this Ling Zhenren instantly came flooding out like a wild, non-stop deluge.</p>

    <p>While Director Li was sighing with feeling, he received a message, which just happened to be from his <em>shifu </em>Immortal Toya.</p>

    <p>After reading it, he couldn't help frowning.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "What is it?"</p>

    <p>Director Li looked very worried. " <em>Shifu </em>says that the ingredients in the drug are very unique. This is more troublesome than he had expected. Even after a while he still hasn't been able to determine what they are."</p>

    <p>As he said this, Immortal Toya sent another message. This time, it was a picture of a laboratory report.</p>

    <p>"Even Brother Toya is stumped?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei instantly felt this was strange, because nowadays, except for the presidium of pharmacists employed by Huaguo Water Curtain Group and pharmacists from the Xiao clan, he really couldn't think of anyone else who could be stronger than Immortal Toya when it came to the manufacturing of medicine.</p>

    <p>This was a brand new clue for him.</p>

    <p>It was well worth investigating whether there were people from Huaguo Water Curtain Group or the Xiao clan colluding with Mo Immortal Castle.</p>

    <p>"We can only wait for <em>shifu's </em>next message, but with these preliminary test results, we can still analyze the medicinal properties of the mutation potion."</p>

    <p>After saying this, Director Li suddenly thought of something, then spoke to Wang Ling. "I wonder... would Ling Zhenren be able to cast the Hibernation Spell on a patient on the thirtieth floor?"</p>

    <p>"What is he suffering from?" Lord Diulei was really curious about the lunatic on the thirtieth floor.</p>

    <p>"He suffers serious paranoia and schizophrenia, and his innate resistance to drugs is extremely high. We've tried all kinds of treatments, but there has been little to no effect." Director Li sighed. "The main issue is that this patient insists that he is the descendant of the Desolation Heavenly Emperor <sup>3</sup> ..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(The 'Desolation Heavenly
Emperor' is the nickname of
the main character in the
Chinese web novel 'Perfect
World.')</dfn>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>"When we walked in, did you see the fountain downstairs? That's the most troublesome!"</p>

    <p>Speaking of this, Director Li's head started to hurt. "That patient insists that he is capable of the Kunpeng Technique <sup>4</sup> , and is determined to jump from the thirtieth floor into the fountain..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>4</sup>(The kunpeng technique is an
inherited martial arts
technique from 'Perfect
World.')</dfn>

    <p>"Why?"</p>

    <p>Director Li: "He thinks... that fountain is <em>dayuhaitang </em><sup>5</sup> ."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>5</sup>('Da Yu Hai Tang' as it is used
here is a homophone for the
Chinese animated fantasy film
'Big Fish &amp; Begonia.' The film
opens with the female
protagonist being transported
through a portal of water ..)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling and Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, on the ground floor of the hospital building, the man in a suit and Song Qingshu were still in communication with each other.</p>

    <p>In the last few minutes, after thinking hard for a very long time, Song Qingshu had made a difficult decision. "How about this, go look for someone... or you can do it yourself; go smash the car which they drove over. No matter what the situation is, or however much information they have, we must spoil their plans first! At the most we'll just pay for their wrecked car. How much can a car cost?"</p>

    <p>The man in a suit stared at the "car" which Lord Diulei and Wang Ling had rode over, and silently wiped his sweat. "Lord Director, are you sure you want to do this?"</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu curled his lip. "Just do as as I say! Why are you blabbering so much?! You won't be the one paying! Having said that... I want to know, what car does this Great Death-Courting Senior drive? A limited edition Aoguanhai? A limited edition Chuanjianguo?"</p>

    <p>"Uh, neither..."</p>

    <p>"Neither???"</p>

    <p>Cultivators seldom drove cars, and most chose to fly on their swords; however, it wasn't strange to own a car because on many occasions, driving a car could make one appear more classy.</p>

    <p>Hence, the cars bought by cultivators with high realms were generally all very expensive.</p>

    <p>Now Song Qingshu was really curious. "Then what car did they drive?"</p>

    <p>"Tricycle..." the man in a suit answered truthfully.</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu: "..."</p>
