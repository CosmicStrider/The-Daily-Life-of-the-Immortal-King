  <h1>Chapter 127 Evil Monarch Jun Xie </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Lord Diulei didn't know that this Guru Wang Situ who rode the whirlwind in the online novel industry was actually Father Wang. If he knew that the person he had simply commented on for the sake of raising his own appeal by mooching off this latest hot topic was the "Great Senior" from the Wang family's small villa, he would definitely regret it to no end...</p>

    <p>But there were really too many comments on Father Wang's post, and it was completely impossible for the eye to take them all in. The comments by that bunch of people from the cultivation forum couldn't catch up with the first wave, and were soon drowned out by other comments.</p>

    <p>One of the reasons why Father Wang's post had officially become a trending topic was largely due to Weibo support from the head of Exploding Sky Sect, Xu Que.</p>

    <p>Most crucially, that support included the Heavenly Way Bounty!</p>

    <p>Furthermore, after the Heavenly Way Bounty was issued, it immediately drew the concern and support of a lot of big names in the cultivation world, most of whom were actually friends of Head of Exploding Sky Sect Xu Que from the same cultivation circle.</p>

    <p>Someone with the ID Evil Monarch Jun Xie <sup>1</sup> and the profile information "CEO of Cultivation Hardware and Concealed Weapons Technology" forwarded Xu Que and Father Wang's posts, and expressed that they would add an extra million on top of the Heavenly Way Bounty which Head of Exploding Sky Sect Xu Que was offering!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Evil Monarch Jun Xie is the
protagonist in the web
novel 'Otherworldly
Monarch Evil.' The Chinese
characters in the name Jun
Xie君邪 are the reverse of
the term Evil Monarch 邪君,
which is the nickname Jun
Xie is known by in the novel.)</dfn>

    <p>Evil Monarch Jun Xie... this was the boss of Cultivation Hardware and Concealed Weapons Technology! This was also the one other institution competing with King Billy's Yidali Research Bureau for Unique Artifacts in the concealed weapons market!</p>

    <p>Yes, with Evil Monarch Jun Xie's participation, the issue exploded once again!</p>

    <p>In a short two hours after Father Wang had published his Weibo post, talk about "Wang Situ in a Fury over a Beauty" had shot up at the speed of a rocket and the post had already been read over one hundred million times; similar to the growth of Wang Ling's realm in the last two years, things were starting to get out of hand.</p>

    <p>Father Wang had made it clear in his post that he had called the police, but unfortunately, they couldn't handle the incident for various reasons. This also caused widespread public discontent — if a government official couldn't help the people obtain justice, he might as well just go home and sell sweet potatoes<sup>2</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Presumably, this is a
reference to a character in the
Chinese film 'Sesame Official.')</dfn>

    <p>Groping wasn't a big nor a small matter...</p>

    <p>The point was that after Father Wang had made use of his identity as Wang Situ to create online exposure on this issue, its significance in society had obviously changed.</p>

    <p>Many people immediately began to rebuke the cultivation police for their inaction.</p>

    <p>Very quickly, this incident drew the direct attention of the municipal bureau.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At midnight, Song Qingshu was bitterly writing "A Review Report on Post-War Losses."</p>

    <p>This time, two people among the Ten Saints had died, and even Third Saint had directly violated the agreement and betrayed the Lord of the Castle for some unknown reason... until now, Song Qingshu was still in the dark about it. Nevertheless, a report still had to be written, on what they had lost, what the next step in their plan was going to be, and their chances of success — all of it had to be calculated step by step.</p>

    <p>The only good news for him was that the Lord of the Castle wasn't really angry.</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu felt that given the ears and eyes which the Lord of the Castle had everywhere, he must have known that the person who insisted on fighting Mo Immortal Castle over the stone ghost mask had some influence and shouldn't be provoked. Nothing needed to be said if it had just been the Great Death-Courting Senior — however, the current problem was that behind this Great Death-Courting Senior was a top-class expert whose realm far surpassed Soul Formation!</p>

    <p>Who on earth was this man?</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu had utterly no idea how to find out who he was.</p>

    <p>His only lead was Third Saint, who had already completely cut off all ties with them — this entire puzzle could be solved if they could find Third Saint.</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu sighed, pen in one hand, and as he was thinking about how to word his report, there was the sound of a phone ringing.</p>

    <p>This red phone was an internal hotline for getting through to him directly.</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu gave the clock a somewhat annoyed look. Who would be looking for him at this hour?</p>

    <p>After pondering for a bit, he directly answered the phone. "Who is it?"</p>

    <p>"Hello, is that Brother Song? This is Zhou Jie!"</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu was stumped for a moment. "..."</p>

    <p>He knew too many people; there was no way he could remember all of them! If he had been at work, there was a telephone directory in his office full of numbers which he could flip through and check who it was.</p>

    <p>The problem, however, was that he was at home, and someone abruptly giving him a ring and saying he was so-and-so made him feel a little weary.</p>

    <p>He knew so many people with the surname Zhou... who the hell knew which one was Zhou Jie?!</p>

    <p>Fortunately, the man on the other end of the line knew himself very well. "I'm Green Gang's Zhou Jie, the one with big nostrils..."</p>

    <p>Oh... so it was the leader of Green Gang, Zhou Jie.</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu instantly got it.</p>

    <p>This was a well-known black Taoist <sup>3</sup> who had big nostrils, so his nickname was Large Nostrils. Actually, if the man had just used this nickname, Song Qingshu who have immediately known who he was.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(The pun here is that the
author has used牛鼻子,which
is an old and facetious way of
referring to a Daoist, and
which literally translates into
'the nose of an ox .. ')</dfn>

    <p>"Leader Zhou, what business do you have with me?" he asked.</p>

    <p>Green Gang was the largest and most powerful underground gang in Songhai city, and had shared a close relationship with Mo Immortal Castle when the latter had first been set up. Before Mo Immortal Castle had established its own intelligence network, a lot of their information had had to be passed through Green Gang at first.</p>

    <p>In the last few years, however, this relationship between Mo Immortal Castle and Green Gang had waned and they now only had some business dealings with each other. So Song Qingshu hadn't expected to suddenly receive a call from this leader of Green Gang whom he hadn't seen in quite a while.</p>

    <p>"Brother Song, I really don't know who to ask for help. I currently have a pretty troublesome problem. I don't know if you've heard about it... it's something that happened on Weibo recently..."</p>

    <p>After Zhou Jie spoke anxiously for a while, Song Qingshu laughed. "Wang Situ in a fury over a beauty? Is that a new punchline? I think I've read this online writer's books before... you're saying his wife was groped? <em>Ha ha ha ha </em>!"</p>

    <p>On the other end, the face of Zhou Jie, leader of Green Gang, instantly darkened. "The man who groped his wife was my younger cousin..."</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu abruptly stopped laughing. "..."</p>

    <p>Zhou Jie heaved a sigh. "It seems that Brother Song didn't know about this matter. But now it's become a huge deal... it's really troublesome!"</p>

    <p>Listening to Zhou Jie's subsequent explanation, the smile on Song Qingshu's face gradually disappeared and he no longer thought it all a joke. "You're saying... the head of Exploding Sky Sect, Xu Que, publicly announced a Heavenly Way Bounty on Weibo, which has been supported by countless cultivators, and Evil Monarch Jun Xie has even topped up the bounty?!"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Song Qingshu couldn't help sighing in his heart. This... was really troublesome!</p>

    <p>Could just anyone put out a Heavenly Way Bounty?! The only person qualified to do so was either a pope or the head of a sect. Even if it could be withdrawn, it couldn't be done so easily.</p>

    <p>The most important thing was that the head of Exploding Sky Sect, Xu Que, was a notoriously ruthless man... he was an existence that even Mo Immortal Castle didn't dare provoke.</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu: "I say, Leader Zhou, why didn't your younger cousin choose a better target? Instead he had to grope the wife of this online guru..."</p>

    <p>Zhou Jie: "Brother Song, I can only ask for your help with this! I only have this one younger cousin, please help me find a way to suppress this incident!"</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu was speechless. "Do you know how terrifying Guru Wang Situ's fans are? While that head of the Exploding Sky Sect is good at using Weibo, those big shots who don't use Weibo are probably now observing things in private!"</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu felt that his words weren't an exaggeration; after all, even the Lord of the Castle had also read the book <em>Let Go of that Wet Nurse </em>by Wang Situ! However, the Lord of the Castle didn't use Weibo...</p>

    <p>Over the phone, leader of Green Gang, Zhou Jie, gritted his teeth. "How about this, Brother Song, if you can help me suppress this incident, I'll give you a piece of information that will fire you up!"</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu thought for a while, then shook his head. "Too difficult!"</p>

    <p>He was about to hang up when Zhou Jie directly spoke up. "I know that Brother Song has been looking for the whereabouts of the maker of the stone ghost mask. I have a clue here... if Brother Song can help me, I'll give you the information!"</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu's finger had been centimeters away from pressing the end button, but when he heard Zhou Jie's words, his hand immediately paused. "What did you say?!"</p>
