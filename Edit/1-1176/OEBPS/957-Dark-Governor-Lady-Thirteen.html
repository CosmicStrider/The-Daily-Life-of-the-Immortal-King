  <h1>Chapter 957 Dark Governor Lady Thirteen</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The great war kicked off, and the six of them worked as one to campaign for votes and give out red packets for the monthly votes. In a short period of time, the number of people in Father Wang's book comments section gradually increased. Whether these readers had dashed over for the red packets from the treasure box, had seen the ad, or were here on the recommendation of fans, this was undoubtedly a good opportunity to grab attention with a mass update.</p>

    <p>Father Wang wasn't in the habit of stockpiling his drafts, and had prepared for the battle of rankings throughout the night yesterday. Now, he released 63,000-words' worth of chapters in one go.</p>

    <p>But he knew that it wasn't over and he couldn't relax yet. In a ranking competition, this update of mere tens of thousands of words was far from enough.</p>

    <p>Apart from that, he still had to ensure the quality of each updated chapter - this was the true key to success.</p>

    <p>Around noon, Father Wang moved up again in the rankings with the increase in his monthly votes. He now had twenty-four thousand votes, putting him in fifth place.</p>

    <p>Although it looked like Father Wang was catching up, Zhu Ge also didn't stop updating during this period, though he wasn't as fast as Father Wang. While he also released an update of six chapters, each chapter was actually only two thousand words long... However, this still excited passionate fan readers.</p>

    <p>"Countryman Zhu Ge Villager is really cunning... releasing six two thousand-word chapters..." The corner of Father Chen's mouth twitched; he knew that Zhu Ge was flaunting his strength to them.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, after what happened when Father Chen and his group tried campaigning for votes in the forum last night, it was very likely that Zhu Ge had already been on guard and had also prepared for battle.</p>

    <p>Looking at Father Chen's brow beaded with sweat as he was kept busy, Chen Chao and Wang Ling were also a little tense. Chen Chao was also reading <em>Wet Nurse </em>; as he watched Chen Yi push for votes, Chen Chao also took out his e-book reader to observe the changes in the ranking list. Burning with anger, he cheered passionately on the side: "Come on, Wang Situ! Go go, Wang Situ!"</p>

    <p>It wasn't until now that Chen Chao understood how powerful the allure of language could be. A mere novel could actually trigger a campaign involving thousands of people. An ordinary person might find it hard to imagine the scene, but Chen Chao in the end was just a four-year-old kid.</p>

    <p>His imagination was very strong, and he instantly imagined tens of thousands of people on a battlefield, throwing dictionaries like bricks at the enemy's faces. It was pandemonium.</p>

    <p>As for the rules for the ranking list, Wang Ling actually knew more than Chen Chao. He also read books, but not Father Wang's; it wasn't that this son didn't support his father.</p>

    <p>There were two reasons.</p>

    <p>Firstly, the protagonists in Father Wang's novels didn't eat crispy noodle snacks.</p>

    <p>Secondly, when he read his father's books, it was easy to picture Father Wang as the protagonist, which ruined his reading experience!</p>

    <p>Generally, if a person and an author knew each other well, it wasn't likely that the former would read the latter's books.</p>

    <p>Whether other people felt the same way or not, this was the case for Wang Ling at least. It was weird to read a novel written by someone you knew, especially if it was someone very close to you.</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling knew what the outcome for this ranking competition would be.</p>

    <p>But there were some things here that Wang Ling wasn't sure of.</p>

    <p>Because ultimately, he had changed the events of Chen Chao's memory; he had no idea how this small change might affect who the new Best Author was.</p>

    <p>In Wang Ling's memory, Father Wang had seized the crown as Best Author; furthermore, it had been a crushing defeat.</p>

    <p>After that, Father Wang reigned as champion in the monthly votes for six years running, setting a historical precedent.</p>

    <p>In the seventh year, Father Wang no longer wanted to compete for votes. At the authors' annual meeting, some of them had given him individual red packets and beseeched him to update a little slower... That way, they still had a chance in the ranking competition.</p>

    <p>And so, Father Wang threw his game a bit...</p>

    <p>Of course, he returned all those red packets.</p>

    <p>He had to consider the reputation of his peers and give them a fighting chance - after all, it wasn't very nice to dominate so harshly in a game.</p>

    <p>At that moment, the other sub-group leaders, along with Lin Gang as their head, were all sweating profusely as they polished up the wording in the promo ad before posting in various forums to campaign for votes.</p>

    <p>"Let's try harder." Father Chen boosted morale.</p>

    <p>"How much money do we have left?" asked Lin Gang.</p>

    <p>"Not much... Excluding the gifts just now and the votes campaign, we have a hundred thousand left," said Father Chen.</p>

    <p>"So fast..." (ΩДΩ) Lin Gang and the others were shaken.</p>

    <p>As expected, the monthly votes ranking wasn't something that small fry authors could play around with... Father Chen and his group didn't have the power to compete for rankings at all. This sort of activity which burned thousands of yuan no matter what was so excessive.</p>

    <p>They felt a little down; they knew that Zhu Ge's side was still just observing the situation and had yet to go all out. Today was the last day of December - there was still half a day left before the bell rang at midnight for the new year.</p>

    <p>Spending half of their funds had only gotten them up to fifth place in the list, and there was still so much time left.</p>

    <p>What should they do?</p>

    <p>Furthermore, this wasn't the worst news.</p>

    <p>Father Chen was pondering how to use the remaining one hundred thousand to the greatest extent when a colorful sticky suddenly appeared above the e-bookshelf! - This was a full ten million in book currency! Which was a hundred thousand yuan!</p>

    <p>"WTF, which fat cat is this? Which book is this gift for?" This sticky stupefied everyone present.</p>

    <p>They opened the treasure box and were aghast to see the book title.</p>

    <p>"It's Zhu Ge's <em>Shameless </em>..." Lin Gang instantly lost heart.</p>

    <p>"Who is this fat cat?"</p>

    <p>They looked at the ID.</p>

    <p>In the end, everyone's complexions paled.</p>

    <p>"Fuck, Dark Governor Lady Thirteen."</p>

    <p>"Lady Thirteen? She was reading Zhu Ge's <em>Shameless </em>?"</p>

    <p>In the dojo, everyone drew in sharp breaths.</p>

    <p>They never thought Zhu Ge would actually pull in this hallowed bigwig Dark Governor Lady Thirteen for help.</p>

    <p>She was the biggest fat cat on the Cultivation Reading Network, and also a big shot in the eyes of the readers. Basically, every book recommended by Dark Governor Lady Thirteen would draw countless readers; the power of one public recommendation by Lady Thirteen was no less than a recommendation on Qidian.</p>

    <p>Because she lived in Dark City, her original ID had been Dark City Lady Thirteen. Later, when she became popular with so many people, she became known as Lady Governor to her fans.</p>

    <p>So the "City" in Dark City Lady Thirteen became "Governor" <sup>1</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>("City" and "governor" are pronounced the same way in Chinese..)</dfn>

    <p>That was right; as her ID suggested, Dark Governor Lady Thirteen was female. The rumor was that her family ran a financial group and possessed unimaginable wealth, and had deep ties to Huaguo Water Curtain Group.</p>

    <p>For Lady Thirteen, a hundred thousand was nothing more than a small red packet that she didn't have to think twice about - it wasn't worth mentioning at all.</p>

    <p>"It's over..." Lin Gang said dejectedly.</p>

    <p>Father Chen's body turned limp at that moment, and feeling a little twitchy, he felt around in his pocket before taking out a cigarette box.</p>

    <p>Dark Governor Lady Thirteen had taken sides, and she stood with Zhu Ge... It could be said that they basically didn't have any hope of winning this battle...</p>
