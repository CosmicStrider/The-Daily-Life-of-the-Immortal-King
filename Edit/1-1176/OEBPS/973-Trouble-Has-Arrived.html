  <h1>Chapter 973 Trouble Has Arrived</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Guo Ping had come just when it was time for dinner. Although he had come uninvited, he was after all a prominent figure right now. Furthermore, Wang Ling never knew that Guo Ping had contributed to the research on his talisman upgrade.</p>

    <p>If one had to know, even President Qi, who was like a father to Wang Ming, had been kept in the dark about the talisman seal.</p>

    <p>Mother Wang was a little overwhelmed. "Teacher Guo has come today for..."</p>

    <p>"It's nothing; my nephew is Wang Ling's classmate and has received a lot of care from Wang Ling. I dropped by today to look for Wang Ling and a bite, if possible," said Guo Ping.</p>

    <p>"..." Mother Wang was taken aback when she heard this. This Teacher Guo was unexpectedly acting overly familiar with them.</p>

    <p>But the Wang family was as hospitable as always, and naturally wouldn't turn away someone who had already come, so Mother Wang could only invite him to stay for dinner. Old Man Wang had invented a new dish, and when he saw that the celebrity who had been all over TV in the last few days had dropped by the villa, his face brightened happily. "Teacher Guo came at the right time; you must try my new dish tonight."</p>

    <p>"I heard that grandfather is good at cooking; I will definitely make myself at home," said Guo Ping politely.</p>

    <p>"Teacher Guo, you flatter me. My new dish tonight is an iced red bayberry pastry. After removing the ice bayberry flesh, I turned it into a pulp to use as filling in dough balls, which I then rolled into dough twists and deep fried at a high temperature to produce this bayberry pastry. It's full of flavor and leaves a rich aftertaste." As soon as his new dish was brought up, the old man couldn't stop chattering.</p>

    <p>"Grandfather, you're so impressive." Guo Ping was blank as he listened, and he laughed. "Also, you don't have to call me Teacher Guo; Little Guo is fine."</p>

    <p>"Very well, Little Guo. Since you're here for Ling Ling, I'll call him down," said Mother Wang.</p>

    <p>"Don't trouble yourself, auntie, I'll do it," said Guo Ping.</p>

    <p>On the second floor, Wang Ling heard the conversation downstairs and sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p>It was only halfway through his tranquil summer break, but now this bug had shown up.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was also puzzled by Guo Ping's appearance, since Wang Ming had never even so much as hinted at Guo Ping's involvement before. After all, creating the talisman seal was an important thing.</p>

    <p>Just now, Wang Ling had already texted Wang Ming to ask about it, but the latter had yet to reply.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling suddenly missed the dumbass who would usually reply in seconds.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't know what Guo Ping was like, but through this encounter, he felt that Guo Ping was really overly familiar with him and didn't think of himself as an outsider at all.</p>

    <p>Guo Ping made his way up to the second floor with confidence, as if he had investigated beforehand and knew exactly where Wang Ling's bedroom was.</p>

    <p>When he passed by Father Wang's study, he even stepped more lightly - he obviously knew of Father Wang's identity. Looking at this, Wang Ming had indeed told Guo Ping a lot about them.</p>

    <p>Arriving at the door to Wang Ling's bedroom, Guo Ping knocked on it, but there wasn't any response at all. Then, just as he turned the doorknob, a human face suddenly appeared on the bedroom door.</p>

    <p>After the last few times Mother Wang had barged into Wang Ling's bedroom without knocking, Wang Ling had already enlightened the door.</p>

    <p>This new member of the enlightened party was the door guardian, whose full name was Nagato.</p>

    <p>"Our master is not receiving guests today." The door guardian was very straightforward. "If you insist on intruding, I'll have to use the Shinra Tensei <sup>1</sup> on you."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(From the series "Naruto," the
name of the character Nagato
in Chinese literally translates
to 'long door .. ')</dfn>

    <p>"Your door is quite interesting." Guo Ping laughed. Although the door suddenly speaking had given him a scare, he very quickly calmed down.</p>

    <p>He was well aware of Wang Ling's secret, and thus wasn't too surprised by the various oddities in the Wang family's small villa.</p>

    <p>He knew Wang Ling was avoiding him on purpose, most likely because Wang Ming hadn't told Wang Ling about this beforehand.</p>

    <p>These two days, the research institute had been busy receiving aliens and analyzing their cultures. With the incorporation of some methods furnished by these cultures, the institute had made unexpected breakthroughs in a lot of their research which had yet to see results before this.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming had thus been using his brain very heavily in the last two days. Guo Ping thought that the reason why Wang Ling wouldn't meet him was probably because Wang Ming had yet to wake up.</p>

    <p>After he overused his brain, Wang Ming would fall into a very deep coma, which was often accompanied by a very high fever which at its highest could be 70 or 80 degrees... An ordinary person's brain would have long been fried.</p>

    <p>So to prevent this from happening, Wang Ming installed a cooling system in his brain.</p>

    <p>Hence, while Wang Ming's temperature seemed very high on the surface, the temperature inside his skull was actually normal.</p>

    <p>Seeing that he couldn't enter, Guo Ping was a little anxious. Since he couldn't get hold of Wang Ming, he could only call Zhai Yin. "Hello? Little Yin? Has Lao Gudong Ming woken up?"</p>

    <p>"Not yet." On the other end of the phone, Zhai Yin replied, "His stress reaction this time was more serious; it might take another day or so to cool down."</p>

    <p>"Another day? It's already been several days, right? He hasn't mentioned the fact that I would be dropping by the Wang family's small villa, and his little brother won't let me in..."</p>

    <p>"Did you bring any crispy noodle snacks with you?"</p>

    <p>"No."</p>

    <p>"Then I'm afraid you won't be able to get in today."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"How about this: I'll explain the situation to them later since I also know of it, and I'm more familiar with his little brother than you are."</p>

    <p>"Alright, I'll have to trouble Little Yinzi. Are you cooking? I can hear something frying?"</p>

    <p>"I'm frying steak," said Zhai Yin.</p>

    <p>"Aren't gas stoves forbidden inside the institute..." Guo Ping had a suspicion look in his eyes ¬_¬` since Zhai Yin's fried dragon pork had almost killed President Qi.</p>

    <p>Since that day, the research institute had banned the use of all equipment which could be used for cooking such as simple gas stoves, induction cookers, microwave ovens and so on. Even those magic treasures which could generate heat and light fires were contained under President Qi's orders. Apart from designated staff, no one was allowed to borrow any, especially not Zhai Yin...</p>

    <p>Theirs was an institute of science and technology, not of biological weapons...</p>

    <p>The lethality of Zhai Yin's dragon pork could even be said to be deeply imbued with Mother Juan's flavor; as for exactly what it was like to eat it, only President Qi knew...</p>

    <p>Although Guo Ping hadn't been back long, he was already well acquainted with Zhai Yin and her cooking.</p>

    <p>At present, there were ten laboratory levels in the research institute. The higher the level, the stricter the safety and isolation protocols in order to prevent chemical spills and unusual gases from leaking while research was being carried out.</p>

    <p>And as tests had shown, a level ten lab couldn't guard against Zhai Yin's dragon pork... It had to be level eleven at least.</p>

    <p>"Old Qi won't let me cook, and I've been itching to do so for a long time. Don't worry, I'm not using a gas stove or induction cooker. I just thought that since Wang Ming's fever is pretty high this time, it would be a waste not to use it."</p>

    <p>"You're frying a steak on a person's head?" Guo Ping was horrified.</p>

    <p>"It's already medium rare; you can try it when you get back. Do you want some black pepper on it?" answered Zhai Yin.</p>
