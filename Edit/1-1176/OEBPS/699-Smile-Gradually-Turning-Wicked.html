  <h1>Chapter 699 Smile Gradually Turning "Wicked"</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This feeling of being observed in secret instantly caused the head of state to be on full alert right away, and Father Wang noticed that the head's expression didn't look right.</p>

    <p>"Someone's at the entrance." The head bookmarked what he had been reading and then stood up to look out the window.</p>

    <p>He had been interrupted while reading very cheerfully, which made him a little unhappy.</p>

    <p>"Is it the people from the foundation?" Father Wang remembered hearing what sounded like a car drive by earlier. The Wang family's small villa was located on East Huang Road in the outskirts and it was usually very desolate, so they would clearly hear any car that drove by.</p>

    <p>"I don't know for now, but I want to meet this person." The head of state frowned.</p>

    <p>Even if they were from the foundation, who would drop in and do a probe like this?</p>

    <p>"Then..." Father Wang opened his mouth and subconsciously felt like the head of state was about to sort something out once again.</p>

    <p>The head stared at him seriously. "Brother Situ, you sit there and don't move. While I go sort this out, you can do more writing."</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the entrance, General Yi frowned deeply after his probe.</p>

    <p>This was because he had felt his spiritual senses dispelled. It was obvious that the expert inside the villa had sensed his probing and then stopped his prying. It was clear that this was a supremely powerful expert.</p>

    <p>General Yi carefully surveyed the villa's location. As far as he knew, this stretch of road was quite remote and had ordinary fengshui.</p>

    <p>Why would such an expert choose to live in seclusion in such a remote place?</p>

    <p>Nothing made sense.</p>

    <p>For now, there were a few things General Yi felt that he had to figure out.</p>

    <p>One, this mysterious expert's connection to Zhuo Yi of the General Administration of 100 Schools as well as to Secretary Sun Dakang.</p>

    <p>Two, this mysterious expert's identity and strength.</p>

    <p>Three, this mysterious expert's true objective.</p>

    <p>Considering that more and more foreign forces were becoming more active recently, General Yi even started to wonder if this mysterious expert was a foreigner.</p>

    <p>And the one thing that General Yi had always dreaded the most, and had been surreptitiously on high alert against, was collusion between higher-ups in Huaxiu Alliance and foreign forces.</p>

    <p>But he now finally had some clues!</p>

    <p>There's a mole... stop the deal<sup>1</sup>!</p>

    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A line from the Hong Kong film "Infernal Affairs" that has become iconic.)</dfn>
    
    <p>So, the day when he could shout out this catchphrase himself had come?</p>

    <p>At that moment, General Yi recalled that classic story.</p>

    <p>Foreign forces had without a doubt dispatched spies to Huaxiu nation, and had even already bribed quite a number of mid-tier cadre into becoming informants. Over the years, General Yi had gathered plenty of evidence, and most of the high officials in various regions who had been sacked during this time were linked to this. But the ranks of these leaders were too low, which wasn't good enough! Thus, General Yi had been wondering all these years what he could do, given his retired status, to hook a big fish.</p>

    <p>It was very obvious that the mysterious expert inside this villa was a big fish!</p>

    <p>While General Yi was feeling excited, he suddenly saw the scene in front of him change.</p>

    <p>After a few seconds, he appeared in a blistering hot landscape and was surrounded by volcanoes which could erupt at any moment! The ground burned with red-hot flames and there were actually nine suns in the sky!</p>

    <p>"It's genuinely hot... Is this an intrinsic spirit field?"</p>

    <p>He narrowed his eyes as he hovered in the air, his training clothes also floating on the waves of heat.</p>

    <p>To be able to instantly produce an intrinsic spirit field was ample proof of how powerful the person in the villa was. The most critical thing was that this person had dragged General Yi into the field but was not here himself... There were very few people in the world who were capable of separating themselves from their intrinsic spirit field.</p>

    <p>It seemed that this was a very tough enemy.</p>

    <p>General Yi calmly analyzed the situation; even if he hadn't been cautious in acting first and had put himself in an unfavorable position, he still showed no signs of fluster.</p>

    <p>He stretched out his hand. A soft golden ring of light instantly appeared around his right hand, and General Yi pulled a freezing cold, azure-colored ice sword out of it.</p>

    <p>The instant this ice sword was drawn out, the initially boiling hot ground was in a flash covered in a layer of frost which radiated out from General Yi and gradually spread over the surroundings.</p>

    <p>Not only that, even his outfit changed.</p>

    <p>In the blink of an eye, the training clothes which General Yi had been wearing was covered in magical ice armor, and he looked like an ancient knight.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, inside the Wang family's small villa, the head of state used a projection spell to project a view of the intrinsic spirit field in the study.</p>

    <p>"Hehe, it's been several centuries, but this boy hasn't made any progress." The head smiled slightly, then turned to Father Wang to explain, "Brother Situ, do you see that golden ring of light? That's his infinite sword repository, which contains his collection of tens of thousands of magic swords."</p>

    <p>Father Wang opened his eyes wide; this battle scene was just like watching a blockbuster!</p>

    <p>"This infinite sword repository can automatically pick out the most suitable magic sword for Little Yiyi to use, based on his situation. In addition, each sword is part of a holy armor set, and so comes with armor exclusive to it," said the head of state.</p>

    <p>Previously, Father Wang had actually considered asking Wang Ling to fight and thus help provide material as reference for his novel. But he was deeply worried that Wang Ling wouldn't be able to control his strength and would muck up while playing around... also, getting Wang Ling to participate in a fight was itself very risky, so all this time, Father Wang had basically collected material for his novel's fight scenes from TV dramas.</p>

    <p>But a drawback of this was that films in the end were mostly fictional, and certainly couldn't create the true shock of personal experience!</p>

    <p>Looking at this scene in that moment, Father Wang unexpectedly felt like a lightbulb had instantly lit up in his mind.</p>

    <p>This was an obvious sign that he had been hit with inspiration!</p>

    <p>The head of state had seen this before!</p>

    <p>But most of the time, Father Wang would only be hit with this burst of inspiration after smoking a cigar.</p>

    <p>This was why the head of state sent him cigars every month. But it seemed that these cigars alone had already stopped working in the past few months, and Father Wang had been searching for a new way to help him gain inspiration. Previously, he had been fond of thinking while on the toilet, but gave it up after he developed hemorrhoids from spending too much time on it...</p>

    <p>Now, the head of state's eyes immediately lit up at this scene. "Brother Situ, you have inspiration now?"</p>

    <p>"Yes!" Father Wang nodded his head solemnly. "Following the part that Your Excellency is now reading, it just so happens that there's a fight scene, and I've been pondering how to write it... If possible, I hope to be able to obtain more material on the art of battle."</p>

    <p>"Very well! Leave it to me!"</p>

    <p>The head of state nodded.</p>

    <p>He just wanted to see a fight scene, right?</p>

    <p>Too easy...</p>

    <p>The head of state stared at Little Yiyi trapped in the intrinsic spirit field, his smile gradually turning "wicked<sup>2</sup>."</p>
