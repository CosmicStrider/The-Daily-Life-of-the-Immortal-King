  <h1>Chapter 1169 The Strength of Wang Ling's Waist</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The moment Wang Ling confronted Gao Tianming, he had already thought up more than three thousand ways to perfectly get rid of the other party. But Gao Tianming wasn't evil; it was just that the power of Shadow Dao had amplified the dark thoughts in his heart to such a boundless extent that there was no going back for him now.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had no intention of killing Gao Tianming; he just wanted to take back the power of Shadow Dao. As long as Wang Ling could retrieve the power smoothly, the darkness in Gao Tianming would fade away.</p>

    <p>This was the best solution Wang Ling had come up with, before things got worse.</p>

    <p>Gao Tianming had tried to be smart by sealing off the entire battlefield, when he was in fact doing Wang Ling a favor; without anyone to disturb them, Wang Ling didn't have to worry about using his power.</p>

    <p>He took a step forward. It was just one step, but the greatest of pressure, like a waterfall that was ten thousand li in height, instantly fell on Gao Tianming's head and made it hard to breathe.</p>

    <p>"You..." Gao Tianming stared at Wang Ling with profound shock all over his face. He had thought that this would be a good show of him using the power of Shadow Dao to catch a turtle in a jar - never had he thought that the turtle would be him!</p>

    <p>This wasn't the power of a Foundation Establishment cultivator!</p>

    <p>"You and me, are we the same sort of people?" Gao Tianming looked at the red dead fish eyes in front of him and tried to confirm it from the expression in Wang Ling's blooming King's Eye, but couldn't get an answer.</p>

    <p>The same sort of people?</p>

    <p>Of course not...</p>

    <p>Although Gao Tianming had merged well with the power of Shadow Dao, it wasn't even a trillionth of Wang Nuan's strength.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had already deciphered Shadow Dao, and while he wasn't very proficient in it, he had nevertheless crossed the threshold of understanding.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling now had four Great Dao buffs.</p>

    <p>The main Great Dao: Heavenly Dao! Wang Ling had been born with it.</p>

    <p>Divine Dao: Wang Ling had learned it on Divine Dao Star after two long minutes of study.</p>

    <p>Fate Dao: Wang Ling had instantly comprehended it in the prison after Bai Youquan was caught.</p>

    <p>Shadow Dao: Wang Ling had been especially diligent in researching it in order to destroy those frozen dumplings and also for his little sister Wang Nuan's sake.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling currently grasped these four Great Dao.</p>

    <p>In fact, there was also a type of Dao which could make him invincible and immune to all types of magical attacks, which was "Outer Dao."</p>

    <p>Strictly speaking, however, it couldn't be classified as a Great Dao, and was only a branch of Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>Back then, Bai Youquan's father, President Bai Zhe, thought that he had mastered a Great Dao, but the power of Outer Dao fell far short of Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>In short, compared with Wang Ling's Shadow Dao, Gao Tianming's Shadow Dao couldn't be called a phoenix feather and dragon horn<sup>1</sup> - it was just a chicken feather from a baby chick.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Something that is very rare.)</dfn>

    <p>It was a pity that Gao Tianming, as one party in this fight, clearly didn't know what true strength was.</p>

    <p>It was like Nan Yixiu said.</p>

    <p>Gao Tianming was crazy.</p>

    <p>If Wang Ling didn't show Gao Tianming the real gap between strengths and make him despair and give up for real, this guy would definitely continue on the wrong path.</p>

    <p>"The world only needs one genius, and that's me!" With a hysterical wave of his hands, Gao Tianming manipulated two puppets into flanking Wang Ling in a pincer attack in the next moment. These "Butcher" puppets were more lethal and faster than Ripper, who had dealt with Wang Zhen earlier.</p>

    <p>Thanks to a more flexible gear design, the hooked, golden rings around the Butcher puppets' waists started to spin rapidly as they approached Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling could tell that Gao Tianming planned to kill him.</p>

    <p>Boosted by the power of Shadow Dao, the rings around the two Butchers' waists could spin over one hundred million and three thousand times a second. It was powerful enough to cut gold and stone! It could even split mountains!</p>

    <p>But this speed still couldn't compare with when Wang Ling did the hula hoop at seven years old; back when he was far less powerful, his hula hoop could already reach a speed close to two hundred million rotations per second.</p>

    <p>He even outright defied gravity and took off like a helicopter as he flew away from Earth for the first time...</p>

    <p>But there was a saying: A real man didn't boast about his past achievements. This was a childhood trick which Wang Ling didn't think was worth showing off to outsiders.</p>

    <p>But it was precisely because of his hula hoop experiences back then... (Because he frequently broke them, Wang Ling eventually cultivated the skill of doing hula hoops with air.)</p>

    <p>Now, without a physical hula hoop, Wang Ling's speed when he shook his waist at just ten percent of his strength could break one billion times per second!</p>

    <p>So when Gao Tianming manipulated the Butcher puppets into lunging at him, Wang Ling subconsciously started to shake his slim waist at a high speed; he was so fast that Gao Tianming actually saw Wang Ling turn blurry and indistinct.</p>

    <p>As Wang Ling's waist shook like the high speed guichu videos on Bilibili, the whole of Mist Peak's summit started to sway slightly.</p>

    <p>There could only be one outcome for the two Butchers after colliding with Wang Ling's waist shaking at one billion times per second, and that was to crash and burn.</p>

    <p>The Butcher puppets were sent flying from Wang Ling, and they broke up into spare parts. Gao Tianming couldn't believe his eyes.</p>

    <p>A gear the size of a palm fell and rolled over to his feet...</p>

    <p>When he bent down to pick it up, he was instantly burnt by how searingly hot it was.</p>

    <p>He hadn't been able to clearly see what Wang Ling had done, and his Butchers had actually fallen apart, just like that!</p>

    <p>"What on earth did you do?! Wang Ling!" Gao Tianming roared furiously. It was very loud and intimidating, like a mental patient howling hysterically at other people.</p>

    <p>But in Wang Ling's eyes, this was just empty rage.</p>

    <p>"Physical attacks are useless on me." These were the first words Wang Ling said since the fight started, and could be considered a friendly warning.</p>

    <p>Shaking his waist at one billion times per second was something that Wang Ling only remembered after looking at the Butcher puppets; it was a silly skill that he had invented back then, which looked especially stupid when he shook his waist at a low speed.</p>

    <p>But when he sped up, no one could see what he was doing at all.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, he had long cultivated a Sage Body. Even if he didn't shake his waist, the Butchers would still be courting disaster when they crashed into him.</p>

    <p>"I'm going to turn you into part of my collection!" Gao Tianming's eyes were red as he stared at Wang Ling. He didn't know why Wang Ling, as a Foundation Establishment cultivator, had the same power as he did, but he now planned to turn Wang Ling into his puppet.</p>

    <p>"Become my puppet, Classmate Wang Ling!" Gao Tianming laughed coldly and snapped his fingers. His shadow gradually rose up from the ground to hover behind him!</p>

    <p>This was Gao Tianming's Shadow Image â€” a clown on strings, which gave off an evil aura!</p>
