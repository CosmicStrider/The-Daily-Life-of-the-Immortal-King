  <h1>Chapter 852 The Mysterious Visitor From the Domain Of the Gods</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Any regular person could see that Li Hao and his father were foreigners. Bluntly speaking, the reason why Li Hao was so blatantly picking on Huaxiu's local cultivation education system was essentially because of the foreign blood that flowed through his veins. His mother was from Huaxiu and his father Li Diao from Lixiu. From the moment he was born, Li Hao was well-known in Lixiu nation for being a fusion of the Lixiu local vampire and a cultivator.</p>

    <p>A cultivation vampire basically had a natural advantage over ordinary cultivators when it came to cultivation, and were classed as a special community in <em>An Introduction to International Cultivation </em>. In fact, according to the International Cultivation Convention, special cultivation communities had to be regulated by local authorities; you had to prove you were harmless before you could have the same rights as an ordinary person.</p>

    <p>So the fact that Li Diao and Li Hao were still alive... proved that these two actually weren't bad at heart - maybe they were simply braindead and asking to be beaten up.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling thought about these two cultivation vampires working hard in Lixiu nation as they fought for the same rights and benefits as an ordinary person... he wondered how many grandmothers they had to help cross the street in exchange for their current freedom!</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, those vampires who truly couldn't control the desire for blood were supervised by Lixiu and could only live in the dark.</p>

    <p>At that thought, Wang Ling, who was sitting in the lounge, thought that Li Hao and his father were actually very similar to the keyboard warriors on the Internet...</p>

    <p>Their online and real life appearances were completely different.</p>

    <p>Lixiu had always strictly supervised vampires. When this father and son pair arrived in Huaxiu, it was as if they were completely liberated.</p>

    <p>Cultivation vampires were a type of opponent Wang Ling had never encountered and he had no idea what it would be like in an actual fight... But for Wang Ling, this type of fight couldn't even be called a fight at all; this was just fooling around.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling even felt that walking Er Ha was a little more tiring than a fight of this scale - the point was that it couldn't help him burn any calories at all!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>There were two matches before his showdown with Li Hao and his father. Although the students had already been divided into teams, the order of battle was determined by drawing lots. Of the two battles before this, one was Liu Qingyi and Wang Zhen against two students from Elite Class Two, and the other also featured Elite Class Two students, whose opponents were Nan Su, a student from Reliance High School, and an expert whom Wang Ling had inadvertently noticed: Gu Shunzhi...</p>

    <p>First, Liu Qingyi and Wang Zhen.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's attitude toward these two had changed a little in the past two days.</p>

    <p>Because last night, Liu Qingyi and Wang Zhen had together bought a truckload of crispy noodle snacks. Furthermore, they were all limited editions that were hard to come by.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling's requirement for Liu Qingyi and Wang Zhen now was that they could fight with words.</p>

    <p>However, they absolutely couldn't be admitted into Grade One, Class Three, because that would seriously affect Wang Ling keeping his grades down. As long as they didn't enter Grade One, Class Three, everything else was fine. If they did, he would deal with them...</p>

    <p>This was the text Wang Ling sent to Liu Qingyi and Wang Zhen last night.</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi and Wang Zhen shuddered when they read it. They didn't dare disbelieve it, because Wang Ling really had that type of strength.</p>

    <p>And for the battle this time, Wang Ling had noticed another expert: Gu Shunzhi...</p>

    <p>This person had hidden himself so deeply that even Liu Qingyi and Wang Zhen hadn't noticed.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling was sure that this person was far from simple, because he also had the aura of the Domain of the Gods on him.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling repeated the name in his heart.</p>

    <p>He had heard Wang Zhen say before that the aristocratic family currently ranked first on Nine-fold Star Domain of the Gods was the Gu family.</p>

    <p>But was there an additional connection between this Gu Shunzhi and the Gu family?</p>

    <p>Reasonably speaking, if Gu Shunzhi was from the Gu family, then Wang Zhen should have already detected him early on... Although Wang Zhen's strength was still restricted by Heavenly Dao at the moment, he still regarded the Gu family as his sworn enemy, so he should be extremely sensitive to members of the Gu family.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen, however, didn't have any reaction at all, which was also the strangest thing about it.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, Wang Ling had noticed Gu Shunzhi.</p>

    <p>But this was by no means the right time to alert the other party...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling could only pretend that he hadn't noticed anything.</p>

    <p>Moreover, this Gu Shunzhi was very strange. He seemed to have some sort of magic treasure on him which prevented Wang Ling from reading his mind, so Wang Ling didn't know if the other party was targeting Wang Zhen, Liu Qingyi... or directly targeting him.</p>

    <p>Before finding out what the other party's true objective was, it was best for Wang Ling to pretend that he didn't know anything, since this meant that he could ultimately swindle several crispy noodle snack packets out of Gu Shunzhi.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi and Wang Zhen formed one team to fight elite students from Class Two, and predictably, the battle ended quickly. However, they pulled their punches so that the Class Two students didn't look too bad, even sacrificing their bodies to let the Class Two students get some hits in. It could be said that the two Class Two elite students lost very gracefully.</p>

    <p>The only problem was that after leaving the field, the two students felt their hands hurt...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling also paid special attention to Gu Shunzhi's team. This Gu Shunzhi had extremely powerful body movements and physical combat skills; cultivators also called the latter: body techniques.</p>

    <p>Without using any special spells at all, or even a magic treasure, he defeated the students from Class Two. Compared with Liu Qingyi and Wang Zhen, who had pulled their punches, Gu Shunzhi was relentless in his movements. Throughout the whole battle, everyone saw his image flicker all over the field, and the Class Two students collapsed before they could react.</p>

    <p>The whole audience cried out!</p>

    <p>The Number 60 High teachers who were watching the battle each flipped through Gu Shunzhi's profile.</p>

    <p>"Which school is this Gu Shunzhi from? So strong?"</p>

    <p>"Garleton Cultivation School." Lao Gudong pushed up his glasses and said, "This is also a cultivation high school in Songhai, but it's ranked at the bottom and is weaker than Number 60 High overall. This Student Gu Shunzhi is also originally a transfer student at Garleton Cultivation School; he transferred there three months ago."</p>

    <p>"This is a rare good seed!" the teachers marveled.</p>

    <p>"This Student Gu Shunzhi seems proficient in body techniques. Except for Grade One, Class Three's Chen Chao, our Number 60 High basically doesn't have any students good at body techniques. If we can take him in, it'll greatly benefit this year's students in the training and development of their body techniques. Even I have never seen the body techniques he used, and his body movements are exceptional; they remind me of a legendary body movement prodigy..."</p>

    <p>"Do you mean Breaking Desire?" Lao Gudong asked.</p>

    <p>"That's right, that person." The teacher nodded.</p>

    <p>"But no one can learn Breaking Desire's abilities... In order to stimulate his adrenaline to the fullest when performing his body movements, he castrated himself..." Lao Gudong tsked.</p>

    <p>Listening to the teachers' conversation, Wang Ling felt himself ache a little down below.</p>
