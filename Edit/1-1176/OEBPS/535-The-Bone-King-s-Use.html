  <h1>Chapter 535 The Bone King's Use </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Xiao Yin was very serious when he said this and Er Ha sensed that this wasn't a joke at all - putting all the aforementioned points together, it seemed that this Bone King was a complete match to Dog Saint.</p>

    <p>Actually, this explained why that Crying Old Immortal's Fenrir liked this bone so much. It was a western devil beast, but in the end it was still a dog... It would be strange if it didn't get excited over a bone from Dog Saint.</p>

    <p>Er Ha thus didn't doubt Xiao Yin's words at all. After all, when Dog Saint was eaten, Xiao Yin had been hiding in the Holy Dog clan's depository of Buddhist texts. On one hand, he had watched as Dog Saint was turned into a spicy hot pot, and on behalf of all dog lovers, had strongly condemned and protested this act in his heart. On the other hand, he had also been drooling...</p>

    <p>After the tragic extinction of holy beasts, there had already stopped being news on them for a very long time. Over the years, plenty of cultivators traveling the world had picked up quite a number of bone fragments suspected to belong to holy beasts, but these were stored away in museums.</p>

    <p>As for why such a large Bone King had escaped this fate, Er Ha thought that it was probably due to all kinds of coincidences.</p>

    <p>Er Ha guessed that the Bone King had the smell of spicy hot pot on it to begin with, which masked the scent of holy beast blood, so when Crying Old Immortal found it, he hadn't realized that it was the bone of a holy beast. In order to get rid of the smell of hot pot, he had washed the entire bone.</p>

    <p>Then, after Crying Old Immortal brought the Bone King home, Fenrir had claimed it for its own for a long time. Covered in Fenrir's scent, the Bone King unexpectedly escaped notice... If Wei Zhi hadn't given it to Er Ha, the world would have completely overlooked this bone from Dog Saint.</p>

    <p>For a moment, Er Ha stared at the bone, lost in deep thought.</p>

    <p>Was all of this fate?</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin and Er Ha stared at the snow white Bone King in front of them and didn't talk for a long while.</p>

    <p>The atmosphere felt heavy to Er Ha.</p>

    <p>But it was understandable, since it had been a long time since there had been any news on holy beasts. Now, after much difficulty, they had uncovered President Bai, the primary suspect in the previous massacre of the holy beasts. However, he was too cunning, and so far they had been unable to track down his whereabouts.</p>

    <p>Er Ha thought that Xiao Yin was definitely hurting right now.</p>

    <p>While there were many types of holy beasts, the Holy Dog clan and the Silver Unicorn clan had actually had a very good relationship, otherwise Xiao Yin wouldn't have been able to go through the works in the Dog clan's depository of Buddhist texts.</p>

    <p>Thus, when Er Ha saw Xiao Yin stare at this bone lost in thought, a disappointed and frustrated expression on his face, it couldn't help reaching out to pat his shoulder. "The dead are gone, there's no use crying over them."</p>

    <p>It didn't know how to console him.</p>

    <p>After all, it was a dog of forgiveness, not a dog of comfort!</p>

    <p>"You don't need to console me; I'm not that sad, and it already happened a long time ago..." Xiao Yin folded his arms as he said, "My biggest wish now is to first cultivate well with Master, and secondly, to catch that rumor-monger President Bai as soon as possible in the name of justice for our holy beast race."</p>

    <p>"Mm!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha felt that Xiao Yin's words were very ambitious. "But why do I feel like you're still very sad?"</p>

    <p>Eyes fixed on the dog bone, Xiao Yin curled his lip. "How am I sad... I was just reflecting on a very profound question!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "What's that?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "I was thinking... when that bunch of people back then had turned Dog Saint into a spicy hot pot, what kind of seasoning did they use that the spicy smell can still linger after so long..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At night, Lord Diulei warmly invited Er Ha to stay for dinner as Xiao Yin had directly chosen to forego it since he had started dieting recently. Logically speaking, Er Ha thought that this guy was just begging to be hated: he didn't get fat no matter how much he ate, yet he still made noise about wanting to lose weight - then what about actual fatties? Did they not need face?</p>

    <p>When it was time for dinner, Lord Diulei was busy in the kitchen. Er Ha hadn't thought that the man could actually cook... who knew he could be a good housewife?</p>

    <p>Leaning back against the sofa, Xiao Yin fiddled with his phone as he read some news or other, and Er Ha couldn't help turning its head to ask, "How good is Senior Immortal at cooking?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin hummed. "He's not bad... and it's healthy. You'll know when you taste it."</p>

    <p>After he said this, Xiao Yin suddenly sniffed. "I haven't asked you, what are you going to do with Dog Saint's bone? This thing actually doesn't have any effect as a tonic, whether for human cultivators, spirit beasts or holy beasts... But I'm not sure whether it has any effect on dogs."</p>

    <p>"What do you suggest?" asked Er Ha.</p>

    <p>"My suggestion..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin said, "I suggest that you use it as raw material and look for a qualified weaponsmith to make a weapon suitable for you. Dog Saint's bone is in good condition, and if you can really make a magic weapon out of it, I believe it'll be pretty good. At the very least, you can use it to intimidate all the dog-type spirit beasts."</p>

    <p>"Alright!" Er Ha nodded its head and felt that Xiao Yin's suggestion was quite practical.</p>

    <p>Moreover, it was indeed lacking a support magic weapon at the moment. The Toad clan's most prized treasure was the "Primordial Oil Ball," which was a first-class holy weapon which only clan leaders could use. Ever since becoming a dog, Er Ha had had nothing to do with this magic treasure.</p>

    <p>But given its current body, the Primordial Oil Ball actually wouldn't be suited for its use anyway.</p>

    <p>Er Ha might have to take part in all kinds of battle in the future, so it needed a magic treasure to protect itself.</p>

    <p>In the end, it would still need to ask little master for help, but Er Ha thought that this matter might ultimately be entrusted to Luo Chuang. That was because next week would be the busiest time: while there were only a few midterm exams left, Wang Ling still had to take part in the district sports meet! Apart from the relay, he had also signed up for the medicine ball and the battle of soul pets events as Teacher Ye had strongly requested.</p>

    <p>All in all, Wang Ling would be very busy next week.</p>

    <p>The most critical thing was that Er Ha didn't have much time left before the event forecasted in its dream happened.</p>

    <p>It had done a rough calculation.</p>

    <p>It just so happened that next week was when it would be returning to its clan...</p>

    <p>It could be said that everything had piled up at the same time!</p>

    <p>Er Ha had the faint sense of all of this being a pain in the ass.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Let's eat!" At that moment, Lord Diulei came out of the kitchen with a dish in each hand. This was tonight's healthy feast which Xiao Yin had talked about. "Broccoli egg drop soup, stir-fried broccoli, fermented broccoli, broccoli tempura, stewed chicken with broccoli... and there's actually one more dish, diced broccoli! Lord Diulei cut the broccoli up for soup!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha was stupefied when it looked at this soup. "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "This is like Romance of the Western Chamber<sup>1</sup>!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Presumably a reference to a particular scene in the film of the same name, which we know nothing about, sorry ..)</dfn>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>
