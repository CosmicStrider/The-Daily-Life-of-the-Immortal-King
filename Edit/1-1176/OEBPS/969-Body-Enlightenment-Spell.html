  <h1>Chapter 969 Body Enlightenment Spell</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"En- enlightened..." Father Chen was stupefied by this master's statement. In all his years, it was the first time he had heard that a human body could be enlightened...</p>

    <p>"I don't usually give people this sort of whole body enlightenment service, but this kid's situation is unusual. Saving a life is better than building a seven-storied pagoda. As for the cost, there's no need to pay." The master smiled and said, "When the child is fully recovered, I hope you'll bring your family here to the monastery and join me in seclusion for half a month."</p>

    <p>Father Chen touched Chen Chao's forehead. Although Chen Chao still looked very weak, his fever was indeed gone.</p>

    <p>Master Jin Deng's "Body Enlightenment Spell" just now had indeed dispelled the curse.</p>

    <p>Father Chen's expression was full of reverence. "What is honorable master's name?"</p>

    <p>"This old monk's Buddhist name is Jin Deng."</p>

    <p>Master Jin Deng said in a clear voice, "The reason I asked you to join me in seclusion isn't because I want you to work for me, but because I have a feeling that in the next fifteen days, the wicked character behind this will attack you again. My monastery is a little shabby, but it can protect you against evil and turn ill luck into good."</p>

    <p>"Many thanks, master!"</p>

    <p>Father Chen nodded solemnly.</p>

    <p>This incident was too insidious.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao, who had always been in good health, suddenly caught a cold, and the hospital couldn't discover what was wrong with his body. In the end, it was revealed that he had been cursed... If it hadn't been for Dr Liu and Master Jin Deng, Chen Chao might have fallen ill and died from this curse this time.</p>

    <p>Father Chen couldn't help the cold sweat that burst out on his forehead at this thought.</p>

    <p>Liang Heng...</p>

    <p>Apart from his endlessly scheming and competitive senior brother, Father Chen truly couldn't think of anyone else he knew who would do such an evil thing.</p>

    <p>Father Chen never thought that Liang Heng wouldn't cherish even a bit of their brotherhood ties.</p>

    <p>"The matter of seclusion cannot be delayed. The best would be if you're able to come tomorrow."</p>

    <p>These were Master Jin Deng's last words to Father Chen before the latter left.</p>

    <p>"Thank you, master. After I've organized everything, I'll come over tomorrow." Father Chen nodded.</p>

    <p>His next job was to persuade Mother Chen.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, Father Chen was also very worried about Xiaoling's mom, so he persuaded her and Xiaoling to go with them to the monastery for seclusion. To Father Chen's surprise, he actually succeeded. This was because Father Chen was originally an atheist who had never prayed to Buddha for help before. Now, he suddenly planned to go into seclusion. Moreover, his attitude was so grave and serious... Mother Chen and Xiaoling's mom were instantly alarmed.</p>

    <p>"Master Jin Deng..."</p>

    <p>Before she retired to be a housewife, Mother Chen used to do the census.</p>

    <p>She repeated the name and pondered over it, somehow feeling that this Buddhist master's Buddhist name sounded familiar.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the first day of seclusion, Father Chen brought Chen Chao, Mother Chen, Xiaoling's mom and Xiaoling to that slightly time-worn monastery. The martial arts dojo was temporarily closed, with Father Chen notifying the students beforehand and telling all of them that he was going on a trip. In order to avoid losing students during this period, he gave each of them two extra free classes.</p>

    <p>Actually shutting their business for half a month would have a pretty big impact on the Chen family's income.</p>

    <p>But health was more important.</p>

    <p>Even if they knew that the person who had cast the curse was Liang Heng, they didn't know how he was doing it or how to ward against it. Fortunately, they had Master Jin Deng to guide them.</p>

    <p>"Benefactors, this house is for you. I hope you can cultivate your mind and live a happy life for the next half a month." A young monk led them to a square courtyard house inside the monastery. Father Chen saw that it wasn't just them, but other people had also come for seclusion.</p>

    <p>"Thank you very much, little master."</p>

    <p>Father Chen made a Buddhist salute. "Oh, by the way, where is master?"</p>

    <p>"Shifu is teaching people about Buddhism in the main hall. This is part of his regular 'Today's Teaching' session. If you're interested, you can sit in." The young monk smiled.</p>

    <p>Today's Teaching...</p>

    <p>For some reason, Father Chen thought the name sounded a little familiar<sup>1</sup>.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Possibly a take on the title for the Chinese program 'Legal Report.')</dfn>

    <p>It was Master Jin Deng who was responsible for arranging all the classes during seclusion. Since he was teaching at the moment, it naturally wouldn't be good for Father Chen and the others to disturb him, so Father Chen took everyone to the main hall to sit in on the lesson.</p>

    <p>There were also a lot of people there.</p>

    <p>They found mats on the side and sat down to listen with great interest.</p>

    <p>Father Chen later learned that people regularly came to Master Jin Deng's monastery for seclusion. During this period, you could stay as long as you wanted as long as you paid for water, electricity and accommodation. Besides, accommodation was very cheap.</p>

    <p>This Jin Deng Buddhist Temple had many devotees. From this point, it could be seen that this Master Jin Deng was indeed a man of ability.</p>

    <p>Every day, there were a lot of people who attended the "Today's Teaching" session, and there were also a lot of questions asked.</p>

    <p>Some of them were disciples in seclusion inside the temple, who would come and ask questions whenever they had doubts, and some came from far and wide seeking guidance. All types of questions were asked...</p>

    <p>A monkey coder with a bald head asked, "Master Jin Deng! The day before yesterday, two options suddenly popped up on my computer screen, asking me to install a patch or choose to skip... I don't know what to do..."</p>

    <p>"Is it a security software prompt?" Master Jin Deng smiled faintly.</p>

    <p>"Master has such foresight! It's a 360 Total Security pop-up... Master, please tell me what I should do..."</p>

    <p>"Benefactor, you're thinking too much. In fact, you have a third option: uninstall 360 Total Security."</p>

    <p>"Master... is wise!"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The second question came from a married woman who was in seclusion at the temple. Father Chen heard that she had been waiting in line for a long time to ask a question, and only today was it her turn.</p>

    <p>Finally, it was her turn to ask a question, and her eyes were full of tears. "Master... My son is insistent on debuting as an idol. What should I do?"</p>

    <p>"An idol? Most children nowadays have this notion; little do they know how deep the waters are, and they can't wade in so casually." Master Jin Deng sighed.</p>

    <p>"Master is right! But my son won't listen..." The woman was helpless.</p>

    <p>"How about this, I'll write you a poem and you can put it on your son's headboard."</p>

    <p>The woman asked, "What sort of poem?"</p>

    <p>Taking out a golden sheet of paper, Master Jin Deng recited as he wrote, "An idol, hair parted down the middle, he gets dizzy from fancy dribbling; smokey eye makeup and hand cream, he panics when he plays basketball; suspenders and platform shoes, pants tied with a bow at the waist; he can sing, he can dance, is he male or female<sup>2</sup>... Done, this is the poem."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(A description of Chinese idol Cai Xukun whose appointment as a Chinese NBA ambassador was criticized ..)</dfn>

    <p>The woman: "Master... you're so powerful..."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "Master is amazing..."</p>

    <p>"You flatter me."</p>

    <p>Master Jin Deng chuckled. "I summarized the current situation of male idols nowadays. I imagine your son is still quite young, and this is the age when he should be studying. If he is diligent and studies hard, he will certainly be successful in the future. One should be down-to-earth at all times."</p>
