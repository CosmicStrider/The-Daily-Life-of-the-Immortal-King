  <h1>Chapter 439 Lord Diulei's Death? </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It would take less than fifteen minutes at top speed to reach the Wang family's small villa in a straight line.</p>

    <p>But now, it was impossible for Lord Diulei to take this type of direct route. Considering Evil Sword God's brutal nature, he didn't want to get innocent passersby involved. Thus, he took the long way round and steered his Bright Victory sword through sparsely populated areas.</p>

    <p>But in doing so, he would only reach the Wang family's small villa in forty minutes.</p>

    <p>Whether he lived or died today would depend on this forty minutes.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Lord Diulei only hoped that he wouldn't be pulled up by the traffic police; he was already over the speed limit given how fast he was flying. Being waylaid by the police and getting demerits, a fine or his driving license revoked were all small things, but if Evil Sword God interfered, more innocent people would suffer.</p>

    <p>From beginning to end, Evil Sword God didn't make a move. The demonic purple light in his eyes started to glow. This was a technique he called "Looking at the Horizon with One Eye," which was also a move in the Purple Investigative Demon Eye<sup>1</sup> style.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is adapted from the Purple Extreme Demon Eye, with the Chinese words for 'investigate' and 'extreme' being homonyms, 'ji.' The Purple Extreme Demon Eye is a technique used by Tang San, the protagonist of the xuanhuan novel "Douluo Dalu..")</dfn>

    <p>Back then, after killing his shifu with his own hands, his second stop had been the Tang Sect, which had had a good relationship with his shifu. He had found Tang Shijiu, the master disciple of the nineteenth generation of the Tang Sect at the time, and had plucked out his Purple Investigative Demon Eyes before fixing them in his own eye sockets as if he was changing cosmetic contact lenses.</p>

    <p>With this pair of magic eyes and this "Looking at the Horizon with One Eye" pupil technique, he could see very far away.</p>

    <p>"Headed where there aren't a lot of people? Good idea. Unfortunately, it's useless." Evil Sword God sneered in his heart. Standing in place and with one hand behind his back, he slashed at the air with his other hand.</p>

    <p>"Interesting fellow. But in my eyes, you're still just a mongrel cultivator."</p>

    <p>Opening the space fissure, he calculated Lord Diulei's escape route and then stepped into the gap before disappearing.</p>

    <p>Speeding through the air, Lord Diulei instantly felt nervous. He thought he had already fled far enough, but the pressure which Evil Sword God had been exerting all along had yet to disappear.</p>

    <p>It was as if a pair of eyes were boring into his back.</p>

    <p>He had to hold on! Until he got to Brother Ling!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei gritted his teeth, turned around, and threw out a number of black grenades in succession as he recited a spell: "Skybomb Grenade, Enhanced Version!" In a flash, there was the sound of explosions, and in a split second, the sky was filled with smog for thousands of miles around!</p>

    <p>Boom boom boom...</p>

    <p>The enhanced version of the Skybomb Grenade was deafening, and the dense smog it created wasn't an ordinary one at all as it could blind people momentarily!</p>

    <p>When Evil Sword God passed through the void, tore open the space fissure, and walked out, he immediately found himself wrapped in smog.</p>

    <p>"Skybomb Grenade?" Evil Sword God hmphed coldly. He didn't make any large movements, and his Purple Investigative Demon Eyes started to spin again as he roared furiously, "Junior! You think this mere blinding smog can stop me?"</p>

    <p>"Can stop me..."</p>

    <p>"Stop me..."</p>

    <p>"Me..."</p>

    <p>The next moment, two beams of light shot out of his Purple Investigative Demon Eyes like magic dragons and pierced straight through this smog!</p>

    <p>Hu Hu! Two sounds! The magic dragons released from the Purple Investigative Demon Eyes surged through and dispelled the thousands of miles of smog.</p>

    <p>When Lord Diulei saw this scene, he was shocked. His Skybomb Grenade was an ancestral secret weapon. Back then, his ancestor's godfather had been a descendant of the Tang Sect who had specifically made improvements to the Skybomb Grenade! An ordinary Skybomb Grenade was more than enough to fight against a Perfected Being, and the enhanced version now could delay even a True Immortal on the hunt. At the very least, it should slow one down for a while and buy some time!</p>

    <p>He had already used the remaining four enhanced Skybomb Grenades he was carrying!</p>

    <p>However, Evil Sword God had actually been able to handle the situation so easily, directly overlooking the vast dense smog.</p>

    <p>Combined with this troublesome power of Sword Dao, Lord Diulei judged that Evil Sword God's overall battle strength had already surpassed True Immortal level! It was very likely already infinitely close to Venerated Immortal level!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was sweating copiously as he fled.</p>

    <p>He sighed in his heart and felt a touch of despair.</p>

    <p>Was this the despair that stemmed from an extremely inauspicious divination?</p>

    <p>Indeed, since ancient times, it seemed that he had never heard of anyone who had received an extremely inauspicious prediction ever escaping it smoothly.</p>

    <p>The young man in white stopped fleeing and looked in the direction of the Wang family's small villa.</p>

    <p>He still had fully half a way to go to the Wang family's small villa... It was already too late for him to run!</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God had already caught up to him from behind. Pointing his sword at Lord Diulei, he couldn't help sneering. "Mongrel cultivator! Giving up already?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei turned around in the air, his body trembling uncontrollably. The gap between their realms was really too big! No one would be able to bear it!</p>

    <p>The only reason he was able to stand in the air without toppling over was completely due to the long johns.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, he didn't have the wherewithal to speak with Evil Sword God on an equal footing. But even if it was someone else with the same realm, they might not even be able to straighten their legs under such powerful spiritual pressure.</p>

    <p>"Junior has long heard of Lord Evil Sword God's power; today, junior humbly concedes defeat!" Lord Diulei said, fists clenched.</p>

    <p>"Little junior! It's no use trying to buy time. No one I've wanted to kill has ever escaped me." Evil Sword God pointed the sword at him as demonic overbearing sword qi swirled in the air. "Mongrel cultivator! Let me ask you, what manner of thing is that armor you're wearing inside? If you tell me the truth, I'll give you a slightly happier death!"</p>

    <p>"There is a person called Wang Ling," Lord Diulei answered. "He was the one who made the armor I'm wearing, and he's not far away; if Senior Evil Sword God is willing to call for him out loud, he will definitely hear you..."</p>

    <p>Things had already come to this point, and Lord Diulei knew that he couldn't escape, but he still had one last ray of hope. "Why don't you call for him?"</p>

    <p>"???"</p>

    <p>After staring blankly for a moment, Evil Sword God couldn't help guffawing. "In the end you really are just a mongrel cultivator, actually selling your friend out so easily... rest assured, I will definitely call for him!"</p>

    <p>He could tell that Lord Diulei wasn't lying. The Purple Investigative Demon Eyes could detect subtle changes in the expression on a person's face, so if the other party was lying, he would be able to tell immediately.</p>

    <p>He pointed the sword at Lord Diulei. "Rest assured! After I kill you, your friend will accompany you very soon in hell!"</p>

    <p>With that, Evil Sword God raised his hand, and as the Heaven-Cleaving sword flew from it, the space around the sword cracked inch by inch!</p>

    <p>It was all over...</p>

    <p>In the final moments of his life, Lord Diulei felt very calm in his mind.</p>

    <p>In the fierce light of the sword, he saw an illusion.</p>

    <p>If felt like he saw Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>Utterly incapable of withstanding the attack, he couldn't even see the shadow of the Heaven-Cleaving sword...</p>

    <p>The next moment, the Heaven-Cleaving sword had pierced him, and the power of Sword Dao exploded in his body, turning it into bloody mist...</p>

    <p>"Tch! In in the end you're just a mongrel cultivator! You couldn't even withstand a single blow!"</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God sneered and stretched out his hand to call that Brilliant Victory sword to him. When it was in his grasp, he used the Thousand-Li Telepathy Technique to howl, "Wang Ling! Where is mongrel cultivator Wang Ling?! Mongrel cultivator Wang Ling! Come out and face death!"</p>

    <p>"Come out and face death..."</p>

    <p>"Out and face death..."</p>

    <p>"And face death..."</p>

    <p>But at this point, the echo was abruptly cut off!</p>

    <p>Because in the next moment, Evil Sword God saw a teenager that at some point had appeared and who was now standing opposite him.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, without saying anything, this teenager made one move, and instantly appeared right in front of Evil Sword God.</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God finally broke out in a cold sweat... because he realized that his Purple Investigative Demon Eyes had been completely unable to catch his movements!</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God stared at him. "So you are mongrel..."</p>

    <p>Before he could finish, Wang Ling aimed a slap at him.</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God sneered. "Hmph! A petty trick!"</p>

    <p>He stretched out his arm to ward it off.</p>

    <p>However...</p>

    <p>The next moment, there was the loud sound of arm bones breaking.</p>

    <p>The slap landed with pinpoint accuracy on Evil Sword God's face.</p>

    <p>He gave a miserable shriek as he felt unimaginable pain in his face. Blood sprayed from his nose, his teeth were sent flying, and his eyes were as wide as they could go with extreme fear...</p>

    <p>He directly turned into a meteor as Wang Ling smacked him down to earth from ten thousand meters up in the air!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's slap didn't make any sense whatsoever... </p>
