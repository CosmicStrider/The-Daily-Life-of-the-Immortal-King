  <h1>Chapter 1035 The Hostage Situation at Magic Treasure Development University</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Actually, it wasn't as difficult to meet Wang Ling as some might imagine... Those familiar with him knew that as long as you made sure to prepare crispy noodle snacks beforehand, you could even video chat with your beloved Ling Zhenren! Of course, he wouldn't say a word during the video chat, and would stare at you with those cute, round dead fish eyes of his, firmly capturing your heart.</p>

    <p>To look into a person's heart, there were a lot of times when you just needed to look into their eyes. The eyes were the window to the soul, and even Wang Ling was no different. Actually, his eyes were a little special because of the King's Eye, and his pupils could appear red. But there were plenty of cases in the cultivation world of eyes changing color as a result of cultivating different Foundation Establishment kungfu, so eye color wasn't considered a problem.</p>

    <p>Of course, there were those who deliberately wore contacts to change their eye color; it was just that this wasn't allowed in school.</p>

    <p>There was a huge difference between natural eye color and color contacts; after years of experience, the teachers who carried out checks at the school entrance could tell which was which with one glance.</p>

    <p>Secretly taking a deep breath, Xiao Yin straightened out his thoughts before discussing the next part of their cooperation with this Miss Lin. He thought that her proposal was reasonable, but in order not to annoy Little Master Ling, Xiao Yin put forward another requirement: he hoped that Lin Shiyao would just observe Wang Ling from afar and not get too close.</p>

    <p>Lin Shiyao had no objections to this.</p>

    <p>She was truly only curious to know what the person with this beautiful handwriting looked like, and never planned to talk to him. She had been in a relationship once before, but after the breakup, she completely gave up on love and didn't think she would fall for someone ever again.</p>

    <p>To Lin Shiyao, being in a relationship was simply torture.</p>

    <p>She could recite a hundred different benefits of staying single: freedom, no restrictions, no need to routinely fake affection daily, and being able to live true to herself, more than anyone else.</p>

    <p>How great was that?</p>

    <p>And so they officially came to an agreement just like that.</p>

    <p>"So it's a deal."</p>

    <p>Lin Shiyao started to take deep breaths to hide her happiness and anticipation. She had several of her assistants behind her open up a new round of orders online, and Xiao Yin and Er Ha heard them start to bustle around as the Taobao app on their phones started to beep non-stop.</p>

    <p>Where there was demand, there was a market...</p>

    <p>Ghostwriting homework was a job that had emerged in keeping with the times, like the recent trend of trash sorting; Er Ha believed that it wouldn't be long before some company introduced a door-to-door trash sorting service: it wouldn't just be disposing trash, the trash sorters could be called out at any time like the food delivery boys...</p>

    <p>Er Ha didn't expect Lin Shiyao's business to actually be so good; it wasn't an exaggeration to describe the scene as "the clamor of drums and gongs filling the air, firecrackers bursting with loud bangs, red flags fluttering in the sky, and a sea of people" - in this situation, they would absolutely be able to collect all the fragments of the Jade Scroll of School History before the start of school!</p>

    <p>But right at that moment, there was suddenly a deafening "bang" outside the canteen, and a number of students rushed inside with panicked expressions, some of whom were even screaming.</p>

    <p>"What's going on?" Lin Shiyao got up and grabbed a flustered boy to ask.</p>

    <p>"Sis Lin... it seems like there was an explosion at the auditorium!"</p>

    <p>"An explosion? From what?"</p>

    <p>"I don't know, either..." The boy was also bewildered. "I went out to collect my express delivery when I heard an explosion coming from the auditorium."</p>

    <p>"Was anyone hurt?"</p>

    <p>"I don't know... But I remember that a teacher has an open lecture in the auditorium at this time, and there are about fifty students inside."</p>

    <p>"All of you stay here; I'll go take a look," Lin Shiyao instructed the people behind her. She then turned and made for the auditorium. Lin Shiyao was also the president of the student union at Magic Treasure Development University, and she couldn't turn a blind eye when something like this happened; at the very least, she had to figure out the cause of the explosion.</p>

    <p>This incident also caught Xiao Yin and Er Ha's attention. After discussion, one Silver and one dog hurried out with Lin Shiyao. Magic Treasure Development University hadn't been very peaceful recently because of that serial killer who had yet to be brought to justice.</p>

    <p>Was it possible that this explosion had something to do with the murderer?</p>

    <p>As they approached the auditorium, they saw that a group of university teachers had already rushed over at the news, while some gutsy students were being pests nearby. Teachers wielding all kinds of magic treasures prevented the students from getting closer and broke up the crowd, while some of them were already preparing to go in and rescue people.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin examined the auditorium's location. It had been built in one corner of the campus. Flanked by tall walls, a high-pressure barrier over it prevented outsiders from climbing over the walls to get in. The auditorium had two exits, but both of them had collapsed after the explosion and were completely blocked by the broken bricks and tiles that had fallen.</p>

    <p>Seeing this, Xiao Yin already sensed that something wasn't right â€” this was clearly a premeditated explosion.</p>

    <p>If it was an accident, it was impossible that both exits would just so happen to be blocked after the explosion.</p>

    <p>And it was at that very moment when an unfamiliar voice rang out from inside the auditorium. "Teachers, remain calm - put down your magic weapons and step back, otherwise I won't be able to guarantee the safety of the teacher and fifty students inside the auditorium."</p>

    <p>The cold, utterly emotionless voice sounded in the air; it was a warning issued from the broadcast room inside the auditorium to the people outside.</p>

    <p>"Who are you?" a teacher asked.</p>

    <p>"You seem to have been looking for me for a very long time, and you've used all sorts of ways to prevent me from harming other students. But in fact, I've run out of patience. I think those dead students died too easily; I should have tortured them to death... And so, it's in fact because of your Magic Treasure Development University's non-compliance that I'm hijacking this place today."</p>

    <p>When the man said this, sweat covered the backs of all the teachers and students - this was the serial killer!</p>

    <p>"Tell us what you want! Please don't hurt the kids inside!" At that moment, a middle-aged man with his hair swept back and who was a little out of shape stepped forward: he was the principal of Magic Treasure Development University, Zhou Dongye. Xiao Yin had previously seen some of the information which Gao Tian had on the police station's investigation into Magic Treasure Development University, and he recognized this man at first glance.</p>

    <p>"This voice - is that Principal Zhou Dongye's voice?" The man inside laughed coldly. "I didn't want to do this, but the truth is that if I don't blow up this matter here, you won't pay any attention to it at all. Do all of you still remember the kid, Zheng Jingxuan?"</p>

    <p>When the man said this, the faces of Zhou Dongye and all the teachers present turned dark. Xiao Yin turned his head and saw that Lin Shiyao had already clenched her small fists, which trembled slightly.</p>
