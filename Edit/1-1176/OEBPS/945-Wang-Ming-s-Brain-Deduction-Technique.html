  <h1>Chapter 945 Wang Ming's Brain Deduction Technique</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"I have a book called <em>Rongzhai Six Strokes </em>..."</p>

    <p>It was obvious that the distress signal which the mechanical octopus sent before its death was a secret code. After Zhuo Yi received Wang Ling's message, Wang Ming deciphered it in less than a minute.</p>

    <p>"So soon?"</p>

    <p>"It's a code phrase from the indie game <em>The Invisible Guardian </em>; you can find it after a major data search." On the other end of the phone, Wang Ming replied, "The correct answer to the secret code is: <em>Rongzhai Six Strokes </em>only has five strokes."</p>

    <p>"I see. As expected of Lao Gudong Ming!" Zhuo Yi nodded.</p>

    <p>"What are you going to do next?" Wang Ming knew Zhuo Yi was the commander-in-chief of this operation to clean up the Internet.</p>

    <p>The enemy they were dealing with this time were aliens from the Brain King clan on Brain King Star. Wang Ming had found out the mechanical octopus's origins after taking its core apart.</p>

    <p>According to the cosmic database which Divine Dao Star had shared with them, the level of science and technology on Brain King Star was quite advanced, and they were close to entering an era of machine automation.</p>

    <p>Babies born on Brain King Star had their brains removed and implanted into machines as bodies, greatly increasing their lifespan. The Brain King clan didn't need to worry about getting sick at all. Even if their mechanical joints wore out, any component could be instantly replaced until they no longer wanted to live.</p>

    <p>Those who decided to die would then donate their brains to Brain King and allow the latter to absorb them, which was a pain-free process.</p>

    <p>Of course, whether it was truly painless or not was something that only the Brain King clan knew.</p>

    <p>This was just cosmic intelligence shared by Divine Dao Star, and much of it was from verbal accounts of local inhabitants from various other planets. The information was mixed, and they had to distinguish between what was true and what was fake themselves.</p>

    <p>"Lao Gudong Ming, what do you think the Brain King clan's purpose is for coming to Earth this time? It looks like they're looking for someone..." Zhuo Yi was a little worried.</p>

    <p>"Brain King, the head of the Brain King clan, can absorb brains to increase its own longevity and wisdom. I'm afraid that they're here on Earth this time to look for people with very high IQs..."</p>

    <p>"High IQs? Wouldn't they be targeting places like research institutes? Isn't Lao Gudong Ming in danger?"</p>

    <p>"Mm..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming nodded noncommittally. He thought up a number of scenarios, and after some calculation, came up with the most likely answer. "They're taking great pains to develop a water army on Earth, not just to make money, but more so to search for people through this huge water army network until they find the smartest people to present to Brain King.</p>

    <p>"But it seems there was something wrong with the plan when it was set up at first, and they went in the wrong direction... They set up the water army and Group Leader Detention Island, likely because they wanted to find the smartest people among these group leaders. It seems that these Brain King aliens naively thought that these kings of talking big were real kings."</p>

    <p>"..." Zhuo Yi was utterly stupefied.</p>

    <p>There - there was even this kind of operation?</p>

    <p>"One more thing, Lao Gudong Ming..." Zhuo Yi suddenly said.</p>

    <p>"Go ahead."</p>

    <p>"Previously, a thief called Kong Ruye broke into my place; he's a well-known repeat offender of the Dark Network."</p>

    <p>"Mm, I heard about that. What did you find?"</p>

    <p>"According to the current investigation, this Kong Ruye was also sent by the Governor, but at that time, he only wanted my hair. It's likely that they wanted it to test my DNA, but unfortunately, they didn't succeed."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was lost in thought at Zhuo Yi's words.</p>

    <p>"Wait a bit," Wang Ming said.</p>

    <p>He then sat down and the Brain Deduction Technique started working again at that moment. Countless possible scenarios flowed through his mind, and he began to deduce them.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ming was calculating the various possibilities in the spiritual world, it seemed to take a very long time. It felt as if a very long day or two had passed, but in fact, it was only a short three minutes.</p>

    <p>In just three minutes, Wang Ming calculated thousands of possible outcomes and ranked them in descending order of probability.</p>

    <p>When he was done, his head was wet with sweat.</p>

    <p>He had overexerted himself. He had employed his brain earlier to deduce the Brain King clan's purpose for coming to Earth. Now, after a second deduction, it actually felt like his brain wasn't getting enough oxygen.</p>

    <p>"Lao Gudong Ming, Lao Gudong Ming?" On the phone, Zhuo Yi was a little concerned when he didn't hear Wang Ming's voice after a long while.</p>

    <p>"He's fine. It's just that his sugar levels are a little low now after doing the deduction. He'll call you back later." Zhai Yin answered on Wang Ming's behalf, then hung up.</p>

    <p>"How are you?"</p>

    <p>She was so close that Wang Ming could smell her scent.</p>

    <p>After giving Wang Ming a sugar pill that had been prepared beforehand, Zhai Yin helped Wang Ming to the bedroom on base to lie down and get some rest.</p>

    <p>A sugar pill was a must for Wang Ming after he used the Brain Deduction Technique. This technique took a lot out of him and was harmful to the brain. The sugar pill could promptly replenish nutrients and help decrease the damage.</p>

    <p>During the incident with the Shuigou Sect last time, Wang Ming used this technique to handle several assassins one after another in order to protect the students. He overexerted himself so much that he had directly passed out.</p>

    <p>It was after that incident that Wang Ming really began to pay attention to the aftereffects of using the Brain Deduction Technique. However, sugar pills were only a temporary nutrient substitute, and couldn't support extended periods of exertion.</p>

    <p>The energy consumption increased proportionally with the use of the Brain Deduction Technique, each time using up more energy than the last.</p>

    <p>A mere sugar pill couldn't last him long.</p>

    <p>In addition, the sugar pill was made from fast-acting ingredients. After long-term consumption, his body would develop anti-sugar properties.</p>

    <p>Thus, he had to find a more perfect solution.</p>

    <p>"Don't use your ability so carelessly. If you go on like this, Old Qi will be angry again," Zhai Yin said in a worried tone.</p>

    <p>"Don't tell... Old Qi..."</p>

    <p>"I got it..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming sighed as if a weight had been lifted off him.</p>

    <p>He knew exactly what he was doing.</p>

    <p>He had to fix this issue of the aftereffects of the Brain Deduction Technique without delay.</p>

    <p>But he had too much on his plate at the moment.</p>

    <p>At this critical juncture when Earth was now establishing diplomatic relations with aliens, he had to handle the invasion of the Brain King clan properly.</p>

    <p>It had been necessary for him to do the deduction this time.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, while the aftereffects of the Brain Deduction Technique were heavy, it wasn't as if there weren't any gains.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming felt that he was getting more and more results with each deduction - this was crucial to his study of Wang Ling's primordial qi.</p>

    <p>After Wang Ling had drawn the talisman seal for himself when he was a child, Wang Ming had helped upgrade it several times. There were two problems which Wang Ming had yet to resolve with the next version upgrade.</p>

    <p>If he could increase his proficiency with the "Brain Deduction Technique," the results would be more reliable and he would be able to solve these two issues.</p>

    <p>Version 3.0 of the talisman seal...</p>

    <p>He had to hurry up and upgrade it before Wang Ling graduated from senior high.</p>
