  <h1>Chapter 611 The Secret of the Demon World's Holy Pillar</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Er Ha realized that things were starting to spiral out of its control; if it really made a move later, its identity would definitely be exposed!</p>

    <p>In its heart, Er Ha wanted to cry but had no tears to shed. If it had known earlier, it wouldn't have come up!</p>

    <p>Looking at Er Ha's complex expression, Zhenyuan already knew that this enemy would probably be very difficult to deal with. This was "Senior Dog," after all! How strong was the enemy, if they could make even Senior Dog frown? When Zhenyuan saw "Senior Dog" knit its eyebrows, he knew this wasn't a simple matter.</p>

    <p>"Can we investigate the space which this kun came from?" Zhenyuan looked at Shen Wuyue and asked. He knew that Shen Wuyue's power of perception was very strong, and surpassed that of ordinary human cultivators and even Demon Saint. It was also one of Shen Wuyue's strengths: he was skilled in perception and in making deductions and calculations.</p>

    <p>But it was clear that investigating this kun's origin was tricky even for Shen Wuyue, as he sighed, "I already started investigating after the multi-fanged kun was annihilated by the power of the Holy Pillar, but it'll take three to five days before we get any results. The search range is too wide, and I'm unable to pinpoint an accurate location with my sense of perception. The only thing I roughly know is that it's in a particular subdivision outside the Milky Way..."</p>

    <p>"I see..."</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan frowned with his chin in his hand. Even if they knew what subdivision it was in, that didn't mean very much... There were millions and millions of different planets in one subdivision outside the Milky Way; how long would their search take?</p>

    <p>Even though the range had been narrowed down, this was like looking for a needle in a haystack...</p>

    <p>The galaxy beyond the Milky Way was too big. Even if one gained the ability to walk outside the Milky Way at True Immortal level, there wasn't a single True Immortal who dared go too far.</p>

    <p>This was something everyone felt in their hearts.</p>

    <p>Back when Immortal Zhenyuan had roamed the galaxy beyond the Milky Way for a thousand years, he hadn't even explored a tenth of it. In conditions with a severe lack of natural spirit energy, a True Immortal would already find it unbearable after a few hundred years, let alone a thousand years. If you really wanted to court death in the galaxy outside the Milky Way, buying universal safety insurance wasn't any use! As long as your family didn't issue a death certificate, your remains would slowly turn to dust in the universe!</p>

    <p>In any case, Er Ha already felt that this wasn't something it could handle on its own, and that Little Master Ling would have to become involved.</p>

    <p>If they didn't take this matter seriously now, it could really lead to a huge calamity later.</p>

    <p>An "angler" who was most likely raising a large number of prehistoric vicious beasts that had already disappeared... although they currently didn't know the angler's real identity, whether he was a man or a demon or an alien from outside the Milky Way, it was very clear that the "angler" wouldn't be easy to deal with.</p>

    <p>This was because the prehistoric vicious beasts which he had all used primordial qi as their main energy source; this alone was enough to chew and spit out most of the cultivators in the human world.</p>

    <p>After all, Little Master Ling's slap back then had contained a little bit of primordial qi, and Evil Sword God had been thrashed so badly that even his own mother wouldn't have been able to recognize him.</p>

    <p>With these prehistoric vicious beasts all using "primordial qi" as their main energy source, one could well imagine how lethal they were.</p>

    <p>Second Generation Demon Saint and Shen Wuyue called these prehistoric vicious beasts "monsters," which Er Ha thought was quite apt.</p>

    <p>"Senior Dog, are you very certain?" Shen Wuyue asked, looking at Er Ha.</p>

    <p>Er Ha played the profound thinker as it nodded its head. "Yes." (As if...)</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "I'll think of a way to look for the angler, but I need to return and look up some information." (I need to ask Little Master Ling about this first...)</p>

    <p>"Then that's good."</p>

    <p>Second Generation Demon Saint and Shen Wuyue nodded.</p>

    <p>They had never seen "Senior Dog" casually perform grade thirteen spells like Immortal Zhenyuan had said, but since it was a great senior whom Immortal Zhenyuan recognized, the only thing Second Generation Demon Saint and Shen Wuyue could do now was believe in it.</p>

    <p>However, the matter wasn't over because they didn't know what the "angler's" objective was.</p>

    <p>Whether releasing this prehistoric vicious beast was part of a hunt or as a scout operation before an invasion, they didn't know a single thing.</p>

    <p>Faced with this unknown enemy, it was one thing not to act rashly, but protecting the people was also important. If this mysterious "angler" brought a large number of prehistoric vicious beasts with it in an invasion, both the demon world and the human world wouldn't be able to escape.</p>

    <p>When the time came, it would be an enormous catastrophe.</p>

    <p>So in this situation, Er Ha could only look for a reason to slip away first.</p>

    <p>Its line of thinking was very clear - it had to look for help from Little Master Ling.</p>

    <p>Blood was still gushing out of Shen Wuyue's head, but he was still very clear-headed.</p>

    <p>He took out two golden talismans from the lapel of his robe and gave them to Immortal Zhenyuan and Er Ha. "Senior Dog, Senior Immortal Zhenyuan, this is the golden talisman of my Demon Saint's Holy Palace. If there's anything you want to know, you can use Demon Saint's golden talisman to come here at any time. This golden talisman can also be used to communicate. If I uncover any clues here, I'll immediately inform both seniors."</p>

    <p>"So something like this exists." Immortal Zhenyuan took Demon Saint's golden talisman and assessed it curiously.</p>

    <p>He could sense that it contained the Holy Pillar's aura. "Was it made with the power of the Holy Pillar?"</p>

    <p>"That's right." Second Generation Demon Saint swiftly replied, "Furthermore, only Demon Saints can make this talisman. This Demon Saint's golden talisman is equivalent to an access pass to the demon world. Both seniors will be able to come whenever you want, and the transference site is Demon Saint's Holy Palace. With the golden talisman, however, you can visit any corner of the demon world that you want. To see the golden talisman is like seeing Demon Saint in person... All demon beasts, including demon kings and demon gods, must respect it, otherwise they will be punished by the restriction."</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, Second Generation Demon Saint sighed. "In fact, a long time ago, the original Demon Saint planned to mass produce this golden talisman and send a batch to the human cultivation world to establish diplomatic relations with every country's head of state. In fact, our demon world has always wanted to build a peaceful relationship with the human cultivation world. If we had done so earlier, we could have worked together after encountering a difficult situation like this today... But regrettably, that plan was later canceled."</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan: "Why was it canceled?"</p>

    <p>Second Generation Demon Saint: "Wasn't it because some goddamn person created the Gate Between Worlds which directly connected to the demon world?!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha and Zhenyuan: "..."</p>

    <p>Second Generation Demon Saint: "Not only did this Gate Between Worlds disrupt our original plan, it also damaged the spatial structure in our demon world... A few of our diplomats just wanted to go out and take a look, but in the end were beaten up so badly they came scurrying back!"</p>

    <p>Second Generation Demon Saint spoke with deep bitterness and hatred, and even Shen Wuyue's expression was grudging. "I scoured a lot of information all these years, but I could never discover who created the Gate Between Worlds... There are also rumors that it was Senior Immortal Zhenyuan who created the Gate Between Worlds..."</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan's lips twitched. "How... how could it be me... I'm so good and honest..."</p>

    <p>"That's right! How could it have been Senior Immortal Zhenyuan? Senior is so good and honest!"</p>

    <p>Shen Wuyue shrugged his shoulders. "But it doesn't matter anymore since I already laid a curse on the creator previously."</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan: "Cur... Curse?"</p>

    <p>Shen Wuyue: "I cursed him to be plagued by inner demons!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha and Zhenyuan: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After they ate at Demon Saint's Holy Palace, both Second Generation Demon Saint and Shen Wuyue sent Er Ha and Immortal Zhenyuan off outside the palace hall. Blood was still gushing out of Shen Wuyue's head, and as he moved, the two lolita servants holding the basins to catch the blood on the left and right moved with him...</p>

    <p>Before leaving, Er Ha couldn't help turning its head to ask, "Can I ask you something?"</p>

    <p>Second Generation Demon Saint: "Senior now has Demon Saint's golden talisman, which means you're an honored guest of my demon world. You can ask anything you want!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "How is the position of Demon Saint inherited?"</p>

    <p>This was what Er Ha wanted to know, and when Zhenyuan heard this, he also had a curious look on his face.</p>

    <p>Second Generation Demon Saint: "It was the original Demon Saint who determined the system of inheritance, and it's a little bizarre as it isn't based on strength or talent..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Then what is it based on?"</p>

    <p>Second Generation Demon Saint: "You just need to piss on the Holy Pillar..."</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan: "..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "???"</p>

    <p>It had almost become the third generation Demon Saint?!</p>
