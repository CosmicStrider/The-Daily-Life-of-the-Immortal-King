  <h1>Chapter 330 Ling Zhenren's Strength Is Called Into Question! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Just like that, this initially harmonious scene was shattered by this middle-aged baldie's heartwarming story about dog meat. Er Ha's face was sweating as it lay in the baldie's arms, afraid to move an inch. Sure enough, this was a clear threat, right?</p>

    <p>But when it came down to it, Killer Taoist's reputation as a great killer was evident both in the murder industry and the cultivation world. All of his assignments had to do with punishing the wicked and eradicating evil, and until now, he had never failed in any task. Thus, however horrifying the situation was, Er Ha didn't believe that this baldie would really raise a hand against it.</p>

    <p>Most importantly, Little Master Ling was still upstairs. There was a saying:<em>When you beat a dog, you must answer to its master <sup>1</sup> </em>... Wang Ling's existence was Er Ha's greatest security net.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is a Chinese proverb
which means that every action
has consequences ..)</dfn>

    <p>The baldie took in this scene; his story earlier was actually half true and half false. He had told this story with the aim of deliberately intimidating the dog. But in the end, this green dog's reaction was much calmer than he had expected. From this, he could actually tell that Ling Zhenren was really as strong as rumors said he was.</p>

    <p>If he had the opportunity to trade blows with him, it would definitely be very interesting.</p>

    <p>The baldie stroked Er Ha's dog fur again as he lost himself in daydreams.</p>

    <p>At this point, the door of the Wang family's small villa suddenly opened, and the light that poured out of the gap shone on the baldie's back in a long strip. The baldie turned his head to take a look, and saw a teenager in white bunny pajamas standing in front of him.</p>

    <p>"With respect, is your distinguished self... Ling Zhenren?"</p>

    <p>Before coming here, the baldie had fantasized a lot about what the legendary Ling Zhenren looked like. As the rumors said, he was very young. But when the baldie saw him with his own eyes, he was somehow still very alarmed — this was clearly just a child, right...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't say anything, and merely stared at the baldie and nodded.</p>

    <p>"Ey? Are you really Ling Zhenren?"</p>

    <p>The baldie revealed a flabbergasted expression at the youngster's admission.</p>

    <p>After a short silence, the baldie continued, "Can you fight me?"</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling couldn't believe it — was his prowess being questioned?</p>

    <p>The baldie cupped his fists in salute. "Junior has come looking for Ling Zhenren this time in relation to the Shuigou Sect which has been causing havoc recently. This is quite an important matter. If it's possible, I hope that the real Ling Zhenren can come out and meet me."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>The baldie stared at him. "Generally, before seeing a great senior, there's always someone to stop and challenge you first, right? I know the routine!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>The baldie then directly struck a pose in front of Wang Ling. "Then, little brother, please make your move!"</p>

    <p>Speechless, Wang Ling sighed in his heart. The baldie had misunderstood to this extent; if Wang Ling didn't accept his challenge, he might not be able to prove his identity to the other party. This was actually a major drawback of the Great Shielding Spell. After all, many people had only heard rumors about him; before they officially saw his face, his image in their minds would actually just be a bunch of mosaic tiles...</p>

    <p>Generally, in theory, close combat wasn't a killer's strong suit. But his opponent this time was Killer Taoist, after all, so Wang Ling's expression turned a little more serious.</p>

    <p>Er Ha was greatly surprised. From those dead fish eyes which had become fifteen percent larger than normal, it could tell that Wang Ling was serious! This was Wang Ling's normal serious mode — this was the first time Er Ha was seeing its little master display such an attitude.</p>

    <p>The two individuals went to the abandoned construction site on the other side of East Huang Road. The atmosphere seemed very tranquil as they faced each other, when in actual fact it was very tense.</p>

    <p>After learning to use the Internet, Er Ha had learned a fair bit online about the rumored Killer Taoist.</p>

    <p>Killer Taoist was famous for two supreme skills. The first was his Enemy-Killing Blink. When he went on missions, he would often behead the vicious people who were his targets with his blinking. The second skill was his finger gun. This supreme skill had made waves in the murder industry after Killer Taoist had used it many times on assignment. There was no one on the international ranking list of killers at the moment who was more powerful than Killer Taoist in using this skill. And until now, he had never missed his target!</p>

    <p>"Is this little brother ready? Since you're not making a move, I'll do it..."</p>

    <p>The baldie smiled. Seeing that Wang Ling was slow to take action, he couldn't resist the impulse to attack.</p>

    <p>The baldie raised his right hand, forming the shape of a pistol with his thumb and forefinger.</p>

    <p>Then, Wang Ling felt a huge amount of spirit energy molecules gather in a steady flow at the tip of the baldie's forefinger, forming a small, deep blue dot the size of a soybean which contained extremely dense spirit potential!</p>

    <p>The principle behind the finger gun was in fact similar to that of the old devil's famous Chaos Ball, but using it wasn't difficult. It was easy to learn and very easy to copy. However, it also had one large drawback, and that was that the spirit energy ball reached its saturation point very easily because of its small size.</p>

    <p>In other words, there was a limit to the power in the finger gun, and it depended entirely on the user's realm.</p>

    <p>Er Ha looked at the spirit energy ball on the tip of Killer Taoist's finger, and its small, round face was very calm.</p>

    <p>If it was only to this extent, its little master didn't even need to use the protective golden light; he would be able to completely defend against this attack by depending purely on his physical strength.</p>

    <p>But at that moment, Er Ha saw the baldie suddenly smile slightly, and he unfolded the rest of his fingers! Apart from his thumb, spirit energy balls started gathering around the tips of his four fingers at the same time!</p>

    <p>Four-Fingered Gun?!</p>

    <p>Er Ha's expression finally changed slightly at this scene. In a normal situation, it was already quite difficult to maintain the cohesion of a spirit energy ball on one fingertip. Controlling the gathering of spirit balls on the tips of four fingers at the same time was a high-end operation that an ordinary person would never be able to do!</p>

    <p>Er Ha was thus shaken by this scene. When all was said and done, this was a legendary killer...</p>

    <p>"Be careful, little brother!" The baldie stared at Wang Ling with a harmless smile on his face. "I haven't used this Four-Fingered Gatling Gun on anyone else before..."</p>

    <p>In the next moment, his four fingers sparked blue, and those infinitely powerful spirit energy balls shot out at Wang Ling in a fierce, earth-shattering attack!</p>

    <p>This was a highly focused machine gun attack, and those soybean-sized spirit energy balls wheeled like fireworks as they hurtled intensely at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised his eyebrows. The greatest benefit of this dense gunfire was that it made up for the lack of power in a single spirit energy ball. At the same time, however, it also had a large drawback, and that was that its speed was significantly slower than a single finger gun.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's dynamic vision was extremely powerful. When these spirit energy balls flew at him, it was as if their speed had slowed down several hundred times, so he could dodge them completely.</p>

    <p>Thus, there wasn't the slightest flinch on Wang Ling's face.</p>

    <p>But just then, the baldie smiled at him again. "You can't hide, little brother!"</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Ling heard what seemed to be a tiny electronic sound in the air: Super-targeting has been deployed <sup>2</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is a reference to an
incident where a live stream
gamer claimed he wasn't
using cheats, but the game
suddenly announced that
"super-targeting had been
deployed," thus exposing him
as a liar)</dfn>
