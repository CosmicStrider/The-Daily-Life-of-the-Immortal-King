  <h1>Chapter 411 If You Eat More Chicken, You Can Do it Too! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>This was a situation that even Wang Ling couldn't have anticipated. He had forgotten to gauge how much spirit power would be consumed when using the power of a magic treasure to manifest a soul in reality. It took a whole day to recharge the Soul Suppression Ring with spirit power, but each time Taoist Guang appeared, it was for less than three minutes, which was even shorter than Ultraman!</p>

    <p>There were two ways to solve this problem. One was to continue to expand the storage space for spirit power in the Soul Suppression Ring, and the other was to restrict Taoist Guang's consumption of spirit power. However, the problem was that both methods required Taoist Guang to cooperate with them on the other side in order to work.</p>

    <p>Right now, because Taoist Guang's soul space had been transferred to the Soul Suppression Ring, he was completely disconnected from the outside world until the next time the ring finished accumulating enough spirit power.</p>

    <p>"Senior Pang must be very worried; we have to think of a way to get in touch with him as soon as possible. But Brother Ling said something earlier about sending a computer inside; how are we going to do that?"</p>

    <p>While Lord Diulei had a limited understanding of soul spaces, he still knew the basics. The structure of a soul space was very complicated. The blueprint which Taoist Guang had given Er Ha previously had been put into the soul space at the very beginning; once it was taken out, it couldn't be sent back in again.</p>

    <p>"The Great Sacrifice Spell," Wang Ling said telepathically, once again revealing yet another one of the Three Thousand Great Spells that he had mastered.</p>

    <p>He seldom used this spell; it belonged to a slightly more neglected branch of the Three Thousand Great Spells. Its origin could be traced back to an ancient era when Almightys vied for supremacy. As they fought each other constantly, one day, someone finally discovered a way to use the sacrifice of living things to obtain power in a short period of time — this was the origin of the Great Sacrifice Spell.</p>

    <p>Of course, that was a darker period of time in history, but Wang Ling had now developed a new use for this spell.</p>

    <p>"Since Brother Ling has a way, that's fine."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei didn't ask detailed questions about the origin of this spell. Wang Ling had a lot of abilities that he had never heard of or seen before. The spells which each cultivator had was a relatively private matter to begin with, so no matter how close their relationship was, it would be impolite to ask rashly.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei then directly took out his phone and started tapping on the screen. "In that case, let's not waste time; I'll place an order first!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Place an order?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "To buy a computer, of course! We're not going to be sending Brother Ling's own computer inside, right?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "But can you be sure that Taoist Guang knows how to use it?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei paused. Indeed, Er Ha had pointed out the crux of the matter. Actually, when Taoist Guang had appeared just now and Lord Diulei had said that his "ability to adapt was very high" or whatever, it was all just polite talk. For many old-timers who had been in seclusion for a good long while and lagged behind modern society by several hundred years, learning to use modern technology was much more difficult than learning an advanced spell!</p>

    <p>Therefore, it was not enough to just buy a computer; Lord Diulei would still have to record a tutorial to teach Taoist Guang how to use it. At the very least, Taoist Guang would have to learn basic chat functions!</p>

    <p>After searching the online store for a long time, Lord Diulei thought that a desktop computer would be too complicated for Taoist Guang at this stage because it needed to be assembled together. Even if there was a manual, Taoist Guang wouldn't be able to comprehend it in a short period of time.</p>

    <p>In the end, he simply selected a "Crooked Alien <sup>1</sup> " smart notebook for the elderly.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Probably a riff on the 'Alienware' computer brand.)</dfn>

    <p>While the label for this "Crooked Alien" notebook said that it was for the elderly, Lord Diulei had always felt that it was for the lazy...</p>

    <p>This type of notebook was specially designed by businesses for senior cultivators who wanted to learn how to use computers. The notebook contained a built-in AI, so you just needed to directly open your mouth and ask whenever you wanted to learn a function; you didn't even need a mouse or keyboard! However, Lord Diulei still wanted to record a video tutorial to teach Taoist Guang how to turn the notebook on.</p>

    <p>If he couldn't turn it on, everything would be for nothing.</p>

    <p>As for the issue of a power source, there was nothing to worry about. A lot of household appliances in modern cultivation society ran on spirit power. This kind of smart notebook for the elderly also had built-in spirit power batteries.</p>

    <p>Even if the notebook wasn't turned off for an entire month, the amount of spirit power it would consume was still a lot less than what was needed for Taoist Guang to make one appearance.</p>

    <p>Mm, very good, so it was decided.</p>

    <p>— Place the order!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei clicked on the payment button and selected the express service. Shun Feng God Express would send it over within twenty minutes!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"It's done, it'll be here in twenty minutes." The young man in white put down his phone and heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>"How much is it?" Er Ha couldn't help asking.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei waved his hand and quickly replied, "It's not expensive. After conversion, it's six hundred thousand HNY."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei certainly didn't feel it was expensive; it was only that much! With the holy weapon-grade magic rings that Wang Ling had given him, one ring couldn't be purchased with anything less than over a million immortal gold bars! In contrast, this computer only cost six hundred thousand, and that was in Huaxiu currency... It was simply ridiculously cheap!</p>

    <p>"..." Er Ha tilted its head and sneaked a look at Wang Ling. It found Wang Ling lying bored on his bed, and guessed that he was waiting for the delivery. Although there wasn't any expression on Wang Ling's face, Er Ha was sure that Wang Ling had already converted this six hundred thousand HNY into crispy noodle snacks.</p>

    <p>Later, Lord Diulei really did personally appear on camera to record a video tutorial for Taoist Guang, but he was also worried that Taoist Guang might be the type who didn't know how to open the tutorial in video form.</p>

    <p>Hence, he went back to the old way of doing it, and in place of recording a video, used the traditional magic treasure, the "Shadow Remnant Stone." The Shadow Remnant Stones on the market now were already very small in size, and while they were very cheap to sell, there were still people who sold them.</p>

    <p>Since a long time ago, Lord Diulei had developed a habit of carrying a few of them around at all times in case of an emergency.</p>

    <p>Just as he finished recording the video with the Shadow Remnant Stone...</p>

    <p>Sure enough, the doorbell of the Wang family's small villa rang on time.</p>

    <p>A courier stood ramrod straight at the door, holding a box.</p>

    <p>While Wang Ling had been lying on the bed, this courier had in fact entered his range of perception very early on — this guy's aura had fallen from the sky!</p>

    <p>And when Lord Diulei went outside to receive the delivery, he did indeed see the discarded parachute behind the courier.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei looked at the sky; indeed, he seemed to have heard a plane just now...</p>

    <p>Considering the cost of manpower, most delivery companies employed couriers primarily at the Physical Build or Qi Condensation stages; the very, very highest stage they would employ at was the Foundation Establishment stage. There was no way they would ask cultivators at the Golden Core stage and above to do deliveries, as it would be beneath their abilities.</p>

    <p>But rain or shine everyday, these ordinary people would complete their assignments...</p>

    <p>What unwavering persistence!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was a little moved in his heart. To be a courier nowadays, you needed to learn to parachute; this was really too risky!</p>

    <p>Holding the box, the courier took the cap off a pen with his teeth. "Sir, your delivery. Please sign for it!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei swiftly signed his name and at the same time couldn't help praising, "Brother, that was a good jump! It was pretty accurate..."</p>

    <p>"You flatter me, sir. I practiced at the Internet cafe." The courier smiled slightly.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "???"</p>

    <p>The courier: "If you eat more chicken <sup>2</sup> , you can do it too!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>("Eat chicken" is now commonly used as a reference to the online game "PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds .. ")</dfn>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>
