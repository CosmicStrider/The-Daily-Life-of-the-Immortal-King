  <h1>Chapter 726 Cells At Work</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Bloody Butterfly's eyes were red with the pain from her twin ponytails being pulled. At this very moment, she felt like a rabbit that had been grabbed by the ears by a hunter.</p>

    <p>And the scariest thing was that this hunter still wanted to ruthlessly cut off her rabbit ears.</p>

    <p>These twin ponytails were one of the magic weapons she was most proud of, but now she actually had to say goodbye to them.</p>

    <p>Bloody Butterfly stared in despair at the Old Devil. At this moment, she felt that her entire life was gloomy. As a Red A-Class fugitive wanted by the state, what was she going to face next?</p>

    <p>Crystal tears glistened in the corners of Bloody Butterfly's eyes, but she didn't make a sound because under the influence of the Old Devil's depletion magic ring, she didn't even have the strength to cry.</p>

    <p>The only thing she could do now was wait to be slaughtered.</p>

    <p>"Don't cry. My venerable self... is most afraid of seeing women cry."</p>

    <p>Staring at the tearful Bloody Butterfly, the Old Devil had a complicated expression on his face.</p>

    <p>He suddenly remembered the moment he met his wife "Yamai" for the first time. Back then in class, he had pulled Yamai's hair and made her cry.</p>

    <p>Bloody Butterfly's tearful crying now unexpectedly gave the Old Devil the impression that he was seeing his wife.</p>

    <p>Bloody Butterfly thought that this would prick the Old Devil's conscience, and at the very least he would let go of her ponytails.</p>

    <p>However, the Old Devil's next words made her completely give up hope.</p>

    <p>The Old Devil took a deep breath, and said somewhat eagerly, "You look like my venerable self's wife when you cry... can I gouge out one of your eyes?"</p>

    <p>Bloody Butterfly was so frightened that her tears immediately dried up!</p>

    <p>She finally understood why this Old Devil had once been able to plunge the whole country into dark terror...</p>

    <p><em>Mom, I want to go home!</em></p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, Cheng Yu and Evil Sword God's pursuit was equally successful.</p>

    <p>They rode the military magic swords which General Bai had given them. Because they were all mass-produced military magic swords, they were all the same in terms of strength - even the sword spirits had been artificially placed inside the swords.</p>

    <p>These were assembly line products, and certainly couldn't match up to a custom-made magic sword. However, if their users were expert swordsmen, they could also be very powerful...</p>

    <p>Since they were both sword cultivators, the two of them were acutely familiar with flying a sword in a chase and attack.</p>

    <p>Moreover, General Bai had lifted the restriction on Evil Sword God's "Purple Investigative Demon Eyes" so that the latter could use it in the pursuit this time. There was thus no escape for these dozen or so foreign terrorists.</p>

    <p>After Cheng Yu and Evil Sword God undid their transfiguration spells, a loud cry had rung out inside the hearts of the foreign force and Dark Network mercenaries almost in unison: Why had these three big shots who had already been arrested joined hands now in this place?!</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God was relentless in his pursuit.</p>

    <p>General Bai had said initially that if the targets were caught alive, the reward was full points. During the pursuit, if these people fought back after being cornered, permission was given to execute them on the spot... But if they were dead, the points would be halved.</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God, however, didn't care about any of this. He activated his Purple Investigative Demon Eyes, and stepped forward to claim lives.</p>

    <p>In a temporarily opened underground space, twelve people joined hands to build a barrier.</p>

    <p>They combined to cast an earth-type spell called "Matrix of the Earth" to construct a solid space using soil as a foundation.</p>

    <p>"Why is it him..." This group of a dozen couldn't help sweating.</p>

    <p>They had scattered when they fled earlier, but because Evil Sword God had been hunting them all this time, more and more people slowly started to gather together to work out countermeasures.</p>

    <p>Roughly five minutes ago, Evil Sword God had already killed five people, and with his left hand, had used invisible sword qi to string their heads together like tanghulu <sup>1</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Sugar-coated haws on sticks.)</dfn>

    <p>Although they had completed the barrier, the enormous sense of oppression which Evil Sword God carried still made them feel as if they had been seized by the throat, even inside the barrier.</p>

    <p>But what these people didn't know was that this wasn't Evil Sword God at his peak. Although General Bai had allowed the Mahjong Squad to participate in the operation this time, he had still put restrictions on their overall battle strength. Currently, each person on the Mahjong Squad could only use less than sixty percent of their overall battle strength.</p>

    <p>But even then, this sense of drowning in killing intent still petrified people.</p>

    <p>Damn!</p>

    <p>They were clearly the invaders, but now they had to put up a barrier to protect themselves.</p>

    <p>"Evil Sword God has probably already been recruited," a man dressed in white said in a low voice as he looked upward with a profound expression.</p>

    <p>This person was also a member of the Dark Network as well as a Red A-Class wanted criminal like Bloody Butterfly. His nickname was Dark Fragrance, and his real name was Kill All The Cells.</p>

    <p>"Lord Anxiang... What are we going to do?" someone asked nervously.</p>

    <p>"Since it's come to this, there's no other way. Only by combining all the strength of everyone here inside the barrier can we defend ourselves and launch a counterattack." This Lord Anxiang in white said slowly, "We can't win with strength, but in terms of numbers, we may have a ray of hope..."</p>

    <p>A strategy of sheer numbers...</p>

    <p>They fell silent, lost in deep thought.</p>

    <p>In terms of individual strength, they actually weren't weak at the third level of the Soul Formation stage.</p>

    <p>This was the manpower which Night Chief was able to muster in a short time after the collective deaths of the overseas returnee group of elites.</p>

    <p>However, even if each of them was at the third level of the Soul Formation stage, this was far from enough in the face of a person like Evil Sword God. Soul Formation, Itinerant Immortal, True Immortal... The disparities in these three stages were like night and day; right now, they were like clay chickens and pottery dogs huddled inside a dark cellar.</p>

    <p>"This is our last chance, I suggest that we listen to Lord Anxiang," someone said just then.</p>

    <p>Everyone looked at each other in dismay before finally turning to look at this Lord Anxiang.</p>

    <p>The Dark Network man nicknamed Dark Fragrance took a deep breath. "First, I have to tell you that this is a forbidden spell and can shorten your lifespan, though not by very much. It requires everyone to work together..."</p>

    <p>"Lord Anxiang, please go ahead! We are at your disposal!" the eleven people said in unison.</p>

    <p>The man called Dark Fragrance explained, "There are roughly 37.2 trillion cells in the human body working energetically every day. The spell works to activate these cells, separate them from our bodies, and then further summon them out in secret formation. If used properly and with the twelve of us working together, we can conjure up thousands of cell legions..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, the eleven people were all enlightened: it seemed that this Lord Anxiang was originally a biological scientist and very familiar with the composition of cells in a human body.</p>

    <p>"Thousands of cell legions?"</p>

    <p>"Correct. The main force is the white cell army, and we can even form an army of priests comprised primarily of platelets! What I'm going to do now is summon a platelet out of my body to use it as a parent to draw out the cells from your bodies."</p>

    <p>When he was done speaking, this Lord Anxiang had already swiftly made a hand seal as he roared at the same time, "â€” Ho! Cells At Work <sup>2</sup> Spell</p>
