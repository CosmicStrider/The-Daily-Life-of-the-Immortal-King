  <h1>Chapter 462 Daoist Guang's Figurine Plan </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't watch Daoist Guang's live stream to the end. After all, the exams were coming soon, and even if it was him, it was still important to study for them. Most crucially, for Wang Ling, they weren't purely just exams, but a game where he had to precisely control the final exam results...</p>

    <p>His scores could neither be low nor high. If they were low, his teachers would be unhappy. If they were high, Father Wang would have a heart-to-heart chat with him.</p>

    <p>He had already done the revision for the Dao talismans class, and could more or less manipulate his score so that it would be above the class average. Teacher Pan never set her papers the normal way, and was very fond of including questions not covered in the syllabus. To Wang Ling, these questions were actually very simple, but he couldn't answer them!</p>

    <p>That was because in most cases, the people who could answer this type of questions were the cream of the crop in the elite class, such as Sun Rong and Su Xiao, who were the outstanding elites that Teacher Pan would often single out for praise. However, this was too ostentatious and made Wang Ling very uncomfortable... so he would pretend that he couldn't answer the questions.</p>

    <p>Actually, this kind of feeling was quite unbearable. It was like when the children next door had just learned the multiplication table and came running over to test you; you had to smile and pretend you didn't know it...</p>

    <p>What was most important in taking an exam? Attitude!</p>

    <p>Of course, not just in an exam, but also in other types of work.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling remembered not long ago when a member of a national top MOBA team had gone out with a girl the night before a competition and hadn't participated in the training <sup>1</sup> . As a result, the team suffered a historic crushing defeat in the second round: zero towers, zero dragons and zero heads... A very cool fan even expressly sent the player a song mocking him.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This refers to Chen "Haro," a jungler for EDward Gaming.)</dfn>

    <p>So no matter what, attitude was everything...</p>

    <p>After looking at his review materials for about five minutes, Wang Ling closed his maths textbook and exercise book.</p>

    <p>He had finished doing his revision...</p>

    <p>Looking at the room clock, Wang Ling couldn't help sighing: Time passed by so slowly!</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, Daoist Guang had already logged out of the live stream. The screen in the live stream room was dark, but there were still over one million people inside who were posting "666" like crazy.</p>

    <p>It looked like everything had happened as Daoist Guang had intended: relying on a katana, he had killed twenty people and had led Little Brother GAYLIGAYQI toward becoming the winner.</p>

    <p>It was unfathomable to a lot of people, and was even more amazing than the return of cheat live streamer Nuomi <sup>2</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Muoyinnuomi is an infamous
game live streamer who had
initially been banned for using
cheats in PUBG, but for some
reason had had his ban lifted
recently.)</dfn>

    <p>In the three-person chat group comprising Wang Ling, Lord Diulei and Daoist Guang...</p>

    <p>After going offline, Daoist Guang immediately sent a few amused emojis. " <em>Hia hia hia </em>, this old man set the trend this time and I have at least a million more fans!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Mm, I saw Brother Guang's live stream. You killed twenty people with a katana and as per your agreement, you made that passerby little brother the winner in the end. Brother Guang, you're quite remarkable..."</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang: "But this way of winning is too eye-catching, and I can't use it all the time. In a high-level round, no matter how precise the katana is, it's still no match for a bullet to the head. I was quite lucky with my success today; in the end, these juniors were still too young."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "The super administrator showed up and didn't detect Brother Light using cheats, but I have a feeling that Brother Light did cast a minor spell?"</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang laughed. "Brother Lei, you're so smart! This can't be considered a cheat, right?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Not at all... You're an immortal to begin with..."</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang laughed. "My grand plan right now is to pull in more fans and eventually sway these people into becoming my believers and have them make figurines for me. In this way, I may be able to successfully pass through the Samsara Spirit Tribulation..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was shocked. "There's this type of operation?"</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang: "It's also my first time hearing about figurines... But we can certainly try it out. If I'm using figurines instead of statues to get through the tribulation, all the material specifications have to be the same, and my figurine has to be made very meticulously."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei shook his head and said in the chat group, "I think it'll be a bit difficult!'</p>

    <p>Detailed figurines were very expensive nowadays, and in this day and age, they weren't just figurines; they weren't just for show or collecting.</p>

    <p>There were a lot of very costly figurines on the market now which had personally been enlightened by Almightys. You could carry one on you, and if you encountered an unexpected situation, like something suddenly falling from the sky, the figurine would automatically emit a protective golden light... The most expensive figurine cost 9.8 billion immortal gold bars, and it was said that this figurine's life could be traded for yours!</p>

    <p>That was to say, even if you were the subject of an extremely inauspicious divination, the figurine could help you avert danger!</p>

    <p>But this was 9.8 billion... and it was in immortal gold bars! No one could afford this sky-high price; it was almost as much as the total wealth of an international top 100 corporation.</p>

    <p>Thinking this, Lord Diulei couldn't help looking at the Soul-Suppression Ring he was wearing; it could also avert danger, and its effects were obviously more world-defying than that crazy expensive enlightened figurine.</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang clearly shared Lord Diulei's line of thought as he typed, "I checked up on figurines before, and I know there's an extremely expensive one worth 9.8 billion immortal gold bars which can trade its life for yours."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei nodded. "That's right, Brother Guang, I heard that the figurine had been meticulously created by tens of thousands of skilled craftsmen to the extent that even every pore is lifelike. For the sake of authenticity, a blackhead had even been specially stuck onto the figurine's nose during the planning process."</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang nodded. "Yes, I can imagine that's the case. A figurine of this level would certainly have some great death swap spell fused into it, but few people are capable of casting this kind of spell."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Could it be Immortal Zhenyuan?"</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang's lips twitched. "Given that senior's <em>niaoxing <sup>3</sup> </em>, it really is possible that he might have made this figurine!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(Niaoxing literally translates
into 'urine character,' and
while it can be an offensive
term, it is also used to
describe someone who is
awesome or cool for doing
something extraordinary ..)</dfn>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang: "But I don't need such a high grade figurine. As long as my features are detailed enough, that would be fine. Brother Lei, do you know anyone who can do it?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "I truly don't! I'll have to ask my friends... If you really want to get figurines made, we have to be careful in our search. Nowadays, the figurines made in those small workshops outside are all grossly misshapen..."</p>

    <p>"Ha ha ha!"</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang sent a teary smile emoji. "By the way, Brother Lei, why hasn't Senior Ling said anything in our three-person chat group? I know he's been looking for ways for me to regain my physical body, but since I've decided to try using figurines to go through the Samsara Spirit Tribulation, then this matter is no longer an urgent one..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Mm, just say it directly. Brother Ling's lurking; he has definitely read it!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
