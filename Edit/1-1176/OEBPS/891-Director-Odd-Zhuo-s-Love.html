  <h1>Chapter 891 Director Zhuo Yi's 【Love】</h1>

  <div>

    <p>News of the battle in which evil was vanquished on Mixiu's border over the sea traveled faster than Zhuo Yi imagined. After watching the news on TV, veteran Zhuo Yi could roughly guess what had happened.</p>

    <p>It had to be some person from the Office of Strategic Deception on a mission, who had once again given him all the credit. But the problem was that he was just a Golden Core cultivator! If any type of credit was given to him now, Zhuo Yi immediately felt immense pressure.</p>

    <p>In short...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was well aware.</p>

    <p>He probably wasn't going to get any rest tonight.</p>

    <p>As soon as the midnight news came out, the phone in Zhuo Yi's apartment started ringing off the hook with all kinds of congratulations.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi checked the message which he had just posted in Wechat Moments hours ago.</p>

    <p>It was actually very short, and only contained one word: <em>Exhausted!</em></p>

    <p>Of course, it didn't have anything to do with vanquishing evil - Zhuo Yi had purely been referring to how inadequate he felt since shooting to fame after becoming the director of the General Administration of 100 Schools.</p>

    <p>But it was still too early for Zhuo Yi to retire.</p>

    <p>He had only just assumed this position; it would be at least another five hundred years before he could retire.</p>

    <p>After the midnight news, Zhuo Yi's post instantly received hundreds of likes.</p>

    <p>"As expected of Director Zhuo. You can even vanquish evil and uphold Dao across the sea! I saw it! The admiration on that Mixiu hero cultivator's face when he was interviewed! That Light of the City has never show admiration like this for anyone else before!"</p>

    <p>"Director Zhuo is young and promising. On top of handling study issues, he vanquishes evil and upholds Dao on the side - he is the model for our young generation!"</p>

    <p>"I heard that the fiend destroyed the leader of the Office of Strategic Deception's medicine team Immortal Toya's Chrysanthemum Island. I'm in the film business, and to celebrate Director Zhuo's remarkable feat, he can contact me anytime. Once Immortal Toya's Chrysanthemum Island has been rebuilt, we can make a film called <em>To Chrysanthemum Island </em>based on this event, and the protagonist will be modeled on Director Zhuo."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi flushed when he read these compliments.</p>

    <p>Because this really had nothing to do with him.</p>

    <p>But since the Office of Strategic Deception had already decided on this, he had no choice but to shoulder this wok.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi's heart was very tired.</p>

    <p>He used to carry the wok for one person.</p>

    <p>Now, he had become "Wok King" for the entire sect.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Tuesday, August 22nd.</p>

    <p>It was the ninth day of the summer break.</p>

    <p>When Zhuo Yi left home that morning, there was already a large, packed crowd of reporters in front of the main entrance of the staff apartment. The reporters didn't dare directly burst into the building, and so waited at the intersection in front of the apartment for Zhuo Yi to come out.</p>

    <p>That was the only route Zhuo Yi could take to get to work.</p>

    <p>As soon as he appeared at the main entrance, he instantly knew it was a bad idea, but it was too late to turn back even if he wanted to, as the reporters had already spotted him.</p>

    <p>"Director Zhuo is out!"</p>

    <p>Saying that, a reporter opened the briefcase he was holding, and some "telescopic eyes" (tele-eye for short) flew out to hover in the air and start to film Zhuo Yi from all angles.</p>

    <p>These mechanical eyes were magic treasures for conducting interviews and were very popular with reporters now; as long as it had a photo of the target, the telescopic eye would automatically recognize them and carry out the interview.</p>

    <p>However, this magic treasure was very costly, and an ordinary tabloid newspaper wouldn't be able to afford it. As Zhuo Yi stood at the main entrance, several telescopic eyes had already seized the moment to float over to him from afar.</p>

    <p>A glance at the network logo of these telescopic eyes told him that they were from the Toilet Lid network.</p>

    <p>The telescopic eyes played the interview questions which had already been recorded: "Director Zhuo, can you give us details on how you defeated that villain? I heard that he was very strong and Mixiu nation's missiles couldn't hurt him. As a Golden Core Cultivator, can you tell us what was your key to success?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was rendered speechless.</p>

    <p>Details...</p>

    <p>How would he know!</p>

    <p>Of course he had a key to success!</p>

    <p>It was his <em>shifu </em>Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>But to say that... He didn't dare!</p>

    <p>" <em>Ai </em><sup>1</sup>..." Zhuo Yi sighed.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This interjection and the Chinese word for "love" share the same pronunciation.)</dfn>

    <p>The reporters heard his reply from a distance.</p>

    <p>Love?</p>

    <p>Immediately, they were utterly stunned by this simple but impressive answer.</p>

    <p>It could only be said, as expected of currently the most well-known official in Songhai City, who had caught the most devils and demons.</p>

    <p>The reporter with the telescopic eye from the Toilet Lid network cried out in surprise, "General Director Zhuo's key to dealing with evil is actually: love!"</p>

    <p>It was pandemonium.</p>

    <p>The reporters were all blank.</p>

    <p>Love?</p>

    <p>For a moment, all the reporters on the road were quiet as they pondered this meaning.</p>

    <p>The Toilet Lid Network reporter sighed with feeling. "It looks like the reason these villains were vanquished was because they were moved by Director Zhuo Yi's 'love.' To use such a succinct word as 'love,' Director Zhuo vividly expresses the boundless love and fearlessness he feels when he confronts evil, as well as his magnificent ambition and mighty determination to change the world with the power of love; it also depicts his beautiful dream as a man of the people to love them, love his work, and to use all his love and passion to reform these villains."</p>

    <p>"So... so that's it..."</p>

    <p>Many of the reporters were dumbstruck for a moment when they heard this.</p>

    <p>They were hurriedly taking notes in their notebooks.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>At that moment, the reporter used the telescopic eye to ask again, "What I said should be right, shouldn't it? Is there anything that Director Zhuo wants to add?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was rendered speechless: "I..."</p>

    <p>The Toilet Lid Network reporter cried out again in surprise, "I?"</p>

    <p>A lot of the other reporters who were taking notes raised their heads. "Excuse me, what does this 'I' mean?"</p>

    <p>After thinking about it for a few seconds, this Toilet Lid Network little brother suddenly knocked his head. "I'm such a blockhead! It actually took me so long to understand Director Zhuo's meaning! Director Zhuo clearly meant 'one for all and all for one' with this 'I'! 'Love' and 'I' were the keys to Director Zhuo's success this time! What he wants to tell us is that in the face of dangers and difficulties, we should be like him and go forth fearlessly with a spirit of self-sacrifice, and spread love to every corner of the world!"</p>

    <p>"So that's what he meant!"</p>

    <p>"You're a genius, bro!"</p>

    <p>"Bro, you're awesome!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>At that moment, a voice came out from the telescopic eye. "Thank you, Director Zhuo, for your brilliant responses, our interview is done. We won't keep you from going to work, otherwise we'll be criticized for it."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Watching the telescopic eyes as well as that group of reporters with immense comprehension skills leave, Zhuo Yi was lost in silence for a very long time.</p>

    <p><em>Ai </em>, his heart was so tired.</p>
