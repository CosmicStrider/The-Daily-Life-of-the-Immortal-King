  <h1>Chapter 1092 Sun Yiyuan</h1>

  <div>

    <p>There was a sea of people on the sports field after school. Male and female students from Senior Grade One to Senior Grade Three surrounded the plastic rails around the track as they waited for the start of the battle between men.</p>

    <p>The teachers quietly observed the situation from where they were standing on the teaching building, and would step in to maintain order when it became necessary. Some of the teachers sighed inwardly at Sun Rong's influence.</p>

    <p>As expected of the eldest daughter of Huaguo Water Curtain Group... If the person the two boys were fighting over wasn't Sun Rong, it would never have caught the attention of the whole school.</p>

    <p>"If only they were just as energetic during the after-school supplementary lessons." A teacher clapped her hand to her forehead with a wry smile.</p>

    <p>"But why didn't the director and headmaster stop them?"</p>

    <p>"The headmaster said that with school just starting, it's good for students to exchange pointers once in a while. Also, there's an exchange meet coming up between schools in our Peiyuan district and other districts."</p>

    <p>"Another one? What is it this time? Sword techniques? Talismans? Or survive skills?"</p>

    <p>"I heard it would be an exchange of body techniques. Xia Ming is in fact an excellent candidate. Each school will be sending a delegation of ten members, and Headmaster Chen has already settled on the name list. It's just that for the final spot, Headmaster Chen is stuck between choosing Xia Ming or Wang Ling."</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling's overall grades aren't as good as Xia Ming's, right?"</p>

    <p>"That's true, but in all the school exchange activities which Wang Ling participated in last semester, our school ended up winning." When the teacher said that, the teachers around him instantly understood.</p>

    <p>The strength of a mascot was no joke!</p>

    <p>They almost forgot that this Student Wang Ling was a mascot...</p>

    <p>The duel was about to begin, but Sun Rong was nowhere to be seen.</p>

    <p>After confessing her love to Wang Ling in public, Sun Rong was so ashamed, and she was escorted home by the bodyguards with a red face. However, some bodyguards who remained behind would broadcast the duel live so that she could watch it from home.</p>

    <p>At that very moment, Sun Rong stared at the image of the crowded sports field, a very complicated expression on her face. She had never imagined that she would one day confess her love to a boy in public, and even cause a fight for her affections.</p>

    <p>Well, it wasn't her fault that she was pretty!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, in the massive chairman's office on the top floor of Huaguo Water Curtain Group's building headquarters, a vigorous-looking old man with gray, grizzled, slicked back hair and a pipe between his teeth was also paying attention to what was happening at the school.</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan, chairman of Huaguo Water Curtain Group, already knew about his granddaughter confessing to a boy in public.</p>

    <p>When he heard this, the old man had been very shocked and almost choked on his spit.</p>

    <p>"What? Rongrong confessed to someone?" Sun Yiyuan felt that it was incredible. Since long ago, it had only ever been his own granddaughter who had been confessed to, and she turned them down politely - Old Man Sun never imagined that his granddaughter would take the initiative to confess to someone herself</p>

    <p>"That's right; I heard that Eldest Young Miss confessed to a boy in a very loud voice, and even said that she wanted to be with him forever." Standing on the side, his assistant, dressed in a white uniform, tactfully described what happened.</p>

    <p>He thought that Old Man Sun would be angry. After all, it wasn't as if Eldest Young Miss had never been pestered by sons from some high-ranking families before. However, these people left her alone after receiving a large amount of money from the old man, half as a bribe and half as blackmail.</p>

    <p>But the assistant was surprised by Old Man Sun's unexpected attitude. Rather than get angry, the old man conversely seemed very pleased this time. "Rongrong has never told any boy before that she wants to be with him. It seems she means it this time."</p>

    <p>"Is that what the chairman thinks..."</p>

    <p>"Otherwise?" Sun Yiyuan asked, "Who is the boy Rongrong confessed to?"</p>

    <p>The assistant pulled up the live broadcast at Number 60 High and pointed to a handsome boy with dead fish eyes on the screen. "Actually... Chairman, you may have heard of this boy: he's the classmate whom Eldest Young Miss took to the Xiao Family Compound last semester, and they were attacked by Shadow Stream..."</p>

    <p>"Oh, it's him! But... What's his name again?"</p>

    <p>"It seems he's called Wang..." The assistant patted his head. The words were clearly already on his lips, but he couldn't speak them for some reason.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's Great Shielding Spell was still working to some extent at that moment. Only when a person saw Wang Ling's true appearance would the effect of the shield be dispelled.</p>

    <p>Of course, this true appearance referred to seeing Wang Ling in person, and not through a live video like this.</p>

    <p>Even if a person saw Wang Ling's face in the video, they still wouldn't be able to remember anything about him.</p>

    <p>"It's fine if you can't remember - investigate it later. The duel is more important right now." Old Man Sun waved his hand indifferently, and his assistant breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>The assistant used a magic artifact to directly project the live images into the air.</p>

    <p>Both boys wore school uniforms, but from what Wang Ling could see through his trademark dead fish eyes, Old Man Sun's gaze was firmly fixed on Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"His looks are passable, but the dead fish eyes make him look a little listless." Old Man Sun nodded thoughtfully. "If it's confirmed that this Student Wang is going to date Rongrong, ask him if he's willing to get double eyelids and eyelift surgery - I'll cover the costs and damages."</p>

    <p>"..." The assistant was silent before saying, "But the young miss said that she liked everything about Student Wang..."</p>

    <p>"Oh... is it like that... so Rongrong likes this type? When they went to the Xiao Family Compound, I thought Rongrong just randomly brought along a boy to accompany her - I didn't think she would start to like him then."</p>

    <p>Old Man Sun sighed. "Forget it. Since it's what Rongrong likes, he can keep his eyelids. However..."</p>

    <p>With that, Old Man Sun turned to stare at this assistant on the side. "Why does Rongrong tell you everything???"</p>

    <p>The assistant froze and looked a little terrified. "Eldest... Eldest Young Miss initially asked me to keep it a secret, but... but this is too big a matter, and I'm worried that it could have a bad impact, which is why I decided to tell you, chairman."</p>

    <p>"Mm, it's good that you didn't keep it from me, but you promised Rongrong you wouldn't tell me, and you didn't keep your word. The merit offsets the offense, so there's no reward or punishment - you shouldn't have any complaints, right?"</p>

    <p>"No..."</p>

    <p>In the assistant's heart: MMP.</p>

    <p>Old Man Sun continued to look at the screen. "How old is this Student Wang? Compared with Rongrong?"</p>

    <p>"He shouldn't be small..." The assistant undid his pants for a look<sup>1</sup>. "I don't know how big he is, but he should be bigger than me? There's nothing to compare with Eldest Young Miss, since she doesn't have one..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The word å¤§ "big" is used in reference to age as well as size.)</dfn>

    <p>"Shut up! I asked about his age!!! I want to know if he's older or younger than Rongrong! I want the exact months and days!!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
