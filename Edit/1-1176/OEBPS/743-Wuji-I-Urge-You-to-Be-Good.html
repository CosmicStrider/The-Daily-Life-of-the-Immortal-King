  <h1>Chapter 743 Wuji, I Urge You to Be Good</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At that moment, the ground trembled non-stop, and all the students flooded out of the military tents to check if it was an earthquake.</p>

    <p>The complicated lines and runes of the array extended out like vipers over the ground, and many of the students were so scared that they scuttled up the trees like monkeys. "Teacher, what's that?"</p>

    <p>A lead teacher maintained order. "Everyone, there's no need to panic. These are the lines and runes of a magic array. They might look scary but are completely harmless to the body."</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wu Zhenjun, who had initially been responsible for a preliminary interrogation of President Dylan and his group, rushed out along with dozens of the teachers who had participated in the operation. Everyone had unsightly expressions on their faces since they had never expected something to happen in the face of their strict vigilance.</p>

    <p>Wu Zhenjun crouched down and carefully analyzed the array lines and runes under his feet.</p>

    <p>"This is the Sea And Sky Array, also known as the Hundred-Li Sea And Sky Array... This is the most advanced transmission array of all level seven spells!" He frowned. "Usually, setting up an array of this level requires array points with a radius of a hundred li to be established at least half a month beforehand before they are ultimately linked together. But the remains only just opened, so it's obviously impossible to set up the points beforehand... this Hundred-Li Sea And Sky Array was created instantly."</p>

    <p>The lead teachers were enlightened. As the commander of the lead teachers appointed by Huaxiu Alliance this time, it could only be said that Wu Zhenjun was truly worthy of his status; in just a few succinct words, he was able to completely analyze the current situation.</p>

    <p>In addition, Wu Zhenjun could tell that the person who had summoned this array definitely had the rumored magic crystal. This was a new type of technology which currently had yet to be made public anywhere in the world. High-level spells could be stored inside the crystal, which only needed to be crushed for the spell to instantly take effect.</p>

    <p>On one side, Wang Ling also followed all the students up into the trees. While he wasn't afraid of the magic array underfoot, he still chose to follow the crowd. This was how a Foundation Establishment student should respond, otherwise it would definitely appear odd.</p>

    <p>The truth was that he had been observing the activity inside the military tent the whole time, and the instant Ghost Head Blade had taken out the magic crystal, Wang Ling had already anticipated that something bad was about to happen.</p>

    <p>Of all the dark forces that Wang Ling had ever encountered, it could only be said that Night Chief was certainly proving to be the biggest threat.</p>

    <p>This was because Night Chief was a foreign power to begin with, and thus was an organization that even the Huaxiu government couldn't directly get rid of. Even if this group was destroyed locally, Night Chief would still remain at large as long as their command division still existed abroad.</p>

    <p>So the best would be if this incident could draw the attention of the International Cultivation Security Bureau.</p>

    <p>Night Chief was now planning to make a move against students, which was the best reason to report it to the International Cultivation Security Bureau.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't intend to do anything since there were enough teachers present; ensuring the students' safety definitely wouldn't be a problem.</p>

    <p>These lead teachers were all first-class experts, to say nothing of the big figure hiding behind them.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's nonchalant gaze fell on a middle-aged man not far away.</p>

    <p>He knew.</p>

    <p>This Excellency, was about to act.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, the Huaxiu Alliance command center was also alarmed by the situation.</p>

    <p>"What a miscalculation..." President Qi leaned on his arms, directly creating deep handprints in the table surface. He could no longer remain composed at the scene in front of him.</p>

    <p>"The other party actually has a magic crystal." To one side, the other Ten Generals were utterly stunned when they saw this.</p>

    <p>It could be said that Ghost Head Blade producing this magic crystal was something no one had anticipated.</p>

    <p>President Qi took emergency countermeasures. The instant he realized that the Sea And Sky Array had been activated, he immediately ordered General Bai to work with Songhai Prison's Mahjong Squad and the Huaxiu Alliance cultivators to set up a defensive shield. On the other end, he remotely maneuvered the Heavenly E-Satellite into launching an "E-Bomb Raining Down From Above" to wipe out this summoned cell army in one go.</p>

    <p>The "E-Bomb Raining Down From Above" was extremely destructive, but with General Bai on the scene at the fake remains, he could erect a shield that would minimize casualties and damage to the greatest extent. Even if some of the Huaxiu Alliance cultivators were impacted by the E-Bomb Raining Down From Above, this was at least far better than the students getting hurt!</p>

    <p>This was the only option...</p>

    <p>"How much longer before the Heavenly-E Satellite is activated?" President Qi asked anxiously, his face already dotted with cold sweat.</p>

    <p>"Lord President, it's still being charged, which will take five more minutes... But the Sea And Sky Array will activate in one minute," said a technician.</p>

    <p>"How can it be so quick?" General Yi was shocked.</p>

    <p>President Qi frowned deeply. "The spells stored inside the magic crystal are set up earlier on, ready for instant use. Looks like it's already too late..."</p>

    <p>"Lord President, what should we do now?" the technician asked.</p>

    <p>President Qi: "First, immediately inform Zhuo Yi's special ops team to coordinate with the lead teachers and evacuate the students. Second, have His Excellency Head of State take action - the best thing we can do is destroy the Sea And Sky Array and interrupt the transfer!" President Qi grit his teeth and said resolutely.</p>

    <p>But it would be an extremely difficult task.</p>

    <p>The Sea And Sky Array was the most powerful magic array of all level seven spells, and the most difficult one to destroy. Because of its immense scope, tracking down its core pattern would be like looking for a needle in a haystack, and even the head of state might not necessarily be able to find it.</p>

    <p>But for now, there didn't seem to be any other way.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi very quickly received the news from President Qi. Because the main garrison was stationed fairly deep in the forest, Zhuo Yi's group had been looking for them for quite a while; who would have expected yet a new problem to arise on their approach.</p>

    <p>The entire forest was now just like a trampoline as every inch of the earth shook. Luo Chuang jumped up and down along with the tremors. "The dark force this time is likely a lot richer than Immortal Mansion - they've even revealed this technology before it's been made public. Perhaps they have their own scientific research team? This is a revolt!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi gave a sigh.</p>

    <p>As the saying went, one typically shouldn't be afraid to fight a hoodlum, but an educated person...</p>

    <p>Seeing Luo Chuang jumping up and down, Xiao Yin felt a little unwell. "Mr Luo, stop jumping. Are you disco dancing on shit?"</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang: "..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "... Now is not the time for jokes, we must do something to first protect the children."</p>

    <p>"Do you have a plan?" asked Luo Chuang.</p>

    <p>After cupping his chin and thinking for a while, Zhuo Yi fixed his gaze on the girl wrapped in bandages. "Wuji, can you move the entire magic array to a different location?"</p>

    <p>Wuji shook her head. "Are you trying to wear out this old woman? I'd be dead tired moving such a huge array! No way, no way!"</p>

    <p>At that time, Zhuo Yi took out a ring and smiled slightly as he looked at her. "Wuji, I urge you to be good. Lord Diulei gave five of his ten Flame of Purification spells to me previously..."</p>

    <p>Could this thing be given away?</p>

    <p>Wuji's attitude changed immediately. "Yes master, I'm going!"</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang and Xiao Yin: "..."</p>
