  <h1>Chapter 431 Happy Barbeque Festival, Everyone!<sup>0</sup> </h1>

  <div>
  
    <dfn><sup>0</sup>(Refers to being single during Chinese romantic festivals like Qixi.)</dfn>

    <p>It was a little late after school today because the people who had been watching Taoist Guang's live stream with Guo Hao in the morning had all gotten detention. Not only that, they had gotten the whole class into trouble. Because of the main instigators Chen Chao and Guo Hao, these two cheek gods who advocated that "being cheeky is good for your health," Teacher Pan had held an hour-long meeting after school to castigate them.</p>

    <p>Only one person had been exempted by Teacher Pan and let off early, and that was Sun Rong...</p>

    <p>The students in class did actually understand that Teacher Pan couldn't afford to offend this Young Miss at all... What Wang Ling found most impressive was how Teacher Pan's smiling face as she sent Sun Rong off instantly changed when she returned to the classroom - she flipped faces faster than flipping through a book.</p>

    <p>Moreover, Teacher Pan even specially explained why she had let Sun Rong leave. "Student Sun Rong always gets good grades, is sensible and never makes trouble! Her parents personally gave me a phone call to explain the situation. Otherwise, I wouldn't have let her off so easily, even if it was Student Sun Rong! Am I, Pan Shengcong, the kind of person to bow and scrape to others?"</p>

    <p>This time, Wang Ling heard everyone speak in unison in their hearts: YES!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The days were very long in July in Songhai city. Wang Ling left school close to half past six, but the sky was still bright and it wasn't even sunset yet.</p>

    <p>He followed behind Chen Chao and Guo Hao, and could hear them grumbling as they walked.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "This Old Pan didn't give us any face at all. In all of my sixteen years of school, she's definitely the worst teacher-in-charge I've ever seen! Now that she's taken our phones away, we might never get them back..."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao laughed. "It's just over ninety marks in every subject, so what? I can do that."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao's jaw dropped. "When did you become so motivated?"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "Actually, after thinking about it, Old Pan does have her flaws, but her job isn't easy. She's taught so many elite classes but none of them have placed very well in the district ranking. People in and outside school badmouth her behind her back, but she doesn't care at all, and still persists in being the first person to arrive at school every morning."</p>

    <p>When Chen Chao said this, Guo Hao was silent for a bit. Everything the other boy had said was the truth, and there could be no doubting Teacher Pan's professional dedication.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "Also, think about it, during the Shuigou Sect incident, Old Pan was busy contacting parents the whole time, and for so many days, but she never complained. She might be too intense usually... but she also has her good points."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao frowned slightly. "What you say does sound reasonable."</p>

    <p>Behind them, Wang Ling was a little startled; he had completely never expected to suddenly hear the two "cheek gods" in class, who usually complained about Teacher Pan the most, actually discuss her merits.</p>

    <p>Tch...</p>

    <p>Maybe they had drunk fake wine or taken fake medicine...</p>

    <p>Just as Wang Ling walked out of the school gates, he saw that Chen Chao had already arrived at the crossing up ahead. As if he had been jerked out of a nightmare, he was sweating profusely and gasping for breath. "Holy shit! Scared me to death!"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "???"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "When we left the teaching building just now, did you feel Old Pan's gaze focused on your back?"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "No..."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao spoke in a whisper, "People at the Golden Core stage have very sharp ears! But usually it's safe once you're outside the school..."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "So what you said just now..."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao rubbed his jaw. "Mm, it was to ease the conscience - half of it was true!"</p>

    <p>Looking at them from a distance, Wang Ling then saw an elegant and beautiful lady with long hair and fair skin wearing high-heeled shoes who was standing next to them.</p>

    <p>The corners of Wang Ling's lips twitched: "..." Wasn't this Teacher Pan's second form?</p>

    <p>Because of school regulations, teachers weren't allowed to wear heavy makeup or take any youth-retaining medication; in school, Teacher Pan usually looked like a middle-aged auntie.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling had seen this youthful form of hers before!</p>

    <p>Back then, Teacher Pan had used this form when she had paid him a home visit! The memory was still fresh in Wang Ling's mind since the old man had made her a meal of "sweet and sour spare ribs."</p>

    <p>But after more than half a semester in Senior Grade One... Wang Ling was still the only person to have ever seen her in this form.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan pretended not to recognize Chen Chao and Guo Hao as she stood next to them on the roadside while she secretly listened to their conversation.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "No wonder you were praising Old Pan so excessively when we were inside the school, like you'd taken bad meds."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao tsked as he hooked an arm over Guo Hao's shoulder. "You! We've been coming to school early in the morning everyday to swap and copy homework for so long, why hasn't your sense of vigilance increased? But maybe it's because my seat is closer to the door, so I'm usually more on guard..."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao burst out laughing. "Tch, maybe you're just paranoid?"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "To be honest, even now it feels like Old Pan is next to us."</p>

    <p>Next to them, the corners of Teacher Pan's lips twitched. "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling got home, he found Sheep in especially high spirits today.</p>

    <p>Sheep was dressed in a new set of clothes: it was a purplish black gothic dress which even came with a small lace parasol.</p>

    <p>Today, Wang Ling had gotten Sheep to deliver that tattered Taoist robe to Lord Diulei. After that, the latter had directly taken her to Luo Chuang's shop for brush-up maintenance. The clothes Sheep wore in human form had a lot to do with the paint on her framework. The better the paint quality, the purer the color, and the prettier her human clothes would be.</p>

    <p>As for that lace parasol, it was a freebie from Luo Chuang.</p>

    <p>It was just that the material used seemed a little familiar to Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>Back in his room, Wang Ling texted Lord Diulei to let him know that Sheep had already returned home, and in passing asked about progress on the space assessment.</p>

    <p>About five or six minutes later, Lord Diulei replied, "Hahaha! Good that she's home! The space assessment is still in progress; activating the instrument takes time, and we need to investigate the data. Don't worry, Brother Ling, I'll keep an eye on it! By the way, Sheep should be very happy today, right? Luo Chuang specially made that white lace umbrella!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling couldn't help asking, "What's it made of?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "The hair which Xiao Yin dropped at my place."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "I heard that last time, Xiao Yin was played by Brother Er Ha, and the blow from getting its heart broken was especially heavy."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
