  <h1>Chapter 918 The Word Is Law</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was a mess in the bar as many monsters were scared off - they had never seen such a fearful monster.</p>

    <p>Who was this red giant with devil king horns? He actually dared to brazenly create havoc and had even killed the bartender.</p>

    <p>The monsters were stupefied. Some of them lay on the ground with their arms over their heads, while others pushed each other to scramble straight out of the bar; their ear-piercing howls as they ran off rattled everyone's eardrums.</p>

    <p>"The game's sound simulations are also so real; it actually has fade-out reactions." Looking at the fleeing monsters, Chen Chao couldn't help sighing.</p>

    <p>"Ow!" Just then, Chen Chao suddenly let out a cry of pain — he had been hit in the back by a laser beam!</p>

    <p>Thanks to the protective spirit light, however, the laser beam didn't penetrate Chen Chao's armor, and the pain was next to nothing — it was like your forehead being flicked.</p>

    <p>An excited look on his face, Chen Chao turned around and grabbed the lizard waiter lying on the ground who had shot at him. "Hahaha! The NPCs here can actually fight back! Sure enough, it's just like Vice City!"</p>

    <p>The lizard waiter wore a horrified expression.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao and Su Xiao came close. When they saw this, they were full of praise. Guo Hao sighed. "This game must have cost a lot to make. Look, even this thing's panicked expression is on point! As if it's read <em>An Actor Prepares <sup>1</sup> </em>!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(By Russian author Konstantin Stanislavski..)</dfn>

    <p>Just as Chen Chao pointed the gun at this lizard waiter, sirens rang out outside the bar.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao was delighted at this. "Don't worry, we've already triggered the plot. At this moment, someone is bound to show up to help us avoid being arrested by the guards."</p>

    <p>As soon as he said the words, a huge hole suddenly appeared in the ceiling and a figure in a black cloak dropped down from it.</p>

    <p>"See! What did I say?" Chen Chao laughed.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Fang Xing and Bai Qiao: "..."</p>

    <p>"Why are you still spacing out? Let's go!" The cloaked man whose face was hidden behind a clown mask spread his arms wide as soon as he landed, opening a dazzling purple space tunnel.</p>

    <p>But this wasn't a magic spell; Wang Ling had already noticed the jade ring on the cloaked man's finger. This space tunnel had been opened purely with the power amassed in the jade ring.</p>

    <p>This was an unknown power source that was neither spirit qi nor primordial qi.</p>

    <p>What it was, and what this planet full of monsters was... they would learn all the answers soon.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Before a large group of lizard guards arrived at the bar on wyverns bearing flashing lights on their heads, Wang Ling's party wound up in a mysterious base with the help of the cloaked man who had suddenly appeared.</p>

    <p>They were underground.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had already examined the entire planet with his King's Eye, and he knew where he was no matter the location.</p>

    <p>"After all these years, someone has finally come." The man took off his mask and undid the black cloak he was wearing.</p>

    <p>This was a stalwart-looking middle-aged man with short sideburns and a triangular mole at the corner of his eye. He took off the black cloak to reveal a white sports shirt and black sports trousers underneath, and a medal on his right chest caught Wang Ling's attention.</p>

    <p>This was a Huaxiu Cultivation and Magic Treasure Research Institute medal; his dumbass older brother Wang Ming also had one!</p>

    <p>It wasn't just Wang Ling, but everyone else also noticed this familiar logo.</p>

    <p>Since quite a number of the factory-manufactured commercial magic treasures on the market were patented products by the research institute, it wasn't surprising that even students found this symbol familiar.</p>

    <p>"Look, Wang Ling, what did I say? We triggered the plot, didn't we?" Hand over his mouth as he whispered, Chen Chao gently nudged Wang Ling, who was next to him.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Who are you?" Fang Xing gazed at the man in front of them.</p>

    <p>"Just like you, I am from Huaxiu nation. My name is Guo Ping." At this point, the man looked up.</p>

    <p>He then turned to look at Guo Hao. "And this is my nephew."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao gaped. He had never thought that his omnipotent uncle would really plant an Easter egg in this virtual game...</p>

    <p>Guo Ping: "Although you are not my biological nephew, your father is a distant older brother of mine."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao immediately said dutifully, "How do you do, uncle..."</p>

    <p>"What on earth is going on?" Fang Xing asked.</p>

    <p>"You are now on a planet called Divine Dao Star, which is beyond the Domain of the Gods." Guo Ping frowned, and seemed to be recalling the past. He clicked his watch open, and a chart of fluctuating data was instantly projected into the air.</p>

    <p>After some consideration, Guo Ping told everyone, "When the Gate Between Worlds descended about six years ago, amidst the energy fluctuations from the demon world, we detected a trace of unusual energy which we had never seen before. This unusual energy is stronger than spirit qi, and given that the spirit qi on Earth is running out, we started to investigate the source of this unusual energy."</p>

    <p>Guo Ping then twisted the watch face, and the projected image in the air also switched to a map of the universe.</p>

    <p>"This is where we are from, Earth."</p>

    <p>Guo Ping pointed to a blue planet on the map which was no more than the size of an ink dot.</p>

    <p>He then turned his gaze elsewhere. "As for the area in the middle which I've marked with a red circle, we call this the inner domain. The orange circle beyond it is outside the Milky Way, which is also where the legendary Domain of the Gods is located."</p>

    <p>"Domain of the Gods?" The people from Number 60 High raised their eyebrows.</p>

    <p>They had come across this term in their textbooks.</p>

    <p>The rumor was that this was where ascended Almightys gathered after transcending worldliness and achieving Dao.</p>

    <p>"The Domain of the Gods exists." Guo Ping was very serious and earnest.</p>

    <p>But Chen Chao and the others couldn't help snickering.</p>

    <p>In their eyes, this was just the game setting, and the script felt so real.</p>

    <p>Although they had heard rumors of the "Domain of the Gods" from the textbooks, their teachers had said that such a place didn't exist at all.</p>

    <p>How strong were the Ten Founding Generals?</p>

    <p>And how powerful was the head of state?</p>

    <p>They were so strong, but had never ascended!</p>

    <p>Even though this was what they were thinking, Chen Chao and the others didn't interrupt.</p>

    <p>They knew that the "game plot" was unfolding. Now wasn't the time to interrupt the "NPC's" speech. They had to listen quietly for clues to clearing the game.</p>

    <p>Looking at the map, Guo Ping continued: "What you're looking at now is outside the orange circle and beyond the Domain of the Gods, which is also where Divine Dao Star is located. We eventually determined that the source of this unusual energy was from a place beyond the Domain of the Gods which was thirty million light years away from Earth. Thus, the research institute charged me six years ago to take a small spaceship called God Bright One and look for clues on this unusual energy source."</p>

    <p>"Thirty million light years... How did you deal with the problem of energy fuel for the spaceship?"</p>

    <p>"With our country's latest scientific methods, it only takes an hour to fly ten thousand light years at full speed. The problem, however, is the ongoing energy consumption. We didn't have enough fuel to fly that long," Guo Ping said.</p>

    <p>"What happened then..."</p>

    <p>"Then, Scholar Wang Ming found a solution." Saying this, Guo Ping switched to another image projection in the air. "This black string in the image, which looks like hair, is an energy string composed of a high concentration of spirit power. One energy string can keep the ship going for a distance of one million light years. I don't know how Scholar Wang Ming developed this... I still have a wad of it."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Since my lab equipment was made on Earth and isn't compatible with the unusual energy on Divine Dao Star, the power source the lab is currently using is this strand of hair. It's going to burn out soon, and I'll replace it with a new one."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's lips twitched.</p>

    <p>What "looked like hair"...</p>

    <p>It <em>was </em>damn hair!</p>

    <p>Because this hair, was his...</p>
