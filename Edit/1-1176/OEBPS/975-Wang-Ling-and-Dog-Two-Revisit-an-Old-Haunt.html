  <h1>Chapter 975 Wang Ling and Er Ha Revisit an Old Haunt</h1>

  <div>

    <p>A face exactly like Wang Ling's.</p>

    <p>This left Wang Ming in deep thought.</p>

    <p>He couldn't be any more familiar with that face, yet it was also unfamiliar at the same time; the boy had snow-white hair and a smile rarely seen on Wang Ling's face.</p>

    <p>This definitely wasn't the Wang Ling whom Wang Ming was familiar with...</p>

    <p>Was someone imitating his little brother's face? Or was the dream a premonition?</p>

    <p>Wang Ming felt that there was something odd about the whole thing.</p>

    <p>"What's the matter?"</p>

    <p>When Zhai Yin returned, she noticed that Wang Ming's face didn't look good.</p>

    <p>"It's nothing." Wang Ming shook his head. His eyes turned to Zhai Yin. "Contact Roger and ask him if there's been any attack on Mixiu's border base."</p>

    <p>"Alright." Zhai Yin nodded and didn't ask why.</p>

    <p>Roger was an overseas friend of Wang Ming's in Mixiu's magic treasure research institute, and they were very close. When Mixiu constructed the border defense base this time, it was Roger who had sought Wang Ming out on details in the design blueprint. It was also Roger who named Mose, the border defense system's AI robot.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Although Guo Ping had dinner at the Wang family's small villa, he ultimately had yet to say much to Wang Ling. Wang Ling didn't know anything about Guo Ping at all, and before Wang Ming clearly explained the situation, Wang Ling chose to keep his silence as usual. Even when he had to open his mouth, he didn't waste words.</p>

    <p>At the dinner table, Guo Ping complimented him, "Student Wang Ling has quite the character. I like it."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "Mm."</p>

    <p>Father Wang and Mother Wang: "..."</p>

    <p>Guo Ping: "You seem to have a good relationship with my nephew?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "Mm."</p>

    <p>Father Wang and Mother Wang: "..."</p>

    <p>Guo Ping: "Student Wang Ling really... doesn't waste words at all! Do you have any words other than 'mm'?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "Oh."</p>

    <p>Father Wang and Mother Wang: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had always been impassive when it came to people he was unfamiliar with. Father Wang and Mother Wang had specially brought this up before and felt that their son's behavior was actually very impolite. But over time, they got used to it. After all, Wang Ling was a Capricorn: it was really hard for him to get along with someone he didn't know...</p>

    <p>Personality-wise, Guo Ping just so happened to be the opposite. He was naturally easy-going and very enthusiastic about everything. His personality was in sharp contrast to Wang Ling's, and for a time, the latter felt at a loss.</p>

    <p>Before he left, Guo Ping received a reply from Wang Ming, who was already awake and had gotten Roger to check on the border.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming knew that Guo Ping was still at the Wang family's small villa. Given Wang Ling's personality, Guo Ping must have gotten the "cold-shoulder treatment" when he dropped by; Wang Ming knew his brother's personality too well. He apologized to Guo Ping and blamed himself, not necessarily with the intention of protecting Wang Ling, but largely because he hadn't communicated with Wang Ling about it this time.</p>

    <p>But Guo Ping wasn't bothered, since he was the one who had shamelessly dropped by to begin with, with the intention of feeling Wang Ling out.</p>

    <p>While they hadn't exchanged many words, it could still be said that he now had a preliminary understanding of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This was a seemingly mediocre high school student who was anything but.</p>

    <p>As he was leaving, Guo Ping said to Wang Ling, "Student Wang Ling, shall we go to a noodle shop tomorrow? That shop does fried crispy noodle snacks."</p>

    <p>This time, Wang Ling finally said a third word other than "mm" and "oh."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "Okay."</p>

    <p>Guo Ping was stunned. He had asked so many questions before, but the guy had appeared uninterested in all of them. In the end, at the mention of crispy noodle snacks, he felt that Wang Ling's eyes could set off nuclear bombs... Could this thing be the passcode?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The address of the noodle shop which Wang Ming gave to Guo Ping and Wang Ling was none other than Number 3600 Spirit Stream Road, the spot where Wang Ling had killed the Tuntian Ha when he was six and the location of the original crispy noodle snack flagship store. Furthermore, Fang Xing's family's noodle shop was next to the flagship store, and Fang Xing had been the first witness when Wang Ling killed the Tuntian Ha back then.</p>

    <p>Despite Fang Xing's ongoing invitation, Wang Ling had never been to Fang Xing's family's noodle shop. Now it just so happened to be the summer break, and after writing a personal composition on Chen Chao, Wang Ling thought it was time for him to go out to collect materials and look for inspiration before writing the next personal composition.</p>

    <p>It was September 7th, the twenty-fifth day of the summer break.</p>

    <p>Early that morning, with Er Ha on a leash, Wang Ling headed for Fang Xing's place. Why had he brought Er Ha with him? Actually, this was deliberate on Wang Ling's part. After all, when Er Ha had descended from the sky back then, that had been a traumatic experience for Wang Ling</p>

    <p>Er Ha actually felt very aggrieved. How was this so-called mental traumatic its fault? And even if there <em>was </em>trauma, could it be as big as Er Ha's? It had been killed three times! Three! Furthermore, even its species had changed in the end, hey!</p>

    <p>The Fang family had taken Fang Xing in. His adoptive parents were good people who raised him and ran a very large noodle shop. Wang Ling heard that the Fang couple would be opening a second shop very soon.</p>

    <p>Walking Er Ha, Wang Ling stood on bustling commercial Spirit Stream Road. Directly opposite them was that century-old crispy noodle snack flagship store, and next to it was the noodle shop run by Fang Xing's family.</p>

    <p>Right in the center of this commercial street was a life-sized bronze sculpture of Zhuo Yi. There were two parts to it. One was of Zhuo Yi and the other was of Er Ha's original form as the Tuntian Ha. The bronze sculpture had been made to commemorate Zhuo Yi's great achievement six years ago. As for how Zhuo Yi had defeated Er Ha, there actually hadn't been any other witnesses apart from Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>So the artist who designed the bronze sculpture made it up.</p>

    <p>He made Zhuo Yi very handsome, with a very exaggerated spirit sword in one hand and a valiant expression on the statue's face as it confronted Er Ha's Tuntian Ha bronze statue.</p>

    <p>With Er Ha on the leash, Wang Ling looked at the sculpture for a long time. Dozens of seconds later, the bronze sculpture actually moved...</p>

    <p>Both master and servant were shocked!</p>

    <p>This bronze sculpture could actually move!</p>

    <p>The bronze statue of Zhuo Yi stabbed the sword into Er Ha's stomach. Then, the bronze statue of Er Ha started to spurt water out of its mouth, the beautiful spray sprinkling the ring of plants around it...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>But that still wasn't the most ridiculous thing.</p>

    <p>There was a reticulation system at the base of the sculpture.</p>

    <p>The vegetation had been planted in manmade spirit soil, which absorbed extra moisture that was then drained. This extra water then reaccumulated in the belly of Er Ha's bronze statue for reuse via the reticulation system.</p>

    <p>Er Ha was thus stabbed every five minutes.</p>

    <p>In front of the bronze sculpture, Er Ha rubbed its own stomach and somehow felt that it hurt...</p>
