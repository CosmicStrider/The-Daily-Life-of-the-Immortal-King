  <h1>Chapter 720 Wang Ling's New Nickname</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling was alarmed.</p>

    <p>He understood the reason, but why would he actually gain fans after that incident? â€” The main point was that in the incident with President Bai, he was but a lowly student who had been fortunate enough to escape with his life!</p>

    <p>But since Li Mingyao had brought it up, Wang Ming was a little curious. "May I ask, why are you Wang Ling's fan?"</p>

    <p>The other side straightened his collar, still maintaining that elegant and refined manner. "Have you heard of fortune?"</p>

    <p>Fortune, or actually also known as "immortal fate."</p>

    <p>Although there was no scientific evidence for this thing, one had to admit that it did exist.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, there wouldn't be a specific "Great Fortune Spell" among the Three Thousand Great Dao.</p>

    <p>In simple terms, fortune was like a cultivator's hidden attribute that couldn't be measured precisely - it slowly accumulated through a cultivator's single-minded cultivation and devotion to doing good deeds.</p>

    <p>But as far as Wang Ling knew, everyone had a natural, corresponding base for their fortune. Most people's fortune was zero, and only a small proportion was born with good fortune... Of course, there was another small proportion of people that had naturally poor fortune.</p>

    <p>This was why even if some people continued to do good deeds and accumulate merits, they still led very unfortunate lives. This was very likely because they had committed too many sins in their previous life and hadn't finished paying off their debts.</p>

    <p>Of course, that didn't mean that those with good fortune could do whatever they wanted - no matter how good their fortune, it would be used up eventually.</p>

    <p>And so, the Huaxiu Alliance branch in each city actually advertised tasks in the vein of "eliminating the evil and safeguarding Dao" for cultivators above the Golden Core stage in Huaxiu nation. By accepting and carrying out these tasks, they could improve themselves and at the same time accumulate immortal fate.</p>

    <p>There weren't any rewards for doing these tasks, which were classified as social work carried out by cultivators.</p>

    <p>But in order to encourage more cultivators to take up these tasks, the state had also offered a lot of subsidies over the years. The subsidies took the form of pills, magic artifacts, skill scrolls or an equivalent amount of immortal gold.</p>

    <p>So when Li Mingyao said "fortune," Wang Ming and Wang Ling more or less understood what he meant.</p>

    <p>"President Bai of the Demon Hunters Association was very strong. From the previous news reports, this man had to be an Itinerant Immortal or True Immortal." Saying this, Li Mingyao tsked. "But in a situation that seemed impossible to escape, Classmate Wang Ling broke away from this person's evil clutches and escaped death. His fortune is simply through the roof!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"So your point is?" Wang Ming was starting to understand.</p>

    <p>Li Mingyao gave a very elegant smile. "Fortune this thing is vague, but it's real. To accumulate it, there is actually another, very simple way to do so besides doing good deeds, and that is to be together with someone who has good fortune."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming had a black question mark on his face. "... Be together?"</p>

    <p>"Ah, I certainly don't mean to grow old together... you can be a friend or a fellow brother!" Li Mingyao realized his words just now were indeed a little ambiguous and quickly corrected himself. "Fortune is contagious, don't you know?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Wang Ming: "..."</p>

    <p>Li Mingyao: "In my generation, there are four heirs in our Li family. We all go to different high schools, and the other three are now abroad! Once we graduate from Grade Three, our family will hold the Young Master Succession Ceremony."</p>

    <p>"Choosing a successor should depend on one's skill. Using wily tricks isn't virtuous," Wang Ming said.</p>

    <p>He could more or less understand why Li Mingyao was so eager to find Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"No, teacher, you don't understand. In terms of overall strength, the four heirs of our Li family are actually pretty much the same, whether in terms of study, talent, or every other aspect... So in the end, it'll be fortune that will decide the winner of the young master position!"</p>

    <p>Saying this, Li Mingyao had a look of great urgency in his eyes. "I've already said all that should be said, and this is why I'm eager to find Wang Ling shifu..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Why had he become a shifu once again?</p>

    <p>Li Mingyao: "Neither of you know, do you? The other schools actually have a nickname for Classmate Wang Ling now."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "Nickname?"</p>

    <p>Li Mingyao: "Fortune Emperor!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Wang Ming: "..."</p>

    <p>Li Mingyao: "As long as you're willing to help me find Classmate Wang Ling, I'll reward you handsomely! As for other conditions, you can also name them. My Li family resources should be enough to meet your demands."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming folded his arms and asked, "If we don't know, will you ask someone else?"</p>

    <p>There were plenty of people from Number 60 High here. After the incident with President Bai last time, most of the Grade One freshmen at Number 60 High basically knew what Wang Ling looked like.</p>

    <p>However, contrary to Wang Ming's expectations, Li Mingyao shook his head. "No, I've already asked a lot of friends from Number 60 High, but they all said that they had no impression of Wang Ling."</p>

    <p>After Li Mingyao said this, Wang Ming saw the corners of Wang Ling's mouth curl up slightly and realization instantly dawned on him... It turned out that his little brother had already done something. No wonder he could come to the canteen so calmly.</p>

    <p>This was an upgraded version of Wang Ling's "Great Shielding Spell."</p>

    <p>And it was because of the incident with President Bai this time that Wang Ling had specially modified it.</p>

    <p>When the upgraded "Great Shielding Spell" was in effect, Wang Ling was like a signal tower, and only people within three meters of him would remember him.</p>

    <p>Of course, there were some people whom Wang Ling had designated on his "white list" who wouldn't be blocked.</p>

    <p>Most of them were those whom Wang Ling was closer to in his daily life. Apart from his relatives, there was his scapegoat disciple Zhuo Yi, his friends in the cultivation forum, and some of the teachers at school.</p>

    <p>Seeing that Wang Ming and Wang Ling weren't saying anything, Li Mingyao was already convinced that they knew Wang Ling, so he started to increase his bargaining chips. "As long as you can help me find Classmate Wang Ling, I'm willing to offer an insider account on the 'Cool Collection of Four' app... from level one to level three... no! Level four! Level one to level four skill scrolls, as long as they're in the app, you can browse them whenever you want!"</p>

    <p>But as Li Mingyao said this, Wang Ming and Wang Ling had already stood up together.</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry, we don't know Student Wang Ling. Why don't you try asking someone else?" Wang Ming patted Li Mingyao lightly on the shoulder.</p>

    <p>Before Li Mingyao could reply, Wang Ming promptly looked at him and shouted, "Thank you!"</p>

    <p>To give other people a taste of their own medicine...</p>

    <p>This was exactly Wang Ming's style.</p>
