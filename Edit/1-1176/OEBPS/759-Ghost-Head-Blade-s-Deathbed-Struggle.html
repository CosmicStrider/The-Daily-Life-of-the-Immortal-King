  <h1>Chapter 759 Ghost Head Blade's Deathbed Struggle</h1>

  <div>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ming successfully fired his second shot, which consumed twenty-eight percent of his spirit power reserve. He now only had twelve percent of spirit power left for breaking through the space wall.</p>

    <p>A space crack appeared, and at the same time, there was a system warning from Wang Ming's mecha armor: <em>Up ahead, space fissure, estimated time before fissure seals up is 243 seconds... Current energy remaining: 12%...</em></p>

    <p>The mecha armor had a built-in computer system, but this wasn't an AI system at all. If its design could be combined with satellite technology, it would be even more human-like and intelligent, but Wang Ming could only produce this much for now with the junk from the Dead Sea of Space.</p>

    <p>Just like the system said, the space fissure was already open, but it wouldn't remain open for long.</p>

    <p>Now was the best time to charge out of here.</p>

    <p>"No, you don't!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was about to set out when Ghost Head Blade's roar of anger and grief rang out from below.</p>

    <p>There was a bright light as Ghost Head Blade prepared to use the last bit of his strength to keep Wang Ming here.</p>

    <p>"Sword Master, Sir, go quickly, this humble servant will cover you!" Heavenly Materials pushed Wang Ming forward.</p>

    <p>"No way, if we leave, we do it together." Wang Ming pulled Heavenly Materials along with him. He knew that Heavenly Materials's previous reincarnation was Kunshan, a pitiful sword spirit who had drifted in the silence of the Dead Sea of Space for a hundred years because of his master's carelessness, until he had become so lonely that he self-destructed. Wang Ming really couldn't bear to abandon Heavenly Materials here again.</p>

    <p>But there was already no longer time to think about it.</p>

    <p>However, at that very moment, another space crack appeared in the sky, and a stream of snow-white light flashed past in front of Wang Ming to ultimately strike Ghost Head Blade dead-on...</p>

    <p>Ah!</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade howled in extreme agony.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "..."</p>

    <p>Heavenly Materials: "..."</p>

    <p>What... was that?</p>

    <p>Someone had made a move and killed Ghost Head Blade...</p>

    <p>And it seemed that this light wasn't a spell, but a secret weapon.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, this mysterious expert had acted too quickly, and the mecha armor currently just wasn't capable of capturing the location and image of this secret weapon.</p>

    <p>Heavenly Materials had keen eyes and quick hands, and sword qi swirled up as he snatched at something in the air.</p>

    <p>His hands were instantly smeared with a white powder.</p>

    <p>Heavenly Materials frowned and somehow felt that this stuff was like chalk dust...</p>

    <p>"Could it be Little Master Ling who made a move?" Heavenly Materials suddenly asked.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "You know my little brother?"</p>

    <p>Heavenly Materials smiled. "Sword Master, after this humble servant became the sword spirit of this sword, everything that happened since its forging has been turned into memories that are now stored in this humble servant's mind."</p>

    <p>"It's unlikely it was my little brother." Wang Ming shook his head. "If it was him, he would have been even fiercer. This Ghost Head Blade wouldn't even have time to cry out before instantly dying on the spot."</p>

    <p>Heavenly Materials: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming cocked an eyebrow. Whoever the mystery person was, he didn't have time to care now.</p>

    <p>The most important thing now was to get out of here.</p>

    <p>Thinking this, Wang Ming lifted his eyes, and side by side with Heavenly Materials, he operated the mecha armor and entered the space fissure...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, in the real remains, almost all the activated cells that had fled earlier had been wiped out. Fortunately, given Wu Zhenjun's timely directives, the interior of the remains didn't suffer too much damage.</p>

    <p>Having said that, Night Chief's impact was incalculable. What they really needed to take precautions against was the sensationalized news that would follow abroad. All the other countries had always had their eye on Beast King's Remains Devil Valley, this precious land with good fengshui. With this mishap, Mixiu nation would definitely seize the opportunity to make an international call for a combined force to jointly manage it.</p>

    <p>In the eastern jungle of Beast King's Remains, Zhuo Yi's special ops team had cleaned up nearly half of the activated cells.</p>

    <p>This was because they had Wuji, who was like a living human flesh radar; it was too easy for her to sense the summoned cells that had fled.</p>

    <p>"Wu Zhenjun, I'm already done here. These activated cells have already been killed on site. It's just that with the bodies, how do you think we should handle them?"</p>

    <p>In the Rainbow Glass Box, Wu Zhenjun quickly replied, "Thank you for your hard work, Director Zhuo. We don't have to specially dispose of these cell bodies. They have a lot of organic material in them which can be used as fertilizer."</p>

    <p>"I see." Zhuo Yi nodded.</p>

    <p>"Mm." Wu Zhenjun nodded. "And another thing, we've just detected strange space fluctuations in the western region. Currently, we're not sure whether it's related to Lao Gudong Xiaoer's disappearance. Would Director Zhuo be able to lead your team to go and investigate? The teachers who were sent out earlier have received the order from the higher-ups that they have to reconvene for a meeting... If Director Zhuo is unable to go, I can only send someone tomorrow."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi hurriedly answered, "Wu Zhenjun, what are you talking about? Since we're the special ops team, we naturally should take action. Saving a person is the same as putting out a fire!"</p>

    <p>Wu Zhenjun was exultant. "Then, many thanks, Director Zhuo!"</p>

    <p>After the call ended, Zhuo Yi looked at the people next to him. "Wu Zhenjun said that space fluctuations have been detected in the western region of the remains, and he suspects it might be related to Sir Wang Ming."</p>

    <p>"The fluctuations appeared not long ago; I felt them as well." Wuji frowned. When she sensed unusual fluctuations, the bandages on her face would tighten, and when the space was normal, the bandages would look lax.</p>

    <p>Wuji herself wasn't aware of this fact, but Luo Chuang had noticed it early on, and had told Zhuo Yi about it. As a craftsman of some repute, Luo Chuang was very accurate when it came to surveying magic artifacts.</p>

    <p>Only Wuji herself hadn't yet realized how her bandages changed accordingly...</p>

    <p>It looked like the space fluctuations were real.</p>

    <p>According to what Wuji had said earlier, Wang Ming might have been sucked into the Dead Sea of Space. As long as there wasn't any danger, the Dead Sea of Space would treat him as foreign matter and definitely spit him back out.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the unusual space fluctuations might really be from the space spitting Wang Ming out!</p>

    <p>"Let's go take a look."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi didn't hesitate at all.</p>

    <p>The only people who could freely move around in the remains now was their specially approved special ops team.</p>

    <p>Besides, they now had a justifiable reason to search the western region of the remains, which was to investigate if the space fluctuations were related to Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>Apart from that, they had now finally come to the real objective of their trip.</p>

    <p>Because according to Xiao Yin, Devil King's tomb was in the western region of the remains. If they found this tomb, they might also discover the real reason behind Devil King being eaten in his sleep...</p>

    <p>All these years, there had always been rumors in the outside world that Devil King wasn't truly dead.</p>

    <p>Whether this was rumor or truth, they would only find out everything after their investigation.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the Rainbow Glass Box, because of the chaos of the evening, there was no choice but to suspend the summer camp.</p>

    <p>It was dinnertime and students from the various schools were discussing the incident. Even Li Mingyao and Zhou Youzheng, who had been painstakingly looking for Wang Ling earlier, had forgotten to do so for the time being.</p>

    <p>In the canteen, Wang Ling sat at a table with Su Xiao, Chen Chao and Guo Hao.</p>

    <p>"Have you heard? When the Sea And Sky Array was activated, some people saw a mysterious person appear and scare off the creatures summoned by the array."</p>

    <p>"More nonsense! Where does all this metaphysical stuff come from? You don't know, but I heard that Senior Zhuo Yi is here too, this time as a special ops team member. That mystery person might have been him." Guo Hao shrugged.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's eyebrow twitched. This was obviously information from yet another uncle.</p>

    <p>"Isn't there a saying: there is no peace in this world, only people who shoulder that heavy burden and clear the way forward for us?"</p>

    <p>Across from them, Chen Chao also added, "Heh, a mystery person taking action... I'd sooner believe in Wang Ling up a tree!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "???"</p>
