  <h1>Chapter 121 Are You Senior Killer Taoist? </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Third Saint felt like he had seen this azure uniform somewhere before. For a while, his eyes were fixed on Wang Ling's face, which had yet to finish maturing. And then, it was like a string being unraveled in his brain as he suddenly recalled that this uniform had been in the news very recently! This was the uniform of Number 60 High School in Peiyuan district!</p>

    <p>This used to be an unknown, ordinary high school; if it wasn't because first-class Shadow Stream Red Ribbon assassins had been wiped out in this school, Third Saint didn't think he would have paid it any attention at all.</p>

    <p>He remembered reading about it previously in online news. After carefully recalling the details, he was a little astounded to realize that this school had grown quite famous recently. The complete elimination of Shadow Stream Red Ribbon killers, and the arrest of an executive Gold Ribbon female killer, all seemed to be somehow related to this school...</p>

    <p>And now, this teenager standing in front of him was wearing that school's uniform... Third Saint suddenly felt a little fearful.</p>

    <p>But in the end, there wasn't any direct evidence to link Great Saint and Second Saint's deaths by backlash to this youngster, right?</p>

    <p>Maybe there was some big shot cultivator still hiding inside the villa whom even the Heaven and Earth Spirit Awakening Array hadn't been able to detect.</p>

    <p>Was he afraid?</p>

    <p>That wasn't possible.</p>

    <p>After all these years, he was a seasoned veteran; there were no winds and waves that he hadn't weathered!</p>

    <p>Third Saint remembered when, for the sake of comprehending the meaning of Dao in Soul Formation, he had learned from Old Demon Wang's example and opened a woodcarving shop to carve <em>feijibei </em><sup>1</sup> ... this kid probably hadn't even been born then!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Feijibei literally translates to
"airplane cups," and in
colloquial Chinese is the term
used for male sex toys ..)</dfn>

    <p>He was just a teenager.</p>

    <p>A teenager wearing an ordinary high school uniform.</p>

    <p>There was nothing to fear.</p>

    <p>Third Saint kept comforting himself in his heart.</p>

    <p>Standing at the door, Wang Ling was lost for words as he listened to this old Taoist's turbulent thoughts. As he was wondering why the man hadn't made a move, he saw a spirit light flash in the other party's hand. A wine gourd appeared, and the old Taoist started gulping down mouthfuls of wine.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was stunned; was this the legendary "liquid courage"?</p>

    <p>Was the man that frightened to face him?</p>

    <p>It was hard for Third Saint to describe it accurately with words. The other party wasn't using spiritual pressure or any other technique — he couldn't even detect any evidence of the teenager using his spiritual senses to feel things out. It was just that now that they were face to face, the ferocious killing intent which this Soul Formation cultivator had come here with had already disappeared. Instead, an extreme sense of crisis had taken its place, and Third Saint had been forced to embolden himself with alcohol.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling took a glimpse at the wine gourd in the old Taoist's hand. This xx82 vintage wine which promoted courage was currently very popular in the cultivation industry. Senior cultivators had drunk this in their confrontation with the demons that had poured out from the Gate Between Worlds — it also tasted great. The gate hadn't appeared for very long, but drinking this emboldening wine before battle had become a tradition.</p>

    <p>Typically, Third Saint would drink this wine in a fight against a formidable enemy... but this old Taoist in white had never expected that such an ordinary-looking, poker-faced teenager with dead eyes could provoke such terror in him.</p>

    <p>With all the wine from the gourd now in his belly, the old Taoist's face was flushed with alcohol. "Here I come!"</p>

    <p>As he stabbed the sword directly at Wang Ling's front, the air whistled with silver-colored sword qi. The force was so overwhelming that anyone with a realm under Soul Formation would be killed by the sword qi alone before the tip of the sword could even touch them.</p>

    <p>If this teenager really was a Foundation Establishment high school student, there was nowhere for him to run from the old Taoist's sword, and he would instantly be smashed to pieces.</p>

    <p>The Ten Saints cultivated the Demonic Path, but each of them had their own particular magic weapon. Some cultivated with a hammer, some with an axe, and some with a bar of soap... what Third Saint, this old Taoist in white, cultivated with was a sword!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling could instantly tell that this was the "Art of the Three Swords" created by one of the nation's ten great founding generals, Blademaster General Yi! There were three parts to this sword art: the bronze art for defense, the gold art for offense, and the silver art which could both attack and defend.</p>

    <p>It was very obvious that what Third Saint cultivated wasn't the gold sword nor the bronze sword... but the silver sword!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't move from where he was standing, and just blinked his eyes hard.</p>

    <p>The old Taoist in white was startled by this teenager's move — was this boy making eyes at him? Don't tell him this guy was fucking bent?!</p>

    <p>But very quickly... he suddenly realized he was wrong.</p>

    <p>Because before his silver sword qi could reach the teenager, it was actually stopped in mid-air. No matter if it was the sword qi or the sword itself, they were blocked by immense power and unable to advance.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Third Saint suddenly recalled the teenager's blinking.</p>

    <p>So it hadn't been a useless move!</p>

    <p>This teenager had used the strong wind generated from the fanning of his eyelashes to dispel his sword art!</p>

    <p>He had just blinked his eyes and his eyelashes had created a gale strong enough to withstand Third Saint's "Art of the Three Swords"...</p>

    <p>What the hell! There was a technique like this?!</p>

    <p>Third Saint's three views were dealt a blow so heavy they collapsed. Two thousand years of cultivation, and it had all been for fucking nothing!</p>

    <p>Worse still, Third Saint was stunned to find that he couldn't use his sword art to defend against the wind that had been stirred up by this teenager's eyelashes. That invisible wave was gradually pushing the silver sword qi back to rebound on him. The moment he was prepared to withdraw his sword, it was already too late! This silver sword qi, forced to change direction by the powerful, invisible wave created by the teenager's eyelashes, turned back on him!</p>

    <p>This backlash of power was unexpectedly even fiercer than the sword qi he had released!</p>

    <p>Third Saint didn't have time to react at all. His face turned pale and the terror in his heart was at its peak... who the hell was this teenager?!</p>

    <p>Fortunately, he was able to react valiantly as he used his strength to break his right hand, which had been holding the sword. At the cost of an arm, this unstoppable power changed direction and shot upward to scatter the bank of clouds above them until there wasn't a wisp of a cloud left in the sky!</p>

    <p>Still standing in the same spot, Wang Ling straightened his creased school uniform, which had been ruffled by the sword qi. The old Taoist in white thought he was going to attack again, and fearfully retreated tens of meters away...</p>

    <p>A few seconds later, he coughed up a mouthful of blood, staining his clothes.</p>

    <p>Although he had managed to change the direction of the attack, the aftershock had still caused him an internal backlash injury! Fortunately, thanks to his prompt reaction, it was only second-degree backlash this time, which wasn't too serious.</p>

    <p>At that moment, fear still lingered in the old Taoist's heart — a wave created by fanning eyelashes had actually produced such astounding results! If he hadn't reacted with such godly speed, he would have already gone to meet elder brother and second brother!</p>

    <p>"To wipe out enemies with a blink of an eye..." The old Taoist's face grew pale with fright.</p>

    <p>This teenager had a far higher realm than the Ten Saints.</p>

    <p>Even if they had another hundred Soul Formation cultivators, they still weren't necessarily this person's match!</p>

    <p>Recalling the violent wave produced by the teenager's blinking, the old Taoist in white felt that there was something familiar about this technique.</p>

    <p>Legend said that the person ranked number one on the international list of killers, Killer Taoist, nicknamed Teacher Killer, had mastered this supreme skill of eliminating enemies with one blink!</p>

    <p>Could it be... was this that Senior Killer Taoist? But why was this senior wearing a school uniform? Was his hobby cosplaying?</p>

    <p>Oh god! This great senior was his idol!</p>

    <p>Clutching at his broken arm and covered in blood, this old Taoist in white stared at Wang Ling and asked somewhat bashfully, "Are you... Senior Killer Taoist? Can I get your autograph?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..." <em>Didn't you fucking come here for revenge?!</em></p>
