  <h1>Chapter 980 Big Bowl Thick Noodle</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Visual China...</p>

    <p>This was a rogue company which downloaded online pictures and charged random copyright fees for their use. Many people who had unwittingly used these online pictures were then visited by company staff demanding copyright royalties. The crucial point was that the company wouldn't allow them to just delete the pictures but insisted on compensation, otherwise the company would file a lawsuit.</p>

    <p>If it was a rich company, Visual China would send a lawyer's letter right away; if not, they would send it a few years later after the company had grown.</p>

    <p>The most mysterious thing was how this company which relied on image copyright lawsuits to survive could even become freaking listed...</p>

    <p>There was a saying going around online: <em>All of China suffers because of Visual China.</em></p>

    <p>Respecting copyright was a good thing to begin with, but it wasn't right to fool around illegally under the pretext of protecting it.</p>

    <p>It was clear that Visual China had no self-awareness, and were now actually gunning for Bai Youquan.</p>

    <p>Winding up the window, Bai Youquan completely ignored the young man on the motorbike outside.</p>

    <p>After all, the most painful thing in the world was dealing with hoodlums.</p>

    <p>A bunch of gangsters were nothing to be scared of - what was frightening was if they were educated!</p>

    <p>"You're ignoring him?" It didn't seem like Bai Youquan's personality to keep his peace.</p>

    <p>Although Fang Xing hadn't known Bai Youquan for long, he already knew how to label the other party.</p>

    <p>Without a doubt, this was the most dangerous person, who could be called the smiling villain.</p>

    <p>After winding up the window, Bai Youquan looked at the time. "Hm, there are three seconds left. Three, two, one..."</p>

    <p>"Bang!"</p>

    <p>At the end of Bai Youquan's countdown, Fang Xing suddenly heard a deafening sound outside the window, and all the vehicles on the overpass could feel the tremors.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Bai Youquan turned on the traffic radio broadcast.</p>

    <p>Several minutes later, there was a news broadcast on the radio: "Dear citizens, the following is breaking news. According to the latest report, there was an explosion at the Visual China building five minutes ago, the cause of which is unknown. The building has now been reduced to ash, and the exact cause is still being investigated."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing was dumbstruck. "Isn't this too..."</p>

    <p>"This is how our organization does things. It's best for Classmate Fang to get used to it as soon as possible." Bai Youquan gave a devilish smile. "Now, we are already on the same side."</p>

    <p>"You really have guts to dare provoke everyone."</p>

    <p>"Everyone except for iKun; there are too many of them and we can't get rid of them all in a short period of time."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"But we've already started spreading the word online, and we believe that Huaxiu Alliance will respond to it."</p>

    <p>"Why would Huaxiu Alliance listen to you?" Fang Xing was startled.</p>

    <p>"Do you know what iKun stands for?"</p>

    <p>"???"</p>

    <p>"iKun is [I] Want to [Kill] the [United] [Nations]. They want to bring down the alliance of nations. Doesn't this point to Huaxiu Alliance?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"We've spread the news online. Hehehe, I believe it won't be long before iKun crumbles." Bai Youquan smiled evilly.</p>

    <p>He stroked and fiddled with the plain, pitch black cremation urn in his hands; it seemed that he really did have a fixation with True Immortal She Pi.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing took a deep breath and felt that Bai Youquan was a little scary.</p>

    <p>What was even more frightening was that he didn't know who on earth was the person behind the aggressive President Bai this time.</p>

    <p>He was now under close watch by Bai Youquan without the slightest chance of escape.</p>

    <p>Could Wang Ling sense the danger this time...</p>

    <p>Fang Xing was worried.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Fang, now that you've offered your first gift to the organization, do you want to meet our leader?" Bai Youquan asked as he fiddled with the cremation urn.</p>

    <p>"Your father?" asked Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>"No... it's the man behind the scenes, and someone you would definitely never expect," answered Bai Youquan.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Ling, Wang Ming and Guo Ping were still waiting in the noodle shop for Fang Xing to come back.</p>

    <p>"It's been almost two hours since Student Fang went out to buy ingredients, and he's still not back?" Guo Ping frowned and felt that the situation wasn't so simple.</p>

    <p>"Let's listen to some music first; there might be a jam on the road," said Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>He played Irascible Dharmaraja's latest single <em>Big Bowl Thick Noodle </em>, which was released today and became a hot search in a short period of time, catching the attention of tens of millions of people.</p>

    <p>Irascible Dharmaraja was making fun of himself in this song.</p>

    <p>He had been constantly derided previously for being a terrible singer, but the release of this song demonstrated how much more capable his PR team was behind the scenes compared with some other singers.</p>

    <p><em>Big Bowl Thick Noodle </em>actually sounded pretty good, but Guo Ping wasn't in the mood to calm down and listen to it.</p>

    <p>Since Fang Xing was taking so long to come back, Guo Ping had a bad feeling. "Has something happened?"</p>

    <p>When Guo Ping said that, Wang Ling used the Great Deduction Spell to infer the direction Fang Xing was in, only to find that the latter's string of fate was calm and composed, and there was nothing unusual about it at all; if Fang Xing had encountered any sort of danger, it should be fluctuating wildly like a great wave.</p>

    <p>Putting his finger down, Wang Ling drank the noodle shop's barley tea, which was still very fragrant.</p>

    <p>The barley tea was made in-house in the Fang family's noodle shop, and a new batch was made every day. To welcome them as they came over to discuss matters, Fang Xing had gotten up very early today; it wasn't likely he would use the excuse of going to the market to buy ingredients to leave them hanging.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that something was wrong, but he couldn't place his finger on it.</p>

    <p>It just vaguely felt a little strange.</p>

    <p>He suddenly felt as if something was in his way.</p>

    <p>Or in other words, he was being obstructed.</p>

    <p>After another half an hour, Guo Ping couldn't wait any longer; the truth was that he was worried about Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing might not be familiar with Guo Ping, but Guo Ping was very familiar with him.</p>

    <p>The truth was that Guo Ping had watched Fang Xing grow up from the shadows. Back then when True Immortal She Pi bore an egg, it was in fact Guo Ping who had safely hatched Fang Xing using the equipment they had on hand.</p>

    <p>Guo Ping was one of those who had witnessed Fang Xing breaking through the shell.</p>

    <p>They had already been connected since a long time ago.</p>

    <p>It was just that Fang Xing himself wasn't aware of it.</p>

    <p>"Everyone wait a minute." Guo Ping took out his phone and sent inquiries to some of his friends in the city police.</p>

    <p>Whether it was a traffic accident or some other situation, the cultivation police station would put them all on file. If there really was some sort of accident, Guo Ping's friends at the police station would at least be able to send back some information.</p>

    <p>Guo Ping texted several people, and even asked the head of cultivation public safety. Even after using the computers at HQ to do checks under the table, they didn't find any leads.</p>

    <p>"How is it?" asked Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>"No news..." Guo Ping frowned.</p>

    <p>"Let me try," Wang Ling said telepathically at that moment.</p>

    <p>He sent a message to the Number 60 Squad's side chat group: "Has anyone seen Fang Xing?"</p>

    <p>"Fang Xing? I don't know. Are you looking for him?" Chen Chao replied in a second. Wang Ling knew with one glance that this guy was playing games.</p>

    <p>"Mm..." Wang Ling replied.</p>

    <p>"He hasn't contacted us and we don't know where he is. I think it's very likely that he's been kidnapped!" Chen Chao sent an evil smile emoji.</p>
