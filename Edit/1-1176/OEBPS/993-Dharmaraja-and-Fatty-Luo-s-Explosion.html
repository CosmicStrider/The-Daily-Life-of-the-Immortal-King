  <h1>Chapter 993 Dharmaraja and Luo Chuang's Explosion</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Oh, I was busted after all." Chatterbox Wang Ling got up slowly, and an unprecedented aura burst forth from his eyes, which ultimately turned into a dark black shadow that enveloped them.</p>

    <p>"What dense resentful energy..." Lightning Dharmaraja and the others were alarmed. Everyone knew that the real Ling Zhenren was very Buddha-like: this was a youngster with good values who loved learning and was committed to world peace, who stood aloof from worldly affairs in his daily life. Politics, beauty, money - everything was far less important than a packet of crispy noodle snacks.</p>

    <p>And that was exactly why everyone admired Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>Who could have the same simple and unaffected air of the real Ling Zhenren? Each of them longed for it with envy, but fell far short.</p>

    <p>This was the realm of a master - only the strong who stood on top of the world could achieve this.</p>

    <p>"With Fang Xing and I working together, you have no chance of winning." Chatterbox Wang Ling smiled darkly.</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Zhuo Yi trembled. "Senior Immortal, even if this <em>shifu </em>is fake, he seems to be very strong. Can we really win?"</p>

    <p>"We won't know until we try!" Lord Diulei's eyes were firm.</p>

    <p>To him, his Brother Ling had always been an insurmountable mountain.</p>

    <p>But that referred to the real Brother Ling!</p>

    <p>That was the only Brother Ling he accepted!</p>

    <p>That invulnerable Brother Ling absolutely wasn't the imposter in front of him!</p>

    <p>Since this was an imposter, the odds were 100% in their favor!</p>

    <p>Thinking this, Lord Diulei couldn't help raising one finger in front of everyone — even if their chances were slim, they still had a 1% chance of victory because this was an imposter!</p>

    <p>When Lord Diulei raised this finger, in that moment, everyone's reactions were different.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was shaken. "As expected of Senior Immortal! He can actually come up with this sort of idea so quickly. Could it be that he wants me to retreat upward and activate the sect's defense alarm system outside to seal off this area? That should be it... After all, I'm the weakest one here, and <em>shifu </em>isn't around. I can only offer support, otherwise as soon as the battle begins, I'll immediately become cannon fodder! Senior Immortal is amazing, his battle strategy is actually so clear..."</p>

    <p>Lightning Dharmaraja was shaken. "As expected of Senior Immortal! He can actually come up with this sort of idea so quickly. Could it be that he wants me to use the lightning power of my holy relic to summon the Ancient Thunderbolt to help in battle? That should be it... After all, basically the only thing I can do here is to summon the thunderbolt... Under my Ancient Thunderbolt, this fake Ling Zhenren might reveal some hidden weakness! Senior Immortal is amazing, his battle strategy is actually so clear..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya was shaken. "As expected of Senior Immortal! He can actually come up with this sort of idea so quickly. Could it be that he wants me to throw up my gourd and summon a small world to cover this place to prevent the battle from affecting the sect's conference room as well as limit the movements of these two impostors..."</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao was shaken. "As expected of Senior Immortal!... Could it be that he wants me to fly out and summon Jingke to control me... As long as we combine into Jingbai again, the strength of this imposter will no longer have an effect on me..."</p>

    <p>In that instant when Lord Diulei raised one finger, every group leader of the Office of Strategic Deception promptly made up their minds.</p>

    <p>So, in the next moment, everyone's auras exploded in the conference hall and powerful fluctuations of spiritual qi were released!</p>

    <p>Everyone moved in sync. As if they had trained for this before, they carried out their respective tasks, doing what they could to the best of their abilities.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "???"</p>

    <p>He had just raised one finger to boost morale - god only knew what this group of people was thinking...</p>

    <p>Even Wang Ling and Fang Xing on the other side were shocked by the scene in front of them. These experts who sat at the top of the Office of Strategic Deception moved as one; this sort of cooperation in a fight was rare.</p>

    <p>"They're a tough bunch, as expected." Female Fang Xing sneered and waved her hand. A sickle appeared in her hand, and she directly raised it to slash at Zhuo Yi in the air.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was the weakest person at the scene, so she had already thought of defeating them one by one as a counterattack.</p>

    <p>Terrifying blade qi whirled with boundless spirit power and turned into a crescent which reeked of bloodlust as it lunged forth. Finally, this crescent curved, like a blood snake twisting wildly in the air, and it shattered everything in its wake with its tremendous might.</p>

    <p>"Not good!" On his way out in flight, Zhuo Yi was seized by dread.</p>

    <p>The sect's defensive barrier had been personally set up by his real <em>shifu </em>Wang Ling. Once it was activated, these two imposters would have no chance of escaping.</p>

    <p>"Brother Zhuo Yi, do all you can to break out! Leave the rest to us!" Lightning Dharmaraja shouted.</p>

    <p>He had already spat out the Thunder clan's holy relic, which had been passed down from ancient times — the Holy Thunder Pill!</p>

    <p>This Holy Thunder Pill had always been in Dharmaraja's throat. Once he took it out, thick black clouds suddenly covered the sky above the Office of Strategic Deception! They had a terrifying weight to them, and the pressure was so heavy it was as if it could fall and bury everyone at any moment!</p>

    <p>Lightning flashed in the clouds and poured down like a waterfall!</p>

    <p>Lightning Dharmaraja himself might not have a high realm, but the power of this Holy Thunder Pill could instantly make him as strong as a True Immortal! This state didn't last very long, however, and also had very severe side effects, because given Dharmaraja's own strength, he had yet to fully inherit the tremendous power of the Holy Thunder Pill's Ancient Thunderbolt.</p>

    <p>The particularity of the Thunder clan's Ancient Thunderbolt lay in its indiscriminate strikes: once it took shape, even the owner of the Holy Thunder Pill would suffer from this lightning waterfall.</p>

    <p>Thus, descendants of the Thunder clan had to cultivate the unique Escape Thunder Art since childhood.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, Dharmaraja had currently only cultivated up to the sixth level of the Escape Thunder Art, which consisted of twelve levels. If lightning fell, it wouldn't kill him, but Dharmaraja would have intermittent memory loss for a short period of time and become a simpleton without any fighting strength at all; it would take some time for him to recover and return to normal.</p>

    <p>Thus, summoning the Holy Thunder Pill was a huge risk for Dharmaraja, but currently there was no other way.</p>

    <p>Next to Dharmaraja, Luo Chuang lent him assistance. He fished a rod out of his big underpants and stuck it in the ground. This was the legendary "Weather Rod," a magic artifact which Luo Chuang had invented. It could be adjusted to thunderbolt mode when necessary to increase the thunderbolt's might!</p>

    <p>It had to be said that Dharmaraja and Luo Chuang these two heavyweights were in perfect accord at that moment!</p>

    <p><em>Boom!</em></p>

    <p>A thunderbolt about the width of a bucket fell from the sky and smashed apart female Fang Xing's dangerous slash.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi grit his teeth and seized the opportunity to escape.</p>

    <p>But he was well aware that this fight had only just begun.</p>
