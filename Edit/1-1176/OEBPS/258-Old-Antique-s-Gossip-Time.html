  <h1>Chapter 258 Lao Gudong's Gossip Time </h1>

  <div>

    <p>If suppressing Clan Leader Yu and catching Lao Gudong's piece of chalk hadn't been enough for the transfer student to cause a stir, then by eating Mother Juan's "sky steamed godly snails," Fang Xing could be said to have already cemented his status as the strongest transfer student in Number 60 High School's history.</p>

    <p>The "sky steamed godly snails" was a new dish which Mother Juan had developed along with the "fan bing bing." According to what Guo Hao knew, when the sky steamed godly snails had been taken out of the pot, all the fresh ingredients in the canteen had been charred in an instant just from the steam that had been released.</p>

    <p>According to Mother Juan, this was the dish's unique characteristic, like that of the gourmet "snail rice noodles <sup>1</sup> ." To put it simply, this was the legendary "stinks but tastes delicious." Although you'd definitely get diarrhea after eating it, it helped the body to detox as well as nourished the skin. It was said to work better than drinking copious amounts of fluid, and could instantly dissolve impurities in the body.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This specialty of Liuzhou city
is rice noodles in broth made
from a stock base of river
snails and pork bones.)</dfn>

    <p>Of course, these were all one-sided claims on Mother Juan's part. Since Guo Hao eating "fan bing bing" had already set a precedent, there was no one in school who dared to risk eating her new dishes.</p>

    <p>But credit had to be given where it was due. Guo Hao had been admitted into hospital after eating Mother Juan's fan bing bing. After his discharge, however, he could feel that his body's resilience had increased quite a bit; even the veins in his body were now obviously unclogged... maybe this was the legendary "breaking the old to create the new."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao silently bottled this matter up in his heart and didn't mention it to anyone.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>All in all, as a new student, the impact which Fang Xing had created in a single short day wasn't any less than Sun Rong's influence when she had entered Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>Tianshi Imperial High School was like the Oscar of aristocratic high schools in Jinghua city, and the people who could enter the school were all the wealthy and respectable type. However, there were very few people who knew anything about Tianshi Imperial High School. If it wasn't for Guo Hao's uncles, who were spread all over the world, no one might have even heard of its name.</p>

    <p>In the short ten minutes after the end of the class, Guo Hao had shared all the gossip on the new transfer student with everyone. Before the start of the second class, Sun Rong and Lin Xiaoyu, who had been sent to scout out the new transfer student, came back hand in hand.</p>

    <p>It was actually quite normal for girls to hold hands with each other, like when they would go to the washroom after class hand in hand. However, the main point here was that Sun Rong and Lin Xiaoyu were skipping as they came back hand in hand!</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>This scene stunned all the people in Class Three.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao was utterly dumbstruck. It was quite normal for Lin Xiaoyu this lively fujoshi to skip, but why had Sun Rong ended up following her?!</p>

    <p>What happened just now?</p>

    <p>"Classmate Fang Xing is really too cool! Right? Right?" Lin Xiaoyu held her face in her hands, a fangirl expression on her face, and nudged Sun Rong repeatedly with her elbow.</p>

    <p>"In what way? What's his strength like?" Chen Chao was also a little curious.</p>

    <p>"I think he's pretty amazing..." Sun Rong looked a little bashful.</p>

    <p>Lin Xiaoyu thought about it for a bit, then very quickly rattled off the four key fujoshi points: "White face! Long legs! Chopstick spirit <sup>2</sup> ! The ultimate shou !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This means that a person's legs are very long.)</dfn>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>"As for strength... he's so handsome, what use is strength?!"</p>

    <p>After saying this, Lin Xiaoyu seemed to abruptly recall something important, and suddenly exclaimed, "— Ah!"</p>

    <p>"What is it?"</p>

    <p>Her face felt very hot. "I forgot to take a selfie with him just now!"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Lin Xiaoyu: "Classmate Sun Rong, come with me!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>Saying this, Lin Xiaoyu grabbed Sun Rong's hand and eagerly ran out again.</p>

    <p>The scene at this moment made Guo Hao cross his arms and sigh despite himself: Over... it's all over!</p>

    <p>It wasn't just Guo Hao; no one else had expected that even Classmate Sun Rong would have fallen for the transfer student!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Although Number 60 High School took in two relatively well-off transfer students at this time every year, Fang Xing was the first to create such a stir.</p>

    <p>His appearance had been a little sudden for everyone.</p>

    <p>He was like a dazzling jewel that had changed hands and which glowed brightly after coming to Number 60 High School, partly helping to draw a lot of attention away from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling had a hunch that this person was dangerous.</p>

    <p>Looking through the walls into Grade One, Class Two on the other side, he found Fang Xing surrounded by a crowd.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing looked like a very sunny person. Because his school uniform was still being made, he was wearing a white T-shirt and a pair of blue and white striped track pants. His white teeth gleamed as he chatted with the people around him.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't observe him for too long as he instantly withdrew after just one look. And it might have been his own mistaken impression, but as he withdrew his gaze, it seemed as if Fang Xing had tilted his head slightly to look behind him out of the corner of his eye.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong's class happened to be on Wednesdays.</p>

    <p>As a follow-up to the live broadcast of the old devil's trial in the morning, Lao Gudong shared related knowledge from modern history in class, then directly announced that the trial would be an important test point in the mid-term exam.</p>

    <p>"I just received a circular from the Education Department stating that the live broadcast of the trial this morning will be included in the textbook in the second half of this year, earliest before the new year. It's possible that it will become a key exam point in the next two years." Lao Gudong rested his elbows partly on the lectern and said unhurriedly, "Students who have decided to take history in Grade Three should take particular note of this."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"From major things like the specific time and proceedings of this unprecedented live broadcast of the trial of a top-ranked criminal, as well as the possible impact on later generations, to minor things like the old devil and General Yi's historically famous skills — all these are test points," said Lao Gudong.</p>

    <p>"Teacher... even these can be tested?" asked someone.</p>

    <p>"Why not?" Lao Gudong smiled slightly. "If it were me, I would test you on the Palm Sword's origin, the specific research process involved, and the historical impact of this skill on the history of swordsmanship. Each person has their own specialty skill, and there are countless examples of them in history: Immortal Zhenyuan's Zhenyuan Great Spell, Killer Taoist's Enemy-Killing Blink and so on..."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>"Of course, when it comes to test points, I think it's very likely that Devil Emperor Gua Pi's disciple, Immortal She Pi, will appear in the exam as a test point." Lao Gudong looked around calmly. "So, does anyone know the origin of Immortal She Pi's specialty, the White Night Spell?"</p>

    <p>"What's that?"</p>

    <p>"Perhaps many of you have not heard of it, but the White Night Spell is a technique that is able to turn the spirit energy of heaven and earth into armor. As long as there's spirit energy, the armor won't be destroyed. Furthermore, there are two types for day and night each. One is called Bright Victory, and the other is Dark Victory <sup>3</sup> ," said Lao Gudong.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>('Bright Victory' or Ming Kai
is the name of a
professional League of
Legends player, who is
sometimes called 'Dark
Victory' for what some
people have criticized as his
two-sided playstyle,
depending on the stakes he's playing for..)</dfn>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>
