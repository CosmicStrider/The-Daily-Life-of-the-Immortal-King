  <h1>Chapter 721 Unity, Is Strength...</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After meeting Li Mingyao, Wang Ling realized he had completely become famous, and had probably been noticed by some of the big families in Songhai.</p>

    <p>The four big families of Songhai whom Li Mingyao had mentioned were a typical example. To be able to draw the attention of the four big families was enough to prove how serious the issue was.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, Wang Ling himself was not stupid and had already been on guard earlier on.</p>

    <p>With the upgraded version of the Great Shielding Spell, it was almost impossible to investigate him, but Wang Ling was starting to feel a little worried. Previously, the Demon Hunters Association hadn't been able to track him down, and so had started to attack the people around him, making trouble for almost all the people who were close to him.</p>

    <p>Had this Night Chief, far abroad, truly come up with a revenge plan this time that was aimed specifically at him?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought that this matter was far more complicated than it seemed...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Approximately half an hour after lunch, the Rainbow Glass Box piloted by Wu Zhenjun was about to arrive at the secure base station in the central zone of Beast King's Remains.</p>

    <p>Before the box landed, all the students received an item — a custom-made smart watch.</p>

    <p>Previously, all the electronic gadgets which the students had been carrying were confiscated, but after taking various factors into account, Huaxiu Alliance had gotten customized smart watches specially made that could be used inside Beast King's Remains. A signal tower had also been temporarily set up inside the Rainbow Glass Box and it covered more than half of Beast King's Remains.</p>

    <p>The watch didn't have a camera function, but it could be used to set up chat groups and discussion groups to make it easier for students from different schools to get to know each other.</p>

    <p>Of course, the most important thing was that these watches were also a safeguard.</p>

    <p>Each watch contained a "one click for help" app. A soft tap on it was the same as firing a virtual signal flare, and the Rainbow Glass Box would immediately receive information on the student's location in the remains.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling received the watch like everyone else, a chat group had already been set up.</p>

    <p>This was the entire group going on this Beast King's Remains summer camp, with over a thousand members...</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, the watch had a smart ID function, so everyone would join the group with their real names. As long as a student put on the watch, they would automatically be added to the group, and the software would automatically change their name after identifying who they were.</p>

    <p>As a result, Wang Ling barely entered the group before the messages directly exploded.</p>

    <p>"Oh my god! Wang Ling? Which Wang Ling? It can't be that recent Fortune Emperor, can it?"</p>

    <p>"What?! Wang Ling's in the group? Excuse me, Classmate Wang Ling, which dorm are you in? Can I go and get your autograph?!"</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling, please take a photo with me!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>The upgraded Great Shielding Spell screened those people who deliberately asked for information on him, and worked in a similar way in an online environment... However, Wang Ling never expected that there would actually be so many people paying attention to him after the incident with President Bai!!!</p>

    <p>Fortunately, however, the upgraded Great Shielding Spell was very clearly in effect.</p>

    <p>Although a group of people were asking for information on Wang Ling, no one could answer them.</p>

    <p>Students from the other high schools couldn't help feeling moved — Number 60 High, was really united!</p>

    <p>So many people actually kept their mouths shut and no one was willing to reveal anything about Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>In fact, everyone could understand. After all, they were asking for personal information on a student. Number 60 High might have reminded its students before this that Wang Ling was still at the center of things, and if this wasn't kept under control, it would really affect his life.</p>

    <p>However, the teachers and students from other high schools never expected Number 60 High as a key city high school candidate to be united to this extent... It wasn't just the teachers who said nothing, but the students were also unwilling to reveal any information on Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>What kind of spirit of unity was this?</p>

    <p>For a moment, a lot of students and teachers from other schools couldn't help staring at the screen and sighing with feeling.</p>

    <p>In the past few months, it was Number 60 High who had been in the news the most in Songhai city. Assassins had mounted a sneak attack on them, the millennium-old Devil Emperor had upset their military training, and a spirit beast trafficking ring had targeted them in revenge... In the end, Number 60 High had dealt with them one by one.</p>

    <p>So, was this the power of unity...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In his room, Li Mingyao, who had looked for Wang Ling and asked the person himself for information on him, was also lost in deep thought for a long while.</p>

    <p>There were two people to a dorm, and the person rooming with Li Mingyao was Zhou Youzheng, the third young master of the Zhou family, one of the four big families of Songhai city.</p>

    <p>In some sense, Li Mingyao and Zhou Youzheng were birds of a feather. First of all, both of them were the third young master in their families, and they were both studying at Remnant High.</p>

    <p>Moreover, there was hardly any difference in their realms and strength, plus they were competing with the other young masters in their families for power.</p>

    <p>Therefore, both of them were in great need of "fortune"...</p>

    <p>If they wanted to use another method to win their families' Young Master Succession Ceremony after graduating from high school in addition to cultivating even more vigorously, the best way was still to find someone with very good fortune and become their friend.</p>

    <p>Both of them had had their eye on Wang Ling at the same time after the incident with President Bai, and they had come up with an all-inclusive plan to "lure Wang Ling" in with their proposal.</p>

    <p>The news reports had said that Wang Ling was only at the middle Foundation Establishment stage, so their enticement plan had been tailored accordingly. Even a late Foundation Establishment cultivator or a Golden Core cultivator wouldn't have been able to refuse it, let alone a cultivator at the middle Foundation Establishment stage... The benefits and treatment they had offered were several levels higher than what could typically be found on the market.</p>

    <p>After seeing how tight-lipped Number 60 High was in the chat group, Zhou Youzheng and Li Mingyao were silent for a long time.</p>

    <p>After a while, Li Mingyao spoke first. "I didn't expect the whole of Number 60 High to be so united... I met a teacher and a student from Number 60 High in the canteen earlier. They clearly know who Wang Ling is, but they refused to tell me anything."</p>

    <p>"Hm... I wonder if we should be more low-key?" said Zhou Youzheng.</p>

    <p>"Low-key? What do you mean?"</p>

    <p>"Think about it - doesn't it seem a little too bombastic to announce that we're of the four big families off the bat? Instead, people might dislike us for it."</p>

    <p>Zhou Youzheng gave his unhurried analysis. "So I think we should move them sincerely and be quiet about our wealth."</p>

    <p>Li Mingyao: "Brother Zhou's meaning is..."</p>

    <p>"I don't think we've made our position in relation to Wang Ling very clear. If we want to ask Number 60 High for information on Wang Ling, we shouldn't reveal our identities as young masters... That's too high-profile."</p>

    <p>Zhou Youzheng: "So, we might as well just directly say in the group that we're Wang Ling's underlings! Maybe this way, we might be able to directly draw Classmate Wang Ling out!"</p>

    <p>Li Mingyao: "..."</p>
