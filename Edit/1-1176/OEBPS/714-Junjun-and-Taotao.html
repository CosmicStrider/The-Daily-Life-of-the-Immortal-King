  <h1>Chapter 714 Junjun and Taotao</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Thus, under the strange looks from the surrounding special duty personnel, Zhuo Yi put his belt back on with a flushed face.</p>

    <p>Whatever...</p>

    <p>Anyway, since the moment he took office, the outside world had actually never stopped criticizing him; a few more people misunderstanding him wouldn't make a difference.</p>

    <p>Besides, what was wrong with being a little "perverted" as a man...</p>

    <p>If you wanted to get along in the world, a thick skin would always be the number one essential rule of survival.</p>

    <p>"Is there anything else you want to say?" Zhuo Yi looked at the detained Myriad Faces Old Man.</p>

    <p>Myriad Faces Old Man in fact wasn't a strong fighter, but he had been able to evade the law time and time again because of his abnormal transfiguration technique. His ability had reached the height of perfection, and Zhuo Yi's perspective had already been completely broadened just now. To complete a transfiguration in a flash wasn't something just anyone could do.</p>

    <p>Suppressed by the six Nascent Soul special duty personnel, Myriad Faces Old Man never thought he would actually suffer a setback here. Staring at Zhuo Yi, he snorted coldly. "I'm not the only expert whom the Dark Network called upon this time. You better watch out."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was surprised. So it turned out that Myriad Faces Old Man wasn't the only one to come offer themselves up!</p>

    <p>But from the intelligence which they had gathered previously, it was indeed possible that they had overlooked information on members of the Dark Network.</p>

    <p>"Do you need me to arrange an interrogation?" a special duty personnel asked.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi nodded. "Mm, take him back right away for interrogation. Contact Warden Liang for the rest. If there are any updates, he'll contact me directly."</p>

    <p>"Understood, Director Zhuo!" Standing respectfully, the special duty personnel saluted Zhuo Yi, and then took the captured Myriad Faces Old Man to the prisoner transport car on the roadside.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was guessing that Myriad Faces Old Man probably wouldn't spill the beans so easily.</p>

    <p>Not only were these members of the Dark Network unregistered vagrant cultivators, the vast majority of them had criminal records and wouldn't confess to their crimes so easily.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi knew that in recent years, the state had been planning to invest heavily in cracking down on the Dark Network, but it was when they actually tried to put it into practice that they often realized how difficult and complicated it was to carry out.</p>

    <p>The unregistered vagrant cultivators of this underground Dark Network were quite different from the members of dark forces. The dark forces were at least organized, but these vagrant cultivators were all self-employed; they might be hired by the same force, but there was nothing to tie them together.</p>

    <p>This was also a huge reason why the underground Dark Network had always been difficult to breach.</p>

    <p>When Secretary Dakang had previously learned that Night Chief's Second President Dylan was disguised as the vaccine company's President Han Di, he had already warned Zhuo Yi to be vigilant, and so clues had been dug out which led back to Myriad Faces Old Man.</p>

    <p>But Zhuo Yi never thought that apart from Myriad Faces Old Man, there would actually be someone else in the medical team in addition to President Dylan...</p>

    <p>This was an unknown variable.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi felt that it was vital for him to inform the people inside.</p>

    <p>However, upon entering Beast King's Remains, all communication signals were completely cut off due to the distance across space.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi had no way of contacting the people inside.</p>

    <p>"No choice." Zhuo Yi sighed. As matters stood, he only had one option now.</p>

    <p>He had to go in himself.</p>

    <p>Whether or not Myriad Faces Old Man finally told them who the other person lurking in the medical team was... As a scapegoat, if something really happened inside, he should be by <em>shifu's </em> side at the very least, ready to carry that wok at any time!</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi didn't think he and Wang Ling were Junjun and Taotao <sup>1</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Refers to comedian Zhou Libo
and his acquaintance Yan Jun.
Yan Jun presumably had been
willing to take the fall for
something Zhou Libo did, but
seemed to change his mind
later ..)</dfn>

    <p>He was a competent disciple!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, at Lord Diulei's luxurious villa residence in Wenxian Garden.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin and Wuji were anxiously waiting for news. When Beast King's Remains had opened earlier, they had almost instantly felt the fluctuations of heaven and earth.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin had holy beast blood, while Wuji had been made from the skins of holy beasts. When Beast King's Remains opened, the two of them had clearly felt the unusual natural phenomena that was faintly transmitted over.</p>

    <p>As the last holy beast on Earth, Xiao Yin felt that he should explore Beast King's Remains himself.</p>

    <p>But he definitely couldn't directly appear in public. The main force this time had a lot of experts on them. If his true holy beast body was found out, the situation would be very hard to explain later.</p>

    <p>Given the overall situation, Xiao Yin had taken the initiative to call Little Master Zhuo Yi the day before Beast King's Remains opened!</p>

    <p>Based on the original plan, Zhuo Yi could have gone in with the main force, but with the addition of Xiao Yin, Zhuo Yi had to find a way to make another team.</p>

    <p>A few minutes later, Lord Diulei received a message from Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Inside the villa, Lord Diulei, who was managing the cultivation forum, called out, "Brother Xiao, the two of you can set off! Brother Zhuo is waiting for you at Peiyuan's public square."</p>

    <p>"Alright!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin got up excitedly. When he was about to leave with Wuji, he suddenly asked, "Thunder, are you really not coming?"</p>

    <p>"Brother To's still treating that girl in gray. He sent me a message earlier and said that he needs me to procure some medicine and bring it over to the island. Jin Shi and Yin Shi are helping him refine pills, and the island is a little understaffed." Lord Diulei sighed. He really wanted to go, but unfortunately, someone had to stay behind to help out.</p>

    <p>Prior to entering Beast King's Remains this time, Immortal Toya had actually been designated captain of the medical team, but for the sake of waking up the girl, he could only decline.</p>

    <p>The main reason was that everyone was very curious about that girl in gray that had come out of the kun's belly.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, this was the only lead they had which was the closest that had gotten so far to the mysterious angler.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi didn't have to wait long at Peiyuan's public square.</p>

    <p>A minute space crack appeared in the middle of the square. It then gradually split open like a lotus flower blossoming, and a silver-haired young man with a fair face and a long-haired girl wrapped in bandages stepped out of it.</p>

    <p>This Space Teleportation Spell was Wuji's ability.</p>

    <p>At that moment, it hadn't been more than five or six minutes since the Rainbow Glass Box had flown into the space vortex that was the entrance to the secret land of Beast King's Remains.</p>

    <p>Not long after Zhuo Yi contacted them, Wuji used her ability to bring Xiao Yin here.</p>

    <p>No one else saw this scene.</p>

    <p>Because the entrance to Beast King's Remains was a secret project of the state, nearby surveillance had all been shut down, and the surrounding roads had already been sealed off earlier with traffic control in effect, so no one saw Xiao Yin and Wuji appear.</p>

    <p>"Little Master!"</p>

    <p>As soon as Xiao Yin landed, he immediately greeted Zhuo Yi from a distance and skipped over.</p>

    <p>"Are we all here?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi looked at his watch. "There's one more person, he'll be here soon."</p>

    <p>Apart from the three of them, there was one more person in this special operations team which Zhuo Yi had set up on the side: Luo Chuang.</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang had been constantly thinking about the extinct resource "One Thousand Dried Bone" which could be found in Beast King's Remains.</p>

    <p>Now was the perfect opportunity for him to harvest the One Thousand Dried Bone.</p>

    <p>Of course, this harvesting job was in compliance with regulations, since Zhuo Yi had already applied with Secretary Dakang before Beast King's Remains opened.</p>

    <p>This One Thousand Dried Bone would be Zhuo Yi's bonus for this year.</p>

    <p>But Zhuo Yi didn't care about the year-end bonus at all.</p>

    <p>Money was just a worldly possession...</p>

    <p>In contrast, helping <em>shifu </em>to perfect Jingke's scabbard as quickly as possible was far more important than a year-end bonus!</p>
