  <h1>Chapter 514 Wang Ming's Great Ambition </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Of course, even though Wang Ming had said that, he was just teasing since he knew Wang Ling wouldn't do such a thing.</p>

    <p>Since young, this little brother of his had always had this ascetic and restrained expression, and didn't look like a vibrant youngster at all. As for why, this actually had to do with the primordial qi in his body.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming had extracted some of Wang Ling's primordial qi previously. This qi was immensely powerful; furthermore, it had a robust self-healing and purifying ability. In addition to purging the body of toxins and preventing all types of poisons from invading the system, it also had the effect of pacifying emotions.</p>

    <p>This was actually the reason why Wang Ling normally didn't show any emotion on his face.</p>

    <p>Many times when Wang Ling's mood was about to change, the primordial qi's self-cleansing ability would start to take effect. He would never get too excited, angry, sad or happy; the primordial qi would help control his mood.</p>

    <p>Scientifically speaking, those who could control their moods usually had higher EQ, lived longer and were healthier.</p>

    <p>But the problem was that the primordial qi was too strong, and its control was a little too excessive!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thus couldn't be blamed for his poker face!</p>

    <p>There were times when he wanted to grin but would be stifled by the primordial qi, which was actually a little depressing.</p>

    <p>Sometimes Wang Ming really wanted to know what Wang Ling's smile looked like.</p>

    <p>Although nowadays the corners of the lips could be adjusted with photoshop, a fake smile could never look natural...</p>

    <p>Over the years, Wang Ming had relied on the "Anti-Wang Ling Matter" which he had refined in order to create the talisman to suppress the primordial qi in Wang Ling's body. Meanwhile, he had actually been studying Wang Ling's primordial qi. In the end, using the "Anti-Wang Ling Matter" only treated the symptoms and not the cause. If they wanted a permanent solution, the best would be if Wang Ming achieved a breakthrough in his study of the primordial qi.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, even with him doing the research, he hadn't made any substantial progress until now.</p>

    <p>At that moment, he suddenly squeezed the pillow in his arms as his tone turned solemn. "Lingzi, I've been helping you study your primordial qi all these years, but given the current research equipment in the lab, none of the machines can thoroughly analyze your primordial qi."</p>

    <p>"Study primordial qi?" This was Er Ha's first time hearing this, and it shook its head after listening to Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>Because it really wasn't easy to study this thing!</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling heard this, his head jerked up and his entire body froze.</p>

    <p>He already knew about the primordial qi research; to be exact, he had been six years old when Wang Ming had extracted a sample for research.</p>

    <p>Actually, since the beginning, Wang Ling had already had the feeling that current scientific equipment wouldn't be able to analyze the primordial qi at all, and reality had indeed proven that this was the case. Over the years, Wang Ming had thrown a lot of energy into his research of the primordial qi, and would instantly text Wang Ling over even the smallest discovery.</p>

    <p>Later, there had been fewer and fewer texts until they had stopped altogether.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had always assumed that Wang Ming had already given up.</p>

    <p>After all, for a proud scientist regarded as the man with the strongest brain, it must have been a blow to this pride to be unable to achieve a breakthrough after working persistently on one project for so many years.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling hadn't thought that after ten years...</p>

    <p>Wang Ming actually hadn't given up.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling opened his mouth and was about to thank him, but then felt that it would be a little sappy and too aloof.</p>

    <p>They were cousins who sometimes hated or teased each other, but their bond of brotherhood was solid.</p>

    <p>The fact that Wang Ming could freely lie down and roll around on the bed was the best proof of this...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei had traded crispy noodle snacks for the right to lie down on the bed.</p>

    <p>But brothers were brothers. Even if Wang Ling didn't say it out loud, Wang Ming did hold a significant place in his heart.</p>

    <p>1st August was Wang Ming's birthday, and Wang Ling had to prepare a good gift for him.</p>

    <p>At that time, Wang Ling had already made a decision.</p>

    <p>Even though he didn't say anything, the truth was that Wang Ming didn't need him to give a reply.</p>

    <p>Words weren't needed between brothers.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was still underage and couldn't drink, otherwise Wang Ming thought that they could drink a truckload of wine together!</p>

    <p>One bottle would be his, and the rest would be Wang Ling's...</p>

    <p>"Primordial qi is a special type of spirit energy autonomously produced in little master's body. To put it another way, it's an even more advanced level of spirit energy which is tens of thousands of times denser than normal spirit energy, and has a truly complex composition..." said Er Ha.</p>

    <p>Er Ha actually only knew this much about primordial qi.</p>

    <p>This primordial qi was the main reason why Little Master Ling had been able to thrash Evil Sword God so badly with one slap.</p>

    <p>Spirit energy was like a cultivator's "power source."</p>

    <p>Normal cultivators operated on spirit energy.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling operated on a "primordial qi" spirit energy blend.</p>

    <p>It didn't sound like there was much of a difference since they were all power sources. However, there were differences in quality.</p>

    <p>Gasoline versus nuclear energy... could they be considered the same?!</p>

    <p>Furthermore, this "primordial qi" spirit energy blend had already been enough to defeat Evil Sword God; if the talisman had been removed and Wang Ling had used pure primordial qi in place of spirit power in his slap, Evil Sword God's soul and body would have been utterly extinguished.</p>

    <p>"Soon." Wang Ming flattened his lips, his expression taut as he said very seriously, "I can definitely do it... I'll invent a magic treasure for analyzing the primordial qi."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Actually, in Er Ha's view, the reason why Wang Ming's progress was slow was probably because he wasn't a cultivator.</p>

    <p>The spirit energy which Wang Ming was currently using was man-made spirit energy discharged by a magic treasure.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ming could read up on the theory behind spirit energy circulatory pathways and vascular systems, he wasn't a genuine cultivator. There were many things you could only understand after your body had experienced them for itself. Primordial qi was clearly a higher grade of power than spirit energy, and could be called a magic power source for cultivators.</p>

    <p>In the last few years, the "Depletion of Spirit Energy Theory" had become prevalent, and there were already plenty of True Immortal Almightys predicting that the spirit energy on earth would be depleted one day.</p>

    <p>Perhaps at that time, the primordial qi in Wang Ling's body would become the last power source for activating spells...</p>

    <p>This research study was actually very significant.</p>

    <p>If Wang Ming could analyze the composition of the primordial qi, he would be saving not just Wang Ling, but also the whole world. This would become a major discovery that would be permanently recorded down in The Annals of World Cultivation! Wang Ming would be forever remembered as the greatest discoverer, explorer and scientist of this era!</p>

    <p>A wild notion suddenly struck Er Ha.</p>

    <p>When the time came and Wang Ming passed away, it would be a spectacular scene.</p>

    <p>Those who both knew and didn't know him would light a candle for him on Weibo or in WeChat Moments...</p>
