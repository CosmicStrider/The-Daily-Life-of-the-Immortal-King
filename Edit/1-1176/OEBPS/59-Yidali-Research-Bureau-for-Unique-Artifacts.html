  <h1>Chapter 59 Yidali Research Bureau for Unique Artifacts </h1>

  <div>

      <p>Huaxiu nation's Yidali <sup>1</sup> Research Bureau for Unique Artifacts.</p>

      <dfn><sup>1</sup>(We mentioned this pun before in chapter 14, where Yidali 意大利 is the Chinese transliteration for Italy. Here, however, 'Yi' used in the research institute's name 意大利 means 'wow' or surprise.)</dfn>

      <p>This was a renowned place in Huaxiu nation that specialized in studying unique magic artifacts. The head of the institute was a cultivation ammunitions expert from Mi nation called Billy, nicknamed King Billy.</p>

      <p>The team led by King Billy had been riding high on the results of their research in the last few years as they made significant breakthroughs in scientific theory as well as technological research, surpassing all other unique artifacts research departments.</p>

      <p>Though the name "Yidali Research Bureau for Unique Artifacts" had been registered for a very long time, it had only started to make its mark in the last two years.</p>

      <p>All the magic artifacts researched by King Billy's team possessed three characteristics that could be summed up in three different Chinese characters which together read as "Yidali."</p>

      <p>First, "yi" meant surprise. Most of the artifacts which King Billy's team researched possessed this distinctive characteristic. Each one would always dazzle or surprise the people handling them.</p>

      <p>Secondly, "da"! This word didn't just refer to an artifact's immense impact, but also to the large number of times it could be used. A magic artifact could typically only be used three times before the distinctive magic halo which each artifact possessed vanished. However, each of the unique artifacts researched by King Billy could be used at least ten times!</p>

      <p>Finally, "li"! This word also had a double meaning. On one hand, it was "li" from bian li <sup>2</sup> , meaning that the magic artifacts were convenient and easy to use. On the other hand, "li" was also the second Chinese character in King Billy's name. The research institute's name thus had a really profound meaning.</p>

      <dfn><sup>2</sup>('Bian li' means 'convenient' or 'easy.')</dfn>

      <p>In the last few years, King Billy's team had developed quite a few unique artifacts that were very easy to use. Among them, the one that sold like hot cakes was that "Yidali Cannon."</p>

      <p>[Yidali Cannon]</p>

      <p>Maximum Number of Use: Ten</p>

      <p>Application: This product can be used against any strongholds, and can easily blast through hard matter like black iron and black crystal.</p>

      <p>Directions for use: This product is operated by voice control, and should only be used against buildings. At the first yell of "Fire," the cannon will automatically take aim at the target and determine the trajectory. At the second yell of "Fire," the mouth of the cannon will automatically heat up and gather power. At the third yell of "Fire," the Yunlong Missile in the bore will be fired. In the presence of a commander-in-chief and a second battalion commander, the Yunlong Missile's damage output will automatically increase by twenty percent. If there is a woman present inside the building under attack, the damage output will increase by ten percent, to a maximum output of one hundred percent.</p>

      <p>Back in the beginning, these instruction guidelines for the "Yidali Cannon" had been the talk of the town.</p>

      <p>Truly, the most mystical thing about this unique artifact was how its damage output was passively increased through identity verification and the number of women present... some people said that King Billy was the first person to perfectly decode unique artifacts, because he was unique himself...</p>

      <p>Because the products designed by King Billy's team were all somewhat odd...</p>

      <p>The Yidali Cannon was a hot product, but it wasn't cheap. It was used mostly by demolition teams since it was illegal for normal cultivators and the general populace to own them. As for Zheng Tan's "Yidali Cannon," of course it hadn't bought it.</p>

      <p>Wang Ling had discovered from Zheng Tan's memories that roughly six months ago, it had seized this Number 59 High School territory from the former boss, Shan Pao. Shan Pao was a bichon fraise sexual maniac that had been able to gain spiritual intelligence because it was a crossbreed that possessed the blood of spirit dogs.</p>

      <p>When Zheng Tan had fought Shan Pao for the territory in the beginning, it had spared no effort in doing so. With the battalion commanders under its command, it had struggled bitterly for a long time before finally claiming the territory.</p>

      <p>The "Yidali Cannon" was part of Zheng Tan's spoils of war after it had overrun Shan Pao's headquarters back then.</p>

      <p>To this day, it was still a mystery how Shan Pao had acquired this unique artifact.</p>

      <p>Wang Ling felt that the reason behind how such a destructive artifact had fallen into the hands of a group of intelligent animals was a little complex.</p>

      <p>These stray cats respected their "Immortal Meow"; when he had taught them back then, apart from popularizing the concept of team management, he had also provided mental and emotional counsel.</p>

      <p>Wang Ling had no idea how stray cats elsewhere treated humans, but in Peiyuan district at least, the stray cats led their own lives but were also able to live in harmony with humans. There were even large groups of righteous cats that would escort ladies walking home alone at night in case there were no-good lowlifes around.</p>

      <p>He was thus very confident that the cats he had trained would never act against humans.</p>

      <p>However, if these unique artifacts were to fall into the hands of animals who were just as intelligent, but happened to have dark hearts...</p>

      <p>Who knew what the consequences would be...</p>

      <p>Seeing a black cat and its subordinates slowly push a cannon just the size of a shopping basket out from where it had been hidden in a mound of grass was a little strange.</p>

      <p>This "Yidali Cannon" would easily blast a hole in this wall of black crystal without destroying the rest of the building.</p>

      <p>Of course, Wang Ling had thought about using Jingke, but it was too much like him ― as a sword spirit, it was still too young to have experienced much of the world yet, and was clueless about how to control its strength. Wang Ling was afraid that with one stroke, Jingke would cut the gym in half.</p>

      <p>Therefore, his only hope was this "Yidali Cannon" which had been designed by King Billy's team.</p>

      <p>At this time, Wang Ling couldn't make any extraordinary movements; he even had to keep his breathing steady, for fear of what could happen now that the talisman seal was weakening. A sneeze at this moment could kill people!</p>

      <p>However, he could still help out with some simple support spells.</p>

      <p>Number 59 High School's old guard hadn't left, and the sound of the "Yidali Cannon" firing was bound to draw his attention, so Wang Ling cast a soundproof barrier.</p>

      <p>Putting on protection goggles, Zheng Tan stood by the Yidali Cannon, hands on its slender waist.</p>

      <p>"Second Battalion Commander, are you ready?"</p>

      <p>"Ready, Regiment Commander!"</p>

      <p>Nodding its head, Zheng Tan placed its small paw on the sensor pad and confirmed its identity as regiment commander. Then, the muzzle of the cannon followed the direction of Zheng Tan's gaze as it pointed at a specific point on the wall.</p>

      <p>"Fire!"</p>

      <p>"Fire!!"</p>

      <p>"Fire!!!"</p>

      <p>After three world-shattering shouts of "Fire"...</p>

      <p>With a " bang ," a streak of heavenly light shot out from the cannon's muzzle!</p>

      <p>In just an instant, a waist-high hole was blasted in the wall.</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>In the women's locker room, Wang Ming was instantly awakened by this massive boom.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Jiang Liuying stood stupefied as she looked at the scene outside the hole with a stunned and pale face.</p>

      <p>On the other end of the wristwatch, a woman's voice sounded. "I heard an explosion on your end? What's going on?!"</p>

      <p>Jiang Liuying's mouth twitched.</p>

      <p>"Sis... I seem... to be surrounded... by a bunch of cats..."</p>
