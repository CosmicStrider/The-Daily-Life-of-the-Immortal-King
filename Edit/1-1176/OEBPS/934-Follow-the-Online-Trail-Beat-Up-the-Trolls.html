  <h1>Chapter 934 Follow the Online Trail, Beat Up the Trolls</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Su Xing had no idea what Bai Qiao wanted to do, but this Mrs Boss was known for her "tough" way of doing things. Although Su Xing hadn't known Mrs Boss Bai for long, her loud personality had left a very deep impression on his heart.</p>

    <p>When he called the Wang family's small villa, it was Er Ha who answered the phone.</p>

    <p>Listening to the reason for Su Xing's call, Er Ha couldn't help casting a glance up the stairs. Although Er Ha hadn't been part of the Divine Dao Star party, it had learned about exactly what had happened on Divine Dao Star from Xiao Yin.</p>

    <p>And how did Xiao Yin know?</p>

    <p>Naturally, it was Thunder who told him. They were now living under the same roof, so asking for any news was only a matter of minutes for Xiao Yin.</p>

    <p>So Er Ha also knew about Jingke and Bai Qiao fusing together on Divine Dao Star...</p>

    <p>This was where the problem lay.</p>

    <p>Since the first meld with Bai Qiao, Jingke hadn't seemed like himself. Before coming downstairs to answer the phone, Er Ha had glanced at the bed.</p>

    <p>Lord Jingke still lay next to Little Master Ling's pillow in his peach wood sword form. However... the blade had turned pink in color! And it was steaming all the time!</p>

    <p>In the past two days, Mother Wang had been using Jingke as a facial steamer; it didn't need to be plugged in, and all she needed to do was stick her face in front of it. Furthermore, the moisturizing effect was exceptional - even her crow's feet disappeared!</p>

    <p>Er Ha lifted its eyelids. Lord Jingke's current state was very worrying!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side at the Office of Strategic Deception's Internet cafe, Bai Qiao sat at the counter and waited for over ten minutes before a space fissure opened in front of her and Jingke took one step through.</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao was clearly unhappy with Jingke's tardiness. She folded her arms, a reproachful expression on her face. "You made me wait fifteen minutes! I hate it the most when people are late! But since it's the first time, I'll forgive you - there won't be a second time!"</p>

    <p>"Mm." Jingke didn't waste words.</p>

    <p>To be honest, he was a little nervous.</p>

    <p>Especially when he was right in front of Bai Qiao, his thoughts couldn't help going back to the moment they had combined back then... he had never felt like that before, as if he was floating. His mind had gone blank and even his body felt light, ultimately leaving him with an immense sense of relaxation and pleasure...</p>

    <p>But Jingke was too shy to express these feelings, and he had spent a long time forcing himself to calm down before he came.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, the Wang family's fridge had also been enchanted, so Jingke had deliberately spent ten minutes in the freezer before meeting Bai Qiao...</p>

    <p>Seeing that Jingke had arrived, Su Xing hurriedly hid some distance away to observe them in secret. He knew it was wrong to act like a third wheel, but he couldn't help his curiosity.</p>

    <p>Also, this was the first time he was seeing Lord Jingke act like a young married woman, which astonished him.</p>

    <p>"Hey, can't you smile a little? We have the same master. Why do you always look so dead and miserable every day?" Looking at Jingke, Bai Qiao couldn't help stretching out one hand to pinch his face, only to jerk it back at the ice-cold feeling as if she had been electrocuted. "Why are you so cold?"</p>

    <p>Jingke didn't say a word. "..."</p>

    <p>"Forget it." Bai Qiao pulled Jingke over by the hem of his clothes to sit down next to her. She then tapped on the mouse and the keyboard to screenshot a dozen or so of the more excessive one-star negative comments.</p>

    <p>While Jingke didn't know what Bai Qiao wanted to do, he could already make a faint guess.</p>

    <p>Folding her arms, Bai Qiao stared at Jingke. "I'm your scabbard, so isn't it your duty as the blade to protect me?"</p>

    <p>"Hm?" Jingke tilted his head. "Mm..."</p>

    <p>Somehow, this relationship seemed to have been turned on its head - shouldn't it be the scabbard that protected the blade?</p>

    <p>But after careful consideration, Jingke acquiesced for the time being, because he wanted to hear what other bizarre theories Bai Qiao was going to come up with.</p>

    <p>"Hey, why aren't you the least bit fired up?!"</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao sighed. "The correct thing for you to do at this moment is get down on your knees and shout for the world to hear: 'Jingke, this small general, is willing to lay down his life for Bai Qiao'! Only then will that create the mood!"</p>

    <p>Jingke: "..."</p>

    <p>"Forget it... You're just as bone-headed as our master." Head aching, Bai Qiao rubbed the skin between her eyebrows. She felt like she had never spoken so much before, but when she was with Jingke, she inevitably became more talkative.</p>

    <p>She pointed at the negative comments on the screen. "I want you to clean this up for me."</p>

    <p>Her plan was in fact more or less what Jingke had guessed.</p>

    <p>Jingke looked at the screen and said very slowly, "You, should, look, for, Wang Ming."</p>

    <p>"It'd be too boring to ask him for help. He can purge these comments with one wave of his hand behind the scenes, but aren't these keyboard warriors who wantonly make negative comments still at large?"</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao shrugged. "I already have their addresses. With your strength, you can open space and get there in seconds, can't you?</p>

    <p>"I want you to ferret them out one by one, ask them why they gave negative comments, then have them apologize! Finally, they have to delete these negative comments! If they don't... hmph... Don't blame me for being ruthless..."</p>

    <p>"Want to, kill them?"</p>

    <p>Jingke shook his head slowly. "Ling, won't, agree."</p>

    <p>"This bunch of keyboard warriors don't contribute to society at all; they just wreck havoc all day long. Killing them would be letting them off too easy, so of course I can't kill them! This lady still has a good heart; I'm not a devil."</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao chuckled. "Dealing with them is simple. If they don't have a good attitude, you can directly send them to Songhai First Prison and leave the rest to me."</p>

    <p>When she said this, Bai Qiao smiled darkly. As a female game otaku, her technological skills might not be as good as Wang Ming or that Uncle Black behind Zhuo Yi, but they weren't too shabby either.</p>

    <p>It had been a piece of cake for Bai Qiao to track down the addresses of these trolls through their IP addresses.</p>

    <p>Of course, Bai Qiao's real plan wasn't just to track down the IP addresses of this bunch and have Jingke hunt them down.</p>

    <p>She had also used a spiderbot on these IP addresses to track down all the other comments which this group had posted online... Back when Old Devil, Master of Immortal Mansion Cheng Yu, and Evil Sword God were arrested, these trolls had unleashed a torrent of abuse online, clamoring that the cultivation police had handled things badly and cursing eighteen generations of the three mahjong bigwigs to high heaven.</p>

    <p>Before Jingke followed the online trail to catch these trolls and send them to prison, Bai Qiao considered sending a screenshot of these comments first to that group of bigwigs in Songhai prison for a look...</p>
