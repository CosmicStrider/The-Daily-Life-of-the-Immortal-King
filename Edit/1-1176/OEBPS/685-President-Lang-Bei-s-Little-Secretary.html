  <h1>Chapter 685 President Lang Bei's Little Secretary</h1>

  <div>

    <p>That day, Yang Zhong didn't start a live stream, and used the excuse of being sick with the audience in the live stream room to take a break. The administrators in the live stream room, however, didn't take any breaks, and "Mr Li" and "Zhang Fei" continued to ban people. In less than two days, they had banned over ten thousand people who basically were passersby that had found out about the incident through Father Wang.</p>

    <p>Online users forever liked to butt in on the action as they looked forward to a show. Although the audiences for novel and live stream circles were different, their ages were similar, so this show was very tantalizing for spectators in both circles.</p>

    <p>Yang Zhong knew very well that right now he was in the eye of the storm; it was very important that he didn't admit to stealing songs and to avoid the limelight for a while. This was how he had handled the crisis last year, and it turned out to work pretty well.</p>

    <p>But this time, Yang Zhong underestimated the power of Wang Situ, the veteran guru writer on the Cultivation Chinese Network.</p>

    <p>After Daoist Guang's support for Wang Situ last night, Yang Zhong already had a feeling it would be very hard for him to free himself of this mess.</p>

    <p>"President, what should we do now?" He had no choice but to look for help from Lang Bei. Shadow Fool Guild wasn't a small one, and had signed hundreds of artists, Yang Zhong being one of them.</p>

    <p>Yang Zhong always believed that the president would never abandon him so easily. This year, he had drummed up a lot of ill-gotten gains for Shadow Fool by stealing and lip-syncing songs. Moreover, when that mishap had happened last year, it was Shadow Fool who spent several hundred thousand in penalty fees and specially signed him on. Yang Zhong had always felt that this guild cared for him and wouldn't abandon him so easily.</p>

    <p>On the other end of the line, the tone of Lang Bei, President of Shadow Fool Guild, wasn't as confident as before.</p>

    <p>That was because the two people whom Yang Zhong had offended this time had massive numbers of fans, and they would actually be very difficult to contend with if things continued like this.</p>

    <p>President Lang Bei had in fact been weighing the stakes before he picked up the phone.</p>

    <p>Shadow Fool Guild wasn't a charity guild, but a live streaming guild that had to support so many people. To be frank, everything was just a matter of making profit. Last year, Shadow Fool had signed Yang Zhong on despite the criticism. They even spent a huge sum of money to pay off his former guild's penalty fee, since they had had an eye on his future commercial value.</p>

    <p>But they were now in the eye of the storm... Any move would be more difficult to make compared with last year.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, we've already prioritized uploading the record. You can take a screenshot first and post it on Weibo; the most important thing is to calm your own fans down first." President Lang Bei said, "As for Wang Situ, I've already contacted the Cultivation Chinese Network and gotten his contact information. I'll discuss it in detail with him later. If this incident can be settled privately, and both sides can release statements to clarify the matter, it'll be a perfect ending. Plus, you'll have a lot more fans compared with last year..."</p>

    <p>"OK! Thank you, president! President, you have to help me this time!" Listening to President Lang Bei, Yang Zhong immediately felt relieved. As long as his backer hadn't abandoned him, there was still a way to save everything.</p>

    <p>After the call ended, President Lang Bei, sitting in his office, rubbed his eyes and felt his head hurt deeply.</p>

    <p>"Lord President doesn't plan to abandon him yet?" a little secretary wearing scanty clothing said next to him.</p>

    <p>"It's too early to give up on him. He still has some value." President Lang Bei mused, "This matter has already blown up, and looking at the current situation, it basically won't end well for us, but if we can settle this privately with this Mr Wang Situ... this is definitely the best option for us. "</p>

    <p>Hearing this, the scantily-clad little secretary understood. It was all because President Lang Bei thought Yang Zhong could still be used. Relying on Yang Zhong's commercial value, Shadow Fool Guild had made a lot of money this year.</p>

    <p>These days, while the live stream room was at the center of things, there was also a lot of revenue earned from gifts. Many "loyal" fans didn't hesitate to spend large sums of money in the live stream room to frantically send small gifts in order to cover those negative suspicions on the bullet screen.</p>

    <p>"What should we do next?" asked the scantily-clad little secretary.</p>

    <p>"It's very simple." President Lang Bei said, "Contact Wang Situ first, and also that Daoist Guang. Ask them what their thoughts are on this incident. If they just want compensation, we can pay a sum on Yang Zhong's behalf. Of course, if it's a sky-high price, then it's another story."</p>

    <p>"Then you'll give up on him?"</p>

    <p>"If things reach that point, of course we can only give up on him."</p>

    <p>President Lang Bei said, "Yang Zhong this person isn't clean to begin with. If it wasn't because he still has some final commercial value, I would have already canceled his contract early on. To me, he's just a pawn that can be discarded anytime..."</p>

    <p>"Lord President really is merciless." The scantily-clad little secretary smiled, went directly to President Lang Bei, then sat on his lap.</p>

    <p>Just then, the little secretary's cell phone rang.</p>

    <p>President Lang Bei held the secretary. "Who's calling?"</p>

    <p>"Hm, it's a delivery."</p>

    <p>The little secretary directly turned on the hands-free function.</p>

    <p>A voice then came through the phone. "Excuse me, is that Mr Shen? Your express delivery has arrived!"</p>

    <p>The scantily-clad little secretary stood up. "Very well! I'll go get it!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, it was still quiet at Number 60 High. It was already long past the time the Demon Hunters Association's master attack plan was meant to be carried out. It was now almost noon and there was still no movement from those so-called overseas returnee elites from the Demon Hunters Association.</p>

    <p>Quite a few Number 60 High students started to mock them in the class chats and on Tieba.</p>

    <p>"Are they coming or not? If not, we can go have lunch..."</p>

    <p>"Damn, so untrustworthy! Stressed us out for a long time! What is this group doing? They're even worse than Shadow Stream! Back when Shadow Stream came, for better or worse, they still got into the school. Can it be that this bunch can't even get through Number 60 High's front gate?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>After quietly reading the messages on Tieba and in the class chat, Wang Ling also looked out of the window and felt it was strange.</p>

    <p>The sun was exceptionally bright today... There was no sign of a storm.</p>

    <p>What on earth was going on?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling himself was also puzzled. His eyelid had clearly twitched in warning previously, but in the end it had suddenly stopped. Did the other party run into some sort of accident? Emm...</p>

    <p>"Let's stop waiting. Do what we should do, eat, eat!" Chen Chao couldn't help laughing. "Mother Juan reportedly held a food tasting event for parents in Number 60 High a while ago. It seemed only one parent showed up. When she left, she took some croquettes with her. If this parent was someone from the Demon Hunters Association who brought those meatballs back, do you think that group of people might have been directly poisoned to death?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was taken aback. "..." So that was it!</p>
