  <h1>Chapter 893 The Dream Projection of the Mind</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wednesday, August 23rd.</p>

    <p>It was the tenth day of the summer break.</p>

    <p>When Zhuo Yi finally woke up from his drunken stupor that morning, he felt something under him. Hm... it was meaty and soft.</p>

    <p>He had been dreaming about Wang Ling just now, and had even pinched his <em>shifu's </em> face in his dream. His <em>shifu </em>usually had a poker face and seldom smiled, but last night, Zhuo Yi had dreamt his <em>shifu </em>had smiled and had actually given him a lot of words of encouragement.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi couldn't help himself and had pinched his dear <em>shifu's </em> little face (It was something he had long wanted to do, but never had the guts.).</p>

    <p>As expected, dreams were the best! Anything could happen in a dream!</p>

    <p>Thus, as he was pinching Wang Ling's face, Zhuo Yi woke up with that soft and fleshy feeling still in his memory. His <em>shifu's </em> face was clearly thin, but why did it feel so nice to pinch?</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi couldn't help rubbing against the meaty thing under him for a bit.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, it didn't feel right - this flesh was clearly older than the one in his dream.</p>

    <p>When Zhuo Yi drowsily opened his eyes, he saw a fatty lying prone under him; the latter was bleeding heavily from a severe injury on his forehead and he was unconscious.</p>

    <p>Just now, he had actually been rubbing this fatty's ass...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>Looking at the time, Zhuo Yi realized he was going to be late for work again.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, it wasn't good for the body to have too much cheeky wine; he was still feeling a little muddle-headed now.</p>

    <p>Checking his phone, Zhuo Yi found several missed calls from Zhong Lang, who was worried that something had happened to him. In the end, Zhong Lang had sent a message to say that he was going over to Zhuo Yi's apartment for a look.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi hurriedly called him back. "Little Zhong, I'm fine! I just slept late last night and couldn't get up this morning."</p>

    <p>Listening to Zhuo Yi, who seemed to have regained his spirits, Zhuo Yi breathed a sigh of relief. "It's good that Brother Zhuo is alright. Don't sleep so late! Were you up all night playing games?"</p>

    <p>"Playing games..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi gazed at the fatty's round butt. "Yes, I was playing Overwatch all night."</p>

    <p>After hanging up, Zhuo Yi finally sighed with relief.</p>

    <p>He was well aware that right now, he couldn't alert the enemy.</p>

    <p>Dealing with this fatty was going to be a problem.</p>

    <p>This fatty who had passed out in his apartment had clearly been plotting something; he had taken advantage of Zhuo Yi being drunk to sneak into the latter's place, and even had a pair of suspicious scissors in his hand - who knew what he had been planning to do.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi subconsciously covered his crotch - there had been a number of news reports lately about guys whose dicks had been cut off in their sleep.</p>

    <p>But Zhuo Yi just couldn't figure out why this fatty, who was a total stranger, would do something so ruthless to him.</p>

    <p>No matter what, he had to first restrain this fatty and interrogate him!</p>

    <p>As one of the staff leaders of the Office of Strategic Deception, it was quite a serious problem that his place had actually been broken into.</p>

    <p>The first thing Zhuo Yi did was to call Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing was the leader of the goon squad, and all the interrogations of the Office of Strategic Deception were left to him. Also, now that the goon squad had a working relationship with Warden Liang of Songhai First Prison, the goon squad's interrogations were, in one word, legal!</p>

    <p>"Very well, Brother Zhuo, I'm coming over." On the other end of the phone, Fang Xing still sounded so sunny, like a spring shower which could make a person feel refreshed.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi nodded. "Mm, I've already restrained him, I'll wait for you."</p>

    <p>He had already confiscated Kong Ruye's scissors and cloak as weapon evidence, and to be on the safe side, Zhuo Yi had tied him up with Immortal Cuffs.</p>

    <p>These Immortal Cuffs were something Zhuo Yi had won before in a mahjong game with Songhai First Prison's Mahjong Squad.</p>

    <p>The last time Zhuo Yi had checked in on them at the prison, the Mahjong Squad had needed one more player, so Zhuo Yi had joined them. Warden Liang hadn't believed Zhuo Yi could win, and had bet a pair of "Immortal Cuffs."</p>

    <p>And then, these cuffs became Zhuo Yi's...</p>

    <p>There was no helping it; the only explanation was that he was a human koi fish, hence his good luck.</p>

    <p>Hands on his waist, Zhuo Yi smiled in satisfaction, and then drew open the curtains so that sunlight spilled into the living room.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi once again recalled the wonderful dream he had last night.</p>

    <p>What a pity; who knew when he would ever be able to pinch his <em>shifu's </em> face in real life.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, in the Wang family's small villa.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling also gradually opened his eyes.</p>

    <p>He had had a very strange dream in which he had seen Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>However, this wasn't a "prophetic dream," but a "dream projection of the mind," which was used to maintain order. In many instances, Wang Ling would unconsciously use small-scale Heavenly Dao spells, and normally they only affected the people around Wang Ling whom he deemed important.</p>

    <p>It was mainly used to regulate one's mindset.</p>

    <p>Mindset was an important factor in any sort of situation and could influence one's work, studies and so forth.</p>

    <p>An unregulated mindset could later turn into depression. Nowadays, a huge number of celebrities died from this mental pressure, but were labeled as "eccentric" or "fake."</p>

    <p>During the times that these people needed care the most, they quietly endured all kinds of violence and buried their hurts deep in their hearts.</p>

    <p>It was in situations like these that having company was very important.</p>

    <p>But a huge shortcoming of the "dream projection of the mind" was that Wang Ling didn't know what he would do in the dream, and would cleanly forgot everything that happened in it after it was over.</p>

    <p>As a spell to help his teammates regulate their mindsets, the dream projection of the mind could theoretically manage depression; more than that, Wang Ling created the scenario which the dreamer most wanted to see in their dreams in order to restore their spirits.</p>

    <p>As for the dream last night -</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't remember it at all.</p>

    <p>If it was a prophetic dream or a regular dream, he would absolutely remember every detail; it was only when he had a dream projection of the mind that he would forget what it looked like.</p>

    <p>Er Ha, who had been lying on its stomach on the ground all this time, wagged its tail. When it glanced at its Little Master Ling, its expression turned a little strange.</p>

    <p>For some reason, it felt that Little Master Ling's cheeks were very red... as if they had been pinched.</p>

    <p>Er Ha sighed when it saw this.</p>

    <p>It looked like Little Master Ling had finally reached the age of hot-blooded youth. This guy usually never spoke or even smiled, but as the dearest pet by his side, Er Ha was well aware what its little master's temper was like.</p>

    <p>Thus, it guessed that its little master might have had some sort of erotic dream last night...</p>
