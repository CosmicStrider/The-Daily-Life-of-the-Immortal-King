  <h1>Chapter 488 Father Wang's Secret </h1>

  <div>

    <p>After the water friends for the match had gathered, Wang Ling registered his game ID, and his character's name was as simple and blunt as ever: HHXX (short for "Good Good Study") <sup>1</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(In Chinese, HHXX is the acronym of the pinyin for 好好学习 'hao hao xue xi .. ')</dfn>

    <p>Lord Diulei had already prepared this account in advance. Wang Ling had initially planned to buy one himself. In fact, it wasn't too expensive: the standard retail price online was ninety-eight HNY... However, compared with Wang Ling's expenditure on games in general, this ninety-eight HNY was already a huge expense for him.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was quite considerate. When he had played this game before, he had thought that playing alone wasn't interesting, so he had bought one hundred accounts at one go with the intention of sending them to people and pulling them into the pit to play together. In fact, he had an account that had been specially prepared for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He had felt that there would come a day when he would be able to play a game with Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei felt that this was a lifetime achievement as well as a blessing.</p>

    <p>In ancient times, people became friends over drinks; when meeting close friends in particular, they were certain to drink a few jugs of wine. But this wasn't the style for current cultivators; the most convenient way to make friends now was on social networking platforms. When the "eating chicken" game became popular, there had been some ridicule online about how modern cultivators made friends: once, it was over a thousand cups of wine; now, it was finding a place to lay low together...</p>

    <p>In the villa's basement, Lord Diulei had an office with five or six computers. These were for work, and weren't as good as computers for gaming, but they could already be said to be the fighter planes of work computers - running a game like "eating chicken" on it completely wasn't a problem.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei sat next to Wang Ling, his face wreathed in smiles. "Brother Ling, do you know the keyboard controls?"</p>

    <p>"Mm." Wang Ling nodded. He had just spent two seconds looking at them.</p>

    <p>The door to the office was open, and Xiao Yin sat on the broccoli sofa outside the office, unmoving and clearly nervous. From this angle he could just see Wang Ling's back.</p>

    <p>"Want to ask Master about forming the contract?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was at a loss, and also a little afraid that acting too impudently would backfire.</p>

    <p>When people felt conflicted, it was inevitable that they would become nervous, and when they were nervous, everyone had different ways of getting rid of their nerves. For Xiao Yin, the most common way was to eat...</p>

    <p>Earlier, Xiao Yin had been studying different ways to make crispy noodle snacks. In the end, when he looked at Wang Ling, he somehow felt nervous, and as soon as he felt nervous, he unconsciously opened the crispy noodle snack packet he was holding and took a bite without even sprinkling the seasoning over it.</p>

    <p><em>Crunch </em>!</p>

    <p>It was just a very light crunch sound, but it still drew Wang Ling's attention.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin abruptly noticed that Master, who had initially been concentrating on the computer screen, suddenly turned his head!</p>

    <p>He didn't know if it was an illusion, but Xiao Yin somehow felt that Master's eyes looked like they were shining...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin instantly started to sweat copiously...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, the door to Father Wang's study in the Wang family's small villa was tightly shut. Mother Wang had come by earlier, and when she twisted the doorknob and realized that the door was locked, she walked away quietly. Father Wang's door generally wasn't locked. There was only one situation that Mother Wang could think of for it being locked, and that was that Father Wang was behind in his manuscript and was now typing frantically.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Mother Wang didn't bother him. Furthermore, Lie Mengmeng was also inside. Two people was better than one; the previous times when Father Wang had rushed his work, he would lock himself inside, and Mother Wang had been afraid that he would type himself to death. Nowadays, there were too many news reports about writers who stayed up all night typing before dying suddenly...</p>

    <p>But even when that was the case, there were still some readers who liked to make trouble as they tried everything to make an author fall behind in their chapters so that they could make them wear women's clothes as compensation! Mother Wang thought she was still pretty young at heart... but she really didn't understand the crossdressing trend among young people nowadays.</p>

    <p>After all, Father Wang was already quite old. How could a stoutly built man look good in women's clothes?</p>

    <p>But then again... Mother Wang suddenly thought that if it was Wang Ling who crossdressed, that wouldn't be bad!</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling had been very young, Mother Wang had in fact bought a set of girl's clothes for him and dressed him up like a little girl... almost every parent had done this.</p>

    <p>Mother Wang remembered that she had taken a picture of him at that time...</p>

    <p>"Where did I put the picture of Ling Ling dressed in girl's clothes as a child?"</p>

    <p>At the door of the study, Mother Wang cupped her chin in her hand as she pondered. Then she headed for the bedroom on the third floor.</p>

    <p>Suddenly thinking about this matter, Mother Wang immediately decided to find the picture...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the study, Lie Mengmeng breathed a sigh of relief when he heard Mother Wang's footsteps leave.</p>

    <p>"Has she gone?"</p>

    <p>Father Wang asked after taking off his headphones and turning his head.</p>

    <p>"Yes... but bro... you're still behind in your chapters. Should you really be doing this?"</p>

    <p>"It's fine, I've been in really good shape recently; I'll finish the backlog in a while. This is a rare water friends match, playing now is more important."</p>

    <p>"If you want to play, do it honestly... but you're hiding it from sis..."</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng looked guiltily at the door, somehow feeling that this was very immoral behavior.</p>

    <p>"Men always have their little secrets. Although this Lord Island isn't a female live streamer, I did give him some of my earnings in any case, in order to become his number one fan. If your sister finds out, she'll definitely scold me for a long while."</p>

    <p>There were many instances when Father Wang chose not to say anything to avoid causing some unnecessary misunderstandings. As for the money he had gifted to Lord Island, it was from his private stash; he handed over most of his author's earnings to Mother Wang every month. Buying gifts was a trivial matter, but if his private stash came to light, the consequences would be truly unimaginable.</p>

    <p>"But..."</p>

    <p>When Lie Mengmeng thought about it, he still felt that this wasn't right.</p>

    <p>"No 'buts.' Brother Lie, you don't understand..." Father Wang sighed. "You don't have a girlfriend and you haven't settled down, so it's natural that you find it hard to understand. If you want your bro and sis to live their days peacefully, just act like you never saw this. Your sis and I have never really fought... at worst, she said she was leaving home, and then she disappeared."</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng: "You didn't go look for her?"</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "What for... every time she says she's leaving home, she hides under the sofa in the basement... she said she was afraid I wouldn't be able to find her."</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng: "..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "Then when I found her, we made up instantly, and she still kept asking me if I was hungry and whether she had to cook me a bowl of noodles..."</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng: "..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang hung his headphones around his neck and gazed at Lie Mengmeng, his words slightly imploring. "Apart from typing, I usually only watch live streams and play games for fun... can't you keep quiet about this?"</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng sighed. "Fine, I'll keep quiet - but you have to type twenty thousand more words today."</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "Four thousand."</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng: "Twenty thousand!"</p>

    <p>Father Wang gritted his teeth. "Eight thousand!!"</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng: "Twenty thousand!! If you don't agree, I'll tell everyone you're a fan of 'Three Days And Two Sleeps'!"</p>

    <p>"Fine, twenty thousand... you're heartless!" Father Wang's lips twitched as he looked at Lie Mengmeng.</p>
