  <h1>Chapter 384 Why Isn't Er Ha Back Yet? </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Of course, in addition to the retired Marshal Jiang, there were many other experts hiding in the family apartment building.</p>

    <p>This was also the reason why Wei Zhi had decided to take this twenty-third floor back then.</p>

    <p>The thing that pet trainers were afraid of the most were these pet hunters; once they had their sights set on a spirit beast, these pet traffickers would do anything to obtain them. At the very least, setting up a base for breeding soul pets in this family apartment building gave Wei Zhi peace of mind.</p>

    <p>After Marshal Jiang left, Wei Zhi looked at the five men tied up on the ground and sneered. Next would be the interrogation!</p>

    <p><em>Pa </em>!</p>

    <p>He snapped his fingers.</p>

    <p>In an instant, the vines hanging down from the ceiling in the living room unexpectedly seemed to wake up as if they had a consciousness of their own. They dragged this bunch inside and strung them up one by one from the ceiling.</p>

    <p>They were actually plant-type spirit beasts?</p>

    <p>Er Ha was startled at this scene; it had thought that these ceiling vines were just for show, and hadn't expected them to be alive.</p>

    <p>The composition of plant-type spirit beasts in the spirit energy world was completely different from those in the Gate Between Worlds. In addition, the aura emitted by plant-type spirit beasts differed from regular spirit beasts, which was why Er Ha hadn't reacted to them at all. Although it was now at third class, in the end it still wasn't strong enough. It would be in a far better position once it reached second or even first class.</p>

    <p>At the very least, Er Ha's ability to perceive things would be several levels higher than it was now.</p>

    <p>It had to speed up its cultivation of the "Demon King Heart Sutra"!</p>

    <p>This was Er Ha's thought.</p>

    <p>Inside his place, Wei Zhi hung the men high up from the ceiling; among them, the bone dragon man who was the leader received the most bitter treatment as he was hung completely upside down.</p>

    <p>Crossing his arms, Wei Zhi approached the bone dragon man. "Tell me, what organization do you belong to?"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi had previously already been able to tell that these five people's origins weren't simple. A "pet hunters organization" which even dared to charge into a family apartment building had to be a very big force. The people from this type of organization survived mostly by relying on the force backing them. The mightier the force was, the more arrogant the people were.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, these people had chosen the wrong place today.</p>

    <p>The bone dragon man smiled miserably and gritted his teeth tightly, offering no reply. His face was already red as the blood rushed to his head, and he looked very uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>Er Ha knew that in addition to absorbing spirit power from the air through photosynthesis, this plant-type spirit beast had an even more direct method, and that was to absorb energy from living creatures. So in addition to being hung upside down, the man's spirit power was being sucked out bit by bit, making him feel exceptionally unwell.</p>

    <p>"I suggest that you tell us everything as soon as possible. For large-scale illegal organizations like yours, once all of you are caught, you'll be sentenced to hundreds of years in prison, easily," Wei Zhi said softly. "If you admit to your crimes now and help us find your hideout, I can arrange for you to be a witness in exchange for a shorter sentence. What do you think?"</p>

    <p>When they heard this, the group of men in black broke out in a cold sweat; the very red face of the bone dragon man in particular was already dotted with beads of sweat.</p>

    <p>He knew that Wei Zhi wasn't joking. Given the several state-protected spirit beasts that the organization had caught, a jail term of several hundred years wasn't much at all.</p>

    <p>After all, picking up a bird's egg nowadays could mean nine years in jail...</p>

    <p>But Wei Zhi also knew that his words were merely a reminder instead of a warning or threat.</p>

    <p>Since they had chosen to engage in this illegal business, then whether it was the bone dragon man who was the leader or the group or the men in black behind him, they were well aware of the liabilities they faced.</p>

    <p>They were like some celebrities who clearly knew that taking drugs was wrong, but still did so in search of so-called inspiration. Some live stream gamers were clearly already very popular, but still wanted to use cheats to flaunt their skills... Even though they knew they shouldn't, they still did it...</p>

    <p>It wasn't easy for people like these to confess.</p>

    <p>"I'll give you five minutes; this is your last chance." Wei Zhi stared at the bone dragon man with a solemn expression on his face</p>

    <p>Five minutes later, the bone dragon man gritted his teeth and still refused to say anything.</p>

    <p>"Time's up."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi had picked the right amount of time; he had already given the man a chance to reflect on and acknowledge his guilt, but most unfortunately, the latter had not cherished it.</p>

    <p>"Loopy Butterfly!" At this time, Wei Zhi gave a light shout.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "???"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi grinned. "My Pushing Large Butterfly actually didn't have a nickname, so I gave it one just now. This name symbolizes my and Brother Dog's friendship."</p>

    <p>Er Ha was stunned... <em>You actually called it Loopy Butterfly - why not call it The Moon's Reflection on the Second Spring <sup>1</sup> </em>?</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is the translated title of the renowned song "Er Quan Ying Yue" by Chinese composer Abing, 'Er' meaning both 'two' and in Chinese slang 'foolish .. ')</dfn>

    <p>Hearing Wei Zhi's call, the Pushing Large Butterfly which had initially been resting on a flower petal slowly flew over and dusted the bone dragon man's head with sparkles of fine powder.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "What's that?"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi replied, "Hallucinogenic powder."</p>

    <p>The bone dragon's face instantly turned unsightly. He hadn't expected Wei Zhi to have this trick.</p>

    <p>"I initially didn't want to use this since the side effects of the hallucinogenic powder aren't minor. But I already gave him a chance." Wei Zhi sighed. As he said this, Er Ha saw the bone dragon man's pupils gradually begin to slacken as his eyes became faintly tinged with red.</p>

    <p>These were signs that the powder was taking effect.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi stared at the man. "What organization are you from?"</p>

    <p>The bone dragon man replied, "Demon... Demon Hunters Association..."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "How many core members are there?"</p>

    <p>The bone dragon man: "Hundreds of core cadres..."</p>

    <p>This answer stunned both Wei Zhi and Er Ha. There were actually hundreds of core cadres? Then there would be at least thousands of core members, maybe even ten thousand!</p>

    <p>These last few years, pet trainers guilds across the country had joined forces with the police to clean up plenty of illegal organizations of pet hunters, but even at the most there hadn't been more than a hundred members. Compared with this organization that had hundreds of core cadres, they were completely small fry! â€” This time, they had really caught a whopper!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, Wang Ling looked at the time after coming back from school. It was already five o'clock in the evening, but Er Ha wasn't home yet.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt empty somehow.</p>

    <p>Logically speaking, no matter how late the process at the assessment center ran, the test should still be done in three or four hours. Wang Ling knew that Er Ha had gone in the morning, so it was actually a little unusual that it wasn't back yet at this time.</p>

    <p>The old man looked at the time and was a little worried. "Ling Ling, did Er Ha get lost?"</p>

    <p>The old man had learned a fair bit about pet traffickers from watching TV. In recent years especially, the country had cracked down even harder on this activity, leading to more and more coverage on this issue. Yet even then, there were still people willing to risk doing this thing.</p>

    <p>The old man looked concerned. "These pet traffickers are even brazen enough to steal giant spirit beasts the size of a gorilla... Er Ha is so weak and small, what if it's in danger?"</p>

    <p>His words made Wang Ling frown a little. Since he had formed a soul pet contract with Er Ha, he was well aware that right now, Er Ha was safe, and that it wasn't in any life-threatening danger at all.</p>

    <p>As for the soul pet traffickers that Grandfather Wang had mentioned...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought that if Er Ha had really run into them, then it really was the traffickers' bad luck.</p>
