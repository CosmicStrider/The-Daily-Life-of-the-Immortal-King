  <h1>Chapter 900 Divide and Conquer</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Even Wang Ling himself never expected everyone to be so united in their reaction, let alone Mr Fang... Initially, everyone just wanted to intimidate Mr Fang by releasing a bit of their spiritual pressure to psych him out - who would have thought that all that spiritual pressure would instantly overlay each other at the same time, directly causing Mr Fang to foam at the mouth and pass out on the spot...</p>

    <p>What an unlucky child.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>Right after that, he realized that he wasn't focusing on the right thing.</p>

    <p>He felt that he should be focusing on when he had become the group favorite...</p>

    <p>"Spiritual pressure concussion..."</p>

    <p>On the other side, the exorcism center's first aid medical staff who had hurried over wiped their sweat.</p>

    <p>Spiritual pressure concussion was the hardest injury to determine a cause for, so it could only be said that this Mr Fang who had been knocked out was just unlucky!</p>

    <p>Before the competition officially began, a strong contender for the championship had been knocked out of the ring!</p>

    <p>Boss Jin was an impulsive person; he was a man who would attack a problem with his fists before clarifying a situation, like when he had tried to punch Zhuo Yi the moment he entered the shop. In fact, he wasn't a bad person.</p>

    <p>He had offended many people over the years because of his hot temper. Mr Fang had been one of them, and this was the root cause of Boss Jin's defeat in last year's competition.</p>

    <p>Mr Fang was someone who held very deep grudges. He had been planning to do the same thing this year, to watch Boss Jin and then steal his kill - he had never expected his badmouthing to send him straight to the hospital.</p>

    <p>It would take at least half a month for him to recover.</p>

    <p>After what happened to Mr Fang, everyone else at the exorcism center who harbored ill intent toward Boss Jin held back.</p>

    <p>Boss Jin had imposing momentum this year...</p>

    <p>The group members he had enlisted looked much more reliable than the three teammates who only knew how to watch on the sideline last year!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After registering and leaving the exorcism center in the afternoon, Boss Jin asked everyone to gather at his shop for a meeting. The Good Looks group sent Fang Xing as its representative, while the Human-Beast group sent Er Ha (Note: [Human-Beast Group] Lord Diulei, Er Ha, Dharmaraja and Luo Chuang. [Good Looks Group] Fang Xing, Xiao Yin, Cailian Zhenren and Immortal Toya.]).</p>

    <p>Boss Jin didn't recognize Fang Xing or Er Ha, so when they appeared at the door, he couldn't help sighing in his heart. Since they were qualified to represent their groups at this meeting, this should be an indication of the fighting strength of the other two groups...</p>

    <p>No matter how he looked at them, Boss Jin didn't think they were reliable.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing was too young, and appeared sunny, handsome and artless; it wasn't going to be so easy dealing with those cunning demons and ghosts. As for the green-furred dog... Even if it was a spirit beast, it couldn't even take a human form. How strong could it be? Were they supposed to use it as a stage prop to create melodrama <sup>1</sup> ?</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The Chinese word for
"melodrama" literally
translates to "dog blood .. ")</dfn>

    <p>Muttering in his heart, Boss Jin sat down and said, "Thank you for coming to this meeting today... Today's meeting is mainly about assigning the battle tasks."</p>

    <p>As Boss Jin spoke, everyone, including Wang Ling, played on their phones...</p>

    <p>Boss Jin was no stranger to this situation. After all, this was basically what happened when friends got together nowadays; they would clearly be sitting together, but would all be looking at their phones.</p>

    <p>There was a sense of guilt attached to the phone, which created another communication barrier between people. Without their phones, many people didn't even know how to converse anymore.</p>

    <p>At that moment, the core administration of the Office of Strategic Deception -</p>

    <p>Were chatting enthusiastically.</p>

    <p>ID: Dog Who Wants Little Master To Stroke Its Fur (Er Ha): "It's a good thing all of you didn't come. This meeting is so boring it's making me sleepy!"</p>

    <p>ID: I Love Broccoli (Lord Diulei): "Thank you, Brother Dog, for attending the meeting. After all, Boss Jin is the leader of the operation this time. Everyone be patient for now, for the sake of Lord Jingke's scabbard! Also, we have to give Boss Jin face and not discourage him as leader. What's happening now in the meeting?"</p>

    <p>ID: Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch's Fanboy (Fang Xing): "Boss Jin is talking about the exorcism ranking list. The strongest devil this year has the code name Pen Fairy; eliminating it will directly give you one million points. Pen Fairy usually haunts Funan, but its exact location is unknown. Boss Jin says that it's very ferocious and difficult to hunt down as it can hide its spiritual body in any type of pen. It's exceptionally sneaky and uses a pen to kill people without a sound...</p>

    <p>"Second devil: Man-Eating Dove, worth eight hundred thousand points. This dove supposedly had a date with its girlfriend back then, but was stood up. It died in a fit of rage and ultimately turned into a devil with plenty of grievances; more than one hundred couples have already died under its claws this year.</p>

    <p>"Third devil: Lemon Gremlin, worth five hundred thousand points. According to Boss Jin, Lemon Gremlin has a formidable corrosive ability that can cause even the body of a Soul Formation cultivator to easily fall apart; it's truly amazing."</p>

    <p>ID: I Love Master (Xiao Yin): "So are these three devils stronger than the prison mahjong trio?"</p>

    <p>ID: Shifu Is Mine (Zhuo Yi): "Of course not! The devils selected for the exorcism competition in past years were for the most part hard to find as they are very secretive. But to tell you the truth, the three devils may not be as strong as one slap from <em>shifu </em>. Don't you think so, <em>shifu </em>?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling wasn't following the chat at all.</p>

    <p>He was just staring at the IDs of this bunch of people, lost in deep thought.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Each devil had its own fixed target and MO. For example, most of the people Pen Fairy had killed this year were Foundation Establishment high school students. Actually, it wasn't strong overall, but it was superb at hiding.</p>

    <p>The reason why it was at the top of the list this time was purely because the parents of the high school students whom Pen Fairy had killed had joined hands to decry this notorious devil and push it into the spotlight.</p>

    <p>As Fang Xing had already said in the group, Man-Eating Dove targeted couples. But to be exact, it was couples who were openly lovey-dovey in public.</p>

    <p>Finally, Lemon Gremlin's target was successful people in society who picked on the weak in particular...</p>

    <p>For Wang Ling, these three devils were all boring challenges.</p>

    <p>If it wasn't for Jingke, he wouldn't even bother to do anything to them.</p>

    <p>In Shop Number 83, Boss Jin looked at his watch and then said, "It's almost midnight. I've already booked the plane tickets to Funan. We can head out now. It's half an hour from here to the airport. The flight is at two in the morning."</p>

    <p>"That Pen Fairy is very hard to find! I heard that a group has already reached Funan! We must hurry!" The shop assistant Ling Huan next to Boss Jin had already done the preparations, and was carrying all kinds of magic artifacts for exorcism.</p>

    <p>However, the group of people in front of them didn't react at all, and were still staring at their phones...</p>

    <p>"What are you doing? Do as I say!" Boss Jin was worried.</p>

    <p>They still didn't make a sound...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's eyes were fixed on the time on his phone.</p>

    <p>It would be midnight in five seconds.</p>

    <p>Five...</p>

    <p>Four...</p>

    <p>Three...</p>

    <p>Two...</p>

    <p>One...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The instant it turned midnight, Boss Jin received a text announcement on his phone from the exorcism center: <em>The devil Pen Fairy at the top of the exorcism ranking list has been killed. The team with the kill: Team Jin Ke, awarded one million points.</em></p>

    <p>Boss Jin stared at this text with an utterly stupefied look on his face.</p>
