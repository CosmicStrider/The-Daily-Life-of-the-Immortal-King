  <h1>Chapter 628 Xiao Yin's First Assignmen</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Obviously, Xiao Yin had been duped.</p>

    <p>As for why Er Ha knew about this kind of thing, it was a long story: the cell phone which Er Ha was using now had been Father Wang's before. When he had given Er Ha the phone, he hadn't logged out of his online shopping account.</p>

    <p>Er Ha remembered opening it by accident and had just happened to see this thing in the history records at the time.</p>

    <p>There actually had been a lot of information on it, and Er Ha had stared at the screen in shock for a very long time back then before pretending it hadn't seen anything and logging out of the account. Er Ha felt that it still knew a little more about the ways of the world than Xiao Yin; if it had joked about this back then... Father Wang would definitely have kicked it out of the house.</p>

    <p>After all, that was when it hadn't been at the Wang family's small villa for very long yet.</p>

    <p>So a lot of times, turning a blind eye and pretending it didn't see anything was the most proper thing to do.</p>

    <p>And as reality proved, Er Ha made the right call back then.</p>

    <p>After all, not everyone could have as thick a thigh as Little Master Ling's.</p>

    <p>Er Ha thought for a bit, and finally decided not to tell Xiao Yin the truth about the headband. Sometimes, it was necessary to tell a white lie.</p>

    <p>So after some consideration, Er Ha said to Xiao Yin: <em>Your headband looks very nice...</em></p>

    <p>This was a very empty statement, but the fact was that Xiao Yin was seldom the object of envy. As a contract beast under Wang Ling, Xiao Yin would naturally compare himself with Er Ha, so he would always be envious every time Er Ha talked about Wang Ling taking it out for a walk. Now that there was finally something that could make Er Ha feel "envious," Xiao Yin was very happy!</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin's expression in the video was smug. "Tell me if you want it, don't be shy - I'll buy you a box!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Buy a box... Er Ha was in a daze. Buy a box for what? For disposable use?</p>

    <p>Er Ha obviously didn't want to dwell on this topic, so it quickly changed the subject and communicated telepathically with Xiao Yin. Telepathy wasn't a complicated technique, and it had undergone many improvements so that it could be used perfectly in conjunction with modern technology. For example, the "Face-To-Face Telepathy Spell" Er Ha was currently using was a telepathy technique designed especially for use in video calls.</p>

    <p>No matter how many modifications were made, the many different branches of telepathy shared the same principle. As long as a person was capable of the basic telepathy technique, it wasn't hard to learn the other types of telepathy. It was only Heavenly Dao-type telepathy which had a structure completely different from basic telepathy.</p>

    <p>Er Ha remembered Little Master Ling mentioning the Heavenly Dao "Great Telepathy Spell" before.</p>

    <p>If Wang Ling wanted to, he could send his voice into the depths of the hearts of all the people on earth at the same time...</p>

    <p>This was too heaven-defying a method, on a level so far beyond reach.</p>

    <p>Hence, each time Er Ha used telepathy, it would wonder when it would ever be as remarkable as Little Master Ling... So many cultivators had protruding lumbar discs, but only its own family's little master stuck out enough to turn a person's scalp numb <sup>1</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A relatively new online saying to talk up a person..)</dfn>

    <p>Face-To-Face Telepathy Spell?</p>

    <p>When Lord Diulei saw this scene, he could only tactfully turn back to his own business.</p>

    <p>If they had chosen to speak telepathically, this meant that the two contract beasts were about to talk about something confidential and it was inappropriate for him to listen in. Since that was the case, he naturally wasn't going to make himself unwelcome.</p>

    <p>Besides, Lord Diulei didn't feel that this was a bad thing. Although Xiao Yin and Er Ha might bicker now and then, this was another reflection of their close relationship. Now, the two of them had started to learn to share in confidence with each other. This scene created a warm, nostalgic sense of brotherly communication.</p>

    <p>"That's just like Brother Ling, to think of everything!" Looking at this scene now, Lord Diulei couldn't help sighing emotionally in his heart. No wonder so many people now supported the two-child policy. Having another contract beast really changed things; two contract beasts would keep each company and never feel lonely.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Xiao Yin thought it was a little strange when Er Ha used telepathy.</p>

    <p>"Why do we need to use the Face-To-Face Telepathy Spell? Can't we let Thunder know?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha replied, "It'll be dangerous for Senior Immortal if he knows. After thinking about it, our little master decided to hide it from him." Although Lord Diulei had that Soul Suppression Ring that could bring him back to life, it wasn't invincible and also had its own limitations.</p>

    <p>After Thunder was killed by Evil Sword God, Wang Ling carefully read up on the precise instructions for the Soul Suppression Ring. As long as the ring remained intact, it could recreate the corporeal body and was capable of infinite resurrections. However, there was another note which Wang Ling hadn't noticed before, which was about the energy source.</p>

    <p>The instructions for the Soul Suppression Ring very clear stated that resurrection was limited to those mortally wounded by spells driven by spirit energy.</p>

    <p>That was to say, if the energy source the enemy used was primordial qi, the Soul Suppression Ring was useless. Hence, Wang Ling had never planned on getting Thunder involved in this issue since the very beginning.</p>

    <p>The matter of the Three Views-Shattering Hammer was a long story since it had to start with the corpse of the kun in the Holy Palace of the demon world after it had been defeated by Demon Saint and Sage Master Shen Wuyue.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was dazed when he heard this. He had no idea that Er Ha had had such an adventure.</p>

    <p>"So, you've been mistaken for a big shot now?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was stunned, but this didn't seem to be the main point now!</p>

    <p>What had he heard?</p>

    <p>A prehistoric vicious beast...</p>

    <p>And a baby kun, even...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin then couldn't help clicking his tongue as he said in the tone of one who had foreseen something, "So there actually are prehistoric vicious beasts that are still alive?"</p>

    <p>"You sensed them?" Er Ha asked suddenly.</p>

    <p>"Yes, but I didn't dare confirm it before... Actually, holy beasts and vicious beasts have a bit of a reactive connection," Xiao Yin replied. "When I was hiding in Immortal Mansion back then, I had a vague sense of it, but I thought it was an illusion. So it's possible that the angler you mentioned might have let these vicious beasts loose on earth!"</p>

    <p>These words made Er Ha's fur shiver all over, and it suddenly understood why its little master had pressed forward with making the hammer.</p>

    <p>It was likely that after Little Master Ling learned about this angler, he had already felt that the other party was extending his reach to Earth.</p>

    <p>Although it still wasn't clear what the other party's objective was...</p>

    <p>What they could be sure of was that Immortal Zhenyuan's life was indeed in danger.</p>

    <p>"How about it, want to come with me? To help deliver the hammer which little master made for that senior," Er Ha looked at Xiao Yin and said after it calmed down.</p>

    <p>"Of course! This is the first travel assignment from Master, I definitely have to do it well!" Xiao Yin tore the mask off his face and stood up excitedly.</p>

    <p>Actually, he also had a slightly selfish motive for going.</p>

    <p>Since the prehistoric vicious beasts which legend said had already disappeared were still alive... then was it possible that there were holy beasts that were still alive?</p>
