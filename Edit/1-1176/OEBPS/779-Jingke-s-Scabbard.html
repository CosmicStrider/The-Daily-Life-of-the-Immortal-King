  <h1>Chapter 779 Jingke's Scabbard</h1>

  <div>

    <p>For the exploration party that had entered Beast King's tomb this time, this was an unavoidably sorry ending.</p>

    <p>For Xiao Yin in particular, it was a heavy blow.</p>

    <p>One could imagine how he felt as his hope, already rekindled, was once again extinguished.</p>

    <p>After the group left Devil King's mindscape, he woke up from his long sleep. This time, however, he would never enter the game world again.</p>

    <p>After a thousand years of searching for clues in the game, he had played it to the point of almost throwing up... He never wanted to see this game again.</p>

    <p>"What is Your Majesty Beast King going to do next?" Wang Ming asked Devil King.</p>

    <p>"I haven't left this place for a long time; the world is so big, I want to go out and take a look around..."</p>

    <p>Instead of giving a direct answer, Devil King took out a small box studded with various kinds of precious stones and gave it to Xiao Yin. "Young man, the Heavenly Dao Treasure Box didn't tell us the secret to reviving the holy beast race, but that doesn't mean that it isn't possible to do so. There is still hope."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin raised his head and took the small box, lost in thought.</p>

    <p>Devil King gazed at him. "You've already found a very good patron. Open this small box after you go back; there are instructions inside."</p>

    <p>"What's in here?" Xiao Yin asked curiously.</p>

    <p>"A holy beast's cultivation progresses very slowly. For you to now already be a fifth-class holy beast at eight thousand years old is already not easy. This contains a secret technique which can increase your cultivation rate. However, according to the rules of the holy beast race, only holy beasts are allowed to read it. Since these are all your friends, I will overlook it. Qin Lang will come and retrieve this box a year later. During that time, you must protect this box well, understand?"</p>

    <p>"Yes." Xiao Yin nodded.</p>

    <p>With that, Devil King looked at the others. "I promised to tell you how to reach the Domain of the Gods - the answer is also in this box. After Xiao Yin is done studying it, he should more or less understand. You can discuss it with him in the future."</p>

    <p>"In that case, many thanks, Your Majesty Beast King." Zhuo Yi and Wang Ming were overjoyed when they heard this.</p>

    <p>"Oh, that's right, can I ask for one more thing?" Xiao Yin asked.</p>

    <p>In fact, he was asking for Luo Chuang, who was on the side.</p>

    <p>"What do you want?" Devil King's voice was very gentle.</p>

    <p>"One Thousand Dried Bone."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was very straightforward, then turned to look at Luo Chuang next to him. "This man is a craftsman and he's working on Lord Jingke's scabbard. He needs the One Thousand Dried Bone as supplementary material."</p>

    <p>Devil King understood instantly. "That's easy. I'll have Qin Lang select a few good ones for you. The purest resources in Beast King's Remains are in fact inside this tomb, and Qin Lang has been responsible for taking care of them all these years."</p>

    <p>"I will do as Your Majesty Beast King commands." Qin Lang promptly nodded when he heard that.</p>

    <p>"I don't actually need so much..." Luo Chuang felt a little embarrassed.</p>

    <p>"No need to be polite." Devil King waved one paw the size of a small mountain. "Lord Jingke solved a one thousand-year-old problem for me. This small bit of help is nothing. Besides, creating a scabbard for Lord Jingke won't be easy. Having more materials on hand will help improve your success rate."</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang laughed. "In that case, it would be impolite of me to refuse!"</p>

    <p>Qin Lang was suddenly a little curious. "Lord Jingke never had a scabbard to begin with?"</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang shook his head. "No, he doesn't. I've always wanted to make one for him."</p>

    <p>"Have you picked the main material?" Qin Lang asked.</p>

    <p>"Amitayus wood," Luo Chuang replied.</p>

    <p>"I don't think that's enough." Qin Lang shook his head. "If you want to make Lord Jingke's scabbard, it would at the very least have to be put together with the wood of the three godly trees. I can supply you with some Qin wood. As for the Holy Sky tree... as far as I know, after it became extinct in this world, only one person has saplings of the Holy Sky tree. But this person's whereabouts are a mystery, and it's very difficult to find him... and whether he will give it to you or not is another problem."</p>

    <p>"Who is he?" Wang Ming asked.</p>

    <p>Qin Lang's face was very solemn. "This man's Daoist name is: Immortal Zhenyuan..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>A few days later, it was Friday August 4th in the fifteenth week of the semester.</p>

    <p>On the last day of the joint school summer camp in the remains, Wang Ming made a resplendent entrance in front of all the students in his overbearing "Wang Ling One."</p>

    <p>Surprised cries rang out among the students.</p>

    <p>"What the hell, who is that?"</p>

    <p>"Teacher... Lao Gudong Xiaoer."</p>

    <p>"What?! How did Lao Gudong Xiaoer come back as Iron Man after going missing?"</p>

    <p>So, were they filming a movie?</p>

    <p>Many students were shocked at this scene, but of all the people in the training square, it was the teachers who were the most astonished and stunned. When Wang Ming showed up in the company of Zhuo Yi's party, who had been sent to check out the suspicious coordinates, the teachers, including Wu Zhenjun, couldn't help but gape.</p>

    <p>They were dumbstruck by this magic treasure mecha armor suit and its super high-tech attributes.</p>

    <p>"Lao Gudong Xiaoer, are you alright?"</p>

    <p>"Are you kidding, how could something happen to me? Besides, through this experience, I succeeded in comprehending a legendary spell. I combined the two first-rate spirit techniques, 'Lion's Roar' and 'One Yang Finger,' into one<sup>1</sup> ..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A line from the Chinese film comedy "Never Say Die..")</dfn>

    <p>Everybody: "???"</p>

    <p>In the sky, Wang Ming shook his head, and then stuck up one middle finger at Wu Zhenjun. "You, bring it on!!!"</p>

    <p>Wu Zhenjun: "Lao Gudong Xiaoer, don't play around..."</p>

    <p>Everyone could see that Wang Ming seemed a little different, but they couldn't exactly say how... hm, that was, if you weren't counting how he had become more confident and chuuni...</p>

    <p>Most people here didn't know Wang Ming's true identity. But in the end, all the teachers this time were gold medal teachers from various schools who had been carefully picked by Huaxiu Alliance. Their strength and experience were beyond question. Many students saw this Lao Gudong Xiaoer as just one of these gold medal teachers, but that was the problem - most people didn't know that Wang Ming in fact wasn't a cultivator, but an ordinary person.</p>

    <p>To ensure Wang Ming's safety, the head of state had communicated this problem to Wu Zhenjun before the start of the summer camp.</p>

    <p>Now, the first thing Wang Ming did after returning was to actually challenge him.</p>

    <p>Wu Zhenjun didn't know where Wang Ming's courage came from as an ordinary person...</p>

    <p>Should he fight him or not? Wu Zhenjun didn't know what to do at all.</p>

    <p>He knew Wang Ming's identity, and was even more aware that the head of state valued Wang Ming highly.</p>

    <p>Wu Zhenjun bowed to Wang Ming, politely refusing Wang Ming's request to do battle. "Since Lao Gudong Xiaoer has returned safely, this is a happy thing worth celebrating."</p>

    <p>Huaxiu nation's secret weapon, the hidden most powerful brain, and the only disciple of one of the Ten Founding Generals, Wisdom Saint President Qi - in the end, even if Wang Ming was a cultivator with roughly the same level of strength, how could Wu Zhenjun make a move in the face of these multiple important identities?</p>

    <p>The entire time, the head of state watched them secretly on the side. He knew that given Wang Ming's character, the latter would never do anything he wasn't prepared for. The head of state deduced that this brand new mecha armor which Wang Ming was wearing was probably something he had developed on the spot when he had been in danger. Wearing this mecha armor magic treasure meant that Wang Ming had battle strength.</p>

    <p>What wasn't clear was just how much battle strength he had.</p>

    <p>As the "chief instructor" among the lead teachers, Wu Zhenjun's strength naturally wasn't in question, and he was already a level one Itinerant Immortal.</p>

    <p>Could Wang Ming truly take on an Itinerant Immortal in a fight with just a mecha armor suit?</p>

    <p>The head of state lowered his eyes as he watched quietly from a distance. He was very curious in his heart.</p>
