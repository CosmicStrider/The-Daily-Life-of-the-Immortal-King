  <h1>Chapter 1078 Regain Confidence?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The King's Eye had the power to eliminate what was false and retain what was true. Although the world of the Shadow Palace created by the Shadow Dao heart demon was excessive and the food looked so real and smelled irresistible, the world's true appearance was laid bare under Wang Ling's King's Eye.</p>

    <p>To try and use a petty heart demon illusion in the Shadow Palace to trap Wang Ling - this was simply looking down on this Immortal King's capability. Wang Ling had pretended to fall for it largely because he had sensed that the spirit power inside Er Ha's body had reached a critical point after they entered this world, and Er Ha just needed a turning point in order to make a breakthrough.</p>

    <p>This was why Wang Ling had directed and acted out this play himself.</p>

    <p>He never thought it would be at the cost of Zhenyuan being summoned...</p>

    <p>As a sheltered "baby," Wang Ling naturally felt bitter.</p>

    <p>His principle of laying low would never change, so of course, the fewer people who knew his identity, the better. Wang Ling had only acknowledged Thunder after years of testing him, but even then, Thunder only knew part of Wang Ling's actual situation.</p>

    <p>Few outsiders knew of Wang Ling's true situation; Zhuo Yi, as Wang Ling's disciple, was the only human being who was privy to it.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi had been searching for Wang Ling for many years, and hadn't breathed a word about Wang Ling in all that time; he was a very trustworthy person. It was after Wang Ling put Zhuo Yi through all sorts of tests that he finally decided to accept this disciple - it wasn't because of those crispy noodle snack packets! Definitely not! ╭(╯^╰)╮Hmph!</p>

    <p>But Zhenyuan's appearance now put him in an awkward situation...</p>

    <p>After all, Zhenyuan was a Venerated Immortal, who was recognized as a legendary cultivator on Earth. Although his realm still fell a little short of Wang Zhen's level, the latter being from the Domain of the Gods, Zhenyuan was an expert whose reputation was well-deserved.</p>

    <p>In short, he wasn't easy to fool.</p>

    <p>After Er Ha evolved into its human form, Wang Ling felt that it was time to drop the act, so he stopped pretending that he had been taken over by the heart demon. Seeing this, Er Ha hurriedly urged Zhenyuan to cancel the seal.</p>

    <p>The Heavenly Emperor's Jade Seal was admittedly powerful, but it was ridiculous to imagine that it could suppress Wang Ling. If it wasn't because Wang Ling had an act to keep up right to the end, he could have broken the seal with one puff of air.</p>

    <p>Er Ha transformed back into its dog form and ran over to check on Wang Ling, before sighing with relief after discovering that he was fine.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had almost scared it to death.</p>

    <p>But at the same time, Er Ha was suspicious.</p>

    <p>How could a person as devilishly strong as Little Master Ling be so easily possessed by the heart demon?</p>

    <p>"Senior Dog, I think you're more handsome in your human form!" Zhenyuan also came over and started to lavish extravagant praise on Er Ha.</p>

    <p>"I think so too, but I don't have any clothes." Er Ha laughed, but was sweating. Except for the green hair, its human form was more handsome than it had imagined. Unfortunately, it didn't have any clothes, and it didn't seem very tasteful to walk about with its thing dangling out.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was lost for words for some time.</p>

    <p>What he was mainly thinking about now was how he should face Zhenyuan.</p>

    <p>This was a cultivator acclaimed as a legend on Earth; if Wang Ling got tangled up with the other party, he couldn't imagine what might happen in the future. The new school term was just about to start, and Wang Ling wanted to sort out his little sister's mess before then so that he could live his Senior Grade One life peacefully.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't expect the problems to pile up like dominos, with things spiraling out of control ever since the first domino fell.</p>

    <p>"Senior!" Zhenyuan took the initiative to come over and greet him.</p>

    <p>It seemed like a simple greeting, but in that instant, Wang Ling was pulled into another space.</p>

    <p>This was the Mystical Sound Technique, which was a spell that combined space and sound. When cast, it could instantly suck a person into a separate mental space which was soundproof and practically impossible to guard against.</p>

    <p>Of course, there was no way Wang Ling would be affected; no one could invade his mental landscape so easily. He just wanted to see what move Zhenyuan would use on him as well as what Zhenyuan wanted to say.</p>

    <p>Having said that, Wang Ling was a little disgruntled at being pulled into a different space at their first meeting.</p>

    <p>The red-haired young man who stood in front of him in the mental space still looked composed. In a confrontation, experts often didn't reveal much on their faces; even if they were panic-stricken, their expressions would look unruffled and calm.</p>

    <p>"Senior, you deliberately let yourself be led astray." When Zhenyuan opened his mouth, he got straight to the point. From his previous contact with Zhenyuan, Wang Ling knew that this guy was a straightforward person who didn't like to beat around the bush. Actually, this was good, since Wang Ling didn't have to waste time making blind guesses.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sank into a short silence again at these words. He didn't deny it, which was as good as admitting it.</p>

    <p>"I knew it..." Zhenyuan sighed emotionally. "Senior, I want to ask you for a favor."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "???"</p>

    <p>"Senior, it's like this: I've been fixing Drought Star all this time. Since getting rid of Wind Spirit, I've been wondering what kind of attitude a true expert in the cultivation world should have toward life as well as future cultivation... Senior Dog's appearance was a huge inspiration."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan's next words then completely astonished Wang Ling. "I know the reason why Senior deliberately went astray was to stimulate Senior Dog's true strength so that it had the courage to face its human form, right?"</p>

    <p>"..." Not at all, come on!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had clearly stirred Er Ha up in order to help it transform into a human! It didn't have a human form to begin with! Why had it suddenly turned into helping Er Ha regain its confidence??? What kind of operation was this?</p>

    <p>"Senior, I understand. You don't need to say anything else... I know that Senior Dog's green hair in its human form makes it a little self-conscious. And Senior Dog's human form itself is a little... hm... actually, I'm not sure whether it's proper for me to say this, but I'll still say it..."</p>

    <p>"A little what..." Wang Ling's curiosity was piqued.</p>

    <p>"A little... short..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"It's quite normal for a man to lose his confidence when he's that short as a human." Zhenyuan sighed lightly. "But I didn't expect Senior to actually help Senior Dog regain its confidence by provoking it. I was greatly moved when I saw how Senior Dog rushed forward to save Senior without any thought to its own safety."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Because of that, I have a presumptuous request." After saying that, Zhenyuan finally got to the point. "Senior, please accept me as your disciple and let me study under you..."</p>
