  <h1>Chapter 120 Haven't Dropped Dead Yet, but on the Way to It </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling calmly watched this ferocious Ghost General lunge at him, before it looked like it had seen a ghost of its own and then turned to run away.</p>

    <p>The Wang family's small villa on East Huang road was in the outskirts, which used to have a lot of lonely souls and ghosts. In the end, Wang Ling had frightened them all away. He remembered when a ghost had once rushed at him like the Ghost General had, and had been reduced to scattered ashes and dissipating smoke.</p>

    <p>It could be said that this Ghost General had better luck.</p>

    <p>Actually, it hadn't been scared off by Wang Ling, but by the fighting lion crouched down next to him.</p>

    <p>After about ten minutes of drawing earlier on, he had already created several kinds of reinforcement talismans which he had wrapped around the fighting lion, like the rollers in the landlady auntie's hair <sup>1</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The landlady auntie is an
iconic character in the popular
Hong Kong film 'Kung Fu
Hustle.')</dfn>

    <p>This fighting lion had leveled up to god class thanks to Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>The twenty reinforcement talismans on the fighting lion's body glowed with light, creating a special halo effect around it. As soon as the Ghost General had flown into the villa, it had almost been blinded by this dazzling radiance.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>As a result, after a full three seconds of silence, this Ghost General decided to take its leave.</p>

    <p>Fuck!</p>

    <p>A fighting lion that had been powered up twenty times!</p>

    <p>Why even bother fighting?!</p>

    <p>And then, this was the scene inside the car now...</p>

    <p>Inside the limousine, Third Saint supported Second Saint's limp body as everyone lowered their heads in grief.</p>

    <p>Like elder brother, Second Saint had also suffered from backlash. But the rebound of power from the Demonic Path was clearly greater than the rebound from spiritual pressure, and was a stage five injury.</p>

    <p>He didn't struggle unnecessarily.</p>

    <p>After coughing up one last mouthful of blood, he dropped dead.</p>

    <p>Fresh blood sprayed all over Third Saint's face.</p>

    <p>Looking at the monitor screen, Song Qingshu gritted his teeth bitterly. "Today's mission was a failure — it ends here!"</p>

    <p>This was just too strange; from what he had seen on the monitor screen, the other party was just a teenager. Song Qingshu just couldn't understand what on earth had happened — just ten minutes after they had commenced their attack, the magnificent Ten Saints had already suffered the loss of their top two generals!</p>

    <p>It was obvious that attacking blindly was ineffective, since they had no information on that youngster at all.</p>

    <p>The best strategy that Song Qingshu could come up with now was to retreat for the sake of advancing another day.</p>

    <p>"Fourth brother..."</p>

    <p>Third Saint rose to his feet and passed the Night Demon's Weapon to the Taoist wearing a pink cloak next to him. "Take this Buddhist staff. From now on, you will lead the remaining five."</p>

    <p>Everyone's eyes were fixed on Third Saint, and they could see the determination in this Taoist's heart.</p>

    <p>The Taoist in the pink cloak accepted the staff. "I'll heed third brother's instructions!"</p>

    <p>Third Saint stared at the security camera for Song Qingshu in the front of the car to see. "Director Song, you are not to blame for this failure. Firstly, we underestimated the enemy. Secondly, we were willful in doing things our way. When you go back, please report the truth to the Lord of the Castle. We Ten Saints are very sorry that we have failed this assignment..."</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu was silent for a while. "Senior Third Saint, you have made up your mind?"</p>

    <p>"Elder brother and second brother died unnatural deaths, so I will avenge them." Third Saint nodded. "If my revenge is successful, I will return with the stone ghost mask and look for all of you. If not, please look for my body and bury me with elder brother and second brother in Jiangnan <sup>2</sup> . That was our hometown where we brothers cultivated together."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is probably a reference
to a line in the poem 'When
I Die' by eminent Chinese
scholar Yu Guangzhong,
who died in December 2017:
"When I die, bury me
between Yangtze River and
the Yellow River." Jiangnan
translates to "south of the
river," and in China refers to
the south of the lower
reaches of the Yangtze
River.)</dfn>

    <p>"Very well, I understand."</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu let out a sigh.</p>

    <p>Third Saint opened the car door and stepped out. His white Taoist cloak fluttered around him as he raised an immortal sword with cold killing intent.</p>

    <p>Before he left, this Third Saint seemed to think of something, and he turned his head to look back. "From now on, there are only seven people left, and the Ten Saints are no more... fellow brothers, you must now come up with a name that will once again resound loud and clear."</p>

    <p>These junior brothers immediately sunk into deep thought.</p>

    <p>After hearing this, it was only Song Qingshu who was inspired as he said diffidently, "Senior Third Saint... how about this name, the Seven Monsters of Jiangnan?"</p>

    <p>Third Saint: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In life, if you hadn't dropped dead yet, you were on the way to it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought that this saying really suited the Ten Saints.</p>

    <p>It was easy for people in high positions to miss the forest for the trees. All these years, the Ten Saints had succeeded perfectly in every mission they had taken on and had built a good name for themselves in the industry — but this time, their record had been broken.</p>

    <p>This was because they hadn't known what kind of iron plate they had kicked <sup>3</sup>...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>("To kick an iron plate' means
believing someone is easy to
bully, only to suffer from the
realization that theyʼre
stronger than you ..)</dfn>

    <p>Third Saint had chosen to stay, firstly, for revenge, and secondly, to investigate.</p>

    <p>The day had now turned to dusk.</p>

    <p>The seven Soul Formation cultivators had left, and only Third Saint remained outside the villa. Immortal sword in hand, he headed in the direction of Lord Diulei's villa in Wenxian Garden.</p>

    <p>His white cloak fluttering in the wind, Third Saint lifted his sword with cold killing intent. Because he was unfamiliar to the head of security on duty, the latter approached him uneasily. The security guard stared at the "good-natured" expression on Third Saint's face and swallowed hard as he squeezed out a smile. "...May I ask, sir, do you live here or are you paying someone a visit?"</p>

    <p>Third Saint said with a straight face, "I'm looking for an old friend."</p>

    <p>Head of security: "..." Who would look for an old friend with a sword in hand?!</p>

    <p>Obviously they weren't going to be swapping notes on cooking!</p>

    <p>The head of security was a little nervous; while the security guards on duty at Wenxian Garden didn't have high realms, they were still cultivators. Third Saint's cold aura was so obvious that this head of security could already smell danger. "Sir, if you are here to visit someone, kindly let me know the villa number so that we can confirm your identity with the owner."</p>

    <p>Third Saint eyed one villa in particular in the distance. "Have you noticed that there's something wrong with that villa?"</p>

    <p>The head of security followed Third Saint's gaze and was immediately alarmed... fuck, wasn't that Great Death-Courting Senior's villa?!</p>

    <p>He looked at the Taoist in the white cloak once again, and he wasn't so stupid to not realize that this man very likely had a vendetta!</p>

    <p>Anxious, the head of security started to sweat freely. "Sir... don't act recklessly..."</p>

    <p>Third Saint: "That villa has clearly broken building regulations. Let this old man tear it down, I believe it'd be a far more pleasing sight then."</p>

    <p>Head of security: "Sir, who on earth are you..."</p>

    <p>Third Saint stared at the security guard and solemnly said two words, "Lei Feng<sup>4</sup>!"</p>
    
    
      <dfn><sup>4</sup>(Reminder Lei Feng was a soldier in the People's Liberation Army who, after his death, was held up by the communist party as an example of a model citizen. He has become a cultural icon, symbolizing selflessness, modesty and dedication.)</dfn>


    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In spite of the head of security trying to stop him, Third Saint advanced on the villa grimly.</p>

    <p>He had knocked down the head of security at the gate with spiritual pressure, and had left the man foaming at the mouth and convulsing on the ground.</p>

    <p>This security guard was very lucky that he hadn't become a ghost under Third Saint's sword; right now, his heart burned with vengeance, so he was in no hurry to take the guard's life. On the other hand, if this head of security had drawn his weapon, it might have been a different and pretty tragic ending.</p>

    <p>When Third Saint reached the entrance, he realized that the front door of the villa was already open.</p>

    <p>And then, the youngster whom they had been monitoring with the Heaven and Earth Spirit Awakening Array slowly strolled out.</p>

    <p>Third Saint was immediately stunned the instant he saw Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Because, this teenager was wearing a blue... school uniform?</p>

    <p>This person was actually a student?!</p>

    <p>Third Saint was dumbfounded.</p>
