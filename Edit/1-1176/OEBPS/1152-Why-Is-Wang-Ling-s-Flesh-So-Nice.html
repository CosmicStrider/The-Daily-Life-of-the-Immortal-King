  <h1>Chapter 1152 Why Is Wang Ling's Flesh So Nice?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The lethal attraction of holy beast blood caused an uproar in the jungle and drew the attention of several giant spirit beasts close to Fire Peak.</p>

    <p>"This scent..." A monkey king with massive arms wrapped in spirit flame licked its thin lips. It was already drooling at the scent, which was similar to that of a thousand-year nectarine.</p>

    <p>"A level two flaming arm giant monkey king, a level two blood claw serpent king, dozens of level three spirit beasts, and hundreds of level four and level five spirit beasts..." Er Ha sensed the change in the jungle. As long as he kept these spirit beasts under control, it would be enough to put on a good show.</p>

    <p>With Xiao Yin and Er Ha working together, dealing with these spirit beasts was a piece of cake.</p>

    <p>The level two monkey king and serpent king, which had been the first to arrive, were subdued on the spot. Er Ha used the level two serpent king's body, which was dozens of meters long, as a rope to firmly tie up the monkey king.</p>

    <p>"Upper Immortal, spare us." The two level two spirit beasts who were completely wrapped up together were utterly stupefied; they never thought that a holy beast and a quasi-holy beast would actually show up here. What was more, the quasi-holy beast was a green-furred akita that had actually cultivated a human form!</p>

    <p>It should be known that they had already cultivated for over a thousand years, but had yet to achieve a human form.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Ten or so minutes later, the team from Number 60 High saw birds wheeling in the sky and hundreds of beasts rushing around in the jungle in front of them.</p>

    <p>Led by the level two monkey king and serpent king, numerous spirit beasts ran rings around Wang Ling, but had no desire to fight him, and were just going through the motions... Wang Ling knew that it had to be Xiao Yin and Er Ha who had organized this.</p>

    <p>He had already smelled Xiao Yin's holy beast blood earlier, and after suddenly encountering this bunch of spirit beasts who shouldn't have appeared, but were now rushing about, he instantly knew what had happened.</p>

    <p>It was very obvious that these spirit beasts had been forced by Xiao Yin and Er Ha to act as extras.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed inwardly at how tough it was to act as extras; while they were running about, it wasn't a chaotic mess; the number of spirit beasts in the area for this exercise had to be controlled. If they swarmed forward in one go, it was possible that this area would be deemed at risk of a beast tide.</p>

    <p>The beast tide phenomenon happened every now and then on Night Dragon Mountain, but on average, it was usually once every three months at most. Travel during a beast tide was extremely dangerous, and the command center would definitely send people to intervene at that time and investigate the cause.</p>

    <p>There was no need to let that happen.</p>

    <p>Luckily, under Xiao Yin and Er Ha's command, these spirit beasts acted in an orderly fashion and didn't arouse the suspicions of the command center.</p>

    <p>More spirit beasts gradually filled the surroundings, which added a little more color to this dull jungle adventure.</p>

    <p>The truth was that it didn't matter or not if there were any spirit beasts around; Wang Ling and the others could survive on spirit fruits and berries. However, it had been a little unreal just now when there weren't any spirit beasts around at all.</p>

    <p>After another half an hour, Number 60 High reached Fire Peak. To their pleasant surprise, there were no signs of a campsite on Fire Peak.</p>

    <p>In other words, Number 60 High was the first to arrive.</p>

    <p>"We're actually the first team?" Chen Chao felt surprised.</p>

    <p>The monkey king and serpent king who were currently running around in the jungle were feeling bitter. They had been forced by Xiao Yin and Er Ha to not only agree to put on a show, but to also disrupt the competition by sending lots of little monkeys and serpents to interfere with other teams who had planned to occupy Fire Peak.</p>

    <p>This was why Fire Peak looked so clean and untouched when the Number 60 High team arrived...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, the mahjong group led by General Bai cooperated with the command center and snuck into the area where Human Devil Xia Lixing was suspected to be.</p>

    <p>There were no students in this area; all of them had been shepherded away by the teachers.</p>

    <p>"Human Devil was here..." The Old Devil gazed at traces of withered spirit plants on the ground. Only Xia Lixing had this terrifying ability to wantonly devour life.</p>

    <p>As they advanced, they could sense Human Devil's power of death and blight.</p>

    <p>General Bai gazed at the footprints on the ground; each of them gave off the smell of death. For anyone who stepped on Human Devil's footprints and followed in his path, the cells in their bodies would swiftly wither and die, as if they had been exposed to radiation.</p>

    <p>"He's stronger..." The Old Devil stared at the footprints on the ground, a hint of worry on his face under the Three Circles mask.</p>

    <p>"How have things changed compared with when you fought him last time?" asked General Bai.</p>

    <p>"It's very troublesome." The Old Devil shook his head slightly and said bluntly, "When I fought him back then, only the places he touched would wither and age. This large area of decay, however, now proves that Xia Lixing's Holy Devil Imprisonment Technique has advanced greatly... even to the point of perfection."</p>

    <p>All of a sudden, the Old Deil's expression turned alarmed. "Not good!"</p>

    <p>"What are you thinking?"</p>

    <p>"The Holy Devil Imprisonment Technique can help him absorb the souls and devour the cells of all living things. Nature phenomena like the rainbow mist occur every day on Nine Dragon Mountain... For example, if this person devours all living things on Nine Dragon Mountain, and then waits for them to be revived by the rainbow mist, and then devours them again... If this continues nonstop..."</p>

    <p>After the Old Devil said this, everyone else present shuddered. If this really happened, it truly would be the legendary perpetual motion machine.</p>

    <p>Devour living things, then devour them again... General Bai truly hadn't considered this.</p>

    <p>"We must get rid of Human Devil Xia Lixing as soon as possible." General Bai was deeply aware how serious this matter was. This area had already been blocked off, and the top priority now was to get rid of Human Devil Xia Lixing!</p>

    <p>What was worse was that since coming here, they hadn't found any traces of Human Devil. This was an absolutely cunning enemy; if they didn't get rid of him, who knew what would happen.</p>

    <p>General Bai contacted the command center again. "Command center! We have yet to find traces of Human Devil Xia Lixing - please triangulate his position again!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The truth was that at that very moment, a black shadow was quietly following Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>After Human Devil was resurrected, he urgently needed a young body brimming with energy to become complete, and his target was none other than the ten individuals from Number 60 High.</p>

    <p>To be exact, his main target was Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>For some reason, Xia Lixing sensed that the aura on the body of this young man with the dead fish eyes was extremely tasty, far beyond that of his peers. Although everyone was of the same age in the group, their bodies in the end were essentially different.</p>

    <p>As a well-rounded young man in the aspects of morality, intelligence, physique, beauty, and labor, the reason why Wang Ling's flesh was so nice was very simple.</p>

    <p>It was because he slept and got up early, he didn't drink soda, and he didn't stay up late...</p>
