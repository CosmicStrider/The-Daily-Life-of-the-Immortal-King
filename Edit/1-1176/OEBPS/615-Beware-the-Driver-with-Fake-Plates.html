  <h1>Chapter 615 Beware the Driver with Fake Plates!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Personalized hashtags were initially intended to draw people closer together, and just being open on the community platform was good for interpersonal communication; it was good to make more friends as you went out in the world. But the problem was that this was a car-hailing app, not a social app. Lord Diulei had reminded Xiao Yin of this earlier when the latter had downloaded the app.</p>

    <p>Just as Xiao Yin reached the villa estate entrance, Lord Diulei texted him once again. "Brother Xiao, be careful when you're out. If anything happens, contact me at any time."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin stared at the text message and smiled with a pure expression in his eyes as he immediately replied, "Don't worry, how can there be that many bad people in this world?"</p>

    <p>"It's still better to be careful!" Lord Diulei's main worry was that Xiao Yin's identity would be exposed; it had nothing to do with safety issues at all since Xiao Yin's overall combat ability was much stronger than his! What Lord Diulei was afraid of was that Xiao Yin would carelessly give himself away.</p>

    <p>In fact, Lord Diulei realized that each time Xiao Yin went out without anyone else, he would get a bad feeling. For example, the first two times Xiao Yin had gone out alone, he had inexplicably ended up at the police station.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing was that it was the same police station every time — Anning District Cultivation Police Station, Songhai city. Once Xiao Yin was there, he would stir up the entire station so that it wasn't peaceful<sup>1</sup>.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The joke is that Anning means 'peace.')</dfn>

    <p>After waiting at the entrance for a while, Xiao Yin saw a Didi Shun Feng spirit car slowly drive over. He checked the license plate number on the app and frowned.</p>

    <p>Song A00544?</p>

    <p>The number was wrong!</p>

    <p>The license plate number given in the app was Song A: 44944<sup>2</sup>...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(The pinyin for the first 'songʼ character is from Songhai. The second 'song' character here means "to send .. ")</dfn>

    <p>But it seemed like this was currently the only Shun Feng car nearby, and Xiao Yin promptly felt something wasn't right.</p>

    <p>The driver was a baldie. As soon as he saw Xiao Yin, he rolled down the window and stuck his arm out as he greeted him. "Beauty, get in!"</p>

    <p>"Your license plate isn't right..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin stared at the bald driver. "Also, I'm a boy!"</p>

    <p>"Ah, Mr Yin, I'm so sorry. You're so cute you're like a girl." The driver gave a very sly smile. "Actually, whether a boy or a girl, any kid who gets in my car is definitely a cutie. My surname is Liu. Today just happens to be my birthday. If sir decides to get on, it'll be a free ride."</p>

    <p>There was no such thing as a free lunch in this world. A small Yang's Braised Chicken Rice meal would cost you fifteen HNY! Besides, when the Yang's Braised Chicken Rice was sent over in many cases, the chicken portions were very small and it was mostly bones, chicken skin, potatoes and green peppers...</p>

    <p>It cost three thousand HNY to take a taxi from Wenxian Garden to the flagship spirit beast store downtown, and this driver was actually offering him a free ride? It might be that the other party had some ill intentions toward him... However, as long as he got in, he could save three thousand HNY!</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin struggled for a moment.</p>

    <p>Knowing that the driver had bad intentions toward him...</p>

    <p>Should he get on or not?</p>

    <p>That was the question!</p>

    <p>After a while, Xiao Yin still decided to open the door and get in. Whether the driver had bad intentions or not, as long as he took Xiao Yin to his destination, it would be fine!</p>

    <p>In any case, this driver was just at the Golden Core stage and couldn't do anything to him...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When he opened the door, Xiao Yin took a look out of the corner of his eye. In the rearview mirror, he saw this unscrupulous Didi spirit car driver with the surname Liu curl his lips at Xiao Yin taking his bait.</p>

    <p>"Mr Yin? Let me confirm your destination, you're going to the flagship spirit beast specialized equipment store downtown, is that right?" Liu Zhenhua, the driver, asked cautiously.</p>

    <p>"That's right." Xiao Yin nodded. "How long will it take from here? Two hours?"</p>

    <p>"It won't take two hours, we'll get there in an hour. I can take a shortcut." The driver chuckled. "Mr Yin, are you going to the spirit beast specialty store because you're raising a spirit beast at home?" Most people had the impression that those who raised spirit beasts usually didn't have very high realms.</p>

    <p>"Hm, that's right."</p>

    <p>"How many spirit beasts? Are they strong?"</p>

    <p>"Not bad..."</p>

    <p>The driver kept asking questions, and Xiao Yin realized right away that the driver was trying to sound him out.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin's aura was usually restrained and he maintained it at the late Foundation Establishment stage as he hid his true realm. When this Driver Liu arrogantly perceived Xiao Yin's fake realm, his smile became even more pleased.</p>

    <p>So had he picked up high quality goods today?</p>

    <p>Driver Liu couldn't resist sticking out his tongue to lick his lips. Xiao Yin sat in the back and feigned ignorance, but he saw this scene.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin suddenly had an urge.</p>

    <p>He wanted to cut out this obscene man's tongue...</p>

    <p>After asking his questions, Driver Liu was excited as he stepped on the gas and drove swiftly forward.</p>

    <p>This Mr Yin behind him had skin as fair as a porcelain doll's. In any case, whether it was a boy or a girl didn't matter. Driver Liu's heart was roused with evil desire. And most importantly, not only was this person not very strong, he also actually lived in an upscale villa estate like Wenxian Garden.</p>

    <p>This Mr Yin was very likely a kid from a rich family!</p>

    <p>He had really picked up a treasure today. Driver Liu felt that he could do whatever he wanted to this "Mr Yin" first and then hold him for ransom from his family! To slate his lust and get money at the same time was just too good to be true!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, Wang Ling heard a piece of gossip about Didi spirit cars during the morning self-study. The news on this matter would only be reported at noon, but Guo Hao had already gotten firsthand information from his uncle.</p>

    <p>"Guys, do you know, recently there's a pervert called Bi Mad Devil who's a Didi spirit car driver and whose victims are his passengers. He rapes them first and then holds them for ransom. Furthermore, whether he gets the money or not, he still kills his hostages. This man's ruthless, and he really makes people mad; a number of Golden Core cultivators have already fallen into his trap," Guo Hao said.</p>

    <p>Su Xiao couldn't help shivering. "Luckily I don't take taxis... This is too scary."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao tsked. "That's not the scariest part. Do you know why he's called Bi Mad Devil? It's said that this man doesn't choose his passengers based on gender; the only requirement is that they're good-looking, whether they're male or female."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao was alarmed. "There's this kind of operation?! Then wouldn't I be in danger..."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao looked at Chen Chao and smiled. "Chao, I'm not trying to put you down... Your looks are alright, but the people he chooses are basically slim, soft and delicate; he doesn't want Africans."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "..."</p>

    <p>Saying this, Guo Hao then added, "Someone like Wang Ling would be a perfect fit."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "???"</p>
