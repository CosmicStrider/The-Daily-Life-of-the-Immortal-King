  <h1>Chapter 727 Summon Platelets!!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The Cells At Work Spell was a forbidden skill that many people had never even heard of.</p>

    <p>After the completion of the hand seal, all the people inside the underground barrier saw a layer of curse seals slowly rise out of Lord Anxiang's arm, and he then quickly bit his index finger to draw a summoning array on the ground.</p>

    <p>The magic array wasn't large, but a lot of people present were confused by its configuration, as it was a mix of Eastern runes and Western curse seals.</p>

    <p>Some people surmised that this spell was probably an Eastern and Western fusion, or that it was a Western spell which had been localized.</p>

    <p>He reduced his lifespan to split off a portion of his cells, and activated them again in another summoning...</p>

    <p>This sort of technique was truly astonishing.</p>

    <p>Several dozen seconds after the array was formed, a crack suddenly appeared in the ground, and dark red blood actually slowly bubbled up out of the crack like a fountain of blood.</p>

    <p>This fountain of blood then quickly retreated, leaving behind a blood shadow which gradually coalesced to become a cute little lolita dressed in red frilly clothes in front of everyone's eyes.</p>

    <p>"This is..."</p>

    <p>"That's right, this is a platelet from my body." The man called Dark Fragrance said, "It takes a certain amount of time to summon cells for battle, so we have to call on the platelets first and have them build an even more solid line of defense in order to buy us time to summon the white blood cells and the macrophages to fight."</p>

    <p>So that was it!</p>

    <p>Everyone immediately understood.</p>

    <p>As expected of Lord Anxiang! As a Red A-Class Dark Network wanted criminal, he might not be on par with Red 3S-Class wanted criminals like the Old Devil, the Master of Immortal Mansion, and Evil Sword God, but he had a lot more experience in terms of battle strategy!</p>

    <p>Besides, this platelet which he had summoned was so cute!</p>

    <p>Just like one's own daughter!</p>

    <p>Everyone present inexplicably felt a fatherly impulse...</p>

    <p>If they survived this time!</p>

    <p>They would definitely raise a daughter!</p>

    <p>Seeing these people stare at the platelet, Dark Fragrance spoke again. "Next, I'll use my platelet as the parent. You will need to rely on the parent to execute a secondary separation spell, which is much easier to carry out than the original spell. Please make sure you remember what the secondary array looks like."</p>

    <p>"Okay!" The eleven Night Chief members all nodded.</p>

    <p>At that moment, someone asked again, "Lord Anxiang, will our platelets also be as cute as yours?"</p>

    <p>"Well... since each person's body is unique, the appearance of the summoned platelets may vary. This is largely related to the body's usual health. If you stay up too late for prolonged periods and are on the verge of falling sick, the platelets you summon may appear abnormal."</p>

    <p>After saying that, Dark Fragrance saw how some people couldn't help trembling.</p>

    <p>Several of them put their palms together as if they were praying. "Ah! Great cultivation god, please bless me with a cute platelet! I promise that I won't recharge my Timi anymore <sup>1</sup> !"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>While the eleven Night Chief members were hiding underground with Dark Network member Dark Fragrance, Evil Sword God was carefully searching for their whereabouts.</p>

    <p>A few minutes ago, their auras had all vanished in a flash.</p>

    <p>"Escape? You think you can escape?"</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God looked at the tanghulu of heads which he had stringed together with invisible sword qi in his left hand and licked his lips.</p>

    <p>If he wasn't limited to just sixty percent of his original strength, his Purple Investigative Demon Eyes would have already uncovered these people even if they had fled to the ends of the earth.</p>

    <p>It was just a little more troublesome now.</p>

    <p>"No one can hide from me..." Evil Sword God slowly closed his eyes and raised the tanghulu in his left hand to the sky. At that very moment, all of heaven and earth was quiet, and it was as if he was feeling for something.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Master of Immortal Mansion Cheng Yu stood on a cliff in the distance, and he narrowed his eyes slightly at Evil Sword God who was hovering in the air.</p>

    <p>He was looking for killing intent...</p>

    <p>Cheng Yu knew that this was the special skill which had made Evil Sword God famous, and it wasn't a spell.</p>

    <p>It was a special perception technique that could only be built up by those who had spent years walking on the edge of hell... By grasping killing intent under this vast sky, they could lock onto their opponents.</p>

    <p>As long as you stood on opposite sides on the battlefield, there would always be killing intent. No matter how well hidden it was, killing intent couldn't be erased.</p>

    <p>Especially in a situation where you already knew who your opponent was... once you got hold of their killing intent, you just needed to exclude the people on your side, and the rest would without doubt be the enemy.</p>

    <p>So this was Evil Sword God...</p>

    <p>The Master of Immortal Mansion was scared witless when he saw this.</p>

    <p>This was only sixty percent of Evil Sword God's fighting strength... if he was at his peak, how much more terrifying would he be?</p>

    <p>Moreover, there was a sharp difference between the Evil Sword God with his soaring ego when he had eyeshadow on and the weak-looking Evil Sword God in prison.</p>

    <p>Given this contrast, Cheng Yu didn't think it was too much to describe Evil Sword God as a monster...</p>

    <p>Cheng Yu lifted his sword and dialed his focus up to the max, then let go of the military spirit sword in his hand to slowly float behind him as if it had a spirit.</p>

    <p>So far, he had only caught some small fry, while the special Dark Network members worth five hundred points were now playing hide-and-seek.</p>

    <p>But Cheng Yu also had his own way of finding them - and that was just to follow Evil Sword God from behind.</p>

    <p>His best move was the "Thousand Li Sword Art," which allowed him to control a spirit sword across very long distances to behead the enemy.</p>

    <p>Although this was quite unscrupulous behavior, a steal kill was indeed a feasible method at the moment.</p>

    <p>There weren't many points for this operation, but many little drops would make an ocean; every little bit counted, and could be used as bargaining chips in the future to get his prison sentence shortened.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Cheng Yu saw Evil Sword God in the air slowly open his eyes and fix his gaze on a piece of land ten li away. "Hiding underground? Only children go underground..."</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God had already tracked down that bunch who had escaped his grasp.</p>

    <p>But just as he was about to collect their heads, the whole of the fake remains unexpectedly started to tremble at that very moment.</p>

    <p>An earthquake?</p>

    <p>Evil Sword God and Cheng Yu were both puzzled. Everything here was fake, including the elements of nature... logically speaking, it wasn't likely for an earthquake to happen unless it was man-made.</p>

    <p>When the two of them were pondering this, the ground which Evil Sword God had been eyeing suddenly cracked open with a rumble...</p>

    <p>A humanoid monster stained with blood and tens of meters tall like Godzilla crawled out of the ground!</p>

    <p>Everyone was shaken by this scene.</p>

    <p>All the Huaxiu Alliance cultivators paused in their pursuit; even across such a great distance, they could sense the aura of this blood-red monster.</p>

    <p>"What is that?"</p>

    <p>"Could it be a blood demon? But... how can a blood demon show up here?"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, inside the underground barrier set up by the Night Chief members, Lord Anxiang was also startled by the blood-red monster.</p>

    <p>A dozen or so people stared at a fatty in unison... because this blood-red monster was none other than this fatty's platelet...</p>

    <p>"Lord Anxiang... This is..."</p>

    <p>How could this be a platelet?</p>

    <p>It was too different to the cute little lolita Lord Anxiang had summoned!</p>

    <p>Wasn't this a cerebral blood clot?</p>

    <p>At that moment, everyone received a grim reminder that they lived in fear of giants <sup>2</sup> ...</p>
