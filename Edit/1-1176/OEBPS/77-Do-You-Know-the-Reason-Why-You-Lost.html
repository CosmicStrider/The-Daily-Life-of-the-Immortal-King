  <h1>Chapter 77 Do You Know the Reason Why You Lost? </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Sun Yu's eyes were fixed on the two muscular men in front of her.</p>

    <p>Although she hadn't been able to reach the Foundation Establishment stage, she had at least learned to use her spiritual senses. Surprisingly, she hadn't sensed the auras of these two strong men at all when she had been pacing back and forth at the door of the Wang family's small villa... this was enough to show that these two men were far stronger than she was...</p>

    <p>Furthermore, facing two big bald heads would make anyone feel strongly oppressed. Yet from their faces, these two bald, strong men seemed very straightforward and honest.</p>

    <p>Sun Yu didn't bother to ask these two people whether they recognized her, because she felt they were absolutely not ordinary men. One was dressed like Iron Man, the other in a red vest with a straw hat on his head <sup>1</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This character is Luffy, from the Japanese manga and anime series 'One Piece,' who ate a Devil's Fruit that gave him the properties of rubber, i.e. he can stretch out his entire body like plasticine, and is immune to most electric-based attacks.)</dfn>

    <p>If they were her fans, they wouldn't have such strange tastes!</p>

    <p>"Elder brothers, I just came to deliver something, I'll leave right after."</p>

    <p>"What is it? Constipation pills?" Like security inspectors, the two bald strong men stared closely at the storage bag in Sun Yu's hand.</p>
    
    <p>The man dressed as Iron Man said, "Because of people who wanted quicker chapter updates, we've gotten razor blades in the mail before, missile deliveries, and once, an APTX4869 capsule <sup>1</sup>, which almost led to disaster ... so this young lady, please cooperate with us. You can't enter. If you have delivered something here, let us examine it first before we decide whether to let it through."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(APTX4869 is the name of a fictional poison in the Japanese manga and anime series 'Detective Conan.')</dfn>

    <p>...What the hell was all this about?! Why the fuck were people sending missiles?! What was in this villa that could draw so much hate?!</p>

    <p>Sun Yu pointed helplessly at the storage bag. "Do you know Huaguo Water Curtain Group? This storage bag contains tonics which were all produced by our group. Youth-retaining and moisturizing elixirs, Xuanhuang detoxification pills, Eight Immortals health pills..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, the two big men went wide-eyed. "Oh! You really did send over constipation pills!"</p>

    <p>...Fuck!</p>

    <p>Sun Yu took a deep breath. "How do I get in?"</p>

    <p>"Not until our Lord has finished studying."</p>

    <p>She gnashed her little canines. "Then what if I force my way in?!"</p>

    <p>"Then we'll do everything in our power to stop you from breaking into the house without hurting you..."</p>

    <p>"Miss, why don't we come back another day?"</p>

    <p>From behind, the old butler had seen Sun Yu stopped by the two muscular men and had promptly come to her rescue.</p>

    <p>But in the end, Sun Yu was Sun Yu, spoiled since birth and also an idol... two mere servants trying to shut me out? How dare you!</p>

    <p>"Tch, what's there to be afraid of, I have you, don't I?!"</p>

    <p>Her mouth twisted with extreme disdain.</p>

    <p>The old butler broke out in a sweat. He also had a cultivation realm and furthermore was a master at the Golden Core stage. But he was so awed by the auras of these two men that it made him weak in the knees... intuition told the old butler that on no account should they stir up trouble with them... one glance was enough for him to know that these two were not ordinary people; their auras were very unusual and didn't seem human.</p>

    <p>"Let's see how you'll be able to stop me!"</p>

    <p>The cute girl in the Arale cap tried raising her voice to make herself appear more powerful and intimidating. But in that childish tone, her yell was just funny. The pen and the eraser who had turned into these two bald men smiled as they completely dismissed the practically non-existent fluctuations in her aura.</p>

    <p>"You dare look down on me?"</p>

    <p>Furious, the girl straightaway took out a small blue pill from the small satchel at her waist and popped it into her mouth.</p>

    <p>On the side, the old butler was shocked. "Miss! Don't!"</p>

    <p>But just as he said it, the girl had already swallowed the pill.</p>

    <p>This was the zoomorphic pill, which had been refined with the gene extract of a spirit beast. A person who swallowed it would enter beast mode for a period of time; all aspects and functions of the body would be greatly improved while they retained their intelligence. But it often also had a certain side effect: the pill boosted stamina by draining it in advance from the body, so after the effects faded, a person would fall into a weakened state for the next ten days or so.</p>

    <p>The old butler sighed slightly, knowing that Sun Yu was really angry.</p>

    <p>The zoomorphic pill which she had swallowed contained the gene extract of the six-winged thunder leopard and it started working as soon as she swallowed it. Faint leopard markings swiftly appeared on the young girl's white, perfect skin, and even her ears changed into round leopard ears. Her strength was almost immediately boosted to the Foundation Establishment stage. The six-winged thunder leopard's most lethal weapon was its thunder and lightning attribute; additionally, one swipe of the transformed girl's claws would cause paralytic pain, even for a Golden Core cultivator!</p>

    <p>"Hmph!"</p>

    <p>With a snort, the girl who had completely transformed into beast mode stretched out her fingers, and her neatly trimmed, rounded fingernails suddenly turned into sharp leopard claws; with one step, she easily leapt onto the outer wall of the Wang family's small villa.</p>

    <p>"It appears that the pill had the gene extract of the six-winged thunder leopard, strengthening the four limbs and greatly improving agility and speed. The thunder leopard's thunder and lightning attribute is also very troublesome..."</p>

    <p>However...</p>

    <p>After consulting together, the two muscular men instantly blurred like afterimages that directly disappeared.</p>

    <p>"Damn it!"</p>

    <p>Before the girl could react, the two strong men had already appeared above her head. The one wearing a straw hat grabbed tightly onto her four limbs. Sun Yu was dumbfounded when she realized that the six-winged thunder leopard's thunder and lightning power had no effect on this man at all!</p>

    <p>As a result, before she reached the windowsill on the second floor, she was hauled down by two strong men together from the wall...</p>

    <p>"Just give up..."</p>

    <p>The bald man dressed like Iron Man said to the girl, "From my observation, the maximum velocity of your once-off vertical leap was only V1 = 16m/s, so I just needed to jump at a velocity of V2 = 18m/s for greater height and take action against you at a falling velocity of V3 = 8.25m/s. But because my Lord advocates peace, we didn't go all out this time, and only used stop measures. As we said before, we won't hurt you and we're asking you to stop trying to force your way in. When you leave, remember to read and study more... lack of knowledge is probably the reason why you lost.</p>

    <p>"Oh, by the way, young lady, just to let you know, this brother eraser with the straw hat next to me is a rubber man, so he's insulated from the thunder and lightning power of your beast form. Young girl, we ask that you please leave. The quicker you change back from your beast form, the better; the longer you stay in this form, the longer your recovery period will be later on."</p>

    <p>The rubber man next to him nodded. "As for those constipation pills, if the young lady wants to leave them here, we will definitely let our Lord know, and we thank you for your kindness."</p>

    <p>Sun Yu: "..."</p>

    <p>Old butler: "..."</p>
