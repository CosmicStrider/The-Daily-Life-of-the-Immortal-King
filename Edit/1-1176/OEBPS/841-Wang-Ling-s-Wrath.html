  <h1>Chapter 841 Wang Ling's Wrath</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Few people could endure level 50, as the amount of electricity it produced was lethal. Although Soul Formation cultivators would narrowly survive, in that moment, they would feel like dying. Less than ten people had endured this level before, and some of them were quite renowned.</p>

    <p>The treatment center didn't have a one hundred percent success rate, but it held at ninety-seven percent. so there were some cases where the treatment had failed.</p>

    <p>Like a novelist Yang Huai remembered several years ago, who for days on end only updated once a day, and was sent to Treatment Room Number 13 through bribes from a reader. But his skin was so thick that the electricity couldn't pass through it, and in the end Yang Huai could only give up.</p>

    <p>Or yet another novelist who went out every day to collect material for his writing, leading to mental exhaustion and an unhappy married life. He was also sent to Treatment Room Number 13, but in the end, the electric stimulation activated his meridians, and even fixed his impotence...</p>

    <p>Or in yet another example, there was a very good dancer who insisted on going into singing, but was terrible at it. Through crowdfunding by his fans, he was sent to Treatment Room Number 13. After the treatment, he unexpectedly became the king of electronic music and gained a crazy number of fans as well as the nickname "little prince of electronic music"...</p>

    <p>But since last year, things like these rarely happened, because every patient was strictly selected based on their profile; Yang Huai wouldn't take in those with higher realms who would be resistant to the treatment.</p>

    <p>Most of the patients in the treatment center now were ordinary people, and only a few were at the Foundation Establishment stage.</p>

    <p>Hence, Guo Feng's case was a surprise to Yang Huai. This was just an ordinary person, but he was able to withstand the treatment again and again.</p>

    <p>Thus, the level 50 electric charge pierced Wang Ling's skin and flowed into his body.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's eyebrows finally twitched slightly.</p>

    <p>He could feel the non-stop flow of heat in his body increase.</p>

    <p>This was...</p>

    <p>Too comfortable...</p>

    <p>The strength of this massage was just right for Wang Ling, but it still wasn't as good as the lightning punishment of the Heavenly Dao Thunder Calamity, which was pretty fierce. Wang Ling recalled gradually awakening as a child, and after he was done slowly accumulating the Three Thousand Great Dao, he had triggered the thunder calamity. But it was very strange - the lightning didn't hit him, and instead seemed to be giving vent to something...</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling had still used his own power to draw the lightning of Heavenly Dao back so that it would hit him since he wanted to know what it felt like to be struck by lightning.</p>

    <p>He still remembered that feeling to this day.</p>

    <p>Ordinary cultivators feared the Heavenly Dao Thunder Calamity as the odds of dying were very high. Cultivators could generally withstand about twenty lightning strikes, which was the limit of the calamity. If their luck was bad, the number of lightning strikes might exceed this figure, and the odds of dying would increase dramatically.</p>

    <p>In the end, failing to pass the calamity meant disintegrating into fine powder or being reduced to grilled pig's feet.</p>

    <p>At level 50 of the electrotherapy, Wang Ling's expression remained unchanged.</p>

    <p>"That's impossible..." Yang Huai widened his eyes, and was about to ramp up the strength of the medical device.</p>

    <p>But at that moment, Wang Ling unexpectedly sat upright. With a light tug, he directly snapped off the titanium cuffs and fetters. Crumpling them like paper in front of Yang Huai and his men, he reduced them to fine iron dust.</p>

    <p>"Game over," Wang Ling said telepathically.</p>

    <p>A voice that struck the soul boomed in everyone's chests, like the toll of an old temple bell.</p>

    <p>"Grab him!" Yang Huai ordered.</p>

    <p>But these big men looked at each other in dismay, and none of them moved.</p>

    <p>They were restrained, and it felt like iron weights as heavy as tens of thousands of catties were wrapped around their legs, completely immobilizing them.</p>

    <p>There was terror on Yang Huai's face, and he was so frightened that some of his hair started to fall off. "You..."</p>

    <p>Under the other party's shocked gaze, Wang Ling took out his student ID for Yang Hai to have a look.</p>

    <p><em>Student Information: Wang Ling</em></p>

    <p><em>Gender: Male</em></p>

    <p><em>Date of Birth: December 26, 4380</em></p>

    <p><em>Class: Grade One, Class Three</em></p>

    <p><em>School: Number 60 High School, Songhai City</em></p>

    <p><em>Favorite Food: Crispy Noodle Snacks</em></p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Apart from the above information, the student ID had the educational administration's personal metal stamp of authenticity, thus verifying this student's identity.</p>

    <p>All cultivation school metal stamps carried spirit energy - although Yang Huai's realm wasn't high, he could sense it in the metal stamp.</p>

    <p>He finally understood...</p>

    <p>Why this simple treatment had failed over and over again.</p>

    <p>This guy!</p>

    <p>Wasn't Guo Feng at all...</p>

    <p>This fucking useless bunch had actually brought the wrong person!</p>

    <p>What now...</p>

    <p>Yang Huai started to back away.</p>

    <p>He had even given up on the idea of fighting already.</p>

    <p>It was obvious that there was no way he could beat this young man!</p>

    <p>He wasn't any ordinary person... A Foundation Establishment high school student actually had such tremendous power...</p>

    <p>His underlings were already immobilized, so Yang Huai's first reaction was to escape!</p>

    <p>Right after he pushed open the door to Treatment Room Number 13, he immediately grabbed a slightly foolish-looking young man with a buzz cut who was walking down the corridor. A red ribbon was wrapped around his arm, which meant that he had already gained Yang Huai's trust, and was a team leader in the treatment center.</p>

    <p>The young man held hostage was frightened. "Uncle Yang, what's wrong?"</p>

    <p>Yang Huai held the young man by his neck. This was the Eagle Claw Technique, and Yang Huai could take the young man's life with just a thought.</p>

    <p>"Do as I tell you and don't try anything, understand?" Yang Huai gazed at the young man.</p>

    <p>The young man was clearly a little frightened and couldn't help trembling. "Uncle Yang... I... I'm team leader... I'll listen to you... Don't give me an electric shock..."</p>

    <p>"Good, as long as you listen to me, Uncle Yang won't do it," Yang Huai said in a low voice, his gaze fixed unwaveringly in Wang Ling's direction.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Ling had already stepped out of the treatment room.</p>

    <p>He had anticipated this scum's next move earlier on.</p>

    <p>As expected, this person had already lost his humanity — in a situation like this, he was actually going to hold another kid's life hostage.</p>

    <p>Such a heartless and utterly inhuman bastard with no regard for life at all could actually avoid being punished by the law and lead a comfortable life until now...</p>

    <p>Where was heavenly justice?</p>

    <p>Where was Heavenly Dao?</p>

    <p>Was Heavenly Dao blind?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling asked these questions in his heart.</p>

    <p>But what he didn't know was that these three questions had actually shaken the heavens.</p>

    <p>When they heard these three questions, some of the Great Heavenly Dao started to tremble.</p>

    <p>And at these three questions, the Heavenly Dao meeting table actually sent itself flying...</p>

    <p>Strength Heavenly Dao: "Divine Table... You..."</p>

    <p>Heavenly Dao meeting table: "I respectfully take my leave — I wish all of you the best..."</p>

    <p>All the Heavenly Dao: "..."</p>
