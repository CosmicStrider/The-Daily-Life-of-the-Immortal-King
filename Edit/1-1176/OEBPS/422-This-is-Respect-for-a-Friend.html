  <h1>Chapter 422 This is â™‚ Respect for a Friend! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>In the space of one Sunday, a lot of things Wang Ling hadn't expected had happened.</p>

    <p>He thought that it was very likely because the "Great Fortune Spell" was still working.</p>

    <p>Why did Lord Diulei wind up accidentally wearing the ring on his ring finger? Why did Dharmaraja happen to notice it later when Senior Immortal gave them out? And now, because of a small misunderstanding about leaving the group, Dharmaraja was personally dropping by with crispy noodle snacks to apologize... At this thought, Wang Ling completely understood! It turned out that the crispy noodle snacks were to blame for all of this!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling secretly wiped at his sweat. Sure enough, he couldn't use the "Great Fortune Spell" casually from now on. Although he truly loved crispy noodle snacks, he couldn't let that true love cause all types of conflict and unnecessary misunderstandings.</p>

    <p>Also, Wang Ling for some reason felt that someone was constantly investigating him. He didn't need to worry given the existence of the "Great Shielding Spell," but there were times when he had something like a sixth sense for danger, and the stronger the feeling was, the clearer it was that there was a problem.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's eyelids drooped, and his gaze appeared a little heavy as he felt that something big was about to happen...</p>

    <p>But most important of all: why was his daily life always so chaotic?!</p>

    <p>He just wanted to buy <em>youtiao </em>and respectable tea eggs <sup>1</sup> in peace and go to school in peace after eating them!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The emphasis on 'respectable' here probably has to do with the controversy generated when a Taiwanese professor claimed that many mainland Chinese can't afford to buy them ..)</dfn>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On Chrysanthemum Island, after Immortal Toya's wild and blatant hints, it was clear that there was no hiding this matter any longer.</p>

    <p>Although Lord Diulei had sensed something, it had nothing at all to do with what the fellow brothers in the group were most concerned about!</p>

    <p>In the immortal car, Lord Diulei was already no longer in the mood to sightsee around Chrysanthemum Island and didn't even touch the food on the table.</p>

    <p>He blamed himself and thought that he was very stupid... It had actually taken him so long to realize, with all the signs and hints that his good brother Immortal Toya had given him, that the other man was looking for a girlfriend! Furthermore, he couldn't find just anyone to be his girlfriend because she would have to shoulder the responsibility as Chrysanthemum Island's future mistress and also take good care of Jin Shi and Yin Shi!</p>

    <p>"Senior Immortal, actually, this matter isn't as complicated as you think..." The corners of Immortal Toya's mouth twitched slightly; his thoughts were already in complete disarray.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Brother Toya, don't interrupt! I'm talking serious business here!"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was so excited that he gripped Immortal Toya's hand and said, "Brother To, you don't have to say anything else! As Jin Shi and Yin Shi's godfather, I've always wanted to do something for them!"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "Senior Immortal, it's not like that..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "I told you not to interrupt!"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "I know there were a lot of people pursuing you before, for example, Headmistress Xingye of the Seven Stars Sect. But that's in the past! You can consider that Miss Shenle I told you about earlier. If she really won't do, there is in fact a second candidate... my younger sister, Thunder Goddess."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "..."</p>

    <p>When he said this, Lord Diulei shuddered involuntarily.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya saw it happen.</p>

    <p>He had only seen Senior Immortal's younger sister, Thunder Goddess, once before, and his impression was of a forthright and open-minded cultivator who occasionally returned from abroad, with sunglasses, curly hair, a bare midriff, and low-waisted pants... This was Immortal Toya's first impression of this little sister. She lived abroad all year round, and even her elder brother Lord Diulei didn't see her much each year.</p>

    <p>'I've been trying to get my little sis to come back; if Brother Toya is willing to accept this unruly devil, that would be fantastic! That would give her a reason to come back here to live!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei spoke excitedly, while Immortal Toya's sweat flowed continuously... In all his years of alchemy, sitting in front of his furnace and baking in high temperatures, he had never sweated as much as he was sweating today!</p>

    <p>"Senior Immortal, can you let me finish speaking..."</p>

    <p>"Okay... speak, Brother Toya."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya took a deep breath, then mustered up his courage. "Senior Immortal... who gave you the ring on the ring finger of your left hand?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, this ring!" Lord Diulei hadn't expected Immortal Toya to ask this question, but since he had already made a promise to Wang Ling, there was no way he would mention Wang Ling's name.</p>

    <p>"It's from a friend of mine. He made a batch of holy weapon-grade magic rings. He gave me one, and told me to bring some back for the brothers and sister in the group."</p>

    <p>He spoke very naturally, and Immortal Toya was unable to detect anything out of the ordinary. While he was speaking, Lord Diulei gave him a magic ring. "This is for you, Brother Toya!"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya accepted the magic ring, and carefully examined it... It was really a holy weapon-grade magic ring! Looking at the workmanship and the details, he felt that this person was definitely an expert in refining weapons! The most important part of a magic ring was its color and luster, and there were too many exquisite details on this magic ring!</p>

    <p>Although the magic ring was pitch black all over in color, Immortal Toya could sense the tremendous spirit power that flowed inside it, and could genuinely feel the blood and sweat which this great smith had poured into making it!</p>

    <p>That weaponsmith must have consumed a lot of energy to create this magic ring. Although its makeup didn't seem complicated, there was a saying that "The greatest truths are the simplest." A lot of high quality magic rings that performed exceptionally weren't in fact especially outstanding in appearance. Showy magic treasures had never been the trend in the cultivation circle; it was the simple and the practical that were the real deal.</p>

    <p>After examining the magic ring for a while, Immortal Toya sighed inwardly, thinking that this was the simple truth of the matter... Actually, Senior Immortal wasn't the type of person to dupe his friends or lie to begin with.</p>

    <p>But there was one thing that Immortal Toya couldn't understand. He couldn't help asking, "Why are you wearing the magic ring on your ring finger, Senior Immortal?"</p>

    <p>"In my clan, it's a sign of respect for a gift from an important friend: we have to carry jewelry-type magic treasures on our person for seven days without taking it off, no matter what it looks like, as a sign of our respect. Wearing the ring on my ring finger of the left hand might cause a lot of people to mistakenly assume that I'm already married, but in fact, it's just etiquette in my clan," Lord Diulei explained.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya nodded. "Oh, I see..."</p>

    <p>...Never too old to learn!</p>

    <p>Then Dharmaraja's misunderstanding was really huge!</p>

    <p>After Senior Immortal left, Immortal Toya would have to think about how to clarify this entire matter!</p>

    <p>"Why do I feel like Brother Toya is very concerned about my wearing a ring on my left ring finger..."</p>

    <p>"Senior Immortal, you now stand at the forefront of the cultivation world. In the absence of any news explaining that you're married, a ring appearing on the ring finger of your left hand would inevitably create misunderstandings. Have you ever thought about applying a layer of some invisibility solution over the ring?" Immortal Toya said meaningfully.</p>

    <p>"I accept your suggestion, Brother Toya, I'll definitely do that later! It's indeed not good to cause misunderstandings!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei nodded hurriedly. "But this ring is very special to me, and I won't take it off until I've found someone I especially admire."</p>

    <p>"I also didn't expect Senior Immortal's weaponsmith friend to be so generous as to gift you with this type of high quality magic rings. This conduct is truly admirable. You can tell with one look that he must have spent a very long time refining them..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei broke into a sweat. "..." In fact, it hadn't taken long at all!</p>
