  <h1>Chapter 605 Elder Wen's Speculation</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Sage Master nodded his head. "Of course, but only if Senior Dog agrees." This request didn't surprise him at all. Why had they enacted a new law, and why had they given Elder Wen a gift that was in fact against the rules?</p>

    <p>Most of it in fact had to do with this "Senior Dog."</p>

    <p>Although this "Senior Dog" hadn't explicitly revealed its identity to Elder Wen, both Demon Saint and Sage Master felt that today's plan to mediate between the demon gods of the four territories had been a show which this "Senior Dog" and Elder Wen had put on after discussing it beforehand. Hence, everything Elder Wen had obtained was essentially thanks to Er Ha.</p>

    <p>Er Ha had anticipated earlier on that Elder Wen would look for it, but it was still startled when it heard Elder Wen himself make the request.</p>

    <p>After a moment of silence, Er Ha said heavily, "Let's chat for now. Please cast a Sound-Proofing Spell, mine is a little too powerful, and it won't be good if I'm unable to hold back my aura and destroy your Holy Pillar."</p>

    <p>When Zhenyuan heard this, his face was instantly filled with reverence. As expected of Senior Dog - even its supporting function-type spell could exhibit such power!</p>

    <p>Seeing Er Ha walk over to Elder Wen's side, Sage Master immediately understood and cast the Sound-Proofing Spell.</p>

    <p>Both Zhenyuan and Sage Master in fact wanted to listen in on the conversation but didn't dare to for fear of being noticed and then finished off by "Senior Dog"...</p>

    <p>But when Sage Master cast the spell, Zhenyuan inadvertently noticed something very interesting, and he looked curiously at Sage Master. "Do you have two energy sources in your body?"</p>

    <p>"As expected of Senior Immortal Zhenyuan."</p>

    <p>Sage Master smiled and didn't deny it. Considering the talks that would be happening later in Demon Saint's Holy Palace, he thought it would be better to be a little more candid.</p>

    <p>He bowed to Zhenyuan with his hands in front of him. "I have both a spirit energy source and a demon energy source."</p>

    <p>"As I thought, you have two cores!" Zhenyuan was curious. "Are you a half-breed?"</p>

    <p>Sage Master: "I was born with them."</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan was a little amazed. "And you could still become Sage Master like this?"</p>

    <p>"... It was the Holy Pillar that chose me back then."</p>

    <p>Sage Master: "But I don't usually use spirit energy, since there are too many restrictions on its use in the demon world. However, I can in fact use demon spells as well as the magic of cultivators."</p>

    <p>When Zhenyuan heard this, he was actually a little envious even though he too currently had two cores â€” one was a source of spirit energy and the other was the source of primordial qi which only Venerated Immortals had. But this was still no match for a person who had been born with two cores!</p>

    <p>Just think, if Sage Master cultivated into a Venerated Immortal one day and obtained three cores, wouldn't he run even faster than a CPU?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, shielded by Demon Master's Sound-Proofing Spell, Er Ha and Elder Wen faced each other. They were quiet for a long while, neither of them uttering a word.</p>

    <p>Er Ha sighed in its heart; although it had anticipated earlier on that something like this would happen, it still felt a little awkward now that the moment had truly arrived.</p>

    <p>It felt that Elder Wen had already most likely guessed its identity, but Er Ha just didn't know what to say. After all, it was very difficult to try to clearly and succinctly explain how it had switched species.</p>

    <p>Er Ha's feelings were extremely complicated as it wondered whether it should break this deathly quiet.</p>

    <p>Just as it was about to open its mouth and call Elder Wen by his original name, Elder Wen was quicker as he spoke first.</p>

    <p>He bowed to Er Ha with his hands clasped in front of him, and his tone clearly indicated the endless twists and turns he had experienced in his thoughts. "Senior Dog, did you know that not so long ago, our Tuntian Ha clan used to stand at the top of the demon world? Back then, First Generation led our clan toward establishing a territory, and that Sprout Village has always been our ancestral land."</p>

    <p>Er Ha was silent; it could roughly guess why Elder Wen was saying all this. He was trying to reel Er Ha in with memories of the past as well as to reflect on the spirits of their forefathers.</p>

    <p>But Er Ha was actually well aware that in truth, Elder Wen was still blaming it. All these years, it had thought of its homeland countless times, and just as many times recently, it had been hindered from returning by this feeble body.</p>

    <p>Er Ha finally could only acknowledge this reality.</p>

    <p>It wasn't that it hadn't wanted to return all these years, but that it had no way of doing so.</p>

    <p>Er Ha's return this time, furthermore, had been influenced by the prophetic dream which it had received, and it had gone against Little Master Ling for the first time by making the most brazen decision, more brazen than any decision it had ever made.</p>

    <p>Keeping Little Master Ling in the dark... if its little master got angry, the consequences might be even more severe than if its little master couldn't eat crispy noodle snacks...</p>

    <p>Hence, Er Ha had initially already planned everything out.</p>

    <p>Once this matter came to a satisfactory conclusion, it would humbly apologize - as long as it brought some crispy noodle snacks with it and hugged Little Master Ling's thigh properly, acted cute and gave him some licks... its little master should forgive him...</p>

    <p>"Our Tuntian Ha clan has weathered so many hardships and trials... We used to stand at the very top, but we have also dropped to the very bottom. But through all this, I have always firmly believed that there would come a day when a new king will once again lead us on the path to prosperity."</p>

    <p>Elder Wen: "I waited for many years... until one day, Tenth Generation appeared."</p>

    <p>When it heard this, Er Ha was already holding its breath and it lowered its eyes.</p>

    <p>Elder Wen: "I used to think that Tenth Generation wasn't the most gifted clan leader, but it was the most hardworking one. Not so long ago, it fully committed itself to developing our hometown, and strove to achieve its goals one by one.</p>

    <p>"Tenth Generation wasn't the strongest clan leader I'd seen. It inherited the position when it was young. Furthermore, its body had been weak and prone to illness since it was small. I was the one who showed it how to improve its physique step by step."</p>

    <p>Elder Wen recalled many things. "But even then, it had always had a strong heart and an incomparably solid faith."</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, Elder Wen sighed gloomily. "Perhaps Tenth Generation's biggest shortcoming was how naive it was. In the great war between the human world and the demon world back then, Tenth Generation stood too close to the front and was pushed out from behind by the other demon kings to charge and break through enemy lines... then, it never returned.</p>

    <p>"After so many years, I'm already used to days without a king. After Tenth Generation's departure, I wasn't in a hurry to set up a new king... because I have believed all along, that Tenth Generation is still alive."</p>

    <p>Er Ha was already a little teary as it did its best to hold the tears back. "Elder Wen... what do you want to know?"</p>

    <p>At that moment, Elder Wen's expression was suddenly serious as he slowly turned around and fixed his gaze on Er Ha. " <em>Wang <sup>1</sup> </em>..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Means 'king.')</dfn>

    <p>At this "wang," all sorts of feelings welled up in Er Ha's heart.</p>

    <p>But before it could respond, Elder Wen continued, " <em>Wang ba dan <sup>2</sup> </em>!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(The pinyin for 'bastard..')</dfn>

    <p>Er Ha: "???"</p>

    <p>Elder Wen: "Senior Dog, don't misunderstand, I'm not cursing you. I'm cursing Tenth Generation that bastard..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "???"</p>

    <p>Elder Wen: "I saw you use our clan's exclusive Swallowing Spell, so I surmise that you must have met our Tenth Generation. Also, I can sense Tenth Generation's shadow on senior, so presumably Senior Dog is very familiar with Tenth Generation..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha hadn't expected this line of thinking from Elder Wen at all!</p>

    <p>With a very solemn expression on his face, Elder Wen gazed grimly at Er Ha. "If it's possible, can Senior Dog tell me where on earth Tenth Generation that bastard is fooling around..."</p>
