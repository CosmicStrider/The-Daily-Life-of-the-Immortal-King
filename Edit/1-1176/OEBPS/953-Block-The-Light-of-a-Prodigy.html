  <h1>Chapter 953 Block The Light of a Prodigy</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Xiaoling stood in front of Father Chen, looking nervous. After all, this was her first time, and Chen Chao was already prepared for Wang Xiaoling's training sword to be sent flying by Father Chen. She was a girl; what strength did she have?</p>

    <p>Holding the wooden sword horizontally in front of him, Father Chen carefully pulled back his strength. After all, he was at the Foundation Establishment stage. Xiaoling had a good root bone, but she had never had the opportunity to cultivate before. She had close to an ordinary person's physique now, and wasn't even at the Body Condensation stage.</p>

    <p>If he didn't control his strength, his aura alone could rebound on Xiaoling, so he always reminded himself to be careful to hold back during training.</p>

    <p>"Come, Xiaoling," Father Chen called out to Wang Xiaoling.</p>

    <p>Copying Chen Chao's pose just now, Wang Xiaoling raised high the sword in her hand and slashed down at Father Chen's wooden sword, which was held out horizontally.</p>

    <p>And then...</p>

    <p>There was no "and then."</p>

    <p>Under Father Chen's and Chen Chao's stupefied gazes, the training sword and the wooden sword collided with a "bang"!</p>

    <p>Father Chen's wooden sword was actually cut into two by Wang Xiaoling's slash...</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Father Chen stared at the sword hilt in his hand and drew in a breath of cold air.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "Dad, this is..."</p>

    <p>For a brief moment, Chen Chao and his father felt suffocated by this unexpected situation.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, inside Wang Xiaoling's body, also sank into silence.</p>

    <p>He had overlooked one possibility...</p>

    <p>He had possessed Wang Xiaoling's body with the King's Eye and magical ability. Even if Wang Xiaoling didn't have a realm, Wang Ling's surplus aura and strength would spill into the body. Even if only a little spilled out, it wasn't something that a Foundation Establishment cultivator could withstand.</p>

    <p>Wang Xiaoling didn't have a realm, but that sword slash just now in fact had Wang Ling's aura mixed into it...</p>

    <p>All this time, Father Chen had been saying that Wang Xiaoling's root bone was pretty good, which had actually puzzled Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Because Wang Xiaoling was actually just an ordinary girl, and didn't have any sort of root bone at all...</p>

    <p>But now that this farce had happened, Wang Ling finally understood.</p>

    <p>What "good root bone"...</p>

    <p>Father Chen had clearly mistaken Wang Ling's overflowing aura for Wang Xiaoling's, and mistakenly thought that she was a very gifted girl!</p>

    <p>So, no matter how reluctant Wang Ling was to admit it, from the moment Father Chen invited Wang Xiaoling into the Chen family, Wang Ling had already changed Chen Chao's memory...</p>

    <p>Would this affect the future?</p>

    <p>What would Chen Chao's future be like because of this change?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling worried inwardly.</p>

    <p>He had no other choice...</p>

    <p>He could only continue to watch Chen Chao's memory unfold for now.</p>

    <p>If things got too out of hand, he could only bribe Time Heavenly Dao with a crispy noodle snack to tamper with time and set it back to when he had just been about to do his homework the day before...</p>

    <p>But that would add another day to his boring summer vacation.</p>

    <p>This was the sort of mystical creature man was.</p>

    <p>In school, he longed for the holidays, but when he was on holiday, he was bored, and wondered when school would start again...</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought it was still better for him to wait and see first.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Therefore, because of this little accident on the first day of sword training for Chen Chao and Wang Xiaoling, the training program ended way before what Father Chen had planned... because the wooden sword he used to coach with was cleanly split in half by Wang Xiaoling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling actually had considered whether he should move to possess someone else, but his aura spilling over was something that couldn't be avoided.</p>

    <p>Even if he did possess another person, their aura would also leak.</p>

    <p>Now, there were already changes in Chen Chao's memory of the event because of Wang Ling being in Wang Xiaoling's body. If he switched to another person at this point, the situation would only get even messier...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Tired out by the whole day, Xiaoling went to sleep that night. Inside Xiaoling's body, Wang Ling continue to observe Chen Chao's memory with his spiritual senses. He was a little impatient, and directly fast forwarded the plot at twice the speed...</p>

    <p>The lights in the main hall of the dojo were still on. Father Chen and Chen Chao were still up.</p>

    <p>Because of Wang Xiaoling's sudden "awakening," Father Chen was seriously formulating a follow-up training program not only for Xiaoling, but also for Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>Father Chen had only thought before that Xiaoling had a good root bone; never had he expected to take in a once-in-a-century prodigy by some serendipitous stroke of fate. The most important thing to do with a prodigy was to do your best to guide them down the right path. Father Chen would do whatever he could to guide Xiaoling.</p>

    <p>Father Chen: "Son, take off your training bands and give them to Xiaoling tomorrow."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao was stupefied. "..."</p>

    <p>It was too real...</p>

    <p>"Before your training, I thought that Xiaoling wouldn't be your match. Looking at today, however, there is a gap between you and Xiaoling. But you mustn't be discouraged at all, understand? You have to work harder!" Father Chen solemnly patted Chen Chao on the shoulder.</p>

    <p>"I understand, dad."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao nodded seriously. Thinking of Wang Xiaoling, he couldn't help laughing. "I never thought Xiaoling would be so awesome. Who knows what Tiger Liang will think when he finds out."</p>

    <p>"Xiaoling has a spiritless character, and because of her family, is also a little meek. Whenever she was bullied by Tiger Liang before, she didn't dare fight back. It's hard to imagine; if Xiaoling fought back, it might not be as simple as just landing Tiger Liang in the hospital..." Father Chen said to Chen Chao in a low voice. He knew what was at stake.</p>

    <p>Father Chen gave it some thought.</p>

    <p>With Xiaoling's strength, if she had retaliated against Tiger Liang back then, the grass on that boy Tiger Liang's tomb would probably be tens of meters tall now...</p>

    <p>Previously, Father Chen had planned to ask some disciples who wanted to learn sword fighting to observe and learn from Chen Chao and Xiaoling's training, but given the situation now, Father Chen thought this would be risky.</p>

    <p>From now on, Chen Chao and Xiaoling's training could only be carried out in secret once the dojo was empty.</p>

    <p>If a prodigy showed off all their abilities, they would become a tall tree that attracted the wind; Father Chen understood this.</p>

    <p>Keeping a low profile was the best protection for Xiaoling right now.</p>

    <p>"Chen Chao."</p>

    <p>Father Chen suddenly looked at Chen Chao and called his name.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao knew that when Father Chen called him by his full name, what he was going to say was very serious.</p>

    <p>"Xiaoling's matter has to be kept secret. No one outside can know of your training with her, am I clear?" Father Chen enjoined him very seriously, and Chen Chao nodded repeatedly in agreement.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Early the next morning, there were a lot of people in the dojo; Father Chen could hear the noise from a distance.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao was chatting with some of the disciples in the dojo.</p>

    <p>All these people could be considered old clients in the dojo and were close to Chen Chao. Some of the bigger kids who were over ten or so often brought snacks and toys to give to Chen Chao. Basically, they were good friends with Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>Father Chen had barely stepped foot inside the dojo when he heard Chen Chao introduce Xiaoling to everyone in a very exaggerated tone, like Bai Zhantang in <em>My Own Swordsman </em>.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "How mighty was Wang Xiaoling! She wore a three-pronged headdress of purple gold and a red robe of Xichuan silk embroidered with a hundred flowers, and wielded a halberd exercise sword as she sat on top of her snorting horse Red Hare <sup>1</sup> ... My father, who had rushed to the front, turned to leave. Wang Xiaoling lifted the sword to chop down at my father, just like that, and with the strength of both arms, she cut him in two!"</p>
