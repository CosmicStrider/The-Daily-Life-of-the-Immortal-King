  <h1>Chapter 1032 The Female University Student Who Ghostwrites Homework</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Xiao Yin and Er Ha believed that anyone who saw these "Eight Thought-Provoking Questions" would ponder their lives deeply. For Xiao Yin, this question was actually pretty much keeping with the times, since beginning with Songhai city in recent months, citizens were moving toward separating their trash. Anyone who didn't do so would be fined! Your spirit sword might even be seized on the spot and you would have to help collect at least five kilos of trash in your city area.</p>

    <p>And so, if you saw a person sneaking around in the dead of night with a black burlap sack in their hands... it might not be a thief, but someone coming out to throw trash!</p>

    <p>If you didn't throw out the trash at this time, a row of aunties responsible for sorting out the trash would be standing outside the trash disposal room in the morning with smiles on their faces as they waited for you, each one asking, "What kind of trash are you <sup>1</sup> ?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The phrasing in Chinese 你是什么垃圾?can be read as "What sort of trash do you have?" or "What kind of trash are you?")</dfn>

    <p>"Thank you for your cooperation." Xiao Yin successfully swapped literary papers with Number 59 High's Student Shen Guangrong.</p>

    <p>Student Shen was ecstatic. "Can I also swap other homework with you?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin shot him a glance. "Do the rest yourself! Didn't your mom teach you not to be conniving or fish in troubled waters?!"</p>

    <p>Student Shen: "???"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "How can you make progress if you don't do your homework? How can you enter a top university without making progress? How can reach the pinnacle of your life and win your Miss Perfect without entering a top university?"</p>

    <p>Student Shen was then lost in deep thought once more.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin didn't think he was going too far in this regard; in any case, they had already gotten what they wanted. Being conniving was a bad thing to begin with!</p>

    <p>At the entrance to the little shop in the park, Er Ha drew a transmission magic array in a covert location. The array led to Headmaster Chen's office. After collecting the homework, they wouldn't take it with them since it would very likely draw the attention of Number 60 High teachers who were lurking nearby.</p>

    <p>Thus, when they were mapping out their strategy, Xiao Yin and Er Ha had discussed it and decided to transmit the homework over as soon as they collected it. In any case, the array for delivering items wasn't a complicated one; you just needed to know the coordinates.</p>

    <p>Stretching out a claw, Er Ha injected spiritual energy into its nail, then drew a pretty round circular array on the ground before using its nail to directly write out some characters.</p>

    <p>As everyone knew, the hardest thing about drawing an array wasn't writing the characters, but drawing the circle.</p>

    <p>It the circle wasn't round enough, the magic array wouldn't activate.</p>

    <p>Hence, drawing circles was a fundamental skill for an array master, and tested how steady his hand was to the extreme. The strength of an array master was reflected in how well he could draw a circle. A formidable array master would have a lot of ways to draw a circle; not only were the circles round enough, he could also draw them quickly.</p>

    <p>As one of the few clans in the demon world widely known as a formidable tank support Demon King clan, arrays were actually compulsory learning for the Tuntian Ha clan.</p>

    <p>Hence, Er Ha was in fact exceedingly proficient at drawing magic arrays.</p>

    <p>It took less than two minutes to draw the array, and Er Ha placed the swapped literary papers in the center. It recited a magic spell and made a seal with its paws. In a streak of golden light, the literary papers were delivered straight to Headmaster Chen's office.</p>

    <p>After that, Er Ha pawed at the ground and got rid of the magic array. After confirming the array had been dealt with, Er Ha turned to Xiao Yin and said, "Let's move on."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At noon, Er Ha led Xiao Yin to a university. A few courier brothers were fretting outside the school entrance. They didn't have time and still had other deliveries to make after this, but they couldn't contact the delivery recipients inside the university.</p>

    <p>Going over for a look, Xiao Yin saw the words on the school's stele: Songhai Magic Treasure Development University.</p>

    <p>"So this is the place..." Xiao Yin sighed.</p>

    <p>"What's up?" asked Er Ha.</p>

    <p>"This is the university I told you about yesterday, targeted by a serial killer," Xiao Yin answered in a low voice.</p>

    <p>Er Ha nodded and understood immediately.</p>

    <p>The murderer had killed through a screen, and before he was caught, the convenient express delivery transmission function had been cut off throughout the school to ensure the students' safety. Students who wanted to get their packages could only rely on the old method of getting the couriers to lay out the things at the school entrance at noon and wait for the students to come and collect them.</p>

    <p>Naturally, the biggest headache was that the names on these express items weren't the real ones... For the sake of their privacy, some students used their online pseudonyms.</p>

    <p>Thus, when Xiao Yin and Er Ha drew near, they saw several courier brothers at the school entrance shouting themselves hoarse: "I Am The Father You Can Never Have! I Am The Father You Can Never Have! Come get your express delivery!"</p>

    <p>"Crossdressing Big Shot! Crossdressing Big Shot! I have your express delivery! Come get it ASAP! I'm leaving soon!"</p>

    <p>"Oniichan! I have your express delivery!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In a few short minutes, all kinds of fancy names were called out.</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>"Are you sure the fragment is in there? This is a university." Standing at the entrance, Xiao Yin looked around. He was hesitant about going in, and wondered if Er Ha might be mistaken.</p>

    <p>"There's no mistake, it's here." Er Ha shook its head; it was very confident in its sense of smell.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin followed Er Ha inside. The security guard uncle was about to stop them, but immediately paused when he saw the medal on Xiao Yin's chest.</p>

    <p>It was the custom-made medal for team leaders of the Office of Strategic Deception. The sect was now the number one light force in Huaxiu nation in terms of overall strength, and the entire country was aware of its prestige. The security guard didn't know how high up Xiao Yin was in the Office of Strategic Deception, but after recognizing the medal, he didn't block their way.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei had given Xiao Yin this medal to prevent the latter from being taken to the police station yet again when he was out by himself on the streets; reality now proved that the medal was more useful than Xiao Yin had imagined.</p>

    <p>"The canteen up ahead." Er Ha led Xiao Yin forward. When they approached the entrance to the canteen, Xiao Yin's gaze focused on a university student who was writing at a tremendous speed.</p>

    <p>There was no doubt that this was a female student of Magic Treasure Development University, but next to her seat was a thick pile of high school exercises...</p>

    <p>"What is this?" Er Ha was bewildered at this scene.</p>

    <p>A university student doing high school homework — Xiao Yin could only think of one possibility.</p>

    <p>He slowly walked over, his gaze fixed on the long-haired girl who was absorbed in her writing. Her meal card was on the table, and with one look, Xiao Yin saw her name: Lin Shiyao.</p>

    <p>"Are you helping other people write their homework?" asked Xiao Yin.</p>

    <p>Pulling her long hair back, Lin Shiyao raised her head and shot Xiao Yin a casual glance. "Regular school exercises are 100 yuan per book, school exercises in an exact copy of your handwriting are 200 yuan a book, test papers are 100 yuan a set."</p>

    <p>After saying this, she fished out a card with a QR code on it from around her neck and placed it on the table. "Swipe the code to pay, and I'll finish all your homework today."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin and Er Ha: "..."</p>
