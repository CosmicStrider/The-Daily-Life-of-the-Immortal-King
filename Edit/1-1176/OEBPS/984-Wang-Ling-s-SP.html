  <h1>Chapter 984 Wang Ling's SP</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ming and Guo Ping had never seen so many people wearing these shadow suits before. It was very clear that all of this was premeditated.</p>

    <p>When Guo Ping called the research institute earlier, there had been screaming. The institute must have also been attacked by shadow men.</p>

    <p>But Guo Ping was puzzled. The black shadow suit was a confidential state military project. To be able to make so many of them for a military attack, the other side's background definitely wasn't ordinary.</p>

    <p>"Are they from the Dark Network or a dark force?" In a split second, various thoughts flew through Wang Ming's head.</p>

    <p>These people were fully armed and well-organized. They were able to perfectly launch surprise attacks at the same time. This wasn't something that the Dark Network or a regular dark force could do. Furthermore, almost all members of the Dark Network and dark forces that were currently on the books were under surveillance, with the cultivation police planting undercover agents in their midst.</p>

    <p>This undercover plan was also known as the "Three years ago on the rooftop and another three years after, and baby Gin is bitter there isn't a normal person around<sup>1</sup>" plan.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A mash-up of an allusion to a scene from the movie "Infernal Affairs" and to the villain Gin from "Detective Conan.")</dfn>

    <p>The plan's name sounded very long, but this was a well-placed security measure since apart from the undercover agents, no one else could repeat this name after hearing it just once, so anyone who couldn't recite it completely was a fake undercover agent!</p>

    <p>"Wang Ming... this group is very strong, we aren't their match! Also, they don't seem to be using spiritual energy..." Unlike Wang Ming, Guo Ping was at the Nascent Soul stage, but he trembled in the face of these shadow men who were also Nascent Soul cultivators.</p>

    <p>These people weren't using spiritual energy to power their spells, and this unknown element frightened the both of them.</p>

    <p>Thus, the moment this group of shadow men charged in, Wang Ming and Guo Ping instinctively hid behind Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Carrying a knife, the head of the black shadow men sneered, unaware of Wang Ling's identity. "A bunch of researchers hiding behind a teenager; how stupid can you be? But it doesn't matter - everyone here has to die!"</p>

    <p>With that, he swung the knife at Wang Ling's head. This slash was very fierce as it cut through the air so quickly that the atmosphere instantly exploded with heat and produced steam.</p>

    <p>Knife raised, head falls!</p>

    <p>But this was only what the shadow man imagined would happen.</p>

    <p>In fact, when the knife approached Wang Ling, who was in management mode, his head didn't even move. Instead, balls of firepower instantly coalesced in the King's Eye and a laser shot out, promptly reducing the knife to powder...</p>

    <p>The head of the shadow men reacted very quickly. Unlike previous villains who were instantly killed, he immediately discarded the knife and backed away the moment Wang Ling's defensive light ray shattered the blade.</p>

    <p>At the same time, a fatal sense of danger crept into his heart...</p>

    <p>"What the hell is up with this person..." The head of the shadow man broke into a cold sweat.</p>

    <p>He had no doubt that if he had hesitated just now, his entire being would have vanished alongside the blade, crushed to ash by Wang Ling's defensive light ray.</p>

    <p>"Retreat!"</p>

    <p>The head of the shadow men gave the order on the spot.</p>

    <p>Their initial plan was to exterminate all scientific researchers on a global scale. If the attack was unsuccessful, they could choose to retreat and report it to their superiors, and the organization would later specially formulate a plan to deal with the researchers they had yet to kill.</p>

    <p>The five who invaded the noodle shop had initially been very confident. Like Bai Youquan, they used their new powers to do whatever they wanted.</p>

    <p>They were at the Nascent Soul stage, but their strength was several times that of a typical Nascent Soul cultivator.</p>

    <p>That was the very reason why Guo Ping, who was also at the Nascent Soul stage, shivered when the five invaded the noodle shop.</p>

    <p>They had already locked onto Guo Ping and Wang Ming's location earlier on, but had overlooked Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was too strong, and the five people were unable to carry out the assassination plan smoothly.</p>

    <p>Thus, they planned to retreat.</p>

    <p>They activated the escape buttons on the black shadow suits. In a mere split second, these five people were reduced to clouds of shadows in the air that turned into streams of black matter as they fled in one direction.</p>

    <p>But it was already too late.</p>

    <p>At that very moment, Wang Ling's slack pupils in management mode finally focused.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was back.</p>

    <p>He was already done with his investigation. While he hadn't obtained any useful information, the memories of his management state flooded his mind the moment his soul returned.</p>

    <p>"Stay."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at the five black shadow men expressionlessly. He guessed the reason they were running was to go back and report to their organization, so he couldn't let them escape.</p>

    <p>And so, Wang Ling spread his five fingers, and the five men who were fleeing were once again caught in the air.</p>

    <p>"Ahhh!"</p>

    <p>They screamed one after another as they were pulled back through the sky like stringy cheese. Then, with five thuds, they fell to the ground, piled on top of each other.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, Wang Ling also finally sensed that the five men weren't the same as the cultivators he normally dealt with. He had used the same amount of strength as usual - enough to squash an ant - to carefully reel them in, but had felt an unprecedented resistance.</p>

    <p>As Guo Ping said, these weren't normal cultivators who used spiritual energy to power their spells; what they were using instead was an unknown energy form that was a lot more concentrated than "primordial qi."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was deeply interested at this.</p>

    <p>Because of how excessively powerful primordial qi was, Wang Ling had been constantly looking for a way to suppress it. Relying purely on the Dao talisman seal was useless; sooner or later, he would have to find a way to control this power himself.</p>

    <p>And now, an energy form far more concentrated than primordial qi had actually appeared.</p>

    <p>Then, how was this group of black shadow men controlling it?</p>

    <p>Numerous thoughts flew through Wang Ling's mind in a split second.</p>

    <p>The five men were bound with several magic rings and immediately restricted by Wang Ling's power of Heavenly Dao. Since he wasn't sure what their strength was like, Wang Ling deliberately used a little more force this time.</p>

    <p>The five men were restrained on the spot. Wang Ling clapped his hands and actually felt for the first time that catching someone was hard work. It looked like he would need to eat a few more packets of crispy noodles today to replenish his SP<sup>2</sup>...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup></sup>(Stamina points..)</dfn>

    <p>In that round just now, if a full SP bar was 100 points, he had used up a full three points! How terrible!</p>

    <p>After all, when he had dealt with Evil Sword God back then, he had only used 1 SP!</p>

    <p>Just these five Nascent Soul cultivators were already so hard to deal with; who knew what type of enemy he would encounter in the future.</p>

    <p>At that very moment, a figure covered in blood staggered into the noodle shop.</p>

    <p>"Zhai Yin!" Wang Ming cried out when he saw who it was.</p>
