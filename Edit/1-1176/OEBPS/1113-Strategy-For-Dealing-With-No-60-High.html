  <h1>Chapter 1113 Strategy For Dealing With Number 60 High!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Local high schools in Songhai city might be familiar with Number 60 High, but Number 1 Devil-Subduing High, Titan High and South Sea Sky High were all in other cities. The headmasters of these schools might have been paying close attention to Number 60 High recently, but the students only cared about their closest rivals.</p>

    <p>In other words, the students never regarded the overall Number 60 High bunch as their opponents in the first place. Even if Number 60 High had Sun Rong, the eldest daughter of Huaguo Water Curtain Group, the issue was that this was a team battle; no matter how strong an individual was, it would be very difficult for them to become the team's savior.</p>

    <p>Like Azao<sup>1</sup>, that sexy little fatty, whose dream of the world championship drifted even further away during the LOL S9 World Finals... Even gods descending couldn't help when you had crappy teammates.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Refers to League of Legends player Jian Zihao..)</dfn>

    <p>"The teacher leading the Number 60 High team this time is the headmaster himself, a man called Chen Tianxiang." Li Qingxi, Headmaster of Number 1 Devil-Subduing High, stood on a dais as he started teaching the students in the special training class. He didn't touch on the students of Number 60 High, but directly started with Headmaster Chen.</p>

    <p>Initially, Li Qingxi didn't think that Number 60 High was important, but he didn't look down on the school either. However, when he heard that it was Headmaster Chen who would be personally leading the team, he instantly panicked a little... After all, that man had tormented him harshly back then!</p>

    <p>"I know that many of you here view that group from Number 60 High as small fry, so much so that you've completely dismissed them. But let me tell you, Number 60 High is an old school which is a thousand years old, and which has also raised some talents..."</p>

    <p>Expression solemn, Headmaster Li said, "Like that Director Zhuo who has become well-known recently; he's the hero who single-handedly defeated the demon king Tuntian Ha six years ago. Furthermore, a fair number of students rushed to transfer to Number 60 High this semester. Do you still not know what this means?"</p>

    <p>"Headmaster, aren't you exaggerating?" Someone laughed. "That Director Zhuo graduated a long time ago. I have a childhood friend who's studying at Number 60 High. He said that his school's no good, and that its overall fighting strength definitely can't match ours."</p>

    <p>"Don't ever underestimate your opponent! Belittling them will only cause you to suffer!" Li Qingxi stared at this student, a little disgusted with his contempt for the weak.</p>

    <p>"Headmaster Chen Tianxiang of Number 60 High ranked top in support magic at Seven Stars Sect back then, and he has a phD in the field in the cultivation world. The support spells he designed have repeatedly won international awards, and a lot of them have been patented, earning him plenty of money."</p>

    <p>Headmaster Li said, "Moreover, one of the biggest features of his support spells is that they're quick to learn and easy to cast. As long as they're used under particular circumstances, they'll have unexpected effects. When you encounter the students from Number 60 High this time, be careful! Don't engage them head-on!"</p>

    <p>"Then let's just use the puppet technique to control all of them," said one of the students.</p>

    <p>"No." Headmaster Li shook his head. "The profound essence of support is to act at the right moment. If the enemy doesn't move, we don't move. If the enemy looks like they're about to move, we move first... If you act rashly, you'll be the only one to suffer. Furthermore, most support spells have traps. Thus, I suggest that we use passive control spells this time, like Virus Puppet."</p>

    <p>Virus Puppet.</p>

    <p>Everyone instantly understood.</p>

    <p>This was indeed an effective way to counter support spells, although using it in a national competition seemed a little too insidious.</p>

    <p>Virus Puppet could take people down very quickly; the other party just needed to be touched, and they would instantly become a "tool" for a period of time. They had to be good and obey orders, otherwise their heads wouldn't stop hurting.</p>

    <p>"Of course, in addition to using the Virus Puppet spell, I propose that we should still form alliances with other schools. Until halfway through the eight days at least, we must ensure that our Devil-Subduing members are relatively unscathed."</p>

    <p>Headmaster Li Qingxi started scheming inwardly. "Based on what Headmaster Chen Tianxiang knows of me, he'll definitely think I'll team up with someone familiar, so we'll do the exact opposite this time!"</p>

    <p>"Headmaster is saying..."</p>

    <p>"Form an alliance with Titan High! While our schools currently don't know each other very well, I've already thought it over: The students from Titan High are perfect for our 'Virus Puppet' and 'Meatball Tank' strategy this time."</p>

    <p>So there was still Meatball Tank!</p>

    <p>Everyone's eyes couldn't help lighting up when they heard this.</p>

    <p>It was true that they would be able to do a lot during the team battle with this two-spell combo. Plus, if they made it to the last stage, they could basically do whatever they wanted.</p>

    <p>With the ability to both attack and defend, a Meatball Tank under full control would not only help them retreat when they encountered danger, but could also be used to launch an attack and start a team fight.</p>

    <p>It could only be said that it was just like their Headmaster Li to actually be able to come up with such a battle strategy.</p>

    <p>"This will be our basic strategy..." While he was done with his explanation, Headmaster Li Qingxi still felt vaguely anxious for some reason.</p>

    <p>Before he became the headmaster of Devil-Subduing High, Li Qingxi clearly remembered how he had had the opportunity to fight Chen Tianxiang many times... Unfortunately, every single time ended in his crushing defeat!</p>

    <p>The uncanny thing about that man was that no matter what kind of lethal or monstrous spells Li Qingxi cast, the other side could use his Chen clan's support magic to easily neutralize them by creating tremendous force with little effort.</p>

    <p>Consequently, after formulating this strategy, Li Qingxi still felt very uneasy. He had been oppressed by Headmaster Chen so many times that he practically suffered from mental trauma and residual effects.</p>

    <p>That man's support techniques were profound, and his tactical thinking was as deep as the sea. Li Qingxi had to admit that of all the opponents he had faced before, Chen Tianxiang had been the most difficult to deal with.</p>

    <p>But it was different this time. He didn't have to act personally, because this was a competition between students.</p>

    <p>As a school headmaster, the game of tactics was also a highlight of the large-scale battle.</p>

    <p>Their Number 1 Devil-Subduing High was very famous; if they lost to Number 60 High this time, Number 60 High might rise with the momentum.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High might not have been that scary before.</p>

    <p>However, from the moment Chen Tianxiang became Number 60 High's headmaster, Li Qingxi had almost instantly included Number 60 High on his list of key concerns.</p>

    <p>He understood this man's tricks very well.</p>

    <p>Better than he understood himself.</p>

    <p>He hated Chen Tianxiang to the core; day and night, he would ponder how to deal with Chen Tianxiang.</p>

    <p>Headmaster Li skimmed through the list of school participants in the large-scale battle, and scanned the names of the Number 60 High participants.</p>

    <p>Except for Sun Rong, he didn't know any of the other students...</p>

    <p>Most of them were transfer students, and practically none of them had any achievements from any sort of cultivation competition; they had only obtained a few district prizes at most.</p>

    <p>Li Qingxi felt that there was nothing to be afraid of, yet he still felt vaguely uneasy.</p>
