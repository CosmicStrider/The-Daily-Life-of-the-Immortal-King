  <h1>Chapter 974 A New Enemy</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After the battle triggered by Devil Gut Fungus Lord on the border of Mixiu nation, new fortifications had been put up there. Although Devil Gut Fungus Lord was already dead, it had seriously contaminated the environment around the border, like a nuclear disaster, and it was a more troublesome problem that needed some time to be contained.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Devil Gut Fungus Lord's death had also gotten rid of President Bai, who had been devoured and eliminated along with him.</p>

    <p>After a purification system with automatic cleaning properties was deployed at the defense base on the border, cultivators could not longer set foot there.</p>

    <p>Outside the high wall, a young man with white hair and bursting with vigor appeared, an enigmatic smile on his face.</p>

    <p>"Mose would like to remind you that you're not allowed to enter this place; please leave in thirty seconds, otherwise the alarm defense system will be automatically activated."</p>

    <p>"Defense system?" The white-haired young man smiled. The next moment, his pupils rotated and a formidable wave of spirit power shot out to instantly burn a huge hole in the high wall.</p>

    <p>Mose let out a weak electronic voice. "Of course, it's always too much to ask humans to remain rational."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"It's there." After he entered, the young man floated up off the ground as he fixed his eyes on a particular location.</p>

    <p>It was where Devil Gut Fungus Lord had been destroyed and where the aura was the thickest.</p>

    <p>"Be revived." The young man opened his palm, and pure white light enveloped and burned the ground with a hissing sound.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>*Hiss hiss... *</p>

    <p>When Wang Ming woke up, he could clearly smell the aroma of black pepper beef. Furthermore, it seemed to fill his head, as if it was on top of him...</p>

    <p>That wasn't right; why did he smell steak?</p>

    <p>He was just about to get up, when Zhai Yin pressed him down. "Don't move!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "???"</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin picked up the steak on Wang Ming's head with a pair of tongs, then poked at it. "Tch, it's only forty percent done..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was stunned. "So you were using my forehead as an induction cooker?"</p>

    <p>"I haven't cooked for a long time since Old Qi won't let me. And after you passed out, I thought it would be a pity not to make use of this resource." Zhai Yin pointed at the steaks she had just fried which were piled on a plate on the table. "I just fried ten steaks or so, want to try them?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming wiped at his sweat. "You can keep this biochemistry weapon for yourself..."</p>

    <p>"So narrow-minded!"</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin pursed her lips and put down the beef. "You need to rest more. If you overload your brain, it's going to be a problem. Old Qi has given you half a month of leave, and you're allowed to go out in civilian clothing. During this time, I'll stick close to you."</p>

    <p>"I know." Wang Ming nodded. "And establishing contact with the aliens?"</p>

    <p>"Lao Guo and the others will handle it. After he came back, his disciples also came back, and they're very quick to do things." Zhai Yin said, "When you were unconscious, Lao Guo called and said that he went to your little brother's place but couldn't meet him. Do you know what's going on?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming patted his head; he had almost forgotten about it. He had never told Wang Ling about Guo Ping's involvement in the study of the talisman, and he had his own reasons for this.</p>

    <p>The main reason he had pulled Guo Ping into the research back then was to have him analyze the material of the talisman seal and then manufacture the talisman's main suppressive ingredient, namely the "Anti-Wang Ling Matter." Guo Ping had had his own unique reasoning and ideas when it came to analyzing this thing.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, scientific research was similar to writing, and it often needed inspiration or a different way of thinking.</p>

    <p>"I'll talk to Lao Guo myself about this later. Also, give me the dream restorer," said Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>The dream restorer was a magic treasure which Wang Ming had invented for fun; it could restore the dreams a person had in a span of twenty-four hours. The dreams people had were transient memories which they would often forget after waking up, so a dream restorer like this was very convenient.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming sometimes had dreams in which he bullied Wang Ling, and after reconstructing these dreams, he would often record and edit them into a blockbuster film that didn't even need the addition of cheap special effects!</p>

    <p>"You dreamed that you bullied your little brother again?" Zhai Yin sneered. She was already used to this bro-con's style - he had created this dream restorer just so that he could reconstruct the dreams of him bullying his little brother... Zhai Yin swore that she had never met a more perverted bro-con.</p>

    <p>"Aren't you a little too unhappy when I dream about my little brother?" Wang Ming raised his eyebrow. "When you cook in the future, you don't need to add vinegar..."</p>

    <p>"What's that supposed to mean?" Zhai Yin glared at Wang Ming like a leopard gazing at its prey.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was instantly terrified. "Never mind, it's nothing... Nowadays, people like to eat lemons, and it's actually very normal for it to be a little sour... So, you decide where we'll go tomorrow... I won't go to my little brother's place "</p>

    <p>"That's more like it." Darting a sidelong glance at Wang Ming, Zhai Yin then took out a brocade pouch and pulled the "dream restorer" out of it.</p>

    <p>As Wang Ming's bodyguard and assistant, Zhai Yin now helped him carry some of the magic treasures which he often used.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin: "Take it, I'm going to go figure out where we should go tomorrow."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "Alright..."</p>

    <p>The reason why he wanted to use the dream restorer today wasn't for any other reason but that he was very concerned about the dream he just had.</p>

    <p>Mixiu nation's purifying defense base on the border and the white-haired young man who had suddenly showed up there... Wang Ming could only vaguely remember the scene.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming actually knew about Mixiu nation building a defense base after the elimination of Devil Gut Fungus Lord; previously, a collaborative research team had even come over with questions about their design blueprint</p>

    <p>But Wang Ming had never been to this border defense base.</p>

    <p>However, the entire base had actually appeared in his dream and everything seemed so real, which made Wang Ming feel a little uneasy.</p>

    <p>He couldn't forget the smile on the white-haired youngster's face. From beginning to end, moreover, the young man had seemed a little familiar...</p>

    <p>"How strange." Wang Ming frowned - he had never had such an odd dream before.</p>

    <p>When he put on the dream restorer helmet, that dream which he had had while unconscious was reconstructed.</p>

    <p>He saw a defense base with towering walls like the Great Wall.</p>

    <p>He also saw that strange white-haired youngster who felt familiar to him in the dream.</p>

    <p>At that moment, that youngster turned around and smiled at him.</p>

    <p>He had the exact same face as Wang Ling...</p>
