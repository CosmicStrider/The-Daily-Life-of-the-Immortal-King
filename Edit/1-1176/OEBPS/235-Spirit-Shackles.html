  <h1>Chapter 235 Spirit Shackles </h1>

  <div>

    <p>General Yi was silent for a very long time.</p>

    <p>He saw that the old devil's knees were trembling, but the other person refused to kneel. He was a stubborn man who refused to do so even if he had suffered severe internal injuries.</p>

    <p>Although the old devil had committed many crimes, General Yi, who had been his opponent for a thousand years, had to admit that he was indeed a man to be respected.</p>

    <p>"Can't you change your stubbornness?" General Yi looked at the old devil and sighed deeply. "Forget it, since things are now like this, as long as you're willing to come back with me to be put on trial, it's fine even if you don't kneel..."</p>

    <p>The old devil looked up with bright eyes. "Really?"</p>

    <p>"Before you're charged, this old man will investigate her reincarnation for you. Since this is my promise to you, I'll certainly keep it. However..." General Yi lowered his eyelids, hiding his deep black pupils. With a flash of spirit light, a pair of crystal handcuffs appeared in his hand. "You have to put these on."</p>

    <p>The moment the handcuffs appeared, Wang Ling's eyes also flashed slightly, because he could sense that these handcuffs contained the same substance that was in the Dao talisman seal on his arm. Wang Ming had told him before that this substance had come from a meteorite and that it was very difficult to extract; even using the most sophisticated instruments to perform countless extractions only yielded a few micrograms of it, and even that was only after a few years.</p>

    <p>This mysterious substance in the talisman seal played a key role in restraining Wang Ling's aura.</p>

    <p>"I remember there are only two pairs of this in the whole country. You really took a lot of trouble to deal with my venerable self, with the Five Elements Great Array and the Spirit Shackles." The old devil accepted the handcuffs with a bitter smile.</p>

    <p>He didn't hesitate at all to put them on. He was so straightforward that General Yi could hardly believe it.</p>

    <p>General Yi smiled slightly. "I thought you would refuse them."</p>

    <p>The old devil: "Under the circumstances, to struggle even more would be useless. For the sake of seeing my silly wife's reincarnation sooner, I should take it easy."</p>

    <p>General Yi: "I really couldn't tell that you would actually be this infatuated."</p>

    <p>The old devil said, "When your Palm Sword injured me just now, the sword qi rolled around in my body. I used my spirit energy to resist it, but this directly numbed my peripheral nerves, so my legs can't move..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, the corner of General Yi's mouth twitched fiercely. "..." So that's the real reason why you didn't kneel?!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Between the Five Elements Great Array which in the past had been used to withstand the invasion of the demon gods from the Gate Between Worlds and these Spirit Shackles, it could be said that as the mastermind of this operation, General Yi had gone all out this time to precisely capture the old devil.</p>

    <p>It was June 15th on Wednesday in the eighth week of the semester.</p>

    <p>On this day, during the combined military training exercise organized by the six schools, the old devil put on the Spirit Shackles and was arrested. It was definitely a historical moment.</p>

    <p>After the old devil put on the Spirit Shackles, General Yi confiscated all the magic treasures which were hidden in the chaotic space, along with the Purple Gold Gourd that had helped the old devil escape repeatedly.</p>

    <p>The old devil had actually grabbed many of these magic treasures when he had attacked the museum. After taking them out one by one, there were fully twenty to thirty items, and each magic weapon had an amazing history.</p>

    <p>The Tai Chi Plate, the Book of Nine Emperors, the Treasure Tree, the Investiture Cauldron, the Chaos Flag, the Heaven-Turning Seal... these were all genuine, top-class holy weapons. Placed on the ground, they all glowed with light. Wang Ling sized them up from behind General Yi, astonished by the sight.</p>

    <p>They were lucky that the old devil hadn't regained his full strength and so didn't have the power to wield these holy weapons. Otherwise, a single person holding all these trump cards in his hand would have been truly terrifying!</p>

    <p>In addition to these six top-class holy weapons, General Yi discovered many world-renowned and special magic weapons. Because each of them had a particular distinctive trait, they hadn't been included in the rankings of orthodox magic weapons; like misshapen figurines, they fell into the category of problematic magic weapons which were no less formidable than holy weapons, but which also had side effects.</p>

    <p>As General Yi went through them one by one, he realized that there were actually a few which he didn't recognize.</p>

    <p>He found a dark golden magic chime stone and a golden lotus. The most mystical thing was that when these two magic treasures touched, they actually emitted an endless green light.</p>

    <p>General Yi looked at the old devil with some surprise. "What's this?"</p>

    <p>The shackled old devil explained, "Hm, this is the Panjin Lotus and the Ximen Chime Stone. If the green light shines for two minutes, it can make people shorter <sup>1</sup> ..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Pan Jinlian ('jin lian'
translates to 'golden lotus')
is a married woman in the
classic Chinese novel 'Water
Margin' who has an affair
with Ximen Qing ('qing'
means 'chime stone'). Her
husband is a short and ugly character, and 'to wear a
green hat' in Chinese
colloquialism means to be
cheated on ..)</dfn>

    <p>General Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Then General Yi pointed to a glowing pad and asked, "Well then... what is this? A sanitary pad? I didn't expect you to have this type of hobby. Don't tell me you've changed your gender because you're in a woman's body?"</p>

    <p>The old devil: "...This is the Sky-Mending Cloth for mending spatial cracks. Given my current body, without this Sky-Mending Cloth, I wouldn't be able to freely travel back and forth through space at all."</p>

    <p>General Yi thought that the magic treasures which he had invented were already exotic enough, but he had never imagined that there would be someone more amazing than him.</p>

    <p>He couldn't help sighing. Sure enough, there was still room for him to improve in his invention of magic treasures!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>While General Yi took inventory of the magic treasures, Immortal Toya came over to his side. He smiled slightly and offered the General heartfelt congratulations on the plan's success. "General Yi's Palm Sword is well-known; this junior is greatly honored to have seen it today."</p>

    <p>"It's not a big deal. If you want to see it again next time, send me a WeChat message. I'll cut a fruit to show you." General Yi waved his hand magnanimously.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "..."</p>

    <p>"By the way, the Five Elements Great Array was a little loud, are the students all right?" General Yi asked with some concern.</p>

    <p>"The survival contest had already been put on hold when the array was in operation. I passed along a message through the electronic illustrated handbook for them to hide inside the buildings. There are currently over eight thousand students left," Immortal Toya answered honestly.</p>

    <p>"That's good, after I take the old devil out for his trial, the competition can resume normally." General Yi nodded, then turned his eyes to Wang Ling. "Oh, by the way, let me tell you first that this kid from Number 60 High School has a very good root bone, and I intend to take him as my disciple."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Even at a distance, Immortal Toya could already sense the bitterness in Wang Ling's eyes. He felt that he had to refuse on Ling Zhenren's behalf. "General Yi, that... won't do..."</p>

    <p>General Yi frowned. "Why not?"</p>

    <p>"Because... because..."</p>

    <p>In the face of crisis, Immortal Toya stepped forward, put one arm around Wang Ling's shoulder and abruptly yanked him to his chest. "He, he's mine!"</p>

    <p>General Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>After saying that, this gray-haired handsome man glanced at Wang Ling's expression out of the corner of his eye.</p>

    <p>Uh...</p>

    <p>This guy's face had become even blacker.</p>
