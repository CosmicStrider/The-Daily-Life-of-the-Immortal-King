  <h1>Chapter 469 Xiao Yin is Dealt Critical Damage! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Looking at this data, Er Ha somehow felt that these techniques seemed a bit unreliable - first of all, the names were very strange.</p>

    <p>"Will these work? What kind of spirit techniques have names like this..." Er Ha didn't feel like typing, and instead directly pressed the voice button to chat.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin immediately replied, "These actually aren't the original names of these spirit techniques; I made them up. These spirit techniques were initially holy beast arts of the Dog clan. I've seen their ancient scrolls before, but I forgot the exact names. I only remember how to use them, you just have to make do."</p>

    <p>Er Ha couldn't help scratching its dog head as its scalp turned a little numb. "Do you have other techniques with more normal names..."</p>

    <p>"I do!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin quickly sent new data and a comment under the document: "This is an entire collection of boxing skills. It's an advanced level five spirit technique. If you can master this, you can easily take on one hundred people on your own."</p>

    <p>Level five spirit technique? Er Ha felt that at its current level, it hadn't reached the stage where it was able to learn a level five spirit technique; it had to reach first class at least before it could use a level five spirit technique, but given its current progress, it would be a long time before it could cultivate to first class.</p>

    <p>However, getting a handle on the configuration of the spirit technique in advance wasn't a bad idea. It was just like a mathematical formula: you might not be able to do a problem before you studied more advanced mathematical questions, but it was fine to recite the formula by heart.</p>

    <p>Thinking this, Er Ha clicked open this second set of data from Xiao Yin.</p>

    <p>As Xiao Yin had said, the names of the skills in this second collection were quite normal.</p>

    <p>However, because they had been using voice to chat, it was only now that Er Ha noticed that the "boxing skills" Xiao Yin had mentioned was actually "dog skills <sup>1</sup> "...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>('Boxing' and 'dog' in Chinese are homophones..)</dfn>

    <p>This collection of boxing skills was a combination of seven forms.</p>

    <p>From Basic Dog Skill One, Basic Dog Skill Two, Basic Dog Skill Three... all the way to Basic Dog Skill Seven...</p>

    <p>Anyway, compared with the previous spirit techniques which Xiao Yin had sent earlier, Er Ha thought that this combination set of dog skills was a lot more reliable!</p>

    <p>Firstly, the names weren't odd; secondly, these names indicated that these were a genuine spirit technique of the Dog clan, so Er Ha could learn them.</p>

    <p>Seeing that Er Ha hadn't replied for a long time after receiving the data, Xiao Yin couldn't help saying, "Let me tell you, this spirit technique collection is very difficult. When I secretly studied them in Dog Saint's secret depository of Buddhist texts, it took me a long time to learn them! If you can't do it, you can ask me, and I'll consider if I should teach you or not!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was very pleased when he said this because he had been bullied by Er Ha all this time. This opportunity to retaliate was hard to come by, of course he wouldn't let it go.</p>

    <p>Given Er Ha's level of comprehension as a former demon king, mastering level three and level four techniques wasn't difficult. But the transition in difficulty from level four to level five was like directly jumping from junior high school geometry to university advanced mathematics... without guidance, it would typically take a very, very long time to learn on your own.</p>

    <p>And the most critical point was that when Xiao Yin had secretly learned the technique, what he had read was the original set of "Basic Dog Skills"; the diagrams he had drawn were extremely detailed. But what Er Ha now had was based on what Xiao Yin had sorted out in his memory, so there might be some key points that Xiao Yin might have overlooked.</p>

    <p>This would undoubtedly be a huge challenge in Er Ha's learning...</p>

    <p>A copy certainly wouldn't be as detailed as the original.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's book <em>Eight Classes of Divine Weapons </em>was a good example; some of the magic weapons in the original couldn't be found at all in the copies sold on the market.</p>

    <p>"You want to teach me?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha asked when it heard Xiao Yin's smug words.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin felt like he was onto something, and was over the moon. "That's right, that's right! If you have any questions, you can ask me... I'll think about it! Let me tell you, after Dog Saint was captured and turned into a pot of dog stew, the holy beast Dog clan was wiped out in one go, so right now I'm the only one who knows how to use these Dog Skills!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha was surprised. "Dog Saint was so tragic?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin sighed. "Didn't I already say, it seems that I'm the only holy beast left in this world! Holy beasts are awesome, but when all is said and done, they take a long time to mature. I've been laying low for eight thousand years! Eight thousand years! And it's only now that I have the ability to protect myself."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>"Thinking back on Dog Saint... he was indeed tragic that year. Someone spread a rumor that the heart of a holy beast can help a person comprehend the Heavenly Dao, cure insidious diseases, and has other advantages. This created havoc in our holy beast circle. As far as I know, Dog Saint's Dog clan was the first to suffer for it." Speaking up to this point, Xiao Yin couldn't help the faint grief that flitted across his face and his tone was bitter.</p>

    <p>Er Ha was curious. "Why? Don't you holy beasts have your own domains?"</p>

    <p>The domain Er Ha was referring to wasn't simply a piece of territorial land, but was a secret land similar to a small world. In order to preserve their clans, the leader of each holy beast clan had the ability to open up a secret land for their clan to live in.</p>

    <p>"You ask me why?"</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, Xiao Yin sighed again. "Who asked Dog Saint to simply pee everywhere."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "Dog Saint this guy couldn't help peeing on every pole he saw... in the end, those cultivators searching for holy beasts just relied on his piss to lead them right to the front door. They broke through the entrance to the secret land he had set up and straightaway caught him alive. After beating him so that he chased back into his original form from his human one, they burned down its Daoist temple and captured its Dog clan... Finally, he was turned into stew in front of the entire Dog clan."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Why do you know all this?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "Because I was hiding in the Dog clan's depository of Buddhist texts!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "...Why didn't you save him?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "When those people burst in, what could I do? I was so weak back then... If I ran out, I probably would have been turned into stew too! Those cultivators were really too savage and each one of them was an Almighty... you could consider it Dog Saint's bad luck. If it had just been one or two who had broken in, he could still have dealt with it. The main point was that the piss attracted too many people!"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Er Ha couldn't help sighing. "For you to have survived until now has really not been easy... "</p>

    <p>"That's right! I've always thought how nice it would be if there were still fellow holy beasts around..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin said, "It has been a long time since the incident with Dog Saint, but I've always remembered it."</p>

    <p>Er Ha sent a voice reply. "No one would be able to forget that experience."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin shook his head. "No no no... The main point is that when those people turned Dog Saint into stew back then, the hot spices they used smelled really delicious... I could smell it from my hiding spot in the depository!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin laughed. "So, after talking so much, want me to teach you the Dog Skills?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "No need, I can ask my family's Wang Ling..."</p>

    <p>"!!!" Xiao Yin was dealt critical damage!</p>
