  <h1>Chapter 998 The Royal Scepter</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Of course, the situation Book of Sage Immortal spoke of was based on the success of the cloning project.</p>

    <p>Given the strength of the imposter they were currently facing, a successful clone of a true Ling Zhenren wasn't as easy as the other party might have imagined.</p>

    <p>From Book of Sage Immortal's analysis, however, Zhuo Yi had gleaned some key information:</p>

    <p>1: The enemy had come prepared this time. It was very clear what their goal was: they had abducted Student Fang Xing in order to obtain Immortal She Pi's cremation urn and resurrect the latter.</p>

    <p>2: They had massacred scientific researchers on a large scale in order to bring them back to life in the world of the Palace of Mirrors. Under Immortal She Pi's leadership, these scientists would study human cloning in order to clone an army of Wang Lings.</p>

    <p>3: While they currently didn't know who was the mastermind behind the scenes, the other party was 100% linked to Immortal She Pi's case back then, and was aware of the latter's research. Cloning magic was banned! Those who studied it in private would be sentenced to death if caught!</p>

    <p>Could it really be an internal issue?</p>

    <p>Putting the pieces of the puzzle together, Zhuo Yi was more convinced than ever that there was a spy... But the question was, who on earth was the spy? Apart from the mastermind behind the scenes, this was the biggest question. As long as they caught the spy, the mastermind's identity would be revealed.</p>

    <p>But for now, they had to handle matters one by one.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi knew very well that his current task was to help Lord Diulei and the others catch those two imposters alive!</p>

    <p>He swiftly tore open the express delivery boxes while Lord Ma used his transmission ability to send those magical artifacts directly to the inside of the barrier.</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren recognized the golden light at a glance. "It's Lord Ma's golden transmission light!! It looks like he's sending something over!"</p>

    <p>Lord Ma's voice rang out shortly after. "On the order of Zhuo Yi as an authorized person, I am sending everyone magical artifacts from Master's collection. Please use them accordingly and be sure to take down those two imposters."</p>

    <p>When the golden light of transmission disappeared, a divine artifact which glittered with gold appeared in everyone's sight.</p>

    <p>Slime's Bugle!?</p>

    <p>Wasn't this the legendary western divine artifact...</p>

    <p>According to legend, this horn could be used to summon a large number of slime troops to take part in battle. These slime troops wouldn't die, and would only grow in number! Unless there was a way to eliminate them in one go, they would never be completely eliminated!</p>

    <p>"It's just a divine artifact..."</p>

    <p>In the sky, the imposter sneered. "Want to take me down with a magical artifact? Dream on!"</p>

    <p>"Don't be too sure..." Lord Ma warned.</p>

    <p>Then, there were several more golden transmission rays in the sky.</p>

    <p>This was followed by everyone inside the barrier exclaiming one after another.</p>

    <p>WTF?! Thor's Hammer!</p>

    <p>WTF?! Hades's Shield!</p>

    <p>WTF?! Universal WIFI Block Magic Staff!</p>

    <p>WTF?! Immovable Yang Divine Blade!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>So many legendary divine artifacts showed up at the same time, petrifying all the people of the Office of Strategic Deception at once.</p>

    <p>Now even the imposter in the sky started to feel uneasy...</p>

    <p>He had no idea that so many divine artifacts would appear all together. The pressure from these divine artifacts alone caused him to lose his footing for a moment as he almost fell.</p>

    <p>This was a bizarre mix of divine artifacts from both the East and the West, and all of them had been freaking charmed! The +13 light special effects could be felt from far away...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei held the Royal Scepter, which was a magical staff that stood for supreme authority! With just a thought from Lord Diulei, anyone who saw the staff would have to kneel in surrender.</p>

    <p>"You've lost."</p>

    <p>At that moment, Lord Diulei's eyes were fixed on the two imposters.</p>

    <p>The fake female Student Fang Xing had no control at all and dropped to her knees with a plop on the ground.</p>

    <p>In the sky, the remaining imposter had an unwilling expression on his face.</p>

    <p>When activated, his King's Nuclear Bomb had a built-in "do not disturb" effect. Logically speaking, it would never be interrupted, which was why he had been so confident.</p>

    <p>However, reality was always crueler than the imagination...</p>

    <p>In the end, the strength of an imposter was fake, and couldn't compare with the real deal.</p>

    <p>When Lord Diulei, holding the Royal Scepter, gazed at the imposter in the air, incredibly heavy pressure suddenly wrapped around the latter's knees.</p>

    <p>And then... there was no "then."</p>

    <p>The double-eyelid imposter in the air dropped in a ball of energy like a piece of snot. He was rammed deep into the ground up to his knees with a loud bang, directly splitting the earth!</p>

    <p>"My god, this scepter is so handy!" The Office of Strategic Deception crew were petrified by the power of the Royal Scepter.</p>

    <p>Was there any power more hardcore in this world than the ability to make someone kneel... This was a hard CC <sup>1</sup> ! It showed utterly no mercy!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Hard crowd control in LoL
prevents a target from moving
or attacking ..)</dfn>

    <p>The most important point was that the imposter's King's Nuclear Bomb wasn't the real thing and the attack setup took too long, which was an opportunity that Lord Diulei and the others took advantage of.</p>

    <p>"You..."</p>

    <p>Now, both imposters were kneeling on the ground and rendered immobile, suppressed by the Royal Scepter!</p>

    <p>"Speak: where are you from, and what is your true objective? Otherwise, enjoy our divine artifact service package."</p>

    <p>At that moment, everyone from the Office of Strategic Deception surrounded the two imposters, each of them with a divine artifact in hand, and the imposters were scared into breaking out in cold sweat.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The world of the Palace of Mirrors wasn't a pure secret land.</p>

    <p>Although it hadn't been long since Wang Ling entered the place, he had already perceived its complex composition. While it might be very easy for cultivators to create a small world, the Palace of Mirrors' existence wasn't based on the power of a "world," but on a dimensional force far more advanced than a world. In other words, the Palace of Mirrors existed in another cosmic dimension, which received all the dead souls of the universe.</p>

    <p>After Wang Ming and the others scanned the structure of the entire munitions factory, they drew a map.</p>

    <p>"It looks like this munitions factory is just a processing plant. Student Fang Xing isn't here." Wang Ming looked at the map. Together with Guo Ping, they had drawn a map of this world based on their deductions and calculations. Of course, this map was a mirror opposite of a cultivation map of the real world.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, Wang Ling had discovered something else.</p>

    <p>The world wasn't made up of just dead souls.</p>

    <p>Although the Palace of Mirrors took in the dead from all over the universe, it also had its own indigenous inhabitants.</p>

    <p>Using the Great Blood Origin Spell, Wang Ling could distinctly trace back these people's bloodlines and sense that their souls had never left the Palace of Mirrors.</p>

    <p>"Where should we go investigate now?" Guo Ping asked.</p>

    <p>"Go back to Number 60 High for a look," Wang Ling answered telepathically.</p>

    <p>He was a little curious to see how Number 60 High had changed in the Palace of Mirrors.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he could also sense that a native inhabitant of the Palace of Mirrors was living in Number 60 High.</p>
