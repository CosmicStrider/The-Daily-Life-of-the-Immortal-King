  <h1>Chapter 1052 Protect Miss Little Liang</h1>

  <div>

    <p>To be able to dominate the lawyers' circle, Wu Yuanji definitely had his own special information network. He had cultivated a team of investigators who specialized in collecting all kinds of information for him. Most of them were criminals who had once been on death row, before Wu Yuanji defended them in court and they were ultimately exculpated.</p>

    <p>After that, these people became his unwavering followers and loyal intelligence agents.</p>

    <p>Of course, the reason why Wu Yuanji had chosen to represent them pro bono at the very beginning wasn't out of kindness, but because he valued their talents.</p>

    <p>The defense trials proceeded without a hitch simply because this was a group of highly intelligent criminals. They didn't leave behind too many traces of their crimes, which gave Wu Yuanji ample leeway in their defense; destroying evidence and turning the unreasonable into the reasonable was the first rule of his defense.</p>

    <p>After settling the price with Fu Fusheng, Wu Yuanji set out to investigate the new witness, and soon, a file was placed on his table in his office.</p>

    <p>Wu Yuanji had thought it would be quite a while before he got it - witness profiles were stored in the Police Bureau's general office, which wasn't easy to sneak into.</p>

    <p>But it seemed that his intelligence agents had improved in their techniques.</p>

    <p>Wu Yuanji was in a very good mood when he saw the file - he had initially assumed that the information would be delivered at night, which meant that he would only be able to get rid of the witness in the wee hours of the morning, but this was much quicker than he had expected.</p>

    <p>The earlier Wu Yuanji got rid of the witness, the better it was for him, and his client could breathe easy at the same time.</p>

    <p>Fu Fusheng had shelled out two hundred million in lawyer's fees, which made him a big client.</p>

    <p>"Little Liang."</p>

    <p>Wu Yuanji read the name in the profile.</p>

    <p>It didn't have a picture or even an address. Perhaps, in order to protect this important witness, the important information hadn't been put into the system. Thus, the only information Wu Yuanji had on this witness was a name, Little Liang.</p>

    <p>And from the name, he assumed that it was a girl.</p>

    <p>"This is it?" Wu Yuanji raised his head and looked at the little brother sitting in the office. This was a gangly young man, and one of those whom Wu Yuanji had saved back then.</p>

    <p>The young man shrugged and nodded helplessly. "That's all we got. The other side probably already took some measures, and we don't have any details. Also, after checking Zheng Jingxuan's social network, we didn't find anyone called Little Liang - she might be a neighbor or just a passerby."</p>

    <p>A neighbor or passerby?</p>

    <p>Wu Yuanji suddenly felt his scalp itch and he scratched his head.</p>

    <p>Zheng Jingxuan had committed suicide in an enclosed room, and all the people who knew anything on Liu Yi's end had also died in enclosed rooms - how could a passerby or neighbor have seen what happened?</p>

    <p>Given the situation, Wu Yuanji thought of a possibility.</p>

    <p>Could it be false evidence?</p>

    <p>To prove that Fu Fusheng was guilty, the prosecution had created a new witness.</p>

    <p>It wasn't impossible.</p>

    <p>But if there was a witness, and Wu Yuanji was able to seize this key figure, the prosecution would definitely lose the case.</p>

    <p>Wu Yuanji frowned deeply.</p>

    <p>No matter what, he still needed to verify it himself.</p>

    <p>Wu Yuanji got to his feet; he had already made up his mind to assassinate this Miss Little Liang. Although he had no idea where she was, he had a feeling that she was most likely at the Police Bureau's local safehouse for important witnesses, given that she would be appearing in the trial tomorrow.</p>

    <p>That place was heavily defended, and breaking in obviously wouldn't be easy. However, Wu Yuanji wasn't worried about being detected at all. That was because several days ago, he realized that he had awoken a unique power.</p>

    <p>It was the power to transform into a ray of light, enabling him to travel through electronic screens and kill without being noticed at all...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, everyone in the Police Bureau's general office was keeping a close eye on the monitor screen. Zhuo Yi already had a hunch that Wu Yuanji might act tonight, and they were going to catch him in the act.</p>

    <p>The general office's Chief Zhao frowned deeply. "Will your plan really work..."</p>

    <p>"Relax, Chief Zhuo. The witness is heavily guarded." Gao Tian said with full confidence, "Given that the suspect has the ability to travel through screens like Sadako, we've also meddled with the computer's power source and can instantly cut it off when necessary."</p>

    <p>"Will that work?"</p>

    <p>"It definitely will, Chief Zhao." A junior officer next to him smiled. "Once the power is cut, won't this person be stuck inside?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Chief Zhao took a deep breath and then nodded slowly. "I understand the reason... but don't you think this is a little overkill..."</p>

    <p>"To protect the witness, how can we not go all out? What's more, Miss Little Liang is just a two-year-old girl. Protecting a girl is completely reasonable and justified!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Reporting to Chief Zhao, Captain Gao and General Director Zhuo! There's movement!"</p>

    <p>"What's happening?"</p>

    <p>"Our surveillance technology picked up unusual and invasive fluctuations. We suspect that the other party is already moving online."</p>

    <p>"Why didn't you use this technology earlier?"</p>

    <p>"This is a very unique fluctuation which needs to be specifically monitored for and guarded against; it's very hard to detect with normal technology otherwise." The technician wiped his sweat. He was an old technician with decades of experience under his belt, but this was the first time he had seen such an unusual fluctuation; it was even more subtle and less easily detected than fluctuations from the Gate Between Worlds descending, but hid an even bigger crisis.</p>

    <p>"This is the first time I've seen such a fluctuation. It's hidden and full of killing intent. Also, it moves so fast, almost at the speed of light. Just like... like..." The technician frowned deeply. "Just like a shadow."</p>

    <p>"Shadow?"</p>

    <p>Everyone present was lost in deep thought at this realization.</p>

    <p>This unusual fluctuation was similar to a shadow; in other words, was it possible that the other party was using shadow magic of some sort? There were a lot of shadow spells; there were even sects registered with Huaxiu Alliance which specialized in teaching shadow magic. These cultivators could use shadows to grab things and to even fight, but no one had ever heard of using shadows to travel through electronic screens and kill people.</p>

    <p>To accomplish this, the other party had to be extremely proficient in shadow techniques.</p>

    <p>"Shadow magic is usually bound to the body. To travel through the screen at the speed of light, the body has to be able to endure the tearing of space... But as far as I know, even the sect leader of Shadow Sect is unable to do this - his Shadow Separation Technique can only last for sixteen seconds at most," Chief Zhao said doubtfully.</p>

    <p>Here, then, was the question.</p>

    <p>As a Golden Core lawyer, how had Wu Yuanji obtained such power? Could it be that he had also eaten frozen dumplings?</p>
