  <h1>Chapter 949 Seeds of Hatred</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In the hospital, Tiger Liang, who had been injured by the Fireball Spell, was wailing bitterly. It was hard to believe that a ten-year-old kid had actually been bullied by two four-year-olds.</p>

    <p>"That's him! And her! They joined hands to bully me. We said it would be a one-on-one battle, but in the end, the one with the surname Chen didn't follow the rules. He cut in halfway and hit me with a Fireball Spell!</p>

    <p>"Father, you have to believe me. This isn't my fault! It's their fault! It's everyone's fault!"</p>

    <p>Some of his lackeys nodded repeatedly and parroted him on the side.</p>

    <p>"That's right, it's just like Brother Tiger said! They were bullying people! They're shameless!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Chen Chao didn't justify himself from beginning to end; he knew the cameras around the park had been destroyed and whatever he said would be useless.</p>

    <p>Tiger Liang could say whatever he wanted and twist the truth.</p>

    <p>Wang Xiaoling was a mute who couldn't speak or even read. When Tiger Liang cried foul first before they could, she shook her head non-stop but was unable to open her mouth and argue back.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, who had possessed this girl's body, could vividly feel her helplessness.</p>

    <p>"Don't be afraid."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao protected her behind him, as if she was his own little sister rather than a stranger.</p>

    <p>Father Chen had taught him that people who cultivated body techniques had to know what it meant to stand firm! It was like that old pagoda tree in front of the dojo whose trunk had already been rubbed bald; even without bark, it still stood firm and upright throughout the seasons without collapsing.</p>

    <p>Tiger Liang's father had arrived. Seeing his son in pain, his face gradually darkened and he gazed at Chen Chao before snorting coldly. "You uneducated little bastard. Since your father didn't teach you anything, I'll do it in his place..."</p>

    <p>He threw a punch at Chen Chao. Liang Heng, Tiger Liang's father, was at the Foundation Establishment stage.</p>

    <p>This punch was extremely fast, and Chen Chao could only see its shadow.</p>

    <p>This person wasn't a cultivator who specialized in body techniques, so his punch was a little bit slow; Chen Chao felt it was nothing like his father's at all.</p>

    <p>He felt he could guess where the punch would land and dodge it completely.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao grit his teeth, his trademark unyielding expression on his face, and the resolution in his gaze appeared to pull at Liang Heng's heartstrings.</p>

    <p>It was a manly expression on the face of a kid with a fearless and courageous spirit who had been cultivating body techniques for a year.</p>

    <p>To be frank, Liang Heng was a little envious; he knew that when it came to mindset, his son Tiger Liang couldn't compare with Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>In that moment, Liang Heng was pretty angry, but confronted with Chen Chao's gaze, he realized that he couldn't do anything to him.</p>

    <p>And so his fist turned toward Wang Ling next to Chen Chao...</p>

    <p>Chen Chao wasn't afraid of Liang Heng, who would get into trouble if he beat up Chen Chao. But this little girl was different; her mother only collected rubbish, and the girl herself was mute. Even if she was bullied, what could she do?</p>

    <p>Liang Heng had the vicious gall to instantly switch targets and aim a punch at Wang Xiaoling.</p>

    <p>"You!" Chen Chao wanted to block him but it was already too late.</p>

    <p>"Bang!"</p>

    <p>This punch didn't hit Wang Ling, but instead hit a figure who had swiftly appeared â€” it was an imposing man with a thick and broad build.</p>

    <p>"Father."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao was close to crying as tears full of grievance welled up in his eyes, though they didn't fall in the end.</p>

    <p>"Son, straighten your back! Don't be afraid! Why? Because I'm here!"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Father Chen gripped Liang Heng's fist tightly. "Old Liang, isn't it a little too petty of you to hit a little girl?"</p>

    <p>Seeing that his punch had been blocked, Liang Heng shrugged. "The wicked are bedeviled by the same - all of you bullied my son, don't think I'll just let it be!"</p>

    <p>"You should in fact be well aware of the truth of the matter. They're young, arguments are inevitable. Indulging your Little Tiger will only harm him."</p>

    <p>Father Chen laughed. "I'll say no more! I've paid the medical fees! Old Liang, I hope you'll watch your behavior. For the sake of the fact that we learned under the same teacher in college, don't look for trouble with my son and this poor little girl."</p>

    <p>Father Chen sighed inwardly; be that as it may, this could be considered a decisive end to any relationship between their martial arts dojo and the Liang family's magic center.</p>

    <p>Father Chen could not be any clearer on the type of person Liang Heng was; he had always been very competitive since college.</p>

    <p>Now that his ten-year-old son Tiger Liang had been injured by Chen Chao, who was only four years old, this was the same as the reputation of Liang Heng's magic center taking a hit from Father Chen himself.</p>

    <p>"Son, let's go." Protecting Chen Chao and Wang Xiaoling, Father Chen prepared to leave.</p>

    <p>On the hospital bed, Tiger Liang suddenly shouted, "Father! You can't let them go!!"</p>

    <p>"Shut up!" Liang Heng glared at him, scaring Tiger Liang into instantly shutting his mouth; Liang Heng knew himself that he was losing face doing this.</p>

    <p>"Father, it was two against one!"</p>

    <p>"You shut up!" Liang Heng was overwhelmed by anger.</p>

    <p>What fucking two against one!</p>

    <p><em>A ten-year-old like you couldn't handle two four-year-old kids. How humiliating is that?</em></p>

    <p>And most embarrassing of all was that many onlookers had seen Tiger Liang shouting and making a fool of himself. Liang Heng could be considered famous around here, and it was always funnier to watch someone famous make a fool of themselves...</p>

    <p>But Tiger Liang had no idea about any of this. He felt especially wronged; as someone who had been spoiled growing up, he had never experienced such frustration before.</p>

    <p>It was that damn rubbish collector's fault!</p>

    <p>"I'll remember this! You just wait!" Tiger Liang shouted at the Chen father and son pair as well as Wang Xiaoling.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Father Chen paused and turned his head to examine Tiger Liang, whose leg was bound up like a dumpling.</p>

    <p>"You... what are you looking at?!" Tiger Liang's skin crawled.</p>

    <p>Father Chen laughed. "Nothing; I suddenly thought I should show you some care."</p>

    <p>Tiger Liang: "Care? Then get Chen Chao to bow and apologize to me! No! He's younger, so he should kowtow and apologize!"</p>

    <p>"You misunderstand."</p>

    <p>Father Chen shook his head. "Uncle Chen wanted to ask if you've finished your homework for the winter break already."</p>

    <p>Tiger Chen: "..."</p>

    <p>Father Chen: "What did you get in the final exam?"</p>

    <p>Tiger Chen: "..."</p>

    <p>Father Chen: "What's your ranking in class? In your whole year? Has some uncle asked you how many monster girlfriends Sun Wukong has<sup>1</sup>?"</p>

    <p>Tiger Chen: "..."</p>

    <p>Father Chen: "You're in Junior Grade Three now, and in two years, you'll take the middle school entrance exam. How far have you progressed in your cultivation? What Physical Build level are you at now? Can you reach the Qi Condensation stage by the time you're in Grade Six?"</p>

    <p>Tiger Chen: "..."</p>

    <p>Father Chen's questions seemed simple, but they pierced the heart and drew blood. On the hospital bed, Tiger Liang was rendered speechless.</p>

    <p>Tiger Liang just gaped like a fool and couldn't say anything for a long time.</p>

    <p>Alright!</p>

    <p>Good job! Go home!</p>

    <p>Father Chen was in a good mood when he left with Chen Chao and Wang Xiaoling.</p>

    <p>The two four-year-olds were utterly stunned by Father Chen's operation.</p>

    <p>That was the day that four-year-old Chen Chao learned one truth.</p>

    <p>It turned out that you didn't need to use your fists to deal someone a deep injury... The seeds of a "mouth cannon" started to sprout in young Chen Chao's heart.</p>
