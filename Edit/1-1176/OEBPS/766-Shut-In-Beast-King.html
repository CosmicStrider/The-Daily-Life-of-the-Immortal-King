  <h1>Chapter 766 Shut-In Beast King</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Xiao Yin rubbed his eyes to confirm that he wasn't seeing things... This was indeed a giant LCD TV.</p>

    <p>He was stupefied. He had never, ever expected the coffin of the legendary Beast King to look like this.</p>

    <p>"Why... why does the coffin look so much like an LCD TV?" Xiao Yin was confounded.</p>

    <p>Qin Lang looked at him with a smile. "Let me correct you: it's not 'like' an LCD TV, it is an LCD TV."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>The light drew them to the front of the screen. Qin Lang placed his palm on a huge disk, which quickly started to emit light.</p>

    <p>"The identity verification is done, please follow me," said Qin Lang.</p>

    <p>"That disk just now..."</p>

    <p>"That's the decoder."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>A path leading to the interior of the LCD TV opened.</p>

    <p>In the enormous inner hall of Beast King's tomb, a huge beast with green horns, a purple beard, and silver teeth lay motionless on the ground. The beast was like a large mountain at more than thirty zhang tall. Cables as thick as water pipes ran from Beast King's head into a black box behind him.</p>

    <p>"As expected, His Majesty Beast King is still alive!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was very excited at this scene.</p>

    <p>Because he wasn't the last surviving holy beast.</p>

    <p>His Majesty Beast King was still alive!</p>

    <p>After the holy beast catastrophe, Xiao Yin had felt that there was already no longer any hope for the revival of holy beasts, but since His Majesty Beast King was still alive, then it was possible!</p>

    <p>Devil King's blood was the blood of all holy beasts. The genes only needed to be extracted from his blood to be bred, and it would be completely possible to bring the extinct holy beasts back to life.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the holy beast with the highest hope of resurrection should be Dog Saint, since Er Ha had picked up its bones. If they were used accordingly, poor Dog Saint might have the opportunity to be reborn.</p>

    <p>For a moment, Xiao Yin's thoughts flew everywhere and all kinds of feelings welled up in his heart.</p>

    <p>The fire of hope that had been extinguished for so many years had instantly been rekindled.</p>

    <p>But Qin Lang, who was standing next to him, sighed soon after. "To be honest, even I never thought there would still be a holy beast alive in this world. You were alone all this time after they went extinct, it must have been very hard on you..."</p>

    <p>"It was okay..."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin pursed his lips.</p>

    <p>It had indeed been hard, but now he had Thunder and Master!</p>

    <p>"His Majesty Beast King has been wallowing in self-blame since the holy beasts were exterminated," Qin Lang said. "He thought that there were still living holy beasts in the world, but he never thought that in the end, they would all be devoured by those brutal human cultivators."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi stared at the huge beast in front of him with a stunned expression on his face.</p>

    <p>The number of people in the world who knew the legendary king of holy beasts Devil King's true identity, let alone see his true form, could be counted on one hand.</p>

    <p>"How long has Devil King been like this?" Wang Ming turned his face to ask suddenly.</p>

    <p>"After His Majesty Beast King confirmed that there wasn't a single holy beast left, he fell into this state." Qin Lang frowned. "He has been holed up here deep in the palace hall for a long time and hasn't had any contact with anyone. Initially, apart from the various clan elders, I was His Majesty Beast King's only friend. It was just that when the event happened, I was going through the one thousand-year tribulation. It was only after the tribulation was over that I learned that the holy beasts had been exterminated..."</p>

    <p>"So you know what happened?" Wang Ming raised his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>"Roughly."</p>

    <p>Qin Lang nodded. Since he had already brought these people inside, he naturally had nothing to hide.</p>

    <p>Of course, the most important thing was that he was still fearful of that Flame of Purification...</p>

    <p>"His Majesty Beast King has been holed up deep in this palace hall for a long time. He doesn't have any special hobbies, and just likes... to play games," Qin Lang said.</p>

    <p>"Play... games?"</p>

    <p>"The cables you're looking are directly connected to the cranial nerves and allow a person to create a game world inside their mind. This is a special game console which His Majesty Beast King paid someone a lot of money to make."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"When the event happened, His Majesty Beast King just so happened to be stuck on a game level and had been studying how to get past it. But when he had still been unable to clear it after several days, he quit the game. By that time, the holy beasts had already been wiped out. And so, His Majesty Beast King has been wallowing in self-reproach since then. After learning that there were no more living holy beasts, he directly shut himself away. For a thousand years, he has insisted on not reading the strategy guide, and has immersed himself in the game world and refuses to face reality."</p>

    <p>When Xiao Yin heard this ending, his eyelids twitched like crazy.</p>

    <p>He felt that this was a little too much information!</p>

    <p>From what this Imperial tree goblin gentleman was saying, the only thing Xiao Yin got out of it was: the legendary Beast King was a damn fat shut-in!</p>

    <p>Just then, Qin Lang sighed heavily. "It's just a pity that you came too late... If His Majesty Beast King knew that there is another holy beast still alive, he might be able to come out of the shadows."</p>

    <p>"Is there a way to wake Beast King up?" Wang Ming asked again.</p>

    <p>"Yes, there is... There are two ways."</p>

    <p>Qin Lang nodded. "The first way is to help His Majesty Beast King clear the game. He hasn't switched to another game for a thousand years because he has yet to complete this one perfectly. As long as he can clear the game perfectly, he will at the very least quit the game of his own accord to switch to another one... That is an opportunity."</p>

    <p>Everyone was silent. "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "Then the second way?"</p>

    <p>"The second way is to just wait."</p>

    <p>Qin Lang said, "His Majesty Beast King wakes up every five hundred years to clean himself up and eat. He eats five hundred years' worth of meals in one go and hoards them in his body to be slowly digested. When the time comes, that is naturally an opportunity. If you can wait, I'll let you know the next time I order takeout."</p>

    <p>"Order... order takeout?"</p>

    <p>"That's right." Qin Lang nodded. "All of you should already know, there is more than one entrance to the tomb. The entrance inside Beast King's Remains is just the main one. In order to communicate more easily with the outside world, I had tree roots open a space which connected to the outside world. I then contact the delivery people outside to bring the takeout to the entrance. But because the order is so massive, and given how dangerous the path connected to the tomb outside is... every year, a number of delivery employees perish trying to deliver this order."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>As expected, you couldn't even become a delivery employee these days without some skills!</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin remembered hearing some news before about all kinds of mysterious takeout delivery employees. When they delivered the food, they might rescue a monkey coder from near death in passing, or leap great heights to save a child that had accidentally climbed out a window... It seemed that there was no place in the world delivery employees couldn't go.</p>

    <p>It looked like guarding the Bronze Gate<sup>1</sup> wouldn't be boring, since you could at least order takeout!</p>

    <dfn><sup></sup>(From "Grave Robbers' Chronicles," when one of the main characters sacrificed himself for the protagonist to become the guardian of the Bronze Gate.)</dfn>
