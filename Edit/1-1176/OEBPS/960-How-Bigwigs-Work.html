  <h1>Chapter 960 How Bigwigs Work</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This was beyond what Father Chen and the others had expected; they never thought that Father Wang's <em>Wet Nurse </em>would be so well received in the cultivation forum. From the attitude of some of the sect leaders earlier, they thought that online novels were just a fun way to kill time and weren't worth reading at all.</p>

    <p>A place like the cultivation forum was on a completely different level - it could even be said that this was where the big shots in the cultivation circle gathered. In the eyes of these sect leaders, instead of wasting their time on stereotypical online novels that were all the same, they might as well recite the heart sutras of several rare books and learn more about covert rumors and gossip to increase their experience and knowledge; even getting ready to cultivate in seclusion would be far more interesting than reading online novels.</p>

    <p>But it had to be said that Father Wang's <em>Wet Nurse </em>had completely taken their breaths away. At first glance, it seemed to contain all the stereotypical elements, but it also had plenty of interesting cultivation secrets and knowledge. Besides, some major sect players could already tell that these cultivation secrets weren't made up.</p>

    <p>The truth was that Father Wang had done a lot of research before writing his book. Although he had a low realm, his knowledge of the cultivation field wasn't necessarily any less than that of these sect leaders.</p>

    <p>And this actually was all thanks to Wang Ling, who had enlightened Father Wang's computer.</p>

    <p>Thus, the computer could retain all the cultivation knowledge which Father Wang looked at online and automatically make associations between them. Similar to how an academic paper was organized, it would come up with a hypothesis on some cultivation phenomenon and then ultimately compile it into a passage before incorporating it into the novel.</p>

    <p>This was the legendary bigwig operation which only Father Wang was capable of...</p>

    <p>Hence, Father Wang's novel might just be an interesting book to online readers, but in the eyes of these sect big shots with truly high realms, it became an exceptionally interesting academic research paper.</p>

    <p>So instead of focusing on the fun parts and the plot of Father Wang's online book, these bigwigs focused on the sections where the protagonist entered various secret places or when spells were analyzed...</p>

    <p>It had always been said that one's ken was determined by the level of one's realm. Many parts in Father Wang's novel seemed like cooked-up nonsense, when in fact they actually weren't, and were the real deal...</p>

    <p>As a result, Father Chen's post in the cultivation forum promoting the novel instantly became a hot topic, and was even pinned as a sticky at the top of the first page by the administrator Uncle Cat.</p>

    <p>It was nearly eight o'clock in the evening, and with the strength of these major sect leaders behind it, Father Wang's <em>Wet Nurse </em>finally started to take off!</p>

    <p>The bugle for the counter attack had officially sounded!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, at Balance Magic Center, Liang Heng and the others couldn't sit still.</p>

    <p>"What's going on? What's the situation with Wang Situ?" asked Liang Heng as he stubbed out his cigarette. He thought that Zhu Ge already had the win in the bag, but who would have thought that Father Wang would suddenly come out strong now, catching Liang Heng off guard.</p>

    <p>"There are a lot of gifts... Also, they all seem to be from newly registered side accounts..." someone replied.</p>

    <p>The group leaders on Liang Heng's side noticed that these accounts which were giving Wang Situ's novel huge gifts were all newly created; there weren't any profile pictures and even the IDs hadn't been changed from the initial IDs generated automatically at signup, and still had a string of numbers behind them...</p>

    <p>"WTF, they're all gifts of ten million in book currency... there're more than ten in a row already..."</p>

    <p>"Where did he get so many hot shots from, in this period of time?" Liang Heng didn't understand.</p>

    <p>It wasn't just Liang Heng; the other group leaders were also confused. They had no idea what was going on. Although the Cultivation Reading Network was now the largest Internet portal for serialized online novels as well as the place where a lot of the rich congregated, this sudden gathering of fat cats on Father Wang's side was rather much...</p>

    <p>"Could it be some financial group young master?"</p>

    <p>"No idea." Liang Heng shook his head.</p>

    <p>Even if a financial group young master was involved, it was unlikely that he would be able to create this sort of gift-giving momentum!</p>

    <p>The most important thing was that not only were there a lot of gifts in this short period of time, but the accounts they were from weren't the same! Even if it was a rich young master sending gifts, he wouldn't go so far as to register so many different accounts, would he?</p>

    <p>"Brother Liang, what should we do now?"</p>

    <p>"How big is the gap in votes now?"</p>

    <p>"It's a little strange. They've been sending big gifts all this time: it's already roughly six hundred thousand HNY in just three minutes. However, no one's sending monthly vote red packets? Ten million book coins would mean a thousand monthly votes, but they've only caught up by six thousand votes, and haven't closed the gap."</p>

    <p>"No one is sending monthly vote red packets? Really?" Liang Heng was a little stumped, and thought for a while. "Let's wait and see first. We still have roughly three hundred thousand HNY on hand; there has to be a catch if they're not sending red packets..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Father Chen and the others were thrilled. They didn't expect these sect leaders to be so magnanimous, sending thousands upon thousands in gifts... In a short few minutes, they had already given Father Wang close to six hundred thousand HNY, which was beyond what Father Chen dared imagine.</p>

    <p>But Lin Gang also realized that no one was sending monthly vote red packets...</p>

    <p>"How come no one's sending red packets?" Lin Gang asked.</p>

    <p>"These sect leaders basically don't read novels. Maybe they don't know how to send red packets... sending money is a lot easier," Father Chen said.</p>

    <p>"I'll tell them."</p>

    <p>Lin Gang used Father Chen's forum account and started lobbying for monthly votes in the cultivation forum. "Thank you, sect leaders, for your support. Today is the Cultivation Reading Network's annual Best Author competition, and I believe the esteemed author deeply appreciates everyone's gifts!"</p>

    <p>Immediately, there were replies below his comment.</p>

    <p>"It's just a small amount. I just hope that the author will write a little more about the Xuanwu secret land. His conjectures inside the novel are very interesting and truly worth studying."</p>

    <p>"Mm, it's a small thing. Our sect might only be a Black-level sect, but we do have an annual revenue of hundreds of millions. This gift money is just to give the author some encouragement."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Father Chen and the others stared blankly. Sure enough, this was how bigwigs actually worked!</p>

    <p>Lin Gang replied, "But the key now is not the gifts, but the monthly votes! We're still a long way from first place. The screenshot below shows how to send a monthly vote red packet... One monthly vote red packet costs five yuan, which is equal to five hundred book coins. We would be most grateful for the assistance of all sect leaders."</p>

    <p>"Tch, it seems quite troublesome."</p>

    <p>"It's not hard at all..."</p>

    <p>"No, I still feel it's a little troublesome. How many votes now to reach first place?"</p>

    <p>"We're still short of forty thousand votes... It was initially a difference of almost fifty thousand, but the gifts of one hundred thousand yuan each which the sect heads sent in a row narrowed that gap. A gift of ten million book coins is equivalent to one hundred thousand yuan and one thousand monthly votes."</p>

    <p>"Oh... so one hundred thousand yuan means one thousand monthly votes, is that right?"</p>

    <p>"Yes..."</p>

    <p>"Alright, so we now have a figure. Then just keep sending gifts until we pass that number of votes."</p>

    <p>A sect leader in the cultivation forum quickly gave a reply.</p>

    <p>Father Chen and Lin Gang: "..."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao and Wang Ling: "..."</p>
