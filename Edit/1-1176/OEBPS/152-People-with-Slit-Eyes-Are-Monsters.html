  <h1>Chapter 152 People with Slit Eyes Are Monsters! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Song Qingshu slunk through the door with a guilty conscience. After all, he had come here several times in order to grab the stone ghost mask and had even sent his subordinates to take it by force... but now he fully understood that the true strength of this household wasn't something that he could contend against; a pair of long johns could send the Lady of the Castle's competent subordinate, Ah Zuo, flying. How frighteningly strong must the senior be, to be able to create such a magic treasure?</p>

    <p>The old man poured Song Qingshu a glass of water, placed it on the coffee table and pushed it in front of him. "Is there anything you want to say?"</p>

    <p>The old man had always been a very easygoing person; when he smiled, in particular, his eyes would crinkle into slits and make him look very kindly. However, Song Qingshu didn't dare let down his guard in the least. Although he couldn't sense even the slightest bit of spirit energy from the old man, there was a good saying... people with slit eyes were monsters <sup>1</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Slit eyes in anime, manga and
gaming culture can denote a
conniving or sinister
personality.)</dfn>

    <p>Maybe this great senior was sounding him out?</p>

    <p>And this glass of water...</p>

    <p>Could he drink it? Should he drink it?</p>

    <p>Or was this a test?</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu stared at this glass of water, lost in endless thought... this scene was exactly the same as the one at the dining table back then, when Lord Diulei had been confused as to whether or not to eat the broccoli which Grandfather Wang had given him.</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu had been feeling a little queasy since arriving at the Wang family's small villa; for some reason, he felt like someone was staring at him from behind. At first glance, this villa couldn't be any more ordinary — it wasn't even equipped with a spirit array, so he didn't understand why it felt like his soul was being stifled here.</p>

    <p>After taking ten minutes to calm down, and feeling like a kid who had been caught copying homework by his teacher-in-charge, Song Qingshu finally confessed to the old man.</p>

    <p>Because he had so much to say as he told the old man almost all the ins and outs of the whole story, the old man was slow to react given his advanced age. After struggling to sort out the main points, he then said slowly, "Oh, so you wanted to buy that mask in the beginning? But Little Lei took it away with him..."</p>

    <p>Little... Little Lei?</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu felt that his three views had been overturned.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, how many people would dare address Great Death-Courting Senior like this?</p>

    <p>Instantly, Song Qingshu became even more in awe of the old man! Even if he had carefully checked him inside out and still couldn't sense any spirit energy, he had nonetheless already acknowledged this old man as a great senior in his mind! He didn't have the slightest doubt, moreover, that this old man was a big name at the level of a living fossil!</p>

    <p>"Because you didn't manage to buy the mask for your boss, he's now coming after you, is that it?" The old man sighed; young people nowadays were really too rowdy. It was just one mask and they made such a big deal out of it, even to the point of being ready to kill for it.</p>

    <p>The old man felt that his abilities weren't enough to help Song Qingshu; after thinking for a bit, he stretched out his leg to prod at Er Ha's little butt to get it to bring Wang Ling downstairs.</p>

    <p>Er Ha was a little irritated at its sleep being disturbed.</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu looked at this strangely-colored akita; he had thought it was a domestic soul pet, but when this guy was kicked by the old man, it unexpectedly gave Song Qingshu an angry look.</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu felt like he had seen this expression somewhere before.</p>

    <p>This definitely wasn't an ordinary dog. For some reason, in the instant when Song Qingshu and the dog's eyes met, he saw a demon king standing on the top of a cliff as it commanded thousands of demons below it. It had sharp eyes and was full of vim and vigor. With a wave of its hand, it could destroy an entire world...</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu was stunned.</p>

    <p>An illusion?</p>

    <p>The old man: "Our Wang Ling brought this dog home from school; leaders were paying the school a visit, and it couldn't be kept there. But the little fellow is very loyal and very easy to care for."</p>

    <p>"So that's it..." Song Qingshu sighed at the old man's explanation. "Senior, if I may be so bold as to ask, who is Wang Ling?"</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling is my grandson, he's still in high school."</p>

    <p>Still in... high school?</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu felt his three views being refreshed once again.</p>

    <p>What the heck was up with this family?</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu: "Which high school is that?"</p>

    <p>The old man: "Number 60 High School."</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu: "..."</p>

    <p>Under normal circumstances, the old man would be exuberant whenever he mentioned his grandson. The pride of the old generation in their grandchildren was forever endless and inexplicable. But it was not right for him to say too much. He had never wanted to become embroiled in matters between cultivators. For the old man to be able to sit here and listen to Song Qingshu's long-winded confession for such a long time was purely in the name of neighborly spirit.</p>

    <p>If it had been a couple's quarrel, the old man thought that he might have been able to be like Bai Wanqing <sup>2</sup> and act as mediator, but when it came to cultivation, the Wang family could only rely on Wang Ling.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Bai Wanqing is a celebrity TV show judge..)</dfn>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Still on the second floor, Wang Ling had actually already heard Song Qingshu complaining to the old man.</p>

    <p>He was being hunted down by Mo Immortal Castle and wouldn't necessarily be safe even if he escaped abroad, so he had come to the Wang family for help.</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling had originally wanted to ignore this, but just as he had decided to pay it no attention, this damn eyelid began twitching violently once again.</p>

    <p>It had been a long time since his eyelid warning had made an appearance... if he ignored this matter, the consequences would be even worse.</p>

    <p>After deep contemplation, Wang Ling slowly went downstairs. He was dressed in big white bunny pajamas, his cute and soft attire in sharp contrast to his unsmiling, poker face.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling went downstairs, the old man had already returned to his binge-watching on one side, leaving Song Qingshu by himself.</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu was a little nervous and also a little puzzled... he wondered what this great senior meant by leaving the matter to his grandson who was still in high school.</p>

    <p>But when he saw Wang Ling approach him, clad in pajamas that completely clashed with his appearance, Song Qingshu was utterly stunned!</p>

    <p>Because even if this person turned to ash... he would never ever forget him!</p>

    <p>He was sure that this was the youngster in white who had shown up at Lord Diulei's villa and who had caused Great Saint and Second Saint to die by backlash when they had gone to seize the stone ghost mask!</p>

    <p>This teenager had not only caused Great Saint and Second Saint's deaths, he had also caused Third Saint to defect... the crucial thing was that he had a close relationship with Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>Either way, this teenager was responsible for the fact that he had fallen to this point.</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu could never have imagined that he had finally come full circle, and that the person whom he had found to help him would actually be this teenager!</p>

    <p>He was furious!</p>

    <p>But he now already had his back up against a wall. There was no one else who could help him except this youngster.</p>

    <p>On the side, Er Ha gave Song Qingshu a look, then quietly dropped its head and walked up to him to stretch out its claws and pat him comfortingly on the leg.</p>

    <p>No matter how angry you were, you still had to struggle to keep a smile on your face — Er Ha understood this feeling the most!</p>
