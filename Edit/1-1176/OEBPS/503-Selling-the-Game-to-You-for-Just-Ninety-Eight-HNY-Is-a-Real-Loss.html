  <h1>Chapter 503 Selling the Game to You for Just Ninety-Eight HNY Is a Real Loss </h1>

  <div>

    <p>What was going on?!</p>

    <p>Not everyone was at the Soul Formation stage, and Wang Ming's and Fang Xing's moves were so fast that through Daoist Guang's perspective, the audience could only just barely see two people waving the frying pans in their hands relentlessly. However, the viewers couldn't clearly make out what was happening at all.</p>

    <p>Although it was now an era of national cultivation, to be able to find ten people at the Soul Formation stage among the close to ten million viewers in Daoist Guang's live stream room would already be considered pretty good; to track this bullet volley, one had to have the dynamic vision of the Soul Formation stage at the very least.</p>

    <p>"You can adjust the play speed in the live stream room! Everyone, slow the image down to the lowest it can go, and if you try hard enough, you'll be able to see it clearly!"</p>

    <p>At this water friend's tip in the live stream room, everyone started to try it out.</p>

    <p>"You really can see it clearly! It's just that there's a bit of a lag!"</p>

    <p>"It's not lag, it's because their movements are too quick, and Lord Island's live stream speed can't keep up at all!"</p>

    <p>Crossing his arms in front of the computer screen, Wang Ming used voice commands to manipulate his character into executing all kinds of fancy counterattacks. "Twist Serve <sup>1</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This and the next two techniques mentioned are from the manga and anime series "Prince of Tennis .. ")</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Everyone then saw Wang Ming's character wave the frying pan and hit the bullet to the ground.</p>

    <p>The bullet landed at a strange angle and spun continuously before bouncing up!</p>

    <p>This had all happened in a flash; the bullet's trajectory speed got even faster and it instantly flew at the face of Fang Xing's character.</p>

    <p>A little bit more and it would have been a headshot!</p>

    <p>But Fang Xing was also very quick to react, and he swiftly brandished the frying pan to deflect the bullet from his face and send it back.</p>

    <p>When they saw this maneuver, it wasn't just the water friends in the live stream room but also Daoist Guang and his company who couldn't help trembling with stupefied expressions.</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "What the hell! What kind of operation is that?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "My god! The Swallow Counter?"</p>

    <p>On the other side, Fang Xing had only just sent the bullet back, but Wang Ming had already manipulated his character into putting on a show yet again.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "What the fuck?! Bear... Bear Drop?!"</p>

    <p>This time, even Er Ha and Wei Zhi couldn't help crying out in unison, "Damn! Bear Drop?!"</p>

    <p>These were advanced skills that were included in the new release of <em>Guide to Glory - New Edition </em>written by the legendary Great God Ye based on games that were currently popular. Furthermore, all these skills were from the 'Frying Pan Special Collection' in the new book edition, which covered all kinds of skills that involved frying pans.</p>

    <p>But there were very few people who could truly master these skills...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The two individuals facing each other as they used their frying pans to volley the bullet between them were enjoying themselves.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming rewrote his software to include a private voice interface; only Fang Xing would be able to hear whatever Wang Ming said through this interface.</p>

    <p>Steepling his fingers together as he sat in front of the screen, Wang Ming said with a faint, inscrutable smile, "Give up, Student Fang... You can't beat me in this world."</p>

    <p>"Oh~ so it's Brother Ming," Fang Xing said brightly as if he was suddenly enlightened.</p>

    <p>He noticed that he had already entered a private voice channel.</p>

    <p>"You already knew it was me." Wang Ming smiled.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming didn't think it was strange at all that Fang Xing knew who he was. In fact, Wang Ming had secretly investigated him and knew the other party's real identity.</p>

    <p>Due to Fang Xing inheriting Immortal She Pi's tremendous power as a child, he had been sent to a national secret orphanage after he had been born. The orphanage had been established by the Magnificent Immortal Special Army Brigade and housed all kinds of gifted children from all over the nation. Often, if young children who had inherited enormous power didn't receive proper guidance, they would very likely stray off the right path as they grew up.</p>

    <p>Of course, Wang Ling was a special case. That was because Father Wang and Mother Wang had firmly believed that they could teach Wang Ling well, and as reality proved, they had indeed achieved this.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was naturally one of those gifted, but because he hadn't been able to cultivate since young, he remembered how his parents had thus assumed he was a regular kid and had brought him up accordingly. They didn't sense anything unusual about him except for the fact that he starting talking at an especially early age.</p>

    <p>As for how he came to the attention of Huaxiu Cultivation Academy of Science... that was purely because he had recommended himself.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming recalled that he had been four when he had snuck out of bed while his parents had been asleep to use the computer. He had hacked into the national information database and found the email of the president of the academy, and had then sent him a thesis he had written on magic treasures.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming heard that when President Qi had read the thesis back then, it had become smeared with his excited tears...</p>

    <p>Thus, strictly speaking, Fang Xing was connected to Magnificent Immortal. When he was seven years old, he underwent their personality assessment test before Magnificent Immortal helped him find a couple who were looking to adopt. It was actually the Fang couple who adopted him back then who had given him the name Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>In the orphanage, he hadn't had a name, only a number.</p>

    <p>It had been: 36...</p>

    <p>Wang Ming had discovered some of this information himself, while Zhai Yin had provided him the rest.</p>

    <p>Given Magnificent Immortal's status, the majority of the information which Zhai Yin supplied was much more reliable than what most people gathered through hearsay.</p>

    <p>"It looks like Brother Ming knows quite a lot," Fang Xing replied as he waved the frying pan and returned fire.</p>

    <p>"Of course I would notice when my little brother's being spied on every day. Student Fang Xing, absence makes the heart grow fonder - isn't it improper to follow him even into a game to play?"</p>

    <p>"Brother Ming, the same goes for you. Didn't you also follow him here?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming grit his teeth. "It was a coincidence for me!"</p>

    <p>At that moment, they had already hit the same bullet back and forth a dozen or so times.</p>

    <p>It was during Wang Ming's next counterattack that Fang Xing suddenly noticed that the bullet's attack trajectory had changed slightly.</p>

    <p>When he brandished the frying pan, the bullet actually evaded his block at a peculiar angle, like a lightning arch.</p>

    <p>At the moment, Fang Xing had already sensed the unfavorable turn in events. "Brother Ming is really incredible, thank you for the experience!"</p>

    <p>This time, Wang Ming's bullet successfully struck Fang Xing in the head.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing was instantly killed!</p>

    <p>The jaws of the stunned water friends in the live stream room all dropped; they felt that Wang Ming's abrupt switch in tactics seemed a little familiar...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei's expression changed at the sight of this scene. "The hell?! This is..."</p>

    <p>Seeing that he had killed Fang Xing, Wang Ming smiled as he felt fulfilled.</p>

    <p>It was a good thing he was resourceful!</p>

    <p>He had edited the software with data on the national ping pong play style!</p>

    <p>On the side, Daoist Guang gaped at Wang Ming. "Little Brother, is this... a ping pong play style?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming nodded his head. "That's right! To be precise, it's the national ping pong play style! As soon as I use this, how can you hope to trade bullets with me?"</p>

    <p>Everyone drew in sharp breaths at this scene.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Even Wang Ling's lips couldn't help twitching as he watched.</p>
