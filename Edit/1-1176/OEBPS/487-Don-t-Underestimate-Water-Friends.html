  <h1>Chapter 487 Don't Underestimate Water Friends </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Er Ha pulled Wei Zhi into the group. This was the first time that Wei Zhi was so "close" to Lord Island, so he looked a little excited. "I never thought it would really be Lord Island! Lord Island, please show us mercy!"</p>

    <p>"All right, all right," Daoist Guang replied very politely.</p>

    <p>Currently, Wang Ling and Lord Diulei were one team, Er Ha and Wei Zhi were another, and Daoist Guang and his number one fan "Brother Sleep" were one. The six members for the water friends match had assembled. What Daoist Guang had to do next was announce the number of the water friends match chat group in a bullet message and then add people in the order of their applications until the number hit a hundred people.</p>

    <p>That was when hand speed would be the most important.</p>

    <p>"Let me do it, Lord Island." At that moment, "Brother Sleep," who had been silent all this time, spoke up. In reality, Wang Ling had been very curious about the identity of this "Brother Sleep" since the very beginning.</p>

    <p>That was because Wang Ling felt that Brother Sleep was very similar to someone he had in mind when the other person spoke, especially his serious tone.</p>

    <p>"Brother Sleep? Are you really that author who watches live streams and play games daily and is constantly hassled by readers to update?" Wei Zhi asked unabashedly.</p>

    <p>Seeing this question on the screen, "Brother Sleep" couldn't help twitching his lips. "No..."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi looked a little disappointed. "Ei! I thought you were!"</p>

    <p>Brother Sleep asked with interest, "Do you also read this person's books?"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "Yes! I love his Let Go of that Wet Nurse!"</p>

    <p>Brother Sleep: "..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Brother Wei Zhi... Wang Situ didn't write that book."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "Oh! I probably mixed them up. Anyway, Wang Situ and this Three Days And Two Sleeps are both authors I especially like."</p>

    <p>In order to avoid embarrassment, Wei Zhi specially went online to check the book this time. After confirming its title, he posted it in the chat group. "Yes! Look, it's this book... Terror Paradise!"</p>

    <p>The number one fan with the ID Brother Sleep nodded. "This book is indeed pretty good. The lead is temperamental and has a strong personality."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was suddenly a little curious. "What's it about?"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "It deserves its popularity. It's a story about the growth of the young protagonist. One day, he suddenly discovers a resurgence of the world's spirit qi. Then, he unexpectedly obtains a system! The premise is that as long as he's frightened by any danger he encounters from that point on, he can turn the power of his fear into virtual system currency to buy a variety of props to make him stronger. I still remember that the strongest prop he bought in the end was a leather sofa<sup>1</sup>!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is a possible reference to the online novel "Thriller Paradise" which escapes us.)</dfn>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>"If you're interested in this book, you can read it later," Brother Sleep said.</p>

    <p>Still feeling a little disappointed, Wei Zhi sighed in front of the screen. "Ei, are you really not Brother Sleep?"</p>

    <p>Brother Sleep shook his head and couldn't help laughing. "I'm not, I'm just a fan of his. Most online nicknames are unlikely to be true. Look at this friend with the ID 'Immortal Two.' All of you call him Brother Dog, but it's not necessarily really a dog, right?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>"..." In front of their screens, everyone except for Brother Sleep were instantly lost for words.</p>

    <p>"All right, I've posted the group number!" No sooner had Brother Sleep spoken when applications instantly flooded the group with all kinds of reasons submitted.</p>

    <p>"111<sup>2</sup>."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Denotes enthusiasm in games with meanings like "I want to,""I'm ready," "I'm here," "Yes" and so on.)</dfn>

    <p>"I love Lord Island the most!"</p>

    <p>"If you are the fireworks above the sea, then I am the foam of the waves. At some point... your light illuminates me<sup>3</sup>..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(From the song "Chasing the Light" by Yoyo Sham..)</dfn>

    <p>"Mwah! I super love Lord Island! Can I send him white stockings?"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In less than two minutes, the number of people in the group had reached the maximum limit. A group could accommodate a hundred people at most, and Daoist Guang had set up the system to automatically review group applications before they had reached this number.</p>

    <p>In addition, Daoist Guang had specially adjusted the restriction level for group members in order to prevent infiltration by anti-fans from other live streams. Applications from side accounts with ranks that were too low would be directly filtered out by the system.</p>

    <p>Soon, the chat group became lively. Er Ha turned to look at Wei Zhi next to it and suddenly realized that Wei Zhi was actually examining the game keyboard controls. The corners of its eyes twitched instantly. "Can you play or not, you can't even remember the key positions..."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi scratched his head. "It's been so long since I last played... when I played before, a lot of these mechanisms didn't exist!"</p>

    <p>"It's fine, I'll carry you!"</p>

    <p>"So confident?"</p>

    <p>"They're just a bunch of water friends. As long as they don't use cheats, I think I can beat them." Er Ha smiled and looked very confident.</p>

    <p>"Brother Dog, don't look down on water friends..." Wei Zhi tsked as he swiftly clicked opened a webpage. "Come, Brother Dog, look at this!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha craned its neck for a look and noticed that the webpage Wei Zhi had opened was for a team's profile data.</p>

    <p>"What's this?"</p>

    <p>"The most awesome team in the history of gaming in the cultivation world, Team XX. There are ten members in the team, but each one of them is proficient in all types of games. It's said that if you give them five minutes, they can completely master a game. Even if it's a puzzle game, they can take the shortest time possible to come up with the fastest way to clear it."</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, Wei Zhi pointed to a young man standing in the middle of the team who looked like an elder brother; his arms were crossed and his eyes crinkled as he smiled slightly. "This man is the captain of the team... he is also the legendary Great God Ye who wrote Guide to Glory."</p>

    <p>While Team XX was very renowned, people who were new to gaming actually wouldn't know much about them. However, at the mention of Great God Ye and Guide to Glory, Er Ha instantly remembered.</p>

    <p>During his live stream back then, Daoist Guang had also used the advanced "Z Shake" body movement from Guide to Glory; Er Ha remembered it very clearly.</p>

    <p>Thus, when Wei Zhi said this, Er Ha was enlightened.</p>

    <p>This Internet bar which belonged to Boss Ye was called Xin Xing, and the abbreviation of the strongest games team in history just happened to be XX. Most crucially, both of them had the surname Ye...</p>

    <p>"Are you saying you think Boss Ye has something to do with this Great God Ye?"</p>

    <p>"Mm, it's possible." Wei Zhi nodded his head. "Team XX crushed everyone in various major gaming competitions... Later on, they even expanded to the point where clubs would pay them specially to secretly research strategies for clearing matches in the shortest amount of time."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Er Ha was a little baffled. "But what does this have to do with whether water friends are strong or not?"</p>

    <p>"Brother Dog... you still don't understand?"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi gazed at Er Ha and couldn't help giving a mysterious smile. "Do you know how this Great God Ye created Team XX and recruited so many expert members back then?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "???"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "He found all of them through the bullet messages!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>
