  <h1>Chapter 1039 A Thought-Provoking Interrogation</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Zheng Tianqiang's words caused an uproar among the teachers and students present. The truth was that this might just be the tip of the iceberg when it came to the dark secrets of the design industry. If there was conclusive evidence from three years ago that could successfully overturn this case, no one dared to imagine how it would affect this "upright principal."</p>

    <p>Hence, a lot more people were like Principal Zhou and didn't believe it. It had already been three years, and Raven Studio was no longer that small studio from back then, but one which now enjoyed a flourishing, global reputation and which had completed preparations toward becoming listed. If anything incriminating leaked in this period, it was unlikely that Raven Studio would be able to turn things around.</p>

    <p>"Father Zheng, since you say that, do you have any proof?" A university lecturer stepped forward of his own accord.</p>

    <p>Zheng Tianqiang curled his lip — he had been waiting for this question for so long.</p>

    <p>Now that things had come to this point, it was self-evident how important the facts were. At the very beginning, Zheng Tianqiang had wanted to somehow draw attention to this incident. The point, however, was that he hadn't killed anyone — those dead Magic Treasure Development University students had already been murdered by the time he rushed over.</p>

    <p>The dead alchemist was the witness who had blown open the plagiarism case back then.</p>

    <p>Although Father Zheng had yet to obtain any direct proof, that programmer was the person who had directed the public opinion online back then. When the truth of the situation was still unclear, this student from the same year as Zheng Jingxuan in university was a bystander who spread all kinds of rumors online. In the end, he had directed the violence on the Internet at Zheng Jinxuan.</p>

    <p>As for the female live streamer, she was Student Fu Fusheng's ex-girlfriend from university.</p>

    <p>These three people were key witnesses who had died just before Father Zheng arrived.</p>

    <p>Of course, the most unlucky one was Student Shen Guangrong.</p>

    <p>Just as the suspect had been about to kill Student Shen Guangrong, Father Zheng had used his own strength to help hold the murderer back through the screen.</p>

    <p>Father Zheng determined that this Student Shen Guangrong was very likely a red herring, randomly chosen so that the police wouldn't make the connection between this case and the magic treasure plagiarism case from three years ago.</p>

    <p>As for who the criminal was, Father Zheng actually already a rough idea.</p>

    <p>He sensed that a deep and impenetrable abyss was waiting for him somewhere up ahead, and he didn't know what he would face if he continued to probe deeper.</p>

    <p>But what Father Zheng understood very well was that he was a father!</p>

    <p>As a father, he would do what he was supposed to — clear his son's name!</p>

    <p>Father Zheng walked out of the broadcast room. The students and the teacher who had been giving a lecture in the auditorium earlier had already calmed down after the initial panic. So far, they really couldn't link everything that Father Zheng had done to that savage serial killer.</p>

    <p>Most of them were observing the situation.</p>

    <p>During the public lecture in the auditorium, a shadow had suddenly streaked out of the screen and ultimately coalesced into Father Zheng in front of them.</p>

    <p>Father Zheng was very strong; in the split second that he appeared, everyone in the auditorium had been tied up and immobilized with the shadow's power.</p>

    <p>Father Zheng then had the female teacher who had been giving the lecture confiscate all the students' phones, and he activated the barrier inside the auditorium to block messages from being possibly sent out with aural spells.</p>

    <p>Which led to the current scene.</p>

    <p>Father Zheng walked slowly out of the broadcast room and went up to the podium. He straightened and saluted, before bowing deeply to everyone.</p>

    <p>"This teacher and all students, I've startled you. I'll have to trouble you to accompany for a little while longer, until I've accomplished what a father should do." Father Zheng bowed again.</p>

    <p>The students and teacher in the auditorium were unusually cooperative. They were freshmen, and while they had heard about that plagiarism case from back then, they hadn't personally experienced it themselves. At that time, they were so busy for the college entrance exam and hadn't had the time to concern themselves with online comments.</p>

    <p>It was for this very reason that Father Zheng chose to hold this group of students hostage.</p>

    <p>They were a relatively neutral party, who viewed the rights and wrongs of this incident more from the standpoint of onlookers.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Father Zheng also needed direct witnesses.</p>

    <p>All the witnesses he had been looking for were dead. Since there were no longer any witnesses from back then, he had to think about finding new ones.</p>

    <p>"Things have already come to this point, but you're still hiding? I still have a lot of evidence. If I leak all of them, wouldn't you be locked up for the rest of your life?" Father Zheng stood with his hands behind his back. He was wearing pitch black traditional attire, and when he released his aura, his clothes fluttered despite the lack of a breeze as he automatically assumed the air of a master.</p>

    <p>Father Zheng had been searching for evidence all this time after the plagiarism case, and it had been extremely difficult. The person behind the scenes had been gradually erasing all the evidence bit by bit — all of the results of Father Zheng's years of painstaking effort had already been released just now.</p>

    <p>The witnesses had disappeared, so he had to produce new witnesses.</p>

    <p>The evidence had disappeared, so he also had to produce new evidence.</p>

    <p>As Father Zheng was speaking, he had already sensed that the person he was looking for had already slipped into the auditorium without being noticed. This soundless infiltration was also the main method used in the serial killings at the apartments.</p>

    <p>"Student Liu Yi, isn't it time for you to come out?"</p>

    <p>"Liu Yi? Senior Liu Yi is here?" Everyone inside the auditorium was shocked.</p>

    <p>All the teachers and students, plus the police, also clearly heard the words via broadcast.</p>

    <p>"No way! Liu Yi wouldn't kill anyone! He wouldn't do something like that! Zheng Tianqiang, don't talk rubbish!" Principal Zhou Dongye stepped forward, an extremely agitated expression on his face.</p>

    <p>"Principal Zhou, do you have any evidence to back up your words?" Gao Tian looked askance at him.</p>

    <p>"Liu Yi... Liu Yi... He couldn't have done this! His entire golden core was removed in his first year of university because of a tumor! That's to say, he can't use any magic! He's a lot weaker than even an ordinary cultivator! Those three dead students were all at the Golden Core stage; Liu Yi wouldn't be able to defeat them at all! So it's impossible for him to be the murderer!" Principal Zhou said anxiously.</p>

    <p>"He can't be the murderer just because he can't use spiritual energy?" Father Zheng laughed. "Principal Zhou Dongye, until now you're still lying to yourself — how pathetic. He might not be able to use spiritual energy, but as long as he has a powerful enough rechargeable magic treasure, he can still do violence. Among my son Jingxuan's high school works, there was a design drawing for a magic treasure which could kill people through a screen without leaving a trace. Student Liu Yi stole this drawing and developed it... I want to ask Student Liu Yi, after stealing so many of my son's designs, have you paid the copyright fees for them?"</p>
