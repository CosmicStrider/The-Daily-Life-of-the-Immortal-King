  <h1>Chapter 21 A Dog </h1>

  <div>

    <p>A piece of chalk was the number one weapon hidden on school grounds.</p>

    <p>Today, Sun Rong's perspective had been thoroughly broadened... whether a weapon was powerful or not in fact had little to do with how much harm it could cause — the key was the person using it.</p>

    <p>A Shadow Stream flying knife or specially-made spirit bullet could easily pierce a human body, but Xu Feng couldn't have ever imagined that a little piece of chalk could have such horrible power!</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong put out one short leg to turn Xu Feng's body over as if it was a fried dumpling, and nodded with satisfaction. Mm... this piece of chalk had pierced right through Xu Feng's heart, so he was completely dead. The only thing that wasn't perfect was that there was too much blood.</p>

    <p>He bent down and pinched Xu Feng's chin to open his mouth, and then broke off a molar from inside.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong realized that the molar was actually dark green in color!</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong turned his head, his eyes crinkling as he smiled. "Did that frighten you?"</p>

    <p>It wasn't a fright so much as a shock!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong had completely never imagined that Lao Gudong, who taught the theory of history course, who always smiled and laughed and was deeply loved by the students, could be so powerful, attacking his enemies relentlessly and killing them decisively. Even a first-class Red Ribbon killer hadn't been able to put up a fight at all.</p>

    <p>"Lao Gudong, what is this?" Sun Rong stared at the molar in Lao Gudong's hand.</p>

    <p>"This is the last resort that Shadow Stream killers leave themselves. It contains poison and corpse powder. Once they feel that they will fail their mission, they'll bite down on this," said Lao Gudong.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was hit by a sudden realization.</p>

    <p>The reason why Shadow Stream had an international foothold was because of the organization's astounding reputation. This group of people would never ever betray their clients, or leave behind any clues. Of course, there were international records of Shadow Stream's failed missions, but in all these cases, the killers' bodies were never found.</p>

    <p>The poison and corpse powder inside the molar was the key; it not only guaranteed that the killers would never ever betray their clients, but also erased any clues the relevant authorities might discover on their bodies which could lead them back to Shadow Stream.</p>

    <p>Looking at the molar in Lao Gudong's hand, Sun Rong was greatly astonished again. As a first-rate Red Ribbon killer, Xu Feng may have realized that he was going to die, but he couldn't have known that the speed of a piece of chalk would be faster than him crunching down on his molar, so unexpectedly, his body had been left behind.</p>

    <p>For Shadow Stream, real failure was leaving behind any clues that could be traced back to them. A whole corpse of a Shadow Stream killer would undoubtedly provide Huaxiu's Anti-terrorism Division with important clues.</p>

    <p>Who the hell was Lao Gudong?</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's mouth was slightly agape as she looked at the amiable, fat man in front of her with some amazement.</p>

    <p>She finally understood why the school had assigned just Lao Gudong to accompany her... given his strength, any killer who made it here would just be offering their heads on a platter as they walked right into a trap!</p>

    <p>"I haven't fought in so long, my technique's deteriorated — there's actually so much blood."</p>

    <p>Looking at the large pool of blood on the floor, Lao Gudong frowned. "If I had been fast enough, there wouldn't have been any blood at all."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was stupefied. "Holy shit..."</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong took out a yellow Dao talisman, which Sun Rong immediately recognized as a function-type talisman; it had a purifying effect, and was more practical than OMO detergent. It could remove nine hundred and ninety-nine kinds of stains in an instant, without leaving any marks.</p>

    <p>After the flash of a spirit light, the blood on the floor was instantly cleaned up. Lao Gudong sighed again. "This Dao talisman is fucking expensive, I will have to ask Headmaster Chen to reimburse me!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>"I hope you will help me keep what happened today a secret." Lao Gudong smiled as he said this, and took a packet of <em>latiao </em>out of the drawer and placed it in Sun Rong's hand. "I am still the adorable fatty all of you know."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>This was a blatant bribe!</p>

    <p>Seeing that Sun Rong hadn't replied, Lao Gudong reluctantly took out another packet from his pocket, with the air of someone parting with treasure. "Student Sun Rong, these are the last two collector's edition packets of <em>latiao </em>which I have in my supplies."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Things were bound to be tense at Number 60 High School today, despite the fact that the students were under the school's protection. Lying under the sun in the school's small garden, Er Ha, who still had the soul of a demon king, could sense the thick murderous intent in the air.</p>

    <p>Though it was lying in the sun, it wasn't asleep at all.</p>

    <p>The small school garden was located behind the teaching building, and was a security blind spot on school grounds. Over the years, who knew how many students had given away their first kiss in the garden. It wasn't as if Er Ha envied them, though. In the first place, it was a toad by nature; moreover, it was a toad at the level of a demon king, so it had completely no interest in the little bitches of the world.</p>

    <p>To this day, it had remained chaste.</p>

    <p>It was thanks to the fact that it had maintained its integrity and wasn't the type to mess around that it hadn't been dragged off by Guo Hao to his family vet clinic to be forcibly sterilized.</p>

    <p>Er Ha yawned lazily, and was about to turn over and carry on lolling around when it heard rustling from the nearby manhole in the garden.</p>

    <p>Er Ha froze halfway through turning. Right now, Number 60 High School was protected inside and outside; there was also no way it would be Super Mario coming out from under the manhole cover. The only explanation was that there was an assassin attempting to enter the teaching building through this blind spot in the garden.</p>

    <p>Although this "fly" had yet to emerge, it couldn't evade Er Ha's spiritual perception. While its spirit energy was substantially suppressed in this restrictive body, it was nonetheless a fifth-ranked demon king, and naturally couldn't be bullied by a puny Golden Core cultivator. Last time, it had been unable to put up a fight in the classroom because of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But this time...</p>

    <p>Er Ha laughed in its heart.</p>

    <p>Just when it was worried about being bored, who would have thought there would be someone in a hurry to provide it some entertainment. It had already been too long since it had last fought — the last proper time was when it had still been a toad six years ago.</p>

    <p>It wagged its tail, stood up from the ground, and gnashed its teeth as it took an alert stance.</p>

    <p><em>As soon as I came to this planet, I was killed by a punch, and my primordial spirit was even contained. I struggled for six years before I was able to finally break off a sliver of my soul and escape, but because of a freak combination of factors, I was turned into a dog. That damn parrot harasses me in the classroom all day, and I can't rebel when that group of students willfully pinch my face. My past glory as a fifth-ranked demon king already no longer exists. Nowadays I have fallen to this extent, reduced to being a watchdog at this lousy school...</em></p>

    <p><em>However, I can still kill you bastards, can't I?!</em></p>

    <p>At this very moment, the manhole cover was lifted off, and a head emerged.</p>

    <p>Hardly had the person opened the cover when he felt a strange aura. He instantly narrowed his eyes, and stealthily sent out his spiritual senses.</p>

    <p>This aura was strong and weak in turns, appearing and disappearing fitfully...</p>

    <p>It took this person a long time to confirm the location of the target.</p>

    <p>Then, he was astounded to discover...</p>

    <p>A dog...</p>

    <p>...standing at a distance under the sun, glaring at him fiercely.</p>
