  <h1>Chapter 345 Going After the Chuunibyou </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Xiangyun Road, Songhai city.</p>

    <p>The key city high school funded by the Xiao clan was located on this road.</p>

    <p>After Zhuo Yi got in the car, Zhai Yin drove them to the Xiangyun Road intersection.</p>

    <p>The car rolled to a steady stop by the roadside. A blockade had already been set up on both sides of the road, and there were several military police guarding the intersection.</p>

    <p>"Is that the place?" Holding the sword, Wang Ming got out of the car. Down the rows of buildings, he could see from this distance Shenye High School's school flag, fluttering on the sports field.</p>

    <p>All the residents and pedestrians on Xiangyun Road had already been evacuated by the police before Zhuo Yi had arrived. Because this was an emergency, the students of Shenye High School had been quickly sent home before the flag could be lowered for the day. However, the most important thing was... there was no homework today!</p>

    <p>According to Zhuo Yi, all the students in the city who had eaten the unknown fruit were currently under the direct control of the General Administration of 100 Schools. They had all been sent to Second Cultivation Hospital's separate zone for isolated treatment, and it could be said that the situation had been contained to some extent.</p>

    <p>However, because the authorities had yet to determine the specific composition of this spirit fruit, there was no way to completely prevent it from generating spirit potential in these children's bodies. The hospital could only rely on physical or slightly more advanced chemical methods to suppress it.</p>

    <p>On the way to the school, Zhuo Yi had told Wang Ming that Director Li from Second Cultivation Hospital's separate zone had given him a call: all the specialists and medical personnel had given up their own break to show up at work, and had held an emergency discussion with a group of alchemists, which included Immortal Toya, from the Xiao clan.</p>

    <p>This situation couldn't drag on any longer; without effective preventive measures and with what equipment and drugs the hospital currently had, they could only keep this spirit potential from breaking out at the most until six o'clock in the morning the day after tomorrow. At that time, the spirit potential in these students' bodies would reach a saturation point before generating a spirit explosion.</p>

    <p>Naturally, there was one exception.</p>

    <p>That was Shenye High School's Xiao Yucheng.</p>

    <p>"We have confirmed that Xiao Yuncheng is on this road. He directly threw out several teams of military police when they went in earlier..." said Zhuo Yi, wiping at his sweat.</p>

    <p>"Threw them out? That fierce?" Wang Ming was startled.</p>

    <p>"That's right. They're Golden Core military police, but every single one was thrown out as if they were scarecrows, and they were completely unable to fight back." Zhuo Yi sighed. "Based on news from the hospital, they can still contain the kids that have been admitted until the morning of the day after tomorrow. But if we leave Xiao Yuncheng be, he'll explode at midnight tonight."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming nodded his head after hearing this.</p>

    <p>No wonder they had come out in full force here, even specially setting up a barrier at the intersection.</p>

    <p>"This barrier is a little weak." Zhai Yin curled her lips. "It won't be able to hold back a spirit explosion at all."</p>

    <p>"But at the very least, it can prevent Xiao Yuncheng from fleeing." Zhuo Yi glanced at the barrier. "A small-scale spirit explosion like this will affect all of Xiangyun Road and everything within a thirty-kilometer radius. Orders from the higher-ups are for us to minimize the damage as well as keep Xiao Yuncheng safe.</p>

    <p>"If there's nothing else to be done, we'll have to shoot him down. That spirit fruit devours minds; no one knows what will happen after that. The Xiao clan has already signed the agreement."</p>

    <p>"They even signed an agreement?" Wang Ming hadn't thought that the situation had become so serious. No wonder the first thing Zhuo Yi had done was to bring him here.</p>

    <p>Earlier in the car, Zhuo Yi had given Wang Ming some rough idea about the fruit's side effects. Apart from the continual generation of spirit potential ultimately resulting in a spirit explosion, it could devour minds. Furthermore, this side effect depended on a person's physique. Bluntly speaking... the more chuunibyou a person was, the larger the impact.</p>

    <p>Most Foundation Establishment students, including Wang Ling, were sixteen years old, and unfortunately, this was the very age they would become chuunibyou. Nowadays, with advancements in modern cultivation technology, it took less and less time to progress from the Body Refinement and Qi Condensation stages to the Foundation Establishment stage. Thousands of years ago, it would have taken most cultivators several hundreds years of great effort to reach the Foundation Establishment stage.</p>

    <p>Thus, in the current age of national cultivation, the biggest problem with having younger Foundation Establishment cultivators was that they weren't mature in their thinking.</p>

    <p>After all, Xiao Yuncheng was just a sixteen-year-old kid... One day suddenly realizing that his strength had skyrocketed, he definitely would have wondered if he was Heaven's chosen one, charged with saving the world. Of course his attitude would change.</p>

    <p>Seeing that Wang Ming seemed to be pondering something, Zhuo Yi couldn't help asking, "What is Lao Gudong thinking about?"</p>

    <p>"Hm... I just suddenly thought about my youth."</p>

    <p>He recalled that at that age, he had also contracted this chuunibyou disease. Although he knew he was older than Xiao Yuncheng by just a few years, sixteen years old was the watershed chuunibyou period.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "At that time, I especially liked reading novels, and then all day I would think about picking up an ancient magic weapon on the streets; the best would have been if there was some great grandfather or grandmother inside it."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "I also especially liked going out on trips, and I'd hope I would fall into some secret cave; such caves generally contain some lost martial arts..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin's lips couldn't help twitching at this; once again, Wang Ming had refreshed her understanding of what the word "simple" meant.</p>

    <p>The surrounding police officers and military police who heard this sunk into silence, making Zhuo Yi feel like the air had frozen solid!</p>

    <p>After a moment, the captain of the military police who had been responsible for making sure the barrier was set up broke the dead silence and said to Zhuo Yi, "Director Zhuo, we've already prepared an entry through the barrier entrance, but there's a problem..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "What is it?"</p>

    <p>"The entry uses a swipe system, and only those carrying the corresponding talisman can enter. But just now, the person who set up the barrier only made two..." When he said that, the captain could already feel Zhao Yin staring at him. He sneaked a look at her epaulet, and when he saw that she was a member of the Magnificent Immortal Special Army Brigade, he immediately broke into a cold sweat, and he even lowered his voice. "If you force your way through the barrier, you'll destroy its structure."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming nodded. "Then I'll go in with Director Zhuo. He's the commander of the operation this time."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin's face turned dark at these words.</p>

    <p>Looking at this scene now, Zhuo Yi finally realized that Wang Ming and Zhai Yin's relationship seemed a little "complicated," and instantly he felt a little awkward. "Will that... be alright?"</p>

    <p>"Why not? Women shouldn't meddle in men's business!" said Wang Ming. He even felt a little emotional in his heart - finally, he could escape this she-devil!</p>

    <p>But right after Wang Ming said that, the military police captain on the side suddenly opened his eyes wide as he carefully looked Zhai Yin up and down. He was definitely questioning her gender.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin silently clenched her fists and glared at him, and the captain suddenly felt cold intent permeate his head...</p>

    <p>Then, with the sound of a watermelon being cracked open, his helmet broke into several pieces that fell to the ground..</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Staring at the remains of his helmet, the captain was extremely frightened: love triangles were so scary!</p>
