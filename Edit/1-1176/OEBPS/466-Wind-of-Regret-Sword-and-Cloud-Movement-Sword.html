  <h1>Chapter 466 Wind of Regret Sword and Cloud Movement Sword </h1>

  <div>

    <p>For some reason, the Lady of the Castle felt that the name sounded a little familiar...</p>

    <p>Since she had come into contact with that teenager several times before, the Lady could almost be sure that he was an expert whose true strength was absolutely above True Immortal level. Of the Ten Saints that Mo Immortal Castle had hired previously, except for Third Saint who defected and left, Great Saint and Second Saint had been killed by the backlash from the teenager's aura.</p>

    <p>To be able to kill a powerful expert at the peak Soul Formation stage through backlash... there was absolutely no doubt as to how strong he was. But at that time, the Lady had judged that Wang Ling's realm was perhaps Itinerant Immortal level. Then the incidents with the old devil and the Master of Immortal Mansion had happened one after another, which had caused the Lady to revise her estimate of Wang Ling's strength.</p>

    <p>He was clearly a genuine True Immortal expert; even the Lord himself would find him difficult to be deal with. To fight a True Immortal, the only way was to seek help from another True Immortal. At the very least on the surface, their strength would be on the same level; it wouldn't be like with the Ten Saints they had hired before, who had died as soon as they'd made a move.</p>

    <p>True Immortal versus True Immortal... whatever the case, they should be evenly matched; a True Immortal wouldn't die from a single slap, right?</p>

    <p>The Lady pondered in her heart; she knew that the two people in front of her weren't simple, and this was a great opportunity to make friends with experts. But she didn't dare agree straightaway because it didn't seem proper somehow... For some reason, she had a bad sense of foreboding.</p>

    <p>President Bai couldn't help laughing. "If the Lady is really worried, you can send that person's location to Old Lu now and I'll have him go take a look immediately."</p>

    <p>Old Lu eased his grip on the black umbrella, but it didn't fall down; instead, it hovered on its own in the air over President Bai - it turned out this umbrella didn't need to be held!</p>

    <p>Noticing the Lady's hesitation, Old Lu felt a little uncomfortable at his strength being questioned, so he decided to demonstrate the Spell of Creation and Rebirth for her.</p>

    <p>He turned his head to look around her office and finally saw a spirit sword hanging on the wall. This sword wasn't some ornament at all, but was a holy weapon; Old Lu could tell at a glance.</p>

    <p>"Is this sword yours, Lady?" Staring at the spirit sword, Old Lu didn't move from his position as another rattan arm stretched out from the front of his jacket to fetch the spirit sword from a distance.</p>

    <p>The Lady was startled. This sword was part of the Lord's collection, the Wind of Regret sword. Its quality wasn't very high as it was merely eighth class. However, this sword had a damage effect commonly known as "wind damage." Once someone was hit by the sword, the wound wouldn't heal easily in a short period of time. Nonetheless, the Lord had bought it more as a collector's item and not just because of its wind damage special effect.</p>

    <p>Most importantly, this sword was one of a pair. This one was named Wind of Regret and the other sword was called Cloud Movement. Both swords carried wind attributes, but one was Yin and the other Yang. Together, they could combine into a single sword which was rumored to be capable of exhibiting the power of a world-defying magic weapon.</p>

    <p>Back then, the Lord had hoarded this sword in his collection with the idea of finding the second sword someday. Unfortunately, however, the Cloud Movement sword had been destroyed, and only its ruined hilt remained in the museum.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the value of this Wind of Regret sword had instantly dropped in the Lord's eyes.</p>

    <p>But that was something that had already happened hundreds of years ago.</p>

    <p>The Lord had shelved this Wind of Regret sword and it was now with the Lady.</p>

    <p>"This is the Wind of Regret sword. Perhaps Mr Lu has heard of it? This is part of our Lord's collection," replied the Lady.</p>

    <p>"No wonder this sword seems a little familiar, like I've seen it somewhere before."</p>

    <p>Mr Lu couldn't help cocking an eyebrow as he laughed. "You said earlier that your Mo Immortal Castle is in a financial slump. Then why don't you sell this sword? Although its match Cloud Movement is broken, this spirit sword is worth a lot of money given its damage effect."</p>

    <p>"The Lord has said that no matter how poor we are, we cannot sell his collector items wantonly. The Wind of Regret sword has been around for a long time, so it can be regarded as an antique," replied the Lady.</p>

    <p>Mr Lu muttered to himself a little and didn't continue asking questions. Anyway, he just wanted to show off a few tricks. Thinking this, he handed the Wind of Regret sword to the Lady, then pointed to his head. "Lady, use this sword and slash at my head, please."</p>

    <p>The Lady was stunned; this was quite the fearless move. In the absence of the protection of magical barriers, an Itinerant Immortal would only be completely immune to magic weapons below the holy grade - even if the Wind of Regret sword was just an eighth-class weapon, this was looking down a little too much on the damage that an eighth-class holy weapon could inflict.</p>

    <p>Most importantly, its damage effect was very real.</p>

    <p>Back then, the Lord had once courted death by cutting the back of his hand as an experiment.</p>

    <p>Without the use of medication, it had still taken as long as seven days for the wound to scab over completely, even given the Lord's realm.</p>

    <p>"It's fine, please feel free to make a move, Lady; there is absolutely no need to be polite about it."</p>

    <p>Mr Lu was clearly extremely confident in his ability to heal himself. "This damage effect may work on others, but its effect on me is almost negligible since my self-healing ability is far greater than the sword's ability to inflict damage. Of course, if it were a world-defying magic weapon, it would just barely hurt me. But in today's world, world-defying magic weapons can almost be disregarded..."</p>

    <p>President Bai nodded and smiled. "Old Lu is right. Furthermore, even if a world-defying magic weapon exists, it would have long already come under secret state protection."</p>

    <p>"A country that can control one or two world-defying magic weapons has enough deterrence to keep other nations at bay. But this type of magic weapon is often very powerful, and there is no way it will be used so casually unless war breaks out among nations."</p>

    <p>The conversation between the two men was direct and frank.</p>

    <p>Of course, matters at state level were too far away for the Lady and Mo Immortal Castle.</p>

    <p>At present, Mo Immortal Castle's intelligence service was limited to just several major cities in Huaxiu nation. It wasn't completely widespread yet, and had yet to catch on in the country, so venturing overseas was still a long way away.</p>

    <p>"Mr Lu is talking about things that are too distant."</p>

    <p>The Lady cupped her fists in salute, the Wind of Regret sword in one hand. "Since Mr Lu has confidence, I'll give it a go."</p>

    <p>Right after the Lady spoke, President Bai snapped his fingers, and she saw that black umbrella suspended above his head suddenly enlarge to form an airtight barrier.</p>

    <p>"This is an independent barrier to ensure that the Lady's office won't be destroyed." The abnormally pale young man smiled and raised his hand. "Please slash at him with all your might, Lady."</p>

    <p>The Lady: "Very well... but is it really alright for me to use all my strength?"</p>

    <p>Mr Lu: "No problem, I have an iron head."</p>

    <p>The Lady: "..."</p>
