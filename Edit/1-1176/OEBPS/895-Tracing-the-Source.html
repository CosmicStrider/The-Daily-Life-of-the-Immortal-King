  <h1>Chapter 895 Tracing the Source</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Although these three scabbards weren't made to Wang Ling's taste, in the end, Luo Chuang had put all his heart into them, so it wasn't nice for Wang Ling to directly turn them down. Thus, Lord Diulei was entrusted with delivering the scabbards to Wang Ling's place.</p>

    <p>When Lord Diulei arrived, it was to a rare scene, which only happened once in a blue moon in the Wang family's small villa. The old man, Mother Wang and Father Wang were actually all sitting on the sofa watching the same TV drama. This was an ancient drama series which had been popular recently, called <em>Do You Know? Do You Know? You Should Be Gong While I'm Shou <sup>1</sup> </em>, which told the story of three crossdressing bigwigs who returned home after getting sex changes in Thailand, and who became embroiled in household strife with the goal of finding a good man to marry...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Adapted from the TV drama
"Do You Know? It Should Be a
Wilting Flower Amongst The
Lush Leaves," more
commonly known in English
as "The Story of Minglan.")</dfn>

    <p>Because of the bizarre storyline, and twists and turns in the plot, and the complicated relationships featured, the drama drew in many young men and women, uncles and aunts. It had become a phenomenon in the past month, and at one point had even surpassed <em>Story of Yanxi Palace </em>and <em>Ruyi's Royal Love in the Palace </em>.</p>

    <p>Looking at this scene, Lord Diulei knew that the new Lightning Dharmaraja, Wei Yingluo <sup>2</sup> , who had called down a thunderbolt to kill the previous imperial concubine, was probably already rolling around in her grave...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(The name of the female
protagonist of "Story of Yanxi
Palace.")</dfn>

    <p>When Lord Diulei entered, Mother Wang had no time to entertain him. The TV drama was on and he was someone they already knew, so she told him to help himself. "Little Lei! The tea is in the kitchen; make a cup for yourself if you want a drink! Just make yourself at home! I've already fermented the broccoli wine for you; it's in the basement. If you want a drink, bring it up yourself."</p>

    <p>First time strangers and second time friends - Mother Wang already thoroughly considered Lord Diulei one of their own, and he was overwhelmed by her greeting. Although he was now known as "the world's first True Venerated," he was still a little brother in the Wang family's small villa...</p>

    <p>The three old seniors currently watching a drama on the sofa also caused Lord Diulei to ponder deeply: what kind of TV drama could draw in these three old seniors, who had become disillusioned with the world and had retired to live ordinary lives, to such an extent... This was worth thinking about.</p>

    <p>"When I go home today, I'll finish watching this drama..." Lord Diulei made up his mind. In fact, the drama was still being aired halfway, but since the Office of Strategic Deception's sudden rise, more and more production companies wanted to cooperate with them as they planned to rent some areas of the Office of Strategic Deception for filming.</p>

    <p>It was precisely because of this that Lord Diulei had the contacts of plenty production company bigwigs in his cell phone.</p>

    <p>He could directly ask them for any drama he wanted.</p>

    <p>Waiting for Toilet Lid Network to cut out half an hour in post-production every day was too long.</p>

    <p>There was no end to comprehending Heavenly Dao; it had to be done as soon as possible - the sooner, the better!</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei called out first before going upstairs.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling could already see the three "sheaths <sup>3</sup> " in Senior Immortal's hands as he came up the stairs...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(The Chinese word 套子 is also
used colloquially to refer to
condoms ..)</dfn>

    <p>Well...</p>

    <p>They were actually sword scabbards.</p>

    <p>But Luo Chuang's descriptions of them were so dirty that it was impossible not to take it the wrong way.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought he had still been a pretty pure person before entering Number 60 High.</p>

    <p>Now, he had been led astray!</p>

    <p>Almost every class would have several kings of being dirty. In their Grade One, Class Three, for example, their biggest king was Guo Hao. Apart from gossip, what this guy most like to do was talk dirty, frequently switching gears abruptly and catching people off-guard.</p>

    <p>When he entered the room, Lord Diulei placed the scabbards on Wang Ling's desk and saw that Wang Ling was researching something.</p>

    <p>"What is Brother Ling looking for?" Lord Diulei asked.</p>

    <p>"Little Master is looking for information on a scabbard, woof." Lying on the ground, Er Ha yawned lazily.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Sure enough, Brother Luo's three scabbards aren't good enough..."</p>

    <p>"Little Master said it wasn't good to discourage him, so he took them, woof."</p>

    <p>Saying this, Er Ha sighed. "Actually, it isn't a problem with the scabbards. Luo Chuang even used his family's ancestral Amitayus wood; it's very clear to see how committed he is. However, it isn't easy to make Lord Jingke stay quietly in the scabbard. If you don't believe me, want to try putting him in one?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei nodded. He randomly picked up the tight scabbard and tried to approach Jingke, but then felt a strong resistance; he couldn't get close at all, let alone stick Jingke into the scabbard.</p>

    <p>"See that?" Er Ha said, "Lord Jingke is used to being naked, so he isn't used to being in a scabbard. His relationship with the scabbard is like Pikachu's relationship with the pokeball: you can't force him to go in."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "But Little Master Ling also said that Lord Jingke can only demonstrate his true power with a scabbard."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Why aren't you saying 'woof' anymore, Brother Dog?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Screw 'woof'... Even after being a dog for such a long time, it still feels more comfortable to croak."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling hadn't decided to look for Jingke's scabbard on the spur of the moment - it was something he had thought of for a long time already, and he had planned to use his free time during the summer break to do so. Whether a scabbard was custom-made or modified, it definitely wouldn't be as good as the original.</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang had used Amitayus wood as the main material to custom make the scabbards, but at most they could only be used as spares. What Wang Ling was looking for now was Jingke's original scabbard from back then.</p>

    <p>Everyone knew that Jingke was a peach wood sword which Father Wang had bought at the flower and bird market for 998 HNY.</p>

    <p>It was just that Jingke hadn't awoken back then.</p>

    <p>Jingke's origins had always been a mystery. Wang Ling had quietly investigated many leads all these years, and the only thing he had confirmed was Jingke's identity as "Lord of sword spirits," while there was very little on Jingke's origins. Even the sword spirits who called Jingke His Majesty Lord of Swords didn't know why they kowtowed to him.</p>

    <p>According to the sword spirit of Evil Sword God's Heaven-Cleaving sword, his panic back then had purely been involuntary... when he sensed Jingke's formidable power, he blurted out "Your Majesty Lord of Swords" for no reason, like a knee-jerk reaction.</p>

    <p>Thus, for these sword spirits, it was like the people of a kingdom genuflecting to their king.</p>

    <p>It just felt natural.</p>

    <p>Puzzling over this, Wang Ling was at that moment flipping through Book of Sage Immortal for information.</p>

    <p>He was looking at information from ten years ago. Father Wang couldn't quite remember the moment he bought Jingke. He didn't even have an invoice, and only had a rough idea.</p>

    <p>Thus, Wang Ling could only have Book of Sage Immortal do a rough search for when Father Wang had gone to the flower and bird market.</p>

    <p>He had to investigate the background of the flower and bird market as well as the vendor who sold Jingke to Father Wang back then - he would start his search at the source, to help Jingke find his scabbard.</p>
