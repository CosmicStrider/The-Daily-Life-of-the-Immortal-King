  <h1>Chapter 713 Irascible Dharmaraja and Evil Tiger Pounces And Eats Straight Men Cultivators Association</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It turned out that the key element wasn't the sword, but the eyeshadow...</p>

    <p>Looking at this Evil Sword God who had "suddenly returned to normal" but clearly wasn't fully cured, the Old Devil fell into deep thought.</p>

    <p>It was obvious that Evil Sword God had a split personality which only showed up under specific circumstances.</p>

    <p>At the same time, General Bai couldn't stop wondering after making this discovery, as an obvious problem had now made itself known.</p>

    <p>When Evil Sword God had killed Sword Immortal Fan Rui back then, which personality had done it?</p>

    <p>This was a crucial question because it would become a major consideration when Evil Sword God was formally sentenced in the future.</p>

    <p>Also, General Bai was suddenly curious about another question...</p>

    <p>If eyeshadow was applied to just one of Evil Sword God's eyes... what would happen?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, the sky roiled over Peiyuan district's public square.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Ling had a very familiar feeling, which was very similar to when the Gate Between Worlds descended six years ago.</p>

    <p>"Get ready, everyone!"</p>

    <p>That black-faced teacher from Tianshi Imperial High School stood at the very front. Then, spirit light suddenly blossomed in his hand like a lotus, and in its glow, he slowly flew up to the sky inside a multicolored box.</p>

    <p>"It's finally here..." At that moment, Lao Gudong looked at the sky.</p>

    <p>"Teacher, what's this?" someone asked.</p>

    <p>"The Rainbow Glass Box, part of Huaxiu Alliance's repository of magic treasures, which is in the care of Wu Zhenjun, the captain of the teachers this time." Lao Gudong gazed at the dark-faced teacher up ahead, and only then did everyone know the latter's name.</p>

    <p>"Teacher Wu's awesome! But where have I heard this surname 'Wu' before?"</p>

    <p>"Wu Zhenjun is the son of the famous maestro Irascible Dharmaraja Wu Yifan."</p>

    <p>"Lucky Dharmaraja <sup>1</sup> ?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The Chinese words for
"irascible" and "lucky" share
the same pinyin, "zao hua.")</dfn>

    <p>"No, Irascible Dharmaraja."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Speaking of the origin of this Daoist name, we have to start with the dispute between Daoist Wu Yifan and Evil Tiger Pounces And Eats Straight Men Cultivators Association <sup>2</sup> ."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is a jab at the online feud
between Chinese singer Kris
Wu and Chinese media
platform Hupu (literal
translation: Tiger Pouncing)
after a Hupu user posted a
video of Wu singing very
poorly.)</dfn>

    <p>Hearing this, a lot of people knew that Lao Gudong was about to start gossiping yet again...</p>

    <p>"Back then, Daoist Wu and Evil Tiger Pounces And Eats Straight Men Cultivators Association dished out dirt on each other. In the end, the Association found an audio recording of Daoist Wu singing in the shower... It was said that listening to the recording could trigger an irascible temper and you couldn't help smashing bowls, both big and round, or wanting to put the flour paste in the bowl on your face <sup>3</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(Excerpts of lyrics from Kris
Wu's rap track "Big Bowl Thick
Noodle .. ")</dfn>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't know if he had seen wrong, but he thought that after Lao Gudong said this, the face of Wu Zhenjun in the sky seemed to grow even darker.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"It takes a huge amount of spirit power to power the Rainbow Glass Box, but Wu Zhenjun isn't flushed nor is he gasping for breath - he's truly remarkable." As he introduced this lead teacher, Lao Gudong couldn't help sighing emotionally. "Huaxiu Alliance appointing Teacher Wu as the captain this time truly was the correct decision."</p>

    <p>"Hahaha, then how big is the gap between Lao Gudong and this Teacher Wu?" Someone couldn't help laughing.</p>

    <p>Generally speaking, the faces of most teachers when asked this sort of question would immediately darken. The thing, however, was that Lao Gudong wasn't afraid at all; wherever you went, a thick skin was always the most important.</p>

    <p>Looking at Wu Zhenjun, Lao Gudong couldn't help laughing. "Naturally, I can't compete with Wu Zhenjun. He's amazing, after all!"</p>

    <p>Yet another person stirred the pot. "Roughly how many pieces of chalk would you need, to shoot him dead?"</p>

    <p>Lao Gudong pretended to think about it, and then replied seriously, "Maybe ten."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "Haha, Lao Gudong really likes to joke around. Honestly speaking, if they really fought, I feel that Wu Zhenjun would come out on top, except when it comes to weight!"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "Don't look down on the fatty; who knows, he might be for real!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>A few minutes later, the Rainbow Glass Box officially did its thing. Floating in the sky, it emitted a beam of light which enveloped all the students, the teachers leading them, the research team as well as the medical personnel in the square.</p>

    <p>In the blink of an eye, the dense crowd of people in the square disappeared.</p>

    <p>Then, a crack appeared in the sky...</p>

    <p>In the cockpit of the Rainbow Glass Box, Wu Zhenjun swiftly flew the box into the crack.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Is this the secret entrance to Devil Valley?" President Han Di, who was next to Zhuo Yi, asked.</p>

    <p>Staring into the sky, Zhuo Yi heaved a sigh. "Sir, would you please stop pretending to be President Han Di?"</p>

    <p>The fake President Han Di's eyes instantly turned cold.</p>

    <p>After a long silence, this fake President Han Di finally tore off the fake skin mask that was on his face. Underneath it was an extremely old and heavily wrinkled face.</p>

    <p>"Eighth on the Dark Network's battle strength rankings, and currently the most wanted S-Class target in Huaxiu, Myriad Faces Old Man." Zhuo Yi directly reeled off this fake President Han Di's background and personal information. He gazed at Myriad Faces Old Man and said sternly, "Because of your powerful transfiguration technique, we've never been able to get any leads on you. Who would have thought you would actually deliver yourself to us this time?"</p>

    <p>Myriad Faces Old Man's strength lay in the fact that his transfiguration technique could deceive even the most sophisticated transfiguration detection instrument to date. Although he wasn't strong battle-wise, he was a very tricky enemy.</p>

    <p>Myriad Faces Old Man frowned. "May I ask, when did Director Zhuo find out?"</p>

    <p>"Since the beginning... As for the real President Han Di who's hidden himself in the medical team, oh no, to be exact, it should be Night Chief's Second President Dylan, who has assumed President Han Di's identity, we let him in on purpose," Zhuo Yi replied.</p>

    <p>Actually, Zhuo Yi himself hadn't realized it at first... But Wang Ling had been in the public square!</p>

    <p>Who could hide from <em>shifu's </em> eyes!</p>

    <p>Myriad Faces Old Man: "It appears that Director Zhuo's reputation isn't an empty one, to be able to hold this position."</p>

    <p>"Seize him!"</p>

    <p>The special duty personnel whom Zhuo Yi had positioned near the public square early on removed their invisibility talismans one after another and rushed forward.</p>

    <p>Each of the six special duty personnel was a Nascent Soul expert. They were elites who had been directly dispatched by Huaxiu Alliance HQ to ensure the capture of Myriad Faces Old Man.</p>

    <p>Keeping an eye on Myriad Faces Old Man, the six people formed hand seals and worked together to use a repression spell on him.</p>

    <p>Myriad Faces Old Man, however, was completely unafraid, and chuckled as he fixed his eyes on Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, he took a flash bomb out of his pocket and threw it!</p>

    <p>The bright light lasted for just one very short instant. Myriad Faces Old Man had no time to escape at all, so in that moment, he promptly made a decision, and transformed himself into Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>"An instant transfiguration?" Zhuo Yi was slightly astonished; this type of transfiguration was a little beyond his imagination.</p>

    <p>This already was beyond the hand speed of an eighteen-year-old single man...</p>

    <p>There were two identical Director Zhuos. Which one should they capture?</p>

    <p>For a split second, the six special duty personnel were bewildered.</p>

    <p>"No choice!"</p>

    <p>In that moment, Zhuo Yi acted quickly in the face of the emergency.</p>

    <p>Myriad Faces Old Man absolutely wouldn't have the long johns that Zhuo Yi was wearing!</p>

    <p>So, in front of the crowd, Zhuo Yi took off his belt and looked like he was about to take off his pants...</p>

    <p>But before he could completely do so, Myriad Faces Old Man, disguised as Zhuo Yi, had already been suppressed by a strong ring of light on the other side!</p>

    <p>Myriad Faces Old Man was hugely alarmed. "How... How did you know?!"</p>

    <p>He had actually been seen through in a flash!</p>

    <p>A special duty personnel sneered. "Because you're not as perverted as Director Zhuo!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>
