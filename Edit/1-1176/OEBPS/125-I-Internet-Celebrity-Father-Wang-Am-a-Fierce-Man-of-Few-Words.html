  <h1>Chapter 125 I, Internet Celebrity Father Wang, Am a Fierce Man of Few Words </h1>

  <div>

    <p>There was a saying that God helped those who helped themselves, which Father Wang thought fit the current situation very well.</p>

    <p>In the end, Er Ha dragged this experienced Officer Wang away by one of his boots...</p>

    <p>It so happened that Wang Ling had just got home from school; as soon as he opened the door, he saw Er Ha's back legs as it gripped Officer Wang's boot between its teeth and rudely dragged him out of the house; the experienced Officer Wang was utterly discomfited as he yelled, "We part-timers also have human rights!"</p>

    <p>Right after he said this, Er Ha gave the man a godly dog tail whip <sup>1</sup> and then directly punched him in his round belly with a dog fist. Then, Wang Ling saw this man's body, which had to be over two hundred jin in weight, fly more than twenty meters through the air until he landed with his butt sticking up in a weird, gay-looking pose.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A godly dog tail whip is just a
funny way of referring to how
dogs sometimes shove their
butts in the faces of other
dogs.)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling entered the Wang family's small villa, the atmosphere was unusually heavy. After seeing the injury on Mother Wang's forehead, his face quickly darkened.</p>

    <p>The old man slapped his leg. "As soon as that boy came in, I knew he wasn't reliable! But I didn't realize it would be to that extent! Messing with us by sending a part-timer — do they think we citizens are monkeys to be played around with?!"</p>

    <p>Mother Wang comforted him. "Dad, how about we just forget it? I'm not badly hurt anyway. At the most, I was slandered a little."</p>

    <p>In the space of a few seconds, Wang Ling had used his Mind-Reading Ability to grasp the whole story.</p>

    <p><em>...Very good!</em></p>

    <p><em>Molesting the mother of the Immortal King... and even fucking daring to hit her!</em></p>

    <p><em>Fucker, you're in big trouble now!</em></p>

    <p>Wang Ling took a deep breath as he tried his best to calm his thoughts. Then, he drew a portrait from Mother Wang's memory using his Memory Sketch Skill — it was a young man with a height of roughly one hundred and seventy-eight centimetres. He had a mohawk and a tattoo on his right arm, and was heavily accessorized.</p>

    <p>Mother Wang stared at the paper and immediately identified him. "Right, Ling Ling's drawing is accurate, that's him!"</p>

    <p>The old man looked at the image and nodded, before he then turned to Wang Ling. "Can you find this man?"</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "Given the reach of Ling Ling's spiritual sense, it certainly wouldn't be difficult for him to find this person in Songhai city. But I remember Ling Ling said before that spiritual sense this thing is like a generator — the wider the coverage, the more power it gives off. By then, it would probably shut down the power grid in the whole of Songhai city, right?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling bowed his head in tacit admission of the truth in Father Wang's words.</p>

    <p>"Forget it, just leave it to me to find this person..."</p>

    <p>With that, Father Wang took out a lighter and lit up a cigarette with a <em>pa. </em>He put the cigarette in his mouth and took a long puff before exhaling smoke like a dragon; the light reflecting off the lens of his glasses hid the dark look in his eyes. "As for how to deal with this mohawk when we find him, Ling Ling, do as you see fit... however, we still have to adhere to our Wang family precepts. Don't just simply attack and kill him... the best is if you can get this fellow sent to the hospital! And if his lower half never gets up again! ( <em>Fuck! Dare hurt my woman, you bastard, you're looking to die! </em>)</p>

    <p>The old man and Wang Ling both shivered.</p>

    <p>Father Wang had turned completely evil...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Actually, a lot of unfair things happened in society. For the last several eras, the common people hadn't had the power to speak out, while conflict between cultivators was basically solved through battle. Back then, realm was king and prowess was honored — strength represented everything.</p>

    <p>But it was now the Spirit Energy Information era, where lawful checks and balances applied to both ordinary people and cultivators.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, it had to be said that in cases such as groping, the law was clearly not a strong enough deterrent.</p>

    <p>Perhaps most women who encountered this type of situation would choose to hatefully endure it, since they felt it was better to avoid unnecessary trouble.</p>

    <p>Of course, there were also women like Mother Wang who were brave enough to come forward and identify the perverts.</p>

    <p>But sometimes doing this didn't necessarily work; one of the main factors was the indifference of onlookers. They would rather stand to one side and take pictures than be willing to stand up and speak out. Most hateful of all was when online keyboard warriors <sup>2</sup> would directly blame the female victims, whether it was their fault or not, and berate them for wearing too little!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>('Keyboard warrior' is a
Chinese colloquial term to
describe online users who
have no qualms about judging
or attacking other people
online, but are not brave
enough to do it in real life.)</dfn>

    <p>In the end, even if police reports were lodged, these would usually amount to nothing.</p>

    <p>As the experienced Officer Wang had said, in public places such as the subway and other mass transit which had massive numbers of passengers, if the gropers weren't caught on the spot, it would be utterly nonsensical to expect the cultivation police to waste time staring at a monitor screen day and night as they checked for perverts.</p>

    <p>And even if these groping perverts were finally caught, they would just be detained for fifteen days. Furthermore, if the groper had connections, they might just have a cup of tea in the police station before being released...</p>

    <p>As a result, most of the common people would feel depressed and helpless when they had to deal with incidents like these.</p>

    <p>But unfortunately for this groper with the mohawk, he had touched a member of Wang Ling's family...</p>

    <p>This time, Father Wang insisted he would be the one to find this person, and wouldn't allow Wang Ling to help him out, for two main reasons.</p>

    <p>For one thing, Father Wang was still thinking about the city he lived in. To run the risk of economic losses from the shutdown of the entire city's power grid in Wang Ling's search for a scumbag wasn't worth it. Furthermore, as a man whose wife had been the one to be bullied, Father Wang felt that it would be too cowardly to rely on his son to fight back!</p>

    <p>It was just looking for one person... that wasn't hard to do at all!</p>

    <p>If realm and prowess were Wang Ling's weapons...</p>

    <p>Then, as an ordinary person who didn't possess spirit energy, Father Wang also had his own special measures!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Without bothering to eat dinner, Father Wang started to get busy in his study as he signed into his Weibo account. He rarely logged on, and his last post had been half a year ago. He didn't like to log onto Weibo because there were always four types of people on his page.</p>

    <p>Type 1: trolls.</p>

    <p>Type 2: trolls who liked to blindly follow the crowd.</p>

    <p>Type 3: the 'demand more' party <sup>3</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(The 'demand more' party" is a
literal translation of 催更党 cui
geng tang, which refers to
readers who pester authors to
update with new chapters for
ongoing online novels ..)</dfn>

    <p>And Type 4: members of the 'demand more' party who liked to blindly follow the crowd.</p>

    <p>Of course, overall there were still more of the third and fourth types.</p>

    <p>Father Wang involuntarily looked at the verification badge on his Weibo page and his profile information: "Best-selling novelist guru Wang Situ from the Cultivation Reading Network." Their operations department had helped him get his page verified in order to promote his novels.</p>

    <p>Because he hadn't been on Weibo for a long time, the entire webpage froze for two minutes as soon as he logged on, due to the crazy number of private messages he had received.</p>

    <p>He looked at his fan numbers — <em>heh </em>, good! He hadn't been online for half a year, but his fans had actually increased by more than a million!</p>

    <p>Father Wang remembered that his Weibo fans had already hit three million half a year ago on his webpage — now there were unexpectedly a million more.</p>

    <p>Father Wang didn't know how effective these four million fans could be.</p>

    <p>But given the current situation, he had to rely on the power of his Weibo fans now to direct public opinion in the search for this hateful mohawk.</p>

    <p>As an Internet celebrity among the common people, the power of public opinion was the strongest weapon that Father Wang could muster!</p>

    <p><em>Well then, let me first test how lively it can get...</em></p>

    <p>Father Wang lit a cigarette, then quickly typed a string of words and posted on Weibo for the first time in six months. "Good evening, everyone."</p>

    <p>As soon as he posted the message, the webpage instantly froze again...</p>

    <p>By the time it was working normally, the number of thumbs-ups on this Weibo post had already hit one thousand in less than a minute!</p>

    <p>It was then followed by a flurry of comments.</p>

    <p>"Oh my god! Guru Wang Situ actually posted on Weibo!"</p>

    <p>"What post is this?! Go type words! There was only one new chapter today! But if you dress like a girl and show us, I'll forgive you for it!"</p>

    <p>"It was really worth it waiting every day on Weibo for the 'demand more' party to catch the author; <em>hehe </em>, today we finally caught a live one!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the bedroom next door, Wang Ling couldn't help lamenting: waiting every day for half a fucking year to catch the author... the 'demand more' party was really too scary!</p>
