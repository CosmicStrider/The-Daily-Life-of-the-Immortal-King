  <h1>Chapter 344 Ai... Being a Tsundere Can Ruin One's Life! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ming realized a very serious problem - he had been thoroughly duped by President Qi! If Zhai Yin hadn't told him the truth today herself, he would have never thought that she would actually turn out to be a girl! He was amazed to realize that there were actually three genders in the world: male, female... and Zhai Yin...</p>

    <p>At that moment, he felt some despair! Why, why had she told him this?!</p>

    <p>Now that she had revealed her identity, Wang Ming was well aware that this fellow was completely focused on him. It was already impossible for him to hide this matter from her. If he wanted to leave, he would have to go through her.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming gritted his teeth. "Big sister, I'm begging you; give me a break, let me go..."</p>

    <p>"Not a chance." She shook her head, her tone cold and indifferent.</p>

    <p>Seeing that negotiations had failed, Wang Ming let out a helpless sigh and leaned against the door of the lab. "Something happened at my little brother's school; you know about it, right? I have to go and help him."</p>

    <p>"Are you talking about the Shuigou Sect incident?" Zhai Yin's eyes turned dark. Of course she knew. The matter had stirred up the media two hours ago. When she'd unlocked her phone, almost all her push notifications had been about this incident.</p>

    <p>But when she saw how serious he was in wanting to go and help, she couldn't help sneering. "What do you think you can do? Are you a cultivator? Savior of the world? There'll be someone else who'll handle it, while my job here is to safeguard your brain."</p>

    <p>He smiled bitterly but couldn't help retorting, "Don't look down on me. Given my brain, even the square root of my IQ would still be higher than yours."</p>

    <p>After saying that, he could feel an obvious drop in the temperature around him.</p>

    <p>She stared at him coldly. "Say that again?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming didn't look her in the eye, and hurriedly turned away as he corrected himself. "Hm, what I meant to say is that you can follow me, but don't get in my way. My little brother rarely texts me for help, how can I refuse?"</p>

    <p>She gritted her teeth. "Don't worry. President Qi only assigned me to protect your brain. If you die, it has nothing to do with me."</p>

    <p>"Fine! That's great! Whatever you do, don't interfere!"</p>

    <p>After saying this cheerfully, Wang Ming crossed his arms over his chest. Like an outraged young man from a proper family whose modesty was being threatened, he looked at her as if she was scum. "Even if my brain is gone, you'll never obtain my body!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>His expression was so infuriating; enraged, Zhai Yin clenched her fists and gritted her teeth hard.</p>

    <p>After a moment, she drew in a sharp breath, then let Wang Ming pass, tacitly allowing him to carry out this operation.</p>

    <p>In the surveillance room, President Qi was drinking coffee, his expression calm and composed as he gazed at the monitor screen.</p>

    <p>Old Qi was someone who had been around the block; with an exchange of just one or two words, he could already understand the situation between these youngsters.</p>

    <p>Although he didn't know what had happened between them, there were some things that in the end couldn't be conveyed with just words. Actually, apart from Zhai Yin's gender, another thing that Wang Ming didn't know was that when President Qi had been about to assign him an official bodyguard back then, it had been Zhai Yin herself who had applied to come here.</p>

    <p>President Qi acknowledged that there was no way someone like him could have pulled someone over from a place like Magnificent Immortal Special Army Brigade.</p>

    <p>Thus, when he saw the two of them quarrel before leaving the lab...</p>

    <p>President Qi sipped his coffee and couldn't help sighing. "Nowadays, being a tsundere can ruin one's life..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin drove the Aoguanhai combat vehicle, and at Wang Ming's instruction, stopped in front of the office of the General Administration of 100 Schools. After texting Wang Ming, Wang Ling had also texted Zhuo Yi, who then knew that Wang Ming would be coming, and was already waiting for him on the ground floor.</p>

    <p>It could be said that they were racing against time now. Deputy Director Zhong Lang had just rushed here from home, and was now upstairs in Zhuo Yi's place dealing with that bunch from the media outlets who were here every day looking for a scoop.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi stood next to the car deferentially, and Wang Ming slowly wound down the window and glanced at him. "You're Zhuo Yi? Get in!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming had heard of Zhuo Yi, both from Wang Ling and from the news on recent events. This exemplary director was more or less linked to almost every hot issue shaking the nation.</p>

    <p>Of course, Wang Ming was well aware that the reason Zhuo Yi had become involved in these issues probably had to do with Wang Ling creating chaos.</p>

    <p>In some sense, he felt sorry for Zhuo Yi, who already had to bear so much at such a young age.</p>

    <p>After getting in the car, Zhuo Yi surveyed Wang Ming with trepidation.</p>

    <p>He knew that his shifu had an elder male cousin, but he had personally never seen him before. Meeting him for the first time, Zhuo Yi was astounded by the logo on Wang Ming's white gown and the medal pinned to his chest. This was a medal worn by state academicians. Furthermore, this was a ten-star medal; there were less than three people in the entire nation who were qualified to wear it.</p>

    <p>After seeing this medal, Zhuo Yi also glanced at the epaulet on Zhai Yin's shoulder, and he instantly swore in his heart.</p>

    <p>Magnificent Immortal Special Army Brigade...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was shocked!</p>

    <p>Wang Ming couldn't help smiling as he looked at Zhuo Yi and said, "You don't have to be nervous. This person in the front is just my female bodyguard and driver."</p>

    <p>When he said this, he specially stressed the word "female," and the corners of Zhai Yin's mouth trembled slightly.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was once again startled. Dri- driver? To invite a person from Magnificent Immortal Special Army Brigade to come over and be a driver? This was too much! As expected of shifu's elder cousin!</p>

    <p>"This is the first time I've heard of female soldiers in Magnificent Immortal Special Army Brigade," he exclaimed.</p>

    <p>"That's not the main point, brother." Wang Ming tsked as he directly pointed at the driver's seat. "The main point is that when this guy puts her hair up, how does she look like a woman at all?"</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin clenched her teeth and gripped the steering wheel tightly.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi shook his head. "Lao Gudong, what you said isn't right. Actually, we can still tell after looking at a person carefully. After all, men and women have different distinctive traits. Those who do research should value scientific knowledge, right?"</p>

    <p>For a while, Wang Ming was unable to refute this.</p>

    <p>A short moment later, he waved his hands, a tragic expression on his face. "How I wish my female guard slash driver was a true, cute little sister!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi shook his head yet again after hearing this. "Lao Gudong, what you said is actually also ambiguous."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "???"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "There are times when it's good to be clear about a person's gender, but we also shouldn't discriminate just because some people have neutral genders. There are a lot of cute little sisters online nowadays who look meng ... but have bigger dicks than yours <sup>1</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(i.e. crossdressers..)</dfn>

    <p>Zhai Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "..."</p>
