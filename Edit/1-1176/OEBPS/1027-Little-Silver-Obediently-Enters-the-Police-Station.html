  <h1>Chapter 1027 Xiao Yin Obediently Enters the Police Station</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After so long, Xiao Yin finally received a message from Master, which made him very excited. Naturally, he had to be 100% hyped up to complete the task that Master had given him.</p>

    <p>Unless a cultivator was sitting in meditation to regulate their breathing, even they would feel uncomfortable staying up for long periods of time. But Xiao Yin had the heart of a holy beast, and thus wasn't too worried that he would suddenly keel over dead. However, there were still some side-effects from staying up late, like black circles under the eyes, obesity caused by a declining metabolism, depression and so on... But these didn't mean anything to Xiao Yin; as long as he drank his own blood, he would be full of energy again.</p>

    <p>If he took the earliest spirit bus, he should be able to get to Master's house before noon! Previously, Xiao Yin had tried various ways of getting to the Wang family's small villa, but found that the spirit bus was the most convenient. If he flew on a sword or drove himself, he couldn't play with his phone on the road, and taxis were too expensive; he would rather spend that money on takeout.</p>

    <p>The spirit bus was different. This sort of mass transport was more cost-efficient. Moreover, he could play games on the way! Actually, taking the subway was also good, but the Wang family's small villa was in too remote a location, which the subway didn't go through.</p>

    <p>Most importantly, Xiao Yin really didn't want to be taken to the police station again - he had realized a very serious problem.</p>

    <p>As long as he went out alone, he would definitely be taken to the cultivation police station for a chat...</p>

    <p>For Xiao Yin, the police station's lunchboxes already weren't anything new.</p>

    <p>"Not going online today?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin got on the bus. As soon as he turned on his phone, he saw that Miss Bai Qiao had sent him a new text.</p>

    <p>*Cultivation Emulator'*s beta test had already entered the second round, and Bai Qiao wanted Xiao Yin to go over to the Internet cafe and help her test it out.</p>

    <p>The reply she got was naturally Xiao Yin turning her down. "No, Master's looking for me today."</p>

    <p>"Alright." Bai Qiao expressed her understanding. "Then I'll look for Old Guang and your boss."</p>

    <p>The "boss" she was referring to was Beast King, which was a title that everyone had settled on after discussion to conceal his identity.</p>

    <p>As long as Beast King was alive, there was still a chance for the holy beast race to reemerge.</p>

    <p>They needed an opportunity; more than that, it required Beast King pulling himself together and assuming the responsibility of lifting up the race. But getting Beast King to pick himself up might not be so easy after the holy beast race had been thoroughly "persecuted" in the game...</p>

    <p>Of course, as the boss, Beast King had already thought about abdicating and getting Xiao Yin to take over as the new "Beast King," but Xiao Yin was just an 8000-year-old baby and had a long way to go before he reached the age of inheritance.</p>

    <p>But Xiao Yin actually didn't care about this, and had no interest in the position of "Beast King."</p>

    <p>How comfortable was his life now?</p>

    <p>Learning from Master, staying at Lord Diulei's place, eating takeout, drinking fat nerd happy water<sup>1</sup>, playing games... how blissful was his life?</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The internet buzzword for "Coke.")</dfn>

    <p>Xiao Yin started up Arknights. He heard that today was Bilibili's tenth anniversary, and Arknights was giving out a headhunting permit, five recruitment tags, and twenty mid-tier EXP cards to each player.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin thought this game was still pretty thoughtful.</p>

    <p>He then started recruiting with the extra prizes.</p>

    <p>In a flash of cool, dazzling animation effects â€” white light +1, green ticket +5<sup>2</sup>!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Basically crappy stats for the game..)</dfn>

    <p>Thoughtful my foot!!</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin roared inwardly and stomped his foot angrily where he was sitting.</p>

    <p>"Mommy, mommy, that brother isn't wearing shoes!" A cute boy on the side pointed at Xiao Yin's pure white feet. His mother had in fact already noticed them, and her face revealed some embarrassment, but she still told her child not to point at other people as it was quite impolite.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin himself knew that this wasn't a good habit, but as a pure-blooded holy beast, he didn't wear shoes in his beast form! And the most important thing was that his hooves were very hard. He was barefoot in his human shape, but the soles of his feet were so thick that he didn't feel any pain when he was walking. Conversely, wearing shoes gave him a strange sense of being bound.</p>

    <p>Modern society was already very open; it was a person's free choice to not wear shoes, and no one could interfere. Besides, it wasn't as if Xiao Yin's feet smelled or something, and he felt that since it didn't affect anyone else, it was fine.</p>

    <p>Just as he was thinking this, there was suddenly a very strong stench from behind his seat...</p>

    <p>It was a white collar worker in a black suit. Out of the corner of his eye, Xiao Yin saw this white collar brother surreptitiously take off his shoe, unnoticed by anyone else, and scratch the sole of his foot, which suddenly itched for some reason or other.</p>

    <p>Then, the stench wafted out...</p>

    <p>The next second, everyone in the bus turned to look at Xiao Yin, who wasn't wearing shoes.</p>

    <p>After glaring for several dozen seconds, the spirit bus driver uncle also couldn't take it any longer. He turned to look for the culprit who was the source of the stench, and Xiao Yin was the first person to catch his eye. "Little brother, can you please put on your shoes?! Otherwise, please get off!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin felt very wronged. "It's not me..."</p>

    <p>"You're the only one without shoes on the whole bus. Who else could it be?" That shameless white collar brother sitting behind Xiao Yin echoed the bus driver's sentiments.</p>

    <p>Instantly, the whole bus flared up.</p>

    <p>"Get off!"</p>

    <p>"Hurry up and get off! It stinks!"</p>

    <p>"It really isn't me!" Xiao Yin was furious.</p>

    <p>He absolutely couldn't get off halfway. There weren't any bus stops on the way, and if he got off here, he wouldn't be able to reach the Wang family's small villa before noon.</p>

    <p>The driver uncle pinched his nose, a resentful look on his face.</p>

    <p>Confronted with this sort of unreasonable passenger, he wouldn't provoke him, for if he did and they scuffled, it was the entire bus of passengers who would suffer.</p>

    <p>When the driver saw that Xiao Yin wasn't cooperating, he didn't hesitate to press the alarm button on the driver's seat.</p>

    <p>The nearest cultivation police station instructed a patrol officer nearby to hurry over, and the latter arrived at the scene roughly two minutes later.</p>

    <p>Standing atop a flying sword, the police uncle wore a professional smile. "Sir, please follow us back to the cultivation police station. We suspect that you're carrying a biological weapon."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had asked Xiao Yin to come over to team up with Er Ha and search for the whereabouts of the black shadow army as well as help the teachers of Number 60 High find the remaining fragments of the Jade Scroll of School History. Realistically speaking, the black shadow army's appearance on the streets would naturally attract the attention of the cultivation police.</p>

    <p>The shadow army and a large number of assassins had moved in from opposite directions at the same time, but hadn't hurt anyone on the street - such an act could only be labeled an utter "conspiracy."</p>

    <p>After the incident that day, Teacher Pan, Sun Rong and Lin Xiaoyu had been taken to the cultivation police station to record their statements.</p>

    <p>After detailed questioning, the three of them returned to their respective homes.</p>

    <p>At the police station, Officer Gao studied the statements all the way until the next day. He felt that there was something fishy about the matter - maybe he should report it to his superiors.</p>

    <p>Just as he was about to make a phone call, a familiar figure flashed past his office door.</p>

    <p>"The brother at the door, wait!" Gao Mu thought he had seen someone familiar.</p>

    <p>The patrol officer in charge of escorting Xiao Yin walked into the office and said, "It's like this, we found him on the spirit bus earlier..."</p>

    <p>"Screw found! Hurry up and let him go!" This was already Gao Tian's nth time seeing Xiao Yin inside the police station.</p>

    <p>And the outcome each time was a "misunderstanding"!</p>

    <p>Of course, that wasn't the most important thing - the most important thing was that the police station would become short of a huge amount of lunchboxes!!</p>

    <p>"Huh?" The patrol officer was obviously clueless.</p>

    <p>When Xiao Yin saw Officer Gao inside the office, he was very happy. "Ahahaha! So it's Officer Gao! Why are you in this branch? Weren't you at Anning District Cultivation Police Station?"</p>

    <p>"I, I was promoted..."</p>

    <p>"Congratulations! Since you've been promoted, does that mean the canteen in this police station is bigger?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Are there any new lunchboxes? Give me twenty, thanks."</p>

    <p>"You damn... aren't you pushing it?" Officer Gao's lips twitched.</p>

    <p>"Not really - you don't investigate the facts properly and you bring me in because of a misunderstanding every time. I'm not asking for compensation for psychological damage, I just want something to eat. Is that too much to ask?"</p>

    <p>Officer Gao: "..."</p>
