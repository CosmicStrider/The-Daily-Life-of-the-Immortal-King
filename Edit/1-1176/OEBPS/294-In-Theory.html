  <h1>Chapter 294 In Theory </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It went without saying how powerful an intrinsic spirit field was; just being in one made people feel uncomfortable all over. Of course, there were two individuals who were exceptions — the female elder in purple and the slit-eyed female cultivator, Ya Xuan.</p>

    <p>They were covered in a magic spell layer, which was like a secret key to protecting them from the oppression of the spirit field and from their spirit energy being cut off, hence preserving a supply flow of spirit energy from the outside world.</p>

    <p>"So, Senior Immortal, do you know what kind of divinity this holy beast has?" While Wang Ling confronted this silver warhorse, Dharmaraja and Luo Chuang quickly seized the opportunity to head over.</p>

    <p>"Mm... I can't tell for now." Lord Diulei couldn't help shuddering; these two in women's clothes were really too terrifying.</p>

    <p>"Holy beasts have their own names. If we can find out its name, we may be able to consult ancient texts for its weakness." Luo Chuang stared at this silver warhorse with a deep frown. He felt that it was like something he had seen before on a totem in a tomb he had once robbed. That totem had been of a silver warhorse wearing armor. It had had a horn on its head and two broad steel wings.</p>

    <p>After looking at the warhorse for a very long time, Luo Chuang shook his head. "This holy beast is a unicorn, but there's currently no way for us to find out its exact name."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "I heard that disciple next to the female Taoist in purple call it Senior Uncle Feifei."</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja's jaw dropped as he blurted out, "So its name is Ma Feifei <sup>1</sup> ?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Feifei and Wuwukai are live
stream partners. Feifei is
nicknamed Ma Feifei for the
way he sucks up to Wuwukai,
as adapted from the Chinese
phrase 'pai ma pi,' which
means 'to suck up to .. ')</dfn>

    <p>Lord Diulei and Luo Chuang: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At that moment inside the intrinsic spirit field, Wang Ling and the silver warhorse were exchanging deep looks.</p>

    <p>The warhorse had gotten quite the shock; under normal circumstances, apart from the person who discharged the intrinsic spirit and those with the spirit field's secret key, everyone else would bow under the massive pressure, and once they ran out of spirit energy, they wouldn't be able to replenish it.</p>

    <p>Therefore, for cultivators who became trapped in an intrinsic spirit field, many of them would adopt a defensive strategy and make it their number one priority to save up their spirit energy in order to destroy the field.</p>

    <p>However, to the silver warhorse's surprise, it could sense the vigorous spirit energy roiling intensely in the youngster in front of it; the field hadn't had the slightest impact on him.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had already switched the female Taoist robes for a red and black sports jacket and a pair of track pants, which was what stunned the silver warhorse the most; without any magic vestments or even treasures to defend himself, and purely relying on his corporeal body to resist the intrinsic spirit field... just how large was the source of this youngster's spirit energy?</p>

    <p>In addition, continual use of the protective golden light of a Sage Body should accelerate the consumption of spirit energy, but not only was this youngster not the least bit affected, he had even cast the golden light on the other three for protection... this person was human, right?</p>

    <p>The silver warhorse simply couldn't fathom how a cultivator who was clearly only at Perfected Being level, judging from his realm, could have such frighteningly unlimited spirit energy.</p>

    <p>"No one can act recklessly against me in my spirit field."</p>

    <p>Narrowing its eyes, the silver warhorse abruptly spread its steel wings. They were fully twenty zhang in length, and pointing up to the sky, they looked like two steel blades.</p>

    <p>It stomped the earth with four brawny legs, its iron hoofs ringing and shaking the ground.</p>

    <p>Sprinting forward several dozen meters, it took off into the sky, the steel wings on its back slicing through the air before pointing forward like crossed prongs as the warhorse hurtled toward Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling extended his right hand, and spirit energy instantly swirled in his palm. Then, he sent it forward with a light push.</p>

    <p>This countermove was merely to test the strength of this wing attack.</p>

    <p>This dense concentration of spirit energy, which discharged intense fluctuations like a huge spirit turbine, was easily dispelled by the silver warhorse halfway.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling narrowed his eyes at this scene.</p>

    <p>This result wasn't a surprise; this wing attack could ignore the golden light's defense to a certain extent, and cause forceful damage.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei and the others also twitched their lips at this scene.</p>

    <p>During such a tense confrontation, Wang Ling actually had the time to send out a feeler to test the strength of the other party's offense...</p>

    <p>"Too extraordinary..." Amazement welled up from the bottle of Luo Chuang's heart.</p>

    <p>"From another point of view, Brother Ling is very confident in his ability to discharge his magic instantly." Lord Diulei also sighed. If a person was able to refine their ability to instantly release magic at full power — indeed, to do it the same way that Wang Ling could — they wouldn't have to worry about making the first move, because even if they were late to attack, they could instantly cast multiple spells, both for offense and defense.</p>

    <p>In the air, the silver horse's gaze was complicated.</p>

    <p>This scene had stupefied it as well.</p>

    <p>And before its surprise faded, something even more stunning happened. As an immense amount of spirit energy encircled Wang Ling's palm, he transformed his hand into a spirit blade that directly grew to the length of several dozen meters. It also cut though the air like a prong, and pushed back against the wing attack.</p>

    <p>The response to a destructive attack was obvious.</p>

    <p>It would be fine as long as the attack couldn't get close.</p>

    <p>In that split second, the silver horse's forehead was covered in sweat. Even at this distance, it could feel the piercing pain from the wind pressure, and in the face of this absolute strength, it realized that everything else was superfluous.</p>

    <p>The two prongs collided in mid-air and were directly destroyed at the same time.</p>

    <p>It wasn't until now that the silver warhorse realized how serious the situation was. As a holy beast, its ability to sniff out danger was far superior to a normal cultivator's. It was unable to correctly gauge the strength of the youngster in front of it, but it instantly made a decision.</p>

    <p>Steel wings facing forward, it hurtled toward Wang Ling in a wild, reckless move, like a massive dying meteor, with the intent of taking Wang Ling down with it.</p>

    <p>The silver horse was risking its life on this one strike, so it had to hit its target; it would be like sacrificing eight hundred man to slay a thousand.</p>

    <p>But the silver horse didn't care one bit, and launched itself fiercely from the air. Taking into account both the timing and position, conditions were just right and within its control.</p>

    <p>Actually, it had an excellent strategy, which was enhanced by the intrinsic spirit field and core array pattern — there was no way it could die.</p>

    <p>The reason why holy beasts were called as such wasn't just because of their remarkable life force, but more because of their hearts. As long as the heart was preserved, a holy beast had the tremendous ability to regenerate itself.</p>

    <p>In theory, Wang Ling would definitely be the one who would be injured in the end, and perhaps even perish. Even if the warhorse sustained severe injuries, it had the core array pattern and the beast heart to protect it, so at least it wouldn't die.</p>

    <p>Mm... in theory...</p>
