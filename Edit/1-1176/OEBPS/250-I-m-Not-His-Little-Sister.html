  <h1>Chapter 250 I'm Not His Little Sister... </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was obvious that Sheep had stabbed at this gold-chained delinquent's sore spot.</p>

    <p>He fell to his knees and swore at the heavens...</p>

    <p>I once had a lolita, but I didn't cherish her <sup>1</sup> . When I lost her, it was too late for regrets. There is no worst pain in the world than this. If God could give me another chance, he would say: Never... ever... play around with a lolita!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>('I once had a xx, but I didn't
cherish xx' is a colloquial
online phrase used to express
extreme remorse.)</dfn>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The reason why Sheep had chosen to meet Wang Ling in the alley was because Wang Ling liked to keep a low profile.</p>

    <p>However, when he brought her out, they still attracted a lot of attention. Her pink hair buns and her little gray jacket contrasted sharply and were really too eye-catching.</p>

    <p>She followed behind Wang Ling obediently at a distance of around one zhang <sup>2</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(A reminder that this is around 3.3 meters.)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling could feel the gazes fixed on him as he took Sheep out like this, so he couldn't teleport without someone noticing.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, he was still wearing his school uniform. If someone noticed him teleporting, he would hit the headlines tomorrow: "Some high school student from Number 60 High School is actually capable of teleportation? Is this warped humanity or moral decay..."</p>

    <p>In the end, he decided to take the subway to bring Sheep to Boss Luo's shop.</p>

    <p>They crossed a long pedestrian bridge. On the other side was the station closest to Number 60 High School, Qingyun Road Subway Line One. Wang Ling estimated that there were eight stops from here to Wuliang Road.</p>

    <p>Since the founding of Huaxiu nation, the criss-crossed subway lines had formed a dense and complicated web which penetrated the entire underground space. Although a lot of cultivators still chose to fly on their swords to get to their destinations, they needed to pay tolls, and now and then they would be stopped for ID checks.</p>

    <p>In contrast, the only checks at the subway were the security ones at the station entrances. Although the subway was slower than a flying sword, it was less troublesome as there were fewer processes to go through.</p>

    <p>The subway cars nowadays had all been expanded with the Space Expansion Skill, so everyone had a place to sit and it never became crowded.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling entered the subway station and saw a lot of different types of people, from ordinary office workers carrying briefcases to cultivators in strange attire who were giving off spirit energy.</p>

    <p>Using your spiritual senses was always the most direct and reliable way to determine if a person was a cultivator, otherwise you would never know if the man dressed in traditional costume in front of you was a cultivator or a cosplayer.</p>

    <p>An ordinary person wouldn't be able to see with the naked eye any magic treasures a cultivator might be carrying on them, but just because they weren't visible didn't mean there wasn't any danger. Therefore, any spirit swords and magic treasures which cultivators might have on them when they entered the subway station had to be put away in a storage bag, and cultivators were forbidden from taking them out and using them the entire time they were on the subway.</p>

    <p>The subway also had a spatial magic treasure which tracked surveillance signals. Once it detected a fluctuation, a group of subway attendants would appear before you like the Red Guards <sup>3</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(The Red Guards was the
student paramilitary social
movement during the Cultural
Revolution ..)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling took Sheep through security smoothly. When he turned his head, he was surprised to notice an acquaintance — Immortal Toya's disciple Li Miaozhen, or Director Li, whom Wang Ling had met at Second Hospital back then.</p>

    <p>Director Li had been stopped by two subway security guards and he looked a little embarrassed.</p>

    <p>Looking at him from a distance, Wang Ling was surprised to realize that Director Li's destination was actually Boss Luo's place. He was going to pick up an immortal sword today which he had left with Boss Luo for maintenance. His initial plan had been to take the subway to go and get the sword, then fly on it to send a patient's urine sample to a branch hospital. In the end, he hadn't expected to be stopped for a security check.</p>

    <p>A security officer pointed at the glass bottle that Director Li was carrying. "Sir, what is this yellow substance?"</p>

    <p>As a hospital director, Director Li was obligated to protect the patient's privacy, so he declined to answer with dignity. "I'm very sorry, I can't tell you..."</p>

    <p>"Is it toxic or harmful?" The security officers scowled and stared at Director Li with wary expressions.</p>

    <p>Director Li: "Of course not..."</p>

    <p>Security officer: "If not, then please drink a mouthful."</p>

    <p>Director Li: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the end, Wang Ling chose to not muddy the waters. Songhai city's subway security had always been very strict; now that Director Li had been detained, it would probably be a while before they let him go.</p>

    <p>Worst of all, Director Li had come out this time in plain clothes; he wasn't wearing his white coat and didn't even have his work ID. Coupled with the bottle of yellow unknown liquid that he was carrying, it would be strange if he didn't look suspicious.</p>

    <p>The end of school coincided with the evening rush hour, and the station today was still as crowded as ever. Even though there was no need to worry that there wouldn't be any empty seats on the subway, the station platform was still a little crowded.</p>

    <p>Sheep had obediently followed behind Wang Ling, but their extremely crowded surroundings made her a little uncomfortable, so she moved forward and grasped one of Wang Ling's fingers with her small hand.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was taken aback, but when he saw the dense flow of passengers around them, he let Sheep hold on to him.</p>

    <p>Sheep blinked as she looked around curiously.</p>

    <p>Drawing her in by the hand, Wang Ling stood on the platform and waited for the subway train. He could feel a lot of eyes around them fixed in their direction; it was very clear that they weren't looking at him, but at Sheep!</p>

    <p>A cute girl who looked like a porcelain doll — whoever saw her couldn't help taking a second look.</p>

    <p>Behind Wang Ling stood an old auntie who stared at Sheep for a very long time, and in the end couldn't help saying to Wang Ling, "Young man, are you taking your sister out to play?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was silent for a bit before he nodded.</p>

    <p>The auntie bent down to stare at Sheep. The more she looked, the more she liked her. She itched to squeeze Sheep's face, but was a little embarrassed to do so. "Dear me, your little sister is so cute! Is she your real sister?"</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling could only continue nodding.</p>

    <p>He didn't really want to talk with the auntie in front of him, but unfortunately, she had completely lost her mind the moment she had seen Sheep.</p>

    <p>Children always held a special place in the hearts of old people.</p>

    <p>"Your little sister is so cute and you are so handsome; your mother must be a great beauty!" As she chattered on, the auntie took advantage of the opportunity to rub Sheep's head; unexpectedly, Sheep didn't resist.</p>

    <p>In fact, she was thinking.</p>

    <p>She felt that since she had been personally enlightened by Little Master Ling, their connection was deeper than just brother and sister!</p>

    <p>Hence, all of a sudden, she looked up at the auntie in front of her with a solemn face. "Auntie, in fact... I'm not his little sister!"</p>

    <p>Both Wang Ling and the auntie looked at Sheep in suspense.</p>

    <p>Sheep pointed at Wang Ling. "He's my dad!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>The auntie: "..."</p>

    <p>Amidst the whistle and rumble of the oncoming train, the two of them were instantly overwhelmed.</p>
