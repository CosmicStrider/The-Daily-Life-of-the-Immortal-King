  <h1>Chapter 702 You Can Do Whatever You Want If You Have a Bit of Strength?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Things were progressing according to the head of state's plan. This was General Yi's most powerful sword, and unless he used his strongest sword attack, it would be impossible for him to break open this infinite intrinsic spirit field.</p>

    <p>From the very beginning, this had been the head of state's goal.</p>

    <p>This was a truly mind-blowing scene. In today's peaceful era, when could you casually see a great battle of True Immortals like this? When General Yi swung his sword, it looked just like major special effects, which made Father Wang's heart ripple when he saw it.</p>

    <p>This immense mass of qi turned into a solid force that coalesced along the blade. Sword qi whistled past in the blink of an eye, and the golden-red sword light flared up, directly tearing open the second space layer. The volcanoes in the scene almost instantly crumbled into rock, disintegrating again into finer particles and then into dust which was then sucked into the space fissure...</p>

    <p>With a single slash, General Yi demonstrated the height of his prowess. A golden-red sword light ten thousand fathoms wide slashed down the front with unmatched, powerful godly might. The intrinsic spirit field was cut open like a thousand-layered cake, and the space wall of each layer could be clearly seen.</p>

    <p>The entire process lasted a full minute until finally, Father Wang saw that the boundless sword qi above General Yi's sword hilt had already vanished. His Boundless mode had also disappeared, and General Yi reappeared at the villa entrance with his head drenched in sweat and gasping harshly for breath.</p>

    <p>That sword swing just now had taken a lot out of General Yi. This was his sure-fire killing move, and he could only use it once in the short term.</p>

    <p>Even so, it was already stunning enough.</p>

    <p>Father Wang felt that thanks to the head of state today, he had truly collected a lot of good battle reference material. If he could adapt that scene just now for his novel, it would be an amazing battle scenario!</p>

    <p>But that being said, Father Wang was actually still a little curious...</p>

    <p>In terms of visual effects, General Yi's sword swing just now as a sure-fire killing move was truly perfect.</p>

    <p>But in terms of power, Father Wang wondered which was stronger, this sword swing or a slap from Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After this sword swing, General Yi seemed so exhausted that he collapsed. He didn't move as he gasped for air for some time before he felt better. What was more awkward was that when he had come out this time, he hadn't brought any spirit energy-replenishing pills with him.</p>

    <p>A True Immortal's ability to recover was very strong. As long as he was breathing at a normal rate, he could replenish the spirit energy that was lost from casting spells. However, if his "Magic Points" had reached rock bottom, it would take him slightly longer to recover.</p>

    <p>And the point was that in this current era of peace, where there was no war, General Yi never dreamed that there would be a day he would still use this killing move...</p>

    <p>Looking at the villa in front of him, General Yi couldn't help falling into deep thought. So far, he hadn't fully figured out which godly saint this mysterious expert inside was.</p>

    <p>But judging from this mysterious expert's technique, General Yi felt that he had no choice but to take this matter seriously. As long as they were within Huaxiu's borders, cultivators above the Golden Core stage had to report themselves to a local Huaxiu Alliance branch, which ultimately sent a summary of the statistical data to the headquarters annually.</p>

    <p>As for cultivators above the Soul Formation stage, Huaxiu Alliance wanted to know their precise identities even more. Otherwise, they would be unregistered citizens who would encounter restrictions wherever they went.</p>

    <p>Given the strength of the mysterious expert inside, General Yi felt that this person was most likely an "unregistered citizen."</p>

    <p>It was likely that the matter would still have to be reported to the head of state in the end for him to handle.</p>

    <p>With that in mind, General Yi already had a faint plan in his heart.</p>

    <p>At that moment, a voice reached his ears. It was the mysterious expert's voice. "As expected of the Blademaster. That boundless sword qi just now truly opened my eyes..."</p>

    <p>General Yi frowned tightly. "You already knew who I was, and still dared to be so heavy-handed? Do you really think you can do whatever you want just because you have a bit of strength?"</p>

    <p>"My apologies."</p>

    <p>The mysterious expert smiled. "It really is because I have strength that I can do whatever I want."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>General Yi's lips twitched. "Don't push me too far..."</p>

    <p>This tone, was too arrogant!</p>

    <p>He, the grand Blademaster, one of Huaxiu's Ten Generals and a founding father, had actually been brought low in front of some unknown person - this was exceptionally difficult for General Yi to bear.</p>

    <p>In the study, when Father Wang saw General Yi's expression change, he hastily said, "Your Excellency, how about we invite General Yi in?" To be honest, Father Wang really found General Yi a little pitiful...</p>

    <p>But the head of state chuckled playfully. "Brother Situ, see how interesting Little Yiyi is? I haven't played enough..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "..."</p>

    <p>"I've always wanted to know the truth about the inheritance of Boundless Sword Dao. Brother Situ, aren't you curious about this?" The head of state said, "I understand that this involves the secret of Boundless Sword Dao, and the reason Little Yiyi isn't willing to tell me about it is also because he's following his <em>shifu's </em> command. But the truth is that I've always been puzzled about Fan Rui's last words."</p>

    <p>"Does Your Excellency think that Sword Immortal still had hidden secrets?"</p>

    <p>"That's right." The head of state nodded. "Even though he chose to die to enlighten his stubborn disciple, I've always felt that there was still an ulterior motive..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>And so, a few minutes later, the head of state negotiated with General Yi, who was standing outside the villa.</p>

    <p>"Would you be willing to trade a secret in exchange for knowing my identity?"</p>

    <p>As soon as the head of state said this, Father Wang instantly knew that he was starting to play tricks again...</p>

    <p>"Hehe." General Yi said, "If I want to investigate you..."</p>

    <p>The head of state wasn't afraid at all, and chuckled. "If you can find out who I am, would you still need to go to all this trouble? I can promise you that as long as I want to, you'll never learn my identity..."</p>

    <p>General Yi was cut to the quick, because it was true. Until now, he had only heard the voice of the mysterious person inside this villa and hadn't seen his face; even in battle, the other party had had the upper hand.</p>

    <p>He was at a complete disadvantage in this situation...</p>

    <p>And if they clashed again later, he would probably be thrashed given his current lack of spirit energy.</p>

    <p>Thinking this, General Yi sighed and said, "How can I be sure that you're not lying?"</p>

    <p>General Yi thought the most important thing right now was still to find out more about this "mysterious expert."</p>

    <p>"I swear on Heavenly Dao that everything I've said is true. If even just a little bit of it is a lie, I'll be unlucky forever!"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, General Yi was dazed. "..."</p>

    <p>It turned out that this was a tough guy!</p>

    <p>General Yi: "What secret of mine do you want to know?"</p>

    <p>The head of state said, "I want to know why Sword Immortal passed the Boundless Sword Dao on to you back then?"</p>

    <p>"That's it?"</p>

    <p>"That's it!"</p>

    <p>"Hehe, I was wondering what it was..."</p>

    <p>The head of state cocked an eyebrow. "So, you're willing to tell me?"</p>

    <p>"It's just a small thing."</p>

    <p>General Yi waved his hand. "Back then I was too thin-skinned to say it, so I told the outside world that it was a secret... But now I've already stopped being afraid! It won't hurt for you to know, I'll tell you!"</p>

    <p>General Yi said, "A crucial factor is that the successor of Boundless Sword Dao has to be pure."</p>

    <p>The head of state: "So?"</p>

    <p>General Yi: "So, this old man is a virgin!!! Understand?"</p>

    <p>The head of state: "..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "..."</p>
