  <h1>Chapter 160 Er Ha Is One Hundred and Eighty Centimeters Tall Today </h1>

  <div>



    <p>The area around East Huang Road was low-cost, undeveloped land. Except for transport trucks carrying goods to the city, very few vehicles passed through here, and this place could really be described as "wild mountain countryside." So when the two men in suits saw a villa here, they weren't just a little astonished, they also thought it was a bit strange.</p>

    <p>After the housing bubble burst, house prices were no longer so outrageous; even small white-collar workers could buy a house several hundred ping <sup>1</sup> in size on their salaries. If the space wasn't enough, they could also get the construction workers to expand it using the Space Expansion Skill.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(As a traditional measurement
of area, one ping is roughly 36
square feet.)</dfn>

    <p>After all, technology was pretty advanced.</p>

    <p>So, what kind of family was this?</p>

    <p>The two men wearing suits felt strange in their hearts, but the Lady of the Castle had already given the order, so they could only obey it.</p>

    <p>Both men stuck on invisibility talismans, and there was a bright-colored light before their bodies turned completely transparent. This kind of invisibility talisman enabled a person to become invisible and hide their aura, and its use was actually prohibited; generally, only certain Huaxiu government branches were allowed restricted use of it.</p>

    <p>The talismans which the two men in suits were wearing had been privately created by Mo Immortal Castle. This was actually already breaking the law, and if they were caught, they would be arrested and detained straightaway.</p>

    <p>As they crept closer to the villa's entrance, they relaxed subtly.</p>

    <p>Because after some probing with their spiritual senses, they couldn't detect any spirit energy in the villa.</p>

    <p>"Is this an ordinary family?"</p>

    <p>Both of them were a little confused.</p>

    <p>However, since it was an ordinary family, then things were much easier.</p>

    <p>"The window on the second floor is open. Let's check that out first." After discussing it together, the two men leapt lightly up to the window.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's bedroom was quite big. As they entered one after another, they began to look around.</p>

    <p>In deep thought, they walked to the door.</p>

    <p>And then... a furry green tail, one that was way too thick and solid, suddenly dangled down from the ceiling.</p>

    <p>The two men were immediately startled, and they hurriedly jumped back before looking up.</p>

    <p>This time, they saw a large green akita hanging upside down from the ceiling and staring at them with hostile eyes!</p>

    <p>This was the dog that had been at the villa's entrance!</p>

    <p>The two men recognized it at a glance; they had thought that there was something off with the dog, and it turned out that they weren't wrong!</p>

    <p>Also... wasn't this dog too big?! With one look, anyone could tell that this dog wasn't natural!</p>

    <p>Actually, what surprised the two men the most was this dog's insight... they were still wearing the invisibility talismans, but the dog had sensed them, which proved that its true strength was no less powerful, and might even far surpass theirs.</p>

    <p>"What do we do? This dog seems strong... should we withdraw?"</p>

    <p>"We're here already! It would be a shame to leave now! We're both late Golden Core stage cultivators, why should we be afraid of a dog?"</p>

    <p>Late Golden Core stage?</p>

    <p>Er Ha jumped down from the ceiling and sneered. Even when it had been so weak back then in Number 60 High School, it had still never been afraid of Golden Core cultivators, much less now.</p>

    <p>Now that their identities had been exposed, the Mo Immortal Castle cultivators felt that there was no need to hide anymore.</p>

    <p>Spirit light flaring in their hands, they summoned immortal swords, and one man lifted his to point it at Er Ha. "We just wanted to investigate something and we mean you no harm, but if you insist on obstructing us, don't blame us if we stop acting polite!"</p>

    <p>The two men worked their spirit energy swiftly as they kept pace with each other; even their sword movements were in sync.</p>

    <p>It was very obvious that the people who worked at Mo Immortal Castle underwent standard swords training. The advantage of this was that a lot of people could be trained to become proficient in swordsmanship in a short period of time, but the downside was that their movements were too repetitive, and anyone who had studied swordsmanship even a little would be able to predict their moves after a few rounds.</p>

    <p>That was why when people from Mo Immortal Castle attacked on a mission, it was with the intent to kill. They were bent on settling the fight in the shortest time possible, since a prolonged fight could result in them making mistakes.</p>

    <p>To Er Ha, however, it felt like these two people were moving so slowly that it could fall asleep waiting for them.</p>

    <p>It thought back to its time in the demon world, when it would enjoy pleasant chats with the Sword Demon King Hua Laishi <sup>2</sup> — these two brats probably hadn't even been born then.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Hua Laishi is the Chinese
transliteration of the name
Wallace, and refers to the late
13th-century Scottish warrior
William Wallace who led the
Scots in the first war for
Scottish independence against
King Edward I of England ..)</dfn>

    <p>Two bright flaming swords interrupted its thoughts.</p>

    <p>Its eyes met the points of two swords, and before they got any closer, these two swords jerked to a stop like a car braking, and were unable to advance forward any further.</p>

    <p>"Aura-Freezing Spell!"</p>

    <p>The two cultivators were stunned!</p>

    <p>In a conflict which involved completely unequal realms, the demon race had a well-known way of fighting which relied on just aura — the Aura-Freezing Spell! This involved releasing special qi to counteract the spirit waves generated by magic weapons or the edge of a sword. This was a fairly advanced spell! The reason why the demon kings that had descended from the Gate Between Worlds back then had been a real headache for the humans was because of this "Aura-Freezing Spell"!</p>

    <p>For a demon king of the demon race, the Aura-Freezing Spell acted more like a shielding spell which prevented them from being harmed by the cultivators' magic weapons.</p>

    <p>Six years ago, Er Ha had thought itself absolutely pathetic because its Aura-Freezing Spell hadn't been of any fucking use against Wang Ling! At that time, Little Master Ling had pierced it with just one single punch.</p>

    <p>Now that part of its strength had returned, it could finally cast this spell again.</p>

    <p>It couldn't help but sigh; if it thought about it carefully, it felt like it had waited a lifetime for this moment.</p>

    <p>The expressions of the Mo Immortal Castle cultivators finally changed. They were completely terrified as they realized that there was no way they could fight this dog! It actually knew a demon race spell... what the hell kind of dog was this?!</p>

    <p>"Retreat!"</p>

    <p>They both turned to leave, but then found that their bodies weren't listening to them, and that they couldn't move at all!</p>

    <p>Following the length of their swords, the Aura-Freezing Spell had actually ensnared their bodies... they were completely frozen!</p>

    <p>"You shouldn't have come here." Er Ha spoke in human language as its gaze swept lazily over the two people. It withdrew its spirit energy and its body shrunk back down, the bright blue light in its eyes fading. It didn't know if it was because it had been around Little Master Ling for too long, but it wasn't as intent on killing as before, where previously, when it had still been in Number 60 High School, it had devoured the soul of a Shadow Stream killer.</p>

    <p>But now, faced with the delicious souls of these two late Golden Core stage cultivators, it wasn't the slightest bit interested...</p>

    <p>"What should we do with them?"</p>

    <p>At this moment, there was a voice behind the men in suits.</p>

    <p>These two Mo Immortal Castle cultivators turned pale with fright; they hadn't expected there to be someone else in the room!</p>

    <p>Then, two massive shadows loomed over them — these were precisely those two brawny brothers, the monster pen and goblin eraser.</p>

    <p>Er Ha lay prone on the floor and wagged its tail as it gave the two brothers a lazy look. Then, it glared at the two Mo Immortal Castle cultivators, and raised one paw to draw a claw across its throat...</p>
