  <h1>Chapter 692 One Thousand And Five Hundred Heavenly Dao</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The instant the talisman seal was removed, a stifling aura surged forth. In that moment, the youngster's aura and temperament completely changed. It was a profound feeling that was hard to describe. The two of them were just dots in this space created by the magic treasure, but the youngster left an impression that was hard to forget.</p>

    <p>The short sleeves of his school shirt flapped freely in the wind, and the golden three-petaled flowers of the King's Eye appeared again. It was immeasurably profound, as if it could pierce through all of heaven with one glance, and it hit President Bai hard in the chest as he drowned in its pressure.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had yet to attack, and hadn't even moved. However, President Bai had already been sent flying by this pressure as he sprayed blood.</p>

    <p>The talisman seal had been suppressing Wang Ling's original strength all this time.</p>

    <p>As someone who had an innate and consummate grasp of the Three Thousand Great Dao, the number of Heavenly Dao which Wang Ling could control in reality with the talisman seal stuck on him was limited to one hundred. Despite that, he was already powerful enough. Now, even though only half the talisman seal had come off, the huge difference between one hundred Heavenly Dao and one thousand and five hundred of them was a bitter pill for President Bai to swallow.</p>

    <p>All this time, he had been judging this youngster by his realm, but he was now excruciatingly aware that the other party's strength couldn't be measured in terms of realm at all!</p>

    <p>The rumor was that it had been world-defying enough when Evil Sword God had comprehended one Heavenly Dao. But in a suppressed state, Wang Ling already had one hundred Heavenly Dao... Now that half the talisman seal was off, the full weight of one thousand and five hundred Heavenly Dao was powerful enough to do more than just shake the heavens!</p>

    <p>It could turn all of the heavens upside down!</p>

    <p>This youngster was far from someone President Bai could shake.</p>

    <p>He grit his teeth and his first reaction was to retreat; forcing himself to fight this round would truly be looking for death.</p>

    <p>"Wuji Umbrella!"</p>

    <p>He shouted the umbrella's name.</p>

    <p>Behind him, that small black umbrella in mid-air instantly started to spin and give off black light when it heard its master's call.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling had already read President Bai's intention.</p>

    <p>President Bai was scared and wanted to use the Wuji Umbrella's power to break open the space and escape.</p>

    <p>But would it be that easy?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling turned his gaze to this small black umbrella, and several dozen imperceptible Heavenly Dao rolled forth from the King's Eye to generate a massive restrictive force. President Bai watched blankly as halfway through spinning, the Wuji Umbrella stopped moving.</p>

    <p>"Wuji Umbrella!"</p>

    <p>President Bai called again.</p>

    <p>But it didn't give any response.</p>

    <p>"Wuji Umbrella!" he shouted a third time.</p>

    <p>In the end, the Wuji Umbrella's weapon spirit replied in an extremely annoyed voice, "So noisy, shut the hell up! Don't you see this father can't move!"</p>

    <p>President Bai: "..."</p>

    <p>To be honest, the Wuji Umbrella's weapon spirit hardly ever responded, and it actually had such a nasty attitude!</p>

    <p>"Do you have a way to get me out of here?!" President Bai asked the Wuji Umbrella for help.</p>

    <p>The Wuji Umbrella was silent, then it directly begged Wang Ling for mercy. "Big boss, please let me go! It's just that I formed a contract with him! I can cancel it, no problem! Big boss, just don't kill me! This guy has committed too many sins, I can act as human witness... Bah! As weapon spirit witness!"</p>

    <p>As a weapon spirit, the Wuji Umbrella was clearly intimidated by the restrictive force of these dozens of Heavenly Dao: it felt like the extremely sharp tips of a dozen or so precious swords were pointed at its neck.</p>

    <p>After thorough consideration, the Wuji Umbrella weapon spirit felt that begging for mercy now was the most suitable option.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>After it begged for mercy, the Wuji Umbrella even well-meaningly urged President Bai, "Stop spouting nonsense, hurry up and kneel and admit you're wrong, and it'll be over!"</p>

    <p>"???"</p>

    <p>President Bai had never ever expected the Wuji Umbrella to actually choose to directly betray him.</p>

    <p>Honestly speaking, even if the Wuji Umbrella hadn't opened its mouth, Wang Ling had already planned to take it back.</p>

    <p>He stretched out his hand and the Wuji Umbrella directly fell into it. As Wang Ling stroked its body lightly, he pulled out a string of golden talisman characters.</p>

    <p>President Bai was thunderstruck; this string of characters was none other than the weapon spirit contract which he had formed with the Wuji Umbrella. This youngster had now actually directly pulled the contract out...</p>

    <p>After dragging the entire contract out, Wang Ling didn't even bother to have a look at it, and with a light squeeze of his hand, the entire contract exploded in his palm and was reduced to flying ash.</p>

    <p>So since the beginning, there was no need for the Wuji Umbrella to break the contract, since Wang Ling could directly modify it.</p>

    <p>The Wuji Umbrella now didn't have a master!</p>

    <p>"I'll stake my life on yours!" President Bai gnashed his teeth in fury.</p>

    <p>He never expected the youngster to humiliate him in this way â€” snatching his magic treasure away right in his face was no different than stealing his wife, and was a massive humiliation.</p>

    <p>"Summoning! Nine Rashomon!"</p>

    <p>President Bai yelled as he swiftly made a hand seal and slammed his palm down on the ground.</p>

    <p>Nine massive, ancient stone gates were instantly summoned.</p>

    <p>These nine stone gates were built in a foreign and simple style that were similar to the gateways of ancient shrines. The door frames were decorated with rich and complicated carvings of all kinds of rare and unusual beasts. The image of a head of an evil spirit in the center of each gate suddenly seemed to open their mouths with loud wails, and a desolate aura assaulted the senses from far away before transforming into a massive protective barrier that blocked the way forward.</p>

    <p>With the Wuji Umbrella gone, this was the last magic treasure in President Bai's collection. These nine Rashomon created a huge sense of oppression and had an intense suppressive force. Since the youngster's aura was too terrifying, President Bai's first thought was to suppress him. If he could do this, he might still have a fighting chance!</p>

    <p>But reality proved that he had indeed been thinking too much.</p>

    <p>Now that Wang Ling had taken off half of the talisman seal, no matter how many tricks President Bai tried, they were nothing in the face of the power of a full one thousand and five hundred Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>Gazing at these nine, ancient giant gates, Wang Ling sighed.</p>

    <p>This sigh unexpectedly created a sonic wave... This was the King's Sigh...</p>

    <p>In a flash, these nine giant gates, which were a first-rate, first-class holy weapon, were straightaway reduced to fine dust with that sigh.</p>

    <p>When the wind blew, they became fine powder that drifted away into the universe...</p>

    <p>Overblown attacks were of no use. In the face of one thousand and five hundred Heavenly Dao, a first-class holy weapon couldn't withstand this pressure and it was annihilated on the spot; even the Nine Rashomon's weapon spirit was thoroughly exterminated!</p>

    <p>What kind of method was this...</p>

    <p>Trembling, President Bai fell to his knees on the ground with a dull expression.</p>

    <p>Even the Wuji Umbrella in Wang Ling's hand got the jitters. Looking at the youngster in front of it, it couldn't help letting out an awestruck sound.</p>
