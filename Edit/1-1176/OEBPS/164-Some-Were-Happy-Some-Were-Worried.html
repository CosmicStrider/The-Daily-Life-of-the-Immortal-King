  <h1>Chapter 164 Some Were Happy, Some Were Worried </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Based on the information which Song Qingshu had provided, Little Black had spent two days and two nights to obtain this lead. They had thought that this was a breakthrough in the matter, but they hadn't taken this step all the way through before this lead had derailed yet again... even Wang Ling vaguely felt that this was a pain in the ass.</p>

    <p>The biggest problem now was where to start looking for Nüwa, this little mud-playing girl.</p>

    <p>Of course, if he didn't have the talisman seal on, Wang Ling could use his aura to track down and lock onto their target. But that would led to a shutdown of electrical grids worldwide, which wasn't a result that Wang Ling wanted to see happen.</p>

    <p>It was clear that the issue of the stone ghost mask was quite the sticky problem. Looking at these three vexed people, Boss Tan also became lost in deep thought. After a while, he took out an iron box from his drawer and gave it to Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>"Boss Tan, this is...?"</p>

    <p>"It's a seed of the hawthorn tree," replied Boss Tan. "This was my childhood promise with that girl: find a place, plant this seed, and the day that it blossoms and bears fruit, that girl will show up under the tree."</p>

    <p>"Will this method really work..."</p>

    <p>It had already been so many years... most people wouldn't even remember the names of their kindergarten classmates, let alone a promise made for a future so far away. Lord Diulei recalled his childhood when he had boasted every day that he would marry all the girls in his kindergarten... but now, he was still a single dog!</p>

    <p>"We have no choice, we can only try everything..." Lord Diulei opened the iron box, picked up the hawthorn seed and sighed.</p>

    <p>It was almost midnight when he returned to Wenxian Garden with this hawthorn seed. During this period, Lord Diulei and Song Qingshu had also confirmed something else; they learned from Er Ha that Mo Immortal Castle had dispatched two men here during the day to investigate. Song Qingshu knew without a doubt that they had to have been sent by the Lady of the Castle to confirm his death.</p>

    <p>It was a bit of a pity that Er Ha had flushed those two people down the toilet and they couldn't interrogate them for more details; otherwise, Song Qingshu could definitely have learned more secrets.</p>

    <p>"You have to be careful these two days. That bunch of people definitely know that you're alive," Lord Diulei told Song Qingshu as he planted the hawthorn seed in his own backyard.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, senior, Senior Wang hasn't taken the long johns back yet!" replied Song Qingshu.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei sweated a little. "...Most transformed magic treasures have an expiry date, so Brother Ling probably refreshes the transformations regularly. The way I see it, the long johns on you won't last very much longer. So just run when you have to run, clear?"</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu nodded like a chick pecking at rice. "Yes, yes, of course, senior! I haven't returned Senior Wang's house slippers yet. If I run now, I'll be faster than a reporter!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu: "By the way, will the hawthorn seed really work?"</p>

    <p>"Who knows..." Lord Diulei patted the spirit soil under his hands as he sighed slightly.</p>

    <p>According to his calculations, even with the power of spirit soil, it would still take at least five days for the seed to sprout, and at least another half a month for it to grow into a hawthorn tree. Most importantly, whether this lady called Nüwa would show up or not as promised was still unknown.</p>

    <p>Gazing at the spirit soil, both of them were lost in deep thought; this was truly a pain in the ass.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was June 3rd on the sixth Friday of school.</p>

    <p>On this morning, there were some who were happy and some who were worried. For the military training, the boys had all gotten buzz cuts. There were also some extreme examples, like Chen Chao, who had had his entire scalp directly shaved clean by the hairdresser.</p>

    <p>Holding his head in his hands, Chen Chao wanted to cry but had no tears left to shed; he had clearly told the hairdresser that he had only wanted his hair trimmed... even if it was a buzz cut, he wanted the type to make him look handsome! He hadn't expected that in a blink of an eye, the barber, scissors in hand, had made him look like bald Wu Ke <sup>1</sup></p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Wu Ke is a two-year-old with no hair who became famous after actively interacting with the host of a broadcasted fan meeting for his favorite cartoon, and was given the online nickname 'bald Wu Ke.')</dfn>

    <p>Chen Chao must have owed the hairdresser a large amount of money in his last life — he was so unlucky!</p>

    <p>When Teacher Pan walked into the classroom, the class was actually still very rowdy since everyone was discussing their haircuts. But today, instead of getting angry as usual, she quietly put her teaching materials down on the lectern and with the girls, admired the boys' buzz cuts.</p>

    <p>Boys should be fresh and cool like this, it was so much better!</p>

    <p>As a pioneer teacher at Number 60 High School, Teacher Pan had taught many batches of elite students. Among the deepest impressions that they had of her was her strict teaching style and her class rules. She was a person of rules and regulations, and her OCD left a deep impression on anyone who had known her for quite some time... now that all the boys had buzz cuts, her mood was as relaxed as if she had released everything after being constipated.</p>

    <p>On this side, Teacher Pan was rejoicing in the boys' new looks in Grade One, Class Three. On the other side, Songhai city's General Administration of 100 Schools was in a mess.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi sat behind his office table feeling resentful and bitter. Since Shadow Stream's attack on Number 60 High School, he had never stopped worrying; as soon as he had been promoted, he had reinforced security around all the high schools which fell under the purview of Songhai city's General Administration of 100 Schools in order to prevent similar violations from happening again.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi didn't want any slip-ups to occur while he was in office.</p>

    <p>The bureaucratic culture for cultivators was much more complex than anything ordinary people could imagine. Number 60 High School was his alma mater, and if he couldn't even protect his own alma mater, he would inevitably become gossip fodder and the butt of jokes for onlookers. It wasn't long until Number 60 High School's military training session, so in the last few days, Zhuo Yi had been secretly boosting security for the school.</p>

    <p>But most unfortunately for him, at this critical time, he received disastrous news.</p>

    <p>The younger sister of that Master of Shadow Stream, who had been seized in Number 59 High School back then, had broken out of prison!</p>

    <p>.....</p>

    <p>Songhai's maximum security prison was where the cultivation police sent serious felons. Plenty of "well-known" criminals had been imprisoned here, like that major criminal from Furi Cultivation University who had poisoned his roommate. He had been incarcerated here for a very long time before finally being sentenced to death.</p>

    <p>News of the escape had alarmed national leaders. Members of the central cultivation inspection team happened to be in Songhai city during this time, and Secretary Dakang rushed to the scene almost at once. Someone breaking out of the nation's maximum security prison for major criminals was, bluntly speaking, quite inconceivable.</p>

    <p>Cultivators sent to prison had special sealing magic cast on them, and their handcuffs were custom-made and could suppress their strength. Beneath the prison's ten thousand li perimeter was a massive restraining magic array; along with the high wall that ran all around it which even titans <sup>2</sup> couldn't climb over, it was complete nonsense to think that anyone could escape.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Titans is an allusion to the Japanese manga and anime series 'Attack of the Titans.')</dfn>

    <p>When Secretary Dakang reached the scene, the cultivation police had already dispatched the major crime investigation unit to check the situation.</p>

    <p>At present, the only good news they could confirm was that the criminal hadn't fled beyond the perimeter of Songhai city's maximum security prison.</p>

    <p>However, her mode of escape was a little incredible. The other party had actually dismantled the steel plate under the bed in her cell, and with just an instant noodles fork, had dug out an escape passage.</p>

    <p>From experienced Officer Wang's investigation of the scene, he discovered that this instant noodles fork had actually belonged to Kang Shifu<sup>3</sup>!</p>
