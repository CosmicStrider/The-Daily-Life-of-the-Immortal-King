  <h1>Chapter 54 A Brainless Kidnapper </h1>

  <div>

      <p>It took Jiang Liuying about half a minute to absorb what Wang Ming was saying.</p>

      <p>She then pinched his chin and carefully scrutinized him. Only after she had once again confirmed that this man hadn't altered his appearance or wasn't an illusion and was the genuine Wang Ming himself did she breathe a sigh.</p>

      <p>As Wang Ling's cousin, Wang Ming was actually similar to him in some ways. So long as Wang Ming gave up on disguising himself as a veteran cultivator, Wang Ling thought that this guy could still tentatively be considered pretty cool. However, the difference between them was that he had never been the narcissistic type, while Wang Ming could look in the mirror all day long and fangirl over himself. The scientific research institute had replaced anything that could reflect his image in order to stop him from becoming distracted while conducting his research.</p>

      <p>He was a dumbass, and this idiocy was reflected in various aspects, "narcissism" being the most obvious.</p>

      <p>"Do you know, this is the first time in my life that a girl is pinching my chin..."</p>

      <p>Wang Ming was a little unsettled at being stared at for so long by a beautiful girl pinching his chin with her delicate fingers. "But elder sister, now is not the time for flirting. I advise you to let me go in three minutes, otherwise, the whole planet is finished. At that time, forget your revenge, you might not even be able to find your own ashes."</p>

      <p>"...Who the fuck is flirting with you!" Jiang Liuying couldn't help swearing, so angry that even her big 36D boobs shook.</p>

      <p>She didn't speak for a very long time after that. She seriously suspected that she might have actually kidnapped the wrong person â€” she hadn't kidnapped the most powerful brain, but the most powerful retard...</p>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p>After pondering for a moment, Jiang Liuying suddenly thought of something.</p>

      <p>Given Wang Ming's current status, plus the pressure at work... maybe, possibly... there was something wrong with his brain!</p>

      <p>People in the field of scientific research tended to be highly unorthodox in their thinking, and were the most likely to become delusional! After muttering to herself for a bit, she crouched down halfway to say to Wang Ming, "My apologies, my tone wasn't very nice just now. I need to confirm something with you..."</p>

      <p>As a qualified kidnapper, it was absolutely vital that she pay attention to the psychological health of the hostages. It wouldn't be good otherwise if they went crazy before they could be used. Moreover, this was a hostage suffering from delusions, so there was a risk that he might kill himself.</p>

      <p>"What is it?" Wang Ming dodged around her and retreated to a small corner of the locker room.</p>

      <p>"Are you delusional? To put it simply, it means a problem with the brain."</p>

      <p>"...It's your own damn brain that has the problem!"</p>

      <p>"Stop pretending, I get it." Jiang Liuying cupped her chin and looked at Wang Ming with a calm and composed air. "I have some background in basic psychology. Given the extent of your delusions, fantasizing constantly about the destruction of the earth... this is obviously beyond recovery. You should pay attention to this! Doesn't the Cultivation Academy of Science care? You need love!"</p>

      <p>"...The earth being destroyed is true, if you don't let me go!"</p>

      <p>"See, you're having another episode..." Jiang Liuying rubbed Wang Ming's head. "Relax, our Shadow Stream assassins are very dedicated. In order to ensure our hostages' worth, we absolutely won't allow any harm to come to them physically or mentally before they can be of use to us!"</p>

      <p>Saying this, she grasped Wang Ming's hand tightly. "Believe me, I will cure you!"</p>

      <p>"..." Wang Ming already completely had no idea what to say.</p>

      <p>"How about this, to show my good faith... let me give you a love hug first!"</p>

      <p>As soon as the girl finished speaking, Wang Ming felt two arms wrap around him forcefully. And then, two incomparably massive shadows bore down on him like the weight of Mount Tai <sup>1</sup> , flattening his face...</p>

      <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Mount Tai is a culturally and historically important mountain in the Shandong province of China.)</dfn>

      <p>Wang Ming: "..." Damn it! These two things were really too big! He couldn't breathe at all!</p>

      <p>The girl held Wang Ming for two whole minutes before letting go, and was startled to find that he had passed out, two red streams of blood gushing out of his nose...</p>

      <p>At that moment, she felt that the situation was really dire, and immediately made a phone call with her wristwatch.</p>

      <p>"Sis, I've caught the person...</p>

      <p>"But this man... there seems to be something wrong with his brain!</p>

      <p>"From my initial assessment, he suffers from severe delusions. I just gave him emergency treatment, but I didn't expect him to actually get a nosebleed..."</p>

      <p>The voice on the other end of the phone was cold yet sweet. "...How did you treat him?"</p>

      <p>"Of course I gave him a love hug, this kind of serious mental illness needs humane care!"</p>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p>The woman on the other end of the phone sighed clearly. "I understand..."</p>

      <p>"Understand what, sis?"</p>

      <p>"It's not his brain that has the problem... it's yours..."</p>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>Wang Ling stood at the entrance to the school dormitory of Number 59 High School, his gaze deep as he stared into the distance and his eyelid twitching at a steady rate; so far it had already been more than five minutes.</p>

      <p>The disaster level had risen directly from two stars to three stars... looking at the current situation, it didn't look like this disaster warning was going to stop there.</p>

      <p>He could roughly guess what this warning was about.</p>

      <p>The old version of the Dao talisman seal was about to expire; he only had one hour at the most before the seal failed completely. But there was still no trace of Wang Ming.</p>

      <p>Wang Ling closed his eyes and released his spiritual senses to try and get ahold of Wang Ming's aura, but found nothing.</p>

      <p>He had clearly felt Wang Ming's aura some time ago, and had known the moment when he had entered Number 59 High School's front gate.</p>

      <p>Assuming that he would be arriving soon, Wang Ling had waited at the entrance to the school dormitory. But strangely, when he had tried to track Wang Ming's aura again, he found that it had disappeared! As if he had vanished off the face of the earth!</p>

      <p>Of course, if his power was completely unsealed, he would be able to instantly track down Wang Ming's aura no matter where he was. But by that time, it would be too late...</p>

      <p>This hateful fellow... had something really happened to him?</p>

      <p>Wang Ling stared into thin air and frowned with some annoyance.</p>

      <p>Clearly, some misfortune had befallen Wang Ming.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, it was very likely that his aura was being blocked by some magic weapon.</p>

      <p>Although Wang Ling didn't know where Wang Ming was exactly, he was certain that Wang Ming hadn't left and was definitely still in Number 59 High School.</p>

      <p>Since he couldn't use his spiritual senses to track Wang Ming's aura... he could now think of only one other way...</p>

      <p>Wang Ling walked into the shadow of a small tree where no one was around. A pair of cat ears popped up on his head, and then his whole body shrunk as he transformed into a black-and-white Persian cat.</p>

      <p>At this critical moment, the first thing he had thought of was the group of stray kittens in Number 59 High School's sakura forest.</p>

      <p>To find Wang Ming quickly and decisively within a short period of time, Wang Ling felt the only thing he could do now was mobilize the strength of this special horde.</p>
