  <h1>Chapter 897 Exorcism Convention</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It had to be said that Zhuo Yi had really come into his own. Wang Ling was blown away by this brilliant Raccoon Licking Dog Limitless Punch.</p>

    <p>After coming to his senses, Wang Ling was in a very good mood - it felt like the depression of idling away at home during the summer break had been swept away by this move. However, he was as expressionless as ever. It could only be said, as expected of Zhuo Yi as his disciple. This was indeed a promising talent; taking Zhuo Yi in as his disciple back then hadn't been in vain.</p>

    <p>The shopkeeper looked astonished when he realized that his punch had been blocked. He was the first to attack, but the other party's reaction was very quick. Before he could fully demonstrate his strength, the other party had already stopped him.</p>

    <p>Actually, Zhuo Yi wasn't as strong as the shopkeeper, and his strength was purely thanks to Wang Ling giving him upgraded equipment previously. Despite their ordinary appearance, the leather fingerless gloves which Zhuo Yi was wearing weren't any common thing.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had made the gloves with the leather from his family's "genuine leather sofa." He had also enchanted this leather sofa, which now had the ability to automatically regenerate its leather, so it was fine for Wang Ling to cut off some of the leather material.</p>

    <p>But it took time for the leather to regenerate, so Wang Ling could only cut out a piece from an inconspicuous spot, otherwise Father Wang would thrash him.</p>

    <p>The shopkeeper broke out in a cold sweat. He had always been the impulsive sort. His punch hadn't been successful, but he knew he was now guilty of attacking a police officer. He stared heavily at Zhuo Yi. "Go ahead, cop, how much do you want?"</p>

    <p>"Is there some misunderstanding... I'm not here for money."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi felt that the shopkeeper had definitely misunderstood him - actually calling him "cop" to his face...</p>

    <p>"I know I was wrong. I was too impulsive and attacked an officer. I'll pay however much you want - let's settle it quietly." The shopkeeper cracked his knuckles.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi sweated. "I'm not a cop... You didn't attack one..."</p>

    <p>It looked like the man recognized him, but he seemed a little biased.</p>

    <p>"You're not a cop?" The shopkeeper was unconvinced and looked Zhuo Yi up and down with a suspicious expression. "During the demon rampage six years ago, you were the one who defeated the demon king, weren't you? Several months ago, you were the one who caught the Old Devil, weren't you? That biggest dark force Immortal Mansion fell because of you, and you also played a key role in the capture of Evil Sword God. I've seen you on TV, there's no mistake."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>Erm...</p>

    <p>For a moment, Zhuo Yi felt like he couldn't defend himself at all.</p>

    <p>First of all, he really wasn't a police officer...</p>

    <p>But...</p>

    <p>He indeed was the one who had caught those people...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi dropped his forehead into his hand and felt like there was no way to explain it.</p>

    <p>There were too many things nowadays that couldn't be explained - this was how the Yellow River was washed yellow <sup>1</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is adapted from the
colloquial phrase 'Even
jumping into the Yellow River
won't wash you clean,'
meaning that there's nothing
a person can do to remove
whatever stigma is on him ..)</dfn>

    <p>Sorting out his chaotic thoughts, Zhuo Yi looked embarrassed as he opened his mouth. "I'm not a police officer. I work for the General Administration of 100 Cultivation Schools, which is part of the Education Department... I'm not looking for trouble today. I just want to ask about the scabbard of a peach wood sword from ten years ago."</p>

    <p>Saying this, Zhuo Yi brought the photo up on his phone.</p>

    <p>The shopkeeper stared at the screen. He thought there were still more photos of the peach wood sword, so swiped across, only to suddenly see a selfie of Zhuo Yi and a customized human doll - furthermore, the doll... looked exactly like the other youngster in the shop!</p>

    <p>Dazed, the shopkeeper seemed to realize something.</p>

    <p>He quickly swiped back to the first photo and pretended that he hadn't seen anything.</p>

    <p>It was deadly to know too many secrets nowadays!</p>

    <p>The shopkeeper took a deep breath and quickly came back to the topic at hand. "Hmm... It was indeed my shop which sold this sword. I still remember - it was back when the peach wood sword cost 998 HNY, right?"</p>

    <p>Both Wang Ling and Zhuo Yi were dumbfounded at the shopkeeper's amazing memory - that was over ten years ago!</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Boss, how can you be so sure? Ling Huan said that all your shop receipts were lost in a fire."</p>

    <p>"There's no mistake. Ten years ago, I was running on a shoestring budget, and I made this sword myself. While the receipt is gone, I remember the pattern on this wooden sword."</p>

    <p>The shopkeeper was melancholy as he looked at the photo. "This was a love token I was going to give to my fiancée back then. After I finished making the sword, I was going to propose to her three days later on the bank of Pubei River, but she didn't keep our appointment. Not only that, she never appeared again after that."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Wang Ling and Zhuo Yi were silent.</p>

    <p>It looked like this shopkeeper was also a man with a story.</p>

    <p>The shopkeeper: "I remember it very clearly. When she didn't show up, I looked for her for a very long time before I gave up. That was when I was feeling depressed, which is why I sold it for so cheap at 998 HNY. This sword is made of solid wood, and would have been of the best quality back then.</p>

    <p>"In those days, peach wood swords sold like hot cakes, and to save on wood costs, merchants started to make hollow peach wood swords and fill them with sand."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>The shopkeeper gave the phone back to Zhuo Yi. "Why are you asking about this sword?"</p>

    <p>"We want to know where its scabbard is."</p>

    <p>"I put the scabbard away. My fiancée was a carpenter; she made the scabbard and I made the sword. Only by combining the two would the peach wood sword be complete. This was our mutual love token. Do you want to buy the scabbard?"</p>

    <p>The shopkeeper waved his hands. "After so many years, I still haven't found any news on my fiancée; there's no meaning in me keeping the scabbard. I can even give it to you for free. But, I have one condition."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi smiled lightly. "Let us hear it."</p>

    <p>"Business is poor, and my shop won't stay open for much longer. You know, my Shop Number 83 is the oldest in the whole flower and bird market." The shopkeeper said sadly, "This is a family legacy which I can't give up so easily. Thus, I signed up for the exorcism competition this year. There is a prize, which will be enough for me to expand my shop twenty times and revamp it a hundred times over."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "So?"</p>

    <p>"There are a lot of experts at the exorcism convention this year. My chances of winning are very low. I want you to take part with me in the exorcism competition! Since you were able to apprehend the Old Devil, the Master of Immortal Mansion and that Evil Sword God, I believe you aren't weak."</p>

    <p>Saying this, the shopkeeper gave Wang Ling a look. "Is that pretty boy behind you your disciple? A youngster's skills should be pretty good. Then, he can also take part. It just so happens that each group which signs up for the exorcism competition has to have four members; just nice, the four of us can form a team."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Boss, may I ask, what is your name?"</p>

    <p>"Jin Ke."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Jin from gold, Ke from section chief."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
