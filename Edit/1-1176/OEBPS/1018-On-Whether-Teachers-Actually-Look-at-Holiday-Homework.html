  <h1>Chapter 1018 On Whether Teachers Actually Look at Holiday Homework</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Although Wang Nuan was still an embryo that had yet to fully develop, Wang Ling already knew from the blast wave that had come out of the belly that this kid wasn't destined to be ordinary...</p>

    <p>This realization also terrified Father and Mother Wang a little; this scene was too similar to when Wang Ling had broken that precious sword.</p>

    <p>A Body Refinement couple giving birth to two fiends one after another... Father and Mother Wang felt that if this matter was exposed, it wouldn't be their two kids who were dragged onto Approaching Science<sup>1</sup>, but themselves...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A Chinese documentary film program.)</dfn>

    <p>Because of the sea village's wonderful packaging, practically all the family's acquaintances found out about Mother Wang's second pregnancy. The express deliveries didn't stop arriving at the Wang family's small villa for two days, all of which were gifts for Mother Wang and Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>Mother Wang was popular to begin with. Even though she lived in the outskirts and it wasn't especially convenient for her to meet up with friends, distance couldn't block out the sincere well wishes of a true friend!</p>

    <p>Not even mountains and rivers could stop a true friend from sending well wishes; this was something fairweather friends couldn't compare with.</p>

    <p>"Ai, I never thought everyone would be so kind." Gazing at the express deliveries, Mother Wang felt both warm and depressed. If she had known earlier, she wouldn't have gone shopping at the cultivation department store... Her friends were very thoughtful. And who knew whether they had discussed it among themselves, but they had all sent different things.</p>

    <p>All kinds of magic artifacts for prenatal education, baby products, tonics for pregnant women... Most excessive of all, someone had even sent a topped-up membership card for supplementary courses. Written on the card was a wise saying that Wang Ling had heard in all kinds of educational ads since young: Don't shortchange your children at the starting line!</p>

    <p>These words made a lot of sense, but when it came to the Wang family's children, it was a load of bull! After all, by the time they were born, they had already reached the finish line...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At noon on September 16th, Wang Ling received the first message in a while in Number 60 High's Grade One, Class Three small squad chat. Wang Ling had always felt that basically no one posted in a class chat without an ulterior motive. On the whole, if something really did happen after graduation, some chose to DM other classmates about it, while others were more likely to show off in the group - there were too many cases nowadays of success stories after graduation who showed off in the group, thus inciting resentment.</p>

    <p>Group chats while still at school were still pure for the most part.</p>

    <p>Like now...</p>

    <p>Chen Chao first posted several picturesque photos.</p>

    <p>One could tell that his temporary disappearance had to do with traveling. The summer break was long, so going out to expand his horizons was understandable. The cultivation world was so big, and it was far from enough to only experience it through travel during the high school break.</p>

    <p>But the travel experience was necessary: five percent of the college entrance exam had to do with the development of extracurricular knowledge. Students who wanted to get into a famous university would never give up that five percent. Additionally, there had never been a fixed criterion for this part of the assessment; it was completely up to the teacher who set the question. If you didn't know anything about the topic, your head would explode when you read the test question.</p>

    <p>"Look... how beautiful is the scenery?" Chen Chao posted several pictures one after another.</p>

    <p>"The scenery where I am isn't bad either..." Following Chen Chao's lead, Guo Hao also posted several pictures.</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling was silent and didn't respond.</p>

    <p>Su Xiao was smart. As Number 60 High's Grade One, Class Three's most excellent commissary in charge of studies, he straightaway read between the lines of these pictures. "Let's hear it: how much more homework do you still have to finish..."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao was so moved that he wanted to cry. "Su Xiao, you understand me! Actually, it isn't very much. In addition to not finishing maths, physics and chemistry, I haven't done the rest yet either."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Su Xiao: "Why not just say that you haven't done any of it?"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao chuckled. "Doesn't this make it sound more intellectual?"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao added, "The world is so big, we want to go out and take a look around. There's nothing wrong with that! In any case, as long as we have our brethren, there will always be a way to deal with homework! Expanding our extracurricular knowledge is also very important!"</p>

    <p>"Then why don't you go and borrow Sun Rong's homework?" The corners of Su Xiao's mouth twitched as he sent a message in the group somewhat resentfully.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Sun Rong... The way she solves problems is too advanced. Most likely, her family hired her some private tutor. If we copy off her, Old Pan will be able to tell with one glance." Guo Hao directly sent a voice message to the group. "I've already discussed it with Chen Chao: as long as you and Wang Ling lend us your homework to copy, we can deal with this matter. First of all, the way you solve problems is within what we've learned and what was taught in class; this is something Chao and I have come to understand after copying your homework multiple times before."</p>

    <p>Su Xiao and Wang Ling were both stupefied. "..."</p>

    <p>These sly foxes were now so experienced in copying...</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "It's like this: I'll copy 70% of Su Xiao's homework, then 30% of Wang Ling's. Chen Chao will do the opposite. Old Pan absolutely won't be able to tell."</p>

    <p>Su Xiao chuckled. "You really think Old Pan is stupid..."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, we won't copy everything; we'll definitely deliberately copy some of it wrong."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Of course, Chen Chao and I wouldn't be bothering to spend so much effort on homework if not for the assignment credits. The teachers gave us so much homework for the summer vacation. When they collect the homework at school, the piles will be as tall as mountains. The semester will have just begun and they'll be busy with lessons. If they already don't have enough time to prepare for class, how can they be in the mood to mark the summer homework?" Guo Hao's analysis was clear and logical.</p>

    <p>In fact, the phenomenon he was talking about wasn't limited to high schools; even in junior high, teachers dealt with the winter and summer homework in the following three ways:</p>

    <p>The first way: Classify and count. Put simply, the homework was collected first, and the number of students who did or did not hand in the work was counted. Teachers called the parents of students who didn't hand in the homework, while the students who submitted the work were divided into groups to mark each other's homework; the teachers just needed to give them the answers at the front of the classroom.</p>

    <p>The second way: Deferred punishment. The teachers in this category were more benevolent. They knew that a lot of students were procrastinators who tended to do their homework in the last few days of the summer vacation, so the teachers deliberately set a later submission deadline. It didn't have anything to do with whether the homework was done well or not; instead, completing the homework was a matter of attitude. So usually, teachers like these didn't care whether or not you finished your homework; as long as you handed it in by the deadline, you were safe... If you didn't hand it in, you would be straightaway sentenced to death...</p>

    <p>The third way: Save energy and protect the environment. This was a simpler and more crude method, which relied mostly on bluffs. The truth was that these teachers didn't care if students finished their holiday homework or not. It was the holidays, and was originally a time to relax and have fun; there was no need for teachers to be so disobliging. Thus, after gathering the holiday homework, these teachers would outright cast the "Notes Removal Spell" and leave this holiday homework for next year's batch of juniors... Recycle and never waste...</p>
