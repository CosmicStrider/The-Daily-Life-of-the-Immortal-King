  <h1>Chapter 881 Cheeky Little Wang Ling!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Immortal Toya sniffled a little despairingly (╥_╥).</p>

    <p>He had worked hard for so many years, going to so much trouble for something that in the end could be solved with a few crispy noodle snack packets. Not only had the work taxed his body, it had slowed down his cultivation greatly.</p>

    <p>Gazing at this restored and flawless Nine Cycles Exquisite Pagoda, Immortal Toya was overwhelmed by a mix of emotions in that moment.</p>

    <p>It could only be said that Ling Zhenren was Ling Zhenren.</p>

    <p>He could even perfectly fix a magic weapon like this in an instant. This absolutely wasn't something an ordinary man could do! Even General Yi and the others Ten Generals wouldn't have been able to do it.</p>

    <p>The Nine Cycles Exquisite Pagoda was a world-defying magic artifact.</p>

    <p>To be able to instantly fix a world-defying magic artifact was too terrifying!</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, in his bathroom, Wang Ling withdrew his hand.</p>

    <p>Of course, it wasn't that he was able to repair magic artifacts, but that he had used a time reversal spell to return the Nine Cycles Exquisite Pagoda to its former state, which couldn't be considered completely repairing it.</p>

    <p>But there was a limit on this time reversal spell, as the cooldown period between use was very long.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had once tried to restore his crispy noodle snacks with this spell.</p>

    <p>For example, if he left some crispy noodle snack crumbs behind, he could use this technique to turn a crispy noodle snack he had already eaten back to its original state.</p>

    <p>But it had taken so long that he could only give up.</p>

    <p>Of course, Wang Ling had been more mischievous as a kid, and had once used this technique to play a prank.</p>

    <p>Back when Father Wang had docked his allowance for breaking a pair of chopsticks, Wang Ling used the time reversal spell to delete Father Wang's drafts in his manuscript folder.</p>

    <p>Subsequently, Father Wang had earned very little that month since he didn't have drafts to submit.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling's allowance had shrunk drastically...</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling had the capability, the Wang household earned money through honest means, and most of their expenses were covered by Father Wang's profits as a writer.</p>

    <p>Little Wang Ling didn't know if Father Wang realized he was the one who had done it.</p>

    <p>Thinking carefully now, Wang Ling guessed Father Wang probably knew back then.</p>

    <p>But after that one time, little Wang Ling understood that it wasn't easy for his father.</p>

    <p>From then on, he never did anything as cheeky anymore.</p>

    <p>Life in the Wang household was very slow-paced; even Father and Mother Wang's approach to educating children was slow and steady.</p>

    <p>When it came to educating children, they never advocated for violence as a way to solve problems.</p>

    <p>Domestic violence was useless.</p>

    <p>Mm...</p>

    <p>The main reason being that they weren't Wang Ling's match...</p>

    <p>Even if they joined hands, Wang Ling's physique was too powerful, and the backlash generated was so strong they would only hurt themselves.</p>

    <p>So whenever Wang Ling did something wrong as a child, what Father and Mother Wang often did was have him stand against the wall as punishment, dock his allowance, forbid him to eat crispy noodle snacks and so on. Standing against the wall had been good for developing Wang Ling's lumbar vertebra and leg muscles - in fact, his Sage Body had been the result of being punished to stand against the wall...</p>

    <p>In front of his table, Wang Ling's mind suddenly drifted back to his past when he was little.</p>

    <p>To be honest, if it hadn't been for Father Wang and Mother Wang's proper guidance, even Wang Ling himself didn't know what kind of person he would have turned into.</p>

    <p>Excessive power usually went to a person's head, and the smallest misdeed could cause a person to fall into an abyss.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought he was lucky to have grown up in such a blessed way despite the occasional distress.</p>

    <p>To help Immortal Toya fix the Nine Cycle Exquisite Pagoda, Wang Ling used the time reversal spell this time.</p>

    <p>But actually, this was compensation from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Because he had secretly watched the battle just now between Devil Gut Fungus Lord and Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>He never expected the bacterium he enchanted to come out and be so tyrannical.</p>

    <p>This was his blunder.</p>

    <p>Thus, after fixing the Nine Cycles Exquisite Pagoda, Wang Ling was pondering how to kill the bacterium.</p>

    <p>This was an enchanted bacterium, which was a little troublesome.</p>

    <p>The gremlins he had enlightened in the past didn't have the ability to mature.</p>

    <p>But not only could this Devil Gut Fungus Lord mature, it could also devour other people's abilities for its own use.</p>

    <p>When it came to a gremlin that was capable of growing, there was no way to undo the enchantment on it any longer.</p>

    <p>What Wang Ling had to do was completely destroy Devil Gut Fungus Lord.</p>

    <p>"Track it down for me."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling spoke telepathically to Book of Sage Immortal on the table.</p>

    <p>"Yes, my lord."</p>

    <p>Book of Sage Immortal's screen showed a radar scan as it searched for Devil Gut Fungus Lord's location. Although the latter had learned to travel through space after devouring the Cosmic God Tree's spatial abilities, it didn't have the ability to leap beyond the universe.</p>

    <p>As long as it was still inside the seventh universe, Book of Sage Immortal would be able to quickly fix onto Devil Gut Fungus Lord's specific location with its radar search function.</p>

    <p>"I've found it, my lord." After several dozen seconds, Book of Sage Immortal conveyed the news. "According to the GPS, Devil Gut Fungus Lord has escaped abroad and is active on the border of Mixiu nation."</p>

    <p>"Escaped abroad?" Wang Ling was startled.</p>

    <p>"It seems that my wise lord is pondering how to eliminate Devil Gut Fungus Lord? I've come up with a thousand ways, and have analyzed three that I believe my lord is definitely considering."</p>

    <p>Book of Sage Immortal said, "Devil Gut Fungus Lord is active on the border of Mixiu nation. I've analyzed that there's a 78% chance that it will run into President Bai of Night Chief. If the two of them meet, Devil Gut Fungus Lord has a 97% chance of winning that fight. Although its strength will be greatly enhanced after devouring President Bai's abilities, it won't be a threat to my lord at all. Instead, it'll help my lord to get rid of the hidden danger that is President Bai. When the time comes, my lord can then send a clone to finish Devil Gut Fungus Lord off, which will be killing two birds with one stone."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"The second method is simple and blunt. My lord can directly open a space to go and put down Devil Gut Fungus Lord. The hidden danger with this method, however, is that my lord will very likely be detected by Mixiu nation's secret agents. Mixiu is already keeping a very close watch on Night Chief and the FCI is currently carrying out an investigation. If we leave Night Chief be, the probability that FCI will get rid of them in the future is 67%, while there is a 34% chance that President Bai is killed. If my lord directly takes action, the probability of Night Chief being eliminated is 1000%, and there's a 2000% chance that President Bai will die. The probability of Devil Gut Fungus Lord dying is 3000%, but the risk of being detected by the FCI is 47%."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"The third method is to get someone else to do the dirty work. My lord can entrust your friend Immortal Toya to go abroad and put down Devil Gut Fungus Lord. With the Nine Cycle Exquisite Pagoda, the probability of Immortal Toya eliminating Night Chief is 72%, and the probability of President Bai and Devil Gut Fungus Lord being killed is 68% and 54% respectively. If my lord lends a hand, the probability in each case can increase to 100% or even higher."</p>

    <p>Book of Sage Immortal: "Looking at my lord's composed expression, I believe my lord has made your decision? I'm guessing that my lord is definitely considering the third method, is that right?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
