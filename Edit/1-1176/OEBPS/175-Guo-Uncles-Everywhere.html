  <h1>Chapter 175 Guo Uncles Everywhere </h1>

  <div>

    <p><strong>Translator:</strong> Henyee Translations <strong>Editor:</strong> JulesNye</p>

    <p>It was June 6th, the seventh Monday of school.</p>

    <p>This morning, the students of Grade One, Class Three were naturally gossiping about the string of incidents that had occurred after the Shadow Stream maiden had broken out of prison to when she had been caught again. In fact, it wasn't just Grade One, Class Three; everywhere in the city, conversation among the melon seed-eating masses<sup>1</sup> in the last few days had revolved around this topic.</p>

    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This refers to the bystanders who watch as things happen, like the popcorn eating meme..)</dfn>    

    <p>From the Shadow Stream maiden's prison break to Shadow Stream's headquarters being flattened by an unidentified "person" to the arrest of the maiden once again... this string of bombshells which made international headlines had all happened in the thirty six hours after the girl had first broken out of prison.</p>

    <p>After this incident, there were two people who had become famous.</p>

    <p>The first was Warden Liang of Songhai First Prison. Some thought that he had deliberately released the Shadow Stream maiden in order to catch bigger fish with a longer fishing line, hence culminating in such an explosive ending.</p>

    <p>The second was Zhuo Yi... from the annihilation of the Shadow Stream killers who had invaded Number 60 High School to the arrest of the killer maiden in Number 59 High School, then to this string of incidents, it seemed that lately, any news about Shadow Stream had all had something to do with this young Director of the General Administration of 100 Schools.</p>

    <p>After Guo Hao half-assed the copying of his homework, he began to connect this string of incidents together with a surreptitious look in his narrow eyes. "I have an uncle who works in the prison. He said someone saw with their own eyes that Shadow Stream girl fall out of a space tunnel that had suddenly appeared in midair..."</p>

    <p>Everyone was startled. "Space tunnel?"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao frowned. "Spatial magic has been strictly banned by the nation since it can cause many unnecessary issues. That's why every major city has a space tower set up to monitor the fluctuations of city space."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao nodded and continued, "That's the weird part. I have a uncle who works in the space tower. He told me that at the time of the incident, the tower didn't sense any abnormalities. This proves two things..."</p>

    <p>Everyone was curious. "What two things?"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao scratched his chin. "The special tower was functioning normally, yet there wasn't a hint of any fluctuations at all. This proves that firstly, this person who used spatial magic has power far beyond the tower's surveillance range. Secondly, there is no way this person is an alien like the experts said on the news."</p>

    <p>"Why's that?"</p>

    <p>"Because there currently aren't any strong aliens at all!" Guo Hao said with a wise air. "I have an uncle who works in the Ministry of National Defense who told me that a while ago, a disorderly battle broke out in the M78 nebula. It was our General Yi of the Ministry of National Defense who personally went to mediate. With one wave of his Sky-Parting Sword, he caused the rebel army who were all tens of meters tall to lose the will to fight..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..." How many fucking uncles do you have?!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At night, Lord Diulei paid a visit to the Wang family's small villa once again. This time, he brought fifty to sixty jin of broccoli with him. This broccoli was the latest batch which he had grown on spirit soil. Of course, the "mother" of this broccoli was the one which Grandfather Wang had picked up and placed in Lord Diulei's bowl.</p>

    <p>He had already brought broccoli to the Wang family's small villa several times in a row, and he always seemed disappointed or frustrated each time; until now, he still hadn't been able to figure out the meaning behind Grandfather Wang giving him the broccoli back then...</p>

    <p>He had left Song Qingshu to look after things in Wenxian Garden. The man had completely become Lord Diulei's housekeeper. The hawthorn seed which they had planted previously had recently shown signs of breaking through the soil, and at this stage, it needed a lot of tender care. In fact, Song Qingshu had actually changed a lot after leaving Mo Immortal Castle, and had become a lot more cheerful. In addition, he had sold off all his ill-gotten magic treasures from when he had worked at Mo Immortal Castle and had invested in numerous charity organizations.</p>

    <p>Although Song Qingshu was still under observation, compared with when they had first met, Lord Diulei had relaxed his guard considerably around the man. Moreover, the fighting lion was also still around to watch him as well.</p>

    <p>After the last time when Immortal Toya had lent the fighting lion to Lord Diulei for two days, the lion had been unwilling to go back for some reason. No matter how Immortal Toya tried, this fighting lion wouldn't move an inch.</p>

    <p>It just lay lazily at the front door of Lord Diulei's villa, eyes fixed in one direction. Lord Diulei knew that the Wang family's small villa was in that direction... this fighting lion actually wanted to see Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>It used to be a proud creature that had never lowered its head to anyone, but these days after Wang Ling had left, it was like a maiden in love who looked forward to Wang Ling's appearance again.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei felt that Wang Ling was perhaps the only one who had this type of power to tame a creature as unruly as this in a short period of time.</p>

    <p>This time, he had come to the Wang family's small villa because Wang Ling had specially asked him to. So after greeting the seniors downstairs with broccoli in hand, Lord Diulei directly went upstairs to look for Wang Ling in his room.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, you're looking for me?" When Lord Diulei opened the door, he saw two muscular brothers at the table studiously helping Wang Ling write his homework.</p>

    <p>Er Ha had already smelled Lord Diulei's aura from afar. Lying prone on the ground, it raised its light green head and gave a polite nod.</p>

    <p>Sitting cross-legged on the bed, Wang Ling was gazing solemnly at a stone chest in front of him.</p>

    <p>"This is..." When Lord Diulei caught sight of this slightly plain stone chest, he suddenly became deeply respectful. Holding this stone chest in his hands as he sized it up, he noted that it was completely closed-off with no way to open it. But with his Heavenly Eye, he could clearly see that a small section of it was completely empty.</p>

    <p>"This is a mask chest; after the mask inside was taken out, the chest was undoubtedly sealed from the outside, which is why it's closed-off like this." Lord Diulei held the stone chest in his hands as his gaze swept over it carefully. Judging from its design style and that faint but familiar sense of blood, he was almost positive that this stone chest had been used to store the stone ghost mask!</p>

    <p>At the very beginning, the stone ghost mask had stirred up a foul wind and a rain of blood in the cultivation world. The most frightening part was that it was so hard that there was no way to completely destroy it. Therefore, quite a number of craftsmen had researched ways to seal it. It was very obvious that this mask chest was a product of that time, created by some craftsman to seal away the stone ghost mask.</p>

    <p>It was also very clear that the stone ghost mask had once been sealed inside this mask chest for some time. Who knew when it had been taken out, and the chest reworked to conceal the fact?</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling, where did you find this stone chest?" Lord Diulei was very curious.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling telepathically conveyed the facts of the chest's origin to him.</p>

    <p>"Cats?" Lord Diulei was stunned when he heard this. He finally knew the truth of the annihilation of Shadow Stream's headquarters which had been on the news these two days.</p>

    <p>If this story got out, how many diligent cultivators would cover their faces and run around in a frenzy?</p>

    <p>For the first time in his life, Lord Diulei felt that all his life achievements had actually lost out to a few cats.</p>
