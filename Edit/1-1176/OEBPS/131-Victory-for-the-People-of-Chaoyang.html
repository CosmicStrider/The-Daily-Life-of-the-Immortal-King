  <h1>Chapter 131 Victory for the People of Chaoyang </h1>

  <div>

    <p>When Zhou Wei was arrested, he was still completely bewildered.</p>

    <p>This mass surround and capture operation at the airport had been a joint effort between Zheng Tan's Independent Regiment and Madam Dong's General Administration of Harmony. After two hours of surveillance, the operation proceeded smoothly and successfully.</p>

    <p>Of course, it had been Wang Ling who had leaked the news that Zhou Wei was fleeing.</p>

    <p>There was a large baccarat bar in downtown Songhai city. The boss of this bar was the leader of the Green Gang, Zhou Jie.</p>

    <p>Immediately after Zhou Wei had been caught, all the main news media outlets had scrambled to report this incident.</p>

    <p>In the bar, Zhou Jie was already completely dumbstruck when he watched the news. After listening to Song Qingshu's suggestion, he had almost immediately gotten in touch with his contacts, and after some coaxing, had found the right connections to help give Zhou Wei a new, foreign identity and to enable him to leave through the green passage.</p>

    <p>Zhou Jie had completely never expected that it would still end in failure.</p>

    <p>This website novelist Wang Situ... who on earth was he?</p>

    <p>On the news, Zhou Wei's face had been obscured by mosaic tiles. Seeing him being taken away from the scene by a fat officer who had personally handcuffed him, Zhou Jie could feel his scalp turning numb.</p>

    <p>He was feeling a lot of different emotions: there was anger, and also terror. The Green Gang had operated in Songhai city for so many years, but Zhou Jie had never felt like this, like shrimp being played around with in the palm of someone's hand.</p>

    <p>Silently lighting a cigarette, Zhou Jie put a call through to Song Qingshu again. "Brother Song..."</p>

    <p>On the other end of the line, Song Qingshu also let out a sigh. "You don't need to say anything. I saw the situation on the news."</p>

    <p>"What do we do now?" Zhou Jie was really at a loss.</p>

    <p>"My advice now is that you should relocate the Green Gang as soon as possible. Even if it's only for the short term, you should move to the next district rather than stay in Songhai City so that your Green Gang isn't affected by this incident and suffer even larger losses." Song Qingshu rubbed at the skin between his eyebrows, his head aching. "I know you must feel wronged, but we must face the reality... we can't deal with this person for the time being, and it's best that we don't attempt to investigate his true identity."</p>

    <p>Zhou Jie nodded as he replied, "I understand, Brother Song."</p>

    <p>At the moment, whether it was the Green Gang or Mo Immortal Castle, they were both in the same boat.</p>

    <p>Zhou Jie was well aware that the reason why Song Qingshu was still willing to help him was because Mo Immortal Castle was afraid that this Green Gang incident might create ripple effects that would also impact on Mo Immortal Castle's expansion in Songhai city.</p>

    <p>Zhou Jie was as clear as a mirror on this point. "Brother Song, don't worry, I'll arrange for our retreat straightaway; I'll withdraw key Green Gang members from Songhai city within two days."</p>

    <p>"Mm, do it as soon as possible."</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu nodded. "Although we can't immediately take revenge right now, there still remains a slight chance of success. In order to strike back perfectly... we have to learn to win against the gods by half a point <sup>1</sup> ! Do you know where the chance for success lies?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>("Victory against the gods by
half a point" is from the
novel A Game of Go with the
Gods, in which a Go
enthusiast plays a game of
Go against a god and defies
the god's power to win by
the closest of margins -
but loses his life in the process.)</dfn>

    <p>On the other end of the phone, Zhou Jie was silent.</p>

    <p>Win against the gods by half a point?</p>

    <p>Cupping his chin in his hand, he pondered the question for quite a while. Finally, he suddenly raised his head and replied, "It's Qi Tongwei! <sup>2</sup> "</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Qi Tongwei is a tragic villain
from the TV series 'In the
Name of the People' who
became more and more
corrupted and ruthless in
his ways as the story
progressed. Ultimately,
when his crimes were
exposed, he committed
suicide out of remorse.)</dfn>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu pulled a long face. "Of course not!"</p>

    <p>Zhou Jie: "This little brother is slow, please tell me, Brother Song."</p>

    <p>Song Qingshu: "Then just quickly tell me the whereabouts of the maker of the stone ghost mask... it's already been a few days and you're still being secretive about it? Keeping it to yourself is useless, trust me..."</p>

    <p>Zhou Jie: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>This Weibo battle centered around the issue of "groping" eventually ended with Father Wang's victory.</p>

    <p>In the end, not only had the opponent been defeated by Father Wang, he had also died with one flick of a finger from Father Wang's most powerful fan.</p>

    <p>On May 28th, the fifth Friday after the start of the semester, Wang Ling read the Cultivation News Morning Post from top to bottom.</p>

    <p>The first article: Complete victory for the mysterious power from the east behind Wang Situ. What was the real reason behind it? Download the Weibo app to find out...</p>

    <p>The second article: A part-timer has performed an outstanding service for society once again! Experienced Officer Wang personally arrested case suspect Zhou. In an interview, experienced Officer Wang pragmatically said it was all due to the people's efforts!</p>

    <p>The third article: Yesterday, the pursuit and interception efforts by the masses and a group of cats led to the capture of suspect Zhou, wanted nationwide for groping, at Dahuang International Airport. Experts say that this group of people and cats are very likely to be descendents of Chaoyang city inhabitants<sup>3</sup>... </p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(This refers to an app in
China called Chaoyang
Qunzhong, which can be
translated as "the masses of
Chaoyang District," through
which users can submit tips
on criminal activities. In
recent years, the "Chaoyang
masses" have become
well-known for providing
tips that led to several
celebrities being charged
for drug use or
prostitution ..)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling got to school in the morning, the talk today was almost all about that arrest at the airport on Thursday. Because of Father Wang, the groping case had continued to ferment in the last two days, until the entire nation knew about it.</p>

    <p>Nobody knew where Guo Hao had learned the news, but he started to earnestly spread the gossip around in class. "Do you know, it's rumored that the suspect arrested in the groping case has a powerful background; his brother is the leader of Songhai city's largest underground gang, Green Gang. He has godly connections! Just a little bit further and he would have escaped through the green passage at the airport!"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao frowned. "Even with such a background he hadn't been able to run, and the local government is keeping a strict eye on this issue. Doesn't this prove that there's an even more powerful person sitting behind Guru Wang Situ?"</p>

    <p>Lin Xiaoyu: "Why talk about such drivel so early in the morning?! Anyway, I'm more interested in the kind of punishment which that person will receive. Wouldn't he just be detained for a while?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong shook her head and said, "This incident has caused quite an uproar. This person probably won't get out for several years. Last night, the local government actually gave our Huaguo Water Curtain Group notice and requested that we push out a pepper spray for women, in line with the government's promotion of a nationwide anti-pervert agenda."</p>

    <p>Lin Xiaoyu abruptly looked a little disappointed. "That's all? I figured that this guy's Tower of Babel would be chopped off!"</p>

    <p>Everybody: "..." Too fucking savage!</p>

    <p>At this point in the group's discussion, Guo Hao suddenly interrupted them. "I have a video of the arrest made in the airport yesterday. Those who want it can look for me. It's fifty yuan a copy, a fair bargain!"</p>

    <p>After he said this, the whole class was dead silent. Seeing that nobody was paying him any attention, Guo Hao was a little embarrassed.</p>

    <p>However, Guo Hao was Guo Hao. He immediately grabbed hold of Su Xiao, who was collecting homework, and tried to dispel his embarrassment. "Classmate Su Xiao, I know you're interested in my video, want to buy it?"</p>

    <p>Su Xiao pulled his neck back and when he struggled free of Guo Hao's unexpected bearhug, he looked extremely frustrated.</p>

    <p>Startled by this expression, Guo Hao immediately loosened his grip. "I'm just selling a video, you don't have to be so unhappy about it, right?!"</p>

    <p>Su Xiao shook his head. "No, I was just thinking, why would I be targeted by someone selling videos..."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "..."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>
