  <h1>Chapter 520 Dog of Salvation </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Although Immortal Zhenyuan clearly knew that this answer was a little too unrealistic, in the end, he was a person who had seen so much of the world, so he quickly regained his composure. There were too many bizarre things nowadays, and he had grown used to them.</p>

    <p>In fact, whenever he had done the divination before, he had thought it was very strange, because the final result was always the letter "G"- until now, Immortal Zhenyuan had had no idea what on earth it meant.</p>

    <p>At the very beginning, he had thought that it might be a surname.</p>

    <p>But he very quickly rejected this answer.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, when something happened in the entertainment circle, some people would reveal XXX about some teen idol "G"...</p>

    <p>While the other party had at least given a hint, the letter "G" alone was too broad a hint!</p>

    <p>When he saw Er Ha appear, Immortal Zhenyuan suddenly felt relieved.</p>

    <p>It turned out...</p>

    <p>The meaning of G here...</p>

    <p>... Was "dog"<sup>1</sup>...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(In pinyin for dog is 'gou.')</dfn>

    <p>At that moment, Immortal Zhenyuan suddenly felt that the principle "The greatest truths are the simplest" really did exist!</p>

    <p>As the red-haired young man hovered in the air at a distance and looked at Er Ha with a deeply moved expression, Wang Ling, who was invisible, could clearly hear his thoughts.</p>

    <p>Hm... G?</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling's first thought was that it was the first character in crispy noodle snacks<sup>2</sup>...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>('Gan cui mian' literally translates to 'dry and crispy noodles.')</dfn>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the air, Wang Ling watched the red-haired young man's every move. He hadn't expected this person to actually be the fabled Immortal Zhenyuan.</p>

    <p>This was probably Wang Ling's first encounter with a Venerated Immortal expert.</p>

    <p>He could clearly sense that this Immortal Zhenyuan and the person whom Er Ha had collided with and sent flying earlier both had the power of two Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>Daoist Guang was absolutely correct. After reaching Venerated Immortal level, you could indeed obtain the additional power of the Heavenly Dao - how many you could open up depended on luck and talent.</p>

    <p>This wasn't actually a new theory Daoist Guang was putting forward, but was something that had always existed.</p>

    <p>However, as the concentration of spirit qi in the current world of cultivators decreased with each passing day, many experts believed that there were likely no longer any masters above True Immortal level in the world. Therefore, the idea that cultivators were able to comprehend the Heavenly Dao after stepping into the Venerated Immortal realm actually hadn't yet been confirmed.</p>

    <p>Some extremists even thought that this Venerated Immortal realm didn't exist at all, and that the well-known "Immortal Zhenyuan" was just a legend.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling was now seeing this Immortal Zhenyuan in person, and so he could clarify some things.</p>

    <p>Firstly, Immortal Zhenyuan was indeed a Venerated Immortal.</p>

    <p>Secondly, you could indeed comprehend the Heavenly Dao after stepping into Venerated Immortal realm.</p>

    <p>Thirdly, these two points actually had nothing much to do with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Because to Wang Ling, two Heavenly Dao was nothing.</p>

    <p>The Venerated Immortal level certainly gave off a different feeling than the True Immortal level. When Wang Ling had met General Yi and Secretary Dakang before, he hadn't felt the slightest hint of fear at all... But now, Wang Ling's heart was beating two times more per minute at the very least.</p>

    <p>However, it was just two extra beats...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed in his heart, a little disappointed.</p>

    <p>To be honest...</p>

    <p>He felt that this Venerated Immortal realm was a little weak.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling still hadn't given up hope of finding the Immortal's Treasure House.</p>

    <p>Although this immortal was somewhat weaker than he had imagined, he had at least lived for longer - who knew whether that treasure house had something that could restrain Wang Ling's primordial qi?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's head was lowered in thought.</p>

    <p>"Senior Dog! Senior Dog!"</p>

    <p>Just then, Immortal Zhenyuan flew over with an excited look on his face as he kept saying "Senior Dog"- at first, it sounded like he was cursing.</p>

    <p>This action startled Er Ha a little.</p>

    <p>But with Wang Ling around, it very quickly regained its composure.</p>

    <p>Little Master Ling's qi surrounded Er Ha and it felt utterly at ease.</p>

    <p>It knew that Wang Ling had already become invisible and was standing behind it. Furthermore, Er Ha was covered in the golden light shield, so there was no need to be nervous at all.</p>

    <p>And now, Wang Ling was hinting that it should continue with the act...</p>

    <p>Er Ha could only do as it was told.</p>

    <p>"May I ask what is Senior Dog's name?" Immortal Zhenyuan was extremely deferential; from the look in his eyes, he already completely believed that Er Ha was the savior foretold by his divination.</p>

    <p>Er Ha wasn't in a hurry to speak; since it had to put on an act, then it should play it to its fullest.</p>

    <p>What genuine expert would engage in conversation so easily?</p>

    <p>Er Ha didn't even turn its head; in front of this Venerated Immortal's warm greeting, it just swished its tail like a duster and struck an elegant pose.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling was immaterial, it wasn't just his entire being that became like nothing; even his aura was thoroughly concealed, and since not even Immortal Zhenyuan could sense it, this was already enough to show the disparity between them.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Ling stood behind Er Ha and quietly watched his Er Ha play the role of a "savior."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had already learned the rough situation from Immortal Zhenyuan through his Mind-Reading Ability, and had also imparted the information to Er Ha.</p>

    <p>So Er Ha's expression was of someone who knew what was going on.</p>

    <p>Seeing how this Senior Dog ignored him the whole time, the red-haired young man immediately felt embarrassed. Just as he opened his mouth to speak, Er Ha directly raised one paw and pointed at the abyss below them as it indicated that the young man should remain silent.</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan was taken aback once again. "..."</p>

    <p>The savior was truly the savior who actually knew everything!</p>

    <p>He hadn't had to say anything!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the next instant, there was a bright glimmer of light in the gloomy pit below them, and a black-colored blade swung out from inside the abyss.</p>

    <p>"Senior, look out! This is the God Extermination Blade! It's a grade nine spell!" Immortal Zhenyuan called out in warning.</p>

    <p>Er Ha feigned calm as it closed its eyes. After all, it would be fine to leave everything to Little Master Ling. For a grade nine spell like this, it wouldn't be able to see its trajectory at all!</p>

    <p>So Er Ha might as well close its eyes!</p>

    <p>Just grade nine...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's lips twitched.</p>

    <p>Standing behind Er Ha as he faced the God Extermination Blade, Wang Ling flicked his finger and an intangible "air cannon" flew out from it.</p>

    <p>This was the most basic grade ten spell â€” the single-finger air cannon.</p>

    <p>In fact, there were also the two-finger, three-finger and the highest level four-finger air cannons, all of which Wang Ling could use.</p>

    <p>But the two-finger air cannon was a grade eleven spell, the three-finger a grade twelve spell, and the four-finger a grade thirteen spell...</p>

    <p>Because he had just arrived on this planet and didn't know much about its structure, Wang Ling was worried about causing excessive damage; it wouldn't be very polite to blow up the planet's core with his qi finger. In any case, Immortal Zhenyuan had traveled beyond the Milky Way for a thousand years before finding a planet fit for human habitation - it would be really bad if Wang Ling destroyed it.</p>

    <p>When this "single-finger air cannon" shot straight out, Immortal Zhenyuan saw the black God Extermination Blade which Wind Spirit had sent out from inside the abyss directly swallowed up halfway before it could do any sort of harm!</p>

    <p>When two spells collided with each other, there were only two outcomes: to explode or be swallowed up.</p>

    <p>Since the energy was swallowed up, this proved that the concentration of energy in the single-finger air cannon was far denser than that in the God Extermination Blade!</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan was instantly indescribably shaken!</p>

    <p>Senior Dog's expression had been so disdainful in the face of the God Extermination Blade.</p>

    <p>It actually closed its eyes!</p>

    <p>Furthermore, it could actually release such a powerful strike without lifting a finger...</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan was once again stunned. "..." Was this... the legendary Stand attack<sup>3</sup>?!</p>
