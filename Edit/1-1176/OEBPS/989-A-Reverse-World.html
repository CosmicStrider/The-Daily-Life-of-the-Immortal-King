  <h1>Chapter 989 A Reverse World</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was only after entering the Palace of Mirrors that Wang Ling and the others discovered how strange it was. They didn't emerge at the mouth of an alley, but seemed to have been transported to a random corner of the city. It wasn't just them, but different people continued to gather here in light particle bodies, some old and some young. After appearing in this world, it was as if they had been given new realms, and they all headed in one direction.</p>

    <p>In this flood of people, plenty of them were wearing white coats.</p>

    <p>"Isn't that Old Chen..." Guo Ping saw a familiar figure, but he felt that things weren't right and didn't step forward to call out to the other party.</p>

    <p>"It's pretty much as we guessed: sure enough, these people who died in the real world for one reason or another were brought back to life here." Wang Ming adjusted the armor on him and entered "camouflage mode." In this mode, Wang Ling One and Wang Ling Two would disguise themselves using masks similar to human skin.</p>

    <p>This was a function based on Wang Ling's "Great Transfiguration Spell" which Wang Ming developed after many experiments.</p>

    <p>"Shall we ask him about the situation?" Guo Ping gazed at the researcher with the surname Chen for a moment and thought of going over to ask about the situation. Before he could do so, however, the researcher in the white coat was promptly seized by shadows which had fallen from the sky.</p>

    <p>It was a group of black shadow men just like the five that had been captured previously. They were very skillful, and one could tell that they were probably also mercenary cultivators from hundreds of years ago whose identities couldn't be traced. They had also been resurrected after death and now served as the most loyal subordinates.</p>

    <p>"What are you doing... I, I need to go and report!" The researcher with the surname Chen struggled.</p>

    <p>"Settle down!" The head of the black shadow men struck the researcher hard in the stomach, and the latter passed out.</p>

    <p>Some busybodies nearby were watching.</p>

    <p>"What are you looking at?! These people are all criminals that need to be specially handled. Mind your own business and line up properly to register at the dream house!" The black shadow man sneered. He then lifted up the researcher, turned around, and vanished into thin air.</p>

    <p>The black shadow suits allowed them to come and go as they liked, and to disappear without a trace.</p>

    <p>It was clear that they had received special orders to look out for and seize newly-resurrected researchers in this Palace of Mirrors.</p>

    <p>Indeed, these scientific researchers had no idea how they had come to this world or how they had died.</p>

    <p>Their memories had all been tampered with.</p>

    <p>This was similar to people upgrading a game who needed to enter the novice village and find the original NPC who had given them a task in order to complete the setup.</p>

    <p>What on earth was this "dream house"?</p>

    <p>"Let's go take a look." Wang Ling and the others followed the trail.</p>

    <p>There were a lot of dream houses to register newcomers in this world. Going along with the masses, Wang Ling reached a dream house on a street which seemed a little familiar...</p>

    <p>Er Ha was wagging its tail next to Wang Ling, when it saw a sculpture so alarming that it broke out in a cold sweat - it was a sculpture of Er Ha in toad form, which was identical to the one close to Fang Xing's noodle shop in the center of the main street. It had changed, however - the original sculpture was of Zhuo Yi piercing the toad with a sword.</p>

    <p>After they entered the world of the Palace of Mirrors, the sculpture had become that of Er Ha swallowing Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>"So everything is reversed in the Palace of Mirrors?" Wang Ming and the others were also astonished at this scene.</p>

    <p>No wonder the street seemed a little familiar, yet different. The street layout was the same, but the direction it lay in had changed, and some of the history of the original world had been distorted to create a completely different ending.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing's noodle shop had also switched positions.</p>

    <p>The one thing that was completely different was the "dream house" which the black shadow man had mentioned earlier.</p>

    <p>This was the sole place set up by the creator behind the scenes of this world for registering newcomers. The setup inside the dream house was very simple: a woman, also wearing a black shadow suit, typed the registration information into a computer, while two black shadow goons stood on both sides to maintain order.</p>

    <p>Everyone who came here were asked a series of questions, before the registrar turned a prize wheel behind her.</p>

    <p>At the very beginning, Wang Ling and the others didn't understand what the wheel was for, but after watching several people register, they were enlightened.</p>

    <p>They were standing at the back of the line when a good-looking boy went up.</p>

    <p>"Name," the registrar asked.</p>

    <p>"Cai Yifan."</p>

    <p>The registrar typed the name into the computer and did a check. "Mm, you're Cai Yifan <sup>1</sup> . You like playing basketball, but people hate the unmanly way you play, and they made guichu videos of it. When you clicked a video, your heart was affected by the rhythm and inadvertently sped up with it, ultimately resulting in your death."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A combination of Cai Xukun and Wu Yifan.)</dfn>

    <p>When the registrar said this, the young man seemed to recall something and then shed tears of grievance. "That's right... that's what happened, I remember now..."</p>

    <p>"Mm, now is the moment to decide your fate." Then, the registrar spun the prize wheel behind her, and the pointer ultimately stopped on a strange rune.</p>

    <p>"Congratulations, it's the Human Path. You can continue to live here as a human." The registrar smiled.</p>

    <p>"Hu... man..."</p>

    <p>"Relax, this is a beautiful world where everyone is proud to play basketball. Your girly movements will be admired here. I hope you'll live well here. I'm called Dream Matron, I wouldn't deceive you."</p>

    <p>"Thank you."</p>

    <p>The young man looked grateful, but then looked puzzled. "Since I'm already dead, then is this heaven..."</p>

    <p>"You can think so. You don't need money to make any transactions in this world as all the resources here are shared. You can obtain and do whatever you want." The registrar smiled mysteriously. "Congratulations again. The possibility of getting 'human' on the prize wheel is very low."</p>

    <p>"It looks like there are six Paths written on the prize wheel." Er Ha spoke in the queue. "Hell Path, Hungry Ghost Path, Beast Path, Human Path, Asura Path and Nether Path... After Heavenly Path became an independent Great Dao, its original position was replaced with Nether Path."</p>

    <p>After Er Ha said this, a balding, scholarly-looking old man with glasses stepped forward.</p>

    <p>"Name," the registrar asked again.</p>

    <p>"Qu Yixian <sup>2</sup> ," said the old man.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(The person who put together "Three Five..")</dfn>

    <p>"Mm, I've checked, you died from overwork," Dream Matron looked at the screen and said.</p>

    <p>The old man recalled his experienced before his death and begged on the spot, "Please, Dream Matron, allow me to enter the Human Path as well... This old man has no talent, and I brought you some books I wrote as gifts."</p>

    <p>"Oh? Mister, you seem to be a man of some capability."</p>

    <p>The registrar codenamed Dream Matron gave a smile and took a look at the old man's books.</p>

    <p>They were: <em>Three Years of College Exams and Five Years of Simulations (1), </em><em>Three Years of College Exams and Five Years of Simulations (2), Three Years of College Exams and Five Years of Simulations (3)...</em></p>

    <p>"Take him away." Dream Matron had a pleasant expression on her face.</p>

    <p>"Not turning the prize wheel?" a black shadow goon asked.</p>

    <p>"No need, send him straight to the Beast Path."</p>
