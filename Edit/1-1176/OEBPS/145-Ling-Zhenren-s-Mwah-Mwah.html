  <h1>Chapter 145 Ling Zhenren's 'Mwah Mwah' </h1>

  <div>

    <p>The conclusion to this incident was that Zhuo Yi was of course allowed to withdraw completely.</p>

    <p>The first chair <sup>1</sup> of Songhai city's General Administration of 100 Schools, and the official promoted by Secretary Sun Dakang himself â€” no matter who you were, you had to weigh this issue. The traffic police captain hadn't expected to encounter such a big name here, and he instantly broke out in a cold sweat and even stuttered as he spoke. His aggressive attitude from before had immediately deflated, like a damaged balloon leaking air.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The term 'first chair' in
Chinese has a similar meaning
to how the term is used in an
orchestra to describe a
distinguished lead position
which is held by a highly
competent player.)</dfn>

    <p>"Do you know me?" Zhuo Yi smiled insincerely as he looked at the traffic police captain.</p>

    <p>At his question, the captain came back to his senses. "I didn't expect... Director Zhuo to be here!"</p>

    <p>All the police officers behind him didn't dare say anything. "..."</p>

    <p>"Then this tricycle...?" asked Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>The captain immediately shook his head tactfully. "Don't worry, Director Zhuo! Since this tricycle is Director Zhuo's... we won't impound it."</p>

    <p>"Then my tricycle broke traffic rules, will I still get demerits?" Zhuo Yi asked again.</p>

    <p>The captain sweated a little. "There was no one riding the tricycle, Director Zhuo is not to be blamed for it, so please don't worry..."</p>

    <p>"Then... a fine?" Zhuo Yi asked once again.</p>

    <p>The captain immediately shook his head like a rattle-drum. "No demerits, no fine, don't worry, Director Zhuo..."</p>

    <p>Goddamn, how dare he!</p>

    <p>Watching from the side, Wang Ling and Lord Diulei criticized the current cultivation bureaucracy's deplorable style in their hearts. Who knew that in the next moment, Zhuo Yi gripped the captain's shoulder and gave the police number on the right side of his chest a look. "PC12138?"</p>

    <p>"Director Zhuo, what's wrong..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi looked righteously at the traffic police captain, shaking his head. "Comrade Captain, I feel that I have to reprimand you! As a traffic police captain, how can you bend the law? I was testing you earlier... you've truly disappointed me!"</p>

    <p>The captain and the police officers behind him all lifted their heads, bewildered expressions on their faces. "..."</p>

    <p>"As an administrator and a cultivation law enforcer, you already couldn't pass this small test, how can you handle large matters in the future? Do you think your superiors will be able to trust you?" Zhuo Yi stared gravely at the captain as he rebuked him. The captain's forehead was already drenched with sweat.</p>

    <p>Following that, Zhuo Yi pointed to Number 2 Hospital Building. "Do you know which old leader I came to visit today? It's the former chief of the Cultivation Police, Old Man Chen Yanshi! Before he was hospitalized, he was still serving the people heart and soul, and worked hard for fairness and justice! Old Chen has seen what you've done today!"</p>

    <p>The captain and the police officers behind him all stood stiffly as they received Zhuo Yi's personal "teaching," not daring to utter even a single word.</p>

    <p>When he heard this, the captain's shoulders shook and he lowered his head. "Director Zhuo is right... I'm very ashamed, it's all my fault."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi nodded. "So, give demerits when you should give demerits, and fine when you should fine! Remember, you shouldn't be afraid of someone just because he is your leader, do you understand?"</p>

    <p>The captain straightened and saluted Zhuo Yi. "Yes, leader!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi nodded with satisfaction, then finally added, "Mm, you can give me the demerits and a ticket fine... by the by, leave the tricycle here, and give me a smaller demerit and fine."</p>

    <p>The police officers: "..."</p>

    <p>The captain was silent for a bit, then nodded weakly. "...Alright, leader."</p>

    <p>Watching this scene, both Wang Ling and Lord Diulei sucked in deep breaths.</p>

    <p>It could only be said that Zhuo Yi was already no longer the Zhuo Yi who didn't know anything. Since being promoted to the position of director, he had come into contact with a lot more people of different types; the most obvious change was his exceptionally slick and sly routine...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>There were some online guru novelists who had ongoing "fluid" plots, and who never remembered the holes which they had left. They would then directly use a fight at the end of the story; with the final villian's defeat, the story was considered finished. The specific term for this kind of writing style was "instantly bulldozing over the holes"; to summarize it in two simple words... this was the legendary "bad ending."</p>

    <p>Father Wang was a typical Virgo; he wanted to make sure his story ending was perfect! There was no way he would let the readers catch him with his pants down!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling went back to his room. Somewhat bored, he logged onto QQ, and discovered that the cultivation chat group was pretty lively today.</p>

    <p>The main reason was that on the way home, Lord Diulei had revealed the matter of Wang Ling "accepting a disciple."</p>

    <p>Instantly, the deathly silent chat group had become very active in the last few hours.</p>

    <p>The manager, Cailian Zhenren, sent a surprised emoji. "Ling Zhenren actually has a disciple? What does that person look like? Are they strong or not? Are they uniquely talented, mighty and awesome?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei replied quickly, "He seems to have only reached the Golden Core stage so far, but he's excellent at getting things done. Maybe that's why Ling Zhenren accepted him as a disciple? Hm... also, his face is very fair, and he's very shou ."</p>

    <p>There was a dead silence in the group for several seconds.</p>

    <p>Bulang Blade Immortal jumped out immediately. "Damn! So, the conditions for Ling Zhenren to accept a disciple is that they have to be very fair and shou ?"</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren couldn't help but mock. "What use is it to be very fair and shou these days? The most important thing is to freestyle!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>The group was chatting happily when "Nine Times in One Night" suddenly forwarded a post to the group. "Look at this post! I saw it in the 'Gossip World' section of the cultivation forum... it mentions Lord Diulei and Ling Zhenren."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at the link and was silent for a long time; for some reason, he had a bad feeling.</p>

    <p>This post had been uploaded half an hour ago.</p>

    <p>The poster's ID: Super High School Level Director...</p>

    <p>Just by looking at the name, Wang Ling already knew who the hell this guy was!</p>

    <p>The main topic of the post: Ahhh! Today, I actually saw Lord Diulei and the legendary Ling Zhenren in the flesh, they're two of the four seniors I like the most in the cultivation forum! I have finally fulfilled two of my four great life ambitions!</p>

    <p>Someone asked: If I may be so bold as to ask, what are your four great life ambitions?</p>

    <p>The poster's answer was:</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren's Little Punch (0/1)</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei's Bazahei <sup>2</sup> (1/1)</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>('Bazahei' is just a speech
interjection or exclamation,
and doesn't have any
meaning.)</dfn>

    <p>Immortal Toya's Heifengli <sup>3</sup> (0/1)</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(The literal translation of
heifengli is "black pineapple,"
but the Cantonese
pronunciation means "I like
you.")</dfn>

    <p>The last one...</p>

    <p>Ling Zhenren's Mwah Mwah <sup>4</sup> (1/1)</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>4</sup>(Yes, kiss kiss..)</dfn>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling decided to help forward this post. When there were over five hundred forwards, he would then directly report it for false reporting!</p>
