  <h1>Chapter 336 Ai, Wait! Don't Go Offline! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Of course, Wang Ling was just kidding; he naturally knew what a heavenly fissure was. Precious stones which contained heavenly fissures were also called heavenly fissure stones. According to ancient texts, they were produced from the cremation of a True Immortal after his death, similar to the sarira pearls left behind after eminent monks were cremated. Heavenly fissure stones contained immense latent spirit potential; as long as one knew how to use it, a person didn't have to be at True Immortal level to be able to directly create nomological laws with it!</p>

    <p>Heavenly fissure stones had been very rare since ancient times. Under normal circumstances, True Immortals in their final years of life usually wouldn't ask to be cremated and their ashes scattered in the ocean; True Immortals would usually think of a way to preserve their bodies in an auspicious and treasured place.</p>

    <p>As long as they managed to endure the Samsara Calamity, they could return to their bodies, and after another two thousand years, they could strike for the next realm.</p>

    <p>This was why under normal circumstances, True Immortals wouldn't choose to cremate their bodies and leave heavenly fissure stones behind.</p>

    <p>The most direct way of appraising a heavenly fissure stone was to use the Heavenly Eye and check how many black fissures there were inside it. Each fissure represented a nomological law produced by the stone's owner during their lifetime. The more heavenly fissures there were, the more valuable the heavenly fissure stone was. However, mere mortals weren't able to see such minute fissures; only those who cultivated their Heavenly Eye to a particular level would be able to do it.</p>

    <p>That was why Luo Chuang couldn't properly evaluate the jade even after examining it for so long; his Heavenly Eye was too weak, and even with all the appraisal magic treasures in his metalware store, he couldn't pick out heavenly fissures accurately.</p>

    <p>Whether this ancient jade was something that had been washed up in the cultivation antiques mart or was a legendary heavenly fissure stone, Wang Ling wouldn't be able to tell for certain without his Heavenly Eye.</p>

    <p>But if this was a genuine heavenly fissure stone, then Luo Chuang would have hit the jackpot.</p>

    <p>Holding the jade, Wang Ling opened his Heavenly Eye, and his pupils instantly blossomed into three golden petals each.</p>

    <p>Stunned, Luo Chuang could feel dense spirit energy pour out of the Heavenly Eye!</p>

    <p>This vision power penetrated the jade, and it was as Luo Chuang had said; Wang Ling discovered a black fissure inside it.</p>

    <p>Because of his vision power, Wang Ling could clearly see even the sawtooth pattern along the edges of the fissure. Suffused with the vision power, this long black fissure looked like a bottomless abyss when taken in all at once.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling narrowed his eyes; he felt that with his vision power, he could directly infiltrate further and search the depths of the fissure.</p>

    <p>In the next moment, the scene in front of him transformed into a blue sea and sky... he was actually on some unknown island!</p>

    <p>Was this a fantasy realm?</p>

    <p>Standing on the beach, Wang Ling felt the refreshing sea breeze caress his cheeks. He scooped up some sand, and as it ran through his fingers, he realized that this landscape was actually real.</p>

    <p>In that case, it probably wasn't a fantasy realm. Wang Ling guessed that it was likely his vision power which had triggered this hidden space inside the heavenly fissure.</p>

    <p>Vision power at the Soul Formation stage would never have been able to reach this space.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had the vague thought that someone had set the space up here deliberately.</p>

    <p>While he was puzzling over this, he suddenly heard a gust of strong wind behind him. Stepping to one side, he saw that it was actually a coconut that had flown at him.</p>

    <p><em>Dong </em>!</p>

    <p>It didn't smash into Wang Ling, and instead landed heavily in the sea with a mighty splash.</p>

    <p>Looking in the direction that the coconut had been thrown from, Wang Ling saw an old man in white approach him slowly, a coconut in one hand.</p>

    <p>"You could actually dodge this old man's secret weapon... looks like you're a formidable junior!" the old man exclaimed.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was taken aback. "..." So this coconut was a secret weapon? Were you kidding?! Why use a coconut? Even a piece of chalk was more reliable!</p>

    <p><em>Who are you? </em>Wang Ling gazed at the old man with narrowed eyes as he asked his question telepathically.</p>

    <p>The coconut old man looked at him. "My surname is Pang and my name is Guang..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "...Pang ...Guang <sup>1</sup> ?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>('Pang guang' translates to 'swollen bladder..')</dfn>

    <p>The coconut old man: "Don't be alarmed, I won't hurt you even though I'm a True Immortal."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>The coconut old man: "But even if I won't hurt you, you're too much!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "???"</p>

    <p>The coconut old man: "Can't you show a little more astonishment when I say that I'm a True Immortal?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Seeing that Wang Ling's poker face hadn't changed from beginning to end, the coconut old man sighed and simply gave up. "Ai, whatever. I don't feel like arguing with a rude junior like you... But you should rejoice; you're the first person to come here since I set up this secret space in the heavenly fissure."</p>

    <p>For some reason, Wang Ling didn't feel lucky at all when he heard this...</p>

    <p>After a moment of silence, the coconut old man looked at Wang Ling and suddenly asked, "Little brother, do you know about the Samsara Calamity?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling frowned.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, I just want to tell you about it." The coconut old man laughed lightly. "The Samsara Calamity is the only way for a True Immortal to break through to a higher realm. But since ancient times, there have been very few people who have succeeded. There are also various types of calamities. True Immortals who want to undergo the calamity preserve their bodies, and their souls enter the Reincarnation Gate to endure the torture of the Thunder Calamity. Once their souls pass through the Reincarnation Gate and successfully return to their bodies, the Samsara Calamity is almost complete. Those who successfully overcome the calamity gain another two thousand years of life, which paves the way for them to aim for Venerable Immortal level.</p>

    <p>"But few people know what the true essence of the Samsara Calamity is. With everyone going through the calamity, this old man chose the most difficult way. As long as I succeed here, I'll be able to directly transcend reincarnation and become a Venerable Immortal."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was suspicious but also a little curious.</p>

    <p>"Destroy in order to build — I deliberately incinerated my own body and entrusted someone with refining my soul and sealing it in this heavenly fissure. There will come a day when the fated person will appear in this heavenly fissure and who will set up nine thousand nine hundred and eighty-one statues, and recruit ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and eighty-one disciples on my behalf — that is when I will have passed through my Samsara Calamity!"</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, the coconut old man looked excited. He tossed the coconut aside and grasped Wang Ling's hands. "Little brother, you are that fated person!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>The coconut old man laughed loudly. "When I advance to Venerable Immortal level, you will be my inheriting disciple!"</p>

    <p>His expression full of distaste, Wang Ling pulled his hand back and sighed... Where had this idiot come from? What a real pain in the ass!</p>

    <p>The coconut old man fixed his burning gaze on Wang Ling. "If you don't agree, I won't let you out! You can cry until you grow hoarse, no one will come to save you!"</p>

    <p>However, he regretted the words as soon as he said them...</p>

    <p>Because he realized that Wang Ling's figure was gradually becoming transparent.</p>

    <p>What?! This was a space he had set up himself; how could a junior escape it so easily?</p>

    <p>He watched as Wang Ling turned transparent, and just before he disappeared, the old man let out a petrified shout. "Shit! Little... little brother, wait! Don't go offline! We have a lot of things to talk about! Listen to me..."</p>
