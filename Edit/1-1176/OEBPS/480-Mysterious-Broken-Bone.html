  <h1>Chapter 480 Mysterious Broken Bone </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Er Ha had initially planned to meet Wei Zhi elsewhere because it had been afraid of Marshal Jiang at the apartment. But from the old man's attitude toward it just now, Er Ha couldn't sense any malicious intent. In Marshal Jiang's heyday back then, who knew how many demon kings and demon gods he had turned into fried chicken cutlets... If the other party really had had evil intentions, Er Ha thought that it should have been able to sense it.</p>

    <p>From Marshal Jiang's attitude toward it now, Er Ha thought that maybe the other party was just curious about it.</p>

    <p>But even so, Er Ha still had to be careful and cautious in this matter.</p>

    <p>After all, Little Master Ling was now already on Marshal Jiang's radar, and Er Ha felt that it couldn't get its master involved no matter what.</p>

    <p>As the elevator went up, Er Ha had a focused expression on its face. It stared at Wei Zhi, who looked askance at it and smiled. From Er Ha's perspective, it looked a little like a leer, which made its green fur stand on end a little.</p>

    <p>"You've been thinking about it?" Er Ha asked as it stared at Wei Zhi.</p>

    <p>Honestly speaking, this was a little sudden because Er Ha hadn't at all expected Wei Zhi to prepare a gift for it. Although he and Wei Zhi got along pretty well, they had in fact only known each other for less than a week. Er Ha counted on its claws: including today, it was exactly seven days!</p>

    <p>"Not really, it's just that I happened to receive something that isn't useful to me, but will probably suit you."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi pulled at his hat out of habit and bared his teeth in a smile. "And today is a good day since it's also our anniversary."</p>

    <p>"What anniversary?" Er Ha asked blankly.</p>

    <p>"The seven-day anniversary of us joining hands to bring down the Demon Hunters Association! It's also the seventh day after the Demon Hunters Association's downfall!" Wei Zhi said excitedly.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>The elevator had arrived. Wei Zhi seemed particularly happy today and he sang as he walked out of the elevator: <em>I dreamt again last night the traditional opera singer got on stage in new clothes and sang the same old song <sup>1</sup> </em><em>...</em></p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(From the song 典狱司 "Dian Yu Si.")</dfn>

    <p>Er Ha suddenly realized that Wei Zhi actually sang pretty well: it had flavor and rhythm!</p>

    <p>The lyrics in the first half of the song were quite normal, but when it came to the chorus in the second half, the style suddenly changed: <em>That day you and I met and went undercover into the Demon Hunters Association... Do you remember, today is the first seventh day since the Demon Hunters Association!</em></p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..." What freaking seventh day!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It seemed that Wei Zhi had already prepared the gift in advance. The entire twenty-third floor was Wei Zhi's place. In order to transform it into an ecological environment suitable for the Pushing Large Butterfly, Wei Zhi had spent a lot of money remodeling the living room. But there were in fact a lot of other empty rooms. It wasn't that Wei Zhi didn't want to redo them but that money was really tight for him during this time.</p>

    <p>The gift for Er Ha was in one of the empty rooms, and Wei Zhi took it there.</p>

    <p>He pulled off the black cloth that had been covering the gift in the room. "Ta-da!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Then Er Ha saw a four-sided glass tank... and inside it was a large bone which was as thick as an adult man's arm and around 1.7 or 1.8 meters long!</p>

    <p>The joints on the ends of the bone were jagged, and it looked like it had been broken off with tremendous force.</p>

    <p>It turned out Wei Zhi wanted to give it a bone!</p>

    <p>This made complete sense and Er Ha didn't think it was the least bit strange.</p>

    <p>Given that Wei Zhi didn't know its true identity, it would actually be weird if he gave Er Ha flies...</p>

    <p>"Well, Brother Dog, do you like it?" Wei Zhi's eyes crinkled as he smiled at Er Ha. He felt that this dog's response to a bone seemed a little indifferent, but he paid it no mind because it showed precisely that Er Ha was unusual.</p>

    <p>If a regular spirit dog saw such a big bone, its eyes would already have long been glued to it!</p>

    <p>"Mm... not a bad gift..."</p>

    <p>This gift actually wasn't worth much to Er Ha, so it wasn't very excited, but this was Wei Zhi's good intentions after all. Thus, Er Ha swiftly reviewed the three hundred poems and the dictionary of idioms it had memorized while it had been learning Chinese characters - but in that moment, it abruptly realized that it actually had nothing to say!</p>

    <p>If Er Ha had known earlier, it would have looked for several spirit dogs as an experiment and observed their reactions when they saw a bone... Now that it was already a dog, Er Ha thought that it should put its heart and soul into this role. Even if it didn't like bones, it should at least act as if it did!</p>

    <p>It thought that Wei Zhi might feel very disappointed at its reaction.</p>

    <p>Sighing in its heart, Er Ha walked over to the glass tank.</p>

    <p>But speaking of which, it thought that this bone was a little too big and looked like the spirit bone of some colossal spirit beast.</p>

    <p>Er Ha was about to draw closer to examine it, but suddenly it smelled blood on the bone!</p>

    <p>The smell was very light; Er Ha was only able to smell it at close range, and even then, it was with its face pressed against the tank!</p>

    <p>Furthermore, Er Ha was familiar with this smell of blood on the bone!</p>

    <p>This was... holy beast blood?</p>

    <p>Er Ha was startled; it hadn't expected this to actually be the bone of a holy beast.</p>

    <p>Judging from the blood qi on the bone, Er Ha believed that this bone wasn't very old, and was from roughly two hundred years ago. Two hundred years was more or less the amount of time it would take for the blood qi to dissipate to this extent, but for holy beasts who had long life spans, two hundred years was a mere flash to them.</p>

    <p>And from how shiny the bone was, it was obvious that someone had carefully washed it clean.</p>

    <p>A holy beast bone which actually wasn't very old...</p>

    <p>Apart from Xiao Yin, were there really other holy beasts still alive in this world?</p>

    <p>Er Ha began to ponder.</p>

    <p>Seeing Er Ha's entranced expression, Wei Zhi didn't bother it. He thought that this Brother Dog was really pretty awesome. A regular dog already wouldn't have been able to stand it when it saw this bone, but Brother Dog actually looked like it was reflecting on its dog life...</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi thought that this was probably the difference between other dogs and Er Ha.</p>

    <p>Where those dogs would have been unable to help becoming fixated, itching to pounce on and gnaw on the bone, Brother Dog still retained an aloof and thoughtful manner... this was too rare!</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi believed that Er Ha's spiritual intelligence had already developed to a very high level and might even surpass that of first class spirit beasts who were rumored to be able to take human form.</p>

    <p>"Where did you get this bone from?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha turned to ask Wei Zhi a moment later as it tried to hold back its astonishment.</p>

    <p>Cupping his chin, Wei Zhi thought for a moment before explaining, "This is actually from the collection of the vice president of our Pet Trainers Guild. It seems that the vice president picked it up on his travels in the past. Except for the jagged joints, the bone actually looks very nice, like a crystal. Our vice president was curious, so he kept it... until recently, when he lost it to me in 'Fight the Landlord <sup>2</sup> '!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Fight the Landlord )'Dou Di Zhu') is a Chinese card game.)</dfn>

    <p>Er Ha was stunned. "..." What kind of operation was this?</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "Oh, by the way, the vice president actually gave this bone a name. It's called Bone King <sup>3</sup> ."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(This refers to Ainz Ooal Gown, the main protagonist of the 'Overlord' series who looks like a skeleton devoid of skin and flesh ..)</dfn>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>
