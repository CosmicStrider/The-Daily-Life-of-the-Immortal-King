  <h1>Chapter 395 Immortal's Treasure House </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Eyes fixed on the jade scroll, Er Ha felt extremely shaken.</p>

    <p>It had actually made a lot of guesses about the blueprint, but had never expected it to be of the first Gate Between Worlds; even more unbelievable was that it had actually been personally built by a human Almighty.</p>

    <p>This was a door which connected the two worlds together. Since it was something that had been created, it should probably be classified as a magic treasure. But it was very obvious that the Gate Between Worlds couldn't be considered just any ordinary magic treasure.</p>

    <p>Strictly speaking, the Gate Between Worlds had already completely surpassed the level of a first-rate holy weapon and was a man-made, world-class magic weapon!</p>

    <p>There were in fact written accounts of world-class magic weapons in the current known history of cultivation. These were the magic weapons that cultivators had been able to ultimately create solely through their own strength. They were also the only weapons created by cultivators that could contend against the "divine weapon magic treasures" created by nature, and were called "world-defying magic weapons" in short.</p>

    <p>In the face of these world-defying magic weapons, first-rate holy weapons were nothing but scrap metal; they couldn't withstand continuous attacks from spirit power, and would just shatter like glass as soon as they were taken out.</p>

    <p>Er Ha had thought that it was just a legend that human cultivators were able to create world-defying magic weapons... Because even the top demon gods had been unable to make them.</p>

    <p>This was because creating a world-defying magic weapon required the power of a particular kind of world, and it was nothing like the small worlds in ordinary magic weapons. Take the Purple Gold Gourd for example; it could already be considered a first-rate holy weapon, but the small world inside it still couldn't compare with the world inside a world-defying magic weapon.</p>

    <p>In Taoist Guang's words, the vision was too small.</p>

    <p>According to historical texts, forging a world-defying magic weapon thus necessitated the creation of a great world as its foundation. One great world was equal to ninety-nine small worlds, but for a genuine world-defying magic weapon to be called as such, it required ninety-nine great worlds at least.</p>

    <p>But Er Ha felt that the truly frightening part of all this was the person who had been able to create a world-defying magic weapon.</p>

    <p>If Immortal Zhenyuan had really created the Gate Between Worlds, then he was simply a monster!</p>

    <p>"Brother Dog, you should now know how much this scroll is worth," Taoist Guang said as he looked at Er Ha.</p>

    <p>Er Ha naturally understood his meaning; this scroll was no longer simply a blueprint of the Gate Between Worlds, but of a world-defying magic weapon!</p>

    <p>A blueprint was quite an important part in forging a magic weapon. Theoretically speaking, a magic weapon which was produced based on a blueprint couldn't be considered a fake.</p>

    <p>Those imitation magic treasures on the market only resembled them in appearance; they didn't have cores at all.</p>

    <p>This blueprint was of a magic weapon core.</p>

    <p>The significance of the scroll in Taoist Guang's hand was too much!</p>

    <p>If it was taken out and studied, it might overturn the world and stir up great waves, maybe even cause bloody wars...</p>

    <p>At that moment, Er Ha's heart trembled as it instinctively felt fear. This was something even demon gods couldn't touch; even if Er Ha had been at its peak, it was still just a demon king, on par with a human Soul Formation cultivator.</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang couldn't help breaking into laughter when he saw this green-furred dog's expression. "Brother Dog, you don't have to give me a reply right away; you can think about it. This isn't just a deal between you and me, but also with the senior outside."</p>

    <p>Although he was smiling, the seriousness in his words was plain to see.</p>

    <p>Er Ha suddenly understood a little now the reason why Taoist Guang had said earlier that he had wanted to keep this thing sealed forever with him; it was indeed too weighty.</p>

    <p>If news of it got out, war between nations wasn't impossible.</p>

    <p>But to Taoist Guang, none of this mattered at all</p>

    <p>The most important thing to him was rebirth and freedom.</p>

    <p>He sighed. "I've already waited so many years; a little more is nothing. To leave this space, I have to pass through the Samsara Spirit Tribulation. Unfortunately, when all is said and done, I tried to take a side route, and I'm missing one piece in my plan."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "So senior's meaning is...?"</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang: "I have a feeling that the senior outside definitely has a way; no matter what method he uses, as long as he lends me a hand, I'm willing to tell him a great secret."</p>

    <p>Er Ha was curious. "About what?"</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang's expression lit up. "The Immortal's Treasure House! This is the great world which Immortal Zhenyuan established back then. It contains all of his riches, and I know where the entrance is."</p>

    <p>Er Ha was gobsmacked once again. "By any chance, did senior find this blueprint at the Immortal Treasure House?"</p>

    <p>"No..."</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang shook his head. "I was lucky to have bumped into him before... although I didn't see his face, I can probably confirm it was him."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Rumor is that Immortal Zhenyuan travels around the world and no one knows his whereabouts, so how can senior be sure?"</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang spoke slowly, "About a thousand years ago, I was part of a special price tour for Foundation Establishment cultivators traveling to Snow Village. I wanted to go and appreciate the meaning of Dao in nature; I hadn't reached the True Immortal realm back then, and I was impatient to do so. Moreover, in order to join the tour party, I sealed my acupuncture points to fix my realm at the Foundation Establishment stage before I went out."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Special price tour..."</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang: "Mm, food, accommodation and a tour guide were all included, all for just one immortal gold bar."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>"After we got on the tour bus, the guide gave each of us an immortal snow rice cake and said that it was a specialty of Snow Village."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "And then..."</p>

    <p>"And then, there was nothing after that. The bus drove us to the Snow Village public toilets, because all of us had diarrhea."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>"Do you know what was the most terrifying thing in all this?" Taoist Guang's expression revealed a trace of lingering fear when he said this.</p>

    <p>"This old man... didn't bring any toilet paper!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"A potent spirit grass laxative had been mixed into this immortal snow rice cake. Without an antidote, we would continue to have diarrhea, and without toilet paper to wipe ourselves clean, it was unbearably itchy.</p>

    <p>"Then, the tour guide threatened us - if we wanted toilet paper and the antidote, each of us had to give him two thousand immortal gold bars, otherwise he would ditch us there. That was true suffering for this old man back then..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "So, senior gave in?"</p>

    <p>"No way!"</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang hmphed. "If I hadn't sealed my realm so that I could only exert strength at the Foundation Establishment level, I could have killed that dishonest tour guide with one blow of air from my mouth!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "In the end, what happened?"</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang: "Back then, I'd rather die than give in, so the tour guide left me behind. Luckily, I had a detoxifying spirit drug on me. Even though it couldn't completely cure my condition, at the very least it staved off my persistent diarrhea. However, I was still badly in need of toilet paper..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>"It was at that point in time that my luck changed. An old brother in the next cubicle passed me a roll of toilet paper..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "But what does this have to do with the blueprint of the Gate Between Worlds?"</p>

    <p>Taoist Guang: "That toilet paper is this jade scroll that you're looking at now..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "What the hell..."</p>
