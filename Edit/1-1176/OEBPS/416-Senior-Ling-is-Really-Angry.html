  <h1>Chapter 416 Senior Ling is Really Angry! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't think that Dharmaraja had been careless enough to include him in this chat group; instead, this was probably the effect of his Great Fortune Spell. Actually, this was a farce that Wang Ling wasn't bothered to become involved in. Sending the six kitchen knives had just been a cheeky move on his part... playing this bit of mischief had been really fun!</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling wasn't angry at all. In addition to the upcoming midterm exams, he had to focus on the sports meet as well as look for the Immortal's Treasure House; he wasn't interested in paying any attention to this farce at all.</p>

    <p>After gazing at the phone for about ten seconds, Wang Ling saw Lightning Dharmaraja send a short video to the chat group.</p>

    <p>It was an apology video he had just recorded.</p>

    <p>In the video, he came running from afar, then suddenly jumped high in the air to perform a nine hundred and sixty-degree backward twist before finally landing on the ground on his knees and kowtowing... the moment his forehead smashed the hard ground, it created a round indent!</p>

    <p>In front of their screens, everyone couldn't help sucking air through their teeth.</p>

    <p>This apology was a little too imaginative!</p>

    <p>Fang Xing: "Dharmaraja's iron head<sup>1</sup>..."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This can have two meanings: someone who is hard-headed, and also the other crude implication ..)</dfn>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren: "Dharmaraja's iron head..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya heaved a sigh. "Ai, if you had apologized to Ling Zhenren earlier, none of this would have been necessary."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt a little apologetic when he watched the video. Actually, he hadn't taken what Dharmaraja had done to heart at all, but in the end, he had frightened him by cheekily sending those six kitchen knives.</p>

    <p>Maybe he should clarify the situation.</p>

    <p>Thinking this, he started typing in the group chat to explain that he wasn't angry. But for some reason, while he was halfway typing, the screen suddenly froze... Then, he discovered that he had dropped out of the chat.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "???"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming had personally designed this watch, and it was equipped with cutting-edge technology, so rationally speaking, there was absolutely no way it could get stuck like this. So Wang Ling very quickly guessed that this yet again was most likely the ongoing effect of the Great Fortune Spell.</p>

    <p>As he had said before, the reason he didn't like this spell was because once it was activated, it would create a system of checks and balances. Put simply, when it came to a particular matter, a person's extreme good luck would mean someone else's extreme bad luck.</p>

    <p>This was the law of balance in nature, which also applied to the Three Thousand Great Spells.</p>

    <p>Everything was fated to begin with...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the gossip chat room.</p>

    <p>System: Ling Zhenren has left the group chat.</p>

    <p>On the other side, after seeing this system notification, Dharmaraja directly collapsed.</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja: "Le... left?"</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren: "Dharmaraja, I wish you well."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "This was your fault to begin with, you shouldn't have kept it from Senior Ling. Given his personality, even if he were to know about this, he wouldn't have said anything. Excluding him from the group chat was firstly very rude, and secondly, shows that you don't trust him."</p>

    <p>Staring at Immortal Toya's analysis on the screen, Dharmaraja felt like his life had fallen into darkness... It was all over, Senior Ling was really angry now!</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja: "What should I do now..."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing smiled slightly. "Senior Dharmaraja, there's no need to be so nervous. Why not try dropping by his place to apologize? But actually, I don't think it's necessary. Given Ling Zhenren's realm, he's above being controlled by his moods, and he won't get angry so easily over some petty thing. Actually, his hand may have slipped and he may have left the group chat by accident."</p>

    <p>The corners of Dharmaraja's lips twitched. "Brother Fang, don't comfort me. I've decided it's better to apologize to Ling Zhenren face to face."</p>

    <p>Hand slipped? And left the group chat? Who would buy that?!</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja cried helplessly in his heart. He had had a stroke of bad luck this time; Ling Zhenren leaving the group chat by accident was too absurd!</p>

    <p>Now Dharmaraja was faced with a very significant problem, and that was to present a gift.</p>

    <p>He couldn't show up to give an apology with empty hands.</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja: "Does anyone know what Ling Zhenren likes, or if there's something that he needs?"</p>

    <p>To be honest, Dharmaraja felt this question was especially ridiculous... it made him feel like an idiot!</p>

    <p>At Senior Ling's realm, why would this type of BOSS level senior need anything?!</p>

    <p>Money? Probably not, right? A senior at that realm surely had his own treasure trove with countless riches!</p>

    <p>Magic treasures? Dharmaraja felt that none of his magic treasures could even rival a transformed toothpick... it was likely Senior Ling would turn his nose up at them. Don't tell him he would have to give his ancestral holy relic, the "godly thunder inheritance," to Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>In fact, if Wang Ling told people that he didn't have money since Father Wang used all kinds of excuses daily to dock his allowance, no one would believe him at all...</p>

    <p>Father Wang and Mother Wang had instilled in Wang Ling from a young age the virtue of being frugal. It allowed him to keep a low profile and helped shape proper values.</p>

    <p>Boys... they should only spend when necessary; it was enough to give them a bit of an allowance for them to learn how to manage their finances. Too much would foster a bad habit of wasting money, which people would truly take notice of.</p>

    <p>Since the beginning, Father Wang and Mother Wang had always looked down on those rich second generation kids in the cultivation circle who strutted around flaunting their family background, like Lin Sicong. He was often in the top searches online; even when he lost this dog, everyone knew about it and made a ruckus.</p>

    <p>After Dharmaraja asked this question, the chat group fell silent for a long time.</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling's interests and hobbies were already no longer a secret to most of the people in the chat group - the problem was that Dharmaraja actually didn't seem to know, which was very strange!</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren: "Dharmaraja, your observation skills are really terrible! Even if this thing hadn't happened today, you would offend Ling Zhenren in the future anyway! Think carefully, what thing usually causes Ling Zhenren's expression to change when he sees it?"</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja: "What do you mean?"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya really couldn't help sighing. "Ask Brother Fang Xing for help; his family makes this thing."</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja seemed to have figured it out; he knew that Fang Xing's family ran a noodles shop.</p>

    <p>That was to say, Ling Zhenren liked to eat noodles?</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja: "Thanks for the tips, everyone! I got it! But there are so many types of this thing, which one should I get?"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "The normal flavor is fine..."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing: "If Senior Dharmaraja doesn't mind, please drop by my family's noodles shop when you have the time, and I'll have it prepared for you."</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja: "That wouldn't be very good, right? If I take it to Ling Zhenren's place from your family's noodles shop, it might become all mushy on the way there..."</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren: "???"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "???"</p>

    <p>Fang Xing: "Senior Dharmaraja, why do I always feel that you're not on the same wavelength as the rest of us?"</p>

    <p>"Aren't we? It's noodles, right?"</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja now understood. "By the way, is it fried sauce noodles or beef noodles?"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..." There was no teaching dumbasses!</p>
