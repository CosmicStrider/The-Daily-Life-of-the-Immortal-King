  <h1>Chapter 214 My Contemporaries Make Me Look Evil in Contrast </h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was still June 14th and it was already five o'clock in the evening.</p>

    <p>From arriving at the military training base to applying for military supplies and then to filling in the handbook, today's activities didn't seem so packed, which actually made many students think that the military training this time wouldn't be as tough as they'd imagined; as long as they got a good ranking for their schools during this survival drill, that should be fine.</p>

    <p>In the dorm, the students of Number 59 High School and Number 60 High School had been housed in the same section. Some were consulting each other on battle tactics while others were chatting idly. The overall atmosphere was very relaxed.</p>

    <p>At about half past five, Lao Gudong came to the rooms to check that all the students in the dorm were accounted for and make sure that none of them had been overlooked outside the dorm. Furthermore, he gave each person something: an electronic illustrated handbook the size of a person's palm.</p>

    <p>But he didn't explain what it was for, and went off with a <em>latiao</em> stuck in his mouth.</p>

    <p>After studying it for a while, Chen Chao still hadn't figured it out.</p>

    <p>"Second brother, do you know what this is?" he asked.</p>

    <p>Hands folded behind his head, Wang Ming's chair was tilted as he leaned back against the wall, his two long, straight legs crossed on the desk. He raised his eyes to give it an idle look, then promptly replied, "Isn't it an electronic illustrated handbook? General Yi had gotten so many magic treasures produced en masse this time, so there are bound to be some that you wouldn't know how to use. This illustrated handbook will probably prove very convenient once we enter the map."</p>

    <p>Saying this, Wang Ming smiled faintly. "Furthermore, this is probably something only our Number 60 High School and Number 59 High School have. The other four schools wouldn't have gotten it. The combined number of students from our two schools is just eight hundred in total, while the other four schools together have over nine thousand students. The numbers are simply not equal. This is most likely a handicap which the headmasters of the six schools devised after discussing it among themselves."</p>

    <p>The people in the dorm raised their heads, eyes instantly lighting up. There was even this type of operation?</p>

    <p>"But can we really bring this thing in? I heard that after entering the magic array, it will by default block anything that's in storage space on the body, and won't allow magic treasures to be brought into the map," said Su Xiao.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming narrowed his eyes and smiled. "It's fine, the array has already been set up, so this electronic illustrated handbook isn't part of its filter scope."</p>

    <p>At this moment, even Guo Hao had no choice but to admire how knowledgeable this second brother Wang Ming was. Even he, the gossip expert, hadn't known this matter, but this second brother had actually known of it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>What rubbish, it was Wang Ming who had drawn out the blueprint for this magic array; it would be odd if this guy didn't know about it!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Time flew by, and it was close to 5:55 pm when the two Wang family brothers opened their eyes at the same time.</p>

    <p>They could both sense that the magic array outside the dormitory building was in the start-up phase.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling secretly opened his Heavenly Eye, and noticed that this round array wasn't just any ordinary size, it was massive; it included almost all the dormitory buildings on the military training base. Furthermore, the array's structure was complicated and mutable; even first-class array masters wouldn't have been able to set up this array under six months.</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ming had started drawing up the plans two years ago. Though he didn't have spirit energy, he had played a key role in deploying the advanced mathematical operations and various complex formulas required to design the magic array.</p>

    <p>It was such a large array; using the Heavenly Eye to do a simple sweep of it, Wang Ling could already see a mix of several hundred thousand formula designs. Only the strongest brain could have done this; a regular person really wouldn't have been able to take it.</p>

    <p>This magic array was linked to a small world that had been created by an Almighty cultivator. Judging from the array's structure alone, Wang Ling knew that time flowed at a different pace in the small world compared with outside.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming got up and stood by the window as he looked at the faint glimmer of light outside. It looked a little like the light of an incandescent lamp, but actually, it was the light emitted during the operation phase of the array. He mentally calculated that the array would be completely activated in three minutes.</p>

    <p>Taking a deep breath, Wang Ming checked the people in the dorm and noticed that Guo Hao had disappeared. He pointed to Guo Hao's bed. "Where is he? "</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "Guo Hao said he had a stomachache, so he went to the toilet."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, a dark space tunnel opened on the top of the dormitory building. Two hands stretched out of the tunnel to push its edges apart, and a figure struggled its way out.</p>

    <p>"Finally, we made it."</p>

    <p>Using Jiang Liuyue's body, the old devil had arrived.</p>

    <p>In the stone ghost mask, Jiang Liuyue sensed the massive magic array around the dormitory building and was a little surprised. "This array is truly a masterpiece; an Almighty had to have been involved, otherwise there is no way this could have been set up. Furthermore, I can faintly sense that there are experts in the vicinity; the headmasters of the six schools and the Secretary of the Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools have gathered here. Senior, are you sure about this?"</p>

    <p>"My venerable self heard that one of the six school headmasters is Patriarch Reliance? Given my present state, apart from Patriarch Reliance and the old Secretary... I don't have to worry about the others." The old devil let out a <em>hmph</em> . "My last two defeats were because my venerable self had underestimated that junior called Killer Taoist. As long as that junior doesn't show up to upset things, there's nothing to be worried about."</p>

    <p>"That man seems to be connected to the cultivation forum." Jiang Liuyue smiled bitterly in the stone ghost mask. "The last few times this person appeared was because our matter involved the cultivation forum's Great Death-Courting Senior. Senior shouldn't need to be so apprehensive today."</p>

    <p>"That's right."</p>

    <p>The old devil nodded, and with a flash of spirit light, a blue flag appeared in his hand.</p>

    <p>An array-guiding flag?</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue was amazed in her heart. The array-guiding flag was a very practical magic treasure which could move a pre-existing magic array's location to a completely different one in an instant.</p>

    <p>But she had also heard that in the past, an unlawful person had used this flag and triggered a huge catastrophe. Therefore, as early as one thousand years ago, the array-guiding flags on the market had all disappeared. Worst of all, they weren't sold even in the black market or auction houses!</p>

    <p>It had to be said that the old devil was in the end the old devil. There were few people who could wield so many ancient treasures.</p>

    <p>"My venerable self has already set up an array in my small world to connect to the Gate Between Worlds."</p>

    <p>Holding the array-guiding flag, the old devil sneered. "When my venerable self sneaks in alongside the students into the small world where the drill will be held, I'll use the array-guiding flag to open the Gate Between Worlds in that small world undetected. Then my venerable self will take advantage of this opportunity to absorb the vitality of thousands of students, thereby entering this world once again."</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, the old devil chuckled. "Do you know why my venerable self was labeled the first devil in history?"</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue: "Why?"</p>

    <p>"Because there was no one else as vicious as me."</p>

    <p>The old devil said, "The reason why my venerable self can cause panic among the masses is because my contemporaries weren't as wicked, so they made me look evil in contrast."</p>

    <p>Jiang Liuyue: "..."</p>
