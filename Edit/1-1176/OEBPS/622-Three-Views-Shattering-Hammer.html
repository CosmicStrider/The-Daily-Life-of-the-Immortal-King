  <h1>Chapter 622 Three Views-Shattering Hammer</h1>

  <div>

    <p>If the origin of this primordial qi was the prehistoric vicious beasts bred by that mysterious angler, that meant that this angler had once released this beast on Drought Star. Given the current situation, Immortal Zhenyuan, who was repairing Drought Star at the moment, might be in danger.</p>

    <p>Both Wang Ling and Er Ha thought of this point at the same time. They couldn't help furrowing their brows and cupping their chins as they pondered.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming didn't know what these two guys were thinking about, but thought that this was an amusing scene.</p>

    <p>It was said that a dog which had been raised for a while would start to behave like its owner.</p>

    <p>It was obvious that Er Ha and Wang Ling's master and servant relationship had already reached a deep level of mutual understanding.</p>

    <p>Their expressions and actions were the same even when they were thinking!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling gave a heartfelt sigh. "Lingzi, your family's Er Ha is starting to be more and more like you!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ming didn't dare stay for too long, since the satellite remote projection technology wasn't advanced enough yet. Also, this technology hadn't been completely made public; the reason Wang Ming could use it was because he had the patent card for it, that is, an authority card - there were times when you could indeed do whatever you wanted when you had authority.</p>

    <p>But when all was said and done, this wasn't quite a compliant operation. With so many people watching him closely in the lab recently, he didn't really want to cause Old Qi any trouble. So each time Wang Ming used the projection technology to remotely project his image, he didn't dare stay away for too long. That was because Zhai Yin was monitoring him... if he was caught, he would definitely be reported.</p>

    <p>He realized that Zhai Yin was actually the type of person to hold a grudge; all this time, she still remembered how he refused to eat her pork chops.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming had initially thought that their relationship had improved a little. But since the last time when Old Qi had been sent to the hospital and Zhai Yin hadn't been allowed to cook in the lab anymore, she had grown colder toward Wang Ming by the day... He didn't need to be able to sense auras; as long as he suddenly felt a chill, Zhai Yin would definitely be nearby in a ten-meter range.</p>

    <p>Although he was unwilling to admit it, he had to concede that he was a little affected by Zhai Yin.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was resigned to the fact that his mind, while able to decrypt highly complex equations in a flash, just couldn't make sense of emotions... the worst was when he wound up in a cold war with other people.</p>

    <p>He remembered arguing with Wang Ling as a child, and how Wang Ling liked to give him the cold shoulder. Wang Ming recalled that each time, he was the one who swallowed his pride first and apologized. For one thing, he hated the silent treatment. For another thing, he thought that in any case, he was the older brother, so it didn't hurt to give way to his younger brother after calming down.</p>

    <p>But the problem now was that it was Zhai Yin who was giving him the cold shoulder, and he suddenly felt at a loss.</p>

    <p>How should he handle this?</p>

    <p>Apologize?</p>

    <p>But the problem was that he didn't think he had done anything wrong.</p>

    <p>Before Wang Ming left, Er Ha noticed his vexed expression and looked at him. "Did you quarrel with Miss Zhai?"</p>

    <p>"No..." Wang Ming waved his hands; he actually didn't know if this could be considered a quarrel or not. She stuck very close to him to protect him, but she was clearly in much lower spirits than she used to be.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming sighed and spread his hands. "Ever since Old Qi banned her from cooking, she started to give me the cold shoulder... I don't know why, since I haven't offended her."</p>

    <p>"How long has it been?"</p>

    <p>"Almost a week..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha thought a bit. "Think carefully, could it have been some small thing you did to offend her?"</p>

    <p>"How would I dare?"</p>

    <p>Aggrieved, Wang Ming looked at Er Ha with a serious expression. "Also, let me tell you, I even consoled her."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Wang Ming was taken aback. This dumbass straight guy could actually comfort someone?</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "... How did you console her?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "I had her drink a lot of warm water <sup>1</sup> ."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Based on the joke that any physical discomfort a girl feels can be fixed by drinking warm water, and turned into a meme in which a boyfriend's approach to resolving any type of conflict with his girlfriend is to give her warm water to drink..)</dfn>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Taking into consideration the fact that Immortal Zhenyuan might be in danger, Wang Ling and Er Ha discussed countermeasures that night. They couldn't be one hundred percent sure that the primordial qi was from a prehistoric vicious beast that was being raised by the mysterious angler.</p>

    <p>However, it made sense to take preventive action, and Wang Ling felt that he should set up basic safety measures for Immortal Zhenyuan.</p>

    <p>Once again, he opened the <em>Eight Classes of Divine Weapons </em>. This was the only original copy in the world, and which had been a gift from Father Wang's "strongest fan." Last time, Wang Ling had refined a pile of Soul Suppression Rings and had unexpectedly created one of rare world-defying quality.</p>

    <p>Taking into account how dangerous those prehistoric beasts which the angler kept were, if Wang Ling was going to forge a magic weapon for Immortal Zhenyuan, then his first choice was one that was fiercer than these dangerous prehistoric beasts.</p>

    <p>Thus, Wang Ling's gaze finally settled on a hammer-type magic weapon. This magic weapon was very unusual; it wasn't meant for long-term use and there was a limit to the number of times it could be used. In comparison, the Soul Suppression Ring which he had previously given to Thunder was a permanent magic weapon.</p>

    <p>Generally speaking, this type of magic weapon could store energy, and spirit energy could be accumulated inside it. Once there was a need for it, the spirit energy could be released in one go, creating an explosive effect.</p>

    <p>Er Ha's eyes lit up with understanding.</p>

    <p>To explain it in simpler terms, this type of magic treasure could be viewed as a trump card.</p>

    <p>"What's this hammer's origin?" Er Ha couldn't help asking.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling crooked his finger and the page flipped over, and one man and one dog looked at the information on this hammer-type magic weapon.</p>

    <p><em>Name of Magic Weapon: Three Views-Shattering Hammer</em></p>

    <p><em>Main Material: Passion Iron</em></p>

    <p><em>Maker: A stinky and shameless damn fatty with the surname Luo who knows nothing about iron</em></p>

    <p><em>Maker's Description: Life doesn't stop, courting death without end; perhaps this isn't the most perfect magic weapon, but it contains all my passion as Luo Chuang.</em></p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Passion iron?</p>

    <p>What was that...</p>

    <p>Looking it up on its phone, Er Ha discovered that the grade of this passion iron wasn't low, and even surpassed that of the magnetic stone which Lord Diulei had brought previously.</p>

    <p>Although passion iron still existed, it was very hard to obtain and was probably only sold on some cultivation black market. But the problem was... where was Little Master Ling going to get the money?</p>

    <p>"Where can we get a passion stone?" Er Ha was baffled.</p>

    <p>Without saying a word, Wang Ling used spirit energy to directly draw a smooth and round magic array on the floor with golden lines.</p>

    <p>When this magic array took shape, Er Ha stared closely at it. "This is..." It felt like it had seen this array somewhere before.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling spoke telepathically. "It's a transmutation array."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "Equivalent exchange is the invariant principle which underlies alchemy."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>After saying that, Wang Ling opened the drawer and took out the "Three Five" which he had already done before throwing it into the array.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>
