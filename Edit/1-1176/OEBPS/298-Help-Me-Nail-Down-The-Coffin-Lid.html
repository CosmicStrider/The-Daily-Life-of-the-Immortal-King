  <h1>Chapter 298 Help Me Nail Down The Coffin Lid!<sup>0</sup> </h1>

  <div>
  
    <dfn><sup>0</sup>(This is derived from a phrase 'the coffin lid can't be closed anymore,' and describes how a person can't be stopped after being provoked.)</dfn>
    
    <p>Wang Ling remembered it had been dusk when they had passed through the spatial wall into the mirror space created by the Ice Crystal Array. At that moment, it had completely turned to night.</p>

    <p>When they had arrived at the flat top on Yuntai Pavilion, Wang Ling had sensed quite a number of auras released in battle, all except for Fang Xing's.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei waved his hands. "I've been with Brother Ling all this time. When Dharmaraja and Luo Chuang came together earlier, I had assumed Brother Fang Xing would be with them. But until now, I haven't sensed Brother Fang Xing anywhere."</p>

    <p>"I met Toya on the road and before then I hadn't seen anyone," Cailian Zhenren said.</p>

    <p>"What are you trying to say?" Lord Diulei was a little suspicious.</p>

    <p>"It's like this; I saw someone earlier who looked a lot like Brother Fang Xing, but I didn't dare confirm whether it was him or not." Cailian Zhenren frowned deeply.</p>

    <p>"Why was that?"</p>

    <p>"I just felt that this person's aura was completely different. Brother Fang Xing's aura is as vibrant as Ling Zhenren's, but when I approached that person from behind, it felt like a freezing wind in my bones." Cailian Zhenren revealed her misgivings. "Perhaps I saw wrong?"</p>

    <p>"What was he doing when you saw him?"</p>

    <p>"He was headed for a heavenly palace called Linglang Pavilion."</p>

    <p>"Linglang Pavilion?" The silver unicorn on the ground was very familiar with the name, and it immediately said seriously, "If he is your friend, I suggest you hurry and go save him — Linglang Pavilion is the palace of Immortal Mansion's three great key elders. Apart from Justice Elder Purple Moon who has fallen here, there are three other elders, and they are all hard to deal with."</p>

    <p>"Can you tell us more?"</p>

    <p>The silver unicorn: "Of these three elders, one is called Summer Rain, one is Summer Snow and one is Summer Ice. The female disciples of Immortal Mansion call them the Three Daughters of Summer."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling already couldn't help the urge to ridicule these names. "..." If they had one more called Summer East Sea, then it would really be balanced out <sup>1</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Xia Donghai, or 'Summer East Sea,' is the name of the father in the Chinese sitcom 'Home With Kids.' His kids are called Xia Xue (Summer Snow) and Xia Yu (Summer Rain) ..)</dfn>

    <p>But Wang Ling did nothing to interrupt the silver unicorn as it continued, "These three are far more powerful than Justice Elder Purple Moon and they are most proficient at using the Great Spirit-Absorbing Skill; in battle, they can draw out their opponent's spirit energy unceasingly. Of course, in my eyes, they're only three girls. They're just small fry, so I don't know much about them."</p>

    <p>What the silver unicorn said wasn't wrong. As a holy beast that was still alive on earth, it was roughly eight thousand years old, after all. The three elders aside, it wouldn't be too much for most of the people here to call it grandpa.</p>

    <p>When it said that, it looked at the faces which Lord Diulei and the others were wearing, and realized that what it had said just now was ambiguous, so it quickly corrected itself. "Of course, I know that for human cultivators, strength comes first. Since I already regard Guru Ling as my master, I'm naturally just a baby in your care."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "..."</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja: "..."</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren: "..."</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>This was truly their first time seeing an eight thousand-year-old baby!</p>

    <p>The silver unicorn felt that selling meng like this didn't quite suit it, so it didn't dare say any more, and just lowered its head. "So, please look after me from now on..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At that very moment, another battle was in fact happening in Linglang Pavilion.</p>

    <p>The three elders of Linglang Pavilion gasped for breath, their faces twisted as they stared at the long-legged youngster in track clothes in front of them.</p>

    <p>About half an hour ago, this youngster had come here and without saying a word, had directly pulled them into an intrinsic spirit field.</p>

    <p>They were all at peak middle-stage Itinerant Immortal level, so their source of spirit energy could already be considered fairly immense. But even if they pooled their spirit energy together, there was no way for them to establish an intrinsic spirit field. For a single person to rely on the source of their spirit energy alone to set up an intrinsic spirit field, they had to be at True Immortal level, otherwise it was absolutely impossible!</p>

    <p>Hence, the three elders now could only be described as dumbfounded when they were caught in the intrinsic spirit field.</p>

    <p>What stunned them the most was that this youngster's intrinsic spirit field was actually a universal space in which he could control gravity freely and hamper their movements. Furthermore, their Great Spirit-Absorbing Skill only worked when they were close to the enemy, so it was utterly useless in the intrinsic spirit field.</p>

    <p>"It's over."</p>

    <p>Under a sky full of stars in the intrinsic spirit field, the youngster in a pair of blue and white striped track pants smiled at the three elders.</p>

    <p>"Who are you?"</p>

    <p>One of the female elders, called Summer Rain, stared at him. "The fluctuation of your spirit energy seems familiar... are you the son of an old friend? I feel that it's really familiar; perhaps all this is just a misunderstanding."</p>

    <p>To be able to set up the intrinsic spirit field solely with his own strength — the gap was too big! And so this female elder could only spout this ingratiating bullshit to stall for time as much as possible.</p>

    <p>Although they couldn't destroy the intrinsic spirit field, they had still been able to send a message to the outside world and call the Master of Immortal Mansion for help.</p>

    <p>"My real name is Fang Xing, do you recognize me?" The harmless way in which the young man continued to smile was especially horrifying to these three female elders.</p>

    <p>"Mm, I know you..." The female elder continued babbling nonsense.</p>

    <p>"My foster parents gave me this name shortly after I was born. I haven't met you before, how can you possibly recognize me? Did you think I didn't see the signal you sent out earlier?"</p>

    <p>The female elders were terrified as Fang Xing laughed coldly. "He's just the Master of Immortal Mansion, killing him won't be enough for me. Although you've never met me, you've definitely met my dad."</p>

    <p>Under the frightened faces of these three female elders, Fang Xing narrowed his eyes, and his originally bright expression slowly turned gloomy as he gradually lost his smile. "Over all these centuries, hasn't Immortal Mansion used my dad's Ice Crystal Array to perform countless crimes?"</p>

    <p>"You are..."</p>

    <p>Their eyes all widened at the same time, but before they could say any more, the three female elders felt heavy pressure on them.</p>

    <p>With just a flick of his finger, they were all buried in the ground up to their necks.</p>

    <p>Under this massive pressure, they struggled to even open their eyes and mouths!</p>

    <p>Fang Xing gradually came over to them and transformed his hand into a spirit blade which he held to their heads. "I know that you aren't the ringleader, so I'll give you quick deaths."</p>

    <p>Right after he said that —</p>

    <p>In the next moment, a low and deep voice came from the sky. "Junior, don't you dare touch them."</p>

    <p>Although they couldn't speak under the huge pressure, the three female elders couldn't help cheering in their hearts.</p>

    <p>They knew that Master had arrived!</p>

    <p>This voice contained pure magical fluctuations which were actually able to penetrate the intrinsic spirit field. Although it didn't affect the spirit field, Fang Xing was still slightly surprised.</p>

    <p>"Oh?"</p>

    <p>Fang Xing grinned as he gazed at the sky. "So you've finally shown yourself?"</p>

    <p>However, this voice didn't stop him from making his move.</p>

    <p>The blade fell, and a head was cut off in one slice with the sound of a snap.</p>

    <p>The head of one of the female elders had already left her body...</p>
