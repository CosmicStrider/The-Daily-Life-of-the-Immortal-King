  <h1>Chapter 971 Tragic Liang Heng</h1>

  <div>

    <p>There was a huge explosion in Balance Magic Center, and news of it spread like wildfire that night.</p>

    <p>Liang Heng got what he deserved!</p>

    <p>Father Chen didn't know what was going on, but somehow felt extremely relieved.</p>

    <p>"My god, you don't know how big that mushroom cloud was! Fortunately, there wasn't anyone around, or it would have been a tragedy!"</p>

    <p>"Why did it explode?"</p>

    <p>"I heard it was a laptop that exploded; its Boeing battery overheated and went out of control before it exploded!"</p>

    <p>"Then what's the deal with the mushroom cloud?"</p>

    <p>"There are some laptops on the market now that are manufactured according to magic treasure configurations, and they all use spirit nuclear power; a laptop can go several decades without needing to be recharged. But Chief Liang was really unlucky with his laptop; there were quality issues with the spirit cores of that model, and they were recalled before. Maybe Chief Liang was too busy to bother; it's no wonder it blew up."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>The spirit core itself was an energy crystal made from dense spirit power molecules. The principle was similar to General Yi's Palm Sword and the Old Devil's Chaos Ball, both of which were based on the compression of spirit power.</p>

    <p>And the fact that this technology was already on the market meant that it was already highly sophisticated, so normally speaking, the chances of an explosion happening was 0.01%, which was the probability of a plane crashing... or winning the lottery.</p>

    <p>So, Chief Liang won the lottery...</p>

    <p>And furthermore had hit the top jackpot.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling watched Chen Chao's memory play out through Wang Xiaoling's eyes.</p>

    <p>In Wang Ling's own memory, he did indeed remember news of this back then, but he never expected the cause of the explosion to actually be Chen Chao's blessed mouth...</p>

    <p>It had to be said that this Master Jin Deng was pretty strong! A single body enlightenment spell could actually create such an effect...</p>

    <p>Experts lurked among the people - the world had always been filled with plenty of fantastic oddities. Wang Ling felt that he himself was one such example - born invincible, was there anything more bizarre than that...</p>

    <p>It could only be said that Master Jin Deng was an enigma, an unusual person with sublime thoughts.</p>

    <p>Given Master Jin Deng's capability, Wang Ling felt that it wouldn't be difficult for the former to make a name for himself in the cultivation world as long as he wanted to.</p>

    <p>But in the end, this master still operated his own run-down temple and used his wisdom to enlighten others, living a quiet and ordinary life...</p>

    <p>It was worth learning such a state.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After returning from the temple, Father Chen asked some students about Liang Heng. It was said that Liang Heng was in very wretched condition; he had been right in the middle of the explosion, and had burns to 85% of his body.</p>

    <p>A crappy parent who taught his kid how to bully others with fireball spells in the end was injured himself in a massive explosion - what a tragic end indeed...</p>

    <p>When the explosion happened, alarmed residents all along the street came over to put out the fire. Each household sent out water talismans in the air, and for a moment it looked like the annual performance of the flooding of Jinshan Temple <sup>1</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(From the Chinese folktale of
the Legend of the White
Snake.)</dfn>

    <p>The local fire brigade and ambulance hurried over in time to completely control the fire and rescue Liang Heng.</p>

    <p>"Chief Liang is too unlucky..." When a student spoke to Father Chen about Chief Liang in class that day, he still shuddered with fear. He had already paid Liang Heng a visit, so he was more aware of Liang Heng's situation.</p>

    <p>Actually, the main reason for his visit wasn't because he was worried about Liang Heng, but that the students were curious about what Chief Liang with burns looked like...</p>

    <p>"Chief Liang... how is he?" Father Chen said, "I'm wondering whether I should visit him and bring a fruit basket..." No matter how bad a person Liang Heng was, he was still Father Chen's senior brother from the same sect... Besides, Father Chen thought it would be hard for Liang Heng to stir up trouble again after receiving this retribution.</p>

    <p>"Teacher Chen, you better not send anything. I brought him a fruit basket yesterday, but when I got there, I realized that he couldn't eat at all... Chief Liang was burned to the point of becoming a mummy..."</p>

    <p>"A mummy..."</p>

    <p>"That's right. The doctor said that for some reason, Chief Liang's organs have aged severely. Otherwise, his injuries could still recover with time... When the explosion happened, I went over to have a look. When Chief Liang was carried into the ambulance, it looked like even his nails had been burned off."</p>

    <p>"You really noticed everything..."</p>

    <p>"It's impossible not to notice <sup>2</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(The actual Chinese phrase
used literally translates to "cat
staring at crotch," which is
used to describe the obvious
bulge in a guy's pants ..)</dfn>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Chief Liang's life was saved, but he's going to be a cripple from now on; his organs are so badly damaged that they've been replaced with artificial ones, which isn't fully covered by medical insurance; it might be a long time before Chief Liang can pay off his medical bills."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Father Chen didn't sleep until much later that night. After thinking about it for a long time, he still decided to collect some donations on the cultivation forum for Liang Heng. Liang Heng had gotten his retribution, but his family members shouldn't have to suffer for it. When Father Chen saw Liang Heng's wife trying to raise money by selling their real estate, he couldn't bear it.</p>

    <p>All the family property and real estate, as well as the fees Liang Heng had collected from his students all these years, wouldn't be enough to cover his costly medical bills.</p>

    <p>Even if they wanted to file an insurance claim with the computer manufacturing company, the company had done a recall of the computer model before, so from a legal point of view, it wasn't as if the company hadn't taken steps to address the problem.</p>

    <p>"It'll be tough for the Liang family from now on." Father Chen sighed.</p>

    <p>Looking at his rival of so many years collapse just like that, seemingly on the verge of death, Father Chen's heart was actually a little sorrowful.</p>

    <p>There was no way he would make a donation himself.</p>

    <p>But it was possible to do some charitable work.</p>

    <p>"Dad, are you really going to help him?" Chen Chao didn't really understand Father Chen's behavior.</p>

    <p>"He has always liked to compete with me, but in recent years, he became a little more obsessive. He was quite aggressive when we were at school, but he actually wasn't a bad person."</p>

    <p>Recalling the old days, Father Chen shared his thoughts. "Son, you'll understand once you start school. Your time at school will be fleeting, but wonderful."</p>

    <p>"But I heard from some of the older brothers that school is tiring and there's endless homework..."</p>

    <p>"That's just one side of it. Once you and Xiaoling start school, you'll understand that your school days are the happiest; a lot of people only realize this after they start working."</p>

    <p>"But I heard that Chief Liang is going to die soon, so these donations will be useless, won't they?" Chen Chao said.</p>

    <p>"The hospital has already saved his life. While there's still some danger, it's not a big problem..."</p>

    <p>As Father Chen said this, he suddenly remembered the silk pouch which Master Jin Deng had given him when Father Chen and his group left the Buddhist temple.</p>

    <p>Father Chen still remembered what Master Jin Deng had said.</p>

    <p>Master Jin Deng said Chen Chao would suffer a calamity when he was sixteen, but if they chose the right school for him, he would survive it.</p>

    <p>Then the master gave Father Chen this silk pouch and told him only to open it once he returned home.</p>

    <p>"What's inside the silk pouch?"</p>

    <p>"Don't worry."</p>

    <p>Father Chen opened the silk pouch and looked inside. "Master chose a high school for you to attend when the time comes. It's already late; go to bed. I'm going to write a post for donations for Chief Liang."</p>

    <p>"Oh..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Father Chen spent roughly half an hour drafting the post. Just as he was about to send it out, a notice suddenly appeared in his university class group, which had been quiet for a long time, and all the members were @'ed in it. "Condolences on Classmate Liang Heng's death..."</p>

    <p>Father Chen was shocked. "Wasn't his life no longer in danger..."</p>

    <p>Someone in the know replied, "I confirmed it with the hospital just now. He contracted a serious infection and didn't survive the critical stage, <em>sigh </em>!"</p>

    <p>Seeing the news in the group, Father Chen turned to look in the direction of Chen Chao's bedroom and felt a chill run down his body for some reason.</p>
