  <h1>Chapter 718 Six Zhuo Yi's Out of Every One Hundred People</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Just as Wang Ming had said, considering the incident with the Demon Hunters Association's President Bai, Wang Ling indeed had to pay more attention to his actions, especially in the next few days. While the incident might already seem to be over, the repercussions of the entire thing were in fact only just beginning.</p>

    <p>Roughly half an hour after the announcement about getting some rest, the dorms received news once again that lunch was ready in the canteen in the central Zone 66 for whoever needed it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at the time. It was now noon, around the same time that Number 60 High's canteen usually opened. Although the Rainbow Glass Box was a spatial magic treasure, the inside of the box was like a portable immortal warship. The dorms, canteens and training rooms inside were all outfitted military-style.</p>

    <p>There was no way to avoid eating, and this summer camp actually wasn't going to be as relaxing as expected. Thus, in order to ensure that every student had abundant energy, it was necessary to support their physical fitness, and everyone had to eat.</p>

    <p>There was a special sign-in area in the canteen in Zone 66 which no one could escape. The sign-in area was just like the dorms as both directly used facial recognition: you needed facial recognition to enter your dorm, and to sign in at the canteen.</p>

    <p>Of course, unlike for the students, the regulation wasn't as strict for the personnel.</p>

    <p>"Do you want to change your face before we go to the canteen? I can directly refresh the data for your face in the system," Wang Ming turned to ask Wang Ling before they went out.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling shook his head. In any case, no one else outside school had seen his image before... Besides, even if he used the Great Transfiguration Spell, he was still wearing Number 60 High's school uniform. Lao Gudong's eyesight was especially good, and he could name all the Number 60 High students on the trip this time. If he suddenly saw a student with a strange face, it would definitely be troublesome once more.</p>

    <p>So transfiguration actually wasn't necessary.</p>

    <p>The two brothers walked out the door toward the canteen. On the way, Wang Ling heard Wang Ming mention a familiar name. "I heard that the nutrition consultant for the Zone 66 canteen this time is Number 60 High's Mother Juan."</p>

    <p>Surprised, Wang Ling asked, "Mother Juan is here?"</p>

    <p>He hadn't seen even her shadow earlier in the square.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "She's just a nutrition consultant, after all, so it's fine to give advice remotely; she doesn't need to personally come."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Lunch this time was very sumptuous, beginning with a braised Dahuan pill, followed by a side of steamed essence-clearing pills... Furthermore, the essence-clearing pill was steamed in fish soup stock and had a very fishy taste.</p>

    <p>The canteen was very large. Because the announcement had been made only a short time ago, there still weren't many people there when Wang Ling and Wang Ming arrived. The brothers took a lunchbox each and sat down in a remote corner, mainly to avoid trouble.</p>

    <p>They hadn't been sitting for long when Wang Ling noticed that the black-faced Wu Zhenjun had also come. Wang Ming glanced at Wu Zhenjun and couldn't help smiling. "Don't you think you and this Wu Zhenjun are pretty similar? But he really has a black face, while you're a mensao <sup>1</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A 'tsundere..')</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>After the two brothers sat for a while, the canteen filled up all of a sudden with a lot of students wearing various uniforms from other schools.</p>

    <p>This time, the students attending this summer camp organized by Songhai city were all Grade One freshmen.</p>

    <p>The General Administration of 100 Schools had announced that all the schools attending had been determined by drawing lots... There were so many high schools in Songhai city, and in terms of qualifications, a key city high school candidate like Number 60 High wouldn't have had a chance at all.</p>

    <p>Since this was decided by drawing lots, every high school could only cheerfully accept it.</p>

    <p>The truth was that all the other high schools had been chosen through a ballot, while Number 60 High was the only one that had been imperially selected by Secretary Dakang himself... And of the six major high schools in Peiyuan district, only Number 60 High was participating in the summer camp activity this time.</p>

    <p>Of course, it wasn't good to let this out.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, the other high school headmasters would definitely come looking for a fight...</p>

    <p>So this time, Wang Ling saw a lot of students from other district schools.</p>

    <p>For example, Remnant High, full name: Remnant Elder Senior High School.</p>

    <p>This was a key city high school in Hualing district, and all the students enrolled there were at the middle Foundation Establishment stage... In this aspect alone, Number 60 High was far behind Remnant High. The most important thing, moreover, was that Remnant High had a very high success rate of students reaching the Golden Core stage; up to six percent of them would have broken through to the Golden Core stage before officially entering university.</p>

    <p>This number was already quite ridiculous...</p>

    <p>In plain English, it was six Zhuo Yi's out of every one hundred people!</p>

    <p>To be clear, Zhuo Yi was a rare once-in-a-century cultivation genius at Number 60 High...</p>

    <p>Also, Zhuo Yi had entered Number 60 High back then purely because there had been a gross miscalculation of his score for the written portion of the high school entrance exam. Otherwise, he definitely would have directly entered a key city high school back then.</p>

    <p>While Wang Ling was pondering this, he saw a student in a Remnant High uniform stroll unhurriedly to their corner. The Remnant High school uniform wasn't quite like the typical high school uniform, and seemed to incorporate a little of the Western style.</p>

    <p>The uniform consisted of a white shirt inside and a pair of black stretch pants under what looked like a short cape, which looked very trendy.</p>

    <p>This person had a pair of bright blue eyes, and there was a noble air about him. At first glance, Wang Ling concluded that this person was probably of mixed blood.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought that this person was looking for a place to sit, but never thought that he would actually directly approach them with his lunchbox in hand. "Excuse me, may I sit here?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was just about to say no, but the person preempted him as he smiled at the two brothers and said, "Thank you!"</p>

    <p>Then he directly put the lunchbox down and sat down next to Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was obviously bewildered. This guy wasn't following the script at all... he just directly said thanks and sat down!</p>

    <p>Wang Ming's lips twitched. Remembering that his identity was that of a teacher now and he needed to keep his poise, he reined in his displeasure and exhaled.</p>

    <p>Looking at this scene, Wang Ling somehow felt that there was a very strange malevolent air in the canteen...</p>

    <p>He looked around, and sure enough, he saw Zhai Yin in the distance approaching them with a lunchbox in hand.</p>

    <p>She then chose to sit at the table directly behind Wang Ming, involuntarily creating a significant amount of pressure...</p>

    <p>To be honest, while the canteen food for this summer camp was good, Wang Ling had no appetite at all. This summer camp was a cultivation and study trip, and it had been clearly written in the list of items to bring that snacks weren't allowed - there had been enough snacks confiscated in the square earlier to open a kiosk.</p>

    <p>Thus, the next few days would be ones without crispy noodle snacks. For Wang Ling, this was a little lonely and unbearable.</p>

    <p>As a result, Wang Ling basically didn't touch his lunchbox on the table...</p>

    <p>In contrast, the mixed-blood young man sitting next to Wang Ming seemed to have a good appetite, and he stared at Wang Ling's lunchbox for a long while.</p>

    <p>Then, the young man suddenly asked, "Excuse me, this classmate, if you don't want to eat this braised Dahuan pill, may I have it?"</p>

    <p>Before Wang Ling could reply, he already heard the young man say again, "Thank you!"</p>

    <p>Then, with one stab of his chopsticks, he directly took the Dahuan pill...</p>

    <p>Sweating inwardly, Wang Ling was one hundred percent sure that he had encountered some weirdo yet again.</p>

    <p>Why couldn't there be any slightly more normal people around him?!</p>
