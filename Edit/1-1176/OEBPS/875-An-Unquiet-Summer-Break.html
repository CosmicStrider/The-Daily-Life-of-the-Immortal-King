  <h1>Chapter 875 An Unquiet Summer Break</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Sunday, August 20th.</p>

    <p>It was the seventh day of the official summer vacation.</p>

    <p>For Wang Ling, the summer break was supposed to be relaxing and quiet, without needing to wake up early in the morning; he didn't even need to complete his summer homework himself. The only thing Wang Ling wanted to do was basically goof off by binge-watching a crack TV show while eating a packet of iced crispy noodle snacks.</p>

    <p>This summer break, however, wasn't as peaceful as he had imagined.</p>

    <p>It had been a long time since Wang Ling had a prophetic dream. The last time he had one, he dreamt that Lord Diulei was in danger. This time, it was Immortal Toya...</p>

    <p>But the Immortal Toya in his dream wasn't lying in a pool of blood like Lord Diulei. Immortal Toya was clearly still alive, but his personality was completely different, and there were even images in the dream of him abusing Jin Shi and Yin Shi...</p>

    <p>To Immortal Toya, Jin Shi and Yin Shi were like his son and daughter.</p>

    <p>Although Immortal Toya was usually quite strict with Jin Shi and Yin Shi when it came to refining pills, he would never commit this type of domestic violence. In the dream, Wang Ling saw that Jin Shi's and Yin Shi's eyes were swollen and they looked like pandas - definitely nothing like that scheming woman on Sun Island who deliberately touched up her face and claimed that her boyfriend had beaten her badly.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling decided to visit Chrysanthemum Island.</p>

    <p>But before he set out, he noticed that he had a few missed calls on his wristwatch.</p>

    <p>They were all from Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>Unlike an ordinary dream, it wasn't easy to break out of a prophetic dream. That was to say, while Wang Ling was dreaming, he would enter a state from which he couldn't be roused by whatever means until the prophetic dream ended.</p>

    <p>It seemed that something had really happened...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling frowned and quickly typed out a message to Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling!"</p>

    <p>When Lord Diulei hadn't been able to reach Wang Ling by phone earlier, he hadn't dared directly bother Wang Ling, and so had been waiting in front of his phone this whole time. Seeing the ellipsis Wang Ling sent him, he was instantly stirred up. "Brother Ling, something might have happened to Brother To! I'm going over to his island... plus, I'm a little worried about Jin Shi and Yin Shi. He texted me several hours ago, but I was at the broccoli farm then, and didn't immediately see it... Brother Ling, you know that in order to better cultivate the Heavenly Dao broccoli, we got rid of all radiation, so there's no signal on the farm."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Lately, Lord Diulei had been very busy with the Heavenly Dao broccoli.</p>

    <p>Since the opening ceremony, when Lord Diulei turned into a True Venerated after eating the Heavenly Dao broccoli, the Office of Strategic Deception had been completely flooded with orders for Heavenly Dao broccoli; all the Heavenly Dao broccoli on the farm were already booked out, and there was even a waitlist now for future orders.</p>

    <p>The waitlist was already up to fifty years...</p>

    <p>On top of that, the wait time between orders was getting longer.</p>

    <p>In short, there just wasn't enough supply of Heavenly Dao broccoli.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei then sent his location.</p>

    <p>His was currently on the move.</p>

    <p>He was still some distance away from Immortal Toya's Chrysanthemum Island. Unfortunately, Lord Diulei didn't have Wuji with him. Otherwise, with her ability to shuttle between spaces, he would be able to reach Chrysanthemum Island in no time.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei could also open a space with his own strength.</p>

    <p>But he could only move short distances.</p>

    <p>Because when all was said and done, he wasn't a cultivator who specially cultivated spatial abilities.</p>

    <p>From Wang Ling's research before, Thunder was a cultivator with a metal spirit root.</p>

    <p>This type of cultivator was more resilient and their spells had an extremely powerful penetrative ability which made them especially useful as support for damage- and attack-resistant defense spells.</p>

    <p>Since Lord Diulei was already on his way, Wang Ling felt that there was no hurry for him to go over.</p>

    <p>Given Lord Diulei's current realm, an ordinary opponent wouldn't be able to shake him at all.</p>

    <p>Moreover, Lord Diulei still had the Soul Suppression Ring which Wang Ling had given to him... He was an extremely stalwart Main Tank warrior who could be endlessly resurrected!</p>

    <p>It was Wang Ling who had secretly bestowed this realm and power on Lord Diulei; however, he couldn't just give him a realm and not give him any spells - all stars had their own signature spells.</p>

    <p>Like the Old Devil's Chaos Ball.</p>

    <p>Like General Yi's Palm Sword.</p>

    <p>And like the "The Sixology Scripture" that had been popular recently. This was the signature spell of the famous performance artist Teacher Six. Wang Ling remembered deliberately looking up this spell, which enabled a cultivator to directly summon the spirit of the brave departed in the funeral hall - it was truly an outstanding spell <sup>1</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(https://supchina.com/2019/01/08/the-lifetime-of-a-meme-the-lesson-of-zhang-jinlai/

describing what this entire
meme is about)</dfn>

    <p>In contrast, Lord Diulei didn't seem to have anything he could use as a signature spell.</p>

    <p>Unless courting death could be considered a spell...</p>

    <p>But the problem was that Lord Diulei wasn't Sion <sup>2</sup>either!</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(A character in LoL who can reanimate himself after he dies.)</dfn>

    <p>Dropping his forehead into his hands, Wang Ling pondered.</p>

    <p>He was going to create a spell for Thunder that matched his metal spirit root.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Thus, after several minutes, Lord Diulei, who was hastily making his way to Chrysanthemum Island on his sword in the sky, suddenly saw a space open in front of him. Wang Ling's hand stretched out of the space to pass an exercise book to Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>This was an exercise book for especial use by students. It was light and convenient, and mainly used for math homework...</p>

    <p>When Lord Diulei opened the exercise book, he was almost blinded by the glowing golden letters inside.</p>

    <p>"This is..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was stupefied. This exercise book actually contained a metal palm technique called the "Wutian Golden Buddha Palm."</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei put the exercise book away carefully, then excitedly typed out a message.</p>

    <p>This was the first time Wang Ling had given him a spell, and Lord Diulei didn't know how to thank him in words.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei typed excitedly, "Is this spell from a classic collection?"</p>

    <p>"Just put together," Wang Ling replied in brief.</p>

    <p>Just put together...</p>

    <p>What kind of release was that? How was that different from a compilation <sup>3</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(Grenade-Throwing is
confused by Wang Ling's "just
made"刚编,when he's
thinking about "compilation"
精编.)</dfn>

    <p>Looking at these three words, Lord Diulei was dazed for a moment.</p>

    <p>Then, he sucked in a cold breath of air.</p>

    <p>He finally realized how abnormal this spell was.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had only just come up with it...</p>

    <p>Was there anyone nowadays who could actually play around and casually create magic?</p>

    <p>After seeing how Wang Ling took a few minutes to refine more than ten holy artifacts last time, Lord Diulei already felt like his worldview had been shattered and shuffled around. In the end, looking at this scene in front of him, his worldview was inevitably shaken and destroyed yet again.</p>

    <p>But that still wasn't the scariest bit.</p>

    <p>The scariest part was the study instructions in this <em>Wutian Golden Buddha Palm</em>book.</p>

    <p>The entire exercise book was written in golden runes which Lord Diulei couldn't read.</p>

    <p>The only thing he could understand were the large words "Wutian Golden Buddha Palm" on the first page as well as the study instructions below it.</p>

    <p>The contents of the first page were:</p>

    <p><em>Title: Wutian Golden Buddha Palm</em></p>

    <p><em>Study instructions: Please swallow the exercise book, and you will automatically understand the spell...</em></p>
