  <h1>Chapter 519 Ah! It's a Light! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>The whole planet shook with a violent tremor, as if its core was turning over.</p>

    <p>As soon as the fluctuations hit, both Immortal Zhenyuan and Wind Spirit instinctively sensed danger, but it wasn't life-threatening, so their expressions were quite calm.</p>

    <p>Wind Spirit frowned as he gazed at the red-haired young man in front of him. He knew that it absolutely hadn't been this man who had caused the fluctuations. Besides, the man's expression had a faint trace of surprise in it, and it was very clear that he didn't know anything about these unusual energy fluctuations.</p>

    <p>Was the planet about to be destroyed?</p>

    <p>Wind Spirit subconsciously thought that this wasn't likely.</p>

    <p>He basically had all of Zhenyuan's memories. In order to find this second planet suitable for cultivators to inhabit, Zhenyuan had spent a whole thousand years exploring countless planets beyond the Milky Way on his own before finally finding the one below them. Because this planet was dry and cracked all year round, and there wasn't the slightest bit of moisture to be found on it, Immortal Zhenyuan had named it Drought Star.</p>

    <p>It had taken him a thousand years just to find this Drought Star... but he had yet to even see two tenths of the vast space outside the Milky Way.</p>

    <p>Because he had had to consider the time it took for the return journey, Immortal Zhenyuan's planet-hopping trip had ended very quickly and he had only brought back a "Drought Star." Although the planet didn't have any water, this wasn't a big problem. The most important thing was that the planet's structure was stable and it had abundant spirit energy; that was what Immortal Zhenyuan cared about.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the instant the Drought Star started shaking, Wind Spirit felt that his speculation didn't actually make sense.</p>

    <p>But if it wasn't Zhenyuan producing the unusual energy fluctuations, who else could it be?</p>

    <p>To be able to cause such fluctuations... this strength obviously surpassed True Immortal level...</p>

    <p>But in the current world of human cultivators, he and Zhenyuan were the only two to have broken through to True Immortal level.</p>

    <p>Numerous thoughts crowded Wind Spirit's mind in the two seconds after the planet started shaking.</p>

    <p>Then, suddenly, his head felt very warm.</p>

    <p>He looked up.</p>

    <p>And was stunned to find...</p>

    <p>Ah!</p>

    <p>It was a ray of light!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Lord Ma's space transmission technique actually opened a passageway. From the Wang family's small villa, it took less than five seconds to reach the coordinates Wang Ling had specified. But in that five seconds, just as they were about to emerge from the passageway, Wang Ling sensed the presence of people in the space.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, it was two completely different auras.</p>

    <p>When he sensed the auras, they had just collided violently with each other, and Wang Ling immediately realized that a fight was probably happening in this space. Furthermore, it was very clear that neither of them were weak... Judging from the auras at least, Wang Ling felt that they were a lot more established than Evil Sword God.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling hadn't thought that there would actually be someone here, so the second he was about to be transmitted to the site, he urgently cast a Great Void Spell on himself to make his entire body immaterial.</p>

    <p>He didn't use this technique very much, because once the Great Void Spell was activated, it would only wear off on its own after twelve hours. Like the Great Fortune Spell, it was a major spell that couldn't be canceled halfway.</p>

    <p>Actually, there were quite a number of spells among the Three Thousand Great Spells that couldn't be canceled halfway.</p>

    <p>After all, these were the Three Thousand Great Spells, which modern cultivators referred to as the "Heavenly Dao."</p>

    <p>If they could be used or canceled so casually, how disgraceful would that be for the Heavenly Dao?</p>

    <p>So this trick wasn't something he used in his ordinary school life.</p>

    <p>When the transmission light descended like a miracle, shining directly down on Wind Spirit's head...</p>

    <p>Wind Spirit subconsciously shaded his eyes. Even though he hadn't completely materialized, he had his sight organ.</p>

    <p>This light pierced his eyes...</p>

    <p>In the distance, Immortal Zhenyuan also narrowed his eyes slightly as they stung from the light.</p>

    <p>Both of them were shaken in their hearts almost simultaneously.</p>

    <p>They actually could feel the prickling in their eyes, which wasn't normal to begin with.</p>

    <p>At Venerated Immortal level, the Heavenly Eye would transform into the eyes of an immortal, and was called the Immortal Eye for short.</p>

    <p>In terms of performance, the Immortal Eye was naturally far better than the Heavenly Eye; even Evil Sword God's "Purple Investigative Demon Eye" wasn't a fraction as good as the Immortal Eye.</p>

    <p>Even so, they were dazzled by this golden light falling from the sky, to the point that Wind Spirit, who was closer to it, could feel his eyeballs burning in their sockets.</p>

    <p>Wind Spirit grit his teeth; he almost lost control and cried out at the sensation of pain, something he had not felt in a very long time.</p>

    <p>But the transmission light quickly dissipated, and when Wind Spirit opened his eyes once more, he suddenly saw a flash of green in front of him...</p>

    <p>Then something fleshy hit him in the face!</p>

    <p>The impact was so heavy he was actually unable to maintain his stance, and he was directly sent flying through the air!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The fuck?!</p>

    <p>At the same time, Er Ha also cried out in its heart before a golden light propped it up.</p>

    <p>This was Wang Ling's golden light shield, which in a battle in outer space, could act as a "flexible magic halo" and enable Er Ha to quickly adapt to the environment. When there was a change in gravity, it also allowed Er Ha to hover freely in the air.</p>

    <p>Actually, Wang Ling would have cast this golden light shield on Er Ha no matter what kind of space this was.</p>

    <p>Because during the five seconds they had been in the passageway, Wang Ling had sensed that the space was very dangerous.</p>

    <p>Reality proved Wang Ling right when they descended for real.</p>

    <p>The ground beneath their feet looked like it had been chewed up by a heavenly hound. A volatile gas had been released after the energy fluctuations had faded, and it smelled very similar to gunpowder smoke.</p>

    <p>These were clear signs that a battle had been fought here.</p>

    <p>Er Ha floated in the air on its four dog legs, feeling a little unused to it.</p>

    <p>But very soon it calmed down, and it gazed at the ground below its dog paws, which looked like it had been blown up by a spirit bomb<sup>1</sup>.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A powerful attack from the Japanese cartoon series 'Dragon Ball.')</dfn>

    <p>By the by... had it hit something just now?</p>

    <p>Because it had Little Master Ling's golden light shield on it, even if it had been a fierce strike, Er Ha hadn't felt the slightest bit of pain.</p>

    <p>"A... dog?"</p>

    <p>In the distance, Immortal Zhenyuan stared at the air... After the golden light dissipated, a green figure emerged, with a face full of bewilderment.</p>

    <p>Why would a dog land here?</p>

    <p>Also, it looked like a dog that couldn't change forms...</p>

    <p>But the point was that it was covered in a faint golden sheen!</p>

    <p>My god!</p>

    <p>Could this be the fabled "golden light shield"?</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan remembered that this was an Almighty halo that only a Sage Body could possess after comprehending three or more types of Heavenly Dao and condensing the power of the Heavenly Dao together.</p>

    <p>Could it be...</p>

    <p>Was this, this, this dog... the savior of the world???</p>

    <p>Immortal Zhenyuan gaped wide enough to swallow an egg!</p>
