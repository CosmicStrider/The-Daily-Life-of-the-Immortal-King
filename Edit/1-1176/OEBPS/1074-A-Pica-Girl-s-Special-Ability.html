  <h1>Chapter 1074 A Pica Girl's Special Ability</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling thought this was good news.</p>

    <p>Although the person agreed to eat the dumplings, they were suffering from pica, and their body couldn't keep normal food down, so they only ate a little. If it was just a little, then the heart demon corrosion shouldn't be too advanced.</p>

    <p>"How did this person get pica?" Er Ha couldn't help asking as they followed Xiao Yin to the ward.</p>

    <p>"The patient is a girl, and every day she yells about how she wants to lose weight. She started out by eating only one cucumber a day, and later stopped eating altogether. Then she got really hungry, but refused to eat food, and suddenly fell in love with soot, which doesn't contain fat and can make her full. The girl was very happy to eat it. In the end, she was poisoned, and thus brought to the hospital." As he spoke, Xiao Yin took out his phone and searched for the photos he had obtained from the doctor.</p>

    <p>"Look, this is a photo of the girl when she was healthy," Xiao Yin said.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Er Ha look at the phone screen. This was a girl with a figure that was just right. She was already well-developed, with flesh in all the right places.</p>

    <p>"This kid doesn't look fat; she doesn't need to lose weight at all." Er Ha didn't quite understand why some boys and girls would go to such extremes in a diet in order to lose weight.</p>

    <p>If you were hungry, you had to eat.</p>

    <p>Didn't you just need to make sure to exercise every day? You wouldn't gain weight that way.</p>

    <p>Eating healthily was very important. As long as a person didn't consume a lot of fat, and had a healthy diet and proper exercise, a good figure wasn't a pipe dream.</p>

    <p>After all, not everyone could be like Wang Ling, who rubbed away whatever fat he gained on his body like plasticine...</p>

    <p>For now, they would take a look at her.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at the phone screen with a calm expression.</p>

    <p>He had the Bell of Purification in his hand. It shouldn't be a problem to drive out the heart demon.</p>

    <p>A few minutes later, Xiao Yin led Wang Ling to a ward in the special zone. Wang Ling, Xiao Yin and Er Ha were all wearing white robes, and Er Ha's white robe was tailor-made. The Office of Strategic Deception had given them new identities as consultant doctors.</p>

    <p>The head nurse saw Xiao Yin bring Wang Ling and Er Ha over, and she exclaimed when she saw Wang Ling's young face, "You're Dr Wang? You're so young!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "Mm..."</p>

    <p>"Head nurse, please don't mind him. My teacher doesn't really talk much. We'll have to trouble you!" Xiao Yin took the initiative to step forward and greet the head nurse.</p>

    <p>"Mm, alright..." The head nurse nodded woodenly.</p>

    <p>Long before Wang Ling and Er Ha arrived, Xiao Yin had already made all the preparations.</p>

    <p>Their credentials passed muster and their fake identities were ironclad.</p>

    <p>But even so, the head nurse was still very curious about Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>She felt that this Dr Wang was too young. Also, he seemed to be quite the character, even bringing a spirit dog with him when he visited the patient.</p>

    <p>It was rare to see such a handsome and young doctor with this sort of character.</p>

    <p>Instantly, the head nurse's imagination started to run wild over Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Follow me, please." The head nurse took out an all-purpose card and started to lead the way. The special zone had individual wards, where a lot of unusual patients were treated.</p>

    <p>"That girl with pica wouldn't have come here originally, but after she ate the dumplings, her mental state suddenly changed for some reason and she became completely unstable. Not only that, but her appetite also increased. Although she started to eat again, she binged like crazy, and her weight increased by 30 jin in a short period of time." The head nurse frowned. "We've never seen anything like it before, and we suspect that it's an unusual disease, so she's quarantined here for observation and treatment."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded his head.</p>

    <p>Following the head nurse, they reached the door to Ward 1306, where they heard the hysterical cries of a girl.</p>

    <p>"As you can see, the girl's already gone crazy, shouting for food." The head nurse sighed. "The walls of this ward are made of special memory foam to prevent some mental patients from doing something dangerous like knocking their heads against the walls. Even if the walls are damaged, they can bounce back in a short time, and have the ability to absorb water and fire."</p>

    <p>"Since the girl's illness was triggered by the frozen dumplings, where are the frozen dumplings?" Er Ha asked.</p>

    <p>"They were thrown out," said the head nurse.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin then said to Wang Ling and Er Ha telepathically, "Master, don't worry. Thunder has arranged for all the frozen dumplings to be recovered!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling breathed a sigh of relief at the news.</p>

    <p>No matter what, it was a good thing that these dumplings weren't passed on again...</p>

    <p>The head nurse swiped the card, then hid somewhat fearfully behind Wang Ling. "Dr Wang, I'm scared..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Seeing this, Xiao Yin hurriedly grabbed the head nurse's hand, then turned around to stand in front of her. "Head nurse, Lao Gudong has mysophobia. It's better for you not to touch him..."</p>

    <p>The head nurse retracted her hand in disappointment.</p>

    <p>She knew it wasn't very nice for an old cow like her to eat young grass.</p>

    <p>But a person could dream!</p>

    <p>Hearing the head nurse's thoughts, Wang Ling was speechless.</p>

    <p>This lunatic author had set up crispy noodle snacks as the female lead, and had even stopped writing about Sun Rong. How can an "old cow" like you compare with Sun Rong? Sun Rong isn't even the female lead, and you want to be the female lead? That isn't a dream, but simply a fantasy!</p>

    <p>Ignoring the head nurse's "dream," Wang Ling pushed the door open.</p>

    <p>There wasn't any furniture in the special ward, so no matter how much of a scene the girl made, it was no use.</p>

    <p>Seeing that someone had come in, a crazed look appeared on the girl's face. She stared at Wang Ling and sniffed him, and muttered incessantly, "Crispy noodle snacks... crispy noodle snacks... crispy noodle snacks..."</p>

    <p>She smelled crispy noodle snacks on Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>Then she sniffed Xiao Yin. "Broccoli... broccoli... broccoli..."</p>

    <p>"What kind of ability is that?" Xiao Yin was startled.</p>

    <p>The head nurse, who was hiding at the back, explained, "After she went crazy, it seems that she's able to smell what other people have eaten in the last few hours."</p>

    <p>"I see..." Xiao Yin was struck by realization. He had indeed been eating broccoli salad with Thunder before this; he never expected the girl to actually be able to sniff out something like this, which didn't have a smell.</p>

    <p>A crazed look started to appear in the girl's eyes. She stared at the head nurse who was hiding in the back and kept repeating the words, "Garlic... garlic... garlic..."</p>

    <p>The head nurse lowered her head and breathed on her palms. She had eaten garlic that evening before she came, but she had already rinsed out her mouth and used a lot of chewing gum so as not to affect anyone. She didn't expect this girl to still be able to smell it.</p>

    <p>Finally, the girl turned her gaze to Er Ha. "Shit... shit... shit..."</p>

    <p>At that moment, everyone turned in unison to look at Er Ha with utterly horrified expressions.</p>
