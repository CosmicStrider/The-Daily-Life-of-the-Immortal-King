  <h1>Chapter 464 Destitute and Dejected Mo Immortal Castle </h1>

  <div>

    <p>This time, the midterm exams at Number 60 High School would adopt the half-day exam mode, which meant an exam a day.</p>

    <p>As for the reason behind this, Headmaster Chen of Number 60 High School certainly had his own considerations. On the one hand, it was to ease the pressure on students; on the other hand, it was to give students enough time to do their revision for the exams.</p>

    <p>Many students would initially be delighted when they heard about this kind of half-day exam system... that was because when half-day exams were carried out for the two major exams, which were the midterms and the finals, lessons would usually be suspended and students could go home directly after the exams!</p>

    <p>This time, however, due to Teacher Pan's strong request, the suspension of lessons was cancelled...</p>

    <p>It could only be said that, as a teaching pioneer at Number 60 High School, Teacher Pan was indeed Teacher Pan. Thanks to her silver tongue, she had forced the headmaster to accept her admonishment and change the system of suspending lessons during the exam period.</p>

    <p>When the news got out, resentment of Teacher Pan in all the classes instantly reached an unprecedented high.</p>

    <p>The first two class periods were given over to the Dao talismans course. The class was utterly silent. After she was done with the lesson, Teacher Pan left the classroom with a pile of test papers in her arms. The sound of her footsteps had barely faded when the students had already started to make noise, growing louder and louder until they completely exploded.</p>

    <p>"Old Pan is crazy..." Chen Chao couldn't help complaining after class.</p>

    <p>"It's certainly a very hateful thing to do, but it doesn't matter. There's nothing to do at home during this time anyway..." Guo Hao spread his hands.</p>

    <p>"Not playing games?" Chen Chao asked.</p>

    <p>"What play game... As long as I don't miss Lord Island's live stream, everything else is fine. Did you watch yesterday's live stream? With a katana in hand, he cut a power cord and his way was lit with sparks<sup>1</sup> as he directly killed twenty people and made a passerby little brother the winner in the end," Guo Hao said. "I also heard that after the live stream, Lord Island contacted the passerby little brother and plans to pair up with him in the future."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(From the book title, used here to mean that he was cool.)</dfn>

    <p>Chen Chao couldn't help tsking. "...This little brother is going to hit it big!"</p>

    <p>Chin in hand, Guo Hao had an enigmatic expression on his face. "Mm, and do you know, I suspect this little brother is very likely someone from our school. No, not suspect - I'm sure of it!"</p>

    <p>Su Xiao also came closer and asked curiously, "Someone from our school? Why do you say that?"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "You know, Lord Island live streams from an island, but it's very strange as no one recognizes it - I have an uncle who works at the Telecommunications Bureau. He was curious about Lord Island and the little brother so he checked their IP addresses."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "What were the results?"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "He couldn't find Lord Island's IP address... it was a string of very strange nonsensical code, and he couldn't find a clear explanation for it. And as for the little brother's IP address... my uncle discovered that it was our school!"</p>

    <p>Little Brother GAYLIGAYQI's IP address was their school?</p>

    <p>The other students were all astonished when they heard this.</p>

    <p>"Who on earth is this little brother?"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao cupped his chin in his hands. "I have no idea right now... but from the name and information from the live stream, this guy is a little gay, and secondly, he probably really enjoys working out..."</p>

    <p>All eyes turned to Chen Chao at the same time.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "Why are you staring at me?! I'm not gay! I'm pure!"</p>

    <p>Lin Xiaoyu's fujoshi soul was restless as she stared at Chen Chao and Guo Hao and smiled sinisterly. "You two are the most gay in our class!"</p>

    <p>"Fuck! Why not Wang Ling... He might not like to talk, but people who generally don't like to talk are mensao!" Chen Chao protested, unable to take it anymore.</p>

    <p>"???"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked up and couldn't help the way his lips twitched.</p>

    <p>Why was he suddenly being dissed?</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "Isn't there a saying? Since ancient times, if mensao youngsters aren't Billy<sup>2</sup>, then they're gay!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(A reference to Billy Herrington, a gay porn actor..)</dfn>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, in the office on the top floor of a luxurious office building in the heart of the city.</p>

    <p>The Lady of the Castle was greeting an honored guest who wanted to buy information.</p>

    <p>Since the Immortal Mansion incident and the incident with Daoist Taotie's Shuiguo Sect, Mo Immortal Castle had been affected adversely; not only weren't they earning the slightest bit of revenue, they were even suffering ongoing losses.</p>

    <p>While Mo Immortal Castle was masquerading as an education institution, they also had other massive income chains, both legit and not. However, the above two incidents had cost Mo Immortal Castle almost five years' worth of gains as they had had to spend a lot of money to clean up their own mess...</p>

    <p>So in order to be able to continue operations, Mo Immortal Castle had also started to venture into the business of selling intelligence. Previously, Mo Immortal Castle had collaborated with other people by sharing information and trading intelligence for resources; who would have thought that big shots nowadays were becoming more and more cunning! Mo Immortal Castle might as well sell information directly for profit!</p>

    <p>In the huge office, the Lady sat on the sofa facing a young man in a white Daoist gown accompanied by a servant.</p>

    <p>This young man was a customer who had come to Mo Immortal Castle this time to buy information.</p>

    <p>He looked very young, but his skills and cultivation were a mystery. The Lady was quite close to the young man, and she noticed to her surprise that she couldn't hear him breathing at all - it was clear that this was a great senior.</p>

    <p>If this young man wasn't sipping his tea composedly at the moment, the Lady might have even thought that he was dead...</p>

    <p>His face was almost morbidly white; the Lady didn't know whether or not it was because the young man couldn't be exposed to the light, since the servant had been holding a black umbrella over him the entire time...</p>

    <p>Given that the Lord wasn't around and she couldn't determine the young man's exact realm, the Lady was noticeably a little nervous. "Senior Bai, is my price alright for you? If you think it's expensive, we can discuss it..."</p>

    <p>A piece of accurate intelligence cost five hundred thousand immortal gold bars; this was Mo Immortal Castle's current price for information.</p>

    <p>Some special intelligence might even cost a million immortal gold bars, which was almost equal to the costly price of a holy weapon.</p>

    <p>"My master only wants you to find a person, but you actually want us to pay five hundred thousand immortal gold bars?" the servant with the black umbrella said darkly.</p>

    <p>"I'm very sorry, Senior Bai, but this really is the price."</p>

    <p>Blushing, the Lady said, "Actually, we've had a lot of big clients come to us to buy information before."</p>

    <p>"Big clients? Is it possible to give me an example?" This Mr Bai smiled, the corners of his mouth tilting up slightly.</p>

    <p>"One of our previous big clients was Daoist Taotie, for example..." (Though he broke the contract halfway through.)</p>

    <p>"Daoist Taotie?" Mr Bai's expression changed slightly.</p>

    <p>"That's right."</p>

    <p>The Lady nodded and answered truthfully, "In addition, other people who have bought information from us before include the old devil and the Master of Immortal Mansion." (Though they were both arrested.)</p>
