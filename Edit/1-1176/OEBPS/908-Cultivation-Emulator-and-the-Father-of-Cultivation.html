  <h1>Chapter 908 Cultivation Emulator and the Father of Cultivation</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The funding and servers weren't a problem. As for the specific design of the game, Wang Ming would recreate the world's foundation and algorithms based on the outcomes of Book of Sage Immortal's trial simulation.</p>

    <p>It was just a game. Wang Ming had created so many fantastic magic artifacts over the years; even Head of State 001, the human replica magic artifact which was used for combat, was his creation. Designing these scientific cultivation magic artifacts was far harder than designing a game.</p>

    <p>After they had settled on a direction, the key now was the trial simulation.</p>

    <p>Gazing at the image projected by Book of Sage Immortal, Wang Ling became lost in thought.</p>

    <p>To be frank, he wasn't sure what kind of character to create.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Ming, who was operation Wang Ling Two remotely, suddenly said, "Looks like Ling Ling is still thinking about it. How about we recreate the world first? What is the world like in the tenth universe?"</p>

    <p>Book of Sage Immortal replied, "Each universe is slightly different, but though the level of cultivation civilization varies, most of them have already entered an era of universal cultivation."</p>

    <p>An era of universal cultivation.</p>

    <p>While it sounded amazing, this wasn't something anyone could have imagined tens of thousands of years ago.</p>

    <p>It was the father of cultivation who was the first person in the universe to discover the existence of spirit qi and walk down the cultivation path after turning it into spirit energy. The rumor was that it was also the father of cultivation who discovered and developed the Three Thousand Great Dao.</p>

    <p>But historians had argued since ancient times about the identity of the father of cultivation; there was even a small group who believed that there was no such person.</p>

    <p>They argued that from the moment a universe was born, there were already cultivators.</p>

    <p>But they were an advanced race who were very few in number. They lived very low-profile lives, and passed on the cultivation arts from generation to generation. With the gradual spread of cultivation all over the world, the number of cultivators increased, and after tens of thousands of years, the world finally entered an era of universal cultivation.</p>

    <p>The truth was that both sides had their arguments.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming believed in the view of a father of cultivation.</p>

    <p>Above True Immortal level was True Venerated, then Venerated Immortal, then Venerated Daoist... Then what was above that? Could there be a more powerful realm? Then, could the person with the greatest realm be the legendary "father of cultivation"?</p>

    <p>Or perhaps he wasn't the father of cultivation at all?</p>

    <p>Perhaps he could be called the Immortal King?</p>

    <p>Wang Ming smiled. "Since the ten universes have all already entered an era of universal cultivation, then can we try creating a world with few cultivators?"</p>

    <p>Everyone present was startled by this question.</p>

    <p>"A world with few cultivators? Brother Ming, what do you mean?" asked Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>"I'm talking about a world still dominated by regular people, and where only a small portion of the population is made up of cultivators. Furthermore, the cultivators have something like a pact where they can't expose their identities as cultivators to regular people; if they violate this agreement, they'll suffer heavenly punishment."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said: "Just imagine - if such a world exists, will the cultivators who live in the cracks ultimately be able to overtake the regular people and lead the world into an era of universal cultivation?"</p>

    <p>"So is this the comeback of spirit qi..."</p>

    <p>"No, spirit qi does exist in the world, and so do cultivators. What I want to know is, if 99% of the world is made up of regular people and 1% of cultivators, can this 1% thoroughly overtake this 99% with time?" said Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>At this question, Wang Ling sunk into silence for a while.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Miss Bai Qiao suddenly laughed; she had never considered this before.</p>

    <p>"Cultivation Emulator" was a sandbox simulation cultivator game which gave players a high degree of autonomy in creating a cultivation world; indeed, that sort of situation was possible - who said that the world had to be dominated by cultivators to begin with?</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao thought this was a very interesting proposal. "This sounds like an interesting world. In any case, it's just a simulation; maybe we can give it a try. Then, let's use this as the parameters for setting up this world."</p>

    <p>"So, can this be considered the world of my dreams?" Wang Ming also laughed.</p>

    <p>"That's right, the world's parameters have to be sorted out at the very beginning, like the proportion of cultivators to regular people, the men to women ratio, the initial world population and so on. Once the basic parameters are set, the game will officially begin."</p>

    <p>After receiving this first instruction, Book of Sage Immortal immediately set up the simulation.</p>

    <p>After putting the parameters of the world in order, Book of Stage Immortal pulled them up in front of everyone.</p>

    <p>[World: A barren cultivation world]</p>

    <p>[Age of the World: 4.8 billion years]</p>

    <p>[Regular People/Cultivator Ratio: 99/1]</p>

    <p>[Civilization: Modern]</p>

    <p>[Level of Education: Nine Years of Compulsory Education]</p>

    <p>[World Mode: Peaceful Development]</p>

    <p>[Power Index: 1231]</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Book of Sage Immortal: "You can now all design your own characters. They'll be born in this world, but how long they can live for and how much of an impact they will have on the world will depend on exactly how they are used once they enter the world."</p>

    <p>After that, character attribute charts appeared in front of everyone.</p>

    <p>These were the basic attributes that could be freely altered.</p>

    <p>The characters' appearances could also be modified.</p>

    <p>Looking at Jingke, Bai Qiao created a similar-looking character, but it was a girl.</p>

    <p>"All finished! A crossdressing version of Jingke! Hiahiahia!" Miss Bai Qiao was very pleased with herself.</p>

    <p>"Wow! They really look alike!" Zhuo Yi complimented her. "But Miss Bai Qiao... this looks just like yours and Lord Jingke's kid!"</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao instantly blushed. "Who - who'll have a kid with him?!"</p>

    <p>Gritting her teeth, she made the character's hair longer, then added an ahoge on the top of the character's head as she quickly corrected herself. "It doesn't look like him! I'm making a character of myself!"</p>

    <p>And so, Bai Qiao's character profile was the following:</p>

    <p><em>Character name: Bai Ge</em></p>

    <p><em>Gender: Female</em></p>

    <p><em>Intelligence growth factor: 8/10</em></p>

    <p><em>Endurance growth factor: 8/10</em></p>

    <p><em>Defense growth factor: 8/10</em></p>

    <p><em>Strength growth factor: 8/10</em></p>

    <p><em>Physique growth factor: 10/10</em></p>

    <p><em>Appearance growth factor: 10/10</em></p>

    <p><em>Good value: 10/10</em></p>

    <p><em>Evil value: 0/10</em></p>

    <p><em>Personality: Dumb</em></p>

    <p>"Why is everything 8, apart from appearance and physique?" asked Er Ha.</p>

    <p>"I already said I was making a character of myself, so of course the appearance and physique has to be like mine! As for everything else, I'm the strongest! There is no way any other girl in the world can be stronger than me!"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>"Master, what kind of person are you going to design?" Xiao Yin curiously asked at that moment.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was looking at the chart; he already had some idea in mind.</p>

    <p>He started to create his own character.</p>

    <p>Character Name: Qin Zong <sup>1</sup> ...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(The protagonist of the
author's new novel "The
Cultivation World's Only Koi .. ")</dfn>
