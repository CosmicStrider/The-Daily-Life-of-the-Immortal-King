  <h1>Chapter 1058 Wang Ling: Fortunately, It's Not Especially Difficult</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Songhai First Prison was on high alert at this sudden attack. Even though the outer defenses were well fortified, Bai Youquan was definitely prepared since he dared launch an attack at this moment in time.</p>

    <p>Boosted by the power of Fate Dao, the black shadow army's combat strength was already higher than that of cultivators with typical realms. Together with Shadow Brute's presence, this was the siege plan which Bai Youquan had deliberately come up with.</p>

    <p>Shadow Brute wasn't a real human, but a force split off from Fate Dao. Its shadow-like body was like that of a giant in the fairy tales, and carried an immense sense of oppression. An ill wind blew under the cover of that black shadow, tumultuously stirring up dust and clouds.</p>

    <p>"Team One, hold your positions! Team One, hold your positions! Team Two, attack! The prison is entering maximum defense mode! Lock up the prisoners! Don't let them escape!"</p>

    <p>Everything had happened suddenly, but fortunately, under Warden Liang's daily guidance, Songhai First Prison already had corresponding defensive measures in place.</p>

    <p>Every single prison guard carried out their duty, and the first round of defense and offense against Bai Youquan's black shadow army was underway.</p>

    <p>Some performed hand seals to reinforce the barrier while others left the barrier's secret exit to face the black shadow army in a bitter fight. They only had one task â€” to prevent the enemy forces from advancing in the shortest amount of time. They were to nip the other party's nefarious intentions in the bud!</p>

    <p>The purpose of this attack could be nothing else but a prison break. And it was in fact very clear why the enemy had chosen this moment.</p>

    <p>They were most likely here for the demon's lawyer, Wu Yuanji, as well as Father Zheng, Zheng Tianqiang.</p>

    <p>Warden Liang knew that the situation was dire, so he immediately hurried to lead the fight on the front line.</p>

    <p>He stood at the prison's entrance, and with a snap of his fingers, changed into the special leather armor combat wear for wardens. "Do we have confirmation on enemy numbers?"</p>

    <p>"Sir, there's too many of them! They have more than a hundred!"</p>

    <p>"They came prepared for this invasion!" Warden Liang immediately frowned. "Call the city office right away and request backup from the Police Bureau and the closest Immortal Arts Mobile Squadron!"</p>

    <p>"Yes!"</p>

    <p>After doing all this, Warden Liang turned his gaze to the gigantic Shadow Brute that was attempting to tear the barrier open.</p>

    <p>As the prison warden, Warden Liang could tell at a glance that this big guy was probably the toughest person to deal with at the scene.</p>

    <p>"Netherworld Chains!" With a wave of his hand, two chains immediately shot out of a rift in the air like swimming dragons. These chains moved according to Warden Liang's will, and they instantly crawled around Shadow Brute's limbs, wrapping it up tight!</p>

    <p>"You did it! As expected of Warden Liang!" The crowd buzzed with excitement as Warden Liang's participation instantly raised the morale of all the prison officers fighting.</p>

    <p>"This Netherworld Chains' Netherworld Flame has the ability to devour spirit qi. I heard that the Spirit Shackles were developed by referencing the Netherworld Chains... This big guy probably won't be able to escape," someone said.</p>

    <p>"Everyone, charge! Take down this bunch of invaders!"</p>

    <p>Wielding chains and brandishing immortal swords, the prison officers charged out in full force at the black shadow army.</p>

    <p>But from beginning to end, no one sensed the mastermind behind this battle, Bai Youquan.</p>

    <p>It looked like the black shadow army was on the brink of defeat, but in fact, this was all part of Bai Youquan's plan.</p>

    <p>As the group of prison officers were made up of prison officers from various areas, they were a more mature police force than the Immortal Arts Mobile Squadron. They were also the strongest government combat group in Huaxiu Alliance apart from the special armed forces. Bai Youquan wanted to test this claim, but the outcome was far more disappointing than he had imagined.</p>

    <p>Bai Youquan sighed softly and murmured, "We don't have time to fool around with them. Shadow Brute."</p>

    <p>His voice wasn't loud, but this call seemed to imbue Shadow Brute with even more formidable strength, and the entire black shadow army instantly fell into a frenzy the moment Bai Youquan spoke.</p>

    <p>"The Netherworld Chains... they're going to break apart!" Warden Liang's face drained of color. He never thought that the tables would instantly turn just as victory was within their grasp.</p>

    <p>" <em>Bang! </em>"</p>

    <p>Shadow Brute ripped the Netherworld Chains apart with its massive strength, instantly releasing an explosive force which sent countless prison officers flying in all directions like ants.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Although the black shadow army's offense was proceeding without a hitch, from beginning to end, no one noticed someone secretly observing the battle at the back: Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>He had allowed Bai Youquan to escape the last time. Now that the other party had appeared once again, Wang Ling definitely wasn't going to miss out on this rare learning opportunity.</p>

    <p>That was right...</p>

    <p>Fate Dao was a special type of Great Dao that Wang Ling had yet to grasp.</p>

    <p>It hadn't taken him more than a blink of an eye to learn Divine Dao the last time. But Fate Dao was more unusual, and Wang Ling needed more time to comprehend it. And the best way to achieve comprehension was to observe practitioners of Fate Dao up close.</p>

    <p>Hence, after roughly two minutes of silent observation, Wang Ling's furrowed brow finally relaxed.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, he had his own comment on the Great Dao known as Fate Dao: "Fortunately, it's not especially difficult."</p>

    <p>" <em>Shifu </em>, the situation isn't looking good!" While Wang Ling had been learning, Zhuo Yi had broken down with anxiety, and was feeling all sorts of emotions when he saw that the prison barrier was about to shatter.</p>

    <p>"Calm down." Wang Ling placated Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Then, he took a step forward and instantly teleported to the heart of the battle.</p>

    <p>Naturally, the first thing Wang Ling did wasn't to kill the enemy.</p>

    <p>Instead, he had to protect the prison officers.</p>

    <p>It was a good thing he had picked up Fate Dao quickly. Although the prison officers were at a disadvantage, the situation wasn't completely beyond saving.</p>

    <p>Several prison officers had passed out from their injuries on the battlefield. Curling his fingers, Wang Ling gathered all the unconscious combat officers in one spot and cast the Great Healing Spell, instantly healing their injuries.</p>

    <p>Far away, Bai Youquan was dumbfounded at Zhuo Yi's sudden appearance.</p>

    <p>This wasn't his first time clashing with Zhuo Yi, but he never thought that Zhuo Yi would have powerful magic.</p>

    <p>While Bai Youquan was still pondering, Wang Ling spread out his fair palm once again in the air. In a flash, the palm lines in his hand changed to form a high-level magic array in the air, which enveloped all the combat officers...</p>

    <p>This was a magic array that no one present had seen before. The runes on it were so abstruse and advanced that even Warden Liang was dumbstruck.</p>

    <p>He never expected Zhuo Yi to have such hidden depths...</p>

    <p>"Director Zhuo, this magic array is...?" Warden Liang asked.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling answered in Zhuo Yi's voice, "Tian Gang Infinite Health Array."</p>

    <p>What was that?</p>

    <p>Infinite Health Array?</p>

    <p>Warden Liang didn't think he had heard of this magic array before.</p>

    <p>But at that moment, one of Shadow Brute's sharp claws suddenly pierced Warden Liang's stomach...</p>

    <p>A bloody, gaping hole appeared in Warden Liang's abdomen.</p>

    <p>With the blood gushing out and his innards destroyed, Warden Liang's death should have been a sure thing.</p>

    <p>But the problem was...</p>

    <p>Warden Liang didn't feel any pain at all!</p>
