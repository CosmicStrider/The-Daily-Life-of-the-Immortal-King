  <h1>Chapter 835 Treatment Unit Number 13</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was August 11th on Friday in the fifteenth week of the semester.</p>

    <p>The exams for the first day of Number 60's first semester final exams were on literature, Dao talismans and operating a spirit sword. The Dao talisman exam was straightforward, and mainly involved writing down application formulas and reaction equations, while the exam for operating a spirit sword tested each student's ability to control one.</p>

    <p>It was compulsory for all Foundation Establishment high school students to skillfully master control of their spirit sword. Putting aside whether or not they could spawn their own sword spirit while in school, they had to know how to fly a sword by the time they graduated.</p>

    <p>The requirements in Grade One right now were more relaxed. Students just had to be able to direct the sword when it left their hands, and doing so within a 100-meter range was considered an excellent performance.</p>

    <p>Of course, this range was also related to realm. The farther away the sword was, the more spirit energy and stamina it consumed to control it. Generally speaking, the limit for a Foundation Establishment cultivator was between 150 meters and 200 meters; furthermore, they had to be specially trained to reach this limit. In the first year of high school, the best standard was 100 meters.</p>

    <p>The range for a Golden Core cultivator was larger, from 1,000 meters to 3,000 meters.</p>

    <p>Nascent Soul: 5,000 meters to 10,000 meters.</p>

    <p>Soul Formation: 20,000 meters to 100,000 meters.</p>

    <p>Given everyone's varying progress in cultivation, each person's range of control was different. Students who specialized in cultivating the spirit sword in university would have a much wider range of control after they graduated.</p>

    <p>Blademaster General Yi was currently ranked first in terms of range of control of a spirit sword, and was the only one on the list whose range was over a million meters.</p>

    <p>Of course, there were some experts among the people who disdained to participate in the ranking.</p>

    <p>Like Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Suppressed by the talisman seal, Wang Ling could fly a sword from one planet to another.</p>

    <p>He could even have Jingke go to the moon if he wanted.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had prepared well beforehand and was very confident when it came to these three exams.</p>

    <p>Given Grade One, Class Three's overall learning situation, Wang Ling had predicted what everyone's scores would be, and ultimately set a target to keep his marks down to an average score of 125 for these final exams. All the subject papers were graded out of 150 marks.</p>

    <p>125...</p>

    <p>It was a perfect score.</p>

    <p>Generally speaking, it was the kind of score that might make a parent frown, but all they could do was tell you to continue to work hard and get over 130 next time. A teacher certainly wouldn't have anything to say about this score: you couldn't say it was particularly bad, but it also wasn't worthy of praise.</p>

    <p>So in the end, students who got this score would most likely be left out when the teacher announced the grades.</p>

    <p>Thus, for Wang Ling, it wasn't the final exams that were hard, but the KTV that followed.</p>

    <p>He had prepared various game consoles that Wang Ming had made for him, which performed better than whatever was on the market.</p>

    <p>It wasn't that Wang Ling wanted to play games, but that he really didn't want to sing at KTV.</p>

    <p>So he chose to become part of the glorious "play dead" group by keeping his head down and playing his game.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>While Wang Ling had his own problems, elsewhere, Dharmaraja had also recently run into new trouble.</p>

    <p>After the establishment of the Office of Strategic Deception, Dharmaraja resigned from his job at the Xiao Family Compound and put his heart and soul into becoming the leader of the Office of Strategic Deception's logistics team. When he quit, the person-in-charge at the Xiao Family Compound even gave him a bonus.</p>

    <p>Of course, this bonus wasn't for Dharmaraja's sake, but because of the Office of Strategic Deception's reputation...</p>

    <p>Everyone knew that as the chief of the Office of Strategic Deception, Lord Diulei had advanced to True Venerated level not long ago; the entire nation and abroad saw the Office of Strategic Deception's momentum on the day of their founding ceremony. No one would dare offend a sect with such powerful influence. Dharmaraja resigned from his job at the Xiao Family Compound to join the Office of Strategic Deception, but conversely, the Xiao Family Compound was very happy.</p>

    <p>When HR recruited people in the future, they could use Dharmaraja as a gimmick to further expand their Xiao Family Compound's reputation â€” the park's infrastructure and logistical maintenance work had all been done by Lightning Dharmaraja, now the leader of the Office of Strategic Deception's logistics team. Although he had already resigned, he was in any case also a former employee of the Xiao Family Compound!</p>

    <p>Of course, apart from freeloading off Dharmaraja's name, if the Xiao Family Compound and the Office of Strategic Deception could work together in the future, Dharmaraja would certainly be their point of contact.</p>

    <p>This was how society functioned...</p>

    <p>When you quit your job, you would still think fondly of your old workplace if they treated you well.</p>

    <p>And so, Dharmaraja took a massive bonus with him when he left.</p>

    <p>However, he didn't expect a huge problem to pop up after he left with the bonus.</p>

    <p>There would always be colleagues at work who for some reason or other disliked you. Dharmaraja used to be the head of the logistics department. Now that he left, the people under him criticized him in all sorts of ways. The Xiao Family Compound management had a very clear attitude toward Dharmaraja's departure, giving him encouragement and support, and even an extra bonus. However, it was hard for Dharmaraja to stop people from shooting their mouths off... He didn't even know who he had offended at work before. In the last two days, there were posts everywhere on Weibo and in the cultivation forum slandering him.</p>

    <p>At the moment, Dharmaraja was complaining to Immortal Toya.</p>

    <p>"I just quit my job, but now the whole Internet is talking bad about me..."</p>

    <p>"What's going on, little brother?" Immortal Toya smiled. "You probably offended someone in your old unit, didn't you?"</p>

    <p>"I always thought my people skills were good..." Dharmaraja sighed.</p>

    <p>"You may know a person's face, but not his heart. You just left, and already someone started talking bad about you. Looks like the frustration was gathering for some time, and it exploded all at once." Immortal Toya: "What are they saying about you?"</p>

    <p>"Brother To, do you know there's another Dharmaraja on the Internet?"</p>

    <p>"Mm... I remember something like that."</p>

    <p>"Although I've always joked about that Dharmaraja, talking about electrotherapy for Internet addiction or whatnot... But I'm really not that Lightning Dharmaraja! I'm the successor of the godly thunder inheritance of the Thunder clan, and a genuine eight-star electrician! I'm licensed!"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "..."</p>

    <p>Lightning Dharmaraja: "Brother To, you don't know, but there was word online before about a place called Treatment Unit Number 13, which had a psychiatrist who claimed that he had developed medical equipment that could help treat kids for Internet addiction. The truth, however, was that it was a lie; they were locked in a holding room and given electric shocks. If they didn't admit their mistakes, they continued to be shocked..."</p>

    <p>"I know of this."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya frowned. "As far as I know, that Treatment Unit Number 13 didn't just treat children, but also took in a lot of adults. But wasn't it shut down later after it was exposed? Even that doctor's Weibo account was deleted."</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja sighed. "It's precisely because it was deleted that it's giving me a headache! Also, I bet that place is most likely still operating... That bunch of people online are saying that I'm that electrotherapist's alternate account!!"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "..."</p>
