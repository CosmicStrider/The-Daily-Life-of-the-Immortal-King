  <h1>Chapter 399 Suffer Because of a Lack of Culture! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>A lot happened that night...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, Xiao Yin's lonely journey back to Lord Diulei's villa was in fact not very peaceful.</p>

    <p>Somehow it felt like someone was following him. A holy beast's sixth sense was sharp and they were a hundred times more sensitive to danger than first-class spirit beasts. This group of people following Xiao Yin harbored ill will toward him, as the auras their bodies gave off stank. This was the "evil qi" specially given off by this bunch with bad intentions.</p>

    <p>After sensing that he was being followed, Xiao Yin quickened his pace and headed for a place with a lot of people as he tried to shake them off.</p>

    <p>He wasn't afraid of them, but he was afraid that his real identity would be exposed. If people found out that his true form was that of an eight thousand year-old silver unicorn... Xiao Yin couldn't imagine what the consequences would be. Therefore, what he was really afraid of wasn't people, but that his real body would be found out and become the target of malicious intentions.</p>

    <p>Moreover, this bunch of people was very patient and had been tailing him for a long time.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin calculated that this group had started following him from the moment he had taken the spirit bus to the subway.</p>

    <p>He didn't know which force they belonged to or their purpose... but the other party's target was very clear. In the subway station with so many people streaming by, they had been able to lock onto him precisely.</p>

    <p>What should he do?</p>

    <p>Find a deserted place and take action?</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was conflicted.</p>

    <p>Because after the Immortal Mansion incident and before Wang Ling had taken him out, they had made a provisional agreement that Xiao Yin wasn't allowed to make a move without permission. If he was ever exposed, it would all be over.</p>

    <p>Given the situation, it was better for him to ask for advice.</p>

    <p>Thinking this, Xiao Yin started to take a crazy winding route around the block to buy himself time to text the chat group; Lord Diulei had only pulled him in recently, and he had just learned to type not long ago. Usually when he was at home, Xiao Yin preferred to use the voice function, which was more efficient.</p>

    <p>But he was on a noisy block at the moment; it was so noisy that he couldn't even hear himself clearly, let alone use the voice function.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin had just tried it, and realized that anything he said became a string of electronic notes, which made it impossible to communicate normally.</p>

    <p>So the only thing he could do now was type... The point was that because he had only learned to do so recently, he was extremely slow!</p>

    <p>Besides, this keyboard was really too small; Xiao Yin felt that typing was very inconvenient.</p>

    <p>It might as well transform into a giant screen so that he could change back into his real body and stamp on it with his hooves!</p>

    <p>After going around the block for more than three minutes, Xiao Yin finally painstakingly finished typing out six words: "Someone, following me, what to do?"</p>

    <p>Soon there was a string of responses from the group.</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren: "Beat him up!"</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja: "Electrocute him!"</p>

    <p>Bulang Blade Immortal: "Chop him up!"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "Poison him!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>Only the few who had been involved in the Immortal Mansion incident knew of Xiao Yin's true form. When he had dragged Xiao Yin into the group, Lord Diulei had told the others who hadn't been involved that Xiao Yin was a distant relative of his, thus keeping the secret properly.</p>

    <p>Although everyone in the chat were comrades whom Lord Diulei had strictly vetted, the fewer who knew about Xiao Yin being a holy beast, the better. Thus, no one in the group would publicly announce his identity, and they just considered him a new brother in the group.</p>

    <p>And newcomers to the group would usually be teased...</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was anxious. He had spent three minutes typing six words... but this group of elder brothers and one elder sister actually hadn't taken him seriously at all!</p>

    <p>How should he respond in this event?</p>

    <p>Keep explaining?</p>

    <p>But it seemed that time was running out; the group behind him were watching him very closely. He had been going around the block over and over again as he typed, and they would definitely be suspicious.</p>

    <p>But if he sent emojis, those oldies in the group would take it even less seriously...</p>

    <p>Fang Xing was also in the group. He hadn't expected Xiao Yin to run into trouble at this time. "Seniors, don't play around with Xiao Yin. After he lost the bet back then, he promised Ling Zhenren that he wouldn't make a move so casually." This was Fang Xing's reminder to the people who knew of Xiao Yin's true identity. At the same, he firmly turned the agreement between Xiao Yin and Wang Ling into a bet for the sake of those who weren't in the know.</p>

    <p>This was the script they had agreed upon before Xiao Yin had joined the group.</p>

    <p>It was clear that Cailian Zhenren, Dharmaraja and the others were roused by Fang Xing's reminder. To be honest, they would have forgotten if it hadn't been for this reminder: as a holy beast, Xiao Yin couldn't freely take action without approval. Now that he was being tailed, this was indeed a thorny problem.</p>

    <p>In front of the screen, Xiao Yin was moved by Fang Xing's reply — his good impression of Fang Xing increased by 10086 <sup>1</sup> !</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(10086 is China Mobile's Customer Service Hotline.)</dfn>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren: "Where are you now, Brother Xiao Yin?"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin looked around and found a road sign that read — Bing Xian Da Xian Yan <sup>2</sup> Road.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(The joke here is that the road name 靐鱻龾鱻焱路 is made up of multistroke characters that are ridiculously hard to write ..)</dfn>

    <p>Xiao Yin was instantly overcome with despair.</p>

    <p>MMP! — What the fuck kind of road name was this?!</p>

    <p>He was already slow at typing, but the point was... he couldn't read these words at all!</p>

    <p>At this time, Fang Xing spoke in the group once again. "Brother Xiao Yin has just learned to use the chat software, so he's slower at typing. Brother Xiao Yin, open the settings in the chat interface; there's a location tab in there. Click on it, and it'll send your location, so we'll know where you are."</p>

    <p>Seeing this message, Xiao Yin was so moved his tears spilled out... <em>Brother Fang Xing knows me well!</em></p>

    <p>Following Fang Xing's instructions, Xiao Yin quickly sent his coordinates, and it just so happened that the road name was displayed in the group's chat window.</p>

    <p>Seeing the road name, the people in the group suddenly understood.</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren: "Oh... you're there."</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja: "I know this place. It sells tuning magic weapons and is incredibly noisy. In this neighborhood, anything you say will turn into electronic notes."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "...What do the characters say?"</p>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren: "Don't know."</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja: "Don't know."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was stunned. "..." A bunch of cultivators were suffering together because they lacked culture!</p>

    <p>Fang Xing: "It seems close to my place. How about I go take a look..."</p>

    <p>But just as Fang Xing said this, Lord Diulei suddenly came online.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Brother Fang Xing, you don't have to go. Brother Xiao Yin, you can act without worries; Ling Zhenren has already given his consent. Special cases need special responses. The group that's following you is from the Demon Hunters Association. It's very likely that they're high-level elders on the run. The best would be for Brother Xiao Yin to lead them to a secluded spot and get rid of all of them without exposing your identity."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin and everyone in the group sighed with relief when they saw this message.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, Xiao Yin still thought it was very strange. Why was this Demon Hunters Association targeting him? He had nothing to do with them at all! Even if this group of elders were looking for revenge, it didn't make sense to seek him out.</p>

    <p>But Xiao Yin was already unable to deal with that much for now.</p>

    <p>Now that Wang Ling had already consented to him taking action, he wouldn't be polite with this bunch behind him anymore.</p>

    <p>He had been feeling incredibly stifled these days!</p>
