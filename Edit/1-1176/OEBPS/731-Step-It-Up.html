  <h1>Chapter 731 Step It Up!!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Something was wrong with this Head of State 001.</p>

    <p>This was Wang Ming's first impression after making notes in his small notebook, and he was now entertaining the possibility that Head of State 001 had been switched. The current Head of State 001 was just too intelligent... In addition, it was vividly displaying a lot of minute expressions that had yet to be tested.</p>

    <p>That was a little unrealistic...</p>

    <p>Inside the military tent, Wang Ming carefully looked this slightly unusual Head of State 001 up and down.</p>

    <p>A moment later, Wang Ming suddenly shouted, "Activate! Super Transformation Mode!"</p>

    <p>The head of state froze for a moment. Did Head of State 001 have this operation?</p>

    <p>However, he forced himself to start the "Super Transformation Mode" at Wang Ming's request. After Wang Ming gave the order, the head of state's body suddenly shot up several inches and he turned into an impressive muscular man in front of Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>This... could be considered a Super Transformation Mode, right?</p>

    <p>But Wang Ming was struck by realization at this scene.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, there was something wrong with this Head of State 001!</p>

    <p>The original Head of State 001 which he had designed didn't have a Super Transformation Mode at all!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, the battle inside the fake remains continued.</p>

    <p>The Old Devil was indeed worthy of his name. As the age-old devil emperor who had plunged Huaxiu into black terror back then, and as a Tank mage with experience in close- and long-range battles, he very quickly began to churn out water talismans en masse.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, these water talismans were so powerful that one was equivalent to five of the original talismans!</p>

    <p>Those Huaxiu Alliance cultivators who were trapped in the deformed platelets' mucus were rescued with the water talismans one by one.</p>

    <p>General Bai, together with Master of Immortal Mansion Cheng Yu and Evil Sword God, hovered in the air; with these two people acting to protect him, General Bai was determining the range of his blast.</p>

    <p>In order to not get the innocent involved, General Bai immediately threw out a "Tight Net" from his sleeve after confirming that the last trapped Huaxiu Alliance member within explosion range had been successfully rescued.</p>

    <p>"Go!" General Bai manipulated the "Tight Net" into directly covering the heads of the platelets.</p>

    <p>This was a limited use magic artifact, just like the Three Views-Shattering Hammer which Wang Ling had specially made for Immortal Zhenyuan.</p>

    <p>But it would only work once.</p>

    <p>Immediately after the Tight Net was thrown out, a powerful net-like barrier was formed, which trapped all the seven abnormal platelets inside.</p>

    <p>General Bai's explosions had been restrained earlier when his allies had been trapped before.</p>

    <p>But this time, he would demonstrate his true art.</p>

    <p>Seeming to sense the heavy killing intent that had permeated the air, these seven deformed platelets that had been standing around foolishly started to roar one after another as they felt the incoming danger.</p>

    <p>This was also a direct signal to the summoner that they wouldn't be able to hold out much longer.</p>

    <p>Inside the underground barrier, Lord Anxiang, who heard the roars of the platelets, didn't even frown. He had known that it was impossible for the seven platelets alone to stop Huaxiu Alliance, especially since a True Immortal was in charge this time. Furthermore, it was Explosion Saint, the head of the Ten Founding Generals...</p>

    <p>Lord Anxiang was already quite satisfied that they were able to hold the other party at bay for so long.</p>

    <p>Next to Lord Anxiang, the expression of that cute and lovable lolita parent platelet changed dramatically at that moment, as whatever mental pressure the seven deformed platelets were feeling were ultimately transmitted back to the parent.</p>

    <p>The platelets were connected to the parent, so theoretically, the seven deformed platelets would survive as long as the parent wasn't destroyed... on the condition that there was something left of the seven deformed platelets. It didn't have to be much; just a little bit of cell tissue was enough for a full regeneration.</p>

    <p>But if these seven abnormals sustained severe damage and were wiped out all at once, then the parent would be implicated and die with them.</p>

    <p>"Almost done."</p>

    <p>Lord Anxiang knew at that moment that the platelets were mostly likely already about to be destroyed.</p>

    <p>So he concentrated even more.</p>

    <p>Just a little bit more... if there was a progress bar, 95% of the summoning was already complete.</p>

    <p>It was just another 5% before an army of white blood cells and macrophages would appear on the battlefield!</p>

    <p>All the Night Chief members inside the underground barrier shivered as they felt the powerful killing intent permeate the air. This power was too strong...</p>

    <p>Was this the power of a True Immortal?</p>

    <p>They had never directly faced the pressure from a True Immortal before.</p>

    <p>Even in Night Chief, the only people qualified to see Lord Night Ghost Spirit Emperor, who was also a True Immortal, were those big shot presidents who made up the organization's core and members of the command center.</p>

    <p>Most of them had never experienced the real power of a True Immortal.</p>

    <p>Thus, these Night Chief members couldn't help being scared witless.</p>

    <p>A True Immortal expert...</p>

    <p>Was this what it felt like to be oppressed by someone who had the strongest realm in the world?</p>

    <p>At that moment, they felt like children who had just come out of a mountain village to see the big world and were only just realizing how narrow their own horizons were.</p>

    <p>Compared with a True Immortal, they really were like a bunch of laughable frogs in a well...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The barrier was complete!</p>

    <p>In the air, General Bai took a deep breath and assumed a battle pose, ready to blow things up.</p>

    <p>Looking at this scene, many of his Huaxiu Alliance allies immediately knew that General Bai was about to "step it up"!</p>

    <p>Standing straight in the air, General Bai put his hands together. After a few seconds, a golden ball of energy gathered in his hands. Gripping this energy ball between both hands, he slowly brought it down by his waist, which was the standard pose for gathering power.</p>

    <p>"Ha meh! — Ha meh! —"</p>

    <p>In a short five or six seconds, the "qi" of heaven and earth immediately encircled this golden energy ball, which got bigger and bigger.</p>

    <p>"He's going to fire it!"</p>

    <p>A lot of people held their breaths as they watched this scene.</p>

    <p>The next moment, General Bai gave a roar, and the energy ball in his hand instantly turned into a great golden blast which shot forward like the Hyper Beam to strike the earth. In a flash, all the trees within a hundred-li radius were blasted to smithereens as a massive mushroom cloud rose up!</p>

    <p>The waves of thick smoke were securely trapped inside the "Tight Net" barrier.</p>

    <p>Many people who felt the violent tremors through the earth were indescribably frightened. If it wasn't for the "Tight Net" barrier, General Bai's blast just now might have impacted the area up to thousands of li away...</p>

    <p>And all of the fake remains would have been destroyed.</p>

    <p>After releasing this attack, General Bai sighed.</p>

    <p>He had already controlled the range of this blast, otherwise it would have wrecked at least seventy percent of the fake remains.</p>

    <p>Although these remains were fake, in order to capture the foreign party this time, a lot of resources had still been used to set up the remains.</p>

    <p>Thus, the fake remains were public property...</p>

    <p>As one of the Ten Generals, protecting public property to the best of his ability and ultimately recycling them for use were factors which General Bai had to consider.</p>

    <p>The protection of the environment!</p>

    <p>This was everyone's responsibility!</p>
