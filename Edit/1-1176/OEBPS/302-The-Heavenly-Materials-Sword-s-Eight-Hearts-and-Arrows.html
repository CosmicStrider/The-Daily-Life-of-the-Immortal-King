  <h1>Chapter 302 The Heavenly Materials Sword's Eight Hearts and Arrows </h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Heavenly Materials sword, this is my magnum opus!" Cheng Yu grasped the green sword, a confident expression on his face.</p>

    <p>He and Fang Xing looked at each other in the air. This sword's sword qi alarmed her. She felt that the sword was very special; there was something strange about it that couldn't be put into words.</p>

    <p>It wasn't long before Fang Xing figured out why it was strange.</p>

    <p>This sword was hollow, and didn't contain a sword spirit at all.</p>

    <p>It was a spirit sword without a sword spirit, but which had been made out of ultimate materials with ultimate craftsmanship.</p>

    <p>This was Fang Xing's first time seeing a spirit sword without a sword spirit.</p>

    <p>"This is the perfect sword body that I have created, but it lacks a soul." Cheng Yu slowly slid his fingers down the length of the sword, and it released imposing sword qi in their wake as highly dense fluctuations surged violently like an ocean.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing was utterly shocked. Enhanced by the White Night Spell and Immortal Mode, she had reached True Immortal level, and she could clearly perceive the nomological power that was pouring forth from this sword.</p>

    <p>It was actually a sword with nomological powers...</p>

    <p>Staring at it, she remembered that Master of Immortal Mansion Cheng Yu had said something about familiars earlier, and a thought suddenly struck her... If her guess proved to be true, then this familiar could be considered the most tragic one in history: after doing so much for its master, it had been ordered to kill itself.</p>

    <p>To become a familiar, one had to have been an Almighty in olden times. Anyone would be ashamed to face their descendants and elders by dying in this wretched way.</p>

    <p>"Most importantly, apart from its immense power, the nomological power of regeneration has been blended into my Heavenly Materials sword, making it indestructible." Cheng Yu opened his hand and levitated the spirit sword in his palm. A closer look showed that the hilt was actually fully inlaid with diamonds. Cheng Yu had deliberately not mentioned this point, as it felt like that would be bragging too much.</p>

    <p>It had taken him a full one hundred years just to create the sword hilt. The diamonds in it were all South African spirit diamonds that had been verified by appraisal specialists, and which were genuine Eight Hearts and Arrows diamonds <sup>1</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is the sign of ultimate
optical symmetry in a
precisely cut diamond.)</dfn>

    <p>"Since it was forged, this sword of mine has yet to taste blood. Today, it will feed on yours." Cheng Yu laughed coldly and intimidatingly. However, the chuuni way in which he said his words, like something pulled out of some novel, couldn't help but make people want to laugh.</p>

    <p>But frankly speaking, the Heavenly Materials sword he was wielding now was indeed a major deterrent, and at the very least, Fang Xing couldn't take it as easy anymore.</p>

    <p>"Go!"</p>

    <p>The Heavenly Materials sword shot off in a cloud of green light until it became an indistinct blur.</p>

    <p>Its speed was beyond Fang Xing's expectations; it wasn't the same type of trash as those hundreds of spirit swords earlier.</p>

    <p>Hovering in the air, Fang Xing released another burst of aura, and her level increased once again.</p>

    <p>She had been holding back before, and had deliberately avoided using all her strength. But now, the maiden Fang Xing could sense the strong threat which the sword posed.</p>

    <p>She tried her best to follow its movements. In the first round of attacks, the Heavenly Materials sword whizzed past her white earlobe as a sword light, taking several inches off her black hair.</p>

    <p>In the face of this sword, her doubly enhanced aura barrier wasn't any use at all.</p>

    <p>"There's no use running. No matter how fast you run or how hard you cry, no one is going to save you." Cheng Yu hovered in the air as he manipulated the Heavenly Materials sword into pursuing the girl.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing cursed in her heart; although her defense was invulnerable, this was still someone else's intrinsic spirit field. Even if she could in theory continue running like a perpetual motion machine with the supreme Immortal Mode and White Night Spell, that didn't mean that she wasn't consuming spirit energy at all.</p>

    <p>If she couldn't find a way to break through this problem, she would probably exhaust herself and die, as the Immortal Mode consumed huge amounts of spirit energy.</p>

    <p>And so, while she continued to evade the Heavenly Materials sword, Fang Xing was thinking of a solution.</p>

    <p>She made a lotus hand seal, and dozens of magical seals instantly materialized in front of her and then exploded like fireworks.</p>

    <p>A moment later, the scales that had been firmly inlaid into the black armor transformed into ten shadow daggers which then closed in on the Heavenly Materials sword.</p>

    <p>The White Night Spell's Black Victory armor wasn't only just for defense; in a desperate situation, it also had the means to attack. It was also a huge weakness, because once the scales on the armor turned into shadow daggers for an attack, the body's defense was significantly reduced.</p>

    <p>But Fang Xing had also noticed that when Cheng Yu was controlling the Heavenly Materials sword, he couldn't freely use the other spirit swords at the same time.</p>

    <p>The reason for this was simple: the Heavenly Materials sword didn't have a sword spirit. Without a contracted sword spirit, it was hard to operate it precisely by relying purely on a magic treasure contract.</p>

    <p>Hence, when he had taken out the Heavenly Materials sword, Cheng Yu had given up on using the intrinsic spirit field, so it was now just a solid boundary which was acting to keep trapped Fang Xing here.</p>

    <p>Given the situation, the best idea the girl could thus come up with was to sacrifice some of her defense and use Black Victory's shadow daggers to stall the Heavenly Materials sword while she waited for an opportunity to attack its owner.</p>

    <p>But in the next instant, to the girl's startlement, the Heavenly Materials sword split in two. One sword tangled with the ten shadow daggers and the other stabbed her directly in an unstoppable attack with destructive sword qi.</p>

    <p>It had been a trap!</p>

    <p>Fang Xing gritted her teeth hard. She had never expected Cheng Yu to have thought this far ahead; he had deliberately lured her into reducing Black Victory's defensive ability, thereby creating a gap in her initially invulnerable defense.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing's expression changed as the sword directly pierced her right collarbone, pinning her to the top of a distant glacier. Blood flowed from the wound, dripping onto the ice in lotus-shaped splatters, before freezing into blood ice.</p>

    <p>She coughed up more blood. After being struck by the Heavenly Materials sword, it felt like her organs were shaking inside her. She checked her jade palace meridian <sup>2</sup> , and realized that the sword qi was actually flowing along the spirit energy circulation path that had been created by the White Night Spell and the Immortal Mode, in order to penetrate her meridians and cause wanton damage.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is in the kidneys..)</dfn>

    <p>She was now trapped in a dilemma; if she continued using her supreme spells, the sword qi would destroy her body bit by bit. The only solution was to release both spells, but then she wouldn't be able to fight any longer.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing dropped to her knees on the ice, gritted her teeth, and let go of both magic spells in misery.</p>

    <p>The dark light around him gradually dispersed, and he was a young man once again.</p>

    <p>His lips and chest were stained with blood, and a fresh line trickled down from the corner of his mouth.</p>

    <p>"After all, you still aren't mature enough... wanting to take revenge for your father, you're too na√Øve."</p>

    <p>Cheng Yu laughed in the air, pleased. To him, everything was already over. He laughed cruelly as he gazed at Fang Xing. "Now that we've played enough, let me give you one last strike!"</p>

    <p>But just as he said that, a crack suddenly opened in the space in front of Fang Xing, and a child in a brown tunic over a white robe slowly walked out.</p>

    <p>Without making any moves, the child just gave a meaningful glance.</p>

    <p>That Heavenly Materials sword which had been about to stab Fang Xing actually turned around in the air straightaway.</p>

    <p>And then, without warning, it rushed straight at Master of Immortal Mansion Cheng Yu...</p>
