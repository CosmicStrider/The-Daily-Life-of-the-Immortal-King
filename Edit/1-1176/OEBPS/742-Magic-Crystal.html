  <h1>Chapter 742 Magic Crystal</h1>

  <div>

    <p>As both a competent bodyguard and a peeping devil, Zhai Yin's appearace was quite timely. Wang Ming was already inured to her stalkerish behavior - he only had to remember that wherever he was, Zhai Yin would be there...</p>

    <p>But her appearance also filled Ghost Head Blade with joy, since he now had another option.</p>

    <p>It was obvious that Zhai Yin, who was from the Magnificent Immortal Special Army Brigade, far surpassed Wang Ming in physical strength and various other aspects.</p>

    <p>This was an outstanding host body that was hard to come by, and was even several grades higher than his former lolita host. Ghost Head Blade was inwardly elated; if he obtained this body, and robbed Wang Ming of his big brain, he would be invincible.</p>

    <p>A dual host...</p>

    <p>This really wasn't unachievable, it was just that Ghost Head Blade had so far never found an opportunity.</p>

    <p>After snatching away this Zhai Yin's body and then seizing Wang Ming's brain, he could combine the two into one host body.</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade was suddenly struck by this bold idea.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>This was Zhai Yin's first time seeing Ghost Head Blade's true form, but she couldn't be any more familiar with this name. When she had still been in the Magnificent Immortal Special Army Brigade back then, she had once been assigned a mission to capture him.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, the mission had been a bust. Ghost Head Blade was just too sly, and even when he had been surrounded, he had ultimately still managed to escape arrest.</p>

    <p>For the sake of catching Ghost Head Blade in this failed operation years ago, codenamed "Ghost Hunt," one of the members of the Magnificent Immortal Special Army Brigade had even died in the line of duty. It became an unsolved case for which there had been no reasonable explanation until now.</p>

    <p>When Zhai Yin, hiding underground, had heard Ghost Head Blade reveal his true form, she already thoroughly understood what had happened back then.</p>

    <p>At that time, Ghost Head Blade had probably abandoned his former host and had forcibly formed a contract with the colleague who had died in the line of duty, fooling everyone before escaping in the end.</p>

    <p>There was really too little space inside the military tent. Zhai Yin had tried breaking through Ghost Head Blade's barrier from under the ground, but unexpectedly hadn't been able to do so.</p>

    <p>Given Ghost Head Blade's weak form, it should have been impossible for him to erect such a powerful barrier.</p>

    <p>Hence, in this head-on confrontation with Ghost Head Blade, Zhai Yin appeared extremely cautious, as she was sure that this Ghost Head Blade definitely had another card up his sleeve.</p>

    <p>In the blink of an eye, Ghost Head Blade launched another round of attacks.</p>

    <p>His target was Wang Ming, which he knew was a disadvantage for this female special soldier as she had to protect Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>Clang!</p>

    <p>There was the crisp sound of metal colliding.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin swiftly drew out a tactical army knife from her boot and met Ghost Head Blade in a clash of blades. As Ghost Head Blade attacked non-stop, Zhai Yin completely fended him off with the tactical army knife. She brandished it so fast that it turned into a string of afterimages in Wang Ming's eyes, like countless waving tentacles.</p>

    <p>"You're from Magnificent Immortal, right? I haven't seen this blade technique in so long," Ghost Head Blade said nonchalantly as he attacked.</p>

    <p>Since his true form was a pitch-black dagger, he didn't feel any pain no matter how Zhai Yin slashed at him.</p>

    <p>After all, he was a fragment of an ancient blade. Nevertheless, to use a mere tactical army knife to deal with him was really too naïve.</p>

    <p>"So it was you back then..."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin frowned and was deeply aware that her army knife wasn't much use against Ghost Head Blade.</p>

    <p>Continuing to stall absolutely wasn't an option. In a fight like this, the biggest concern was exhausting stamina. In this form, Ghost Head Blade could ignore wasting energy or sustaining injuries, but she couldn't.</p>

    <p>Moreover, Zhai Yin now had to create a clone to protect Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>At that moment, she was under the greatest pressure.</p>

    <p>However, protecting Wang Ming was her mission.</p>

    <p>Even if it was at the cost of her own life...</p>

    <p>"Vanguard Blade!" At that moment, Zhai Yin's eyes darkened as she bit her finger hard and smeared some fresh blood on the tactical army knife in her hand.</p>

    <p>The next moment, she tossed it into the air, and it transformed into a blade array which then created countless shadows that surrounded her and Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>This way, Ghost Head Blade's scheme directed at Wang Ming most likely wouldn't work.</p>

    <p>But this blade array wouldn't last for very long.</p>

    <p>Before it shut down, Zhai Yin had to think of a countermeasure to finish off Ghost Head Blade in one strike.</p>

    <p>Extenuating circumstances called for extenuating measures; she was already no longer in a position to capture him alive, especially since Wang Ming's safety was being threatened. What she had to do was directly execute this hoodlum.</p>

    <p>But contrary to Zhai Yin and Wang Ming's expectations, when Ghost Head Blade saw Zhai Yin's glowing blade array, he actually ceased his crazy and fierce attack.</p>

    <p>"It looks like it's time." Ghost Head Blade laughed sinisterly.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin glared at him. "What do you mean?"</p>

    <p>As soon as she said this, Ghost Head Blade's body emitted spirit light.</p>

    <p>All of a sudden, a purple polygonal crystal appeared in the air.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin's eyes instantly widened. "This is..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming didn't say anything, but he already knew what this crystal was - this was currently the latest technology that had been developed, whether at home or abroad, and which had yet to be made public: magic crystal technology!</p>

    <p>Using talismans as its base, this was new technology for storing particular high-grade spells in crystals made from special materials.</p>

    <p>And the magic crystal in Ghost Head Blade's hand happened to contain a level seven spell!</p>

    <p>He couldn't stop smiling coldly. "Lord Night Ghost Spirit Emperor already foresaw risks on this trip and so formulated a plan for them; even the commander President Dylan was kept in the dark about it, and I'm the only one whom Lord Night Ghost Spirit Emperor communicated with."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin: "What the hell do you want to do?!"</p>

    <p>"That trash group in the fake remains sacrificed their cells to summon a cell army - what if I bring that entire army to these remains?"</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin's expression was unsightly. She knew about the situation with the cell army in the fake remains. If they were all transported here, it would be chaos! All the students would be in danger!</p>

    <p>Holding the magic crystal, Ghost Head Blade laughed. "Let me tell you another thing: this magic crystal is one of a pair developed exclusively by Night Chief. It uses a spatial array for transmission. Have you heard of the Sea And Sky Array?"</p>

    <p>Sea And Sky Array?</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin frowned and glanced at Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "I don't know it... I only know the Sea and Sky Party<sup>1</sup>!"</p>

    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A literal translation of 海天盛宴, which refers to the scandal of "sex parties" which happened at a Hainan lifestyle and yacht expo in 2013.)</dfn>
    
    <p>Zhai Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>"Lord Ghost Head Blade, they're already preparing to fire from the Heavenly E-Satellite to wipe out the cells."</p>

    <p>At that moment, the voice of that Lord Anxiang came out of the purple magic crystal.</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade: "Unfortunately, it's already too late."</p>

    <p>As soon as he said this, he directly crushed the magic crystal on the spot.</p>

    <p>In a flash, dense lines of runes swiftly spread out like a cobweb from Wang Ming's military tent in the center.</p>

    <p>The Sea And Sky Array was also called the Hundred-Li Sea And Sky Array.</p>

    <p>It could teleport anything within a hundred-li radius in an instant.</p>

    <p>Of all level seven spells, this was the most powerful transmission array!</p>
