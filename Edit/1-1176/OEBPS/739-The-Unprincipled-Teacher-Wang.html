  <h1>Chapter 739 The Unprincipled Lao Gudong Xiaoer</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was still July 24th on Monday in the fourteenth week of the semester.</p>

    <p>It was supposed to be time for the evening picnic, but the planned infiltration of the real remains by the foreign force Night Chief together with the Dark Network members it had hired eventually ended with the capture of all the members, one of whom was turned into paste.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling somehow had a premonition that things weren't so simple...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>That night, Wang Ming received a new assignment from the command center, which was to collect a DNA sample from Ghost Head Blade, who had turned into paste, and perform a data comparison to verify Ghost Head Blade's real identity.</p>

    <p>Initially, it would have been quite easy to do the data comparison if Head of State 001 was around. Wang Ming would just need to put a little of the paste sample into Head of State 001's mouth, and it would automatically identify the DNA based on its built-in database.</p>

    <p>But the situation now was that this Head of State 001 was the real head of state...</p>

    <p>No matter how gutsy Wang Ming could be, there was no way he could put paste inside the real head of state's mouth!</p>

    <p>So in the end, he had to do it himself...</p>

    <p>He sent the head of state away by having it enter "Patrol Alert Mode." Furthermore, Wang Ming didn't plan to call the head of state back before the end of this summer camp.</p>

    <p>When was work the most stressful?</p>

    <p>When the boss was around, of course...</p>

    <p>Huaxiu Cultivation Academy of Science was an official institution, and who was the boss of an official institution? Old Qi? Of course not... Strictly speaking, Old Qi himself was also an employee.</p>

    <p>It was the head of state who was the ultimate big boss!</p>

    <p>But Wang Ming truly never expected the head of state to participate in this summer camp in Number 001's place... The head of state had faked it very well, but a few discrepancies did exist. If Wang Ming hadn't noticed these flaws, he would very likely have still been in the dark.</p>

    <p>Then this was now the question... Where on earth had the Head of State 001 which he had invented run off to, to carry out a mission?</p>

    <p>But Wang Ming guessed that only Old Qi would be able to answer him.</p>

    <p>To be able to trick him and cause him to almost screw up so badly... even if Old Qi wasn't the mastermind, he absolutely had had a hand in it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming had almost become the laughingstock of the whole academy...</p>

    <p>He stared at the paste in front of him and wiped his sweat as he pondered, feeling a growing sense of post-traumatic stress — it was a good thing he was so quick-witted!</p>

    <p>Then, he took out a small silver-gray magic ball and used the spirit energy stored inside his ring to open it. The magic ball spun in the air like a top, and eight robotic arms swiftly extended out of it like a crab.</p>

    <p>This was an experimental all-purpose assistance robot Wang Ming had invented, with the codename Crab.</p>

    <p>"Prepare to extract a sample." At Wang Ming's command, Crab promptly stretched out one robotic arm to scan all of the paste.</p>

    <p>In the end, Crab's ball body immediately turned red after the scan.</p>

    <p>This was a warning color which indicated that there might be foreign matter in the sample.</p>

    <p>After that, Wang Ming saw one of Crab's robotic arms instantly turn into a pair of tweezers and then pick out a black blade from the paste!</p>

    <p>This was...?</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was almost instantly on guard. He had a bad feeling that this blade was dangerous.</p>

    <p>In his next breath, the blade actually turned into a stream of light in front of his eyes that darted toward him. By the time he came back to his senses, there was already a cut on his cheek.</p>

    <p>"On guard!" Wang Ming broke out in a cold sweat.</p>

    <p>He knew things weren't that simple!</p>

    <p>As an assistant, Crab naturally had defensive abilities to a certain extent.</p>

    <p>After Wang Ming gave the command, Crab promptly stretched out one robotic arm to try and control the blade.</p>

    <p>The robotic arm swung out extremely quickly, but the small blade was faster — Crab's cooldown period was too long!</p>

    <p>There was a resounding clang of metal colliding, and two of Crab's robotic arms snapped off.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming grit his teeth. It looked like things were now starting to become dangerous and troublesome!</p>

    <p>This pitch-dark blade was probably the final hand which Ghost Head Blade had left behind.</p>

    <p>Just like a viper whose head was still extremely poisonous even after you killed it and cut its head off — if you were just a little bit careless, you could still be bitten.</p>

    <p>But what happened next made Wang Ming feel like his thinking had really been too simple...</p>

    <p>Because this blade, actually spoke!</p>

    <p>"His Excellency finally isn't with you..." When this pitch-dark blade spoke, its voice didn't sound like Ghost Head Blade's, but its manner of speech was the same.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming narrowed his eyes slightly, cold sweat rolling down his face. "You are?"</p>

    <p>"I'm Ghost Head Blade." The pitch-black blade continued speaking: "No one knows that this is my true body... I once sold my soul to the spirit of an ancient blade, and I turned into this fragment... As for the body you saw earlier, that was just my host. That cute little lolita was the most compatible host I'd found; it's a pity that His Excellency crushed her to paste just like that..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "..."</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, the small blade gave a cold smile. "Hey, hey! But it doesn't matter; that little lolita's shelf life was short anyway, and the main thing is to find another body."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was surprised; there was actually an expiry date.</p>

    <p>"The kid you're rooming with seems pretty good!"</p>

    <p>"Then go look for him... why look for me?!"</p>

    <p>It was Ghost Head Blade's turn now to be taken aback. Wasn't that person his student? How could a teacher be so unprincipled?</p>

    <p>No wonder Huaxiu Alliance had always been unable to determine Ghost Head Blade's true identity. Huaxiu Alliance was helpless as long as the other party kept changing hosts. In some sense, this trick of Ghost Head Blade's was more troublesome than that of Myriad Faces Old Man, who was an expert at transformation in the Dark Network.</p>

    <p>That was to say, even if Wang Ming could test for the paste's DNA, he still wouldn't be able to pinpoint who on earth Ghost Head Blade was...</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade: "Alright, now that you know everything about me... if you don't want me to kill you, you have two options."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming suddenly clutched his chest. "What... What do you want to do to me?!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade calmed his thoughts and said to Wang Ming, "First, use your skills to undo the seals on both the Night Chief and Dark Network members. Second, you become my new host..."</p>

    <p>"You still want me when I'm so weak? That's not very good..." Wang Ming's eyes widened in astonishment.</p>

    <p>"The key isn't the host's abilities - as long as someone signs a host contract with me, even if the host is just an ordinary person, he can acquire cultivation abilities... The only drawback is that the body's shelf life will be greatly reduced if an ordinary person becomes my host."</p>

    <p>"Then all the more reason I suggest you don't choose me as your host."</p>

    <p>At that point, Wang Ming suddenly looked solemnly at Ghost Head Blade.</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade: "???"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming spread his hands. "I'm afraid you won't be able to keep up with my IQ."</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade: "..."</p>

    <p>Did this guy, want to die?</p>
