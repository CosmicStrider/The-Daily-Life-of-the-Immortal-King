  <h1>Chapter 351 Extra Skills Are No Burden for the Man Who Roams the World </h1>

  <div>

    <p>While Wang Ming and Zhuo Yi were still tangled up in the business with Chou Shisi, Wang Ling naturally wasn't being idle.</p>

    <p>Getting Wang Ming to use the Heavenly Materials sword to save those students was one thing, while Wang Ling's job was to mediate the conflict between two epic-level killers. After all, he had accepted Killer Taoist's gift back then, and Wang Ling understood that he should return the favor... To be honest, he really didn't want to get involved in this matter, but his hands had been unable to control themselves back then!</p>

    <p>After learning that Wang Ming's group had gone to deal with Xiao Yuncheng, Wang Ling immediately went to Second People's Hospital; if his theory was correct, Taoist Taotie would definitely do something big here tonight.</p>

    <p>This also aligned with what Wang Ming had deduced earlier in the car.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yuncheng was just a delay tactic. The spirit explosion caused by just one student wasn't enough to do much. But if the hospital were to fall into enemies' hands and all the students here exploded at the same time, most of Songhai city would be thrown into disaster.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling teleported to a park nearby Second Hospital, then slowly approached its main gate.</p>

    <p>At that moment, there was already a SWAT team holding anti-explosion magic shields as a barrier at the entrance to Second Hospital's independent zone. It wasn't just at the gate; SWAT teams patrolled nearby streets and even swept dark alleys with spotlights.</p>

    <p>Special times called for special measures; anyone who was the least bit suspicious would immediately be noticed.</p>

    <p>Hence, before coming here, Wang Ling had specially asked Immortal Toya to get in touch with Director Li.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had just reached the gate when Director Li, who had been waiting at the entrance for a long time, came striding up to him.</p>

    <p>As usual, he was wearing a white coat, and an ID card hung around his neck. After seeing Wang Ling, the first thing Director Li did was to give him a staff ID and a white coat similar to what he had on. These had been prepared well beforehand, and were things that Immortal Toya had gotten Director Li to arrange; from Wang Ling's appearance to his identity, the whole package was complete.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at the staff card in his hands. On it was written: Wang Hua, Chief of Psychiatry Department, Second Cultivation People's Hospital Independent Zone .</p>

    <p>"..." The corners of Wang Ling's mouth twitched instantly.</p>

    <p>This was obviously a fake name... but why had he become the chief of the psychiatry department?</p>

    <p>"Please forgive me, Ling Zhenren; we had a colleague who transferred out, and he just happened to be from the psychiatry department," Director Li whispered to him. "If we didn't arrange this identity for you, you would be easily found out."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded and didn't say anything more.</p>

    <p>Then, Director Li pulled two surgical masks out of his pocket, and after putting them on, the two of them entered the hospital easily enough.</p>

    <p>The SWAT team at the entrance didn't ask any questions since they already knew Director Li. Seeing him come to the entrance to personally greet Wang Ling, they thought that this was some specialist who had rushed over from home. Previously, when the specialists had received the request for their consultation, almost all of the doctors who had returned to the hospital from home had been personally greeted by Director Li. Thus, the SWAT teams didn't think there was anything suspicious about it.</p>

    <p>If anything, what was suspicious was that Wang Ling looked too young.</p>

    <p>Thus, he thought it was very like Director Li to think of preparing these masks.</p>

    <p>Right now, it wasn't just doctors and nurses here at Second Hospital; there were also many teachers from Number 60 High School. It would definitely be troublesome if they recognized him here.</p>

    <p>"Let me give Ling Zhenren a rundown of the current situation."</p>

    <p>As he led Wang Ling to the separate building, Director Li gave him a simple accounting of the current situation. "All the students who ingested the fruit have already been grouped according to class and school. After consultation with the specialists, we've developed a preliminary reagent in the short time we have to curb the production of spirit energy and to reduce the density of spirit potential inside the body. But as Ling Zhenren has probably heard, this reagent will only be effective at the most until the day after tomorrow."</p>

    <p>When he said that, he couldn't help sighing. "To be honest, not a single person knows what will happen then."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded his head. The incident this time might appear very terrible and dangerous, but in fact, as long as Taoist Taotie stopped causing trouble and Wang Ming hurried to the hospital with the Heavenly Materials sword, it would all be over. Wang Ling's one concern was whether Taoist Taotie had some trick up his sleeve.</p>

    <p>Director Li led Wang Ling to the elevator and scanned his staff ID as verification before he could press a button for one of the levels. This was to prevent the mentally ill patients from escaping. Without a hospital staff card, no one could take the elevator or even the fire escape down.</p>

    <p>According to the setup in Second Hospital's independent zone, the harder the cases were to treat, the higher the levels that the patients would be on.</p>

    <p>This time, Director Li directly pressed the button for the highest floor, the thirtieth floor. All the students who had ingested the fruit had been sent there.</p>

    <p>Director Li: "At the moment, some of the students are in an unstable frame of mind, and half an hour ago, we asked the city office for assistance. The first batch of psychiatrists arrived before you did."</p>

    <p>While they were talking, the lift doors slowly opened, and Wang Ling saw a familiar figure in front of him. It was a thin and tall young man. He had just accepted a white coat from a nurse and was looking at her with a wide grin. "What is the situation with the children now?"</p>

    <p>The female nurse replied, "The director is already personally overseeing the ones that are harder to deal with. Doctor Song, you are responsible for the children in wards 12 and 13. We will have to trouble you to look after them."</p>

    <p>Doctor Song patted his chest confidently. "No problem, just leave them to me!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>This familiar figure with the familiar voice and trademark white teeth... Sure enough, it was Lie Mengmeng!</p>

    <p>It was only later that he found out that it was Lie Mengmeng's university professor who had recommended him here. Lie Mengmeng had studied psychology at university, and previously had even resolved the old man's mental issue.</p>

    <p>The female nurse nodded, infected by his positive attitude. "Doctor Song, do your best! But I don't understand... why aren't you working directly in the field of psychiatry?"</p>

    <p>The female nurse: "Then... what happened?"</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng: "I later realized, I don't get even half a penny."</p>

    <p>The female nurse: "..."</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng: "But actually, I feel it's pretty easy work. The salary is just so-so, but I can make some easy, extra money on the side with jobs like this!"</p>

    <p>The female nurse: "..."</p>

    <p>"It's like one particular author on our website: he writes books, songs, lyrics and plays, and even produces cartoons and videos. Although it doesn't seem like he's doing his actual job, he actually gave us a profound reason for it."</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng stared at the female nurse and said, "Extra skills are no burden for the man who roams the world!"</p>
