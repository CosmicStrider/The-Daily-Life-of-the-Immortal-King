  <h1>Chapter 1088 Protect Lotus Society and Warrior Union</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling never expected that what he was most concerned about would actually happen... Plus, it happened so suddenly that it caught him off guard.</p>

    <p>It was just that this Single's Curse bug wasn't as complicated as the previous ones.</p>

    <p>Looking at the current situation, the bug had probably infected the next person to confess, but wasn't as widespread as the most serious infection the last time. This time, it spread in one direction â€” that was to say, it started with Sun Rong, and when Student A confessed to Sun Rong, the curse would be passed on to Student A. Then, if Student B confessed to Student A, the curse would be passed on to Student B.</p>

    <p>Thus, after discovering what the problem caused by the curse was, Wang Ling's first response was to have a look at what this guy who had confessed looked like.</p>

    <p>He was actually quite good-looking; he was elegant and had clean and fair skin, and was probably the type that little girls liked.</p>

    <p>In other words, it was possible that someone else would confess to this bro...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling couldn't help but sigh inwardly.</p>

    <p>A confession... more like a game which members of the Appearance Society played all year round.</p>

    <p>If this Single's Curse was attached to an ordinary-looking person, there was basically no possibility of it being passed on to others...</p>

    <p>This bug was actually very simple; it wouldn't cause especially severe damage, and it wouldn't continue to spread as long as no one confessed to this bro in the next three days.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling was still cautious and silently planned to keep this brother under observation.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The next day, 6th November, this bro who had yelled he disliked Sun Rong in public became an absolutely hot topic.</p>

    <p>He was revered as a "warrior" and his name began to spread in every class.</p>

    <p>"My god, this Xia Ming really has the nerve. Yesterday, he told Sun Rong he hated her to her face. I guess he doesn't want to continue studying in Number 60 High."</p>

    <p>"Hey hey hey, really? When did this happen? Why haven't I heard about it?"</p>

    <p>"You left too quickly after school yesterday and missed the show. Classmate Sun Rong was stunned at first, and I heard that she got so angry that her face turned red!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling learned that bro's name from the discussion in class.</p>

    <p>Xia Ming...</p>

    <p>Of course, Wang Ling didn't believe that Sun Rong was narrow-minded enough to do anything to Xia Ming for his rudeness yesterday. But if Xia Ming really suffered "retaliation," Wang Ling would still make a move.</p>

    <p>After all, this had happened because of him, and it was his responsibility to deal with subsequent issues and the aftermath.</p>

    <p>He would have to see how this thing developed.</p>

    <p>Early in the morning, Number 60 High's little gossip expert Guo Hao arrived at school and waited for Sun Rong to come to class to ask about the situation.</p>

    <p>Since she was the second party involved in the incident with Xia Ming yesterday, what her classmates cared about the most was her attitude toward it.</p>

    <p>But unfortunately, it seemed that Sun Rong had asked for a leave of absence today - Classmate Sun Rong, who had always been punctual, unexpectedly didn't arrive at school on time.</p>

    <p>"It's over, it looks like she's pretty angry." Collecting everyone's homework, Su Xiao gave a deep sigh. "Offending Classmate Sun Rong... He might be caught by her bodyguards and thrown into the river..."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao was also baffled at the way things had turned out. "Can anyone tell me what Sun Rong's reaction was like yesterday? I left early and didn't see it! I heard from people in the other classes that she was so angry she almost exploded?"</p>

    <p>"She's never been humiliated in public like that before - she definitely must have blown her top! I heard that her face was red all over and she left without saying a single word."</p>

    <p>"Then, what about Xia Ming?"</p>

    <p>"Xia Ming? After he was done speaking, he passed out on the spot."</p>

    <p>"Passed out?" Everyone was taken aback. What kind of bizarre behavior was that?</p>

    <p>After saying words that shook the heavens and made ghosts and gods weep, he had scared himself into passing out... This bro had talent!</p>

    <p>"In short, neither Classmate Sun Rong nor Classmate Xia Ming have yet to give any sort of explanation after the incident yesterday. On the other hand, Classmate Xia Ming has won a large number of supporters. Currently, our school's Protect Lotus Society and the Warrior Union which supports Student Xia Ming are evenly-matched, and are unable to deal with each other." Su Xiao summarized the current situation.</p>

    <p>Protect Lotus Society and Warrior Union...</p>

    <p>These were two student organizations which had been set up after Sun Rong entered Number 60 High. As its name clearly suggested, the Protect Lotus Society was specially founded by a group of boys who didn't have the guts to confess to Sun Rong, but were willing to become her secret protectors and fans.</p>

    <p>The Warrior Union was the complete opposite; they comprised a group of warriors who had already confessed to Sun Rong and were rejected...</p>

    <p>So, the main reason the Warrior Union was set up was to wreak havoc.</p>

    <p>Any guy who had a connection with Sun Rong would suffer retaliation.</p>

    <p>For example, those senior boys from Wang Ling and Sun Rong's one-on-one tutoring session last time were members of the Warrior Union.</p>

    <p>Their attitude was quite clear.</p>

    <p>If they couldn't get the person they wanted, then no one else could!</p>

    <p>At the same time, their attitude toward Sun Rong was ambivalent: they liked her at first, and then hated her after being rejected. It was a very complicated mix of love and hate.</p>

    <p>Yesterday, Xia Ming from the class next door had accomplished a magnificent feat which shook the heavens and made ghosts and gods weep; it instantly roused the feelings of the bunch in the Warrior Union.</p>

    <p>If things carried on like this, Wang Ling reckoned that Xia Ming would soon become the president of the Warrior Union.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Xia Ming and Fang Xing were from the same class, Class Two, and no one was clearer about Xia Ming's situation than Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>Xia Ming had been "gathering strength" for an entire semester, and had finally summoned his courage to confess to Sun Rong - he never thought that the words he said would actually be the complete opposite of what was in his heart.</p>

    <p>Xia Ming was crushed, and felt as if he had been bewitched.</p>

    <p>As a result, he didn't dare speak at all, and for one moment, even thought about transferring schools.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing saw all this.</p>

    <p>In fact, he could almost guess the whole story.</p>

    <p>He had come to Class Three's door several times to furtively gauge Wang Ling's reaction through the window, only to find Wang Ling as calm as usual.</p>

    <p>How would this matter finally wrap up?</p>

    <p>Fang Xing was curious.</p>

    <p>He knew that Xia Ming's current condition was caused by a curse. The problem was that it was Wang Ling who had created this curse. Unless someone knew how this curse worked, no one would be able to dispel it.</p>

    <p>Actually, it wasn't as if there was no way to dispel the curse.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling just needed to confess to Xia Ming, and the curse would rebound off him, thus bringing this matter to an end.</p>

    <p>But just thinking about it, there was absolutely no way that this would happen.</p>

    <p>The words "love confession" didn't exist in Wang Ling's vocabulary.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, Xia Ming was a boy.</p>
