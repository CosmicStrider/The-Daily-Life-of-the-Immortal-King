  <h1>Chapter 959 Help From the Cultivation Forum</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling had still been very young when he first met Lord Diulei, but to his surprise, the seeds of their relationship had already been planted when he was four years old.</p>

    <p>The cultivation forum...</p>

    <p>This type of place which was specially for comments on gossip in the cultivation circle was indeed visited by many sect leaders and major players. But did this group of people really read novels? And online novels, to boot? Everyone was a little skeptical.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, they recalled that it was quite troublesome to register for an account on the cultivation forum. They had to answer a lot of questions about Dao, plus there was a time limit for each question. If you ran out of time, it would count as a wrong answer. There were a hundred questions in total, and you couldn't get a registration invite code unless you answered eighty questions or more correctly.</p>

    <p>It might seem like a lot, but a senior cultivator would be able to choose the right answer with their eyes closed.</p>

    <p>It was clearly impossible right now to compete with that Lady Thirteen, who was a crazy rich person on the Cultivation Reading Website, unless Father Chen used all his family's savings. However, he was sure that if he took the money out, his woman would chop off his hands and make him kneel on a washboard.</p>

    <p>Father Chen dropped his forehead into his hand and felt that it might not be time to give up yet. "Alright, let's give it one last try. We'll start by signing up for an account first. I'll answer the questions, and you'll be responsible for helping me look up those that I can't answer." Father Chen was pretty confident in the hand speed of these group leaders. After all, they were all still single, and their hand speed over the past few decades wasn't just for show...</p>

    <p>In an era of national cultivation, people remained single for longer as the lifespans of cultivators had increased on the whole.</p>

    <p>A Foundation Establishment cultivator could live up to 200 or 300 years old, and these people in front of Father Chen were all eligible bachelors who were each nearly a hundred years old.</p>

    <p>"This is the only thing we can do now! Let's give it one last try!" Lin Gang was encouraged by Father Chen. In this way, this group of people started to give it their all to register for an account on the cultivation forum.</p>

    <p>Father Chen opened the registration page, and the one hundred questions appeared immediately, comprising fifty multiple-choice questions and fifty yes/no questions.</p>

    <p>The questions got harder and harder going down the list.</p>

    <p><em>Question 1 (multiple-choice): When a cultivation forum staff member pays you a visit, what will they say specifically to confirm their identity?</em></p>

    <p><em>A: Chris, close the door <sup>1</sup> </em><em>.</em></p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is from an incident where another player threatened to kill pro gamer Lu Benwei, who told his coach Chris to lock the doors at their club ..)</dfn>

    <p><em>B: I'm here to repair your air-conditioning.</em></p>

    <p><em>C: Hello, I'm from the cultivation forum, my work ID is XXX.</em></p>

    <p><em>D: I, Lu Benwei, truly didn't cheat.</em></p>

    <p>Father Chen deliberately didn't answer, but looked at his watch. The two-minute time limit had already started counting down.</p>

    <p>"How is it? Difficult?" asked Lin Gang.</p>

    <p>"It's supposed to get progressively harder. This first question is general knowledge on security, and is still very easy," Father Chen replied.</p>

    <p>The first question was relatively simple. He chose "C" and the page immediately went to the next question.</p>

    <p><em>Question 2 (multiple-choice): Wang Xiaoming is a Foundation Establishment cultivator. While training, he accidentally falls off Purgatory Cliff. Wang Xiaoming weighs 90kg and the cliff is 10,000 meters tall. As he falls at a rate of 10 meters per second, he hits and breaks two trees growing out of the cliff at an angle in succession before he speeds up again. In addition, Wang Xiaoming tries to grab at rocks jutting out of the cliff face as he's falling off the cliff, but never succeeds. What is Wang Xiaoming's final cause of death?</em></p>

    <p><em>A: He was scared to death.</em></p>

    <p><em>B: He fell to his death.</em></p>

    <p><em>C: He died from hitting a tree.</em></p>

    <p><em>D: He died from poison.</em></p>

    <p>Father Chen: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "..."</p>

    <p>"Fuck! Is this something a human can answer?! This isn't just a small increase in difficulty!" Father Chen clutched his head and couldn't help cursing. His brain felt like it was hurting.</p>

    <p>"It's D!" Next to him, Lin Gang had already swiftly found the answer thanks to his hand speed.</p>

    <p>"Why?"</p>

    <p>"It's Purgatory Cliff! The entire cliff is covered in a toxic miasma throughout the year. Hitting two trees in a row reduces his speed and cushions his fall, so he won't die after falling to the bottom. However, he will definitely die from poison," Lin Gang explained.</p>

    <p>After hearing this, Father Chen realized he had almost run out of time, and quickly picked the answer.</p>

    <p>Then it was the third question. In order to save time, Father Chen read it out loud as he analyzed it.</p>

    <p><em>Question 3 (yes/no): Everyone knows that the Soul Swap Spell is a powerful demonic secret spell. The soul of a person under the spell will swap places with the soul of the closest person for a short period of time. The spell can only be broken by a third person kissing one of them. Wang Xiaoming's girlfriend and mother are watching </em>Temptation of the Devil <em>, but this film disc has a demonic magic array carved into it.</em></p>

    <p><em>As soon as the show's male protagonist says the phrase "You're so coy," the two women are hit by the "Soul Swap Spell." To break the spell, fast-thinking Wang Xiaoming knocks his girlfriend's body unconscious and kisses his mother...</em></p>

    <p><em>Question: After this incident, will Wang Xiaoming survive?</em></p>

    <p>Father Chen: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "..."</p>

    <p>Very quickly, Lin Gang found the answer. "The answer is no!"</p>

    <p>Father Chen: "His mom was in his girlfriend's body and he knocked her out and kissed his mom, meaning that he kissed his girlfriend. Isn't that the right thing to do?"</p>

    <p>Lin Gang: "The explanation online is: he knocked his own mom out for his wife, and after his mom woke up, she began to quarrel with his wife. In the end, the male character couldn't take it any longer and jumped off a cliff to his death... Oh, that's right, we've already answered Question 2."</p>

    <p>Father Chen: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>By the time Father Chen completed all the questions, it was already six o'clock in the evening.</p>

    <p>Because Father Wang had done his best with his chapter updates, his monthly votes had increased by quite a bit during this period. However, he was still behind Zhu Ge, who ranked first. The gap now was: fifty thousand votes...</p>

    <p>Father Chen and the others looked at the list and knew that Zhu Ge had officially started to go all out. After eleven-thirty that night, Zhu Ge would continue with another strong wave to secure his position.</p>

    <p>"This is our last hope."</p>

    <p>Father Chen spent several hundred yuan right away to become an annual member on the cultivation forum. Soon after that, he sent a promo excerpt of the novel which he had prepared earlier to the cultivation forum, along with a link to the official version and the first few chapters which were free.</p>

    <p>To Father Chen's surprise, he very quickly got replies to his post.</p>

    <p>Sect Leader of Heavenly Xuan Sect Han Ren: "WTF?! Even novel ads are showing up in our cultivation forum now? Is the administrator going to do something about this? @I Am Uncle Cat."</p>

    <p>I Am Uncle Cat was the ID of the forum administrator.</p>

    <p>Very quickly, more and more people began to @ I Am Uncle Cat, asking him to delete the post.</p>

    <p>Sect Leader of Star Killer Sect Song Kaihua: "I don't read online novels. Their plots are all the same and are the most boring. Hurry up and delete the post! @I Am Uncle Cat."</p>

    <p>Founder of Tyrant Earth Sect Zhang Zhide: "Someone actually dared advertise something in our forum? @I Am Uncle Cat."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"What now... Should we withdraw first? And send it again after a while? If this ID is banned, it's over for us. Even if the ban is just for a few hours, it's not worth it," Lin Gang said when he saw the situation.</p>

    <p>"Let's wait and see..." Father Chen was also very nervous.</p>

    <p>A few minutes later...</p>

    <p>The administrator called Uncle Cat appeared.</p>

    <p>He posted a reply: "Ah... sorry for the late reply, everyone, it was mainly because I was reading this novel just now... Actually, I think it's pretty good..."</p>

    <p>Many people sent him question marks: "???"</p>

    <p>But very quickly, Father Chen saw that the people who had asked for the post to be deleted earlier actually deleted their original replies.</p>

    <p>Sect Leader of Heavenly Xuan Sect Han Ren: "WTF! It really is very good! Don't delete the post! I want to read it!"</p>

    <p>Founder of Tyrant Earth Sect Zhang Zhide: "It's actually different from the online novels that I know of? Let's study it a bit..."</p>

    <p>Sect Leader of Star Killer Sect Song Kaihua: "Mm... so delicious!"</p>

    <p>Father Chen and Lin Gang: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "..."</p>
