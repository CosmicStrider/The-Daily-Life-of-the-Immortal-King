  <h1>Chapter 1055 The Secret Of Frozen Dumplings</h1>

  <div>

    <p>During the second hearing, Fu Fusheng finally admitted to everything: from plagiarizing Student Zheng Jingxuan's earlier works for the competition to betraying the biggest mastermind, Liu Yi.</p>

    <p>Although Liu Yi was already dead and dead people didn't have to take responsibility for their crimes, that didn't mean civil damages didn't have to be paid out.</p>

    <p>Father Zheng's requests were very simple: He demanded that Raven Studio, under Liu Yi and Fu Fusheng, compensate him 365 million yuan, which was the total profits the studio had illegally made from Student Zheng's early magic treasure designs, and that the studio apologize publicly to the late Zheng Jingxuan, to restore his reputation.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Father Zheng asked that the compensation be made into an additional award in the magic treasure design competition and be called the "Jingxuan Award," to encourage genuine participants to create original magic treasures.</p>

    <p>The court approved this compensation request.</p>

    <p>Chief Judge Liang Xin banged the gavel.</p>

    <p>And so, three years later on September 21st, the thirty-eighth day of the summer break, the plagiarism case which tore apart the Zheng family was finally completely overturned.</p>

    <p>Additionally, the police officers, judges and jury who were responsible for hearing the case back then all received disciplinary warnings.</p>

    <p>It was a fact that they had caused the Zheng family distress by ruling in error when the facts weren't clear and the evidence was lacking.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, this also proved that the judicial system was fair, and reflected the courage to take responsibility, to own up to mistakes, and to ascertain the truth.</p>

    <p>The false charges from three years ago were done with and Father Zheng's family problems were resolved. For Wang Ling, however, the Wang family's "problems" had only just begun.</p>

    <p>He received a text message from Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>It was about the "frozen dumplings" which Father Zheng and that devil's lawyer Wu Yuanji had both mentioned.</p>

    <p>Director Zhao of the General Police Bureau suspected that someone was planting drugs in the dumpling filling, and thus attached great importance to their origin and source, which forced Wang Ling to get serious about it.</p>

    <p>What he could be sure of at the moment was that Mother Wang did buy some frozen dumplings suitable for pregnant women some time ago, but it had been an impulse buy. When she later came back to her senses, she returned a portion of the goods, which included the box of frozen dumplings.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's "Great Enlightenment Spell" had the power to turn the rotten into the miraculous. He had enlightened the tricycle, the microwave, and the toilet - a while ago, he had even enlightened his own bedroom door.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling wasn't bored enough to use such a mystical Heavenly Dao spell to enchant a box of frozen dumplings...</p>

    <p>There was nothing wrong with the dumplings; why would he enchant them?</p>

    <p>And if he did, so what?</p>

    <p>Would they become as crunchy as crispy noodle snacks?</p>

    <p>Would they give you Water Margin hero cards when you ate them?</p>

    <p>No!</p>

    <p>Since they couldn't, why would he enchant them...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling also paid special attention to the origin of these dumplings.</p>

    <p>What happened to the box of frozen dumplings that had been sent to his place? Wang Ling felt he had to get to the bottom of it.</p>

    <p>To sum up the changes in Father Zheng and Wu Yuanji after they ate the frozen dumplings:</p>

    <p>The first was the abnormal increase in their realms.</p>

    <p>Both of them almost reached the Nascent Soul stage after eating the dumplings.</p>

    <p>It was a direct leap to a major realm.</p>

    <p>Under normal circumstances, a cultivator couldn't advance from the Golden Core to the Nascent Soul stage without hundreds of years of practice.</p>

    <p>Second and most importantly, Zheng Tianqiang and Wu Yuanji both gained powers related to shadow, and there might be some sort of connection.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling quickly thought of this possibility.</p>

    <p>To confirm his guess, Wang Ling quickly replied to Zhuo Yi. To verify it, he had to see Wu Yuanji and Zheng Tianqiang at close range.</p>

    <p>But it was impossible for Wang Ling to go in person. He was only a 16-year-old high school student. Even if Zhuo Yi could get him in by taking advantage of his position, it might reflect badly on him if word got out.</p>

    <p>So, Wang Ling came up with an unusual method...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Zhuo Yi stared at Wang Ling's astonishing response on his phone with an amazed expression on his face. "Possession?"</p>

    <p>That was right.</p>

    <p>In order to get close to Wu Yuanji and Zheng Tianqiang, Wang Ling decided to use an old method â€” long range body possession. This was a Heavenly Dao spell based on the Great Soul Merging Spell, whereby Wang Ling could freely select a person to possess. At the same time, however, this spell was very risky, and it was very dangerous for Wang Ling to possess someone else's body, unless it was a blood relative or someone he had a very close rapport with.</p>

    <p>This was because Wang Ling's soul was too strong, and not every corporeal body would be able to endure his "torment." If the body couldn't house the soul's power, it was possible that the body would explode.</p>

    <p>The reason why Wang Ling chose Zhuo Yi was very simple.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi had already been his disciple for several months, and they had a pretty close master and disciple relationship. Most importantly, all the cultivation techniques Zhuo Yi was learning now were from Wang Ling, so Wang Ling estimated that there was a very low risk to Zhuo Yi's body.</p>

    <p>Besides, even if some danger popped up, Wang Ling could think of a way to regenerate Zhuo Yi's body... In any case, Zhuo Yi was one of his own, so it wasn't a big deal if something went wrong.</p>

    <p>But it was different if Wang Ling were to possess someone else. Wang Ling might be able to solve the problem if something went wrong, but he could still hurt the other party.</p>

    <p>This was Wang Ling's first time possessing someone, and also Zhuo Yi's first time being possessed by Wang Ling. The last time Zhuo Yi's body had been taken over was when he had received Jingke's power. Actually, that couldn't be considered a true fusion, and was just a simple body control spell. Furthermore, Zhuo Yi's consciousness had still been present then.</p>

    <p>But possession was different.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi would have no memory of the time he was possessed by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thus chose his words carefully and sent these points of caution about possession to Zhuo Yi; he thought Zhuo Yi would be intimidated by these distinct side effects. This was a body possession, after all - not everyone could stand the feeling of a foreign intrusion of their body.</p>

    <p>Some people would even experience stress symptoms for a long time after being possessed, such as vomiting, fatigue, a high body temperature, increased trips to the toilet, and irritability... That was right, these stress symptoms were similar to early signs of pregnancy...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was worried that Zhuo Yi might refuse, so he told him all the possible side effects.</p>

    <p>But who the hell knew, Zhuo Yi this guy seemed especially excited.</p>

    <p>" <em>Shifu </em>, when are you coming over?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Hurry up, <em>shifu </em>! I can't wait! You must always remember that as your most beloved disciple, I will always have a place in my body for you!!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
