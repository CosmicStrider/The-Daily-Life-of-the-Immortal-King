  <h1>Chapter 836 Wang Zhen's Curse</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Treatment Unit Number 13 was an online mystery that was rumored to have been shut down after it was exposed back then; in fact, this Internet addiction treatment center hadn't closed down.</p>

    <p>Even as Dharmaraja complained to Immortal Toya, he was actually well aware that he could only suffer this abrupt online antagonism toward him in silence. Online users nowadays were too easily led around by the smallest public opinion, and there was a lot of resentment online toward the Internet addiction treatment center. Plenty of people, anonymous or otherwise, had posted long articles detailing their experiences upon entering this Net rehab center.</p>

    <p>The parents who sent their children there all had the same traits. For example, they didn't have much education, they spoiled their children too much, they wanted to control their children too much, or they believed that as long as their children could be fixed, there was no harm in using a little force...</p>

    <p>After this was exposed, Treatment Unit Number 13 was shut down a few years ago following public outcry, but the truth was that this mysterious treatment center had been running in secret the whole time...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>A middle-aged man wearing an eye patch sat in his chair inside a dimly lit office, which already had some cracks in its gray wallpaper. His hair was thinning and he had a greasy middle-aged look about him. There was a slight depression in his skill, as well as scratches on his face, which were actually old wounds.</p>

    <p>This was an office and also a treatment room.</p>

    <p>The layout inside was very simple. Apart from an office table, there was a rectangular table made from black iron and covered in a thin plastic film, which looked very exquisite. Several shackles had been installed on the sides of the table for restraining movements.</p>

    <p>The man didn't wait long at his office table before a young man slowly walked in. The young man was wearing an extraordinary Daoist robe in a very exotic style; it had layers upon layers of folds like Michelin tyres. Furthermore, two things that looked like antenna stuck out of the top of the young man's head.</p>

    <p>"Welcome, Mr Long Ming, welcome..." Seeing that the young man had come, the middle-aged man quickly got up.</p>

    <p>"The venue Dr Yang chose was deeply hidden; it took my master a while to find it." Long Ming raised his eyebrows and then asked, "Well, will you accept my master's conditions?"</p>

    <p>"I have long heard of Venerable Bai's great name. Each of Venerable Bai's conditions was aimed at my weakness, so I have no reason to say no."</p>

    <p>There was a bitter smile on the man's face. "It's just that someone already appraised my injury a long time ago, and concluded it can't be healed... Even with plastic surgery, I'll still slowly revert back to my current appearance. This is a hereditary injury. Honestly speaking, I'm very surprised that Venerable Bai actually has a way to treat it."</p>

    <p>"Naturally, you don't have to worry about my master's strength."</p>

    <p>Long Ming said, "But I have some questions about Dr Yang's injury. You say you were born with it?"</p>

    <p>"Correct."</p>

    <p>Yang Huai nodded. "Our family has been running this operation for forty-two generations. But in the thirty-sixth generation, my ancestor was severely beaten up: his face was scratched into a pulp, a lot of his hair was pulled out, and even his eyeballs were knocked out... I heard he was even kicked in the head at that time."</p>

    <p>Long Ming: "..."</p>

    <p>Yang Huai: "But that's the weird part. After my thirty-sixth generation ancestor, Yang Yong, was beaten up like that, my thirty-seventh generation ancestor Yang Xing was born with the same face... Since then, this hereditary disfigurement has been passed down like a curse until the forty-second generation, me. Until now, there has been no way to cure it."</p>

    <p>"Then does Dr Yang have any impression of the man who kicked the dog head... ah, no, the head of your Yang family's thirty-sixth generation ancestor?" Long Ming frowned, feeling that it was odd.</p>

    <p>If Yang Yong was simply beaten up, it shouldn't impact the next generation...</p>

    <p>It was obvious that while he was being thrashed, he also suffered a curse.</p>

    <p>But how many people in the world could cast such a powerful curse?</p>

    <p>"I have very limited information on my ancestors. That's because my Net rehab center was vandalized repeatedly a few years ago, and some little bastards even set fire to my office when they left, burning almost all the information." Yang Huai sighed. "When my ancestors ran the Net rehab center back then, it was during its heyday, when it was a domineering force... Many sect leaders even relied on us to rectify the inappropriate behavior of some of their disciples. We didn't just treat Internet addiction; as long as there was something wrong with them, we could fix it."</p>

    <p>Long Ming nodded, then turned his gaze to an unprepossessing-looking medical device on the side. "Is this the machine you use?"</p>

    <p>"Mr Long Ming should have already experienced it in the big treatment room?" Yang Huai laughed wickedly.</p>

    <p>"Yes." Long Ming nodded. "I tried it on the maximum setting earlier, but its effect wasn't obvious."</p>

    <p>"Mr Long Ming's realm is very high, so naturally you felt nothing."</p>

    <p>Yang Huai smiled, waved his hand, and said, "But that is just the lesser medical device. The ultimate medical device is the one here in my office which Mr Long Ming is looking at."</p>

    <p>Long Ming: "Oh?"</p>

    <p>"I once treated a cultivator at the Soul Formation stage with this device, which is the highest realm I've treated. Under my treatment, the electricity sent him to seventh heaven."</p>

    <p>Speaking up to this point, his face suddenly became serious. "Art - that's what the electroshock is."</p>

    <p>Long Ming asked curiously, "Why was he sent here?"</p>

    <p>"People are sent to me for a variety of reasons, such as puppy love, or an obsession with mahjong or games - some even come to me because of unhappy marriages, for electrotherapy to fulfill their needs."</p>

    <p>Yang Huai chuckled with a vulgar expression on his face. "That Soul Formation cultivator who was sent to me was actually a deputy sect leader at first, but unfortunately he didn't get along well with the sect leader as both of them always had different views on the sect's overall situation and the path it should take. But this deputy sect leader was always very cautious in handling matters, so the sect leader was never able to find any dirt on him. However, if you always walk on the river bank, how can your shoes not get wet?"</p>

    <p>Long Ming: "Then how did he end up getting sent here?"</p>

    <p>Yang Huai: "Last Mid-Autumn Festival, the sect wanted to send mooncakes to all their business partners, and the deputy sect leader was responsible for ordering them. Unexpectedly, he ordered several carloads of five-nut mooncakes."</p>

    <p>Long Ming: "... What's wrong with five-nut mooncakes?"</p>

    <p>Yang Huai: "Doesn't Mr Long Ming think that the five-nut filling is very disgusting? For example, I like the Po Li seaweed filling <sup>1</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Refers to the widespread
opinion online that five-nut
mooncakes taste bad ..)</dfn>

    <p>Long Ming: "..."</p>

    <p>Yang Huai: "Unfortunately for this deputy sect leader, he didn't have time to figure out what was going on. When he woke up, he was already on my treatment table. I still have the video, would Mr Long Ming like to watch it?"</p>
