  <h1>Chapter 260 The Forty-Meter Broadsword Can't Be Put Back </h1>

  <div>

    <p>The forty-meter large steel broadsword stretched directly down the center of the sports field, its bluish-gray surface still reflecting the light from the sun... What kind of image was this? The broadsword looked like a weapon which had been left behind in the human world by an ancient demon god â€” at a glance, it gave off a very heavy air.</p>

    <p>Everyone was silent.</p>

    <p>Teacher Ye also took a deep breath. "Student Fang... does your broadsword not have the ability to contract?"</p>

    <p>During the manufacturing process, many large weapon types would be implanted with a functional "contraction talisman" to ensure that the blade could be carried around. Based on common sense, this forty-meter broadsword should be able to contract.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, Fang Xing shook his head. "This is a legacy which my father left to me. I heard that when it was being forged, the smith had been going through heartbreak, and had been so upset that he had started to suffer intermittent dementia; at the most critical step of making the broadsword, he didn't put in the contraction talisman."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>For some reason, Wang Ling felt that this Fang Xing's experience was very similar to his. He remembered how much effort it had taken to cure the old man of intermittent dementia back then.</p>

    <p>Teacher Ye broke out in a sweat. "Then Student Fang Xing can use a teaching spirit sword this time... However, for the sake of the school's PE class, it would be best for Student Fang Xing to be equipped with a spirit saber or a spirit sword of a normal size."</p>

    <p>"Yes, Teacher Ye."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing nodded, accepting this advice cheerfully. "Then... Teacher Ye, can you put my broadsword away for me?"</p>

    <p>The corners of Teacher Ye's mouth twitched. "Can't you put it away yourself?"</p>

    <p>Fang Xing sighed. "It's very hard to put my forty-meter broadsword back once I've taken it out... so I don't generally draw it out in ordinary times."</p>

    <p>Teacher Ye wanted to cry but had no tears to shed: "..."</p>

    <p>The broadsword fully weighed six thousand jin . When he raised it, he was unable to balance it properly. The spirit light in a storage space had an automatic acceptance function. As long as one part of an item entered the storage space, the whole item would automatically be recognized and received inside.</p>

    <p>But when this forty-meter broadsword was placed on the sports field, its hilt was suspended over two meters in the air from the ground because its body was too large.</p>

    <p>In the end, Teacher Ye went to get another PE teacher from the office, and together they lifted the broadsword and slowly put the hilt into Fang Xing's school uniform pocket.</p>

    <p>The scene looked a little strange, but somehow Wang Ling felt that this Fang Xing seemed to be hiding something.</p>

    <p>Because when the broadsword was being put back into Fang Xing's pocket, Wang Ling was acutely aware of Jingke vibrating slightly in his hand.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Because of this broadsword, the PE class was delayed, and the warm-up before the official lesson only happened fifteen minutes later. Number 60 High School's sports field was small, and one lap was just four hundred meters. During the warm-up, Teacher Ye would usually ask the students to jog four thousand meters for four minutes while controlling their swords, which meant ten laps.</p>

    <p>But because of the earlier delay, Teacher Ye raised the requirement this time, giving the male students two minutes and the female students three minutes.</p>

    <p>It already wasn't easy to jog and control a sword at the same time; now they had even less time to do it, which made a bunch of the male students complain miserably.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling jogged in the middle of the line. He didn't feel much from this kind of Formation Establishment stage basic training, and he just considered himself an exercise partner. Furthermore, he didn't need to control Jingke at all because the latter had its own consciousness.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao ran at the head of the line as he led the male students. Although he looked exhausted, it was obvious that he could still continue running. Before entering Number 60 High School, Chen Chao had already been a sports-oriented student, and had far better stamina than most of the people here.</p>

    <p>In contrast, Guo Hao's entire head was already soaked in sweat by the fourth lap, and it looked like he was about to fall behind.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao was big-hearted and easygoing; jogging wasn't a problem for a Formation Establishment cultivator, but controlling a sword at the same time was much more demanding. When they had used the teaching spirit sword during the warm-up, it had been quite challenging for Guo Hao. Now that they had to maneuver their personal spirit swords as they ran, their consumption of spirit energy would increase dramatically.</p>

    <p>Of course, Wang Ling, who was just behind Guo Hao, could have helped him run a little easier with just a thought. However, this could hurt the other boy instead; the Foundation Establishment stage basic training exercises were still quite important, since the foundations which the students built now would be directly related to the development of the upper limits of their future realms.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Wang Ling didn't do anything throughout the warm-up.</p>

    <p>On the seventh lap, Wang Ling noticed that the students around him were already drenched in sweat, so he immediately channeled his spirit energy into condensing the moisture in the air onto his skin to make it look like he was sweating a little.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, it would really be too strange if everyone else was sweating while there wasn't even a single drop on him.</p>

    <p>After two minutes of jogging, Guo Hao straightaway collapsed on the ground, gasping for breath. Chen Chao braced his hands on his knees, then kicked Guo Hao's leg to make him get up and walk around for a bit.</p>

    <p>After that, the girls' warm-up jog was also over. Except for Sun Rong, the rest of them didn't look very good.</p>

    <p>A little bored, Wang Ling took a break as he sat to one side. Most of the people on the sports field looked like they were dying from exhaustion, except for him... and Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>After ten laps, Fang Xing wasn't flushed, nor was he gasping for breath, which surprised Teacher Ye. This transfer student's physical strength was very good. Even if he had been jogging with a teaching spirit sword, it still shouldn't have been this easy. And most importantly, he had deliberately given the male students a time limit.</p>

    <p>"Student Fang has good physical strength!" Teacher Ye couldn't help praising.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing rubbed his head bashfully and said very modestly, "In my old school, the school building was at the foot of a mountain, and I had to take twenty thousand steps to class every day. Maybe I was trained during that time."</p>

    <p>"So that's it." Teacher Ye nodded. He had heard of Fang Xing's school, which was the strictest aristocratic boarding school in Jinghua city, Tianshi Imperial High School.</p>

    <p>"Your time is outstanding!" Teacher Ye looked at the blue notebook and the stopwatch in his hands.</p>

    <p>He had just recorded down the times: in the last three laps, Fang Xing had obviously sped up and directly passed Chen Chao at the head. He had been the first to finish the warm-up, and overall had been faster than Chen Chao, taking just a minute and a half to complete it.</p>

    <p>"The district sports meet will be held in two weeks. I want you and Student Chen Chao to be our male school representatives and participate in the sword control relay." Teacher Ye stared at Fang Xing as he made this request.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, Fang Xing instantly agreed. "No problem, Teacher Ye."</p>

    <p>"Do you think you have enough spirit energy if you switch to jogging with a normal spirit sword? How about we try it out after you've taken a break?" Teacher Ye asked.</p>

    <p>"Okay, Teacher Ye." Fang Xing nodded readily.</p>

    <p>"Then I'll help you borrow a spirit sword!"</p>

    <p>Teacher Ye looked around. "Is there anyone who would be willing to lend their spirit sword to Student Fang Ling?"</p>

    <p>"No need, Teacher Ye, I'll borrow it myself."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing smiled and waved his hand.</p>

    <p>Then, Wang Ling saw this person walk step by step toward him.</p>
