  <h1>Chapter 812 Official Announcement Style</h1>

  <div>

    <p>For one moment, the air froze at Wang Han's appearance. No one expected this royal host, who often hosted state ceremonies, to show up at the celebration ceremony for the founding of a sect. At the same time, Lu Youming was even more terrified - he sensed that there was a huge amount of power behind this Office of Strategic Deception, so huge that just thinking about it made him feel like he had been electrocuted.</p>

    <p>It could only be said that Lao Gudong Han was in the end Lao Gudong Han.</p>

    <p>In front of so many sect big shots and the media, he was able to demonstrate his calm and professional hosting ability.</p>

    <p>He wasn't even holding a script, but instead already knew all the proceedings for the founding ceremony by heart.</p>

    <p>Holding the microphone and standing erect, Wang Han said loudly, "This founding celebration ceremony is specially sponsored by Small Raccoon Crispy Noodle Snacks."</p>

    <p>At that moment, a holographic 3D QR code was projected into the sky — it was actually a pixelated image of a small raccoon!</p>

    <p>"All guests present can scan this QR code and follow the steps to participate in the Office of Strategic Deception's founding celebration ceremony raffle." Wang Han continued, "The Office of Strategic Deception has prepared generous prizes for the celebration of the sect's founding: ten ninth-class holy artifacts, ten sixth-class holy artifacts, and three third-class holy artifacts. There is also a special mystery prize! This special prize is an exquisite luxury good you can never imagine..."</p>

    <p>No sooner had he finished speaking when whispers instantly broke out all over the field.</p>

    <p>"Holy artifacts... can these just be given away so casually?"</p>

    <p>"The Office of Strategic Deception really is rich!"</p>

    <p>"Three third-class holy artifacts... A typical sect would choose to leave these to their own disciples."</p>

    <p>"Hey, is no one curious about what the ultimate mystery prize is?"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>A lot of people took out their phones and started to scan the QR code.</p>

    <p>They then discovered that this QR code was in fact the Office of Strategic Deception's official account.</p>

    <p>After tapping "Follow," an automated reply message popped up instantly.</p>

    <p><em>System: From the General Office of Strategic Deception: Thank you for following the General Office of Strategic Deception's official account. At the same time, we sincerely invite all guests to participate in a raffle in conjunction with the sect's founding. As long as you officially announce your support for the Office of Strategic Deception in your WeChat Moments, take a screenshot, and reply to our official account, you will be eligible to participate in the raffle. Note: If you do not know the official announcement style, please look it up online.</em></p>

    <p>"Official announcement style <sup>1</sup> ?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A meme styled after actress

announcement, in which she
wrote "official announcement ♥.")</dfn>

    <p>"What's that?"</p>

    <p>Plenty of people had blank looks on their faces.</p>

    <p>"Does Sect Leader Lu know what the official announcement style is?" a Sky Light Alliance sect leader asked Lu Youming.</p>

    <p>"I think I do..."</p>

    <p>Working his phone, Lu Youming quickly took a photo.</p>

    <p>It was a picture of the vast crowd in the northern square, and he posted it in his WeChat Moments.</p>

    <p>Lu Youming: "Congratulations to the Office of Strategic Deception on its establishment! Official announcement! ♥"</p>

    <p>A lot of people gathered round for look, and suddenly understood. "So this is the official announcement style? As expected of Sect Leader Lu..."</p>

    <p>And so, for a time after that, many sect bigwigs present started to put together messages...</p>

    <p>Head of Cutting Sky Gang Xu Buque: "Extra! The Office of Strategic Deception is established today! The only Sky-level third-class sect! Official announcement! ♥"</p>

    <p>Adorable Lord of The Adorable Avengers Big Radish Head: "Congratulations to the Office of Strategic Deception on its founding! Official announcement! ♥"</p>

    <p>Sect Leader of Electric Eel Sect Wu Xiuyin: "The Office of Strategic Deception is founded today. The northern square is a sea of people. I saw a lot of bigwigs. It's so hot <em>SKR </em>! Official announcement! ♥"</p>

    <p>Sect Leader of Moral Cultivation Sect Fan Bayi: "I've long heard that Lord Diulei, Chief of the newly established Office of Strategic Deception, is very popular. The Office of Strategic Deception's founding is today, and many sect leaders have gathered. Congratulations! I hope that my Moral Cultivation Sect and the Office of Strategic Deception will have a chance to cooperate in the film and television industry! Paying taxes will start with me<sup>2</sup> ! Official announcement! ♥"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(A jibe at actress Fan

million fine she received ..)</dfn>

    <p>President of So Delicious Association Wang Jingze: "To be honest, when I first received the invitation, I, Wang Jingze, declined to come. I would rather starve to death or jump from here than participate in the Office of Strategic Deception's founding ceremony! If not for the raffle... So delicious! Official announcement! ♥"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>This momentum created by the forwarded messages of support for the raffle wasn't small - in just a few minutes, it exploded online and instantly became a hot topic.</p>

    <p>The hot topic "The founding of the General Office of Strategic Deception" straightaway went to the top of the "Breaking News" list of headlines.</p>

    <p>The app's search interface even froze when a lot of people tried to use it.</p>

    <p>The messages in the official announcement style posted by so many sect leaders and well-known media from all over the country caused a huge stir on WeChat, Weibo, Tieba and many other platforms.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, below the hot topic "The founding of the General Office of Strategic Deception," the keyword "Great Death-Courting Senior" also appeared on the list.</p>

    <p>In the machine room, Lord Diulei observed the activity online.</p>

    <p>In a flash, this momentum generated by the raffle had pushed the Office of Strategic Deception into becoming today's topic. Even before the media in the northern square had time to gather the facts and report the news, the sect's founding already dominated all the headlines of the major news media websites.</p>

    <p>"Sister Cailian is really awesome," Lord Diulei marveled.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin was very curious. "What is this special prize?"</p>

    <p>"Food," Lord Diulei replied.</p>

    <p>Er Ha reacted almost instantly. "It can't be Little Master Ling's crispy noodle snack, can it... woof?"</p>

    <p>"Ha ha ha, Brother Dog's reaction is so quick. I did suggest to Brother Ling before that we cook one enchanted crispy noodle snack packet and turn it into a delicacy as the special prize, but Brother Ling wasn't in favor of the idea!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"So the special prize was changed in the end. It isn't a crispy noodle snack, but it's also an exquisite luxury dish, as well as a delicacy. It's just that this dish is too expensive to make, and can even compare with a first-class holy artifact. After eating it, your lifespan can directly increase by up to two hundred years."</p>

    <p>"Up to two hundred years..." Xiao Yin's mouth dropped open in surprise. "What is it?"</p>

    <p>"Charcoal grilled purple cloud wings with braised Heavenly Dao broccoli," Lord Diulei said.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin and Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>At that moment, the voice of the host Wang Han rang out again in the northern square. "Before the sect's founding ceremony officially begins, the Office of Strategic Deception has prepared a sideshow. Any of the sect leaders present may come forward as you please to challenge our sect's leader of the recreation hall... If you win, you will immediately receive a first-class holy artifact!"</p>

    <p>In the machine room, Xiao Yin and Er Ha were shocked when they heard this.</p>

    <p>"Master's here?"</p>

    <p>"Little Master's here?"</p>

    <p>One Silver and one dog said almost in unison.</p>

    <p>"Brother Ling has to prepare for his final exams, so naturally he can't come to the ceremony. But this is a major event for the sect, after all, so he gave us face by sending half a clone over."</p>

    <p>"Half... half a clone?"</p>

    <p>"A clone that only has half the spirit power of a regular whole clone. Brother Ling said that all the sect leaders present are pretty weak. If he uses a whole clone, he's afraid he'll directly beat them to death."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"After all, this is a sect founding ceremony. It wouldn't be good to spill blood. We should start well, and get along a little."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
