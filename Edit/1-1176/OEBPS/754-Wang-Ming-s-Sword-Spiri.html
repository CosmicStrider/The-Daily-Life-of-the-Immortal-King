  <h1>Chapter 754 Wang Ming's Sword Spirit</h1>

  <div>

    <p>President Qi was stupefied. He remembered that he had indeed infiltrated Night Chief and put everyone under precise control with the power of his mind prior to launching the insect troops.</p>

    <p>But most unfortunately, it felt as if he had been distracted a little just now...</p>

    <p>President Qi felt like his mind had been stolen by someone else!!!</p>

    <p>Generally speaking, invading someone's mind while yours was being invaded at the same time was an agonizing experience. This clash between three minds was extremely harmful to the person in the middle; it was like being pulled in two different directions by the arms, and it was difficult to look after both at the same time.</p>

    <p>President Qi controlled Long Ming's mind while the mysterious person controlled President Qi's mind, which made him the middle person.</p>

    <p>He had suddenly become the middle person in a struggle of minds, and logically speaking, he should be in immeasurable pain.</p>

    <p>But the sensation of his mind being taken over was unexpectedly comfortable...</p>

    <p>It was even a kind of pleasure he had never felt before...</p>

    <p>When he came back to his senses, Night Ghost Spirit Emperor had already disappeared and there was a very large hole in the ceiling of Night Chief's general headquarters.</p>

    <p>After that, President Qi withdrew his mind and took off the amplification helmet.</p>

    <p>For a very long time, he didn't get up, but quietly pondered two things.</p>

    <p>One: Who on earth was this mysterious person who had invaded his mind just now?</p>

    <p>Second: Should he look for a wife himself...</p>

    <p>He looked down at his pants.</p>

    <p>It was a good thing that his clothes were made from a special material which dried quickly and eliminated strange smells.</p>

    <p>How embarrassing would it be if Mengyu had seen his state just now!</p>

    <p>At that thought, President Qi flushed before getting out of the space capsule with a sigh.</p>

    <p>It was only at that moment that he realized that his adopted son Qi Mengyu was actually standing behind the space capsule.</p>

    <p>Qi Mengyu: "Dad."</p>

    <p>President Qi was startled. "You... when did you come in..."</p>

    <p>Qi Mengyu: "I heard you cry out just now and I thought something happened, so... so I came in."</p>

    <p>President Qi gazed at Qi Mengyu. "Use the method I taught you... erase that memory right now! Don't make me do it for you."</p>

    <p>Qi Mengyu: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the Dead Sea of Space, Wang Ming's battle of wits and courage against Ghost Head Blade continued.</p>

    <p>After drawing the blueprint, Wang Ming fashioned his belt, which he had taken off earlier, into a hook to snag magic treasure fragments floating in the sea. Since the fragments that floated past were random, Wang Ming basically had to reel in whatever he saw; only when it was on the raft did he check to see if they were the components he needed.</p>

    <p>Several dozen minutes later, there was already no longer much space on the bamboo raft as it was taken up by magic treasure fragments large and small.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling chose the bits he needed and then took off his white coat and used it like a cleaning rag to wipe these fragments clean of the Dead Sea spirit fluid on them. The white coat was made from a special material and wasn't an ordinary piece of clothing: it was tough and could be used to clean things.</p>

    <p>He didn't dare directly touch the spirit fluid, otherwise it would definitely corrode his skin.</p>

    <p>Among the ten or so magic treasure pieces he had reeled in, Wang Ming in the end only chose three of them.</p>

    <p>He threw the rest back into the Dead Sea of Space.</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade watched as Wang Ming wiped these pieces over and over before finally using a tool from the toolbox to cut out the parts he needed.</p>

    <p>The cutting instrument that Wang Ming was using was the mini-robot "Small Crab" that had been in the toolbox. Compared with that eight-armed "Big Crab" in the military tent, it was naturally much less effective. Although Small Crab was easy to carry around, it was much slower at cutting.</p>

    <p>"If only Big Crab was here." Wang Ming heaved a sigh.</p>

    <p>He deliberately said this for Ghost Head Blade to hear.</p>

    <p>Although Ghost Head Blade heard the insinuation, he showed no sign of being chastised and pressed Wang Ming instead: "You're slow, hurry up!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming curled his lip and then began to assemble the parts he had cut out.</p>

    <p>After several minutes, the first component for the Amplification Cannon was complete.</p>

    <p>"So fast?" Ghost Head Blade was flabbergasted.</p>

    <p>"This is just one part, we need a lot of components," Wang Ming replied.</p>

    <p>He then put this assembled component away in his storage ring and started the second round of fishing...</p>

    <p>This second round was in the end very fruitful!</p>

    <p>Furthermore, he even reeled in a complete magic sword in this second round. Although there were cracks in it, it was still intact! It was a dark blue spirit sword which even had a dragon head engraved on its hilt, and the overall craftsmanship was very refined!</p>

    <p>"Such a good sword should have a sword spirit, right?" Wang Ming knew how to appraise magic treasures to some extent, and he estimated that this complete magic sword should be a holy weapon!</p>

    <p>"There are so many broken magic treasures floating around in the Dead Sea of Space, and some of them would be more or less intact. However, once they're sucked in here, there's no way to retrieve them at all. It's likely that the connection with its master was cut, so the sword spirit self-destructed in the end," Ghost Head Blade said.</p>

    <p>"What a pity."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming felt some regret.</p>

    <p>As he wiped this dark blue spirit sword clean, he was surprised to discover several rows of words on it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "What's this?"</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade immediately replied without even looking, "Whether it's a sword spirit or any other type of artifact spirit, they'll leave behind on the magic artifact the reason for destroying themselves, otherwise they won't be able to reincarnate after they die. Those are probably the sword spirit's last words that you're looking at."</p>

    <p>So that was it.</p>

    <p>Curious, Wang Ming looked at these words and then read them aloud.</p>

    <p>It read: <em>This humble servant is called Kunshan and is the sword spirit of this sword. My sword master's name was Brother Long. Master was drunk while traveling on his sword in the air, and he collided with a young knight in white, which led to an altercation. During the dispute, my sword master raised this humble servant to slash the other party, but his hand trembled and this humble servant fell out of his grasp and was sucked into a space rift, just like that, before entering the Dead Sea of Space. My sword master, that unarmed and defenseless soft ancestor, was then hacked to death by the young knight in white outside... Hence, this humble servant has decided to destroy myself. If anyone finds this sword, please take photo evidence of my explanation and give it to the young knight in white as proof of "reasonable self-defense." Heavenly Dao of reincarnation, this humble servant begs that when I am reincarnated, please set me up with a reliable sword master <sup>1</sup> </em><em>!</em></p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This refers to a case in
Kunshan where a local
gangster collided with a
cyclist while driving drunk,
and in trying to kill the
man, was himself killed
instead. The cyclist was
later cleared as having acted in self-defense..)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ming: "..."</p>

    <p>Ghost Head Blade: "..."</p>

    <p>As soon as Wang Ming finished reading aloud, he suddenly realized that the Heavenly Materials sword under his butt was glowing slightly.</p>

    <p>A youngster dressed in an ancient style with long hair and dead fish eyes suddenly appeared like a breath of fresh air and looked at Wang Ming. "This humble servant is Kunshan. I came here at the Heavenly Dao's call to serve as this sword's spirit."</p>

    <p>Both Wang Ming and Ghost Head Blade were stunned.</p>

    <p>Why did a sword spirit pop up here all of a sudden?</p>

    <p>Wang Ming suddenly recalled that it was his birthday today.</p>

    <p>So... was this thing his birthday gift?</p>

    <p>Surely it couldn't be that coincidental...</p>
