  <h1>Chapter 977 Benchi Sword</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Whoever the young man was or what his purpose might be, the resurrection of President Bai and Devil Gut Fungus Lord was a serious issue. These were two very troublesome enemies. Devil Gut Fungus Lord would continue to become stronger with time, while President Bai had a terrifying self-recovery ability.</p>

    <p>If they were to revive, Wang Ling would have to slap them several more times - how tiring!</p>

    <p>He sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>So, the best way to prevent this from happening was to strangle these guys in the cradle at the very beginning.</p>

    <p>And that mysterious teenager with unusual powers was his only lead right now in tracking down those two individuals.</p>

    <p>"Any leads on that teenager?" Wang Ling asked.</p>

    <p>In a rare instance, Wang Ling chose to open his mouth rather than speak telepathically, which indicated how seriously he viewed this matter. And since Guo Ping had already joined their party, there was no longer anyone in the noodle shop who was an outsider.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling hardly ever spoke aloud, and as soon as his voice sounded, Wang Ming and Guo Ping, as well as Er Ha on the ground, got goosebumps all over... It was a waste not to become a voice actor with that voice...</p>

    <p>"Su Shangqing?" Guo Ping raised his eyebrows. In fact, he was also a passionate anime, comics and games fan in his daily life, and was quite familiar with the voice acting field. He thought that Wang Ling's voice was somewhat similar to Su Shangqing's.</p>

    <p>"Su Shangqing?"</p>

    <p>"He's done voices for <em>Fighter of Destiny </em>, <em>Battle Through the Heavens </em>and <em>There's a Pit in My Senior Martial Brother's Brain </em>- the most important thing is that he'll be voice acting for <em>The Daily Life of the Immortal King </em>!"</p>

    <p>"I see..." Wang Ming had the expression of one who didn't understand, but thought it was awesome anyway.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Returning to the topic, Guo Ping started to talk about some information he had obtained last night, which had been put together and analyzed by Roger at Mixiu's research institute.</p>

    <p>"No material evidence was left behind before Mose was destroyed; not even an image capture of the youngster's face."</p>

    <p>Guo Ping said slowly, "However, based on the huge hole at the border defense base, the intruder is young and about 178cm in height; we have a full set of magic treasures for reconstructing and analyzing spells, and from the focal point of the spell damage, we can determine the angle at which the attacker's hand was raised when the spell was cast.</p>

    <p>"A person attacking with spells usually doesn't cast them at an exaggerated angle, and basically won't go above shoulder height. Additionally, judging by the footprints left at the scene, the spellcaster is extremely confident in his spell attacks, as he was physically very close to the destruction site.</p>

    <p>"This means one of two things. First, the spellcaster has a precise handle on his magic: he knows how to keep himself safe from where he's standing when he's casting spells. But based on the extent of the damage to the wall, that was an exceptionally fierce blast! Hence, I think the second point is more likely, and that is that this person is completely unafraid of spell damage, and is thus very conceited.</p>

    <p>"Egoistic people like this usually want to be as cool as possible when casting spells, so they'd never stand with their legs too far apart, since that would ruin their image."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling as well as Er Ha on the ground almost spaced out when they listened to Guo Ping's analysis.</p>

    <p>"You studied criminal psychology before?" Er Ha asked.</p>

    <p>"A little, but a lot of it is just based on scientific reasoning." Guo Ping said, "I calculated this person's height based on the above information, while I determined his age in light of the information which Roger sent over following the spell reconstruction. The composition of the spirit power molecules which the intruder left behind at the scene is relatively young, so I think the other party is around your age, Wang Ling."</p>

    <p>"?" Wang Ling frowned.</p>

    <p>Around his age...</p>

    <p>Could this person be another cultivation prodigy hiding in the world?</p>

    <p>Guo Ping's analysis made sense, and it aligned with what Wang Ming had seen in his dream. Although Wang Ming still couldn't quite believe it, practically all the information now matched his dream.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming had yet to share this matter with anyone.</p>

    <p>Now, however, he felt that the others had to know. "I have something to tell you. It's about my dream last night..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming raised his head, a complicated expression on his face.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, Fang Xing had run into some trouble on his way to buy ingredients. He had gone off to buy groceries on the new Benchi Sword which his foster parents had bought him. They had just picked up the sword from the Benchi 4S store yesterday, but Fang Xing had only flown it halfway when it started to leak spirit power.</p>

    <p>Imported goods also weren't reliable nowadays! They were all so shitty. Fang Xing remembered that in order to buy this sword, his foster parents had even been forced to pay a service fee.</p>

    <p>He had heard them complain yesterday that customer service attitude before and after payment was like the sudden onset of a storm; they turned hostile faster than flipping the pages of a book.</p>

    <p>As the saying went: "Benchi in hand, I own the whole world at over 600,000 HNY. But it barely inches forward, and leaks spirit power halfway. I paid the service fee in cash, and there is virtually no after-sales service <sup>1</sup> ."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Derived from an online
doggerel someone wrote
about a Mercedes-Benz 4S car
shop and its appalling
customer service ..)</dfn>

    <p>Given that the sword was leaking spirit power, Fang Xing was forced to stop his flight and set out on foot instead to his destination.</p>

    <p>He didn't have a spare spirit sword on him, but he wasn't far from his destination. Fang Xing touched down in a nearby park. There was a spirit bus stop next to the market, so he could take a spirit bus back later.</p>

    <p>Just as Fang Xing was about to head in the direction of the market, a hand landed on his shoulder. "Classmate Fang, don't move."</p>

    <p>"Who are you?" Fang Xing was instantly wary. He could feel this person's hand but couldn't see him, which meant one of two things.</p>

    <p>First, this man was currently invisible.</p>

    <p>Second, this man was using a space layer spell, which typically meant that he was invisible to others but he could still communicate with them.</p>

    <p>Whatever the case, a person who would hide his identity like this could only be a criminal on the run.</p>

    <p>Also, this voice sounded familiar to Fang Xing for some reason...</p>

    <p>"What do you want?" Fang Xing asked.</p>

    <p>"Come with us. My master wants to meet you," said the person behind Fang Xing in a dreadful tone.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing struggled but found that the man was as strong as an ox, and he couldn't break free of the man's hold at all.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing grit his teeth and turned his body in a way that no regular person could to twist his arm free and throw off the man's hold.</p>

    <p>Then, he stomped his foot, and the scene before his eyes instantly transformed.</p>

    <p>This was the second generation intrinsic spirit field which his father Immortal She Pi had passed down to him.</p>

    <p>This person had ill intentions, so he had to be an enemy! Thus, Fang Xing didn't think too much, and wanted a look at this person's face first before he did anything else.</p>
