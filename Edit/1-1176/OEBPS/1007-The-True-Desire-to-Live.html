  <h1>Chapter 1007 The True Desire to Live</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Just like Father Wang said, Aunt Wang was a character who was hard to deal with. She probably backed down this time only because Father and Mother Wang were here, and they had come back to honor their ancestors. As soon as they left, Old Man Wang would probably continue to be bombarded by her matchmaking.</p>

    <p>Of course, this was Aunt Wang's own wishful thinking... however, the root of this issue stemmed from the fact that most of the villagers depended on Old Man Wang. Back then, he single-handedly led the sea village out of poverty toward prosperity, and the villagers worshipped him like a big brother. It was because of this that the villagers believed in the importance of Old Man Wang as the pillar of the village.</p>

    <p>But even a pillar would grow old one day.</p>

    <p>Father Wang left the sea village to live in the city. Although he had used his earnings as an author to buy a suburban villa and settle down, this didn't give the villagers any sense of security... Actually, Father Wang felt that the villagers didn't have enough confidence in themselves.</p>

    <p>Under Aunt Wang Dongmei's leadership, the sea village's growth hadn't stagnated at all in the last two years.</p>

    <p>But Old Man Wang's existence was like a calming tonic which soothed the people.</p>

    <p>"Aunt Wang, my father is quite tired after being on the road the whole day. Why don't we talk about this after the ancestral worship?" Father Wang knew that if she continued to hang around, his dad might not even be able to eat dinner; as someone wise in the ways of the world, Aunt Wang naturally recognized her cue to leave.</p>

    <p>She took out a book from her chest pocket and placed it on the table with a smile. "Uncle Wang, I know you're not keen now, but that's fine! I'll leave this book here. Later, when you're interested, you can flip through it and have a look. If you see anyone you like, send me a photo and I'll immediately arrange for the lady to come to your place."</p>

    <p>"You'll even bring her here?" Father Wang smiled.</p>

    <p>Wang Dongmei: "Of course! Uncle Wang is so distinguished, we can't have him go over himself, right? Let me tell you, Uncle Wang is still young! It's just that he doesn't want to take youth-retaining pills. Actually, a lot of men take it nowadays, and I don't think it's a big deal! If Uncle Wang's appearance went back to what it was like when he was young, it would be an insta-kill for all the fresh meat out there! I'll leave this youth-retaining pill with you, Uncle Wang - I've kept it for you all this time!"</p>

    <p>Father and Mother Wang: "..."</p>

    <p>Aunt Wang's face was like a peach blossom as she spoke, and she started to blather on again before leaving. "Also, Uncle Wang, go through the photos in the book carefully. For some of the old ones, there are also photos of them when they were young. If you fancy their younger looks, I can also give them this youth-retaining pill!"</p>

    <p>Father Wang and Mother Wang: "..."</p>

    <p>After talking non-stop for five or six minutes, Aunt Wang finally left in high spirits.</p>

    <p>Old Man Wang slumped down in his chair like Ge You; it was as if his life had already lost all meaning.</p>

    <p>He sighed with extreme bitterness - as if he had watched the rotten ending of season eight of the <em>Game of Thrones </em>, he looked like he wanted to die.</p>

    <p>"Tsk, Aunt Wang really knows how to use any opportunity."</p>

    <p>Father Wang spoke mockingly, before he started flipping through that matchmaking book.</p>

    <p>Father Wang's glasses slid down his nose at the range of photos inside.</p>

    <p>"The heck... Aunt Wang's prep is so detailed..." Father Wang was stunned.</p>

    <p>There were all kinds inside this matchmaking book! Even black girls...</p>

    <p>"Agalia Mamatty, top graduate of Mixiu nation's Xia Fo Cultivation Academy, majored in spirit sword applied engineering and air flow technology, has a Michelin five-star chef certificate... even her BWH is included..." Father Wang stared blankly. This foreigner could be described as utterly invincible from this information alone... But Father Wang didn't understand - why would such an outstanding talent appear in this matchmaking book?</p>

    <p>"Dad, what do you think these people want from you? The fact you're old? That you don't shower <sup>1</sup> ?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A line which went viral from
the Chinese drama "All Is
Well," in which a rich old man
called Su Daqiang trusts
swindlers easily.)</dfn>

    <p>"???"</p>

    <p>Old Man Wang: "That's Su Daqiang! I shower every day!"</p>

    <p>Father Wang laughed. "I'm just joking, dad! I had a look, and the profiles aren't bad. You haven't lost any of your charm." At this point, Mother Wang also covered her mouth and laughed; both of them were well aware of how Old Man Wang had been known as a Casanova back in the day.</p>

    <p>Old Man Wang: "Hey..."</p>

    <p>"Dad, don't sigh."</p>

    <p>Father Wang hurried over and gripped Old Man Wang's hand. "You are the pillar of Seigaku... Bah! the pillar of the sea village <sup>2</sup> !"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Two ways to look at this: In
the manga series "Prince of
Tennis," the name of the
school Seigaku translates to
"school of youth." At the
same time, the character
Kawamura Takashi, whose
surname translates to "river village," often acts as the pillar of the tennis team..)</dfn>

    <p>Old Man Wang rolled his eyes and sat up straight. "What do you know..."</p>

    <p>"Then what do you think about this, dad?" Mother Wang asked softly as she also sat down.</p>

    <p>The old man's opinion was always the most important.</p>

    <p>Although it did seem on the surface that Old Man Wang wasn't interested in finding a new partner, they couldn't rule out the slightest possibility that this was because of other factors; for example, that Old Man Wang might have his own concerns.</p>

    <p>"Dad, if you really want to find a new partner, you don't need to worry about me. I had thought about looking for a stepmother to take care of you before, which would be good. To be honest, I'm worried sometimes about you living in this sea village. Ling Ling took pains to cure you of your dementia; who knows if it'll come back when you play mahjong with Uncle Wu and the rest - those two are pretty sly!" Father Wang whispered.</p>

    <p>"Your mom was the reason for my dementia..." Old Man Wang rolled his eyes and poked Father Wang in the forehead. "You heartless thing. When your mother was alive, she treated you the best! You're still thinking of finding a stepmother..."</p>

    <p>"Aiyo." Father Wang pretended to cry out in pain before he laughed. "Of course, I know how good my mom was to me. That's why I've never skipped out on honoring our ancestors every year. I also know how you feel about my mom... but the problem is that so many people are eyeing you now. If you really aren't interested, it's best to deal with this quickly so that they'll stop trying."</p>

    <p>Old Man Wang's expression was melancholy. "Sometimes, we don't know how to cherish something until it's gone. Honestly speaking, when your mom was still around, she always ignored me, grumbled about me, and nagged me...</p>

    <p>"When she's gone, my heart's empty.</p>

    <p>"Her voice always echoes in my ears.</p>

    <p>"I can't forget her, let alone let go...</p>

    <p>"I did think of looking for a companion, but I always felt that your mom's soul is with me and hasn't left."</p>

    <p>Father Wang felt tears welling up in his eyes.</p>

    <p>But he didn't want the atmosphere to be too heavy, so he wiped his tears and forced a smile. "You're saying my mom's soul never left?"</p>

    <p>Old Man Wang rolled his eyes again.</p>

    <p>But this time.</p>

    <p>" <em>Pa! </em>" The crisp sound of a slap suddenly rang out in the air.</p>

    <p>The entire scene fell silent.</p>

    <p>There was a handprint on the left side of Father Wang's face.</p>

    <p>The sensation was familiar...</p>

    <p>Father Wang was so frightened he broke out in a cold sweat on the spot. "Holy shit! Mom! You're really here! Mom, if you're here, please slap me again!"</p>

    <p><em>Pa!</em></p>

    <p>There was another handprint on the right side of his face.</p>

    <p>And then... there was nothing.</p>

    <p>Hugging each other, father and son trembled where they sat.</p>

    <p>Mother Wang: "..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang finally realized now why Old Man Wang had been so against the idea of finding a companion.</p>

    <p>This... was a man's true desire to live...</p>
