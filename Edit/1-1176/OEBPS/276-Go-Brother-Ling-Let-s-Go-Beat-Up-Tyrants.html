  <h1>Chapter 276 Go! Brother Ling! Let's Go Beat Up Tyrants! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>This sword light... this was definitely the brown spirit light that had appeared on the TV screen back then before the space had exploded!</p>

    <p>The eastern branch chief was hit with realization.</p>

    <p>It was just as Master had theorized, that spirit sword wasn't just any ordinary sword!</p>

    <p>This was an indescribable feeling which was very difficult to put into words. That immense sense of oppression had already enveloped him from afar, even before the sword drew near.</p>

    <p>Familiar with this light now, the eastern branch chief finally saw the body of the spirit sword emerge from the light.</p>

    <p>It was actually... a peach wood sword?</p>

    <p>It was just a peach wood sword; how could it produce that kind of abnormal number with nine question marks?</p>

    <p>Judging from the sword qi, this sword indeed did seem very strong... but the middle-aged man felt it was more likely that there was a problem with the equipment used to measure the power index!</p>

    <p>"In any case, since Master is looking for you, I'll have to take you back with me first."</p>

    <p>The eastern branch chief frowned. Eyes fixed on this splendid sword, he raised his hand and several small flags appeared, black as ink and covered in a fine pattern of veins. With one gust of wind, they rapidly enlarged and began revolving around him.</p>

    <p>In a flash, a spatial force took shape before transforming into a barrier against Jingke's pressure.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Lord Diulei were in the bedroom on the second floor. Looking at this scene from a distance, Wang Ling had determined how old the flags were at a glance. At the very least, they had been made in ancient times, and were about as old as that black dagger which the old devil had left behind.</p>

    <p>"Immortal Mansion's roots are actually so deep?" Lord Diulei couldn't help exclaiming.</p>

    <p>Because according to Tan Qian's report, the person who had come was merely the chief of the eastern branch, who at best played a role similar to an elder of an outer sect. If an outer sect elder could actually have this type of magic weapon from ancient times, then how rich must that bunch in the inner sect be?</p>

    <p>With the protection of the magic flags, the pressure on the middle-aged man had lessened. Although he couldn't control these magic flags perfectly and the power that he was able to exert was very limited, in his view, this barrier set up with ancient magic flags, which were on par with first-class holy weapons, was more than enough to resist the intrusion of sword qi.</p>

    <p>Moreover, it wasn't only for protection that he had set up this barrier of magic flags.</p>

    <p>His ultimate goal for coming here was to seize this spirit sword. The magic flags which surrounded him were a powerful magic weapon from ancient times which could suppress a sword spirit by capturing its sword qi.</p>

    <p>"My magic flags captured countless spirit swords in ancient times; so what if you're strong?" The eastern branch chief stared at the roiling brown spirit light in front of him and sneered. He turned his palm over, and the the air rippled violently as the magic flags scattered in different directions to arrange themselves in the air and form a giant cage.</p>

    <p>"They're actually spirit-suppressing flags?" Lord Diulei exclaimed after recognizing them. "Many well-known spirit swords on the swords list have fallen to this magic weapon. I heard that the person who created these spirit-suppressing flags had an unusual connection to Old Demon Han."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling opened his Heavenly Eye to the fullest and fixed his gaze on the spirit-suppressing flags.</p>

    <p>This was probably Lord Diulei's first time observing Wang Ling at close range as he opened his Heavenly Eye. Those pupils blossomed into golden petals that seemed to contain infinite spiritual power, filling people with a vague sense of dread.</p>

    <p>He didn't dare look directly at Wang Ling, and could only observe him out of the corner of his eye...</p>

    <p>Eyes fixed on the spirit-suppressing flags in the air, Wang Ling frowned.</p>

    <p>All ancient magic weapons in the world today had one thing in common — they had already lost their weapon spirits. And it was because these items without masters didn't have weapon spirits that they could be used by cultivators now. If an ancient magic weapon had a weapon spirit, there was no way that a Soul Formation cultivator would be able to wield it.</p>

    <p>But through his Heavenly Eye, Wang Ling could tell that there were many strange nomological laws surrounding these spirit-suppressing flags.</p>

    <p>This was hence a very curious magic weapon in his eyes. He felt that someone was operating it from afar, and that this eastern branch chief might not be its true master.</p>

    <p>This was the point which Wang Ling found strange.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At that moment, Jingke had already been enveloped in the cage formed by the spirit-suppressing flags.</p>

    <p>The middle-aged man looked on with a calm and composed expression as he silently waited for the sword spirit of this peach wood sword to reveal its true appearance.</p>

    <p>A moment later, he saw the spirit light on the peach wood sword scatter and gradually transform into its true appearance in the cage. A kid wearing a brown vest and a white robe, who only looked around ten years old, stared at him with a cold expression on his fair face.</p>

    <p>Looking up at this giant spirit-suppressing flag cage, Jingke sighed. "Bor...ing..."</p>

    <p>He had thought it would be a magic weapon which he could have some fun with, so he had revealed his true form and come out personally, but the reality of it disappointed him.</p>

    <p>About ten seconds later...</p>

    <p>A purple light burst forth from the bottom of the cage to illuminate Jingke, like the Pagoda-Bearing God's golden tower capturing a demon <sup>1</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This refers to Li Jing, a god in
Chinese folk religion who
carries a golden tower that
can capture any spirit, demon
or god.)</dfn>

    <p>This was a special type of spirit light, which could suppress the majority of sword spirits in a very short span of time for use.</p>

    <p>In the glow of the purple light, Jingke yawned indifferently. He didn't resist, and his expression was unruffled.</p>

    <p>"I did it!" The middle-aged man was extremely delighted when Jingke didn't move. The longer this purple light shone, the weaker the sword spirit would become.</p>

    <p>So he stood at a distance and watched as Jingke stood in this purple light as if he was in a microwave...</p>

    <p>Five minutes later...</p>

    <p>"It's time!" The middle-aged man was very pleased as he slowly walked in Jingke's direction; it felt very refreshing, as if he was harvesting vegetables in Happy Farm <sup>2</sup>.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This refers to Li Jing, a god in
Chinese folk religion who
carries a golden tower that
can capture any spirit, demon
or god.)</dfn>

    <p>This was the final step toward him being promoted to Immortal Mansion's top level!</p>

    <p>He drew near to Jingke and formed hand seals. Finally, he held his hands high.</p>

    <p>"Seal!" His loud shout was followed by the sword spirit in front of him being drawn back into the cage by the purple light.</p>

    <p>This huge cage in the air gradually shrunk to the size of his palm and dropped into the hands of the eastern branch chief.</p>

    <p>Just like that... he'd done it?</p>

    <p>The middle-aged man's face lit up with delight as he held the cage in his hands. Everything had gone so smoothly!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The whole process had been very quiet. Wang Ling and Lord Diulei had been in the bedroom on the second floor watching everything calmly.</p>

    <p>Letting Jingke be captured on purpose — this had been part of Wang Ling's plan.</p>

    <p>"We've really wronged Lord Jingke."</p>

    <p>Hands on his hips, Lord Diulei watched this middle-aged man laugh as if he were a two hundred- jin child <sup>3</sup> .</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(This is an online meme
expression, ʼto laugh/cry as a
xx-jin child.')</dfn>

    <p>Now, this eastern branch chief would take Jingke to Immortal Mansion's headquarters. Once Wang Ling received the signal from Jingke, he and Lord Diulei would go there directly and kill them.</p>

    <p>"Now we just have to wait for Lord Jingke to send a signal, then we can directly go and beat up tyrants <sup>4</sup> !" Lord Diulei said. "Oh, that's right! Brother Ling, just now, all the brothers and sisters in the group plus Luo Chuang said that they wanted to take part in this operation."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>4</sup>(The phrase used here is 打土豪
'datuhao,' or 'attack the
wealthy,' and was part of a
slogan used when peasants
rebelled against despotic
landowners during the
agrarian revolution in China ..)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling: "?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "It's common sense to call on your brothers and sisters when you're going to go beat up tyrants!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was extremely excited. "This Immortal Mansion bunch must be rolling in money!"</p>
