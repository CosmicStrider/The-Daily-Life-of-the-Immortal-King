  <h1>Chapter 473 I'm Just Asking </h1>

  <div>

    <p>This was the first time that Er Ha had come in contact with this kind of skills store on the Internet. It couldn't help staring blankly at the system prompt: how had a spellmaster become a technician?</p>

    <p>But when Er Ha thought about it carefully, it realized that there was nothing wrong with this title. After all, there was another name for a spellmaster: master of technical ability... in short: technician.</p>

    <p>This Staff Number 003 technician seemed very enthusiastic. "Hello, Mr Doggy Two, may I ask what kind of cultivation art or spirit technique do you need consultation on?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha was very curious. " <em>Ei </em>? You can also teach skills that belong to spirit beasts?"</p>

    <p>Technician 003 was stumped a little before replying, "Mm, don't worry, sir. I have a lot of experience as a pet trainer; I can teach you."</p>

    <p>Recalling his experience since joining this online store, the technician added, "In fact, our online store also has skill books for spirit beasts. We have had people buy them for their domestic spirit beasts."</p>

    <p>But this was really the first time that a spirit beast was personally using a computer to shop online...</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "What's the process?"</p>

    <p>Technician 003 replied, "It's like this, there are two ways. One is that if you spend a certain amount on our website, you get technician lessons as a gift. The other is if you provide information on the relevant skill, we will give you a quote based on class and difficulty."</p>

    <p>After Technician 003 said this, Er Ha wasn't in a hurry to reply, but opened the online store to take a careful look at the skill volumes they were selling. The vast majority were level one and level two. There were very few level three volumes and the level four one could basically be considered the store's crowning jewel with a sky-high price! It was fully worth five hundred thousand immortal gold bars! Converted into Huaxiu currency, that was over hundreds of millions of yuan! This value was no less than the average market price of a ninth-class holy magic weapon.</p>

    <p>When it saw this, Er Ha couldn't help tsking and asked, "What about confidentiality?"</p>

    <p>Technician 003: "The country now has a specialized spellmaster platform. If Mr Doggy Two can offer us a skill book, we will contact you on the spellmaster platform. After we have evaluated the skill book's level of difficulty and determined a price, you can come to our online store to pay the tuition fee. Mr Doggy Two, you can be assured that only the two of us will be able to see the skill book. It cannot be copied or forwarded; confidentiality is guaranteed.</p>

    <p>"There are a lot more cases nowadays that have to do with illegal copyright infringement... any typical platform and spellmaster would pay close attention to such a thing. No one wants to stir up trouble for themselves, don't you think? In addition, the penalty for copyright infringement of these skill books is very high."</p>

    <p>Er Ha nodded and felt that what Technician 003 said did seem reasonable.</p>

    <p>At that time, Technician 003 sent a link. "If you think this is fine, Mr Two, please click on the link to access the spellmaster platform and we'll communicate there."</p>

    <p>Er Ha quickly replied, "No, no, no, I still don't think it's a good idea, my spirit technique is very difficult!"</p>

    <p>The technician on the other end was clearly stumped and didn't reply for a very long time.</p>

    <p>It was true that spirit beasts had spiritual intelligence, but few were actually able to operate a computer themselves... In this regard, the technician felt that Er Ha's class probably wasn't low. "May I ask, Mr Doggy Two, what is your class now?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha gave a subdued reply. "Third class."</p>

    <p>Actually, it had been at second class for a while...</p>

    <p>Technician 003 understood the situation. "All right, Mr Doggy Two. I can guarantee I'll definitely be able to teach you level one to level three spirit beast skills, whether from our store or if you provide them yourself. Level four skills are charged according to their difficulty, and if I can't do it, I can recommend my <em>shifu </em>. Moreover, I highly recommend our Salted Fish Skills Store's rare level three spirit technique, the salted fish quick stab <sup>1</sup> ... This is a skill which our store owner personally designed for spirit beasts, and it's easy to use!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is derived from an online gaming term for playing games with low level weapons and equipment ..)</dfn>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Had the names of new spirit techniques nowadays really come to this random point...</p>

    <p>Er Ha had originally thought "Nine Thousand Cheeky Kicks of Spirit Dog" and "Dog Sounds Sitting Lotus" were already random enough. Who would have thought that the names in stores nowadays would be more and more random...</p>

    <p>Er Ha couldn't help mocking, "The name of this skill of yours doesn't sound good..."</p>

    <p>Technician 003 sent a shrug emoji. "It's enough that it's user-friendly and practical. In the old days, when spirit techniques and spells with nice names were put on display, they actually weren't very powerful."</p>

    <p>He explained patiently, "Besides, what's the most important thing? Modern cultivators are becoming more and more sophisticated, and they've stopped expressly shouting out the names of their skills before exhibiting them... Once upon a time, for the sake of face, the old generation of cultivators gave the spirit techniques and spells they created awesome names. But reality tells us that they weren't of any damn use!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>What Technician 003 said actually made sense to Er Ha!</p>

    <p>Nowadays, it basically wasn't wise to especially shout out the name of your spell before battle... this was an entirely unnecessary act.</p>

    <p>If it was Little Master Ling, it would be even more simple and blunt.</p>

    <p>Because Little Master Ling didn't need to use any skill at all; a slap or a punch would do...</p>

    <p>Technician 003: "May I ask, Mr Doggy Two, have you made your decision?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha replied, "It's like this, it's not that I don't want to buy, but I feel that you might not be able to teach me; my spirit technique is a collection of close combat boxing skills. Only the first two forms are level four; the others are level five."</p>

    <p>When Technician 003 saw Er Ha's reply, his heart was instantly shaken; level five...</p>

    <p>As a spellmaster, he was very sensitive to the grades of arts and spirit techniques. A level five skill... it went without saying how valuable it would be; the crowning jewel of their store was only a level four skill.</p>

    <p>The difference in value between level one and level two skill books on cultivation methods and spirit techniques wasn't especially big, but from level three onwards, it was a world of extreme difference with each increase in level.</p>

    <p>A level five spirit beast spirit technique...</p>

    <p>Technician 003 knew very well in his heart that he truly wouldn't be able to teach this skill...</p>

    <p>He sweated slightly. "Mr Doggy Two, I indeed won't be able to teach you if it's a level five skill, but I think my <em>shifu </em>might be able to. Follow the link I just sent you and enter the number 704620442 into the search bar for spellmaster IDs..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha replied politely, "Alright, thank you."</p>

    <p>Technician 003 was a little dissatisfied. "Mr Doggy Two, aren't there any skills in our store that you might be interested in?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "No. The names of your skills are too exotic, like 'Crying Attack' and 'Gay Stare'..."</p>

    <p>Technician 003: "..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Come on! You don't have to be so sad! I wasn't going to buy anything in the first place... I was just asking..."</p>

    <p>In front of the screen, Technician 003 slammed the keyboard: <em>You fucker...</em></p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Er Ha very curiously opened the spellmaster platform and typed in the ID 704620442 that Technician 003 had given to it earlier.</p>

    <p>Then, a spellmaster's ID profile popped up.</p>

    <p>And Er Ha actually knew this guy!</p>

    <p>Wei... Wei Zhi?</p>

    <p>When had this guy become a spellmaster...</p>
