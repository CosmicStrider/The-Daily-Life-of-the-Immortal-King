  <h1>Chapter 760 Replica Tongue</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wearing a complete set of human-shaped mecha armor, Wang Ming broke through the space wall and finally escaped the Dead Sea of Space as he was spat out by a space fissure which suddenly opened.</p>

    <p>He surveyed the surrounding terrain. It was a completely unfamiliar environment, but the one thing he was sure of was that he was still inside the remains since he had done his homework before coming here. There was a lake nearby, and odd spirit plants grew all around - there was no mistaking it, these were all extinct resources.</p>

    <p>"It seems that we are still inside the remains, and in the western region. We should contact someone as soon as possible." Wang Ming got up from the ground and put away his human-shaped mecha armor.</p>

    <p>After passing through the storm, it only had three percent left of its spirit power.</p>

    <p>It had also sustained damage to the extent that it could only be used one more time at the most before it was completely scrapped.</p>

    <p>But even if that was the case, Wang Ming had no plans to throw it away. He wanted to display it as part of his collection.</p>

    <p>After all, this was his first mecha, which had saved his life in a critical moment!</p>

    <p>"We have to find a way to get out of here." Wang Ming observed his surroundings. He wasn't sure how much time had passed in the outside world since he was sucked into the Dead Sea of Space... He knew that time flowed at different rates in different spaces, but he had never researched the exact difference.</p>

    <p>Everyone couldn't be gone, could they...</p>

    <p>Wang Ming didn't think he could be that unlucky.</p>

    <p>The main thing was that he didn't believe Wang Ling would abandon him. Their bond of brotherhood had survived the socialism of cultivation; they definitely weren't brothers just for show!</p>

    <p>His own silly otouto had chosen to give him a sword spirit for his birthday this time, so Wang Ling perhaps had had a foreboding early on that this disaster would befall Wang Ming, yet Wang Ling hadn't taken action. Thus, Wang Ming felt that there probably was some sort of restriction on Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming clearly remembered Wang Ling telling him before about the Heavenly Dao's checks and balances.</p>

    <p>If he meddled too much in the fate of others, it would often end badly.</p>

    <p>"Sword Master, Sir, should this humble servant bring someone over?" Heavenly Materials asked with a very serious expression as he stood erect on the side.</p>

    <p>"Don't bother... My mecha armor is almost useless, and doesn't have enough spirit power now. What will I do if you leave?" Wang Ming sighed.</p>

    <p>After that, he sat down on the ground and stared at the lake. "Let's just wait, I believe someone will come looking for me."</p>

    <p>As soon as he said this, Heavenly Materials sensed a strange fluctuation in the sky. "Sword Master, Sir, it seems that something is about to come out..."</p>

    <p>Then, a crack opened.</p>

    <p><em>Thump thump thump...</em></p>

    <p>Several figures fell from the sky and hit the surface of the lake directly, splashing water on Wang Ming's face.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi and the others swam ashore, eyes narrowed as they glared at Wuji with slightly resentful expressions.</p>

    <p>Wuji was the only one who hadn't gotten wet because she was able to teleport over short distances, so she had already moved just before she fell into the lake.</p>

    <p>When Zhuo Yi reached the bank, Wuji had a "not good" face on her face. "Oh! I'm really sorry! This is the location of the space, I didn't think we would teleport to a lake! It was an operation error! Don't burn me with the Flame of Purification!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi, Luo Chuang, and Xiao Yin: "..."</p>

    <p>Wuji had deliberately mentioned the Flame of Purification, so Zhuo Yi instantly knew that this was the girl's blatant revenge!</p>

    <p>He had threatened Wuji with the Flame of Purification before so that she would be obedient.</p>

    <p>Who knew this chick could be such a vindictive person...</p>

    <p>But Zhuo Yi felt that she was only like this with outsiders; if his <em>shifu </em>were here, she would definitely be the most sincere.</p>

    <p>This revenge act didn't affect them much overall. They were dressed in Daoist robes that had a self-cleaning ability. When the robes got wet, they would dry themselves out in just a few seconds.</p>

    <p>So Zhuo Yi ignored his wet clothes and stepped forward to excitedly take Wang Ming's hands. "I knew Mr Ming was still alive!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming's face was full of pride at the praise. "It was just a basic operation! But I have to thank Heavenly Materials for covering me, otherwise, I might not have been able to get rid of that Ghost Head Blade."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi looked at Heavenly Materials standing next to Wang Ming. He had already noticed earlier on that this was a sword spirit.</p>

    <p>"It looks like this was the birthday gift <em>shifu </em>said he would be giving you!" Zhuo Yi looked Heavenly Materials up and down, and felt that the dead fish eyes were really too prominent, as if it was a trademark that his <em>shifu </em>had directly handed down.</p>

    <p>As expected of a birthday gift from <em>shifu </em>...</p>

    <p>It was because of this prominent characteristic that Zhuo Yi could tell at first glance that this sword spirit was a gift from <em>shifu </em>!</p>

    <p>Wang Ming still hadn't been sure earlier if Heavenly Materials had been a gift from Wang Ling. Now that he had gotten personal confirmation from Zhuo Yi, his face was instantly full of joy.</p>

    <p>Although his otouto was a little foolish, looking after him hadn't been in vain, as expected!</p>

    <p>They shared information, and Wang Ming gave them a rough account of his experience in the Dead Sea of Space.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi frowned when he heard that some mystery person had acted to thwart Ghost Head Blade before Wang Ming finally left the Dead Sea of Space.</p>

    <p>"Mr Ming is saying that someone used a secret weapon to stop Ghost Head Blade?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi stroked his chin. He would have to remember to report this when he had the chance.</p>

    <p>In order for him to "carry the wok" more easily, Wang Ling would tell him everything he had done... so Zhuo Yi was certain that the person who had used a hidden weapon absolutely wasn't his own <em>shifu </em>.</p>

    <p>But who it was remained to be investigated...</p>

    <p>Sure enough, there were hidden dragons and crouching tigers among the teachers this time; it looked like there were many hidden experts present.</p>

    <p>"What does Lao Gudong Xiaoer plan to do next?"</p>

    <p>This was Luo Chuang's first time meeting Wang Ming. Although he had heard the name before, he was only truly understanding who he was now.</p>

    <p>Especially after learning of this young man's real identity as Ling Zhenren's older brother, Luo Chuang held Wang Ming in even higher esteem.</p>

    <p>"The outside world thinks I'm already dead, so it just so happens that I'm free now. I'll join you in the search for Devil King's tomb." Wang Ming shrugged, then looked at Luo Chuang. "Are you a craftsman?"</p>

    <p>"My name is Luo Chuang." Luo Chuang nodded and introduced himself.</p>

    <p>"Oh, it's you." Wang Ming instantly recalled something.</p>

    <p>He remembered that Grandfather Wang's kitchen knives and the tricycle Sheep were serviced at Luo Chuang's shop, and during the destruction of Immortal Mansion's general headquarters in Winter city, he recalled that a craftsman with the surname Luo had taken part in the operation.</p>

    <p>"You should have some materials on you, right?" Wang Ming asked.</p>

    <p>"Yes, Lao Gudong Xiaoer."</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang nodded and directly summoned Rolling Wheels. "Lao Gudong Xiaoer, let me introduce you to my vehicle: Rolling Wheels. Rolling Wheels's toolbox contains all the materials you'll need for crafting artifacts, and it also has a mechanical arm modeled on Lord Jingke's!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>He was a good craftsman, but regrettably, he was a pervert...</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "Do you have an instrument for identifying materials?"</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang nodded. "Yes! The mechanical arm has a replica tongue modeled after Lord Jingke's. The tongue only needs to lick any type of material, and the robot arm will be able to analyze its composition! Let me demonstrate!"</p>

    <p>With that, Luo Chuang stuck his hand into his underpants.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was alarmed. "What the hell?! What are you doing?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi, Xiao Yin and Wuji: "..."</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang rummaged around inside his underpants, then took out a small hammer. "Lao Gudong Xiaoer, don't get me wrong. I'm just used to hiding things in my underpants' storage space..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "..."</p>

    <p>Then, Luo Chuang turned on the switch for the replica tongue.</p>

    <p>He held the hammer up to the tongue and ordered with a perverted grin, "Lick!"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>
