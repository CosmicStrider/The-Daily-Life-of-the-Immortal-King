  <h1>Chapter 834 Wang Ling, Let's Go to KTV</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Whether it was Wang Zhen or Liu Qingyi...</p>

    <p>From his impression of these two people after initial contact, Immortal Toya realized that the inhabitants of the Domain of the Gods in the world above clearly shared pretty much the same line of thinking as the people in the world below. Specifically, the main thing was: when they were outstanding, they were outstanding; when they were tsundere, they were tsundere... After all, mankind in essence was actually the same.</p>

    <p>The Domain of the Gods in the world above was alluring because it was a more advanced sphere for most cultivators. Since ancient times, whether it was ordinary people or cultivators, everyone constantly pursued something better, which was one of the main reasons why mankind always continued to evolve and adapt until now.</p>

    <p>After hearing Wang Zhen's declaration of war, Liu Qingyi was enraged. "Fix the time with Wang Zhen! I can already feel all the blood boiling in my body, and it wants to come out! This Wang Zhen is such an egoistic and arrogant guy. Even talking big about using just one hand and one foot? Did I ask him to?"</p>

    <p>"Don't be angry, Miss Liu..." Immortal Toya laughed. "The two of you calm down first, don't be impatient. For the sake of life experience, Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch is attending a Foundation Establishment high school. I'm afraid that your realms will have to be suppressed if you want to duel there, otherwise you'll put other people in danger..."</p>

    <p>If two Almightys with realms higher than Venerated Immortal level fought at a Foundation Establishment high school, the students of Number 60 High might not even be able to stand under a mere release of their auras! At that moment, Number 60 High School would truly become a graveyard...</p>

    <p>The main thing was that Immortal Toya still needed to find an opportunity to communicate with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Now that Number 60 High School's first semester final exams were coming up, Immortal Toya was guessing that Wang Ling wouldn't be in the mood to deal with this. Wang Ling did previously say that he wanted to ask Wang Zhen about the Domain of the Gods. In the end, because of the exams, he had no time to pay attention to Wang Zhen, so he had left Wang Zhen at Wei Zhi's place all this time, and had stood him up until now.</p>

    <p>In the end, it was still Wang Ling who had to make the arrangements.</p>

    <p>As for setting it up to happen at Number 60 High, Immortal Toya had also thought about it.</p>

    <p>The reason was very simple...</p>

    <p>Because there was no one in the world below who would be able to suppress these two venerable gods at all...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was August 10th on Thursday in the fifteenth week of the semester.</p>

    <p>The final exams would start tomorrow on Friday and end on Sunday. This time, classes were suspended during the period, which meant that students wouldn't have lessons after each exam, and could go home to revise.</p>

    <p>But the vast majority of students wouldn't use this time for revision... Number 60 High had a very tight schedule of lessons and activities this semester, and most of the students viewed the free time from the suspended classes as a way to relax after taking an exam.</p>

    <p>After school was over, Wang Ling was contemplating how to keep his exam marks down the following day, while Guo Hao and several other classmates were already coming up with a stress relief plan for tomorrow.</p>

    <p>Just as Wang Ling was about to make a break for it and leave the classroom, Guo Hao put a hand on his shoulder.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "My Ling! Why don't we go to KTV tomorrow?"</p>

    <p>There was a KTV next to Number 60 High, and Wang Ling had heard that the boss used to be one of Number 60 High's students, so they could get special discounts. The student prices were dirt cheap and affordable even with just pocket money. Most KTVs nowadays had the Space Expansion Skill built in. There were small rooms and big rooms, and the price difference wasn't big or as inflated as in old-school KTVs.</p>

    <p>The thing that cost the most in almost all KTVs nowadays was the service, but for students, they just wanted to sing their hearts out to decompress, which didn't cost much at all.</p>

    <p>Of course, it really wasn't that Wang Ling begrudged the amount!</p>

    <p>Was he that kind of person?</p>

    <p>But one trip to KTV could buy him several crispy noodle snack packets...</p>

    <p>As Wang Ling's deskmate, and after spending time with him throughout the semester, Guo Hao was actually well aware that Wang Ling was a little more introverted, and was probably the type who was reluctant to go out. But there weren't many boys in Grade One, Class Three to begin with, and Guo Hao had asked some of them earlier, who all said no.</p>

    <p>Karaoke was only fun with more people!</p>

    <p>Su Xiao suggested, "I asked Sun Rong and Lin Xiaoyu, but they said they were going window-shopping. Why don't we invite Fang Xing and Jiang Bai from Class Two?"</p>

    <p>When he heard this name, Wang Ling suddenly froze, only remembering then that there was a girl called Sun Rong in their class. Hm... she was the eldest daughter of Huaguo Water Curtain Group (Insert official mocking here).</p>

    <p>"That'll work!"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao nodded, then put one hand on Wang Ling's other shoulder. "Wang Ling, I know you won't refuse us, will you?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>This was a typical case of giving someone an impossible challenge...</p>

    <p>But for the most part, Wang Ling knew the people going to KTV this time, so he could only agree...</p>

    <p>And so, going to KTV was cheerfully decided on, just like that.</p>

    <p>That evening, Guo Hao set up an independent group chat for KTV.</p>

    <p>The members were the people who were going to KTV tomorrow.</p>

    <p>It cost 48 HNY per person, which included lunch and a fruit platter.</p>

    <p>This truly wasn't expensive at all, but after some calculation, Wang Ling realized he could buy a dozen or so crispy noodle snack packets with 48 HNY, so he still begrudged spending it a little.</p>

    <p>A few minutes later, Chen Chao forwarded a piece of news to the group chat. "Oh my god! Wu Zhenjun's album?"</p>

    <p>Su Xiao was blank. "Isn't Wu Zhenjun a teacher? How come he also released an album?"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao chuckled. "After all, Wu Zhenjun is Irascible Dharmaraja Wu Yifan's disciple. Isn't it normal for him to carry on his <em>shifu's </em> legacy?"</p>

    <p>At the Beast King's Remains summer camp not long ago, Wu Zhenjun had left a deep impression on all the students with the remarkable sound wave technique which he inherited from Irascible Dharmaraja Wu Yifan.</p>

    <p>Wu Zhenjun was indeed an outstanding man...</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "Before he became a teacher, Wu Zhenjun debuted as an idol singer. Like his teacher, Irascible Dharmaraja Wu Yifan, the most distinctive features of his performance style is the use of quick musical tempos and electronic beats which numb the scalps of listeners (Note: The above content was copied and pasted from Qiandu Qianke <sup>1</sup> )."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A spin on Baidu Baike, like a Chinese version of Wikipedia.)</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling clicked open the forwarded link from Chen Chao for a look.</p>

    <p>He saw that some of Wu Zhenjun's songs were actually ranked very high, but a lot of doubts had been raised in the comments section.</p>

    <p>"Who is Wu Zhenjun? How come I've never heard of this singer? Also, the entire album is electronic music, is that proper?"</p>

    <p>"Were these numbers bought?"</p>

    <p>"Begging Wu Zhenjun's fans to stop faking numbers <sup>2</sup> , or he will never know how to improve."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(Kris Wu Yifan's fans used bots
to download his songs to
generate fake numbers and
fake traffic, boosting the
performance of his album ..)</dfn>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Where there were skeptics, there were naturally fans defending him.</p>

    <p>"How can you say that about Wu Wu?"</p>

    <p>"Do you know how hard Wu Wu works? He had a fever of sixty degrees, but still stuck to his dream and did his best to sing!"</p>

    <p>"So? Wu Wu took three years to prepare this album as a surprise for his fans. He did this for us! He sings electronic music so that we don't have to carry a rechargeable magic treasure on us when we go out, and everyone can be recharged by listening to his songs!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Seeing this, Wang Ling casually opened a song sample.</p>

    <p>And the most unbelievable thing happened...</p>

    <p>The electric charge in his watch actually slowly started to recover...</p>
