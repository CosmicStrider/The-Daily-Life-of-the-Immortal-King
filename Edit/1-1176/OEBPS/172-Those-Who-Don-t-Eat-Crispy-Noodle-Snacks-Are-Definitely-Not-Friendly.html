  <h1>Chapter 172 Those Who Don't Eat Crispy Noodle Snacks Are Definitely Not Friendly </h1>

  <div>

    <p>In an underground chamber, Jiang Liuyue clutched her chest in agony as she gritted her teeth and struggled to regulate her breathing. The piercing pain of the backlash from the destruction of her clay clone had caused unprecedented injury to her real body. It hurt so much that her complexion turned blue and she bit her lip so hard it started to bleed. Enduring the sharp pain, she used a spirit talisman — Ah Ying, hurry up and reply!</p>

    <p>This was the life talisman which was bound to Jiang Liuying's soul. When it was used, it could tell Jiang Liuyue where her sister was. Previously, she had been operating her clay clone, so she had had no time to spare to use this life talisman to get in touch with Jiang Liuying.</p>

    <p>She hoped her sister wasn't on her way to Shadow Stream's headquarters, since it had already been seized by a group of cats...</p>

    <p>But as the life talisman floated in midair for a long time, there wasn't any response from it. This Master of Shadow Stream thumped the ground resentfully... it was too late!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The Monk took a group of cats with it to search Shadow Stream's headquarters, but after a long time, they were only able to find some elixirs and one-off magic treasures. These magic treasures had been used by Shadow Stream killers on assassination assignments, and in fact were pretty meaningless to the cats of the Independent Regiment, who were the type to meet their enemies head-on.</p>

    <p>Apart from this, there were chests and chests of money. Dozens of large chests were stacked full of hundred yuan bills. There were also some gold bars and antiques, and The Monk roughly calculated that altogether, everything here was worth at least a few billion HNY.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was deeply shocked by this massive fortune. He felt that this definitely was in poor taste on the part of this Master of Shadow Stream, since cultivators usually paid no mind to material wealth.</p>

    <p>In Huaxiu nation, HNY was still the standard currency used, and anything could be bought with HNY. But cultivators only used the HNY for general everyday living. Normally, if they wanted to buy a magic treasure, it was more straightforward and convenient to trade for it with elixirs or magic treasures of equivalent value. Otherwise, it was troublesome to carry around and count millions or tens of millions in cash.</p>

    <p>Oh, it was worth mentioning that when Father Wang had bought that precious Chanel sword for Wang Ling in the beginning, he had grit his teeth and handed over three million in cash. It had taken the shop assistants in the Chanel Immortal Sword flagship store three whole hours to count the amount.</p>

    <p>In the end, this immortal sword hadn't even grown warm in Wang Ling's hand before he had shattered it.</p>

    <p>"Regiment Commander, we hit the jackpot!" When The Monk brought their spoils of war to Zheng Tan, its face was full of excitement.</p>

    <p>"Mm, put them away properly. From now on, all the cats in our Independent Regiment will be able to drink milk and eat fish at leisure!" Zheng Tan put its paws on its hips with pride.</p>

    <p>"But Commander, we found something very strange." As The Monk said this, it ordered some cats to carry a stone chest forward.</p>

    <p>This stone chest actually wasn't big, but it was heavy. It took two cats at the Foundation Establishment stage to carry it. When they placed it on the ground, it clearly sank down slightly in the soft soil.</p>

    <p>Looking at the stone chest, The Monk said, "We found this thing in the innermost room of Shadow Stream's headquarters. It looks pretty old. Commander, do you know what this might be?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Zheng Tan's eyes were fixed on this stone chest. It was square in shape with rounded corners. All four sides were decorated in a tidy pattern and it looked like a handicraft item. The reason why it had captured the attention of The Monk and the other staff officer cats was because they had smelled a faint trace of blood from this stone chest.</p>

    <p>"This thing has clearly come in contact with blood before, but I don't know what it might be." Zheng Tan frowned as it looked at the stone chest, then turned its gaze to Wang Ling. "Immortal Meow, do you have any ideas?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's eyes glimmered slightly. After sweeping his gaze over the whole of the stone chest, he was surprised to find that it was empty — it was actually a mold! And judging from its shape, this mold looked very much like a mask...</p>

    <p>At this moment, the thought of that stone ghost mask flitted through Wang Ling's mind.</p>

    <p>He had felt that the decor on the outside of this stone chest was similar to that of the stone ghost mask.</p>

    <p>In the end, Wang Ling took the stone chest with him, since he thought it could probably provide Lord Diulei plenty of new leads on the stone ghost mask.</p>

    <p>Of course, the cats of the Independent Regiment had no problems with Wang Ling taking the stone chest with him.</p>

    <p>This was Immortal Meow, after all.</p>

    <p>If Immortal Meow had asked them to hand over all their spoils of war, they wouldn't have had any problems with that either!</p>

    <p>To be honest, it was just that Wang Ling was uninterested in these supplies. Also, it was really hard for him to accept the fact that Shadow Stream's headquarters hadn't contained even one crispy noodle snack packet!</p>

    <p>As expected, this bunch of people who didn't eat crispy noodle snacks didn't have any love in them!</p>

    <p>To not even have crispy noodle snacks... no wonder people considered them a terrorist organization!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Zheng Tan and its cats would deal with those Shadow Stream killers who had been burnt like coal, so there was no need for Wang Ling to worry. This group of people had completely lost their ability to fight, and he reckoned that they wouldn't wake up any time soon.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, as Wang Ling was about to leave, he cast a spell on the entrance to Shadow Stream's headquarters; it was a simple travel array which led directly to Songhai First Prison...</p>

    <p>Later, Zheng Tan and his cat army swiftly withdrew with all the supplies. Shortly after they had pulled out of this hilltop headquarters, a busty young maiden wearing a baseball cap and a face mask rapidly approached the peak.</p>

    <p>When she was halfway up the hill, however, she suddenly felt that something was wrong; she hadn't seen a single person on her way up and she had the strange feeling that Shadow Stream's headquarters was too peaceful today.</p>

    <p>"Mo Li clearly sent people to tell me that elder sister was anxious to find me, so why isn't there even a single person around now?" The girl felt that it was very strange; furthermore, she didn't have any other way to contact Jiang Liuyue. When she had escaped from prison, she had accidentally lost the life talisman. It had probably been washed away when she had gone through the sewer.</p>

    <p>The only way now was to get to the peak and take a look; it was possible that elder sister was in a meeting.</p>

    <p>With this thought in mind, the girl continued up the hill. But the closer she got to the peak, the more suspicious she became — she smelled gunpowder smoke!</p>

    <p>"Elder sister!"</p>

    <p>Gritting her teeth in anxiety, Jiang Liuying dashed up to the peak in several large strides. She quickly found the entrance to the headquarters, opened the lid of the well, and jumped down...</p>

    <p>It wasn't until that moment that the girl finally realized that she had been tricked!</p>

    <p>However, it was already too late.</p>

    <p>Carried through a stream of colored light and shadow, the girl felt herself thrown into a space tunnel, and then she fell into a black hole.</p>

    <p>By the time the light and her dizziness had faded, the girl had emerged on a brand new map.</p>

    <p>It was the incomparably thick barrier from before, and that wall which looked too high to climb...</p>

    <p>Songhai First Prison — she had actually been sent back here again!</p>

    <p>At this moment, Jiang Liuying felt despair.</p>
