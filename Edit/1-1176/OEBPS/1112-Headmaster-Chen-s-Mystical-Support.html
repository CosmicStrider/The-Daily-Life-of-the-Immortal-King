  <h1>Chapter 1112 Headmaster Chen's Mystical Support</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Let me introduce everyone to the spell inside this brocade pouch. I call it: Blacklist," said Headmaster Chen.</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>"As its name suggests, this spell can shield you from being tracked by other people, and it's very easy to use. You just need to use it on yourself and say the other party's name. As long as the other party dares reply to you, the blacklist will automatically take effect: For ten hours, perception-type cultivators won't be able to sense your existence."</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen said, "The trick with using this spell is to catch the other party unawares. When all of you have reached your destination, the first thing you should do is greet the students from South Sea Sky High School. Cast Blacklist on yourselves and go ask for their names. Since you'll be meeting them for the first time, I don't think that they won't tell you their names."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was amazed.</p>

    <p>There was actually this sort of operation...</p>

    <p>Put simply, Blacklist was a passive spell which could only be triggered in specific circumstances. This setting was similar to the Golden and Silver Horned Kings' purple gold gourd in <em>Journey to the West</em>, and felt strongly like that well-known refrain, "I call your name; do you dare respond?"</p>

    <p>They just needed to respond!</p>

    <p>And Blacklist would instantly take effect.</p>

    <p>Of course, the thing that Wang Ling was most astonished by wasn't Blacklist itself.</p>

    <p>It was the fact that Headmaster Chen's Blacklist was once again reminiscent of one of Wang Ling's Heavenly Dao spells.</p>

    <p>Looking at the spell composition of Blacklist, Wang Ling was actually able to see elements of the Great Shielding Spell.</p>

    <p>Although Blacklist's effect was far inferior to that of Wang Ling's Great Shielding Spell, there were indeed overlaps in the basic logic.</p>

    <p>If once was a coincidence...</p>

    <p>What if it happened twice?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was increasingly curious about Headmaster Chen.</p>

    <p>The truth was that whether it was Dessert or Blacklist, they were just the tip of the iceberg when it came to Headmaster Chen's extensive array of original support spells.</p>

    <p>A major trait of Headmaster Chen's original support spells was that they were simple, but impractical. In an uncertain situation, however, they could explode with unexpected effects, which was the essence of the Chen clan's support magic!</p>

    <p>"Headmaster, what inspired you to create such support spells?" Sun Rong asked the question that everyone was wondering.</p>

    <p>The truth was that everyone present knew little about Headmaster Chen.</p>

    <p>Headmaster Chen was happy to answer.</p>

    <p>It was a rare chance for the students to learn about him.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, the ten kids sitting here were the more outstanding students who were representing Number 60 High, and he thought it was good to share his story and experiences with them.</p>

    <p>Normally, no one wanted to listen to him go on and on...</p>

    <p>"Do you remember Headmaster Jin from Number 59 High? We were fellow brothers in Seven Stars Sect back then." Headmaster Chen smiled.</p>

    <p>"We remember!" Everyone nodded.</p>

    <p>"It was by fateful coincidence that I went down the path of support magic back then." Headmaster Chen said slowly, "Seven Stars Sect has always been very strict when it comes to their graduation projects. We actually majored in support magic, and our graduation requirement back then was to design an original support spell. Old Jin and I went down different paths.</p>

    <p>"In comparison, Old Jin's support spell had more boost effects, such as helping the mind to focus or increasing strength. It could gather power and boost mental strength in a short period of time, making cultivators stronger and more focused.</p>

    <p>"Old Jin's graduation project back then was utterly remarkable, since his spell used a new concept. It significantly shortened the time required to make hand seals, and boosted the user instantly. What was more, the spell could last for a very long time! Unfortunately, such an outstanding graduation project was ruled out in the first round."</p>

    <p>"Why?" asked Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>"It wasn't that Old Jin's design wasn't remarkable enough, but that there were in fact already so many types of these original boost support spells. Except for the difference in effectiveness and duration, it was basically the same. When our university mentors rejected Old Jin's idea in the first round back then, it gave me new inspiration."</p>

    <p>Hands behind his back, Headmaster Chen said proudly, "The Dessert you're looking at was in fact my university graduation design. It might seem a little ridiculous, but I got a very high graduation evaluation for it.</p>

    <p>"I remember the comment given by the old headmaster of Seven Stars Sect back then: Although Dessert is simple, the Great Dao in it is profound. It is immensely valuable for promoting social relationships and building a harmonious environment. Therefore, this passes."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>In fact, what the old headmaster said was within reason.</p>

    <p>Many people liked to eat dessert because sugar stimulated the brain to produce dopamine, which made people happy. It was the main reason why people in a bad mood liked to eat sweets.</p>

    <p>As for promoting harmony in society...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that this would be largely due to the effect of Dessert winning the other party over. However, this sort of good impression was just temporary; it was a little like the legendary "suspension bridge effect," which was a mistaken assumption that was artificially produced.</p>

    <p>But one thing surprised Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>As an Itinerant Immortal, Headmaster Chen actually majored in support magic.</p>

    <p>To devote himself to studying support magic at his realm... It felt a little like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling had to admit that Headmaster Chen was really talented.</p>

    <p>What the students of Number 60 High didn't know at this point was that Headmaster Chen's support magic had once swept through the world and caused carnage.</p>

    <p>In the current headmaster circle, practically every cultivation school headmaster who knew of and who had fought Headmaster Chen before had once tasted the fear of the Chen clan's support magic...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>While Number 60 High was intensely discussing strategies to deal with the other schools, the other cultivation schools naturally weren't idle. Number 1 Devil-Subduing High School, Titan High School, South Sea Sky High School - the headmasters of these high schools had basically come forward at the same time to guide the students who would be taking part as they discussed strategies before the start of the competition.</p>

    <p>Contrary to what the students from all three high schools had expected, the first school that the headmasters discussed wasn't a top-ranking key city high school as they had imagined, nor a famous one or one that was incredibly strong on the whole.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, the first school which all of them just so happened to be discussing was Number 60 High School...</p>
