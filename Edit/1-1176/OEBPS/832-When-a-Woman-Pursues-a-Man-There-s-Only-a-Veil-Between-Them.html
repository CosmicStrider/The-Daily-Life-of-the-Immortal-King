  <h1>Chapter 832 When a Woman Pursues a Man, There's Only a Veil Between Them</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The young girl who woke up from her coma was surprisingly composed, as if she knew what had happened as well as even the ins and outs of her situation.</p>

    <p>"How long... have I been unconscious?" Miss Liu turned to ask Immortal Toya next to her.</p>

    <p>She felt her legs. They were slightly numb given that she had been lying in bed for so long. Although Jin Shi and Yin Shi massaged her muscles to relax them every day, they still tingled.</p>

    <p>That was because Miss Liu's coma had been a pretty severe one approaching a vegetative state, which tended to happen to cultivators. In a coma, the body's meridians would become blocked and spirit energy wouldn't be able to circulate throughout the body. A person's golden core thus wouldn't be able to rotate on its own, and even the nascent soul would start to become dormant.</p>

    <p>More importantly, this Miss Liu was originally an inhabitant of the Domain of the Gods, so she required a tremendous amount of spirit energy to begin with. However, she directly fell into a coma after coming to the world below. In addition, the spirit energy on Earth was relatively thin, which further aggravated the symptoms of her coma.</p>

    <p>Therefore, in addition to the combined massages by Jin Shi and Yin Shi, Immortal Toya also used acupuncture needles as part of the treatment to clear Miss Liu's meridians and manually circulate spirit energy; the fact that she could directly sit up straight like this was the result of their efforts.</p>

    <p>If she had lain for so long without being tended to, Miss Liu would only have been able to use her thoughts to move every muscle in her body... just like the heroine in the movie <em>Kill Bill </em>.</p>

    <p>"It's already been more than a month since Miss Liu was rescued."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya smiled as gently as possible. He didn't want to startle Miss Liu, but she seemed quite stolid. Furthermore, she was acting as if they knew each other.</p>

    <p>At that moment, she was massaging her slender legs with her hands. Spirit light flickered intermittently in her hands. Because she hadn't used spirit energy in a long time, some of her meridians weren't completely connected, which was in fact a normal phenomenon.</p>

    <p>"Mm, that's pretty much what I expected! Thank you, Immortal Toya!" Miss Liu said.</p>

    <p>"How does Miss Liu know me?"</p>

    <p>"Actually, I was already conscious a few hours ago, but I couldn't open my eyes at all. Just from listening to your two disciples chattering on the side, I know where I am and what happened," said Miss Liu.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya was dazed...</p>

    <p>Awake for a few hours already...</p>

    <p>He sweated a little.</p>

    <p>Thankfully, it wasn't a few days ago!</p>

    <p>Otherwise, if Wang Zhen were here, wouldn't this Miss Liu pounce on him right away?</p>

    <p>"I know that Miss Liu used the kun to come to the world below for the sake of feelings, right?" Immortal Toya opened his mouth.</p>

    <p>"You know that, too?" Miss Liu was surprised.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya usually wasn't someone who meddled in other people's business.</p>

    <p>But after the last time Lord Diulei came to Chrysanthemum Island, and Immortal Toya had mistakenly thought that he had a partner because of the Soul Suppression Ring, which was followed by a series of embarrassing events... Immortal Toya was surprised to discover that he seemed to have potential as a matchmaker!</p>

    <p>Feelings were something that could be cultivated!</p>

    <p>Was there anyone who was born with feelings right away?</p>

    <p>Even in Senior Ling Zhenren's case, it was only after he ate crispy noodle snacks a few times that he became obsessed with them!</p>

    <p>In Immortal Toya's opinion, Wang Zhen and Miss Liu were a perfect match!</p>

    <p>"We actually know a fair bit about Miss Liu. There's an Almighty in our world... He's called Senior Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch. He can perceive a lot of things." Immortal Toya waved his hand as he motioned for Jin Shi and Yin Shi to leave first. He then pulled out a chair and sat down to start talking with Miss Liu.</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch?</p>

    <p>Miss Liu carefully searched her memory for this Daoist name.</p>

    <p>Her scope of understanding couldn't be considered narrow, but she truly didn't have an impression of this name...</p>

    <p>But this Dao Monarch had figured out her feelings; it looked like he indeed was a real big shot!</p>

    <p>"Then, what do you think about these feelings?" Miss Liu asked directly, and didn't dodge the issue.</p>

    <p>"A lot of times, even if the feelings are mutual, forcing the issue is certainly bad. Given Wang Zhen's appearance, there's probably a lot of people pursuing him, so I believe Daoist Wang Zhen has seen countless women... So it may be very difficult to move him through common means."</p>

    <p>Miss Liu thought for a while and then nodded. "That's true! Go on!"</p>

    <p>She had fought Wang Zhen before, and he was indeed thick and rough - she couldn't move him at all when she hit him! Furthermore, he saw through all her arts and techniques, and so was able to effortlessly decipher her various moves, which embarrassed her deeply; presumably, this had a lot to do with the fact that he had seen countless women.</p>

    <p>But Wang Zhen himself didn't know she was the one fighting him, since she concealed her identity before deliberately going off to find him. To this day, Wang Zhen still didn't know why a madman would suddenly put him in a strongarm lock from behind whenever he left the house...</p>

    <p>"So when you deal with Daoist Wang Zhen, I feel that Miss Liu should take his preferences into account. Some people can be coerced but not persuaded, and vice versa."</p>

    <p>"Are you saying I should give him a present? Why should I?" Miss Liu was a little blank.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya smiled a little. "Love should be mutual. Miss Liu, you need to understand the everlasting truth: when a woman pursues a man, there's only a veil between them <sup>1</sup> . Even if Daoist Wang Zhen doesn't like you now, if you put in a little more effort, you'll be able to move him sooner or later."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Part of a Chinese phrase
which is basically saying that
it's easier for a woman to
pursue a man than vice versa ..)</dfn>

    <p>When Immortal Toya said this, Miss Liu's eyes suddenly widened and she looked at Immortal Toya blankly, an unfathomable expression on her face.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya sweated. "Did I say something wrong?"</p>

    <p>"No, no, no... There's nothing wrong with what you said."</p>

    <p>Miss Liu was dazed. "But somehow I feel that Immortal Toya and I... are talking about two different things."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "Didn't you come here because you were chasing Wang Zhen?"</p>

    <p>Miss Liu: "That's right! I'm chasing him! That's why I hid inside the belly of a kun he was raising."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "Then..."</p>

    <p>Miss Liu: "But I didn't say that I'm chasing him because I like him, did I? When did I say I want to marry him?"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "Huh???"</p>

    <p>Miss Liu: "It's the elders who want me to marry him to unite our families. I was forced! I don't like him at all! He's good-looking, but he's not my type! I have no feelings for him! But our elders decided on their own and fixed our wedding date, which was annoying! So I came up with a brilliant idea! I decided to sneak into the belly of a kun he was raising, chase him to the world below, and then look for an opportunity to kill him! When a woman pursues a man, there's only a veil between them! When a woman hammers a man, there's only a kun between them!"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "..."</p>
