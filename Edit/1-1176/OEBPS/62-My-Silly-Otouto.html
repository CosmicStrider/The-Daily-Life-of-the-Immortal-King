  <h1>Chapter 62 My Silly Otouto </h1>

  <div>

      <p>Later...</p>

      <p>In all likelihood, this could be the Master of Shadow Stream, the legendary 36D maiden. She was apprehended by the cultivation police for interrogation, and Wang Ming followed them. As a directly involved party, he had to go with them to give his statement.</p>

      <p>Lao Gudong and Director Xie walked Wang Ming to the school gate, and Director Xie gripped his hands tightly. "It's only thanks to Mr Wang that the villains' plan was derailed, otherwise who knows what the consequences could have been!"</p>

      <p>"Teacher Xie, you flatter me, I was just doing what anyone would do. Upholding justice, being chivalrous... isn't this the norm for cultivators?"</p>

      <p>"But I'm very curious... why can't I feel even a hint of spirit energy from Mr Wang? Could it be that Mr Wang, you have a magic treasure on you?"</p>

      <p>"A magic treasure? Do I need a magic treasure at my stage?" Wang Ming shook his head and smiled mysteriously.</p>

      <p>As Wang Ming spoke, it suddenly hit Director Xie and Lao Gudong... if his aura wasn't being shielded by a magic treasure, the only reason left was that this Mr Wang had an extremely high cultivation realm! Otherwise, it wouldn't have been so easy for this Shadow Stream Gold Ribbon assassin to be defeated!</p>

      <p>On the side, Lao Gudong couldn't help sighing. "Who would have thought that Mr Wang would have such unfathomable power at such a young age â€” I truly admire you!"</p>

      <p>Wang Ling: "..." Wasn't this deceiving them a bit too damn well?!</p>

      <p>"Mr Wang, is this your cat? I see that it seems to be following you."</p>

      <p>While they were talking, Director Xie had noticed Wang Ling.</p>

      <p>He had been worried that the killer maiden would rouse halfway, so he had followed Wang Ming. He had just been contemplating earlier if he had to knock her out again.</p>

      <p>Now, seeing the police stick a restraining talisman seal on this tied-up rice dumpling girl, he could finally breathe a sigh of relief.</p>

      <p>Wang Ming hadn't obtained permission before coming to deliver the talisman to Wang Ling, so the Huaxiu government hadn't sent bodyguards to protect him. If something happened to the most powerful brain here... Wang Ling couldn't even imagine how much panic it would cause. A thorough investigation of Number 59 High School and Number 60 High School would be inevitable, which in turn wouldn't bode well at all for his hidden identity.</p>

      <p>Although he was unwilling to admit it, Wang Ling couldn't deny that for better or worse, he and his dumbass elder brother were in the same boat.</p>

      <p>After turning it over in his mind, Wang Ling had thus still decided to follow him for the time being until the police arrived to ensure Wang Ming's safety.</p>

      <p>He hadn't expect Director Xie to suddenly notice him at this point in time.</p>

      <p>For some, their "idiocy" was reflected in their IQs and EQs, but Wang Ming's "idiocy" was reflected in the details of daily life, such as being addled by a woman's charm or disguising himself as a cultivator... normally, however, Wang Ming responded quickly in emergency situations.</p>

      <p>"Director Xie is referring to this cat... perhaps I have something attractive on me which it's interested in."</p>

      <p>Wang Ling: "..." Attractive your ass!</p>

      <p>Hearing Director Xie mention Wang Ling in his cat form, Wang Ming smiled a little evilly.</p>

      <p>He then bent over to pick up Wang Ling the cat. "Upsy-daisy!"</p>

      <p>Wang Ling: "..." Up your damn head!</p>

      <p>Wang Ling realized that this was the first time he was being 'molested' by this dumbass!</p>

      <p>...Motherfucker!</p>

      <p>Just you wait!</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>The rice dumpling girl was secured in the prison cage at the back of the cultivation police defense vehicle and guarded by two policewomen. Wang Ming sat obediently in the backseat with a policemn each sitting on his left and right.</p>

      <p>Given his personality, he definitely wouldn't claim this so-called glory for himself. Because when all was said and done, he had used his surface identity Wang Xiaoer, not Wang Ming, so he didn't feel any sense of accomplishment in this matter.</p>

      <p>The only thing that gratified Wang Ming in this mission to deliver the talisman to Wang Ling at Number 59 High School was that he had actually been able to tease his silly otouto <sup>1</sup> ! Although he hadn't had the opportunity to issue the hundredth challenge to Wang Ling this time, he felt that this trip hadn't been a fruitless one.</p>

      <dfn><sup>1</sup>('Otouto' is Japanese for "little brother.")</dfn>

      <p>On the road, Wang Ming deduced from the two policemen's slightly sullen faces that they had been just about to get off work when they had been called out here. Furthermore, they had caught a big fish this time, so they were definitely going to be working overtime... hence their extremely bad moods.</p>

      <p>The two policemen gazed steadily at Wang Ming. "Mr Wang, can you please present your ID card? In order to save time, we'll start taking notes now."</p>

      <p>Wang Ming obediently produced his ID card. Seeing the name and place of birth on the card, the two policemen were taken aback.</p>

      <p>Xiangxieshuige in Yunding Heavenly Palace, Tianba city, Huaxiu nation...</p>

      <p>While Tianba city did exist, what the hell kind of place was Yunding Heavenly Palace?</p>

      <p>Dumbstruck, these two policemen of the people looked at the place of birth on the card for a moment, then looked at Wang Ming with expressions like they were suffering from stomach pains. "Mr Wang... now is not the time to fool around, alright?"</p>

      <p>Wang Ling felt wronged. "Comrade policemen, do you really think you can tell that an ID card is fake just by looking at it?"</p>

      <p>"Mr Wang, do you know that if you use a fake ID card, we will have to bring you in for a cup of tea <sup>2</sup> ?!"</p>

      <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is the equivalent of 'having a chat' or interrogating someone.)</dfn>

      <p>"Oh... Pu'er tea or Long Jing tea? An '82 Sprite would be even better!"</p>

      <p>"..."</p>

      <p>Since they had to work overtime today, the two policemen weren't in a good mood. Now that they were being played around with like this, one of them glared at Wang Ming. "Then let's test it! If your ID card turns out to be fake, I'll lock you up for fifteen days!"</p>

      <p>"...Do as you wish." Wang Ming shrugged his shoulders without fear.</p>

      <p>As a result, the two policemen in the car checked the verification list produced by the card scanner after two minutes...</p>

      <p>After scrutinizing his bizarre character experience, the two men stared at the sentence "The above information has been verified by the National Cultivation Police Department of Huaxiu Nation" and sunk into deep thought... they even began to doubt their own lives...</p>

      <p>...</p>

      <p>Roughly less than half an hour after Wang Ming had been taken to the police station to give his statement, a world limited edition black Aoguanhai <sup>3</sup> combat vehicle rolled to a steady stop outside the main entrance of the cultivation police station.</p>

      <dfn><sup>3</sup>(This is a pain to explain because it doesn't really have any bearing on the context of the chapter ... it's a reference to a Barack Obama meme in China, and we guess the author got a kick out of it and turned it into a brand name. For the
detailed explanation, you can check out the following: https://www.quora.com/How-is-Obama-perceived-by-Chinese-people and http://hanyuxiaofaxian.tumblr.com/post/34832577913/)</dfn>

      <p>Two scientific researchers in white gowns hastily got out of the car and rushed into the police station. Less than five minutes later, they emerged with Wang Ming in tow.</p>

      <p>The two policemen who had been responsible for taking down Wang Ming's statement followed him to the entrance. They were surprised to find that their police chief had actually personally come to see Wang Ming off, waving goodbye with an apologetic smile.</p>

      <p>The two policemen were dumbfounded. Who the hell was this person?</p>

      <p>Only after that world limited edition black combat vehicle drove away did the police chief sigh with relief and turn to the two policemen to exclaim, "The two of you, you almost brought disaster down on us!"</p>
