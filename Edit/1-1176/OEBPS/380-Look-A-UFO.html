  <h1>Chapter 380 Look! A UFO! </h1>

  <div>

    <p>Going to all this trouble to capture it... Er Ha really didn't know what to say. It felt that it had actually already been very low-key at the assessment center today. Was it because it could speak and write despite not yet having reached second class, so they felt that it was "unusually gifted," and thus wanted to catch it? Wasn't this Society of Saints a little too sloppy?</p>

    <p>Furthermore, Er Ha had a feeling that while these people in front of it might be connected to the Society of Saints, they were definitely not from the society. Would a state-certified talent organization, which cooperated with major education institutions through standard channels, need to specially send people to abduct so-called talents in broad daylight through non-standard means?</p>

    <p>If these people were really from the Society of Saints, Er Ha could only feel that this bunch had been kicked in the head by a donkey.</p>

    <p>In order to confirm its guess, Er Ha asked, "Are you from the Society of Saints?"</p>

    <p>"You can think that way." The bone dragon man smiled.</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Er Ha nodded.</p>

    <p>Hm... it was sure now that this bunch wasn't from the Society of Saints, and at the very least, they hadn't been sent under official orders. If they truly were from the Society of Saints, would it have been so hard to admit it? The country was now abuzz with news about the Society of Saints which had shaken up the academic world. Everyone in every city knew of them, and working for such an organization would be an honor for most people.</p>

    <p>Er Ha sighed in its heart. It seldom came out, and it didn't want to cause trouble; if Little Master Ling found out, it was likely he wouldn't be happy.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, Er Ha pointed one paw at the sky. "Look! A UFO!"</p>

    <p>But these men in black weren't fooled at all.</p>

    <p>The bone dragon man couldn't help laughing. "Do you think we're three-year-olds? How could we fall for that?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha didn't give up, and pointed at the sky again. "Look! Yui Aragaki <sup>1</sup>!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Yui Aragaki is a Japanese celebrity popular with a lot of men.)</dfn>

    <p>The bone dragon man: "It's no use, just come with us quietly... Since we started doing this, we've long ceased to be moved by anything but our task objective."</p>

    <p>Er Ha felt a sudden chill. These men weren't just perverts bent on dogs, they were also gay!</p>

    <p>In that moment, Er Ha felt that it had to use its K.O. move.</p>

    <p>Once again, and for the last time, Er Ha pointed at the sky. "Look! The Playful Blue Moon!"<sup>2</sup></p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(This is actually a Chinese RPG game..)</dfn>

    <p>In that instant, these men in black were actually distracted for some reason, and as if they had been hypnotized, they were compelled to look behind them in the direction that Er Ha's paw was pointing at!</p>

    <p>Hm... The sun today was very big, and there was nothing else!</p>

    <p>In a flash, they came back to their senses!</p>

    <p>The bone dragon man and the others were flustered! Shit! They had actually been played!</p>

    <p>When they turned back to look, the green-furred dog had already slipped away, and was visibly and swiftly turning into a small green dot on the distant horizon.</p>

    <p>"Chase it!"</p>

    <p>The bone dragon man gnashed his teeth in rage and yelled.</p>

    <p>The five people didn't give up; one after another, they brought out their magic treasures and split up in three directions as they began their pursuit.</p>

    <p>It was very clear that this wasn't the first time the five men had done this as they were all very familiar with the nearby streets.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Er Ha hadn't expected this bunch of people impersonating the Society of Saints to be so obsessed with it... Also, it could feel that the other party had planted a spirit marker on it.</p>

    <p>Not only that, it wasn't very familiar with the environment around the spirit beast assessment center; the place Er Ha was the most familiar with in the city was around the market which Mother Wang and the old man frequented.</p>

    <p>In short, it wasn't in Er Ha's favor to be chased down like this.</p>

    <p>At that moment, its first thought was Guo Hao's family's Soul Servant Shop. It knew that the Soul Servant Shop was in the city center, and that it wasn't far from the spirit beast assessment center. As an established and reputable pet shop, it occupied a prime location.</p>

    <p>As long as he could escape there, this bunch of people should give up on catching it, right?</p>

    <p>This was Er Ha's thought.</p>

    <p>The address had been written on the many bags of New Orleans fly-flavored dog food which Guo Hao had supplied them with previously, and Er Ha remembered it very clearly. However, the problem was that now that it was being chased, it had no time to settle down and study the route.</p>

    <p>How embarrassing... it was still immature as a dog.</p>

    <p>But just as Er Ha emerged from an alley onto a street, a small black car suddenly sped over to the side of the road â€” the driver was actually Wei Zhi!</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi didn't stop the car, and only slowed down to beckon Er Ha over, the car's rear window already open. "No time to explain! Get in!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>At that moment, Er Ha didn't say a word more, and jumped directly from the mouth of the alley into the moving black car.</p>

    <p>It was a well-coordinated performance between a person and a dog!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Hi, Brother Dog! As expected, we're destined to meet!" Wei Zhi greeted Er Ha through the rearview mirror.</p>

    <p>Er Ha had actually never believed in fate, but today it felt that it and Wei Zhi really did share a deeper connection...</p>

    <p>"How did you know I was here?" In the car, Er Ha stared at Wei Zhi and felt that it was something of a miracle.</p>

    <p>"Brother Dog, did you forget when I said that you have a distinctive aura? Every spirit beast has an aura that is unique to them, and only the people in our family are able to sniff out the minute differences in aura."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi couldn't help smiling. "Since there is a way to sniff out this unique aura, there is naturally a way to track it. Just as I left the assessment center, I suddenly smelled a familiar aura when I was passing by a street. I could also sense that it was unusually dense - that normally only happens when a spirit beast is in danger."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "Let me be clear, I wasn't deliberately following you; I only set out a minute after you left."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "I just happened to pass by that street; I didn't see the bus stand or that group of men in black chasing you."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "In short, Brother Dog, everything that happens between you and me is destiny!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi steered the black car along the road, ignoring all obstacles. Er Ha was amazed to discover that Wei Zhi was very good at driving; given his skill level, it would be a real pity if he didn't take part in the The Fast and the Furious series.</p>

    <p>But this still wasn't enough to completely shake off that bunch of men in black pursuing them from behind.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi was getting pissed off. "Who are they... five Golden Core cultivators for the sake of catching one dog. That's so weird!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha sighed. "They planted a spirit marker on me; I need to think of a way to wash it off."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "How are you going to do that?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Take some twists and turns nearby first. I'll lick myself with my saliva, and it'll wash off."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi: "Including... your anus?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>
