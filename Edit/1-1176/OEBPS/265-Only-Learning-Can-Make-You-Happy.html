  <h1>Chapter 265 Only Learning Can Make You Happy? </h1>

  <div>

    <p>These scarlet words were projected into the void, and Wang Ling could even detect the real smell of blood from them. If this was just the game's special effects, then it was really too realistic!</p>

    <p>He frowned, and had a vague sense of foreboding.</p>

    <p>In contrast, Lie Mengmeng was clearly very excited, because the game's actual quality far exceeded his expectations. This kind of high-tech holographic technology which involved connecting a USB to a computer screen to directly create projections wasn't actually anything difficult to implement nowadays. However, to achieve this level of realism, Lie Mengmeng guessed that an advanced illusion spell must have been integrated into the technology.</p>

    <p>Generally, ordinary people wouldn't be able to play this kind of game, which incorporated cultivation spells in order to make it more authentic. But Escape was different; from the latest game preview last month, it was currently the only MMORPG in the world to allow unrestricted participation.</p>

    <p>Under the scarlet characters were two options, "yes" and "no."</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng looked in the direction of "yes," and very quickly the game's loading screen started up.</p>

    <p>A string of words appeared in the void.</p>

    <p>"Do you think that only learning can make you happy?</p>

    <p>"Do you think that only studying every day will make you feel good?</p>

    <p>"Do you think that if you don't study for a day, you'll be completely miserable?</p>

    <p>"Completely wrong! ...Actually, there's nothing wrong with playing games!</p>

    <p>"In moderation, games are good for the brain, while it's game addiction that's harmful to your health..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Staring at this slightly evasive warning about addiction, the corners of Wang Ling's mouth couldn't help twitching. After that, he saw the final loading image, which was a logo of two axes crossed together. Below it were the words: "Trademark of Fresh Hatchet Technology."</p>

    <p>It was only when Lie Mengmeng saw this that he started to think it was a little strange; from memory, Escape wasn't produced by this games company... However, he was so drawn in by the game as it unfolded that he actually very quickly forgot about this issue altogether.</p>

    <p>Following the plot, Wang Ling and Lie Mengmeng appeared in an ambulance that was on its way to an asylum.</p>

    <p>"You are the second group of test subjects to have been sent to this world, and also the most outstanding batch." A voice came from the side.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling turned his head to see an old man in a white coat staring at him. He looked to be in his fifties or sixties and had a thin figure. He was wearing a pair of spectacles, and a full string of syringes hung around his waist, which looked very odd.</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng knew that this was definitely some type of Frankenstein setup. This was also his first time encountering an NPC <sup>1</sup> in a holographic environment, so he couldn't help reaching out to touch the man.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Non Player Characters are the
computer-generated
characters in a game ..)</dfn>

    <p>It was too realistic; this was too cool!</p>

    <p>"Before I explain the mission..."</p>

    <p>The corner of the old man's mouth twitched, and he couldn't help but look at Lie Mengmeng. "Please take this a little more seriously... can you stop pinching my face first?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, sorry!" Lie Mengmeng hastily withdrew his hand.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>The old man was silent for a bit as he looked at the two of them. "You must have already realized that you're under a very strong illusion spell. I'm sending you to an asylum, and the effects of this illusion won't wear off until you've completed the deity lord's mission. Your mission is to fight alongside the other team that will also arrive at the asylum and escape the place."</p>

    <p>"An ongoing illusion spell?" Lie Mengmeng was a little surprised. Escape was indeed the only MMORPG in the world to incorporate spells in order to make it more realistic, but he never thought that the game would actually have a mechanism where you wouldn't be able to leave until you completed the mission.</p>

    <p>"In other words, if we don't complete the mission, we can't quit the game, right?" asked Lie Mengmeng as he looked at the old man.</p>

    <p>"That's right."</p>

    <p>The old man's expression was enigmatic as he gave them a sinister smile.</p>

    <p>"Then... what if your mom calls you to go eat?" Lie Mengmeng couldn't help ridiculing.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>The old man: "..."</p>

    <p>"What if someone hasn't finished their homework?"</p>

    <p>The old man: "..."</p>

    <p>"If someone can't pass a checkpoint, will you still forcibly keep them inside? This mechanism is too unscientific!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>The old man broke out in a sweat and the expression on his face suddenly turned extremely fierce. "The game is the game! Before you complete it, don't even think of leaving! And let me tell you, in this illusion, you can feel pain, get hurt, and even die..."</p>

    <p>"Die?"</p>

    <p>When Lie Mengmeng heard this, he was finally stunned.</p>

    <p>The old man chuckled. "How? Are you afraid now?"</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng's next words almost caused the old man to vomit blood. "Damn! You even have a revival token mechanism in this game?"</p>

    <p>The old man felt like he was going crazy. "..."</p>

    <p>Suddenly, he pulled out a syringe and ruthlessly jabbed the back of Lie Mengmeng's hand. The cold needle pierced Lie Mengmeng's skin, making him feel a real stab of pain, and he yelled despite himself. "Hurts hurts hurts..."</p>

    <p>He realized that his hand was actually really bleeding!</p>

    <p>Seeing how Lie Mengmeng was bleeding and had clearly felt the pain, Wang Ling finally realized that there was something fishy about this game.</p>

    <p>This illusion spell was very unusual!</p>

    <p>Generally, an illusion would automatically fracture when a person felt pain, but this illusion spell was obviously more advanced, and was the kind that was able to penetrate deep into a person's consciousness.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was now utterly sure that this Escape absolutely wasn't the one that Lie Mengmeng had heard of... but was a deadly contest disguised as a game.</p>

    <p>Thanks to that USB, whoever received this game would enter this illusion.</p>

    <p>Was this a prank?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's eyes suddenly turned serious.</p>

    <p>In just a short instant, he had already thought of a way to break the illusion and leave without any problems. However, he couldn't intervene for anyone else trapped in the game. He had to find a way to help Lie Mengmeng break the illusion spell.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, however, Lie Mengmeng was completely unaware of how serious the situation was. This damn otaku rubbed the place where the old man had jabbed him and asked, "What did you inject in me?"</p>

    <p>"Hehehe, does it hurt?" The old man sneered and said, "What I just gave you is a neurotoxin, which will spread in twenty-four hours! If you make it to the final checkpoint, you'll get a hint about the antidote."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling narrowed his eyes slightly. It was as he had expected... this toxin was real!</p>

    <p>He could clearly see traces of the neurotoxin as it sank into the back of Lie Mengmeng's hand to enter his bloodstream.</p>

    <p>"Hehehe, now then..." The old man finally turned his gaze to Wang Ling, and at the same time plunged the syringe ruthlessly into Wang Ling's hand. "It's your turn!"</p>

    <p>But very quickly, he discovered a serious problem!</p>

    <p>He realized... that his syringe couldn't pierce Wang Ling's skin at all!</p>

    <p>It turned into an embarrassing scene...</p>
