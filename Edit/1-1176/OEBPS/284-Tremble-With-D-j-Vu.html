  <h1>Chapter 284 Tremble With Déjà Vu </h1>

  <div>

    <p>If it was due to the Ice Crystal Array, then their current situation could be explained.</p>

    <p>This was a magic array which could duplicate a region and create a mirror space which people could hide in; there was no better way to hide oneself. However, the array's major drawback was that it consumed a great deal of spirit energy, so when this holy array was set up, a spirit vein was required in order for the array to keep running.</p>

    <p>However, Cailian Zhenren still had some doubts. "But I remember that the last owner of the Ice Crystal Array... was Immortal She Pi?</p>

    <p>"Back then, there had been a spirit vein under his secret base. He escaped into the mirror space created by the Ice Crystal Array many times whenever he was injured," Cailian Zhenren continued. "But as far as I know, after he was arrested that year, both the array spirit of this holy array and the spirit vein were together confiscated by the nation. So how would it have fallen into Immortal Mansion's hands?"</p>

    <p>Furrowing his brow, Wang Ling also thought it was very strange.</p>

    <p>But with regard to the current situation, he could confirm without a doubt that the camouflage in front of them was caused by the holy "Ice Crystal Array" of legend.</p>

    <p>The mirror space created by the Ice Crystal Array wasn't an illusion spell, so it was very difficult to see through; even the most sophisticated equipment wouldn't necessarily be able to detect any fluctuations.</p>

    <p>However, it couldn't escape Wang Ling's notice.</p>

    <p>He had actually already considered it as soon as they had arrived at Sanyuan Road.</p>

    <p>But another thing puzzled him, and that was Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>Fang Xing seemed unusually sensitive to the Ice Crystal Array.</p>

    <p>"How strong is this group from Immortal Mansion?" Dharmaraja couldn't help trembling. To even possess a holy array — its background was truly staggering.</p>

    <p>"Previously, Senior Immortal and I were trapped in a game illusion, and this bunch even had an array spirit at Itinerant Immortal level, so actually, it isn't strange that they would have a holy array..." Luo Chuang waved his palm-leaf fan; actually, he hadn't finished speaking, and wanted to say: However, Ling Zhenren used Lord Jingke to chop that Itinerant Immortal-level array spirit into pieces... But before he said it, Luo Chuang gave it some thought, and in the end he zipped his lips. This was because he had suddenly felt an immense burst of spirit energy from Ling Zhenren next to him, which scared him into keeping quiet.</p>

    <p>This fluctuation of spirit energy was mixed with immense spiritual pressure, coalescing together in Wang Ling's Heavenly Eye.</p>

    <p>This powerful energy caused the snow around them to melt; like ripples spreading out from Wang Ling's pupils, the fluctuation of spirit energy made even the earth tremble.</p>

    <p>"To break through the mirror image created by the Ice Crystal Array, we need to gather a huge amount of spirit energy..." Lord Diulei and the others moved away from Wang Ling. The spiritual pressure was so intense that even just standing next to him, they felt it hard to breathe.</p>

    <p>Ling Zhenren's strength was truly frightening!</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja was utterly overwhelmed as he watched Wang Ling shake slightly with this immense amount of spirit energy, warping the air around him.</p>

    <p>For someone unaware of the situation, they would have definitely thought that Wang Ling was furious...</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang felt like he had seen something like this before, and he nudged Lord Diulei with his elbow and asked, "Senior Immortal, do you feel like this quake and unfathomable spiritual pressure seem familiar?"</p>

    <p>"Mm... maybe..." Lord Diulei nodded. "Have you watched the TV drama The Xiao Family Compound filmed by the Xiao Clan?"</p>

    <p>"No."</p>

    <p>"Go and have a look. The moment the protagonist says 'Life has its ups and downs,' and announces that he's breaking off his engagement <sup>1</sup> ... his tension and the cry of his heart then are very similar to Brother Ling at the moment."</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(This is a common Chinese
phrase, a loose, literal
translation of which is '30
years of the East, 30 years
of the West.' In this context,
it is probably a reference to
the novel 'Battle Through
The Heavens,' in which the protagonist utters these
words before his
engagement is broken off.)</dfn>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After gathering spirit energy for long enough, even Wang Ling felt that his Heavenly Eye now had prehistoric powers.</p>

    <p>"Everyone, watch out!"</p>

    <p>Behind him, everyone's expressions couldn't help turning serious, and they hurriedly set up magical barriers.</p>

    <p>About five seconds later...</p>

    <p>Everyone saw Ling Zhenren's eyes suddenly shoot out two dragon-like beams of light that directly crashed into the air in front of them, as if it was trying to break through some dimensional wall.</p>

    <p>If Lord Diulei had to describe it, this incredible scene was just like seeing Gyarados release its hyper beam <sup>2</sup> for the first time.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(From the series 'Pokemon.')</dfn>

    <p>The instant this Heavenly Eye light beam smashed against that invisible spatial wall, everyone could vaguely see an actual crack in the space.</p>

    <p>"Is it going to split open?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei narrowed his eyes as the area hit by the powerful beam gradually darkened.</p>

    <p>There was the smell of something burning...</p>

    <p>Everyone then noticed that where there had initially been an invisible spatial wall, a man-sized opening had actually been burned into it.</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang and Dharmaraja's jaws dropped. They had thought that Ling Zhenren was just trying out something, and had completely never expected that he would actually be able to break the spatial wall open.</p>

    <p>This was a mirror space replicated by a holy array, and the spatial wall was invisible. It required a tremendous amount of spirit energy just to find a chink in the wall before you could even think about breaking it open. Forget about gathering the spirit energy, it was practically impossible for ordinary people to find a crack in the spatial wall.</p>

    <p>It was fair to say that Ling Zhenren's prowess was once again unfathomable to everyone present.</p>

    <p>It was already difficult enough locating the spatial wall, let alone actually breaking through it...</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya's astonishment was no less than the shock he had felt when he had seen Wang Ling close the Gate Between Worlds with just one hand.</p>

    <p>"Wow, Brother Ling, does this technique of yours have a name?" asked Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling shook his head. This was just the energy beam that was released after maximum accumulation of spirit energy in the Heavenly Eye. The difficult part was controlling it as it amassed; only when the dense spirit energy formed into a point could it then release its formidable power.</p>

    <p>Of course, this technique had a major requirement — only cultivators with Sage Bodies could use it, otherwise a person's eyeballs might burst halfway through gathering the energy together.</p>

    <p>"Since it's such a powerful technique, how about we give it a name?" Lord Diulei suggested.</p>

    <p>Luo Chuang: "Sorrowful Beam <sup>3</sup> ?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>3</sup>(Probably a reference to the
'Sorrowful Palm' martial art
technique in the Chinese
series 'The Romance of the
Condor Heroes.')</dfn>

    <p>Toya Immortal: "Mystic Eyes of Death Perception <sup>4</sup> ?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>4</sup>(A reminder that this a type of
power that allows someone to
"perceive death" or the
"conceptual" death of a being,
and comes from the visual
novels 'Tsukihime' and 'The
Garden of Sinners.')</dfn>

    <p>Cailian Zhenren: "A Stare That Can Make You Pregnant <sup>5</sup> ?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>5</sup>(This is a reference to the
Japanese actor Miura Haruma,
who has played various
characters that wind up
impregnating women, so the
joke is that he can stare at any
woman and make them
pregnant..)</dfn>

    <p>Fang Xing: "Life-Disintegrating Ray <sup>6</sup> ?"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>6</sup>(From the series 'League of Legends.')</dfn>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Mm, not bad, not bad... anything else?" Lord Diulei nodded his head. "Are there any short and awe-inspiring names? When Brother Ling shot two energy beams out of his eyes, weren't you a little moved by this stunning scene?"</p>

    <p>At that point, Dharmaraja rubbed his jaw, scratched his head, then chuckled a little crudely. "I have one!"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei: "Let's hear it."</p>

    <p>Dharmaraja: "Two! Waterfalls! Entering! Holes! <sup>7</sup> "</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>7</sup>(The Chinese word for
'waterfall' has the same
pronunciation as 'dragon,' and
the phrase 'two dragons
entering holes' ... probably
doesn't need an explanation ..)</dfn>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
