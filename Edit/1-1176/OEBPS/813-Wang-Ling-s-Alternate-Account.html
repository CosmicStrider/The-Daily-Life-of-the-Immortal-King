  <h1>Chapter 813 Wang Ling's Alternate Account</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Leader of the recreation hall...</p>

    <p>Prior to the Office of Strategic Deception's opening ceremony, all the major sects had already investigated its registration details. Everyone naturally knew about this recreation hall, since it was one of the seven core departments that the Office of Strategic Deception had specifically made public. Furthermore, this department's main role was to sell snacks inside the sect... To put it bluntly, it was more or less like a school's snack counter.</p>

    <p>A lot of people weren't clear on why the Office of Strategic Deception would set up this department.</p>

    <p>The only thing they could be sure of was that the identity of this department leader definitely wasn't simple!</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch...</p>

    <p>This was a Daoist name that no one present had heard of before.</p>

    <p>In fact, Cailian Zhenren had deliberately proposed this sideshow contest.</p>

    <p>All the prominent sect leaders in the cultivation circle were gathered here today for the celebration of the sect's founding; this was a great opportunity to create an image of "Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch." For one thing, it would build prestige for the Office of Strategic Deception as a new sect in front of everyone. On top of that, it would effectively wash away the outside attention that Wang Ling had drawn when he used the Daoist name "Ling Zhenren."</p>

    <p>So this time, Wang Ling sent half a clone, but it had been molded into a particular appearance, even including its height, and it looked nothing like Wang Ling's actual appearance.</p>

    <p>"Whenever I asked Brother Ling to help out before, he always used the image of Ling Zhenren. Thinking back on it, however, this really was too indiscreet. Brother Ling is someone who likes to keep a low profile, so this activity this time is also for the sake of misleading the public. To put it bluntly, this is to help Brother Ling set up an alternate account!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>This explanation was quite simple and crude!</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "While a lot of people have never seen Master before, this is also Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch's first appearance. Wouldn't someone figure out that they're in fact the same person?"</p>

    <p>"Don't worry about that."</p>

    <p>Inside the machine room, Lord Diulei waved his hand and said, "I made this Daoist name 'Ling Zhenren' an honorary visiting official of the sect. He'll appear later with the other VIPs on the immortal warship."</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin: "Is that also a clone?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei shook his head. "No, that's the human replica magic treasure which Brother Wang Ming made. He also made some changes to its appearance, but that's a secret for the time being. The replica Ling Zhenren on the immortal warship is now wearing a full suit of armor, just like an armored warrior!"</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin and Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei pressed the call button. "Attention, everyone, Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch is about to go on stage!"</p>

    <p>After receiving the message, Wang Han stepped to one side. The sound of gears turning rang out on the stage as it slowly split apart down the center.</p>

    <p>Then, a battle arena slowly rose up.</p>

    <p>This was a standard fifty by fifty meters battle arena. The entire arena had been specially designed so that it was extremely resistant to attacks, and furthermore could retain memories of its shape; even if it was damaged beyond recognition, it could restore itself.</p>

    <p>When this arena appeared in front of the audience, the legendary Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch ascended together with it, standing in the very middle of the entire arena.</p>

    <p>"Is this Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch?"</p>

    <p>The people present gazed at the young man in the center of the arena. He was very thin, and his skin couldn't be considered fair, but was the healthy color of wheat... Most importantly, his face seemed a little familiar to some people.</p>

    <p>Especially Er Ha - when it saw this young man's appearance, it was stunned for an instant.</p>

    <p>It was sure that when Little Master Ling had been molding this face, he had to have used someone's image as reference, and this person was someone it was very familiar with! Lord Diulei smiled and said, "This image of Brother Ling's clone is modeled on Senior Wang's appearance when he was young."</p>

    <p>Er Ha was instantly struck by realization — it turned out this was Father Wang's younger self!</p>

    <p>No wonder Er Ha felt like it had seen this face before — there were photos on the bookshelf in Father Wang's study of him as a young man.</p>

    <p>Er Ha remembered that Father Wang was from the countryside. Before coming to the city, he had lived in a village with Old Man Wang. In those days, Father Wang had been known in all the nearby villages as a handsome young man. He had been born with good looks, and had been popular with women since childhood.</p>

    <p>And most importantly, Father Wang had a pair of very beautiful phoenix eyes. Since he had taken to wearing glasses after he started writing, this characteristic wasn't so obvious... But this was the reason why Father Wang once suspected that Wang Ling wasn't his flesh and blood.</p>

    <p>Because Mother Wang had very beautiful double eyelids and big eyes! And Father Wang had phoenix eyes...</p>

    <p>But how did the two of them end up having a son with dead fish eyes?</p>

    <p>Later, Father Wang convinced himself...</p>

    <p>His son Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>Must have mutated in the womb...</p>

    <p>Er Ha never imagined that Little Master Ling would actually have this half-clone take on the image of a young Father Wang.</p>

    <p>The game had just become interesting.</p>

    <p>"Who will come up first?" Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch opened his mouth.</p>

    <p>His voice was unexpectedly gentle, and he came across as a humble nobleman.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "What the... this voice! Sounds too nice! Hearing it can make a person pregnant! Woof!"</p>

    <p>Even the voice was very similar to Father Wang's!</p>

    <p>But this was Father Wang's voice as a young man...</p>

    <p>Stripped of the vicissitudes of time, this voice sounded unusually gentle and pleasant!</p>

    <p>But Er Ha quickly realized that this didn't seem to be the main point!</p>

    <p>"Why does this clone have this kind of voice? Woof!" Er Ha was surprised.</p>

    <p>"This half-clone was specially made by Brother Ling and won't vanish. Thus, both its appearance and its voice were changed. Most importantly, this half-clone can think for itself." Lord Diulei said, "Of course, if Brother Ling wants to recall it, he can do so at any time."</p>

    <p>After hearing this, Er Ha and Xiao Yin were both dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>A clone that could think for itself and wouldn't vanish...</p>

    <p>Nuwa herself couldn't create a human being as easily as this!</p>

    <p>It was clear that this was something that only Wang Ling could do...</p>

    <p>It was already amazing enough to be able to mold the clone's face at will, but to preserve it so that it didn't disperse and to give it spiritual intelligence was just like creating new life!</p>

    <p>Not long after this Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch clone representing Wang Ling laid down his challenge in the arena, a figure leapt onto the stage right away.</p>

    <p>This was Sakamoto Shisaburo, sect leader of Leaping Sect. This was a foreigner from Sun Island. However, he loved Huaxiu's culture very much, and so had settled in Huaxiu and established Leaping Sect, starting a business in teaching body movements.</p>

    <p>At that moment, Wang Han announced the rules. "Sect leaders, the rule for this match is that as long as you can touch Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch's body, you win the match."</p>

    <p>"Touch his body? That simple?"</p>

    <p>"The Office of Strategic Deception is a little too conceited... The sect leaders present aren't pushovers!"</p>

    <p>Someone laughed and spoke.</p>

    <p>"It's not that we're looking down on the sect leaders, but that we don't have much time. There is still a lot to do after this."</p>

    <p>Wang Han smiled and added, "Another thing, this isn't a one-on-one match. Sect leaders, as long as you're willing to take up the challenge, you can even work together. Of course, the final prize can only be given to the person who touches Crispy Noodles Dao Monarch first. During the challenge, if you leave the arena, you lose."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, many of the sect leaders present were indignant, and one by one they spontaneously jumped into the arena.</p>

    <p>"I, Steamed Broth Sect, accept this challenge!"</p>

    <p>"I, Sweet Bean Curd Sect, accept this challenge!! "</p>

    <p>"I, Three Days And Two Sects, accept this challenge!"</p>
