  <h1>Chapter 1781 The little dragon man who makes a living by being cute</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In the past, Wang Ling had an unsociable personality and suffered from mild social phobia. He was extremely repelled by the feeling of being crowded together.</p>

    <p>But now he found that his temper seemed to have been softened a little bit.</p>

    <p>At least when facing Chen Chao and Guo Hao. When facing these classmates who he got along with every day and can be called familiar, he no longer has that strange feeling from the bottom of his heart.</p>

    <p>After all, Wang Ling feels that in his heart, he still longs to have a few friends...</p>

    <p>They don't have to be too strong. They don't have to be rich. They just need to be kind-hearted people who live a positive and loving life.</p>

    <p>It seems quite interesting to have this group of people around, even just listening to them having fun.</p>

    <p>After sensing the movement next door, Wang Ling was hesitating whether to say hello.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Muyu took the initiative to stretch out his little hand and held the corner of his clothes: "Brother Ling, do you want to go and see it together?"</p>

    <p>The little guy was obviously encouraging him. And he was smart enough to change his title.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling found that he could not resist Wang Muyu's star eye attack. Finally, he held the little guy's little hand and walked out of the suite.</p>

    <p>"I won't go with Ling Zhenren. Please pay attention to the text message about dinner. I will arrange it for you." Fenlei from Glio City is a very discerning clone. Immediately decided to leave space for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The task he received was to be responsible for the daily life and food of Wang Ling in Glio City during this period, and to assist in the investigation of matters related to the Tengu lair.</p>

    <p>This time Wang Ling will go to meet his classmates. He just has the opportunity to team up with Wang Ying to investigate everything that can be investigated.</p>

    <p>Clone + Shadow. This combination is just right to send out on missions.</p>

    <p>It's like sending a teammate to mine in an RPG game and making stew by yourself. The behavior of the water world chat channel is the same.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>With Sun Rong's wealthy character, he prepared a suite for each of the four people who came to Glio City. The suite was filled with a variety of snacks, desserts, iced drinks and even a self-service miniature gathering. The array is used to assist practice.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling came to Chen Chao's room. At this moment, several people were laughing and chatting in the room. The chat was lively.</p>

    <p>As soon as he arrived at the door, he heard Chen Chao's silver bell-like laughter: "Hahahaha. Tell me, will Boss Sun arrange us in the same hotel as Wang Ling? Maybe. Wang Ling is right next door to us. He might be surrounded by us."</p>

    <p>The first person to fall silent was Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>As one of Wang Ling's biggest fans, he could smell Wang Ling's scent as soon as he entered the hotel.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling, who was standing at the door, obviously fell into silence at this time.</p>

    <p>And, for the 10,086th time, he resisted the urge to kill Chen Chao...</p>

    <p>"Do you think this is a game of Go..."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao shrugged. He couldn't believe it.</p>

    <p>"Anyway, no matter where classmate Wang Ling is, we can't forget our actions this time." Li Youyue said with a mysterious smile.</p>

    <p>Several people were talking in the room. It was obvious that they had already thought of a comprehensive assist plan.</p>

    <p>And we made preparations early on the way to Glio City by immortal boat.</p>

    <p>Just waiting for the plan to be implemented.</p>

    <p>However, it is not easy to ensure that the plan is implemented.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling remembers that every time he goes out with Sun Rong, as long as someone is following him, something will definitely happen.</p>

    <p>This may be the legendary butterfly effect.</p>

    <p>"Bang bang bang!"</p>

    <p>At this moment, there was a polite knock on the door in Chen Chao's apartment.</p>

    <p>But it wasn't Wang Ling who knocked on the door.</p>

    <p>He originally wanted to observe again at the door.</p>

    <p>As a result, the little guy next to him looked like he couldn't wait. After knocking on the door, he quickly used the star eye attack on him. Most of Wang Ling's inner desire to complain was instantly eliminated.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling found that this little guy Wang Muyu seemed to have found a shortcut to deal with him.</p>

    <p>"Who?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Guo Hao took the initiative to stand up and opened the door. He was still wearing the short-sleeved shirt "My Family Has Mines." As soon as he opened the door, he was pleasantly surprised to see Wang Ling and Wang Muyu, one large and one small, neatly dressed. Standing at the door very obediently.</p>

    <p>"I'm going... Chen Chao got it right again! It's really Wang Ling!" Guo Hao looked surprised. He quickly welcomed Wang Ling and Wang Muyu into the door.</p>

    <p>The moment everyone saw the little guy, everyone looked like they were overwhelmed by Wang Muyu's cuteness.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is really rare to see Chen Chao and Guo Hao, two steely straight men, looking at a six-year-old child with his face flushed by cuteness. They look like two idiots.</p>

    <p>In this room, only Fang Xing, a core member of the Office of Strategic Deception, knows Wang Muyu's true identity.</p>

    <p>"Hello, brother. Sisters." Wang Muyu greeted politely.</p>

    <p>With a face that was exactly the same as Wang Ling, he used that completely different personality to cater to Chen Chao and others. It gave everyone at the scene an unreal feeling.</p>

    <p>It is obviously very similar to Wang Ling. But they know that it is indeed a different individual from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Ah. This is what Rongrong is talking about. The younger brother Wang Muyu, the cousin of classmate Wang Ling, right? He's so cute!!" Li Youyue couldn't hold back. She spread her hands to hug Wang Muyu. The little guy wasn't polite either. With a pop, his body went limp and he fell into the arms of the female high school student. He even rubbed his head on Li Youyue's shoulder, making Li Youyue blush for a while.</p>

    <p>This proactive offensive was too foul. Li Youyue collapsed: "I...I'm available!"</p>

    <p>"What?" Chen Chao and Guo Hao were puzzled.</p>

    <p>"Little Muyu! Do you want to consider it?... I can wait for you to grow up..."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao persuaded with sincerity: "Ahem...Classmate Li Youyue. As the only female high school student here, you have to be reserved. Muyu is still young and needs to be taken care of. You will scare the children."</p>

    <p>"Hey, I'm sorry. I actually really want a younger sister or younger brother...but my parents have always said that raising me is already hard enough and they don't want a second child."</p>

    <p>Li Youyue hugged Wang Muyu and sighed: "But now that I see Muyu, I think I can do it again. When I go back, I must persuade my parents to get another one!"</p>

    <p>Everyone in the small room was sighing.</p>

    <p>"Hey. I didn't expect Lingzi's younger brother to be so unrestrained. I even wonder if Muyu is the cousin of classmate Wang Ling... Why does it feel so unreal." Chen Chao laughed.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu is a living little social butterfly. As for being cute and increasing his favorability. Wang Ling feels that no one can resist Wang Muyu's offensive.</p>

    <p>"Okay. Now that everyone has seen Muyu, why don't we go to the hotel restaurant to have something to eat first. Boss Sun encountered something on the boardwalk. She just told me. She said immediately." At this time, Fang Xing suggested.</p>

    <p>He is the only insider here. Naturally, he will try his best to control the situation and avoid letting the topic be brought into dangerous links.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, with Chen Chao's bad mouth, the truth can come out...</p>
