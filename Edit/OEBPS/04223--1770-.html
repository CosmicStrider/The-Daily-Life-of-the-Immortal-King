  <h1>Chapter 1770 The characteristics of the business district in the world of cultivation</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After Sun Yiyuan put down the phone, Butler Lin frowned slightly. He stood very close. Moreover, Sun Yiyuan deliberately turned up the volume during the call so that Butler Lin could listen together.</p>

    <p>After hearing the news of Sun Rong, this seniority than Jiang Xiaoche even older butler can not help but reveal a few worried color: "Master, I think this matter is not good ...... Take the Muyu young master's photo was sold, a variety of signs indicate that are inseparable from Jiang Xiaoche."</p>

    <p>"On the other hand, there is also the new Elder Qin of the Strategic Deception Sect as a witness. Elder Qin had videotaped Jiang Xiaocher's entire dealings in the process of disguising himself as a skunk. In addition, the amount of extra money he earned by relying on intelligence also matched..."</p>

    <p>"I feel that you shouldn't continue to use him like this."</p>

    <p>"Old Lin..."</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan raised his hand and gestured to the height of his desk: "Xiaoche has been by my side since he young. I have never regarded him as an outsider."</p>

    <p>When he said these words, Sun Yiyuan couldn't help but sigh. The disappointment in his heart was self-evident.</p>

    <p>It feels uncomfortable for anyone to be betrayed by someone they trust.</p>

    <p>The information that betrayed the group. And there is a sufficient chain of evidence from many aspects. Jiang Xiaoche cannot escape the connection.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Sun Yiyuan also knew very well the reason why Jiang Xiaoche did that. Maybe it was out of jealousy...</p>

    <p>So he has never been that concerned about Wang Ling's affairs. In addition, Jiang Xiaoche is also very aware of the fact that Sun Rong likes Wang Ling. He considers it from the perspective of a love rival. It's not surprising that some disgusting things happen.</p>

    <p>Although Sun Yiyuan usually doesn't ask questions, in fact, he basically knows everything about his opponents.</p>

    <p>After a long silence, Sun Yiyuan spoke slowly. He said in a deep voice: "Old Lin, Rongrong and I know what you're talking about very well. But I want to make Xiaoche understand that it's impossible between him and Rongrong."</p>

    <p>"My master is so merciful..."</p>

    <p>"This is his last chance."</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan said: "If he still persists in his obsession, I will personally take action and confiscate everything he has now."</p>

    <p>Butler Lin gave a wry smile: "I just don't know. Is the master doing this for the sake of the young lady? Or for the boy named Wang..."</p>

    <p>"This ... naturally for the future consideration of my Huaguo Shuilian Group. I have found someone to predict, student Wang Ling was born with a prosperous wife attribute, if Rongrong can really end up with him, not only will be able to turn misfortune into good fortune, prolong life, in the career is even more soaring, such as God's help ..." Sun Yiyuan said.</p>

    <p>"Is this fortune teller reliable?" Butler Lin had doubts about this.</p>

    <p>"This is very strange. I asked more than a dozen people, and they all said that. Of course, in addition to the above, the fortune tellers have also said things that need to be watched out for."</p>

    <p>"Something that needs to be watched out for? What is it?"</p>

    <p>"They said that if Rongrong and his classmate Wang Ling end up together, will easily have a herniated disc in their waist."</p>

    <p>When Sun Yiyuan said this, he couldn't help but frown deeply: "How could a healthy cultivator have a lumbar disc herniation? What exactly did they do to cause the lumbar disc to jump back and forth repeatedly..."</p>

    <p>Butler Lin: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, after Jiang Xiaoche got the news that Sun Rong wanted to buy an immortal boat ticket to Mixiu Country Glio City, he quickly made preparations for Sun Rong to go abroad.</p>

    <p>This time, he didn't take the initiative to cause any trouble. Because the last time there was such a big commotion over Tengu, it was mainly caused by the first-hand information he sold.</p>

    <p>After coming back, Jiang Xiaoche was frightened for several days. Even his hair began to show a tendency to become decentralized. As a result, Boss Sun didn't seem to notice. There was no obvious change in his attitude towards him. This made Jiang Xiaoche breathed a sigh of relief immediately.</p>

    <p>So this time, Jiang Xiaoche decided that it would be better for him to be more honest and conservative. He must not make any mistakes again.</p>

    <p>It was said that Jiang Xiaoche was asked to book a ticket for the immortal boat. In fact, the Huaguo Shuilian Group has its own exclusive immortal boat. The "booking of tickets" mentioned by Sun Rong was just for Jiang Xiaoche to contact the Mixiu Country Exit and Entry Bureau. It's just a green route specially approved.</p>

    <p>This is the group privilege of Huaguo Shuilian Group as one of the world's top 100 companies. As long as the green route is allowed to open, everyone on the exclusive immortal boat will be deemed to have obtained a short-term visa-free visa for half a month.</p>

    <p>Things may sound complicated, but in fact, Jiang Xiaoche has always been communicating about going abroad. It can be said that they are familiar with each other.</p>

    <p>This time, Jiang Xiaoche swore that he would never do anything that went against professional ethics or betrayed the group.</p>

    <p>However, Sun Rong's trip was leaked to the Tengu team for some unknown reason...</p>

    <p>Mixiu Country Glio Municipality. Wisdom Tree.</p>

    <p>Tengu from all over the world transformed into remote holographic projections and sat down in the office for a meeting.</p>

    <p>It was still the Eight-Star Tengu named "Ba Ye" who appeared before who spoke: "We have received the news. Miss Sun from the Huaguo Shuilian Group is about to go to Glio City."</p>

    <p>"Coming to Glio City?"</p>

    <p>Many Tengu instinctively became alert: "Have they discovered our movements?"</p>

    <p>"Probably not. Our Tengu headquarters is extremely hidden. It's impossible for them to find this place just based on the incident in Duobao City last time. This trip, I'm afraid, is because of the legendary child."</p>

    <p>Ba Ye said: "In short, the two pieces of information we have received so far are very reliable. Because these two pieces of information were all given by Emperor Zun."</p>

    <p>"Emperor..."</p>

    <p>When the rest of the Tengu tribe heard this, they suddenly realized.</p>

    <p>"so it is..."</p>

    <p>"Since it is the information provided by Emperor Zun, it must be correct. Emperor Zun is really amazing. He knows things like a god."</p>

    <p>"But Master Ba. How did you contact Emperor Zun?"</p>

    <p>"How am I qualified to contact Emperor Zun? These are all instructions issued by Emperor Zun proactively."</p>

    <p>Under the mask, the Eight Star Tengu frowned and said, "Actually, I have always thought that we may have more than one emperor."</p>

    <p>"What Master Ba means is that Emperor Zun is the same as us. In fact, it is divided into multiple people?"</p>

    <p>"It's just my personal guess. Emperor Zun knows things like a god. He is elusive. Especially if we can easily guess it?"</p>

    <p>The Tengu named Ba Ye paused and then said: "Last time in Duobao City, we suffered a defeat. This time, Miss Sun from the Huaguo Shuilian Group threw herself into a trap and came to our core hinterland."</p>

    <p>"Listen to my order. All five-stars and above should take action. They must complete the sniper attack on the target in Glio City. Form a close intelligence surveillance network and dig out all the dirty information about this young lady."</p>

    <p>"We must not lose this battle again. Otherwise, it will damage the reputation of our Tengu."</p>

    <p>Under the mask, the eighth master smiled and said: "These days, whether it is the entertainment industry or the business industry, there are always many children. This is a major feature. I hope everyone will seize the opportunity. If I, the Tengu, can succeed in this battle. Maybe we can destroy the Huaguo Shuilian Group and the Office of Strategic Deception in one fell swoop..."</p>
