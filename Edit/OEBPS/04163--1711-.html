  <h1>Chapter 1711 If I don't go to hell, who will?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The Buddha's light was blazing, filling the entire supreme world in an instant.</p>

    <p>Facts have proved that Jingze still underestimated the monk's own fighting power. In the long history, there has never been one person among the sages of Buddhism who can combine the past, present and future three Buddha fires into one body.</p>

    <p>His heart trembled. He no longer dared to be careless. He always maintained a dignified look, full of vigilance.</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng is sitting on the Buddha lotus. Three groups of Buddha fire appear around him and circle around him. The Dharma is solemn and unparalleled.</p>

    <p>At the same time, virtual images of Buddha and Bodhisattva appeared all over the sky behind him. They appeared behind him like a mirage. They all stared at Jingze and Yan in front of them with a casual look.</p>

    <p>"Monk, is this all you can do?" Jingze said. He didn't move, but Jin Deng was surprised.</p>

    <p>He originally thought that except for Wang Ling, Wang Nuan, almost no one in the world could still speak or move under the gaze of countless Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.</p>

    <p>This is already the overwhelming pressure brought by the entire Infinite Buddha Court.</p>

    <p>I didn't expect that the dragonborn in front of me could bear it.</p>

    <p>Briefly surprised, Jin Deng once again began to lecture: "The Eternal Dragon Clan once dominated the world. They are the strongest existence in the universe."</p>

    <p>"Heh. It seems that you are not confused, monk. You know that we are powerful."</p>

    <p>Jingze sneered. He crossed his arms and said, "Yan and I have not inherited 100% of the power of the dragon. Now we have only activated 50% of the power. If it were 100%, I can deal with you alone."</p>

    <p>"Winning or losing the battle is not the key. What the poor monk wants to tell you is, as the successor of the Eternal Dragon Clan, how does it feel to be enslaved by others. Is it comfortable?" the monk said.</p>

    <p>"Being under someone else's roof?"</p>

    <p>Jingze laughed again: "We dragonborn have never felt like we were dependent on others. We just used each other."</p>

    <p>In fact, he and Yan? both have contracts. The current employment relationship with Bai Zhe is indeed based on the Baobai Group.</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe naturally knows this very well.</p>

    <p>Since they are the successors of the Dragons, it's not that easy to completely enslave them, so the best way to do it is to sign a mercenary relationship with the premise of restoring the Dragons, and let the revived Dragons become their own workers before the Dragons are completely restored.</p>

    <p>This was Bai Zhe's original plan.</p>

    <p>As for the resurrected dragon descendants, they have to learn a lot of modern knowledge. To survive in the modern cultivation society, it is inevitable to affiliate with a modern enterprise.</p>

    <p>So in Jingze's view.</p>

    <p>There is no slavery at all here.</p>

    <p>The treatment of all Dragonborn in Baobai is extremely good. There is no overtime, no 996, and there will be no sudden death due to the leader PUA working overtime. Even every resurrected Dragonborn can get a core world of his own as a fiefdom.</p>

    <p>This kind of treatment seems fair to Jingze.</p>

    <p>And what they want to do is just kill a few people in their spare time.</p>

    <p>Dragons are good at fighting. This attribute is engraved in their bones and will naturally not disappear.</p>

    <p>"There are many choices. You don't have to choose this path." Monk Jin Deng sat on the Buddha lotus and spoke sincerely.</p>

    <p>He originally tried to persuade the two lost dragonborn, but found that they had fallen into too deep, and seemed to have regarded Bai Zhe's side as the truth of the universe.</p>

    <p>"Monk, no matter how much you say, I dare to ask, do you have the means to revive our brothers and sisters one by one using only the complete dragon skeleton?"</p>

    <p>"No." The monk shook his head and told the truth.</p>

    <p>Because he really does not have such incredible means. Originally, spells such as resurrection were not a monk's specialty.</p>

    <p>After all, his professional skills are: consecration, helping people reincarnate, and physical salvation.</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Jingze smiled: "You can't. But Mr. Bai can. As far as we Dragonborn are concerned, he is currently the only truth in this vast universe."</p>

    <p>"But there is not only one way to the truth. The people I know also grasp this truth." The monk says, in response to what Jingze has just said. He has already tried his best to hint at the existence of the Wang Ling, but Jingze and Yan seem to have recognized Bai Zhe, and no matter what he says, the two dragons seem unmoved.</p>

    <p>"Someone you know? A monk who brags?" Jingze laughed.</p>

    <p>"Monks don't lie." Jin Deng shook his head and said patiently, "You have been deceived too much."</p>

    <p>"It's not certain who was deceived."</p>

    <p>Everything was as the monk thought. Jingze didn't believe what he said at all: "As you said, monk, there is more than one truth. Killing you is also the truth."</p>

    <p>Negotiation failed.</p>

    <p>Jin Deng sighed secretly.</p>

    <p>Under this situation, there seems to be no room for negotiation.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The next moment, Jingze took action again. He finally took out the black umbrella from behind, held it up, and threw it into the air!</p>

    <p>The black umbrella rotates. It has an unimaginable ability. It buzzes and forms a huge black hole in the sky.</p>

    <p>In just an instant, the entire golden Buddha light in the supreme world was absorbed by the black umbrella in the sky.</p>

    <p>The situation once again surprised Jin Deng. He did not expect that the black umbrella Jingze was carrying on his back was actually a chaos device at sequence level three. And its ability was to absorb the core world for his own use!</p>

    <p>In an instant, he could feel that the vast and boundless Buddhist court was gradually shrinking at a faster pace.</p>

    <p>"Monk, you are one with the Infinite Buddha Court. If the Infinite Buddha Court is swallowed by me, you will definitely die." Jingze said. Originally, he did not want to expose the power of Black Umbrella, but the monk's repeated advice angered him.</p>

    <p>He believes that the truth he chooses will not go wrong. He will not believe that the dragons are at the mercy of others. They are just performing their own work. They are not "slaves" as the monk said.</p>

    <p>The Wuliang Buddhist Courtyard was being eaten away bit by bit. Jingze originally thought that the monk would compete with the three groups of holy Buddha fires he sacrificed. But Jin Deng's next choice was far beyond his expectation.</p>

    <p>Because the monk sitting on the Buddha lotus in front of him actually extinguished these three groups of holy Buddha fires.</p>

    <p>"Monk, what are you doing? You know you are outmatched, so you give up the resistance?" Faced with Jin Deng's choice, Jingze was extremely puzzled.</p>

    <p>He spoke provocatively, trying to irritate Jin Deng. However, the monk remained calm and calm.</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng put his hands together, his tone flat: "Ancient Buddha cut his flesh to feed the eagle, my side of the infinite Buddha court and count for nothing. If the death of the poor monk, can let you two find the real truth, the poor monk dies without regret."</p>

    <p>"Monk, resist me! Resist! I don't want you to lose to me like this! You are humiliating me!" Jingze roared.</p>

    <p>However, once the God-Eating Umbrella was opened, even he could not stop it. Seeing the countless Buddhist temples being gradually eaten away, Jingze felt very uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>He originally wanted a fierce battle to gain experience for himself. But at the end of the battle, Jin Deng actually planned to let him devour him without any resistance. This was a great humiliation for the bellicose dragon clan members. Unprecedented humiliation!</p>

    <p>Before the last moment when the Wuliang Buddhist Courtyard was eaten away by the "God-Eating Umbrella."</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng raised his head and told Jingze the last words: "My lord, Wang Ling, will give you the answer."</p>

    <p>A Buddha named Wang Ling?</p>

    <p>When Jingze heard this, he was stunned for a moment.</p>
