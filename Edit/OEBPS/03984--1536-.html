  <h1>Chapter 1536 Dao Ancestor Wang's Missionâ‘¡</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Zheng looked at Wang Ling from a distance.</p>

    <p>The direction of the other world. The young man was sitting slumped in front of the ruins. He looked very tired.</p>

    <p>As the master, monk Jin Deng chose to stop him and block his way.</p>

    <p>After thinking about it for a while, Zheng felt that his inference was completely reasonable.</p>

    <p>"Zheng. You have been taken advantage of. I would like to advise you. It is better to stop."</p>

    <p>Jin Deng stared at the steel-winged creature in front of him and frowned slightly.</p>

    <p>Because the situation at this time is extremely bad.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, Wang Ling responded quickly. It used King's Eyes to expand the story of the other world. It included most of the universe on the outer layer of the earth and became part of the other world.</p>

    <p>This move is to avoid Zheng's next action, which will destroy the other world and affect the real world.</p>

    <p>The other world grows under the radiation of King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>Width, thickness and strength. All have been improved on the original basis.</p>

    <p>"I do things. I need you to teach me?"</p>

    <p>Zheng's eyes stared at the monk.</p>

    <p>It was a pair of eyes filled with chaos.</p>

    <p>And Zheng. is also a large creature bred from chaos. When it was born, its strength was no less than that of Dao Ancestor Wang's mythical beast.</p>

    <p>--The stupid prairie dog who is still in autistic state and has not been de-petrified.</p>

    <p>"I'm just following the master's orders." Zheng said.</p>

    <p>"You are foolish and loyal." Jin Deng responded.</p>

    <p>They're in space, competing against each other.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling found out. The next moment, Zheng's sharp claws tightly grasped his rune spear. Suddenly, a chaotic aura was released.</p>

    <p>This is an extremely high concentration of chaotic gas.</p>

    <p>It seems to give people the illusion of being in chaos.</p>

    <p>This is a normal fluctuation for an ancestral powerhouse. With the strength of a monk, it can naturally be tolerated. But this is equivalent to changing the surrounding environment. Any human cultivator (except Wang Ling). Even a monk will feel it in the chaotic energy. Discomfort.</p>

    <p>Just like an excellent diver. Even if a monk can withstand the chaos of chaos, there is always a limit.</p>

    <p>It's just that this speed is much higher than that of ordinary cultivators on earth and in the divine realm.</p>

    <p>If it had been anyone else, I'm afraid it would have exploded under such fluctuations.</p>

    <p>"It seems that you are indeed no longer the little monk you were back then."</p>

    <p>As an ancestral realm master, Zheng is surprised by the monk's current growth.</p>

    <p>It would have been ten thousand years ago. Jin Deng would have lost consciousness in less than five seconds under such chaotic energy.</p>

    <p>In fact.</p>

    <p>Whether it's natural talent or moral character, at every level.</p>

    <p>Jin Deng must surpass Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>If we can get the guidance of Dao Ancestor Wang, Monk Jin Deng can save himself a lot of detours.</p>

    <p>What Zheng still can't figure out is.</p>

    <p>In the end, Dao Ancestor Wang chose Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>And ordered him to protect this, the only true disciple.</p>

    <p>This was the task assigned by Dao Ancestor Wang back then. Zheng certainly cannot be violated.</p>

    <p>The same is true even if the grown-up monk Jin Deng stands in front.</p>

    <p>Clang!</p>

    <p>So. The next second, what awaited the monk was the terrifying rune spear lingering in the air of endless chaos.</p>

    <p>Zheng's first long-air strike was just a test. This time it was his full strength.</p>

    <p>The spreading radiant purple chaotic energy was mixed with the runes that were constantly dimming and lighting up. It tore the sky apart. The terror was boundless. It penetrated Jin Deng again.</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng frowned and took out a gold wooden fish.</p>

    <p>Ta!</p>

    <p>He raised his hand and sacrificed the wooden fish.</p>

    <p>This wooden fish rapidly grew in size at a speed visible to the naked eye. Then it burst out with overwhelming divine power, powerful enough to shake a spear.</p>

    <p>"Monk. Is this all you have?"</p>

    <p>Zheng sneered and let out a loud war cry.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, the divine voice filled my ears.</p>

    <p>Endless pressure washed down. Even if it did not reach the location where Wang Ling was, the terrifying sound waves rushed away in all directions instantly.</p>

    <p>A buzz!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw that the four ancient divine weapons suppressed by Jingke's sword talisman actually collapsed on the spot!</p>

    <p>Huge sound waves hit the surface. Jingke's body was unstable and he was actually swept away on the spot.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling responds quickly.</p>

    <p>He stood up lightly, calculated Jingke's position accurately, and held him in his arms like a doll.</p>

    <p>This is a musical technique specifically targeted at ancient divine weapons.</p>

    <p>In order to be responsible for clearing away the ancient divine weapons, Zheng studied many methods.</p>

    <p>And this trick is the most effective.</p>

    <p>These monsters are made of special materials bred in chaos. They are not afraid of physical spells. But they can be crushed with one blow as long as they are exposed to specific sonic frequencies.</p>

    <p>However, such specific sound waves are harmless to living beings other than the ancient divine weapons and will not cause casualties.</p>

    <p>At most, he would just be stunned.</p>

    <p>To be honest. Zheng's trick also inspired Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>It turns out that the ancient magic weapon can still be dealt with like this.</p>

    <p>Eh...</p>

    <p>He learned.</p>

    <p>After this war cry.</p>

    <p>Zheng's first mission. That is, the mission of clearing away the remnants of the ancient divine weapons has been completed.</p>

    <p>All that's left is to rescue Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>His distant war cry was intended to crush the ancient divine weapon and stun Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But what Zheng didn't expect was.</p>

    <p>The ancient divine weapons were destroyed.</p>

    <p>But that boy and the child-like White Hair Sword Spirit were both intact. Not even a single hair was lost.</p>

    <p>"You have a good disciple, monk." Zheng spoke.</p>

    <p>This is a rare compliment.</p>

    <p>In the impression of the monk, Zheng rarely praised others.</p>

    <p>In fact, the battle cry just now was not just Zheng's test of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>It is also Wang Ling's test of Zheng.</p>

    <p>This has shown that the Dharma of this Dao Ancestor Wang is different from the opponents I have encountered before.</p>

    <p>Because Jingke is injured.</p>

    <p>The moment Wang Ling caught it, he had already noticed that Jingke had suffered internal injuries.</p>

    <p>Although it didn't show up, it wasn't very serious.</p>

    <p>But just a battle cry can injure his sword spirit.</p>

    <p>In the memory of Wang Ling. This is indeed the first time.</p>

    <p>"Sword Master. I'm sorry..." Jingke was held in Wang Ling's arms. He felt that Wang Ling was using magic to heal himself. He felt a little ashamed for a moment.</p>

    <p>Although he was injured this time, there was also an element of Jingke underestimating the enemy.</p>

    <p>But in the current situation, he really couldn't find any extra excuses to excuse himself.</p>

    <p>Injured. Just injured.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed helplessly.</p>

    <p>The disposable Talisman in him started to burn again...</p>

    <p>There are more than ninety talismans in total. At this time, more than twenty have been burned.</p>

    <p>He knew that he shouldn't show off his power for a while.</p>

    <p>Should save some disposable Talisman.</p>

    <p>He still has games to come.</p>

    <p>But now, seeing Jingke injured, Wang Ling suddenly felt like his own son had been hammered.</p>

    <p>Somehow.</p>

    <p>He couldn't bear it anymore.</p>

    <p>The next moment. Wang Ling raised his hand.</p>

    <p>Zheng is confused. What on earth is this young man doing by doing this action?</p>

    <p>But soon. He understood instantly!</p>

    <p>Because at the next meeting, there was a huge force pressing on Zheng's back.</p>

    <p>The position of the earth. The young man's palm actually split the chaos. It passed through layers of void. It had the aura of a great avenue that opened up the world!</p>

    <p>Press his back. Slap him towards the earth!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's attack was too sudden.</p>

    <p>The rules of the Dao are immense. It took him a moment to react.</p>

    <p>He stared at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>I can't figure out why a young man has such terrifying powers.</p>

    <p>There wasn't even time to stop it.</p>

    <p>The whole person has already followed the force from outside through the earth's atmosphere and rushed towards the surface of the earth.</p>

    <p>Boom!!</p>

    <p>Like a comet hitting!</p>

    <p>In front of Wang Ling, a huge sinkhole was created...</p>
