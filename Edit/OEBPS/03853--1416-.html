  <h1>Chapter 1416 The new school guard captain</h1>

  <div>

    <p>There is no doubt that with the new version of the Consecration Technique covering Chen Chao's body again, Chen Chao's Consecration Mouth has been strengthened again...</p>

    <p>From now on Wang Ling feels that he should be more wary of Chen Chao. This guy's mouth is too scary. It's hard to overstate how easy it is with his words.</p>

    <p>It is simply a walking poisonous milk.</p>

    <p>However, this only works when Chen Chao says it unconsciously. You cannot judge something with a utilitarian mind. Otherwise, it will become inaccurate.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that Chen Chao was strengthened today. Maybe it will become a foreshadowing in the future...</p>

    <p>Now Number 60 High School has a gathering of big shots. It would be an understatement to call it the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>In fact, there is another thing that is beyond Wang Ling's expectation...</p>

    <p>That is, death Heavenly Dao has actually come to him.</p>

    <p>He is a Death Heavenly Dao, he knows nothing about Heavenly Dao, how dare he sit beside Ling Zhenren and show off his skills.</p>

    <p>But Death Heavenly Dao is very timid.</p>

    <p>It's a bit embarrassing to say.</p>

    <p>Because he is afraid of death. He dare not get too close to Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>This psychological shadow has been left since the last time Wang Ling took Jingke and put the sword on his neck to question him.</p>

    <p>He is a Death Heavenly Dao. Heavenly Dao who knows farts. How dare he sit next to Ling Zhenren and do whatever he wants.</p>

    <p>Just the thought of studying in the same class as Wang Ling. Death Heavenly Dao trembles.</p>

    <p>However, the Heavenly Court gang pushed him out into the 60th. The mission must continue.</p>

    <p>So Heavenly Dao thought of the next best thing.</p>

    <p>The monk finished his morning class and returned to the independent vice-principal's office.</p>

    <p>He feels that his math class is pretty good.</p>

    <p>At first he didn't even understand what a function was. But now it's no longer a problem.</p>

    <p>Although it takes a long time to study...</p>

    <p>Of course. The main time-consuming part is overcoming fear.</p>

    <p>The Wang Ling memory brick put too much mental pressure on him. It took the monk three full days to come back to his senses.</p>

    <p>In fact, to this day, he still has a slight psychological shadow in his heart.</p>

    <p>But there is a saying that "If I don't go to hell, who will go to hell." Monk Jin Deng finally fully displayed his spirit as a monk... In the end, it took another 3 hours to study all the mathematics from college to college. question.</p>

    <p>He dare not say that his learning ability is very strong. At least compared to Wang Ling, it is definitely insufficient.</p>

    <p>Monks should be humble. They must still have many shortcomings.</p>

    <p>He finished studying mathematics in 3 hours. This time was really too long... He needed to reflect.</p>

    <p>Back in the office, the monk put down the lesson plan in his hand and was about to make a cup of tea.</p>

    <p>At this time, there was a knock on the door of the office. A young man wearing overalls walked in: "Hello. I'm here to apply for the security department. I heard that you are still short of a school guard captain..."</p>

    <p>It turns out that the school guard of Number 60 High School is Old Man Li. But Old Man Li is older now. Principal Chen decided to let Old Man Li retire after the new school guard captain is found and the handover of tasks is completed, so that he can enjoy his old age.</p>

    <p>So now, people are coming to apply for positions.</p>

    <p>The monk felt that the young man's breath was a bit familiar. When he turned around, he saw that the person who came was none other than Death. Heavenly Dao said: "Is that you?"</p>

    <p>"It's me..." Death Heavenly Dao's mouth twitched.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the monk fell silent.</p>

    <p>Heavenly Dao holds the door...</p>

    <p>This incident can be said to have witnessed history again!</p>

    <p>Simply unprecedented...</p>

    <p>"Aren't you here to study?" the monk laughed.</p>

    <p>"I don't dare..." Death Heavenly Dao sighed: "I think this position is actually quite suitable for me. If anyone tries to do something wrong, I will take him away directly."</p>

    <p>"..." The monk was silent and replied, "But you should go to the human resources department. This matter is not my responsibility."</p>

    <p>"There are a lot of people applying for jobs now. Can't we go through the back door?" Death Heavenly Dao said.</p>

    <p>Considering that Heavenly Dao also wanted to save face, after Heavenly Dao finished speaking, he closed the door of the office.</p>

    <p>Then with a bang, he suddenly knelt down and hugged the monk's thigh: "Senior Jin Deng! Save the child..."</p>

    <p>"Let go first..."</p>

    <p>The monk sighed: "Actually, I think Ling Zhenren is quite cute. He's not that scary. Besides, you made a great contribution in rescuing Miss Sun. Ling Zhenren will never do anything to you."</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao knelt on the ground with his hands on his thighs: "But I never have the courage."</p>

    <p>"That's alright. You get up first. It's about the captain of the school guard. Let's find a way..." Jin Deng helped Heavenly Dao up.</p>

    <p>Since Wang Ling appeared, the entire Heavenly Dao has become humble...</p>

    <p>Although Heavenly Dao began to become smoother, it seemed to have lost its original momentum.</p>

    <p>The monk doesn't know whether this is a good thing.</p>

    <p>He felt that this was actually caused by Heavenly Dao people not having a good understanding of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Ling Zhenren. How cute!</p>

    <p>When I eat the crispy noodles, my cheeks bulge like a cute little hamster!</p>

    <p>There is nothing to be afraid of.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It's lunch time at Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>Starting from this semester, Number 60 High School's meal placement mechanism will be cancelled. Lunch boxes will no longer be prepared in the cafeteria and delivered to the door of the classroom. All students must walk to the cafeteria to eat. There will no longer be any additional special services for the elite version.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling After hearing that, Principal Chen also planned to improve the school uniforms. Let all Number 60 High School students wear uniforms with the word "fine"...</p>

    <p>Number 60 High School. Everyone is an elite!</p>

    <p>Although there are elite classes, the elite class means the elite among the elite.</p>

    <p>So even if they are students in ordinary classes or hard-working classes, as long as they are students in Number 60 High School, they are also elites!</p>

    <p>Eliminate differential treatment. This is actually a sign of progress.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thinks Principal Chen is a man with great vision.</p>

    <p>As a teacher, you should treat all students equally.</p>

    <p>The meal prepared by Mother Juan at noon today consists of sweet and sour pork, salt and pepper ribs, seaweed and egg soup, steamed okra, and stir-fried vegetables. The nutritional mix is quite balanced.</p>

    <p>In addition, there is a new dish invented by Mother Juan {Black Fungus Stewed with Fat Seafood}.</p>

    <p>Students can choose to taste...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling took the meal and chose a corner seat to sit down.</p>

    <p>There were too many people in the cafeteria. He actually didn't want to come to a crowded place to eat. He planned to just pick up a couple of people for a formality, and then leave directly.</p>

    <p>Then Chen Chao and Guo Hao also came over with plates. They sat down next to Wang Ling comfortably.</p>

    <p>Being able to eat with familiar people finally comforted Wang Ling's mood a little.</p>

    <p>The seat in the corner is for four people. After Guo Hao and Chen Chao took their seats, there was only one seat left.</p>

    <p>"Why didn't Sun Rong come?" Chen Chao asked.</p>

    <p>He put his legs across the empty chair next to him, intending to occupy a seat for Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"She doesn't come here to eat. It's prone to stampede accidents." Guo Hao said, "So classmate Sun Rong's meals are the same as those of the teacher. They are delivered directly to the office."</p>

    <p>"Office?"</p>

    <p>"It's the student union office. She eats there," Guo Hao said.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling. Can I sit here?" At this time, a sweet female voice came.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Chen Chao, Guo Hao raised his head. Surprised, in front of him was a girl who looked somewhat similar to Sun Rong...</p>

    <p>And this girl is not wearing the Number 60 High School uniform. She is wearing casual clothes.</p>

    <p>She wore a casual white off-shoulder short-sleeved upper body and a denim skirt on the lower body. Chen Chao and Guo Hao were shocked on the spot.</p>

    <p>On a scale of 10 points, this leg...is definitely worth 9 points!</p>

    <p>"Please sit down!" Chen Chao quickly moved his legs away.</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>At this time, this strange girl took the initiative to reach out to Wang Ling: "Hello classmate Wang Ling. I am a new transfer from Jian Shen College. I came to the school to register today. I will officially report tomorrow. My name is Jiang Yingying."</p>
