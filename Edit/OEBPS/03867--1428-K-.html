  <h1>Chapter 1428 Poker Sword Lao K</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Sword Conference. With the overwhelming advantage of using the upgraded version of "Sun Rong field" to obtain a comprehensive strategy.</p>

    <p>It seems to be a foregone conclusion who will be the champion.</p>

    <p>In order to protect the girl, those captured sword spirits started a fierce battle with the remaining sword spirits, resulting in heavy losses for both sides.</p>

    <p>In the end, there were less than a dozen sword spirits left in the field.</p>

    <p>The last five sword spirit groups headed by "Lao K." Would rather die than surrender.</p>

    <p>They were all staring angrily at Sun Rong and following the girl. Those sword spirit lickers who had been conquered.</p>

    <p>At this time, Lao K stood at the front wearing a thick golden armor. The beard on his chin was blowing in the wind. He looked like a Saint Seiya.</p>

    <p>Ha! I, Lao K, am not one of those dogs that follow you.</p>

    <p>"Walking dog?"</p>

    <p>"It means dog walker + dog licker!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>This sword spirit named Lao K is surrounded by golden sword energy.</p>

    <p>His nickname is King's Sword. He is the 12th ranked sword spirit. His body is a "Poker CardÂ·K."</p>

    <p>It is said that Dao Ancestor Wang was in seclusion in the Sword King Realm when he was too bored and fought with his clones. Unexpectedly, even the playing cards turned into sword spirits.</p>

    <p>"Lao K. It's a done deal. I think it's better for you to give up. You can't imagine Miss Sun's charm. We have decided. We will strongly recommend Miss Sun to win! If you don't vote, we will launch a collective attack and die together with you!"</p>

    <p>Wu Jin said. He carefully analyzed the situation for Lao K: "Not counting Miss Sun, we have six people left here. One more than you. And Lao Man's "Five Seconds of Real Man" has not been used yet. If The last group fight. You will lose."</p>

    <p>"Heh. That's not necessarily the case."</p>

    <p>Lao K hummed. As a man with the title of King's Sword, of course he cannot surrender so easily.</p>

    <p>Boom! A loud sound!</p>

    <p>He stuck his golden giant sword into the ground. At this moment, three sword auras of completely different colors appeared all over his body, pouring out from this golden giant sword.</p>

    <p>"It turned out to be the sword gambling method..." Wu Jin frowned.</p>

    <p>"What is the sword gambling method?" Although he knew that his question might be inappropriate at this time, Sun Rong still couldn't help but feel curious.</p>

    <p>"Have you seen Miss Sun? The three colors of gold, blue, and red sword energy on this golden giant sword..." Wu Jin explained.</p>

    <p>These three colors of sword energy are the basis of Lao K's "Sword Gambling Technique."</p>

    <p>Golden sword energy. It can make those injured by the sword energy feel as if they have been drugged. They will fall into a state of paralysis and be unable to move.</p>

    <p>Blue sword energy. It can quickly restore the injury of the designated person.</p>

    <p>The red sword energy can produce a highly lethal suicide sword, causing a huge explosion in the entire place.</p>

    <p>Now the group stage of the Champions Group has come to an end. Almost everyone has injuries to varying degrees.</p>

    <p>With a numerical disadvantage, Lao K chose to gamble with swords at this time. Perhaps it was indeed a wise choice.</p>

    <p>When Lao K pulled the giant sword out of the ground again, the three-color sword energy that originally emitted would cause a rampage phenomenon, causing Lao K's golden giant sword to change color.</p>

    <p>At that time, the giant sword will randomly select a sword energy among the three colors of sword energy and convert it into its own power!</p>

    <p>Wu Jin didn't expect that Lao K would work so hard.</p>

    <p>Because this "Sword Gambling Technique" is a secret method that will cost you your cultivation.</p>

    <p>Although it is said to be Lao K's unique skill, few people have seen Lao K actually perform it.</p>

    <p>"You actually thought of gambling with swords..." Wu Jin frowned lightly.</p>

    <p>"Why are you talking so much? Since he wants to gamble, then just let him fail!" Liang Feng said from the side. She wanted to rush out directly to block the release of this move.</p>

    <p>However, Wu Jin stopped him on the spot: "If you don't want to be cursed, just stay still!"</p>

    <p>"Curse?" Liang Feng looked confused.</p>

    <p>"Once the formation of the Gambling Sword Technique is formed, you can only gamble with him. According to legend, the formation of the Gambling Sword Technique contains the curse of Dao Ancestor. If you interfere with the formation, you will definitely be cursed by Dao Ancestor Wang!" Wu Jin said.</p>

    <p>When he said this, Lao K, who was wearing heavy golden armor in front, couldn't help but laugh: "It seems that you know my situation very well... Not bad! What you said is right! There will indeed be interference formations. Something terrible happened!"</p>

    <p>Perhaps it was expected that no sword spirit in the field would dare to choose to cross the line at this time. This "sword gambling" formation was forcibly interrupted. The expression on Lao K's face was particularly excited and confident.</p>

    <p>But for Lao K, there are still variables in this sword gambling method.</p>

    <p>Although the sword spirit will indeed be cursed, if it is a human... In fact, he has not done any corresponding experiments.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Sun Rong became Lao K's only worry after practicing sword gambling.</p>

    <p>Maybe he is afraid that the girl will not understand the rules and will ruin his own affairs.</p>

    <p>At this time, after Lao K calmed down, he turned his attention to the only human girl in the field: "Girl, let me ask you, do you dare to bet with me?"</p>

    <p>"Senior insists on going his own way. Of course I can't stop him. I just hope that senior doesn't hurt himself. Also, gambling itself is wrong." Sun Rong patiently advised. However, she expected that the poker sword in front of her would The sword spirit will never listen to his words.</p>

    <p>"Okay! He is indeed a heroic girl! But I don't have to worry about gambling being harmful to my health!"</p>

    <p>I heard Lao K suddenly laugh: "If I get a red card, no matter what the result is, I will give up this game!"</p>

    <p>In this current situation, when the giant sword is drawn out later, both the golden sword energy and the blue sword energy will be beneficial to their side.</p>

    <p>But if the red sword energy is drawn, then the situation may be irreversible...</p>

    <p>The probability is almost 33%.</p>

    <p>The total probability of Lao K drawing his own sword energy is 66%.</p>

    <p>He felt that he would not carry it like that.</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun, don't be afraid. If he draws the red self-destructing sword energy, he will be finished."</p>

    <p>At this time, Lao Man also said: "When the time comes, I will bless you with the power of the 'Five Seconds of Real Man'. You will be completely immune to this damage."</p>

    <p>"Actually, I can do it myself..."</p>

    <p>"No need to say more, Miss Sun. The purpose of our participation in the competition is to help you successfully win the championship." Lao Man said: "You don't have to worry about other things. I know Miss Aohai is very strong. But you have to give us a chance to perform." one time..."</p>

    <p>Faced with Lao Man's enthusiasm. Sun Rong was really dumbfounding.</p>

    <p>It is estimated that the accumulation of the Sword Gambling Technique is about to be completed.</p>

    <p>Lao K stepped forward and held the hilt of the giant sword with his hand.</p>

    <p>What is the result? Just wait for the moment he pulls it out. Everything will be revealed...</p>

    <p>Then.</p>

    <p>A chirping sound!</p>

    <p>As Lao K pulled out the golden giant sword, a red light like a volcanic eruption instantly surged out from the sword!</p>

    <p>"It's red sword energy!"</p>

    <p>The remaining sword spirits in the field looked at this scene. They all divided their last strength, merged the sword spirits and intertwined them together to build a defensive array!</p>

    <p>However, the explosion of this red suicide sword energy was too fast and violent.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>A huge mushroom cloud rises from the ground!</p>

    <p>The five sword spirits on Lao K's side instantly flew backwards like scarecrows...</p>

    <p>In the field, the heat wave hit my nose.</p>

    <p>Among the judges, Jiu You, Yu Ling, Mo Yu, and Xiao Qian gathered their strength to build an indestructible barrier to protect all the sword spirits in the spectator seats.</p>

    <p>"What's the result?" Yu Ling was curious. She couldn't wait to look through the thick smoke screen on the field.</p>

    <p>Then she saw.</p>

    <p>The seven people here, led by Sun Rong, are in an undamaged state. Lao Man's protection and Aohai's blue sword energy make their side tightly protected.</p>

    <p>Even if a sword spirit was injured, it was repaired by Aohai's gentle sword energy.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, the situation at Lao K seems to be more tragic.</p>

    <p>The giant sword camp was headed by Lao K. Except for Lao K, everyone else was seriously injured.</p>

    <p>At this time, Lao K stood up and looked at Sun Rong: "Now, as agreed, I abstain from this game!"</p>

    <p>At the judging table. Facing Lao K's operation.</p>

    <p>Mo Yu frowned slightly: "Really abstaining? Are the gambling products so good?"</p>

    <p>"Not necessarily."</p>

    <p>Jiu You smiled meaningfully: "This is what he planned."</p>

    <p>"Okay?"</p>

    <p>"He calculated it well. He must have drawn the red suicide sword spirit."</p>

    <p>Jiu You said: "The evidence is that while almost everyone in Lao K's Giant Sword Party was seriously injured, Lao K himself was unscathed. This shows that he has made preparations in advance to prevent self-destruction. In addition, ..."</p>

    <p>Yu Ling followed Jiu You's words and said: "In addition, the entire casino in the Sword King Realm is run by Lao K. So the biggest owner of the Sword Tournament King Group gambling game may be Lao K himself."</p>

    <p>"You mean..." Mo Yu was frightened by Lao K's scheming. Her face turned pale.</p>

    <p>"It means that before the game starts, Lao K may have put all his bets on Miss Sun." Yu Ling said.</p>
