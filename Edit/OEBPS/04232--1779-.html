  <h1>Chapter 1779 Servants from the Origin of the Universe</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After successfully completing the transaction with the Bronze Cat, Haiyao Jushi was randomly reborn in a corner of the earth. He quickly escaped from the earth and headed towards the outer galaxy.</p>

    <p>He calculated that he might be captured at his rebirth point, so he chose this more roundabout method.</p>

    <p>Originally, his action was to split the Office of Strategic Deception and the Huaxiu Alliance. As long as the hundreds of garrison troops on the island were destroyed, it would create the illusion that there was an internal conspiracy within the Office of Strategic Deception. It would be possible to make the other parties suspicious of each other. Create a divisive situation.</p>

    <p>However, what he never expected was that his plan was defeated by the "Blood Lotus Female Butcher." And he also discovered a more important matter than splitting the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>That is, the core members of the Office of Strategic Deception are most likely hidden Eternal Ones!</p>

    <p>After flying in the universe for a long time, a point of light traveled from a long distance and finally transformed into a mysterious man wearing a golden robe in front of Haiyao Jushi's eyes. His face could not be seen clearly.</p>

    <p>His face is a golden whirlpool. It is as deep as the stars in the universe. Looking at it will make people feel lost.</p>

    <p>When traveling from the universe, as soon as he took a step, a terrifying wave came from the deep starry sky nearby. It shook the stars all around the universe. The space in all directions was constantly cracking. There was a complete sense of oppression.</p>

    <p>Haiyao Jushi quickly looked away. He did not dare to look directly at the opponent. He only bowed to the opponent respectfully. Looking at the toes of the visitor, he said: "Lord Holy Lord, I am really unworthy of His Highness the Holy King in this battle..."</p>

    <p>After saying this, he was about to kneel down and kowtow, but was stopped by a force.</p>

    <p>Immediately, a hollow, insubstantial and ethereal voice sounded from the mind of Haiyao Jushi: "Mr. Haiyao Jushi, there is no need to be like this. His Highness the Holy King did not blame you. Besides, this time, you did a good job in this temptation."</p>

    <p>Silently, Haiyao Jushi Demon felt a warm force coming from between his eyebrows. It turned out to be the mysterious man known as the Holy Lord, who stretched out his index finger and tapped his forehead lightly.</p>

    <p>"This is..." Haiyao Jushi couldn't believe it. A brand-new power came out of his body. It was continuously generated. In just a moment, it replaced him with the bronze cat in the land abandoned by the gods. The damaged cultivation level is restored instantly.</p>

    <p>More than that. He felt that he was stronger than before!</p>

    <p>"This power... thank you, Lord Holy King!" He was very excited. He clasped his fists and bowed: "Lord Holy Lord! If I go there again now, I will surely kill the Blood Lotus Girl!"</p>

    <p>"This is a gift from His Majesty the Holy King. You don't have to worry about it or be eager to make meritorious deeds. Everything is within His Majesty's plan."</p>

    <p>The mysterious man said.</p>

    <p>He was standing in front of Haiyao Jushi. It seemed that the power of one person could destroy nine heavens and ten earths.</p>

    <p>Such power seems to represent a force from the origin of the universe...</p>

    <p>However, such a person is just a servant of the Holy King.</p>

    <p>So how strong is the Holy King?</p>

    <p>Haiyao Jushi was surprised. He had always wanted to find an opportunity to see the true face of the Holy King with his own eyes. Unfortunately...he never had this opportunity.</p>

    <p>He had lost three hundred lifetimes of cultivation in the land abandoned by the gods. The other party could restore it to him in the blink of an eye.</p>

    <p>How much strength it has is really unimaginable.</p>

    <p>After a moment of silence, Haiyao Jushi asked: "Then, Lord Holy King, do you have any new arrangements next?"</p>

    <p>"His Royal Highness the Holy King has already thought of a way."</p>

    <p>This holy servant said: "Since these people have become eternal beings and are dormant on the earth, they are naturally bound by the laws of the earth... and the most inseparable thing for the operation of the sect is money."</p>

    <p>"I understand. Everything must be obeyed by His Highness the Holy King..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, on the other side, this scene was watched by Wang Ling and others in the hotel.</p>

    <p>I have to admit that Haiyao Jushi is still a smart person. He expected that he might be tracked, so he randomly chose a rebirth point before taking action.</p>

    <p>However, it is a pity that the other party was blocked by this golden vortex face, who was called the servant of the Holy Lord, halfway through.</p>

    <p>After Wang Ling withdrew his gaze, Wang Ying felt particularly unhappy.</p>

    <p>"What's the origin of this group of people?" Wang Ying frowned.</p>

    <p>He doesn't have Wang Ling's King's Eyes. And even with his combat power, he can't even see through this face blocked by the golden vortex.</p>

    <p>"It's a pity. We almost found the opponent's lair." Glio City Fenlei continued: "But fortunately, we are not completely without gains. At least we know their next move."</p>

    <p>"Judging from the current situation, the biggest manipulator behind Tengu is this Holy King. He is far away in the universe and the Milky Way, but he is controlling things inside the earth."</p>

    <p>"Now they have mentioned money. The next step is that they want to manipulate the Tengu side and try to start a money war with us."</p>

    <p>"But Uncle Diulei has always made money from Heavenly Dao broccoli! Do they still want to boycott broccoli?" Wang Muyu muttered to the side, acting like a young adult.</p>

    <p>"Silly boy. If you want to cause a huge blow to assets in the short term, I'm afraid it's not enough to target special industries." Glio City Fenlei touched Wang Muyu's little head: "My main concern now is that they will do something about the spiritual stone."</p>

    <p>As the main raw material for the production of immortal gold, spiritual stone resources have always been the focus of competition between major cultivators.</p>

    <p>Of course. As one of the largest natural resources on earth, every country has a certain reserve of natural spiritual stones. In fact, in order to promote environmental protection, the raw material spiritual stones used by major cultivation countries to produce immortal gold are all artificially developed.</p>

    <p>The method of development is also very simple. As long as spiritual power is injected into a specific machine, artificial spiritual stones can be generated.</p>

    <p>Of course. To generate a one-kilogram artificial spiritual stone, at least 1,000 cultivators of Golden Core or above need to continuously inject spiritual power for one hour. After repeated purification, it can reach such a standard.</p>

    <p>If the Tengu achieves the purpose of monopolizing spiritual stones by acquiring external spiritual stones, then the cost of external production of immortal gold will increase, and the value will be even lower than before... As one of the main currencies for transactions in the cultivation world Once the value of immortal gold decreases, it means that many sects that have been established based on the accumulation of immortal gold will be under great threat.</p>

    <p>And the Office of Strategic Deception, would be affected.</p>

    <p>"Of course. Ling Zhenren, Master of Shadows. The above are just my personal guesses. How it works is not yet known. I just think that we should take precautions as soon as possible."</p>

    <p>"It is not easy to be prepared. Although it is not easy to produce artificial spiritual stones, it is mainly because it is difficult for cultivators to inject spiritual power into large-scale production." Wang Ying smiled and said, "But if there is a humanoid money printing machine, it will be different."</p>

    <p>"Master of Shadows, you mean..."</p>

    <p>At this time, several people present focused their attention on Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying: "Let your master make artificial spirit stones, and we will produce as many as they buy. You will see whether they lose or we lose."</p>
