  <h1>Chapter 1632 Young people don't respect martial ethics</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Now, all parties are setting off in multiple directions. They are encircling, building momentum, and collecting evidence. In fact, there are many groups of "enthusiastic citizens" like Zhang Zhui and Li Xian.</p>

    <p>They are not for fame, but for "the light of the right path." They are just for the contribution of the light and heat in their hearts.</p>

    <p>Of course. Most of them are Gray Cult believers. Their leader has been kidnapped!</p>

    <p>Is there any reason not to save him?</p>

    <p>Of course, most of the Gray Cult believers are actually students at school and do not have the ability to prevent the rescue. However, it is still possible to prevent large-scale public opinion attacks on the Internet.</p>

    <p>For a time, a lot of dirty information about Liu Renfeng was leaked on the Internet.</p>

    <p>There have been many rumors about Mrs. Fengchu on the internet. But in the internet environment, many things are half-true and half-false. No one really believes them. But sometimes, if the public opinion is focused for a while, it seems to be true. It seems that whatever is true or false can become real.</p>

    <p>The attribute tag on the passersby is "old wallflower." Seven out of ten people say it's true. And no matter what the truth is. They believe what they believe.</p>

    <p>This is why in the current network environment, for some unconfirmed gossip...</p>

    <p>You will find that the people who scolded you at the beginning are the same people as the people who apologized later.</p>

    <p>People who apologize are pretty good. But more people choose to remain silent after things turn around.</p>

    <p>The Internet is like a mask. When the true face is covered by the mask, all hideous and ugly expressions will be airtightly blocked by this mask.</p>

    <p>It stands to reason that the Internet public opinion has caused such a big stir this time. As long as Liu Renfeng is a little more thoughtful, he might be able to realize that he has captured the wrong person.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, Mrs. Fengchu was still too anxious. She firmly believed that the person she captured was Jiang Yingying himself.</p>

    <p>Without stopping, he led Sun Rong, Sun Ying'er and the intelligence department chief into the restricted area laboratory.</p>

    <p>This is a secret experimental space specially opened by Liu Renfeng. Only she has the highest authority.</p>

    <p>As soon as Hang Chuan, the head of the Intelligence Section, entered here, he found that his headset signal was blocked.</p>

    <p>He doesn't know. The intelligence department within the laboratory is now in chaos...</p>

    <p>In the absence of Hang Chuan, the intelligence department was leaderless. They and their group could not directly break into the forbidden laboratory and tell Liu Renfeng the truth.</p>

    <p>"It's said online that we captured the wrong person?"</p>

    <p>"Caught the wrong person? No way...Zhang San has never made a mistake. Then how come Jiang Yingying and Sun Rong can't tell the difference."</p>

    <p>"Look at the news on the Internet. I don't think it is fake news at all."</p>

    <p>"Ah... we must tell Madam quickly! Where is Madam now!"</p>

    <p>"The forbidden laboratory! Madam has entered the forbidden laboratory!"</p>

    <p>"Ugh! It's over..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the forbidden laboratory. Liu Renfeng pointed to a bed in front.</p>

    <p>"Come on. Lie down, Jiang." The expression on this crazy woman's face was calm and unperturbed: "I suggest you behave yourself better. I'm always quick. And I have enough anesthetic. I'll make sure you leave this world without any pain."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er never expected that one day she would be lying on the operating table.</p>

    <p>"The blade of your scalpel is not sharp. What if it doesn't open?" Sun Ying'er sighed. She was surprisingly cooperative. She lay down directly without any unnecessary struggle or resistance.</p>

    <p>Being so obedient and well-behaved made Liu Renfeng suddenly feel a little surprised: "I thought you would struggle. I didn't expect you to be so cooperative. You are a good and obedient child. My hard work to rescue you was not in vain."</p>

    <p>"Well. You don't have to say such nice things. You killed so many innocent people in order to develop the artificial root. You just happened to get lucky with what's inside my body. Do you really think you have any technical skill? " Sun Ying'er responded with an amused expression.</p>

    <p>"Luck. It's also part of strength."</p>

    <p>At this moment, Liu Renfeng opened the mechanism in the forbidden laboratory and took out a surgical knife with a faint blue light: "Tell me. Do you have any unfulfilled wishes? As long as I can make it happen, that's all. Done for you."</p>

    <p>"Can I really mention it?" Sun Ying'er's face gradually became excited.</p>

    <p>"Okay." Liu Renfeng nodded and smiled: "If I open the secret realm and empty out the materials in the infinite secret realm, I will become the richest man on earth from now on. As long as I have money, there is nothing I can't do."</p>

    <p>"Then you help me...kill someone?" Sun Ying'er said.</p>

    <p>This request made Mrs. Fengchu suddenly stunned.</p>

    <p>She didn't realize that's what "Jiang Yingying" wanted.</p>

    <p>But such a simple and clear wish was exactly what she wanted.</p>

    <p>She Fengchu has killed countless people. It is too easy for her to kill one person.</p>

    <p>What's more, Jiang Yingying is just a sixteen-year-old girl. What kind of big shots can a sixteen-year-old high school student know?</p>

    <p>"You don't want me to kill your grandfather, do you? Martial Saint Jiang?"</p>

    <p>Liu Renfeng held the scalpel and suddenly smiled sinisterly: "It's not impossible. Although it is difficult, I can still do it."</p>

    <p>"No, no, no. Why should I kill my grandfather? The person I want to kill is someone who once bullied me!" Sun Ying'er said.</p>

    <p>"Oh? Not Martial Saint Jiang? That's a pity. But since it is your wish, I will definitely do it for you. It can be regarded as fulfilling the fate between you and me."</p>

    <p>Liu Renfeng blinked. The expression on his face was very terrifying: "Tell me. What is that person's name? Where does he live."</p>

    <p>"His name is Wang Ying! The king of bastards! The shadow of shadow! He lives in a villa on Donghuang Road!" Sun Ying'er casually revealed the address of the Wang family's small villa.</p>

    <p>"Understood." Liu Renfeng nodded and smiled: "After I take out your spiritual root, I will take out your brain tissue and keep it."</p>

    <p>"Why do we need to remove the brain tissue?"</p>

    <p>"Of course. Wait until I bring him to you...don't you want to witness his death with your own eyes? As long as I connect your brain tissue to the visual sensor, you can see it with your own eyes. By then, he will be like a dying bird. I will kneel in front of you like a dead dog and beg for mercy..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong, Sun Ying'er: "..."</p>

    <p>At this moment, Liu Renfeng laughed eerily: "The scene at that time must have been very exciting."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong, Sun Ying'er: "..."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er couldn't help but shudder when he heard this.</p>

    <p>As expected, the madwoman in front of me is a serious pervert...</p>

    <p>Maybe when Liu Renfeng said this.</p>

    <p>She didn't realize that the danger had come...</p>

    <p>To be honest, Wang Ying really didn't want to come.</p>

    <p>He was lying on Wang Ling's bed, with his eyes closed. He had been peeping at what was going on here.</p>

    <p>I wanted to see Sun Ying'er's embarrassment of being "at the mercy of others."</p>

    <p>But I didn't expect to hear Liu Renfeng's arrogant remarks.</p>

    <p>Originally, when he considered that so many people had taken action, he stopped taking action out of considerations of checks and balances.</p>

    <p>Young people still need to practice martial ethics.</p>

    <p>But now. He regrets it.</p>

    <p>Liu Renfeng!</p>

    <p>Must die!</p>

    <p>Young man, talk about martial ethics!</p>

    <p>Just when Liu Renfeng was about to cut with the knife, a hand suddenly pressed on the shoulder of Mrs. Fengchu.</p>

    <p>From Sun Ying'er's perspective.</p>

    <p>She couldn't see the young man standing behind Liu Renfeng at the moment. His face was filled with murderous intent.</p>

    <p>But that hand. She recognized it at a glance.</p>

    <p>It's Wang Ying's, right...</p>
