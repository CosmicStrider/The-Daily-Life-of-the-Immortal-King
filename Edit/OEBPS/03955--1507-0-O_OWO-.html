  <h1>Chapter 1507 Wang Houlang's 0-Layer Cake</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Akano Jisaki didn't expect that his always cold and calm aunt would have such a big reaction to the name "Wang Houlang."</p>

    <p>He didn't know if it's an illusion.</p>

    <p>He even felt a bit of fear and uneasiness in his aunt's tone.</p>

    <p>Probably not...</p>

    <p>These are just students from Number 60 High School in Huaxiu.</p>

    <p>A very weak rookie in the Foundation Building period.</p>

    <p>How could my aunt be afraid of these Foundation Building people?</p>

    <p>The name "Akino" is very powerful on Sun Island. And the "Zhai Xing Group" controlled by the Akano family is even more powerful and a feared force on the island.</p>

    <p>So Akano Jisaki felt that he might have thought too much.</p>

    <p>His aunt is so awesome. There is no need to be afraid. If you want to be afraid, others should be afraid of his aunt.</p>

    <p>There was silence for a moment. Akano Jisaki heard Jiugong Xinghui's words.</p>

    <p>"These people. You have to treat them well." Jiugong Xinghui said.</p>

    <p>"Yes, Auntie. It's the same old story. Sinkhole, right?"</p>

    <p>"Sink what hole? It means literally." Jiugong Xinghui explained.</p>

    <p>"Huh? Do you really want me to treat them well?" Jisaki was a little upset.</p>

    <p>The way things are now. Anything that goes wrong will alert the other side.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xinghui knew the temperament of Jisaki. The relationship between Jisaki and Ms. Sun back then.</p>

    <p>There's a grudge.</p>

    <p>There's a good chance he'll do something stupid on impulse.</p>

    <p>That kind of behavior is like spooking a snake.</p>

    <p>And it's not positive yet. If this Wang Houlang is the ghost called "Houlang."</p>

    <p>Therefore, Jiugong Xinghui intends to find an opportunity to visit them in person.</p>

    <p>A person. Or a ghost.</p>

    <p>The smell is completely different.</p>

    <p>She has a hair demon inside her body. She can easily tell the difference between humans and ghosts.</p>

    <p>"I know the grudge between you and that Miss Sun. But now they are still guests of our Jiugong family. My foundation in the Jiugong family is not yet solid. If you take action, won't you make it difficult for me as an aunt?"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xinghui explained earnestly: "Listen to my aunt and you won't suffer. Sometimes what you see is only the second floor. And you only think of me as the first floor. But in fact I am on the fifth floor."</p>

    <p>When you hear this, it sounds like an old Thousand Layer Cake.</p>

    <p>Akano Jisaki was stunned immediately. He quickly scratched his golden hair stupidly and said, "My aunt is well-informed. You are right! Don't worry, aunt. I won't act rashly."</p>

    <p>"very good."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xinghui nodded with satisfaction: "My aunt will reward you when you come back."</p>

    <p>"Ah! Is that the reward..."</p>

    <p>"You really miss Ah Zhen, right?" Jiugong Xinghui said calmly, "Don't worry. I'll let her crawl out of the TV to find you tonight."</p>

    <p>"Really! Aunt!"</p>

    <p>"It's true. And... you can do whatever you want."</p>

    <p>The call was interrupted. Jiugong Xinghui frowned.</p>

    <p>She is using a good "hair growth potion" to drip on the bald spot above her head.</p>

    <p>This expensive hair growth potion is sold in "drops." One drop costs 100,000 yuan. It is of the type that has immediate effects. It can cause hair to grow instantly.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xinghui made a large bottle, wrapped it in a black envelope, and poured dozens of drops in a row.</p>

    <p>The bald patch was still empty. Not a single hair on it.</p>

    <p>Serious injury effect?</p>

    <p>It was only at this time that she discovered that the bald part of her body could no longer grow back.</p>

    <p>Pulling out hair can cause severe injuries...</p>

    <p>Simply outrageous.</p>

    <p>"It seems that recovery is impossible."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xinghui sighed. She tied her hair up again, making a nice bun, and then fixed it with a few beautiful hostas.</p>

    <p>This is currently the only way to naturally block the bald spots on the top of your head without looking too fake.</p>

    <p>After all, if you wear a wig, there is actually a risk of it blowing off in the wind.</p>

    <p>In order to prevent the ghost named "Houlang" from attacking again, Jiugong Xinghui has moved all the smooth objects with mirror refraction effects out of the room.</p>

    <p>Mirrors, various cosmetic bottles, glass lamps, etc. Wait a minute!</p>

    <p>"Do you think that Wang Houlang is related to the ghost named Houlang?"</p>

    <p>At this time, the voice of the devil came from Jiugong Xinghui's mind.</p>

    <p>"It's just my sixth sense right now."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xinghui frowned and said: "I actually don't believe it. There can be such coincidences in the world. It's just whether it is true or not. Just take a look and you will know..."</p>

    <p>"If he is a ghost, I can tell it at a glance." The demon said confidently.</p>

    <p>"Just to be on the safe side, just take a look from a distance."</p>

    <p>At this moment, Jiugong Xinghui's eyes dimmed.</p>

    <p>A woman's sixth sense has always been a very scary thing.</p>

    <p>She hoped it was just a coincidence.</p>

    <p>If that Wang Houlang is a ghost, it would be too scary.</p>

    <p>"Why don't you find someone to test it first?"</p>

    <p>"Are you talking about the girl in Jiudaohe?"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xinghui thought for a moment and nodded: "That's fine."</p>

    <p>The girl that One Person and One Ghost talks about is actually an extremely autistic girl who suffered from school violence. She is not a complete ghost.</p>

    <p>But in the eyes of the demon spirit, this girl is extremely talented.</p>

    <p>It has the potential to develop into a top-notch ghost in the future...</p>

    <p>The name Wang Houlang was obviously changed later. Jiugong Xinghui judged that this should be Yingxian Heming's idea.</p>

    <p>The xenophobia in Jiudaohe is very serious. Change the name. Give me a slightly more localized title. Maybe it will be easier to integrate into study life quickly.</p>

    <p>No matter what the background of the other side is.</p>

    <p>Regardless of whether the other side plans to live in the internal mansion arranged by the Jiugong family.</p>

    <p>It is also the student dormitory inside Jiudaohe High School.</p>

    <p>As long as they come to this Sun Island, Jiugong Xinghui thinks that this group of people is like pieces of meat sandwiched in a thousand-layer cake...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong is also good.</p>

    <p>Wang Houlang...</p>

    <p>No matter which floor you are on, you can't escape.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Number 60 High School and others are distinguished guests from afar. Originally, according to Jiudaohe's regulations, a warm welcome ceremony would be held specially.</p>

    <p>This welcome ceremony was organized by Jiudaohe's Student Union.</p>

    <p>Akano Jisaki originally planned to take advantage of this welcome ceremony to meet Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>But what Jisaki never expected was that Miss Sun, who always likes to stand out and attract attention, actually took the initiative to ask the upper leadership of Jiudaohe High School to simplify all ceremonies.</p>

    <p>He felt that Sun Rong seemed to have changed a bit.</p>

    <p>He didn't know why I started to become more low-key.</p>

    <p>In fact, this is entirely a choice made from the perspective of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>A new school, a new environment, and all kinds of new classmates...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong finds Wang Ling difficult to accept for a while.</p>

    <p>On the way to Jiudaohe High School, the car was silent.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming and Sun Rong are communicating via text messages.</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect Miss Rong to choose to do this." Wang Ming sent a message.</p>

    <p>"If we keep it simple, it may make classmate Wang Ling feel more comfortable. As for me, it doesn't matter. And recently, I discovered that being low-key also has the benefits of being low-key." Sun Rong replied with a smile.</p>

    <p>And...</p>

    <p>She discovered.</p>

    <p>I seem to like Wang Ling more than I imagined...</p>
