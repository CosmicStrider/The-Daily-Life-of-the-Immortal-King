  <h1>Chapter 1736 Teamfight</h1>

  <div>

    <p>With the help of Wang Muyu, Sun Rong and Wang Ming drove straight in without any hindrance. Directly into the core center of this heaven-level laboratory.</p>

    <p>A huge experimental instrument came into Wang Ming's sight. There were countless slots for spiritual pieces on it. Like a brain, it was connected to countless crystal conduits and branched out in all directions.</p>

    <p>"It's really the core." Wang Ming looked surprised.</p>

    <p>"How to copy data?"</p>

    <p>"Just use your brain." As he said, Wang Ming folded his little finger and pulled out a wire used to connect the data.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was stunned: "As expected of Brother Ming. Is this modified..."</p>

    <p>"Hehe. It's just a normal operation. Originally, the universal reading device was in the index finger. After I met sister Yinzi, it became inconvenient for me to do things, so I moved it to the little finger."</p>

    <p>"?"</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. Sun Rong feels that this statement sounds a bit meaningful.</p>

    <p>After connecting to the universal reading device, Wang Ming's brain worked rapidly. He felt that countless data were absorbed by him and stored in his brain.</p>

    <p>Under normal circumstances, the influx of such a huge amount of data would overload Wang Ming's brain and enter overheating mode. But now Wang Ming no longer has such troubles.</p>

    <p>The entire reading time is not too long. It only took Wang Ming less than a minute to collect all the data of an entire sky-level laboratory.</p>

    <p>The reading device had just been pulled out. He didn't forget to say thank you to Wang Muyu who was stuck on Sun Rong: "Thank you, little dragon man."</p>

    <p>"Uncle Ming. Take me to see...Daddy!"</p>

    <p>This little guy was actually a little shy. He buried his head in Sun Rong's shoulder as he spoke.</p>

    <p>"Tsk. This little guy is so embarrassed." Wang Ming couldn't help but smile.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling He... was like this when he was a child?" Sun Rong couldn't help but be a little curious.</p>

    <p>"Not at all..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming shook his head: "He has been incapable of emotion since he was a child. This character should be his original character. He is a very interesting little guy."</p>

    <p>"eh...but..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong frowned. She stopped talking.</p>

    <p>To be honest, Wang Muyu's sudden appearance made her feel hesitant and at a loss.</p>

    <p>"Let's make peace with it now. It's better for the little guy to be in our hands than to fall into the hands of that guy Bai Zhe."</p>

    <p>This could not be said to Wang Muyu. So Wang Ming sent a message to Sun Rong through brainwaves and said: "Judging from the current situation, Bai Zhe is studying the Omnipotent Dragon. Essentially, he plans to let this Omnipotent Dragon do it for him." The experiment failed so many times. The only successful one was intercepted by us. So the situation we encounter next is very likely to be..."</p>

    <p>"He will send people over to kidnap?" Sun Rong reacted quickly.</p>

    <p>"Yes. Someone will definitely be sent to snatch him." Wang Ming nodded: "So we must not let this little guy fall into the hands of that kind of person. The little guy is very capable, but his temper looks very simple. As long as he is guided correctly, there will not be big problems."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming analyzed it very seriously.</p>

    <p>He also had the same concerns and worries as Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>The main reason is that I don't know how to explain this to Wang Ling when I actually go out later. And I am very curious about Wang Ling's reaction when he sees this child...</p>

    <p>After all, this feeling of suddenly becoming a father is definitely more of a shock to normal people than a surprise.</p>

    <p>Although the Wang Muyu in front of me and Wang Ling actually have no genetic relationship at all. It was only the deep memory of Sun Rong that was read by Five Senses Creation that led to the current result.</p>

    <p>But the problem is...</p>

    <p>They really look alike!</p>

    <p>It's simply a perfect replica!</p>

    <p>Even the dead fish eyes and eye color are the same!</p>

    <p>When Wang Ming watched it, there would be a series of dramas in his mind. He couldn't help but think about the way he faced Wang Ling when he was six years old...</p>

    <p>He always loved to bully Wang Ling when he was a child.</p>

    <p>He was preparing to take Wang Muyu away.</p>

    <p>At this time, there was an earthquake in the sky-level laboratory. The ground of the entire laboratory began to shake. Wang Ming frowned. He felt bad: "Someone is coming! And they are powerful. They have invaded here directly!"</p>

    <p>In the Tian-level laboratory, several secret transmission channels have been opened.</p>

    <p>Due to the fact that the outside of the laboratory is sealed by Jingbai's sword energy, it is impossible to enter directly. We can only use spatial positioning to achieve precise invasion.</p>

    <p>At the same moment, countless black marked points appeared on the map in Wang Ming's mind. In the black holes that suddenly appeared, creatures with powerful auras invaded the heaven-level laboratory.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu seemed to sense it too, showing a hostile look in his eyes.</p>

    <p>Winding paths and leaping steps?</p>

    <p>He also has this kind of spatial ability.</p>

    <p>So he had a sense of who the divine visitor was.</p>

    <p>If his judgment was correct, the person coming should be a dragonborn with the power of a space dragon.</p>

    <p>Accompanied by a purple aura of disillusionment, a graceful long-haired woman wearing a black cheongsam and red high heels appeared in front of them all.</p>

    <p>SCB-l007: Ling Yue...</p>

    <p>Wang Ming learned the specific information about this person from the data he just learned.</p>

    <p>Obviously, Ling Yue was the leader in this operation.</p>

    <p>The remaining intruders also have the aura of dragon power of the space dragon. These people should be the substitutes separated by Ling Yue using the space differentiation spell. It is equivalent to transferring oneself from other spaces for combat deployment. This is also the ability possessed by space dragons.</p>

    <p>Therefore. She is not alone.</p>

    <p>It's an army.</p>

    <p>"Little guy, I finally found you..." Ling Yue showed up and showed her graceful posture. She gently licked her lips, feeling an indescribable enchantment: "I didn't realize that you're not bad looking, little man. Come to Big Sister, I can take you to your father."</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu frowned and thought for a moment. Then he looked at Sun Rong and asked, "Mom! Mom! Why is this older aunt saying she's a sister?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong, Wang Ming: "..."</p>

    <p>Older...</p>

    <p>Aunt...</p>

    <p>Hearing these words, the veins on Ling Yue's forehead twitched violently. She felt like her heart was suddenly hit hard. Tens of millions of grass and mud horses galloped past.</p>

    <p>"You brat! Am I that old?" she tried to argue to Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>However, as a little dragon-man, Wang Muyu is honest, so how can he have any bad intentions?</p>

    <p>I saw the little guy sticking out his little tongue. After saying an extremely cute "slightly", he also pulled his eyelids at Ling Yue and made a face: "Big milk jugs! They're sagging, and yet you say you're, not an old aunt ...... Look at her, mom, this is what a teenage girl should look like!"</p>

    <p>"Muyu... This is so rude. Children can't say that..." Although it was said that children's words were not taboo, Sun Rong's face flushed as she listened, and she painstakingly instructed as if she was teaching her own child.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Ling Yue couldn't bear it anymore.</p>

    <p>No woman can accept the fact that she is called an aunt.</p>

    <p>This is an open provocation. She will not tolerate it!</p>

    <p>"You brat...and you!" Ling Yue stared at Sun Rong fiercely. There was a fierce light in her eyes. The next moment, her body flashed and she disappeared instantly.</p>

    <p>This is a method of space jumping. And it is extremely fast. It suddenly appeared behind Sun Rong. It was aimed at the back of Sun Rong's head. The thin legs wearing red high heels were whipped like whips.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong does not dodge or avoid. She is protected by Aohai's sword energy. There is no need to worry about this at all.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Muyu's reaction was very fast. The little guy shouted: "Mom, be careful!"</p>

    <p>Then, Wang Muyu twisted his body and stretched out his two small arms. He aimed at Ling Yue's drawn leg and fired with his bare hands. Using his own two arms, he hit Ling Yue's leg hard...</p>

    <p>Ling Yue was shocked, she didn't expect Wang Muyu's strength to be so huge, her legs were clamped on the spot and she couldn't move a bit...</p>
