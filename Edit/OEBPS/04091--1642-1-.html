  <h1>Chapter 1642 A sad story</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When he received the text message from Jiugong Liangzi, Jin Deng knew exactly what happened just by counting.</p>

    <p>If Jiugong Liangzi had come to him before, he would have shied away.</p>

    <p>But now the situation is different.</p>

    <p>The monk greatly admires Wang Ling. In order to get closer to Wang Ling, he became the vice principal of Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>In order to know more about Wang Ling, the relationship between him and Zhuo Yi is also very good. And now Jiugong Liangzi is the person around Zhuo Yi. With this relationship, of course he has to accept this request. Agree.</p>

    <p>In fact, Jin Deng had noticed the matter of "Virtual Realm." a long time ago.</p>

    <p>He could probably guess who the master of the fantasy world was.</p>

    <p>And so far, the Virtual Realm is relatively peaceful. No major events have occurred. The monk naturally doesn't bother to care.</p>

    <p>He has lived in seclusion on earth for a long time. If it weren't for Wang Ling, knowing that he still has a long way to practice, he might still be living a quiet meditation life in seclusion until now.</p>

    <p>Long-term immersive retreat naturally brings about boundless loneliness.</p>

    <p>Not everyone can be like a monk. He can knock wooden fish repeatedly in one place for thousands of years.</p>

    <p>For example, in this Virtual Realm...</p>

    <p>"Old man. You finally couldn't help yourself." Jin Deng's face was calm. No waves in the well.</p>

    <p>The last time he quietly entered the Virtual Realm was hundreds of years ago. But now, the technological city built of gears, lights and advanced cosmic alloys has probably reached a certain scale.</p>

    <p>I just don't know how long the city inside the Virtual Realm can last after they all go inside...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. When Lord Diulei received the message from the monk, he was inspecting the ruined private laboratory in Shou Chong with Er Ha.</p>

    <p>Information obtained based on relevant information in the Liu Renfeng laboratory.</p>

    <p>They got the news that Shou Chong was the junior brother of Liu Renfeng. So they rushed here without stopping.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, this internet celebrity scientist has already run away.</p>

    <p>The entire underground laboratory was cleaned up.</p>

    <p>He didn't take away any mechanical equipment. Instead, he directly blew them into ashes.</p>

    <p>When the disciples from the Office of Strategic Deception who were responsible for the capture arrived here, the scene in front of them was already this mess.</p>

    <p>"Everyone is searching with all our strength! Don't miss every corner! Every ashes left in every place must be carefully screened!" said an outer disciple of the Office of Strategic Deception wearing a white Taoist robe and carrying a big sword on his back.</p>

    <p>"Yes!" replied the rest of the people.</p>

    <p>This group of disciples from the Office of Strategic Deception are in extremely high spirits. Although they are still outer disciples of the Office of Strategic Deception, outer disciples also have monthly assessments and are divided into three, six, and nine grades.</p>

    <p>The disciple carrying the big sword is called Keludi. There are nine copper coins embroidered on his Taoist robe, which proves that he is actually a ninth-level outer disciple of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>According to the sect's regulations, as long as the outer sect disciples can possess ten copper coins embroidered seals, they are eligible to participate in the inner sect's evaluation.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if it's because Lord Diulei was present in person.</p>

    <p>This Great Sword disciple also wanted to show off the spirit of the outer disciples, so he shouted again: "You can't hear me! Make it louder!"</p>

    <p>"Yes!" The other outer disciples answered one after another!</p>

    <p>"No! No energy at all!"</p>

    <p>"But I'm already very loud..." One disciple retorted in a low voice.</p>

    <p>"In our Office of Strategic Deception. If the ninth-level disciples say they can't hear it, they can't hear it!"</p>

    <p>The disciple of the Great Sword said: "I emphasize it again! Search every inch of the corner carefully! Do you understand?"</p>

    <p>"clear!!!"</p>

    <p>"Very good! Very energetic!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Master, the equipment in the laboratory has been blown up. No relevant data can be found. The only clue so far is that the material structure on the wall plaster is very similar to the structure of the artificial human. In addition, no relevant information about Shou Chong has been found. Genetic evidence." A sect disciple reported.</p>

    <p>"The structure of an artificial human." Lord Diulei thought for a moment and snapped his fingers.</p>

    <p>If he guessed correctly. Liu Renfeng should have sent a team of androids to find Shou Chong before.</p>

    <p>And it is very likely that Shou Chong was coerced. Judging from the time point, the explosion in the laboratory happened exactly after Liu Renfeng was captured.</p>

    <p>This is actually a perfect escape opportunity for Shou Chong.</p>

    <p>But there is one thing. Lord Diulei still doesn't understand.</p>

    <p>Shou Chong and Liu Renfeng are master and disciple. Since they're feuding, there's no way they can work together. It's not possible for the two to cooperate with each other.</p>

    <p>The capture of Liu Renfeng should also be a happy thing for Shou Chong.</p>

    <p>He had absolutely no reason to run away.</p>

    <p>But now there is no way to catch Shou Chong. So he found Er Ha and came to help.</p>

    <p>"Although I am good at tracking this kind of thing, you should be able to do it, right?" Er Ha said.</p>

    <p>"It's just that I haven't acted with Brother Dog for a long time. I miss him a bit." Lord Diulei said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"This place was blown up very clean. It has also been specially treated. A few months ago, with my strength, I would not have been able to achieve this level of tracking. But now, it is possible." Er Ha said.</p>

    <p>Tracking scents has always been a dog's instinct. Although it changed from a toad to a dog, it has now become more accustomed to its own body.</p>

    <p>It looked at Lord Diulei: "Do you have any personal belongings of Shou Chong's own?"</p>

    <p>A disciple from the Office of Strategic Deception took the initiative and approached: "Elder Dog, we have prepared it according to the master's instructions. These things were all collected from the apartment under Shou Chong's name. I don't know if they can be used."</p>

    <p>"This is enough." Er Ha said, "And. Don't call me Elder Dog... Call me Mr. Er Ha!"</p>

    <p>He felt that Elder Dog was scolding people with that title...</p>

    <p>"Okay, sir. Elder Dog."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"So, what do you want, Mr. Er?"</p>

    <p>"What we collected here include paper towels stained with unknown liquid, underwear that was thrown into the washing machine but looked unwashed and had unknown yellow stains, and a pair of socks that were no longer clearly white and smelled of rotten salted fish. And..." the disciple replied enthusiastically.</p>

    <p>"Forget it. Just bring this bag of things to me. Stop describing it..."</p>

    <p>"Okay. Mr. Er."</p>

    <p>Although just listening to the description, Er Ha could already predict that the contents in the bag were extremely disgusting. But when it put its nose close to it, it felt like it was almost poisonous and died...</p>

    <p>"Are all older single straight men so sloppy?" Er Ha was disgusted.</p>

    <p>"Haha. It depends on the situation. This reminds me of Brother Xiao Yin." Lord Diulei said.</p>

    <p>"Xiao Yin? What did he do again?"</p>

    <p>"That's right. Brother Yin has been obsessed with writing lately, hasn't he? He recently wrote a scene where the male and female protagonists kiss. Then he was shocked to find that his protagonist's first kiss was gone. But his was still there."</p>

    <p>"..." Er Ha.</p>

    <p>This is indeed a sad story...</p>

    <p>After remembering the indescribable smell inside the bag, Er Ha's hair stood on end: "It's done. Now, all we need to do is set out and find him."</p>

    <p>"Yes. Thank you, Brother Dog." Lord Diulei said.</p>

    <p>"Even if he hides in the ends of the earth, I will definitely be able to find him!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>So... about ten minutes later.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei and Er Ha appeared at the edge of the Virtual Realm....</p>
