  <h1>Chapter 1229 How many waves of people are there?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Zhuo Yi uses a {face pinching pill} on the market to simply groom himself. The face can be adjusted within half an hour after taking this pill. By then, the facial features will become soft like plasticine. But obviously Zhuo Yi Zhuo Yi's face pinching technique is not very good. He pinched his face at Wei Zhi's house. After pinching, he couldn't help but exclaimed: "Hey! So ugly!"</p>

    <p>"But it has worked." Zhenyuan immortal leaned against the door. He looked at Zhuo Yi in the mirror. He exuded a very immortal smile.</p>

    <p>"Senior Zhenyuan laughed." Zhuo Yi scratched his head in embarrassment. Anyway, he was just pinching his face to perform the task. His skills were too poor and there was nothing he could do.</p>

    <p>"You look like an Internet writer now."</p>

    <p>"There can't be an uglier writer than this, right?"</p>

    <p>"Ku Xuan."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Everything was ready. The two of them came to the underground parking garage of the cadre apartment. They walked to a white Wuling Hongguang. This car belonged to Wei Zhi and had been specially modified by Wei Zhi. There was a lot of space inside, which could accommodate dozens of animals. The large spiritual beast is an essential tool for Wei Zhi to bring up his family. Now it has been urgently requisitioned by Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi is not worried at all that the car will be damaged. The Office of Strategic Deception has money. Even if it is damaged, he will compensate himself. And he will definitely get a better one.</p>

    <p>"This car is very strong." Zhenyuan touched the material of this white Wuling Hongguang van. He found that the outer material was armored material. It was the same material as the airborne immortal ship. The texture was light and strong. In addition, the outer material of the body was added. Spell coating. It can even withstand several waves of psychic missile attacks.</p>

    <p>"Get in the car." Zhuo Yi shouted and took the initiative to sit in the driver's seat.</p>

    <p>As the car drove out, Zhuo Yi saw a familiar old man. This person was none other than Marshal Jiang!</p>

    <p>"not good..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi felt that they might be in trouble. When the van passed the gate, they were stopped by Marshal Jiang as expected.</p>

    <p>Mr. Jiang was wearing a singlet and vest. He was shaking a cattail leaf fan in his hand. He glanced at Zhuo Yi after the disguise: "Parking fee. 5 yuan."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was stunned for a moment.</p>

    <p>"Parking fee. 5 yuan... Hurry up. Things are so messy." Mr. Jiang was a little impatient: "Are you Xiaozhi's friends? Why haven't I seen you?"</p>

    <p>"I came here unexpectedly for a visit." Zhuo Yi pretended to be calm and handed over a 5 yuan bill.</p>

    <p>"Okay. Let's go, let's go." Mr. Jiang accepted the money and threw it into a shabby-looking iron box next to him.</p>

    <p>Then he pressed the remote control on his hand and opened the gate: "Go out to do errands. Be careful."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi felt like there was something in his words. But he didn't dare to stop for much longer. He kicked the accelerator and drove the car up the slope.</p>

    <p>Mr. Jiang smiled when he saw the van driving away.</p>

    <p>At this time, beside the iron box filled with change, the elderly machine that had not yet hung up also gave a hearty smile: "Hahaha. I knew this kid was fine!"</p>

    <p>"Dakang. Are you relieved now?"</p>

    <p>"He is my chosen successor. I always have to care about him." On the other end of the phone, Secretary Dakang said with a smile: "This kid can bring me some surprises every time. His clone... even binds the spirit." The lock has been deceived!"</p>

    <p>"So, do you have any clues about this matter now? It's a bit big. Although it's not completely overturned, it will definitely be chaotic in the next few days." Marshal Jiang asked, shaking his cattail leaf fan.</p>

    <p>"The person behind this is already suspected by Head of State. But for now it's better to stay put."</p>

    <p>"Head of State suspects that one of the ten of us has been invaded by ethereal spirits?"</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>"What the hell is this..." Marshal Jiang felt a little headache.</p>

    <p>"I don't know. But it can be concluded that this thing is not a good source of stubble. You should also be careful, Old Jiang. This thing seems to have a special way. Not only can it stick to it, but it can also spread."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Leaving the cadre apartment. Zhuo Yi was still a little frightened about what happened just after passing through the gate: "How do I feel? I was discovered."</p>

    <p>"It has been discovered. But the kid didn't reveal it directly." Zhenyuan Immortal said with a smile from the passenger seat.</p>

    <p>"kid..."</p>

    <p>"Thousands of years ago, when this old man was a child, I had a fight with him. He cried and shouted for revenge. Now he may have forgotten about it."</p>

    <p>"..." Zhuo Yi was surprised in his heart. Xindao Zhenyuan Immortal is indeed a legendary cultivator on earth. The man who created the Gate to Another World.</p>

    <p>I even saw the Ten Generals when they were young...</p>

    <p>This level of cultivation must have lasted tens of thousands of years?</p>

    <p>At this time Zhuo Yi suddenly had an idea. If his master also had tens of thousands of years of experience, how terrible would it be?</p>

    <p>Need to know. He is only 16 years old now.</p>

    <p>Driving the vehicle, Zhuo Yi was speeding all the way. Finally, he was stuck in a traffic jam not far from the intersection leading to a toll station outside Songhai City. Zhenyuan instantly understood what Zhuo Yi was thinking.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid this is an attempt to cut off the nonsense.</p>

    <p>"Previously, the intelligence department of the Office of Strategic Deception sent a message saying that Keorn has been sent out of Songhai Number 1 Prison and will be transferred to Jinghua City."</p>

    <p>"Choose a vehicle for delivery?"</p>

    <p>"The other party is very cunning. They chose multiple routes and sent out multiple surveillance vehicles. According to the calculations of the intelligence department, the possibility of this route is as high as 70%."</p>

    <p>"What if I make a mistake in judgment?"</p>

    <p>"Then we have to leave it to Zhenjun and the others."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi sighed slightly. He looked closely at the ETC channel at the toll station.</p>

    <p>About ten minutes later, as expected, a black and white modified off-road surveillance vehicle drove through the passage.</p>

    <p>"It is indeed in the car." Zhenyuan Immortal made a judgment from a distance. His perception ability is extremely strong. Even though the surveillance vehicle is heavily protected, he can still feel the smell of Keorn on the car.</p>

    <p>Although he has never met Keorn, he knows that Keorn is a foreigner. He has been in prison for too long and has no time to wear cologne to cover it up. The body odor on his body is very obvious.</p>

    <p>"Get ready. Senior Zhenyuan." Zhuo Yi's mental power was concentrated to the extreme.</p>

    <p>The two were just about to take action when several figures flew out of the green belt beside them.</p>

    <p>This group of people were wearing pitch-black night clothes. They seemed to have been hibernating here for a long time. There were six of them in total.</p>

    <p>The moment the prison vehicle passed by, these six people took action at the same time. They kicked and flew swords. The moment they appeared, they launched a concentrated fire attack on the prison vehicle.</p>

    <p>"It seems that we are not the only ones who want to kidnap them."</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan pressed Zhuo Yi's shoulder: "Friend Zhuo, don't move. Let's wait and see."</p>

    <p>He seemed to have expected that there would be others to cut him off. His expression was indifferent.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, just after he finished speaking, the covers of drainage wells on both sides of the road were suddenly lifted off. A second passerby rushed out... They were also wearing night clothes and covered themselves tightly. Zhenyuan was far away from him. I smelled a strong herbal smell on this group of people. They seemed to have been engaged in alchemy work all year round.</p>

    <p>"Two groups of people..." Zhuo Yi was surprised. If we include them, there are already three groups of people!</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan Immortal shook his head. His face was expressionless: "No. There is still a way."</p>

    <p>Then Zhuo Yi saw several more muscular figures in the air, like magic soldiers descending from the sky. They suddenly fell down and landed in the middle of the road...</p>

    <p>"There are... so many people..." Zhuo Yi's mouth twitched. But judging from this formation, it is enough to see Keorn's criticality.</p>

    <p>What does this person say? They have to take it down!</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, Fellow Daoist Zhuo. Next, just watch my performance."</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhenyuan Immortal smiled slightly. He stared at the battlefield ahead and squinted his eyes.</p>

    <p>"Then. Everyone, get down."</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Zhuo Yi only heard a "Boom!!"</p>

    <p>The ground in front of the toll station suddenly cracked. The road surface collapsed deeply.</p>

    <p>Three groups of people came out from several directions, a total of more than forty people. They all lay on the ground like toads, unable to move!</p>

    <p>Their faces were ferocious. Their expressions were distorted. Their entire faces were pressed into the ground, and they howled in pain.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi thought that he had seen many big scenes. But he was still stunned by the "generous act" of Zhenyuan Immortal people. His mouth opened wide.</p>

    <p>"It's definitely far behind Ling Zhenren. These are all trivial scenes. Just directional gravity suppression. Go and pick up the head. Fellow Daoist Zhuo." Zhenyuan immortal patted Zhuo Yi on the shoulder.</p>
