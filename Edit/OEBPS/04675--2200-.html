    <p>.The daily life of the immortal king</p>

    <p>The biggest taboo of those with system abilities is often exposing their own abilities. This is almost the biggest secret for every system person. It is absolutely impossible to reveal any information about the system unless it is absolutely necessary.</p>

    <p>Even though Huang Mao and his partners have known each other for a while, they have never revealed anything about the system to each other.</p>

    <p>They believe that there are system gods in this world. And they also call these system gods: Lord.</p>

    <p>It is because of the existence of the Lord that they have the ability to surpass most ordinary monks even if they do not have strong cultivation talents.</p>

    <p>Duan Hantian's condition sounds very tempting, but in Huang Mao's eyes it is nonsense.</p>

    <p>Even if this company gathers all kinds of capable people who work for them wholeheartedly, it is really nonsense to directly separate the system and break away from the constraints of the master.</p>

    <p>"Lu Jing."</p>

    <p>Seeing that Huang Mao was still hesitating. There was no response for a long time. Duan Hantian smiled lightly: "If you don't want to say it, I understand. But it's a pity. If that's the case, I can't help you." Provide any valid information. As for whether you can join the company, it depends on your ability."</p>

    <p>Duan Hantian turned on his phone and quickly replied to several interview messages in front of Lu Jing. He raised his eyebrows and said, "If you don't intend to share it with me, I have other interviewees here who are interested in exchanging information."</p>

    <p>Duan Hantian spoke eloquently.</p>

    <p>To be honest. As the company's chief interviewer, he has seen this situation many times.</p>

    <p>These system ability users were all very cautious when they first came into contact with each other. They were afraid that the "master" behind them would punish them.</p>

    <p>But in fact, there is nothing magical about the existence of the system itself in Duan Hantian's opinion.</p>

    <p>"Since our company was founded, many people with system skills have joined the company. The upper management knows their details clearly. If we really have bad intentions, guess why they don't leave? Why are there more job seekers now? Our company?" After saying that, Duan Hantian waved his hand to signal Lu Jing and others to leave.</p>

    <p>Lu Jing stared at Duan Hantian. After a fierce ideological struggle, he finally sighed and said: "I need to go and ask our boss. It won't be long. Give me half an hour."</p>

    <p>Duan Hantian looked calm, as if he had expected it. He narrowed his eyes and smiled: "Okay."</p>

    <p>After watching Lu Jing and the others leave the private room, Duan Hantian rubbed the center of his brows. His index finger produced a spiritual light and tapped his temple. Soon a voice came, communicating with him remotely.</p>

    <p>The old voice contained a little slyness and depth: "Is everything okay?"</p>

    <p>Just listen. Duan Hantian said to the person on the other side: "Yes. Everything is going well. Lu Jing is already asking Zhi Jiunian for instructions. Everything that has happened so far is as the boss expected."</p>

    <p>"The boss's prediction will never go wrong. This is a big game. If successful, we will become the richest people in the entire world of cultivation." said the old voice on the other side.</p>

    <p>"I understand."</p>

    <p>Duan Hantian tapped his nails on the table in front of him: "It's just that I still don't understand why the boss is so interested in this wise man. I have been working under the boss for a while, and I am also a good person. Countless. Why haven't I heard of such a person before?"</p>

    <p>"You don't need to ask any more questions. Just do as you're told."</p>

    <p>"I'm the interviewer. I have to know some details."</p>

    <p>Duan Hantian sighed helplessly.</p>

    <p>Said: "At the very least, you have to tell me what kind of special abilities this Zhi Jiunian has. Is he also a fool system capable person who believes in a master?" The voice on the other side fell silent for a moment.</p>

    <p>Then he said: "No. His ability is far more powerful than the system. It should be the same ability as the boss."</p>

    <p>"Same ability as boss?"</p>

    <p>Duan Hantian had an expression of disbelief on his face.</p>

    <p>"But this has not been specifically verified. Even the boss is just suspicious."</p>

    <p>When the person on the other end of the phone said this, Duan Hantian suddenly understood.</p>

    <p>For the boss, the success or failure of this interview is not the key. Instead, he wants to use this clue from Lu Jing to dig deeper into more clues about Zhi Jiunian.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Sun Rong trained with Lao Huang. It is not that easy to catch aliens smuggling across Songhai City.</p>

    <p>I met those octopus people before. It was just the octopus people's bad luck. Songhai is so big and there are so many construction routes. But I bumped into Wang Ling on that road.</p>

    <p>In a sense, they are lucky. At least before a more tragic incident happened, they were able to step back from the cliff in time under the guidance of Wang Ling. Otherwise, they would collectively do those anti-human things later. Operation. Let alone return to their home planet, these octopus people might just turn into boxes and fall directly on the earth.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling discovered that although Lao Huang was reborn on the earth by his own magical means, Lao Huang still relied on his natural social and optimist attributes to make some friends. He has already formed a little bit of his own. Personal connections.</p>

    <p>He was driving a black off-road vehicle. Wang Ling and Sun Rong fastened their seat belts and sat obediently in the back seat.</p>

    <p>Lao Huang said: "You guys sit tight."</p>

    <p>"Where do we go now?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"I met some capable people in the group. They have a gathering of capable people. And they just sent me the invitation code. Since no one knows the clues about this batch of smuggling aliens, I thought it would be a good idea to brainstorm. Not a bad choice."</p>

    <p>The expression on Lao Huang's face was a little excited. He was eager to try: "I also want to see. Apart from those with system abilities, what other abilities do these people have?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Sun Rong looked at each other. Both of them tacitly began to lament the diversity of the modern world of cultivation.</p>

    <p>Now that the earth has been upgraded, there are tens of billions of human monks on the entire earth. Wang Ling has actually thought of it for a long time. With such a large population base, not everyone wants to be a high-ranking monk. They are all willing to follow the path of honest cultivation.</p>

    <p>Searching for various secret techniques seems to have become a new trend that many low-level monks are following...</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling knows two people with their own abilities.</p>

    <p>That is Xiang Yi and Qin Zhong.</p>

    <p>One can travel back and forth between two realms.</p>

    <p>The other one has made it all the way to where he is now with the help of extremely lucky buffs.</p>

    <p>But in the final analysis, these two people have been able to make it all the way to this point. Wang Ling admits that it is somewhat related to him...</p>

    <p>As for the rest of the people on earth, the so-called capable ones.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling always had a gut feeling.</p>

    <p>Why did the more he looked at these people, the more he thought they looked like Jiucai...</p>
