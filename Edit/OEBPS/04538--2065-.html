  <h1>Chapter 2065 Wuji Sword. Drop of water penetrates stone</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: People's hearts are sinister. It is impossible to guard against them. After being tricked twice, Wang Muyu has completely given up resistance.</p>

    <p>The inner world of adults is too complicated. Can't we use less routines...</p>

    <p>Although he was accepted as a disciple by Yi Jianchuan's "routine", in fact, it was mainly because the sword master in front of him was not as bad as he thought.</p>

    <p>Today was the first time they met. They had known each other for less than two hours. Wang Muyu could feel a trace of tranquility from this person. It was a kind of tranquility without any clutter.</p>

    <p>It was only at this time that Wang Muyu finally understood why Wang Ling would arrange for him to be in such a state where his combat power was not as good as his master.</p>

    <p>What Wang Ling wants him to cultivate is not his realm or his fighting power, but his state of mind.</p>

    <p>It is also important for cultivators to practice and hone their mental state. Having a stable and uplifting mental state is even more beneficial than going to those dangerous secret realms to continuously participate in battles.</p>

    <p>Defeating monsters and upgrading is certainly a way. But if you don't think about it, your level will certainly increase, but what you train is just muscle memory. Once you encounter a bottleneck, if your mood is not enough, you will not be able to break through smoothly.</p>

    <p>This is one of the reasons why many cultivators stop at the Nascent Soul stage. From Nascent Soul to Soul Formation. How to understand the true meaning of Soul Formation is a hurdle.</p>

    <p>And from Soul Formation to Itinerant Immortal. Then from Itinerant Immortal to True Immortal. And then from True Immortal to a higher realm...the higher realm. In the end, what you often face is the test of your state of mind.</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, Wang Muyu couldn't help but feel happy.</p>

    <p>It seems like Wang Ling still cares about him very much.</p>

    <p>Because his situation is very special. After all, he has relied on the power of his natural bloodline genes to achieve a terrifying state and fighting power that is not suitable for his age. If he does not temper his state of mind at this time, once he becomes possessed in the future, the collapse of his mind will directly make him The realm fell and became a useless person.</p>

    <p>"What are you thinking about, little guy? You are smiling so happily." Yi Jianchuan's voice was kind. He originally thought that Wang Muyu was a very calm child and would not be happy because he accepted him as his disciple. But now he saw The little guy suddenly laughed. He couldn't help but feel a little happy in his heart.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, he is still a child. The most honest and innocent existence...</p>

    <p>"No... nothing. I'm just a little happy." Wang Muyu bowed. Then he knelt down on the bamboo raft and said, "Meet Master."</p>

    <p>He has a very high emotional intelligence and does not reveal his inner thoughts at all. And this worship has directly confirmed their fate as master and disciple.</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan was even more happy. Since he was named Sword Master, he has been looking for a genius who can inherit his legacy. Unexpectedly, it was only now that he got such an extremely talented disciple under the recommendation of Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>Now, he really owed Lord Diulei and the Office of Strategic Deception a huge favor!</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan looked at the sky and sighed with some emotion in his heart.</p>

    <p>Then, he bent down and helped Wang Muyu up with his own hands: "Get up quickly, good disciple!"</p>

    <p>This sound made Wang Muyu's skin crawl all over: "Teacher, I'm still not used to it... Otherwise, you should be like Zhenjun. Just call me Muyu."</p>

    <p>"Mu Yu?"</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan muttered for a while and quickly realized that this was the homophonic pronunciation of "Muyu." He immediately laughed and said, "It's a bit interesting. Compared with children of the same age, your expression is a bit old-fashioned and Muyu. However, I feel that you are imitating someone and it is not the real you."</p>

    <p>I have to say. These words directly exposed Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>Indeed. He doesn't like to show his expressions. He is just imitating Wang Ling. Because it's cool.</p>

    <p>But sometimes when he thinks of happy things, he still can't help but show his true colors.</p>

    <p>"Muyu, please remember that to practice Taoism, you have to follow your own path. You don't have to imitate anyone, and you don't have to imitate me. In the end, you have to find your own way."</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan's words have a strong heart and a long way.</p>

    <p>This was his first lesson after he officially accepted Wang Muyu as his personal disciple.</p>

    <p>Very simple words, but they were like enlightenment. They made Wang Muyu's pupils shrink severely.</p>

    <p>"Come. Now I will teach you the Sword I developed myself."</p>

    <p>On the bamboo raft, Yi Jianchuan stood with his hands behind his back. The waves of energy from his sword floated up from his feet.</p>

    <p>"But teacher, didn't you say that I should go my own way?"</p>

    <p>"The master leads you to practice individually. What I just said is the way of practice. It is the great avenue. Sword is just a branch of it. If you want to subdivide it further, Sword can derive countless different methods. Although The world calls me the Sword Master. But after all, this is just a false name."</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan said: "A true master will always have the heart of an apprentice."</p>

    <p>"I understand, teacher." Wang Muyu nodded.</p>

    <p>He still knows some sword masters' swords. Although he has never seen it with his own eyes, the Wuji Sword is indeed one of the best in the world.</p>

    <p>This sword was passed down to him by his master Jian Immortal Fan Rui. But it was in Yi Jianchuan that the Wuji Sword was truly promoted.</p>

    <p>And Wang Muyu knows it very well. Although Wuji Sword is also inferior to Heavenly Dao, it is a rare one among all Heavenly Dao sword techniques. The probability of being able to realize it directly by oneself is very low...</p>

    <p>This also means that if the Sword Master can take the Wuji Sword one step closer to another level and glimpse the sword technique Heavenly Dao from the Wuji Sword, then his sword technique Heavenly Dao will also be better than other swordsmanship cultivators. Stronger.</p>

    <p>Without further ado, in the next breath, Yi Yi Jianchuan directly started to show Wang Muyu his Wuji Sword.</p>

    <p>In an instant, the whole world was in turmoil. It began to change color immediately. The True Immortal realm was so powerful that it could trigger meteorological changes within the scope of a giant city. The clouds in the sky were split. They looked like layers of earthquake clouds. Leaving thousands of layers of trails in the sky.</p>

    <p>At this moment, even the sky was clean. There was not a trace of dust in the dark blue sky. It seemed that people could be sucked in and indulged in it.</p>

    <p>The legendary Wuji Sword is a method constructed from all the qi in the world. It is based on sword qi. It can absorb other different qi to condense and eventually transform it into its own power.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu also knew that the Sword Master had a sword hilt, an anti-realm magic weapon. With his Wuji Sword, he could release the "Sword of Victory."</p>

    <p>However, looking at it now, he found that Yi Jianchuan seemed to have improved a lot in this way. Now the Wuji Sword he used had almost no playful nature, but a real serious preaching, the kind of shock that caused the celestial phenomena. Wang Muyu really felt that he was serious about teaching.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>On the calm lake, a water droplet separated from it, floated up, and then slowly fell to Yi Jianchuan's fingertips like petals.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu saw that he was injecting his gathered energy into this small drop of water.</p>

    <p>"Wuji Sword. Drops of water penetrate stone..."</p>

    <p>After a moment, he flicked his fingertips, and a water droplet shot directly from his fingertips, heading towards the two-hundred-meter sluice in front.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu originally thought that the entire sluice would be blown down directly. But he found that from a distance, the huge sluice was still in good condition and had not moved at all.</p>

    <p>Was it a mistake?</p>

    <p>Huh? No...</p>

    <p>Soon, Wang Muyu discovered something strange.</p>

    <p>Because he saw. Just in this thick sluice, there was a small hole with light!</p>

    <p>This was directly penetrated by the drop of water from the sword master's finger!</p>

    <p>He is the pinnacle of the ninth level of True Immortal. He can really destroy the city in a fight. Not to mention such a sluice?</p>

    <p>This finger looks ordinary, but in fact it has an extremely high control over the precision of the Sword. It only used a water droplet to penetrate the thick sluice. www.uukanshu.net And it only left a bullet hole with the same diameter as the water droplet.</p>

    <p>This is not only something that can be accomplished with the realm and combat power.</p>

    <p>The more precise the operation, the higher the mental requirements.</p>

    <p>"Muyu. Next, you can try it." After the demonstration, Yi Jianchuan looked at Wang Muyu with a kind face and said patiently.</p>

    <p>"Me?" Wang Muyu couldn't believe it.</p>

    <p>"I want to see how much you have understood."</p>

    <p>"But teacher, you have already punched a hole. Is it really okay to destroy public property..."</p>

    <p>"It doesn't matter. I'll fix it myself later."</p>

    <p>He laughed: "Come on, Muyu, let me see your understanding. It doesn't matter even if you break out of the hole. The teacher will be responsible."</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu: "..."</p>
