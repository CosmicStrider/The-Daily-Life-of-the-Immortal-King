  <h1>Chapter 1620 Anti-pocketing consultant</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The bustling spirit beast market. All kinds of regular spirit beasts for sale are squatting obediently in their own glass cabinets, eating the exquisite feed prepared by the merchants, and waiting for their owners.</p>

    <p>This is the largest Lingyi Market in Songhai City. You can buy almost any spiritual beast you want.</p>

    <p>Spiritual beasts below the fifth level do not need to hold a certificate. They only need to provide the corresponding realm certificate. You can take the Golden Core home directly after paying for it.</p>

    <p>Most of the spiritual beasts above the fifth level are large spiritual beasts. That is, for example, the range from the fourth level spiritual beast to the first level spiritual beast.</p>

    <p>In addition to having a certain level, cultivators also need to provide a qualification certificate as a professional pet trainer.</p>

    <p>Being at a high level does not mean that you have the ability to control spiritual beasts and treat them well.</p>

    <p>In modern society, there is actually an equal relationship between spiritual beasts and cultivators.</p>

    <p>The seller of spirit beasts actually plays the role of an intermediary.</p>

    <p>In addition to the cost of feeding the spirit beast, the intermediary fee and monthly store maintenance fees are also included in the funds for purchasing the spirit beast.</p>

    <p>Of course, the largest proportion of this money is the employment fee of spiritual beasts.</p>

    <p>Said it was to buy a spiritual beast.</p>

    <p>In fact, you hire a spiritual beast to fight for you. And the money is also transferred to the exclusive account of the hired spiritual beast.</p>

    <p>High-level spiritual beasts have intelligence. They know how to trade and enjoy life.</p>

    <p>So now we see some transformed spiritual beasts appearing in downtown areas on the market. It is not surprising to modern monks.</p>

    <p>Of course, permanent employment buyouts are also available.</p>

    <p>It requires the mutual will between the employer and the spirit beast to sign a contract.</p>

    <p>The effectiveness will last until the employer is extinct and cannot inherit the spirit beast. Or the spirit beast dies.</p>

    <p>Such an equal and strict cultivation system was simply unimaginable aeons ago.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui was standing in this huge spirit animal market. Feeling the noisy voices of people and the screams of spirit animals around him, he suddenly felt like he was in another world.</p>

    <p>A few days ago he and Li Xian watched a classic movie {The Shawshank Redemption}.</p>

    <p>There was an old man inside who had been in prison for decades.</p>

    <p>When the old man was released from prison, he couldn't adapt to the modern world.</p>

    <p>In the end, the old man chose to hang himself in the hotel where he was staying.</p>

    <p>When Zhang Zhui and Li Xian saw this, they also found two ropes.</p>

    <p>At that time, Wei Zhi opened the door.</p>

    <p>I saw two people hanging on the rafters chatting...</p>

    <p>They are eternal strong men who cannot die.</p>

    <p>In a sense, it's quite lonely.</p>

    <p>This scene at that time had a profound impression on Wei Zhi.</p>

    <p>I feel like these two strange uncles are engaging in some sort of performance art.</p>

    <p>But now Li Xian and Zhang Zhui. Because Wang Ling can use them. They need to adapt to modern life.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the two of them are also working hard to learn and adapt.</p>

    <p>"Xiao Zhi."</p>

    <p>The two of them were walking well.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, Zhang Zhui stopped Wei Zhi.</p>

    <p>"What's wrong, senior?" Wei Zhi showed a confused face.</p>

    <p>"Go ahead and buy it. I want to sit by the fountain for a while. I haven't seen so many people for a long time." Zhang Zhui sighed.</p>

    <p>"Okay." Wei Zhi nodded and agreed happily. Before leaving, he asked: "Senior, please don't take other people's things randomly..."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry. I'm now an advisor to the anti-pocketeering team. I have to set an example." Zhang Zhui responded.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi felt relieved. He saw Zhang Zhui sitting down by the spring. He stared at it for a few seconds before leaving.</p>

    <p>Although he felt that he didn't quite understand what kind of person Zhang Zhui was.</p>

    <p>But looking at it from the back.</p>

    <p>He felt that the two new uncles Zhang Zhui and Li Xian must have stories!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui was sitting by the fountain, feeling the atmosphere of the downtown area, thoughtfully in his heart.</p>

    <p>The modern society of cultivation seems to be much smaller than that of the Eternal Era. However, the group of sentient beings in front of him has become the condensation of the Eternal Era. It always makes Zhang Zhui's thoughts go back to a long, long time ago unconsciously.</p>

    <p>While he was settling.</p>

    <p>Deep in my heart, I am constantly reflecting on the things I have done. Even though it has become a thing of the past, I can never go back.</p>

    <p>After sitting quietly for a while, Zhang Zhui received a call from Li Xian: "Brother Zi Xiang. Where are you now? Why did you leave me alone in the meeting and sneak out by yourself?"</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui smiled: "Aren't you going out for a walk with little friend Wei Zhi? The world is so big. I want to go for a walk too."</p>

    <p>"That's right. I received a request for help from the Office of Strategic Deception. They need to investigate a man with a thousand faces." Li Xian told Zhang Zhui exactly what Lord Diulei said.</p>

    <p>"Everyone sees a different face, right?" Zhang Zhui frowned.</p>

    <p>"Yes. Because we don't know the identity of the Man with a Thousand Faces. Fellow student Sun Rong is very disturbed. You know that. That girl and Ling Zhenren are good friends. If we can help her. Maybe we can get Ms. Sun to put in a good word for us."</p>

    <p>"I understand." Zhang Zhui nodded.</p>

    <p>In terms of sophistication, he and Li Xian are both experienced. There is no need to say more.</p>

    <p>"So what can you think of? A spell that can make everyone see different faces? Is this an illusion?" Li Xian admitted that he had vast experience, but he had never heard of such a spell.</p>

    <p>The main reason is that everyone sees different faces. Even Li Xian couldn't see through it himself. He stared at the screenshot for a long time. He found that the person in the picture was a little lolita wearing white stockings... and others Everyone sees it differently.</p>

    <p>"What a hell. Now there is a rumor in the Office of Strategic Deception that I am a lolicon. I am not a paladin legend." Li Xian held his forehead and felt a deep headache from this.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui held his chin and thought for a while. Then he said: "I have thought of a spell. But that spell originated from eternity..."</p>

    <p>"Eternal magic? How is this possible?" Li Xian was surprised.</p>

    <p>"Although the probability is very low, I think it is not completely impossible to happen. Even though Dao Ancestor Wang has locked up so many people in the picture, I still believe that there must be some people who have been missed."</p>

    <p>"Brother Zi Xiang means that apart from us, there are still those who are still alive today? And they are still living a secluded life in the human world?"</p>

    <p>"It's just speculation. There is no conclusive evidence."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui said: "But this matter is a bit troublesome. To be able to activate such an illusion, you must at least be an Earthly Ancestor. But why would an Earthly Ancestor find such a little girl to make a deal? This is something I have no idea about. I can't understand it."</p>

    <p>Things get interesting.</p>

    <p>In fact, Zhang Zhui felt that instead of conducting such a mindless investigation, it would be faster to go directly to Jiang Yingying and ask for clarification.</p>

    <p>"Going to Miss Jiang directly? That's not good..."</p>

    <p>"It's just a secret investigation. Since Miss Jiang has already met him once, she will definitely make an appointment again."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui said: "In the evening, Brother Li Xian and I will go to Miss Jiang's house to have a look."</p>

    <p>"Cultivation communities in modern society have wall-penetrating alarms. If you use the wall-penetrating technique, you will be discovered..." Li Xian was worried.</p>

    <p>"Who said we were going to go through the wall?"</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui hehe: "It would be over if we just pick the lock."</p>

    <p>This is.</p>

    <p>He is good at his old job...</p>

    <p>Li Xian was shocked: "Aren't you already an anti-pocketing consultant now..."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui: "This is called familiarity with business. If you don't practice for too long, your hands will become rusty. If I am a consultant, how can I be a consultant for others?"</p>

    <p>Li Xian: "..."</p>
