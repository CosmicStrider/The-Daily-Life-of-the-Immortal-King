  <h1>Chapter 1592 Wang Ling's Determination</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When Wang Ling proposed using the Chaos Divine Feather as a material for upgrading the Spirit Sword, Zhang Zhui couldn't help but break into a cold sweat.</p>

    <p>He's just a child after all... He's a waste of money! This feather is worth many times more than the Supreme Corpse Map... It's actually used to strengthen the spirit sword?</p>

    <p>What to do if the reinforcement fails?</p>

    <p>Although Zhang Zhui is in Corpse Map, he is also a knowledgeable person. The fantasy world in the picture allows Zhang Zhui to actually surf the Internet in Corpse Map.</p>

    <p>This reminded him of the computer game called Poisoned Milk Powder that he played many years ago.</p>

    <p>The enhanced equipment almost made him sick!</p>

    <p>Once you fail, you have to tear everything down and start over again...</p>

    <p>Because in the world wrapped in Corpse Map, Zhang Zhui cannot recharge directly. Therefore, his wealth in these modern online games is all derived from his daily game play.</p>

    <p>Cultivators can originally stay awake for long periods of time.</p>

    <p>In addition, Zhang Zhui is essentially a dead person...so. Dead people don't need to rest. There is no need to worry about the wear and tear of the liver due to staying up late for a long time.</p>

    <p>Because Zhang Zhui doesn't have a liver to wear.</p>

    <p>Take the Feather. Wang Ling's heart was still in a state of tranquility. He knew Zhang Zhui must be cursing himself for being a loser.</p>

    <p>But let me tell you something. Wang Ling has always had a very high vision.</p>

    <p>This Chaos Divine Feather may be a good thing in Zhang Zhui's eyes, but in Wang Ling's eyes, it is actually just a discardable strengthening material.</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling is serious.</p>

    <p>The value of this Chaos Divine Feather is not as great as the Corpse Map wrapped around it.</p>

    <p>Although the concentration of chaos wrapped in the Corpse Map is not as high as that of the Chaos Divine Feather, it has been circulating for eternity after all. In addition, there are big bosses like Zhang Zhui in the picture.</p>

    <p>With this picture. Wang Ling can always understand the secrets of cultivation in the universe that he has never understood.</p>

    <p>These ancient powerful men who were suppressed by Dao Ancestor Wang in the Corpse Map are now the largest knowledge reserve in Wang Ling. It can be called a portable encyclopedia.</p>

    <p>Of course. The most important thing is!</p>

    <p>This Corpse Map is under the sole control of Wang Ling. He will not talk to himself and do other unnecessary things...</p>

    <p>Just like the iPad Sage Immortal Book that he had given away.</p>

    <p>After passing the swamp area of the second level, Wang Ling continues on the road.</p>

    <p>The small world in the third room ahead is completely different from the previous two levels.</p>

    <p>It's not as scary as a dead forest. It doesn't have the mysterious atmosphere of a swamp.</p>

    <p>This is a world full of white mist. All kinds of rays of light are transpiring, rolling turbulently in the chaos.</p>

    <p>The foggy world is full of dangers.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling approached here, I clearly felt that the glow here was different. It was very heavy on my shoulders. It was a weight that ordinary cultivators could not bear.</p>

    <p>You can Wang Ling walk in the mist. Just like walking on flat ground...</p>

    <p>The brisk pace made Zhang Zhui, who was wrapped in the Corpse Map, shouting "pervert" in his heart.</p>

    <p>This "abnormal" doesn't mean anything else. It's just that I simply feel that Wang Ling's power is so unnatural that I can't help but burst out in exclamation in my heart.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling walked in this mist. It feels like he is watching an old movie. It seems as if he has experienced several eras.</p>

    <p>Countless creatures that were extinct in the universe appeared before his eyes. He saw a girl riding a white jade unicorn, and also saw an old man fishing for a void dragon with a straight hook...</p>

    <p>All kinds of magical scenes are constantly appearing in front of my eyes.</p>

    <p>This is not an illusion. This is a real scene.</p>

    <p>The King's Eyes of Wang Ling have the ability to remove the false and preserve the true. If it is false, these scenes will split immediately.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui watched the whole process with Wang Ling. He was dumbfounded and speechless.</p>

    <p>The scene in front of me is so surprising. I don't know what language to use to describe it.</p>

    <p>"The Mirror of Reality?" It took a while. He said four words in a skeptical manner.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui remembered that he had seen it in Dao Ancestor Wang's notes.</p>

    <p>There is such a magical secret realm in the universe. It is constructed based on the laws of the Almighty. All the scenes here have an effect very similar to that of a cosmic album.</p>

    <p>Various classic scenes from the development period of the entire universe will be preserved and then continuously "played" in the secret realm. These scenes look like images, but in fact they are all visible and tangible.</p>

    <p>There is no difference from the real scene.</p>

    <p>"When a lie becomes true, the truth is also false... In this world of illusion and reality, I am afraid that it would be easy to do it with the power of the alien god Sotos." Zhang Zhui said.</p>

    <p>Sotos is known as the Omniscient of the Outer Gods. He's a master of the universe. He knows everything. He knows every inch of the universe.</p>

    <p>It is not difficult to create such an unfathomable realm. The Mirror of Reality.</p>

    <p>However, these seemingly beautiful pictures always make Zhang Zhui feel unreal.</p>

    <p>Outer gods have always regarded human cultivators as fodder. They are extremely hostile.</p>

    <p>If The Mirror of Reality is really created by "Sotos", it should contain scenes from the glorious days when the Old Dominators dominated the universe...</p>

    <p>And sure enough.</p>

    <p>The next second Zhang Zhui had doubts in his heart, the scenes in front of him suddenly changed!</p>

    <p>Originally a smiling girl riding on a white jade unicorn.</p>

    <p>Suddenly the seated unicorn turns its head and bites back.</p>

    <p>The little girl screamed. She saw that the white jade unicorn had gone berserk. It bit her neck off. It crushed her head like a watermelon...</p>

    <p>It turns out that a parasitic spore has been implanted by the Old Dominator underneath the unicorn's curly hair.</p>

    <p>The spore grows rapidly inside the body of the White Jade unicorn, nourished by the blood of the unicorn. It developed invisible tentacles. It manipulated the Jade Forest Spirit into biting its master to death.</p>

    <p>The tentacles grew by eating them. Finally, the body of the White Jade Unicorn became the new "Old Dominator."</p>

    <p>As for the old man fishing with a straight hook, the tragic situation between him and the little girl was as clear as day.</p>

    <p>"Onom!" Wang Nuan looked a little nervous and couldn't help but put his arms around Wang Ling's neck.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stretched out a hand and patted Wang Nuan's back gently.</p>

    <p>The scene in front of me was truly astonishingly reversed. It was a harmonious scene before. Unexpectedly, things changed in the blink of an eye.</p>

    <p>"I knew it would be like this..." Zhang Zhui sighed.</p>

    <p>However, the scenes before him reminded Zhang Zhui of another incident recorded in Dao Ancestor Wang's notes.</p>

    <p>This matter was just Dao Ancestor Wang's inference. But now after seeing the scene in front of him, Zhang Zhui felt that it made sense.</p>

    <p>Dao Ancestor Wang's inference said: "The origin of human beings probably started from the games played by the Old Dominators."</p>

    <p>The ancient universe era. That is the era when the Old Dominator ruled the universe. Far earlier than human cultivators.</p>

    <p>Therefore, it stands to reason that it is impossible for the Old Dominator to coexist with human cultivators.</p>

    <p>But "The Mirror of Reality" in front of us clearly recorded the scenes of the Old Dominators seizing the bodies of those humans...The most likely answer is that the Old Dominators once built a party with the power of law in order to expand their race. A new spiritual world.</p>

    <p>And these new creatures are human beings.</p>

    <p>From the perspective of God, they manipulated human cultivators, using these humans as their own supplies, and thus continued to devour...</p>

    <p>Until one day, the Old Dominators were destroyed for unknown reasons.</p>

    <p>And the surviving fodder became the masters of the universe. They became the new masters of the universe.</p>

    <p>Of course. This answer... is just Dao Ancestor Wang's own inference. Even Zhang Zhui has no more evidence to support these things.</p>

    <p>"Boring."</p>

    <p>As for Zhang Zhui's thoughts, Wang Ling made a rare comment.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui said: "This is just inference... You know. We are old and are old conspiracy theorists. What Dao Ancestor Wang said may not be entirely correct..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed.</p>

    <p>He clenched his fists and thought thoughtfully.</p>

    <p>Perhaps. Looking at the entire universe, human civilization is so small that it is just a drop in the ocean. Naturally, it cannot be the highest civilization. There are still many shortcomings and areas for improvement.</p>

    <p>However, the emergence of the human civilization system of cultivators is by no means a subsidiary of another evil old civilization.</p>

    <p>Are you actually using The Mirror of Reality. to slander human civilization?</p>

    <p>Why don't you just make noodles that are so delicious...</p>

    <p>At this moment. Wang Ling is in the third level of the Mirror of Nothingness.</p>

    <p>A prompt appeared again in the void.</p>

    <p>Gold characters are displayed. This level requires Wang Ling to conduct a strength appraisal. At least 3 +∞ are required to pass.</p>

    <p>But for this game. Wang Ling feels a little impatient.</p>

    <p>"Do you want three +∞..." At this moment, Wang Ling frowned.</p>

    <p>Then, he rolled up the sleeve of his right hand.</p>

    <p>When Zhang Zhui saw this action, he immediately panicked: "You...what are you going to do?"</p>

    <p>I saw Wang Ling showing his fist as big as a sandbag.</p>

    <p>What to do?</p>

    <p>Of course. Overthrow this palace of the Outer Gods...</p>
