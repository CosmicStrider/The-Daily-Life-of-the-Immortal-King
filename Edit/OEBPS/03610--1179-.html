  <h1>Chapter 1179 The real crisis...</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Monday, November 17th. The third day of the National Cultivation School Physical Martial Arts Competition.</p>

    <p>At dawn. When the first ray of the sun hit Wang Ling's face on the Fire Peak, it perfectly reflected the boy's beautiful profile. Although Wang Ling had tried his best to reshape it. The face makes one's appearance average. However, a person's temperament will not change because of it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling turned his attention to the top of the circle. He followed the movements of the three-person team composed of Wang Zhen, Xiao Yin, and Er Ha. Based on the combat strength value, Wang Ling felt that the three of them were currently turning on Shadow. In this state, you will not be at a disadvantage.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling always has a bad feeling...</p>

    <p>The reason why he chose to let Wang Zhen take action to lead the man behind the scenes out was largely because he could not feel the aura of the man behind the scenes. This was something he had never seen before.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling does not think that there is anything wrong with him. He still has very terrifying and irrepressible power. However, the strange origin of this unknown person behind the scenes is indeed unheard of by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>However, for Wang Ling, the troubles at hand don't stop there.</p>

    <p>Early in the morning, Wang Ling stood on the cliff to observe Wang Zhen's movements. This move immediately triggered a discussion among the people in the Number 60 High School care Wang Ling group and the Wang Ling support club.</p>

    <p>"What is Wang Ling thinking about? He looks restless." As a good brother, Guo Hao is actually very concerned about Wang Ling's movements.</p>

    <p>To be honest, this was the first time he saw Wang Ling looking so anxious.</p>

    <p>"This guy is usually very calm during exams. I have never seen him show such an expression..." Chen Chao thought of the past Wang Ling who calmly and calmly answered the questions every time he took the exam. He was calm and composed and got an average score. It looks like. Whether it is a large or small test or a monthly exam. The expression of Wang Ling has not changed.</p>

    <p>Even though they have experienced so many activities, Wang Ling is still the most calm person.</p>

    <p>"Maybe the game lasted too long. Are you feeling anxious?" Guo Hao touched his chin. He felt that he didn't understand what was going on.</p>

    <p>"It's possible." Chen Chao nodded: "It's not necessarily because you are anxious about saving the world...how can it be so easy to be a hero these days."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>As a man with an expressionless face, he almost never shows anxiety on his face. Wang Ling never expected that his anxiety would be so obvious.</p>

    <p>Because he is used to having a paralyzed face. Even if there are some micro-expressions on his face occasionally, this is still a sharp contrast to outsiders.</p>

    <p>What should you do if your mascot becomes anxious?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling next thing they faced was naturally everyone forming a group to send warmth.</p>

    <p>The first people to arrive were Chen Chao and Guo Hao. Each of these two good brothers hooked Wang Ling's shoulders.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "Wang Ling. I think you won't be working today. Just have a good rest in the tent. I think there seems to be something wrong with your mental state. There are still several days to come. You are one of us The mascot. It must not collapse!"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao nodded. He agreed with Guo Hao's opinion: "Let's do it Wang Ling. You are originally from the Talisman production team. I will draw Talisman for you today and tomorrow! You don't have to worry about anything. Just lie down! Besides, Do you need a massage? The martial arts massage techniques I learned from my dad are very good! It can relax the mind and muscles at the same time!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was caught off guard by the sudden enthusiasm. He felt that he had underestimated the power of the fan support club organized by Xia Ming...</p>

    <p>Xia Ming previously regarded Wang Ling as a "love rival." But after being captured by Wang Ling's charisma, he has now instantly become the president of the fan support club.</p>

    <p>As the president, Xia Ming naturally came to express his concern for Wang Ling in person: "Is classmate Wang Ling feeling uncomfortable in any way? I have asked classmate Sun Rong to use the elixir-making machine to make a large pill. It's also an elixir. It's said to nourish yin and nourish the kidneys. It can help regulate qi and regulate the breath! Take one pill. It doesn't matter if you stay up late! The most important thing is that it can also strengthen the body and improve the body's immunity. It can effectively kill those difficult coronary diseases. Virus!"</p>

    <p>Xia Ming's care has just ended. Several girls in the Number 60 High School camp are also busy. Li Youyue is preparing a nutritious and luxurious breakfast.</p>

    <p>These are all foods made from local materials. Most of them are spiritual fruits and spiritual plants. Li Youyue uses her exquisite cooking skills to make fruit soup and vegetable rolls. They are both nutritious and hygienic.</p>

    <p>Of course, there are also a few boys who suggest eating meat. However, eating "game" is actually not recommended now. In addition, many of the spirit beasts in Jiulong Mountain are protective spirit beasts. Otherwise, the act of killing just to satisfy the appetite is not recommended.</p>

    <p>After all, there are many things that can be used to supplement nutrition!</p>

    <p>Regarding the suggestion that the boys wanted to eat meat, Li Youyue also tried to use her own method to send people to collect some ling beans. They relied on soy products to make simulated meat. It could barely be regarded as a meat dish that was not meat.</p>

    <p>Of course! In order to care for Wang Ling! Li Youyue specially made crispy noodles using Lingdou ingredients! They are fried and freshly baked on site! You can crush them and eat them directly with seasonings!</p>

    <p>These seasonings are also collected naturally. They can be used after grinding them into powder and mixing them.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't expect that Li Youyue was so ingenious. She could even make crispy noodles in a wild survival environment.</p>

    <p>Just for a moment. Wang Ling felt that his anxiety was really relieved a lot...</p>

    <p>Until the next moment. Sun Rong found him.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling. They said your mental state is not stable. Are you sick?"Sun Rong took the initiative and touched Wang Ling's forehead to confirm Wang Ling No illness or fever.</p>

    <p>Influenza is prevalent these days. It would definitely be troublesome if you really get a fever and get sick in the wild. But fortunately, she is almost ready to refine the Great Return Pill. Using the pill-making machine specially built by her family, it is nothing. Something too difficult.</p>

    <p>"Did classmate Sun Rong see anything?" Liu Qingyi stepped forward and asked. She actually knew that Wang Ling was completely fine.</p>

    <p>This one... is Ling Zhenren! How could something go wrong!</p>

    <p>But at this time Liu Qingyi chose to take action. In fact, it was to repay Sun Rong's favor last night. So he decided to come out and provide a wave of assists.</p>

    <p>"Tell me, could it be because the boys' tent is too messy? There are only a few in our girls' tents! Maybe someone has infected Wang Ling. I see that Nan Yixiu coughed a lot last night. Great."</p>

    <p>Cough...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling twitched the corner of his mouth.</p>

    <p>Scholar Nan Yi didn't cough very badly... He was just looking out for some boys who were peeking at the girls. But it was said that it was too dark and he didn't see anything.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought Liu Qingyi came on the scene to save him. But he was shocked to find that the other party had sold him out completely...</p>

    <p>After listening to Liu Qingyi's words, Sun Rong actually felt that it was very reasonable. Then he looked at Wang Ling and asked with a blush on his face: "Would classmate Wang Ling want to join us tonight? ..."</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Ling's thoughts were completely empty.</p>

    <p>Facing everyone's sincere care and concern, Wang Ling suddenly realized...maybe. This is the real crisis.</p>

    <p>So. Wang Ling felt that instead of relieving her anxiety symptoms, she became even more anxious...</p>

    <p>"Sleep together?" Liu Qingyi screamed. She just assisted. But she didn't expect Sun Rong to be so bold!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's face turned red. He stamped his feet anxiously: "What... I just want to say, do you want to change tents with us?"</p>
