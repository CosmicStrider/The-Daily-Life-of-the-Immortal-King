  <h1>Chapter 1844 Sun Rong vs You Yueqing</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Such frankness was completely unexpected by Sun Rong. Her red face clearly showed an expression of extreme surprise. She never expected that You Yueqing would come directly to her home at night. And she was so straightforward. Asking her questions.</p>

    <p>So this is...a provocation?</p>

    <p>Sun Rong secretly sensed with her head. But it didn't feel like it. Because when You Yueqing said this, she didn't feel any murderous intent. Instead, she felt like she was being teased.</p>

    <p>This feeling is so familiar to Sun Rong. Just like Zhuo Yi likes to make fun of her no matter what happens, calling her "Master's Wife" one after another.</p>

    <p>Now that the question has been raised, Sun Rong feels that it would be a bit too petty if she didn't give any answer. It would also appear that she cares a lot.</p>

    <p>Isn't it just Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>Just...a piece of wood...</p>

    <p>What's worth... does she care about so much?</p>

    <p>After trying hard to control her emotions, Sun Rong took a deep breath. Looking at You Yueqing, she mustered up the courage to respond: "Master You is very accurate. You are absolutely right. I like Wang Ling!"</p>

    <p>"It's true. I've calculated it correctly again! And let me tell you a little secret."</p>

    <p>You Yueqing narrowed her eyes and smiled. Then she grabbed Sun Rong's hand and said, "I like him too!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "Eh...Eh?"</p>

    <p>You Yueqing smiled and said, "There's nothing strange about this. It's normal for a cute boy to be liked by many people. Anyway, you and I haven't officially established a relationship, right? So now it can only be regarded as a relationship of fair competition."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was a little heartbroken when she heard these words. She smacked her lips and felt a bitter taste in her mouth. She couldn't find any reason to refute.</p>

    <p>When you like someone, there is no first-come, first-served basis. And no one stipulates that Wang Ling must be hers...</p>

    <p>It can only be said that You Yueqing is a very difficult opponent. This is the first time Sun Rong feels this way.</p>

    <p>This Taoist priest is far less naive than Jiang Yingying. She was sent away easily.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong feels that she may experience a tough battle next.</p>

    <p>"The Taoist priest came to me at night just to ask about this matter? If there is anything else, do you want to sit down and chat slowly?"</p>

    <p>To You Yueqing's surprise. Sun Rong was much calmer than she expected. After hearing what she just said, not only did she not mean to drive her away, but she actually chose to keep her here.</p>

    <p>Then. Sun Rong clapped her hands and asked the head maid to serve tea. A sweet smell immediately spread out. The lavender tea was dotted with stars. It seemed like the Milky Way was reflected on the lake at night.</p>

    <p>You Yueqing took a sip and licked her lower lip. Before Sun Rong could introduce it, she said in surprise, "Is it made from the best moonlit grass?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was surprised. Unexpectedly, You Yueqing also studied tea ceremony. And she could distinguish the varieties after just one sip.</p>

    <p>The spiritual tea soaked in the best moonlit night grass has the effect of calming the mind and tonifying the brain. It is very suitable for taking at night. It also has the ability to improve memory. Drinking tea while memorizing can ensure that the knowledge points are constantly reinforced in the mind and will not be forgotten. The effect can last for several months.</p>

    <p>It's exam season soon. Sun Rong always prepares more at home.</p>

    <p>However, Moonlight Grass is valuable. And because of the harsh growing conditions, the number of artificially cultivated plants is very limited.</p>

    <p>The best tea grass like this grows in the natural environment. There are strict picking standards every year. Therefore, the quantity is even more scarce. One gram of tea grass can be sold for immortal gold.</p>

    <p>Sipping tea leisurely and contentedly, You Yueqing's mood became extremely good. She looked at Sun Rong's face that looked troubled but was actually very worried. She felt a little funny in her heart.</p>

    <p>After about a few minutes, You Yueqing started to intervene: "It seems that classmate Sun Rong still doesn't regard me as a friend. I obviously asked you to call me Xiaoqing. But in the end, you still said You Daochang."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "No. Xiaoqing, you are thinking too much..."</p>

    <p>"You don't have to force yourself to call me that. I understand very well. After all, we are in a competitive relationship. There is nothing wrong with respecting your competitors."</p>

    <p>You Yueqing put down the tea cup in her hand. She said elegantly and naturally: "Now I want to hear. What do you think of Wang Ling? For example, what can you detect from him when he is in the apartment?"</p>

    <p>These words made Sun Rong a little more vigilant.</p>

    <p>You Yueqing didn't know the true strength of Wang Ling. But she asked this question...Has she noticed something in Wang Ling?</p>

    <p>She was filled with doubts.</p>

    <p>After a moment of silence, Sun Rong said: "There was obviously something going on in that apartment. But Wang Ling said there was no problem."</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>You Yueqing nodded heavily and said: "Obviously he doesn't want us to participate in the investigation together. And he has discovered some clues in the apartment. But Wang Ling's strength is the same as ours. Why does he have the confidence to participate in the investigation alone?"</p>

    <p>This question made Sun Rong's throat roll involuntarily. And for the first time, she felt a sharp feeling emanating from You Yueqing's body from the inside out...</p>

    <p>She even suspected that You Yueqing might know something.</p>

    <p>She was hesitating on how to say this to You Yueqing.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, You Yueqing smiled slightly at this time: "I know. What you want to say, classmate Sun Rong. Or maybe you have noticed it, right?"</p>

    <p>"What did you notice?"</p>

    <p>"That is. Wang Ling is not an ordinary person."</p>

    <p>After You Yueqing finished speaking, Sun Rong's brows frowned slightly.</p>

    <p>This subtle expression was immediately caught by You Yueqing. After seeing the change in Sun Rong's expression, she further confirmed her thoughts: "Sure enough, you noticed it too. Although Wang Ling has always kept a low profile and hid it very well. But in fact, if you get closer to him, sooner or later you will find something unusual about him."</p>

    <p>"I don't know what Taoist Master You is talking about..."Sun Rong was confused by what You Yueqing said.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry. Classmate Sun Rong. I have no intention of telling anyone about Wang Ling. But now that I see you like this, I feel relieved a lot. You must have been helping him hide it. Right? Or even cover for him?"</p>

    <p>You Yueqing laughed: "I'm not stupid. Those birthday gifts Wang Ling gave me all have strange abilities. Just from this, I can tell that he is not an ordinary person. You should be the same as me. Right. Is it something you observe from the details?"</p>

    <p>"Um...yeah."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong said with an embarrassed face.</p>

    <p>The emotions in her heart were mixed and extremely complex.</p>

    <p>She never expected that You Yueqing could detect the hidden power of Wang Ling from the details...</p>

    <p>And she is completely different from You Yueqing.</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, Sun Rong's face couldn't help but glow slightly red.</p>

    <p>Because. Wang Ling's secret.</p>

    <p>In a sense, Wang Ling told her himself...</p>
