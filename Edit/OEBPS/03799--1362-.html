  <h1>Chapter 1362 Shadow Execution Song</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"There is actually a... clone with the same energy as my own body?"</p>

    <p>This was the first time Yang Shuangji had encountered such a thing. Strictly speaking, he felt that this was not a separation at all.</p>

    <p>However, Yang Shuangji seemed to gradually understand the specific principles of its use while dealing with several split bodies.</p>

    <p>These split people are all based on the original body. So as long as the main body is removed, the split body will automatically disappear.</p>

    <p>At this time, Yang Shuangji turned his gaze to Sun Ying'er in the void.</p>

    <p>He extended his right hand and said: "--Here comes the pestle!"</p>

    <p>A Buddha pestle with a purple-gold body and a ferocious beast engraved on its head came to his hand from the void through the layers of space walls.</p>

    <p>This is the "Shura Pestle" that Yang Shuangji is proud of.</p>

    <p>The ferocious beast on the head is the Buddhist prison-suppressing beast that suppresses the eighteen levels of hell.</p>

    <p>Although it is a Buddhist object, it has a very strong evil aura on it. Sun Ying'er's body has not yet come close. Just smelling the breath of Shura pestle, I can feel the illusion of void in front of me.</p>

    <p>Everything was dyed blood red. Even the water vapor in the air seemed to have turned into blood mist, making it difficult to breathe.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>"Senior, why does she look in pain?" Zhao Qingxian asked curiously in the core world. He didn't know what happened.</p>

    <p>From his own perspective, the sky is still blue and the clouds are white. Everything is normal.</p>

    <p>"This is the Asura Blood Phantom Array of the Asura Pestle. The more serious the killing karma, the harder it is for people to escape." Yang Shuangji sneered: "He was trapped by my Asura Pestle. He can't escape for the time being. Everything he saw in the illusion array It's all fake. And we are still in reality. Now we just need to walk in generously and take down the girl."</p>

    <p>"But who is this White Hair girl?"</p>

    <p>"It should be Miss Sun who refined her shadow into a magic weapon? Although I don't know how she did it. But it really surprised me a little. It's just a Foundation Building..."</p>

    <p>Before Yang Shuangji could finish his words, a shadow suddenly came out of the void and hit him hard on the right side of his face.</p>

    <p>Immediately afterwards, Yang Shuangji's entire face began to distort, and then he quickly flew backwards, collapsing a metal bridge pier in the distance, causing the entire bridge deck to collapse instantly.</p>

    <p>Although the movement was huge, Yang Shuangji himself did not seem to have suffered much trauma. After he climbed up from the rubble, he was surprised to find that Sun Ying'er in front of him had actually broken away from the illusion with his own strength.</p>

    <p>"Humph! I didn't expect that!" Sun Ying'er chuckled.</p>

    <p>The more serious the killing karma, the harder it is for people to escape?</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er smiled.</p>

    <p>She went from becoming a shadow to becoming the Lord of the Void to now. Although she has fought many people from the Office of Strategic Deception!</p>

    <p>But the problem is. She didn't kill anyone!</p>

    <p>Not only has he not committed any murder, but he is also forced to accept beatings from Wang Ying every day!</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er thought of this and almost cried out of grievance.</p>

    <p>In grief and anger, she almost immediately broke away from the illusion of the Shura pestle, and then gave Yang Shuangji in front of her a blow of the "Breaking Face Fist."</p>

    <p>Although the split body hit the right side of the face, the power of this punch was already sufficient.</p>

    <p>The damage from the backlash was fed back to the split body almost instantly, shattering the split body that took action.</p>

    <p>However, Yang Shuangji flew very far. However, such an explosive punch did not cause substantial damage to him.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er was slightly surprised. The person in front of her was much stronger than she imagined.</p>

    <p>"The sage of Buddhism?" she muttered.</p>

    <p>Just when the split body punched him, she saw a layer of protective Buddha light shining outside Yang Shuangji's body. Although it was only for a moment.</p>

    <p>But Sun Ying'er was sure that he was not wrong.</p>

    <p>In addition, the Shura pestle is now floating in the void.</p>

    <p>This is a powerful Buddhist anti-realm weapon!</p>

    <p>And what makes Sun Ying'er even more horrified is that the power of chaos flows inside. There is at least 5% of the power of chaos in it!</p>

    <p>Fortunately, her combat power is not low. Otherwise, it would just be pills.</p>

    <p>"I don't know how the little girl inside refined the shadow sacrifice into a magic weapon."</p>

    <p>But if you are willing to come with me. I can bypass your master's life, only robbing sex, not killing." Yang Shuangji said.</p>

    <p>"You, the supreme saint of Buddhism, even said such shameless words, I've really lived long enough to see that! You're not a fake monk, are you?" As Sun Ying'er listened to Yang Shuangji's words, she felt unimaginable and at the same time felt a bit amused: "Also, what makes you think that I'm a ritualized magic treasure?"</p>

    <p>She felt that the fake monk in front of her had an inexplicable arrogance, and it was the kind of arrogance that looked at the sky from a well... Although Sun Ying'er heard that before, monk Jin Deng was also extremely confident in his own strength. But at least he will reflect on it!</p>

    <p>They are also the sages of Buddhism. Why can the gap be so big?</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er felt that there was something strange about the man in front of her.</p>

    <p>If you say he is a fake monk, but the holy aura exuding from his whole body is real, just like monk Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>If he is a true monk...this kind of idea, which is even more perverted than Wang Ying's, would actually appear in the head of such a Buddhist sage. This is something Sun Ying'er cannot accept no matter what.</p>

    <p>"In that case, I will take down both of you, master and servant, today! A threesome might be more enjoyable..." Yang Shuangji licked his lips.</p>

    <p>He controlled the Asura Pestle, jumped up from a distance, and killed Sun Ying'er.</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Ying'er was still in deep shock.</p>

    <p>She thought Wang Ying was perverted enough.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, someone even more perverted came right now!</p>

    <p>Sure enough. There is no end to the realm of perversion...</p>

    <p>After such a comparison, Sun Ying'er suddenly felt that Wang Ying was much more normal than Yang Shuangji!</p>

    <p>At least Wang Ying just used the {Planet thumping technique} on her. Although it hurt her back, he didn't do anything else that crossed the line!</p>

    <p>Compared with Yang Shuangji. Wang Ying is simply a gentleman!</p>

    <p>"As long as I restrain you, your split body will disappear."</p>

    <p>At this time, Yang Shuangji's laughter grew closer and closer.</p>

    <p>His Asura pestle blossomed into full bloom at this moment. The blood-colored Buddha light shone thousands of miles away. It was extremely splendid, with natural majesty in the forest.</p>

    <p>Those split bodies were all suppressed to the ground. They were like nails sunk deep into the ground and unable to move.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the Shura pestle fell on Sun Ying'er's body to suppress it!</p>

    <p>The dense oppressive force trapped the careless girl!</p>

    <p>"It's all that damn Wang Ying's fault!"</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er was anxious. Her strength was limited by Wang Ying, which caused Yang Shuangji to gain the upper hand at this time.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, how could a mere Yang Shuangji be her opponent!</p>

    <p>Yang Shuangji had a lewd look on his face. His tongue was very long. When he threw himself in front of Sun Ying'er, he almost licked Sun Ying'er's face.</p>

    <p>But at this moment.</p>

    <p>A buzz!</p>

    <p>The huge black shadow covering the sky suddenly disappeared!</p>

    <p>The black shadow was like a tide. It rolled in from all directions and swept Sun Ying'er away in an instant.</p>

    <p>Yang Shuangji stuck out his tongue.</p>

    <p>In the end, I just felt lonely.</p>

    <p>At the critical moment, Sun Ying'er was rescued.</p>

    <p>She felt an overbearing force pulling her apart. And this force was something she was all too familiar with!</p>

    <p>That man showed up!</p>

    <p>He rescued her as if a god had appeared. Then he quickly involved Yang Shuangji into his core world.</p>

    <p>Here!</p>

    <p>It is the core world of Wang Ying!</p>

    <p>"Wang...Wang Ying..." Sun Ying'er almost cried.</p>

    <p>All kinds of complicated emotions were intertwined in my heart. I was a little moved. But most of all, I was disgusted by the tongue that Yang Shuangji just stuck out.</p>

    <p>"Who are you again?"</p>

    <p>Facing the man who suddenly appeared, Yang Shuangji was depressed because he had not succeeded just now.</p>

    <p>"Touch my people?" Wang Ying frowned.</p>

    <p>He stood with his hands behind his back. He didn't even move his fingers.</p>

    <p>The countless shadows in the core world turned into tens of thousands of shapes and attacked and killed them instantly!</p>

    <p>"You..." Yang Shuangji's eyes showed horror. This power was too frightening. Moreover, the proud Shura pestle in his hand was snatched away by these strips of shadow. It was swallowed up in an instant!</p>

    <p>That was a confident magic weapon that he was proud of...</p>

    <p>Now that it was taken away, Yang Shuangji instantly lost most of his sense of security.</p>

    <p>The countless strips rolled up from all directions, grabbing Yang Shuangji's limbs and wrapping him tightly.</p>

    <p>"No!" Yang Shuangji shouted, burning his own essence and blood, wanting to fight.</p>

    <p>However, all this is in vain.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying's speed was too fast. His figure was as ghostly as a ghost. In an instant, he appeared in front of Yang Shuangji. He stretched out his hand and strangled his neck.</p>

    <p>Yang Shuangji was pinched so much that it hurt. The tongue in his mouth was forced out by Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying said nothing.</p>

    <p>All I could hear was a "chi!" sound!</p>

    <p>He controlled the strip of shadow around him and pulled out Yang Shuangji's entire tongue.</p>

    <p>However. For Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>All this. But it's just the beginning.</p>

    <p>"You have moved. Where?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ying stared at Yang Shuangji with dark eyes.</p>

    <p>He began to torture at his own pace.</p>

    <p>In the core world, Yang Shuangji's screams kept coming...</p>

    <p>At this time.</p>

    <p>This is unique to Wang Ying. Shadow execution song.</p>
