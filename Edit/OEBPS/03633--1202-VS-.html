  <h1>Chapter 1202 Chen Chao VS Zhu Hanyun</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The duel draw is completed. The one-on-one contest officially begins. There are no other bells and whistles in the duel rules, because everyone has a protective golden talisman. As long as the life-saving effect of the protective golden talisman can be triggered, then the game is considered a victory.</p>

    <p>At this moment, there are only 12 people left on Dome Mountain. But counting the members of the special forces patrolling nearby, the commanders of the command center, the principals of each school, and the netizens who have been following the live broadcast room for several days, there are a total of 12 people. Hundreds of millions of people are watching this national gymnastics competition.</p>

    <p>The main reason why it can arouse such a large-scale attention and discussion is because this is a competition co-organized by Huaxiu Alliance and the most popular sect war and neglect bureau in the world. And the student who can survive to the last day is probably the one today. Jiaochu is one of the senior high school students in the Foundation Building of the Cultivation World. This has important reference significance for most parents in the Cultivation World when choosing schools in the future.</p>

    <p>The first round matchup was between Zhu Hanyun from Titan High School and Chen Chao. The contest between the two muscular men seemed to be particularly interesting in this situation.</p>

    <p>However, Guo Hao was not optimistic about the outcome of the battle: "Zhu Hanyun is the captain of Titan High School. Although he is physically exhausted, can Chen Chao win?" First of all, Zhu Hanyun's {Titan Kung Fu} is good. It is already very difficult. Even if Chen Chao uses his spiritual sword to cut through the muscle density beyond that of ordinary people, it may not be able to penetrate it.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is. Now this is a one-on-one duel on the surface. Originally, the spirit sword was used in a chaotic survival situation. It can be used as a one-on-one fair duel. This made everyone's thoughts return. I can't help but return to the original theme of this national competition: physical skills.</p>

    <p>If you still use the spirit sword in this situation, you will most likely be charged with a shameless crime that cannot be defeated.</p>

    <p>He cannot use spirit swords and relies solely on physical skills to fight. Zhu Hanyun, who has practiced the Titan Technique and is famous for his physical skills, almost has a natural advantage.</p>

    <p>However, knowing this, Chen Chao will also fight in this battle.</p>

    <p>He is not a timid person. As a descendant of the Richao Budokan, Chen Chao knows that his father must also be paying attention to this game.</p>

    <p>Looking at Zhu Hanyun who seemed to be extremely powerful in front of him, Chen Chao felt a little bitter, but his concentration was also raised to the extreme. Of course he knew how powerful Zhu Hanyun was. The opponent was in the first round. At that time, he used his power to transcend the ordinary Foundation Building stage. He turned himself into a cannon and launched the students of his school from the ground to the top of the tower one by one.</p>

    <p>A total of 700,000 steps. Just jump over them.</p>

    <p>This shocked Chen Chao greatly at the time.</p>

    <p>While Chen Chao was thinking, Guo Hao's voice suddenly came from the court: "Chen Chao. Don't you like this kind of muscular man the most? Give him a hard time.! Who is afraid of whom? Forget it. Even if you can't win, you'll kill him!"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao looked helpless.</p>

    <p>Utilitarian milk is not advisable. Wang Ling also understands this very well. Chen Chao's open mouth can only be accurate when he speaks without any distracting thoughts.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Zhu Hanyun, who is also a muscle brother, seemed to be particularly enthusiastic about the word "breasts." The expression on his face gradually became excited: "Classmate Chen Chao, you want to breastfeed me? What a pity! Your breasts don't have mine." So big!"</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Zhu Han Yun punched Chen Chao from the spot like a cannonball. The realm between the two was the peak of the late Foundation Building. The gap in realm was zero. But in terms of skills, The advantages cannot be ignored.</p>

    <p>I wish Han Yun's punch both strength and speed are actually above the peak level of Foundation Building in the later period. It is almost infinitely close to the power of Golden Core in the early stage!</p>

    <p>Any student of the same level might not be able to see the power of this punch! What's more, this is not an ordinary punch!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling can see that Zhu Hanyun's punch showed a wind and thunder entanglement during the impact. According to the backward calculation of the Heavenly Dao spell, Zhu Hanyun's punch should be a skill called Wang Ling Feng Lei Zhen}'s third-level boxing-like spiritual skill.</p>

    <p>It is amazing that a student in the Foundation Building stage can learn third-level spiritual skills. Although Zhu Hanyun seems to have just started.</p>

    <p>However, this can still have a huge blessing effect on the power of ordinary physical punches. In a moment, the punch has arrived in front of Chen Chao. To everyone's surprise, Chen Chao did not dodge at all. His eyes were fixed on him. Zhu Hanyun's boxing path. Just when his fist was about to approach him, he suddenly measured his body position and used Qiao Jin's power to strike Zhu Hanyun's flank while turning sideways.</p>

    <p>"This is...a pusher?"</p>

    <p>Command center. The principals looked at this scene.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao's pushing move was simple and unpretentious, with almost no modifications. However, Zhu Hanyun's extremely powerful blow seemed to hit a ball of cotton heavily.</p>

    <p>"It's interesting. I actually thought of using four ounces of strength to deal with it." Huang Lao nodded in approval. He could see clearly here.</p>

    <p>I wish Han Yun's punching speed is extremely fast. It is difficult to catch in the general Foundation Building stage. Push hands is not a complicated skill. However, unless it is applied in actual combat after years of hard training, it will be difficult to deal with the enemy. This is different from those who learn Just like those who think they have actual combat ability after acquiring a set of {Military Boxing}...learning and practicing are two different things.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao can make quick judgments in such a short period of time. This kind of reaction ability can only be acquired after years of accumulation.</p>

    <p>However, praise is praise. The outcome of this battle is still unpredictable in Huang Lao's opinion.</p>

    <p>He could tell that Chen Chao had a lot of combat experience. This may be because Chen Chao grew up in a martial arts gym run by his family. The more he watched, learned more, and practiced more, he would naturally become more powerful. Ordinary people have richer practical experience.</p>

    <p>But the opponent is the captain of Taitan High School. If he just wants to defeat the enemy with one push hand move, he would be underestimating Zhu Hanyun.</p>

    <p>Although the first move failed, Zhu Hanyun was not discouraged. Instead, he became more courageous as he fought.</p>

    <p>After predicting that Chen Chao would play a trick with him, Zhu Han Yun also quickly changed his boxing style.</p>

    <p>If the initial [Feng Lei Zhen] was about explosive power, then the second set of boxing techniques [Huan Yu Liu] used by Zhu Han Yun now relies on attack speed.</p>

    <p>Pushing hands with a weight of four or two pounds may have an unexpected effect in the face of explosive boxing. However, now Zhu Hanyun has transformed himself into an attack speed flow. Under such dense blows like raindrops, even if Chen Chao knows pushing hands, it will be of no avail.</p>

    <p>A sound like heavy rain rustled from the field. Every punch of Zhu Han Yun hit Chen Chao's body firmly...</p>

    <p>"Are you going to lose?" Everyone at Number 60 High School looked nervous.</p>

    <p>After the first round of attack, Chen Chao was beaten with bruises all over his face. He even lost one of his teeth. It looked like he had suffered extremely serious injuries.</p>

    <p>But to everyone's surprise, Chen Chao's golden protective talisman was not triggered.</p>

    <p>Under such an astonishing attack, the life-saving effect has not yet been triggered?</p>

    <p>Everyone was stunned.</p>

    <p>As long as the golden protective talisman is not triggered, it means that Chen Chao can continue to fight... This man's resilience even exceeds his opponent Zhu Hanyun's expectations.</p>
