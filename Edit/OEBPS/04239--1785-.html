  <h1>Chapter 1785 Death of Meili</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Akoran Society. The largest local mafia organization in Glio City. It is engaged in a variety of illegal activities and has several extremely mature mercenary groups under its control. It signs contracts and cooperates all year round.</p>

    <p>Meili, who fell into the septic tank and died, was a member of the Chilan Society.</p>

    <p>Just before the Huaguo Shuilian Group acquired the Volute Hotel chain, the former owner of the Volute was regularly submitting safety management funds to the Chilan Society in order to maintain order and stability in the hotel.</p>

    <p>In layman's terms, it is protection money.</p>

    <p>But now that the Huaguo Shuilian Group has taken over, Chilanhui has lost a channel through which it can collect large amounts of funds without taking risks.</p>

    <p>Of course, the Chilan Society would not give up. They decided to send a team leader named Meili from the Chilan Society to find trouble before causing a big fuss. This was considered as an advance warning.</p>

    <p>And the president of the Chilan Society is also betting.</p>

    <p>He is betting that if he makes such a fuss, if Sun Rong is afraid, she will definitely continue to pay the protection fee like the previous owner of the volute. And he can continue to enjoy this dividend without any effort.</p>

    <p>However, what Levi's, the president of the Chilan Society, didn't expect was that Meili actually died...</p>

    <p>And it has nothing to do with the volute.</p>

    <p>At least not on the surface.</p>

    <p>The scene captured by the surveillance camera clearly captured the scene of Meili walking out of the hotel cursing. Because he didn't look at the road, he was loaded into the sewer by a truck and fell into the septic tank...</p>

    <p>Levis, the president of the Chilan Society, was trembling all over when he saw this scene.</p>

    <p>"President...Team Leader Meili. Is it really hopeless? He is a late-stage Golden Core..." A female secretary next to Levi asked fearfully.</p>

    <p>"The Golden Core stage is useless. In our Glio City, the average level of cultivators is at the early Golden Core stage. The quality of cultivators is very high. The pollutants in the septic tank are all toxins discharged by cultivators at or above the Golden Core stage. It's hard for Meili to survive when surrounded by so many mixed toxins..." Levis said this. Even he felt a little nauseous.</p>

    <p>Such a way of death has never been seen before. It cannot be said that it is not tragic.</p>

    <p>This group of people are too courageous...</p>

    <p>I just took over and came to Glio City. How dare you plan such a sophisticated murder!</p>

    <p>Levis was a little confused.</p>

    <p>Who is it? The evil force...</p>

    <p>"President. Could this be just a coincidence?"</p>

    <p>"It can't be a coincidence!"</p>

    <p>Levis shook his head, "Obviously... this is a provocation. Huaguo Shuilian Group + Office of Strategic Deception. Their intelligence gathering capabilities must not be weak. They must have already known that Meili is a member of our Chilan Society. Now that they already know his identity despite the situation, they still planned this extremely sophisticated murder... their courage is really extraordinary."</p>

    <p>While speaking, Levis frowned. Sun Rong gave him a kick as soon as she arrived in Glio City. This forced Levis to rethink his strategy.</p>

    <p>He knows very well that today's opponents are different from those in the past.</p>

    <p>Just half a year ago, the Shadow Stream Killer Organization was at its peak. It was because of provoking the Huaguo Shuilian Group. In the end, the entire organization was targeted and destroyed... Therefore, we must be extra cautious and careful.</p>

    <p>At this time, the female secretary saw Levis flipping through the files about Shadow Stream. She couldn't help but ask, "President, what are you worried about?"</p>

    <p>"Of course we are worried. We may repeat the mistakes of the Shadow Stream." Levis said, "Although regarding the Shadow Stream, the official statement shows that the person who destroyed this organization is the one who recently became famous in Huaxiu Country Zhuo Yi ."</p>

    <p>"The person who prevented Thuntihan Ha from landing six years ago?"</p>

    <p>"It's him." Levi frowned and said, "But I have an intuition. I feel that he is taking this for someone. Of course, these are all my guesses..."</p>

    <p>Just as he was talking to his secretary, there was a rapid knock on the door.</p>

    <p>"Come in," Levis said.</p>

    <p>A security guard wearing a black suit pushed open the door and entered, "President, a nun named Alley is looking for you. She said she has something important to discuss with you."</p>

    <p>"Nun? From which church?"</p>

    <p>"St. Pete."</p>

    <p>"Ask her to come in."</p>

    <p>"yes..."</p>

    <p>The security personnel quietly retreated after responding. Less than two minutes passed. A graceful woman with a veil on her face and a black church robe entered from the door.</p>

    <p>This nun named Alley does not look very old. She is about the age of a high school student. She has a very iconic tear mole in the corner of her eye.</p>

    <p>But her movements reveal a sense of stability and mystery, which seems to be very different from her apparent age.</p>

    <p>"Hello, President Levi. I am Sister Alley of St. Peter's Cathedral. I am here this time to discuss something with you," Alley said.</p>

    <p>"I remember that our Chilan Club has never interacted with St. Peter."</p>

    <p>Levis stared at Alley and said, "And where I am now is considered one of the secrets of the Chilan Society. How did you know I'm here?"</p>

    <p>With that said, Levi stood up and lit the cigar in his hand. After taking a deep breath, he looked at the nun in front of him and said, "There is only one possibility. You are not here to represent St. Peter."</p>

    <p>"Oh? What President Levi said does have some meaning."</p>

    <p>"No need to pretend in front of me."</p>

    <p>Levis waved his hand and said with a smile, "You are a Tengu. Am I right? Apart from the Tengu, I am afraid no one can have such intelligence capabilities. St. Pete is just your cloak. You are working hard for the Tengu."</p>

    <p>"As expected of the president of the Chilan Society."</p>

    <p>The nun named Alley smiled.</p>

    <p>"You Tengu are also interesting. In the past, you were just a wolf hiding. Why are you starting to show your cards now? Are you not afraid of being hunted down?"</p>

    <p>"The enemies are different. We will naturally change our strategies."</p>

    <p>Alley smiled and said, "I am here this time on behalf of the Tengu side to offer advice to President Levi. We have just received information that President Levi has lost a subordinate named Meili."</p>

    <p>"That's what happened." Levis nodded.</p>

    <p>"To be honest, Chairman Levi, we Tengu are currently looking for opportunities to target the Huaguo Shuilian Group and the Office of Strategic Deception. Your subordinate died. We are deeply sorry. But in fact, your subordinate has created value for this matter." Alley said.</p>

    <p>"Go on." Levi's became more interested.</p>

    <p>"It's very simple. Mr. Levis, the top priority now is to restrict these people from the Huaguo Shuilian Group from leaving the country."</p>

    <p>Sister Alley said, "According to Mixiu Country's entry and exit management regulations, anyone who is accused within the country is not allowed to leave Mixiu Country's territory. Of course, the other party may be able to use the teleportation array to escape. But if they escape, it will prove that there is something wrong in their hearts. So they had to stay. Set the record straight."</p>

    <p>"You mean. Confining them all to Glio City?"</p>

    <p>Levis smiled and nodded, "That's interesting. Glio City is our territory. As long as we can keep them here, it's all our business how to deal with it next. If we let them go like this, it will be counterproductive. It's not easy to deal with."</p>

    <p>"That's what I mean." Alley nodded.</p>

    <p>"But I hear what you mean. You want me to sue for murder. But the legal team of the Huaguo Shuilian Group are no slouches."</p>

    <p>"President Li, don't worry about this. We have already found the truck driver's information."</p>

    <p>Alley said, "As long as it is confirmed that the truck driver was hired by their Huaguo Shuilian Group, he will be found guilty of murder, and that Ms. Sun will be detained in the city of Grio as a bargaining chip for us to negotiate with the Office of Strategic Deception's..."</p>
