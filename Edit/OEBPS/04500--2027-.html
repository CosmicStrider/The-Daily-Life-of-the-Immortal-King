  <h1>Chapter 2027 The female monk who stole the magic weapon</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After all, he had found his partner in this way back then. Therefore, Sun Yiyuan understood the intention of Sun Rong's move almost instantly.</p>

    <p>He is worthy of being a descendant of his Sun family. He is indeed a vigorous and resolute activist!</p>

    <p>While diving into the seabed, Sun Yiyuan couldn't help but feel happy.</p>

    <p>But he also knew very well. Even if Sun Rong already knew that the ancestors of the Sun family were hidden in the belly of the spirit whale, it would not be easy to find the senior spirit whale...</p>

    <p>Yes. That spirit whale lived an unusually long time. Even Sun Yiyuan would be called a senior.</p>

    <p>It wasn't just him. When he succeeded as the head of the family, even Sun Yiyuan's own father, Sun Rong's great-great-grandfather, also respected the spirit whale and addressed him as a senior.</p>

    <p>Although Sun Yiyuan understood his granddaughter's thoughts very well, everything still had to be carried out according to the clan rules. Going to look for the senior spirit whale so recklessly might disturb the senior's cultivation.</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, Sun Yiyuan couldn't help but speed up his actions. When he dived more than 3,000 meters to the bottom of the sea, the huge water pressure had already begun to cause a slight discomfort in his body.</p>

    <p>Human cultivators are not creatures that grew up in the ocean. There are also limits to diving into the seabed with one's own cultivation. In addition, the principle of elemental spiritual roots is mutually reinforcing and mutually restraining. If cultivators with water spiritual roots are not sealed in the sea for a long time, even if their cultivation is No matter how high it is, it is normal to feel discomfort.</p>

    <p>However, the spiritual power signals of Wang Ling and Sun Rong were still further down. Therefore, Sun Yiyuan immediately understood. Sun Rong probably used the submarine hidden on his body to dive. to such a deep position.</p>

    <p>"It's too dangerous. Rongrong..."</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan is a well-known protector. After all, the depths of the ocean are full of dangers. No one knows what will happen. If the submarine breaks down and is trapped in the deep sea, it will be troublesome!</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, Sun Yiyuan frowned slightly and took out a conch directly from the storage bag.</p>

    <p>This was given to him by Grandma Sun once in the sect.</p>

    <p>In Sun Yiyuan's time, a complete modern cultivation education system had not yet been formed.</p>

    <p>At that time, cultivation education was almost always conducted in local sects assigned by the government.</p>

    <p>Unified recruitment. Then fill in the sect application according to the scores. But it does not mean that you can enter the sect if you have enough scores.</p>

    <p>After the assessment score reaches the standard, the first thing to enter the sect is a personal file.</p>

    <p>Then each major sect will carefully review the archive materials to confirm whether the disciples in the archives conform to the sect's practice philosophy.</p>

    <p>This is also to better match resources according to talents. It is to avoid a situation like a cultivator who practices water law entering a sect that specializes in fire law.</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan remembered having lunch shortly after entering the sect.</p>

    <p>In order to occupy a seat in advance, he placed a magic weapon for sound transmission on the seat. However, a female monk from the same sect took it away directly...</p>

    <p>Taking it without asking is plagiarism.</p>

    <p>At that time, Sun Yiyuan felt a little annoyed.</p>

    <p>The most important thing is that the female monk was not only unreasonable, but also published his story on the sect's wall of voice in an exaggerated manner.</p>

    <p>"The senior brother who took my seat in the sect cafeteria today. I took your magic weapon with me when I was sorting things. After all, you are sitting in my seat. The sound transmission magic weapons issued by the sect are all the same. Neither do I. I know if this is mine."</p>

    <p>"I found out when I went back and took a look. Oh, it turns out I have two. I'm too lazy to scold you. I didn't mean to target you. But it's disgusting for you to sit in someone else's seat. Don't embarrass our sect. If you want something, you can get it yourself. Don't beat me up when the time comes and say I stole your stuff."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>If someone hadn't come forward to speak out in the end, I'm afraid Sun Yiyuan's life in the sect would not have been easy.</p>

    <p>At that time, the first person to stand up and speak for Sun Yiyuan was Grandma Sun.</p>

    <p>She not only reprimanded the behavior of the fellow junior sister and helped him get the magic weapon back. She also redeemed all her sect points as the sect's chief inner disciple and gave him a conch magic weapon.</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan will never forget what Grandma Sun said to him when he was young at that time.</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry, Junior Brother Sun. My junior sister in the same group is very reckless. I apologize to you on her behalf."</p>

    <p>There is no harm without comparison.</p>

    <p>It was almost the first time in my life that I met Sun Yiyuan, a woman who was so gentle, dignified, generous and graceful.</p>

    <p>That's when he made up his mind.</p>

    <p>In this life of my own, it must be her...</p>

    <p>His thoughts returned. Sun Yiyuan injected spiritual power into the conch. The conch, which was as big as the palm of his hand, instantly grew larger after being activated by injecting spiritual power. It emitted a protective golden light, covering him tightly.</p>

    <p>Now I feel better...</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan suddenly felt comfortable in his heart. He felt as if his wife was always caressing him and accompanying him.</p>

    <p>"Rongrong. Grandpa is coming to find you right now..."</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan said in his heart. Then he kicked off his legs and accelerated his dive again.</p>

    <p>It is actually not impossible to enter the ancestral land. However, the procedures must be followed.</p>

    <p>And it wouldn't be good to search for it like this. It would disturb the senior spirit whale's rest.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Mingyue Ye woke up. But the world in front of him made him a little confused for a short time.</p>

    <p>He remembered that he was eating a kind of rare natural coral as a healing tonic... It was a coral island he accidentally discovered. Just when he was eating happily, a huge wave suddenly hit him...</p>

    <p>Wrong!</p>

    <p>It wasn't a huge wave... He seemed to have been swallowed by a huge whale...</p>

    <p>In other words, the place where I am now is in the belly of this whale?</p>

    <p>After Mingyue Ye recalled everything, the daze in her heart turned into infinite shock.</p>

    <p>Because he never thought that based on the level of spiritual beasts existing on earth, there would actually be spiritual beasts that could form a world of their own in their own bodies...</p>

    <p>Although he was sure that he was in the belly of this spiritual whale, the endless mountains and lush jungles in front of him told him that this spiritual whale had become a world of its own in its body.</p>

    <p>Mingyue Ye immediately sat cross-legged and adjusted his breathing. After being forced to become the weapon spirit of the wand, his strength was still damaged. He needed to find a shortcut to recover as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>Therefore, he had to swallow a large amount of heavenly materials and earthly treasures to increase the strength of this wand. The stronger the wand, the stronger the weapon spirit.</p>

    <p>"God help me!"</p>

    <p>After sitting cross-legged for a moment, Mingyue Ye opened her eyes in surprise.</p>

    <p>He could sense that in the world in front of him, there might be huge benefits hidden that he could not imagine! This is a rich mine. There are countless heavenly materials and earthly treasures in it. If these heavenly materials and earthly treasures can be collected here, Devouring all the treasures... His strength may be even more powerful than in human form!</p>

    <p>There is no end to the road...</p>

    <p>The bright moonlit night burst into laughter.</p>

    <p>Then he didn't think much and took a flying step, following the road in front of him and entering the Sun Family Mountains.</p>
