  <h1>Chapter 1822 Kick on the iron plate</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The situation was reversed in an instant. When the Uzumaki Emperor who originally had the upper hand suddenly fell into a disadvantage, Jiuyun felt it almost instantly.</p>

    <p>Obviously, Lawen's pressure failed. The master hidden in Number 60 High School was not forced out. So now she has no choice but to do it himself.</p>

    <p>The iron prison of yin and yang. At this time, Jiuyun stared at Wang Muyu in front of him. He knew that this was the best goal. If he wanted to hook out the hidden master... he had to wrong the child first.</p>

    <p>He opened his hand. A golden spiritual pattern spread out from the palm of his hand like ripples. Then it slowly spread towards Wang Muyu's position.</p>

    <p>As members of the Heavenly Dao Alliance, what they are best at is not just the marksmanship when using the "Heavenly Dao Gun." Mind control spells are the skills that people in the Heavenly Dao Alliance major in.</p>

    <p>Jiuyun had performed this {Mind-Taking Technique} very carefully. It was a diluted version of the spell. He did not use all his strength.</p>

    <p>This is a spell that can achieve mind control in a short period of time. However, Jiuyun still kept his hand when the person he was facing was a child. If he had used the undiluted version directly, Wang Muyu might have had strong sequelae after the spell was lifted.</p>

    <p>However, what Jiuyun didn't expect was that he had obviously successfully used his mental telepathy skills, but the spiritual connection with Wang Muyu had not really been established.</p>

    <p>"strangeness..."</p>

    <p>He was quite surprised. Even if it was a diluted version, it was just a child. How could the control fail?</p>

    <p>Jiuyun frowned. Golden ripples surged in his palm. Without hesitation, he increased his efforts in an attempt to control Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>In the next second, he felt his mind telepathy reflected back by a force. At the same time, an illusion appeared in his mind. When he came to his senses, he and Wang Muyu were no longer in the previous space.</p>

    <p>It's the soul that has been moved!</p>

    <p>Jiuyun reacted immediately. At the same time, he broke out in cold sweat. He never thought that Wang Muyu had such a skill... He was not an ordinary primary school student!</p>

    <p>In just a short moment, he transferred his soul to a new space. This method... very few people can do.</p>

    <p>Not only that. Jiuyun also realized that the space he was in was very extraordinary. The terrifying secret power of dragon's breath was flowing. It made people feel as if they were witnessing a pilgrimage of ten thousand dragons.</p>

    <p>Roar!</p>

    <p>A huge dragon shadow appeared in the sky, looking down at the earth.</p>

    <p>This is the spirit of Dharma derived from Wang Muyu. It is so majestic that it cannot be compared to others.</p>

    <p>"Who are you..." Jiuyun was completely shocked. He underestimated Wang Muyu. At the same time, he felt extremely incredible about this "truth." They spent so much effort to investigate who among the six people in Number 60 High School was a hidden master.</p>

    <p>In the end, he never expected that the elementary school student in front of him was the hidden boss.</p>

    <p>Is he an Eternal One?</p>

    <p>Jiuyun frowned. If he were the Eternal One, I'm afraid Wang Muyu would still be the top one. Because of the difference in strength, he had already felt it, and it was obvious.</p>

    <p>Damn...</p>

    <p>At the same time, Jiuyun also found that his body could no longer move.</p>

    <p>In the distance, there was the sound of a dragon roaring, as if it was a sound coming from another shore.</p>

    <p>At this time, deep in Wang Muyu's core world, Jiuyun's soul was shaking. The dragon shadow flashing with colored glaze on the sky was too huge. It was just a blurry shadow. It made people breathless.</p>

    <p>"What on earth are you..." Jiuyun stared at this scene. He felt that his spirit had completely collapsed. He could not imagine Wang Muyu's true identity at all, although he already had some guesses in his mind.</p>

    <p>"As you can see, I am a dragon." Wang Muyu said, without concealing anything.</p>

    <p>He moved Jiuyun's soul to the core world. He was not afraid that Jiuyun would tell him later. Because he determined that Jiuyun would be mentally abnormal after leaving. At the same time, he would be too frightened and forget what happened in the core world.</p>

    <p>"Ha..." Jiuyun was dumbfounded. His knees couldn't bear the fear at all and he collapsed on the spot.</p>

    <p>Dragon?</p>

    <p>What a joke...</p>

    <p>That is an eternal creature that has become extinct. It only appears in legends. In today's world of cultivation, it is impossible for dragons to survive in the world.</p>

    <p>At this time, Jiuyun was completely dumbfounded when Wang Muyu revealed his identity.</p>

    <p>In other words, what he faced was not actually the Eternal One, but a dragon in human form...</p>

    <p>He felt like he was dreaming. It felt very unreal.</p>

    <p>"It turns out that you are the mastermind behind this..." Jiuyun's voice trembled. He couldn't believe this ending. He thought that the Heavenly Dao Alliance had a guaranteed victory in this battle.</p>

    <p>As a result, he didn't expect that a little dragon man would beat him up halfway.</p>

    <p>"The person behind the scenes?" Wang Muyu narrowed his eyes and smiled after hearing Jiu Yun's words: "How can I have such ability?"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Jiuyun became even more horrified: "Since you are not the mastermind behind the scenes, that means...you are under the control of others?"</p>

    <p>This question made Wang Muyu think about it carefully. Then he answered cautiously: "Control is out of the question. Now we have a separate relationship. He calls me brother, and I call him dad."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>The corners of Jiuyun's mouth twitched.</p>

    <p>What and what is this!</p>

    <p>"Since you are a dragon...how can you recognize an Earthling..."</p>

    <p>"What's wrong with the people on Earth? Don't look down on the people on Earth. Not all people on Earth are the same as you." Wang Muyu retorted with an unhappy expression.</p>

    <p>He looked at Jiuyun and shrugged: "I thought that even if you were not as good as I thought, you would at least be a qualified opponent. But I already noticed it when I was locked in the cage. You didn't even get a passing grade. None. It makes me very disappointed. If it weren't for daddy also participating in this competition, it would never be my turn to take action in a battle of this level."</p>

    <p>Hearing these words, Jiuyun's face turned slightly red. He felt so ashamed that he wanted to find a hole to burrow into. His body trembled slightly. There was a kind of suppressed anger: "Don't go too far...this earth. After all, it is still the earth of earthly cultivators... It is not your turn, alien beings, to comment on human cultivators here."</p>

    <p>"Correction. What I just said was not a comment. It was just plain contempt."</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu smiled.</p>

    <p>On this earth. Except for Wang Ling, Sun Rong, Wang Nuan and the earthlings related to these three people, Wang Muyu had no intention of taking the rest of the earthlings into consideration from the beginning.</p>

    <p>At this time, Jiuyun stared at Wang Muyu. His eyes were a bit cunning: "Don't be so arrogant that you are invincible... There are people outside..."</p>

    <p>"That's it. You should have told me earlier. I can give you a chance to ask for help off the court." Wang Muyu didn't pay attention to Jiuyun's trump card at all.</p>

    <p>Then he restrained the aura of the core world and gave Jiuyun a chance to breathe: "Come on, call out your trump card. Let me see what kind of thing you are."</p>
