  <h1>Can the Forbidden Forest in Chapter 2009 Office of Strategic Deception get a golden echo?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: After listening to what Zhuo Yi said. Wang Ling was even a little touched in his heart. This apprentice was not in vain. Zhuo Yi was quite reliable at the critical moment.</p>

    <p>Of course. Wang Ling does not mean to blame Zhenyuan. After all, it is normal for a person to have uncontrollable admiration for other people and things.</p>

    <p>And for Wang Ling, perhaps his only emotion that is not difficult to understand is admiration.</p>

    <p>After all, he once admired the inventor of crispy noodles...</p>

    <p>Is this kind of delicacy that can be enjoyed even if you crush something broken? Is this something that can exist normally in the human world?</p>

    <p>Although in the eyes of the world, this is just ordinary puffed food and junk snacks, in Wang Ling's heart, the instant noodles will always be a god. It is the childhood that has accompanied him since he was a child. It is the one he has seen so far. A neatly arranged set card can still evoke beautiful memories. It is something that no other snack can replace so far.</p>

    <p>Retracting the topic. Everyone was walking in the forest talking and laughing. The concentration of spiritual energy here is shockingly terrifying. Not only because of the spirit gathering array underneath, but the key reason is because the entrance to the secret realm of the Mountain of Recall is hidden in the forest.</p>

    <p>Such majestic and astonishing spiritual energy seeps out from the Mountain of Recall. Its influence directly covers the entire forest, and even radiates the entire Office of Strategic Deception. Among them, the mysterious forbidden forest is the most critical.</p>

    <p>"You said we keep walking here. Can we get the golden echo?" Halfway through, Guo Hao suddenly asked a very silly question.</p>

    <p>As senior game geeks like Chen Chao, the two of them always discuss game-related topics the most passionately. Sometimes Wang Ling knows something about games. It is also through Chen Chao and Information that Guo Hao knew.</p>

    <p>For Wang Ling who doesn't play games very much. Sometimes when I hear news about game information, I feel like I am out of touch with the times. I feel like I am alone.</p>

    <p>"You think this is playing Harry Potter... I don't know if there are any echoes. But maybe there is a Whomping Willow in this mysterious Forbidden Forest?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Everyone fell silent again.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw Zhuo Yi's expression and immediately raised his forehead again.</p>

    <p>"Zhuo Yi Senior. What's going on? Is there really a Whomping Willow?" Sun Rong was also shocked. He asked Zhuo Yi directly in the team's voice transmission.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi covered his face with one hand. He couldn't laugh or cry: "There is no Whomping Willow. But there is a Whomping Pine... I heard that it is a creature created by the Immortal people of Zhenyuan. It was originally transplanted on Drought Star. It was used for experiments. Later it was discovered that these pine trees had a certain defensive effect. At the same time, for the safety of the Mountain of Recall, many were arranged around the entrance to the secret realm."</p>

    <p>"In other words, when we go to the secret realm, we will also encounter these..."</p>

    <p>"Yes." Zhuo Yi nodded: "But please don't worry, everyone. I have asked Zhenyuan Immortal people to enter the secret command a long time ago. I have shown the photos to the Beating Pine. When we people enter the secret realm, the Beating Pine is I won't take action."</p>

    <p>How can it still be like this...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling complained secretly in his heart.</p>

    <p>He used King's Eyes to detect the forest terrain. It turned out that this was indeed the case.</p>

    <p>The God's perspective provided by King's Eyes directly gives a panoramic view of the entire forest. The entrance to the secret realm of the Mountain of Recall that they want to go to is deep in the forest. To get there, you need to pass six encrypted teleportation methods. Array.</p>

    <p>Because there is a flight restriction over the forest. If you walk with a sword, you will be immediately blocked by the barrier. And it is impossible to find the entrance to the Mountain of Retrospection just by walking.</p>

    <p>Even the teleportation array is specially encrypted. It will automatically change its position in the shallow layer of the forest every once in a while.</p>

    <p>Only core members can know the location of the magic circle. You only need to ask Lord Diulei or Zhenyuan Immortal for the coordinates of the six encrypted magic circles when applying to use the Mountain of Retrospection.</p>

    <p>Of course. Even if a blind cat encounters a dead mouse and misleads six magic circles, it still has to go through the level of beating people...</p>

    <p>These beating pines are because they are creatures specially created by the Zhenyuan Immortal people for defense. Even Wang Ling thinks there is something special about them.</p>

    <p>Just by looking at it, I feel like it might hurt if I hit someone. If I were to walk over here unprepared, I might be stabbed like a hedgehog...</p>

    <p>Of course. Wang Ling In fact, there are roads that can change directions freely inside the forest. In other words, you can actually drive into the forest.</p>

    <p>But he soon understood Zhuo Yi's intention in arranging this walk...</p>

    <p>Because just as they passed through a forest stream in front of them, everyone spotted a muscular man with a sturdy back and a wild hairstyle. His arms were as thick as human thighs and had dragon patterns printed on them. He was sitting on a big rock to rest in a meditative posture.</p>

    <p>This person is none other than the one whom Lord Diulei named as his disciple before. Master Canglong.</p>

    <p>Next to Master Canglong, a middle-aged man who looked honest and honest, with dimples on his fleshy face, started cooking forest delicacies in a large iron pot. At the same time, he was live broadcasting on his mobile phone.</p>

    <p>And this person is Liu Yong whom Wang Ling met before. His mantra: clean and hygienic.</p>

    <p>That's right. Zhuo Yi's purpose in arranging this walk in the forest. In fact, it was to arrange apprenticeships for Chen Chao and Guo Hao.</p>

    <p>In order for the apprenticeship to proceed smoothly, Zhuo Yi has made full preparations in advance in the past few days. Crazyly pushing news information about Master Canglong and Master Liu Yong to Chen Chao and Guo Hao's mobile phones respectively.</p>

    <p>So that the two of them can truly understand the strengths and awesomeness of these two people.</p>

    <p>Of course. All news information is carefully selected by Zhuo Yi in advance.</p>

    <p>The era of big data is so scary...</p>

    <p>The information you see may actually be what others want you to see.</p>

    <p>"Master Canglong!"</p>

    <p>"Master Liu Yong!"</p>

    <p>So when they saw the two of them, Chen Chao and Guo Hao were almost in sync, shouting their names in surprise.</p>

    <p>It only took a moment. Both of their eyes began to shine. www.uukanshu.net</p>

    <p>Obviously Zhuo Yi's push message plan completely worked. At least Chen Chao and Guo Hao recognized the true identities of the two people at a glance. They also looked at the two people in awe.</p>

    <p>"Hahaha. I didn't expect that I was actually recognized." Canglong scratched his head and stood up from the big stone with a shy face. To be honest, he knew that this was a show. He had been rehearsing with Liu Yong for a long time. For a long time.</p>

    <p>Back then, Lord Diulei took him and Liu Yong to secretly inspect Chen Chao and Guo Hao. Both of them were very satisfied with their matched apprentices.</p>

    <p>But now, when the two of them saw their favorite disciple in person, the tension suddenly rose again.</p>

    <p>As a master, of course there are things that masters are afraid of.</p>

    <p>After all, Chen Chao and Guo Hao were not the only ones present at the scene.</p>

    <p>What if your request to take on a disciple is rejected...</p>

    <p>Isn't it embarrassing?</p>
