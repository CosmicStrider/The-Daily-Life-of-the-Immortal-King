  <h1>Chapter 1302 How powerful is the consecrated body?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan didn't know what happened.</p>

    <p>He couldn't see the ancient Golden Men. He couldn't see the hooks and locks of the ancient Golden Men.</p>

    <p>Just by feeling, I noticed that Zhuo Yi next to me and the young man in overalls seemed to be extremely nervous.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Sun. An unknown creature has come to snatch Miss Sun's body..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi did not tell about Heavenly Dao. Instead, he used the concept of "unknown creatures" to explain Sun Yiyuan.</p>

    <p>Unknown creature?</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan was shocked.</p>

    <p>The charm of his granddaughter is indeed extraordinary...</p>

    <p>These days, no matter whether they are human or not, they are all greedy. It is simply outrageous.</p>

    <p>"Director Zhuo. What should I do?!" He immediately stepped forward to protect Sun Rong's body.</p>

    <p>The body of True Immortal cannot compete with the ancient Golden Men. Even if they charge forward, there is no point.</p>

    <p>When the familiar hook lock came through the door, Heavenly Dao almost subconsciously took out the Death Book and clamped the hook lock.</p>

    <p>But it was beyond his expectation.</p>

    <p>This time, the death certificate had no effect at all!</p>

    <p>There is no mechanism to trigger death upon touching the Book of Death!</p>

    <p>"What's going on!"Zhuo Yi was surprised.</p>

    <p>"There is only one possibility..." Death Heavenly Dao frowned.</p>

    <p>The death certificate cannot fail for no reason. If it has no effect at all, then it can only prove one thing.</p>

    <p>That is the ancient Golden Men outside the door. They may be of the same origin as him!</p>

    <p>In other words, this may be his ancestor!</p>

    <p>Although it is a defective product that was abandoned by Dao Ancestor Wang, there is no doubt that it has the same origin as him!</p>

    <p>The current Heavenly DaoGolden Men were originally the little Golden Men that Dao Ancestor Wang experienced in countless failed versions in the Unspeakable Land, and finally evolved from them.</p>

    <p>As for why we want to seize Sun Rong's body.</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao probably thought of a possibility.</p>

    <p>The ancient Heavenly Dao previously tried to draw away the soul of Sun Rong. The purpose was nothing more than to break through the seal of the Unspeakable Land with the help of the girl's identity as the Son of the Void.</p>

    <p>And now Sun Rong's soul has been protected by Buddha Golden Lotus.</p>

    <p>When the soul cannot be obtained.</p>

    <p>Stealing the body became a secondary option.</p>

    <p>Copy the soul with the help of matching spells.</p>

    <p>Create a new Sun Rong...</p>

    <p>This operation is obviously much more complicated.</p>

    <p>But the other party is the ancient Heavenly Dao after all. It is not difficult to realize such a plan.</p>

    <p>"Reshape a...new me?" Hear the speculation of Death Heavenly Dao. The girl in the Golden Lotus fell into silence.</p>

    <p>"After reshaping the soul. Is there really such an operation?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, there is. But this operation is very disturbing, isn't it?"</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao said: "These ancient Golden Men are all defective products. They may not be able to achieve 100% restoration. In other words, if another soul of Miss Sun is really created, its personality may be different from the original one. Big deviation! And..."</p>

    <p>"And what..."</p>

    <p>"Once the new soul is created, the old one will simply disappear."</p>

    <p>"How can that work!" Zhuo Yi exclaimed.</p>

    <p>"Of course we can't let this happen!" Death Heavenly Dao said.</p>

    <p>In broad daylight, if Sun Rong's body was snatched away...</p>

    <p>I'm afraid that this is the end of his role as the messenger of Heavenly Dao!</p>

    <p>At that time, I'm afraid it won't be as simple as being held on the neck by Jingke and asking for punishment!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was very anxious: "Senior! What should we do now?"</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao: "Don't panic! This body has been enlightened by the master! Their hooks and locks can reach in. It may not be useful!"</p>

    <p>As he spoke, he tried his best to block the hook attack.</p>

    <p>This time the ancient Golden Men obviously came well prepared. Not only did they invite their "ancestors" who share the same origin with him, but there seemed to be a lot of people coming too!</p>

    <p>The golden hook locks passed through the door wall of the special care ward. When the death certificate did not work, Death Heavenly Dao had no choice but to fight hand to hand!</p>

    <p>One Euler and one chain. Give these hook locks back!</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi attempts to summon "Yu" for combat.</p>

    <p>Since the last war with the Foundation ended.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has given this "Yu" to Zhuo Yi as Zhuo Yi's exclusive sword.</p>

    <p>Now "Yu" is still being maintained at Luo Pangzi's hardware store.</p>

    <p>But after all, a new contract has been signed with Zhuo Yi. If you want to use it, just "--Jianlai!" will do!</p>

    <p>However, an unexpected situation happened again at this moment.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi reached out repeatedly.</p>

    <p>Sometimes he raises his hands above his head. Sometimes he spreads his arms to the left and right like a roc spreading his wings...</p>

    <p>He thought that his summoning posture was wrong, so he changed various "sword coming" postures.</p>

    <p>As a result, there was never any movement.</p>

    <p>"Senior Heavenly Dao. Why can't I summon my sword? Is my posture wrong?" asked Zhuo Yi in the mental space.</p>

    <p>"Obviously not! This group of ancient Golden Men came well prepared! I'm afraid some kind of barrier has been set up in the hospital to block your summoning signal!" Death Heavenly Dao sweated on his temples.</p>

    <p>This wave of ancient Golden Men is coming with force. He feels like he can hardly stand it anymore!</p>

    <p>Although Sun Yiyuan didn't know what Zhuo Yi and the young man in overalls were doing.</p>

    <p>In his eyes, the two of them were just fighting the air...</p>

    <p>It looks a bit sinister.</p>

    <p>But he knew very well. Something big must have happened now!</p>

    <p>Although the existence of the ancient Golden Men cannot be seen.</p>

    <p>However, a True Immortal can still smell that dangerous smell!</p>

    <p>Gold and Jade Sky-shaking Stick!</p>

    <p>Mr. Boss Sun took out his ancestral magic weapon.</p>

    <p>However, he soon discovered something strange.</p>

    <p>He doesn't know why. He feels like there's something wrong with his golden and jade shaking stick...</p>

    <p>To the touch, it feels like it has lost its spiritual power.</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect that they would use such methods..." Death Heavenly Dao was surprised.</p>

    <p>This is a typical "weapon spirit hibernation" state!</p>

    <p>The barriers set up by these ancient Golden Men can not only effectively block the summoning signals for magic weapons, but can also put all the weapon spirits within the range of the barrier into a deep sleep!</p>

    <p>And this is the legendary "weapon spirit hibernation!"</p>

    <p>In such a state, the magical weapon will lose the blessing of the power of the weapon spirit, causing its power to be greatly reduced! And it will enter a "vulnerable" state!</p>

    <p>When the weapon spirit is hibernating, forcibly using the magic weapon will most likely result in the entire magic weapon being destroyed!</p>

    <p>"What should we do..." Death Heavenly Dao felt that the situation had become increasingly dangerous.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi's sword cannot be summoned. All the magic weapons are in a state of failure. It is very difficult to break through!</p>

    <p>He was holding on to the hooks of more than a dozen ancient Golden Men. He couldn't think of anything else!</p>

    <p>Zhuo YiAlthough we can see these Golden Men, they obviously lack combat power!</p>

    <p>Even if you activate the thirty-three paths of vitality, it's still not enough!</p>

    <p>"Senior! Master has noticed the situation here! But we can't take action yet. We have to find a way to lure these Golden Men out!" At this time, Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>He heard the message sent to him by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This hospital is no better than the Divine Sea in the Divine Realm. It is a densely populated area. Moreover, there are many doctors and patients in the hospital.</p>

    <p>If we attack directly here, the whole building will probably collapse...</p>

    <p>So they have to find a way to break out first!</p>

    <p>"What should we do, senior!"Zhuo Yi was also anxious.</p>

    <p>If this continues, they will be captured soon!</p>

    <p>The ancient Golden Men have already poked their heads out of the wall. They plan to go directly to rob them.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the girl in the Golden Lotus made a surprising decision.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "Senior Heavenly Dao! Just use my body to kill you!"</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao: "This..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "It's okay! It's better than letting them take it away!"</p>

    <p>The current situation is so critical that we can no longer care about so many things.</p>

    <p>The girl's suggestion was indeed an idea.</p>

    <p>I saw Zhuo Yi stepping forward and opening the door of the medical cabin.</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan was already shocked: "Director Zhuo, what are you..."</p>

    <p>"The situation is critical. I will explain to Mr. Sun later!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"I'm offended. Sun Rong school girl!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi applied a "steeling technique" to Sun Rong's body, making the girl's soft body become stiff!</p>

    <p>Drink!</p>

    <p>Immediately afterwards, he grabbed the girl's feet, as if wielding a sword, and slashed at the ancient Golden Men who were about to break through the ward wall and come forward to snatch the body!</p>

    <p>After being strengthened by the monk's consecration technique, the power of the girl's physical body is so great that it is unbelievable.</p>

    <p>The body of Sun Rong. The head part collided with the head of the ancient Golden Men!</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The ancient Golden Men who were about to break in were smashed to pieces like a watermelon on the spot.</p>

    <p>"Sun Rong school girl! You are too strong!" Zhuo Yi was stunned.</p>

    <p>"It would be nice if...it could come in handy..."</p>

    <p>Inside the Golden Lotus. Sun Rong looked at the unusually unreliable scene in front of him with mixed emotions.</p>

    <p>Buzz...</p>

    <p>At this time, the girl's body was filled with powerful spiritual energy!</p>

    <p>{Consecration Technique} The golden light of Buddha blessed on the girl's body emanates through the blue and white striped hospital gown...</p>

    <p>For a moment, all the ancient Golden Men stopped and fell into a sluggish state.</p>

    <p>They would never have thought that such an operation could exist.</p>

    <p>"Good opportunity!" Deathly Dao shouted loudly at this time.</p>

    <p>He took the girl's body from Zhuo Yi's hand. He held the girl's foot with one hand and used it as a sword hilt. He officially started to fight back...</p>

    <p>Finally escaped from the hospital successfully!</p>

    <p>Outside the hospital, those ancient Golden Men were still chasing the girl's body relentlessly. They were like a group of out-of-control zombies, pouring out of the hospital in a steady stream.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was amazed at the number of these Golden Men.</p>

    <p>There are actually hundreds of them...</p>

    <p>It was indeed a premeditated action!</p>

    <p>"Master, you can clear the place!" At this moment, Zhuo Yi shouted.</p>

    <p>Outside the hospital. Wang Ling has been waiting for a long time.</p>

    <p>After he saw these crazy ancient Golden Men chasing them out of the hospital, he pointed the King's Eyes directly at the sky!</p>

    <p>Just a moment!</p>

    <p>I saw dark clouds shrouding the sky!</p>

    <p>The huge dragon-like dragon landed instantly. It exploded on the spot! Sweeping in all directions!</p>

    <p>Clear these hundreds of crazy ancient Golden Men. with one click!</p>
