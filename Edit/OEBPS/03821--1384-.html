  <h1>Chapter 1384 How to prove that Ku Xuan did not save the manuscript</h1>

  <div>



<p>"The reincarnation ghost hits the wall...that's how it is!" Ajuan understood instantly.</p>

<p>It's not that the abyss is a bottomless pit.</p>

<p>It's because of the "reincarnation ghost wall" restriction below, which forces them to start falling again when they fall to a certain position, creating a kind of perpetual motion.</p>

<p>After realizing this, Sun Rong immediately took out his sword to break the restriction. As a result, the hidden entrance was released.</p>

<p>Aohai's sword itself has a Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube integrated into it!</p>

<p>Under the influence of the power of resonance, Aohai is an excellent tool to break restrictions!</p>

<p>"Walk!"</p>

<p>On the divine cloud. At this time, Ajuan gave an order.</p>

<p>The two divine rabbits led everyone into the passage leading to the second secret room.</p>

<p>The moment I looked for that person to jump in, the entrance immediately closed. It was sealed almost instantly.</p>

<p>When he came back to his senses, Sun Rong and others appeared in a cave.</p>

<p>"Rongrong. We succeeded!" Sun Ying'er became excited.</p>

<p>"That's not enough. It's not enough for us to know how to get through the chamber."</p>

<p>Sun Rong frowned and analyzed: "If it is true as Er Ha said, the 26 secret rooms are interconnected. As long as we don't know which secret room the real exit is, it will be useless even if we crack the mechanisms of all the secret rooms."</p>

<p>"Indeed." Er Ha nodded: "If we don't know which secret room the real exit is in, we will just be doing nothing if we go all the way."</p>

<p>"I think the clues for the exit must be related to the story of Dao Ancestor Wang and the Old God." Sun Rong said as he began to look at the environment of the second secret room. This is a very wide cave. But you can see the edge at a glance.</p>

<p>Three lamps hang on the stone wall near the cave.</p>

<p>"This is the eternal fire of the God Realm. It is a wick made by the Old God from divine feathers. One wick can burn for thousands of years. Even if it is accidentally extinguished, it can automatically rekindle within 3 seconds." Ajuan recognized it immediately. The origin of the wall lamp is revealed.</p>

<p>The structure of the entire cave is not complicated.</p>

<p>On the rock wall, there are three scrolls hanging.</p>

<p>The scroll glows. It seems to be fixed in mid-air, flowing with mysterious power.</p>

<p>These three women respectively symbolize three age groups.</p>

<p>The first scroll shows a child, about six years old.</p>

<p>She was wearing a red dress and a pair of black leather shoes. Her face was full of childishness. When she smiled, her pair of deeply sunken dimples made the girl look extremely cute.</p>

<p>The second picture is of a young girl. She is wearing a long red dress. Her skin is fair and her eyes are clear. She looks as beautiful as first love.</p>

<p>The third picture is of an old lady with a kind face. She is sitting in a rocking chair. She is covered with a burgundy blanket. The picture scroll shows a sense of déjà vu as time passes.</p>

<p>Three scrolls appeared side by side. They exuded a huge coercion...</p>

<p>"Who is the woman in the painting?" Sun Rong asked curiously.</p>

<p>"It can't be wrong! This is Old God! It's Old God in three stages of age!" Ajuan looked at the picture in front of him and couldn't help but look surprised.</p>

<p>She was sure that she had not made a mistake. The paintings in these three scrolls were indeed correct by Old God.</p>

<p>Dimples are the best proof.</p>

<p>"Oh, Old God is so beautiful!" And to Sun Rong's surprise, Ajuan actually sighed.</p>

<p>It was obvious that her power was given by the Old God. But this reaction was like seeing the Old God for the first time.</p>

<p>"Is this your first time meeting?" Sun Rong asked curiously.</p>

<p>"Yes. Only a very few people have seen the true form of the Old God."</p>

<p>Ajuan said: "The Old God I saw is already a skeleton. She has transcended the physical body and turned into an ancient god."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by the pink skull?" Er Ha laughed inwardly.</p>

<p>It looked at the three paintings in the cave and said: "These three paintings are all hand-painted. The only person who has seen the three stages of Old God is Dao Ancestor Wang, right? So, is Dao Ancestor Wang in Old God?" Did you know Old God when God was very young?"</p>
    
<p>"Shit! It turns out that Dao Ancestor Wang is a copper smelter<sup>1</sup>?!" Sun Ying'Er was shocked.</p>

<dfn><sup>1</sup>(Copper smelting is the transliteration of "pedophilia", and the main reason for the popularity is that the anchor of the original B station "Wu Zhi Yache Big Flicker.")</dfn>

<p>"Don't talk nonsense! You've all seen it wrong! In fact, in order of age, it should be from right to left...Old God's initial appearance is the portrait of an old lady!"</p>

<p>Ajuan said: "The reason why Old God is called Old God is because Old God looked very old at the beginning. She is rejuvenated. On the contrary, she looks younger! The younger she is, the older she is! When I saw Old God. She is an ancient god with a body only as big as a baby."</p>

<p>"In other words, Dao Ancestor Wang doesn't mind whether Old God is beautiful enough. Right?" Sun Rong was filled with envy.</p>

<p>This kind of love that doesn't pay attention to appearance but goes back to the soul may be what everyone expects.</p>

<p>Emotions are something that can transcend time.</p>

<p>Even if. at different times. As long as I miss you enough.</p>

<p>One day, this radio wave can be transmitted to the person you like.</p>

<p>"Old God accompanied Dao Ancestor Wang throughout his life. But Dao Ancestor Wang's lifespan was too long. In addition, his rejuvenated physique made Old God unable to accompany Dao Ancestor to continue walking." Ajuan sighed. She felt that the topic seemed to be getting heavier.</p>

<p>"Dao Ancestor Wang must have other solutions, right?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

<p>"Perhaps. But choosing to leave is actually the Old God's own choice..." As a newly appointed King of the Divine Realm, Ajuan doesn't really know much about emotional matters.</p>

<p>Old God only passed down his power to her. But he didn't pass down the love history...</p>

<p>And what Ajuan knows now is all heard from other gods.</p>

<p>If he hadn't personally experienced the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube Chamber, I'm afraid Ajuan would still not be able to understand it.</p>

<p>The deep emotional bond between Old God and Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

<p>"These three paintings are all written by Dao Ancestor Wang. It feels like there is so much energy in them!" Sun Rong frowned.</p>

<p>At this time, Er Ha smiled coldly in his heart.</p>

<p>These three paintings may indeed be the works of Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

<p>But when it comes to energy, Er Ha is a bit dissatisfied...</p>

<p>His Little Master Ling made a random test paper. The energy permeating from the writing on it is also very strong! It's just that ordinary cultivators are too low-level to feel it.</p>

<p>As for the three paintings in front of me, the energy on them is amazing. It should be exposed deliberately by Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

<p>It's like a declaration of love.</p>

<p>Dao Ancestor Wang is using these three paintings to tell everyone the strong emotions between himself and Old God.</p>

<p>"I know how to pass this level." At this time, Sun Rong had an idea again.</p>

<p>Three eternal lamps. Three paintings of Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

<p>This actually hints at the password to break through.</p>

<p>"Ajuan. Ying'er. Go to the other two lamps." Sun Rong took the initiative and walked to the far right, the lamp facing the old lady's scroll. Then he said: "Wait until I blow it out. Ying'er, you blow the second one. Then Ajuan, you blow the first one."</p>

<p>"What's the order of rejuvenation? Got it!" Ajuan nodded.</p>

<p>Because the wick of the eternal lamp will re-ignite, it is extremely difficult for one person to do this alone.</p>

<p>As we all know.</p>

<p>Games like escape rooms.</p>

<p>This is a multiplayer sport(funny)...</p>

<p>Not only can it improve the tacit understanding of the team.</p>

<p>At the same time, it can also be proved that Ku Xuan indeed did not save the manuscript.</p></div>
