  <h1>Chapter 1234 Future Master?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After some conversation, Keorn's nervousness eased significantly.</p>

    <p>Maybe it was because Snake's death gave him a feeling of being relieved of his burden.</p>

    <p>As one of the investigators, he felt that he had watched too many of his colleagues die at the hands of scavengers.</p>

    <p>He didn't know when it started. Keorn also began to have a fear of scavengers deep in his heart.</p>

    <p>But now, with Snake's death, everything is free.</p>

    <p>The Office of Strategic Deception seems to have become Keorn's safe haven. Staying in the True Venerated Immortal Hall in the hinterland gives Keorn a sense of security.</p>

    <p>This newly established sect quickly jumped into the top ten of the world's sects at an almost eerie speed.</p>

    <p>Securely occupying the third position.</p>

    <p>Except for economics, the overall quality of his disciples is not as good as that of the first two sects. In other aspects, they are almost left to chance.</p>

    <p>The first two require accumulation after a long period of development.</p>

    <p>After all, the Office of Strategic Deception is a newly established sect. It is not easy to achieve this level.</p>

    <p>"You don't think it's necessarily an object, but a person..." Zhuo Yi frowned deeply after hearing Keorn's speculation.</p>

    <p>If you are looking for something.</p>

    <p>He actually thought of his master's "Senluo Wanxiang Pillar."</p>

    <p>But it's not like his master said he wouldn't return this pillar...</p>

    <p>Is this ethereal spirit capable of rioting over a magical weapon?</p>

    <p>The things in the void behind the Void Gate must be more than just the Senluo Wanxiang Pillar.</p>

    <p>And it must be more powerful!</p>

    <p>After comprehensive comparison, Zhuo Yi feels that the weight of this dense pillar does not seem to be that high.</p>

    <p>But if you come here to find someone.</p>

    <p>This makes the scope very broad.</p>

    <p>Even if the scope is narrowed, it seems that it can only be locked within the territory of Huaxiu.</p>

    <p>The purpose of the Foundation sending Keorn to the Huaxiu Country 20 years ago was to investigate the lurking virtual spirits within the Huaxiu Country.</p>

    <p>Judging from the comprehensive data, Huaxiu currently has the largest number of lurking virtual spirits in its territory.</p>

    <p>So the breaking point of everything is because of someone from Huaxiu country.</p>

    <p>At this point, the situation is gradually becoming clearer.</p>

    <p>"What are the current ways to identify lurking ethereal spirits?"</p>

    <p>"As I said before, phantoms are advanced beings without entities. They inhabit the human body with their own bodies. They will definitely produce a rejection reaction."</p>

    <p>"Rejection reaction?"</p>

    <p>"It's just at the beginning. Xu Ling's adaptability is very strong. The quick ones can adapt within one day. The slow ones take about five days... However, no matter whether they are fast or slow, they all need to drink a red decoction."</p>

    <p>"How do you know this?"Zhuo Yi was surprised.</p>

    <p>"There are cases around me of being penetrated by ethereal spirits. This provides me with very good information."</p>

    <p>When Keorn said this, he couldn't help but shed a cold sweat.</p>

    <p>"Wealth is gained through danger. What I am doing is very dangerous. If it is discovered that I am testing the ethereal spirit, I will definitely die."</p>

    <p>Using a human body to deal with unknown advanced beings...</p>

    <p>Hearing this, even Zhuo Yi had to admire Keorn's courage.</p>

    <p>He felt a desperate spirit from Keorn.</p>

    <p>In fact, the investigators of the SBP Foundation all have this spirit.</p>

    <p>Do your best to dig out and chase the truth. This is the mission of every SBP investigator.</p>

    <p>Such professionalism reminded Zhuo Yi of reporting from the front while holding a tree in extreme weather.</p>

    <p>Then reporters and photographers were swept away by floods or hurricanes...</p>

    <p>"I have taken a sample of the red decoction before. I wanted to take it to the foundation for testing."</p>

    <p>"Where is Ben now?"</p>

    <p>"I didn't take it with me. It was just kept in the apartment where I live. I don't know if it was destroyed by the scavengers."</p>

    <p>Keorn frowned: "With their ability, it shouldn't be difficult to find out where I live."</p>

    <p>It seems that this red decoction sample is the key.</p>

    <p>If the secret can be deciphered, perhaps we can discover the difference between human cultivators possessed by ethereal spirits and ordinary human cultivators.</p>

    <p>"As for the decoction, I will find a way."</p>

    <p>After saying that, Zhuo Yi looked to the side of Zhenyuan Immortal: "Senior, you must have heard it. I would like to ask senior to take action to find this decoction."</p>

    <p>"This is easy."</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan Immortal nodded. But with a single turn, his whole person turned into a cloud of smoke and disappeared.</p>

    <p>Such terrifying spatial control ability is something even a well-informed person like Keorn has never seen before.</p>

    <p>"What is the origin of this senior..."</p>

    <p>"This is a sect secret. If you want to know, you can investigate it yourself."</p>

    <p>Keorn wiped his sweat: "It's not that I haven't investigated the information of the Office of Strategic Deception. But I didn't find out until today. There are still many omissions. And this is the first time I have seen a sect open a canteen in its own door."</p>

    <p>In order to control the diet of their disciples, large sects usually do not set up places specializing in selling snacks.</p>

    <p>Eat too much puffed fried foods and carbonated drinks.</p>

    <p>Over the years, it will have a huge impact on the development and growth of spiritual roots.</p>

    <p>This is the reason why people who like to drink Fat House Happy Water generally have low cultivation level.</p>

    <p>--{The Cultivator has a story}. An expert once publicly expressed this view.</p>

    <p>Of course Zhuo Yi knows what Keorn meant by specifically mentioning the canteen.</p>

    <p>He smiled slightly: "Actually, I think that eating snacks may not necessarily have an impact on your realm."</p>

    <p>How could a person be swayed by a few packs of snacks when his level of strength has reached a level that defies heaven?</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi thought the same way when I was a kid.</p>

    <p>But since he met his cute little master, he felt like he had opened up a new world.</p>

    <p>The existence of Wang Ling completely subverted his understanding of cultivation.</p>

    <p>The so-called eating snacks has an impact on the realm. Now it seems to Zhuo Yi that it is a paradox. Cultivators only need to do everything in moderation.</p>

    <p>Therefore Zhuo Yi believes that eating less and occasionally will not affect the development of spiritual roots.</p>

    <p>"I don't agree with Mr. Zhuo's point of view. I am able to achieve such a level of cultivation because I have never eaten so-called junk food since I was a child." Keorn said with a smile.</p>

    <p>However, the next moment, Zhuo Yi's soul torture stunned Keorn on the spot: "But Mr. Keorn, do you think you are happy all the way here?"</p>

    <p>Keorn fell silent.</p>

    <p>"I know that it may be difficult to change Mr. Keorn's understanding of cultivation in a short period of time."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi said: "But if Mr. Keorn is willing to join our sect and fully understand the sect's corporate culture..."</p>

    <p>"So Mr. Zhuo wants to recruit me into his gang?"</p>

    <p>Keorn stopped Zhuo Yi's words.</p>

    <p>After going around in circles, he finally understood what Zhuo Yi meant when he heard this.</p>

    <p>The baggage routines in Eastern language are indeed profound and profound.</p>

    <p>Keorn was amazed.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi smiled: "Mr. Keorn. The Office of Strategic Deception does not extend an olive branch easily."</p>

    <p>Keorn thought for a moment and smiled: "I will consider it when this matter is over."</p>

    <p>The two were chatting while waiting for the Zhenyuan Immortal people to bring back the sample of the red decoction.</p>

    <p>At this time, a disciple from outside the door hurried over: "Report to Mr. Sun of the Huaguo Shuilian Group to see you!"</p>

    <p>"Mr. Sun?"</p>

    <p>Someone is coming. Somewhat unexpected. Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>He is also a person that Zhuo Yi finds quite difficult to deal with.</p>

    <p>After all, this man has a small chance of becoming his master's father...</p>

    <p>To put it simply, this person has a very small chance of becoming his future master.</p>

    <p>So in terms of your attitude towards this person.</p>

    <p>Regardless of whether Sun Yiyuan is here to cause trouble.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi needs to be carefully considered.</p>
