  <h1>Chapter 1635 Young people don't respect martial ethics</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling did not realize that although he said he did not want to be involved in this matter. But then he got involved in it.</p>

    <p>He really wasn't thinking about this. His mind was filled with homework, exercises and the upcoming monthly exam.</p>

    <p>But don't know why.</p>

    <p>My body moved involuntarily.</p>

    <p>He knew that Liu Renfeng came to the infinite secret realm. So waiting and waiting is the most convenient way to find her true identity.</p>

    <p>It's not easy to open the secret realm. Her true body will definitely show up at that time to take a look.</p>

    <p>In addition, this has another advantage. There is no one else at the entrance to the secret realm except him. This just provides him with a cover to hide his merit and fame.</p>

    <p>It seems a bit too high-profile and too troublesome to follow the brigade to capture the true identity of Liu Renfeng.</p>

    <p>It's better to wait until this crazy grandma throws herself into a trap.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling immediately decided to enter the infinite secret realm.</p>

    <p>However, he heard that it is not easy to open this infinite secret realm. It requires a huge amount of spiritual power to open the door.</p>

    <p>For this reason, both Shou Chong and Liu Renfeng racked their brains to find a way to open the infinite secret realm.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling believes it to be true.</p>

    <p>He used King's Eyes to lock the coordinate entrance to the secret realm.</p>

    <p>Then. A magnificent infinite secret realm door appeared in front of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The ancient door frame is densely covered with profound and incomprehensible runes. They are all things Wang Ling has never seen before.</p>

    <p>There are thousands of secret realms in the universe. They are countless.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is still just a child after all. Not all secret places have been visited.</p>

    <p>A regular cultivator seeks to visit a secret realm. In order to seek immortality in the secret realm and improve their cultivation, all of them are determined to go there. Each and every one of them is iron head hard to rush to the inside. They are afraid that they will be late and the treasures in the secret realm will be snatched by others.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling is different. He has no interest in the secret realm. Because the things in the secret realm are also in his King's Pants.</p>

    <p>So. I don't know much about the infinite secret realm. Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He heard from Shou Chong and Liu Renfeng that it takes a huge amount of psychic energy to enter.</p>

    <p>Facing the infinite secret realm door that appeared at this moment, a somewhat serious look appeared on his face.</p>

    <p>Then, he rolled up his sleeves and pushed the door sharply inward.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw the gate of the infinite secret realm suddenly collapse from behind.</p>

    <p>Not only that. Even the door frame is cracked.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Sure enough. He still thought too much.</p>

    <p>He obviously only used a little strength...</p>

    <p>God knows this secret door is so resistant to pressure.</p>

    <p>Therefore, before moving the desk into the entrance of the secret realm, Wang Ling also used the {Major Restoration Technique} to repair the dismantled door. It made everything look so natural.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Office of Strategic Deception command center. The "catching turtles in a urn" started with Wang Ling was fully deployed under Keorn's encrypted instructions.</p>

    <p>His face was flushed. He was excited but also a little nervous.</p>

    <p>Large-scale command is a great test of command ability. This time, the alliance military action seems to be to rescue the Sun Rong organization. In fact, the Huaxiu Alliance also has other considerations.</p>

    <p>From a layer cake perspective, the second layer of Huaxiu Alliance naturally wanted to capture Liu Renfeng. And they specified that they wanted to capture him alive.</p>

    <p>If this crazy grandma uses her creative ability in the right direction, she will indeed be a talented person.</p>

    <p>As for the third level, that is, the Huaxiu Alliance wants to use the Office of Strategic Deception as a medium to see the final size and combat capabilities of the alliance.</p>

    <p>This is purely considered from the strategic deployment of cultivation.</p>

    <p>The Huaxiu Alliance has always advocated the love of peace. The revenue generated every year is used to build cultivation infrastructure. Only a small part is invested in military defense.</p>

    <p>The current mainstream view in the cultivation world is that military defense can actually be replaced by another method.</p>

    <p>For example, unite private sects among the people and become a family.</p>

    <p>Just like the Confederate Army now.</p>

    <p>However, to organize such a large-scale alliance army, if it is launched based on the people's will of Huaxiu Alliance, it would be a bit too formal.</p>

    <p>So at this time, the necessity of the Office of Strategic Deception became apparent.</p>

    <p>When Lord Diulei went to solicit investment, Huaxiu Alliance decided to invest based on this consideration.</p>

    <p>Those heaven-level sects are connected together to block the development of the earth-level and Xuan-level sects below.</p>

    <p>Such behavior is very detrimental to the business and development of private sects.</p>

    <p>Therefore, at this time, a super sect that can surpass the heaven level is needed to set an example and form an unshakable force in all aspects.</p>

    <p>And finally, it becomes a hemp rope that closely connects other sects together.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the coordination and planning of sects in the world of cultivation is also a science.</p>

    <p>Of course, for a sect to develop, it is definitely not possible to rely solely on funds. It also needs a certain scale of talent reserves.</p>

    <p>Like this time for the Alliance Army, the private mission Keorn and Crispy Noodles received was to discover available talents in the cultivation world through this small-scale Alliance Army battle.</p>

    <p>Most talents are still buried. The current value can only be discovered by Bole.</p>

    <p>Once Keorn and Crispy Noodles Dao Lord lock in the candidate. It will only be recorded first.</p>

    <p>Next, we will wait for the sect's commercial department to communicate and discuss the transfer of disciples between sects.</p>

    <p>Today's Office of Strategic Deception has a lot of money. In theory, as long as you give them enough money, there's no one they can't negotiate with.</p>

    <p>"Did Mr. Keorn discover any outstanding seeds?" At this time, in front of the podium, Crispy Noodles Dao Lord asked, looking at the screen in front of him.</p>

    <p>"No. Not yet..." Keorn shook his head.</p>

    <p>Judging from the several shots being switched now, there seems to be no one he likes at first sight. The monks in the Alliance Army are generally relatively young. The average level is in the Golden Core.</p>

    <p>Golden Core. This actually doesn't seem to be a big deal...</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that although the northern suburbs laboratory has been surrounded, the attack order has not been issued yet.</p>

    <p>Without fighting, it's hard to tell the value of these monks.</p>

    <p>"I wonder what Crispy Noodles Dao Lord has to say?" At this time, Keorn asked.</p>

    <p>"I did find one." Crispy Noodles Dao Lord pointed his eyes at a young monk on the screen. Immediately, the system's intelligent tracking system pointed directly at the precise position and scan of this person.</p>

    <p>Soon, the young monk's name appeared on the screen on the right: [Tianquan Sect. Li Huayu]</p>

    <p>"Tianquan Sect?" Keorn frowned.</p>

    <p>This ranking is relatively low.</p>

    <p>Because it's just an outer sect.</p>

    <p>"The delay in issuing the attack command has a great impact on the mentality. You can see that this person is neither arrogant nor impetuous. There is always a calm look on his face. This state of mind is already rare." Crispy Noodles Dao Lord said.</p>

    <p>Of course. His remarks are pure nonsense.</p>

    <p>With his eyesight, he could see the condition of these monks at a glance.</p>

    <p>As the "real clone" of Wang Ling, Crispy Noodles has the natural ability to recognize people.</p>

    <p>However, this ability is not clearly explained.</p>

    <p>So he had to find a reason to explain.</p>

    <p>Generally in the world of cultivation, the most illusory reason is "state of mind."</p>

    <p>It sounds very mysterious at first, but it seems to make some sense.</p>

    <p>Just like those horoscope tests and psychological tests on the market.</p>

    <p>And this is the so-called: Barnum effect.</p>
