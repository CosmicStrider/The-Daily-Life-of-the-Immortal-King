  <h1>Chapter 2001 I heard that Vice Colonel Huo doesn't have a girlfriend?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: This principal-level battle between the two schools has begun.</p>

    <p>However, in the eyes of outsiders, the monk and Principal Dai of Shengke were looking at each other from a distance. They were looking at each other but neither one made the first move.</p>

    <p>I don't even know why in this atmosphere, even looking at each other feels so affectionate...</p>

    <p>"What's going on, principals? Why don't you take action?" The entire office in the teaching building was boiling. Some teachers had already prepared popcorn, melon seeds and happy water. They were just waiting to see this peak showdown between the principals.</p>

    <p>However, the deadlock in front of them could not help but make all the teachers feel a little disappointed.</p>

    <p>"I'm afraid this is a battle between masters. It is also the so-called movement of the mind but the body does not move." Teacher Pan crossed his arms and pushed the gold-rimmed eyes as he explained.</p>

    <p>It can only be said that as the number one gold medal teacher at Number 60 High School, Teacher Pan is worthy of being Teacher Pan. He noticed at a glance what most other teachers have not noticed yet.</p>

    <p>"What Director Pan means is..."</p>

    <p>"That's the literal meaning. I'm afraid our vice-principal is competing with the other party's Principal Dai in the spiritual world. I'm afraid this is also to protect the safety of all of us."</p>

    <p>"Yes. Although I don't know what level our Vice Principal Huo Ding is. But I heard before that Vice Principal Huo is actually a True Immortal. Two True Immortals really fight. It's easy to destroy a city." The teacher nodded. He agreed very much.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan continued: "But I heard that this kind of battle is established directly through the mental space. It is generally divided into the attacking side and the defending side. The current situation is not easy to judge what is going on."</p>

    <p>"After all, Principal Dai is known as the God of Killing... He fought countless intruders into our country of cultivation on the battlefield back then. He is known as the proud son of one side of the world. I also know that the murderous aura of the blood sea in his mind will be extremely strong. If Principal Dai drags our Vice Principal Huo into the mental space first, I'm worried that Vice Principal Huo won't be able to withstand the pressure."</p>

    <p>When Teacher Pan said this, all the teachers in the office who heard this analysis couldn't help but feel a little nervous.</p>

    <p>Until the battle is over, no one knows what will happen.</p>

    <p>No teacher at Number 60 High School could have predicted the final outcome of the battle.</p>

    <p>But the current battle has also made many teachers fall into deep thought.</p>

    <p>As a veteran figure who was known as the God of Killing and had great military achievements in the past. He is now the principal of the Number 1 High School Cultivation Academy.</p>

    <p>It turns out that even if you are fighting for your country, the pressure of blood debt still exists, right?</p>

    <p>Many teachers are even a little unable to understand such complex and tangled emotions. After all, modern cultivation society has been peaceful for too long.</p>

    <p>Although there are occasional trade disputes between cultivating countries, there is really no way to return to the war-torn days of the past.</p>

    <p>At this moment, they have enjoyed comfort for too long. They teach in the academy step by step every day and live their daily lives. But they seem to have gradually forgotten the instinct of fighting as a cultivator.</p>

    <p>Even though the school holds practical training every year, compared to the cruelty in the era of cultivation wars, these entertaining practical trainings now look more like a trivial game.</p>

    <p>"War is cruel. It is precisely because of this that we need to remember it closely. Let us know that peace is hard-won. However, in peaceful times, of course we must also have some awareness of being prepared for danger in times of peace."</p>

    <p>"Teachers, you don't have to think too complicated. Today's children are much smarter than us."</p>

    <p>"Their patriotism is not just lip service. If a war really breaks out, these Houlangs will immediately turn into a surge of lava. They will be the first to unite."</p>

    <p>At this time, Teacher Wang Zukang's voice suddenly came from the office door.</p>

    <p>His body is still so familiar. His plump and round belly gives people an inexplicable sense of intimacy.</p>

    <p>"It's Director Wang! Why are you back? Where is School Chen?" a teacher asked in surprise.</p>

    <p>"School Chen is still in a meeting. My session has ended. I heard that the principal has an appointment today, so I came over to take a look. How is the situation now?"</p>

    <p>He opened a pack of spicy strips and chewed gluten. He stood on the window sill and watched: "Sure enough, it started at the front door. I entered through the back door. I was still wondering why the school was so quiet."</p>

    <p>"Instructor Pan said that this is a spiritual confrontation between Vice Principal Huo and Principal Dai." A teacher replied: "But the current situation is hard to say. The two seem to be evenly matched. No changes can be seen at all. I don't know how long it will last."</p>

    <p>"It is indeed a mental confrontation. But what is certain is that Vice Principal Huo is not at a disadvantage yet. Look at his expression. He is very calm. On the contrary, it is Principal Dai who is showing signs of cold sweat." Old Gudong responded. road.</p>

    <p>The teachers took a closer look and showed surprise in their eyes.</p>

    <p>"It's true! But what's the origin of Vice Principal Huo... He just came here not long ago. The teachers in our office usually don't dare to talk to him except for meetings."</p>

    <p>A female teacher blushed: "Hey. Actually, I don't really care about strength or anything like that. And I just want to ask everyone. I'm the only one who thinks... Vice Principal Huo is actually very good-looking! Those eyebrows are so delicate. Now. I feel like he is a star..."</p>

    <p>"Teacher Xu from the ancient Chinese class. You need to calm down..."</p>

    <p>Old Gudong said: "I don't know if Vice Colonel Huo has that idea. But I heard from Colonel Chen that he doesn't have a girlfriend."</p>

    <p>"Don't you have a girlfriend?"</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan couldn't help but laugh: "Ha. I heard that those powerful people who are in high positions are almost all not sexually attracted to women. Because their realm is too advanced, they have no worldly desires."</p>

    <p>"Hey. That's so boring. Then why don't you become a monk and become a monk..." Several female teachers who were interested in Vice Principal Huo felt shocked by these words. All of them couldn't help showing their disappointment. The look comes.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, Qu Shuling, who was locked up in the student apartment and under close surveillance, opened his eyes from sitting cross-legged.</p>

    <p>When Dai Tianchun came here to visit him with food, the guards gave them fifteen minutes.</p>

    <p>However, in fact, during those fifteen minutes, he had a very intensive conversation with his teacher.</p>

    <p>It's just that the spiritual guards outside can't notice it.</p>

    <p>At this time, Qu Shuling touched his belly.</p>

    <p>Those high-tech microbial mechanical devices installed in the food. This is a new cultivation technology developed by Shengke's research institute.</p>

    <p>In addition to helping Qu Shuling quickly recover from internal injuries, more importantly, this microbial mechanical device can be intelligently assembled in the body into a supercharging device installed in important blood vessels and meridians to increase the output power of spiritual power. And through internal stimulation of acupuncture points, it can temporarily increase his combat power level.</p>

    <p>The humiliation of the spiritual world trial ground. He has never forgotten it from beginning to end...</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe, Zhang Linyan, Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>He will sort it out one by one.</p>

    <p>Of course, these high-tech microbial mechanical devices in his body alone are not enough to increase his combat power to a terrifying level in a short period of time.</p>

    <p>But it is enough to deal with the spiritual guards at the door.</p>

    <p>So in fact, Dai Tianchun gave him something else when he left.</p>

    <p>It was a scale from a spiritual beast.</p>

    <p>Dai Tianchun told him.</p>

    <p>This is. Dragon scale...</p>
