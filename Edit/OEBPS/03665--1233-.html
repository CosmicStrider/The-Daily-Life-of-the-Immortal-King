  <h1>Chapter 1233 Sun Family Treasury</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The scavengers were temporarily repelled. But that didn't mean the matter was over.</p>

    <p>This is just the beginning of chaos.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi is still intensifying its inquiries on Keorn.</p>

    <p>On the other side, various forces also have their own movements.</p>

    <p>Huaguo Shuilian Group Building. Towering tall building. Empty.</p>

    <p>Everyone was evacuated early.</p>

    <p>Only the men in black who were sent earlier were left doing the reporting work.</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan's face looked extremely ugly.</p>

    <p>He did not expect that so many people would be involved this time. Not only overseas foundations, the Office of Strategic Deception, and even the General Alliance were involved.</p>

    <p>Moreover, there seems to be branch forces among these forces that are secretly fighting against each other.</p>

    <p>"It is said that there is a team of scavengers in the Foundation. This is a killing machine specially developed by the Foundation. I didn't expect this to be true..."</p>

    <p>The report work of the man in black was over. Jiang Xiaoche also showed a very surprised expression.</p>

    <p>Immediately he frowned deeply: "Sir, our intervention this time may have exposed our identity."</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan glanced at Jiang Xiaoche and shook his head: "No. In fact, our action was secretly instructed by General Alliance. Otherwise, do you think I would have the courage to intervene in this matter?"</p>

    <p>"General Alliance's instruction?" Jiang Xiaoche was even more surprised.</p>

    <p>"To be precise, it was the direct instruction of that adult..."</p>

    <p>"It's actually that adult!"</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche's eyes widened.</p>

    <p>"Judging from the results of this attack, the situation is worse than I imagined."</p>

    <p>"Since that lord has given me permission to intervene in this matter, it proves that there may have been something happening in the General Alliance that makes that lord distrustful..."</p>

    <p>Having said this, Mr. Boss Sun frowned slightly.</p>

    <p>But for now, they still don't know the origin of this detailed work?</p>

    <p>Is it someone from the Foundation? Or is it an unknown force from somewhere else?</p>

    <p>These are currently unknown.</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan is an old Jianghu.</p>

    <p>Enterprises can never be superior to the country. He still understands this truth.</p>

    <p>Although the Huaguo Shuilian Group has amazing financial resources, Sun Yiyuan will not interfere in this matter without authorization.</p>

    <p>Of course. As a businessman, this time the Huaguo Shuilian Group took the risk to intervene. The Boss Sun Fox put forward conditions.</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan doesn't lack anything in this life. Wealth, beauty or some novel items.</p>

    <p>Everything a secular person wants is just a cloud in his eyes.</p>

    <p>The only person he cherishes is his granddaughter.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong The disaster of "Yin-Yang Death Tribulation" could not be understood for a day, and he was always worried about it.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Sun Yiyuan's condition is that after this incident is over, he requires General Alliance to do its best to crack the yin and yang death disaster on Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"It seems that we have to intervene in this matter."</p>

    <p>When Jiang Xiaoche heard this, he already understood the current situation of Huaguo Shuilian Group.</p>

    <p>Judging from the events happening now.</p>

    <p>General Alliance may have lost the trust of that adult because of the "insider."</p>

    <p>The adult had no choice but to ask the Huaguo Shuilian Group to secretly intervene in the investigation.</p>

    <p>They are already involved in this matter. Naturally, it is impossible for them to escape intact.</p>

    <p>It's just that Jiang Xiaoche still doesn't understand something. He asked bluntly: "Why doesn't that gentleman let the Office of Strategic Deception investigate?"</p>

    <p>"I have been thinking about this issue before..." Boss Sun said: "Maybe you have your own concerns. Or maybe you feel that the Office of Strategic Deception is closely related to the General Alliance. There may be an insider inside."</p>

    <p>"But the problem is that people have been robbed by the Office of Strategic Deception!" Jiang Xiaoche was on the verge of tears.</p>

    <p>They are now in an awkward position in the middle.</p>

    <p>I can't fight again and again. I can't fight again and again. I can't get away and put myself out of it...</p>

    <p>The whole situation is quite unfavorable for the Huaguo Shuilian Group.</p>

    <p>The most important thing is that their identity has been exposed by their recent move. The insiders from General Alliance and the scavengers from the Foundation may take action against the Huaguo Shuilian Group at any time.</p>

    <p>This situation of being attacked from both sides is not a stalemate...</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche finally understood why yesterday, Sun Yiyuan ordered all employees to evacuate the entire building.</p>

    <p>Obviously, the old man didn't want to involve innocent employees.</p>

    <p>"Now I have no choice but to take a gamble."</p>

    <p>After thinking about it, Mr. Boss Sun quickly made a decision: "Everyone else should leave. Xiaoche. Come with me to the Sun Family Treasury."</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche's pupils shrank when he heard these words: "Sir, what are you doing..."</p>

    <p>"Since you are already involved and can't get out, you might as well make the matter bigger." At this point, Mr. Boss Sun stood up and took off his suit jacket.</p>

    <p>Under the coat, the white shirt held up by strong muscles is particularly eye-catching.</p>

    <p>Go to the Sun Family Treasury...</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche hasn't heard this sentence in many years.</p>

    <p>This is the signal for Mr. Boss Sun to go to the treasury to get the ancestral magic weapon and come out in person!</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Yiyuan was not sure whether he could trust the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>But as long as you give it a try, everything will become clear.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. Zhuo Yi's inquiry into Keorn has reached a new breakthrough.</p>

    <p>Their topic has turned to "virtual spirits."</p>

    <p>I just heard this Zhuo Yi today. It is a strange and mysterious word.</p>

    <p>"There is really such a thing as void invasion..." Zhuo Yi was secretly surprised after listening to Keorn's words.</p>

    <p>Originally, these were just Gu Shunzhi's inferences. Unexpectedly, it was now confirmed by Keorn's mouth.</p>

    <p>"Void invasion... You summed it up very well."</p>

    <p>Keorn smiled bitterly: "Our world is indeed undergoing a ruthless invasion by void creatures."</p>

    <p>"Did your investigation begin when you came to Huaxiu 20 years ago?"</p>

    <p>"To be precise, the time should be earlier. A large amount of evidence in my hand shows that the virtual spirit appeared earlier than the foundation previously thought."</p>

    <p>Keorn said: "Just before, they had been secretly observing humans. They had been lurking in the human world for a long time. And at the beginning, their number was not very large. They were not enough to warrant caution."</p>

    <p>"Are you observing humans..." Zhuo Yi couldn't help but sigh after hearing this: "It's like humans are playing with the bugs raised in the greenhouse?"</p>

    <p>Keorn laughed: "It's a good metaphor. Maybe to them, we are indeed like insects trapped in a greenhouse. Because the virtual spirits themselves are indeed higher life forms. They are like wind, light, and clouds. It's also like fog...without entity. But it has extremely high wisdom."</p>

    <p>"But why are such highly intelligent creatures interested in what they see as ants?"</p>

    <p>"This...the evidence I have so far is limited. I can only make assumptions."</p>

    <p>Keorn said: "After my long-term observation, I found that they seem to be looking for something. The current void invasion situation is unfolding for this thing."</p>

    <p>"What kind of thing is it?" Zhuo Yi asked.</p>

    <p>"It doesn't have to be an object. It could also be a person." Keorn replied.</p>
