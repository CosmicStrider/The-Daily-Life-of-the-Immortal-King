  <h1>Chapter 1926 Method of Confirming Qualifications</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Li Changzhe's confident speech made Gong Xuan frown slightly.</p>

    <p>He was not in a hurry to refute Li Changzhe's words. The two of them came to a roadside barbecue stall with a feast of entertainment.</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe suggested finding a roadside stall like this before on the immortal boat. We could sit down and chat and meet up, and have a late-night snack by the way.</p>

    <p>Of course. The students who can be summoned here are equivalent to those who are allied with Li Changzhe. All schools' intelligence data is shared. The purpose is to exclude Number 60 High School in this final selection.</p>

    <p>There were many school representatives coming. Among the out-of-town student representatives were Li Changzhe from Jingmen Number 8 High School. There was also a representative from Xiulan High School from Dongshi.</p>

    <p>There are even more local schools. There is Tianyuan High School, as well as Fumo Number 1 High School and Taitan High School, which I met before at the Jiulong Mountain Physical Martial Arts Competition.</p>

    <p>These are all the top thirty cultivation high schools. They gathered together to share information for the final selection of the inner earth world.</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe clicked on the skewers and said, "It seems that the leaders at Shangfeng do not want to decide the final roster through a competition this time. Otherwise, based on the overall strength of our high schools, which one is not better than those sixty?"</p>

    <p>"No. I think it might be better if there is no competition." At this moment, Gong Xuan said.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he looked at Gao Tianming from Fumo Number 1 High School and Zhu Hanyun from Taitan High School.</p>

    <p>To be honest, Number 60 High School is not easy to deal with. As an old rival who has fought with Number 60 High School, Gong Xuan feels that other colleges and universities do not have the right to speak as they do.</p>

    <p>After all, they both lost to Number 60 High School in the Kowloon Mountain Gymnastics Competition. And their results in all aspects were not as good as Number 60 High School... Although they also felt that Number 60 High School's victory was very strange. But they just recovered after the game. I can't find anything wrong with it.</p>

    <p>So Gong Xuan has felt that this time the roster will not be determined through competition. On the contrary, it is a good thing. Otherwise, they would not even know how to lose.</p>

    <p>Although the overall strength of Number 60 High School's Principal Chen is not strong, he is better at arranging troops and calculating others. That Principal Chen Tianxiang personally led the team to fight in Jiulong Mountain. He immediately sent the other college principals to They were so scared that they formed an alliance to deal with Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>That time and that moment. So much like this moment...</p>

    <p>"I wonder if you have received the invitation letter from Jiutian Teahouse?" At this time, Li Changzhe suddenly asked a key question.</p>

    <p>Because of the information sharing relationship, everyone had nothing to hide, so they all took out their "tokens."</p>

    <p>Just like Li Changzhe's crab shells, everyone else had their favorite things in their hands. The senior from Jiutian Teahouse had unknowingly left an invitation mark on them.</p>

    <p>After Li Changzhe read it, he nodded immediately, "It seems that the decisive point lies in the Jiutian Teahouse. The senior summoned so many of our student representatives there. I'm afraid he wanted to select through interviews. But I don't know what to do. Way..."</p>

    <p>"A discussion of Tao?" Zhu Hanyun said, touching his chin.</p>

    <p>Places like teahouses always feel inexplicably consistent with lectures and discussion.</p>

    <p>"Maybe. But we can't speculate on the deep meaning behind the senior of Jiutian Teahouse. I don't know the origin of that senior. But Qu Shuling told me that I must pay attention to this invitation." Li Changzhe said.</p>

    <p>"So it was Qu Shuling who told you..." Everyone couldn't help but jump in their eyes when they heard this name.</p>

    <p>No wonder Li Changzhe came to Songhai City a few hours ago to form an alliance to fight Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>This is what feelings are like...</p>

    <p>Naqu Shuling is currently the student council president among the freshmen in Shengke. He is also the number one trump card. The intelligence information he has is far beyond that of everyone here.</p>

    <p>There was silence for a long moment. Gao Tianming's tall and thin body suddenly moved. He stared at the engraved puppet in his hand. He said in a cold voice: "Since everyone has received the invitation, then everyone must be invited. The time is the same."</p>

    <p>The invitation letter clearly stated the visit time. Everyone took out the tokens and checked. They found that the teahouse visit time was 0:00 the next day.</p>

    <p>The senior of Jiutian Teahouse asked them to visit at midnight.</p>

    <p>But under normal circumstances, Suzaku Gate will close at 23:00.</p>

    <p>In other words, they have to use their own methods to enter the Suzaku Gate first. This will be the first level of test.</p>

    <p>Everyone here is an elite among high school students. It is probably not difficult to break through a Suzaku Gate. The key point is what kind of test you will encounter in the follow-up.</p>

    <p>Everyone looked at each other at a loss for a while.</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe ate two grilled crabs with satisfaction. He wiped his mouth with a wet paper towel and said, "Let's do this. I also made an appointment with Qu Shuling alone. I'll go see him first and wait until eleven o'clock in the evening. Everyone will gather at the door of Zhuque Gate. Well. If I have any new information then, I will tell everyone everything I know."</p>

    <p>"That's all we have to do." Everyone nodded.</p>

    <p>Everyone is worried about the next test.</p>

    <p>But after this brief discussion, everyone's purpose is clear.</p>

    <p>That is to try our best to fight for a spot. Number 60 High School must not be allowed to participate...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Time went back to eight o'clock in the evening. Wang Ling and Er Ha discovered a sudden visit from a man at the eighth level of True Immortal realm at the door of the villa.</p>

    <p>To be honest, Jing Heqiu's heart was broken. It was the first time that he had to lower his dignity and invite a student from the Foundation Building period.</p>

    <p>Although he had no idea what Teng Lao was planning, but after all, it was the official level that killed everyone... As his immediate boss, Teng Lao wanted to send him here. Of course he had to come.</p>

    <p>But now he had arrived at the door of the Wang family's villa. Jing Heqiu was stunned again. He didn't know how to speak.</p>

    <p>And it's already so late. What if the child's parents don't let the child go out?</p>

    <p>Everything is a problem.</p>

    <p>So Jing Heqiu stood at the door like a wooden figure. Knocking on the door was not a problem. Not knocking on the door seemed to be a problem...</p>

    <p>Of course, Jing Heqiu was not completely unprepared.</p>

    <p>He knew what the young people in this house were passionate about. Therefore, when he sent out invitations before, he used crispy noodles to distribute them.</p>

    <p>Now thinking about it carefully, Jing Heqiu suddenly felt that maybe his expression was not clear enough. Or maybe he gave too little.</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu sighed deeply. He had no choice but to open his windbreaker. He took out the limited edition crispy noodles he had prepared in advance and spread them out on the ground.</p>

    <p>These limited-edition crispy noodle plastic bags are all of different colors with laser patterns, like gems, shining brightly.</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu was hesitating whether to knock on the door or not.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the door in front of me opened by itself...</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu was horrified.</p>

    <p>This is a crispy noodle. The effect is outstanding!</p>
