  <h1>Chapter 1574 To catch a thief, you must first catch the king.</h1>

  <div>

    <p>As a newborn baby.</p>

    <p>His curiosity about new things and his strong ability to learn and imitate eventually made Fenmu Shen suffer a big loss.</p>

    <p>What's more, Wang Nuan is not an ordinary baby.</p>

    <p>Due to Shadow's blessing, Wang Nuan is born with strong learning ability.</p>

    <p>Just like Fenmu Shen's revolver. Ah Nuan girl can not only be copied through the power of Shadow.</p>

    <p>It is also possible to analyze the same type of matter in the entire universe through Shadow.</p>

    <p>In other words, although Ah Nuan girl has never seen other firearms, she can still use the power of Shadow to draw inferences about the revolver she has.</p>

    <p>Use Shadow to upgrade Gatling. It's just a routine operation for a little girl.</p>

    <p>When Gatling gets tired of using it, Wang Nuan can freely transform it into other firearms with just a thought.</p>

    <p>When the black-lighting Gatling shadow is accompanied by a burst of changes, it transforms into other gun forms in the hand.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen, who had been beaten into a hornet's nest but still stood firm and was not dead, recognized what Ah Nuan girl was holding. It was a rifle...</p>

    <p>It's just this rifle that makes Fenmu Shen feel weird.</p>

    <p>He had never seen this form in the real world. He couldn't tell what model it was.</p>

    <p>You can't just make it up out of thin air, right?</p>

    <p>Could it be...</p>

    <p>Suddenly, Fenmu Shen, who had holes all over his body, thought of a fact that shocked him.</p>

    <p>Sure enough!</p>

    <p>After using another chaos device "Wanjie Intelligent Brain" obtained from the sky tomb to conduct a search.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen was surprised to find that the rifle in the hands of Ah Nuan girl was called "AK-12 Apocalypse!"</p>

    <p>It is a RMB player firearm from an FPS shooting online game! And its performance is of gold quality!</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen was completely shocked: "..."</p>

    <p>Virtual game equipment can also be synchronized...what kind of terrible plug-in is this!</p>

    <p>If there's a portal for recharging. Can she recharge!</p>

    <p>At this moment, Fenmu Shen's thoughts are spinning thousands of times.</p>

    <p>Those purple eyes stared at the little girl in front of her. The initial thought in my mind that "the other person is still a child. It's better to be merciful" has been completely dispelled.</p>

    <p>More often than not, it was replaced by a kind of jealousy.</p>

    <p>Think of them as cultivators who have lived for eternity. Which one of them has not gone through a lot of hardships to get to this point?</p>

    <p>But the girl in front of me had such powerful abilities when she was born.</p>

    <p>This made Fenmu Shen feel more and more angry the more he thought about it.</p>

    <p>Although he was shot by Wang Nuan's firearms and had holes all over his body, those bullets penetrated his body and he felt no pain at all.</p>

    <p>Heavenly Ancestor transcends physical pain. Physical damage is almost ineffective.</p>

    <p>But Wang Nuan doesn't care about this. She has various types of firearms in her hands. Rifles, shotguns, and light and heavy machine guns switch back and forth. The never-ending bullets make her have a great time.</p>

    <p>"Girl... I don't have time to play this house game with you anymore." Fenmu Shen shook his head and walked forward step by step.</p>

    <p>Killing thoughts arose in his heart.</p>

    <p>I feel that Wang Nuan should not be left alive.</p>

    <p>A small voice ran through my mind. It didn't sound like any sound. But it sounded deep in the soul of a person. It made people feel restless and ups and downs.</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan blocked his ears. Facing such a mental attack, the little girl still lacked combat experience.</p>

    <p>However, she tried her best to stabilize the shadow space.</p>

    <p>Don't let space slip away.</p>

    <p>Even if he lacks actual combat experience, Wang Nuan can still feel what Fenmu Shen is thinking in his mind.</p>

    <p>The other party wants to break through the constraints of the shadow space.</p>

    <p>Fighting here would be very detrimental to them.</p>

    <p>She stared at Fenmu Shen extremely cautiously. Her fleshy little face was full of alertness.</p>

    <p>"Girl. You've got a lot of talent. If you can be humble. You'll have a bright future as my disciple. It's a pity that you don't appreciate my love. Then there's nothing we can do about it. " Fenmu Shen said. His face did not turn red. His tone was calm.</p>

    <p>He clearly wanted to kill Wang Nuan, but he adopted such a sanctimonious attitude.</p>

    <p>As he spoke, he wore almost nine pieces of invisible armor on his body.</p>

    <p>These nine pieces of armor are all very powerful chaos weapons. They also have the function of shielding their appearance. They cannot be seen with the naked eye.</p>

    <p>Of course. The most important thing is that the anti-injury capabilities of these nine pieces of armor are extremely strong!</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen is convinced. It is just relying on the ability of the Great Dao.</p>

    <p>Since I don't know much about this girl's weird Shadow, I can easily suffer a big loss.</p>

    <p>So why not take the initiative to sacrifice yourself? First anger this little girl and let her take the initiative to attack you.</p>

    <p>He wears nine layers of anti-injury armor!</p>

    <p>One piece will cause 1000% damage!</p>

    <p>Stacked up, the damage is counter-injured by 9000%!</p>

    <p>If this girl attacks him with all her strength, she might kill herself.</p>

    <p>Because he is not familiar with the Dao ability, he will suffer a loss.</p>

    <p>But in terms of his insidious combat experience, combat skills and ability to scheme against people, Fenmu Shen can be called an old fox among old foxes.</p>

    <p>He is a figure who has survived the eternal struggle. He has witnessed the fall of batches of eternal geniuses with his own eyes...</p>

    <p>How could a newborn girl be his scheming opponent?</p>

    <p>And the little girl has just been born. Even though her power is incredible.</p>

    <p>But in terms of strength and physical ability, Fenmu Shen feels that the opponent's space may not be that big.</p>

    <p>What he counterattacked was 9000% of the damage!</p>

    <p>This is a game.</p>

    <p>Although playing with a newborn baby girl, it seems a bit pricey for Fenmu Shen.</p>

    <p>But no outsiders will know about this.</p>

    <p>As long as he kills Wang Nuan for sure later...</p>

    <p>"Come on. Don't you want to kill me? I'll stand here and beat you." Fenmu Shen said. He took the initiative to step forward. The bullet holes all over his body that had been shot wildly by Wang Nuan were all covered in bullet holes. It is already gradually recovering.</p>

    <p>Ah Nuan girl looked at Fenmu Shen who was getting closer and closer. She felt a little frightened by the strange uncle in front of her.</p>

    <p>"Boom!"</p>

    <p>Before the tears come out. Wang Nuan " Hai Ya !" She called out. She took the initiative to extend her small, fleshy fists. She hit Fenmu Shen with a blow.L</p>

    <p>She didn't know why Fenmu Shen insisted on beating him.</p>

    <p>She had just been born and didn't understand the ways of cosmonauts yet... She had never heard of such a strange request.</p>

    <p>"Huh?" Fenmu Shen, who was originally full of confidence and planned to use counterattack to injure Wang Nuan, suddenly felt that something was wrong. The girl's punch was too fast. It actually made him slightly dazed. He didn't look too far. clear.</p>

    <p>This punch looks ordinary, but in fact it has amazing power.</p>

    <p>It hit him directly on the chest. Large swaths of blood splashed backwards like a fountain with an astonishing impact.</p>

    <p>"Ya!" Fenmu Shen cried out in pain!</p>

    <p>Not only was his chest pierced, but even the Heavenly Ancestor's Heavenly Pain was ineffective! He actually felt the pain!</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is!</p>

    <p>This girl punched him and actually ignored his nine layers of armor!</p>

    <p>The anti-injury armor completely shattered on his body! This girl didn't even lose a hair!</p>

    <p>The promised 9000% backlash. Nothing left.</p>

    <p>What kind of monster is this...</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen was secretly surprised.</p>

    <p>In the next breath, his body recovered again.</p>

    <p>But the pain in my chest still continued.</p>

    <p>And it was only then that Fenmu Shen discovered the clue!</p>

    <p>It turned out that a hole was punched in his shadow's chest!</p>

    <p>The girl's punch just now seemed to hit his body, but it was actually an attack on his shadow.</p>

    <p>After the shadow collapsed, the pain was directly fed back to the body.</p>

    <p>It is a pain that comes from the soul and spirit!</p>

    <p>And the pain of heaven can only replace the pain of the body!</p>

    <p>The damage caused by this punch to the shadow cannot be replaced!</p>

    <p>"Is this girl... still a human..."</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen gritted his teeth secretly.</p>

    <p>Shadow was hit, causing him a certain degree of trauma. The situation seemed unfavorable, but it was not over yet.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, he still had a trick up his sleeve...</p>

    <p>"Girl, you are very strong. I underestimated you. But...I am not someone to be bullied." Fenmu Shen snorted.</p>

    <p>Although he was trapped in the shadow space at the moment, he was not helpless.</p>

    <p>To capture the thief, capture the king first!</p>

    <p>As early as the moment when he slapped the earth, Fenmu Shen separated one percent of his soul.</p>

    <p>This one percent soul is far less powerful than the main body.</p>

    <p>But it would be enough to sneak into the earth secretly.</p>

    <p>And at this moment.</p>

    <p>In front of the Wang family's small villa. One percent Fenmu Shen appeared at the door with arms folded.</p>

    <p>And his target is not Wang Nuan's true body.</p>

    <p>This girl is using her abilities to fight with him and has no time to think about.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the target of One Percent is this villa. The source of all evil that gave birth to two cosmic monsters one after another...</p>
