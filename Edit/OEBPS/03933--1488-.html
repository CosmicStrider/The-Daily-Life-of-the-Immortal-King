  <h1>Chapter 1488 The Creator of Ghost Book</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The expression on Jiugong Liangzi's face instantly changed after hearing such a straightforward question. She and Zhuo Yi went downstairs mainly to hand over tasks with the female bodyguard named Junko.</p>

    <p>Next, the three Viagra people will serve as an important "tainted witness" and Junko will be responsible for watching. It was just a normal handover at work. But Jiugong Liangzi didn't expect that he would run into Sun Rong when he went downstairs.</p>

    <p>And I was asked such weird questions...</p>

    <p>Strategy?</p>

    <p>What a joke...</p>

    <p>She won't be tricked by this smooth-talking old liar.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi blushed. In fact, she did not reply directly. She just snorted: "Don't think that you can talk nonsense just because you helped me. My relationship with Zhuo Yi. is just a normal work relationship. That's all."</p>

    <p>She crossed her arms and looked a little impatient. She just waited for the elevator door to open and slipped out.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong looked at the girl's back. Under her calm appearance, she was actually slightly panicked.</p>

    <p>"Zhuo Yi Senior, you really found a treasure." Sun Rong had a smile on his face. He also felt that Jiugong Liangzi was much cuter than he thought.</p>

    <p>Originally, she and Jiugong Liangzi were at odds. The main reason was because Sun Rong was worried that Jiugong Liangzi would be detrimental to the young man in her heart.</p>

    <p>And maybe he will also come up with some "sexy" plan to deal with classmate Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This is absolutely not allowed to happen.</p>

    <p>But judging from the inquiry just now, Sun Rong feels that maybe Jiugong Liangzi didn't even notice it herself. She has actually fallen...</p>

    <p>Treat Zhuo Yi. Maybe I can't say I like him yet. But I definitely have some good impressions.</p>

    <p>After all, classmate Liangzi is a person who likes to talk nonsense.</p>

    <p>"Sun Rong The school girl was joking." Zhuo Yi smiled bitterly.</p>

    <p>The two of them walked out of the elevator door immediately. They walked slowly and tacitly.</p>

    <p>"I see that Zhuo Yi, the senior, has no mental burden at all to pursue Liangzi. It seems that he already knows, right?" Not a few steps away, Sun Rong asked a tentative question. He could hear it instantly. Zhuo Yi was stunned.</p>

    <p>"Sun Rong, the school girl, refers to the six mothers-in-law I will face in the future?" Zhuo Yi's eyes rolled around, pretending not to know.</p>

    <p>"Zhuo Yi Senior, you underestimate me. I can still find out about this."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong sighed. He smiled demurely and said, "But please don't worry, senior. I won't tell anyone about the secrets about classmate Liangzi."</p>

    <p>"That's good."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi breathed a sigh of relief: "Actually, I'm waiting too..."</p>

    <p>He was waiting for the day when Jiugong Liangzi confessed the secret to him personally.</p>

    <p>And Zhuo Yi deeply believes that when that day comes, it will never be too late.</p>

    <p>When she came to the front desk to check out, Sun Rong felt the hostility toward her from the female bodyguard named Junko.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong can't remember where he offended her. But he probably understands this kind of hostile look. After all, in the female bodyguard's inherent impression, she has always been the enemy of the Jiugong family.</p>

    <p>"Junko. Don't be too rude."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi noticed something strange about Junko and quickly reminded him softly.</p>

    <p>Although the female bodyguard didn't understand what happened between her young lady and Miss Sun, she still restrained the sharpness in her eyes.</p>

    <p>"The top priority is what I told you last night. Someone in my family is trying to use my time to study abroad to do something bad for me," Jiugong Liangzi said.</p>

    <p>The people who have been identified now are the "Awei Trio" who are subordinate to Mrs. Six and obey orders.</p>

    <p>As for the {Ghost Book} riots, Jiugong Liangzi felt that another group of people was secretly plotting.</p>

    <p>In other words, there are at least two groups of people who want to deal with her.</p>

    <p>And these two groups of people are currently on the surface... As for whether there are other forces in the family who want to take action against her, Jiugong Liangzi does not know.</p>

    <p>She came to Huaxiu country to solve the "foreign troubles." She originally thought that after successfully exposing the Zhuo Yi matter, the Jiugong family would be able to enter the Huaxiu country's market more deeply.</p>

    <p>But Jiugong Liangzi didn't expect that the "foreign troubles" were not solved, but the "internal troubles" in the family actually broke out in advance.</p>

    <p>And last night, Jiugong Liangzi himself thought about it for a long time.</p>

    <p>She felt that it might be more important to prioritize the internal affairs of the Jiugong family.</p>

    <p>If the Jiugong family keeps fighting within the family, it will be useless even if she finally wins the domestic market of Huaxiu. If the family is not united, it will all come to nothing.</p>

    <p>What's more...</p>

    <p>New evidence that has emerged now actually shows that the incident at Zhuo Yi back then may have been a misunderstanding between the Jiugong family.</p>

    <p>True combat power doesn't lie.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi is indeed very strong. Jiugong Liangzi has experienced this personally.</p>

    <p>After explaining the basic tasks, Jiugong Liangzi spoke further and said to the female bodyguard in front of him: "Junko, while you are watching over the three of Ah Wei, my newly hired bodyguard will be temporarily responsible for my safety."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi originally wanted to hide this matter, but Junko was one of her own. She thought it would be better to be honest.</p>

    <p>"Bodyguard? Who?" Junko was stunned.</p>

    <p>She actually heard the rumors about the new bodyguard last night. She was very curious about who the new bodyguard was.</p>

    <p>"It's me. I've been standing in front of you for a long time." Zhuo Yi pointed to himself. A smile spread across his face.</p>

    <p>"You???" Junko was shocked.</p>

    <p>Isn't this guy... the target of their investigation?</p>

    <p>But soon the expression on her face returned to calmness...</p>

    <p>Junko has his own understanding of why his lady hired Zhuo Yi as a bodyguard.</p>

    <p>It must be to get closer to Zhuo Yi and find evidence of his "imposter." That's why this drama was arranged, right?</p>

    <p>She understands!</p>

    <p>As for these imposters, Junko himself is actually very angry.</p>

    <p>Mainly in recent days, there have been more and more news about imposters. Things like pretending to be someone else and getting into college...</p>

    <p>Although his academic degree was canceled later, such behavior has interfered with other people's lives.</p>

    <p>These people who have used their power and money to change their own destiny have no idea how hard the people they impersonate have put in to change their own destiny.</p>

    <p>To deal with this type of powerful imposters, it is generally difficult to find direct evidence because of the long time span.</p>

    <p>That's why Miss Liangzi thought of hiring Zhuo Yi as a bodyguard and tying this guy to her side. Is there a better way to collect evidence...</p>

    <p>As expected of Miss Liangzi!</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi looked at the female bodyguard's frown and felt speechless in his heart.</p>

    <p>She never doubted Junko's ability to think...</p>

    <p>However, facing Zhuo Yi and his current situation. Jiugong Liangzi really feels that it is difficult to fully explain this intricate relationship with just a few words.</p>

    <p>So she just sighed in her heart. For the time being, she didn't care what the female bodyguard was thinking.</p>

    <p>"Also, have you found the senior I want you to help me find?" Jiugong Liangzi suddenly asked at this time.</p>

    <p>"Senior has changed his address. It took us a while to find his traces." The female bodyguard said: "Judging from Senior's current whereabouts, he seems to have been frequenting the Office of Strategic Deception recently."</p>

    <p>"Haunt the Office of Strategic Deception?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Jiugong Liangzi glanced at Zhuo Yi. She felt that Zhuo Yi could help.</p>

    <p>"There are so many people going to the Office of Strategic Deception...so who is this senior?" Zhuo Yi asked, touching the back of his head.</p>

    <p>"This is the original creator of {Ghost Book} back then."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi looked at Zhuo Yi and said, "I can't tell you other things. It's just that this senior's name is Jin Deng."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>
