  <h1>Chapter 2012 The practice of Wang Ling and Sun Rong on the Mountain of Retrospection</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling actually wants to guide her personally. This is something Sun Rong never dared to imagine before. This is a rare time to be alone with Wang Ling. And the key is that no outsiders will disturb her. </p>

    <p>Opportunities like this are so rare. I recalled my previous experience of trying to get alone with Wang Ling. She seemed to have fainted every time for various reasons. I missed it countless times. An opportunity to express your love in front of other people.</p>

    <p>But this time, when the opportunity was presented to her again, Sun Rong's heart couldn't help but begin to surge.</p>

    <p>However, at the same time, she felt a little nervous in her heart. God knows what she and Wang Ling will encounter in the Mountain of Recall...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong reminds me of those girl comics I read through Jiang Yingying's introduction a few days ago. Almost every heroine in them has the experience of being saved by a hero.</p>

    <p>It was a cliched plot, but it made her blush. Even some of the comic content was too indescribable. It gave Sun Rong the feeling of becoming a dua overnight.</p>

    <p>Since it was rare for the two of them to practice together, Sun Rong didn't know what to say for a while: "Wang Ling. I..."</p>

    <p>Normally, she is the leader of Gray Cult and the president of the Student Council of Number 60 High School. She is an eloquent person. But now facing the young man in front of her, she was unable to say a word.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, however, had already put his trouser pockets in and stood firmly on the teleportation circle. Seeing that Sun Rong couldn't come over for a long time, he tilted his head in confusion. Then he directly fired the primer spell to completely destroy Sun Rong. People were pulled over.</p>

    <p>"Hey...Wang Ling, please slow down..." This sudden seriousness shocked Sun Rong. He never expected that Wang Ling would use this method to kill himself. Carry it away.</p>

    <p>Just...do you want to practice with her?</p>

    <p>For a time, Sun Rong began to have a lot of thoughts in his heart.</p>

    <p>But soon she seemed to understand. She and Wang Ling were practicing together. To Wang Ling, it was not called practice at all... Their cultivation had already reached the ceiling. How did they still want to break through? ?</p>

    <p>This is obviously a deliberate attempt to create a little fuss for yourself!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had no intention of reading Sun Rong's inner thoughts at this time. The only thing in his mind was that limited-flavor crispy noodles were about to be sold at a special price in the supermarket in the city center.</p>

    <p>So now he is hurriedly taking Sun Rong into the Mountain of Retrospection. It is purely just to help Sun Rong rise to the level it deserves. Then he goes back to buy crispy noodles by hand.</p>

    <p>Of course. It's just a trip to the supermarket. This Wang Ling can be left to others.</p>

    <p>It's a pity that Wang Ling has never been in the habit of asking for help. What's more, it's a top priority like buying limited-edition instant noodles... For such a big thing that ranks first in my heart, I must do it myself.</p>

    <p>The teleportation light of the Mountain of Retrospection lit up. As the vision changed, Sun Rong came to the Mountain of Retrospection again in an instant.</p>

    <p>The last time she came here was just to test the sword. Now the Mountain of Recall has undergone a new revision and adjustment. It has become a brand new... appearance.</p>

    <p>I just don't know why. Sun Rong looked at the scene in front of him and felt a little bit of fear.</p>

    <p>She didn't know what the scene that others were facing was like. But what came into view now was a vast black forest. All the trees and leaves were pitch black. It seemed that there was something that could attract people. Merge into the illusion of darkness.</p>

    <p>The sky here is extremely clear. Those huge planets are moving in the sky. It feels like they are about to fall at any time. Sun Rong's face was full of astonishment. She thought to herself that it was lucky that she did not have a phobia of giant objects. Otherwise, she would definitely You will be shocked and speechless by the scene in front of you.</p>

    <p>But even so. This mountain of retrospect is completely different from Sun Rong's imagination. The sky is the fear that makes people stay in the universe. The black forest on the ground is the fear that makes people immersed in the darkness.</p>

    <p>In a daze. Sun Rong suddenly remembered.</p>

    <p>Because the mountain of retrospection in front of you is a spatial environment that automatically adjusts according to the realm of the person who enters.</p>

    <p>It's just like the world level in the game. As long as the average level of all players in the server becomes higher, then the world level will naturally be improved.</p>

    <p>Her strength is naturally not that strong... but it is on par with Wang Ling in the sealed state.</p>

    <p>The map level of this mountain of retrospect has become very scary. Facing the black forest in front of me, Sun Rong is very scared. But I still muster up the courage to try to walk. Even so, this is a rare and Wang LingAn opportunity to practice together. She didn't want to hold the boy back at this juncture.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is here. But he has not gone far. He is observing Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>To be honest, this situation. Wang Ling was not unexpected.</p>

    <p>Even in the sealed state, the level of the map in front of him has reached a very astonishing level. This dark forest is full of dangers. Even the most ordinary mob has an Itinerant Immortal level of strength.</p>

    <p>He saw Sun Rong trying hard to take steps but could not move. His emotions were a little complicated for a moment.</p>

    <p>Such pressure. Without the passive blessing of Aohai's human sword unity. In the realm of Sun Rong, even if you keep watching from a distance, the limit is already the limit without fainting.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's willpower. But it is beyond Wang Ling's imagination.</p>

    <p>He didn't know what kind of force was supporting her. Faced with the pressure of a map level several levels higher than his own, she struggled to maintain her mental willpower.</p>

    <p>This is also an exercise.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling was not protected at the beginning.</p>

    <p>Instead, he waited until the girl was almost at her limit before walking to her side.</p>

    <p>As soon as Wang Ling came close, it seemed to have a natural spiritual barrier. The pressure on Sun Rong was instantly dissipated. It was like breathing fresh air after being in the water for a long time.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling..."Sun Rong suddenly collapsed on the ground. It felt like he had just experienced an extreme long-distance run.</p>

    <p>She felt that her legs were weak, but she still maintained her mental state and did not faint directly.</p>

    <p>"Is it okay?" Wang Ling asked. Even though it was a straight man's tone that was concise and concise, it still moved Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Classmate Wang Ling is... caring about her?</p>

    <p>Sun Rong once suspected that he might be under tremendous pressure and had auditory hallucinations.</p>

    <p>But now she really couldn't walk. She needed to rest. She said weakly to Wang Ling: "Wang Ling. I'm fine... I'm just a little tired..."</p>

    <p>"This is normal. Sister Rongrong, the practice has just begun. You have to adapt." At this time, Jingke's voice sounded from Sun Rong's ear.</p>

    <p>Yes. Of course Sun Rong also knows. The current practice has just begun.</p>

    <p>They were still far away from the black forest in front of them. Just watching from a distance made her feel an amazing sense of fear. It was hard to imagine what would happen if they entered the black forest.</p>

    <p>She was feeling uneasy, but at this moment Wang Ling suddenly bent down.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong immediately turned red.</p>

    <p>She thought Wang Ling would carry her behind. But she found out that she was overthinking it.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong discovered that this time Wang Ling was extremely patient. There was no urging or any impatience. Instead, he bent down and sat directly next to him, waiting for her to rest until she could stand up again. Such a close distance. Sun Rong could even hear his steady breathing. It made her almost dizzy.</p>
