  <h1>Chapter 1894 Assassination of Wang Lingâ‘¢</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Jingze rises into the sky. The power of thunder surges around it. Divine power surges and the pressure is overwhelming.</p>

    <p>In the era when the dragon clan was at its peak, the fight between two dragons was an extremely terrifying thing, because it would herald a destructive Star Wars.</p>

    <p>However, now in Jingze's core world, with the assistance of the Yongyue Starlight given by Bai Zhe, his entire core world has been strengthened. It seems to be covered with a layer of tempered film. No matter how riots are inside, the core The walls of the world appear to be intact.</p>

    <p>This made Wang Muyu, who noticed this scene at the same time, breathe a sigh of relief. With the inner wall so strong, he and Jingze could fight freely.</p>

    <p>And it was obvious that Jingze came well-prepared. He did not dare to be negligent in the slightest. The seven-color glazed dragon energy boiled all over his body, lingering around his small body, giving his body a magical crystal clear appearance.</p>

    <p>He rose into the air, spitting seven-color dragon flames from his mouth. The astonishing power of the elements swept directly in front of him, directly facing the thunder dragon summoned by Jingze.</p>

    <p>At this time, there was no sign of relaxation on Jingze's face. This was a shock wave between spiritual energy and spiritual energy. He knew that Wang Muyu was extremely talented. The power of ten thousand dragons was condensed in his body, and he was capable of thousands of changes. Every dragon ability can be used.</p>

    <p>This is the most horrifying thing about Wang Muyu. However, in Jingze's view, this is also a fatal flaw before he is fully cultivated. No matter how many dragon abilities he has, it is useless if he does not master them all.</p>

    <p>Obviously Wang Muyu also thought of this. Therefore, he integrated the power of multiple elements into the dragon flame at the same time. He wanted to use this hodgepodge method to make up for the shortcomings.</p>

    <p>"You haven't cultivated to the top. Everything is in vain."</p>

    <p>Jingze said coldly. His face was solemn. Having developed the potential of the electric dragon to the extreme, he was not afraid of the seven-color dragon flames sprayed by Wang Muyu. His shot was a powerful thunder dragon breath. It formed like the heaven falling down. An ordinary huge beam of light directly offset the dragon flames spouted by Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>It was obviously a mixture of many dragon abilities, but it still couldn't compare with the power of Jingze, a top-notch electric dragon. This made Wang Muyu feel unhappy.</p>

    <p>Compared to the last time, Jingze has made a lot of progress. Even under the guidance of Bai Zhe, this growth rate is astonishing.</p>

    <p>He was even close to surpassing himself at one point.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu thought that his growth potential was already at the top among all the dragonborns. But he didn't expect that the same was true for Jin Jie's growth potential.</p>

    <p>Of course, if you put aside the talent for growth, Jingze may also have quickly improved his level through other methods.</p>

    <p>However, in such a short period of time, how was this achieved?</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu's expression remained unchanged. The first test let him know Jingze's strength as a top electric dragon. The next moment, he directly stretched out his small hand, put his palm down in a half-crouching posture, and suddenly slapped it on the ground.</p>

    <p>There was a bang. The earth shook. Several elemental dragons rose into the sky from the ground. There was a loud noise all day long. The world began to shake.</p>

    <p>This scene made Jingze raise his eyebrows. This is too wasteful. It is a gameplay that does not take the consumption of spiritual power into consideration. Even a person who is defiant will still have a "blue bar" in modern terms. No. Possibility of unlimited use of skills.</p>

    <p>Therefore, in a duel between top players, each other will consider the issue of consumption during the battle, and will calculate the time. The corresponding abilities will be released at the appropriate time to drive the rhythm of the entire battle.</p>

    <p>Jingze also saw through this test. Wang Muyu's rich and powerful style of play. Although it means that this little guy has infinite spiritual power, it is also a sign of lack of combat experience.</p>

    <p>"Let him consume him. We will win." In Jingze's mind, a voice from the other side of the universe came. This was the voice of a familiar man. If Wang Ling was also present, he could easily hear it. The identity of this person.</p>

    <p>On the other side of the distant universe, a huge dragon body as large as a star is entrenched here. It is emitting holy moonlight and sends out instructions from the deep infinite galaxy.</p>

    <p>Remotely control Jingze. This is a kind of remote micro-control.</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe ended up. He did not hinder Bai Zhe's judgment. He also used his own means to provide support and assistance.</p>

    <p>In order to attract the attention of Wang Ling, he painstakingly planned this eternal game just to be able to bring Wang Muyu back. This is the most critical piece in his plan... and today, he chose to let Jingze take action. He personally took command. This is an attitude that is inevitable.</p>

    <p>With someone supporting him behind him, Jingze was of course fearless. He opened his black umbrella. And at this time, he activated another form of the black umbrella.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu's eyes were shocked. He didn't expect that the black umbrella actually had a "bow shape!" The moment the black umbrella opened, the ribs were rearranged under Jingze's control. It became a completely black umbrella, wrapped in black. Thunder bow and arrow!</p>

    <p>The umbrella handle was separated on the spot. The hook at the end rotated. It was perfectly placed on the bow string transformed by the black umbrella, and directly became a huge arrow.</p>

    <p>Endless thunder power jumps and surges on the bow and arrows, as if it has absorbed the thunder power of the entire universe.</p>

    <p>Then!</p>

    <p>Boom! There was a huge thunderous sound. It was suddenly launched from Jingze's hand. The bow and arrow formed by the black umbrella were extremely powerful. Wherever the roar passed, the space was shattered inch by inch. Even the inner wall of this core world suffered a huge blow. The impact started to shake.</p>

    <p>If it weren't for Bai Zhe's secret blessing, I'm afraid this core world would have collapsed.</p>

    <p>Amazing power. Huge arrows came across the sky from a distance. With a domineering momentum, they directly penetrated Wang Muyu and the summoned elemental dragon.</p>

    <p>Then, under the pull of Jingze's thunder, the thunder arrow returned to his hand in the blink of an eye, forming a kind of perpetual motion. It was like a bullet that could never be fired.</p>

    <p>The elemental dragons summoned by Wang Muyu were of all kinds, occupying the entire small world. However, Jingze used his black umbrella to transform into the form of a bow and arrow to defeat them one by one. This was something Wang Muyu did not expect.</p>

    <p>What made Wang Muyu even more horrified was that Jingze's arrow did not simply pierce the elemental dragon. In each recycling process, it seemed to absorb the elemental dragon itself. possess the power.</p>

    <p>These powers are like flowing water from a small spring. They are constantly superimposed on the arrow.</p>

    <p>When Wang Muyu saw Jingze's intention and wanted to withdraw the elemental dragon, it was already too late.</p>

    <p>Jingze, who had finished dealing with the last elemental dragon, was already aiming his arrow at Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>Then. Fully draw the bow. Release directly...</p>
