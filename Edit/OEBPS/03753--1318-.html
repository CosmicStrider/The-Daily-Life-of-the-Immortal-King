  <h1>Chapter 1318 Heavenly Dao signal shielding</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Lord Gray Mist is extremely fast.</p>

    <p>Digging the ground has always been his specialty.</p>

    <p>His claws can even break through the barriers of spiritual space. Not to mention this mere soil?</p>

    <p>Taking the Buddha Golden Lotus with him, Mr. Gray Mist evacuated at high speed.</p>

    <p>He quickly dug a tunnel and escaped to a place called the top of the sky in an instant.</p>

    <p>Then he pointed his claws into the void.</p>

    <p>That trace of chaotic power surged out from the tip of the claw, distorting time and space. It quickly broke through the space wall!</p>

    <p>Take the Buddha Golden Lotus and dive in in one step!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"This is..."</p>

    <p>The thing happened too suddenly. Lord Gray Mist, who suddenly broke into the underground retreat cellar, quickly disappeared on the spot with the Buddha Golden Lotus. Zhuo Yi and Death Heavenly Dao did not have time to react.</p>

    <p>"This is the groundhog Ling Zhenren dealt with..." Death Heavenly Dao frowned.</p>

    <p>"Senior, it seems like you didn't notice anything unusual?"</p>

    <p>"It can't be wrong. It must be his appearance that resonates with the restrictions on the earth, giving rise to the Heavenly Dao signal shielding." Death Heavenly Dao did not expect that such a thing would happen to him.</p>

    <p>In fact, it wasn't just him. Even Crispy Noodles Dao Lord didn't react.</p>

    <p>The "real clone" is also transformed by Heavenly Dao's spell.</p>

    <p>"It's so cunning. He actually used the restriction left by Dao Ancestor in reverse." Heavenly Dao secretly blamed himself.</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling appeared here.</p>

    <p>Because of "Heavenly Dao signal shielding."</p>

    <p>The breath of the prairie dog soon disappeared from the earth.</p>

    <p>After all, the tracking of Wang Ling was a step too late.</p>

    <p>When the opponent's Heavenly Dao signal is blocked, it is no longer realistic to use the Heavenly Dao spell to track.</p>

    <p>Even the monk's Buddha Golden Lotus was transformed by Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the possibility of asking a monk to locate the location of Buddha's Golden Lotus is slim.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling frowned.</p>

    <p>He must think of other ways to find Sun Rong as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>"Master. What should we do now?" Zhuo Yi was very anxious.</p>

    <p>It is his duty to protect the girl.</p>

    <p>But I didn't expect that this cunning groundhog would take advantage of a loophole!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's eyes were fixed on the position where Sun Rong disappeared. He carefully observed the two potholes that appeared on the cellar and poured his own strength into them.</p>

    <p>Line of sight. Quickly shuttle along the passage...</p>

    <p>But this groundhog is very cunning.</p>

    <p>During the escape process, he used the power of space movement many times to shuttle during the escape process.</p>

    <p>As a result, these tunnels became a maze-like mess.</p>

    <p>Everything Wang Ling could see was empty.</p>

    <p>Neither the prairie dog nor the Golden Lotus could be traced. There was no trace.</p>

    <p>However, it's not like there aren't any clues.</p>

    <p>In the many passages excavated by Lord Gray Mist, Wang Ling discovered the afterimage of the Buddha's Golden Lotus!</p>

    <p>"Is it the clue left by Ah Nuan?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling understood immediately.</p>

    <p>In the blink of an eye, the groundhog swept away the Buddha's Golden Lotus and fled quickly.</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan used the power of his Shadow to capture the shadow of Buddha Golden Lotus!</p>

    <p>If I hadn't learned Shadow long ago, I would never have been so sensitive to an afterimage.</p>

    <p>Ah Nuan. Another great achievement!</p>

    <p>Mr. Gray Mist thought he was taking advantage of the restriction left by Dao Ancestor and triggered the Heavenly Dao signal blocking mechanism, making Wang Ling unable to track him.</p>

    <p>But this groundhog never expected it.</p>

    <p>The great power he has mastered.</p>

    <p>There is more than one Heavenly Dao...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After the space jump, Mr. Gray Mist landed. His position was still at the top of the sky.</p>

    <p>But the girl felt that the space they were in now was different from before.</p>

    <p>"What have you done?" asked Buddha Sun Rong in the Golden Lotus.</p>

    <p>To be honest, the aura emanating from this prairie dog made her feel a sense of complete oppression.</p>

    <p>If it weren't for the Buddha's Golden Lotus body protection, Sun Rong felt that it would be difficult for him to withstand such pressure.</p>

    <p>"Your tone is neither humble nor arrogant. Aren't you afraid at all?"</p>

    <p>Mr. Gray Mist held the Buddha's Golden Lotus in his paws and sneered.</p>

    <p>"There's nothing to be afraid of."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong said: "I believe. Classmate Wang Ling will come to save me."</p>

    <p>"There's no way he's going to find you."</p>

    <p>Mr. Gray Mist clicked his tongue. He shook his head at the girl: "It seems that you haven't realized the seriousness of the problem yet."</p>

    <p>"What do you want to say, senior?" Sun Rong asked politely, frowning slightly.</p>

    <p>"Honestly, I did want to capture you at first, take you hostage, and then blackmail the screen-peeping dog into submission. But the moment I captured you, I changed my mind."</p>

    <p>The groundhog Jiejie sneered: "You are the son of the void, right? And because you have been resurrected too many times, you have triggered the restriction of Dao Ancestor. As a result, the sense of existence is gradually disappearing. That's why the monk made such a Golden Lotus. Will you His soul is sealed inside."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, the girl's expression was slightly startled.</p>

    <p>"Did I tell you right?"</p>

    <p>Mr. Gray Mist chuckled: "This monk's Golden Lotus has condensed his cultivation for a hundred generations. It can indeed be used to delay Dao Ancestor's resurrection ban, so that your sense of existence will not be reduced for the time being. And they. They only need to do it as soon as possible. Find a way to truly resurrect you. Let you return to your physical body. The resurrection ban will no longer be triggered."</p>

    <p>"Then, what else does senior know?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"I also know that the resurrection ban actually started the moment I caught you. It was restarted!"</p>

    <p>Lord Gray Mist said: "In order to limit my abilities, Dao Ancestor banned me from coming to earth to cause trouble. As long as I am on earth, all restrictions will be strengthened. Among them, this ban on resurrection is also included!"</p>

    <p>"Because of my existence. This resurrection ban has also been affected by my resonance. It has become stronger. The monk's Golden Lotus is currently ineffective."</p>

    <p>"You mean. My sense of existence will continue to disappear. Really?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>Mr. Gray Mist sighed: "When your sense of existence completely disappears, everyone who knows you on this earth will forget you! And I, as long as I carry you with me, will also be affected by you. Those who know My people will also forget me at the same time!"</p>

    <p>"I understand. Senior, you are scared of being beaten by your classmate Wang Ling. You are afraid that he will chase you!" The girl couldn't help laughing.</p>

    <p>"Shut up!"</p>

    <p>Mr. Gray Mist sneered: "Up to now, are you still pretending to be calm? You are such a tough-talking person!"</p>

    <p>It seemed that it was painfully poked by Sun Rong. The groundhog began to chatter and introduce the situation at hand to the girl.</p>

    <p>I want the girl to recognize the reality.</p>

    <p>"When your sense of existence completely disappears, you will cease to exist completely! By then, your life will be more painful than your death! Are you still delusional that that kid will come to save you?"</p>

    <p>Lord Gray Mist said: "And you haven't noticed yet? I took you across space."</p>

    <p>"Earth in one second?"</p>

    <p>"You can actually see that? That's right! This is the earth one second later! In other words, the space that the boy is in now is always one second different from ours. The space is different. Your sense of existence has completely disappeared. Even if you call Even if your throat is broken, no one will come to save you!"</p>

    <p>After Mr. Gray Mist finished speaking, he wanted to open his mouth and laugh. But the more he thought about it, the more he felt that something was wrong.</p>

    <p>That's not right!</p>

    <p>This girl is not particularly strong...</p>

    <p>How is it possible to see through his method of jumping through space?</p>

    <p>At this time, the groundhog discovered the blind spot!</p>
