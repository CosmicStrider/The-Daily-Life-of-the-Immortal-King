  <h1>Chapter 1547 A gathering of "upper-class students"</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Recruiting assistants is actually very critical.</p>

    <p>In the past, Wang Ming actually had many favorite candidates.</p>

    <p>But he never had the courage to recruit these people as his assistants.</p>

    <p>Because the research on sealing Talisman is a top-secret project developed privately by Wang Ming. If an unreliable person were to expose the matter, everything would be over.</p>

    <p>It is true. Whether it is Wang Ling's terrifying spell or Wang Ming's super brainwaves, they all have the ability to erase a person's memory.</p>

    <p>Or lay some kind of trap. Keep the secret forever.</p>

    <p>Once the secret is revealed, that person will die or something like that...</p>

    <p>But neither brother is such a cruel person.</p>

    <p>Researching this kind of project itself requires sincere cooperation. If there is no mutual trust, the final goal will not be achieved.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming actually struggled with the choice of assistant for several years.</p>

    <p>Ever since Wang Ling entered junior high school, he actually had an idea.</p>

    <p>But it is a pity that it has never been put into practice.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ming, the Internet celebrity citizen scientist mentioned by Wang Ling, has actually paid attention to it.</p>

    <p>There is some controversy in the field of cultivation science as to whether Shou Chong has real talent and practical knowledge.</p>

    <p>He attracted a lot of attention by recording videos of creating various weird gadgets and posting them online.</p>

    <p>What kind of essential oil facial applicator, automatic hair washing machine, automatic ice cream licker, etc...</p>

    <p>The technical content of these small inventions is very average. The main ones are Tu Yile.</p>

    <p>But no one thought that Shou Chong would become famous online with these gadgets. Then he attracted a large amount of investment from "Wang Duoyu."</p>

    <p>To put it bluntly.</p>

    <p>Whether Shou Chong has this ability or not is still unclear based on rumors and rumors from the outside world.</p>

    <p>After all, there are some people in every circle who are self-righteous and feel that their talents are not appreciated.</p>

    <p>When you see other people in the same circle getting angry, you will inevitably become a lemon and pick on that person.</p>

    <p>Many times there are rumors against some people on the Internet. Especially there are many things that have no evidence. Just take a look and laugh...</p>

    <p>No comment if the full picture is unknown. Those who believe in everything are fools.</p>

    <p>Of course, the most controversial thing about Shou Chong is not that he relies on these small inventions to attract investment.</p>

    <p>But many of the products he customized. In fact, some of them have design flaws. There are also many debates about safety accidents on the Internet.</p>

    <p>For example, Sun Rong's cousin Fan Xing... was launched from the building by Shou Chong's safety escape device. He didn't even care about landing!</p>

    <p>Fan Xing is still lying in the hospital like a mummy.</p>

    <p>My whole life is probably ruined.</p>

    <p>And here's the kicker. He won't die.</p>

    <p>Hanging on by a thread every day. It's so painful to live...</p>

    <p>High paraplegia prevented him from getting out of bed. He couldn't even jump from a building.</p>

    <p>Fan Xing wants his little brother to end his life.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, he lost his speech ability after the fall. He lay in bed crying every day and could not speak.</p>

    <p>He tried to use eye contact to tell his younger brother to give him a knife.</p>

    <p>It's a pity that the younger brother actually wiped away his tears and held his hand tightly: "Brother Xing! Don't worry! Modern cultivation medical technology is so advanced! You can always be cured!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Fan Xing is desperate!</p>

    <p>Treat a furball...he just wants to have a good time!</p>

    <p>Now Fan Xing. The thing I regret the most is when I went to Sun Rong's villa to cause trouble...</p>

    <p>If I had restrained myself, I probably wouldn't have gotten to this point.</p>

    <p>Heavenly Dao reincarnation. Those who do unrighteousness will surely die.</p>

    <p>Fan Xing didn't understand this until now.</p>

    <p>It's a pity. It's too late.</p>

    <p>Putting his thoughts back. Wang Ming is still thinking about Shou Chong.</p>

    <p>"Do you think this person is reliable?" Wang Ming asked, touching his chin.</p>

    <p>To be honest, I don't know whether Wang Ling is reliable or not.</p>

    <p>He just counted on his fingers. It was estimated that Wang Ming's subsequent research would be related to Shou Chong.</p>

    <p>"This man is a controversial figure in our community. And even if I do send an invitation. I wouldn't be listened to. My identity is strictly confidential. In the eyes of outsiders, I'm just an idiot." Wang Ming smiled.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, on Shou Chong's side. Actually, Wang Ming has always had an intuition.</p>

    <p>He felt that this old fox was pretending to be crazy and acting stupid most of the time.</p>

    <p>Whether it's those strange little inventions posted on the Internet or some subsequent safety incidents...</p>

    <p>There is a high probability that it was all the result of his planning.</p>

    <p>Take those security incidents, for example. All "victims" have some level of bad behavior.</p>

    <p>In a sense, it also means doing justice for heaven.</p>

    <p>However, the police could not do anything about Chong.</p>

    <p>Because when he signed the contract, Shou Chong actually had a stipulation that all safety issues that occurred after the boss confirmed the product acceptance had nothing to do with him.</p>

    <p>It's written in black and white.</p>

    <p>So what else can you do?</p>

    <p>It can only be treated as an accident and handed over to the insurance company.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Eh. It's really difficult!"</p>

    <p>In the girls' dormitory in Area S.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong and Zhai Yin are studying the 126-point dice cup technique that Wang Ling just performed.</p>

    <p>After all, she will have to communicate with others on behalf of Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>To deal with Ohno Dankaede's problem, we must do some research on the dice cup technique.</p>

    <p>The result was more difficult than Sun Rong imagined.</p>

    <p>"Wow...how on earth did classmate Wang Ling do it. He picked out the points alone and divided them into two halves..." Sun Rong was surprised.</p>

    <p>This requirement for precision is too high. That is to say, Wang Ling can still do it now that it is heavily sealed. It may not be possible at ordinary times.</p>

    <p>"If you are so curious, just go and ask your home Wang Ling." Zhai Yin couldn't help but tease.</p>

    <p>"Sister Yinzi made fun of me again..." Sun Rong blushed.</p>

    <p>In fact, these things are trivial to her. She can just do her own research.</p>

    <p>She cherishes every opportunity to talk to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Even if it's just communication through text messages or other messaging apps.</p>

    <p>There is nothing particularly urgent. She will never bother you without reason.</p>

    <p>"My classmate Wang Ling likes to be quiet. If I send him messages frequently, it will be annoying." Sun Rong laughed.</p>

    <p>Then she stared at the dice cup in front of her and fell into deep thought.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin looked at the girl with a serious look on her face. She couldn't help but sigh silently in her heart.</p>

    <p>This girl is so sensible that it makes people feel distressed...</p>

    <p>I just don't know how much longer I have to wait.</p>

    <p>It is said that it is a difficult process for a daughter-in-law to become a mother-in-law. But I don't know why after seeing what happened with Sun Rong and Wang Ling. Zhai Yin suddenly felt that the hardship was nothing...</p>

    <p>The 126-point dice cup method. Wang Ling uses the spiritual power on the fingertips.</p>

    <p>Regarding this point, Sun Rong feels that it may be difficult for him to imitate.</p>

    <p>But if combined with Sword's method, it might be possible.</p>

    <p>She stared at the dice cup in her hand for a while. She felt that she seemed to have a way to crack it.</p>

    <p>Although there are some new approaches.</p>

    <p>But it is still a path after all.</p>

    <p>And the key point is that Ohno Dankaede is also a Sword master. So his method may make it easier for Ohno Dankaede to accept it.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Developing Ohno Dankaede into the deputy director of the Jiudaohe Gray Cult branch. This matter was also carefully considered by Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>She pretended to be Jiugong Liangzi and suddenly participated in the competition. This move should have shocked many people in the Jiugong family.</p>

    <p>Although there is no special movement yet, Sun Rong has a premonition that it will not be too long before the storm comes.</p>

    <p>What is important in this situation now is to confirm your identity.</p>

    <p>As the leader of Gray Cult, all the Gray Cult believers in Jiudaohe can actually provide a good cover for her plan to disguise herself as Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>The reason why we value Ohno Dankaede so highly is mainly due to his overall combat capability.</p>

    <p>Compared to Jisaki, Ohno Dankaede, who is proficient in Sword, is actually more powerful in combat than him.</p>

    <p>Besides. Just like Jisaki said.</p>

    <p>Ohno Dankaede and the Rainbow Seven Gang. As a candidate for the branch president of the Purple Maple Club, it is easier to act than them.</p>

    <p>Then a mature management system was established in the Jiudaohe Gray Cult branch.</p>

    <p>Jisaki is responsible for command and communication, Ma Jiao is responsible for Internet layout and statistics, and Ohno Dankaede can be responsible for protection and instigating rebellion...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong holds Ohno Dankaede in such high regard. It's not without reason.</p>

    <p>What's more important is that Ohno Dankaede passed Aohai's sword energy recognition.</p>

    <p>Although in today's final round of the five-person selection.</p>

    <p>He made things extremely difficult for Wang Ling. He even set a trap.</p>

    <p>But in fact, his nature is not bad... and he is actually a person with high emotional intelligence.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Ohno Dankaede's actual actions did not disappoint Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>The current opinion from Jisaki and Ma Jiao is to let him arrange moles within the Rainbow Seven Gang to split them from within.</p>

    <p>In order to complete this plan.</p>

    <p>After Ohno Dankaede joined the church, his next step was naturally to find a brother with whom he had a good relationship to join the church.</p>

    <p>And the first person he thought of was... Lan Mao, who had previously fought against Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He is the president of Lanyan Association.</p>

    <p>Under the current situation of the Rainbow Seven Gang being united, and with Lan Mao's identity as the president, there is almost no information that cannot be uncovered.</p>

    <p>Lan Yan Club branch office. Lan Mao sat in his seat in a daze.</p>

    <p>He kicked everyone else out of the office.</p>

    <p>Because Lan Mao doesn't want others to see his absent-minded look...</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that the reason for his loss of consciousness is not because of...</p>

    <p>It's actually for Houlang Sang...</p>

    <p>After he fought against Wang Ling, he has been reflecting on that battle.</p>

    <p>He remembered that he was obviously injured due to backlash during the battle.</p>

    <p>But when he came out of coma, he didn't feel any discomfort at all.</p>

    <p>Even if the referee ball didn't release the healing spray, he won't be able to see any injuries!</p>

    <p>Ohno Dankaede opened the office door. When he saw Lan Mao's appearance, he couldn't help but smile.</p>

    <p>Sure enough!</p>

    <p>Everything was just as he thought.</p>

    <p>It seems that everyone who has played against Houlang Sang will probably be conquered by Houlang Sang's personality charm...</p>

    <p>"Brother Lu looks very distressed."</p>

    <p>Ohno Dankaede opened the door and walked in with a smile. Lan Mao thought it was the blind member again. He was about to open his mouth and scold the person away. When he saw the person coming, he closed his mouth.</p>

    <p>Ohno Dankaede likes to add the character "brother" after his last name for people he knows well or respects him.</p>

    <p>It doesn't matter if the person opposite you is older or younger than you.</p>

    <p>That's what he calls.</p>

    <p>This will make you appear closer.</p>

    <p>When Lan Mao saw Ohno Dankaede coming over, he didn't say anything. He didn't even ask, "What are you doing here?"</p>

    <p>And Ohno Dankaede didn't regard himself as an outsider. He sat directly in the vice president's seat and looked at him: "I guess Brother Lu is thinking about Houlang Sang."</p>

    <p>His mind was exposed. Lan Mao wanted to refute, but he opened his mouth and closed it again.</p>

    <p>Indeed...</p>

    <p>As a straight man, he kept thinking about a man in his mind.</p>

    <p>It's a bit hard to talk about this kind of thing.</p>

    <p>What should I do if someone misunderstands my sexual orientation?</p>

    <p>"What else do you know?"</p>

    <p>Lan Mao didn't deny it. He just stared at Ohno Dankaede.</p>

    <p>"Brother Lu should also feel this way."</p>

    <p>"?"</p>

    <p>"It's the feeling after playing against Houlang Sang. I'm really looking forward to competing with him again."</p>

    <p>Lan Mao's pupils contracted and he almost became energetic all of a sudden.</p>

    <p>He was troubled for a long time. No one knew what he was thinking.</p>

    <p>The result was disastrous. In the end, his good brother Ohno Dankaede came to look for him.</p>

    <p>When Lan Mao heard this, he couldn't help but sigh: "Yes... he is a magical man. He looks weak, but he seems to be very strong. There is a sense of mystery..."</p>

    <p>After saying that, he couldn't help but smile bitterly.</p>

    <p>"It's a pity. I may not have the chance to fight Houlang Sang again."</p>

    <p>"I don't think so."</p>

    <p>Ohno Dankaede smiled and said: "I have a way here. I can help Brother Lu deepen the relationship with Houlang Sang."</p>

    <p>"I know. You mean Gray Cult?"</p>

    <p>"You actually knew?"</p>

    <p>"After I came back, I actually checked some things about Houlang Sang. Of course, I didn't check it out of any malicious intent. It was just out of admiration..." Lan Mao said: "But I don't seem to have enough Chinese language skills for Gray Cult's admission standards. My grades are too bad."</p>

    <p>"It doesn't matter."</p>

    <p>Ohno Dankaede said: "As long as Brother Lu is willing, I can help Brother Lu apply for special approval first, and then give you tutoring. As long as you meet the standard in the monthly exam."</p>

    <p>"Is this okay?"</p>

    <p>"Of course." Ohno Dankaede nodded.</p>

    <p>He looked at Lan Mao, showing the same look in his eyes that he had withdrawn from when Jisaki asked him before.</p>

    <p>"So Brother Lu, are you ready to join the religion?"</p>

    <p>Lan Mao stood up immediately.</p>

    <p>He looked very excited.</p>

    <p>"I! Always ready!"</p>

    <p>"Well, Brother Lu, you are welcome to join the gang! Next, I want to ask you about the current situation of the gang..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>About ten minutes later, Sun Rong received the information from Jisaki.</p>

    <p>The information was obtained after Ohno Dankaede communicated with Lan Mao.</p>

    <p>The current plan of several other gang presidents in the Rainbow Seven Gang is to organize a gathering of "upper-class students" that only students from District S can participate in. Then they invite Wang Ling there.</p>

    <p>I haven't read the invitation yet. Sun Rong suddenly laughed.</p>

    <p>Upper class?</p>

    <p>How classy can it be?</p>

    <p>Show off your family's financial resources. Or show off your customized spiritual sword or magic weapon?</p>

    <p>From childhood to adulthood. Sun Rong has seen too many scenes.</p>

    <p>What battles have I not seen before...</p>

    <p>She immediately lamented the naivety of this group of people.</p>

    <p>I thought the student union in Jiudaohe District S was planning some big conspiracy or something. I didn't expect it to be just like this...</p>

    <p>It's a party full of souvenir style. In fact, Sun Rong didn't even bother to take a look.</p>

    <p>"Instructions for the banquet. You must bring a valuable magic weapon to show up. It is really the behavior of a child." Zhai Yin couldn't help but laugh when he saw the invitation.</p>

    <p>"As expected..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong support amount.</p>

    <p>Is it a magic weapon...?</p>

    <p>If classmate Wang Ling took a piece of shit and enlightened it. It could probably smash those people's magic treasures to pieces...</p>
