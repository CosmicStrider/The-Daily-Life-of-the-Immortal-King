  <h1>Chapter 1203 The real mouth escape</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After two rounds, Chen Chao seemed to have just been beaten. His face was swollen into a pig's head. His whole body was covered in bruises. Even the upper body of his school uniform had been smashed by Zhu Hanyun's fists.</p>

    <p>{Luanyuliu} is a high-density and high-speed boxing technique. The damage caused is unbelievable. However, under the continuous fierce attacks, Zhu Hanyun was not completely without losses. After two rounds of one-sided attacks. His aura is already a little unstable. Boxing techniques like {Chaos Rain Flow} that extremely test battery life and consumption. I wish Han Yun would not be able to use it a second time in a short period of time.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that Zhu Hanyun actually still has concerns and has not completely let go.</p>

    <p>Considering that if he can advance to the next round, Zhu Hanyun also wants to preserve some physical and spiritual power for the next round of fighting.</p>

    <p>He thought that his move {Chaos Rain} was enough to trigger Chen Chao's golden protective talisman. But unfortunately, the situation did not develop according to his path.</p>

    <p>Although the current Chen Chao seems to have reached his limit. Maybe he can trigger the golden protective talisman with just one ordinary punch. However, the game is a game. There can be no chance.</p>

    <p>Zhu Hanyun felt that he still made a miscalculation when facing Chen Chao. If he had not taken the subsequent games into consideration when he used {Chaos Rain} in the second round, but concentrated on dealing with the current situation, Chen Chao would have been beaten long ago. disuse.</p>

    <p>But it's a pity. There is never if in this world.</p>

    <p>"I have studied martial arts under the guidance of my father since I was a child. I grew up with brothers and sisters from all walks of life! If you want to bring me down, I'm afraid it won't be that easy!" Chen Chao wiped the blood seeping from the corner of his mouth. Although his teeth It has been broken. But this injury may be nothing to Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Previously, in order to write an essay, I read through the memories of Chen Chao's childhood. The resilience in Chen Chao's bones is really inherited from his ancestors. Fighting across levels is commonplace. If the people you practice with since childhood have always been 2 points higher than you on average. -3 levels. Maybe it can be trained to be so durable.</p>

    <p>Therefore, such a man will not fall down just because he wants to.</p>

    <p>Judging from this characteristic, Chen Chao and Wang Zhen are actually somewhat similar.</p>

    <p>The difference is that Chen Chao was forced to "get beaten" because he practiced with others. Wang Zhen has actively accepted all kinds of training since he was a child... and even had to beat himself.</p>

    <p>So Wang Zhen, who was watching the game from the outside at this time, saw Chen Chao's perseverance and couldn't help but sigh in his heart: This is a talent that can be created!</p>

    <p>While Chen Chao was talking, Zhu Hanyun quickly adjusted his breathing. As the captain of Titan High School, even if he could not help the school win the game in the end, he would never lose to an ordinary representative of Number 60 High School. in hand.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Chen Chao. Why are you doing this?"</p>

    <p>Zhu Hanyun showed a helpless expression on his face: "You should make better use of your body-protecting golden light. Rely on your resilience to stay in the game. It will only be bad for you. Although the chaotic rain I just made is still there The hand did not directly attack your vital acupuncture points, but it sealed multiple of your acupuncture points at the same time... You should be unable to use your spiritual power now. In the state of being sealed by me, you have no chance of winning. It's better. Surrender early."</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the scene started to boil again.</p>

    <p>"Chen Chao has been sealed?" Guo Hao frowned deeply.</p>

    <p>Sealing a spirit is like tapping an acupuncture point. Although it is only temporary, if a cultivator is spirit-sealed during a battle, it is definitely a taboo.</p>

    <p>Listening to Zhu Hanyun's words, Chen Chao gritted his teeth and said, "Even if it's Feng Ling, it's not that easy for you to defeat me. Maybe you can help me open up some of the Rendu and Dumai vessels. Let me become Stronger!"</p>

    <p>Zhu Hanyun immediately sneered after hearing this: "Joke. Do you think such a thing can happen to you?"</p>

    <p>In the process of one party receiving a unilateral beating, there is indeed a possibility that the acupoints will be opened again. However, this probability is extremely low. It is almost the same as winning the lottery.</p>

    <p>However, in the third round. This time it was Chen Chao who took the lead!</p>

    <p>Even in a state of being injured all over.</p>

    <p>In this attack, Chen Chao's speed and strength have not weakened at all. He actually looks bigger than before! Even though he has been sealed, he can still show such powerful explosive power!</p>

    <p>Zhu Hanyun looked at Chen Chao's burning gaze in disbelief. His face was full of disbelief: "This is impossible!"</p>

    <p>"Existence is reasonable. Nothing is impossible." Chen Chao punched Zhu Hanyun hard in the face. To everyone's surprise, the {Titan Kung Fu} practiced by Zhu Hanyun did not seem to Make a difference in this moment.</p>

    <p>With Chen Chao's punch, Zhu Han Yun flew out like a kite with its strings broken. He landed heavily on the ground, leaving only a shallow crater.</p>

    <p>"What on earth is going on?" Xia Ming on the side said puzzled: "Zhu Hanyun's Titan Skill has reached a certain level. It weighs several thousand kilograms. There is no way it can be bounced away so easily."</p>

    <p>Everyone turned their attention to Yan Xiaochun, the junior sister who was congratulating Han Yun. They saw the girl pursed her lips and looked anxious. Many people realized that Chen Chao might have accidentally broken some life gate of Taitan Gong.</p>

    <p>Just when many people were guessing what happened. Wang Ling had already seen through the answers to the questionnaire.</p>

    <p>For a practitioner of physical arts, the meaning of sealing one's spirit is actually of little significance, because martial arts and physical arts rely more on one's own "Qi", which is Qigong.</p>

    <p>The reason why Zhu Hanyun pays so much attention to maintaining his spiritual power is largely because of the {Titan Technique} he practices. When his spiritual power is full, Zhu Hanyun, who has practiced the {Titan Technique}, is like a bird full of energy. A balloon of Qi. The physical body is full of tension! The density of the physical body will also increase with the exercises. It will look indestructible and as heavy as Mount Tai.</p>

    <p>However, once his spiritual power is consumed, Zhu Hanyun's weight will also decrease. This is like a balloon deflating. The consequences of weight loss will naturally cause the physical density to be far less dense than before.</p>

    <p>That's why Zhu Han Yun's body was shaken so easily after he took a punch from Chen Chao...</p>

    <p>According to normal circumstances, if it is just an ordinary punch, of course it cannot be done.</p>

    <p>"Where does your strength come from..."</p>

    <p>Zhu Hanyun got up from the ground. He was still trying to recover his spiritual power. At the same time, he was surprised by the strength of the punch that Chen Chao had just punched him.</p>

    <p>"Didn't I say it? Your {Ranyuliu} boxing technique seems to have really stimulated my body. I feel like all the cells in my body are boiling now. There is a steady stream of power pouring out..." Chen Chao's expression More excited.</p>

    <p>Zhu Han Yun's figure swayed when he heard these words.</p>

    <p>Wipe...</p>

    <p>Did he meet the legendary mouth escape master?</p>
