  <h1>Chapter 1244 The Key to the Void Gate</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"You're quite ruthless."</p>

    <p>In the vast spiritual space like the universe. Wang Ling's voice echoed.</p>

    <p>"I don't allow this place to be tainted by anyone." Wang Ying's voice was cold. He turned around and his whole person turned into a black shadow and merged again with Wang Ling's spiritual space.</p>

    <p>He kills decisively.</p>

    <p>In terms of character, Wang Ling considers himself far inferior to Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ying is his shadow, his personality is very different from his.</p>

    <p>The slap that Wang Ying just slapped on Xu Ling. Wang Ling named it {Six Kin Disrecognition Palm}.</p>

    <p>He felt.</p>

    <p>This fits Wang Ying's personality very well.</p>

    <p>If Wang Ling took action. He might not kill this ethereal spirit.</p>

    <p>Because Wang Ling would not take a small bug seriously. The blockade of the mental space actually gave Wang Ling good conditions to play with this newly captured "bug."</p>

    <p>But it is a pity that the situation is urgent now. There is not so much time left for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Although this virtual spirit was beaten to death by Wang Ying, at least Wang Ling has learned the reason why the virtual spirit wants to invade the earth.</p>

    <p>"To find the key."Wang Ling touched his chin and thought carefully about what the virtual spirit said.</p>

    <p>No one has ever truly opened the Gate of the Void. Since ancient times, those who cross the border will surely die.</p>

    <p>Master Li Xiaokai and Li Huanran even paid the price with their lives for this.</p>

    <p>If the whole events are connected together. Wang Ling feels that there may be such a possibility.</p>

    <p>That is, the Void Spirit may have had thoughts about the earth a long time ago. But it is a pity that they cannot open the door to the void themselves.</p>

    <p>The former master Li Xiaokai broke through the gate of the void and unintentionally opened a gap. In fact, that was the signal for the invasion of ethereal spirits.</p>

    <p>Some ethereal spirits flowed out from the gap.</p>

    <p>But it is a pity that just relying on this small number of ethereal spirits is not enough to achieve the goal of invading the earth.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Void Spirit must look for the so-called "Son of the Void." Let the Son of the Void serve as the key to completely open the door of the Void.</p>

    <p>Although the above are just inferences from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But generally speaking, Wang Ling thinks it is reasonable.</p>

    <p>He edited this guess into text and sent it to Zhuo Yi. Just leave the rest to Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>This virtual spirit claimed to be an advanced creature, but was destroyed by Wang Ying with two slaps... Wang Ling felt that the master behind this virtual spirit may not be that strong.</p>

    <p>Teacher Liu's incident caused quite a chaos in Number 60 High School. Fortunately, except for Teacher Liu, no other people in Number 60 High School were found to have been invaded by my virtual spirit.</p>

    <p>When Principal Chen arrived, Teacher Liu had already been controlled by epidemic prevention personnel.</p>

    <p>He wanted to step forward to see Teacher Liu's condition, but was stopped by an epidemic prevention officer: "Principal Chen, please stop looking... You have less hair. If it gets infected, then it's okay."</p>

    <p>"Why did you suddenly go berserk?" Principal Chen couldn't understand.</p>

    <p>"The reactions in other places are similar, but not as severe as Mr. Liu's. It is said to be an exaggerated reaction between the virus and the reagent, which has a certain irritation to the human body. It depends on each person's acceptance," the staff member said.</p>

    <p>"How many cases have been confirmed now?" Principal Chen asked with concern.</p>

    <p>The epidemic prevention personnel used telepathy to answer: "Currently, there are more than 1,200 confirmed cases in Songhai City and 3,678 suspected cases. But fortunately, there don't seem to be many in other places. It is more serious in our city."</p>

    <p>This telepathy was intercepted by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>So on the way back to class. Wang Ling came up with a new idea.</p>

    <p>Judging from the report just reported by the epidemic prevention personnel, the number of virtual spirits invading the earth is still very limited at this stage, and most of them are gathered in Songhai City.</p>

    <p>So does this mean that Void Spirit has actually locked the general scope of the Son of the Void?</p>

    <p>This legendary son of the void.</p>

    <p>Maybe it's within the limits of Songhai City.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"As expected of Master."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi over there. I quickly received the message from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He admired the clarity of Wang Ling's inference.</p>

    <p>However, this inference still needs evidence to support it. Those who have been tested have been sent to quarantine as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>After the incident involving Teacher Liu, it served as a great warning to Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan immortal and Crispy Noodles Dao Lord teamed up to draw the "Sealing Talisman." The moment someone was detected, the seal was immediately carried out.</p>

    <p>Then they were sent directly into the space isolation cage they arranged. This directly blocked the possibility of these virtual spirits trying to jump out of their bodies to find new hosts.</p>

    <p>The situation seems to be under control.</p>

    <p>But most Zhuo Yi is clear. The battle has actually just begun.</p>

    <p>If the Son of the Void cannot be found first and the Void Spirit is found first, once the Gate of the Void opens, it will be a huge disaster for the entire earth.</p>

    <p>Although more than 1,200 cases have been found now, this is certainly not the entire number of virtual spirits. Their learning ability is very strong. They will definitely take precautions after the first round of storms. They will no longer be as easily deceived as they are now.</p>

    <p>"About the Son of the Void. Do you have anything to say?" Zhuo Yi asked Keorn in the car rushing to the frontline epidemic prevention station.</p>

    <p>"In fact, I am not the only investigator sent out to investigate this matter. But now it seems that I may be the only one who survives... The Foundation must have identified some clues. Unless we can directly find someone from the Foundation. Otherwise, our current organization to search for the Son of the Void would be like finding a needle in a haystack." Keorn said.</p>

    <p>While talking, he looked at Zhuo Yi's phone several times out of the corner of his eye...</p>

    <p>I marveled at the wisdom of the person who sent a text message to Zhuo Yi. He caught the void spirit with his bare hands. He also asked about the true purpose of the void invasion.</p>

    <p>This is simply unbelievable to Keorn.</p>

    <p>Who is this person?</p>

    <p>It's too strong...</p>

    <p>"It seems that this matter is becoming more and more troublesome. Moreover, we are now in trouble." At this time, Zhuo Yi was driving and looking in the rearview mirror. It was right behind their Wuling Hongguang van. There was a black car following them.</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan immortal and Crispy Noodles Dao Lord were both on the front line at this time assisting in the work of suppressing the virtual spirits. He and Keorn were the only two people in the car.</p>

    <p>"The opponent is very strong." From the passenger seat, Keorn sensed it from a distance. He felt that he might not be able to cope with the situation in front of him just relying on the combat power of him and Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>According to Keorn's judgment, the person sitting in the black car behind this is undoubtedly a scavenger.</p>

    <p>"It's them! Revenge for Snake is here!"</p>

    <p>Just as he finished speaking, Zhuo Yi saw a black shadow suddenly jump out of the sunroof in the rearview mirror.</p>

    <p>The opponent's jumping ability was amazing. He jumped directly above their van...and then stretched out his neck. He was half-lying on the windshield, looking at them with his head hanging upside down!</p>

    <p>What frightened Keorn was...</p>

    <p>This person is clearly not Snake.</p>

    <p>But it smells exactly like Snake!</p>
