  <h1>Chapter 1530 Kill Sun Rong</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"How could Ma Jiao..." Jisaki looked at the scene in the central control room with horror in his eyes.</p>

    <p>He suddenly remembered that Ma Jiao, as the vice president of the student union, had actually participated in the internal layout work at the beginning of the design of the secret room.</p>

    <p>Although the Jiudaohe secret room is designed symmetrically, in order to facilitate the staff to go to and from each secret room for prop inspection, there are actually secret doors that only the staff know about.</p>

    <p>These secret doors are unlocked through facial recognition technology.</p>

    <p>When Ma Jiao is familiar with the map of the secret room, it is not difficult for her to quickly find the location of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"You have to stop!" In desperation, Jisaki has turned on the call button in the central control room, intending to report the emergency and temporarily suspend the secret room challenge.</p>

    <p>As a result, Wang Ming directly used brain waves. He turned the call button back on with a nonchalant look on his face.</p>

    <p>"Xiaoer-san..."</p>

    <p>There was some confusion in Jisaki's eyes.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said helplessly: "It doesn't matter. Jiucai, we can just watch the show."</p>

    <p>"But classmate Ma Jiao, wasn't she severely objectified by ghosts..."</p>

    <p>What Jisaki knows now is actually incomplete.</p>

    <p>If you knew the true strength of Sun Rong and Wang Ling, I'm afraid you wouldn't be so surprised.</p>

    <p>But it is not convenient for Wang Ming to elaborate on these things at the moment.</p>

    <p>It took Sun Rong so long to get into the core of Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Jisaki has only just appeared on the scene. How could there be so many things going on in a showdown with Jisaki all at once?</p>

    <p>Now, some of the situations that Jisaki knows are already the limit that Wang Ming can give.</p>

    <p>Although I don't quite understand Wang Ming's attitude.</p>

    <p>But Jisaki felt that Xiaoer Sang, Rong Jiang, Houlang Sang... these three people from Number 60 High School in front of him seemed to be no ordinary people.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, you don't need to understand things that you shouldn't know.</p>

    <p>Just pretend to be dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>So. Jisaki covered his eyes.</p>

    <p>He covered his ears by the way.</p>

    <p>"What are you doing?" Wang Ming asked.</p>

    <p>"See no evil, hear no evil..." Jisaki replied.</p>

    <p>In fact, he can obviously still hear it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming smiled.</p>

    <p>Jisaki looks stupid. But in such a complicated environment of Jiudaohe, there are still two reasons why he can take the position of president of the Jiudaohe student union.</p>

    <p>There is indeed some great wisdom and foolishness in it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming knows that Jisaki's current wish is to serve as Gray Cult director.</p>

    <p>Judging from the current performance.</p>

    <p>This little guy does have a future...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Ma Jiao's death drama continues.</p>

    <p>Kill Sun Rong...Kill Sun Rong...</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao was holding a skull-crushing hammer in her hand. It was as if there were ten thousand barrages floating through her mind. These words kept echoing.</p>

    <p>There was something obviously wrong with her state. She looked haggard both physically and mentally. Her eyes were dull and her cheeks were deeply sunken.</p>

    <p>There is a black air all over my body...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong clearly knew that Ma Jiao was a cultivator who was used by Akano Sekitora for the first ghost transformation experiment. And the situation in front of him was not difficult to determine. Ma Jiao was affected by the ghost in his body.</p>

    <p>As Akano Sekitora's first test subject.</p>

    <p>The ghost in the body cannot be the same as Jiugong Xinghui. It is in a state of checks and balances under a contract.</p>

    <p>Once your mentality is out of control, you are likely to be counterattacked by the ghosts in your body.</p>

    <p>The moment the Skull Crusher attacked. Sun Rong thought of many things in his mind.</p>

    <p>However, she never released Aohai's sword energy to fight back directly. Instead, she used the passive ability of "human and sword unity" to enhance her six senses.</p>

    <p>At the moment when his perception was increased, Sun Rong could clearly notice that all the movements of Ma Jiao in front of him seemed to have become much slower.</p>

    <p>The increase in perception brought about by the power of "the unity of man and sword" is extremely powerful.</p>

    <p>Especially for capturing dynamic visuals.</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao's movements seemed crazy and precise. But in Sun Rong's eyes, it was like a slow motion being played.</p>

    <p>An easy sideways jump.</p>

    <p>There was a bang! The skull-crushing hammer hit the wall of the secret room hard.</p>

    <p>The wall collapsed instantly. A lot of wall dust fell off.</p>

    <p>"Rokume Akahoko, please wake up!" Sun Rong tried to call Ma Jiao's real name, trying to awaken her own will.</p>

    <p>She knew that Ma Jiao could not be entirely blamed for this situation.</p>

    <p>In essence, Ma Jiao is also a victim.</p>

    <p>After dodging several attacks in succession, Ma Jiao held a skull-crushing hammer. It had already damaged several places.</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Ying'er, who had been hiding in secret observation, finally couldn't help but speak: "Rongrong, this is not the way to go. This secret room is almost smashed. If it is forced to stop, we may be implicated. I Look, it's better to be knocked unconscious..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong frowned.</p>

    <p>In fact, she hasn't thought of a better way to deal with it.</p>

    <p>"There is nothing we can do. Classmate Rokume Akahoko...is offended." Sun Rong said softly. He was about to step forward and follow Sun Ying'er's suggestion to temporarily knock Ma Jiao out.</p>

    <p>At this time, a series of sounds of the walls shattering suddenly came from the air.</p>

    <p>It seems like something is flying towards me in the distance...</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>An iron door came through the air.</p>

    <p>That's the iron gate that was kicked by Wang Ling before...</p>

    <p>It suddenly flew through the wall from the side. It was like a nail. It hit Ma Jiao's waist directly and nailed Ma Jiao to the wall...</p>

    <p>"It's classmate Wang Ling..." Sun Rong reacted almost immediately.</p>

    <p>Only Wang Ling. has such strange power.</p>

    <p>It has obviously been sealed multiple times.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling still showed his impressive strength.</p>

    <p>"My classmate Wang Ling must have figured out that I was in danger. The force of this kick was so precise!" Sun Rong admired in his heart.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, just when she was hesitant, Wang Ling came to help her again.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't realize that his kick had accidentally reached Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>He had obviously kicked very lightly. He really just used a little bit of force.</p>

    <p>But that kick just gave him a measure of strength.</p>

    <p>At least let him know that the next time he punches or kicks, he must not exceed that level.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, people will definitely die.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao was nailed to the wall by the door panel. She almost lost consciousness instantly.</p>

    <p>The black air on her body dissipated.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong knew that Ma Jiao should have calmed down again by now.</p>

    <p>Before leaving, she released a healing sword energy on Ma Jiao. It had a slow healing effect.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Ma Jiao. I'm sorry. I can't stay here any longer... Just take care of yourself." After saying that, Sun Rong hurriedly entered the next secret room.</p>

    <p>Because the scene just now was too chaotic, the key found earlier was completely missing.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong Without saying a word, he drew his sword and opened the door to the Second Sword Secret Room.</p>

    <p>"..." Sun Ying'er added.</p>

    <p>It's still a split door after all...</p>

    <p>The props team would have cried if they'd seen that mess.</p>

    <p>"Rongrong. We've been delayed too long!" Sun Ying'er reminded.</p>

    <p>"I know." Sun Rong nods.</p>

    <p>It's not the time to play secret rooms anymore.</p>

    <p>She promised to meet up with Wang Ling at the end of the day.</p>

    <p>So Jiudaohe secret room. She must pass!</p>

    <p>"What do you want to do?" Sun Ying'er asked.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong smiled shyly, "Of course. Then split the door!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Anyway, we've already split one. A few more shouldn't hurt."</p>

    <p>"..." Sun Ying'er.</p>

    <p>She understood the reasoning... But the secret room. Is that how it is played?</p>
