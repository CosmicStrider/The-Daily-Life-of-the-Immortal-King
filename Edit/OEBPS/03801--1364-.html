  <h1>Chapter 1364: Memorial after death</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The probability of the appearance of imaginary creatures in the void is very small. Generally speaking, there is no need to pay special attention to it, because the appearance of these imaginary creatures is just a "brain supplement" made by some void creatures with strong obsessions.</p>

    <p>Although this kind of "imagination" will be reflected in reality, it is like a dream. It will disappear once you wake up.</p>

    <p>It's like a "mirage" seen by many people.</p>

    <p>But such a strong obsession is even Sun Ying'er's first time to see it.</p>

    <p>In the old Void Lord records that she knew, there had never been an "imaginary creature" made up by the Void Spirit that could move in reality for more than thirty seconds.</p>

    <p>And the duration of Bai Zhe was beyond imagination...</p>

    <p>Such obsession is frightening.</p>

    <p>"He should appear again in the future..." Sun Ying'er was very curious.</p>

    <p>"Maybe." Wang Ying nodded and replied.</p>

    <p>"I'm curious. What makes him have such a deep obsession." Sun Ying'er was puzzled.</p>

    <p>"He is not the protagonist, but he pretends to be the protagonist. This is the saddest thing about Bai Zhe." Wang Ying said.</p>

    <p>"Is it the obsession to become the protagonist?"</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er found it a bit ridiculous: "So. This is also the reason why he didn't recognize Wang Ling after he made up his mind?"</p>

    <p>"He has been killed many times by his master. Since he appears in the form of a brain-filling, he naturally imagines himself as an invincible figure... After all, he has made himself into a protagonist. He will never imagine memories that are not good for him. So, in his sense of self, he is invincible."</p>

    <p>"Last question! Why would he imagine himself as a dead person?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ying replied: "There is also a basic law for brainstorming. The dead will not disturb the order. It would be interesting if he could act against nature that day and turn himself into the leader of the order through brainstorming. So, maybe he will do it again in the future. Use the identities of other deceased people to appear. We must be prepared. You must also protect Miss Sun at all times."</p>

    <p>Obviously he doesn't have much role, but he forcibly pretends to be the "protagonist."</p>

    <p>Every time, Bai Zhe thought he was invincible. However, he was killed repeatedly.</p>

    <p>There is no doubt. This is a tragic figure.</p>

    <p>"Yeah. I can!"</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er nodded: "But can you lift my restrictions..."</p>

    <p>"No." Wang Ying rejected Sun Ying'er's request.</p>

    <p>"Why!"</p>

    <p>"No reason. Because I don't want to."</p>

    <p>When Wang Ying said this, he took advantage of the situation and grabbed Sun Ying'er's hands, pressed them against a wall, and leaned his face towards her.</p>

    <p>The distance was so close that Sun Ying'er could hear Wang Ying's breathing.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er: "Pervert..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying sneered: "At night. 200 times. Don't forget."</p>

    <p>After that, Wang Ying let go of Sun Ying'er and took Zhao Qingxian with him, turning into a black shadow and dissipating on the spot...</p>

    <p>"That annoying guy...he works so hard every time..."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er grunted in frustration and rubbed his painful wrist.</p>

    <p>Just as I was about to return to Sun Rong, I suddenly heard a loud "boom" from behind!</p>

    <p>Because Wang Ying just passed by.</p>

    <p>The outer wall behind her actually collapsed!</p>

    <p>This is the outer wall of the villa and manor. It is a thousand meters apart.</p>

    <p>Now a wall collapsed, creating a domino effect. The thousand-meter wall began to collapse one after another...</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er was shocked inside.</p>

    <p>After that, she understood a truth.</p>

    <p>That is: Never let a man with a higher level than you touch you...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, in the Wang family's small villa, Zhao Qingxian was dragged here by Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>Death penalty can be avoided, but living crime cannot be forgiven. Choosing to join Yang Shuangji's camp is already a big mistake.</p>

    <p>If it weren't for his infatuation with Liu Qingyi, I'm afraid Zhao Qingxian wouldn't even have his ashes left.</p>

    <p>"Zhenren, spare your life! I didn't join on purpose! I...I have admired Qingyi for a long time. But after I came to Earth, I was inexplicably taken into the detention center..." When Zhao Qingxian said this, his eyes were filled with tears. Tears are rolling.</p>

    <p>He didn't know why this happened.</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian knew very well that he couldn't hide anything at all, so he simply confessed everything.</p>

    <p>The causes and consequences of everything. Wang Ling has been read in Zhao Qingxian's mind.</p>

    <p>Overall, Zhao Qingxian is quite honest.</p>

    <p>Moreover, Zhao Qingxian cannot be entirely blamed for being admitted to the detention center.</p>

    <p>He was assigned by the head of the Zhao family to befriend him in the lower world. Unexpectedly, as soon as he came to the earth, he was beaten by Wang Zhen...</p>

    <p>What an unlucky kid.</p>

    <p>Then Wang Ling waved his hand and motioned to Wang Ying to take Zhao Qingxian to Wei Zhi's apartment and hand him over to Gu Shunzhi's supervision.</p>

    <p>He asked Wang Ying to bring Zhao Qingxian to him.</p>

    <p>I just want to know why Bai Zhe found Zhao Qingxian after he imagined himself as "Yang Shuangji."</p>

    <p>He felt that Zhao Qingxian might have some key clues that could be used by Bai Zhe, so he was targeted by Bai Zhe.</p>

    <p>But what exactly...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is still unclear at the moment.</p>

    <p>Because Bai Zhe. didn't explain anything to Zhao Qingxian, he was beaten to death by Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>And now Zhao Qingxian himself is in a state of confusion.</p>

    <p>I don't understand at all. What happened.</p>

    <p>"I will send you to a place to stay. The orderer will supervise you. You must be honest." At this time, Wang Ying stared at Zhao Qingxian and said.</p>

    <p>"yes..."</p>

    <p>"After you go back, wait until the effect of the soul-changing spell wears off, and then change your body back. Don't do anything else. All outings must be reported in advance."</p>

    <p>"Understood!" Zhao Qingxian nodded.</p>

    <p>"In addition, there is one more thing I want to tell you." Wang Ying touched his chin, thoughtfully.</p>

    <p>He actually thought about whether to tell Zhao Qingxian the bad news for a long time. However, he felt that since the matter was settled, it would be better for Zhao Qingxian to accept it as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying: "Miss Liu already has someone in mind. Although you are infatuated with Miss Liu, I advise you not to harass her. Otherwise, you will be dealt with miserably."</p>

    <p>"The one she likes? Who is her one? I want to challenge him to a duel!" Zhao Qingxian was furious. He looked like he wanted to rush up and bite the person to death.</p>

    <p>"Wang Zhen."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying said: "Do you know him?"</p>

    <p>When Zhao Qingxian heard this, he was shocked: "Aren't they not willing to deal with each other..."</p>

    <p>"It smells so good now." Wang Ying said: "Emotional matters, you can't force them. They have a good relationship now. Whatever you do is in vain."</p>

    <p>After Wang Ying finished speaking, Zhao Qingxian felt a sore nose and burst into tears on the spot. He took out his last belongings from the storage ring. He kowtowed to Wang Ling: "Zhenren! These three Tianyuan Guixin Pills are my last. It's a life-saving thing! Please help me! I can't survive without Qingyi!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ying dragged Zhao Qingxian away who was crying sadly...</p>

    <p>Oh.</p>

    <p>It's not Crispy Noodles.</p>

    <p>I'm sorry.</p>
