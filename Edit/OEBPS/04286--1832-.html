  <h1>Chapter 1832 The secret person behind the scenes</h1>

  <div>

    <p>For the Saints, this undoubtedly heralds a huge shame. The Saints have never made compromises with other civilizations since their establishment.</p>

    <p>As an ancient civilization that has survived many baptisms throughout the ages, their faces were all stiff and bitter. They felt it is extremely difficult to surrender?</p>

    <p>At the same time, for them who are familiar with earth civilization, this behavior seems to be similar to the "daily breast milk method" that is hotly discussed on the Internet. There is actually no essential difference between signing a treaty and raising a white flag to surrender.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying smiled: "The fetus is of little use to you, right? It's just a telescope and a microphone. It has no real value in your hands. It's better to trade the life of Louliu"</p>

    <p>He said encouragingly.</p>

    <p>Several saint protectors heard this and looked at each other in shock.</p>

    <p>What Wang Ying said is actually not wrong at all. In their hands, Cosmic Embryo is indeed a bit of a waste of money. If it weren't for the power of the Old Dominator's bloodline, it might not be able to use even the most basic functions.</p>

    <p>However, they are very clear about the value of Cosmic Embryo. Even if they have not been able to exert important value now, having Cosmic Embryo in hand is a strategic reserve.</p>

    <p>So they were very confused.</p>

    <p>These additional conditions are easy to negotiate. But as the main condition, Cosmic Embryo. It is really difficult for them to decide whether to exchange or not.</p>

    <p>The key is that as protectors, they themselves have no right to make a choice. Everything depends on the Holy King's wishes.</p>

    <p>"We can accept the previous additional conditions. But we can't decide on this matter. We need to seek the opinion of His Highness the Holy King..." Finally, the Great Protector with a rough voice spoke.</p>

    <p>"Sure." Wang Ying nodded and said, "I can return the person to you first. But this little brother has been hit by a law bomb called [Emperor Killer]. If the final deal is not reached, we will take the person away as well."</p>

    <p>Emperor Killer...</p>

    <p>The Saints were shocked. They did not expect Wang Ling and Wang Ying to have the means to deploy law bombs.</p>

    <p>And they actually promised to return the person first?</p>

    <p>The Fourth Protector immediately sneered when he heard this. He said from the other side of the universe: "They are too confident. They just returned the sixth brother like this. Then we can just study bomb defusal and be done with it?"</p>

    <p>"No...since they dare to hand people over to us first, they must have the confidence to bet that there is nothing we can do with this bomb."</p>

    <p>"Haha. I think they are blindly confident. Let's combine the power of five people, plus His Highness the Holy King! Can't solve a law bomb? If it doesn't work, we can help the sixth brother reshape his body. As long as people can come back, help the sixth brother out of trouble. There are many ways."</p>

    <p>After several discussions, Wang Ying finally received a positive reply from several saint guardians.</p>

    <p>It was the Great Protector who transmitted the message through Cosmic Embryo and said: "How about setting the deadline at five days. We will definitely give you an accurate answer within five days."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying heard this and just smiled: "Okay. Then we will wait for you for five days. But there are additional conditions. You must do it first. Regarding this, you can make the decision, right?"</p>

    <p>"Of course." The Great Protector affirmed: "In fact, we have almost completed our research on modern human cultivators. We have no intention of continuing to lurk."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying laughed as he was listening to these words.</p>

    <p>Then, he released his hand on Gui Laoliu's shoulder. Wang Ling instantly opened King's Eyes. Using his pupil power, he sent Gui Laoliu out of the world of the heavens.</p>

    <p>A period of five days.</p>

    <p>Use Cosmic Embryo in exchange for the life of the Sixth Guardian.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Wang Ying naturally know that. The other party will definitely try to defuse this law bomb related to [Emperor Killer]. But the reason why the law bomb can be called a law bomb must have its fundamental reason.</p>

    <p>This is an unsolvable bomb. It will follow the soul. No matter it is transferring the body or reshaping the soul, it is useless. As long as the caster does not remove it, any other method will be useless.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, on the other side, Wang Ling began to clean up the mess in front of them. He led everyone out of the world of the heavens. At the same time, he also lifted the "immortal shield" on everyone.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao, Guo Hao and everyone seemed to be waking up from a dream. Everything seemed like they were just stunned.</p>

    <p>When they returned to the car, Chen Chao sat in the back seat with his arms folded, muttering to Guo Hao, which made Wang Ling sweat on his forehead.</p>

    <p>"Guo. Do you feel like you have forgotten something?" Chen Chao said with a frown.</p>

    <p>"Normal." Guo Hao answered in a very Buddhist way: "Sometimes, I feel the same way. It's like my mind suddenly goes blank and I lose a small memory. For example, what I wanted to do, and then suddenly I can't think of anything. I got up. I froze in place. It took me a while to come back to my senses... This is a sign of anxiety. But when you just said that, I really feel like I can't remember some things."</p>

    <p>"That's what you said. I think so too! I feel like something very important is missing from my memory!" At this time, Li Youyue also raised her hand.</p>

    <p>And as Li Youyue spoke, even the people in the Whirlpool Emperor nodded.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao laughed: "That's what I said. It can't be such a coincidence, right? Collective amnesia? I'm afraid we collectively saw something we shouldn't have seen. Someone erased our memory."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the early morning of Monday, January 5th, the previous criminal charges against Sun Rong for "hired murder" were withdrawn by the prosecutor's office. This kind of Chilan Society, headed by Levis, located in Glio City, Mrs. Lawen, Mai Between the four major forces of Koasi and the Heavenly Dao Alliance, the initial concentrated fire operation was aimed at the Huaguo Shuilian Group and the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>It ended with the four major forces tearing each other apart and beating each other to the point of breaking out.</p>

    <p>The Heavenly Dao Alliance acted as a mediating force, but ended up being instigated by the false pope played by Levis. Such a dispute was something that no one expected.</p>

    <p>Before everyone at Number 60 High School left Glio City, Mrs. Lawen transferred the control of Walwolf Supermarket to Sun Rong as promised: "Although the recording this time was not smooth, I am still a person who keeps my promises."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong received various transfer materials from Wolwolf. At the same time, she frowned deeply as she looked at these materials: "Mrs. Lawen, there is something I want to ask you..."</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun, please speak." Mrs. Lawen was still sitting upright, with an elegant posture. There was no sign of being involved in power disputes or being beaten.</p>

    <p>"This chaos. Everything must be within Mrs. Lawen's plan."</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Rong suddenly asked: "If my reasoning is correct, you do not belong to the church. You are from Lord Yuan Zun's side."</p>
