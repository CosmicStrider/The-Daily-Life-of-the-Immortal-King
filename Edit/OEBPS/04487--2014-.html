  <h1>Chapter 2014 Ah, the smell of the strong!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After forming a team, defeat monsters and upgrade them, and let the newcomers do last-ditch damage when the monsters are low on health. This was originally just a routine operation in the game. At first glance, it sounds a bit fanciful to use the upper zone in real practice. But in the eyes of Wang Ling, this is The operation is actually feasible.</p>

    <p>In fact, when the final cut is made to complete the harvest, a special spiritual substance will be released from the spirit beast's body. It is the gasification reaction caused by the death of part of the spiritual core in the spirit beast's body.</p>

    <p>It will be discharged directly from the pores of the spirit beast. The vaporized spirit core can be quickly inhaled into the body by the nearest person. This is the key to helping to improve the realm.</p>

    <p>And the larger the realm span, the more obvious the effect.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong is the peak in the later stage of the Foundation Building period. Then kill the second-level spiritual beasts of the Golden Core level or the third-level spiritual beasts of the Nascent Soul level. The effect of the gasified spiritual core they bring is not Wang Ling Now bring the vigor.</p>

    <p>These two human-faced Brontosaurus were at the peak of Itinerant Immortal strength. As a result, they were directly beaten to a pulp by Wang Ling with a finger gun.</p>

    <p>At this time, leave it to Sun Rong to finish the last hit. The buff effect gained is naturally self-evident.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that this is the weakest level of spirit beast in the black forest. In the depths of the black forest of Wang Ling, the levels of these strange spirit beasts are frighteningly high. The peak of Itinerant Immortal is just a child's play. There is even True later. Immortal level and spiritual beasts beyond the True Immortal level exist.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong did not hesitate at all. Although the human-faced thunder dragon in front of her looked weird and terrifying, she knew very well that this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to practice. And Wang Ling took her to practice... In this village, maybe there is no such store!</p>

    <p>She took out a spiritual weapon dagger that was used instead of Aohai. She poured all her spiritual energy into the dagger. When the azure spiritual energy covered the blade of the dagger.</p>

    <p>Then!</p>

    <p>A chirping sound!</p>

    <p>With a decisive stab, he stabbed a human-faced brontosaurus in the heart.</p>

    <p>It stands to reason that with her level, it is impossible to penetrate the armor of the Human-Faced Thunder Dragon. But Wang Ling just pointed the gun in an unusual way. Not only did it reduce the health of the two Human-Faced Thunder Dragons to their remaining health. It also has the effects of breaking shields and sealing spirits. All the shielding abilities of the two human-faced thunder dragons have disappeared. They can only lie on the ground and let Sun Rong slaughter them.</p>

    <p>But after all, this is an Itinerant Immortal level spiritual beast. Its vitality is very tenacious. Sun Rong only needs one stab to kill it directly.</p>

    <p>Therefore, for Sun Rong, this last-ditch attack was actually a difficult process. After a lot of hard work, I managed to get rid of one. Sun Rong could clearly feel a wave of energy in his body. The heat is gathering.</p>

    <p>This is the performance of the gasified spiritual core being inhaled into the body. It will cause a short-term feeling of heat in the body.</p>

    <p>"Sister Rong's face is so red."</p>

    <p>Jingke's voice sounded in her mind again.</p>

    <p>This made Sun Rong suddenly think of some bad things.</p>

    <p>For example, a few days ago when she was reading those comics about cultivating girls, there was a plot in them.</p>

    <p>It is also the hero who takes the heroine to practice. Then he finds that his body is getting hotter and hotter as he practices. Finally, the hero discovers that there is something wrong with the spiritual fruit that the heroine eats to replenish physical energy. Although it will help the realm. But it will also stimulate some physiological factors and so on...</p>

    <p>Then there is no more. The process of this story is that the hero takes the heroine to practice. Then he practices and practices. Then he becomes the hero to practice the heroine...</p>

    <p>At this moment, Sun Rong's mind was full of ideas. Her body was extremely hot now. She suspected that she might have fallen into the routine of this girl's comic.</p>

    <p>The result was that she was disappointed.</p>

    <p>This hot feeling actually calmed down after a while.</p>

    <p>"It seems. Alright?" Sun Rong said as he wiped the sweat from his forehead.</p>

    <p>"It's caused by the vaporized spiritual core. The last hit is helpful for the growth of the realm." Jingke said.</p>

    <p>"..." Sun Rong is silent.</p>

    <p>Qi transformed spiritual core. She had heard this statement from her grandfather Sun Yiyuan before. She didn't expect it to be true.</p>

    <p>Could it be that this energy was forcibly absorbed into the body due to the last hit on a spiritual beast whose realm gap was too high...</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, Sun Rong's face couldn't help but glow red.</p>

    <p>It turns out that the real situation is like this...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling finally took her out to practice once, but she was thinking about some dirty things!</p>

    <p>It's all Jiang Yingying's fault! He recommended those weird girl comics to her!</p>

    <p>After having the first last-hitting experience and the experience of absorbing the gasified spiritual core, Sun Rong became more and more proficient in the subsequent operation process.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the tacit cooperation with Wang Ling has also improved a lot. The whole process can almost be described as silky smooth.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling. I think I'm about to break through?" When he killed the tenth human-faced Brontosaurus, Sun Rong's body began to emit a faint golden light.</p>

    <p>This is a sign that it is about to break through the bottleneck and form elixirs in the body.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling put his left hand in his trouser pocket. He tapped the index finger of his right hand on Sun Rong's forehead and felt it for a while.</p>

    <p>It can only be said that Sun Rong's talent for cultivation is truly incredible. The quality of the elixir formed by this Golden Core is very high. This means that Sun Rong can also go further in subsequent realm cultivation.</p>

    <p>Of course. The reason why I use my index finger for point measurement is actually to protect privacy.</p>

    <p>With the realm of Wang Ling, if he wants to, he can know the quality of Sun Rong's elixir just by standing here and looking at it with King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>But King's Eyes' insight is too strong after all. He will see all Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>As a just and upright young man, Wang Ling would certainly not do that. How could he, an upright gentleman, be interested in a woman's body.</p>

    <p>And it's not like he's never seen a woman's body before.</p>

    <p>Ah Nuan girl's diapers. Sometimes he helps change them!</p>

    <p>However, such contact still makes Sun Rong seem a little distracted. Being touched by the person he likes. Even if it is just a tap of a finger, his heart is destined to be thunderous and unable to calm down for a long time.</p>

    <p>"Let's go." At this time, Wang Ling's words directly woke her up. Another attractor spell made her directly circle Wang Ling's arm.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong feels like the magical cat in League of Legends who is practicing together. There seems to be an illusion that it is directly attached to Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling knew that Sun Rong was about to break through. At this time, these human-faced brontosaurus in the shallows were not the first choice. He wanted to take Sun Rong directly to the depths of the black forest. Then directly destroy a stronger one. That way, maybe Sun Rong can achieve a breakthrough on the spot.</p>

    <p>And when the time comes, as long as I'm by her side to protect her, there won't be any problems.</p>

    <p>He estimated the time. It was just before the sale started. There seemed to be plenty of time.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's cultivation talent is better than he imagined. Therefore, it is easier to break through than he imagined.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>However, at this moment, outside the mysterious Forbidden Forest located in the Office of Strategic Deception, a mysterious man wearing a black burqa and an eyepatch appeared at the entrance to the Forbidden Forest.</p>

    <p>He was holding a gem-encrusted wand. He was teleported directly here from an extremely long distance.</p>

    <p>This person is none other than the prehistoric illusionist who easily defeated the legendary killer Dai Tianchun before. Mingyue Ye.</p>

    <p>Mingyue Ye stared at the lush forest in front of her. The slightly raised corners of her mouth showed unprecedented joy and cunning: "Ah, it smells like a strong man!"</p>

    <p>He sighed, wiped his saliva, and then stepped into this mysterious forbidden forest...</p>
