  <h1>Chapter 1865 Soul exchange across eternity</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This is a chaos device with special functions. It is very unusual. But in fact, there are countless chaos devices with special functions among the chaos devices naturally bred in the universe. They have a dazzling array of abilities.</p>

    <p>However, most of them are useless and not very practical. In the end, they can only be broken down into fine materials and refined into chaos crystals to help the Eternal Ones in their cultivation.</p>

    <p>However, the function of this bowl of all living things seems a bit unusual. It actually has the special ability of "treasure bowl."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thinks that if he tries to modify it himself, the replica of this bowl may be far superior to the replica object.</p>

    <p>But he has no interest in this bowl. Even if these eternal beings are about to take over, it is just a bowl to him.</p>

    <p>In the Heavenly Dao spell, his "Great Copy" can perfectly realize this replica function.</p>

    <p>In the next few minutes, Chen Yanan was responsible for taking the bowl upstairs and handing it to the VIP room who was interested in the bowl.</p>

    <p>These heroes in the VIP room have the right to touch and identify them up close.</p>

    <p>If you are interested, just light up the psychic red lantern hanging in front of the door. After injecting some spiritual power, the lantern will be fully lit.</p>

    <p>"This bowl is very good. The concentration of chaos is also suitable. And there is still a lot of room for improvement. If you take it and find an expert refiner to modify it, it will have a great future." An old woman said. It was the Immortal Mountain Sect. The head teacher is Mrs. Shanxiu.</p>

    <p>This was a rare compliment from the Mighty One. It suddenly made everyone more interested in this bowl.</p>

    <p>And just when Wang Ling thought someone would quote an extremely exaggerated price.</p>

    <p>As a result, in the main hall below, a young man wearing luxurious outer clothes raised his hand sign and said: "I will give you 10,000 mixed spiritual stones."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling choked up immediately after hearing these words.</p>

    <p>Ten thousand mixed spirit stones?</p>

    <p>He originally thought that this bowl would cost at least a million.</p>

    <p>And everyone at the scene seemed to have a lot of money. It could easily be hundreds or tens of millions. Otherwise, Zhang Zhui would not have been able to get so much money all at once.</p>

    <p>As a result, the person below actually offered only 10,000 yuan. This surprised Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Chaos device is so cheap?" Wang Ying also felt it was amazing and asked immediately.</p>

    <p>"It's not that the Chaos Tool is cheap. It's that the Hunling Stone is valuable. Everyone present is a powerful person. It's normal to bring a lot of money. However, according to normal price standards, this is the case." Zhang Zhui replied.</p>

    <p>And now Wang Ling finally understands how "prodigal" it was for Emperor Dongda to let Zhang Zhui deposit 100 million mixed spirit stones just for this VIP room.</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda also smiled: "The main thing is that this is the first auction item. The price will not be so high. The good things are behind. Don't look at these people who are ready to make a move. In fact, they are all very clever."</p>

    <p>"Senior, I have a question! Doesn't the auction house limit the reserve price?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"According to the guild of the Central Auction House, there is no reserve price for the first auction item. This is a special benefit of the auction house." Dongda replied.</p>

    <p>So it is...</p>

    <p>The rest of the people nodded secretly.</p>

    <p>"I'll give you a 10-in-10 chance spirit stone!"</p>

    <p>"Twenty thousand! Please don't argue with me. I am bound to get this bowl!"</p>

    <p>Now Wang Ling feels completely confused about the pricing standards of the Eternal Period.</p>

    <p>He didn't even expect that the Hunling Stone could be so valuable...</p>

    <p>In his opinion, these are just broken stones floating in the chaos of the universe. In the past, he could get many of them with just a swipe.</p>

    <p>He listened to the constant bidding below. He was also beating a drum secretly in his heart. He didn't know how much the things he would sell later would fetch. He felt very uneasy.</p>

    <p>In the end, the bowl was bought by a young man in the hall for 160,000 mixed spiritual stones.</p>

    <p>The second auction item was a mythical beast skull. The auction process was the same as the first one. The auctioneer Liu Renwen took the lead in introducing the skull in detail.</p>

    <p>"This is the skull of the eight-eyed, nine-tailed, steel-winged, sky-fire four-legged beast that was shaken away by thunder and lightning in the early days of the Hunyuan Dynasty, which shook away the demon Tianxiang!"</p>

    <p>Liu Renwen finished speaking. Wang Ling, Sun Rong, Wang Ying, and Wang Zhen were all stunned.</p>

    <p>Why can the name of this mythical beast be so long? Why can't it be abbreviated? You really can't remember such a long list!</p>

    <p>However, as a professional auctioneer, Liu Renwen still demonstrated his full professional attitude.</p>

    <p>"The Jade Fire Hunyuan, the thunder and lightning universe shook away the devil, the eight-eyed nine-tailed steel-winged skyfire four-legged beast. As we all know, this is a very rare cosmic beast. From its genetic bloodline, a series of mythical beasts have been derived... Kunpeng, Qiongqi, Bi Fang, etc. are all related by blood to it."</p>

    <p>Liu Renwen said: "The skull we got today of the Jade Fire Hunyuan Taichu Thunder and Lightning Universe Shake Away Demon Tianxiang Eight Eyes Nine Tails Steel Wings Sky Fire Quadruped Beast is only a small part. But it is also of inestimable value. It can be used to assist your practice. You can even use it to refine your own magic weapon. There may be unexpected gains."</p>

    <p>"The second collection. Each price increase shall not be less than 50,000 mixed spirit stones."</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the whole place was in an uproar.</p>

    <p>It immediately aroused heated discussion.</p>

    <p>This Central Auction House is so powerful. It can even obtain such rare mythical beast skulls.</p>

    <p>A group of people immediately geared up.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw a few people below standing up as if they were talking about cross talk.</p>

    <p>"This jade fire Hunyuan Taichu thunder and lightning universe shook away the demon Tianxiang eight-eyed nine-tailed steel-winged sky fire quadruped beast skull is what I must get. I will offer two hundred thousand mixed spirit stones! If all fellow Taoists are willing to give in, I will be grateful."</p>

    <p>"Haha. Do you think you got the name right and this skull is yours?"</p>

    <p>Someone was dissatisfied. He immediately stood up and said. He seemed to be deliberately competing to see who could speak more smoothly. He read out the complete list of names at a faster speed: "My lord, this is the Jade Fire Hunyuan Taichu Thunder and Lightning Universe. The skull of the eight-eyed nine-tailed steel-winged skyfire four-legged beast that shakes away the demon Tianxiang is very interesting. I hope to use it for medicine! Who dares to snatch it. Once you leave the middle domain with the skull, be careful about your life! I will pay you 280,000 yuan. Spiritual stone!"</p>

    <p>"It's only two hundred and eighty thousand. There's no point in threatening others here, brother. I'll pay you five hundred thousand."</p>

    <p>A middle-aged man said with a smile. He had a golden back and was wearing gorgeous clothes. Judging from his imposing manner, he was also a big shot.</p>

    <p>"This jade fire Hunyuan Taichu thunder and lightning universe shook away the devil, Tianxiang eight eyes nine tail steel wings sky fire four-legged beast. No one knows better than me. Only in my hands can it display its true value!"</p>

    <p>He asked for five hundred thousand. Immediately, Wang Ling felt a little bit of the rich and wealthy atmosphere of the auction house.</p>

    <p>Now Wang Ling can see it. To these powerful people, it doesn't matter whether the price of the items they take is high or low.</p>

    <p>It doesn't matter whether it's expensive or cheap. The first thing is to have momentum...</p>

    <p>The price of something is high. Sometimes it is not because the thing is worth the money. But most of the time, it may be entirely because of superiors.</p>
