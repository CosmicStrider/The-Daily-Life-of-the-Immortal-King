  <h1>Chapter 1850 The history of being calculated</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling found that he seemed to be more gullible than the Great Emperor among the Eternals. The innocence of the young man was completely destroyed by the Emperor's cunning plan at this moment...</p>

    <p>He never thought that he would be plotted against by Emperor Dongda. He never thought that the history of this "Diary of Emperor Dongda" would be a history that he himself was also designed into.</p>

    <p>Originally Wang Ling was worried that his rash actions would change the trajectory of history. But now it seems that Emperor Dongda has obviously planned this.</p>

    <p>This made Wang Ling feel extremely strange. He used Dao Number 16 to enter the world of ancient cultivation that {Dongda Diary} was in back then. This is his exclusive secret technique. It can be called a flawless and heaven-defying method.</p>

    <p>However, Emperor Dongda was able to directly peek into the future to this point...</p>

    <p>It would be difficult for Emperor Dongda to peek into such a distant future based on his own strength alone. Therefore, Wang Ling suspected that Emperor Dongda must have done something before he got up, so his arrival was predicted.</p>

    <p>Such calculations certainly made Wang Ling feel uncomfortable. But in order not to change the trajectory of history, he had to take action on his behalf.</p>

    <p>After the war, he must ask Emperor Dongda for an explanation.</p>

    <p>This is a way to peer into the future across tens of thousands of years. Even an emperor-level figure cannot do it on his own.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Emperor Dong's body was officially taken over by Wang Ling. If you observe carefully, you can see that his eyes have obviously changed. Just above the messy imperial palace, a strong aura comes from this person. Released from the body of the Great Emperor.</p>

    <p>At this point, the elders of the invading Western Emperor forces, including the Sun Goddess, could clearly feel a chill coming from their backs.</p>

    <p>Just after Emperor Dongda said, "Do you think you are the only one who can ask gods to come to you?" Everything changed. The sudden surge of inexplicable and powerful power overwhelmed the entire audience, like a god coming down from the earth.</p>

    <p>All those who had just spoken out arrogantly could not help but retreat. A huge sense of fear emerged in their hearts.</p>

    <p>This feeling is difficult to describe in words. It is the ultimate depression. It is suffocating.</p>

    <p>This is Wang Ling's first time fighting against these countless Eternals with royal bloodline. Especially the sun goddess in front of him who was given part of her power by the Western Emperor and condensed into the Hydra Suzaku.</p>

    <p>The opponent's strength has already reached the pseudo-emperor level. She would have defeated Emperor Dongda before. If Emperor Dongda had not felt that the situation was in crisis, it would have been impossible for him to directly "invite the gods."</p>

    <p>"Emperor Dongda, what are you bluffing about? It's just you, why do you ask a god to come over to you?" said an elder from the influence of Emperor Xi.</p>

    <p>"Yes or no. You will know after you try it." Emperor Dongda showed a contemptuous smile.</p>

    <p>This is not Wang Ling's reply. It's the process of Wang Ling's manipulation of the body. Dongda is grabbing the wheat.</p>

    <p>Such behavior made Wang Ling feel a fire in his heart. But now he has no way not to do it.</p>

    <p>Because according to the course of history, all the intruders who broke into the imperial palace in {Eastern Emperor Diary} met a tragic end...but it is obvious that Emperor East omitted some things in the diary.</p>

    <p>For example, the matter of "asking a god to come to you." He only mentioned it lightly with a few strokes. He didn't mention a single word. Even Wang Ling couldn't have imagined that the god he invited would be himself.</p>

    <p>"It's useless what you do. As long as I, the Hydra Suzaku, an here, you will definitely die today." At this time, the Sun Goddess spoke. Her calm expression still showed confidence. Although she observed the difference between Emperor Dongda and the previous were quite different. But she thought it was a bluff.</p>

    <p>How is it possible to really invite God to take over?</p>

    <p>And in such a short period of time...</p>

    <p>What kind of god would fall in love with someone else so casually?</p>

    <p>"Hahaha. Today we are about to witness history! The new emperor ascends the throne! And she is also a female emperor!" The elder from the Western Emperor's faction who had clamored before echoed and laughed again.</p>

    <p>"Boom!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Without saying a word, he took action directly. With a powerful aura, he grabbed the elder in an attitude of killing a chicken to scare the monkeys. This palm was like a dragnet. It came from a distance and directly triggered an earthquake under his feet.</p>

    <p>"In that case, I will take you down first..." At the critical moment, Emperor Dongda once again sang a double act with Wang Ling. Wang Ling was responsible for taking action. Emperor Dongda was responsible for speaking. Although there was not much communication, the division of labor was undoubtedly clear at this time.</p>

    <p>"With me here, you can never succeed."</p>

    <p>The Sun Goddess whispered. The golden light flashed in her eyes, and her whole body burst into blazing light.</p>

    <p>She knew very well that Emperor Dongda's move was to scare the monkeys. He wanted to kill someone who was making noise.</p>

    <p>However, in front of her, if Emperor Dongda succeeds like this, she will definitely lose face.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>In an instant, the Hydra Suzaku Dharma released black light in the air. There was a law of darkness and light intertwined into hemp ropes. Finally, it was woven into a dark Suzaku cage, covering all the elders of the Western Emperor under their feet.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at this scene indifferently. The expression on his face was as calm as ever. He didn't take the Sun Goddess's methods seriously at all. He still shot towards that place.</p>

    <p>When the palm came close to the Dark Suzaku Cage, the Sun Goddess unexpectedly covered it completely with her palm!</p>

    <p>At this moment, the world was silent. The Sun Goddess never thought of the dark Suzaku cage she had woven. The Eastern Emperor actually dared to grab it with his bare hands!</p>

    <p>For a moment, there was infinite silence in the air.</p>

    <p>After a moment, a powerful spiritual energy gushes out from the palm of Wang Ling. The most powerful Suzaku Dharma appears behind Emperor Dongda. The infinitely bright Suzaku Fire directly burns the Dark Suzaku Cage!</p>

    <p>At the same time, with the powerful ripples surging, the elder named Xiao was burned to ashes on the spot. Nothing was left.</p>

    <p>"How is this possible..." The Sun Goddess's face turned pale. She had no idea that Emperor Dongda's Suzaku Dharma had become stronger!</p>

    <p>It was obviously the eight-tailed Suzaku before! One less feather than her!</p>

    <p>At this moment, everyone was shocked!</p>

    <p>No one would have thought that the Suzaku in the sky now has eighty-one feathers on its tail!</p>

    <p>Just like Kongque. The screen is still on!</p>

    <p>"This is no longer a Suzaku...it is the Supreme Light Kongque Ming King! The ultimate form above the nine-tailed Suzaku!" Ye Ren exclaimed. He and the people below him fought bloody battles with the Eastern Emperor Lao Chengdu, who was horrified. Everyone's mouths were wide open. Could all fit a goose egg inside.</p>

    <p>In fact, even Wang Ling did not expect that the spirit of his own dharma, that is, the spirit of the universe... could possess the effect of possessing other people's dharma, thereby causing other people's dharma to directly evolve into their ultimate form.</p>

    <p>The Supreme Light Kongque King Ming flew across the sky. The strongest law of light impacted. Unlimited destruction was released over the Eastern Region. All the magical weapons of the Western Emperor's forces were accurately exploded at this time!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling knew clearly that at this point, there was no chance of survival for these invaders. He stopped taking action. Instead, he returned the sovereignty of his body to Emperor Dongda.</p>

    <p>As long as this battle is over, he will dissolve the fusion of the spirit of the universe.</p>

    <p>At the same moment, the elders who shouted to seize the throne all turned extremely pale. In a short period of time, they were turned into mummies by the light of King Kongque, and then turned into ashes.</p>

    <p>This was a shocking change. It happened in the blink of an eye.</p>

    <p>At this time, all the elders on the Eastern Great Emperor's side were moved. All the tribes and people in the entire imperial territory shouted loudly.</p>

    <p>"Eastern Emperor Eternal..."</p>

    <p>The huge Eastern Territory was full of people at this time. They were all reciting the words "Eastern Emperor Eternal."</p>

    <p>The Supreme Light King Kongque appeared, giving great encouragement to everyone present.</p>

    <p>For the intruders, this is absolutely a disaster. This kind of Dharma is really terrible!</p>

    <p>In order to protect the tribes and people of the Eastern Territory, Emperor Dongda was extremely decisive in taking action after receiving the blessing of the power of "asking God to come to his body."</p>

    <p>"Boom!"</p>

    <p>The next moment, he briefly displayed the law of light of King Kongque. It was like a big sun, releasing countless beams of light. The phoenix chirped between heaven and earth, paving the way for these rays of punishment.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>Under the rays of light, dozens more people were directly killed by Emperor Dongda using Kongque Mingwang's Dharma. Then he controlled Kongque Mingwang and tore off all the snake tails behind the Hydra Suzaku Dharma of the Sun Goddess.</p>

    <p>The Dharma was damaged. The face of the Sun Goddess turned pale. The pain of tearing her body was immediately transmitted simultaneously, causing her to spit out a large mouthful of blood.</p>
