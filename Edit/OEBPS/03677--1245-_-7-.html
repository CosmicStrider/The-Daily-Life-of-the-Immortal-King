  <h1>Chapter 1245 The ultimate evolution!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>With deep dark circles and sunken eye sockets, coupled with the red hair hanging down, Snake was lying on the windshield like a ghost.</p>

    <p>The next moment, he stretched out his hand. His sharp nails directly penetrated the windshield!</p>

    <p>An entire side of reinforced glass fell apart in an instant. It turned into shards of glass and scattered in the void! Then it turned into light particles and quickly disappeared!</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi and Keorn reacted quickly. Almost at the same time as Snake launched the attack, the two quickly unbuckled their seat belts and opened the car door. They trampled the spiritual sword and leaped out.</p>

    <p>"Who is this person..." Zhuo Yi stared at the young man in front of him. His eye-catching fiery red hair hung down around his waist.</p>

    <p>He was shirtless, revealing huge muscles and perfect muscle lines.</p>

    <p>"Yes, it's Snake...but this body is definitely not his." Keorn frowned. The aura of the resurrected "Snake" was countless times stronger than what Keorn had known before.</p>

    <p>A fierce fight broke out on the viaduct. Countless cultivators nearby were shocked by this scene. Many people abandoned their vehicles and left with their swords. Some passers-by also chose to call the police.</p>

    <p>It is absolutely wise to evacuate at this time. However, Zhuo Yi does not see much significance in calling the police.</p>

    <p>The aura on Snake's body is no longer the same.</p>

    <p>Even if the Cultivation Police Department sends people here, they will not be his opponent.</p>

    <p>"Keorn. Have you heard of the void." At this time, Snake was standing on the roof of a car.</p>

    <p>He stared at Keorn. He enjoyed the feeling very much.</p>

    <p>Bang!</p>

    <p>There was a gunshot in the distance!</p>

    <p>A sniper bullet composed of powerful spiritual energy quickly cut through the air and was aimed at Snake's head.</p>

    <p>"Has someone arrived from the police station?" Zhuo Yi was startled. He didn't expect that the response from the nearby area would be so quick.</p>

    <p>Faced with the speeding sniper bullets, Snake stood still.</p>

    <p>In fact, his eyes had already come into contact with the trajectory of the sniper rifle.</p>

    <p>"Psychic bombs? Think they can still hurt me?" Snake sneered.</p>

    <p>The bullet accurately hit him between the eyebrows. Then it was swallowed into Snake's body like a mud cow entering the sea.</p>

    <p>Devoured by the void.</p>

    <p>This is a new ability after he becomes a higher-stage life form.</p>

    <p>As long as he thinks about it, everything that wants to pass through his body. Spells, hidden weapons, and various flying objects will be swallowed by him and decomposed completely.</p>

    <p>Snake will never forget the scene when he became a human and was pierced by a "needle" in the forehead.</p>

    <p>And now he has become a virtual spirit.</p>

    <p>These fancy tricks no longer meant anything to him.</p>

    <p>"He has become an ethereal spirit..." Keorn quickly realized what had happened in front of him.</p>

    <p>As an investigator, he had secret contact with those ethereal beings. Although he was not 100% sure immediately, Keorn was convinced that Snake was no longer human.</p>

    <p>"What's the best thing about being human? Keorn. You will never understand the exhilarating feeling of transcending the limit form of life."</p>

    <p>Snake sneered: "You know, it feels really good not to be human! This may be the ultimate evolution of life forms!"</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Snake rose high into the air. He looked down at Zhuo Yi and Keorn. It was like looking at two ants.</p>

    <p>In a very short period of time, time seemed to stand still. Even the air was stagnant... An astonishing pressure burst out from Snake's body.</p>

    <p>With a huge sound, the viaduct bridge broke instantly. A car fell into the soil. They were like sand grains in the tide being swept into the mud flow.</p>

    <p>"Is this the power of void creatures..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi and Keorn both experienced tremendous pressure.</p>

    <p>If he weren't wearing a thermal underwear suit. Zhuo Yi felt like he couldn't withstand such power!</p>

    <p>This pressure is different from spiritual pressure, but it is more frightening than the spiritual pressure of cultivators on earth. For a brief moment, Zhuo Yi even felt as if his soul was lost.</p>

    <p>"Useless. A Golden Core.</p>

    <p>A false True Immortal cannot be my opponent." Snake was full of confidence. He was above the void. There was complete contempt in his arrogant eyes.</p>

    <p>It's like playing with two ants.</p>

    <p>But fortunately at the critical moment. Zhuo Yi quickly operates {Thirty-three Little Paths of Vitality}.</p>

    <p>This is the technique given to him by Wang Ling in Chapter 679!</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi has been practicing hard on weekdays. He has been using the thirty-three small paths of vitality to accumulate spiritual energy. But now it finally comes in handy at this moment!</p>

    <p>"A technique for accumulating psychic energy?" Snake smiled. It's not like he has never seen such a technique before. Usually, it is accumulated and released at critical moments for risking one's life.</p>

    <p>After it all breaks out, the realm will grow by leaps and bounds in a short period of time.</p>

    <p>However, Zhuo Yi is just a Golden Core. There is a huge gap between itself and him. Even if it breaks out, what will happen?</p>

    <p>Snake looked at Zhuo Yi with contempt. He wanted to see what Zhuo Yi wanted to do.</p>

    <p>"Open the gate!" Accompanied by a loud shout from Zhuo Yi, his aura of passing the examination began to rise upward! The spiritual energy accumulated in the Golden Core on weekdays surged out like a tide at this moment!</p>

    <p>Until this moment.</p>

    <p>Keorn frowned just now. He felt something was wrong with the situation: "Eh? Heavenly Dao technique?"</p>

    <p>He began to be surprised by the Zhuo Yi's {{Thirty-three Little Paths of Vitality}}.</p>

    <p>Ordinary psychic energy saving skills. It can only store dreams of one realm at most. That is, after Zhuo Yi breaks out, it can only grow to the combat power of the Nascent Soul stage at most.</p>

    <p>But now Zhuo Yi has this Thirty-Three Paths of Vitality... it can store up to 33 realms of cross-server spiritual energy!</p>

    <p>In other words, Zhuo Yi's body contains spiritual energy as large as thirty-three giant reservoirs!</p>

    <p>Of course. With Zhuo Yi's daily savings, plus Wang Ling's occasional reminders, his psychic energy savings pool has already reached saturation!</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi has never found a suitable opportunity to use it.</p>

    <p>And now. The time has completely matured!</p>

    <p>"You, a Golden Core... actually have the Heavenly Dao technique on your body?" Snake looked at Zhuo Yi in surprise.</p>

    <p>When he was still a human, he also tried hard to chase Heavenly Dao. However, he didn't even touch the hem of Heavenly Dao's clothes!</p>

    <p>He was once a cultivator on earth who worked hard to pursue the power of the Great Dao!</p>

    <p>Snake laughed to himself inwardly.</p>

    <p>For him, it is completely unimportant whether there is Heavenly Dao or not. He has become a higher-level being!</p>

    <p>Even Heavenly Dao!</p>

    <p>He won't take it seriously either!</p>

    <p>"Zhuo Yi...You gave me a good opportunity to prove myself."</p>

    <p>Snake's eyes were fixed on Zhuo Yi. He showed a ferocious expression: "I will kill you with my own hands. Hang your head high on the Void Gate... to prove that I have surpassed you." Above Heavenly Dao!"</p>
