  <h1>Chapter 2113 Unknown Plot</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: The cell is cramped, damp, and dark. The surrounding environment is so real that one wonders whether this is reality or a game.</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao has designed a game that spans the ages. It has directly updated the entire industry. It is shocking.</p>

    <p>It is worthy of being highly praised by players during the closed beta stage. It is listed as a masterpiece of a cross-generational work. You must know that the last company that was listed as an insider in the gaming industry was Mixiyou.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling doesn't play games often. Especially the ones where you draw cards to earn gold. His luck is always very good. Even if he doesn't earn gold, he can draw all the rare cards.</p>

    <p>As for the cost of krypton gold, it seems to Wang Ling that it is better to save it and buy crispy noodles. He doesn't know what Chen Chao and Guo Hao think. A single order of 648... is really willing to spend his own money. All the family wealth was contributed.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling does not exclude games. After all, the fun of the game itself is still there. As long as everything is not excessive.</p>

    <p>For example, this {Itinerant Immortal magic ring}. Wang Ling originally thought it was not interesting. But now it seems that it is a little more interesting than he thought.</p>

    <p>He closed his eyes and recited the mantra of the mental method silently. He watched as the passive layers of his "God descends to earth" mental method continued to accumulate. When it reached the seventy-second level.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling already has 785/820 blood volume. 70 drops of it are his initial blood volume. The original initial health volume of the profession is 100 points. However, because he is injured and hungry, Wang Ling Lost 30 drops in the opening game.</p>

    <p>But it doesn't matter. Anyway, now he has a health bar dripping with blood. Even if the negative status makes him deduct 5 points an hour, he can still last for a long time.</p>

    <p>What is the concept of 820 drops of blood? In the Itinerant Immortal magic ring. The mini-boss in the early map has almost this amount of blood.</p>

    <p>The cell leader was greatly surprised. He had never seen such a weird person who got higher and higher as he passed the barrier. In addition, he was "taunted" by Wang Ling first, which made him very angry.</p>

    <p>That's right. This taunt was in double quotes. He thought Wang Ling was mocking him. But in fact Wang Ling was not.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is also very aggrieved. He just told the truth. Why is it just pretending?</p>

    <p>So now Wang Ling found out. There was something wrong with the way the prison boss looked at him.</p>

    <p>Mostly because he wanted to take revenge on himself.</p>

    <p>Shao Qing. The door of the old room was opened. It was the cell leader again.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw his sharp eyes. He looked at him with a fierce look on his face. His sharp eyes said: "You! Come with me!"</p>

    <p>Soon. A system prompt came in front of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>[You have triggered an unknown plot]</p>

    <p>Until then Wang Ling suddenly realized that something was wrong.</p>

    <p>He enjoyed practicing here for a while, but he forgot about the balance mechanism in the game. Since some of Bai Qiao's spells are designed based on the concept of Heavenly Dao, he must have also increased monitoring of balance.</p>

    <p>In other words, the plot I encountered at this stage was triggered by the game world out of balance considerations.</p>

    <p>After all, he hadn't even stepped out of the first map of Novice Village. The character's overall blood volume had already exceeded 820. It was really outrageous.</p>

    <p>As the cell leader led him forward, Wang Ling carefully observed the surrounding environment. He was trying to find the surrounding bonfires.</p>

    <p>Yes. In the Itinerant Immortal spell ring, every bonfire that appears on the map is a save point.</p>

    <p>And now that Wang Ling has not found even a save point, it means that the [unknown plot] he will encounter next. If it is not handled properly, the mental mantra he has just recited for so long will be in vain. Well...the data will be directly wiped out by then. Start over from scratch.</p>

    <p>This can be said to be the pain that players of soul-based games must bear. Although Wang Ling doesn't play it often and has never eaten pork, he has seen pigs running away!</p>

    <p>He had watched the live game online between Chen Chao and Guo Haochuan. He also put coins into each of them. And so far, they don't know that the person who put in coins for them is Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>As Wang Ling expected. The plot script started to develop in a not so good direction.</p>

    <p>On the way, the cell leader didn't say a word. He didn't take Wang Ling out of the cell. Instead, he walked him deeper into the cell.</p>

    <p>As the surrounding air gradually became colder, Wang Ling also felt a hint of the atmosphere common in horror games.</p>

    <p>He moved a vegetable jar half as tall as a man away, revealing the opening of the underground cellar in the cell.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised his eyebrows. Unexpectedly, the passage to the dark cellar was hidden in this place.</p>

    <p>Moreover, it is covered with the old sauerkraut jar used for making sauerkraut. How strong the smell must be! Is it true that mold will not grow if placed in a dark and humid place like a prison cell?</p>

    <p>When you take the sauerkraut, do you have to pour it into a pit and stomp on it to get some athlete's foot?</p>

    <p>At this time, the prison head sneered at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"You. Get down!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt calm in his heart. He did not show any signs of anger. Instead, he "obediently" followed the cell leader's instructions and walked down the stone steps. The eerie background music echoed directly in the dark cellar.</p>

    <p>A dark, cold, terrifying and full of resentment smell came to my face!</p>

    <p>The moment Wang Ling stepped onto the bottom floor of the dark cellar along the stone steps, countless deformed hand and foot marks emerged like a tide on the walls made of mud and tiles, exuding faint fireflies!</p>

    <p>Every cell has a lynching site. Obviously, this dark cellar is the special lynching space in the cell where Wang Ling is located. The prisoners imprisoned here only have to offend the people in the cell or have not paid enough atonement money. It's possible they could be brought here.</p>

    <p>And during the lynching process, many people died...</p>

    <p>The cell leader showed off his power. He felt that Wang Ling was not experienced in the world. As long as he imposed a small punishment, he would be so scared that he would kneel on the ground and beg him for mercy.</p>

    <p>But I don't know why. There was no expression on this young man's face from beginning to end. From beginning to end, he had a standard dead fish eyes and paralyzed face!</p>

    <p>No matter how terrifying the atmosphere of the dark cellar was, he completely ignored it!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling yawned.</p>

    <p>Even if it were real reality here, it wouldn't scare him. What's more, it's just a game.</p>

    <p>Although the atmosphere rendering and environment have indeed been fake and real. They are almost the same as reality. But Wang Ling's heart is always calm.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was wondering what the prison boss would do next. As a result, he found that his passive layer of {{the Gods of heaven descend to earth<sup>1</sup>}} had inexplicably increased by one more layer.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>((idiom); fig. at the end of the world)</dfn>

    <p>He...he's showing off again?</p>

    <p>Is this considered pretentious?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't understand. But he was deeply shocked.</p>

    <p>At this time. www.uukanshu.net The prison boss finally understood. He had underestimated the hateful dead fish eyes in front of him.</p>

    <p>At this moment, he finally opened his eyes angrily and revealed his true colors in the empty dark cellar. He kicked Wang Ling in the chest with a sharp kick.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling's figure never moved.</p>

    <p>I never felt any pain.</p>

    <p>I just saw that the blood volume value dropped.</p>

    <p>It was 795/830 just now...</p>

    <p>Now it's 794/830...</p>

    <p>My little brother can't do it!</p>

    <p>This kick is quite heavy. It actually only lost 1.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed.</p>

    <p>Slightly disappointed with the kick from the prison head.</p>
