  <h1>Chapter 2064 Routines and Counter-Routines</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: "I'm sorry, Muyu. I remembered it wrong. Your talent and qualifications actually have little to do with the size of the fish you catch."</p>

    <p>"?"</p>

    <p>The world of adults is dangerous and complicated. Even Wang Muyu himself did not expect that even though he was so careful and vigilant, he would still be tricked in the end.</p>

    <p>The fundamental reason is that the person standing in front of him now was planned and arranged by Wang Ling. It was precisely because of his infinite trust in Wang Ling that he relaxed a little.</p>

    <p>Of course. Another key point is that Wang Muyu feels that such a highly respected veteran in the earth's cultivation circle, the former founding general of the Huaxiu Kingdom...faced with a child like him, wouldn't he use any means to test him, right?</p>

    <p>But unfortunately, this old guy used it. And he used it quite naturally. There was no flaw in his acting skills...</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>Alas. After all, I am still too young.</p>

    <p>When faced with the Sword Master's question, the little guy naturally showed his timid and innocent face. There were dazzling stars in his eyes.</p>

    <p>His reaction speed was also very fast: "Eh? Is that so? But I didn't notice any discomfort when I held the pole?"</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan frowned. He immediately took the rod back from Wang Muyu's hand. Then he was shocked to find that there was a thin, invisible crack at the end of the fishing rod.</p>

    <p>"There is indeed a gap."</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan muttered.</p>

    <p>Did it turn out that the fishing rod was damaged...the spiritual pressure inside was out of balance? Is that why Muyu was able to hold on to the rod for so long?</p>

    <p>In this way, everything seems to be explained.</p>

    <p>How could a six- or seven-year-old kid really hold the fishing rod for such a long time? Even for a genius of his age, it is too much to hold on for more than ten minutes.</p>

    <p>Seeing the sword master sighing in disappointment, Wang Muyu also breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>Of course, he knew that the Sword Master was not that easy to fool. Although his realm and combat power were not as good as his own, his experience was vast. What kind of things had he not seen before?</p>

    <p>The fishing rod used for testing was a top-quality sacred instrument. Even though the sword master was puzzled, he would never have thought that the invisible cracks were caused intentionally by the child in front of him.</p>

    <p>A six or seven-year-old child. Can he crush a top-quality sacred instrument?</p>

    <p>What a joke.</p>

    <p>So. Yi Jianchuan stared at the damaged test fishing rod in his hand. He said somewhat depressedly: "Muyu. How about we change the testing method?"</p>

    <p>"Okay." Wang Muyu happily accepted. Then he showed a harmless smile.</p>

    <p>Every time you take a step, you gain wisdom.</p>

    <p>This time. He will be extra careful.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>A bamboo raft enters the west entrance of the artificial lake and drives towards the east. Ripples appear on the calm lake surface as the bamboo raft drives.</p>

    <p>No one is sliding the bamboo raft. It is purely the propulsive effect caused by the sword master releasing his sword energy.</p>

    <p>"Once you have mastered the art of sword control, you can apply this method to all aspects. When I was practicing Sword, I would often use all kinds of strange objects to cross the river."</p>

    <p>"Like. Reed?"</p>

    <p>"It's everything."</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Yi Jianchuan was seen stopping the bamboo raft. He lifted his sword fingers together and gently lifted it towards the lake. Drops of lake water were accurately peeled off from the lake. Affected by the sword energy, these water droplets were peeled off. The grains are distinct. They are neatly arranged into an endlessly high ladder in the void.</p>

    <p>He directly stepped on the water droplets upwards and ran high into the sky at high speed. He did not use any magical weapons or any floating spells. He only used his own sword energy to control the water droplets on the lake surface to build a ladder in the air, soaring through the void.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu could actually do such an operation. But at that time, for some reason, he looked at the sword master who quickly disappeared from his sight. He was still a little stunned. For some reason, he was fascinated by it.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>When he came back to his senses, the old man had appeared in front of him again. He was like a leaf, falling lightly on the bamboo raft without any unnecessary fluctuations.</p>

    <p>"To practice swordsmanship, you must first cultivate your mind. As long as your state of mind is deep enough, your sword intention will naturally reach all directions. It can reach all the places you want to reach."</p>

    <p>Then he continued to skillfully control the bamboo raft, with his hands behind his back. The sword master's demeanor was clearly revealed. He was extremely patient and gentle.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu's heart was like a mirror. The speed of this bamboo raft could actually be faster. But in order to take care of himself, the old man still gave him a process of adaptation.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Muyu suddenly understood why Wang Ling chose to practice with Yi Jianchuan.</p>

    <p>Just when they were crossing the lake on a bamboo raft, they felt an unprecedented sense of tranquility and extraordinary comfort.</p>

    <p>It's hard to believe. Obviously his realm and combat power are far stronger than the sword master. But at this moment, he was affected. It made him feel unreal.</p>

    <p>"By the way, Grandpa Sword Master, where are we going?" Wang Muyu asked at this moment.</p>

    <p>He can also communicate with other people, but for some reason, Wang Muyu doesn't want to use it on the person in front of him. Although even if he uses his method of communicating with other people, the other party may not know. Don't steal other people's voices at will. This is also a kind of respect.</p>

    <p>When he was on the shore, he didn't read minds because he was not careful.</p>

    <p>Now on this bamboo raft, Wang Muyu once again gave up the idea of using his mind because of his spontaneous respect.</p>

    <p>Hearing that the little guy had changed his title, Yi Jianchuan was naturally beaming: "I want to take you to jump over the Dragon Gate."</p>

    <p>Then, he used his sword energy to control the water in the lake below, causing a huge wave to rise. He used the bamboo raft as a skateboard to ride on the waves with Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>In the blink of an eye, we came to a huge wall. This was the sluice gate of the artificial lake.</p>

    <p>"If you want to go from this artificial lake to the large reservoir, there are two ways. One is to hold your breath and swim through the passage at the bottom of the lake. The second is to jump over the 200-meter-high sluice."</p>

    <p>Staring at the 200-meter-high sluice in front of him, Wang Muyu fell into deep thought... It was certainly not difficult for him to jump over.</p>

    <p>But after all, Yi Jianchuan's knowledge of him is limited. It would be a problem if he really jumped over.</p>

    <p>So what is the best way to do this at this time? Wang Muyu was influenced by Wang Ling. www.uukanshu.net It can be said to be a lesson in words and deeds. When faced with such a task that can be completed but has to be given up, usually all you need to do is pretend. Just make an effort and it will be fine.</p>

    <p>He frowned and was thinking about how many meters he should jump to fall.</p>

    <p>As a result, the sword master slapped his thigh and said excitedly: "You are indeed... the disciple I want to find!"</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu: "?"</p>

    <p>The sword master was moved and said: "Under normal circumstances, children your age would have given up long ago when they see such a high sluice. But Muyu, you are different. You actually want to jump over! I have decided. Today. I officially accept you as my disciple!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Upon hearing this, Wang Muyu's big eyes suddenly revealed great doubts.</p>

    <p>He didn't expect that he would be tricked twice in one day...</p>
