  <h1>Chapter 1238 The Frightening Fool</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Half an hour before the foundation meeting starts.</p>

    <p>The Book of Sage Immortal has deduced the identity of the "Fool" messenger among the seven messengers.</p>

    <p>It is also recommended that Wang Ling use the "temporary body seizing technique" to enter the body of this fool.</p>

    <p>This kind of seizure is temporary. A short-term soul exchange can be achieved.</p>

    <p>The advantage is that you can infiltrate seamlessly without being discovered.</p>

    <p>Therefore. Wang Ling is not a real fool.</p>

    <p>But what Wang Ling didn't expect was.</p>

    <p>His habit of stealing snacks raised questions among several other messengers at the scene.</p>

    <p>But fortunately, he hasn't been completely exposed yet.</p>

    <p>The most important reason is that Xubai does not believe that the person who is the Fool is Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>There's no way it's this person...</p>

    <p>For a moment, the three words "impossible" were displayed back and forth in Xu Bai's mind.</p>

    <p>Based on the information he investigated.</p>

    <p>The Fool's true identity is a woodcutter living in the deep mountains and forests. His name is Joyce Tanlang.</p>

    <p>Joyce Tanlang is very powerful, but has a miserable life experience.</p>

    <p>I have a sister who has been possessed by an evil spirit since childhood.</p>

    <p>This overbearing evil spirit has been entrenched in his sister's body all year round and refuses to come out.</p>

    <p>And Joyce, in addition to working hard to practice to become stronger.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he is also looking for a way to rid his sister of the evil spirit.</p>

    <p>But unfortunately, Joyce took too long.</p>

    <p>The evil spirit and his sister have merged spiritually. Now they are indistinguishable from each other.</p>

    <p>Joyce wanted to keep her sister alive.</p>

    <p>He had to live with his sister in the deep mountains where there is abundant spiritual energy.</p>

    <p>Because of this, Joyce's mental space signal has always been unstable.</p>

    <p>And this is the reason why this messenger of the Fool often leaves the meeting in the middle of the meeting.</p>

    <p>So. Let's ask a woodcutter who lives in the mountains all year round with his sister who is possessed by an evil spirit.</p>

    <p>Why do you suddenly have the habit of eating snacks?</p>

    <p>Although Xu Bai had doubts in his heart.</p>

    <p>But he didn't believe the woodcutter in the Fool position.</p>

    <p>He is the man whom he longs for revenge.</p>

    <p>He has carefully planned everything. This plan has not yet been officially launched.</p>

    <p>All actions should be seamless.</p>

    <p>That man couldn't have imagined that he was the mastermind behind it.</p>

    <p>So. There must be a mistake somewhere.</p>

    <p>Or maybe Lord of the Void missed some of Joyce's habits...</p>

    <p>If this is a woodcutter who loves snacks, it seems to make sense.</p>

    <p>Joyce sacrificed so much for her sister.</p>

    <p>Visited so many powerful beings and sought out secret recipes in remote places to relieve evil spirits.</p>

    <p>You must have your own pressure.</p>

    <p>Some people relieve stress by typing on the keyboard;</p>

    <p>Some people drink whiskey;</p>

    <p>Some people rely on recommendation votes and monthly votes;</p>

    <p>There are also people who shamelessly rely on dragging to relieve stress;</p>

    <p>Of course, it is not ruled out that some people rely on snacks to relieve stress.</p>

    <p>Nervously swallowing the saliva accumulated in his mouth, Xu Bai spoke at this time.</p>

    <p>"Fool. Don't you... have nothing to say?"</p>

    <p>He still firmly believed in the Lord of the Void's judgment.</p>

    <p>It was confirmed that the messenger sitting in seat 7 was the old woodcutter Joyce.</p>

    <p>Not the man he wants revenge on.</p>

    <p>He is vain. He is not vain at all.</p>

    <p>But the best time for revenge has not yet come.</p>

    <p>He just needs a little more time to prepare.</p>

    <p>"I agree. Chariot's opinion."</p>

    <p>Finally, a voice came from the Fool's position.</p>

    <p>This slightly rough voice made Xu Bai let out a long sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>He was sure it was Joyce's voice.</p>

    <p>And his tone of voice was exactly the same as Joyce's.</p>

    <p>"Then. Six votes for Chariot and one vote for the Sun. The foundation will formulate follow-up plans based on Chariot's suggestions."</p>

    <p>Speaking of this, in the spiritual space, Xu Bai made the final decision.</p>

    <p>This meeting has come to an end.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the bedroom of the Wang family's small villa. Wang Ling opened his eyes.</p>

    <p>At the last moment of the meeting just now, Wang Ling canceled his "temporary body seizing technique."</p>

    <p>The body was returned to its original owner Joyce Tanlon.</p>

    <p>This is a good brother who knows how to cherish his sister.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling doesn't want to get Joyce in trouble because of his own reasons.</p>

    <p>He has signed a soul contract with Joyce, retaining the right to come to him at any time.</p>

    <p>In return. Wang Ling will agree to help Joyce cure his sister.</p>

    <p>Although the evil ghost has soul-fused with his sister.</p>

    <p>But for Wang Ling, peeling off the evil spirit is just a snap of the finger.</p>

    <p>Facing Wang Ling's upper body, Joyce was of course moved.</p>

    <p>He felt that his perseverance in abandoning his sister over the years had moved God and received God's salvation.</p>

    <p>After Wang Ling releases the upper body state.</p>

    <p>Joyce knelt on his knees, looked up at the sky with his hands in prayer, and thanked God for Shengze with the most pious eyes.</p>

    <p>Joyce: "Lord! Thank you Lord! If the Lord would use my body! You're welcome to call me anytime!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Is it done?"</p>

    <p>At this time Wang Ling turned his attention to the tablet on the desktop.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling already had the idea of giving it away.</p>

    <p>So.</p>

    <p>Send it. It must be sent.</p>

    <p>But Apple Aid is still useful for the time being.</p>

    <p>"During the time when I was in the Lord's body, I had figured out the identities of several people in the spiritual space."</p>

    <p>The book of Sage Immortal states the results of its own deductions.</p>

    <p>The seven people in the foundation are all foreign cultivators.</p>

    <p>However, we cannot rule out the possibility that some of these foreign cultivators may be colluding with the General Alliance.</p>

    <p>Among them, the collusion probability of tanks is as high as 87%. It is the object of key observation.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling clicked on the tank's information.</p>

    <p>The true full name of the chariot envoy was discovered: Toy Delray.</p>

    <p>He is the boss of a multinational spirit sword production company. He controls more than twenty giant spirit sword production and processing factories.</p>

    <p>Every year, some of the mass-produced spirit swords in the Huaxiu Kingdom are obtained from Toy Delray.</p>

    <p>What surprised Wang Ling even more.</p>

    <p>This Toy Del Rey actually seems to be related by blood to a person Wang Ling knows.</p>

    <p>Inferred based on bloodline analysis in the Sage Immortal book.</p>

    <p>Toy Del Rey's DNA is highly similar to Yi Zhiyang.</p>

    <p>Two people. Actually have a father-son relationship?</p>

    <p>But Yi Zhiyang has been alone since he was a child.</p>

    <p>It was after General Yi took a fancy to his talent and accepted him as his disciple.</p>

    <p>Life is gradually getting better.</p>

    <p>To be honest, without this bloodline data.</p>

    <p>It's hard for Wang Ling to imagine that Yi Zhiyang has foreign ancestry.</p>

    <p>It seems that Yi Zhiyang may have inherited a little more of his mother's genes.</p>

    <p>And his mother is definitely an authentic oriental beauty.</p>

    <p>"Continue investigating."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling continues to give orders to the Book of Sage Immortal.</p>

    <p>He needs to know who Yi Zhiyang's mother is.</p>

    <p>As long as his mother is within the scope of the earth, through comparison with large databases, there are always possible clues to be found.</p>

    <p>It may take a while to find it.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling has plenty of time now.</p>

    <p>In fact. In this information currently provided by the Sage Immortal book.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling also found another interesting set of data.</p>

    <p>That is the inference about the identity of Judgment Messenger Number 4.</p>

    <p>Although the Sage Immortal Book gave a 76% probability to a person named "Michelle."</p>

    <p>But there is still a probability of 24 shown.</p>

    <p>This "Michelle" has most likely been transferred.</p>

    <p>"Bai Zhe."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at this familiar name. He smiled in his heart.</p>

    <p>He didn't expect that Xiaoqiang's vitality would be so tenacious.</p>
