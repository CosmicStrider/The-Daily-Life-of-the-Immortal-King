  <h1>Chapter 1921 Goddess and Goddess Immortal</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This time we went to the inner earth world to participate in the competition. It was a phalanx composed of selected cultivation colleges represented by the country. Because of the entrance advantage, the Huaxiu country could bring an extra team of seven people in.</p>

    <p>So in theory, there is no so-called competitive relationship between Shengke and Number 60 High School. Because after arriving in the inner earth world, everyone's guns are aligned with the outside world.</p>

    <p>The top priority should be how to unite and cooperate in the inner earth world and win glory for the country.</p>

    <p>However, Su Xingyue's visit this time was under the instruction of Dai Tianchun, the current principal of Sheng Ke.</p>

    <p>According to Dai Kuangmo's temper, Su Xingyue guessed that one reason may be that the current principal is curious and intends to test Number 60 High School. Another reason may be that he wants to share the collected data. Share with allied universities.</p>

    <p>Just like the relationship between Number 60 High School and Number 59 High School. Although on the surface it is a competitive relationship, in fact there is also a covenant of cooperation and progress in private.</p>

    <p>This is also the case with Shengke.</p>

    <p>Even though Shengke currently sits firmly on the throne of the top university, it can sit in this position all year round. The awareness of being prepared for danger in times of peace is extremely forward-looking.</p>

    <p>Even someone as powerful as Shengke still has allies.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Su Xingyue guessed after getting the data. It is very likely that this data will also be provided to the second-ranked university in the country. Jingmen Number 8 High School, referred to as Jingba High School.</p>

    <p>Of course, these are just Su Xingyue's current guesses. She is actually a little irritated because the contact lenses and gloves given by Shengke were burned out...</p>

    <p>But she had already come to a conclusion about Number 60 High School. So after saying goodbye to Principal Chen and Vice Principal Jin Deng, she directly edited a WeChat message to Dai Tianchun.</p>

    <p>There are only four words: nothing to be afraid of.</p>

    <p>This time, Su Xingyue came very suddenly. Of course, Principal Chen was not completely unprepared.</p>

    <p>After sending Su Xingyue away, he continued to leave Wang Ling and others in the office to lecture. After thinking about it for a long time, he said, "Dear classmates, you have also seen...the person who came here is not evil."</p>

    <p>After all, it is currently the number one high school. The person sent to Number 60 High School is one of its aces. That kind of temperament is unforgettable as soon as it appears.</p>

    <p>Even the aura of the goddess on Sun Rong has dimmed a lot due to it. To be honest, Su Xingyue is more like the immortal goddess who only appears in the paintings of secret landscapes.</p>

    <p>But in fact, when facing Su Xingyue, most people here except Chen Chao and Guo Hao were extremely calm.</p>

    <p>After all, they are all people who have seen the big world.</p>

    <p>And let me tell you something. Wang Ling honestly thought that if Sun Rong was wearing that bright-moon glazed Hanfu, he could directly press Su Xingyue to the ground and rub her.</p>

    <p>But now in school, everyone wears the same uniform.</p>

    <p>People rely on clothes. Wang Ling feels that when the conditions are not uniform, there is really no comparison.</p>

    <p>At this time, Principal Chen continued: "Perhaps everyone has guessed it. This time there is a large-scale competition. And it is a national competition. Students from two schools will be selected to be integrated and sent out as representatives. But it can We can't go. We are still unknown. As far as I know, this time Sheng Ke sent Su Xingyue to come. It was actually for testing."</p>

    <p>"Isn't it that Shengke wants to test us?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"Well, classmate Sun Rong is really smart. Shengke ranked first. Their quota for the competition has been determined. The second school will be decided through the recommendation of the top school. It will even be decided after a comprehensive evaluation. Already."</p>

    <p>At this point, Principal Chen's voice suddenly fell silent for a while. After a while, he said in a deep voice: "And our opponents. There are many... Although Shangfeng has selected a group, we, Number 60 High School, are also among them. But the overall quality of other universities is better than ours."</p>

    <p>"Shengke sent Su Xingyue here this time. It was not to test for themselves. It was obviously to test their allied colleges."</p>

    <p>Principal Chen said leisurely.</p>

    <p>Although Principal Chen's level is not as high as that of other university principals, after all, with his current level, the other principals can be frightened. I am afraid that only Principal Chen can do it.</p>

    <p>Arranging troops and figuring out the opponent's intentions has always been one of Principal Chen's strengths.</p>

    <p>In addition, Number 60 High School also has a relationship with an ally school. Therefore, Principal Chen has already understood the intention of Shengke's trip.</p>

    <p>"Everyone in the office now, as well as some senior students who are in class but are not here, are all elite representatives of our Number 60 High School. But this time there are only seven places. The big list still needs to pass a comprehensive evaluation. Decision. No matter who is selected in the end. I hope everyone will not have any resentment in their hearts."</p>

    <p>Principal Chen said: "We are a collective. No matter who goes in the end, the honors we get belong to everyone."</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly Wang Ling, Principal Chen actually left them here to lecture them just to explain this matter.</p>

    <p>But now it is still unknown whether we can go. The key depends on the final decision of the upper leadership.</p>

    <p>Although their Number 60 High School has miraculously passed the first round of screening, but as Principal Chen said, which high school they went to this time is not better than them?</p>

    <p>In addition, Shengke also sent his ally High School Jingmen Number 8 High School to collect information. Wang Ling was actually very relieved. He felt that the probability of Number 60 High School "winning" this time was very slim.</p>

    <p>So originally Wang Ling was quite nervous before coming.</p>

    <p>Now after listening to Principal Chen's introduction, I feel much more at ease instantly.</p>

    <p>First. There is still a question whether Number 60 High School can be selected.</p>

    <p>Second, the selection of the big list this time needs to go through a comprehensive evaluation. And the person who makes the decision may not be the one who can make the decision.</p>

    <p>In other words, even if Number 60 High School is finally chosen, Wang Ling feels that those who go may not necessarily get their turn.</p>

    <p>He did a little better in the monthly exam this time. His extraordinary performance was short-lived.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High School is now full of experts. Nine people have been called to the office alone. Not counting the elite class students in the senior class. If counted according to current standards, there are at least three people in Number 60 High School. More than a dozen people qualify.</p>

    <p>If this is a continuous hit, Wang Ling feels that the probability is too low. It can't be judged by himself.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When school was over in the afternoon, Wang Ling was packing up his textbooks. He originally planned to go home directly. But then he saw someone handing a pack of crispy noodles to him.</p>

    <p>The person who handed him something was Sun Rong. However, the thing was not given by Sun Rong. It was just handed over on his behalf: "Wang Ling. This is what Teacher Pan asked me to give you. He said it was the reward this time."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was shocked. This was the first time he received such a generous reward from Teacher Pan.</p>

    <p>And what makes him even more horrified is that the package Teacher Pan gave him was actually a new flavor released this month. It came in a golden plastic bag! A limited edition at the canteen!</p>

    <p>He suppressed his look of surprise and stopped pretending. He opened the bag of crispy noodles directly in front of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>There was no one else in the classroom. Sun Rong stared so boldly at Wang Ling's face that was slightly red with excitement. Although she still had no expression, she felt like this in her heart Wang Ling Very happy.</p>

    <p>"Hey. There seems to be a card. It's a golden card." Suddenly. Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"Um?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling takes out the card.</p>

    <p>He remembered the new crispy noodles. For the sake of environmental protection, the card collection function has been cancelled. All of them are scanned the QR code in the bag. Cards are drawn through the Internet. After collecting the corresponding card set, you can replace the real thing.</p>

    <p>Cash rewards. Virtual prop rewards. Even practice resources!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is confused. Why is there an extra card in this new package?</p>

    <p>Could it be a bug?</p>

    <p>He took out the card, tore open the plastic sleeve, and looked at the card carefully.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was shocked to find out.</p>

    <p>This is no ordinary crispy noodle card.</p>

    <p>But an invitation letter from Songhai City·Zhuquemen·Jiutian Teahouse...</p>
