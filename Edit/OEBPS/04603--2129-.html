  <h1>Chapter 2129 Wang Ling was discovered?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: What is it like to have multiple jobs? This is a wonder that Wang Ling has never experienced before. He seriously doubts that if it continues to develop according to the plot of the game, it is very likely that he will develop into a "full-time master"...</p>

    <p>However, wearing multiple hats may seem troublesome. But in the end, everything I do is just paving the way for Mr. Zanghu.</p>

    <p>The real protagonist of Operation Wall Breaker is Mr. Zanghu. And he is just an ordinary high school student, the Immortal King. What game does he know? What does he know about the Immortal King...</p>

    <p>This ten-hole demon master was extinguished. Now Wang Ling has become the new master. Although the number of controllable ten-hole demon spirits is limited, the demon spirits do not require material consumption. They are natural labor porters and are responsible for resources. Mining is the best.</p>

    <p>At the same time, no player has obtained the hidden identity of the Demon Lord during the game's internal beta. In the hearts of many righteous players, from the perspective of modern human monks, collaborating with demon spirits is an extremely incorrect choice.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the way they control demon spirits is not to become demon lords to rule them. Instead, they achieve "enslavement" through hierarchical suppression. Therefore, this is completely different from Wang Ling's current method of controlling demon spirits.</p>

    <p>Because of the identity of the Shidong Demon Lord, Wang Ling is in complete control. The loyalty of demon spirits is very high and they will not rebel easily.</p>

    <p>In the game world of Itinerant Immortal, you want to "enslave" demon spirits through level suppression.</p>

    <p>Although the demon spirits will not lose food, they will lose their patience. In other words, once their patience collapses, some demon spirits will directly rebel and cause the surrounding demon spirits and the normal human monk labor force to die together in a vigorous manner.</p>

    <p>This is a bit of a waste.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling himself is not that disgusted with the identity of the demon lord. After all, the demon world today is also on good terms with humans in the real world. And it was Wang Ling who conquered the entire demon world at the beginning.</p>

    <p>Although there are still some human monks on the earth who insist that it is impossible for the demon world to coexist peacefully with human monks. But after all, they are only a small number of people.</p>

    <p>It's impossible to change everyone's ideas. Even if Wang Ling could do it, he wouldn't want to do that. An existence that can influence human thinking and will is very scary.</p>

    <p>And this is the fundamental purpose of their implementation of the Wall Breaker plan this time.</p>

    <p>The Huaxiu civilization has survived to this day and remains unchanged. It has experienced prosperity and decline. It does not invade foreign countries. The only concept it holds is world peace and harmony.</p>

    <p>But in the current world of cultivation, there is always a lot of rumors and slander against Huaxiu and the Huaxiu monks. Now it is indeed time for the world's monks to see the truth...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling arranged for 499 demon spirits to participate in the work of collecting materials. This move actually caused the happiness index of his residents in Fuyun Town to drop by 10%.</p>

    <p>Human-monsters have different paths. The thinking mode of NPCs in the game still naturally has a feeling of disgust and repulsion towards monsters. And this probability is actually similar to the ratio in the real world.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p>Regarding the detailed data in this area, Bai Qiao's investigation is indeed very rigorous and completely in line with the rules.</p>

    <p>The happiness index of a town is very important. This is also the key to affecting the quality of "Wolongs" that can be recruited in the future.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling knows that such a decrease is only temporary. As long as the town can be built well, the existence of some demon spirits as labor force will only cause a decrease in the happiness index.</p>

    <p>He no longer thought about it. Instead, he used the last remaining little demon spirit to guide him and began to explore the surrounding areas.</p>

    <p>"Hey... General, wait for me!" Sun Rong shouted after him from behind.</p>

    <p>To be honest, she has no clue now. She doesn't know how to help the town develop. In addition to using the system interface to coordinate command work and deployment remotely, the only thing left to do is to follow the Fuyun Town general... Gaining experience?</p>

    <p>This is completely different from the way she imagined playing the game!</p>

    <p>She thought she and Wang Ling would have a wonderful encounter, and then they would support each other and grow together after the encounter. She even thought about everything. She also stacked her defense points to the highest level. She planned to meet Wang LingWork together as a human shield and nanny.</p>

    <p>This turned out to be a good thing. She gained experience along the way and soared.</p>

    <p>And this is also within the calculation of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>After all, his card level is already Strategy now. However, there are many inconveniences when the level is always locked at level 1. For example, when he subsequently moves to a more advanced map to open a mission, he cannot take on the mission if he is only at level 1. So this In this case, you can only form a group with Sun Rong. She will take over the task. And you only need to be responsible for completing the task.</p>

    <p>So I took Sun Rong to improve her experience. Of course, it was also within Wang Ling's plan.</p>

    <p>Eh... To put it simply, he needs Sun Rong. And now Sun Rong also needs him.</p>

    <p>After all, killing the boss instantly is something that only Wang Ling can do right now.</p>

    <p>But the level difference loophole. Wang Ling feels like a game bug... After all, it cannot be ruled out that some people may have a small chance of getting the same type of god-level skills in the novice village.</p>

    <p>Although the probability of getting such a god-level skill is one in ten million. But as Wang Ling said, since there are people who have been fighting monsters in the novice map for more than ten years, it does not rule out that there are people. For more than ten years, I have been working hard for a book of exercises...</p>

    <p>"General? Where are we going?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong asked later. But the NPC general obviously showed his autistic characteristics again. He never replied to her.</p>

    <p>However, Sun Rong can vaguely get some ideas from the actions of Wang Ling in front of him.</p>

    <p>She saw from the system operation panel that 499 demon spirits had joined the material collection team. But the general in front of her left one behind to lead them somewhere.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong immediately thought that the general of Fuyun Town was probably letting this demon spirit lead the way. Go and collect all the other demon caves!</p>

    <p>Was this the original plan...</p>

    <p>But the question is, is this the idea that NPCs should have...</p>

    <p>But the NPC in front of me really looks like an NPC!</p>

    <p>For a moment, Sun Rong's heart was entangled and wavering. www.uukanshu.net She looked at Wang Ling's back. She felt that familiar feeling coming back.</p>

    <p>Under the leadership of the little demon, she and Wang Ling finally arrived at the entrance of the Hundred Cave Area. The map showed that there were a total of one hundred demon caves with demon spirits. The total number of demons exceeded 5,000 demons. And every level is higher than the current one.</p>

    <p>The most important thing is that this Hundred Cave Demon Lord is also an extraordinary person. He is an order of magnitude stronger than the Ten Cave Demon Lord. All levels start at level 30.</p>

    <p>There are 100,000 blood!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's mind was not on the Hundred Cave Demon Lord. She just stared at the back of the Fuyun Town general for a while.</p>

    <p>Then he shouted out of nowhere: "Simply noodles! There are crispy noodles!"</p>

    <p>At this moment, the figure walking in front of me hesitated slightly after hearing this call...</p>
