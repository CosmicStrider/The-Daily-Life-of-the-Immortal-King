  <h1>Chapter 1505 Laogan Goose</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The sunrise on Tiangan Mountain is so beautiful. Everything comes to life in the peaceful atmosphere. It is refreshing and refreshing.</p>

    <p>A sense of comfort and pleasure can be produced in the mind.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong looked at Wang Ling out of the corner of his eye. Although he did not hold the boy's hand directly, he felt an unprecedented sense of peace of mind and a great satisfaction in his heart.</p>

    <p>Also suddenly, she found that her desire was even lower than she imagined.</p>

    <p>Even if it's just holding hands...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong is looking forward to the day when the wooden boy can take the initiative to hold her hand.</p>

    <p>Maybe this day wouldn't come too soon. But she thought it shouldn't be too far away either.</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng said that as long as you spend enough time and patience, it can always be done.</p>

    <p>She has a lot of time, a lot of patience and a love that is far beyond the imagination of a teenager...</p>

    <p>One year, two years, five years...</p>

    <p>Ten years...</p>

    <p>Looking at the brilliant morning glow in front of her, the girl believed that one day her heart would be like the ray of sunshine in front of her that penetrated the clouds and mist, melting all the frozen hearts.</p>

    <p>Facing the rising sun and shining the warm sunshine, Yingxian Heming laid out a thick and soft picnic table mat at the sunrise observation point on the top of Tiangan Mountain.</p>

    <p>As the first foreign minister of the Jiugong family, Yingxian Heming is already very skilled in reception matters. He is not only thoughtful, but also very formal and ritualistic.</p>

    <p>He was dressed in a tuxedo suit. He looked like a chic black butler. He was concentrating on placing the barbecue in the wooden house on the tray.</p>

    <p>At this time, Yingxian Heming held white gloves and a crystal knife. With an extremely precise operation, he evenly cut off thin slices of meat and distributed them on gorgeous dinner plates.</p>

    <p>"This meat doesn't seem to be fully cooked?" Zhai Yin asked.</p>

    <p>"Teacher Yu Sui has a good eye. This is top-quality dragon pork. I only grilled it until it is nine-tenths of a degree rare. The remaining one point needs to be cooked with the help of today's sun."</p>

    <p>Yingxian Heming smiled slightly.</p>

    <p>Then he cracked a few raw eggs on the meat slices on the dinner plate. At some point, he took out two huge condenser lenses in his hand, which condensed the brilliance of the sunrise onto the dinner plate.</p>

    <p>The egg whites, egg liquid and the meat slices sandwiched between them are roasted and matured little by little. They exude a hot aroma.</p>

    <p>"What a special way to do it." Zhai Yin was always interested in cooking, and she felt that she had learned, so she looked at Wang Ming: "When I go back, I'll make it for you too?"</p>

    <p>"Murder your husband. This is a serious crime..." Wang Ming said tremblingly.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin rolled her eyes at Wang Ming: "Don't believe it. My craftsmanship is so good now! I'll try it myself first! Make sure it's safe, and then I'll give it to you!"</p>

    <p>"Yinzi. No! Why do you do that to yourself!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Lively breakfast. Two people bickering.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong looked at it and couldn't help but chuckle.</p>

    <p>Sometimes she often thinks about it.</p>

    <p>Such a little quarrel is also a little happiness.</p>

    <p>Very romantic.</p>

    <p>And such a small happiness.</p>

    <p>In fact, she also wants to have...</p>

    <p>This is the first time Wang Ling has seen such cooking techniques. He couldn't help but want to taste it. Just as he was about to use his chopsticks, he saw Yingxian Heming suddenly stretched out his hand: "Classmate, wait a minute. The most important thing when eating this dish is to eat it." Comes with chili sauce."</p>

    <p>"Chili sauce?" At this moment, everyone focused their attention on Yingxian Heming.</p>

    <p>"Yes. Use this dish. The most important thing is to use this bottle of chili sauce." Yingxian Heming took out a whole bottle from the storage bag. It is a brand-new packaged limited edition.</p>

    <p>"Oh...I know this! Lao Gan Goose Chili Sauce! This is a limited edition!"</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin recognized this bottle of expensive-looking chili sauce with a crystal outer packaging at a glance: "It is said that the production process of this limited edition chili sauce is very complicated. The chili peppers in it are all carefully selected small chili peppers."</p>

    <p>"Although this kind of small pepper is small in size, it is actually heavier than ordinary peppers because of its high quality."</p>

    <p>"So before selecting, a large number of peppers will be tied to a flying car."</p>

    <p>"Then use the huge centrifugal force generated by the speeding car on the racing track, especially when turning corners. From the high-speed driving state, these high-quality small peppers are screened out from the special filter!"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling This is the first time I have heard of such a weird method for separating peppers. I was stunned and also wondered why some people in modern society are always so idle.</p>

    <p>"nice!"</p>

    <p>After hearing Zhai Yin's science popularization, Yingxian Heming nodded: "I didn't expect Teacher Yu Jun to know so many things. That's amazing!"</p>

    <p>"No. It's all trivial knowledge."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin was so happy to receive the compliment.</p>

    <p>She has always been interested in cooking.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, I wouldn't have studied art from Mother Juan in the first place.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming had the experience of eating dragon pork chops. In fact, Wang Ming had lingering fears.</p>

    <p>He feels that this problem will be solved sooner or later...</p>

    <p>Otherwise, big problems may occur sooner or later.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was thinking in his mind while watching Yingxian Heming scoop a full spoonful of chili sauce and pour it on his dinner plate.</p>

    <p>"Speaking of which, why is this chili sauce called Lao Gan Goose?" At this time, he asked a question.</p>

    <p>"Because all original chili peppers...are filtered through a penguin that has a certain sensitivity to chili peppers."</p>

    <p>Yingxian Heming said: "Because of being deceived, this penguin's young mind was shocked and suddenly acquired the ability to distinguish peppers. It can distinguish the quality and authenticity of peppers."</p>

    <p>"The authentic chili pepper has a scientific name: Laotuma chili pepper."</p>

    <p>"General low-quality chili peppers. Their scientific name is Lao Shi Ma chili peppers."</p>

    <p>"The ability of this penguin is to recognize clearly whether this little chili pepper is a mama or a papa."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Finally, those selected Laotuma Chili Peppers will be selected again according to the steps mentioned before. The selected high-quality products will be made into limited editions. The ones that are not selected will be made into ordinary Laotuma Chili Pepper Sauce."</p>

    <p>"interesting..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming curled up the corners of his lips. He picked up the dinner plate and took a bite of Yingxian Heming's special dish with chopsticks.</p>

    <p>Then I felt a surge of heat in my whole body. I actually felt a sense of comfort all over my body!</p>

    <p>Very good taste!</p>

    <p>His eyes lit up.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling chewed quietly. His face was also bright red.</p>

    <p>Food can stimulate a person's sense of joy. This statement is true.</p>

    <p>Even Wang Ling. Although there is no expression on his face, it is not difficult to judge from his face that Wang Ling has a sense of happiness at the moment.</p>

    <p>This is the first time that Wang Ming and Sun Rong have seen Wang Ling react like this to food other than crispy noodles.</p>

    <p>It seems that the dish prepared by Yingxian Heming really touches people's hearts.</p>

    <p>"It's great that you are all satisfied. It's my honor."</p>

    <p>Yingxian Heming said in fluent Chinese, with a faint smile on his face: "By the way, everyone. I just received news from Jiudaohe High School. Because of the exchange student program, you will experience it in this high school in the next week. Study and live. Then should we all do as the Romans do and give us a localized name?"</p>

    <p>Localized name?</p>

    <p>Something surprising. Wang Ling seemed to have been prepared for it. He did it without thinking.</p>

    <p>Write your name directly on the ground in the void.</p>

    <p>Wang Houlang...</p>
