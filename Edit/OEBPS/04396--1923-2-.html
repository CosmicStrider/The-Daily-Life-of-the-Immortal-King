  <h1>Chapter 1923 2 PleaseWang Ling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Despite Su Xingyue's unworldly appearance, she is actually a well-known social butterfly in St. Corey. Almost every school has such a person who plays the role of liaising with other schools to expand relationships and enhance friendship.</p>

    <p>Of course, it is not free for Su Xingyue to pass on information. As the Number 8 high school in the country, the student union actually spent a lot of money to obtain Shengke's intelligence data.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, these costs were agreed upon and delivered in one go. There is no need to consider the issue of subsequent bleeding.</p>

    <p>However, as the student union president of Jingmen Number 8 High School, Li Changzhe still has a headache.</p>

    <p>Tianyuan Grass, Earthly Flower, Eight-foot Jade, Nine-Desolate Lotus Seed...these rare heavenly materials and earthly treasures on the market. It took him a long time to collect them for Su Xingyue. It can be said to be a real hemorrhage.</p>

    <p>But he really had no other choice. After all, Jingmen Number 8 High School was in Jinghua City and not in the same city as Number 60 High School. To find out information about Number 60 High School, it was most convenient for Shengke to take action.</p>

    <p>While receiving the latest news from Su Xingyue, Li Changzhe, the student union president of Jingmen Number 8 High School, was staring at the crab shell on his hand in deep thought.</p>

    <p>Although I don't know why there are engravings in the crab shell.</p>

    <p>But actually tell him. It does.</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe had no idea how this was done. It was such a fresh crab. After it was cooked and matured, he opened it and saw that there was an inscription on the invitation letter of Jiutian Teahouse inside the shell...</p>

    <p>Did the crab inadvertently peel off the shell and carve it and then reinstall it?</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe felt it was outrageous.</p>

    <p>And obviously, the other party came prepared. Because it seems that not many people know that they like to eat crabs.</p>

    <p>"How are you going?" asked a girl with long dark blue hair in the student union office.</p>

    <p>"You have to go. And Su Xingyue just sent me a message. I must pay attention to it. It seems that this senior Teng from Jiutian Teahouse is indeed not an ordinary person..."</p>

    <p>"Listening to what you said, it sounds like you have some understanding?"</p>

    <p>"Well. I went to Songhai City once before to have a social event with a foreign school. I also heard some rumors about the teahouse master Fuji-senpai. Some people said that even if any one of the current ten generals comes to visit the teahouse, he must be careful. The manager of this teahouse is very respectful."</p>

    <p>"Oh my god. Who is this?" The girl with long dark blue hair was stunned.</p>

    <p>"It's not clear yet. But there's definitely nothing wrong with paying more attention to it. And this senior definitely invited more than just me. I'm afraid he also invited everyone else on the recommendation list in his own way. So go take a look. It will also be convenient for us. Understand the situation."</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe frowned, with a serious look on his face. Then he stood up immediately: "Okay. I'll go over now and pack the crabs to eat on the way!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, on the other side, Wang Ling was also staring at this golden invitation card, lost in thought.</p>

    <p>After being stunned for a moment, he stood up and threw the card into the trash can nearby.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong holds her forehead. She knew it would be like this...</p>

    <p>Different people have completely different attitudes towards cards. Faced with an invitation from a stranger, Sun Rong feels that Wang Ling is the correct response!</p>

    <p>Jiutian Tea House. They don't know where this place is. What if there is danger?</p>

    <p>What should I do if I arrive at a teahouse and the manager of the teahouse makes me sleepy black tea?</p>

    <p>All these issues need to be considered.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong feels that young people should have this ability to think independently and identify dangers.</p>

    <p>As expected of classmate Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>In fact, before handing the noodles to Wang Ling, Sun Rong also received an invitation letter to Jiutian Tea House... and the way the invitation was given was outrageous. Although I didn't know who the other party was. How did you do it? But the other party actually carved words directly on the toffee that Wang Ling gave her!</p>

    <p>In other words, the person who sent the invitation must be someone close to her... There is a possibility that there is an insider in the villa where she lives!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling gave her a full sack of these toffees last time. Most of them were stored in the bank's fresh-keeping warehouse. She usually only kept three of them as backup for dangerous situations.</p>

    <p>He could steal her toffee so accurately, carve words on it without anyone noticing, and finally return it to her.</p>

    <p>And the time when she wants to eat candy is quite accurate, and she is expected to open the one with the words engraved on it... all of this. Only the acquaintances around her can do it.</p>

    <p>And Sun Rong felt that he must have received some psychological suggestion indirectly and unintentionally. Otherwise, it would not have been possible for him to want to eat toffee on a whim.</p>

    <p>This is a precious toffee given to her by Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>After seeing the engraving on the toffee before. Sun Rong has actually been hesitating about what to do.</p>

    <p>Now she knows.</p>

    <p>Who cares about Jiutian Teahouse...</p>

    <p>Eat this toffee first and then talk.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>ZhuquemenÂ·Jiutian Teahouse, Songhai City. Teng Luchen was fishing by the pond in the backyard of the teahouse.</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu came to the door again. This was the first time he returned to the backyard. He was surprised to find the doorway to the pond in the backyard. A small pond connected the space of all lakes and seas. Teng Luchen held a bamboo fishing rod. It has the artistic conception of Jiang Taigong fishing.</p>

    <p>It's just that this pond is connected to all the lakes and seas. It's not surprising that nothing can be caught...</p>

    <p>"After receiving the invitation letter, how did they react?" It seemed that he already knew the purpose of Jing Heqiu's visit. Teng Luchen asked straight to the point.</p>

    <p>"Teng Lao is very knowledgeable about things. Shengke, Jingba... those higher-ranking colleges and universities pay special attention to it. Li Changzhe from Jingba is already on the way. He will arrive today."</p>

    <p>"Heh. He is quite positive."</p>

    <p>"Qu Shuling from Shengke just tried it out on the street. He didn't come in directly."</p>

    <p>"Hey. It is indeed the number one university. This cautious style is worth learning." Teng Luchen nodded. He was particularly satisfied with Qu Shuling.</p>

    <p>"Maybe they already know Teng Lao's identity. Then..."</p>

    <p>"It's impossible for them to know my identity. But based on their experience, it's not surprising that they can guess something." Teng Luchen shook his head slightly and said with a smile, "By the way. What about the other high schools. I want to know how they react. Like."</p>

    <p>"People sent by other universities are already exploring the location of Jiutian Teahouse. The only thing..."</p>

    <p>When Jing Heqiu said this, he paused and his face looked a little ugly.</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen asked: "Only what. Tell me clearly."</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu hesitated for a moment. Then he took out a crumpled golden invitation card from his sleeve: "I found this from the trash can in Number 60 High School... Mr. Teng. They are going too far." In my opinion, the quota for Number 60 High School should be canceled directly. They were not in the top 30 in the first place. It is a great grace to let them be included in the list!"</p>

    <p>"Is that what you think?"</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen immediately laughed and looked at Jing Heqiu with a "you are too young" look: "I think this kid from Number 60 High School has the most personality."</p>

    <p>"Then now..."</p>

    <p>"This Wang... uh... I suddenly can't remember his name. Anyway, this classmate Wang. Please come to your door in person and invite him over." Teng Luchen said.</p>
