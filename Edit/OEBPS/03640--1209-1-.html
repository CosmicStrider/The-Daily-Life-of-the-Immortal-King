  <h1>Chapter 1209 Nan 1 Show Pair Wang Ling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The ability to stop the entire universe. Wang Ling is not often used.</p>

    <p>This is an ability he realized when he was 12 years old.</p>

    <p>The reason why it is not commonly used is that it places a heavy load on King's Eyes. The main damage is as follows: temporary dryness of the eyes... several drops of eye drops are needed to calm down.</p>

    <p>The key is that there will be some problems with the eyesight after the application. Pause for 1 second. The degree will temporarily increase by 10Â°.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling is in the process of pausing. He will complete what he wants to do as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>After arranging everything, Wang Ling will withdraw its power.</p>

    <p>The success or failure of a battle often depends on the details. When the wheel of time resumed rolling, the expression on Yi Zhiyang's face was obviously stunned.</p>

    <p>"This...when exactly?" He felt that four clone Aohai were already aimed at his butt!</p>

    <p>Obviously it didn't exist before!</p>

    <p>He didn't know when it suddenly appeared behind him!</p>

    <p>The tailbone is his life gate. The sword energy barrier on the butt is also the weakest part. He didn't expect Sun Rong to be able to do this at such a tense moment. Not only did he see his life Where the door is. He even launched an extremely precise attack!</p>

    <p>The distance is too short. It's too late to rebuild the defense!</p>

    <p>At the last moment, with the four clones Aohai piercing the tail defense, Yi Zhiyang's life gate was broken. The sword energy all over his body was like a broken balloon. It poured out like a landslide and tsunami. It formed a terrifying situation for a moment. Waves of sword intent burst out in all directions.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong saw that the situation was not good. He used all the remaining clones Aohai to protect all the members of Number 60 High School. He was at the front alone.</p>

    <p>However, the power of the Sword Intention Surge was too strong. Her clone Aohai kept breaking like dominoes... When the last clone Aohai shattered. Sun Rong's whole person was blown away by the Sword Intent Surge.</p>

    <p>Almost at the same time, the golden protective talismans of Yi Zhiyang and Sun Rong were both triggered. They died together.</p>

    <p>"It's actually a draw..." Many people looked at this scene in disbelief.</p>

    <p>All the principals in the command center were completely silent. Even though Yi Zhiyang had already used the ultimate killing move like Sun Rong, he still reached a tie with Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>The principals who had previously been on Yi Zhiyang's side lowered their heads and fell into silence. This was indeed a peak showdown under the Golden Core. Yi Zhiyang was terrifyingly strong. With {Wuji Sword} activated, he could even fight against the Golden Core.</p>

    <p>And Sun Rong's strategic layout and insight ability are even more amazing. Even when the combat power is at a disadvantage, he can still accurately find opportunities to reverse the situation of the battle...</p>

    <p>Although the final result was a draw, in fact, in the eyes of many principals present, the winner was obvious.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong fell into a coma immediately after being knocked away. The golden protective amulet is automatically triggered when life is judged to be in danger. The girl just stood in the front with her own power. Save Number 60 High School. Others. Rely on the remaining clone Aohai to resolve the huge pressure brought by the surge of sword intent.</p>

    <p>However, in the end, he still failed to keep his golden protective amulet.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling secretly checked Sun Rong and breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>Although he fell into a coma, fortunately his injuries were not serious. He only suffered some minor internal injuries.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Yi Zhiyang is the one who really needs to care... If Sun Rong was just standing on the edge of the storm of sword intent, then Yi Zhiyang is the person at the center of the storm. A large number of swords The meaning poured out from his tailbone. When Yi Zhiyang's golden protective talisman was triggered, the whole person fell to the ground with his butt sticking out.</p>

    <p>The posture is too "graceful" and the scene is a mess...</p>

    <p>Compared to the girl who fell down like a water lily here, Yi Zhiyang on the other side is more like a blooming chrysanthemum.</p>

    <p>"The chrysanthemums are broken, the ground is covered with wounds, and your smile has turned yellow..." Guo Hao couldn't help but sigh. This was the worst draw he had ever seen. It was obviously called a draw, but it looked like Sun Rong's great victory. The posture of this fall was also too different.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the current situation at Yi Zhiyang is such that it is impossible to broadcast without mosaic... The members of the resident special operations team rushed over quickly. They were checking Yi Zhiyang's initial injuries. They saw Yi Zhiyang sticking out his snow-white butt. Half of it His head was buried in the soil.</p>

    <p>The rescue team first exposed Yi Zhiyang's face, but did not move his shameful posture. Because they were not sure whether there were any bone fractures in Yi Zhiyang's body. If there were already internal bone fractures, easily turning over at this time would give Yi Zhiyang Cause secondary damage.</p>

    <p>"Has the scene been cut off?"</p>

    <p>"It's been cut off."</p>

    <p>"This is too pitiful...it's clearly a draw..."</p>

    <p>"Stop talking. Check first."</p>

    <p>The team members used the magic weapons in their hands to comprehensively identify and detect Yi Zhiyang's injuries.</p>

    <p>"The upper body is basically fine. But the lower body is a bit miserable. There are fractures in the pelvis and leg bones. And... there is an anal fissure..."</p>

    <p>The rescue team member spoke very quietly, but Chen Chao still heard what he said. Chen Chao stood on the side and smiled: "Oh, it's cracked. How come there's no blood?"</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Yi Zhiyang's butt was like a fountain, spilling a large amount of blood...</p>

    <p>When the rescue team saw this, they sighed inwardly: When the landslide occurs, not a single drop of blood is innocent...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>About ten minutes later, the live scene returned. Yi Zhiyang and Sun Rong were both picked up by members of the special operations team.</p>

    <p>So only Tang Jingze, Guo Hao, Nan Yixiu and Wang Ling were left in the scene. The last four people.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong is the biggest backer of Number 60 High School. Being eliminated with Yi Zhiyang is the most ideal result that Nan Yixiu can think of!</p>

    <p>The remaining three people. In terms of overall combat power, Nan Yixiu is absolutely confident that he can win! You know, he is the captain of Nanhai Tianzhong!</p>

    <p>The only one who is a bit more difficult to deal with may be Tang Jingze from Number 59 High School. But so what?</p>

    <p>That Guo Hao is not a good person either. After the fight between Tang Jingze and Guo Hao, no matter who wins, there will definitely be losses for the winning side.</p>

    <p>And his battle with Wang Ling was completely effortless!</p>

    <p>So. Before the start of the third round of the showdown, Nan Yixiu took the initiative to look at Wang Ling. He looked like he was sure of winning: "Classmate Wang Ling. It's our turn next time. What do you want to say? Of?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The preparation time passed quickly. The duel between Nan Yixiu and Wang Ling officially began. After the third round of the immortal fight under Golden Core, this duel seemed a little boring.</p>

    <p>Nanhai Tianzhong is a school famous all over the world for its perception-based magic. Therefore, everyone does not expect Nan Yixiu to show off in battle.</p>

    <p>As for Wang Ling on the other side, it's just a mascot. It seems like there's nothing to talk about.</p>

    <p>So. When no one was optimistic about it, Wang Ling calmly inserted the pockets of his school pants and slowly walked onto the duel stage...</p>

    <p>He is thinking about a very serious question.</p>

    <p>What kind of magic can be used to avoid killing Nan Yixiu and win this game in a low-key manner?</p>
