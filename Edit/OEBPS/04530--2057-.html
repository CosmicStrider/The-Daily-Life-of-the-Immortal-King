  <h1>Chapter 2057 Intimate Dao Ancestor</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: This Dao Ancestor Wang is too considerate. He has almost thought out everything for him, down to the smallest detail. So if it is really as he guessed, Dao Ancestor Wang should be on their side. Talent vs....</p>

    <p>Wang Ling held his chin and thought slightly. Previously, he speculated that Dao Ancestor Wang might use the method of soul planting to resurrect his body. He used the bones of the ancestor of the Sun family who were also Eternals.</p>

    <p>So based on the new speculation, the situation needs to be classified and discussed again.</p>

    <p>The first conclusion. If Dao Ancestor Wang has been planted on the ancestor of the Sun family, then it stands to reason that as a person on the same front, why has he been reluctant to show up? He has already broken into the fifth map of the ancestral land. And there was a lot of commotion in the middle. With Dao Ancestor Wang's ability, he must have been able to detect the psychic fluctuations during his battle with Xifeng Nian.</p>

    <p>The duel above the Ancestor King realm also involved the Supreme World. Such a powerful confrontation. Dao Ancestor Wang, as the founder of Heavenly Dao, could not have been unaware of it.</p>

    <p>Or is there some other special reason behind this refusal to show up?</p>

    <p>If the above inferences are wrong, then it proves that Wang Ling's original idea was wrong. That is, Dao Ancestor Wang was not planted in the ancestor of the Sun family. And now the corpse of the ancestor of the Sun family must be occupied by another person. And this person also has a great connection with Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>It would be easier if the good guys were on the same front. But if the bad guys...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that this battle is inevitable.</p>

    <p>He is not afraid of fighting.</p>

    <p>Just having to face off against the founder of the Sun family. Wang Ling can't help but feel a little strange.</p>

    <p>This is obviously someone else's home. Someone kindly brought you here to visit. It would be better for you... to directly hack into their system and forcibly enter your fingerprints to take charge of the house. Not only that, but you also want to beat up the owner of the house. A meal...</p>

    <p>Just thinking about it is too much!</p>

    <p>"roar!"</p>

    <p>At this time, the thunder-devouring beast's roar broke Wang Ling's thoughts. This huge stupid bear felt the comfort of thunder bathing for the first time after a long period of "hibernation."</p>

    <p>Although the thunder from the Ten Thousand Thunder Pools is far less powerful than the one on the Tribulation Transcendence Star, it still makes it feel happy.</p>

    <p>Its body began to surge with the power of thunder. It opened its mouth and pointed it at the sky. It began to swallow the entire fifth map of thunder and lightning.</p>

    <p>It took less than a minute. The fifth map, which was covered with thunder and dark clouds, had a clear sky. Not even a trace of power could be squeezed out.</p>

    <p>"Senior, I have taken care of everything. Please feel free to go on your way." Then it turned around and took the initiative to show its goodwill to Wang Ling. It was said that the snow-white body that swelled to the size of a mountain was lying in front of it. In a daze, Wang Ling suddenly thought of Xiao Yin.</p>

    <p>"Senior Ling, please come up. Even if you don't want to accept me as your mount, let me take you for a while. My fur is very soft. Senior Ling just needs to relax." The Thunder Eater begged.</p>

    <p>"Old Lei, listen to my advice. Not every mythical beast is qualified to be a mount." Although the prairie dog is usually very stupid, and the relationship with the Thunder Eater is not particularly good, but at this time it is still He persuaded with earnest words.</p>

    <p>What kind of strength Wang Ling is. If you don't leave any spare energy, you can completely relax. The weight brought about by this strong body density is definitely not something that ordinary people can bear.</p>

    <p>But it is obvious that the Thunder Eater is still young. It is full of confidence: "You don't need to meddle in other people's business. I'll do it!"</p>

    <p>The reason for this confidence is that the Thunder Eater did not have a clear understanding of Wang Ling at this time.</p>

    <p>After all, it was ridden by Dao Ancestor Wang back then. So the current understanding of Wang Ling. The Thunder Eater is that although this boy is very strong, he should not be able to compare with Dao Ancestor Wang. That is the first person in Heavenly Dao Na.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was actually a little excited when he heard that he had to completely relax and sit on it. Because so far, there is no mount that allows him to completely relax and sit on it.</p>

    <p>Even when riding Xiao Yin, I usually have to hold back my strength as much as possible. It took me a lot of light body skills to dare to go up. Although Wang Ling feels that Xiao Yin is now fully capable of bearing his own weight.</p>

    <p>But after all, they are their own children. Wang Ling still cherishes these precious children under his seat.</p>

    <p>So when faced with the Thunder-Eating Beast's request, Wang Ling's first reaction was hesitation. However, after hesitating slightly for a moment, he still couldn't stand the sincere and confident look in his eyes.</p>

    <p>So. The next second Wang Ling flew into the void. He unceremoniously gave up all his strength, released all his weight, and sat directly on the thunder-devouring beast.</p>

    <p>As the Thunder Eater said, the fur on its body is very soft, and the hair is not prickly at all. It feels like sitting on a luxurious high-end leather sofa.</p>

    <p>The body is as big as a mountain. When I lie on it, I feel an indescribable sense of peace of mind. The soft hair is like clouds wrapping Wang Ling in it.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, this comfort did not last long.</p>

    <p>The Thunder Eater hadn't even taken a few steps when its huge body suddenly stopped.</p>

    <p>Then. Poof.</p>

    <p>A mouthful of old blood spurted out directly from the mouth of the Thunder Devouring Beast. It was a bloody fountain. A huge amount of the blood of the divine beast directly irrigated the fifth ancestral land of the Sun family.</p>

    <p>In an instant, this barren land, which was struck by thunder and no spiritual plants could grow, suddenly became a blaze of purple and red. Endless flowers and plants bloomed along with the blood of the mythical beasts absorbed by the land.</p>

    <p>"Why..."</p>

    <p>Seeing this, Wang Ling sighed. He jumped off the bear's back and added a great light body technique to himself.</p>

    <p>He knew this would happen.</p>

    <p>I just didn't expect that this thunder-eating beast was too incompetent. They said it was okay to take two steps. But it turned out that it spurted blood immediately after taking two steps, but it was okay.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling's sitting did indeed directly eliminate the internal injuries of the Thunder Eater. The moment Wang Ling landed, the Thunder Eater also fell down in response, smashing the ground.</p>

    <p>The huge body was like a deflated balloon that had returned to its normal size of three meters before. He lay in a pool of blood, breathing heavily. At the same time, he covered his face with bear claws.</p>

    <p>This is so embarrassing...</p>

    <p>He fell down before taking two steps. www.uukanshu.net</p>

    <p>And it was still in front of that stupid groundhog with whom he didn't have a good relationship.</p>

    <p>This feeling of death on the spot made the Thunder Eater at a loss.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling patted the thunder beast on the head. In fact, it was not that he could not understand this eager attitude of being attentive.</p>

    <p>Mainly because everyone recalled the unruly and confident expression of this guy a few seconds ago. They couldn't help but want to laugh.</p>

    <p>The groundhog laughed wildly: "I'm sorry. We have received professional training. No matter how funny it is, we won't laugh. Unless we can't help it... hahaha..."</p>

    <p>But soon, its smile stopped abruptly, because right under the fifth map, something seemed to be waking up.</p>

    <p>It's the blood of the mythical beast that spews out from the Thunder Eater. It alarms the mysterious creatures hidden in the fifth map...</p>
