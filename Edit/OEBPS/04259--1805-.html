  <h1>Chapter 1805 An Unimagined Road</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Taking action against the church was a path that Maiko Assi had never imagined. Although he had said he wanted to kill the Arch Pope when talking to his friends before, what adults said was often not consistent with what they really thought in their hearts.</p>

    <p>Maiko Assi is well aware of the stakes involved. His attitude towards the Arch Pope may be the same as that of his old father. The Arch Pope may be due to his old age. In addition, his style of dealing with things is more conservative. Therefore, he and Maiko Assi There is a very obvious difference.</p>

    <p>Maiko Assi was dissatisfied with the Arch Pope. Occasionally he would say vicious words like "This old guy, are you going to die?" But he would still be very respectful when he actually saw the Arch Pope.</p>

    <p>It's not because of anything else. It's precisely because the Grand Pope is the uncle of Yuan Zun of Mixiu Country. He is loyal to the country. He is loyal and follows Yuan Zun's lead. Although he acts in a high-profile and arrogant manner, he has never thought about a certain person who usurped power.</p>

    <p>As a legendary general of Mixiu Country, Maiko Assi considers himself to be very professional. But he didn't expect that he would embark on such a path today.</p>

    <p>He actually mistook the Arch Pope for the assassin who broke into his West Wind Castle residence. He was stabbed to death with a sword...</p>

    <p>This put Maiko Assi, who had never collapsed even in the face of hundreds of thousands of enemy troops, into a panic for a while. He didn't know how to face all this. If it was confirmed that the death of the Arch Pope was related to him. Even if it is found out that he was accidentally killed, Yuan Zun has no intention of holding him accountable.</p>

    <p>And he will become the target of concentrated criticism from the public... and all the good reputation he has accumulated in the local cultivation country over the years will be wasted!</p>

    <p>Of course, this is not the most terrifying thing. What he is more worried about is his daughter Maiko Abei. If something happens to him, his daughter will definitely not be able to escape the relationship.</p>

    <p>Although the Arch Pope's level of strength is not high, he still has a lot of loyal believers who have accumulated relying on faith over the years. If something happens to him.</p>

    <p>"Abei! Don't worry...Dad will never let you be implicated..." At this time, Maiko Assi secretly decided in his heart.</p>

    <p>Right now, sacrificing Levi's is the only way.</p>

    <p>He had to do that.</p>

    <p>At the same time, let Levis take down this thunder. He can justifiably send out troops to kill Chilanhui together. When the time comes, kill first and then tell. Kill Levis directly. All the truth will be buried smoothly.</p>

    <p>He would not give Levi's any chance to defend himself.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the top priority right now is to deal with the injuries on the Arch Pope. The real cause of death cannot be concealed. And his sword may have been the Arch Pope's fatal wound.</p>

    <p>This sword penetrated deeply and had a special shape. Only a general's sword could cause such a wound.</p>

    <p>So now Maiko Assi must create the illusion that the Arch Pope is not dead yet, use means to block the wound, repair the sword marks inside, and at the same time replenish the Arch Pope's blood so that his blood can continue to flow in the body.</p>

    <p>Although forging such an illusion will cost Maiko Assi a huge price, but now in order to preserve the current situation and protect his daughter... No matter how high the cost, Maiko Assi has to do it.</p>

    <p>At the same time, in the back garden, Maiko Abe was holding a book and sitting on the swing.</p>

    <p>The head maid looked in the direction of the cobblestone path. She frowned slightly and said, "The general is obviously here. Why hasn't he come yet? Is it because something happened? Do you want to go and have a look, miss?"</p>

    <p>"Don't worry about him."</p>

    <p>Maiko Abei said calmly: "Maybe I met the Arch Pope on the road."</p>

    <p>"The Arch Pope? The Arch Pope is here?"</p>

    <p>"Yes." Maiko Abei said with a smile: "I saw the Arch Pope coming here before. But when I talked to the Arch Pope, he didn't respond. I just reminded him. My father will definitely pass that cobblestone when he comes to visit me today. Xiaoxiao. So it's better for the Arch Pope to wait for him. Do you think my father will kill the Arch Pope as an assassin with one sword? That would be interesting!"</p>

    <p>"The lady was joking."</p>

    <p>The head maid wiped away the cold sweat.</p>

    <p>She smiled bitterly and said: "Assassins have murderous intent on them. If the Arch Pope came to see the general, how could he have murderous intent on him? It must be that the two of them happened to meet and were talking."</p>
    
    <p>Well, that's true." Maiko Abei nodded and continued to look at the collection of essays in her hand.</p>

    <p>"Miss, you have read this collection of essays several times. But why do you only read this one article every time you open it?"</p>

    <p>"You don't understand."</p>

    <p>Myko Abei's eyes flashed and she said: "It's just a speck of dust in the times. It's so beautiful..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After the meeting at St. Peter's Cathedral, Mrs. Lawen and Levis found a private club alone for an appointment. The venue was surrounded by mafia members and white warriors of the Chilan Society. It was clear between black and white.</p>

    <p>"Lawen. Since there are only two of us here, I'll get straight to the point." Levi crossed one leg and stared at Mrs. Lawen and said, "Actually, keeping me safe was not what the Heavenly Dao Alliance and the church meant at the beginning. Yes or no?"</p>

    <p>"Oh? President Levi. Why did you say that?" Mrs. Lawen smiled.</p>

    <p>"Although we, the Chilan Society, are related to the church, as far as the church is concerned, the Chilan Society is just a mafia that occupies some territory in Glio City. It is a dispensable existence."</p>

    <p>Levis said: "It's just that this time it happened that the Office of Strategic Deception and the Huaguo Shuilian Group were to be dealt with. That's why I used the Chilan Society as cannon fodder. Since the Arch Pope is one of the Tengu, then send people from the Tengu to fight with them. I negotiated and it became reasonable. Of course, I also want to thank you. If it weren't for you, Lawen, we might not even have the chance to be cannon fodder."</p>

    <p>"President Li is joking. This is just a temporary measure." Seeing that she couldn't hide it, Mrs. Lawen said bluntly.</p>

    <p>"What benefits did the church promise you when you proposed this program. Is it to take over my presidency when it's done?" Levis laughed, "Raven, you've got a good plan. If you lose this match, not only will you give up control of your Walwolf Cultivation Supermarket, but you will also swallow my Chilan Society."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Mrs. Lawen continued to smile: "But judging from President Li's words, he doesn't seem to resent me too much?"</p>

    <p>"Of course I won't resent you. On the contrary, I would like to thank Lawen... If it weren't for you, I, Levi, would not be able to see the sun tomorrow. Even if I still hate the church. We have cooperated for so many years. They actually weren't even given a chance! If it weren't for you..."</p>

    <p>When Levis said this, his eyes turned red and he gritted his teeth and said, "If I have the chance, I really want to kill that old guy... and cause a bloody storm in St. Peter's!"</p>
