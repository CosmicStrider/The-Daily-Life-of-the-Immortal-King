  <h1>Chapter 1582 The most powerful backpack-type power bank in the universe!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Fenmu Shen's expression changed. The greenery that flourished in the supreme world began to expand to the surroundings. The pressure of 10% of the world and the resentment of the army of the dead seemed to be naturally restrained.</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan and Leng Ming had a tacit understanding. Suddenly, the situation was reversed. It was beyond everyone's expectation.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen manifested a compass in his hand. He was filled with murderous intent. He gathered all his energy to resist the green energy that suddenly appeared in the supreme world.</p>

    <p>The two energies collided together and resounded loudly, just like the great sound of the great avenue sweeping through the whole world.</p>

    <p>A black-purple electric light streaked across the sky. The compass in Fenmu Shen's hand was transformed from the core of the supreme world. It was like the captain's rudder on a giant ship.</p>

    <p>He has never exerted 100% of the world's pressure. Therefore, he had to control the compass himself to make his power more stable.</p>

    <p>"No one can act arrogantly in my world..."</p>

    <p>He gritted his teeth, held the compass tightly, and tried to assume a superior posture. He tried his best to release his energy and stabilize the sudden change in the supreme world.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at this scene from a distance. Fenmu Shen felt particularly desolate at this moment.</p>

    <p>He is like those palace emperors in TV dramas who experienced coups with their own eyes but had no choice but to wear dragon robes and wave golden swords at a loss.</p>

    <p>"Get down here!"</p>

    <p>At this moment, Leng Ming shouted loudly.</p>

    <p>There was a kind of masculine perseverance in the voice that was slightly milky.</p>

    <p>Buzz! A sound!</p>

    <p>The green light rising into the sky is like a bonfire that illuminates the light. It dissolves this dark world.</p>

    <p>Puff!</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen vomited blood and fell to the ground. He tried hard to stabilize his body and did not want to kneel down.</p>

    <p>The core compass in his hand actually cracked and cracked under the pressure of Leng Ming and Wang Nuan!</p>

    <p>Who would have thought that a newborn baby and a sword spirit who had also just been born and had just undergone a few special trainings would actually be fighting an eternal living fossil standing at the top of the universe.</p>

    <p>Moreover, even though he was clearly in the opponent's supreme world, he still managed to suppress him!</p>

    <p>This made Fenmu Shen extremely surprised. This is obviously his supreme world... He is obviously the only god here. But two children would actually dominate him!</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Nuan was lying on Leng Ming's back, as if there was a posture between the sword master and the sword spirit. The man and the sword were one.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen changes color.</p>

    <p>This little girl is terrifyingly strong. Even if she is just born, her strength is unfathomable.</p>

    <p>Although she has never had combat experience, with her strong learning ability, this girl has also grown rapidly in combat.</p>

    <p>Like a battle-hardened veteran.</p>

    <p>He looked at Wang Nuan and Leng Ming in front of him and fell into a daze for a moment.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The earth of the highest world began to tremble. Powerful energy impacted the earth. Countless green rays of light were released from the cracks like fountains.</p>

    <p>The cracks in the core compass are even bigger!</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen is unbelievable.</p>

    <p>The supreme world he has worked so hard to build for so long is about to be lost!</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was completely stunned.</p>

    <p>Ah Nuan girl becomes even more powerful after having Leng Ming.</p>

    <p>He originally thought that Ah Nuan girl might need Wang Ling's help to kill this Fenmu Shen...</p>

    <p>But I didn't expect that this girl could do it alone.</p>

    <p>In a sense, he felt that Ah Nuan girl's strength when she was just born was actually higher than Wang Ling... But it was a pity. After all, she was born ten years later than Wang Ling Six years. This gap cannot be made up by Wang Nuan's strong growth ability.</p>

    <p>The growth potential of Wang Ling is also incredible. And it is getting more and more incredible...</p>

    <p>However, the reason why Wang Ming is watching this battle now is not to compare who is stronger or to simply join in the fun.</p>

    <p>Because of the research on the black stone, he felt that he should be able to find inspiration from the newly born Ah Nuan girl and look for subsequent ideas for cracking.</p>

    <p>At least that's what he thought at first...</p>

    <p>But now, while he was watching the battle, his mind was also blank.</p>

    <p>It fully proves the classic line "But I am uneducated. I can take the world with just one word."</p>

    <p>The little girl is so strong. It's so strong that Wang Ming can't believe it.</p>

    <p>He could actually predict that Wang Nuan was probably not a normal human being...but he didn't expect that this girl would overturn Fenmu Shen's table just after she was born. (╯‵□′)╯︵┻┻</p>

    <p>"You said I would split the world. I will split it open and show it to you!"</p>

    <p>At this time, Leng Ming's roar rang out again in the supreme world. His small body swallowed thousands of miles, shattering all the haze in this world.</p>

    <p>A bit of rice-like green sword light condensed from Leng Ming's fingertips like a seed.</p>

    <p>Then it slowly dripped down to Leng Ming's feet like dew. In an instant, the sword energy surged to the sky.</p>

    <p>The sword light from an invisible distance shot up from under his feet. At first it was only as high as grass. Then it quickly shot up! Standing tall against the sky and the ground! The brilliance caused Fenmu Shen to collapse!</p>

    <p>In an instant, the universe of the supreme world was illuminated.</p>

    <p>A subversion has officially begun.</p>

    <p>Leng Ming's sword energy was too strong, especially when Wang Nuan was lying on his back to transmit energy to him. It was like a backpack-type power bank charging his mobile phone.</p>

    <p>--The most powerful clip-on power bank in the universe!</p>

    <p>This makes the already astonishing sword energy even more terrifying.</p>

    <p>In an instant, sword energy spread across the supreme world. Hundreds of millions of divine lights tore through the sky. Every dark corner was illuminated.</p>

    <p>The undead army summoned by Fenmu Shen also stopped moving.</p>

    <p>They were struggling in pain and roaring as they approached Wang Nuan and Leng Ming. They moved forward with the momentum of thousands of troops and engulfed them. They wanted to tear Wang Nuan and Leng Ming into pieces.</p>

    <p>However, at this moment, a mysterious scene appeared.</p>

    <p>These undead souls transformed by the eternal strong men summoned by Fenmu Shen were all as motionless as if they were petrified at this moment.</p>

    <p>In this supreme world filled with Leng Ming's sword energy.</p>

    <p>One by one, they looked up at the green light in the sky, thoughtfully.</p>

    <p>After a few seconds, both Wang Nuan and Leng Ming noticed that the red fierce light in these people's eyes disappeared... as if they had been purified.</p>

    <p>This scene made Leng Ming hesitate. He did not take action. Instead, he stood there and watched this scene.</p>

    <p>He could feel that these eternal strong men who were forced to become undead were getting relief little by little from the pain accumulated in their hearts.</p>

    <p>He originally wanted to sweep these people away with his sword energy.</p>

    <p>But I never expected that these undead people actually retained the last trace of humanity...</p>

    <p>"Then just be detached." Leng Ming sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>He saw in front of him. Many dead souls turned into golden light particles under the breath of his sword. He realized that these poor people who were trapped by Fenmu Shen in this supreme world. After countless years, they had finally been reincarnated..</p>

    <p>This is a warm scene.</p>

    <p>However, at this moment, a loud voice came.</p>

    <p>"Kill!"</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen roared. He attacked his undead army: "You are all mine! I want you to die! You must die! You losers only deserve to eat dust. You are not worthy of reincarnation!"</p>

    <p>"Don't get in my way!"</p>

    <p>Leng Ming frowned. He looked really angry.</p>

    <p>He clenched his small fist and waved it towards Fenmu Shen from a distance.</p>

    <p>Boom! The green sword light turned into a fist. It rushed quickly from a distance and hit Fenmu Shen's body. He was instantly knocked away.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling watched this scene from a distance.</p>

    <p>From his perspective, it felt like he had picked out a tiny ant from a green ocean.</p>
