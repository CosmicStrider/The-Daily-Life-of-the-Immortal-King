  <h1>Chapter 1526 The Empress of the Palace</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The disguise plan was not planned at this time. But Sun Rong had to admit it.</p>

    <p>The moment she saw a group of girls surrounding Wang Ling, she couldn't help it.</p>

    <p>We originally agreed not to participate in the competition...now...it's no longer possible not to participate...</p>

    <p>Anyway, it's not my true identity.</p>

    <p>If you participate, nothing will happen, right?</p>

    <p>If we lose the game in the end, it won't be too embarrassing.</p>

    <p>Because the loser is Jiugong Liangzi. What does it have to do with her Sun Rong?</p>

    <p>Sun Rong thought so in his heart.</p>

    <p>She felt that this should be regarded as extra compensation paid to herself by Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>And in itself, there is such a clause in her verbal agreement with Jiugong Liangzi... If there is an emergency, she can act according to the situation without damaging Jiugong Liangzi's reputation.</p>

    <p>Then here comes the problem.</p>

    <p>In this closed-door competition, what kind of ranking should she achieve so as to not damage her reputation?</p>

    <p>Sun Rong feels that winning the semi-finals should be enough.</p>

    <p>At Jiugong Liangzi's level, it's not even Golden Core.</p>

    <p>Even reaching the quarterfinals may be difficult.</p>

    <p>Entering the semi-finals. That is an extraordinary performance!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong feels that Jiugong Liangzi should thank himself.</p>

    <p>When she saw Sun Rong, she went straight to kill her.</p>

    <p>In the monitoring room. Wang Ming, who immediately recognized Sun Rong, was also holding his forehead.</p>

    <p>He knew this would happen...</p>

    <p>So. What is this?</p>

    <p>The intimidation from the younger brother and sister-in-law, the "Main Palace Empress?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming smiled bitterly in his heart.</p>

    <p>He was thinking about how to explain what was happening to the confused Jisaki.</p>

    <p>As a result, Jisaki seemed to react after being stunned for a while: "Why do I feel that classmate Jiugong is a bit weird? He doesn't seem to be classmate Jiugong... In terms of temperament, he looks a bit like Rong Jiang."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming laughed out loud: "You are a sensible person. Classmate Jiucai."</p>

    <p>"My name is Jisaki! Only people who are familiar with me can call me Jiucai!" Jisaki frowned and seemed to mind.</p>

    <p>"Okay. Jisaki-san." Wang Ming spread his hands indifferently.</p>

    <p>He decided to tell Jisaki. It was actually after careful consideration.</p>

    <p>Because according to his judgment.</p>

    <p>Jisaki is a good person.</p>

    <p>It will not pose a substantial threat.</p>

    <p>And there is Jisaki, who is related to the Jiugong family and the Zhai Xing Group.</p>

    <p>The subsequent disguise plan may go more smoothly.</p>

    <p>"Why did Rong Jiang pretend to be Jiugong Liangzi's classmate?" At this time, Jisaki stared at the screen, frowning in confusion.</p>

    <p>It's a long story.</p>

    <p>Because it would take a long time to explain, Wang Ming decided to use brain waves to transmit directly to Jisaki.</p>

    <p>After understanding the whole story, the expression on Jisaki's face gradually changed from confusion to shock: "What! A clan fight within the Jiugong family?"</p>

    <p>"You shout louder. The whole world will hear it." Wang Ming said with a smile.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, he had already reached this point and used a magnetic shield to wrap up the central control room.</p>

    <p>At this time, Jisaki's face looked complicated and entangled.</p>

    <p>In fact, he never expected that Mr. "Wang Xiaoer" would tell him so many things...</p>

    <p>And he never thought that after marrying into the Jiugong family, his aunt Akano Hoshiki was actually trying to do something detrimental to the Jiugong family.</p>

    <p>"Sorry..." Jisaki took the initiative to bow to Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>"Why apologize?"</p>

    <p>"I just think that my aunt's behavior has caused you trouble."</p>

    <p>"No. Jiucai-san."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming smiled and said: "Maybe your aunt is not a bad person herself. She is just possessed by a ghost and lost her mind. Just like the vice president Ma Jiao next to you. They are just pawns of Akano Sekitora."</p>

    <p>What he called was Jiucai.</p>

    <p>Only this time. Jisaki didn't reject it.</p>

    <p>Because now Jisaki already knows the relationship between Wang Ming and Sun Rong. Extraordinary...</p>

    <p>Otherwise, it would be impossible to know so many things.</p>

    <p>And now, Jisaki also realizes it.</p>

    <p>This time I came to Sun Island. These people from Number 60 High School turned out to be carefully selected!</p>

    <p>"Why are you telling me this?" Jisaki asked at this time.</p>

    <p>"I just think you are a sensible person, Jiucai. Since Rongrong treats you as a friend, then I can't count you as an outsider. Besides, we don't have many friends on Sun Island." Wang Ming listened to this. It's an understatement. But it's actually touching the heart.</p>

    <p>Jisaki is actually a very emotional person.</p>

    <p>When he heard this, he was so moved that his nose hurt: "So, what is the relationship between you and Rong Jiang?"</p>

    <p>"She's my, Future relative."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said with a straight face, "Also my, Everlasting sister."</p>

    <p>"So that's it. That's great..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Jisaki breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming smiled: "You wouldn't think that the person Rongrong likes is me, right?"</p>

    <p>"Yes! After all, you know so much about Rong Jiang!"</p>

    <p>Jisaki laughed and cried: "I almost thought I misunderstood! I've heard it before. Rong Jiang likes a student named Wang. And you and your Houlang Sang both have Wang in common. So that's why... Hahahahaha!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming thinks that Jisaki's idea is quite good.</p>

    <p>"So. What do you need me to do?" Jisaki said.</p>

    <p>"You don't need to do anything extra. You just need to cooperate with us to confirm Rongrong's current false identity." Wang Ming said.</p>

    <p>"Understood." Jisaki nodded quickly.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the waiting room for the contestants. With the sudden appearance of Sun Rong disguised as Jiugong Liangzi. The looks on many people's faces were horified.</p>

    <p>And I don't know why. Especially the girls at the scene can feel a chill behind them.</p>

    <p>It was just a moment. The waiting room was completely silent.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong imitated the way Jiugong Liangzi walked. Step by step, he walked in the direction of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This black swan pace of disowning relatives is exactly the charm of Jiugong Liangzi. The essence of Sun Rong's performance.</p>

    <p>If Wang Ling hadn't known very clearly who the person in front of him was, he would have been deceived by the girl's superb acting skills.</p>

    <p>He actually felt it a long time ago.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong is actually talented in acting.</p>

    <p>And that face would definitely be very popular in the entertainment industry, right?</p>

    <p>In addition, the girl's previously pushy personality...the entertainment industry seems to be a testing ground specially customized for girls.</p>

    <p>It's just that Wang Ling doesn't know why.</p>

    <p>Recently Sun Rong has not only become much more low-key, but is also considered by him in everything.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Liangzi? How did you..." Several girls surrounding Wang Ling trembled.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong followed Jiugong Liangzi's example and walked over, that kind of disdainful eyes of a young lady, as if revealing a warning, looking at several people: "You several people, please stay away from Houlang Sang. Because ... he belongs to me, Jiugong Liangzi!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>After listening to Wang Ling, I was so scared that I dropped my phone.</p>
