  <h1>Chapter 1761 The clever Wang Muyu</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This punch was devastating. It seemed to have an ancient destructive power that cracked the earth under Zhou Ziyi's feet on the spot. The ground cracks were divided into pieces. The terrible cracks were centered on Wang Muyu's punch and stretched in all directions. Forming a complex and endless abyss...</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi was dumbfounded. At the moment when Wang Muyu punched, he was wrapped in the spiritual energy bubble that Wang Muyu had differentiated. Looking at the layers that were about to collapse after being hit by Wang Muyu's punch. The world. The whole person was also shocked beyond measure.</p>

    <p>"This..." He opened his mouth wide. This kind of power... is too strong. It is more than enough to prove Wang Muyu's identity as the son of Martial Saint.</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi even felt that this power was a little overflowing...</p>

    <p>And I don't know why. Zhou Ziyi seemed to be under Wang Muyu's punch. He vaguely heard the sound of crying after being beaten by a fat man.</p>

    <p>Wait a minute!</p>

    <p>Where does this crying sound come from?</p>

    <p>His mind was filled with question marks and doubts.</p>

    <p>Upon seeing this, Wang Muyu quickly cast a restoration spell. The layered space that he had messed up was restored to its original appearance in the blink of an eye.</p>

    <p>It wasn't until everything was back to normal that he touched his head in embarrassment: "Ah, I'm sorry... I didn't mean it. That punch just now probably made the spirit of the earth cry."</p>

    <p>"Earth Spirit..."</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi's throat couldn't help but roll.</p>

    <p>Under the leadership of Zhuo Yi these days, he has accepted a lot of knowledge that is beyond the thinking mode and world view of a normal cultivator. Naturally, he also knows that there is the existence of the spirit of the universe.</p>

    <p>Every time his master Wang Ling makes a move on the earth, the spirit of the earth will tremble. He is afraid that he will be punched through by his master if he is not careful, or that he will be slapped like a bowling ball and fly out of the solar system. </p>

    <p>As a spirit of the earth who is in a state of panic all day long, its mind is also extremely fragile. It is a spirit of the planet that is prone to crying.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu forgot. Although he cast the space layering technique, even if he caused further damage, it would not affect the real world. But the damage caused by the space dividing technique, according to the principle of the technique, would still be fed back to the spirit of the earth.</p>

    <p>The difference is.</p>

    <p>One is external injury. The other is internal injury...</p>

    <p>The punch he just punched was too violent. It left no force behind. The force of the punch directly penetrated the core of the earth.</p>

    <p>If he hadn't heard the cry of the spirit of the earth and immediately restored the situation in the layered space, the consequences would have been disastrous.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When the sobbing sound of the earth spirit came, Wang Ling happened to be sandwiched between Tengu and Martial Saint Jiang, looking at each other with fiery eyes and unable to move.</p>

    <p>Almost for that brief moment.</p>

    <p>He knew where the cries of the earth spirit came from.</p>

    <p>And to his great surprise, the originator of this cry, Wang Muyu had saved him in a sense.</p>

    <p>Therefore, at this time, Wang Ling's mood is very complicated, he thought that Wang Muyu to come here may give himself trouble, he did not think that instead Wang Muyu helped him.</p>

    <p>Of course. The most important thing is.</p>

    <p>He discovered that among the snacks in the small backpack that the little guy brought this time, there was actually dry noodles...</p>

    <p>This made Wang Ling's eyes suddenly light up.</p>

    <p>This... is basically a fellow-minded person!</p>

    <p>The cries of the Earth Spirit attracted the attention of Tengu and Martial Saint Jiang.</p>

    <p>Martial Saint Jiang frowned and looked away: "Strange. Why did I hear a faint cry? It seemed like a girl from some family had been domestically abused."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Unexpectedly, the third-grade Tengu in front of me heard the word "domestic violence." He actually had a sense of justice: "I'm going to check it out! No matter what happened, domestic violence is wrong!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Just like that. The entire topic surrounding Wang Ling was instantly deflected.</p>

    <p>Later Wang Ling heard that this mysterious cry coming from Duobao City was included in one of the top ten unsolved mysteries in the world of cultivation... until a long time later.</p>

    <p>No one could come up with a reasonable explanation. Seeing that the Duobao City Chengfen Gou group had fallen into a new mystery. Wang Ling also took the first step and quickly evacuated. Waiting for the Duobao City Chengfen Gou group to react. By the time, both of them had disappeared.</p>

    <p>This is an excellent opportunity to escape. Wang Ling cannot fail to seize it. But even if he is far away from the trouble of dividing the dog in Duobao City, Martial Saint Jiang's gaze behind Wang Ling is still burning.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling remember that the last ten generals who wanted to accept him as their disciples were General Yi. Immortal Toya happened to be nearby at the time. He directly used Immortal Toya as a shield.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, after nearly half a year, another one happened...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that the quality of cultivation among young people in the current world of cultivation is really problematic. There are so many cultivators in the world. How is it possible that we can't find anyone who is fundamentally new?</p>

    <p>As the saying goes, there is no harm without comparison. If it weren't for the fact that the spiritual quality of the young people around him was generally not up to standard, he wouldn't be so outstanding.</p>

    <p>After leaving the underground intelligence trading market, Martial Saint Jiang still followed him reluctantly.</p>

    <p>"This little brother, I won't force you to become my disciple. Tightened melons are not sweet. But I still hope you can consider it. After all, your bones are indeed very suitable for my {Holy Spirit Boxing} skill. If you can practice this boxing to the highest level in the future and open up a holy temple in your body..."</p>

    <p>Speaking of this, Martial Saint Jiang's eyes suddenly narrowed, showing a mysterious expression. Then he said softly: "You can defeat the enemy with one move. You can kill others with just one slap!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling heard this. He suppressed the twitching corners of his mouth.</p>

    <p>Kill others with one slap...</p>

    <p>These are all his old skills. Even if he doesn't learn this boxing, he can still do it.</p>

    <p>He didn't speak directly.</p>

    <p>Fortunately. At this time, the appearance of an acquaintance instantly made Wang Ling feel the light of hope.</p>

    <p>That person is none other than Zhou Ziyi.</p>

    <p>That is, his newly recognized disciple.</p>

    <p>Because Zhuo Yi has officially connected with Sun Rong, Jiang Yingying. They are dealing with the problem of Yin Hu and others. They cannot get away for the time being, so they sent Zhou Ziyi to help.</p>

    <p>Of course, besides Zhou Ziyi, there is another person... Wang Muyu who came with Zhou Ziyi.</p>

    <p>Although this little guy changed his appearance, his eyes were straightened when he saw him. He was afraid that Wang Muyu would not be able to help but change into his original appearance and rush towards him... If that was really the case, he was afraid. Even if you jump into the Yellow River, you won't be able to wash yourself away.</p>

    <p>But in fact, this little guy didn't do that. On the contrary, this little guy was very clever. He walked towards the direction of Wang Ling. Then he turned around and pounced with his transformed body. Falling into the arms of Martial Saint Jiang: "Daddy..."</p>

    <p>Martial Saint Jiang was immediately frightened when he heard the sound of "Daddy": "Young man, you can't talk nonsense! I'm not married yet... Where did the son come from..."</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu threw himself into Martial Saint Jiang's arms. He persisted: "Dad, do you still remember Tan Erniang...Tan Yuhe at the Second Immortal Bridge on Chenghua Avenue!"</p>

    <p>This cry immediately attracted the attention of many people around. Seeing more and more people gathered around, Martial Saint Jiang didn't dare to continue to follow Wang Ling. He just let go and ran away. There was an afterimage.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling suddenly discovered.</p>

    <p>This little guy...</p>

    <p>Seems to be quite good.</p>
