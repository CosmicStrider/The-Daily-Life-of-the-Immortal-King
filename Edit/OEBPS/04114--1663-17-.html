  <h1>Chapter 1663 That man's 17 years old</h1>

  <div>

    

    <p>Tomorrow is his birthday. Wang Ling In fact, he has never had much expectations for his birthday. Because there have been so many birthdays in the past years, he has long passed the age of looking forward to birthdays.</p>

    <p>Every year on my birthday, I tell Wang Ling that I have grown one year older. And I have become a billion points stronger.</p>

    <p>For Wang Ling himself, before finding a sure way to completely control combat power, every birthday is nothing more than a reminder that God has stuffed a spoon full of gunpowder into his body...</p>

    <p>Nowadays, people of the same age are looking forward to their birthdays. But Wang Ling hopes that time can go slower.</p>

    <p>Ever since Wang Ling turned seven, he has never had a birthday party in his memory.</p>

    <p>Because it's hard to imagine that he can even blow out a candle and blow out the fire ball technique of Fire Release, and directly burn down the house...</p>

    <p>So this year's birthday gift is the same as in previous years. With Wang Ling's permission, Father Wang and Mother Wang still give Wang Ling the option to cash it out and let him buy what he likes.</p>

    <p>Seventeen years old.</p>

    <p>This year's birthday gift cash red envelopes seem to be more generous than in previous years.</p>

    <p>Father Wang was surprisingly not stingy. The couple stuffed 17,000 yuan into it.</p>

    <p>This is a huge sum of money for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>When opening the red envelope, Wang Ling received the couple's full heartfelt wishes. Each bright red banknote was written in beautiful pencil calligraphy: "Happy birthday, son."</p>

    <p>These one hundred and seventy banknotes. Father Wang was tinkering with them in the study for a long time last night.</p>

    <p>He wrote a lot of blessings online. After sorting out his thoughts, he planned to transcribe them bit by bit on paper money.</p>

    <p>Later, he discovered that there were too many blessing words. It seemed that he could not fully express his feelings with these one hundred and seventy banknotes.</p>

    <p>So, after a thousand words, only one sentence of "Happy Birthday" was left.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling has no intention of spending all this money.</p>

    <p>The main reason is that I can't think of what I want to buy. But the snacks from the canteen that I really want to buy are so cheap that I don't need that much money.</p>

    <p>After collecting the money, Wang Ling plans to go to the bank. First, he will deposit this huge amount of money into his own account.</p>

    <p>Just when he was about to teleport away, Ah Nuan girl crawled over and pulled his trousers out of nowhere.</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling discovered it recently. He discovered that the little girl likes to cling to him.</p>

    <p>And he is not a person who likes to be clung to by others.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if it's because of the blood relationship. He doesn't have the slightest objection to Ah Nuan's stickiness.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at Wang Nuan: "Want to go together?"</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan said "Yeah!"</p>

    <p>So, he half-crouched down and picked up Ah Nuan girl. The whole set of movements was so smooth and natural that there was no trace of anything wrong.</p>

    <p>In fact, this is also the result of Wang Ling practicing many times with Er Ha in private. Mainly because he was afraid that his hug would be too stiff and make his sister uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>Seeing Wang Ling hugging herself. Ah Nuan girl also became happy. Her fleshy body was stretched on Wang Ling's shoulder. It was like a little fat bird perched on the shoulder. She just likes to stay in her brother's position.</p>

    <p>The whole scene is so warm that it's incredible. If anyone else were watching here, they would definitely feel it was unreal.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling never showed any expression from beginning to end. But with such gentle actions and the cautious way he treated his sister, there is always a feeling of sadness when traveling with Wang Ling, the "role model of our generation." Unreal feeling.</p>

    <p>After depositing the money, I came out. The whole incident took less than half an hour.</p>

    <p>The specific time-consuming is as follows.</p>

    <p>Use "Great Teleportation" to move to the nearest bank.</p>

    <p>The whole process took less than 1 second.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling found that all the ATM deposit machines were under maintenance, so he took the initiative to get an account and wait for manual processing.</p>

    <p>Due to the large number of people on Saturday.</p>

    <p>Then I waited in line for a full 27 minutes before I called him.</p>

    <p>Then came the manual deposit process. It took more than 2 minutes...</p>

    <p>But thanks to the time spent queuing up, Wang Ling also sorted out his thoughts on what gifts he wanted this year.</p>

    <p>He thought that the other-world version of limited-flavor crispy noodles in the Virtual Realm looked pretty good.</p>

    <p>All you have to do is buy those crispy noodles. Currency in the real world cannot be used universally.</p>

    <p>But in fact, Wang Ling also has some savings of his own in that world.</p>

    <p>Because not long after Lord Diulei realized that there was a "Virtual Realm." in the Arctic. Wang Ling actually noticed the existence of that place...</p>

    <p>Because there are other world versions of limited-flavor crispy noodles. And these crispy noodles are sold in limited quantities every year.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling actually held back from uprooting this strange otherworld.</p>

    <p>Of course, he actually knew exactly what this group of people was planning...</p>

    <p>Whether it's Old Ancient Divine Weapons or New Ancient Divine Weapons.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thinks. If someone really thinks that they can rule the universe with these scraps of metal, it would be a bit too fanciful.</p>

    <p>The fact is that no ancient magic weapon, whether new or old, can withstand the power of his punch...</p><p>...</p>

    

    <p>Today, just in time for his birthday, also happens to be the day when this limited edition gear noodles from another world are released.</p>

    <p>It is said that as long as you draw crispy noodles with a golden gear card in the package, you can get a free pack of neon rainbow crispy noodles.</p>

    <p>In terms of taste, Wang Ling doesn't know how good it is compared to other crispy noodles. But he still knows a little bit about the effect.</p>

    <p>It is said that as long as you eat "Neon Rainbow Crispy Noodles" and go to the toilet in the next few days, the things in the toilet will also turn into a beautiful rainbow color. And it can last for a full seven days...</p>

    <p>Limited edition dry noodles. Sometimes they are not necessarily sold in terms of taste. They may also use "novelty" as a selling point.</p>

    <p>When ordinary crispy noodles can no longer meet the needs of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>These unique crispy noodles can really bring Wang Ling different feelings.</p>

    <p>Give him a sense of satisfaction.</p>

    <p>Of course...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling enters the Virtual Realm. There is also a cover-up of identity.</p>
    
    <p>His name in this Virtual Realm is a single name, which is the word "Jin" with the word "Ling" removed<sup>1</sup>.</p>

    <dfn><sup>1</sup>("Jin" is "今," while "Ling" is "令.")</dfn>

    <p>For all the big and small bosses who run game arcades in the core area, this name is an absolute nightmare.</p>

    <p>Because the game arcade is the main source of income for Wang Ling to earn currency in this world.</p>

    <p>As for Ah Nuan, as long as Ah Nuan is in the shadow state, he can always lie on his shoulder and will not be discovered by outsiders.</p>

    <p>So. When Wang Ling put on the white fox mask prepared in advance and swaggered into a game arcade in the Imperial City, almost in an instant, the game arcade entered the first level alert mode.</p>

    <p>"It's Jin! Jin God appears again..."</p>

    <p>"Is he going to smash the boxing machine again today?"</p>

    <p>The person in charge of the game hall saw the familiar figure enter from the control room. The whole team was in a cold sweat. He stared at Wang Ling's figure. Immediately, he ordered his men: "Go get someone to stall him. Then inform Mr. Jia immediately. Ask him if he has any ideas..."</p>

    <p>"Didn't the boss go to that underground boxing ring?"</p>

    <p>"Back early...now at the astrology club next door!"</p>

  <p>"OK! I'll ask right away!"</p></div>
