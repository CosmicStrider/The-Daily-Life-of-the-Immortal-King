  <h1>Chapter 1875 Are all the 60 High School people descended from the Eternal One?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Chen Ren's danger now doesn't even require Wang Ling to speak. Emperor Dongda can feel it.</p>

    <p>It turns out that there really are people like this in this world who can tell the truth of things unintentionally. The key is that they don't have much awareness of what they say.</p>

    <p>This is too scary. In a sense, such talent has even surpassed that of the royal family. It is amazing.</p>

    <p>It doesn't rely on the power of blood at all. It's just crushing by one-sided talent.</p>

    <p>And speaking of bloodline, this is what makes Emperor Dongda the most miraculous.</p>

    <p>"Senior Wang... these two people, especially this one named Chen Ren. Do you know their descendants?" Dongda asked weakly in the team voice skills.</p>

    <p>"It is true that there are two descendants who are very similar to them. And they even have the same surname. But it is still unclear whether the two people I know are their descendants." After a moment of silence, Wang Ying finally answered truthfully.</p>

    <p>This made Emperor Dongda even more surprised. He was shocked in his heart.</p>

    <p>The two people in front of me are not even of royal blood. At most, they are just nobles in a domain. They are the kind of rich people who have no worries about food and clothing. However, their cultivation talents are not as good as those of the royal family.</p>

    <p>If Guo Jie and Chen Ren are really the ancestors of Guo Hao and Chen Chao, then it can be said that the fortunes of these two families are simply heaven-defying!</p>

    <p>They are obviously not an eternal person with royal bloodline, but they can leave their descendants to span eternity until the modern world of cultivation. This is what kind of terrible luck for the family. Not even many royal families have it.</p>

    <p>You must know that Dao Ancestor Wang later went crazy and imprisoned all the Eternal Ones. The emperor, the royal family, the casual cultivators among the Eternal Ones, and the people did not spare any of them. They were all included in the same world in the picture.</p>

    <p>As for the remaining people who can survive, there are probably only a few tenths of a percent of them. And people of royal blood must be easier to escape from the clutches of the devil. Because if they are strong enough, they may have the ability to hide things from the outside world...</p>

    <p>And on the premise that they are neither members of the royal family nor have enough hard power, there are really very few ordinary people who can just escape openly.</p>

    <p>This escape probability Wang Ling seems to be no different from winning the lottery.</p>

    <p>All in all, this trip to the temple was a surprise for Wang Ling. It can also be said to be a shock.</p>

    <p>This feeling of meeting an old friend in a foreign land makes Wang Ling feel amazing.</p>

    <p>So here comes the question. Now that the suspected ancestors of Chen Chao and Guo Hao have appeared, will he also meet himself from the eternal period...</p>

    <p>Originally, they came to the temple to wait for an appointment with Mrs. Shanxiu. Wang Ling did not expect that Mrs. Shanxiu did not wait. Instead, some strange plots were triggered.</p>

    <p>"Brother, I think you look familiar. Do you want to leave a spiritual seal for each other?" At this time, Guo Jie, who was already familiar with each other, asked.</p>

    <p>He took out a piece of jade with an expectant look on his face.</p>

    <p>The Eternal World does not have such modern equipment, let alone the Internet. The communication between cultivators still adopt relatively primitive methods, such as leaving spiritual imprints and the like.</p>

    <p>Each cultivator has his or her own special spiritual energy. Therefore, as long as they leave spiritual energy imprints, they can communicate directly through jade if they contact each other in the future. It is equivalent to adding a contact.</p>

    <p>"Of course it's possible." Dongda smiled and directly took out his jade stone.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui was shocked.</p>

    <p>This is not an ordinary spiritual engraving. Since it was given by the Great Emperor, it is naturally the Great Emperor's engraving!</p>

    <p>There were so many things that many people dreamed of. Emperor Dongda actually gave it to them so easily.</p>

    <p>Now Wang Ling can finally understand it. This Dongda is a master who likes to cause trouble and does not take it too seriously.</p>

    <p>After Guo Jie's exchange, Chen Ren next to him also exchanged engravings. In this way, for Guo Jie and Chen Ren, they had made a new friend.</p>

    <p>Although they don't know the true origin of this friend so far, they just have a vague feeling that he is a royal family from the Eastern Region.</p>

    <p>"It's our first time to meet. I'm so embarrassed to ask for the spiritual seal so shamelessly. Let's do this. How about the two of us treat you to a meal, senior?" At this time, Guo Hao glanced at Chen Ren. The two of them looked at each other. After looking at him and smiling, he said to Emperor Dong.</p>

    <p>"I'm afraid that won't work. I'm waiting for someone. He wants to talk to me about something." Emperor Dongda replied.</p>

    <p>"Who is it?" Guo Hao was curious.</p>

    <p>"Mei Yunhai. Madam Shanxiu's true disciple. Madam Shanxiu will also come here in the future." Emperor Dongda said.</p>

    <p>"Oh! It's them!"</p>

    <p>To Emperor Dong's surprise, Guo Jie's network of contacts was wider than he imagined. He even knew Mei Yunhai and Mrs. Shanxiu.</p>

    <p>"You know them?"</p>

    <p>"More than that. Very familiar!"</p>

    <p>Guo Jie said: "Mei Yunhai and I went through the secret realm together before. We knew each other at that time. Of course, it was mainly him who led me through. And I provided support with spirit beasts along the way. Various spirit beasts for transportation. Spirits to assist in the attack. Beasts. As well as food reserve beasts and the like."</p>

    <p>Reserve food spirit beast...</p>

    <p>Everyone was ashamed when they heard this.</p>

    <p>So this is... He was so hungry that he directly ate spiritual beasts as meat?</p>

    <p>It's too cruel!</p>

    <p>Guo Jie put his hands on his hips and said with a calculating expression: "And let me tell you, I even know why Mei Yunhai is looking for you."</p>

    <p>"Shouldn't it be Mrs. Shanxiu who is looking for me? Why is it Mei Yunhai?" Emperor Dongda asked.</p>

    <p>"Mrs. Shanxiu is just here to take charge. I'm afraid you won't agree, senior." Guo Jie replied, "Senior, you should know. Mei Yunhai is the only true disciple of Mrs. Shanxiu. But in fact, Mei Yunhai still has a sister who is not a biological sister. She and Mei Yunhai ran for Madam Shanxiu's true disciple. Unfortunately, she was not selected by Madam Shanxiu."</p>

    <p>"Why are you talking to my master about this?" Zhang Zhui asked, raising an eyebrow.</p>

    <p>"I know that senior has extraordinary skills. And he is a royal family of the Eastern Region. So since he is a royal family of the Eastern Region, there must be a connection with the Eastern Emperor." Guo Jie said: "Senior, can't you tell? In fact, the main purpose of Mrs. Xiu's search for you is...to send Mei Yunhai's sister to the Imperial Palace in the Eastern Region to practice."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "???"</p>

    <p>Hearing these words, Wang Ling suddenly felt a little cheated.</p>

    <p>We agreed to talk about the secrets about the "Book of Nine Realms." Why are we suddenly looking for a partner for Emperor Dongda's harem?</p>

    <p>"This woman..."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui's lips trembled. He was about to scream.</p>

    <p>As a result, there was a commotion in the temple.</p>

    <p>Several familiar figures appeared at the door, and because of their astonishing popularity in the eternal world, they attracted the attention of the surrounding onlookers.</p>

    <p>It was Mrs. Shanxiu who came. She also brought her true disciple Mei Yunhai and a young girl who looked down and out.</p>

    <p>She wore a long aqua dress with a white silk gauze cover. The pearl belt around her waist was particularly eye-catching. Her black and smooth hair fell down to her waist. She had bright eyebrows and starry eyes. Her snow-white skin was stunning.</p>

    <p>The girl's steps are light and full of confidence. It gives Wang Ling a very familiar feeling.</p>

    <p>Then she walked up to Emperor Dongda in just a few steps. Before Mrs. Shanxiu could introduce herself to Mei Yunhai, she arched her eyebrows and introduced herself with a smile: "Hello, senior. My name is Sun Fu. I am Mei Yunhai's adopted sister. Immortal inner disciple of the Shan Sect!"</p>

    <p>When this sweet voice sounded in his ears.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was dumbfounded. Sun Rong was also stunned.</p>
