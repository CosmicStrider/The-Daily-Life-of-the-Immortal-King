  <h1>Chapter 2156 Undercover Plan</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: The Four Elephants have been doing a lot of evil and most of the fugitives are fleeing overseas. It is very difficult to capture them.</p>

    <p>After all, they are the disciples brought out by Xie Jian Shen. Xie Jian Shen knows them all. According to Xie Jian Shen's confession, Qingjiao, Xuehu, Zhu Xi, Xiongwu. The four of them have a strong sense of counter-investigation. Want to It's not that easy to track them down.</p>

    <p>Especially since the capture of Xie Jian Shen. According to the research of the overseas criminal pursuit team at the Xiuzhen Police Station, the pursuit team is sure that they have never come back.</p>

    <p>The capture of Xie Jian Shen is a warning to them. But just because he hasn't come back at this stage doesn't mean he won't find an opportunity to come back in the future.</p>

    <p>The Xiuzhen Police Station has been worried that maybe the Four Elephants are planning some big plan. For example, they could rescue the evil Jian Shen after a prison robbery.</p>

    <p>This is what the Xiuzhen Police Station is most worried about. Prison robberies are nothing. They are just afraid that the people who rob the prison are all lunatics. And they are lunatics with a plan.</p>

    <p>If they really decide to set out to rescue the evil Jian Shen, then the pressure on the Xiuzhen Police Station will be even greater.</p>

    <p>Therefore, instead of feeling anxious all the time, it is better to take action early and capture several people together.</p>

    <p>For this reason, the Xiuzhen Police Station had already contacted Huaxiu Alliance for assistance. Huaxiu Alliance also took the initiative to find the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>So now Zhuo Yi has entered the game as a GM. Cooperating with Qin Zhong, Xiang Yi teamed up to lock the specific IP coordinates of these four people.</p>

    <p>Even a few people entering the game to assist in the development of Wang Ling, Sun Rong are secondary tasks. The current main task is to locate the real IP coordinates of several people.</p>

    <p>After the capture is completed, the task of assisting the development of Wang Ling, Sun Rong will naturally become the next main task.</p>

    <p>You would never imagine how cautious a group of extremely vicious criminals could be at this juncture.</p>

    <p>"Why does it need to be so complicated? Didn't it say that the Itinerant Immortal game cabin has a crime monitoring system?"</p>

    <p>Li Ziye said in confusion: "Once a criminal is found playing this game, he can directly block the game cabin and release crispy gas. When the criminal thinks he is playing the game, he can directly launch the game cabin in place and teleport it to the designated location. Location."</p>

    <p>"But these are things that would happen in an ideal world, aren't they?"</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong raised his eyebrows and said: "This group of people faced such a long pursuit by the Cultivation Police Department. From the overseas pursuit team to the help of the International Cultivation Criminal Police. There has been no news for so many years. This proves that they are more thoughtful than us. You need to be too cautious."</p>

    <p>Xiang Yi touched his chin and nodded slightly: "Brother Qin is right. If it were me, I would not enter the game cabin by myself. Instead, I would first place a dummy in the game cabin, and then use other magic methods to make the dummy A neural connection is created between the person and the body. In this way, even outside the game cabin, the game can still be played normally. The key is that it will no longer be controlled by the game cabin."</p>

    <p>"Then these people have worked hard just to be able to play the game..."</p>

    <p>After listening to this, Li Ziye was completely shocked.</p>

    <p>In order to play a game, you need to make a fake ID card, make a fake stand-in, and establish a neural link... This is not something that ordinary monks can do with enough time, right?</p>

    <p>"Okay. I promise you. But let's make a deal first. I'm doing this purely as a friendly favor. It's out of the basic concept of a good citizen." Li Ziye said reluctantly.</p>

    <p>Although he is basically in a state of "doing no evil" in the game, he can return to his human nature and is not bad either.</p>

    <p>Just like Li Ziye said. This is just a game after all.</p>

    <p>So sometimes you really don't have to worry too much.</p>

    <p>"If the capture goes well, you will get a banner and a commendation order from Huaxiu Alliance." Qin Zhong said.</p>

    <p>"Really!?" Li Ziye was moved.</p>

    <p>This is something you can use to brag for the rest of your life!</p>

    <p>Huaxiu Alliance's Commendation Order!</p>

    <p>There is no need to say more about the gold content of this thing!</p>

    <p>"Don't worry. I will definitely introduce you two!" At this time, Li Ziye blew through his nose and patted his chest suddenly.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, after returning to the Four Elephants Guild, Xiong Wu has been in a very low mood.</p>

    <p>Many guild members kept silent. They knew the character of their guild leader. He had always been a very strong person. This time he was disgraced in Fuyun Town.</p>

    <p>I also knew that Xiong Wu would get this place back no matter what.</p>

    <p>Real world. In the conference room. Qingjiao, Xuehu, Zhu Xi, and Xiongwu are having a meeting.</p>

    <p>They removed the neuron data line interface with the dummy in the game cabin and conducted private meetings directly in the real world.</p>

    <p>The main content of today's meeting: How to take revenge on Fuyun Town.</p>

    <p>A slender young man with a whip made a cold voice: "Brother, you know me. I always believe that revenge should be reported on the spot. And I doubt that the city lord is definitely not an NPC. His words and deeds There is a high probability that he is a Zhenren player."</p>

    <p>After saying that, Xiong Wu looked at Xue Hu again.</p>

    <p>I saw Xuehu straightening his powerful body and saying: "Brother, you know me. What I have always pursued is to pick weak persimmons. Since those people all want to go to Fuyun Town, and Fuyun Town has those I don't know if the NPC city lord is protecting me. We might as well set up checkpoints around Fuyun Town and intercept and kill all the players who want to go to Fuyun Town!"</p>

    <p>Then, Xiongwu looked at Zhu Xi again.</p>

    <p>Zhu?'s voice was long and thin, with the feeling of a smile hiding a knife: "Brother, you know me. In fact, I have the same opinion as Qingjiao. That person's blood is too thick. From a game perspective, we won't be able to find him in the short term. If this person is Zhenren, it will be much easier for us."</p>

    <p>"Go on. www.uukanshu.net "</p>

    <p>Xiong Wu showed an interesting expression.</p>

    <p>Zhu? sighed and said: "Brother, my method is still very simple. Since we can't deal with the people in the game, let's deal with the people outside the game. If he is Zhenren, then we can deal with him directly." Qingjiao has resources in this area. If we assume that this person is real, maybe we can directly find the coordinates of this person. Then we can ask Qingjiao to hack into the system."</p>

    <p>"But wouldn't this be too risky?" Xiongwu frowned.</p>

    <p>Zhu? waved his hand and said with a smile: "When did the elder brother become so timid? If the elder brother is really worried, I can use my sword energy to track it remotely. As long as it is touched by my sword energy, no matter what the object is. will become explosive objects!"</p>

    <p>"It's better to be cautious first. And we must be prepared for everything."</p>

    <p>Xiongwu slapped the table: "Do it! Find this person! Kill him!"</p>
