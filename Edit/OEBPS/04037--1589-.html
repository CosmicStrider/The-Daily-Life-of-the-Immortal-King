  <h1>Chapter 1589 Prop Rewards</h1>

  <div>

    <p>As the mental evaluation value of Wang Ling appeared, the entire dry forest burned instantly in a sea of golden fire. The owner of the dead forest died miserably.</p>

    <p>He confidently entered into this bet with Wang Ling. He did not expect such a result until the moment before his death.</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling did not expect that the rules and regulations within the Palace of the Outer Gods were actually relatively fair.</p>

    <p>After the old man lost, he was directly punished by the law. There was no room for negotiation.</p>

    <p>This is the age of the ancient universe. Is this the confidence of the outer gods?</p>

    <p>Don't even spare your own people.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling couldn't help but let out a helpless sigh.</p>

    <p>For the powerful alien gods, this is really just a game.</p>

    <p>In the chess game, any chess piece can be discarded.</p>

    <p>But this is someone else's territory after all. The rules of the game are ultimately decided by others.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling just hope that since these are the rules of the game, you should abide by them.</p>

    <p>He can afford this game.</p>

    <p>But some people may not be able to afford it.</p>

    <p>This dead forest disappeared in the golden flames. But not nothing was left.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling found a six-sided golden Rubik's Cube.</p>

    <p>Three sides are blank. Two sides are 1 point. One side is 3 points.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Judgment. This should be an additional item reward obtained after passing the level of the dead forest.</p>

    <p>And when he focused his attention on the golden Rubik's Cube, a string of golden explanatory text immediately appeared on the top of the Rubik's Cube.</p>

    <p>[golden magic block]</p>

    <p>[It can be used before making any basic ability judgment of "Strength, Sanity, Knowledge, Speed, and Blood." The number of points thrown is the multiple of the basic ability judgment. If it is blank, the judgment result is: 0. The golden magic block only Can be used once. The magic block will disappear automatically after use.]</p>

    <p>Wang Ling accept this magic block.</p>

    <p>Although he didn't know what use this reward was to him.</p>

    <p>He is already +∞. Even if it is several times higher, it doesn't seem to be bad.</p>

    <p>On the contrary, holding this thing in his hand is a double-edged sword for Wang Ling. After all, there is a blank. If it is thrown to the blank, it will be very dangerous for him.</p>

    <p>He is an honest boy.</p>

    <p>I still want to play the game according to the rules.</p>

    <p>If you can't afford it, just lift the table...</p>

    <p>Is he Wang Ling this kind of person?</p>

    <p>After solving the incident in the dead forest, in front of Wang Ling were three more doors covered in golden light.</p>

    <p>He didn't hesitate. He directly chose the door in the middle.</p>

    <p>The new small world that appeared in front of us was a large swamp. The patches of purple reeds were tens of feet high, covering all the scenery.</p>

    <p>Such a scene is full of wildness and primitiveness. It is also terrifyingly quiet.</p>

    <p>Based on Wang Ling's own experience. There must be living beings in the depths of this large swamp. Wang Ling formed a seal with one hand. Several sentinels with their own aura were differentiated to test in all directions.</p>

    <p>When these sentinels passed through the middle area of the small world, a strange wave appeared there. They bit directly towards his sentinels.</p>

    <p>"ah..."</p>

    <p>A scream came. It was so fast that people were surprised.</p>

    <p>However, this scream was not the scream of the sentry released by Wang Ling. It was the scream of the creature lurking under the swamp.</p>

    <p>The creature originally wanted to pounce on the sentry and bite it into pieces. But it didn't expect that the sentry was too hard! Its steel teeth were severely damaged!</p>

    <p>And then. Wang Ling and Wang Nuan sensed the spirit's furious aura from afar...</p>

    <p>In this swamp, no one has ever dared to tease him like this.</p>

    <p>Then, the swamp in this small world began to bubble and emit a foul-smelling smoke. It boiled with the angry breath of the swamp creatures.</p>

    <p>The next moment, a black glow emerged from the ground. It sneaked up from Wang Ling's back at a mysterious angle.</p>

    <p>"Chi!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling The six senses were bright. He didn't even look back. He just raised his sword and waved back. In an instant, the sparks flying around were offset by the light emitted by the swamp creature.</p>

    <p>The test of this attack has allowed Wang Ling to find out the approximate strength of this swamp creature.</p>

    <p>The opponent's overall combat power is not strong. But the strange thing is that it is extremely fast.</p>

    <p>In this swamp world, this creature has the ability to move to any direction at will. Move sideways quickly, and then launch a new offensive under the overlapping stinking mud.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Tiptoe gently. Float your body. Fly into the void.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the King's Eyes rotated. The eternal flame released from the King's Eyes completely submerged the reeds that were blocking the sight under the feet and burned them completely.</p>

    <p>After losing the cover of the reeds, the trajectory of this creature's activities can be seen clearly.</p>

    <p>It seemed that he realized that he had been exposed. This mysterious creature hiding under the swamp finally revealed its true form.</p>

    <p>It is dark and round, with a diameter of three meters. It has hair and tentacles, and it is actually an eyeball.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling At a glance, he knew that this eyeball was probably one of the Old Dominators. It was of the same race as the End Hunter that he had dealt with outside before. But it seemed to be a little different.</p>

    <p>At this time, the eyeball shot towards Wang Ling. The pupils shrank slightly and then opened! Then a black light shot towards Wang Ling with a terrifying killing intent!</p>

    <p>This was an extremely blazing pillar of fire. It gave Wang Ling the feeling of seeing Angelica.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling wanted to block it. However, Ah Nuan girl took the first step at this time.</p>

    <p>This little girl looked like she was really hungry. She couldn't let go of anything. She opened her mouth on the spot and used the power of shadow to swallow up all the black flames in front of her.</p>

    <p>The eyeball was obviously shocked. It had lived for so long. It had never seen such an arrogant baby.</p>

    <p>He gritted his teeth and said with an angry look: "What a pity. I am not in my prime. I only have a few scattered organs left. If it were a complete body, you two dolls would definitely die."</p>

    <p>The voice of the eyeball sounded in the minds of Wang Ling and Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>After saying that, the eyeball turned its own eyeball slightly. Wang Ling was shocked to find that this eyeball actually had a mark that was the same as the one on the outside of the Palace of the Outer Gods.</p>

    <p>Is it the eyeball from an alien god?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was thoughtful in his heart.</p>

    <p>At the same time, this eyeball also felt bitter in his heart.</p>

    <p>It had its heyday. It was indeed a powerful alien god.</p>

    <p>Need to know. In Old Dominator, the Outer Gods are the most powerful race.</p>

    <p>When Fenmu Shen outside finally completes her transformation, she becomes the Outer God.</p>

    <p>But it's a pity. In the long history, Eyeball was obsessed with betting with people... As one of the few gambling dogs in the Outer God queue, he lost his left arm, right arm, and left leg. , middle leg...</p>

    <p>Until now, only some of the organs and eyeballs are left.</p>

    <p>However, when it comes to betting, my eyes are still obsessed with it.</p>

    <p>This brother and sister are able to come here. In terms of power. Eyeball doesn't think he's going to get an advantage.</p>

    <p>Just now. It has been tested.</p>

    <p>So now. This eyeball has officially sent an appraisal invitation to Wang Ling: "How about... do you want to bet on speed with me? I want to conduct a speed appraisal with you!"</p>

    <p>He has extreme confidence in his speed and eyeballs.</p>

    <p>Because according to the appraisal rules of the Palace of Outer Gods, its speed is +∞!</p>

    <p>As long as Wang Ling dares to bet with it.</p>

    <p>Certain death!</p>
