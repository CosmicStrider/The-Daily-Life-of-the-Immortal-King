  <h1>Chapter 1870 Soul exchange across eternity</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Generally, futons in the world of cultivation are sharp tools used during meditation, retreat, or preaching.</p>

    <p>A comfortable futon can allow cultivators to quickly enter a state of selflessness. They can become addicted to cultivation and cannot extricate themselves.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has such a futon in King's Pants. It is called "Lingling Futon." The efficiency of meditating on it for one day is comparable to the speed of a normal cultivator's fifty years of retreat.</p>

    <p>But for Wang Ling, this futon seems a bit tasteless.</p>

    <p>After all, he gains experience every day when he sleeps.</p>

    <p>He can no longer restrain myself. If he continue to speed up his practice, it will be like committing suicide.</p>

    <p>The futon in front of him is displayed according to the results of Wang Ling's "Pupillary Power Assessment."</p>

    <p>It is indeed much better than an ordinary futon.</p>

    <p>Meditating on it for a day is comparable to six months of solitary practice.</p>

    <p>Even though it's not as strong as Wang Ling's, at least the effect is genuine.</p>

    <p>Of course. Wang Ling also knows clearly in his heart that what this Babel Futon sells is not its own cultivation value.</p>

    <p>The focus is not on the futon itself. It's on the owner of the futon.</p>

    <p>As the founder of Heavenly Dao. The number one powerhouse in the world of eternal cultivation. Dao Ancestor Wang's name is above the Four Emperors.</p>

    <p>That is an existence that everyone worships and respects.</p>

    <p>At least before Dao Ancestor Wang locked the Eternal Ones into the Corpse Map. Dao Ancestor Wang's reputation in the Eternal Cultivation World is also well-known.</p>

    <p>Even the emperor's palace has a dedicated ancestral hall dedicated to Dao Ancestor Wang. Every day, people offer incense and worship him as if he were a god.</p>

    <p>It can be said that most cultivators throughout the ages are followers of Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>Or to put it in more straightforward terms in the modern world of cultivation. It can also be called: fans.</p>

    <p>But what Wang Ling didn't expect was that the fan economy, which has developed into a certain scale these days, has been popular for eternity.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, everything in the world is a circle.</p>

    <p>You think you are playing some new tricks. But in fact, it may be leftovers from the ancestors.</p>

    <p>To be honest, if it weren't for the following diary content, this futon was not the possession of Emperor Dongdai.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thinks he might buy this futon.</p>

    <p>He is not a fan of Dao Ancestor Wang. But he is interested in this person.</p>

    <p>Even in the layout of this eternal time travel, Dongda claimed that it was not like Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling still thinks this is the number one suspect.</p>

    <p>"Is this really what Dao Ancestor Wang got?"</p>

    <p>When Liu Renwen introduced the information about futons, many people here became excited.</p>

    <p>"It is indeed Dao Ancestor Wang's thing."</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong, who plays Liu Renwen, said: "According to the results of the identification data, there is a life-size statue of Dao Ancestor Wang in Wanling Mountain on Zhongzhou. In fact, it is the mortal body left by Dao Ancestor Wang after he ascended to Immortal a long time ago." After being petrified, it is then made by skilled craftsmen based on the petrified refinement."</p>

    <p>"In order to identify whether the futon belongs to Dao Ancestor Wang, our auctioneer made a special trip to Wanling Mountain. Based on this life-size stone statue, he made a mold of Dao Ancestor Wang's buttocks."</p>

    <p>"Finally, a strict comparison with the intaglio print on the futon confirmed that this futon is indeed the property of Dao Ancestor Wang."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Everyone was silent.</p>

    <p>It is said that the appraisers of the Central Auction House are notoriously hard-working in order to identify the authenticity of treasures. But they didn't expect that they would be so crazy...</p>

    <p>Buttocks molding. Why does this sound dirty?</p>

    <p>It's so sinful!</p>

    <p>Before coming to eternity. Wang Ling, Sun Rong, and the others including Wang Zhen thought that the cultivators in the eternity period were a group of old stubborns who refused to change.</p>

    <p>They never expected that these former seniors in the world of cultivation would actually be better at playing than each other.</p>

    <p>It actually gave them a lot of experience.</p>

    <p>"The base price of this Babel futon is 5 million mixed spirit stones. Each increase in price must not be less than 500,000. Now, the auction officially begins!" With a bang, Liu Renwen dropped the hammer.</p>

    <p>After confirming that this was indeed Dao Ancestor Wang's item, the bidding started instantly.</p>

    <p>"I want 10 million mixed spirit stones!" Someone immediately raised their hands, and the word was 10 million. This look of sure winning made everyone stunned.</p>

    <p>Then a more intense fight began.</p>

    <p>"15 million mixed spirit stones!"</p>

    <p>"20 million mixed spirit stones!"</p>

    <p>In fact, a single futon does not cost that much money at all.</p>

    <p>The most important thing is that this is Dao Ancestor Wang's thing.</p>

    <p>Since it is something used by Dao Ancestor, it is possible that by sitting on it and meditating, you can directly comprehend Heavenly Dao like Dao Ancestor.</p>

    <p>"This is Dao Ancestor Wang's thing. You don't want it?" Zhang Zhui was a little curious. He looked at Dongda.</p>

    <p>"There will be better ones later. Don't worry." Emperor Dongda shook his head.</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhang Zhui also discovered it. Even though the cultivators below were fighting for it one by one.</p>

    <p>None of the big customers in the private room upstairs said anything.</p>

    <p>Not only Emperor Dongda, but also Mrs. Shanxiu and King Tiankun were silent, as if waiting for something.</p>

    <p>Thinking of what Emperor Dongda said just now, Zhang Zhui judged that Emperor Dongda must have received some auction news in advance.</p>

    <p>Soon, the Heaven-Bearing Futon was bought by a young royal family member for a high price of 50 million mixed spirit stones.</p>

    <p>"Actually, it's not worth that much money at all. It's such a waste... What a waste of money!" Wang Zhen was speechless.</p>

    <p>After all, the Wang family in their divine domain is also one of the descendants of Dao Ancestor Wang. There are many things passed down by Dao Ancestor Wang in the family.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen is speechless. If this could be moved here from modern times and sold, he would be as rich as the country.</p>

    <p>After this giant futon, the Central Auction House took out three more items one after another.</p>

    <p>A book of {The Skill of Appraisal of the Strong}. A coupon for the experience of pulling a coffin in Kowloon. And a pill of stretching one's legs and staring.</p>

    <p>They are all priceless and high-quality treasures. The cultivators downstairs were fighting for them. But there was no one fighting for them upstairs. There was no movement at all.</p>

    <p>Until the next object appears...</p>

    <p>That is a scroll.</p>

    <p>Even the name is very domineering. It's called the Book of Nine Realms.</p>

    <p>"The Book of Nine Realms. You don't need any more introduction from me, right?" Qin Zhong, who plays Liu Renwen, said.</p>

    <p>While he was holding the Book of Nine Realms in his hand, his heart was trembling slightly. Because the popularity of this thing has lasted almost all eternity. It is an existence that no one knows about.</p>

    <p>Because this is Dao Ancestor Wang's orthodox certificate. It contains Dao Ancestor Wang's autograph!</p>

    <p>Dao Ancestor Wang said that no matter who he is or how he obtains it, as long as he can open the Book of Nine Realms and understand the words written inside, he can become his true disciple!</p>

    <p>In recent years, the Book of Nine Realms has been widely circulated in the world of eternal cultivation. There are also some profiteers who even make money by selling fake goods.</p>

    <p>Because it is said that those who get the original version of the Book of Nine Realms will see nothing.</p>

    <p>To this day, no one can become a disciple of Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>And now in the Central Auction House, with the guarantee of such a big business, it can be confirmed that the Book of Nine Realms must be authentic!</p>

    <p>According to the information in the diary, Wang Ling knows that this scroll is what Emperor Dongda will bid for next.</p>

    <p>But at the same time Wang Ling was also confused.</p>

    <p>Because he now knows who the true disciple of Dao Ancestor Wang is.</p>

    <p>In other words, after Emperor Dongda acquired the Book of Nine Realms, other changes occurred. In the end, Peng Xiren took advantage of it...</p>

    <p>"One hundred million mixed spirit stones!"</p>

    <p>Sure enough, someone immediately spoke.</p>

    <p>That was the voice of King Tiankun.</p>

    <p>He didn't listen to Liu Renwen's quotation and reserve price at all. He made the move for 100 million, which shocked everyone in the audience.</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda was unceremonious about this: "Two hundred million mixed spirit stones!"</p>

    <p>He refused to give in. He looked like he was going to fight King Tiankun.</p>
