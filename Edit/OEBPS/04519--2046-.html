  <h1>Chapter 2046 The tree in the miracle</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: This is a spirit of Dharma that has never been seen before in the decadent years. Tall, void, majestic, mysterious... all the words that can be used to describe miracles seem to be insufficient to describe the shock of facing this spirit of Dharma.</p>

    <p>He is like a deep galaxy hidden in the depths of the universe. His humanoid body, whose face cannot be seen clearly, is dotted with stars. It is vaguely visible that the stars are like diamonds adorning all directions of his body.</p>

    <p>Originally a huge cosmic celestial body, this Dharma spirit is as small as dust and has become the most gorgeous embellishment.</p>

    <p>This palm directly shattered the void of the supreme world. Dark cracks poured out from all directions. The chaotic energy swept across the entire supreme world overwhelmingly.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's movements were almost synchronized with the spirit of the Dharma. He controlled the spirit of the Dharma and shattered the Chaos Chain with one palm. Divine light flashed between his five fingers. It was so dazzling that it was intimidating.</p>

    <p>In the core world, Sun Ru and Immortal Toya were completely stunned. They looked at each other, unable to say a word as they looked at the scene in front of them.</p>

    <p>They have seen the Dharma Appearance Spirit before, but this is the first time they have seen such an exaggerated Dharma Appearance Spirit.</p>

    <p>What kind of existence is this?</p>

    <p>Is he the God who controls everything in the universe?</p>

    <p>It's so suffocating...</p>

    <p>Even Wang Ying was shocked.</p>

    <p>As the shadow of Wang Ling, he has almost all the abilities of Wang Ling. But there are only two things that cannot be copied from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>One is King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>And the other one is the spirit of Dharma.</p>

    <p>Of course. Now his state can share the spirit of Dharma with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But if he waits until one day, he is really separated from Wang Ling's body and achieves complete freedom.</p>

    <p>He cannot take away the spirit of Wang Ling's Dharma.</p>

    <p>Such a Dharma image is so amazing that it makes people feel at a loss for words.</p>

    <p>Xifengnian was also stunned.</p>

    <p>But I can only say that the Ancestor King realm deserves to be the Ancestor King realm.</p>

    <p>As one of the fairly strong guys that Wang Ling has encountered so far, he still shows a "fearless" attitude even in front of Wang Ling's Dharma Spirit.</p>

    <p>It's not that I'm really not afraid of the bad years. It's just that the ignorant are fearless.</p>

    <p>Because he has no idea what the existence of this Dharma-appearance spirit is, so he shows such an attitude.</p>

    <p>The next moment.</p>

    <p>Under the control of Wang Ling, the spirit of Dharma shrank from a giant state to a normal humanoid size. Then it turned into an aurora and suddenly jumped out.</p>

    <p>Xufengnian reacted quickly. He immediately crossed his arms to defend himself.</p>

    <p>The impact of Wang Ling's Dharma Spirit was too great. The desperate charge directly brought Xufengnian through the void wall behind him. The void wall of the entire supreme world was continuously penetrated.</p>

    <p>Even the surrounding environment is constantly changing. Volcanoes, jungles, deserts, magma fields, the Milky Way... The spirit of the Dharma is decaying and passing through the dimensional space layers created by all natural environments.</p>

    <p>After going around a long circle, we finally came back to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The bandages all over his body were torn apart. He was naked. He knelt in front of Wang Ling in an awkward posture. His head was dripping with blood. This round of Dharma attack allowed him to travel through countless dimensional wall battlefields in a short period of time. Let Xifeng Nian still not come back to his senses.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling found out that Xifengnian is really quite resistant to beatings.</p>

    <p>The power of the Dharma Impact just now is equivalent to 20% of the Law Palm. That is, the palm force of 200 consecutive slaps when he was in the normal sealed state.</p>

    <p>In the end, the body of the decayed Ancestor King was still able to resist.</p>

    <p>Although he was in a miserable state, he did not die directly.</p>

    <p>For Xu Fengnian, this was supposed to be his comeback battle announcing his rebirth.</p>

    <p>But the embarrassment at this moment made him almost crazy. He could not accept the ending in front of him.</p>

    <p>He had been silent in the ancient cauldron for so long, thinking that he had perfectly digested the cells of the Outer God. Having inherited the Heavenly Dao tradition, he should be invincible in the world.</p>

    <p>As a result, at this moment, he dared to kneel in front of a boy who was only seventeen years old.</p>

    <p>Seventeen years old...</p>

    <p>So powerful...</p>

    <p>Gu's growth is completely incomparable to his.</p>

    <p>Xuefengnian could not accept such a result. Blood spurted out from the corners of his eyes, and he completely fell into madness. After he staggered to his feet, his face was completely distorted. The original arrogance was no longer visible.</p>

    <p>"Are you the only one who has the spirit of Dharma? I also have it..."</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the supreme world in chaos, which was struck by the spirit of Wang Ling, was shaken again. A tree trunk with a radius of several hundred feet was pulled directly from the ground like the top pillar of this supreme world. And got up.</p>

    <p>Countless branches spread out. They were extremely powerful and possessed an astonishing spiritual power. Wang Ling only glanced at the tree trunk. It was densely covered with scales of various spiritual beasts, holy beasts and even mythical beasts in the universe. The main trunk is tightly wrapped in dense scales, making it airtight.</p>

    <p>The tree on the other side...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was a little surprised. He recognized the origin of the spirit of the Dharma.</p>

    <p>It's just that the tree on the other side is definitely not like this in its normal state.</p>

    <p>The real tree of the other side is a cosmic sacred tree that symbolizes immortality. If you want to trace its age, it is even dozens of epochs older than the cosmic sacred tree that Wang Ling knows.</p>

    <p>The current tree on the other side is already a legendary existence. It only appears in ancient books. And the spirit of the Dharma that has decayed for many years is actually the tree on the other side. This is a point that makes Wang Ling slightly surprised.</p>

    <p>Of course. The normal tree on the other side determined by Wang Ling is different from the one summoned by the decaying harvest in front of me.</p>

    <p>Faintly. Wang Ling You can actually hear the secret cry of the tree on the other side, which is the spirit of the Dharma. Under normal conditions, it should not have such ten thousand scales on its body.</p>

    <p>That was the result of being invaded by the bloodline of foreign gods and forced to strengthen.</p>

    <p>Although it looks shocking enough, the actual combat power is stronger than before. But the tree itself is a painful experience.</p>

    <p>But the mutated tree on the other side cannot decide its own destiny. It has completely surrendered to decay and abundance.</p>

    <p>With the crazy seals of the decadent years, a huge willow branch is like a divine whip, whipping from the sky.</p>

    <p>The other shore tree has branches of thousands of trees. It is not just willow branches. But the power of just one willow branch is also huge. It directly distorts the surrounding void.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling clenched his fist. His Dharma Spirit also clenched his fist simultaneously. Without any fear, he walked directly towards the wicker and transformed into a human form. In a flash, he directly used his body to split the huge wicker. Split in half.</p>

    <p>However, the wicker that was split into two parts became stronger and more difficult to deal with than before.</p>

    <p>The next moment, several more willow branches came across from the sky.</p>

    <p>The regenerative ability and resilience of the other shore tree are already strong. Now it has been forcibly strengthened by the blood of the Outer God. Its ability to create regeneration has been taken to a higher level.</p>

    <p>This supreme world is the soil from which he can continuously draw nutrients.</p>

    <p>And with the cover of the tree on the other side, you can delay time to heal your injuries.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling won't let the bad years succeed like this.</p>

    <p>Use his own way and give back to him...</p>

    <p>This is something Wang Ling often does.</p>

    <p>Isn't it just a tree?</p>

    <p>Although the tree on the other side is the spirit of the Dharma in the miracle, so what.</p>

    <p>Even if the Ushen Tree he knows is not as good as the other side tree, Wang Ling also knows the trees in other miracles...</p>

    <p>Do you want to compete with him in planting trees? www.uukanshu.net</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling stared expressionlessly at the huge sacred tree in front of him that once gave people a fear of giants. He sighed calmly in his heart.</p>

    <p>The next second, golden light emerged from his hand, directly summoning Jingke and Bai Qiao together.</p>

    <p>I saw that he merged Jingke and Bai Qiao and handed them directly into the hands of his Dharma Appearance Spirit.</p>

    <p>The three were planted directly into the ground of this supreme world.</p>

    <p>Isn't it the tree on the other side?</p>

    <p>Ha. The tree in the miracle. He also knew one...</p>

    <p>Now, he uses the spirit of Dharma as nourishment.</p>

    <p>Use one miracle to cultivate another miracle!</p>
