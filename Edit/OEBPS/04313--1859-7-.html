  <h1>Chapter 1859 Soul exchange across eternity</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Things are always complicated. After Wang Ling sees it for real this time, he feels that he has gained a lot of knowledge.</p>

    <p>He learned from Emperor Dongda's mouth that Jiao Yang was the child of Emperor Dongda when he was young and an Eternal One who was not of royal blood.</p>

    <p>However, due to considerations of identity and environmental factors, he could not directly adopt Jiao Yang.</p>

    <p>Therefore, he entrusted Jiao Yang to his good brother Sheng Zihua for adoption.</p>

    <p>Externally, it is only said that Sheng Zihua has an extra daughter. No one will doubt it.</p>

    <p>So now comes the problem. Since Emperor Dongda has long known that this sun goddess is his daughter.</p>

    <p>And he also entrusted his daughter to his trusted brother.</p>

    <p>Why was this Sheng Zihua finally exterminated for the crime of rebellion?</p>

    <p>This is currently Wang Ling's biggest question after learning the whole story.</p>

    <p>But obviously, this matter touched the heart of Emperor Dongda. He did not continue to ask further questions.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is not a person who likes gossip.</p>

    <p>Moreover, he is not interested in this long-lasting story, which is like a house with a mother-in-law and a family.</p>

    <p>Now he just wants to know who is this Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>And who is the mastermind behind this eternal time travel?</p>

    <p>Judging from the clues collected so far, Dao Ancestor Wang is just a suspect. It is not necessarily the trap set up by Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>But besides Dao Ancestor Wang, who else has the ability to do this?</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe or Fenmu Shen?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Although he had doubts, he didn't realize that these two people had such ability.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, he wouldn't have defeated him in the previous battles.</p>

    <p>Follow the next diary process. Wang Ling The next thing to do is to go with Emperor Dongda to the Yangxin Hall to meet the Sun Goddess, whose appearance has completely changed. She has even lost that key memory.</p>

    <p>There are so many psychic magic circles used for teleportation in the huge imperial palace that it is impossible to count them all. Thousands of psychic magic, magic circles are intertwined and linked with each other.</p>

    <p>These were all arranged by Emperor Dongda. No one knows the overall layout and structure better than Emperor Dongda. Therefore, wherever you want to go, you can easily complete the teleportation as long as you skillfully use these spiritual magic circles.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling arrived at the Yangxin Hall, they found that the Sun Goddess, covered in bandages, was already sitting behind the gauze curtain.</p>

    <p>In addition, Ye Ren, the only insider standing outside the curtain, and a palace maid who was most trusted by Emperor Dongda were standing quietly in a secret corner, waiting quietly.</p>

    <p>The rest of the people all stood in two lines outside the hall, lowering their heads to listen to the announcement.</p>

    <p>"This palace maid has an unusual identity. Is she also a member of the royal family?" Wang Ying asked directly.</p>

    <p>"That's right. She is a saint from the Holy Stone Sect. She came here to practice." Emperor Dongda replied silently in his heart.</p>

    <p>"Oh." Wang Ying agreed lightly.</p>

    <p>But his eyes always stayed on this Holy Stone Sect saint.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if it was an illusion. He felt that this saint looked familiar.</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ying is not the only one who feels this way.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling also feels that something is wrong with this saint.</p>

    <p>Not only is something wrong with the Saint, but even with the Sun Goddess he feels something is wrong.</p>

    <p>This proud goddess was sitting there. Her obedient sitting posture revealed an uneasy feeling.</p>

    <p>This kind of sitting posture. Wang Ling feels a little familiar. He feels like he has seen it in somewhere.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, the smallest details of movements can make people aware that something is wrong.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling's eyes have been fixed on this "Goddess of the Sun", hoping to find some clues from it.</p>

    <p>During this process, Sun Rong was also secretly sizing up this Eternal Emperor of the East.</p>

    <p>She didn't know why. Sun Rong found that the way Emperor Dongda looked at her seemed a little strange...</p>

    <p>It was an indescribable kindness.</p>

    <p>The first instinct Sun Rong had was that it looked exactly like Boss Sun's look when he looked at her.</p>

    <p>"Reporting to the Emperor. Sheng Jiao Yang has been brought here to wait for the Emperor's announcement." After confirming that the door of the Yangxin Hall was closed, he saw that Emperor Dongda was already firmly seated in his seat. Ye Ren immediately bowed and reported.</p>

    <p>"Thank you for your hard work, Ye Ren."</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda said: "In addition, Ye Ren, you need to remember that she will no longer be called Sheng Jiao Yang. From now on, she will take my surname. Her surname is Xia and her name is Zinian."</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>Ye Ren nodded.</p>

    <p>Then he glanced at the Sun Goddess over there and said, "Why don't you thank the Emperor for the name?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was in a daze. As a result, Emperor Dongda quickly waved his hand. The expression in his eyes was unusually kind: "That's all. It's just a name. No need to be polite."</p>

    <p>After all, he is the white-robed steward of Emperor Dongda. Ye Ren knows more secrets about Emperor Dongda than the other people in the palace.</p>

    <p>Therefore, after hearing this name, Zhang Zhui quickly received physical feedback from Ye Ren's body and searched for a memory related to this name.</p>

    <p>That was the truth behind the Sheng family's rebellion. It was an extremely cruel history.</p>

    <p>However, for Zhang Zhui, who is also an Eternal, it is not so difficult to accept. The various overt and covert struggles and conflicts in the Eternal Era have long made him numb.</p>

    <p>And it was because he couldn't afford to play with this group of people that he embarked on a path of no return where he relied on stealing to maintain his life.</p>

    <p>But who would have thought that after such a long time, he would not only be reborn in the modern cultivation society, but also serve as an advisor to the entire Songhai City anti-pickpocket team...</p>

    <p>Just when Zhang Zhui was dazed, Emperor Dongda spoke again: "Tomorrow and the day after, there will be a meeting of the Four Emperors at the Trade Star in the Central Region. Xia Zi Nian will also go with me."</p>

    <p>According to the script, Zhang Zhui quickly retorted: "Please think twice, Emperor! Even if you have changed her identity, there are still risks in doing so. Emperor Xi is acting treacherously. What if something goes wrong..."</p>

    <p>"It doesn't matter." Dongda said with a calm face: "I just want to slap him in the face in front of him so that he will not have any thoughts or bad thoughts about Zi Nian in the future. Otherwise, my Supreme Light Kongque Ming King. He will burn the Western Region into a human purgatory at any time."</p>

    <p>These domineering speeches echoed in the empty hall, making the atmosphere in the venue slightly solemn.</p>

    <p>"Okay, Emperor. In that case, please allow me to have the Saint Lady from the Holy Stone Sect as my escort." Zhang Zhui bowed.</p>

    <p>"You two are the people I trust most. Among the people accompanying me, I will naturally take them with me and wait."</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda said: "In addition, I am going to Trade Star. I need Ye Ren to find out some news in advance."</p>

    <p>"Please give me the emperor's orders." Zhang Zhui agreed.</p>

    <p>"I remember that there is a very famous restaurant on the trading star in the Central Territory called Manjiang Tower?"</p>

    <p>"There is such a place. Does the emperor want to entertain friends?"</p>

    <p>"No. I want to eat it myself..."</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda thought for a moment, then cautiously said, "Go and ask the cook over there if he knows how to make crispy noodles."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong, Wang Zhen, Zhang Zhui: "???"</p>
