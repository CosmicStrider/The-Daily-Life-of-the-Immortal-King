  <h1>Chapter 1447 Sun Rong vs. Jiugong Liangzi</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When Sun Rong received the text message from Zhuo Yi, she almost immediately felt a sense of danger.</p>

    <p>When I saw the name Jiugong Liangzi on the list before. Sun Rong, I had a vague feeling that the purpose of Jiugong's family entering Number 60 High School was impure.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, the moth seemed to be bigger than I thought.</p>

    <p>Are you actually here because of what happened six years ago?</p>

    <p>Although I don't know why the Jiugong family put all the blame on Zhuo Yi. But since this matter is related to Wang Ling, Sun Rong naturally cannot sit idly by.</p>

    <p>It took her so long to finally know the secret of her classmate Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>How could this secret be let out so easily?</p>

    <p>"Jiugong Liangzi, right..." Sun Rong took a deep breath. Then he called up the monitoring directly through the student union's office computer and learned Jiugong Liangzi's current location.</p>

    <p>Everything is just as Zhuo Yi said. Jiugong Liangzi seems to be wandering around the school. But in fact, he is deliberately investigating those boys with dead fish eyes.</p>

    <p>The situation is more urgent than I imagined.</p>

    <p>The girl immediately sent a text message to a student union officer and asked her to bring Jiugong Liangzi to her office.</p>

    <p>So... just five or six minutes later.</p>

    <p>This aloof young lady dressed in dark gothic style appeared at the door of the student union office with a proud face.</p>

    <p>The female bodyguard carrying a bag of pancakes and fruit behind her saw this and quickly stopped the female officer. Then she closed the office door.</p>

    <p>Very strong smell of gunpowder...</p>

    <p>It feels like a war could be triggered at any time.</p>

    <p>"Will they fight..." The female student union secretary was a little worried.</p>

    <p>"You're overthinking. We're all young ladies. Why did we start a fight? I held you back. I was actually saving you."</p>

    <p>"Save me?"</p>

    <p>"It's not a good thing to know too much..." the female bodyguard said.</p>

    <p>This is the experience she gained from working as a personal bodyguard for many years.</p>

    <p>It's better not to get involved in the fight between the eldest ladies easily.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, there is a high probability that you will be captured and taken to Shenjiang...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>And sure enough, everything was as expected by the female bodyguard.</p>

    <p>It was impossible to start a fight. But the smell of gunpowder was indeed very strong.</p>

    <p>After feeling the door behind him being closed, Jiugong Liangzi took three steps and two steps at a time and quickly came to the desk.</p>

    <p>She supported the table and looked straight at the calm girl in front of her with her purple eyes. There was a faint murderous look in her eyes: "Sun Rong. We haven't seen each other for a long time."</p>

    <p>"Yeah. I haven't seen you for a long time."</p>

    <p>Sun Rongsmile: "I didn't expect you would choose Number 60 High School this time."</p>

    <p>Because she had already seen the temperament of Jiugong Liangzi, Sun Rong did not feel uncomfortable with Jiugong Liangzi's seemingly aggressive attitude.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi is an old acquaintance of hers, and she has a certain understanding of him.</p>

    <p>So for Sun Rong, it may be easier to deal with Jiugong than Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>"We have all grown up a lot. But considering your level, why haven't you broken through the Foundation Building yet? I will break through soon. I can break through the Foundation Building to the Golden Core within the first year of high school. This is an amazing growth, right? ?" Jiugong Liangzi said as she found a chair and sat down.</p>

    <p>It's normal for girls to compare themselves to each other.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was not surprised. The expression on his face was obviously helpless: "As for the realm, just let nature take its course. And for girls, it is useless just to grow up in the realm."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean?" Jiugong Liangzi frowned slightly. There was something in his words.</p>

    <p>"You know what I mean by that." Sun Rong smiled imploringly and looked at the flatness of JiuGong.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, flat can not only be used as an adjective. In fact, it can also be a noun...</p>

    <p>Realizing that he was being defeated by Sun Rong, the corner of Jiugong Liangzi's mouth twitched: "You...you are not the same!"</p>

    <p>"Slightly better than you." Sun Rong straightened her back, showing off her curvy figure.</p>

    <p>In the case where there is no obvious gap, the better ones are the most painful.</p>

    <p>I have to say. Sun Rong's words did have the effect of the Five Thunder Initiation. Jiugong Liangzi was so shocked that he had a nervous breakdown. He was ashamed and annoyed. He didn't know what to say.</p>

    <p>After all, this is a topic that only girls compare and pay constant attention to.</p>

    <p>It can only be said that as the student council president of Number 60 High School, Sun Rong is worthy of being Sun Rong. Such an outstanding rhythmic ability... is indeed beyond the reach of ordinary people.</p>

    <p>With just a few words, Jiugong Liangzi was thrown into confusion. He even forgot the purpose of coming to the student union in the first place.</p>

    <p>Although... on the surface, Jiugong Liangzi's expression still hasn't changed much.</p>

    <p>But Sun Rong knows that classmate Jiugong must be very confused right now.</p>

    <p>However, Sun Rong is very impressed by the fact that he can only control his emotions without showing them on his expression.</p>

    <p>This is indeed a worthy opponent.</p>

    <p>But unfortunately, the rank is not enough.</p>

    <p>After a period of deathly silence, Jiugong Liangzi took a deep breath. She gritted her teeth and planned to get you back: "Your family started out by making elixirs. So I actually have reason to doubt. Did you take something special?" of elixirs."</p>

    <p>However, what Jiugong Liangzi didn't expect was that the girl sitting in the president's seat actually admitted it directly!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "Yes, classmate Jiugong. I took some supplements."</p>

    <p>"You actually admitted it like that?" Jiugong Liangzi was shocked. He was surprised by Sun Rong's chess move.</p>

    <p>She felt as if she was playing chess with Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>However, she couldn't understand the opponent's moves at all...</p>

    <p>It's okay to admit it directly... What kind of operation is this?!</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi thinks this is actually a very private thing.</p>

    <p>Just like some celebrities who clearly have had plastic surgery but say they have not.</p>

    <p>And for girls.</p>

    <p>That part...</p>

    <p>Of course it is purely natural. Only then does it have the capital to show off.</p>

    <p>"Although I take supplements, they are all natural." Sun Rong smiled slightly: "Jiugong should know very well the importance of genes."</p>

    <p>"Gene?"</p>

    <p>"The supplements I take can only stimulate the original genes to achieve growth. But if the genes themselves are not good, no matter how much I take, it will be useless."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong smiled and said: "It's like some height-increasing products on the market. If your parents are not tall, no matter how much you eat, you can't change your genes and grow taller."</p>

    <p>The more Jiugong Liangzi listened, the more he felt that these words were inappropriate: "Please explain clearly...what do you mean..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was busy apologizing, "Don't be mistaken, I didn't mean anything by it. It's just that I've known for a long time that fellow student Jiugong might be coming to Sixty, so I prepared a gift in advance to meet her."</p>

    <p>After saying that, she opened the drawer and placed the gift box she had prepared on the table.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi walked over and stroked the gift box: "This is?"</p>

    <p>"I take supplements." Sun Rong said with a smile: "As long as you take it, it will take effect immediately."</p>

    <p>"Heh. Does this lady still need something like this?"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi snorted. But he still reached out to accept the gift box with a grateful face: "Don't get me wrong. I just left it for my female bodyguard to eat. Who knows if there is any poison in it."</p>

    <p>"Understood..."Sun Rong nodded.</p>

    <p>After accepting the gift, Jiugong Liangzi immediately turned around and left.</p>

    <p>After seeing the office door closed, Sun Rong's expression completely relaxed.</p>

    <p>Classmate Jiugong is really difficult to deal with.</p>

    <p>But in this round, she won...</p>

    <p>Because the so-called "supplements" in the gift box are not real supplements.</p>

    <p>It's a mildly hallucinogenic water called "The Whole World Is Dead Fish Eye Potion"</p>

    <p>The effect can be achieved by [oral administration] or [inhalation].</p>

    <p>Those who are infected will continue to have hallucinations within 72 hours.</p>

    <p>Just like the name of the potion, everyone's eyes will turn into dead fish eyes in the sight of the person who is infected...</p>

    <p>This is a situation that Sun Rong expected to happen before. The scientific research department of the group was specially commissioned to secretly prepare the medicine.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, it really came in handy this time.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, after Jiugong Liangzi left the office, he immediately went to the women's toilet.</p>

    <p>She couldn't wait to open the bottle of "supplement." She smelled it first, and then frowned: "This should be taken orally to be effective..."</p>

    <p>This put Jiugong Liangzi into deep entanglement.</p>

    <p>After all, this is what is eaten in the stomach...</p>

    <p>After thinking about it carefully, Jiugong Liangzi felt that it would be better to be cautious: "Heh. Sun Rong...You want to trick me into taking the potion? I won't be fooled! I'm going to test it. What is this? What."</p>

    <p>So, she resisted the thought of not taking it and put the potion away again.</p>

    <p>However, Jiugong Liangzi did not know.</p>

    <p>In fact, she has already been tricked.</p>

    <p>The whole world is full of "dead fish eye medicine." Inhalation is also effective.</p>

    <p>And this... is also within Sun Rong's calculation...</p>
