  <h1>Chapter 1377: Full of Tiger and Wolf Words</h1>

  <div>

    <p>More than two hundred text messages flooded into the mailbox. Wang Ling almost thought his phone was a ghost.</p>

    <p>These are all messages from Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Thanks...like...</p>

    <p>Because the text messages jumped too frequently. Wang Ling probably scanned a few keywords.</p>

    <p>He guessed that Sun Rong was probably thanking himself for giving away the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube.</p>

    <p>However, in Wang Ling's opinion, this little thing really doesn't need to be thanked.</p>

    <p>To him, the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube is like taking an exam. He takes it as casually as the eraser taken by his deskmate next door.</p>

    <p>This is not a valuable thing at all.</p>

    <p>So. Do you want to reply?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling wants to say two words: It's okay.</p>

    <p>Others have sent more than 200 messages. It would seem a bit rude to pretend that I didn't see it.</p>

    <p>But when I put my finger on it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling hesitated again.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>After revising it two or three times, Wang Ling stared at the ellipses in the reply box and fell into deep thought.</p>

    <p>"You have today too?" Wang Ying laughed.</p>

    <p>Then he reached out directly and pressed the send button for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at Wang Ying. He didn't know whether he couldn't lift the knife or whether Wang Ying was drifting away.</p>

    <p>But since the text message has been sent, let's just accept it as it comes.</p>

    <p>Anyway, it's just a series of ellipses.</p>

    <p>"Your Majesty, come here."</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling heard Father Wang's call from inside the study.</p>

    <p>He didn't think much about it. He put the phone on the table and walked over quickly.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Because of Er Ha, all the more than two hundred messages in the manuscript box were dumped out at once.</p>

    <p>The girl was ashamed and annoyed. Even after Er Ha and the monk left, her body temperature still did not drop.</p>

    <p>She hugged the pillow and lay on the bed. She buried her face deeply into the pillow.</p>

    <p>That's... more than 200 pieces of information...</p>

    <p>There were many words in it that she wanted to say but did not have the courage to say.</p>

    <p>As a result, now, everything has been sent out...</p>

    <p>Classmate Wang Ling. Didn't you see everything?</p>

    <p>Sun Rong felt anxious.</p>

    <p>"You haven't replied yet..." After a while, Sun Rong moved half of his face out of the pillow and stared at Sun Ying'er on the side.</p>

    <p>"No."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er held her cell phone in her hand and stared at the mailbox like a searchlight. She sighed: "Hey, you two are so troublesome. If you want to see it, you can see it yourself. If you want me to help you keep an eye on it."</p>

    <p>"But just in case...just in case..."</p>

    <p>"So Rongrong is afraid of being rejected? But I don't think there is any chance. Ling Zhenren has always been stupid. Even if he sees it, he doesn't feel much. Rongrong's confession through text messages is too pale! You should just hug him and chew on him!" Sun Ying'er chuckled.</p>

    <p>"What did you say..." Sun Rong buried his face again.</p>

    <p>About a few seconds passed.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's mobile phone made two "ding dong" sounds.</p>

    <p>"Reply Rongrong!" Sun Ying'er said excitedly: "There are actually two replies!!!"</p>

    <p>"Two?"Sun Rong was surprised.</p>

    <p>Classmate Wang Ling...when did you have so many words?</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er said: "The first one is the ellipsis."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong asked: "What about the second item?"</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er: "The second one...he said. He likes you too!"</p>

    <p>Hearing this. Sun Rong should have been happy.</p>

    <p>But it's a pity. Such a contrasting text message style. It doesn't take much thinking to know that this is definitely not the work of classmate Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Sun RongAlthough I am looking forward to a reply, I am still a rational person.</p>

    <p>She was worried that Wang Ling would be angry.</p>

    <p>But facts have proven that this worry is completely unnecessary.</p>

    <p>"Ellipsis... As expected of classmate Wang Ling." Sun Rong couldn't help laughing in his heart.</p>

    <p>"Rongrong, what's wrong with you? Ling Zhenren replied that he also likes you..."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er felt strange. She felt that Sun Rong did not seem as happy as he looked.</p>

    <p>"The first one was sent by classmate Wang Ling. The second one was definitely not sent by him." The girl said calmly.</p>

    <p>"It wasn't from Ling Zhenren?" Sun Ying'er suddenly thought of something: "Could it be..."</p>

    <p>Someone who can appear next to Wang Ling at any time and has a motive for committing the crime. Sun Ying'er can only think of one person!</p>

    <p>"It's the Master of Shadows." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>She dared to vouch for this guess.</p>

    <p>"This guy is so perverted! He actually used someone else's cell phone to send text messages! And he even teased you, Rongrong!" Sun Ying'er couldn't bear it anymore. She didn't know why she got so excited when Wang Ying was mentioned. An idea of resistance.</p>

    <p>"Ying'er, don't be impulsive."Sun Rong saw Sun Ying'er getting angry. It felt a little funny.</p>

    <p>"It's okay! Those who deserved the punishment have already been punished! Let me see what other excuses he can find! Humph!" Sun Ying'er was not to be outdone.</p>

    <p>"..." Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Immediately, Sun Ying'er also started operating Sun Rong's mobile phone.</p>

    <p>Just like that. The two shadows had the following conversation with each other on their master's mobile phone...</p>

    <p>"Ah! Classmate Wang Ling! I'm so happy! Can you really date me?"</p>

    <p>"That's great Sun Rong. It seems that we are really in love with each other! How about I come to your house now?"</p>

    <p>"Coming to my house...isn't that good? I'd better go to classmate Wang Ling's house! I've admired classmate Wang Ling's biceps for a long time!"</p>

    <p>"Really? Come on then. You can even touch it!"</p>

    <p>"Is it really possible...Classmate Wang Ling..."</p>

    <p>"Okay! You can also touch my chest and abdominal muscles... Sun Rong Girl, don't be embarrassed. Let's do this. I'm a boy. I decided to be more proactive. I'll come over and touch you now."</p>

    <p>"You come here now???" Sun Ying'er was shocked. He was so frightened that he almost dropped his phone.</p>

    <p>"Then you can find another place."</p>

    <p>"Somewhere else?"</p>

    <p>"For example, the moon you are familiar with."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying sneered and replied.</p>

    <p>Realizing that his identity has been revealed, Sun Ying'er decided not to pretend anymore!</p>

    <p>She's going to show off her cards!</p>

    <p>"Ouch! Wang Ying. You are so perverted! You are playing with Ling Zhenren's cell phone like this. Did Ling Zhenren make it!" Sun Ying'er typed quickly with her slender fingers, venting her full protest against Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>"Ha. Woman! Are you playing with Sun Rong girl's mobile phone?" Wang Ying chuckled.</p>

    <p>"I got Rongrong's permission!" Sun Ying'er said confidently</p>

    <p>"Then these characters were also taught to you by Miss Sun? Huh?" Wang Ying typed.</p>

    <p>"I just wanted to test how perverted you are! You actually asked to go to a girl's house and let her touch you... I didn't expect you to have such attributes." Sun Ying'er couldn't bear it anymore. Holding the phone in his hands Laugh out loud.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong don't know what Sun Ying'er is laughing about.</p>

    <p>She sat on the edge of the bed. She looked at Sun Ying'er, holding her cell phone and lying on the sofa with her head tilted up. She was smiling wildly.</p>

    <p>However, this laughter did not last long at all.</p>

    <p>Because the next moment...</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er was completely gone.</p>

    <p>She was swept away directly by a black shadow.</p>

    <p>It happened almost in the blink of an eye.</p>

    <p>Wait for Sun Rong to react.</p>

    <p>There was only one mobile phone left on the sofa.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er passed away peacefully...</p>
