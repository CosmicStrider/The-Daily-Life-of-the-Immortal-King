  <h1>Chapter 1876 King Tiankun's Revenge</h1>

  <div>

    <p>There are actually quite a few royal families these days who are thinking of sending their children to the imperial palace for training. But this is the first time they have seen Emperor Dongdai forcing people to come in even though they are not very familiar with each other.</p>

    <p>Even Emperor Dongda himself was a little confused after this incident happened, because he found that the direction of the script was now a little off track!</p>

    <p>And this... was actually something he didn't write in his diary!</p>

    <p>However, Emperor Dongda still chose to deal with it calmly. As he said before, as long as the big events do not change, these trivial things will not affect the real historical process.</p>

    <p>Accepting the children of the royal family to practice in the imperial palace. Over the years, he has also approved many new people to come in. In the eyes of others, it is a big deal, but in the eyes of Emperor Dongda, this is really nothing more than a trivial matter.</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda did not want to reveal his identity, so he bowed respectfully to Madam Shanxiu in front of him: "I have met Madam."</p>

    <p>"Sir, there is no need to be polite. It is not convenient to talk here. There is Chunlan Tower next to the temple. I think it is more suitable to talk there." Mrs. Shanxiu squinted her eyes and showed a kind smile.</p>

    <p>The two faced each other and communicated using team communication skills.</p>

    <p>"So Madam brought me here just to confirm whether there is any connection between me and Emperor Dongda?" Emperor Dongda smiled.</p>

    <p>"There is indeed a reason for this." Mrs. Shanxiu nodded slightly. In comparison, the Central Region Temple enshrines the four emperors at the same time. Under normal circumstances, after entering the temple, believers will go directly to the temple of the emperor they believe in.</p>

    <p>From this, Mrs. Shanxiu tested the identity of Emperor Dongda.</p>

    <p>"Sorry ma'am. I can't help you with this matter."</p>

    <p>However, to Mrs. Shanxiu's expectation, Emperor Dongda quickly declined her invitation after bowing politely: "As far as I know, the quota for the Eastern Region Imperial Palace has been filled this year. And the Eastern Territory Imperial Palace has been filled." We have just experienced a war. Many palaces were destroyed. It can be said that everything is in ruins, so there will be no new plans until it is completely restored to its original state."</p>

    <p>He chose to refuse directly. And he gave his reasons almost to the letter, leaving Mrs. Shanxiu speechless for a moment.</p>

    <p>In the opinion of Emperor Dongda, simply refusing is the best way. It will not leave any trouble at all. And it is impossible for him to leave in this situation.</p>

    <p>Because the purpose of coming to the temple was actually to wait for the furious King Tiankun to appear. As for asking for the secret of the Book of Nine Realms, it was just a matter of convenience. But Emperor Dongda did not expect that Mrs. Shanxiu would actually use this secret. The bait lured him to the temple to test him.</p>

    <p>All kinds of behaviors have made Emperor Dongda extremely dissatisfied. Therefore, even without the above-mentioned remarks, he would not accept the girl named Sun Fu in front of him.</p>

    <p>But after all, it was in front of the girl. Although he had declined Mrs. Shanxiu with the sound transmission technique, Emperor Dongda still said to Sun Fu in a calm tone as much as possible: "This girl is extremely talented. She can do anything she wants. It's a hot cake that everyone is fighting for. You don't necessarily have to choose the Eastern Region Imperial Palace. The Eastern Region Imperial Palace is in chaos right now. Maybe it would be a better choice for the girl to find another way out."</p>

    <p>These words of extraordinary talent are not the polite words of Emperor Dong.</p>

    <p>Sun Fu's talent for cultivation is indeed very good. She has already reached Soul Formation at a young age. This is very rare. If resources can be increased to cultivate it, it will not be difficult to enter the ancestral realm in the future.</p>

    <p>And Emperor Dongda could see that Sun Fu had suffered a lot. Although she was young, she was a ruthless character. She had a vague aura of thunder in her body, which proved that Sun Fu had just resisted the natural disaster not long ago.</p>

    <p>And she did it without the help of outsiders, using her own strength to resist the catastrophe. This is not something ordinary people have the courage to do.</p>

    <p>However, after listening to Emperor Dongda's words, Sun Fu's eyebrows wrinkled slightly. She was obviously a little surprised by such a rejection. She was not selected as a true disciple by Madam Shanxiu. It was not because her talent was not as good as Mei Yunhai's.</p>

    <p>It was because Mrs. Shanxiu felt that it was a waste of her talents to stay in the Immortal Mountain Sect. It would be better to be sent to the Imperial Palace to experience and practice like those royal children.</p>

    <p>She originally thought that if an outstanding young lady like herself could find a way to enter the imperial palace, she would not be rejected.</p>

    <p>But the man in front of her showed no interest in her at all. On the one hand, he said that she was a prize that everyone was vying for. On the other hand, he rejected her invitation and asked her to find another way out.</p>

    <p>Sun Fu thinks this is completely illogical...</p>

    <p>"Senior, are you trying to test my sincerity?"</p>

    <p>After thinking for a long time, Sun Fu came up with an answer. She faced Emperor Dongda's message with a wide-open mind and said, "I understand! It is not easy to join the imperial palace. If you are not careful, you may get mixed up with other people. Detailed work in a large area..."</p>

    <p>Dongda: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>"But please don't worry, senior. Sun Fu is definitely not that kind of person! Sun Fu has had no father or mother since she was a child. It was Brother Yunhai who picked me up and took me back to the Immortal Mountain Sect. I practiced under Madam Shanxiu. Reputation in the world of cultivation. This is the kind of trust that seniors always have to give, right?"</p>

    <p>Sun Fu saluted again and said respectfully: "No matter what the seniors think of me, it is Sun Fu's wish to join the Eastern Region Imperial Palace. I am only willing to join the Eastern Region. Now the Eastern Region Imperial Palace is full of waste and is in need of manpower. When the time comes, this little daughter Sun Fu can definitely help."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Sun Rong were shocked when they heard this.</p>

    <p>Now they can't explain it at all. What is this identical self-braining ability? It's simply an eternal replica of the modern Sun Rong!</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda sighed deeply when he heard this.</p>

    <p>He didn't expect that Sun Fu would be so determined. It would be difficult to drive her away now.</p>

    <p>But as long as it doesn't affect the overall situation, Dongda thinks that it doesn't hurt to take her along.</p>

    <p>So soon, Emperor Dongda changed his mind again. Looking at Mrs. Shanxiu, Mei Yunhai and Sun Fu, he said, "Let's do it. Madam, this girl Sun Fu can stay with me temporarily. I can also take her to Dongda, I will go to the Emperor's Palace to meet with the Emperor for recommendation. But now I have important matters in the Central Region, so I won't act so quickly... In the meantime, if this Sun Fu girl can keep her peace and not cause trouble to me. I'm still willing to help with this."</p>

    <p>Upon hearing this, Mrs. Shanxiu immediately beamed and said, "In that case, Mr. Lao is here. Of course. Since Mr. Lao can help Fu'er lead the way, I will naturally be grateful to him. I believe he is also very curious about the secrets of the Book of Nine Realms."</p>

    <p>These words made Emperor Dongda's eyes light up.</p>

    <p>He didn't expect that Mrs. Shanxiu actually knew something. She was not lying to him.</p>

    <p>Just as she was about to ask, Mrs. Shanxiu held a cane in her hand. Suddenly, as if she had a premonition of danger, she focused her attention on a certain direction in the void.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Shanxiu smiled: "But this matter, it seems that I have to wait until my husband solves the trouble at hand before I can tell him."</p>

    <p>It was a powerful and awe-inspiring killing intent. It came across from the sky, carrying an unparalleled sense of might and domineering.</p>

    <p>"The old thief in Room 1! You dare to steal my book of nine realms. I am here to find you!"</p>

    <p>No one has arrived yet, but the voice has already arrived.</p>

    <p>Then, the overwhelming pressure suddenly fell. A strong earthquake immediately occurred with the entire temple as the center.</p>

    <p>No one would have thought that King Tiankun could be so domineering and seek revenge directly in the temple in the middle region in front of the statues of the Four Emperors!</p>
