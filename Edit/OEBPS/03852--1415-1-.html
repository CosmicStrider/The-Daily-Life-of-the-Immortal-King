  <h1>Chapter 1415 Jin Deng's 1st Lesson</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This week is the transfer period for Number 60 High School. So the school will be particularly lively. As of next Monday, there may be new students joining Number 60 High School every day.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling came to school, several people who had already arrived were discussing this matter.</p>

    <p>As expected by Wang Ling. Among the transfer students this time, the foreigner attracted much attention.</p>

    <p>Several boys in the class were having a lively discussion. They were all imagining what kind of person that girl from abroad was.</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect that our school was promoted to a key city center in just half a semester. Now it is famous abroad. Even foreigners are interested."</p>

    <p>"I heard there is a foreign girl named Jiugong Liangzi! I don't know which class she will be assigned to!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong did not leak the list. However, the learning of "Jiugong Liangzi" has spread throughout the school. This makes Wang Ling feel a little strange.</p>

    <p>Logically speaking, it is impossible for a teacher to leak information about students in advance. And this list is in the hands of Sun Rong himself as the president of the student union.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong himself didn't tell anyone. Then who leaked this name?</p>

    <p>Therefore, after comprehensive consideration, Wang Ling feels that there may be only one truth to the problem...</p>

    <p>Unless it is the news released by Jiugong Liangzi himself in advance.</p>

    <p>It seems that this girl is not a good person...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p>He had no impression of Sun Island, because he had indeed fought against the ninja-type cultivators unearthed there before.</p>

    <p>It is a magical place that is good at combining ninjutsu and cultivation.</p>

    <p>Of course. Not all people from there are assassins... There are also kind-hearted native residents of the Sun Island.</p>

    <p>As for students like Jiugong Liangzi who choose to study abroad, their families are very well-off. However, there is a high probability that they are still not as good as Sun Rong's family...</p>

    <p>"Where did you get the news?" Su Xiao asked while collecting her homework.</p>

    <p>Everyone is very curious about this classmate "Jiugong Liangzi" who came all the way from abroad.</p>

    <p>"Everyone is spreading the word on the school forum," Guo Hao said: "I heard that this classmate Jiugong Liangzi is very beautiful. He is a beauty! And the Jiugong family is also quite famous in the local area as a family that removes spirits."</p>

    <p>"Removing spirits?"Wang Ling was startled.</p>

    <p>In fact, the concept of "exorcism" is not new in Huaxiu. Those so-called "exorcism agencies" essentially do the work of exorcism.</p>

    <p>It's just that the names vary from place to place.</p>

    <p>For example, Sun Island. People there prefer to call this behavior "removing spirits."</p>

    <p>As for the concept of "spirit", Wang Ling is not too unfamiliar... After all, when he was very young, "Er Ha" was also the shadow of his childhood.</p>

    <p>And just last semester, in order to find Bai Qiao, he also participated in an exorcism conference.</p>

    <p>To be honest, those spirits and ghosts are too weak. There is no real challenge at all.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling has rarely had the experience of being harassed by "spirits" since he was a child.</p>

    <p>Because the spirits that harassed him were all overtaken by the backlash...</p>

    <p>But even so.</p>

    <p>The exorcism (spiritual removal) industry still has great development prospects.</p>

    <p>In essence, it seems that any cultivator with good moral practice can engage in this profession. If it is not enough, if it is due to lack of experience, even a cultivator with advanced spiritual practice is very likely to fall into the trap.</p>

    <p>Those ghosts and ghosts are all very cunning. In comparison, in Wang Ling's view, those demons in the demon world are simpler...</p>

    <p>Therefore, there has been a saying on the Internet that "catching ghosts is more difficult than catching monsters."</p>

    <p>It is precisely because of this that a group of cultivators who slay demons and spirits and a group of cultivators who hunt demons have formed a chain of contempt for a while. Each group looks down on the other.</p>

    <p>If it weren't for the fact that the demon world and the human world are currently rebuilding old friendships, they would be planning to take the path of peaceful development.</p>

    <p>The two groups may still fight.</p>

    <p>The Jiugong family chose to send Jiugong Liangzi to study in Huaxiu this time.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling speculates that perhaps the Jiugong family's true purpose is to use Jiugong Liangzi to open up the Jiugong family's exorcism market in Huaxiu?</p>

    <p>Of course. This is just the analysis of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Before meeting this Jiugong Liangzi, everything is unknown.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling hope. This girl had better not be assigned to the same class as me...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The first class this morning was a math class. However, Teacher Pan entered the classroom ten minutes before class: "Dear students, starting from today, our class will have a new math teacher. Teacher Huo. At the same time, Teacher Huo is also the new vice principal of our Number 60 High School. Everyone welcomes him with applause!"</p>

    <p>After a burst of fierce applause, a handsome young man wearing a suit and thick hair stepped into the classroom.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling almost choked on her saliva when she saw this familiar face...</p>

    <p>Zhenyuan and Gu Shunzhi were also stunned.</p>

    <p>"What is going on?" Zhenyuan asked Gu Shunzhi via message.</p>

    <p>"I think I heard before that senior Jin Deng wanted to come to Number 60 High School. But I didn't expect that he would come directly to be the leader." Gu Shunzhi smiled bitterly.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Jin Deng glanced around and used his peripheral vision to secretly communicate with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>As if saying to Wang Ling: Ling Zhenren! Surprise, not surprise. Unexpected, not unexpected! Stinging, not exciting!</p>

    <p>It made Wang Ling want to flip the table on the spot...</p>

    <p>God knows why a monk who couldn't even figure out functions would come to Number 60 High School to be the vice principal and also work part-time as his math teacher! --This is unscientific!</p>

    <p>And what makes Wang Ling want to complain even more is Monk Jin Deng's lush hair...</p>

    <p>This is real hair.</p>

    <p>Through King's Eyes. Wang Ling can be clearly seen. Monk Jin Deng's hair grows from the ring scars on the top of his head... This operation is really too magical. Wang Ling was removed on the spot. Stare blankly.</p>

    <p>"Hello, fellow students. The poor Taoist's name is Huo Ding." The monk said amiably.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling could hear it. Due to professional habits, he wanted to say "poor monk." But fortunately, his mind came back in time. He didn't overturn the situation directly because of the opening remarks.</p>

    <p>When applying for the job, Monk Jin Deng used his experience as a "Taoist priest" in one of his lifetimes to successfully disguise his identity.</p>

    <p>As for certificates and so on, just leave them all to the Office of Strategic Deception. And as for the issue of obtaining the teacher qualification certificate, there is also Zhuo Yi. It is not a problem to get the certificate in minutes.</p>

    <p>"Today is the first time that Teacher Huo Ding teaches you. Teacher Huo Ding is a very powerful practitioner. I hope that if you have any problems, you can avoid arrogance and impetuosity. Seize the opportunity! Concentrate on class. Don't be distracted!"</p>

    <p>After saying that, Teacher Pan glared at Wang Ling: "Wang Ling! It's you I'm talking about! I knew just now in the corridor that you were absent from your self-study studies!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "?"</p>

    <p>This situation is like the first day of school at Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan left a few words of awe and left...</p>

    <p>After everyone watched Teacher Pan find a devil and leave, Monk Jin Deng's face suddenly became tense.</p>

    <p>Because he saw that Chen Chao's body seemed to be emitting light...</p>

    <p>"Chen Chao. How do I feel? Your whole body seems to be shining?"</p>

    <p>Someone rubbed his eyes and thought he had seen it wrong.</p>

    <p>"Could it be that because of my arrival, the {old version of the Consecration Technique} that was planted before resonated?"</p>

    <p>The monk never expected that something unexpected would happen in his first class.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was also blessed by his body not long ago. However, he was using a new version of the blessing technique at that time. The bug of resonance luminescence has long been fixed.</p>

    <p>At this time, the monk secretly thought that something was wrong.</p>

    <p>Without saying a word, he hurriedly walked towards Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>There is no other way now.</p>

    <p>The monk can only use the new version of the consecration technique. Replace the old version...</p>
