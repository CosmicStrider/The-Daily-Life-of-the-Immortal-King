  <h1>Chapter 1737 is really similar to Wang Ling in a sense</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Ling Yue was taken aback. She had never expected that the little guy in front of her had such great power. She whipped her legs with this whip. It was called the Space Nine Continuous Whip. It looked like she only whipped one whip, but in fact it was a total of The nine whip legs are superimposed at the same time to form a huge force.</p>

    <p>Although it has not reached the full strength of Ling Yue, this output can still produce tens of millions of tons of power when combined.</p>

    <p>However, what Ling Yue never expected was that the little guy in front of her could easily catch the sword with his bare hands, jamming her slender and snow-white thighs to death the moment she fell!</p>

    <p>Not only was it stuck, but Ling Yue could also clearly feel that her own power was being resolved by the opponent...</p>

    <p>"Is this...Hua Jin?"</p>

    <p>Traditional Kung Fu focuses on transforming strength. But Wang Muyu's move obviously does not.</p>

    <p>Ling Yue suddenly thought of the Yin-Yang Dragon in the Dragon Clan. This was a high-ranking general in the Dragon Clan's combat power rankings. It was also called the Tai Chi Dragon.</p>

    <p>And Wang Muyu is actually fused with the Tai Chi dragon's genes.</p>

    <p>Ling Yue bit her back teeth and tried to pull her legs back. However, the little guy obviously didn't intend to let her go. She was stunned and couldn't pull out: "You little guy... let me go quickly!"</p>

    <p>"Humph! Just let it go!" Wang Muyu obviously hated Ling Yue. While pushing her away, he actually doubled the power that he had previously removed and returned it back. Ling Yue felt a strong sensation the moment she was released. A huge force like a torrent rushed towards her.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>At the critical moment, Wang Muyu only saw Ling Yue's figure flicker. The force hit her hard...Sun Rong saw her flying backwards, vomiting blood.</p>

    <p>"Mom, she moves so fast." Wang Muyu looked calm. Although Ling Yue's reaction was quick, he could still see clearly.</p>

    <p>At the moment when he returned his power and hit her body, Ling Yue used the power of space jump. She exchanged the position of her own body with a space double. She let the double bear the blow for her. Then she continued again. Afterwards, she transferred herself back to the battlefield.</p>

    <p>This kind of movement can be said to be done in one go. It flows smoothly.</p>

    <p>Obviously this was not the first time that Ling Yue used a space avatar to block a knife for herself. As someone who also had dragon space capabilities, Wang Muyu's expression looked very serious at this time.</p>

    <p>"Auntie, is this the ability of the space double to be used?" Wang Muyu asked.</p>

    <p>"How I use it has nothing to do with you!" Ling Yue's face turned as pale as pig liver. It was not because he was injured, but because she was purely angry with Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>Thinking of her as a charming female dragonborn, being called aunt by a child. This age difference made her shudder.</p>

    <p>"Substitute! You are the one who should work hard for me! I can use it however I want. It has nothing to do with you!" Ling Yue retorted.</p>

    <p>These space avatars around her have always been regarded as tool dragons by her. They have already formed a habit.</p>

    <p>"Auntie, this is your fault. The space double will also hurt."</p>

    <p>"Don't call me aunt! What do you, a young boy, know?"</p>

    <p>"Auntie, you should still be a virgin, right?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Muyu asked again. Sun Rong and Wang Ming who were listening to this question almost choked.</p>

    <p>Because he has the Moonlight Dragon gene, Wang Muyu also has a lot of insight into the physiological structure of the dragon clan. He also has the ability to tell whether the opponent is a virgin dragon at a glance...</p>

    <p>"You're so old and you still don't have a boyfriend. How pitiful. You're already an aunt. Haven't you opened your shop yet?" Wang Muyu said.</p>

    <p>These words were not meant for Ling Yue. They were Wang Muyu's sincere greetings from the bottom of his heart. He felt that Ling Yue was really pitiful.</p>

    <p>However, to Ling Yue, these greetings were nothing more than a soul-crushing blow from deep within her soul.</p>

    <p>"Today, I must take you back, little thing! Imprison you!" She was furious. Her face turned blue. Wang Muyu's words hurt her. All she wanted in her mind was to catch Wang Muyu and ravage him severely.</p>

    <p>The next moment, Ling Yue's figure changed again. A silver ball appeared in the void.</p>

    <p>This is Ling Yue's Dragonborn exclusive magic weapon: the element-eating ball! The sequence level has reached level 3!</p>

    <p>"Mom and uncle, be careful! This aunt is very likely to hit someone with the ball!" Wang Muyu's eyes instantly became alert. The element-devouring ball is elusive. It can appear in any space and direction.</p>

    <p>One of the most tortured methods is to move the element-eating ball into the human body. Then let the element-eating ball explode directly in the human body.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu is well aware of the characteristics of the Yuan-devouring Ball. Therefore, he was on guard the moment the Yuan-devouring Ball appeared.</p>

    <p>The next moment, his expression became serious. There was a buzz!</p>

    <p>An energy was like a sea, spreading out in all directions like a tide. With Wang Muyu as the center, the entire sky-level laboratory was shaking. It soon spread to places outside the laboratory.</p>

    <p>Ling Yue's expression changed in shock. She never expected that Wang Muyu's spiritual energy could continue to surge.</p>

    <p>Soon, a scene that shocked her even more happened. She found that the element-devouring ball in her hand was completely out of control!</p>

    <p>It didn't listen to her orders at all. It was as if another force had intervened and forcibly reversed the situation. This was the first time such a thing had happened, leaving Ling Yue a little at a loss.</p>

    <p>"What's going on???" She had questions all over her face. The fact that the magic weapon was out of control made her instantly feel panicked.</p>

    <p>However, before she could react, a burst of explosions like firecrackers suddenly sounded in her mind. Countless spiritual links were broken.</p>

    <p>She actually felt that the countless space substitutes she had established were completely disconnected from herself.</p>

    <p>Each of these substitutes lost contact with her.</p>

    <p>What is going on?</p>

    <p>She was puzzled.</p>

    <p>Then in the next second, one of the space avatars walked up to her in two or three steps: "You Bitch. I have tolerated you for a long time!"</p>

    <p>Then!</p>

    <p>Snap! There's a bang!</p>

    <p>A slap on Ling Yue's face...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>This huge amount of spiritual energy was captured by Wang Ling and others at the same time. This made Wang Ling frown slightly.</p>

    <p>"Very strong spiritual power." Wang Ying also looked serious: "Except for me, the leader and Nuan, among all the opponents we have encountered so far, no one can burst out such a powerful spiritual power. If this person is not a friend, will be a formidable enemy."</p>

    <p>"But I don't feel any malice from this spiritual energy." Death Heavenly Dao said.</p>

    <p>"The strong can restrain their murderous intent. This is not uncommon."</p>

    <p>"But the dragonborn's aura is mixed. It seems strange."</p>

    <p>"Could it be a dragonborn that combines multiple genes?" Wang Ying smiled: "We'll see how it goes. He's an interesting guy. I think he might be able to make it work."</p>

    <p>At this time, only Wang Ling remained silent.</p>

    <p>Because he has already peeked at the screen.</p>

    <p>And staring at Wang Muyu's face, he began to doubt my life...</p>
