  <h1>Chapter 1835 Weird Twins</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Chen Qin knew that she had nothing that could be used as a benefit. The student party was still very poor. In addition, the target was the eldest lady of the Huaguo Shuilian Group. No matter how much money she gave, wouldn't the other party look down on her?</p>

    <p>So before coming to the student union, she specifically asked the opinions of several other classmates. In the end, she came to the conclusion that she could use the privileges of the canteen to seduce with snacks... When Chen Chao told Chen Qin about this, she still finds it incredible. How could a dignified lady from the Huaguo Shuilian Group be interested in those snacks in the canteen?</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly. The effect is outstanding.</p>

    <p>The first step was finally accomplished. Because her request was very strange. The key was whether she could successfully convey it to the leader of Gray Cult to help her with this favor.</p>

    <p>While thinking about it, Chen Qin took out her mobile phone. She opened the photo album and looked at the screenshots inside.</p>

    <p>It was a screenshot of a short video. In the video was a girl who also wore glasses and had a long ponytail. Sun Rong distinguished it carefully. Then compared it with Chen Qin's appearance. Finally, she showed a suspicious look: " This should...not be you, right?"</p>

    <p>Chen Qin became excited: "Yes! But do you think we look a lot alike?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong nodded: "You are indeed very similar! You are almost twins!"</p>

    <p>Chen Qin: "I suddenly discovered this on a short video platform a week ago. I felt very surprised at the time. I didn't expect that there are people who look exactly like me in this world..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong nodded. She immediately understood what Chen Qin meant: "So you want to find her?"</p>

    <p>Chen Qin: "I asked my parents if they had any younger sisters besides me. But they scolded me... They said I was an only child."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong sighed: "After all, the probability of meeting someone who looks almost exactly like you through short videos and who is a long-lost biological sister is really very low."</p>

    <p>"But I still want to find her..."</p>

    <p>Chen Qin said reluctantly: "On the one hand, I want to satisfy my curiosity. On the other hand... I really have a feeling. I think this girl may have something to do with me."</p>

    <p>"Well. It seems that she is about the same age as you. So you think the other person may also be a student. So you want to use Gray Cult's influence among major schools to find this person, right?" At this point. Sun Rong suddenly understood everything. But there was one more thing that made Sun Rong not think through. She felt that Chen Qin did not tell all the reasons.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Chen Qin, if you sincerely want me to go to Master Gray Cult to help with this, it's best to tell the whole story without reservation."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong said: "I feel like you are hiding something."</p>

    <p>These words caused Chen Qin to fall into silence for a while.</p>

    <p>After the scene was silent for a while, she hesitantly opened a short video software and entered the search box according to the name on the screenshot just now.</p>

    <p>This scene was seen by Sun Rong and Wang Ling at the same time.</p>

    <p>When Chen Qin pressed the OK button, something strange happened.</p>

    <p>The short video software immediately popped up a system prompt of "No such person found."</p>

    <p>"Did she change your name?" Wang Ling asked.</p>

    <p>"If you just change the name, the user's UID will not change." Chen Qin immediately replied: "But I entered the UID... and I can't find her."</p>

    <p>"Does that mean she logged out?" Sun Rong was also confused.</p>

    <p>"I don't think she will log out. I have been observing her for several days. The main video she posts on short videos is mukbang. And it is very regular. Every night around 6 o'clock, she posts a video of herself eating delicious food. No. It's a waste. There's no harmful content. It's definitely not the platform that deleted her."</p>

    <p>The more Chen Qin talked, the more serious her expression became: "Just the day before I couldn't find her account, she said she would see her at six o'clock tomorrow night. Although there are not many fans who follow her, she is a good person. What do you think? Are you going to say it's gone?"</p>

    <p>The whole thing does give off a very weird feeling.</p>

    <p>After listening, Wang Ling and Sun Rong looked at each other for a while.</p>

    <p>Then Sun Rong nodded seriously. Looking at Chen Qin: "So, student Chen Qin, I understand your request. I will try to relay to the leader of Gray Cult. If there is any new situation in the future, I will follow you up."</p>

    <p>"Well! Thank you so much! No matter what happens in the end, I will pay the agreed commission fee!" Chen Qin said.</p>

    <p>The commission fee and so on are not a big problem.</p>

    <p>The main reason is that there is something very wrong about the incident itself.</p>

    <p>Not just Sun Rong. Even Wang Ling was aroused with a trace of curiosity. He noticed that something was wrong here.</p>

    <p>If it is what Chen Qin said, it is indeed a bit strange for such a living person to suddenly cancel their account. In addition, this person may have some kind of connection with Chen Qin. It is normal for Chen Qin to have concerns. It's like watching another self in the same world suddenly disappear... perhaps out of an instinctive reaction. A kind of worry will naturally arise.</p>

    <p>But then again. This is the first time that Sun Rong has taken the initiative to entrust a real incident from the student party. Even Sun Rong herself is not sure how things will develop in the end.</p>

    <p>For now, she just has to do her best.</p>

    <p>The Gray Cult branch of Jiudaohe High School soon received a joint investigation invitation from Sun Rong. Jisaki, the head of the Jiudaohe Gray Cult branch, has an IT elite like Ma Jiao around him, which greatly promotes the investigation.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's idea is very clear. She plans to let Ma Jiao start with the short video software to see what's going on.</p>

    <p>In less than ten minutes, news came from Ma Jiao.</p>

    <p>The result surprised Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Because according to Ma Jiao's investigation, the short video software has been invaded by hackers before, and the other party's goal is very clear. It is to directly delete the account of the girl who looks very similar to Chen Qin.</p>

    <p>This is a deliberate act. But if ordinary people encounter this situation, there is nothing they can do. It can only be understood as an official account ban. But in fact, this has nothing to do with the official account.</p>

    <p>"Invading a short video software just to delete a little girl's account?" Sun Rong frowned after receiving the news. She felt that things were far from being as simple as they seemed.</p>

    <p>Now she wants to find out the truth of the matter. The only way is to find the location of the girl. But because the account information has been deleted, there is no way to find out.</p>

    <p>The only breakthrough was the unknown hacker who hacked into the short video software.</p>

    <p>However, it is impossible to investigate this person with the means currently available to Ma Jiao.</p>

    <p>"Can I entrust Brother Wang Ming?" At this time, Sun Rong looked at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Yeah." Wang Ling nodded. He and Sun Rong thought of going together.</p>
