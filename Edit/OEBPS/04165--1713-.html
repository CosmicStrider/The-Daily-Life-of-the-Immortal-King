  <h1>Chapter 1713 A simple and crude identification method!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"I didn't expect that Brother Xiang Yi's Nine Sun Divine Sword actually has a pistol version." Qin Zhong said in surprise.</p>

    <p>"Times have changed. You always need to prepare more." Xiang Yi wiped the Nine Sun Divine Sword (pistol version) on his hand. He smiled and said: "In addition to the pistol version, I also have the assault rifle, shotgun, assault rifle, and gatling versions. These guns are made from the same material as the main sniper, but they don't have the same range or intelligence as the main sniper, so there are pros and cons to each."</p>

    <p>It can be seen that the power of Xiang Yi's Nine Sun Divine Sword is indeed amazing. Needless to say, the power of the main sniper. But the pistol version alone can directly kill Gu Shunzhi with a headshot. This is already very incredible.</p>

    <p>After all, Gu Shunzhi is also an orderly person assigned by Heavenly Dao. Who knew he would be so disrespectful.</p>

    <p>It can only be said that Gu Shunzhi is not strong enough at this stage. Secondly, the thought plague lurking in Gu Shunzhi's body thinks he is well disguised and has no defense against them.</p>

    <p>"I can't believe you're here today."</p>

    <p>Looking at the scene of Gu Shunzhi crawling up from the ground with his head covered, Qin Zhong couldn't help but laugh secretly, he came to this timeline when Gu Shunzhi hadn't been assigned to his universe yet.</p>

    <p>He got up from the ground and cast a spell to calm his thoughts. At a glance, Gu Shunzhi saw Xiang Yi, Qin Zhong and the green Er Ha standing in front of him.</p>

    <p>"Brother Gu, you have been tricked." Er Ha said.</p>

    <p>It put the dog's paw on Gu Shunzhi's shoulder. In an instant, Gu Shunzhi knew everything that was happening.</p>

    <p>"I was not careful."</p>

    <p>He sighed. Then he looked at Xiang Yi and Qin Zhong in front of him.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi knew the origins of the two of them, especially the origins of Qin Zhong. He had already figured it out clearly.</p>

    <p>But who would have thought that a future subject of his training would actually return to the previous world line to look back at his own joke, which makes Gu Shunzhi's heart slightly unhappy, but he did not directly show it, now the enemy in front of the guns are unanimously outside.</p>

    <p>As for other matters, we can only settle the accounts later.</p>

    <p>Oh...</p>

    <p>After he receives the mission to go to the tenth universe, he must let Qin Zhong see what Heavenly Dao means...</p>

    <p>"I've met you all."</p>

    <p>He bowed and then took the initiative to extend his hand. Xiang Yi was enthusiastic and quickly stepped forward to shake it.</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong turned his attention, pretended that he hadn't seen it. He chatted with Er Ha about the Thought Plague: "I didn't expect that the Thought Plague could even invade the Order easily. The situation looks very strange."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi's mouth twitched when he heard these words. He took back the hand he planned to hold with Qin Zhong.</p>

    <p>Although it sounds like there is nothing wrong with it, Gu Shunzhi feels that there is something strange about it.</p>

    <p>Such a needle-point confrontation could only make Er Ha sweat a little: "After all, it is a link in the Old Dominator system. An eternal creature. It is not surprising to have such an ability. The top priority now is to confirm the identity. The personnel are too scattered now." If we check them one by one, we may not have enough time."</p>

    <p>After saying this, everyone at the scene fell silent for a moment.</p>

    <p>"I have an idea." Gu Shunzhi said at this time: "It's possible. It's a little violent."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "What can I do?"</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi: "Send an announcement. Invite all core members of the Office of Strategic Deception here."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Meet here?"</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi: "Then enter the door and kill them with one shot."</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong: "..."</p>

    <p>I have to say that in Qin Zhong's opinion, this method is very consistent with Gu Shunzhi's style.</p>

    <p>Anyway, it has something to do with the existence of the death talisman. These people with the thought plague will never react when faced with a sudden attack. The specific treatment method can imitate the way he fell in a pool of blood before. Because the host's body dies. The mind plague person It will also wither. After withering, the death talisman can just activate the resurrection mechanism.</p>

    <p>Xiang Yi trembled when he heard this: "So Senior Gu wants me to offend the entire Office of Strategic Deception by myself..."</p>

    <p>He is just a new guest. He has just joined the Office of Strategic Deception a few days ago. He is about to blow everyone's head... He is not a devil...</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi: "Brother Xiang's words are wrong. Special times naturally require special treatment. I believe that other brothers in the Office of Strategic Deception will not blame Brother Xiang if they know what happened. It is just a reset of the core members of the Office of Strategic Deception for everyone. It's just work."</p>

    <p>Xiang Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. No matter how he listens to it, he feels a bit unreliable...</p>

    <p>At this time, Er Ha seemed to have thought of something: "Speaking of which, I remember whether the Nine Sun Divine Sword has the ability to automatically lock the enemy's headshot remotely?"</p>

    <p>Xiang Yi had a bad feeling: "Yes, yes. Just provide relevant photos..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "That would be better. If this method is used, it is better to shoot the head directly remotely. If everyone is gathered together to open the door to kill. I think it may make them wary. In case of this Someone among us has been invaded. I'm afraid the plan will be exposed directly."</p>

    <p>"Is this really going to happen..." Xiang Yi was still a little scared.</p>

    <p>"The situation is urgent. If we check one by one, the efficiency will be too low." Er Ha sighed. Half floating in the air, he patted Xiang Yi on the shoulder and said, "The next step will be left to you, Brother Xiang."</p>

    <p>Xiang Yi: "But I need their photos..."</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi immediately said: "The archives at the backend of the Office of Strategic Deception contain one-inch and two-inch ID photos of all core members, including their profile photos."</p>

    <p>Er Ha nodded: "Then please prepare this assassination list."</p>

    <p>Xiang Yi: "???"</p>

    <p>God, their assassination list!</p>

    <p>Sure enough, he still told the truth!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, the goals of Wang Ling, Wang Ying, and Heavenly Dao are also very clear. After deciding to use the remaining scapegoats from the last time to all the people in the Office of Strategic Deception as insurance, He also immediately set out to search for the little girl Chen Xiaomu who was invaded by the Thought Plague.</p>

    <p>According to Wang Ling's judgment, the thought plaguer in Chen Xiaomu's body should be a mother body. Or an important component related to the mother body. At least it was separated from the first wave of the mother body.</p>

    <p>If we could find Chen Xiaomu, we might be able to follow the clues and directly find traces of the mother's body.</p>

    <p>Because of the relationship between Chen Xiaomu's parents who were resurrected before. Wang Ling took advantage of the two of them not paying attention and pulled out a hair of each of them. The two hairs were genetically compared through the "Big Blood Source Technique." Then Carry out genetic tracking.</p>

    <p>Soon, Chen Xiaomu's coordinates converged into a flashing red dot in the huge universe map in Wang Ling's mind, and continued to expand inside.</p>

    <p>According to the intelligence information provided by the hospital, Chen Xiaomu disappeared after being sent to the hospital together.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought that the thought plaguer who had invaded Chen Xiaomu's body would go to Baobai Group to report the situation.</p>

    <p>But the moment the positioning coordinates in my mind gradually became clear.</p>

    <p>His spirit suddenly froze.</p>

    <p>"This coordinate..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling whispered in a low voice. Death Heavenly Dao happened to hear: "Ling Zhenren. What's wrong with the coordinates?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ying, who was holding his arms beside him, also frowned: "This coordinate is at Miss Rong's villa. But I can't figure it out. After it invaded Chen Xiaomu's body, what did it do there?"</p>
