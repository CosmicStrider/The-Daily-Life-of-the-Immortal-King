  <h1>Chapter 1899 Assassination of Novelist</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This precise headbutt made Jingze feel the pain of breaking his lower limbs. It was like the sky was falling out of control. He never thought that he would be dealt with so tragically by a baby.</p>

    <p>"Boom!"</p>

    <p>Endless black runes of the Shadow Lord's Path emerged from Wang Nuan's body. As the founder of this path, her small body showed endless divine power. She was like a god of war.</p>

    <p>Without using any other spells at all. The physical strength combined with the Shadow Lord's coat has already made Jingze, the dragonborn arranged on the head, unable to withstand it.</p>

    <p>"Bang! Bang!"</p>

    <p>There were two loud noises again. Wang Nuan kicked out. The moment the kick flew away, he moved again.</p>

    <p>Leng Ming took her. The speed was unbelievable. After Jingze moved to the next coordinate point, Leng Ming and the little girl accurately predicted the location of Jingze's landing point. They arrived early. Then they were solid again. He kicked Jingze on the spine.</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe couldn't believe his eyes. Wang Nuan's growth is so terrifying! In a sense, it may be even more amazing than Wang Ling when he was born...</p>

    <p>A little girl. Why is she so strong!?</p>

    <p>He couldn't believe it.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan's kick could be described as merciless. It directly broke Jingze's backbone. The sound of Jingze's backbone being broken could be heard clearly at the scene. He flew away and was beaten with blood all over his body.</p>

    <p>"Hey!" Wang Nuan said.</p>

    <p>Leng Ming brought his own simultaneous interpreter. He translated on the side: "My sword master said, you are too weak. You are still a dragonborn with a head. It is too embarrassing. And you will find that the Eternal Moon's Armor on you can't afford it." It worked. That's because my sword master used the Shadow ability to cover up this layer of eternal moon starlight."</p>

    <p>"Cough..." Jingze lay on the ground and coughed up blood. He had put on a mask of pain. His face was distorted.</p>

    <p>I really can't figure out why just two words "Ei ya" can be translated into so many things.</p>

    <p>"Eaaah!"</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Nuan ordered again.</p>

    <p>Leng Ming understood. Without saying a word, he stepped on Jingze's broken dragon spine: "Be honest. My sword master wants to borrow something from you!"</p>

    <p>After saying that, he reached in directly. The fingertip turned into a piece of soft grass the moment it fell. Then he completely cut Jingze's back along the spine.</p>

    <p>Leng Ming was skilled in the operation. He took out a jade bottle and collected as much of Jingze's dragon's spine blood into the jade bottle as possible.</p>

    <p>This time Wang Nuan did not bring her original mount SCB-096 out.</p>

    <p>The little girl thought that her lovely rabbit was still waiting at home. The idea suddenly came to her mind. Jingze was a little weak, but dragon's spine blood was a good supplement.</p>

    <p>It's perfect for a late night snack.</p>

    <p>Besides, SCB-096 still has a lot of room for growth. It still needs to develop. Dragon's spine blood is suitable as a supplement.</p>

    <p>The corner of Jingze's mouth twitched. He lay on the ground with a face full of pain and could not move. He was allowed to be slaughtered by Wang Nuan and Leng Ming. He, a dragonborn, had to suffer such humiliation twice for no reason!</p>

    <p>Last time he was taught a lesson by Wang Ling! But this time he was taught a lesson by Wang Nuan!</p>

    <p>These Wang brothers and sisters are so scary!</p>

    <p>Jingze found that he couldn't afford to offend him at all!</p>

    <p>"Girl, you had fun beating me... Have you ever thought about the fire in your house?" At this time, Jingze sneered. He knew that he would not die. Even if the mission failed this time, Wang Muyu could not be killed. Take him back. But in fact, distracting Wang Ling and taking Wang Muyu away. That is only the second level of the entire plan.</p>

    <p>If you go one floor further inside, they actually arranged for another group of people to be sent directly to the Wang family's small villa.</p>

    <p>There is no other purpose. It is to assassinate the novelist!</p>

    <p>Both Father Wang and Mother Wang have actually been included in Bai Zhe's purge list.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen failed to attack the Wang family last time. But this time without Wang Ling, Bai Zhe feels that there is a great chance of success!</p>

    <p>And the key is. This most powerful little girl is also in the core world now.</p>

    <p>With Jingze and him watching from behind. Ah Nuan girl couldn't get away. This time the assassination of Bai Zhe felt that there was a high chance of success!...</p>

    <p>On the other side, inside the Wang family's small villa, there was actually an atmosphere of anxiety.</p>

    <p>Both daughter and son are not around. Father Wang and Mother Wang appear calm on the surface, but in fact they are still very worried. It is not because of Wang Nuan's strength that they are worried about everything.</p>

    <p>After all, Ah Nuan girl was only born a few months ago. She was actually sent to maintain the peace of the earth. Even Father Wang felt that he could not write such a bloody plot.</p>

    <p>So the current situation is that Old Wang and his wife are waiting at home. No one in the family can even eat well.</p>

    <p>Father Wang's food was tasteless. He had to sit in front of the computer and smoke. He held the keyboard with his fingertips. He pondered for a long time and couldn't write even a word.</p>

    <p>"It seems that the only option is to use the archives..." Father Wang held his chin and thought. He was extremely irritated. He smoked several cigarettes in a row and couldn't calm down. He looked at the editor's QQ avatar that kept jumping. Father Wang finally opened the door with a sudden heart. He directly sent the document to the editor using an offline file.</p>

    <p>"Stop rushing! I've delivered the goods! All my underwear is gone!" Father Wang typed.</p>

    <p>On the other side of the computer screen, Lie Mengmeng, the editor-in-chief, was a little confused: "What? Did you give me the entire manuscript library?"</p>

    <p>Father Wang was very irritated: "Yes! You are satisfied now!"</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng was stunned. He could see that Father Wang seemed to be in a bad mood, so he asked weakly: "Sorry... I don't seem to have received it yet..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang replied directly: "The word is very big. Please bear with it!"</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng: "..."</p>

    <p>Waiting for the offline file to be transferred with a confused look on her face. Lie Mengmeng was also thinking about what happened to Father Wang.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he was also thinking about the involution of online article writers these days. He was also reflecting on whether the pressure he usually put on him to push for updates was indeed too great.</p>

    <p>After all, the original author of the online article was Zhou Geng. Then it came to the era of 2,000 updates per day. It slowly developed to 4,000, 6,000, 8,000, and now the most outrageous era of 20,000 and more.</p>

    <p>"It's really too curly."</p>

    <p>Lie Mengmeng sighed. He felt that as an editor, he should also care about the health of his authors appropriately. He planned to find time to go to the Wang family villa to see how Father Wang was doing.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Father Wang was fully armed. He was extremely worried about Wang Nuan's safety, so he and Mother Wang put on the latest enlightened version of thermal underwear left by Wang Ling. He called several powerful enlightenment spirits at home and turned them into human forms. A group of people were preparing to set off from the villa with great vigor.</p>

    <p>As a result, at this moment, a cute and playful little girl appeared outside the door of the Wang family's small villa. She had a popsicle in her mouth. She looked as cute as a doll.</p>

    <p>"Protect the lord!" Lord Ma immediately judged that something was wrong and blocked Father Wang and Mother Wang behind him.</p>

    <p>He could feel that the girl in front of him was also a dragonborn!</p>

    <p>And the level is not low!</p>
