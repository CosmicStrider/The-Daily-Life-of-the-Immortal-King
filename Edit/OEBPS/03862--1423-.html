  <h1>Chapter 1423 High energy warning. Summon the dubbing lady</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was expected that Leng Ming would win this battle.</p>

    <p>Next, we are waiting for the showdown between the champions.</p>

    <p>Because it is the finale. There is also a showdown between the silver, gold and diamond groups.</p>

    <p>In addition, the time for cleaning up the competition venue should also be taken into account. Sun Ying'er estimates that Sun Rong will take the field at least 2-3 hours later.</p>

    <p>Since I'm bored, of course I need to find some fun.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er's eyes rolled wildly. She thought of a good way to tease Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"Rongrong. I don't know if you noticed it or not." She carefully said as if blowing into Sun Rong's ear.</p>

    <p>The blow made Sun Rong's face feel hot. Goosebumps appeared all over his body: "Ying'er...what are you doing..."</p>

    <p>"Eh? Haven't you noticed it yet?" Sun Ying'er whispered in her ear: "Ling Zhenren. It's in Room 2, Tianzi next door."</p>

    <p>In fact, Sun Ying'er didn't feel Wang Ling's aura at all.</p>

    <p>But...</p>

    <p>She could feel Wang Ying's.</p>

    <p>It's not that Wang Ying gave away his aura.</p>

    <p>But after being trained by Wang Ying for a long time, Sun Ying'er will develop a habitual muscle reflex.</p>

    <p>Because my wrist is often grabbed by the gorilla Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>This resulted in Sun Ying'er's current wrist being like a radar instrument detecting Wang Ying. As long as she was close to Wang Ying, her wrist would feel like someone was holding it...</p>

    <p>And the closer you get, the stronger the feeling of restraint around your wrists becomes.</p>

    <p>During the bronze group duel, Sun Ying'er tentatively walked back and forth in the room, and finally discovered the source of the signal.</p>

    <p>Confirmed that Wang Ying is next door.</p>

    <p>Since Wang Ying is next door, I guess Wang Ling must be here too.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling. is here too?"</p>

    <p>After hearing the news, the expression on Sun Rong's face showed a bit of surprise.</p>

    <p>Although she knows it very well. With Wang Ling's personality, there is a high probability that she will choose to peek at the screen at home during her competition.</p>

    <p>But I was able to come to watch the game.</p>

    <p>For Sun Rong, this is definitely an extra surprise.</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. The girl suddenly felt that she was in a good mood. The previous nervousness was instantly wiped away. No feeling of nervousness at all was gone.</p>

    <p>The existence of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Make her feel at ease.</p>

    <p>"Rongrong, why don't you go next door and say hello?" Sun Ying'er chuckled and began to encourage the girl to take active actions.</p>

    <p>"I...I haven't thought about what to say yet..." Sun Rong blushed and started to feel hot again: "Besides, classmate Wang Ling is obviously next door. If he doesn't come over, that's the case. Don't you want to interfere with my game? If I go, will it disturb him?"</p>

    <p>"It doesn't matter. What do you want to say? Just tell me! I can pass the message for you! You don't have to go there!" Sun Ying'er's expression looked a little treacherous.</p>

    <p>--Hmph! Ying'er brand human flesh microphone. Activate!</p>

    <p>"Is this okay..." Sun Rong finished. He glanced at Wu Jin and Lao Man next to him. They were watching the game in Sun Rong's Tianzihao room.</p>

    <p>It's not like I stayed here on purpose.</p>

    <p>In fact, it was Jiu You who asked them to stay here.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, it can provide Sun Rong with better commentary on the game. On the other hand, it can also serve as Sun Rong's guard.</p>

    <p>I have to say. Wu Jin and Lao Man are both sensible people.</p>

    <p>After they heard Sun Rong's words, they consciously reached out and covered their ears...</p>

    <p>Don't listen to anything inappropriate.</p>

    <p>They won't get involved in the couple's affairs.</p>

    <p>And knowing too much is not good for them either.</p>

    <p>In addition, Wufei and Lao Man also think that this is the best way to prevent the attack of puppy loves.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong hesitated for a while. Then he turned to Sun Ying'er and said, "Then... just say hello to me."</p>

    <p>"No! This is too simple! Don't you have anything special to ask?" Sun Ying'er touched his chin and said, "For example, the Rubik's Cube task? Rongrong, didn't you always say you were worried before? You felt that the collection process was too smooth. Bad things are going to happen."</p>

    <p>"That's right...but I can't tell what's wrong. It's just my sixth sense..."</p>

    <p>The girl looked troubled: "And if you ask too many questions at once, classmate Wang Ling will also feel uncomfortable."</p>

    <p>"Then let's ask a simple question. For example, tell me what you think of Jiang Yingying. It's best if you can write down your thoughts in no less than 800 words."</p>

    <p>"What are you thinking Ying'er..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong smiled bitterly: "Classmate Wang Ling can only give six points on the composition."</p>

    <p>"That's right." Sun Ying'er nodded.</p>

    <p>"Let's do this. Say hello to me first. Then ask my classmate Wang Ling... I want to ask him to go to the ancient street this weekend. Ask him if he is free."Sun RongGather up your courage and say to Sun Ying'er.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, the opportunity is in your own hands!</p>

    <p>She has to take the initiative!</p>

    <p>"Okay!" Sun Ying'er nodded.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong added: "Tell your classmate Wang Ling that just the two of us going...it won't be the same as the last time we went to the Xiao Family Courtyard. There will be a bunch of people following us."</p>

    <p>The main reason is that now Sun Rong does not need to consider security issues.</p>

    <p>If she could still encounter a killer organization like Shadow Stream, hired by a competitor of the Huaguo Shuilian Group, she could handle it all by herself.</p>

    <p>"No problem!" Then Sun Ying'er agreed and turned into a ball of shadow and slipped out.</p>

    <p>But in fact, how dare she really enter Wang Ling's room.</p>

    <p>I just pretended to be lingering at the door. Then I made up a reply...</p>

    <p>Soon, Sun Ying'er returned to Sun Rong: "Ah! I asked! Ling Zhenren said. He can go! He's free!"</p>

    <p>"Really?" Sun Rong's eyes lit up.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er has never seen such a happy expression on a young girl. For a moment, she suddenly felt a little guilty: "Really...really..."</p>

    <p>"No. Ying'er! Did you not ask at all?" Fortunately, Sun Rong quickly noticed something wrong on Sun Ying'er's face.</p>

    <p>Anyway, this is not the first time that this girl has been exposed.</p>

    <p>Based on her understanding of Sun Ying'er, there is a high probability that this may be Sun Ying'er's own answer.</p>

    <p>If you really ask, where can I come back so soon...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong touched Sun Ying'er's head. The expression on his face was very gentle: "Ying'er. Since you asked, just ask carefully. I don't blame you."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er was silent for a while. She pursed her lips and said weakly: "Then...I really went. If you are rejected, don't blame me!"</p>

    <p>"Yeah. I won't blame you." Sun Rong nodded.</p>

    <p>"good!"</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er realized that she originally just wanted to tease Sun Rong. But now she seemed to have tricked herself into it.</p>

    <p>This is a hole she dug herself. She has to jump into it even with tears in her eyes.</p>

    <p>She was extremely nervous. She lingered at the door of Tianzi Number 2. The feeling of being restrained on her wrists became stronger and stronger.</p>

    <p>After struggling for a few minutes, Sun Ying'er gritted his teeth and said, "Forget it! For Rongrong's happiness, I'll risk it all!"</p>

    <p>She was just about to turn into a shadow and rush into the door.</p>

    <p>The next moment, he was lifted up by a force.</p>

    <p>When Sun Ying'er came to her senses, she saw Wang Ying grabbing her wrist and pushing her against the wooden wall of the inn.</p>

    <p>"What do you want to do again?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ying looked at her with amusement in his eyes: "Your Majesty is watching the game. No one is allowed to interrupt."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er's eyes filled with tears: "I...I just want to ask..."</p>

    <p>"No."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying said two words coldly.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er was annoyed: "I don't care where you go! If I had to ask!"</p>

    <p>"I said, no." Wang Ying still maintained his attitude.</p>

    <p>"Then I'll shout! Ling Zhenren will definitely hear you!" Sun Ying'er's resistance came back.</p>

    <p>"You can try." Wang Ying sneered.</p>

    <p>"Just try it!"</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er snorted.</p>

    <p>She was just about to open her mouth.</p>

    <p>But at the next moment.</p>

    <p>She suddenly felt Wang Ying's breath approaching her eyes. He quickly blocked her mouth with his domineering lips...</p>
