  <h1>Chapter 1908 The power from the old world</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Something was wrong. Peng Beicen's condition was very wrong. Her body became slender under the surge of energy in her body. The bulging veins were clearly imprinted on the surface of the skin.</p>

    <p>She is obviously such a beautiful girl. Under the influence of the power of the old world, even her appearance has undergone tremendous changes.</p>

    <p>The white robe on her body was completely torn. Her lower limbs turned into a string of indescribable slender purple tentacles, rolling outward. From a distance, it looked like the hem of a skirt in the dark night. It exuded a terrifying aura.</p>

    <p>"How could..."</p>

    <p>This was a scene that no one at the scene expected except Peng Xiren. The power of the Old World was too terrifying. As a human cultivator, Peng Beicen's genes were directly modified. He became an Old World under the dark night. A witch. She has the blessing of external divine power in her body, and it explodes outward uncontrollably.</p>

    <p>The color of the sky has changed. The sky at dusk is covered with a layer of scarlet full of murder and terror. It is strange that people feel a strong sense of spiritual oppression.</p>

    <p>"Awesome! So beautiful! Beicen! My good sister!" Peng Xiren was delighted. Such a huge power blessing made him feel extremely excited. He looked at the monster that had become a monster with admiration in his eyes. Peng Beicen.</p>

    <p>To be honest, he never thought Peng Beicen was very beautiful. But now Peng Xiren feels that Peng Beicen is already a perfect human body art.</p>

    <p>"Protect Master!"</p>

    <p>Everyone at the Office of Strategic Deception saw this. The tacit understanding was abnormal. Monk Jin Deng, who played the role of Emperor Nan, took the initiative to pull Sun Rong back. Everyone worked together to form a magic circle. They protected Sun Rong on the surface, but secretly at the same time. A solid barrier was built to tightly wrap the entire Peng family headquarters.</p>

    <p>This is an extremely powerful psychic protective shield. It gathers the psychic powers of everyone in the Office of Strategic Deception. It is airtight.</p>

    <p>Although I don't know if I can deal with the alienated Peng Beicen's energy impact in the future, such protection is still necessary. At least it can buy the casual cultivators around me time to escape.</p>

    <p>Because outside the battlefield at this time, many experienced casual cultivators have realized the danger infiltrated from the Peng family's headquarters.</p>

    <p>"Something's wrong!"</p>

    <p>"Why did the energy in the Peng family's headquarters suddenly increase so much?"</p>

    <p>"It's just a competition. Is it necessary..."</p>

    <p>Throughout the ages, casual cultivators have always been very good at predicting crises. If there is danger, run away. Don't force yourself. This is a major strategy for stepping into the path of immortality.</p>

    <p>Try{mad1('gad2');} catch(ex){}There were a few casual cultivators who took the lead and ran away. These people who were joining in the fun and watching quickly dispersed. They didn't dare to stay here at all.</p>

    <p>Only the core members of the Office of Strategic Deception still played their respective roles and stayed at the scene to watch.</p>

    <p>Even the manager of the Peng family was shocked. Peng Beicen's rampage was something he didn't expect. What made him even more unexpected was the servants brought by Mr. "Wang Rongxia" who came to get married...</p>

    <p>If he read it correctly, these servants had just teamed up to set up an extremely thick barrier-type barrier, directly wrapping the entire Peng family headquarters tightly. This was definitely not something that ordinary servants could do.</p>

    <p>"You...what on earth are..." the manager of the Peng family asked in astonishment.</p>

    <p>"Be quiet. Can't you see? Your young lady is in danger now. Our master's strongest servant is saving her." Xiang Yi, who plays Emperor Xi, said.</p>

    <p>In his original world, there were also records of battles with old Japanese creatures.</p>

    <p>One win, one draw... This always made Xiang Yi feel deeply resentful towards such creatures. This time he had such an opportunity to observe up close. He felt that it was also a perfect opportunity to learn from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The manager of the Peng family was speechless for a moment.</p>

    <p>Indeed. The situation in front of him is no longer under his control.</p>

    <p>The moment he saw Peng Beicen running away, he hoped that Peng Xiren would appear.</p>

    <p>However, for such an unexpected situation, no one in the Peng family responded at this time. The Peng family's headquarters has worked for the Peng family for many years. He figured out the stakes here almost instantly...knowing all this. Maybe it's all Peng Xiren's benefit.</p>

    <p>But why is this?</p>

    <p>Obviously Peng Beicen... is his sister...and also his biological sister...</p>

    <p>At this time, the manager of the Peng family frowned deeply and stared at the sky crushed by darkness. Now the entire Peng family palace was sealed. The powerful power from the old world seemed to be able to control everything here. Everything was destroyed. All covered. Isolated from the world.</p>

    <p>It can be seen that Peng Beicen gained tremendous strength under the influence of the insect cyst. However, at the same time, she also suffered endless pain.</p>

    <p>With Peng Beicen as the center, the energy that was released wantonly stirred the void, crushed everything, and swallowed up the nearby space.</p>

    <p>It is a power of annihilation. Everything close to it will be disintegrated in an instant.</p>

    <p>Heavenly Ancestor triple!</p>

    <p>In less than three minutes, her realm has transcended from the original Dao God realm to Heavenly Ancestor in one fell swoop, and is still rising.</p>

    <p>Try{mad1('gad2');} catch(ex){}Wang Ling knows in his heart. He can't wait any longer. He must find a way to suppress Peng Beicen. Now Peng Beicen is like a bird full of energy. Balloon. He used his human cultivator body to support the power of the old world.</p>

    <p>If this force is allowed to continue to expand, the consequences will be disastrous.</p>

    <p>"Heavenly Ancestor...Bei Cen! You are really more outstanding and beautiful now than ever." In the secret room, Peng Xiren was secretly excited.</p>

    <p>He watched Peng Beicen's changes in fascination. At the same time, he was looking forward to the scene of Peng Beicen crushing the servant in front of him.</p>

    <p>No matter how extraordinary Wang Rongxia's origins are, and no matter how otherworldly his servants are, this servant is just a servant after all.</p>

    <p>In the current situation, with Peng Beicen growing infinitely, it is useless no matter what the origin of the servant that King Rong Xia takes action is. Even if he is the emperor, how can he do it?</p>

    <p>Even if the emperor comes, he will still die!</p>

    <p>Buzz! A sound!</p>

    <p>Peng Beicen took action.</p>

    <p>The skirt of the tentacles under her feet spread out quickly, completely covering the front. These tentacles contained high-density energy bubbles. Just walking in the air carried a terrifying power of annihilation.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling releases the Heart Sword. The sword's intention is traceless. It attempts to cut off all the tentacles.</p>

    <p>This is a kind of sword intention constructed with mental power. However, Peng Beicen in front of him completely ignored the sword intention and still followed his original will to attack.</p>

    <p>There is a reason for such confidence.</p>

    <p>Her tentacle skirt can not only affect reality, but also destroy mental power. Wang Ling once dealt with the alien gods of the old world. Although it was not a direct confrontation, it was with those who also inherited the blood of the alien gods. Fenmu Shen completed the game. However, he found that the mental power of the outer gods was generally extremely terrifying.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling has not yet seen that Peng Beicen is now under the influence of some external god's power, such a strong sense of oppression still makes Wang Ling feel a familiar feeling.</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling looked up at the sky and took a deep breath.</p>

    <p>The Heart Sword attack just now failed.</p>

    <p>But it doesn't matter at all.</p>

    <p>Just increase the mental strength of the Heart Sword...</p>

    <p>He decided to magnify it 100 million times for now.</p>

    <p>:</p>
