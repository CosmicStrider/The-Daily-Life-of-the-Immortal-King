  <h1>Chapter 1365 Sun Ying'er's new unique skill</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Yang Shuangji's matter came to an end. Zhao Qingxian was also supervised by Gu Shunzhi.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling knows that this matter has actually just begun.</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe's obsession is stronger than Wang Ling imagined.</p>

    <p>Even though Wang Ling has killed all Bai Zhe in the parallel space.</p>

    <p>He still retains a strong obsession.</p>

    <p>Make up your own brain in various forms.</p>

    <p>Then show up in this world.</p>

    <p>Challenge yourself to a pointless challenge.</p>

    <p>Time and time again, he was killed instantly. Time and again, he was able to recover miraculously.</p>

    <p>In Wang Ling's view, Bai Zhe's life is legendary enough...</p>

    <p>Yang Shuangji.</p>

    <p>This is the first character and the first vest that Bai Zhe came up with.</p>

    <p>It's a pity. Bai Zhe died too quickly.</p>

    <p>No useful clues were left.</p>

    <p>Judging from the current situation, the only useful information is Zhao Qingxian.</p>

    <p>He was the first person Bai Zhe found after he recovered from brain damage.</p>

    <p>This is Wang Ling currently unknown. What effect does Zhao Qingxian have on Bai Zhe.</p>

    <p>Therefore, we can only ask Gu Shunzhi to help monitor and monitor.</p>

    <p>After seeing off Zhao Qingxian, Wang Ling began to read the book {{Examination Essays}}.</p>

    <p>After returning from the Jiulongshan National Competition, the essay Crispy Noodles wrote for him became very popular. "A Grain of Ash in Time" almost became a major label for Wang Ling at that time.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Wang Ling was forced to participate in this essay competition by the Chinese teacher Guan Ziqian.</p>

    <p>Before Sunday, he had to submit an essay and upload it to the national competition database through the online platform.</p>

    <p>Teacher Guan is quite a good person. I have to give Wang Ling this face.</p>

    <p>But I really don't know if I can get a ranking or not. Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>Among all the score control items, the score of composition is actually the most difficult to control, because every marking teacher has a different perception of composition.</p>

    <p>The same essay may receive completely different scores.</p>

    <p>And if Wang Ling writes the essay by himself, he will adopt the minimum standard. Just get a passing score that does not miss the topic.</p>

    <p>Then. Wang Ling opened the submission platform for the essay contest.</p>

    <p>I carefully reviewed the theme of this composition: ["The feelings of youth are always poetry. When we sit up and talk to each other, we miss each other." In everyone's youth, there may be people who make them unforgettable. Please come up with your own topic. Talk about yourself now. Are you in love... PS: If you are single. Please use {Single} as the title directly. Talk about your views on singles.]</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's mouth twitched: "..."</p>

    <p>This is a great essay contest.</p>

    <p>Why are you still cursing?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the moon that night. Wang Ying waited for Sun Ying'er for a long time.</p>

    <p>The agreed time is eight o'clock in the evening.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying had nothing to do. He had been here as early as six o'clock.</p>

    <p>Anyway, staying in Wang Ling's mental space is boring for Wang Ying. It's better to stay here and wait for the opportunity to "flirt" Sun Ying'er.</p>

    <p>It's approaching eight o'clock. There are still about two or three minutes until the hour.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er's figure appeared.</p>

    <p>As usual, the girl is still dressed in a dark style.</p>

    <p>She wore a dark burgundy lace dress with sparkling black diamonds on the hem. The dark dress set off Sun Ying'er's snow-white skin. The black girdle showed off her delicate figure. And out.</p>

    <p>In the past two days, Sun Rong bought a lot of new clothes for Sun Ying'er.</p>

    <p>However, Sun Ying'er is keen on dark-colored clothes. She wears only three colors: black, purple, and gray. The only brighter color may be the white lace on the skirt.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying was overjoyed. He pulled the girl into his arms and said, "It looks like you are ready to be punished."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er fell into Wang Ying's arms. She smiled sinisterly: "Wang Ying! You have been fooled!"</p>

    <p>The girl in her arms let out a laugh of triumphant conspiracy. Then there was a bang. Her split body split again!</p>

    <p>This is not Sun Ying'er's true form. It is a "matryoshka-like splitting trap!"</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er knew that his body would not be able to display any abilities around Wang Ying, so he was already prepared on Earth.</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Ying'er was hiding in a corner of the universe, secretly rejoicing in his victory.</p>

    <p>She has actually been thinking about how to crack Wang Ying's {Planet thumping technique}.</p>

    <p>And this time, she finally developed a new unique skill!</p>

    <p>--"{Matryoshka Split Trap}"+"{Shadow Coffin Carrying Technique}!"</p>

    <p>First, use the split body as bait to confuse the target.</p>

    <p>Then when the distance is extremely close, the remaining 6 split bodies are quickly split!</p>

    <p>A total of seven splinter bodies will imprison the target in an instant.</p>

    <p>Starting from the head, limbs, waist and shoulders. The seven split bodies will firmly fix these parts from bottom to top. But lift it to your shoulders!</p>

    <p>Immediately afterwards, the most critical step appeared!</p>

    <p>Once placed on the shoulders of the seven splinters, the lifted target will be quickly cursed. Then an explosion will occur!</p>

    <p>Just crush the bones and spread the ashes. You don't even need to buy a coffin!</p>

    <p>Therefore, Sun Ying'er also called his newly developed unique skill {Shadow Coffin Carrying Technique}.</p>

    <p>It only took a few seconds. A big explosion occurred on the surface of the moon.</p>

    <p>Accompanied by a loud "boom!"</p>

    <p>The seven split bodies died together with Wang Ying, leaving behind a huge crater thousands of feet wide.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying's aura completely disappeared.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er hid in the dark and observed.</p>

    <p>She thought she might be happy after Wang Ying disappeared.</p>

    <p>Because she finally broke free from the shackles of a pervert.</p>

    <p>However, it turned out that Sun Ying'er was not as happy as he imagined.</p>

    <p>On the contrary, a feeling of emptiness filled Sun Ying'er's heart.</p>

    <p>"This idiot... is usually so smart! Why was he really killed..." The expression on Sun Ying'er's face was very complicated. She looked at the huge crater on the surface of the moon. She felt Wang Ying's disappearing breath. In her heart There was actually a sense of loss.</p>

    <p>"Idiot Wang Ying! Pervert Wang Ying!" She stamped her feet and yelled in the dark. Tears were already rolling in her eyes.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Ying's voice suddenly sounded from behind her.</p>

    <p>"Miss me?"</p>

    <p>In the cosmic space, in the deep and boundless darkness, a hand condensed from the black shadow. It quickly materialized, and pinched the girl's soft earlobe.</p>

    <p>"You...you're not dead?" Sun Ying'er held back her tears instantly.</p>

    <p>"I've told you before. You are a stupid woman. You want to kill me with this little trick?" Wang Ying revealed his entire body. He appeared from behind. He clasped the girl's hand back and pressed it against a stone. On the meteorite.</p>

    <p>The girl's hand was clasped in reverse. Wang Ying pressed her joints. The pain made her gasp: "Don't push forward...it hurts!"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Wang Ying loosened his grip a little and raised the corners of his lips slightly: "Do you know it hurts now?"</p>

    <p>"Just wait. Sooner or later I will blow you up..."</p>

    <p>"Tough talk."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying smiled bitterly and shook his head: "Did you just call me a fool? It seems like you scolded me twice? Article 6: If you scold me once in the future, you will get 200 ball bangs."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"So. Today's punishment is 600 times in total."</p>

    <p>"But you just stipulated it today!" Sun Ying'er was dissatisfied.</p>

    <p>"I don't care."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying whispered in Sun Ying'er's ear: "I just want to see you so angry and unable to kill me."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er: "..."</p>

    <p>That night, inspired by Sun Ying'er, Wang Ying also upgraded his {Planet thumping technique}.</p>

    <p>Changed to {MultipleÂ·Planet thumping technique}.</p>

    <p>There are seven Wang Yings in total. Each person holds down a part of the girl.</p>

    <p>Once again, the newly repaired planets in the extraterrestrial galaxy were smashed to pieces...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>PS: Watch this chapter. The effect will be better when combined with the video {Black people carrying coffins}. You can search on Bilibili...</p>
