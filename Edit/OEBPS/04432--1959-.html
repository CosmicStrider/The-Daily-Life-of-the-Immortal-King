  <h1>Chapter 1959 The War Between Geniuses</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Attack and defense between masters often predict the opponent's next move.</p>

    <p>The reason why Qu Shuling has been able to win the first place in high school competitions at home and abroad is because his rich combat experience has allowed him to master "spiritual vision" at such a young age.</p>

    <p>This is not a skill that ordinary cultivators can master.</p>

    <p>The so-called spiritual vision. As the name suggests, it is through mental deduction and visual brainstorming during the battle.</p>

    <p>By guessing the opponent's next move, you can seize the right moment or take the initiative to attack, or dismantle moves.</p>

    <p>He struck preemptively. He used this ability when he just fought against Zhang Linyan and Li Changzhe.</p>

    <p>Of course. As top high school students in major elite universities, Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan also have the ability of "spiritual vision."</p>

    <p>But in that fight just now, they immediately realized the gap between themselves and Qu Shuling.</p>

    <p>"He is indeed very strong..." After the two of them were knocked away by Qu Shuling, they could already feel Qu Shuling's power and difficulty as they looked into each other's eyes.</p>

    <p>This level of spiritual vision is at least the top ten levels!</p>

    <p>And he and Zhang Linyan had just broken through to the eighth level. If their pre-reading ability and speed were not as good as Qu Shuling's, they should be unable to defeat them.</p>

    <p>Now, the pressure of the battle has suddenly come to Wang Ling. If even Wang Ling is knocked down, then it is very likely that their three-on-one start will be caused by Qu Shuling's three-yuan victory. It's an embarrassing situation.</p>

    <p>Plus. Wang Ling is still the weakest on their side...</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling might be able to send Wang Ling away directly.</p>

    <p>"Old Teng, are you sure to cut all the shots to the back mountain and ignore the battle on the front?" At the same moment, a staff member asked in the command post of Jiutian Jingmiyuan.</p>

    <p>"Never mind! Aim all the cameras you can at the back of the mountain!" Teng Luchen ordered.</p>

    <p>He was tugging on his beard while watching the game in front of him seriously. Although the plot was also developing towards a situation that he did not expect.</p>

    <p>But in the final analysis, what he wanted to see most was how Wang Ling responded...</p>

    <p>The showdown between the legendary genius high school student and the hidden genius he suspected. Every detail is the focus of Teng Luchen's concern.</p>

    <p>The other side. The center of the battle.</p>

    <p>The moment he was targeted by Qu Shuling, Wang Ling realized that the situation was starting to become troublesome.</p>

    <p>He knew very well that he was being watched by countless pairs of eyes from the outside world. Every move he made next, he had to be careful and cautious.</p>

    <p>Talisman is now in an unstable state. Facing Qu Shuling's attack, Wang Ling's subconscious reaction is to first distance itself.</p>

    <p>He can take a beating. But there's no need.</p>

    <p>Because Qu Shuling hit him. The one who was injured was definitely not Wang Ling himself, but Qu Shuling.</p>

    <p>And with the protection mechanism of the spirit world, the power of that protective shield can't stop Wang Ling's counterattack.</p>

    <p>The current Wang Ling is a ball of unstable matter. As long as Qu Shuling hits him, there is a 50% probability that he will win the prize directly and be turned into a ball of fly ash.</p>

    <p>Therefore Wang Ling ran away without hesitation. And this move was very reasonable in the eyes of everyone.</p>

    <p>Facing an enemy whose realm was several levels higher than his own, his subconscious escape seemed to be a matter of course. The calmness shown by Wang Ling surprised both Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan slightly.</p>

    <p>There is a difference between this and Qu Shuling by several levels. He can still show such an attitude of not being alarmed by changes. Sure enough, he can be selected for the spiritual world trial. Wang Ling is not unreasonable.</p>

    <p>However, Qu Shuling does have the ability of "spiritual vision." Wang Ling This retreat was actually part of his prediction.</p>

    <p>He held up the spiritual sword in his hand and pretended to rush in to attack. In fact, he used a hidden weapon to lay a spell trap while moving. It was a miniature Talisman originally designed by Qu Shuling. A Talisman is only the size of a fingernail.</p>

    <p>Paste it on the nail in advance. When using it, you only need to flick the nail. The miniature Talisman will automatically burn. It is arranged in the designated position according to the spiritual guidance of the caster to form a spell trap.</p>

    <p>Just as Li Changzhe had guessed, he came with the idea of sending Wang Ling away directly from the beginning. He used his close body to approach Wang Ling while guiding Wang Ling behind him. In the arranged magic trap.</p>

    <p>Such fighting skills. Qu Shuling often uses them in several competitions. It can't be said to be a dirty trick. After all, in comprehensive competitions, Talisman, magic weapons, and spiritual swords are all allowed to be used. Use them skillfully together. He is also an elite cultivator. A required course for readers.</p>

    <p>But this trick works for others. For Wang Ling, it's a bit too childish.</p>

    <p>In the face of absolute strength, any fighting skills are useless.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling closed his eyes slightly. He did not use his vision at all. He only relied on his powerful spiritual perception to figure out the dense spell traps laid by Qu Shuling behind him.</p>

    <p>It was a series of explosive formations. It was simple and crude. It was like a landmine. As long as it touched a point, it would explode immediately, causing a chain reaction.</p>

    <p>However, at this moment, Zhang Linyan, who was in the distance, drew her bow and arrow. She aimed the arrow directly at the spell trap behind Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Although three-on-one is a bit overwhelming, it is also Qu Shuling's own choice. He is extremely arrogant and wants to fight one against three. Under such circumstances, if Qu Shuling succeeds one after another, he will be forced to defeat one by one and evolve into Only by fighting alone would one fall into Qu Shuling's trap.</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan's arrow is extremely fast. It is also a split arrow. After one arrow is shot, the arrow breaks into multiple arrows and scatters during the flight.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was originally struggling with how to dismantle Qu Shuling's moves as gently as possible. Zhang Linyan's arrow was like giving him a pillow when he fell asleep. He immediately gave Wang Ling an excellent assist.</p>

    <p>Feeling an arrow coming from behind, Qu Shuling reacted extremely quickly. He immediately unfolded his spiritual sword and drew it out of the eight-foot sword circle, trying to block all the arrows.</p>

    <p>"Brother Qu, don't underestimate us. The three cobblers can beat Zhuge Liang!" When Li Changzhe saw this, he also used his hands to make magic spells and sprayed thick mist from his mouth, which provided sufficient cover for Zhang Linyan's arrow.</p>

    <p>"It's just useless work."</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling snorted softly. Such mist was completely useless to him, because at the same time Zhang Linyan shot the arrow, his spiritual vision had accurately locked the position of each arrow to ensure that he was wielding it. The sword can accurately block all arrows during the process.</p>

    <p>However, to Qu Shuling's surprise, under the cover of thick fog, these flying arrows seemed to be endowed with intelligence.</p>

    <p>As I approached him quickly, I started to turn at a weird angle that was almost impossible...</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling was a little surprised.</p>

    <p>He had heard of gun fighting.</p>

    <p>I just never thought about it. There is actually the art of archery fighting...</p>

    <p>Has Zhang Linyan's cultivation reached this level?</p>

    <p>But he clearly remembered that he had never seen Zhang Linyan use this trick in any competition before.</p>
