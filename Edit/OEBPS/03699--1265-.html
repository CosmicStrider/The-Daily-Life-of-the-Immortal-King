  <h1>Chapter 1265 Sun Rong. Exit group chat</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Being held at the neck by Wang Ling with a mahogany sword. Death Heavenly Dao felt very wronged.</p>

    <p>As one of the six lords Heavenly Dao. Death Heavenly Dao believes that he has always adhered to his duty as an envoy of Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>He is conscientious and conscientious! He even works under the 996 system! He usually works overtime and doesn't dare to complain...</p>

    <p>Every time a person dies on the earth, he has to write down the person's name, summarize the person's life experience, and then discuss the person's reincarnation.</p>

    <p>People who have accumulated good deeds and performed good deeds in daily life. Deathly Heavenly Dao will decide where appropriate to let the souls of these deceased rest in peace as soon as possible. Find a good home for them to enter reincarnation as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>If you are a person who commits many evil deeds and violates laws and disciplines, then there is a great possibility that you will not be able to be a human being in your next life. Even if you become a human being, your start will be a bad start.</p>

    <p>But Heavenly Dao never expected that one day it would be his turn to be "bad"...</p>

    <p>His heart is like a mirror. If he can't calm down the anger of the man behind him, he might really burst into pieces!</p>

    <p>At this time, Death Heavenly Dao was threatened. The other Heavenly Dao were also trembling.</p>

    <p>They have seen the power of this mahogany sword before.</p>

    <p>One sword strike. I'm afraid the entire heaven will collapse...</p>

    <p>"What happened?"</p>

    <p>"What else can happen..." Heavenly Dao winked crazily.</p>

    <p>Just when Heavenly Dao looked confused, as a good brother, he already had a general understanding of the situation in the lower realm.</p>

    <p>Among the six Lords Heavenly Dao, Life Heavenly Dao and Death Heavenly Dao are the only twin brothers. They are also collectively called "Life and Death Heavenly Dao."</p>

    <p>So. Although there are only six positions in the main Heavenly Dao, there are actually seven people.</p>

    <p>This is what the legend says: There are seven meanings in the world.</p>

    <p>"Zhenren, don't be angry. If you have anything to say, we can discuss it..."</p>

    <p>Death is a younger brother. Now the younger brother is in trouble. As an older brother, Heavenly Dao naturally has to come out to help smooth things over.</p>

    <p>He already knows the reason why Wang Ling is so angry.</p>

    <p>After all, it was all about rescuing a girl. I kept drawing scapegoats. I didn't even have time to eat crispy noodles...</p>

    <p>"Check it out quickly. What is going on with this Sun Rong girl! As Death Heavenly Dao, how can you be so negligent and slack..." Survival Heavenly Dao reprimanded while crazily winking at Death Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>Their Heavenly Dao little Golden Men are covered in Dharma light. Normally, their expressions are invisible. However, after getting along with each other for a long time, they can still distinguish each other.</p>

    <p>Death and survival are twin brothers. There is no doubt that they are in harmony.</p>

    <p>"Zhenren, be patient. I'm going to find out what's going on." Heavenly Dao turned his back and bowed respectfully to Wang Ling. Then he took out a strange-looking machine from his crotch. Incomparable golden orb.</p>

    <p>He gently touched the magic ball with his hands. Then a screen was immediately projected into the void.</p>

    <p>What is displayed on the screen is a chat group for the dead.</p>

    <p>This is a chat group used by Heavenly Dao to register the deceased. The souls of all the deceased are pulled into such a group. The maximum number of people in each group is 2,000.</p>

    <p>Heavenly Dao is the total group leader of all groups.</p>

    <p>There are no less than a trillion chat groups for dead people like this within his jurisdiction alone.</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao quickly retrieves the information of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>As a result, records related to Sun Rong were found in one of the groups he was in charge of...</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren, look. This is the chat history...it's all here..." Death Heavenly Dao retrieved all the parts related to Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Then Wang Ling saw what happened after Sun Rong joined the chat group of the deceased.</p>

    <p>Around noon on November 27th.</p>

    <p>[System prompt: The new deceased Sun Rong. has joined the group chat]</p>

    <p>In the chat group of the dead. A girl joined the group chat. The other dead were actually a little excited.</p>

    <p>"Why is a girl here?"</p>

    <p>"Hey. She is only 16 years old...so young..."</p>

    <p>"What a pity. Why did you come here at the age of 16?"</p>

    <p>In the chat group, everyone sighed.</p>

    <p>They were trying to find out about the girl.</p>

    <p>Then the system prompt came again [New deceased Sun Rong. Has exited the group chat]</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Seeing this. Wang Ling was silent for a moment.</p>

    <p>He speculated that exiting the group chat should be the time point when the first "death talisman" officially takes effect.</p>

    <p>Seeing Sun Rong withdraw from the group. The dead in the group were collectively shocked!</p>

    <p>"What the hell? Can you still withdraw from the group?"</p>

    <p>"What the hell...can you leave the group after joining it? Is this a scam?"</p>

    <p>"Oh no! Why can she leave the group chat! I want to leave the group chat too! Woohoo!"</p>

    <p>Many deceased people complained in the group.</p>

    <p>In a crowd of 2,000 people, there are always people who die without fulfilling their wishes and with regrets.</p>

    <p>The reason why Heavenly Dao established this group is to appease the souls of the deceased.</p>

    <p>His original intention was to let the dead calm down by communicating with each other, complaining, and comparing their misfortunes.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the specific method of allocating people into groups is based on the calculation results of big data.</p>

    <p>The death system will continue to allow people with worse life experiences to join the group, thereby allowing the souls of the last person to join the group to be comforted.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong. A sixteen-year-old girl in her prime. Died under unknown circumstances...</p>

    <p>So young. Of course, Death Heavenly Dao's system would judge him to be a very tragic character.</p>

    <p>So. Sun Rong was pulled into a chat group.</p>

    <p>And sure enough, after seeing the age of Sun Rong, the deceased who had already joined the group fell silent one after another.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong is too young.</p>

    <p>This is just a 16-year-old girl...</p>

    <p>However, these deceased people did not have time to sigh and appease Sun Rong. Sun Rong directly exited the group chat.</p>

    <p>During that time, there was a brief riot in the group.</p>

    <p>Many deceased people began to think that Sun Rong was a related household.</p>

    <p>The emotional reactions of the deceased were intense.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, the appearance of Sun Rong was just a small incident. The matter was quickly revealed.</p>

    <p>But what none of the dead expected was...</p>

    <p>Just an hour later. Sun Rong actually entered the group chat again.</p>

    <p>[System prompt: The new deceased Sun Rong. has joined the group chat]</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>"What's going on? He's in again?"</p>

    <p>"It's really like lying on your back and getting up in the coffin... What's going on with this girl? It's so evil!"</p>

    <p>"Oh my god. Are our group so undignified now? Wasn't it created by Death Heavenly Dao?"</p>

    <p>The dead began to wonder about Sun Rong's identity.</p>

    <p>However, they were the same as an hour ago. Before they had time to ask, the system prompt that Sun Rong left the group appeared again...</p>

    <p>"Brother...what exactly is going on?"</p>

    <p>This scene made even Heavenly Dao look confused.</p>

    <p>"You are Death Heavenly Dao. How do I know what's going on!" Survival Heavenly Dao holds his forehead.</p>

    <p>The situation is indeed somewhat beyond their understanding.</p>

    <p>In less than 24 hours.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong has joined and left the group more than a dozen times.</p>

    <p>She herself was fine.</p>

    <p>It directly broke the mentality of other people who died in the group!</p>

    <p>There has never been a single person who could come in and out of the chat group of the dead created by Heavenly Dao...</p>

    <p>Moreover, the frequency of system prompts is getting faster and faster.</p>

    <p>Heavenly Dao speculates that it won't take long for death. The system prompts will refresh the screen!</p>
