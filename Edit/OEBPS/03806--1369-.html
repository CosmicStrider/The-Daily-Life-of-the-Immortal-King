  <h1>Chapter 1369 Holy Land of CultivationÂ·Mountain of Retrospection</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Friday, December 4th.</p>

    <p>Definitely a day worth remembering.</p>

    <p>There is one more Foundation Building Stager in this world whose combat power is comparable to the peak level of Dao Supreme.</p>

    <p>If you take away the label of being a wealthy daughter.</p>

    <p>This is just an ordinary ordinary girl.</p>

    <p>She is such an ordinary Foundation Building student.</p>

    <p>In today's era of Foundation Building, there are so many cultivators.</p>

    <p>In fact, such a state cannot gain a foothold in the world of cultivation.</p>

    <p>Until, that is, the young girl drew her own 999,999,999,999 ranked spirit sword...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong holds Aohai's sword hilt. Feeling the powerful sword energy released from the upgraded Aohai.</p>

    <p>Aohai is indeed amazingly strong now.</p>

    <p>This has not yet been unsheathed. Even if the sword energy before the upgrade reaches its peak state, it is just a drop in the ocean compared to what it is now.</p>

    <p>"Senior. Can I try the sword?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>Shen Wuyue was shocked: "Miss Sun, please don't try it here...if you strike with your sword, the holy pillar may collapse."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong covered her mouth slightly. Surprised: "Is it really that powerful?"</p>

    <p>"That's not true..." Shen Wuyue wiped his sweat.</p>

    <p>Now Aohai. If this sword goes down, everyone under Dao Supreme will have to be on leash...</p>

    <p>The power of nature is unparalleled.</p>

    <p>"After Miss Sun's Aohai has been upgraded this time, it is already unparalleled. It can definitely be ranked in the top ten on the universe sword spirit list," the monk said.</p>

    <p>"I remember my classmate Wang Ling had a mahogany sword..."</p>

    <p>"You mean Master Jingke? Master Jingke must be number one. No one can surpass him. Moreover, Master Jingke has an upgraded form. After transforming into Master Jingbai, he is even more unmatched."</p>

    <p>The monk said: "And the second-ranked sword is [prelude]."</p>

    <p>"I know this. It's Zhuo Yi's senior spirit sword! But [pre] seems a little sluggish now." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"The poor monk has also heard about this."</p>

    <p>The monk nodded and said: "But as far as the poor monk knows, [pre] seems to have no scabbard... If you want to help him get back on his feet, I think we can match up with Miss Aohai."</p>

    <p>"I don't think so."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong didn't answer yet. Sun Ying'er shook his head directly.</p>

    <p>The monk smiled: "Miss Ying'er thinks there is something wrong."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying Er: "My Rongrong is still single, this sword spirit to do so first how can it be!"</p>

    <p>The monk smiled but remained silent.</p>

    <p>It is said that the spiritual sword resembles the form of its master...</p>

    <p>If Aohai becomes successful, maybe the master will be able to speed up.</p>

    <p>So he felt.</p>

    <p>Not necessarily.</p>

    <p>However, bringing "Yu" and "Aohai" together was just a joke made by the monk himself.</p>

    <p>That's all he said. He didn't continue the topic.</p>

    <p>And in fact.</p>

    <p>Even the monk himself didn't expect this.</p>

    <p>Aohai. Seems serious...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. In the mountain of retrospect in the demon world.</p>

    <p>Er Ha is practicing retreat here.</p>

    <p>This is a secret realm in the demon world specially opened up by Wang Ling for Er Ha.</p>

    <p>Of course, after this secret realm was opened, Er Ha was not the only one who benefited.</p>

    <p>Afterwards, all core members of the Office of Strategic Deception who need to retreat to Tribulation Transcendence can come here.</p>

    <p>In this secret realm, the flow of time will speed up, which will greatly shorten the training time.</p>

    <p>It swallowed the essence of a divine beast's young and digested it according to the normal time. It would take hundreds of years at least.</p>

    <p>But now. 3 days is enough.</p>

    <p>And it hasn't been completely digested yet. The signs of promotion have already appeared.</p>

    <p>This is a good thing for Er Ha.</p>

    <p>Its purpose is only to promote the divine beast. As long as this purpose is achieved, it is enough.</p>

    <p>As for the remaining spirit of the mythical beast, it can be left to Xiao Yin.</p>

    <p>Strictly speaking, Xiao Yin is his "junior brother." As a senior brother, he should take care of his junior brother.</p>

    <p>At that moment, over the Mountain of Retrospection, the thunderbolts are roaring.</p>

    <p>The power of chaos surged above it, making Er Ha feel a bit dangerous.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if it is because the demon world has completed its upgrade at the same time. It feels that the sea of thunder and calamity above its head seems to be particularly manic.</p>

    <p>The Tribulation Transcendence standard for divine beasts is that they need to withstand at least 2% of the thunder tribulation mixed with the power of chaos.</p>

    <p>But now, the concentration of chaotic power in the Sea of Thunder Tribulation in the sky seems to Er Ha to have seriously exceeded the standard!</p>

    <p>"What on earth is going on..." Er Ha looked confused.</p>

    <p>If this lightning disaster were to strike down, it felt that it might not be able to survive relying solely on its own strength!</p>

    <p>The situation. Something is very wrong!</p>

    <p>Because in the next breath, Er Ha felt that the concentration of the power of chaos was so huge that it was difficult to even breathe!</p>

    <p>The concentration has now exceeded 30%!</p>

    <p>Er Ha feels like she can't bear it anymore!</p>

    <p>This is the promised 2%!</p>

    <p>Was it scammed?</p>

    <p>At the same time, in response to the sudden abnormal increase in the concentration of chaos power in the Mountain of Retrospection, the Office of Strategic Deception's Cellar Monitoring and Command Center also quickly carried out emergency notification work.</p>

    <p>"Mountain of Backtracking! The concentration of Chaos Power is abnormal! The Er Ha Brotherhood is in danger!" Command Center. Keorn nervously carried out the briefing work.</p>

    <p>After the SBP Foundation was disbanded, he officially joined the Office of Strategic Deception. He was also the first foreigner to join the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Why does this happen?</p>

    <p>After receiving the news, Lord Diulei frowned. He asked the core group of the Office of Strategic Deception: "There seems to be something wrong with this situation... Does anyone know what the situation is?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Senior Jin Deng said before that the concentration of thunder and chaos power of the promoted divine beast is only 2%. Even if a mutation occurs, the error will not exceed 5%. This concentration is very abnormal! If it is chopped down. I'm afraid even this secret realm that Master casually arranged will be destroyed."</p>

    <p>Jin Deng: "Don't panic, everyone. I'm in the demon world. I originally accompanied the Sun Rong girl to upgrade Aohai. I didn't expect that it would happen just in time for such a thing. I'm going to take a look."</p>

    <p>What is the specific situation now? Even the monks are not sure until they see it with their own eyes.</p>

    <p>But he actually already had some guesses in his mind.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "Senior Jin Deng. What is going on? Is Er Ha in danger?"</p>

    <p>Jin Deng said: "Miss Sun, don't worry. There will be no problem with the poor monk here. You and Miss Ying'er will stay outside the secret realm later. Don't go in."</p>

    <p>In fact, when Jin Deng said this, he himself felt a little weak.</p>

    <p>Now the concentration of chaos power in Thunder Tribulation has exceeded 30%. And it is still on the rise...</p>

    <p>Given his level, holding on to 50% is already the limit.</p>

    <p>If this continues to rise.</p>

    <p>Jin Deng felt that maybe even he would be chopped into ashes.</p>

    <p>When he successfully arrived at the secret realm of the Mountain of Recall, the monk felt that the situation seemed to be more serious than he imagined.</p>

    <p>There were actually cracks at the entrance to the secret realm...</p>

    <p>"It must be stopped as soon as possible!" The monk frowned.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, when the secret realm is broken, a high concentration of chaotic power will flow out. Even the upgraded demon world will fall apart in an instant!</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, Monk Jin Deng stepped into the entrance of the secret realm regardless of his safety.</p>

    <p>As soon as he entered, the monk immediately felt his knees sink suddenly.</p>

    <p>The pressure brought by this high concentration of chaos power almost made him kneel!</p>

    <p>He came back to his senses and looked at Er Ha.</p>

    <p>I found that Er Ha's entire dog had been embedded in the ground. It was almost flattened into a piece of dog meat...</p>

    <p>"Original Demon Saint. How is the situation?"</p>

    <p>The second generation Demon Saint is also very concerned about the situation inside.</p>

    <p>As a result, the person just walked in with his front feet.</p>

    <p>His back foot made a "pop" sound and he fell to his knees on the spot.</p>

    <p>Shen Wuyue followed the second-generation Demon Saint. As soon as he entered, he knelt down next to the second-generation Demon Saint with another "pop" sound.</p>

    <p>It's hard to imagine. A demon saint and a holy messenger. The two of them were kneeling neatly...</p>

    <p>The corners of the monk's mouth twitched. What was he doing?</p>

    <p>Happy Chinese New Year to Big Brother and Sister-in-law?</p>

    <p>But it's not the New Year's Eve yet...</p>

    <p>(I have had severe insomnia these past two days. I adjusted my schedule as quickly as possible... The update time is not stable. Please forgive me.)</p>
