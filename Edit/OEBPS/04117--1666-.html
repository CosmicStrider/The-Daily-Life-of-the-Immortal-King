  <h1>Chapter 1666 A battle beyond normal cognition</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The divine power of the six Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cubes inside the current Aohai Sword works together. Under the superimposed force, a sword pressure that can be called a crushing level is formed. It is so shocking that it is unimaginable.</p>

    <p>It is true that among Dao Ancestor Wang's original Rubik's Cube, the remaining three are now in the hands of Wang Ling. This means that Aohai will become a true "nine-core spiritual sword" in the future, but it is just that. It's just a matter of time.</p>

    <p>But even if there are three missing at the moment, the pressure is outrageous.</p>

    <p>"How could this be so..." Led by Jin Yan, the leader of this group of New Ancient Divine Weapons, everyone here was stunned for a moment. Their eyes were wide open. They looked like Wei Xiaobao in the first episode of The Deer and the Cauldron. That scene when telling a book.</p>

    <p>How can a girl whose strength is only at the Foundation Building stage be able to control this spiritual sword that is fused with six Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cubes?</p>

    <p>Jin Yan found that at this moment, his memory began to go wrong, because his mind went blank and he could not find a way to deal with this situation.</p>

    <p>The girl with the six-core Aohai is too powerful. Just standing there. A tsunami rolled over her body. The pressure of the sword was as strong as an apocalyptic impact. All of them were frozen. Unable to move.</p>

    <p>This is also the first time Sun Rong has shown its strongest combat power in front of outsiders.</p>

    <p>When she slashed the Old God with her sword before, she had not reached such an outrageous level. But now, she is obviously stronger than then.</p>

    <p>No one could have imagined that in a Foundation Building period, he would be blessed with combat power that could be called a "monster" through a spiritual sword.</p>

    <p>That's right.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Sun Rong is an out-and-out monster in the eyes of these New Ancient Divine Weapons headed by Jin Yan.</p>

    <p>We can't go on like this... we have to find a way!</p>

    <p>Watching Sun Rong approaching him step by step, Jin Yan began to forcibly manipulate his body that was stiffened by the sword. At the same time, the New Ancient Divine Weapons underneath were also called bionic humans. They all adopted the same approach.</p>

    <p>They are too close to Sun Rong and cannot move. They can only forcefully lift the rigid state and move the distance as far as possible.</p>

    <p>However, this move is also ridiculous and slaps in the face.</p>

    <p>Because before coming here, Jin Yan thought this would be an easy task.</p>

    <p>Even though Mr. Gong is very strong, they may not be able to defeat "him" because of their numbers. Bring him back to that adult alive and intact.</p>

    <p>But the current situation. Jin Yan feels that the situation has completely changed.</p>

    <p>"Listen to my orders. Set up the formation! Just make sure Mr. Gong is alive... Even if you break his hands and feet, beat him into a cripple. As long as you make sure he is alive, there is no need to consider other things." Jin Yan ordered as a last resort.</p>

    <p>This was a helpless move. Originally, they wanted to bring "Mr. Gong" alive and unscathed to Nawei.</p>

    <p>But now it's obviously impossible.</p>

    <p>This is a battle that requires all-out efforts. The necessary casualties cannot be escaped.</p>

    <p>Just as Jin Yan finished speaking, a dozen or so golden psychic arrows shot out of the surrounding holes, splitting the space like waves. The void that the arrows passed through directly plowed out a series of pitch black holes. cracks.</p>

    <p>This is a combat power that is close to the level of God. Tearing apart space is already a common occurrence.</p>

    <p>These golden arrows flashed through the void with terrifying power at a speed invisible to the naked eye. Dragging ferocious space cracks. It was poignant and gorgeous. They were unusually concentrated and headed towards the roof from multiple directions. Sun Rong shot away.</p>

    <p>If these powerful psychic arrows collide on the roof, the mansion will be instantly razed to the ground under a huge explosion.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong stands on the roof. Aohai's sword energy has completely covered the entire imperial city. He can clearly sense the location of these dozen androids, including before they came here. They were deliberately arranged around the mansion. The lower boundary.</p>

    <p>This is to prevent accidents like this from happening when they take action. Let the impact of the explosion spread to other places.</p>

    <p>However, such behavior actually helped Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>She stood motionless. She was protected by Aohai's sword energy. In addition, the permanent consecration spell that monk Jin Deng applied to her body during the last "Yin Yang Death Tribulation Incident" made her body's strength reach an unbelievable level. An incredible situation.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>Aohai's body-protecting sword energy was automatically released, forming an eggshell-shaped sword barrier with a radius of eight feet wide. These golden arrows struck from all directions. In the end, even the sword barrier failed to break through.</p>

    <p>It only reached eight feet around Sun Rong. It was frozen in mid-air as if time had stopped. It was unable to move forward even half a step.</p>

    <p>Soon!</p>

    <p>A horrifying scene happened!</p>

    <p>These golden arrows with huge energy were swallowed up by Sun Rong's body-protecting sword energy!</p>

    <p>Like a mud cow falling into the sea, it fell into the endless deep sea and was quickly submerged. No trace could be found.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Jin Yan's head was confused again. He looked at Sun Rong's face without joy or sorrow. While he was shocked by this scene, he also noticed the girl's gaze.</p>

    <p>It was actually a kind of contempt that did not take them seriously...</p>

    <p>"Looks like it's my turn down there," the girl said.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Aohai's sword is filled with the mysterious color of azure. It is crystal clear and extremely brilliant. It has the immeasurable heritage of the sea, is profound, and at the same time exudes endless breath of life.</p>

    <p>"Alluring Sword." She said calmly. With an extremely graceful and beautiful body, she danced the blue sword to draw a circle around herself.</p>

    <p>The last time I used this powerful Alluring Sword was when Aohai and Bai Qiao were combined.</p>

    <p>And now. Because Aohai possesses six Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cubes, this Alluring Sword has become a common skill of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>The only change is that last time it was a straight slash! It cut out tens of thousands of meters of sword energy!</p>

    <p>But this time, it was a circular sword energy that was slashed out around the body, like a gorgeous waltz. It made people's scalp numb the moment it was unleashed!</p>

    <p>Of course, she also has more powerful moves, such as a sword that overwhelms the country, or a sword that overwhelms the Globe...</p>

    <p>But if these two more powerful moves are used at this time, it makes Sun Rong a little worried whether the barrier these people have set up around the mansion will be directly destroyed by his own move, affecting other innocent people. residents.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>The circular sword energy of the Alluring Sword rushed out. It contained an ultrasonic wave that could not be heard even with Dao God-level ears. It slashed along all sides.</p>

    <p>The sixteen androids, including Jin Yan, looked horrified.</p>

    <p>For each of them...</p>

    <p>This question is completely out of scope!</p>

    <p>It's not a level they can handle!</p>

    <p>Even the combat power is not on the same dimensional level!</p>

    <p>Although they were created androids, just tools to obey orders, they also valued their own lives. After realizing that their actions had completely underestimated the combat power of this "Mr. Gong", everyone's inner feelings The first thought is to retreat.</p>

    <p>However, Aohai's sword energy is too fast...</p>

    <p>Along all directions. Sweeping thousands of armies!</p>

    <p>The sixteen androids were about to retreat when their vision suddenly tilted.</p>

    <p>It turned out to be their bodies whose heads had left...</p>

    <p>Sixteen heads that are accurate to the level of God.</p>

    <p>Just between this breath.</p>

    <p>Landing together...</p>
