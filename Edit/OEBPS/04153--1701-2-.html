  <h1>Chapter 1701 2 Entering the Mountain of Retrospection</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Following Monk Jin Deng into the Mountain of Retrospection, Sun Rong has the feeling of revisiting her old haunts. The last time she upgraded Ao Hai here, she happened to help Er Ha solve the high concentration of Chaos Cataclysm caused by his ascension from Sacred Beast to Divine Beast.</p>

    <p>This time she entered again to complete the upgrade of the nine-core Aohai. The first time was new, the second time was familiar. This time her mood was much calmer than the last time.</p>

    <p>I'm just a little worried about whether I will be able to control Aohai after it is upgraded to nine cores.</p>

    <p>"Miss Rong, there is no need to be nervous. The upgrade is to the nine-core Aohai. The success rate is 100%. Because it has been fused several times, the subsequent fusion is not that difficult." Monk Jin Deng said: "As for Ling Zhenren, he chose to let the poor monk Bring Miss Rong here. The main thing is to be on guard. After Aohai upgraded to the nine-core spirit sword, there is a problem of energy surge."</p>

    <p>"It must be very strong. I'm worried that I can't control it..." Sun Rong frowned slightly. Her strength has been at the peak of the late Foundation Building. She is only a hair away from the Golden Core. Although her own combat power is blessed by Aohai It's far more than that. But the basic level cannot be climbed up. Controlling Aohai is always a problem.</p>

    <p>It's just like the equipment in the game. The equipment has a level limit. If the character is below the level, he cannot afford the attribute blessings brought by the powerful equipment.</p>

    <p>If it is operated improperly, it will not only cause danger to yourself, but also pose a threat to those around you.</p>

    <p>This is not a situation that Sun Rong wants to see.</p>

    <p>He was thinking wildly in his mind. At this time, the monk suddenly laughed: "Miss Rong thinks too much. Although the poor monk said before, I want Miss Rong to be cautious about using Aohai's power. But in terms of controlling Aohai, Miss Rong needn't worry."</p>

    <p>"But isn't that normally the case?"</p>

    <p>"This is indeed the normal situation. Spiritual swords, magic weapons and even some high-level Talisman in the world of cultivation have realm restrictions. If the realm is not enough, they cannot be driven smoothly. This is because the cultivator himself has a low realm and insufficient spiritual power. Driving these high-level magic weapons requires a lot of spiritual energy. They simply cannot afford it."</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng said: "It seems like a limitation. But lack of spiritual power is the main reason."</p>

    <p>"What about me?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"The Aohai that Miss Rong has has six cores. Haven't you noticed it after using it for so long? Because Miss Rong doesn't need to consider the issue of spiritual energy consumption at all."</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng said: "When the human-sword fusion mechanism is activated, Aohai's power is Miss Rong's power. With such a passive ability, the problem of insufficient spiritual power can be ignored."</p>

    <p>"So that's it." Sun Rong nodded.</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Ying'er also appeared to comfort her: "Rongrong, you are thinking too much. It is impossible to lose control. Even if you lose control, I will still be there. And this time, I feel that the progress between you and Ling Zhenren is very good!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was startled: "What...what does that mean..."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er: "It's really big! Look, this thought plague is so dangerous. There are so many people in the Office of Strategic Deception. His first thought is to help you increase your strength!"</p>

    <p>This is not because Sun Ying'er is deliberately trying to make fun of Sun Rong like usual. But she really feels that there has been great progress between the two this time.</p>

    <p>Although she kept her words calm, in fact Sun Rong was still very happy in her heart.</p>

    <p>As for the other side, Zhuo Yi, who has been assisting in secret, is also very touched by this matter.</p>

    <p>Since Lord Ma brought Sun Rong to meet with Monk Jin Deng. After leaving the Wang family's small villa.</p>

    <p>He stared at Wang Ling who was eagerly opening the plastic bag of customized crisp noodles and asked: "Master, have you had any thoughts about Miss Rong?"</p>

    <p>"?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has a big question mark, but also did not reject it.</p>

    <p>He did have some ideas.</p>

    <p>But this idea was mainly caused by Sun Rong being forced to confess her feelings to him after the question session.</p>

    <p>Keep letting Sun Rong stay here. It's embarrassing for both of them.</p>

    <p>Instead of doing this, it is better to think of a way to remove Sun Rong...</p>

    <p>And Sun Rong is always in his room. She doesn't like crispy noodles either!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has never been in the habit of being stared at while eating...</p>

    <p>Usually in the school cafeteria, I choose a corner seat to eat.</p>

    <p>The basic process is.</p>

    <p>Do your best to avoid people you know well by forcing yourself to dine alone.</p>

    <p>Select a corner location.</p>

    <p>Snap your fingers.</p>

    <p>Let time stop.</p>

    <p>Then he quickly finished what was on his plate...</p>

    <p>Snap your fingers again. Restore the flow of time and return to the classroom.</p>

    <p>In this way, Wang Ling will not feel uncomfortable being watched while eating. And eating will never waste time.</p>

    <p>This trick is very useful.</p>

    <p>Sometimes if I am too lazy to do my homework at night.</p>

    <p>You can also take your homework to school in the morning. Use it to write down your homework.</p>

    <p>Not just for myself. It also applies to Father Wang.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, Father Wang really can't catch up with the update. He will also ask Wang Ling to use a time-stop function to freeze the time temporarily.</p>

    <p>And this is one of the main reasons why Father Wang has been updating without any hindrance for many years.</p>

    <p>You never know what's behind an online writer who can continuously publish hits.</p>

    <p>Maybe boxes and boxes of anti-baldness hair growth serum.</p>

    <p>Or maybe... he has a son who knows how to stop time...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong is being strengthened here. However, the matter of confirming identities through cross-examination does not seem very reliable to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>After all, external intervention is still needed.</p>

    <p>There is nothing the modern world of cultivation can do about this. But there is a corresponding magic weapon in King's Pants.</p>

    <p>He took out a bronze mirror. This mirror was called the "Eternal Beauty Mirror." It was the magic weapon of chaos held by an empress from the Eternal Period.</p>

    <p>It is said to be a beauty mirror. But in fact, it does not make a person beautiful if it reflects it. Instead, it directly reflects their appearance without makeup.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked in the mirror. He found that he in the mirror had not changed much from his original appearance. He pointed the mirror at Er Ha. He found that Er Ha's dog hair was still the same green...</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "I understand. So I'll just take a mirror to the Office of Strategic Deception and give it to the people at the Office of Strategic Deception to try it out. But the number of these beauty mirrors is too small. I'm afraid it might be troublesome to detect. And if there's too much noise, it's easy to scare someone off."</p>

    <p>"Hmm." Wang Ling nodded.</p>

    <p>This is indeed a problem.</p>

    <p>So now for the first round, he decided to just conduct a preliminary test on the core members of the Office of Strategic Deception. Make sure there are no problems with the senior management before talking.</p>

    <p>As for the scarcity of beauty mirrors, that would be easy to handle.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling opened King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>Select the beauty mirror in his hand. Er Ha saw ctrl+C appear on his left eye. ctrl+V appeared on his right eye.</p>

    <p>Then a new beauty mirror was successfully copied...</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha was stunned. Then he swallowed the copied sack of beauty mirrors without surprise: "For testing. I need to find some helpers."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling spreads his hands, indicating to Er Ha that he can choose as he pleases.</p>

    <p>And Er Ha's thinking is also very clear.</p>

    <p>He almost immediately focused on Xiang Yi and Qin Zhong.</p>

    <p>These two young men are perfect for being used as assistants.</p>
