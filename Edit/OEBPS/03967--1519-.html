  <h1>Chapter 1519 Houlang Sang. It's mine</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Room 704, Boys' Dormitory Building, Jiudaohe District S.</p>

    <p>This is the current location of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming went to find Zhai Yin to sleep at night. He left Wang Ling alone in the empty room...</p>

    <p>In fact, to Wang Ling, being alone is nothing.</p>

    <p>He has long been used to it.</p>

    <p>In fact.</p>

    <p>The moment Ma Jiao entered the corridor. Wang Ling had already noticed Ma Jiao's existence.</p>

    <p>There is no doubt that this girl is a cruel person. She actually interpreted Wang Ming's "hide" as meaning to kill him.</p>

    <p>This hard-core underworld faction style has a Zhai Xing Group style.</p>

    <p>It's just that Wang Ling is still unclear. Whether Ma Jiao has a definite relationship with Zhai Xing Group.</p>

    <p>Tonight, I'm afraid I really can't stop.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed silently.</p>

    <p>He turned his gaze to the door of the room.</p>

    <p>Listening to Ma Jiao.</p>

    <p>And.</p>

    <p>The footsteps of another group of people plotting against him...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>By the time Ma Jiao got on the elevator, she already felt that something was wrong.</p>

    <p>Although the elevator looked empty.</p>

    <p>But Ma Jiao can be sure that there are two other people in this space.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid some invisible magic weapon or spell was used.</p>

    <p>Late at night, he appeared sneakily in the elevator of the boys' dormitory... Who is this person?</p>

    <p>Are there still idiots who steal boys' underwear these days?</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao pretended to be calm.</p>

    <p>The moment she judged that there were other people in the elevator, she quickly pressed the elevator button for the third floor.</p>

    <p>Wait for the elevator door to open when it reaches the third floor.</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao took a step forward.</p>

    <p>Then he quickly connected a suction cup head to the elevator button using a stethoscope data cable. A hacker retrieval plug-in was implanted in the mobile phone.</p>

    <p>Finally, Ma Jiao detected it.</p>

    <p>About 10 seconds ago, before she entered the elevator, someone pressed the elevator button to the seventh floor.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid I realized that I was about to enter the elevator, so I immediately hid myself and then canceled the button.</p>

    <p>And this point can also be well verified by the elevator that is still rising.</p>

    <p>There was obviously no one in the elevator, but the elevator still went up.</p>

    <p>It stands to reason that no one else would be using the elevator at this time.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is...</p>

    <p>This group of people actually chose to go to the 7th floor?</p>

    <p>Isn't that the dormitory where Houlang Sang lives?</p>

    <p>Could it be someone from the Rainbow Seven Gang? Did they sneak in here secretly?</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao thinks it is possible.</p>

    <p>After spending a few seconds to check the elevator buttons, Ma Jiao implanted a "turtle speed rise" plug-in into the elevator.</p>

    <p>Then set off quickly.</p>

    <p>Using the student union's command card, I unlocked the access control of the corridor one after another. The corridor leads to the seventh floor.</p>

    <p>This is the unique curfew rule of Jiudaohe High School. Once the curfew starts, all corridors will be closed to prevent students from visiting each other through the corridors.</p>

    <p>But for Ma Jiao who has a permission card, she can come and go as she pleases.</p>

    <p>Now thinking about it carefully, Ma Jiao felt that this was probably the reason why these two people chose to take the elevator.</p>

    <p>Because forcibly breaking through the corridor restrictions may trigger an alarm.</p>

    <p>In comparison, the elevator may be safer.</p>

    <p>Even if there is a floor lock, it can be easily unlocked by anyone who knows how to operate it.</p>

    <p>But for Ma Jiao who has a permission card, she can come and go as she pleases.</p>

    <p>The "turtle speed rise" plug-in is extremely easy to use.</p>

    <p>It bought a lot of time for Ma Jiao's next step.</p>

    <p>When Ma Jiao walked up the corridor to the seventh floor, the elevator still lingered on the fifth floor.</p>

    <p>In the public toilet cubicle on the 7th floor. Ma Jiao applied invisible potion on herself.</p>

    <p>Then, a miniature eavesdropping device the size of a grain of rice was quickly stuck on the hidden position of the door handle of every room on the 7th floor.</p>

    <p>Although Ma Jiao had a premonition, she was not sure whether this group of people came for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Therefore, it would be relatively more robust to stick a listening device on the door handle of each room.</p>

    <p>Everything is ready.</p>

    <p>As soon as the two got out of the elevator, Ma Jiao heard clear communication in the toilet cubicle.</p>

    <p>"Why does this elevator suddenly rise so slowly?"</p>

    <p>"Who knows."</p>

    <p>"Speaking of which, do you think there is something wrong with that girl just now?"</p>

    <p>"Impossible. What problems can she be in the foundation building period?"</p>

    <p>"That's true. But I'm afraid this girl is not a decent girl, what kind of decent girl goes to a boys' dormitory in the middle of the night?"</p>

    <p>"Hey... the little girl now is really bold."</p>

    <p>Because there are monitoring devices attached to each handle.</p>

    <p>The two walked along. Ma Jiao heard all the conversations clearly.</p>

    <p>The pace is approaching.</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao heard. The two men finally stopped in front of the door of Room 704.</p>

    <p>"Are you really here for Houlang Sang?" At this moment, the expression on Ma Jiao's face was cold.</p>

    <p>Judge by the sound.</p>

    <p>These two people are about middle-aged. They are definitely not students of Jiudaohe High School. There is a social atmosphere in their tone.</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao was sure that she heard correctly.</p>

    <p>Two people who don't belong to the society inside the school. What are they doing here?</p>

    <p>Just when Ma Jiao was confused.</p>

    <p>The next round of conversation between the two caught Ma Jiao's attention again.</p>

    <p>"704. This is it."</p>

    <p>"That's right. Master Jiugong asked us to kidnap these two students named Wang. This is the best opportunity."</p>

    <p>"No. There seems to be only one person in this dormitory..."</p>

    <p>"What should we do? Do we want to evacuate? If we take action now, if we only kidnap one person, the other person will definitely arouse vigilance."</p>

    <p>"No. Tonight's operation must be carried out. We have no time. We must take a gamble! What if the kidnapped boy named Wang is the one Miss Sun likes? Just give it a try. The bicycle becomes Motorcycle."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>I see. Are you trying to kidnap him?</p>

    <p>And it seems to be related to the Jiugong family.</p>

    <p>In the toilet cubicle. At this moment, the expression on Ma Jiao's face was particularly gloomy.</p>

    <p>After she received this information.</p>

    <p>His mind was also rapidly sorting out logical thoughts.</p>

    <p>1:These two men were sent by the Jiugongs. And it's obvious. They want to target Mr. Houlang and Mr. Xiao Er.</p>

    <p>2: The task given to her by Old V is to hide Houlang Sang. But obviously, kidnapping cannot completely hide Houlang Sang.</p>

    <p>3: Although the purpose of these two people is to attack Houlang Sang, their purpose is completely different from hers.</p>

    <p>Summary: These two people will do bad things! They will definitely interfere with the tasks assigned to her by Senior V.</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, Ma Jiao couldn't hold it in any longer and walked out of the cubicle with a bit of fierceness in her eyes.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, the two people sent by Jiugong Xiushi were still working on picking the lock at the door of Wang Ling's dormitory room.</p>

    <p>Their movements were very gentle. They were afraid of disturbing Wang Ling inside.</p>

    <p>But something unexpected happened to them.</p>

    <p>While they were concentrating on picking the lock, a ghostly figure suddenly appeared behind them.</p>

    <p>It was the weird girl in the elevator before!</p>

    <p>I saw Ma Jiao's eyes showing the expression of an eagle staring at its prey.</p>

    <p>She raised the corners of her lips and smiled solemnly: "Houlang Sang. It's mine..."</p>

    <p>As soon as she finished speaking, the knives on the girl's left and right hands instantly stabbed into their bodies.</p>

    <p>"On Golden Core..."</p>

    <p>At this time, the two people showed incredible expressions of fear.</p>
