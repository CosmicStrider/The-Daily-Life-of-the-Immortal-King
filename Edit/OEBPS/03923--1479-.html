  <h1>Chapter 1479 Jiang Yingying! Danger!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The tattooed man's situation was even more tragic than everyone imagined. The dragon's horns were a bit long, causing the tattooed man's butt to be penetrated directly.</p>

    <p>And because the angle of the dragon's horns is too tricky.</p>

    <p>Everyone couldn't help but sigh in their hearts. I'm afraid this is the legendary "Egg Ball Rinpo"...</p>

    <p>The dragon's head, which had been bald, suddenly grew two pairs of horns. He punished this scumbag in front of everyone.</p>

    <p>Such a scene cannot be said to be unpleasant.</p>

    <p>And such a mysterious phenomenon also alarmed many people in the venue.</p>

    <p>Many materialists originally did not believe in such things as making wishes. But now that they have seen this scene with their own eyes, they all threw their own coins at Dragon and made wishes devoutly.</p>

    <p>Thus, the second wish-making ceremony began.</p>

    <p>The scene was completely silent. Everyone put their hands together, faced Dragon, and closed their eyes in prayer.</p>

    <p>But no one called an ambulance...</p>

    <p>The tattooed man lay on the ground with his butt sticking out. His face was white with pain. However, he had no energy left to speak.</p>

    <p>As for the girl he coerced into becoming his girlfriend, she had already left the scene.</p>

    <p>Tattooed man's buttocks were pierced by dragon horns.</p>

    <p>Although there is a reason why Wang Ling cast the spell, this is not something Wang Ling planned in advance. It is purely an accident.</p>

    <p>Evil people will have their own trials and tribulations. Retribution from heaven will come sooner or later...</p>

    <p>So sometimes, people can't be too bottomless.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Jiugong Liangzi's resentment has begun to spread...</p>

    <p>It turns out that women's sixth sense is really scary</p>

    <p>What's more, Jiugong Liangzi's sixth sense is naturally extremely accurate.</p>

    <p>At the same time, this is also the tag that has been ignored by Zhuo Yi...</p>

    <p>An inexplicable anger surged into Jiugong Liangzi's heart.</p>

    <p>Sure enough. It's easy to change a country, but it's hard to change one's nature.</p>

    <p>Old liar or old liar...</p>

    <p>We agreed to go to the toilet!</p>

    <p>How did you end up here?</p>

    <p>Moreover, she was actually holding the hand of Sun Rong, whom she had always regarded as her opponent!</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi tried to calm down, because if she seemed angry now, it meant that she actually cared.</p>

    <p>She didn't want to show her menstrual disorder in front of this old liar.</p>

    <p>So, the girl's eyes narrowed slightly, and while using the fan in her hand as a cover, she followed secretly from behind.</p>

    <p>As the saying goes, you can take advantage of others. To catch an adulterer is...</p>

    <p>No. Strictly speaking, this doesn't seem to be catching an adulterer.</p>

    <p>This time. It's just to find evidence that Zhuo Yi was absent without permission.</p>

    <p>As a bodyguard, he actually used two different things in the name of going to the toilet... It's really too much!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was held by Zhuo Yi all the way. It wasn't until they got out of the crowd that Zhuo Yi let go of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>There is too much traffic. It is actually a gentlemanly behavior to take the girl forward.</p>

    <p>The main reason is that Sun Rong and Zhuo Yi are already very familiar with each other. So there are no strange thoughts or ideas between them.</p>

    <p>Of course. If the person pulling Sun Rong at this time is Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>That would be different...</p>

    <p>The distance away from the crowd is only about ten meters. It is enough for Sun Rong to write a 100,000-word romance book in his head.</p>

    <p>"Zhuo Yi Senior, do you feel that it's a little cold?" As they walked along, Sun Rong suddenly felt something was wrong.</p>

    <p>"I really didn't expect that there were so many people today. It must be because we were away from the crowd..." Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>Mainly because I just watched the fountain show inside. People were crowded together. It was indeed a bit stuffy.</p>

    <p>"Come with me. Master is still there." Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>He has nothing else on his mind now. He just wants to take his "wife" there as soon as possible and then quickly return to Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>The direction they are going now is actually the direction of the toilet.</p>

    <p>The round trip time is calculated by Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>It's a pity that there was an episode about the tattooed man just now, which delayed a little time.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, he would have brought the girl here long ago.</p>

    <p>The two of them moved forward.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi followed secretly all the way. She knew that Zhuo Yi could feel her breath, so she didn't dare to get too close. She just observed the movement in front of her from a distance.</p>

    <p>And just in the middle of this, Sun Rong suddenly stopped: "Zhuo Yi Senior, did you hear anything? I seem to hear someone talking about me..."</p>

    <p>"No way."</p>

    <p>Following closely, Zhuo Yi also stopped in his tracks.</p>

    <p>"It's the sound coming from the southeast." Sun Rong frowned slightly.</p>

    <p>He carefully distinguished the sound and finally confirmed the direction of the sound - it came from Number 2, Xiu Zhen Cultivation Street.</p>

    <p>And the voice obviously came from a mobile phone.</p>

    <p>It's a person who is communicating through a mobile phone. With the person on the mobile phone.</p>

    <p>"When exactly are we going to send the ransom note?"</p>

    <p>"Don't worry yet. Miss Sun is a valuable piece of meat. Watch her carefully. We will be there soon. I don't know how much the Huaguo Shuilian Group is willing to spend to redeem her. Haha."</p>

    <p>"What should I do with this kid who was caught together?"</p>

    <p>"Did you see your faces?"</p>

    <p>"I saw it."</p>

    <p>At this time, the voice of the man on the phone suddenly became gloomy: "There is no other way. Find someone to take him to a place where no one is around. Kill him. Deal with it cleanly."</p>

    <p>"learn..."</p>

    <p>At this point, the call ends.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"I...I was caught?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong and Zhuo Yi are both confused.</p>

    <p>The kidnappers with unknown origins did not expect that their conversation would be heard clearly by Sun Rong, who was standing several hundred meters away from them.</p>

    <p>Amplifying the sense of listening is actually a very uncomfortable thing, because there will be all kinds of sounds entering the ears.</p>

    <p>In fact, this is an instinctive conditioned reflex.</p>

    <p>The girl had heard this title Miss Sun many times, so she naturally reacted.</p>

    <p>At first she thought someone was talking about her, and she amplified her sense of hearing out of curiosity.</p>

    <p>As a result, after this trial, Sun Rong found that he seemed to know something incredible.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi frowned. He suddenly thought of something: "I think they may have captured the wrong person..."</p>

    <p>"By the way! It's classmate Jiang!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong soon realized: "My classmate Jiang is indeed somewhat similar to me..."</p>

    <p>"Then there's nothing wrong with that."</p>

    <p>At this time. Zhuo Yi opened his eyes: "I know. Today my classmate Jiang came here with brother Wei Zhi. But now the breath of the two of them has disappeared. They must have been locked up by these kidnappers. place."</p>

    <p>"Then what should we do now..." Sun Rong was a little anxious.</p>

    <p>"There is nothing we can do. Sun Rong, please go and meet Master. Leave this matter to me." At this time, Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>The situation was critical. He was about to leave. At this moment, the girl grabbed him and said, "Senior, wait!"</p>

    <p>"Have something to explain?"</p>

    <p>"I think it's up to me to handle this matter." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>Although because Jiang Yingying kept getting close to Wang Ling, she actually didn't like this girl very much.</p>

    <p>But if it is because of his own relationship, he will be put in danger.</p>

    <p>This is not what Sun Rong wants to see.</p>

    <p>Since this group of kidnappers came for her from the beginning, then as long as she passes by, maybe these people will give up harming Jiang Yingying and Wei Zhi.</p>

    <p>Anyway, these kidnappers probably can't hurt her...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was silent for a few seconds. In the end, he respected the girl's opinion and said, "Okay. Then, junior fellow student, be careful. I'll leave the matter to you regarding Jiang Yingying! Master, I will explain the situation to him."</p>

    <p>"I'll be back soon!" Sun Rong nodded. Then he quickly ran towards the direction he heard earlier.</p>

    <p>The Hanfu, as bright as the moonlight, danced gently. When Zhuo Yi came back to his senses, there was only a touching silhouette of a girl left in front of him...</p>

    <p>However, at this time. Zhuo Yi found that the surrounding air seemed to have become colder.</p>

    <p>Just behind him, Jiugong Liangzi secretly squinted at him from a distance.</p>

    <p>The resentment emanating was frozen three feet away. It made people afraid to approach it at all.</p>

    <p>Does the child have a lot of question marks? Jiugong Liangzi doesn't know.</p>

    <p>But now she is.</p>

    <p>There are indeed many question marks.</p>

    <p>She wanted to know who Jiang Yingying was...</p>

    <p>Listen to the tone of Zhuo Yi. It sounds like a classmate. She should also be a girl studying at Number 60 High School?</p>

    <p>Ha. A liar is still a liar after all...</p>

    <p>In the course of watching a fountain show. He hooked up with three schoolgirls in a row... Shame on you!</p>

    <p>"Big liar!" At this time, Jiugong Liangzi finally couldn't bear it anymore and shouted angrily at the back of Zhuo Yi in the distance.</p>
