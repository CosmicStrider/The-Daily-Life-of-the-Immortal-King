  <h1>Chapter 1829 Era Pointer</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling's slender five fingers are as white as jade. Under the violent spiritual light, they release terrifying spiritual pressure. The surroundings are filled with immortal energy. Holy light shines everywhere. It envelopes this Heavenly City and also envelopes dozens of buildings. The hanging palace of the outer gods...</p>

    <p>With the naked eye, you can clearly detect that these pitch-black palaces of outer gods are beginning to transform. They seem to be coated with a layer of gold paint. They transform from pitch-black to gold, gradually assimilating with this Heavenly City.</p>

    <p>This annexing power is too strong. The terrifying spiritual pressure vibrates violently, crushing everything.</p>

    <p>As the palms of Wang Ling condensed, the speed at which the dark palace of the Outer Gods was being annexed gradually increased.</p>

    <p>Gui Laoliu was shocked again. He originally wanted to use these palaces of outer gods to compete with Wang Ling in this world of heavens. However, he did not expect that his behavior would actually give Wang Ling a big gift.</p>

    <p>He raised his hand in an instant. The mixed-blood ancient god behind him formed seals with him, resisting desperately, trying to withdraw the palaces of these outer gods.</p>

    <p>Once the Palace of Outer Gods is assimilated again, this world of heavens will receive new expansion and become more powerful than before.</p>

    <p>Md<sup>1</sup>...</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>("妈的" "Ma de" translates to "Oh shit." It is often used in internet language)</dfn>

    <p>He couldn't even beat it!</p>

    <p>Gui Laoliu couldn't help cursing in his heart. He rarely uttered bad words. As one of the six supreme protectors of the Holy Clan, he never speculated on earth's cultivators with the greatest malice. However, he never thought that earth's cultivators could be so strong that he cursed.</p>

    <p>But even at this point, he didn't think he had no chance of winning.</p>

    <p>Because for the saints who attach great importance to the power of blood, no matter how strong a cultivator on earth is, he still has his own limitations.</p>

    <p>Cultivation has its origins in ancient times. Although it was created by human cultivators, the major races in the universe have different bloodlines. Some races with the power of rare bloodlines are often more talented in cultivation than the human cultivators on earth.</p>

    <p>Gui Laoliu has seen many scenes since he has been alive for eternity. Although he is the youngest among the six guardians and the youngest in seniority, he is recognized as a genius among the saints. The power of blood in his body is evenly distributed. He is known as The proud son of the Holy Clan with the "golden ratio."</p>

    <p>Even during daily practice, he follows the Holy King. During sparring, he has the other five guardians as his sparring partners. It is not an exaggeration to call him the favorite of the group.</p>

    <p>In the eyes of the Saint people, Gui Laoliu is the type who gets stronger as he fights. And he is a person who gets stronger when he encounters strength. This time he faced Wang Ling. Even though he faced the endless consequences brought by Wang Ling oppression.</p>

    <p>The rest of the Saints who were watching the battle also had no doubt that Gui Laoliu would get a new breakthrough in this battle and move towards a higher level.</p>

    <p>At this time, he was trying his best to compete with Wang Ling for the sovereignty of the Palace of the Outer Gods. For no other reason than to fight for a breath!</p>

    <p>He summoned it himself. It would be too embarrassing if Wang Ling took it away like this.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Gui Laoliu held back all his strength. During the fight with Wang Ling, he even turned red in the face. The mixed-race ancient god behind him was assimilated with his expression. Both of them wore "pain Mask." It looks very artistic.</p>

    <p>In contrast, Wang Ling maintained a calm posture from beginning to end. He stood in the void, with his school uniform fluttering in the wind.</p>

    <p>The five fingers that slowly closed were stretched open by the pressure exerted by Gui Laoliu from time to time. Then Wang Ling regained the dominance and closed it. It was like arm wrestling with Gui Laoliu.</p>

    <p>"What is this son doing?" Guo Hao looked at this scene from a distance and frowned.</p>

    <p>"What else can he do... just play." Chen Chao could no longer complain. He clearly felt that Wang Ling still had a lot of room to spare.</p>

    <p>But he has not chosen to end the game. The purpose is obvious. It is to "torture" the ghost in front of him.</p>

    <p>Looking back now, Chen Chao feels that the original shadow stream was too childish. How can a normal human cultivator on earth be the opponent of this "perverted" in front of him!</p>

    <p>It was not easy to find a strong person in the universe. It seemed normal to show off their skills. Moreover, delaying for so long was actually beneficial to their own practice.</p>

    <p>"You are worthy of your Majesty. While you are playing, are you still thinking of us?" At this time, Guo Hao suddenly felt a little moved. He said: "Such an opportunity to watch the battle at close range is rare. We may not be able to have it in our lifetime. This kind of experience and watching is beneficial to our own practice! Do you think so? Boss Sun?"</p>

    <p>"Ah... yes! You are right! It is indeed very helpful for our practice!" Sun Rong showed her signature fake smile. Then she held her forehead, with a helpless look on her face.</p>

    <p>This is too much imagination. Obviously Guo Hao's thinking is very serious... Although observing the battles of upper-level cultivators will indeed help the cultivation of lower-level cultivators. But if the immortal king shield is canceled after this, they will not remember anything. There's no way to figure it out!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at Gui Laoliu, who had exhausted all his strength. They were in a stalemate for about a few minutes. After confirming that Gui Laoliu had no more energy, he decided to end the game in front of him.</p>

    <p>He effortlessly clenched his palms tightly. At that moment, the pitch-black palaces of the outer gods were assimilated and transformed into gold, becoming part of the buildings of all nations in Heavenly City.</p>

    <p>When the link to the Palace of the Outer Gods was broken, Gui Laoliu immediately spat out a large mouthful of blood. This backlash of pain directly connected to his nerves, making him feel extremely shaken at the same moment.</p>

    <p>"You're kidding me..."</p>

    <p>Then he gritted his teeth and stared at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Even if Wang Ling didn't say anything, Gui Laoliu could still feel that Wang Ling just pretended to be "arm wrestling" with him vigorously. In fact, he was basically teasing him!</p>

    <p>He obviously had the strength to end the game quickly, but it was like teasing a monkey, giving him the illusion that he could regain the Palace of the Outer Gods.</p>

    <p>"I will never let you go!" Gui Laoliu was so angry that he was shaking all over. After the palace of the outer gods was taken away, he immediately swallowed a bright glass elixir to suppress his injuries. At the same time, he released streams of chaotic energy from his hands.</p>

    <p>This is a weird seal. It made Wang Ling frown at the same time. Gui Laoliu moved quickly. The seals explained a strange truth between the changes. There were many kinds that even Wang Ling had never seen before. The great avenues merged together on this strange seal of Gui Laoliu.</p>

    <p>Then bang!</p>

    <p>Gui Laoliu and the mixed-blood ancient god behind him put their palms together. In an instant, the world turned upside down. In the center of Gui Laoliu's palm, a magical ball of light was summoned!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared with the King's Eyes. Through the light curtain of the light ball, he saw this summoning magic weapon wrapped in endless charm.</p>

    <p>He was surprised.</p>

    <p>Because among all the people Wang Ling has met so far.</p>

    <p>This is the only person who has achieved the fifth level of Chaos Sequence!</p>

    <p>Level 5: Creation-level Chaos Device...Era Pointer.</p>
