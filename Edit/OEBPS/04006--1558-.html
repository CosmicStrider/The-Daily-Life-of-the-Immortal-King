  <h1>Chapter 1558 Charity Donation</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Sakai Toyotoshi had no idea that things would take a turn for the better...</p>

    <p>As we all know, the so-called Gray Cult is actually the support club of Houlang Sang.</p>

    <p>Previously, Sakai Toyotoshi was troubled by the power of Peach wood branch, which made him have the idea of joining Gray Cult.</p>

    <p>It's just that Sakai Toyotoshi didn't expect the sudden operation in his heart.</p>

    <p>The family actually got such a huge order for nothing.</p>

    <p>After all, the Sakai family are businessmen.</p>

    <p>Even if that pot of purple cherry blossoms is inherited from ancestors, it is priceless.</p>

    <p>But in the end it's only worth 500 million.</p>

    <p>But now, what the Sakai family has obtained is an order of 2 billion and subsequent long-term cooperation.</p>

    <p>Whether this deal is a good deal or not can be calculated with your toes.</p>

    <p>In the evening of that day, Father Sakai held a celebration banquet at his home.</p>

    <p>During the entire celebration banquet, Sakai Toyotoshi was not only happy, but naturally he was also thinking about this matter.</p>

    <p>This time the behavior of the Huaguo Shuilian Group would be difficult to explain clearly without the support of Miss Sun.</p>

    <p>So why did Miss Sun do that?</p>

    <p>Because he fulfilled his promise. And determined to join Gray Cult and support Houlang Sang?</p>

    <p>Intuitively speaking.</p>

    <p>Sakai Toyotoshi feels that Sun Rong likes Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But now. Here comes the problem...</p>

    <p>What was going on in that scene in front of the tree house at noon?</p>

    <p>I obviously like Miss Sun Rong of Wang Ling. Why are I hugging that Wang Xiaoer again...</p>

    <p>After Sakai Toyotoshi sorted out the logic in his head, he was instantly shocked.</p>

    <p>--Here I go! It turns out this is a triangle relationship!</p>

    <p>"Son, what's wrong? You are the hero today. Why don't you look so good?" Father Sakai looked at the pale Sakai Toyotoshi and asked with concern.</p>

    <p>This time. He really didn't expect it.</p>

    <p>He has always failed to live up to expectations and is extremely vain.</p>

    <p>He actually relied on this operation to win the favor of Miss Sun.</p>

    <p>Won such a large order for the family.</p>

    <p>While Naru Sakai was very pleased, he was also moved by the growth of Sakai Toyotoshi.</p>

    <p>He had to admit that this time, Naru Sakai walked in front of him...</p>

    <p>"Dad. I'm fine." Sakai Toyotoshi said. He wiped his sweat with the hot towel handed by the servant. Then he asked: "Dad... I have something to ask you."</p>

    <p>"Say." Naru Sakai said.</p>

    <p>"If I know something about Miss Sun..."</p>

    <p>"Stop it."</p>

    <p>To Sakai Toyotoshi's surprise, he was cut off by his father before he could finish speaking.</p>

    <p>Father Sakai took a sip of sake. He chuckled and said, "Although the conditions of our Sakai family are not bad, if we compare them with the Huaguo Shuilian Group, the gap is still very obvious."</p>

    <p>"Sometimes, don't judge something based on your own guesses. Otherwise, you will put yourself in a very dangerous situation."</p>

    <p>"As long as it doesn't harm the interests of our Sakai family, it's not bad to be a fool."</p>

    <p>"You just need to know that Miss Sun has a good impression of that Houlang Sang. That's enough."</p>

    <p>"In the days to come, learn more from that Houlang Sang. Try to get closer."</p>

    <p>"Other matters. Don't say more. Don't make random guesses. Don't talk nonsense."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>These words were like a revelation, instantly awakening Sakai Toyotoshi.</p>

    <p>Yes...</p>

    <p>Many things were actually just wishful thinking on his part.</p>

    <p>What his father said was absolutely correct.</p>

    <p>Now he just needs to know that Miss Sun has a good impression of Houlang Sang. That's enough...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It's still early evening on Friday, December 18th.</p>

    <p>While the celebration party was held at Sakai Toyotoshi's house, Jisaki was also summarizing the achievements after this exchange meeting in the student union office.</p>

    <p>First of all, the most difficult Rainbow Seven Gang. After this exchange meeting, it was confirmed that it has been completely conquered.</p>

    <p>In addition, Lan Mao and Ohno Dankaede secretly lead the relationship. Many people who meet the requirements have chosen to join Gray Cult.</p>

    <p>Even Jisaki himself didn't expect it.</p>

    <p>Jiudaohe High School has been divided for so many years due to student party competition. It actually became a whole again because of Houlang Sang...</p>

    <p>Now. Whether it's Jiudaohe's student union or the original Rainbow Seven Gang.</p>

    <p>All belong to the Jiudaohe Gray Cult branch.</p>

    <p>And almost all S-level students have joined the Jiudaohe Gray Cult branch.</p>

    <p>This is undoubtedly an unprecedented thing.</p>

    <p>Gray Cult!</p>

    <p>Jiudaohe has been completely occupied!</p>

    <p>In the follow-up, he will apply to the school in the name of the president of the student union and the head of the Jiudaohe Gray Cult branch to cancel the student grading system.</p>

    <p>This system, which is full of chains of contempt and has given rise to all kinds of school violence and bullying, should have been banned long ago!</p>

    <p>Everyone has their own shining points and strengths.</p>

    <p>Since we are all students of the same school, we should understand the principle of mutual prosperity and loss.</p>

    <p>Jisaki feels that he realized this from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Look at Number 60 High School this time...</p>

    <p>Isn't it a closely united group represented by the mascot Wang Ling?</p>

    <p>"As expected of Houlang Sang!"</p>

    <p>Jisaki found that he admired Wang Ling more and more.</p>

    <p>Although Houlang Sang has no words, every action seems to have a profound meaning. People can learn a lot...</p>

    <p>Besides.</p>

    <p>There are two more results from this exchange meeting.</p>

    <p>The first thing is naturally the promotional video for the account "Jiudaohe Gray Cult Branch" on Station B.</p>

    <p>The gimmick of the seven-wheeled purple cherry blossoms blooming out of season attracted a lot of attention. It triggered a large number of reposts. Now the number of coins in the video has exceeded 30,000, and the number of views is approaching one million.</p>

    <p>This is undoubtedly explosive data.</p>

    <p>The second thing is the new decision made by Jisaki after discussing with Sun Rong regarding the pot of "Eight-Run Purple Sakura."</p>

    <p>Because Wang Ling doesn't like this thing either.</p>

    <p>So Jisaki and Sun Rong decided after discussing it. They planned to sell this priceless pot of "Eight-Run Purple Sakura" in the name of Gray Cult, and then donate it to charity.</p>

    <p>Sun Island. No student organization can donate 500 million in a short period of time...</p>

    <p>This matter also attracted a lot of attention after Jisaki publicly announced it using the account "Jiudaohe Gray Cult Branch."</p>

    <p>There were many media interviews.</p>

    <p>However, they were all rejected by Jisaki.</p>

    <p>As an attitude-oriented literary exchange organization built with students as a group, low-key is the core of Gray Cult.</p>

    <p>Of course, he, the head of the branch, would not make such a mistake easily.</p>

    <p>Everything is developing for the better.</p>

    <p>At the beginning, Jisaki had decided to promote Gray Cult on Sun Island.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, his goal achieved such great results in such a short period of time.</p>

    <p>And just when Jisaki was sighing in his position as student council president.</p>

    <p>At this time, Ma Jiao suddenly pushed open the door and walked in: "President, it's not good!"</p>

    <p>"What's going on?" Jisaki asked, looking at Ma Jiao's panicked expression.</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao handed over a document wrapped in red letter paper.</p>

    <p>When Jisaki saw this document, his heart trembled instantly.</p>

    <p>Because. This is a warning letter from Jiudaohe Academic Affairs Department...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Warning?</p>

    <p>Although Jisaki didn't expect this to happen.</p>

    <p>But the moment he saw the warning letter, he was still stunned.</p>

    <p>"Sure enough...it's just like Brother Xiaoer said. There's still no way to escape from school." Jisaki sighed.</p>

    <p>For so many years. Jiudaohe High School ranks among the best in Sun Island.</p>

    <p>School leaders have always attributed this achievement to the internal competition between students in Jiudaohe.</p>

    <p>They believe that only constant competition can make their students stronger.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the leaders of Jiudaohe High School also turn a blind eye to some campus bullying behaviors caused by the general environment.</p>

    <p>As long as the school ranks high, they won't bother to manage the things below.</p>

    <p>What if students have psychological problems?</p>

    <p>That's because your mental quality is too poor.</p>

    <p>Anyway, Jiudaohe has a last-place elimination mechanism.</p>

    <p>Just order him to drop out of school.</p>

    <p>And now. The student gang competition mechanism that has been pursued for so many years.</p>

    <p>Now it was suddenly broken by an inexplicable "Gray Cult."</p>

    <p>Of course, this is something that the school leaders of Jiudaohe cannot tolerate.</p>

    <p>This "warning letter" is actually an explicit threat.</p>

    <p>I mainly wrote about two things.</p>

    <p>The first thing is the decision to suspend the position of Jisaki Student Union President.</p>

    <p>The second thing is to ask Jisaki to immediately disband the Jiudaohe Gray Cult branch.</p>

    <p>Otherwise.</p>

    <p>I want Jisaki to drop out of school directly.</p>

    <p>"President, what should we do now?" Ma Jiao asked, frowning.</p>

    <p>"Just treat it as waste paper. We must not mess up our situation." Jisaki said.</p>

    <p>As he said before.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming long before this warning letter was issued. Even if it comes, this will happen.</p>

    <p>What should we do if the leaders of Jiudaohe come out to oppose the establishment of the Gray Cult branch?</p>

    <p>The solution to this problem is actually very simple.</p>

    <p>Jisaki and Wang Ming have already thought about this.</p>

    <p>That is to bring the leaders into Gray Cult...</p>

    <p>...</p>
