  <h1>Chapter 1498 The mysterious Mrs. 6</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Early that morning, the sixth wife of the Jiugong family got up early.</p>

    <p>After simply combing her hair, the charming sixth lady did not put on any makeup and quietly left through the back door of Jiugong's house with only two accompanying maids.</p>

    <p>Worshiping the Buddha requires sincerity. Meeting the Buddha without makeup is actually a sign of respect.</p>

    <p>The back door is located right on the road from the Buddhist temple where Mrs. Six is going, and it won't disturb other people.</p>

    <p>Therefore, every time when worshiping Buddha, the Sixth Lady must start from the back door.</p>

    <p>Yingxian Heming has arranged everything.</p>

    <p>He arranged for a black car belonging to the Jiugong family to park at the back door.</p>

    <p>It was already two hours later when we officially arrived at "Tianxuan Buddhist Temple."</p>

    <p>The scene in front of the Buddhist temple surprised the two maids behind Madam Six.</p>

    <p>The riveted doorway of the Buddhist temple is open. The stone lion head kowtows above and the surrounding stone walls together show the mottled flavor of the years.</p>

    <p>The murals on the stone walls have been exposed to wind and rain all year round. Although the color has long been dull, they still have a sense of simplicity and the times.</p>

    <p>Tianxuan Buddhist Temple is the most famous Buddhist temple in Dongfu. On weekdays, even in the early morning, the pilgrims who come to visit have already passed the threshold.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xinghui arrived here at seven o'clock with two maids.</p>

    <p>Under the preparation of Yingxian Heming, the Jiugong family and the Zhai Xing Group jointly cleared the area and blocked all roads leading to the Buddhist temple.</p>

    <p>One hour of worship time was reserved for the Sixth Lady only.</p>

    <p>Along the stone wall of the Buddhist temple, a member of the "Zhai Xing Group" stands every three meters.</p>

    <p>These people are dressed in uniform light blue monks' simple attire. They are equipped with Buddhist beads. They are specifically responsible for the safety and order of the Six Madams during their worship.</p>

    <p>Add up the number of people. There are hundreds of people.</p>

    <p>And this kind of formation is the basic operation every time the Sixth Madam goes out to worship Buddha.</p>

    <p>Other pilgrims could not come in. Although they complained in their hearts, they did not dare to express anything with their mouths.</p>

    <p>The face of the Jiugong family and Zhai Xing Group. They have to give...</p>

    <p>In a sense, when these two families come together, their reputation may be much greater than that of Buddha in a Buddhist temple.</p>

    <p>Some people think of themselves as Buddhists for the comfort of their hearts.</p>

    <p>But if you want to live, you still have to be a social person.</p>

    <p>They were all just recruited by the Sixth Madam. They have a very clean background. Jiugong Xinghui is interested in training them.</p>

    <p>"I'm bringing you out today so that you can get used to it in advance."</p>

    <p>Before formally worshiping the Buddha, Jiugong Xinghui glanced at the two of them and said: "Work under my hand. Don't make a fuss about anything. Don't show that you have never seen the world. Do you understand?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. Madam."</p>

    <p>The two maids followed behind, nodding obediently.</p>

    <p>"You two don't need to follow me. Except for the main hall in front of you, the rest of the Buddhist halls will be left to you. Be sure to light three lights in front of each Buddha statue."</p>

    <p>After passing through the courtyard, Jiugong Xinghui took out the incense sticks he had prepared in advance.</p>

    <p>She handed two of the bundles to the maids in her hands and gave instructions.</p>

    <p>The two maids nodded. Each took their own bundle of incense. They started to worship from the side hall on the side.</p>

    <p>Madam Six saw the two people leaving with her peripheral vision. Immediately, a cluster of flames rose from her fingertips, igniting the incense.</p>

    <p>She walked slowly towards the main hall.</p>

    <p>Finally, the figure disappeared through the main door of the main hall...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Did Madam Six go to Tianxuan Temple again?"</p>

    <p>On the other side, Jiugong Xiushi was enjoying breakfast in the cherry garden when he heard the news from Duyan.</p>

    <p>Ordinary people go to worship Buddha. Jiugong Xiushi doesn't care that much.</p>

    <p>But these Sixth Madam, every time they worship Buddha, they do it with great fanfare. They have long made Jiugong Xiushi a little unhappy.</p>

    <p>However, Zhai Xing Group's actions on Sun Island have always been high-profile. This domineering style is actually a consistent style.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xinghui's move seems to be in line with the family tradition of Zhai Xing Group. But as the current obvious opponent, Jiugong Xiushi has actually had doubts about this matter a long time ago.</p>

    <p>He felt that Mrs. Six's behavior every time she went to the Buddhist temple to worship Buddha.</p>

    <p>Seems a little unusual.</p>

    <p>"Do you still remember the burglary that happened at home before Mrs. Six got married?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Jiugong Xiushi frowned and said to One-Eyed Samurai.</p>

    <p>"Of course I remember." One-Eyed Samurai nodded.</p>

    <p>Before he was transferred to become Jiugong Xiushi's personal bodyguard, he also worked part-time as Jiugong's family bodyguard.</p>

    <p>In such a heavily guarded Jiugong home, a burglary occurred. This is really unforgettable.</p>

    <p>"Although at that time, after checking Jiugong's home, nothing was found stolen. We only found signs that the door locks had been picked in several places..."</p>

    <p>At this point, Duyan's eyes darkened and he continued: "But these broken door locks all point to the main sealing place of {Ghost Book} deep underground!"</p>

    <p>"That's right! Although my father also suspected it was a coincidence at first. But these picked locks are really a coincidence."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xiushi was sitting in a wheelchair. He said with a hint of reminiscence: "Our Jiugong home is about the area of ten university campuses. The internal routes are complicated. This has been specially calculated by the formation master. There are a total of 132 buildings. Mansion. Tens of thousands of keyholes."</p>

    <p>"In order to open the passage to the underground seal, you must open forty-nine specific keyholes within that day. And they must be opened in sequence. Just like a dynamic password."</p>

    <p>"The keyholes change every day. Only the father, who holds the order of the head of the family, knows the password. On the day of the theft, there were a total of sixty-eight keyholes with pry marks, and forty-two of them were the ones designated on that day. Mechanical lock."</p>

    <p>Speaking of this, Jiugong Xiushi smiled coldly.</p>

    <p>Where in the world could such a coincidence come from?</p>

    <p>There are 49 locks that change positions every day. On the day of the theft, 42 were hit.</p>

    <p>Although a total of 68 pieces were stolen, I guess this was probably a method used by the thief to cover up the truth.</p>

    <p>"What the young master means is that the Sixth Madam may be related to this attempted burglary?"</p>

    <p>"I don't have direct evidence yet. But I have reason to suspect that the purpose of that woman marrying into our family is most likely for the {Ghost Book} main registration. So I have been asking you to track it down. She went to the Buddhist temple to worship Buddha. thing."</p>

    <p>After Jiugong Xiushi finished speaking, he pondered for a moment and continued.</p>

    <p>"Although since she married into the family, Mrs. Six does appear to be adhering to womanly ways and keeping aloof from the world."</p>

    <p>"But actually, I still think she went to a Buddhist temple to worship on the surface, but secretly she might be planning with the top brass of Zhai Xing Group."</p>

    <p>"But it's a pity that there are no clues about these things so far." One-Eyed Samurai sighed.</p>

    <p>He has actually investigated the Sixth Madam many times, but each time there was no particularly reliable result.</p>

    <p>From the initial burglary attempt, to Mrs. Six marrying into Jiugong's family, and then to Mrs. Six's frequent visits to Buddhist temples to worship now...</p>

    <p>Although there are gaps in the middle clues, in terms of time and coincidence.</p>

    <p>The purpose of this Sixth Lady was not pure. Jiugong Xiushi noticed it very early.</p>

    <p>On the wheelchair. Jiugong Xiushi frowned deeply.</p>

    <p>"And she has been plotting against my Jiugong family for a long time. If an outsider comes at this time, it may disrupt her original rhythm."</p>

    <p>"So. The purpose of the young master sending people to monitor Number 60 High School is actually for protection?"</p>

    <p>"Of course!"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xiushi nodded: "Since we are going to carry out the kidnapping plan, we must at least ensure their safety before they land on Sun Island. Otherwise, our plan to win over Miss Sun will be completely in vain..."</p>

    <p>Although he was obsessed with fighting for the head of the family, he even made a ruthless plan to kill Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>But now Jiugong Xiushi discovered that maybe he and Jiugong Liangzi were consistent in their attitude towards the Sixth Madam.</p>

    <p>This woman is dangerous.</p>

    <p>Perhaps more terrifying than Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>A ferocious snake is not scary. What is scary is the quiet snake lurking in the dark.</p>

    <p>Normally, it just sits there.</p>

    <p>It looked like he was asleep.</p>

    <p>But no one knows when this poisonous snake will raise its head and bite it.</p>

    <p>One-Eyed Samurai felt that things were getting interesting: "Master Xiushi, do you think Mrs. Six will do anything on the plane?"</p>

    <p>"With Madam Six's character, it's very possible."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xiushi smiled bitterly and said: "But my little mother has always been patient. I just don't know if she will take the bait this time."</p>

    <p>"Maybe."</p>

    <p>One-Eyed Samurai frowned: "If you can fake an accidental plane crash. If you do it well, you can die without any evidence."</p>

    <p>"Is it a plane crash? This seems to be the work of Zhai Xing Group."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xiushi frowned: "So. Are the people sent reliable?"</p>

    <p>"This is my capable general. He is in the Nascent Soul stage. He has received systematic training from the army. He has rich experience. I think there will be no problems."</p>

    <p>"Well, you can make a phone call later and ask about the situation. We don't have much time before we board the boat."</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>We boarded the immortal boat smoothly. Wang Ling The seating area for the group was the business class seats at the front.</p>

    <p>Business class seats are very spacious and comfortable.</p>

    <p>Each person has a leather sofa chair. It comes with a full body massage and the function of freely adjusting the lying angle.</p>

    <p>Massage...Wang Ling is actually not really needed.</p>

    <p>His body is too dense.</p>

    <p>Although I have used light body techniques to lose weight, my body is actually still as hard as iron.</p>

    <p>Even if the massage head made of alloy is vibrated on Wang Ling, it may resonate and break.</p>

    <p>The man who had been monitoring them in the lounge before boarded the boat and found that Wang Ling were all sitting in business class. The expression on his face suddenly became slightly embarrassed.</p>

    <p>"Miss...can I upgrade my cabin? I would like to upgrade to business class."</p>

    <p>So the man gritted his teeth and applied to the stewardess on the immortal boat.</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry, sir. All business class seats have been booked," the pretty stewardess replied patiently.</p>

    <p>"Are there none left?"</p>

    <p>"Yes sir." the stewardess replied.</p>

    <p>Immortal boat business class tickets are very expensive. They are ten times more expensive than economy class tickets.</p>

    <p>Locations are also very limited. There are only ten in total.</p>

    <p>Although there are currently only three people in the business class: Wang Ling, Wang Ming and Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>However, Sun Rong obviously does not want their space to be disturbed by outsiders.</p>

    <p>She knows that Wang Ling likes to be quiet. She might not be used to it if there are strangers sitting next to her.</p>

    <p>So the girl used her pocket money, which in her opinion was not too much, to occupy all the positions.</p>

    <p>"Are there any first-class seats available?"</p>

    <p>"Yes sir."</p>

    <p>"Okay! Help me upgrade to a first-class seat!"</p>

    <p>The man didn't give up. If he couldn't get in the business class, he tried to get in the first class.</p>

    <p>This is the cabin closest to business class. And the key is that if you want to pass business class, you must pass through first class.</p>

    <p>He was sent by Jiugong Xiushi. If there is anything suspicious, he can detect it at a glance.</p>

    <p>This is the last resort. But it is also a helpless move.</p>

    <p>Although there was no one else in the business class.</p>

    <p>But for safety reasons, Wang Ming directly used the magnetic shield that came with Wang Ling Number 3 to completely cover this area.</p>

    <p>To ensure that communications in business class will not be monitored by others.</p>

    <p>"Where did that person come from? He's sneaky. But he doesn't seem to have murderous intent."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong asked with confidence.</p>

    <p>This is her most intuitive feeling of using sword energy.</p>

    <p>If the person coming has malicious intent, then Aohai will immediately detect the murderous intent and issue a warning to Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"Not surprisingly, he should be from the Jiugong family."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said: "I secretly took a photo of him in the lounge earlier. Then I used the authority to enter the face recognition system of International Big Data to scan. I found that this person is called Makino Ling. Nascent Soul period. He was a member of the Sun Island Self-Defense Force. One. After retirement, he is currently working under the Jiugong family."</p>

    <p>"Brother Xiaoer is amazing. You can take a picture of him with such a tight covering?" Sun Rong laughed.</p>

    <p>"Use the association scanning mechanism. It's actually very easy. Wearing sunglasses is actually useless. The scanning light I take pictures can directly penetrate the sunglasses and shine on his eyes. I only need to get 1-2 facial features. Then combine it with the actual body shape for association Scan. You can easily get face data."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said, stretching out his arm, resting on his head, with a relaxed and leisurely look: "This person, should not be planning to lay hands on us."</p>

    <p>"In other words, they don't plan to attack us on the immortal boat."</p>

    <p>"If it's the official person responsible for protecting Jiugong's family, they should communicate with us in advance."</p>

    <p>"The way he looks, combined with his identity, he looks like he was sent by some force within the Jiugong family to protect us."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong almost laughed out loud after hearing this.</p>

    <p>Their current lineup doesn't lack protection at all!</p>

    <p>Even if you don't count Wang Ling. With Wang Ming's current combat power, it would be difficult for ordinary cultivators to defeat him.</p>

    <p>And this time I went abroad. Because Wang Ming was traveling with me, Huaxiu Alliance actually attached great importance to security work.</p>

    <p>In addition to Zhai Yin who came with him on the next immortal boat, he also applied for special protection to the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>That is to say. It looks like they only have four people participating in the exchange program.</p>

    <p>But in fact, there are thousands of troops following behind.</p>

    <p>"Anyway, that's the situation. This guy is not moving right now. We don't need to pay any attention to him."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming chuckled and said: "There may be another group of people who really want to do harm to us. And this person may have got some news? But we are on an immortal boat. They are too brave to do something against us. It's too big."</p>

    <p>"Are you trying to cause a plane crash?"</p>

    <p>"Who knows."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming spread his hands.</p>

    <p>He looked at Wang Ling on the side and showed a meaningful smile: "I just hope that those people will be in peace. After all, the ceiling of the cultivation world is right next to me..."</p>
