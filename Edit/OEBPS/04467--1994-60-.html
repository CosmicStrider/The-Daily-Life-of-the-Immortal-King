  <h1>Chapter 1994 Challenge in 60</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At this point, everyone has been organized clearly under the recommendation of Lord Diulei. No one knows that the organizer behind all this is actually Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>After Wang Ling's multi-faceted calculations, this is already the best arrangement. Everyone can have a bright future under such a fateful intersection.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling also discovered it. He discovered that since he went to Number 60 High School, he has become a lot more worried inexplicably...</p>

    <p>He didn't know if it's because of the influence of people around me.</p>

    <p>Originally, he could be said to be the person most afraid of trouble.</p>

    <p>Soon Lord Diulei took Juggernaut, Cang Long and Liu Yong away from the scene. As soon as these three people left, the overall atmosphere relaxed a lot. Li Changzhe felt like a fish that was almost drowned in deep water. Finally got some breathing space.</p>

    <p>"Master, you are also tired today. Why don't you go back to your room and rest first?" At this time, Li Changzhe stood up, turned to Luo Lan and bowed respectfully.</p>

    <p>Luo Lan was greatly moved by this. So many people came to poach today. Li Changzhe unswervingly chose to follow him... In a sense, this also shows that Li Changzhe recognizes him!</p>

    <p>Worthy of being his fan for many years!</p>

    <p>This apprentice is right!</p>

    <p>At this time, Luo Lan already recognized Li Changzhe in her heart. Not only because of his ability, but also because of his character! He actually found such a disciple with both strength and character. He, Luo Lan, might have saved the galaxy in his previous life. Bar!</p>

    <p>Luo Lan was filled with excitement. Her eyes turned red for a moment. She held Li Changzhe's hand and patted it. Her voice was trembling: "Good disciple... let me go back to my room first. You should also... rest early." ..."</p>

    <p>As the last person left, Li Changzhe slumped down on the back of his chair a little weakly. He looked at the table full of fragrant and untouched meals and fell into deep thought. He had never felt so tired as he did today.</p>

    <p>It didn't take long. Wang Ling finally came in. Li Changzhe's mood instantly improved when he saw the familiar young man: "Wang Ling Come on! Zhenjun has already bought the order. The table is full. Where are the delicacies? It would be a waste not to eat them! Come and eat some too!"</p>

    <p>I was surrounded by several powerful people for several hours. I didn't dare to eat because it was very impolite for the elders to just eat while talking.</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe had no choice but to sit hungry and listen to a few people talking.</p>

    <p>Now he finally sent his seniors away. When he saw Wang Ling appear, he was in a good mood and felt hungry instantly.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The food on this table is not cheap. Many of it are very precious cultivation ingredients.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling glanced at it and estimated that the food on the table would cost no less than 100,000 yuan.</p>

    <p>In fact, he is not that interested in these delicacies in the world of cultivation. He feels that they are not as delicious as his own dry noodles. But there is a table full of them. He has bought them all. It is a kind of extravagance and waste to just leave them there.</p>

    <p>In the spirit of saving food. Wang Ling listened to Li Changzhe's words for the rare time. He took a new pair of chopsticks and started eating.</p>

    <p>After taking a few bites, Wang Ling suddenly realized that this seemed to be one of the few times since I was in high school that I had eaten out at night during school. And it was with a man...</p>

    <p>"This time it is all thanks to Lord Diulei, the head of the Office of Strategic Deception. I didn't expect him to be so approachable."</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe was starving. His stomach was like a bottomless pit. As he spoke, he inhaled: "By the way Wang Ling. Could this be the person you are looking for?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was stunned: "..."</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe: "I actually heard from the grapevine before that Zhuo Yi is your master."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe spoke eloquently and expressed his analysis: "And Zhuo Yi is a member of the Office of Strategic Deception. So it is not surprising that he knows Lord Diulei. You see me surrounded. Isn't that right? Just ask your master to call Zhenjun over... Otherwise, as the head of the Office of Strategic Deception, how could he come to this hotel so easily."</p>

    <p>Not to mention, this inference is actually quite accurate...</p>

    <p>Except for the fact that Zhuo Yi is his master.</p>

    <p>To be honest, it's a bit anti-customer. However, Wang Ling is not opposed to such speculation at all. Anyway, as long as others don't know that he is Zhuo Yi's master...</p>

    <p>"Yeah." That's it. Wang Ling could only nod silently. It was regarded as acknowledging Li Changzhe's inference.</p>

    <p>"As expected."</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe wiped his mouth and smiled: "Don't worry. I will keep this matter a secret for you. Who doesn't have a master these days? But I found that your master's reputation is quite high. After all, he is in a government agency. People. And you can tell at a glance that you have a good relationship with Zhenjun. Otherwise, how could you possibly shout and Zhenjun come over like that."</p>

    <p>"Not bad." Wang Ling replied. As always. Cherish words like gold.</p>

    <p>But Li Changzhe doesn't mind this at all. Wang Ling talks less and talks less. But in fact, Li Changzhe seems to be a very good listener.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Wang Ling is actually very clear. Because Li Changzhe is so smart. Communicating with this person... is actually not that troublesome. The other party can basically guess it. So he only needs to nod yes and shake his head no.</p>

    <p>"I know why you came to see me today. Su Xingyue came to your Number 60 High School, right?"</p>

    <p>As expected, Li Changzhe's next sentence went directly to the topic. He held a crab leg in his mouth and said with a smile: "I know her purpose is not that simple. She wants to seek peace for Qu Shuling. In fact... she still wants to keep it. Shengke's quota for the Earth Center Project this time."</p>

    <p>"As expected, you all know." Wang Ling nodded. It was rare that he said a few more words.</p>

    <p>"That's... we, Jingba and Shengke, are old acquaintances. I don't know Su Xingyue's temper yet. But Qu Shuling has a twisted personality. He usually always behaves like this. An accident occurred in the spirit world trial field. In fact, it was an explosion after suppressing it for a long time. I thought before that something would happen to him sooner or later. It was just a matter of time."</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe said: "Let me guess why Su Xingyue came to you. Does he want to get the reconciliation letter between me and Sister Zhang? But he is afraid that we will not agree. So he wants to talk to us through you?"</p>

    <p>"Yeah."Wang Ling responded.</p>

    <p>"Honestly, Sister Zhang and I can write this settlement letter. Even if it's not for Su Xingyue's face, just for your brother Wang's face, we will definitely write it. But the key to the problem now is not. Here."</p>

    <p>After Li Changzhe finished speaking, he sighed: "I think Su Xingyue will most likely end up working in vain..."</p>

    <p>This sigh was a helpless sigh. Of course Wang Ling knew exactly what Li Changzhe was talking about.</p>

    <p>Because although Su Xingyue is currently trying her best to reverse the situation, with the temper of Principal Dai of Shengke, this matter will not end so easily.</p>

    <p>Tomorrow is the day when Principal Dai from Shengke has agreed to challenge the vice principal of Number 60 High School as the acting principal. And the outcome of this battle will also directly determine whether Shengke has any follow-up opportunities.</p>

    <p>"Now Shengke is eager to prove himself. That's why he issued such a challenge."</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe said: "But the Wan School Alliance is definitely opposed to such a challenge. It is an unprovoked challenge to the principal. This is an act of provocation. If Shengke wins against you, it will prove its strength. But Wan School The Alliance and the Jingmi Institute will definitely still not agree to approve the quota for the Shengke Geocentric Project..."</p>

    <p>"If we lose to you, Shengke will also be embarrassed. As for the first high school, the principal is not as strong as the vice principal... Isn't it a joke if this matter spreads..."</p>

    <p>"So, the only possibility is a tie. In this way, there will be an explanation to the upper management. At the same time, there will be no conflict between the two schools. Everyone will only think that this is a friendly match that ends at the end."</p>

    <p>"But the problem is that with Principal Dai's temper, he won't get into a fight with your vice principal, right? Maybe your vice principal will be beaten to death..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this. Wang Ling couldn't help but fell silent for a moment.</p>

    <p>Yes...</p>

    <p>With Jin Deng's strength.</p>

    <p>Dai Tianchun might be beaten to death with a slap...</p>

    <p>Back in the God's Domain, Jin Deng could stand up to several Dao Gods. He could be called a cosmic powerhouse.</p>

    <p>And the True Immortal realm is just a speck of dust in front of such a cosmic powerhouse.</p>
