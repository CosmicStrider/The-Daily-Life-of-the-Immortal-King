  <h1>Chapter 1981 Human High Quality Wang Ling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At the same time, on the other side, Number 60 High School's morning self-study today was particularly lively. There are almost no airtight walls in a modern cultivation campus.</p>

    <p>The collapse of the Spirit World Number 2 Proving Ground was posted on the cultivation forum almost in the early hours of this morning. Although the post was quickly deleted, it still attracted widespread attention from many people.</p>

    <p>Of course, the most surprising big news compared to this oolong incident is the news that Qu Shuling has resigned as the president of the Shengke Academy Student Union! The new president of the Shengke Academy Student Union will be Su Xingyue, a talented alchemy girl from the same school.</p>

    <p>The former is just a rumor circulated on the cultivation forum. The latter is an official announcement from the academy issued by Shengke.</p>

    <p>And this announcement directly triggered a shocking earthquake in the entire cultivation campus.</p>

    <p>Although the announcement saved Qu Shuling's face and stated that Qu Shuling resigned voluntarily, those supporters of Qu Shuling still did not believe this statement.</p>

    <p>"What happened?"</p>

    <p>"Why did you wake up after a long sleep? Everything has changed."</p>

    <p>Many people unanimously expressed the same question.</p>

    <p>No one knows what Qu Shuling did and was suddenly abandoned by the academy. And Qu Shuling is now completely missing. He has not come out to express his position. There is not even a message on any social account. Not even a selfie. Sent.</p>

    <p>This makes people even more suspicious whether Qu Shuling has been controlled by the authorities.</p>

    <p>Some people have even begun to associate the collapse of the spirit world trial field with Qu Shuling. They believe that this trial ground was because Qu Shuling was too strong. In the process of fighting with others, he was accidentally killed by Qu Shuling. The overbearing spirit was destroyed!</p>

    <p>This official behavior is actually retaliating against Qu Shuling.</p>

    <p>"Someone must be jealous of my brother's strength. That's why he did this to me!"</p>

    <p>"What kind of destruction of the spirit world? The trial field will be destroyed by high school students. What are these people who built the spirit world doing?"</p>

    <p>When Sun Rong saw the news, everyone was shocked. Because as a secret participant in this matter, she knew exactly what happened.</p>

    <p>All I can say is...</p>

    <p>Idiot fans really kill people!</p>

    <p>Maybe the officials just want to teach their brother a lesson. But they want their brother dead.</p>

    <p>Of course. A matter of the collapse of the spirit world trial field. A matter of Qu Shuling resigning as the student union president is suspected to have been hidden... In the final analysis, those are all matters for outsiders.</p>

    <p>Today, there seems to be something unusual for Number 60 High School, especially the first and third graders.</p>

    <p>That's today's Wang Ling. It feels very abnormal...</p>

    <p>"Your Majesty, you also went to participate in the trial of the spirit world. Can you tell us about it?" Chen Chao and Guo Hao couldn't help asking as they gathered around the Wang Ling table. They were very curious about what happened. But In fact, these two people were also participants in this own incident.</p>

    <p>"Nothing. Just picking spiritual fruits, collecting materials, and then repairing the formation."</p>

    <p>To Chen Chao and Guo Hao's surprise, Wang Ling actually answered them directly!</p>

    <p>And it's not even one or two words!</p>

    <p>It's a series of long sentences!</p>

    <p>Before the two of them could recover, Wang Ling continued: "Then the training ground collapsed. Everyone was forcibly sent away."</p>

    <p>"I see...it's not the same game as Chao and I played yesterday. The server suddenly crashed. We were offline."</p>

    <p>"Yeah. I stopped there for a while because of a bug. The relevant staff took me out."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Now it was Chen Chao and Guo Hao's turn to be silent.</p>

    <p>The two people looked at each other for a moment, then looked at Wang Ling with strange eyes.</p>

    <p>I wonder if it was because yesterday's collapse of the Spirit World Trial Field had a huge impact on Wang Ling... This makes this almost 1,980 chapters long. The total lines are less than 1,000 words. The aloof man was so scared that he could talk!</p>

    <p>"What's wrong?" Wang Ling asked, looking at the two of them.</p>

    <p>"No...nothing..." Chen Chao and Guo Hao shook their heads.</p>

    <p>No!</p>

    <p>Illusion! It must be an illusion!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling...How could anyone be so talkative...</p>

    <p>This scene was also seen by Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>She was so frightened that she dropped the toffee in her hand...</p>

    <p>Of course, the above conversation seems to be just a relatively normal exchange. If it happens only occasionally, it won't actually cause any problems.</p>

    <p>So. The key is coming soon.</p>

    <p>In an expansion class about the creatures in the inner earth world, Teacher Pan is introducing relevant theoretical knowledge to everyone.</p>

    <p>"Everyone knows. Now we have confirmed that the inner earth world is not groundless. But for current human cultivators, the inner earth world is still full of unknowns and dangers. There will be very powerful creatures appearing in it."</p>

    <p>With that said, Teacher Pan switched the PPT. A picture of an eagle-headed man with thick hair on his upper body and a pair of wings on his back appeared in front of everyone.</p>

    <p>"Currently, the cultivation science community has sent out detectors to search the inner earth world. In addition to powerful higher spiritual beasts, the possibility of the existence of intelligent beings cannot be ruled out."</p>

    <p>"Everyone, please pay attention to this eagle-headed man. This is a piece of feather collected by instruments of the Academy of Cultivation and Magical Weapons. It was reconstructed through DNA analysis."</p>

    <p>"Now I ask a question. Does anyone know what the exclusive term given to such a creature by the world of cultivation science is?"</p>

    <p>Under normal circumstances, almost no one in the class would take the initiative to raise their hands.</p>

    <p>Especially when faced with such unknown knowledge.</p>

    <p>But as the head teacher, Teacher Pan has already thought about how to deal with this situation.</p>

    <p>Most of the time, she would say to draw a student number based on the date, or directly roll the name by dotting sesame seeds with a little rooster.</p>

    <p>A while ago, it was even popular to directly play the faces of everyone in the class through the system. Whoever's face is framed will answer the question.</p>

    <p>When she asked the question, she saw that the class was silent for several seconds. She was just about to ask a student number.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, a loud voice came from the back row of the classroom.</p>

    <p>"I know!"</p>

    <p>Then, a voice from the window suddenly stood up from his seat. The voice was loud: "The scientific name is: Geocentric Beast Man!"</p>

    <p>"King...Wang Ling?"</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan was so frightened that she dropped her chalk.</p>

    <p>At the same time, everyone in the class looked at Wang Ling. They all showed incredulous looks.</p>

    <p>Just for a moment. The atmosphere in the class suddenly became lively.</p>

    <p>"Oh my God. Teacher Pan's eyes seem to be red... Could it be that she is crying..."</p>

    <p>"Really! Teacher Pan was really touched! He has been teaching our class for most of the semester. This seems to be the first time someone raised his hand to answer a question... and the first person to raise his hand was actually Wang Ling !"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Very good. Classmate Wang Ling. Your answer is completely correct! Please sit down!"</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan took off his eyes and wiped the tears on the lenses with emotion.</p>

    <p>Then he continued to ask: "So now, do any students know which expert and academician developed our country's first geocentric detector?"</p>

    <p>"I know!"</p>

    <p>It was Wang Ling again. He raised his hand and stood up: "It was invented by Academician Zhuang Junbaoxi!"</p>

    <p>"Very good. Classmate Wang Ling is right again. Please sit down!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Next question. When is the second season of the Immortal King's Daily Life animation..."</p>

    <p>"I know!"</p>

    <p>It was still Wang Ling. He raised his hand again. He stood up as quickly as possible: "It's October 30th!"</p>

    <p>"Very good! Classmate Wang Ling, you actually answered the question!"</p>

    <p>"..." The rest of the people.</p>
