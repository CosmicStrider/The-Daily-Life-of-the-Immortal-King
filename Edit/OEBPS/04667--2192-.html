  <h1>Chapter 2192 The King's Seal / Eighty Six)</h1>

  <div>

    <p>. The fastest update on the daily life of the immortal king! Wang Ling's movements were as gentle as possible. He was afraid that he would hurt Sun Rong by poking him, so he just tapped it lightly.</p>

    <p>As a result, Sun Rong's face turned red. This made Wang Ling couldn't help but doubt his own operation. He quickly let go of his hand. He thought that the spiritual power he had just input was not that much... it only occupied It only absorbed 00001 of the spiritual power in his body. Even if Sun Rong was used as a transformer, it wouldn't directly overheat her and turn her into a steam girl.</p>

    <p>So. Wang Ling immediately let go of his hand. The bunch of hair on Sun Rong's head was blown by the steam and turned into dull hair. It was spinning like a helicopter propeller.</p>

    <p>There is an indescribable ambiguity in the current atmosphere. Although Sun Rong is reluctant to admit it, sometimes Sun Rong also finds that sometimes he just likes to think too much.</p>

    <p>The Sun family's imagination is very strong. Sometimes things may not be what she imagined.</p>

    <p>After all, I have been classmates with Wang Ling for almost a year. Sun Rong feels that he can figure out what kind of personality this wooden person has.</p>

    <p>After forcing herself to calm down, Sun Rong began to focus on sharing the current problems with Wang Ling. She helped Wang Ling remove all the people who had fainted in the construction site. The octopus people were all searched out. They were transported directly using Aohai's water avatar.</p>

    <p>A total of seventy-two aliens were found by her. They were arranged neatly like sardines in front of the construction site. They were all stunned by the ripples of spiritual pressure just now. They are now unconscious.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong arranged the octopus men neatly and then took off their painted skin masks one by one.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling. This person...should be the boss of this group of people." When Sun Rong was halfway dismantled, he suddenly looked at Wang Ling and said.</p>

    <p>Although Sun Rong is not very old, as the future successor of the head of the Sun family, he has received education in identifying spiritual treasures since he was a child. Sun Rong has seen many, many high-end materials. And high-end painted skin materials. She can feel the difference just by the touch of her fingers.</p>

    <p>The painted leather mask worn by the octopus boss is different from other octopus men. It is made of very high-grade material. It is not only waterproof and fireproof, but also bulletproof. It is also very breathable. Even if it is worn for a long time, there will be no flaws.</p>

    <p>However, working here wearing a painted mask seems very suspicious in itself. The higher the quality of the materials, the more deliberately these octopus people hide their identities.</p>

    <p>If you haven't done anything wrong, there should be no need to deliberately hide yourself.</p>

    <p>Now the earth has established diplomatic relations with aliens from all major outer galaxies. Many aliens will maintain their original appearance while living in human cities. There is no need to deliberately disguise themselves as humans.</p>

    <p>Based on her experience and intuition, Sun Rong felt that these octopus people were unusual. Just in case, she tied them all up with water rope restraints.</p>

    <p>Then. Wang Ling lightly snapped his fingers.</p>

    <p>A wave of air spread out with Wang Ling as the center, directly awakening these octopus people.</p>

    <p>They woke up one by one as if they were dreaming. They were all in a sleepy state. They had no idea what was happening.</p>

    <p>It was the octopus boss who showed his wise eyes for the first time. Compared to the other octopus men, it still recalled the terrifying scene just now.</p>

    <p>Yes...</p>

    <p>It felt a huge amount of spiritual pressure from top to bottom. It was like the weight of Mount Tai, directly bombarding the little heads of it and all its subordinates.</p>

    <p>But now that they have woken up, everyone is tied up tightly, which proves that they have encountered a tough situation.</p>

    <p>"What are you doing...not letting us go!" The octopus boss was still struggling. He refused to admit that he secretly built a secret magic circle: "We are all aliens with conscience! You are like this They tied us up indiscriminately. Do you want to elevate to extraterrestrial diplomatic relations?"</p>

    <p>"Aliens with a conscience will not hit us directly with hand-held weapons! We are just high school students passing by.</p>

    <p>"Sun Rong put his hands on his hips. Staring at the octopus boss, he hummed and laughed. Then he pointed at Wang Ling: "This senior brother of mine is only in the Foundation Building stage! You scared him!" Octopus people: "..."</p>

    <p>The octopus boss was also at a loss for words for a moment. If it remembers correctly, it seems that this high school student who is only in the Foundation Building stage is transmitting terrible spiritual pressure through your body, right?</p>

    <p>Although it is stupid and its cultivation level is not high, it can be seen that Wang Ling is clearly passing through Sun Rong's body, acting as a transformer...</p>

    <p>Only powerful monks would do that.</p>

    <p>Because if you suppress it with all your strength, the consequences will be disastrous.</p>

    <p>The octopus boss knows the stakes here.</p>

    <p>I even knew it in an instant. This male high school student was probably pretending to be a pig and eating the tiger...</p>

    <p>But alas. It doesn't have any evidence.</p>

    <p>At this time, the key is to bow your head and admit your mistakes.</p>

    <p>But just as it was about to speak, something unexpected happened again... Not all octopus people have such sharp eyesight and know how to assess the situation.</p>

    <p>On the right side of it, someone actually started to follow its words and started to resist: "Yes, yes! It's just a misunderstanding. You actually treat us like this! Tie us up! Are we still human? I have never been sorry to human beings!"</p>

    <p>This is talking nonsense with open eyes.</p>

    <p>Wang Tong can distinguish the karma of killing.</p>

    <p>There is a kind of "life outline" ability.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling can use the light emitted by this "life outline" to determine whether this person has committed unforgivable murder.</p>

    <p>For people with serious sins, the "outline of creatures" that Wang Ling can see is red. It is similar to the concept of red-named players in the game.</p>

    <p>He looked over at a glance. Among so many octopus men, there were actually quite a few octopus men with red names.</p>

    <p>So...</p>

    <p>Just take action on these people.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling walked up to the octopus man and drew his finger pen into the posture of a pistol. At the same time, he transmitted his voice to Sun Rong. Let Sun Rong become his mouth substitute.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong heard the voice transmission from Wang Ling. He was also furious at the crime committed by this octopus man: "You actually attacked a little girl... You are still not a human after all!"</p>

    <p>According to the Wang Ling "Creature Outline" ability Wang Ling, I read the murderous judgment about this octopus man. In a dark alley, the octopus man in front of me committed murder on a little human girl. An unspeakable atrocity.</p>

    <p>The most hateful thing is that it wears a painted leather hood and tries to pass the crime onto the human monks.</p>

    <p>"What nonsense are you talking about...I didn't!" the red-named octopus man denied.</p>

    <p>To this day, it still shows no sign of repentance for the crimes it committed.</p>

    <p>Beads of sweat dripped down its head. It wanted to argue a few more words. But soon, Wang Ling's finger gun had penetrated its brain. Jet-black ink spattered like blood on the surrounding octopuses. on one's accomplices.</p>

    <p>These octopus people were shocked.</p>

    <p>The dead red-named octopus was converted according to the spiritual realm of a human monk. But it had a Nascent Soul stage...</p>

    <p>To be shot dead by such a high school student?</p>
