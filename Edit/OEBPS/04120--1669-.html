  <h1>Chapter 1669 The master of sheltering creatures</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When a huge cube with metallic luster and full of technology appeared in the sky on the streets of the downtown area, the spherical guard immediately issued an abnormality warning.</p>

    <p>Because there is a difference between the teleported location and the actual location. Logically speaking, this should not happen.</p>

    <p>"What's going on?" Nawei frowned in displeasure. He originally wanted to accurately transport the cube to Sun Rong and others. Unexpectedly, it was transported directly to the downtown area. This The situation suddenly became troublesome. It looked like many people were going to die.</p>

    <p>"Abnormal energy fluctuations of SCB-096 were detected. It is initially suspected that the containment device left the suppression circle and gave 096 a certain amount of spiritual space. It allowed it to use its own abilities to teleport the entire cube to other locations. This resulted in a coordinate offset."</p>

    <p>"Sure enough, it has become stronger..." Nawei touched his chin. He sneered: "It doesn't matter. Don't worry about it for now. Then release a contained creature that does not have the ability to teleport. It's right in front of Mr. Gong."</p>

    <p>"Release one more?"</p>

    <p>"I think SCB-1212 is good." Nawei said.</p>

    <p>SCB-1212. Chinese name: Mute Man.</p>

    <p>Capability analysis:</p>

    <p>①: It will launch a sudden attack on all objects that make sounds within its hearing range. It will cut open its belly with sharp claws. It is a strange humanoid creature with mantis hands. It has only a big bloody mouth filled with fangs on its head. Just looking at it gives me a strong sense of oppression.</p>

    <p>②: Everyone who has direct contact with him will involuntarily say "Abba Abba"... and even the words "Abba Abba" will constantly appear in his brain, making it impossible to think.</p>

    <p>③: When within the vicinity, every time you hear the word "Abba" 100 times, you will automatically gain a life and be resurrected immediately after death.</p>

    <p>According to Nawei's understanding of SCB-1212. In the past years, 1212 has accumulated at least 1.26 million lives. This means that 1212 must be killed at least 1.26 million times. Only then will it be completely eliminated.</p>

    <p>Nawei really wants to see what kind of chemical reaction will occur when this "Mr. Gong" meets 1212?</p>

    <p>And this time, 1212 has a certain probability of meeting 096.</p>

    <p>In previous experiments to contain creatures, these two creatures had never met each other. If they were to fight, they might make a breakthrough academic contribution to his research on the ultimate version of New Ancient Divine Weapons.</p>

    <p>At this time, the spherical guard issued a confirmation command again.</p>

    <p>"Are you sure that the creatures that need to be liberated are the creatures contained in SCB-1212 (also known as: Material Pack Number 1212)?"</p>

    <p>"Confirmed..."</p>

    <p>"Okay. The system has understood. It will be transmitted according to the specified coordinate position after a countdown of 120 seconds..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. When a huge cube with metallic luster and full of technology appeared in the sky on the streets of the downtown area. Wang Ling and the Ah Nuan girl who had been lying on his shoulder. They all immediately Insight into the strange creature in the cube.</p>

    <p>At the scene, debris caused by the collapse of the building flew around. While large amounts of dust were raised, panicked voices were heard from passers-by. People fled and had no idea what was going on.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stood in front of the crumbling kiosk with his hands in his pockets. His body is trembling slightly.</p>

    <p>Now he finally understands what the Internet saying "shaky and cold" means...</p>

    <p>These flying building fragments failed to hit Wang Ling. He has a powerful holy light protection on his body. This is the ability that comes with the sanctification of the body. It can be automatically activated in an unconscious state. It can block all close enemies. Flying spells or props.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Nuan is equally powerful physically, he has not yet reached the level where Wang Ling is now.</p>

    <p>He was worried that Ah Nuan girl would be injured, so he expanded the holy light on his body and wrapped the little girl in it.</p>

    <p>The brother and sister work together well.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's mind was on Ah Nuan girl. Ah Nuan girl used her Shadow power to control the flying debris and saved the innocent passers-by from being hurt.</p>

    <p>"What's going on outside?"</p>

    <p>The canteen they were in was not far from the astrology club. When he saw a huge cube landing, Lord Diulei also frowned.</p>

    <p>Danger!</p>

    <p>This cube is dangerous!</p>

    <p>He didn't know what was inside. But from what he could tell from his years of death seeking. The souls of those imprisoned in this cube are not mundane...</p>

    <p>"It's to take in living beings." At this time, Xiang Yi said.</p>

    <p>He had already unzipped his sniper rifle bag and was quickly assembling the "Nine Sun Divine Sword": "According to my investigation, in order to cultivate the top New Ancient Divine Weapons, Master Wu Xin captured strange Habits of alien creatures. And these creatures all have special skills. They cannot be killed easily by ordinary cultivation methods. Therefore, they can only be imprisoned in this cubic seal container in the form of this seal."</p>

    <p>"Then what do they belong to? It doesn't feel like they are mythical beasts born from chaos..." Er Ha frowned.</p>

    <p>Ever since I first learned about the existence of that mythical beast, the groundhog.</p>

    <p>Now he himself has evolved into a divine beast.</p>

    <p>If the creature in the cube is also a mythical beast born from chaos, or has evolved to that point through later stages, it will definitely resonate with him.</p>

    <p>But now. This resonance is almost zero.</p>

    <p>"The creatures born in chaos are not just divine beasts. There is also a certain probability that chaotic beasts will be produced. And these chaotic beasts are also called indescribable creatures."</p>

    <p>"Unspeakable beings? Are these beings related to the Outer God, the Old Dominator?"</p>

    <p>"Maybe. That's all I know about it so far. At least some of the unspeakable creatures are related to the Old Dominator, the Outer God. And others are simply created by the mixture of the Great Dao and the power of Chaos. Just living creatures." Xiang Yi said.</p>

    <p>"That's it." Er Ha nodded.</p>

    <p>He roughly understood.</p>

    <p>In other words, the unified name of these sheltered creatures is called "Unspeakable Creatures." They are just divided into two factions. One faction is the [Old Day Sect]. It was created by Chaos combining some outer gods and Old Dominator cells; Another faction, the [Dao Faction], was born from the combination of the power of the Dao and chaos.</p>

    <p>At this time, the Nine Sun Divine Sword in his hand has been completely assembled.</p>

    <p>He adjusted the 3.2 billion light-year aiming magnifier on the sword. He nodded with satisfaction: "In order to avoid harming innocent people, it is better to kill these chaotic beasts as directly as possible."</p>

    <p>"There's no need to be busy. That person is here. This guy shouldn't be able to jump around for long." At this time, Wang Ming stretched out his hand and blocked Xiang Yi's opportunity to perform a headshot with a sniper.</p>

    <p>Xiang Yi: "Who is coming?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming smiled: "Who else could it be?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha was shocked: "Could it be the Lord...fuck! Let me tell you why I kept feeling his breath in front of me! It turns out it was not an hallucination caused by me missing him too much!"</p>

    <p>He actually wanted to know whether Wang Ling had also come to this other world... but he wasn't quite sure.</p>

    <p>It wasn't until he saw this extremely familiar scene in front of him that he had the answer in his heart.</p>

    <p>Seven years ago, he also destroyed a canteen and then transformed from a toad into a dog by accident...</p>

    <p>Who knows what will happen to this bunny man who also crushed the canteen?</p>

    <p>At this very moment, everyone in the Astrology Club, Office of Strategic Deception, is paying close attention to the battle ahead.</p>

    <p>I saw Wang Ling slowly walking towards the rabbit that had escaped from the container.</p>

    <p>Er Ha rubbed his nose: "This...why do I feel that there is still the smell of Ah Nuan on your master?"</p>

    <p>He was sure that he heard it right.</p>

    <p>The smell of milk from a baby is still very obvious.</p>

    <p>"Ah Nuan girl is indeed here too. Just on his shoulder." Wang Ming said.</p>

    <p>"So she's Ling Zhenren's sister? She's too young. Is there any danger?" Xiang Yi was a little worried. He knew who Wang Ling was. But he knew nothing about Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>In his original world, there was no intersection between himself and Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>"Looking at the appearance, this should be the bunny man Number 091. It has extremely strong self-healing ability. It will kill anyone who sees its buck teeth." Xiang Yi added.</p>

    <p>The words just fell.</p>

    <p>A scene that everyone didn't expect happened.</p>

    <p>Ah Nuan girl suddenly shouted: "Rabbit!--Rabbit!"</p>

    <p>Then the whole person jumped up from Wang Ling's shoulders and flew towards the bunny man.</p>

    <p>Faced with Wang Nuan flying toward him, this rabbit man was also unexpected. It was born on the back side of the moon four billion years ago. He has never seen such a bold human being... And there is actually a baby?</p>

    <p>There was a hint of unbelievable fear in 091's eyes. When Wang Nuan's breath came closer, and once he rode on its neck with a milky smell, 091's thoughts were suddenly shocked.</p>

    <p>This...</p>

    <p>This familiar feeling...</p>

    <p>At this time, 091's ruby-like beautiful eyes were filled with tears.</p>

    <p>"Master..." 091 let go of the hand that was covering his buck teeth. There were tears in his eyes and he made a faint sound out of his mouth.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling originally wanted to kill 091 with one strike of his hand.</p>

    <p>When he saw this scene, he was immediately relieved.</p>

    <p>Because just four billion years ago, he did use Shadow's great power at the "Top of the Sky·Palm Cliff" at that time...</p>

    <p>Therefore, 091 must be produced. There is also a causal relationship with him.</p>

    <p>Because he used Shadow in advance back then.</p>

    <p>Caused Wang Nuan's Shadow to react with Chaos.</p>

    <p>And on the back side of the moon, gave birth to 091...</p>
