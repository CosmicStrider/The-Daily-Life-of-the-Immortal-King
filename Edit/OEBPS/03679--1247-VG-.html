  <h1>Chapter 1247 Captain Lu takes a broad road</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Familiar picture. Same way of death. Snake opened his eyes wide. He couldn't believe what was happening in front of him.</p>

    <p>"Impossible...I am. A great citizen of the void..."</p>

    <p>Before the emergency, Snake used his last strength to say his last words.</p>

    <p>Then. There was a big explosion in the sky.</p>

    <p>All nearby spaces were blown up, forming a huge wormhole.</p>

    <p>This is the explosion phenomenon that occurs after the death of a virtual spirit. It is extremely powerful.</p>

    <p>Earth cultivators. Under True Immortal. If they suffer such an impact, they will definitely die.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi and Keorn were horrified to watch.</p>

    <p>This is another discovery for the virtual spirit.</p>

    <p>Pure ethereal. Without entity. There will be no explosion after death.</p>

    <p>But if cultivators on earth who have been invaded by ethereal spirits die together with the ethereal spirits, it will cause an explosion similar to void backlash.</p>

    <p>So if you want to kill the virtual spirit.</p>

    <p>The safest way is to force the virtual spirit out of the human body and then find a way to kill it.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi feels it is necessary to report this issue to the frontline.</p>

    <p>If there is a void spirit that wants to break the jar, then those cultivators from the earth who have been invaded will be natural time bombs.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Keorn has no impression of the man possessed by Snake."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi took out the notebook from the jacket of the suit.</p>

    <p>He used the magic of impression projection to project Snake's transformed appearance onto the notebook.</p>

    <p>This trick {Impression Projection}Zhuo Yi is already very familiar.</p>

    <p>If you are a person with a rich imagination, you can even use this method to create comics. Time updates are not a dream!</p>

    <p>You can update wherever you want!</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect that Snake would give up his identity as a human and become an ethereal spirit."</p>

    <p>Keorn sighed endlessly. He stared at Zhuo Yi's portrait. He briefly reasoned about Snake's situation: "After he died for the first time, he must have used some method to become an ethereal spirit and then invaded this man. 's body. This man... I seem to have seen him somewhere before. But he's not too familiar."</p>

    <p>"Is it possible that he is from your foundation?"</p>

    <p>"I know most of my colleagues in the Foundation. I have never met this person."</p>

    <p>Keorn shook his head: "Unless..."</p>

    <p>"Unless what?"</p>

    <p>"Unless he is one of the seven ambassadors behind the Foundation."</p>

    <p>"One of the Seven Ambassadors..." Zhuo Yi pondered.</p>

    <p>Indeed. The possibility of this inference cannot be ruled out.</p>

    <p>Even leaving aside the fact that Snake became an ethereal spirit. Zhuo Yi and Keorn both have to admit that the true master Snake found is very strong!</p>

    <p>This can be seen from the quality of the physical body.</p>

    <p>Snake was not a random target for invasion.</p>

    <p>There must be a pusher behind this who is secretly managing everything.</p>

    <p>At this time, the blasted space wormhole in the sky is gradually shrinking.</p>

    <p>Space rifts have a self-healing mechanism. However, this repair is very slow. A space wormhole like this will take at least a day to fully recover.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi saw police officers from nearby areas approaching with spiritual swords on their feet and immortals in their hands.</p>

    <p>They need to set up a cordon here and temporarily block the airspace in this area.</p>

    <p>"Director Zhuo!"</p>

    <p>Among the approaching cultivator patrolmen, a captain approached in the direction of Zhuo Yi. He stood respectfully in front of Zhuo Yi and saluted.</p>

    <p>"I've disguised myself like this. Can you still recognize it?"Zhuo Yi was surprised.</p>

    <p>"The main reason is that the gangster who blew himself up just now screamed very loudly..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi heard this. He smiled and said: "I have been wanted by General Alliance. You won't capture me?"</p>

    <p>"I don't dare..." The captain shook his head: "I felt from the beginning that there was some misunderstanding or a trap. Chief Zhuo has made outstanding contributions. How could he kill Warden Liang?"</p>

    <p>The squad leader's words made Zhuo Yi secretly relieved.</p>

    <p>He felt that he was very lucky to have met a sensible person.</p>

    <p>What if we meet Tiehanhan? This matter will not end yet.</p>

    <p>"I still need to go to the front line. Please keep my affairs a secret, brother." Zhuo Yi patted the squad leader on the shoulder: "Oh, by the way, brother. What's your name?"</p>

    <p>"My name is Lu Liang." The squad leader named Lu saluted again.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi nodded. He and Keorn clasped their fists: "Then I wish Captain Lu good luck and immortality!"</p>

    <p>"Immortal luck!" Captain Lu returned the greeting.</p>

    <p>Because his appearance has been exposed, before leaving, Zhuo Yi changed his appearance again.</p>

    <p>The shape is even uglier than the previous one that looked like Ku Xuan.</p>

    <p>As they were leaving, the squad leader named Lu Liang called out again: "Director Zhuo. We found this. I don't know if it was something abandoned by Director Zhuo."</p>

    <p>Lu Liang handed the things over.</p>

    <p>This is a palm-sized orb that exudes brilliant light and has a round texture.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi smelled the smell on it. I was surprised that it smelled like snake.</p>

    <p>"This may be the key to why Snake can become an ethereal spirit." Keorn narrowed his eyes and transmitted a message to Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi accepted the orb. Thank you again for this careful Captain Lu.</p>

    <p>Then he and Keorn turned into two rainbows and disappeared into the sky.</p>

    <p>Staring at the retreating figure of Zhuo Yi, Lu Liang waved goodbye excitedly!</p>

    <p>He has been a fan of Zhuo Yi for a long time!</p>

    <p>This feeling of meeting his idol made him feel as if he had become the happiest person in the world in an instant!</p>

    <p>"The Army... area has basically been sealed off. Now it's time to collect battle damage statistics."</p>

    <p>"I'll take care of this part." Lu Liang nodded and said.</p>

    <p>There are some things that he feels it would be better to do on his own.</p>

    <p>Many police officers in their area are fans of Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>God knows what extreme things these people will do to protect Zhuo Yi...</p>

    <p>But he is different.</p>

    <p>He is a rational fan.</p>

    <p>If you cover things up completely, it would be a bit too fake.</p>

    <p>Lu Liang has already thought of a good way. It can protect Zhuo Yi at the same time and handle the matter seamlessly.</p>

    <p>These days, even if you are protecting your idols, you have to be relaxed.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, I'm afraid it will cause even greater trouble.</p>

    <p>You know, the behavior of fans increases the number of idols. This kind of thing is not uncommon on the Internet.</p>

    <p>"General Administration Zhuo, look at me!" Lu Liang looked at the direction Zhuo Yi was leaving, feeling confident in himself.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, on the way to the epidemic prevention station, Zhuo Yi received a message from the Office of Strategic Deception intelligence department.</p>

    <p>The result was as expected by Keorn.</p>

    <p>"Everything is as you thought." Zhuo Yi frowned.</p>

    <p>"Who is this person?"</p>

    <p>"The president of the Mixiu Country Apollo Charity Federation. Apollo Deliman. And this person's true identity is the sun envoy among the seven emissaries of the foundation."</p>

    <p>"It's actually him..."</p>

    <p>Now, Keorn finally recalled the identity of this person.</p>

    <p>He sighed: "Apollo Deliman... He is a man with a great sense of justice. The Charity Federation he founded spends a large amount of money to help people in distress every year. He is indeed like the sun. He radiates. Live with your own light and heat."</p>

    <p>In Keorn's view, Deliman is a very low-key person who works quietly but rarely appears in the news.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Keorn has always been vague about Deleman's face. But he is particularly familiar with this name.</p>

    <p>Deliman is one of his idols.</p>

    <p>He marveled at Deliman's character.</p>

    <p>It was also Deliman who told him.</p>

    <p>True charity. In fact, even a pack of instant noodles can be made public.</p>
