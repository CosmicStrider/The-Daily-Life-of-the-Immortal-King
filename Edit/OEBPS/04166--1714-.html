  <h1>Chapter 1714 The gardener of the Sun Rong family</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It is still 8 pm on December 26th. A full 4 hours have passed since Jin Deng returned to the real world with Sun Rong in the "Mountain of Recall", upgrading Aohai to a nine-core spirit sword.</p>

    <p>In 4 hours, too many things happened. The emergence of the Thought Plague caused the entire Songhai City to be shrouded in a layer of haze.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was obediently staying in her room with her nine-core Aohai in hand. Not long after, Aunt Qiu, the head maid who had been serving Sun Rong, knocked on the door and entered with a tray. There was a pot of fresh brew on the tray. Good hand-ground coffee, two sugar cubes and a cup of fresh milk.</p>

    <p>"Miss, won't you go out for a walk today?" Aunt Qiu asked. Seeing Sun Rong staying at home and looking out the window, she felt something was wrong. A feeling of worry could not help but arise in her heart.</p>

    <p>"It's okay, Aunt Qiu." Sun Rong smiled and said, "Just put the coffee on the table. I'll drink it later."</p>

    <p>Naturally, she had her own reasons for choosing to stay indoors.</p>

    <p>Now Aohai has upgraded to a nine-core spirit sword. She is worried that using it at will may hurt other unrelated people.</p>

    <p>Of course. The most important point is that Wang Ling seems to prefer that she not go anywhere. It is best to stay at home. This can also avoid unnecessary trouble...</p>

    <p>But today's day is very special. It's obviously Wang Ling's birthday.</p>

    <p>When she thought of the embarrassing scene when she visited the Wang family s cottage earlier, a few blushes could not help but rise on her cheeks again.  Ah ... She had obviously gone to wish Wang Ling a happy birthday! In the end, she only delivered the crispy noodles, and she didn't even have time to send a word of blessing.</p>

    <p>After returning from the Mountain of Retrospection, the more Sun Rong thought about it, the more strange it became, so she began to sit in front of the desk and stare at the scene outside the window with a lost face, while the smartphone on the desk was tuned to the message editing page...</p>

    <p>She originally typed a long string of words, but she felt that it was a bit too wordy as a birthday wish, so she deleted it again.</p>

    <p>So now Sun Rong is holding her head and getting into trouble again.</p>

    <p>Because if you are sending text messages...</p>

    <p>She felt that this was a bit too insincere.</p>

    <p>Thoughts were wandering in her mind. As a result, Aunt Qiu just opened the door and walked in. She suddenly came back to her senses.</p>

    <p>At this moment, when she looked out the window, she saw a maid coming in from the front yard with a little girl in a red dress.</p>

    <p>"Aunt Qiu, why is there a little girl in the yard? Which family's child is this?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"I was just about to talk to the lady about this." Aunt Qiu replied: "This is the girl of the gardener Zhang San's family. I heard she's from the countryside and has never been to the city, but she wants to take a look around this time."</p>

    <p>"But I remember Uncle Zhang wasn't..."</p>

    <p>"You're right Miss, Zhang San is not fertile. However, when he was young, he saved some sperm, which he heard was for the purpose of finding a rich woman who could fancy him and sell it. In the end, he really waited for one."</p>

    <p>Aunt Qiu talked freely about the employee gossip: "It is said to be a blond foreign woman named Mariana. Her family runs a winery. She is very rich. Through big data comparison, we finally found Zhang San's sperm bank. data."</p>

    <p>"So this little girl was born to that foreign woman named Mariana?"</p>

    <p>"Not really. The situation is more complicated." Aunt Qiu said, "Mariana was unwilling to be a pregnant woman in order to maintain her figure, so she found a surrogate."</p>

    <p>"Surrogacy!? But isn't this illegal?"</p>

    <p>"It's illegal, yes. But Zhang San, isn't he an outlaw?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"I heard that when the girl was just 7 months pregnant, Mariana didn't want her anymore and said she would abort her. She felt that the birth of the baby would jeopardize her career."</p>

    <p>Aunt Qiu sighed and said, "So, soon after the child was born, she was taken to Huaxiu and has been taken care of by Zhang San and his parents. She was a poor girl, to say the least."</p>

    <p>After hearing the whole story, Sun Rong was shocked.</p>

    <p>She didn't know why. She felt that this story sounded a bit familiar. It was very similar to the material extracted from the real world. It was also full of twists and turns and bizarreness. It was breathtaking and at the same time shattered.</p>

    <p>It is illegal to find someone to bear children on your behalf. In the middle of the process, you suddenly regret and want to abort the child. It is really speechless. When the child is born, you do not plan to raise it and try every means to separate the relationship. This fully reflects the scumbag.</p>

    <p>Facts have proven that scum does not distinguish between men and women.</p>

    <p>The good and evil of human nature can never be divided by gender, let alone inferred by thinking. Because human nature is a deep pool of water. You will never know how deep the deepest water is.</p>

    <p>"Speaking of which, why does Aunt Qiu know so many things..." Sun Rong took a sip of coffee and showed a bit of a melon expression.</p>

    <p>"Hey, our employees in the yard don't have any little secrets. And this is what Zhang San said himself. It's not like we are nosy." Aunt Qiu said: "Miss is just waking up. We'll take care of this little girl and she won't disturb you. She will be sent away in a few days."</p>

    <p>"good..."</p>

    <p>In fact, Sun Rong is still a little confused so far.</p>

    <p>Because this story is too bizarre and tortuous. It sounds like that's what happened, but it doesn't feel like it's true.</p>

    <p>After the head maid left, she looked at the little girl running around in the yard. She suddenly imagined in her heart whether she would have such a day...</p>

    <p>"What are you thinking about, Rongrong?" At this time, Sun Ying'er popped up her head again and couldn't help laughing: "Are you thinking... If you and Wang Ling have a child in the future..."</p>

    <p>Before she could finish her words, her mouth was immediately covered tightly by Sun Rong: "What nonsense are you talking about again, Ying'er! I...I didn't think that..."</p>

    <p>"Hey hey hey. What you say is not what you mean!" Sun Ying'er was very happy in her heart.</p>

    <p>She just likes to see Sun Rong look so shy that she wants to find a crack to slip in.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong looked at Sun Ying'er's smug look, and couldn't help but retaliate: "You're still talking about me...you yourself are still the same...you go out every night and hang out with Mr. Ying, so it's not likely that you'll come back one day and your belly will be bigger..."</p>

    <p>"I...I didn't!" Sun Ying'er snorted: "Who wants to have sex with him! He is a gangster! A pervert! A disciple! A bastard! I will never like him in my life. ! This is all forced! Forced! Forced feelings are useless! Moreover, I will not have any affair with him..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong didn't expect Sun Ying'er's reaction to be so big. She shouted excitedly. Sun Rong wanted to speak to make Sun Ying'er calm down a little. But the next second, her voice became louder. And it stopped.</p>

    <p>Because Wang Ling, Wang Ying and Death Heavenly Dao. suddenly flashed into her room.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ying grabbed Sun Ying'er's chin and smiled coldly: "You... say it again?"</p>
