  <h1>Chapter 2090 Qiao Yanyuan's Ability</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: So far. As Bai Zhe's most powerful ace Dragonborn, Qiao Yanyuan's abilities are still a mystery.</p>

    <p>The characteristics of Muyu are significantly different from Wang Muyu's universal dragon. Although Muyu is also very strong and has the abilities of most dragons in the dragon family, it has limitations precisely because of its excessive abilities.</p>

    <p>And when he was injecting genes into Wang Muyu, although Wang Muyu had the genes of the three leaders of the dragon clan, Bai Zhe played a trick and deliberately caused Wang Muyu to have the genetic chain of these three leaders defective.</p>

    <p>Therefore, even if Wang Muyu cultivates the abilities of these three dragon leaders to the peak, he still cannot compare with Bai Zhe, who has mastered the complete moonlight dragon gene.</p>

    <p>Of course. If Wang Muyu could cultivate every gene he possesses to the extreme, then the outcome would be completely different.</p>

    <p>However, the growth of the dragon clan is not easy. The more abilities you have, the harder it is to control. Wang Muyu is still young. Even though he is powerful, he still has many problems to face.</p>

    <p>This is like a character development game. Only focus on cultivating one character. It is of course easy to superimpose the character's star rating to the extreme to achieve "full life." But if you need to cultivate the entire system, then the difficulty is not a little difficult. Not to mention the consumption of materials and Financial resources. Just the time required is not on the same level.</p>

    <p>The stronger the dragon gene, the stronger the dragonborn created. The Jingze and Yan? whom Wang Ling met before. Although these two people are not even able to defeat Ah Nuan girl, they are also ancestors after all. Realm. Ranked among the Dragonborn in terms of combat prowess. Very powerful.</p>

    <p>The reason why Qiao Yanyuan can be directly arranged to earth to become Bai Zhe's trump card is that he can use his soul to show off his power in the holy temple across endless distances.</p>

    <p>It really shouldn't be underestimated.</p>

    <p>Even Wang Ling feels that this person may be stronger than Xianfengnian.</p>

    <p>An ace dragonborn can be stronger than the human race that has absorbed and refined the outer Heavenly Dao tradition for a long time. It is no wonder that in the eons, the dragon tribe and the outer gods can oppose each other, each dominating the universe.</p>

    <p>It's a pity. In the end, both tribes were wiped out.</p>

    <p>When civilization reaches its peak, it will face extinction. Then it will undergo the next reincarnation of life. Perhaps this is an immutable law in the universe.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Sea restricted area. Onboard the Moonlight. Except for the little white dragon in the waves represented by Wang Muyu, who was approaching in his direction. Even though the other monks from the Xiuzhen Kingdom had been sent away by Zhang Zhui, they all broke in again without believing in evil.</p>

    <p>Bai Yinshou. An Eternal who was forced to join the ancient world. He was also a servant who followed Qiao Yanyuan after signing a soul death contract with Bai Zhe.</p>

    <p>Previously, Bai Yinshou was entrusted by Qiao Yanyuan to do the task of forcibly burning dragon runes for the Shark Emperor in the sea restricted area to allow him to evolve abnormally.</p>

    <p>The shark king was so ferocious that he smashed through several ships with just one turn, plunging the entire restricted sea area into a bloody storm.</p>

    <p>But obviously Bai Yinshou didn't expect that there would be Eternal Ones appearing. As this group of human monks entered the restricted area of the sea.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Qiao, those human monks did not retreat. They all came in anyway. And it seems that there is a larger fleet group gathering outside the sea area..."</p>

    <p>Qiao Yanyuan pinched his purple-black hair and frowned slightly: "Do you know the Eternal One?"</p>

    <p>"There are people with eternal strength. I looked at it. There are only three people in total. One is Wang Muyu. The other two are. I don't know one of them. I only know that he calls himself Yue Lingwei. As for the other one... he is An old acquaintance."</p>

    <p>Bai Yinshou bowed and said: "The eternal thief Zhang Zhui. There were also things stolen by him in the old cave."</p>

    <p>"Ha. Do you still have this experience?" Qiao Yanyuan curled his lips and sneered.</p>

    <p>But soon, the smile stopped because he noticed that Bai Yinshou's expression began to change.</p>

    <p>There is clearly a hatred for Zhang Zhui. I can't help but wonder: "What did he steal from you?"</p>

    <p>Bai Yinshou gritted his teeth: "It's the old lady's chastity... that makes her... unable to change into a human physique..."</p>

    <p>"..." Qiao Yanyuan was silent.</p>

    <p>Because he knew something about this matter. But he didn't expect that there would be such a series connection with the information he knew.</p>

    <p>When Bai Zhe gave Bai Yinshou to him as a servant, Qiao Yanyuan knew part of Bai Yinshou's past.</p>

    <p>According to legend, he was an Eternal who married a foreigner and fell in love with a vampire princess. In the Eternal Era, vampires needed to drink a large amount of blood as a source of supply. As long as he absorbed the blood of a million different creatures, the unique characteristics of the vampires would be revealed. will be produced.</p>

    <p>When taking a mouthful of blood, vampire creatures that meet the conditions can be directly transformed into creatures of the same race as the blood creatures. Assimilation is completed.</p>

    <p>And he will directly fall in love with the creature whose blood has been sucked. No matter what that creature is...</p>

    <p>It is said that Bai Yinshou wanted to stay with his wife forever, but he struggled a lot throughout the ages.</p>

    <p>In the name of short-term employment, he falsely offered high employment prices to attract many cosmic creatures, and then deceived them into designated trap locations.</p>

    <p>He uses all kinds of traps and various means to knock these creatures out and take them away by force. He raises them in captivity in his own cave. Let these creatures become blood bags to support his wife.</p>

    <p>According to Bai Yinshou's plan, after his wife has absorbed one million living beings, if she takes another sip of his blood, she can directly transform into a human race and stay with him forever.</p>

    <p>From then on, no one could comment on his interracial marriage.</p>

    <p>But it's a pity that something unexpected happened at the last moment.</p>

    <p>That day. Zhang Zhui showed up...</p>

    <p>And then there will be no more.</p>

    <p>Originally, Qiao Yanyuan only listened to Bai Zhe. Someone blocked Bai Yinshou's love plan. Unexpectedly, this person turned out to be Zhang Zhui.</p>

    <p>Although Bai Yinshou always upholds justice in his actions and feels that he is forced to get on Bai Zhe's boat, in fact, both Bai Zhe and Qiao Yanyuan know very well that Bai Yinshou has a selfish and dark personality in his heart.</p>

    <p>There is no servant more worthy of training than the Eternal One of the human race who possesses hatred.</p>

    <p>His hatred for Zhang Zhui made Qiao Yanyuan very satisfied.</p>

    <p>"I originally wanted to stop there. But since they want to fly into flames, there is no need to stop them." Qiao Yanyuan said after staring at Bai Yinshou for a while.</p>

    <p>Then. www.uukanshu.net He stood up, straightened his suit in front of the floor-length mirror, and twisted his tie.</p>

    <p>Bai Yinshou saw Qiao Yanyuan at this moment. The gold and silver dragon horns above his head were flashing. Between the flash and darkness, it seemed that there was a cosmic law vibrating in it. It made people's hearts tremble.</p>

    <p>Immediately afterwards, Bai Yinshou's spirit seemed to be deeply guided by a spiritual force. Through the pair of dimmed gold and silver dragon horns, countless figures of Qiao Yanyuan appeared in his mind...</p>

    <p>They play different roles in different universes, different spaces, and different timelines...</p>

    <p>Gold and silver dragon horns. It seems to be a summons to them.</p>

    <p>After receiving the call, these "Qiao Yanyuan" in other parallel spaces stopped one after another, as if they were frozen.</p>

    <p>The next moment, Qiao Yanyuan's souls in countless parallel spaces seemed to be pulled away one after another. They turned into streams of spiritual power and gathered on the Moonlight at this moment. The dragonborn Qiao Yanyuan's body...</p>
