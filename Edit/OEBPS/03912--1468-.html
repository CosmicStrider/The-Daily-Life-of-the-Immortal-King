  <h1>Chapter 1468 The highlight moment of Zhuo Yi</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Devouring life force. This was originally Bi Xianzi's ability.</p>

    <p>Her nails dug deep into the man's chest.</p>

    <p>The man's body was like a balloon with a hole in it, drying up at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p>

    <p>Although the remaining two men were standing in other positions, they found that their bodies could not move.</p>

    <p>Bi Xianzi's resentment was too strong, creating a suffocating sense of oppression.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi looked at this scene in surprise. The replica version of {Ghost Book} actually rioted.</p>

    <p>This has never happened before...</p>

    <p>Because Bi Xianzi in the main book was suppressed, most of Bi Xianzi's demonic nature and resentment were suppressed. Therefore, Bi Xianzi in the replica version has been greatly weakened.</p>

    <p>Thinking that I have been using Bi Xianzi to play the role of recorder.</p>

    <p>The girl could not help but feel lingering fears.</p>

    <p>If Zhuo Yi hadn't reacted quickly just now, I'm afraid she would have died in the hands of Bi Xianzi just like this man.</p>

    <p>"Jiugong, things are now like this... we must stop the situation as soon as possible. Please explain it to me in detail after the rest of the things are resolved." Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>A stream of spiritual power emitted from his fingertips, quietly protecting Jiugong Liangzi so that the girl would not be disturbed by Bi Xianzi's resentment.</p>

    <p>But at this time. Zhuo Yi discovered the silly and cute side of Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>This has never been seen before.</p>

    <p>This ice-cold young lady who always pretends to be confident of victory will probably only activate such attributes when she is in a panic.</p>

    <p>Although it is inappropriate to discuss this now.</p>

    <p>But the heartbeat of the "fake heart ring" on Zhuo Yi's hand is obviously increasing.</p>

    <p>Liangzi is so...so cute!</p>

    <p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

    <p>"Save people."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi answered.</p>

    <p>"But that's the bad guy...he deserves to die."</p>

    <p>"He is an insider of the incident. So he must live." Zhuo Yi stepped forward.</p>

    <p>The girl behind him grabbed him. Her eyes were obviously anxious: "You are a Golden Core. Why are you so cool?"</p>

    <p>Although the book in Jiugong Liangzi's hand is just a replica of the Ghost Book, she knows every ghost on it clearly.</p>

    <p>Bi Xianzi...</p>

    <p>This is a ghost with a very high risk factor! The factor can directly reach SSR!</p>

    <p>Back then, the Jiugong family spent a huge price to set up a trap to capture her. Her strength is self-evident.</p>

    <p>Although Jiugong Liangzi still doesn't know why Bi Xianzi suddenly broke out.</p>

    <p>But Bi Xianzi, who has completely released the seal, may not be much scarier than Thuntihan Ha back then.</p>

    <p>However, what the girl didn't expect was that even so, the man in front of her still walked out without fear.</p>

    <p>He faced the light outside the door, leaving a generous reflection in the main hall, which actually made Jiugong Liangzi feel at ease.</p>

    <p>"Zhuo Yi! You old liar are you still trying to be brave... You will die! You are dead. I don't care about you!" The second before Zhuo Yi's figure completely disappeared from the palace. Jiugong Liangzi shouted at his back.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi had a smile on his lips. He did not directly answer the girl's words.</p>

    <p>"--Sword comes!"</p>

    <p>He waved his hand. An emerald green bamboo sword flew directly through the void and fell into his hand.</p>

    <p>Saving people is the most important thing now. Zhuo Yi can't worry about that much.</p>

    <p>He had undergone many systematic combat trainings in the Office of Strategic Deception. His combat skills were completely different from those six years ago.</p>

    <p>He is no longer the brave and just scapegoat he was six years ago.</p>

    <p>Obviously, there was a bit of surprise in Bi Xianzi's eyes.</p>

    <p>A Golden Core can still move under his own powerful resentment... This is simply unbelievable.</p>

    <p>Her other hand was ready. She planned to wait for the moment Zhuo Yi rushed over and stab him into his body.</p>

    <p>Now Bi Xianzi has just released the seal. It is the time when a lot of nutrition is needed.</p>

    <p>However. Zhuo Yi's speed exceeded Bi Xianzi's imagination.</p>

    <p>"So fast!"</p>

    <p>Her eyes couldn't keep up with the speed of such a Golden Core.</p>

    <p>I can only rely on intuition to find the direction of Zhuo Yi. Then stretch out the sharp claw of my left hand!</p>

    <p>"With my next sword, I will cut off your left arm! Then cut off your right arm as well!"</p>

    <p>Before the sword light fell, Zhuo Yi made an accurate prediction just like Fan Rui did before.</p>

    <p>"Sword of Destiny." This was originally one of "Yu"'s own abilities.</p>

    <p>Bi Xianzi's eyes were horrified. She was surprised that men could see through her own thoughts in advance.</p>

    <p>The next moment. Accompanied by a "chi!" sound!</p>

    <p>An extremely tricky angle that Bi Xianzi never expected. Zhuo Yi appeared there like a ghost. Lifting the ball up, Bi Xianzi's arms broke instantly!</p>

    <p>The leader of the trio on the ground, whose life force was extracted by Bi Xianzi, was dying. But there was still a glimmer of hope.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi is too fast.</p>

    <p>In a short period of time, Bi Xianzi's arms were chopped off with one sword. He also took the time to give the man on the ground a tonic to calm his nerves.</p>

    <p>For powerful wraiths, having their arms chopped off is not enough to make them scream, because their limbs are insubstantial. Even if they are chopped off, they can still be reorganized.</p>

    <p>At this time. Zhuo Yi is facing Bi Xianzi who has lost both arms.</p>

    <p>She is surrounded by powerful resentment, yin energy, evil spirit...</p>

    <p>All kinds of negative forces surged out.</p>

    <p>Apparently. The woman was trying to repair her arms.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, the opposite happened.</p>

    <p>Although "Yu"'s power is weaker than Jingke's, he still has the potential to be the second spiritual sword.</p>

    <p>Facing such an evil thing, after being baptized by the sword energy of this second spiritual sword, it was naturally not as easy to recover as usual.</p>

    <p>"Damn...damn..."</p>

    <p>Bi Xianzi let out a shrill roar. He looked like he was irritated.</p>

    <p>However, Zhuo Yi did not give her any chance to explode.</p>

    <p>"Next sword. Disappear..."</p>

    <p>A "chi" sound.</p>

    <p>Another sword strike. Bi Xianzi's eyes widened in shock. "Yu"'s sword tip had already pierced her head.</p>

    <p>The powerful sword energy swept through Bi Xianzi's body. Her body was reduced to ashes on the spot and dissipated directly.</p>

    <p>This ghost, which was claimed to have been recovered by the Jiugong family at great cost, completely disappeared from the earth.</p>

    <p>At the moment Bi Xianzi's body shattered, a beam of sunlight happened to fall from the sky, shining on the place where Bi Xianzi disappeared...</p>

    <p>Through the sunlight, the ghost's disappeared ashes swirled in the air, and then quickly dissipated with the wind.</p>

    <p>The picture looks a bit beautiful.</p>

    <p>"This may be the light of the righteous path..." Zhuo Yi laughed at himself inwardly.</p>

    <p>At this time. Zhuo Yi rechecks the scene.</p>

    <p>Suddenly I noticed that there seemed to be a Stone Spear on the ground...</p>

    <p>"Eh? Where did the Stone Spear come from?" Zhuo Yi picked up the Stone Spear. He felt curious.</p>

    <p>In fact. At the same time that Zhuo Yi killed Bi Xianzi.</p>

    <p>There are other ghosts released in the replica {Ghost Book}.</p>

    <p>They were planning to attack from behind.</p>

    <p>But before he could do anything, a Stone Spear came from nowhere, like a Stone Spear falling from the sky... and penetrated them like a candied haws.</p>

    <p>Because the sudden death was so fast, Zhuo Yi didn't notice it at all.</p>

    <p>Bi Xianzi at least left some fly ashes. These ghosts that were skewered with candied haws by Stone Spear left no trace at all.</p>

    <p>He squatted on the ground. Suddenly he couldn't help laughing.</p>

    <p>I know it. This should be Master's handiwork...</p>

    <p>At this time, Jiugong Liangzi stared in astonishment and walked out of the hall in surprise.</p>

    <p>She just witnessed everything in the main hall.</p>

    <p>"Zhuo Yi! You..."</p>

    <p>"What's wrong?" Zhuo Yi smiled: "I told you, nothing will happen."</p>

    <p>"But you...are just Golden Core!"</p>

    <p>"As long as you find the right method. Golden Core can still win."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi shrugged nonchalantly. Then he carefully looked at Jiugong Liangzi in front of him: "Jiugong, are you really okay? Your eyes are very red. It's not because you were worried about me just now. Did you cry?"</p>

    <p>"I...I'm not worried about you!" Jiugong Liangzi snorted.</p>
