  <h1>Chapter 2184 Wall Breaker Plan</h1>

  <div>

    <p>. The fastest update on the daily life of the Immortal King! The number of players gathered in Fuyun Town is no less than tens of millions. Because of this active volcano alchemy ceremony, the attention of players from all over the world was attracted. Indescribable strange gray fog came from a distance. It came and quickly completely submerged the sky above here.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling can feel that among the players present, many people have been affected by the gray fog. From a series of data, they have become real characters in the world of Itinerant Immortal.</p>

    <p>At first, some people found that they could no longer exit the game. They thought there was a problem with the game cabin or that the game server was being updated. That was why they were temporarily unable to exit the game. They were a little confused. But fortunately Panic has not yet spread directly.</p>

    <p>They were affected by Bai Zhe's gray fog. At the beginning, they all clearly understood the difference between the real world and the game world. As this gray fog continued to deepen, they began to gradually forget about themselves in the real world, and thought that they were now The game character you play is your true self.</p>

    <p>Model cognition.</p>

    <p>Such a method is no longer something that normal human monks can do. Even Taoist masters cannot directly imitate a human's cognition using such a simple and crude method.</p>

    <p>These players affected by the gray fog are like frogs cooked in warm water. Without realizing it, they have completely changed from real people living in the real world to a bunch of real and fake data people.</p>

    <p>I have to say. Wang Ling feels that Bai Zhe's methods are more sinister and ruthless than before. He directly chose to do it in such a game instead of doing it directly in the real world.</p>

    <p>If we were to directly summon this indescribable gray mist in the real world, Wang Ling could lift it all away with just a wave of his hand.</p>

    <p>So. On the one hand, this is to deliberately test his reaction. On the other hand, it is also to use this opportunity to "trap" him in the game world to settle the grudge with Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling...Look, the sky seems to have suddenly darkened..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong stared at the gray fog shrouding this place. His thoughts began to swirl: "Do you think we should open half a sect here tomorrow..."</p>

    <p>"By the way. Our household registration has not been moved to Fuyun Town yet..."</p>

    <p>"So later, we just need to transfer our household registration here. Then we can settle here directly."</p>

    <p>"As for Lao Huang... eh... we can adopt him directly..."</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun?" She was full of sarcastic words, which made Lao Huang deeply puzzled.</p>

    <p>In his impression, Sun Rong was not a person who could directly say such mindless words. But he didn't expect that at the moment when the gray fog enveloped him, Sun Rong's words were really shocking. It's beyond words. I'll kill Lao Huang and Wang Ling on the spot.</p>

    <p>"This...Miss Sun has been assimilated?" Lao Huang took a deep breath.</p>

    <p>The result is obvious.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed helplessly. He raised his hand very gently, and then carefully flicked Sun Rong's forehead.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's eyes that lost focus almost instantly regained focus. All the thoughts that had drifted away just now returned: "Wang Ling..."</p>

    <p>Immediately afterwards, there was a burst of crazy blushing!</p>

    <p>It makes Sun Rong want to dig a hole in the ground and get in...</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling. Don't get me wrong... What I just said doesn't count... I'm talking nonsense. I don't even know what I'm talking about..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong explained with a blushing face. She didn't know what happened to her just now. But she did understand what it was like to forget about the real world: "This Bai Zhe. It's really good." Danger. I felt like I was really living in the Itinerant Immortal ring at that moment. Everything outside had nothing to do with me. I just wanted to survive in this world."</p>

    <p>This is a manifestation of the molding of self-cognition.</p>

    <p>Due to this indescribable gray mist, all the players here are now being assimilated little by little.</p>

    <p>Launch a collective spell. The damage is too powerful. It can wake everyone up.</p>

    <p>But I'm not sure if there will be any accidents... I'll shoot them in the forehead one by one. This is unrealistic. So this is the significance of this "Operation Wall Breaker" with Mr. Zanghu as the core of the tactics.</p>

    <p>"So what should we do now? Everyone's perception... is gradually becoming mimetic. They think they are real players..." Sun Rong said anxiously.</p>

    <p>I have already experienced a change from reality to illusion. This kind of danger finally made Sun Rong realize how big Bai Zhe's ambition is.</p>

    <p>Driving the magic weapon, Mr. Zanghu came to the active volcano crater under the protection of the convoy NPC. The sudden and inexplicable gray mist in the sky gave him an ominous premonition.</p>

    <p>Mr. Zanghu knows it well. Success or failure depends on this.</p>

    <p>He put his hand into his sleeve, took out a red and blue pill that he had prepared in advance, and then threw it directly into the crater.</p>

    <p>This is not refining elixirs from an active volcano...</p>

    <p>Many players don't understand the significance of this action.</p>

    <p>But soon, following Mr. Zanghu's unintentional actions, a huge earthquake occurred between heaven and earth!</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>At the location of the crater, a bright beam of light spurted out from it. This was a rune with laws and order. It directly impacted the gray mist in the sky. And it broke in an instant. It turned into a moistening drizzle, crystal clear and translucent. Completely cover this area.</p>

    <p>The hurricane that shook out from the crater also blew this rune of order to the far reaches of the world.</p>

    <p>The rain-like runes dripped finely on every player's face. Almost instantly. Those faces that had lost themselves seemed to wake up one by one. They stood there dumbly...</p>

    <p>"It's done."</p>

    <p>Inside the carriage. Wang Ling said calmly while sitting.</p>

    <p>This pill.</p>

    <p>It was secretly created by Wang Ling in the game world. And just when Mr. Zanghu announced to the players around the world that he was going to make alchemy from an active volcano, it was secretly transmitted to Mr. Zanghu.</p>

    <p>It's not an ordinary operation. It's just Mr. Zanghu's move. All the players here, including Bai Zhe, didn't expect it. It was a feint.</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe didn't expect that such a player who didn't seem to have any abnormality could actually withstand the pressure of Gray Fog's cognitive model and complete this wall breaker plan.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"He's just an ordinary monk with only the Nascent Soul stage... Why can he maintain his own knowledge with a clear mind in the gray fog?" After realizing that he was missing a move after all, he was on the alien planet. Bai Zhe, who was absorbing the cosmic star energy, frowned deeply. He couldn't believe that the action he had planned for a long time was so easily cracked by that man again.</p>

    <p>Although on the surface it seems to have nothing to do with Wang Ling, Bai Zhe knows very well that if he can break this situation, there must be Wang Ling secretly assisting him.</p>

    <p>This person is invincible in the real world...</p>

    <p>In the game world, is it also invincible?</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe felt incredible.</p>
