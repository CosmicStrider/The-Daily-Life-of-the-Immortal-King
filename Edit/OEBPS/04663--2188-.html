  <h1>Chapter 2188 Stay up late</h1>

  <div>

    <p>. The fastest update on the daily life of the immortal king! Wang Ling has done a lot of things for Lao Huang.</p>

    <p>Even operations such as opening a university are already being planned.</p>

    <p>Of course. It would be a bit too labor intensive to build one now, and it would be difficult to complete in a short period of time. So Wang Ling's idea is to directly ask Lord Diulei to help fund the construction of a certain university's campus, and then talk to the president. Discuss. Just change the name of the school.</p>

    <p>This operation sounds like it will save a lot of energy and reduce emissions. With the funds, you will have a better campus environment and faculty. The price you pay is just a name change. Any university president would happily accept it.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the Office of Strategic Deception is currently the number one super sect designated by Huaxiu Country. It accepts the capital injection from the Office of Strategic Deception. At present, no sect or school would want to refuse.</p>

    <p>Everyone knows that the major shareholder behind the Office of Strategic Deception is Huaxiu Alliance. Having the backing of the Office of Strategic Deception is equivalent to having the backing of Huaxiu Alliance. By then, the status of the school will naturally be different.</p>

    <p>Helping the school change its name. It seems difficult. After all, it is just a matter of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Whether it is an ID card in the real world, a place of residence or a school. These hardware facilities are actually not difficult to solve for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The most difficult thing to solve is the interpersonal relationships in Lao Huang's fantasy. In order to prevent Lao Huang from becoming suspicious, Wang Ling must find a way to clear up all of Lao Huang's personal relationships.</p>

    <p>If there is really no way to implement the personal connections in the end. Wang Ling can only start with Lao Huang. Go directly to modify Lao Huang's memory.</p>

    <p>That's just replacing a part. So everything done above can minimize the damage to Lao Huang.</p>

    <p>Did so many things.</p>

    <p>On the surface, it all seems to be for Lao Huang...</p>

    <p>Who is it actually for?</p>

    <p>Wang Ying could only smile.</p>

    <p>That night. Wang Ling solved most of the things related to Lao Huang. It can be said that everything was done from top to bottom. Everything was done without leakage.</p>

    <p>He was obviously an awakened NPC character, but he had a real new identity in this modern scientific cultivation city overnight.</p>

    <p>Saturday, January 24th. There are 3 days left until the Earth Center Project begins.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong and Wang Ling met at the gate of 60 High School as scheduled. Wang Ling was wearing a dk uniform. His whole body was filled with a natural sense of youth.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling...your body..."</p>

    <p>In contrast. Sun Rong only feels that her white dress looks a little bit older.</p>

    <p>He is so good-looking...</p>

    <p>In the past, Sun Rong thought that no matter what she wore, she could cope with any situation. But now she discovered that she still had to think about her outfit a little bit when going out with the person she likes.</p>

    <p>Obviously I never felt this way before. Why do I have this tangled sense of gap now?</p>

    <p>Sun Rong analyzed the reasons. In the final analysis, Wang Ling was prettier than she imagined. And...she liked him even more than she imagined.</p>

    <p>The beginning of love is a kind of beauty that only ends briefly. No one knows what will happen in the future between two people.</p>

    <p>When she saw him wearing this outfit, she couldn't help but start thinking about it. Her thoughts drifted directly to what would happen more than ten years later.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling rubbed the back of his head dully: "Doesn't it look good?"</p>

    <p>This outfit was naturally matched to him by Mother Wang. Otherwise, a straight man like him would probably just put on a sweatshirt and go out, even when going out with girls.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong shook his head like a rattle. He couldn't help but give a thumbs up: "No, no! Very good!"</p>

    <p>There were many words of praise for Wang Ling in her mind. But when the words came to her lips, she was too shy to express them directly. In the end, she could only use body language to express the beauty of seeing this young boy.</p>

    <p>Lao Huang's home was arranged in the South Immortal District. On their way to visit Lao Huang, the two took the Ling Neng Line 18 subway there.</p>

    <p>Convenient. Fast. No traffic jams. Direct access... In addition, you can enjoy the scenery along the way.</p>

    <p>This atmosphere is really great.</p>

    <p>If there was no one else in the carriage, she would even want to confess her love to Wang Ling again.</p>

    <p>After all, visiting Lao Huang's house is just a good-natured excuse for Sun Rong. What she really wants is to stay with Wang Ling for a while longer.</p>

    <p>Admittedly, she doesn't expect Lao Huang to really bring her and Wang Ling together. In the end, emotional matters still have to rely on her own efforts.</p>

    <p>The two of them looked at the scenery outside the window. They were speechless. But the scene was very beautiful.</p>

    <p>She knows that rare alone time like this is the most suitable time to increase feelings.</p>

    <p>You can't just be so rigid. You have to take the initiative to find some topics.</p>

    <p>"Well...Wang Ling. Isn't it hard to raise a younger sister?"Sun Rong thought of Ah Nuan girl. She also has a younger sister. Although she is not a biological sister, she also gave love to this cousin back then. I've changed diapers.</p>

    <p>As for my sister, Sun Rong feels that there should be quite a lot of common topics with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "I remember when I was taking care of my sister, I stayed up late at night. Sometimes I would get up in the middle of the night to help. My cousin was not honest when she was a child. She liked to cling to me very much. Hahaha..."</p>

    <p>After Sun Rong finished speaking, Jingke couldn't sit still: "Sword Master, I stayed up late last night..."</p>

    <p>As soon as it popped up, it was directly pressed back by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Stay up late?"Sun Rong wondered.</p>

    <p>"It's OK..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Feng Qingyun shook her head.</p>

    <p>It was indeed a bit late to stay up late last night to deal with Lao Huang's matter. It wasn't because of her. It was just an accident...</p>
