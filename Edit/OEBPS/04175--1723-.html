  <h1>Chapter 1723 Medical Miracle</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In fact, meeting Shou Chong here was a bit unexpected for Wang Ming, but it can also be said to be reasonable. In order to reactivate the divine brain, Master Wu Xin specially transferred Shou Chong's will and then swallowed it.</p>

    <p>In other words, in fact, in Master Wu Xin's mental space, a small part of it belongs to Shou Chong's own will.</p>

    <p>And now, Master Wu Xin invaded his spiritual world. Naturally, he also brought Shou Chong in with him.</p>

    <p>"How's it going? Can you still hold on?" Wang Ming crouched down and checked Shou Chong's pulse.</p>

    <p>He looked extremely weak. His face was pale, and his body was so thin that he was almost skin and bones. It was hard for Wang Ming to imagine how he managed to survive these days.</p>

    <p>Shou Chong raised his tired eyes and stared at the man standing next to him. He lowered his voice: "I...I'm so hungry..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming thought for a moment, and then began to say seriously: "The grass is luxuriant in the cold weather. The red seedlings are reflected in the wind and the willows are reflected on the embankment. I will wait until I have a home. The cuckoos will stop singing in my ears."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming "I am a stranger in a foreign land. I miss my family even more during the festive season. I know my brothers from afar. I plant dogwood everywhere and there is one less person..."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong: "?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "Two orioles sing in the green willows. A row of egrets ascends to the blue sky. The window contains Qianqiu snow in the Xiling Mountains. The door is docked with ships thousands of miles away from Dongwu..."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong: "??"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "The spring breeze of reform is blowing everywhere. The Chinese people are striving for success..."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong: "???"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming memorized more than a dozen poems in a row. Shou Chong's complexion couldn't help but improve a lot under the infusion of these ancient poems. Not only that, even his thin body began to gradually become fuller. The whole person regained his energy: " Strange. How could this happen?"</p>

    <p>Seeing Shou Chong recovered as before, Wang Ming finally breathed a sigh of relief: "It's exactly what I thought. We are in the spiritual space now. So what we need is spiritual food."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong suddenly realized: "I see...so I just need to keep memorizing poems?"</p>

    <p>"That's the theory."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming nodded: "I'm curious. How did you survive these days?"</p>

    <p>"Drink water." Shou Chong said: "I found that the water in this spiritual space does not seem to be sea water. It is not salty. It is drinkable... So that's it. I survived by drinking this water. What's the matter? Problem?"</p>

    <p>"No... there's no problem... I'll just recite the poem later. This water has no nutrients..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said with twitching eyes.</p>

    <p>He never imagined that one day the water in his brain could actually save a person. It can be called a medical miracle.</p>

    <p>In the cabin, after the two calmed down, Wang Ming began to look at him and asked:</p>

    <p>"How much do you know about the divine brain? Or do you know anything about the divine brain?"</p>

    <p>"I just heard some rumors roughly from my senior sister Fengchu. I don't know whether they are true or false. If Wu Xin hadn't been behind the scenes to take me away and absorb me into his spiritual space, maybe I would never be able to confirm the truth in my life."</p>

    <p>"In such a spiritual space, the master of the spiritual space is the gods. It is the same concept as the core world among cultivators. However, the divine brain is too overbearing. Even the incomplete part is like a tarsal maggot. You can take other people's space for your own use. It's really scary."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong said while sighing.</p>

    <p>When he said these words, he was actually shocked by the size of Wang Ming's mental space. He knew that Wang Ming was not a cultivator, but an ordinary human being who was not a cultivator could actually expand his mental space to As vast as the sea... This is something that many cultivators, even those who major in spiritual magic, may not be able to do.</p>

    <p>"As a person, the thing I'm not afraid of the most is challenges."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming laughed: "This is my spiritual space. If he wants to take it away, it won't be that easy."</p>

    <p>"Are you sure you can get it back?" Shou Chong hesitated.</p>

    <p>The opponent is an Eternal after all.</p>

    <p>Even if it is a broken body, he has now successfully become the master of this spiritual space. If he is given some more time, when the other party's brain has completely recovered, even if they want to bite back, there is nothing they can do. "It turns out that I have it. This idea. Now that you are included, the probability of getting it back is even greater."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said confidently: "How about it? Do you want to join forces with me? If I take it back later, I have a way to separate you from my body. I can help you reshape a physical body and resurrect you. You probably don't want to stay in someone else's body forever, right?"</p>

    <p>"It's natural."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong nodded: "I know you. So I also believe you have this ability. But the key is. What should we do now?"</p>

    <p>"It's very simple. Just sink that giant aircraft carrier. Then the ships we use for attack will become the master ships of this spiritual space again."</p>

    <p>"That's your giant aircraft carrier... I've seen it before. It has the equivalent of fifty aircraft carriers. It's as big as an island! How can it be so easy to sink!"</p>

    <p>"That's my ship. When I built it, I left a backdoor. As long as a shell hits a key location, it can start the self-destruct program." Wang Ming said.</p>

    <p>"Even so, where do the construction materials come from? The only materials we have now are this broken ghost ship." Shou Chong said.</p>

    <p>This question is indeed a difficult one.</p>

    <p>They are now exiled to a very far away area. It is still different from when they were drifting with the Ghost Head Dao on the raft. They cannot create inventions directly from the sea by "picking up garbage."</p>

    <p>"Do you know about the Abandoned Sea?"</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Ming looked at Shou Chong and asked: "In every hot spiritual space, there is such a sea of abandonment."</p>

    <p>The so-called sea of waste. It can also be called the "sea of bad ideas" or the "sea of useless inventions." Scientific research is a path of continuous progress in exploration. Before something is successfully developed, it is often developed first. Many failed products.</p>

    <p>In addition, in the research and exploration of cultivation science, sometimes in order to satisfy their own bad tastes or to raise funds for their own research experiments, some scientists are often invited to make some useless inventions and develop various IQ tax products...</p>

    <p>At this point, Wang Ming feels that Shou Chong is more experienced than himself.</p>

    <p>And these so-called "bad ideas" and "useless inventions" will eventually form a place similar to a recycling bin in the mental space of these people. That is, a "sea of waste."</p>

    <p>"The Sea of Abandonment...No! I don't have such a thing! My inventions are always useful! They are definitely not useless products!" Shou Chong crossed his arms and lowered his head, as if he refused to admit it.</p>

    <p>"Hey... don't be like this Mr. Shou Chong. Every scientist has a few failed inventions. I have one too. You don't have to belittle yourself. Now your and my spiritual space are attached to the same space. Those in the Sea of Abandonment Things may not all be yours. They may also be mine."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming knows that maybe this is a public execution for Shou Chong. But now at this critical juncture, there is really no other way...</p>

    <p>"So, if you agree, give me your hand. With the brain waves of the two of us, combine and spread out in this state, and sense the abandoned sea. It shouldn't be a problem." Wang Ming said helplessly. said.</p>

    <p>"Hahaha! That's right! It might be yours too!"</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, Shou Chong couldn't help but feel happy: "Okay! Then I will sense the existence of this sea area."</p>

    <p>Then he handed his hand to Wang Ming with confidence.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The flow of time in mental space is relatively slow.</p>

    <p>One hour has passed in the outside world. Maybe only one minute of thinking has occurred in the mental space.</p>

    <p>In this way, the two people drove the ghost ship. After driving on the sea for about 20 hours, they found the legendary abandoned sea area...</p>

    <p>Wang Ming and Shou Chong gradually saw it.</p>

    <p>A lot of bad inventions are floating on this sea.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming used the fishing net on the boat to randomly catch a bad invention. It was a very strange-looking doll. It looked like a piggy bank.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming remembered. This seems to be a very popular weight loss product on the Internet a while ago. It is called "Fat Reduction Coin Jar." It is said that if you feel guilty after eating a big meal, you can go here. Put a 1 yuan coin into the doll.</p>

    <p>Then the doll will start shaking like crazy for a full 10 minutes. It is said that it can help lose 600 calories in 30 minutes. It is equivalent to the calories burned by running for an hour...</p>

    <p>"Hahaha! You didn't invent this thing, did you? It seems useless at first sight." Shou Chong laughed loudly.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "..."</p>

    <p>Of course, such a useless thing could not have been made by Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>But for the sake of team harmony, he had to smile awkwardly and put the doll into Shou Chong's hand. He was going to continue casting a fishing net to catch these floating waste inventions on the sea to see if there were any usable parts.</p>

    <p>As a result, as soon as the doll arrived in Shou Chong's hands, a very sharp electronic doll sound suddenly came out.</p>

    <p>"dad!"</p>

    <p>Just listen. This doll-shaped fat-reducing coin jar suddenly shouted to Shou Chong.</p>

    <p>"Who...who is your dad..." Shou Chong was shocked.</p>

    <p>The baby shouted even louder. He explained excitedly: "Dad, Daddy! Have you forgotten? You invented me!"</p>

    <p>At this point, the air suddenly solidified...</p>
