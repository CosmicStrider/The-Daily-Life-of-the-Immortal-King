  <h1>Chapter 1868 Soul exchange across eternity</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Two hundred kilos of moral integrity...</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, everyone in the audience was excited.</p>

    <p>As we all know, this game is worthless to people who are not interested.</p>

    <p>After all, Ku Xuan's integrity had been shattered a long time ago. It fell to the ground one by one!</p>

    <p>No one paid attention to the previous price offered by this similarly unscrupulous powerful man. They continued to participate in the auction with their own unique talents and treasures.</p>

    <p>"I have a Haotian ruler! I decided to exchange it!" At this time, a young man's voice came from the VIP room Number 3. His voice was not very loud, but it had a deafening feeling.</p>

    <p>The whole audience was in an uproar. This Haotian Ruler is an immortal treasure in the Southern Region Imperial Palace! It possesses the native power of the Southern Emperor. It is also the prize provided by the Southern Emperor at the Four Regions Immortal Conference a hundred years ago!</p>

    <p>"I remember the year when the Haotian Ruler was launched. The person who won the championship was a casual cultivator named Duan Jian..."</p>

    <p>"Who is this person? Duan Jian? But I feel that he is younger than Duan Jian. Not quite like him."</p>

    <p>"Could he be Duan Jian's son?"</p>

    <p>For a time, many people began to discuss the identity of this young man.</p>

    <p>"Duan Jian has no son. You don't have to guess, I know this. This young gentleman is called Tang Moyuan. He is the descendant of the famous weapon refiner Tang Gen Haojiu."</p>

    <p>"It turns out it was him..."</p>

    <p>Everyone was stunned.</p>

    <p>Tang Gen Haojiu was also a famous weapon refiner. He was extremely famous throughout the ages.</p>

    <p>Although he doesn't know why the Haotian Ruler fell into Tang Moyuan's hands, Tang Gen Haojiu is a very decent person.</p>

    <p>Since the thing is in his son's hands, he must have reached some level of deal with Duan Jian back then.</p>

    <p>But using the Haotian Ruler in exchange for this mythical beast hair was something that no one thought of.</p>

    <p>The value of this Haotian Ruler is worth at least 20 million mixed spirit stones. It has already crushed the bids of everyone present.</p>

    <p>However, at this time, King Tiankun took action again. They wondered if it was related to the superiors. He refused to give up at all.</p>

    <p>"I will offer 30 million mixed spiritual stones! Plus a mixed immortal stone!"</p>

    <p>As soon as he spoke, the whole place fell into dead silence.</p>

    <p>This was originally something that the Western Emperor had plundered from the Eastern Imperial Palace... He was originally going to participate in this auction. But he didn't expect that King Tiankun would directly exchange it for it.</p>

    <p>In fact, King Tiankun also had his own considerations regarding this decision. He came to the Central Auction House this time because of Zhang Zhui's notice letter.</p>

    <p>If we wait for the immortal stone to be auctioned as a bidding item, the time in between will be very long. Instead, various unstable factors will arise.</p>

    <p>But now if it is directly exchanged as a product of the transaction, once the transaction is completed, then this immortal stone will have nothing to do with him.</p>

    <p>Neither he nor Emperor Xi will suffer any loss of face.</p>

    <p>After all, what Zhang Zhui said in the notice letter was that he would directly steal the immortal stone during the bidding and transaction process. But now he is not following the routine. Zhang Zhui may directly mess up his position because of this.</p>

    <p>Of course, this idea was not thought of by King Tiankun himself.</p>

    <p>Instead, it was the opinions of the two snake attendants beside him.</p>

    <p>"You have done a great job! When I return, I will favor you." King Tiankun was very satisfied with this proposal.</p>

    <p>30 million mixed spiritual stones. Add a mixed immortal stone worth the same 30 million... Such a price is already astronomical.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at it in a daze. He didn't expect that his hair was so valuable. Thinking back to the hair that he left to the barber shop to trim in those years, it was simply gold all over the floor! And it was worth more than gold!</p>

    <p>"What should I do? This is a trick. If the deal is concluded, if the Immortal Stone is stolen by Senior Zhang, it will have nothing to do with him at all."</p>

    <p>"That's easy. Just let the water go during the transaction." At this time, Zhang Zhui, who played Li Ren, laughed sinisterly.</p>

    <p>Now he completely remembered what happened back then.</p>

    <p>"Release the water?" Sun Rong was puzzled. She looked a little confused.</p>

    <p>And at this moment, Zhang Zhui, who played Li Ren, suddenly focused his attention on a blank place: "Are you there? Zhang Zhui?"</p>

    <p>The place was a mass of nothingness. Nothing could be seen. At first glance, Zhang Zhui, who played Li Ren, seemed to be talking to the air.</p>

    <p>"Don't be nervous. We have no intention of exposing you." Zhang Zhui, who plays Li Ren, laughed: "No matter how you deceive other people's eyes, you can't deceive me."</p>

    <p>After a while, a strange man's voice came from the private room.</p>

    <p>This voice is none other than young Zhang Zhui.</p>

    <p>He was originally lurking elsewhere. However, due to King Tiankun's sudden change of tactics, he had to change his location and came to the private room where Wang Ling was.</p>

    <p>Because once the deal is concluded, the immortal stone will be sent directly to the room under the arrangement of the auction house.</p>

    <p>"Who are you..." Young Zhang Zhui didn't expect that he would be exposed. He was very nervous for a moment.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry about who I am. I'm just telling you. We won't take action later. You can take action directly when they are walking down the aisle carrying the immortal stone. Don't have any scruples."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui, who plays Li Ren, said: He arranged his younger self clearly.</p>

    <p>"Why did you help me?" Young Zhang Zhui frowned. He didn't understand.</p>

    <p>"The enemy of the enemy is the friend. King Tiankun. He is the representative of the Western Emperor. And we are the enemies of the Western Emperor."</p>

    <p>There was silence for a long moment. Young Zhang Zhui never responded.</p>

    <p>He was very cautious. He was thinking about whether this was a game or not.</p>

    <p>As a result, Zhang Zhui, who played Li Ren, couldn't help it. He took a deep breath and said, "You must believe me, because I know your secret..."</p>

    <p>These words made Wang Ling, Sun Rong, and Wang Zhen all stunned. They all showed expressions of eating melons.</p>

    <p>So this is the next step to report your family's dirty laundry?</p>

    <p>In order to persuade young Zhang Zhui to cooperate with the action. Wang Ling felt that this was a bit too hard.</p>

    <p>"What do you know..." Young Zhang Zhui looked very nervous.</p>

    <p>"I know about your fetish for women." Old Zhang Zhui said, "If you don't believe it, I can tell you directly."</p>

    <p>"No! I believe it!" Young Zhang Zhui broke into a cold sweat.</p>

    <p>This really pokes at his weakness. If this person really knows something and tells it, this is the scene of a large-scale social death...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After about a few more minutes, Wang Ling's hair was finally bought by King Tiankun for a sky-high price of 30 million mixed spiritual stones and one mixed immortal stone.</p>

    <p>However, what no one expected was that while the Central Auction House was transporting the storage bag containing 30 million mixed spiritual stones and the mixed immortal stone, an accident happened in the end.</p>

    <p>Although in order to ensure the absolute safety of the transaction, the auction house specially selected two experts and Liu Renwen to personally deliver the items to each other. However, just when the items were delivered to the door of Wang Ling's private room.</p>

    <p>The entire Central Auction House suddenly emitted a puff of snow-white smoke.</p>

    <p>The smoke quickly expanded to the entire auction room...</p>

    <p>Young Zhang Zhui was waiting for the opportunity and was about to take action. What he didn't expect was that Liu Renwen's reaction was also very quick. He tried his best to protect his auction item and held it tightly, not giving young Zhang Zhui any chance.</p>

    <p>"Hey, I'm still a little green." Old Zhang Zhui smiled slightly at this time. He just waved his sleeves.</p>

    <p>The Immortal Stone guarded by Liu Renwen magically appeared in his palm.</p>

    <p>Then, taking advantage of the chaos, he directly thrust the Immortal Stone into the hands of young Zhang Zhui: "Leave the rest to me. Run!"</p>
