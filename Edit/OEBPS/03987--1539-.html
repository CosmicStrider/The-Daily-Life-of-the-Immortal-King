  <h1>Chapter 1539 The mysterious object "Destiny"</h1>

  <div>

    <p>To be honest. Although Chaos Armor and Corpse Map are chaos weapons, they are just two toys in the eyes of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He was being chased by a corpse map. It seemed weak. In fact, it's a chance for Jingke, who has been merged with Bai Qiao. Jingke, who became Jingbai, will be given a chance.</p>

    <p>Facts have proved that Wang Ling's thinking is correct.</p>

    <p>It's rare to have a coach who can defeat Jingke at the beginning.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid it will be difficult to encounter such an experience in the future.</p>

    <p>"When you encounter strength, you will become stronger." That's why Jingke became the King of Sword World. It is also the reason why Jingke can become the number one sword under Wang Ling. The high growth rate of + level. The strong learning ability that comes with it. Jingke's strength is unrivaled in the Sword Spirit circle.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that the main reason why Zheng failed in this battle is that there were too many redundant actions and nonsense.</p>

    <p>Too much time was given.</p>

    <p>Maybe you were indeed stronger than Jingke a second ago.</p>

    <p>But if you don't kill Jingke immediately.</p>

    <p>Then in the next second, when Jingke learns and achieves superior combat power, you will be the one who is destroyed.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling thought about this summary of the battle and still did not say it out loud.</p>

    <p>Because this seems to be a problem that everyone who fights against them has...</p>

    <p>When Jingbai put forward the demand for "Immaterial Stone."</p>

    <p>Zheng's reaction is actually very surprising.</p>

    <p>Because it looks like Zheng is not only familiar with this kind of stone, but also gives people the illusion that... this stone seems to be very common.</p>

    <p>"What exactly is the Immaterial Stone?" Monk Jin Deng couldn't help but stepped forward and asked, "If you can provide the Immaterial Stone, Ling Zhenren might be happy. Not only that, he might also be able to repair your Two torn pieces of Chaos."</p>

    <p>"Repair the Chaos Device?"</p>

    <p>Zheng laughed: "Monk, are you kidding me? What is a Chaos Device? You and I should know both. The Supreme Corpse Map and my Chaos Armor are in pieces. There is no way to repair them. possibility."</p>

    <p>The monk spread his hands and showed an expression of disbelief.</p>

    <p>Everyone did not speak. Instead, they waited quietly for Zheng to tell the origin of "Immaterial Stone."</p>

    <p>This magical black stone that Wang Ling has been thinking about for a long time. What kind of past does it have... This is something that even Wang Ling is very curious about.</p>

    <p>"Do you still remember Dao Ancestor's state regression in the Eternal Era?" Zheng said.</p>

    <p>The blood on his body has dried up. When he spoke, there was a strong aura of kidney deficiency in his body. It seemed that he had difficulty breathing.</p>

    <p>The indestructible jet-black fur on his arms and chest was injured by the frightening sword energy. It was burned to pieces by the sword energy.</p>

    <p>If it weren't for the fact that the topic is very serious now.</p>

    <p>The monk felt that he could not help but laugh out loud on the spot.</p>

    <p>He sat down cross-legged and said while adjusting his breath.</p>

    <p>We have completely given up on fighting Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling did not sacrifice his Dharma Spirit. But even so, he had to admit that the young man in front of him was indeed ridiculously strong.</p>

    <p>He has never even beaten the opponent's sword spirit. How could he be this young man's opponent?</p>

    <p>"The matter of realm regression. Is it related to the Immaterial Stone?" The monk frowned and thought after hearing Zheng's words.</p>

    <p>Because in his impression, Dao Ancestor Wang's state is always advancing and retreating.</p>

    <p>It's not that it's unstable. It's just that Dao Ancestor Wang sometimes seeks death to experiment with new spells or explore some unknown areas. Therefore, there is often a phenomenon of regression in his realm.</p>

    <p>But Dao Ancestor Wang is the pioneer of cultivation civilization after all.</p>

    <p>It doesn't matter even if your realm regresses.</p>

    <p>Because you can practice cultivation again.</p>

    <p>And the time. It won't be too long.</p>

    <p>"Lord Dao Ancestor's state of decline happens from time to time. But that time in the Eternal Era is the most serious one. Don't you have any doubts, monk?" Zheng said.</p>

    <p>"What the hell happened."</p>

    <p>"The destiny changes. Cracks appear. Dao Ancestor has to find a way."</p>

    <p>The monk frowned when he heard this.</p>

    <p>The so-called "fate chaos position" refers to the center of chaos in the universe. It is always in a quiet state. If something happens, the place of chaos will expand into the universe wantonly.</p>

    <p>The dark matter hidden in the universe will completely explode. I am afraid that all life in the entire universe will be annihilated.</p>

    <p>"Is there a crack in the destiny mix position?" the monk asked.</p>

    <p>But he felt that things were not that simple.</p>

    <p>If it were just a story about Nuwa patching up the sky, it would indeed be a bit disappointing.</p>

    <p>"A mysterious object appeared in the fate of that year. Dao Ancestor said that if someone is interested in getting it, it will affect all living beings in the universe. Since then, Dao Ancestor has been thinking of ways to seal the mysterious object."</p>

    <p>"What on earth is that? You are his dharma image. Have you never seen it?"</p>

    <p>"I can't see clearly what the mysterious object looks like. Even Dao Ancestor can't see clearly."</p>

    <p>Zheng sighed: "During that time, Dao Ancestor went deep into dangerous places to search for the Immaterial Stone. He also fabricated the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube and placed it in various directions in the universe. It was said to restrict chaos. In fact, it was all to suppress this mysterious object. Come."</p>

    <p>"But what the hell is that..."</p>

    <p>"I don't know." Zheng shook his head: "Dao Ancestor calls it the destiny. Those who get it can get the destiny."</p>

    <p>"That's it." At this time, Jingbai nodded: "In other words, the Immaterial Stone was brought by Dao Ancestor Wang to restrict the destiny."</p>

    <p>"That's it."</p>

    <p>Zheng said: "I don't know where Dao Ancestor brought it from. But I do still have some left."</p>

    <p>"This thing has powerful sealing power. Don't you feel uncomfortable?"</p>

    <p>"Not at all." Zheng said, "Because I have pica. I often eat strange things, which causes severe constipation."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Zheng: "Sometimes if you use too much force, people will take off like a jet. So, this Immaterial Stone actually helped me. It is in every bathroom in my mansion. There is a piece."</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Obviously. This is a tasteful picture.</p>

    <p>Just listening. Even Wang Ling couldn't help but frown.</p>

    <p>"You want Immaterial Stone. I can provide it. But the condition is that you must release Xiren. This is my agreement with the master. Please don't embarrass me." Zheng said.</p>

    <p>After that, he took out a black box. With a flick of his fingertips, it fell into Wang Ling's hand: "The black stone inside is the size of an egg. If you still feel it's not enough, I'll go back to the toilet of my mansion to get some."</p>

    <p>"That's enough."Wang Ling took the black box.</p>

    <p>Then use the power to release Peng Xiren's soul as agreed.</p>

    <p>After Peng Xiren was released, he looked cursing.</p>

    <p>Just as he was about to speak, Zheng covered his mouth.</p>

    <p>Then there was a loud "slap" slap in the face.</p>

    <p>Zheng was angry: "Prodigal thing! For you, I destroyed two chaos devices!"</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren felt that he had never been so wronged.</p>

    <p>But now, he can only endure it.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Zheng appeared this time. This was something Peng Xiren did not expect.</p>

    <p>He thought Dao Ancestor Wang disappeared.</p>

    <p>As the spirit of Dharma, Zheng. will also disappear together.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, Zheng, as an independent individual, appeared in front of him at this moment...</p>

    <p>And.</p>

    <p>What exactly is that mysterious thing called "Destiny?"</p>

    <p>This time, Peng Xiren felt that he was defeated.</p>

    <p>But a lot of new ideas were added to his mind...</p>
