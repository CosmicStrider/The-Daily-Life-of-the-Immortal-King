  <h1>Chapter 1426 A competent actor</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Sun Rong's current strength is not what it used to be.</p>

    <p>When this breath is released.</p>

    <p>The skirt underneath her body rolled and surged with the sword energy.</p>

    <p>The blue skirt blew like waves.</p>

    <p>The onlookers of the sword spirits in the stands were frightened by this powerful sword energy. They could not imagine that an unknown spirit sword could explode with such power.</p>

    <p>Most people were frightened by this sword energy.</p>

    <p>But on such occasions, some old gentlemen will inevitably appear.</p>

    <p>"It's up! A little higher! Yes, we're about to see it!" Some sword spirits stared at the girl's blue skirt, wanting to get a glimpse of the scenery underneath.</p>

    <p>They had deliberately followed the crowd in the opening to stimulate Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>The purpose was to arouse the anger of this human girl.</p>

    <p>Because sword energy basically works from the bottom up.</p>

    <p>Once it breaks out, it can easily disappear.</p>

    <p>However, the result disappointed these "old gentlemen" among the Sword Spirits.</p>

    <p>Because just when the hem of the skirt was about to be blown up, the "anti-gravity mode" of Sun Rong this French skirt was instantly activated!</p>

    <p>All I can say is that this is the dress Ajuan gave her.</p>

    <p>Anti-gravity mode. Very practical for every girl.</p>

    <p>In the field, there was an anti-gravity blue skirt that was swinging wildly but was not blown up.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong pulled Aohai's sword out of the scabbard bit by bit.</p>

    <p>Every time he drew out an inch, the sword energy on the field surged like a roaring sea of anger.</p>

    <p>When the sword body is completely withdrawn.</p>

    <p>The passive version of "Man and Sword Unity" is fully activated.</p>

    <p>After a burst of light and shadow changes, Sun Rong and Aohai's figure completely merged into one.</p>

    <p>The girl's blue eyes are deeper than before. There are stars in them, exuding a beautiful and moving brilliance.</p>

    <p>Aohai's dark blue evening dress also perfectly blends with it. There are many ripples symbolizing the sea on the skirt. It looks more majestic and gorgeous than before.</p>

    <p>Even the color of his hair changed. After the sword and man merged into one, it turned into the silvery gray of Aohai.</p>

    <p>Of course, none of the above is the key.</p>

    <p>The key is!</p>

    <p>The girl found that her chest seemed to be a lot heavier...</p>

    <p>Because the monk warned her, she needs to be extra careful when using Aohai on Earth. So there is no need to take it out of the sheath unless necessary.</p>

    <p>After fusing three Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cubes, the newly upgraded passive version of "Man and Sword in One" needs to be completely unsheathed in order to achieve such a combined mode.</p>

    <p>So it is also the first time for Sun Rong to experience such a combination change.</p>

    <p>In the Tianzihao guest room.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er was excited and incoherent: "Rongrong has grown! It's great! Rongrong can grow, and I have grown too! The airbag cushioning plan will be realized in the future!"</p>

    <p>"..." Er Ha opened his mouth. In the end, he said nothing.</p>

    <p>It doesn't know where Sun Ying'er inherited the label of a veteran driver.</p>

    <p>She can really drive on any broken road...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, in the sword fighting arena, Wu Jin and Lao Man, who also participated in this competition, were also deeply impressed by the sword energy emanating from Aohai.</p>

    <p>"As expected of Miss Sun Rong." The two of them sighed in their hearts.</p>

    <p>Of course. They are not participating in the game to win the championship. They are here to send Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Therefore, when entering the venue, Wu Jin and Lao Man were also thinking about how to show off their outstanding acting skills.</p>

    <p>To everyone's surprise, when the competition in the King Group started, no sword spirit took the lead in attacking the other sword spirits.</p>

    <p>Here is the difference in tactical thinking between the King Group Sword Spirit and the Bronze Group Sword Spirit.</p>

    <p>This is also one of the reasons why the bronze group is not as good as the king group...</p>

    <p>Especially in such a chaotic melee, the party that launches the offensive first will definitely be the loser. A large-scale attack will only suffer more intense concentrated fire, and will be eliminated first.</p>

    <p>So before the start of the game, the sword spirits of the king group had the same idea.</p>

    <p>That is to prioritize alliances!</p>

    <p>Take allies as a unit. Eliminate the others first!</p>

    <p>As for how to choose allies, for the sword spirits of the king group, this is something that does not require much consideration.</p>

    <p>According to the material of the sword itself or the type of the sword itself, the camps can be easily divided.</p>

    <p>So when the King's Group match started, a mysterious scene of silence appeared in the entire sword arena. Sun Rong could feel the overflowing sword energy intersecting in the air.</p>

    <p>The sword spirits of the King Group are dispersing their sword energy. They are using their sword energy to establish special spiritual communication and search for their own kind.</p>

    <p>Then, the voices of various cliques surged in the sword fighting arena.</p>

    <p>"Big Sword Party! Follow me! If you don't come, you are a lackey!"</p>

    <p>"Heaven did not give birth to me with a long sword. Eternity is like a long night! Where is the Long Sword Party?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Many Sword Spirits watching the match were puzzled. They didn't understand why these Sword Spirits from the King Group hadn't started fighting yet.</p>

    <p>Because their cultivation level is too low, they cannot hear the sword spirits of the king group communicating with their sword energy.</p>

    <p>At the judging table, Yu Ling frowned slightly: "Such an alliance is actually not good for Miss Sun. The Sword Spirits of the King's Group form small teams in this way, and their attacks are more organized and disciplined. In addition, they They are all hostile to Miss Sun's existence. I'm afraid it's a bit difficult."</p>

    <p>"not necessarily."</p>

    <p>Jiu You shook his head and said: "Miss Sun is Master Bai Qiao's disciple. You have also seen the sword energy revealed during the process of uniting the swords."</p>

    <p>"It's a little strange. I don't know why I can feel the power of Heavenly Dao from Aohai's sword energy." Yu Ling frowned slightly. She didn't know that Aohai had merged with the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube.</p>

    <p>Jiu You smiled: "Aohai now has four cores. There are four Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cubes in his body."</p>

    <p>"Four Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cubes!" Yu Ling almost screamed. After realizing that he had lost his composure, Yu Ling's face turned red: "Why do you have to fuse so many..."</p>

    <p>"She is Master Bai Qiao's disciple. Of course she gets preferential treatment. Now the new Rubik's Cube has replaced the old Rubik's Cube. And the old Rubik's Cube has been recycled and reused in this way. It's good." Jiu You said.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if it was envy or jealousy. Yu Ling snorted softly: "Humph. It's just that (lemon)..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At this time, a full three minutes had passed since the start of the game.</p>

    <p>None of the sword spirits of the king group made any movement in the field. They were using their sword energy to communicate quickly. The voices of those groups could not be heard.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, in the spiritual space established with sword energy, someone suddenly shouted: "Sun RongSun Rong I love you! I am Dajian! I will always support Sun RongSun Rong Sun Rong!"</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun! I am on your side! No one can stop me. The Dagger Party will always love Sun Rong!"</p>

    <p>After these two calls, the Sword Spirits of the King Group who were currently forming a team all showed angry expressions.</p>

    <p>"Damn! Who called it! You're so weird! There's a traitor in our Sword Spirit team!"</p>

    <p>"No! Not one. There seem to be many!"</p>

    <p>In the sword spirit exchange channel, Wu Jin and Lao Man changed their voices in various ways to sow discord on the spot to prevent these kings from forming an alliance plan to form a sword spirit.</p>

    <p>And soon. Their plan took effect.</p>

    <p>After hearing this, the sword spirits who were originally looking for an organization had furious expressions on their faces. Everyone looked like a traitor.</p>

    <p>The scene quickly began to turn chaotic.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's eyes became wary.</p>

    <p>At this moment, a female sword spirit with short white hair and a pair of leather shorts suddenly came towards Sun Rong: "The day when the broken sword is reforged. When the knight returns!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"It's all because of you, a human woman. Take my sword first! I will cut you from Mount Everest to a flat-topped mountain!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
