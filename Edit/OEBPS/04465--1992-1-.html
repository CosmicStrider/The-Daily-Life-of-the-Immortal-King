  <h1>Chapter 1992 The person who settles everything</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: Li Changzhe's nose felt sore for a moment. He never expected that Wang Ling would still show up even in such an embarrassing situation.</p>

    <p>Whether it helps him or not is another matter. But this friendship has already made Li Changzhe extremely grateful.</p>

    <p>Although I have only known Wang Ling for a short time, Li Changzhe is very clear about Wang Ling's social phobia. He is most afraid of appearing in crowded places.</p>

    <p>He had previously made an appointment with Wang Ling to meet in the evening. He thought Wang Ling would definitely not come over in this situation. Unexpectedly, he still showed up as scheduled.</p>

    <p>What a good brother!</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe was moved.</p>

    <p>I almost shed tears of excitement.</p>

    <p>To be honest, he didn't care at all whether Wang Ling would come to his rescue. But just with this attitude, he was already very touched.</p>

    <p>Then in the next second, the door to the private room was pushed open.</p>

    <p>An elegant young man with a thunder pattern on his forehead, wearing a white ancient clothes, pushed the door open and walked in directly with a smile on his face.</p>

    <p>Those who dare to get involved in such a situation can no longer be described as courageous...it is simply an act of seeking death! You must know that these people in the private room are all masters. And The Sword Master is in charge! The pressure under the gaze of the four people. If they don't have full foundation, no one would dare to challenge easily.</p>

    <p>To be honest, those present here were already at war with each other. The atmosphere was extremely depressing. But now, facing this person who suddenly pushed the door open and entered.</p>

    <p>Almost in an instant. That strong spiritual pressure dropped suddenly!</p>

    <p>The spiritual pressure of three legendary masters and a retired sword master instantly solidified the atmosphere in the entire private room to the extreme!</p>

    <p>That was tens of millions of tons of huge spiritual pressure. All of it condensed directly onto the body of the intruder.</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe covered his eyes almost subconsciously. This was too cruel... Although he could not fully see the face of the person who pushed the door in. But who can withstand such spiritual pressure?</p>

    <p>"Fellow Taoists, I think we should calm down a little bit?" The young man in white robes and ancient clothes said with an easy-going look.</p>

    <p>Everyone in the field showed astonishment.</p>

    <p>It is really unbelievable. Under the combined pressure of the four of them, this person's voice can be conveyed so clearly and smoothly, as if he is not suffering from this spiritual pressure.</p>

    <p>Wait a minute!</p>

    <p>This voice seems a bit familiar?</p>

    <p>At this moment, the calm swordsman narrowed his eyes to a slit. When he saw the face of the visitor clearly, he immediately withdrew his spiritual pressure and said, "Who is this? It turns out to be the Office of The master of Strategic Deception is here..."</p>

    <p>As soon as these words came out, Luo Lan, Cang Long, Liu Yong, including Li Changzhe, were all shocked.</p>

    <p>They all came from far away. However, they had already heard about the reputation of the master of the Office of Strategic Deception. They did not expect that the master of the legendary super sect would show up at this moment.</p>

    <p>Why is this head of the Office of Strategic Deception here?</p>

    <p>This is a question shared by all the masters present now.</p>

    <p>But they understood one thing. That was why the head of the Office of Strategic Deception dared to break into the private room so recklessly.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, it is strong.</p>

    <p>This person's realm has already broken through to True Immortal. He is the first peerless master on earth to reach the realm of True Venerated Immortal. Not to mention the pressure exerted by the four of them together. Even if there are a dozen more True Immortals, the result will probably be the same.</p>

    <p>The gap between realms cannot be filled by quantity alone.</p>

    <p>Of course, there is another aspect. That is, before Lord Diulei became the head of the Office of Strategic Deception, he was an active cultivator in all directions... His reputation as a death-seeking senior was unknown to almost everyone present.</p>

    <p>"Yeah. I didn't expect Senior Yi to be here too. It was someone Lei who offended me." After entering the private room, Lord Diulei looked around. Then he walked up to Yi Jianchuan pretending not to know and bowed respectfully.</p>

    <p>After all, this retired general, Lord Diulei, still needs to be respected.</p>

    <p>Moreover, Huaxiu Alliance itself is the major shareholder of the Office of Strategic Deception. The top ten generals are all the rotating chairs of the Huaxiu Alliance. They are also equivalent to the board members of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Therefore, in terms of etiquette, Lord Diulei needs to be treated with extra caution.</p>

    <p>As expected, this action also eased the Sword Master's mood a lot. He stared at Lord Diulei and said slowly: "You are the Office of Strategic Deception. There are many masters. There are countless talented children. There is no need. Are you competing with us for disciples?"</p>

    <p>"What the Sword Master said makes sense." Liu Yong said quickly.</p>

    <p>"That's right. I agree too!" Canglong followed closely.</p>

    <p>Luo Lan, on the other hand, looked like he was half-defeated and sat slumped to the side. Just by looking at it, you could feel that the eyes of Master Luo Lan were dark...</p>

    <p>He sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>This is the now famous head of the Office of Strategic Deception!</p>

    <p>If even he had to go out and recruit disciples himself. Who could resist such temptation...</p>

    <p>But soon, Lord Diulei's next words directly dispelled Luo Lan's worries: "Don't worry, everyone. Lei Mou just happened to be passing by here. So he came here specifically to mediate conflicts. He did not want to accept this Li Classmates become disciples."</p>

    <p>"Oh? Mediate the conflict. What do you want to do? Let's talk about it, Xiao Lei." The sword master laughed and asked with the attitude of watching a show.</p>

    <p>"As the saying goes, a gentleman should not take what others like. Since Mr. Li is already a disciple of Master Luo Lan, and he himself has no intention of becoming a new master, why should you make things difficult for others? It's not sweet for you to force yourself."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei spoke softly, with the air of a humble gentleman. He said eloquently: "What Mr. Li has achieved today is the result of Master Luo Lan's hard work. Now you want Master Luo Lan to force Mr. Li to be a disciple." This move is really inappropriate."</p>

    <p>Then he looked at Cang Long: "I have heard about the reputation of fellow Taoist Cang Long. You are a famous trainer. You have strong muscles and bones. You specialize in extremely destructive tactics. Your strikes are as fast as lightning. Your body can withstand thunder. It is completely opposite to the gentle sect like Classmate Li. If fellow Taoist Canglong can trust me, I can recommend one person to be your true disciple."</p>

    <p>Canglong's eyes lit up instantly: "Zhenjun's reputation is as thunderous as thunder. Since it is Zhenjun who is the guarantor of the recommendation, of course I believe in Zhenjun!"</p>

    <p>Seeing that the negotiations started smoothly, Lord Diulei also nodded with satisfaction: "So, Fellow Daoist Canglong, are you willing to withdraw from the competition for Classmate Li?"</p>

    <p>"That's natural. But Zhenjun has to let me choose a disciple that I'm satisfied with. Otherwise, I'm afraid I'll have to choose Classmate Li."</p>

    <p>"Friend Canglong, please rest assured about this. This person's name is Chen Chao. He is a rare and good young man."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei smiled meaningfully.</p>

    <p>After dealing with Cang Long, he turned to look at Liu Yong aside: "I also know that fellow Taoist Liu Yong is the same as fellow Taoist Cang Long. They both came from far away from other places. So I can't let fellow Taoist Liu Yong travel in vain. I Here, you can also recommend someone to be a disciple of fellow Taoist Liu Yong."</p>

    <p>"I know that fellow Taoist Liu Yong is good at actuarial calculations. He is quite accomplished in the perception system. He is also a famous gourmet. But look at Classmate Li. He is not a foodie. If he really accepts Classmate Li as a disciple, I am afraid that this will happen. You won't be able to be happy after we've been together for a long time."</p>

    <p>"I am here to recommend fellow Taoist Liu Yong's disciple. His surname is Guo Minghao. He will definitely satisfy fellow Taoist Liu Yong."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao...Guo Hao...</p>

    <p>At this time, Li Changzhe and the sword master on his side carefully considered these two names.</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. They always feel that these two names are familiar. It seems as if they have heard them somewhere.</p>

    <p>At the same moment, Wang Ling, who was standing outside the door and eavesdropping on everything, nodded with satisfaction.</p>

    <p>Everything is within his layout...</p>
