  <h1>Chapter 2039 Sun Ru's Grandma</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Sun Ru was shocked inside. She didn't know how many years had passed while she was sleeping.</p>

    <p>But looking at Wang Ling who easily drove away the Sun family's mountain knights in front of him. After trying to calm down his emotions, Sun Ru immediately knelt down in front of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Sun. Sun Ru. Say hello to the head of the Sun family!" She knelt down on one knee and clasped her fists in front of Wang Ling. She was immediately stunned by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Although Sun Ru seems to be as old as himself, after all, she is still the Sun family in ancient times. There is a gap of N generations between the era of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>This scene was too embarrassing. Wang Ling had no choice but to release Immortal Toya from the core world to smooth things over.</p>

    <p>As soon as she saw Immortal Toya, Sun Ru started to look at that cute face again. She unconsciously put her hand on her sword. She looked at Immortal Toya warily.</p>

    <p>"Hello, Senior Sun Ru." Immortal Toya bowed respectfully. Then he stepped forward and helped Sun Ru up in a very gentlemanly manner: "Senior Sun Ru, please stand up and speak. Let me introduce myself. I am not from the Sun family, but I am. The descendant of Laojun. The master is Laojun."</p>

    <p>As he spoke, he took out the jade pendant that symbolized the friendship between Lao Jun and the ancestor of the Sun family.</p>

    <p>It was obvious that Sun Ru knew this thing. The expression on his face immediately relaxed a lot after seeing it.</p>

    <p>But at the same time, she was also deeply aware that the current era was probably very far away from the era where she slept... there was more than a little bit of timeline in between.</p>

    <p>"Yeah. I recognize the pendant."</p>

    <p>Sun Ru said. Her voice was quiet and cold. There was a sense of being unsmiling and not angry.</p>

    <p>"Then I would like to ask you, Senior Sun Fu. What is your relationship with Senior Sun Fu?" Immortal Toya asked. This is also a question raised by Wang Ling through the mouth of Immortal Toya.</p>

    <p>"Huh?"</p>

    <p>The expression on Sun Ru's face was even more surprised: "You actually know my grandma. They say that in my grandma's lineage, I am the one who has the most different personality from her."</p>

    <p>These words made Wang Ling, Immortal Toya suddenly realize.</p>

    <p>Who would have thought that the cute girl in front of him is actually the descendant of Sun Fu from the eternal years.</p>

    <p>So now comes the question. Sun Ru has to call Sun Fu grandma. So according to the seniority...Sun Rong, how should we call Sun Ru?</p>

    <p>The time span in between is too long.</p>

    <p>What happened in this ancient battlefield in ancient times.</p>

    <p>And for what reason Sun Ru buried herself in the battlefield and fell asleep. For Wang Ling now, these are all questions.</p>

    <p>"Why is Senior Sun Ru sleeping underground under this battlefield?" At this time, Immortal Toya asked.</p>

    <p>Sun Ru did not answer directly. She just looked at somewhere on the battlefield.</p>

    <p>With her awakening, new waves finally surged in this ancient battlefield filled with immortal caves.</p>

    <p>Violent earth tremors came from all directions. Powerful spiritual power spurted out everywhere. These spiritual powers were also mixed with the power of chaos.</p>

    <p>Obviously, there are ancient beings beyond the earth who have awakened at this moment.</p>

    <p>And it was obvious that he was influenced by Sun Ru.</p>

    <p>"Curse."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling frowned slightly. He realized everything almost instantly.</p>

    <p>Judging from the current situation, he can conclude that some kind of curse must have been set on Sun Ru, which will cause continuous attacks from some difficult ancient creatures.</p>

    <p>Only if she dies will the anger of these ancient beings be appeased.</p>

    <p>Perhaps it was because he had not found a way to truly destroy these ancient creatures back then that Sun Ru chose this method of sleeping to hide himself underground.</p>

    <p>Now that she is awake, the curse has also been sealed simultaneously. And those ancient creatures who disappeared from the ancient battlefield have also been inspired. They have revived with Sun Ru. Gu</p>

    <p>"Fortunately, it was you who woke up this Sun Ru."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying folded his arms and watched the show in the consciousness space of Wang Ling. He felt the increasingly expanding psychic energy around him. He smiled and said, "This is if Mr. Boss Sun digs out Sun Ru.</p>

    <p>Mr. Boss Sun can't deal with these difficult ancient spiritual beasts at all." He said this. But Wang Ling frowned deeply.</p>

    <p>Why can he wake up Sun Ru?</p>

    <p>Could it be that someone has already calculated all this?</p>

    <p>"Master, these ancient blood demons are difficult to deal with."</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Ru's voice came. She didn't say much and went straight to the point: "This is a mixed product of the ancient demon clan and the ancient lineage of the eternal era. It was transformed by a curse. It was born by cursing other living beings. As long as The cursed ones are immortal. They will launch a permanent hunt. Moreover, they are immortal. Physical attacks are ineffective. They are a group of spirits. It is difficult to deal with them."</p>

    <p>Sun Ru said.</p>

    <p>Most of them are consistent with the conclusions drawn by Wang Ling at first glance.</p>

    <p>So this is also the reason why Sun Ru had no choice but to sleep in sleep. Because if he didn't do that and were affected by the blood demon, more Sun family children would be implicated by the blood demon.</p>

    <p>Although the blood demon was only chasing Sun Ru, the ghostly impact during the attack was a large area of damage. Others would be affected one after another.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the blood demon's curse is contagious. Once attacked by the blood demon, as long as you don't die, you will also be included in the target of hunting.</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p>After all, he is a member of the Sun family with Sun Rong. Even the curse is passed down from ancestors...</p>

    <p>Not long after he helped Sun Rong solve the Yin-Yang Death Tribulation. Now he started to help Sun Rong's ancestors solve the curse problem.</p>

    <p>While thinking, Wang Ling walked closer.</p>

    <p>Upon seeing this, Sun Ru reminded the alliance solemnly: "Master, I know you are very powerful. But you must not underestimate your enemy. Blood demons are difficult to deal with... They are immortal!"</p>

    <p>"Chi!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised his hand and spread all five fingers of his right hand. Immediately, five rays of Immortal light rushed out. Five rays followed five rays. They were fired in succession like tracking bombs. Finally, they gathered into countless rays and shot in all directions.</p>

    <p>Puff!</p>

    <p>In the void, the blood demons that had just woken up and were rushing towards Sun Ru from all directions exploded one by one in mid-air.</p>

    <p>They were just a group of spirits. However, after being hit by Wang Ling's immortal light, they exploded one by one in the void. They turned into a ball of plasma on the spot. Then they turned into a ball of red clouds under the huge spiritual energy of the immortal light.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was so powerful. It was otherworldly. It was even greater than Sun Ru expected. She stared at the young head of the Sun family. Her mouth had been opened as big as an egg. She looked in a daze.</p>

    <p>The blood demon who claims to be immortal...</p>

    <p>How could he be destroyed so easily.</p>

    <p>Can the Sun family still have such a powerful head in charge?</p>

    <p>This blood demon was a thing that gave even the founder of the Sun family a headache!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't pay attention to the Blood Demon at all. The immortal light emitted from his fingertips was actually the light wave condensed by the Palm of Law. It was just ejected through the fingertips to achieve continuous firing.</p>

    <p>And it has absorbed the characteristics of the last time that 5% of the Law of Order Palm was too powerful. This time, every Dao Immortal light emitted by Wang Ling is actually only 1% of the power of the Law of Order Palm.</p>

    <p>A mere blood demon. Wang Ling didn't take it seriously at all.</p>

    <p>He has even beaten foreign gods.</p>

    <p>These are just demons fused with part of the old bloodline. In the eyes of Wang Ling, they are just a bunch of bastards.</p>
