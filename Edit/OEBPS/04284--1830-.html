  <h1>Chapter 1830 Creation Level Chaos Device</h1>

  <div>

    <p>To be honest, it was the first time even Wang Ling saw someone use a creation-level chaos device during a duel with him.</p>

    <p>A chaos device with a sequence level of five. It often means that this chaos device has the power to control important laws.</p>

    <p>The Era Pointer is an existence intertwined with the laws of time and bred from chaos. It just made its appearance. The earth-shattering feeling of intimidation has already hit us.</p>

    <p>Everything around seems to be covered with the robe of time. It is rapidly showing signs of collapse at a speed visible to the naked eye. It is a kind of aging power controlled by the era pointer.</p>

    <p>Therefore, at the moment when he felt the power of the Era Pointer, Wang Ling took action almost simultaneously. He stacked hundreds of millions of layers of immortal king shields on everyone.</p>

    <p>He could feel that the Immortal King's Shield was weakening under the power of the Era Pointer.</p>

    <p>Yes. This is not because the pointer itself has the power to break the immortal king's shield. It is because the pointer uses its own immortal time law to adjust the effective time of a spell. And once it expires, even the immortal king's shield will be as brittle as a paper shell.</p>

    <p>When the time comes, it won't take any effort at all to get rid of it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was secretly surprised.</p>

    <p>This creation-level chaos device was indeed as difficult as he imagined. In some ways, it was even more difficult than Fenmu Shen, who had inherited the power of the outer god Sotos.</p>

    <p>Under such a twist of time as the era hand, almost everything around them is in ruins. If it were not for the blessing of the immortal King's Shield. Number 60 High School, everyone in the Uzumaki Emperor would have become living fossils.</p>

    <p>Even the heavens and the world have been affected by this era pointer. The golden Heavenly City and the walls of the buildings of all races in the universe have begun to show a trend of collapse. Golden powder falls from the wall. Everything is there. Driven by the era pointer, it enters an old state.</p>

    <p>The overwhelming twilight air surged in, making Wang Ling also feel a sense of discomfort.</p>

    <p>"It worked! Fight! Laoliu! That's it! Don't give him any chance!"</p>

    <p>In the void. On the far side. The Saints who were watching the battle through another Cosmic Embryo applauded. They clearly noticed that Wang Ling was affected by the era pointer. Their actions and thinking seemed to be much slower than before.</p>

    <p>"Hehehe. Tell him to be arrogant again! The aging power of the era pointer is a range attack. The entire world of the heavens will be affected. He thinks he is the god of the world of the heavens. But if he encounters this creation-level chaos weapon, he is afraid that It's also when a scholar meets a soldier."</p>

    <p>The saints in the distance sneered: "And he not only has to take care of himself. He also has to take care of the ants below who only have the Foundation Building and Golden Core. The spiritual shields on their bodies have also failed under the power of aging. And he has to consume his own energy. His spiritual power keeps adding new spiritual shields. If this continues, no matter how strong he is, once all his spiritual energy is used up, it will be useless."</p>

    <p>They judged the situation and talked loudly. They agreed that Gui Laoliu had the upper hand.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling's resilience is far beyond their imagination.</p>

    <p>Under normal circumstances, a person who has been constantly baptized by the epoch pointer has already become a living fossil. But this boy from Earth looks like he hasn't been affected, his appearance is still that of a boy...</p>

    <p>Gui Laoliu thought it was a bit outrageous.</p>

    <p>This has been adjusted backwards for half an era. Wang Ling's face still has that milky look. It has not changed at all!</p>

    <p>How long is this person's lifespan???</p>

    <p>Yes.</p>

    <p>In less than a few minutes, half an era has passed since the era pointer appeared...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at his hands, which were still as white as jade. He felt that such aging did not have much reaction on his body itself.</p>

    <p>He originally wanted to experience what aging felt like. But he didn't expect that he would not age at all.</p>

    <p>Of course. Something else happened that Wang Ling didn't expect.</p>

    <p>That is, after the era pointer adjusted for half an era, the seal Talisman attached to him also fell into a state of complete failure due to the power of "aging"...</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>In the next breath, the aura on Wang Ling's body was completely released. Huge energy overflowed from his body, making the heavens and the world a blur. It seemed that even the heavens and the earth were disturbed and stopped functioning.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had something bad going on. He had neglected to calculate that he still had the Talisman seal on his body. He never expected that he would be in such a state... with his power completely liberated!</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>When the seal of Talisman completely failed and the power exploded, countless magic rings began to appear on Wang Ling's body. It was like a god descending. The aging power of the era pointer was ineffective against Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Several of the magic rings on his body contained a halo with magic immunity, which made the creation-level chaos device directly useless!</p>

    <p>Gui Laoliu's expression changed with shock. He had obviously adjusted to half an era later... He originally thought that the boy would show signs of aging and become weaker than before. But he never expected that Wang Ling's previous battle with him would actually turn out to be... he was still holding back. Not using all his strength!</p>

    <p>Until this moment, because the seal Talisman expired, all the power in his body finally burst out.</p>

    <p>"All liberated..."</p>

    <p>Below, many people were stunned. In addition to being stunned, Sun Rong's face also had other emotions added to it.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, this is not the earth. There is still room for change. If the blockade were to be directly unblocked on the earth, I am afraid that the entire earth would enter a state of collapse in an instant.</p>

    <p>Gui Laoliu thought that Wang Ling would become weaker due to aging. However, he never thought that Wang Ling, with all its power released, was like a demon. It was just the power of the physical body, which made him unable to resist.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling rushed over and moved forward fearlessly. Such pressure made Gui Laoliu's entire figure pinned to the spot, unable to move even half a step.</p>

    <p>In desperation, he had no choice but to mobilize the power of the law of the era pointer to try to resist the impact of Wang Ling. It gathered into a net to try to block Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling's dive had no intention of stopping. The law network of the era pointer could not block his attack route. The pointer chirped, which was directly deflected by Wang Ling's head hammer.</p>

    <p>Gui Laoliu couldn't believe what he saw before his eyes.</p>

    <p>Creation-level chaos device!</p>

    <p>The sequence level has reached the fifth level, the highest level. An existence with the power of law. How could it be knocked astray like this?</p>

    <p>At the same time, the Saints who were watching the battle from a distance also saw this scene. They almost cried. They thought that Gui Laoliu could win the game smoothly after using the epoch pointer. But they didn't expect this at all. The teenager on Earth never grow old at all...the older he gets, the stronger he gets! Even under the influence of the era pointer, his power is directly liberated!</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's head hammer finally hit Gui Laoliu's body. Like a cannonball from the sky. Accompanied by a burst of golden light, most of his body had been smashed into pieces by Wang Ling A mass of nothingness. Blood flowed freely.</p>

    <p>This kind of impact is too violent...</p>

    <p>After all, it is a state of complete liberation of power. Wang Ling is indeed not easy to control.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, after the era pointer was damaged by him, the previously adjusted time returned to normal. The sealed Talisman also returned from its expired state.</p>

    <p>This made Wang Ling secretly relieved.</p>

    <p>In fact, during the impact just now, Wang Ling was also thinking about strategies to restore the sealed Talisman.</p>

    <p>This is far more important than killing a ghost.</p>

    <p>What if there is really no way to recover.</p>

    <p>Gui Laoliu's operation of using the era pointer may directly lead to the destruction of the universe...</p>
