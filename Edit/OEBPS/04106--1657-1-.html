  <h1>Chapter 1657 Tell me something big!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Inside the Virtual Realm. In the core area of Science and Technology City. A magnificent castle is shrouded in night.</p>

    <p>The top of the top spire reflects a thin and long beam of light. It seems to be connected to the sky. The boundary with no dead ends spreads out around this beam of light, connecting to the outer wall of the core area.</p>

    <p>Below the castle is the splendid night market. Lively, prosperous, and never ending. It is completely different from the deathly silence that envelopes most areas in the slums.</p>

    <p>This castle is where the legendary "that lord" lives.</p>

    <p>The only main road leading to the castle was under complete martial law just a dozen hours ago. The main road was dozens of miles long.</p>

    <p>There are mechanized cultivators guarding the handles every ten meters. And the sky is also filled with countless miniature reconnaissance drones the size of fireflies.</p>

    <p>They move around the castle in a regular manner, fully monitoring all abnormal movements around the castle.</p>

    <p>In an astrology club called "Xingkong." Li Xian and Zhang Zhui successfully sneaked in.</p>

    <p>Yes.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui used his old skills again and stole the passes of two dignitaries in the core area, allowing them to come here directly without any hindrance.</p>

    <p>Li Xian, as the leader of the Vanguard team, naturally objected to the theft. But after Zhang Zhui's hand was dealt to him several times, he was forced to accept the arrangement.</p>

    <p>Even if he doesn't accept it, Zhang Zhui will find other ways to get what he wants...</p>

    <p>For example, the large deposit of 10 million gold gear coins they currently have was obtained by Zhang Zhui.</p>

    <p>His goal was clear. As soon as he sneaked into the core area, he immediately stole the "signal base station" installed near the core area. Then he started sending fraudulent text messages in groups.</p>

    <p>The specific text message content is also very simple.</p>

    <p>He said that he is a closed disciple of "that Lord." He entered into a bet agreement with "that Lord" because of a certain research. He is now raising research funds. He is confident that he can prove that his theory is completely correct. If the bet succeeds You will receive a bonus of 100 times the research funds. When the bonus is received, you will give back to all research sponsors in high amounts...</p>

    <p>He didn't know if it's because people are stupid and have too much money.</p>

    <p>Li Xian didn't expect that anyone would actually keep transferring money to Zhang Zhui's new e-wallet...</p>

    <p>In less than a few hours, they raised a total of 10 million gold gear coins and came to the "Astrology Club" in front of them, which used "divination" as a gimmick.</p>

    <p>The membership fee for this club is 100,000 gold gear coins per person per year. It is a fun among the rich and powerful.</p>

    <p>After joining the membership, in addition to free fortune divination once a day and question divination once a week, there are also starry sky blessing gatherings every month to help absorb the luck of the universe through divine power. Leave Africa and join the European Union.</p>

    <p>However, after evaluation, Li Xian and Zhang Zhui both felt that they might be able to get the clues they wanted in this place.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>No. Just after paying their dues and entering, Li Xian and Zhang Zhui heard the discussion at the next table.</p>

    <p>"Have you heard? Hei Long escaped. He betrayed the commander. An official mobilization order has just been issued. There is a reward of 1 million gold gear coins."</p>

    <p>"No wonder martial law has been imposed..."</p>

    <p>"It's not necessarily because of Hei Long that martial law was imposed. It is said that just a few hours ago, someone saw a mechanical guard carrying a coffin into the castle."</p>

    <p>"I just heard it...I haven't confirmed it yet. I still think it has something to do with Hei Long's escape."</p>

    <p>"So. Who is the current commander of Hei Long?"</p>

    <p>"That Zhu Yuanrun who runs an underground boxing ring in the slums."</p>

    <p>"It turns out it was him..."</p>

    <p>"I think it's better not to join in the fun. Then Hei Long is extremely powerful. Even if we do meet him, there's a question of whether he will be able to report the news alive."</p>

    <p>"That's the truth."</p>

    <p>"It is said that Hei Long is the master's masterpiece. The first fully mechanized guard-type cultivator. This out-of-control incident almost caused the death of the contracted commander in his hands.</p>

    <p>That gentleman is probably going to go crazy." Three dignitaries held hands with a yellow-haired lady dressed as a witch and gathered around a table to discuss. There was a crystal ball on the table.</p>

    <p>Before performing astrology divination, you need to completely relax your body and mind.</p>

    <p>Therefore, talk about gossip and gossip before divination. The effect is often the best.</p>

    <p>As we all know, the most stress-relieving way is actually for a group of people to get together and say bad things about outsiders...</p>

    <p>Anyone who has experienced school dormitories must have a deep understanding of this.</p>

    <p>The most outrageous example is that there are four people in a dormitory. Everyone will create three groups in private to get two roommates who they think are just okay. Then they will complain about the fourth annoying person. It is so real that it is scary.</p>

    <p>Originally, several people were chatting about Hei Long.</p>

    <p>As a result, while we were chatting, the topic suddenly turned to "that adult." The witch in charge of divination immediately spoke to control the situation.</p>

    <p>This is not something they can discuss.</p>

    <p>That adult knows everything like a god. He monitors everything. He can hear everything.</p>

    <p>This witch also knew this very well.</p>

    <p>She had also heard a rumor that it was the beam of light reflected from the spire above the castle, also known as the "Thinker." Its role was not just a barrier... but it could also serve as a surveillance function.</p>

    <p>Although this was just a rumor, in order to avoid trouble, she still smiled and advised in a soft voice: "Gentlemen, please do not discuss state affairs to avoid getting into trouble."</p>

    <p>The three dignitaries nodded: "Mrs. Melissa is right. We were out of line."</p>

    <p>"No harm done. So here we go. The astrological horoscope has officially begun..."</p>

    <p>The person named Melissa spoke quietly. Then began the following command process: "Please follow my instructions. First slowly close your eyes. Completely empty your mind and thoughts. Imagine what the starry sky looks like in your mind. and then, in your mind, ask the questions you want to ask."</p>

    <p>She muttered something in her mouth.</p>

    <p>The crystal ball on the table began to flicker with faint starlight after being silent for a few seconds.</p>

    <p>Huh? Actually...not a liar?</p>

    <p>Li Xian observed for a long time. He thought that this kind of club was some kind of place for cheating wealthy people to pay for their money. But he didn't expect that the "witch" in front of him actually knew something.</p>

    <p>However, I definitely don't understand it as well as he does.</p>

    <p>Throughout the ages, he was a famous star wanderer.</p>

    <p>Manipulate the stars. Control the stars. Initiate star tribulations... All starry sky spells are omnipotent.</p>

    <p>Of course, this "astrology" is also included.</p>

    <p>About three full minutes passed.</p>

    <p>The woman named Melissa gently let go of her hand: "Star Lord. I know your appeal and has given you the answer."</p>

    <p>Then, a girl in a maid outfit took out a quill pen from the side.</p>

    <p>Melissa quickly wrote down the questions asked by the three people and the answers to the questions on three pieces of paper and handed them to the three people.</p>

    <p>At this time, Li Xian saw Zhang Zhui walking forward and looking like a thief. He immediately knew that this guy had itchy hands again.</p>

    <p>"Brother Zi Xiang. What are you doing..."</p>

    <p>"Nothing to do. Just take a look." Zhang Zhui said through the message.</p>

    <p>To be honest, if Li Xian hadn't held him back, he might have really taken action on those three pieces of paper.</p>

    <p>But now, it's okay if you don't take it.</p>

    <p>Because his eyes were vicious. He had already seen what was written on the paper.</p>

    <p>He sent a message to Li Xian and said: "These three people, the first person asked is why everyone calls that lord, that lord, instead of calling him by his real name directly."</p>

    <p>Li Xian: "Why?"</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui: "Because. That person's surname is Na. And the name is based on a sense of taste. After he got used to it. He's become that person."</p>

    <p>Li Xian: "..."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui: "The second question is: If one day the Science and Technology City is destroyed, what will be the reason?"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Li Xian couldn't help grinning: "This question is quite interesting."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui: "The woman named Melissa answered. If the world were to be destroyed, the most likely cause would be that someone fell down, causing a big explosion."</p>

    <p>Had a fall?</p>

    <p>Li Xian was stunned...</p>

    <p>Would a fall lead to the destruction of the world?</p>

    <p>Even if a cultivator of Soul Formation occasionally falls on the ground, it will only leave a hole.</p>

    <p>To the point of destroying the world. It would only happen unless Wang Ling fell down...</p>

    <p>"Last question."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui continued: "The third person asked about the daily life of the Immortal King. Will there be a second season?"</p>

    <p>Li Xian smiled meaningfully: "So... is there?"</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui nodded: "Yes, and today, at this moment, when everyone sees this chapter, Station B has already announced it."</p>
