  <h1>Chapter 1963 Qu Shuling is crazy</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Looking at Qu Shuling's face, which seemed to have been ruined, Wang Ling felt like a mirror.</p>

    <p>There is a high probability that this person will follow in the footsteps of Yi Zhiyang... Think of Yi Zhiyang back then. It seems that he has not fully recovered from the trauma after the war. Wang Ling Unexpectedly, it has only been less than a few months. time. The result was another crazy one.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed inwardly. To be honest, sometimes he felt that he was quite evil. In fact, he didn't want Qu Shuling to become like this.</p>

    <p>But now that it has happened.</p>

    <p>So at this moment, Wang Ling has no other choice. We can only continue to take one step at a time.</p>

    <p>The setting sun is like blood. Large groups of fire clouds are pressing down, connecting with the distant horizon. It is like pieces of a puzzle that are about to fall down to form a picture of fire clouds in the deep sky.</p>

    <p>This scene reminded Wang Ling of the demon world.</p>

    <p>It can be seen from this that the world structure in the trial ground is not completely extracted from the scenes on the earth. Such an oppressive sky is exclusive to the demon world.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has been to the Demon Realm. Therefore, he was deeply impressed by the scenes in the Demon Realm.</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling stood on a cleared ruin, dressed in rags. The mottled cracks on the sword of his Zhanye were clearly visible under the setting sun.</p>

    <p>He had a dark face. He looked like he was possessed. He stared at Li Changzhe tightly and kept repeating: "Hide your identity... Show it... You can hide it too... Hurry. Show it." Fight with me..."</p>

    <p>Although he used the privilege card in his hand to force himself to stay, Qu Shuling was now injured by the "Jinghong Arrow" operated in secret by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>If you continue to fight stubbornly, there may really be sequelae.</p>

    <p>Jiutian Jingmi Academy Command Center. Looking at the picture on the monitor, Jing Heqiu also showed a very worried expression: "Teng Lao, should we intervene? Qu Shuling is injured now. If he really stays during the trial, The after-effects are just not worthwhile. After all, there is a more important geocentric plan later. He needs to lead the team."</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen frowned. Then he waved his hand: "No...wait and see...Since he is the number one genius among high school students, under adversity, he might be able to develop stronger potential."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Jing Heqiu roughly understood what Teng Luchen meant.</p>

    <p>This is a two-way pressure.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, it forces Qu Shuling to continue to develop his body's potential in adversity.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Teng Luchen was also curious whether Li Changzhe was also a hidden talent.</p>

    <p>The fight just now forced out Zhang Linyan, a well-hidden disciple of the Arrow God!</p>

    <p>If we wait another round, maybe Li Changzhe will show his flaws!</p>

    <p>At this time, in the center of the battlefield, Qu Shuling, who was carrying Zhan Ye, was almost going crazy.</p>

    <p>"Come. Fight with me...use your strongest ability! Today, none of you can escape!"</p>

    <p>Then he became excited. Carrying his wounded body in ragged clothes, he rushed forward like a berserker and started a confrontation with Li Changzhe.</p>

    <p>The sound of clashing weapons kept coming from the scene. Although Zhan Ye was broken, its strength was still astonishing. Li Changzhe held the natal spiritual sword Sui Yun and fought for dozens of rounds with Qu Shuling, who was holding Zhan Ye. The tiger's mouth is here. He was shaken to the point of numbness under the strong attack.</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe secretly scoffed.</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling was really fierce. Even in this situation, he was not at a disadvantage when fighting against him.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Zhang Linyan was hiding in the distance. She wanted to shoot an arrow, but when she raised the bow and arrow, she froze again. She did not dare to interfere at all. She was afraid that she would accidentally shoot a "shock-breaking arrow" again. </p>

    <p>If the Arrow God's arrow was shot again in a strange way, she would definitely send Qu Shuling away directly, right?</p>

    <p>Although she didn't like Qu Shuling, she wasn't to the point of killing him.</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan was filled with emotion in her heart. People outside may have seen what happened with the giant arrow. Her identity as a disciple of the God of Arrow may have been confirmed.</p>

    <p>And even if she explains, no one will listen.</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan never expected that when she came to participate in the trial this time, she would inadvertently have an extra character...</p>

    <p>Thinking about it now, she suddenly felt that she was quite envious of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Mascot character design. How nice! Many people are harmless!</p>

    <p>At this time, she stared at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, Wang Ling was sitting in front of a stone. He was enjoying the fierce battle between Li Changzhe and Qu Shuling with a calm expression. There was no trace of panic on his face.</p>

    <p>"Does Li Changzhe really have a hidden identity?" Even Zhang Linyan was puzzled at this moment. She must have picked up her identity as a disciple of the Arrow God. But there was no guarantee that Li Changzhe might really have a hidden identity.</p>

    <p>And I don't know why. After entering the Number 2 Spirit World Trial Field this time, Zhang Linyan could clearly feel that the relationship between Li Changzhe and Wang Ling was much closer.</p>

    <p>The secret between boys. Naturally, only boys know about it. In other words, Wang Ling is probably because he knows that Li Changzhe also has a hidden identity, so he maintains such a calm attitude and watches the battle.</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, Zhang Linyan couldn't help but feel enlightened. It was as if she had figured out everything at once.</p>

    <p>"Brother Qu, calm down. If you keep fighting like this, it will be bad for you and me." Li Changzhe accepted the move while trying to persuade him.</p>

    <p>In his opinion, there is no need to continue fighting in the current game. The most important thing is the final sect competition.</p>

    <p>After all, the final calculation is the total points of the elite high school students sent by each cultivating country. Their fighting here is tantamount to increasing internal consumption.</p>

    <p>If the battle really reaches the point where spiritual power is exhausted, no one can win the sect competition on the last day.</p>

    <p>But how could Qu Shuling, who was now furious, care about this? There was a fierce look on his face. The more Li Changzhe persuaded him, the more violent his attack became.</p>

    <p>"Shut up! Shut up!" Qu Shuling said fiercely: "Are you looking down on me? Why don't you show your hidden identity to fight me!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe was really confused.</p>

    <p>Does he have any hidden persona?</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling's speech made him feel extremely aggrieved.</p>

    <p>He is just a mediocre, bratty younger brother who is a member of Jingmen Number 8 High School, the second highest university in Huaxiu. If the only special skill he has is his unique secret skill "The Art of Mist Removal."</p>

    <p>He had also used this trick before when he sneaked into the Suzaku Gate. This is a spell that can decompose the body into water mist. But he has only practiced it to the third level so far.</p>

    <p>And the senior figure in the world of cultivation "Luo Lan" who invented this trick is also Li Changzhe's idol!</p>

    <p>The only master in the world who has cultivated the fog spirit root into bloom. He is also a talent who specializes in unpopular magic and fog magic!</p>

    <p>The only tenth-grade Mist practitioner in the world...</p>

    <p>His cultivation level is too low. How could he be able to become a master to such a great master?</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe felt infinite emotion in his heart.</p>

    <p>But he never expected that all these words would be heard by Wang Ling...</p>
