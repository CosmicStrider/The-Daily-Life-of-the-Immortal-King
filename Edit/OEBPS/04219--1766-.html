  <h1>Chapter 1766 The legendary Aqian!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Of course, Wang Muyu decided to do that, not just after breaking out of his shell. Although he admitted that Wang Ling is his father, he had no idea about the power of his "daddy" when he first broke out of his shell.</p>

    <p>Until he saw the scene of Wang Ling beating Jingze. He immediately made up his mind to hug Wang Ling tightly.</p>

    <p>In the past, for the Dragon Clan, glory and self-esteem were inseparable existences. As an excellent Dragon Clan warrior, it was impossible to surrender to others.</p>

    <p>But Wang Muyu's thoughts are naturally different. I don't know if it is because he has gathered too many dragon genes, which has caused his brain circuit to be a bit strange from the beginning.</p>

    <p>There is no such thing as glory and self-esteem.</p>

    <p>Glory is precious. Self-esteem is even more valuable.</p>

    <p>Just hold your legs tight. Both can be thrown.</p>

    <p>This is a little poem that Wang Muyu composed while learning the cultural knowledge of the human world when he was getting along with Boss Sun these past few days. As a dragon, he knew that he probably shouldn't get so close to human cultivators.</p>

    <p>But now he is not completely a dragon. Instead, he is a little dragon with dragon genes. He also has some human attributes.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu found that he really loved life in the world of human cultivation. Especially when he was with Wang Ling or Sun Rong. He would not feel lonely at all.</p>

    <p>The video game city in the square. Wang Ling and Wang Muyu had planned to go here from the beginning.</p>

    <p>"Brother, let's go play this! This is fun! Lots of points! We can eat crispy noodles instead!"</p>

    <p>"Brother, that boxing device looks very good. Is the knot strong? If I try to hit it, will it break if I use half the strength?"</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu excitedly grabbed Wang Ling's hand and walked, talked and jumped around. He looked exactly like a child.</p>

    <p>There are many projects in the video game city. Previously, in order to earn points, Wang Ling's special skill is the gold bulldozer.</p>

    <p>Of course. In order to deceive players of their game coins, the video game town actually has a lot of luck-based video games such as gold bulldozers.</p>

    <p>But this time, he didn't know if he was infected by Wang Muyu's excitement. Wang Ling took Wang Muyu to a brand new game console.</p>

    <p>The name of this game console is "Dongfeng Express." The general rule is that each round you can use one game currency to exchange for a chance to launch a cannonball. The cannonballs fall from the sky. The turntable part at the bottom of the game console is set There are many potholes and obstacles marked with points.</p>

    <p>When the turntable rotates, it proves that the game has started.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling pressed the button to launch the cannonball. In the end, how many points you win will be determined according to the location of the hole where the ball falls.</p>

    <p>The jackpot is 1,000 points. If you can hit holes with more than 600 points in a row, there will be an additional bonus reward. The jackpot can be multiplied up to 100 times. But this difficulty factor is extremely high. Since the game hall opened, no one  has ever succeeded.</p>

    <p>But the size of the hole is equivalent to the diameter of the ball. You have to aim at the hole very accurately to shoot directly into the hole. If there is a slight deviation, the elastic ball will pop out directly.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling bought Wang Muyu an ice cream and let him watch his performance while eating the ice cream. Wang Muyu was not optimistic about this kind of game involving luck.</p>

    <p>Before the official operation, Wang Ling took out the raccoon mask and put it on his face. He knew that the next performance would be too eye-catching, so the necessary disguise was also required.</p>

    <p>The mask has been enlightened by him. It is impossible for anyone to see his true appearance through the mask through pupil power.</p>

    <p>"Dad, come on!" Wang Muyu looked like he was watching a show. He sat obediently next to Wang Ling, eating ice cream and cheering through the voice.</p>

    <p>Who would have known that Wang Ling is not only invincible in hitting people, but also invincible in playing video games. His bombardment is extremely accurate. Each shot is worth a thousand points. It took less than ten minutes to earn ten million points. Directly emptied the game points lottery tickets used to accumulate points in the machine.</p>

    <p>Halfway through, the staff came to open the box and renew the tickets twice. In the end, I simply wiped my sweat and stood next to Wang Ling to watch his performance.</p>

    <p>Almost another fifteen minutes passed. The guy from the arcade wiped his sweat. He looked at Wang Ling and said, "Brother... how about I clear your points and write you one ticket? Otherwise, you will be tired and so will I."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>In less than half an hour, Wang Ling had already obtained almost 100 million points with the game coins in his hand. The game lottery tickets at his feet were piled up into hills. It attracted the attention of many people at the scene.</p>

    <p>Even Wang Muyu was dumbfounded. His eyes were straight. All his attention was on Wang Ling. He admired Wang Ling more and more. He didn't even notice that the ice cream on his hand melted. The sound fell to the ground.</p>

    <p>"This man is so powerful..."</p>

    <p>"Go and check. What's the origin?"</p>

    <p>"My prize!"</p>

    <p>Finally, the huge noise here at Wang Ling disturbed the manager of the arcade. When the manager came over, his heart was bleeding...</p>

    <p>So many points. It can almost clear out all the points and prizes in his arcade!</p>

    <p>The most important thing is that the manager also learned that Wang Ling actually did not exchange money for game currency at all. It was a game hall membership card directly.</p>

    <p>Speaking of which, Wang Ling got the membership card of this game arcade when he visited Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>When redeeming points. When the membership card of Wang Ling is inserted into the pointer, the member ID is also displayed immediately.</p>

    <p>The huge word "Aqian" was like a golden legend that suddenly appeared. It blinded everyone's eyes.</p>

    <p>"Aqian?"</p>

    <p>"Oh my god. He is Aqian! The number one maniac who ripped out the arcades!"</p>

    <p>"Oh my god...it turns out this person is Aqian. He's too strong!"</p>

    <p>This name was left by Wang Ling when he visited Sun Rong more than a month ago. In fact, even Wang Ling himself did not expect that the ID he left behind would not only become a legend. It has such a big influence.</p>

    <p>What was unexpected by Wang Ling was that the arcade manager, who seemed to feel his heart bleed before seeing the ID, showed an expression of surprise after seeing the ID.</p>

    <p>"Sir, what prize do you want to exchange for?"</p>

    <p>He greeted him with a smile on his face. The employees around him were also confused.</p>

    <p>"What's wrong with him, manager? It feels like his attitude has suddenly changed..."</p>

    <p>"What do you know...this Aqian is not only a legend, but also seems to be related to the big boss behind us. He is a Crown Diamond member. He can redeem not only things in the store, but also things that are not available in the store."</p>

    <p>"Ah? Crown Diamond membership? There is also this thing. Why haven't I heard of it..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>In fact. Even Wang Ling himself doesn't know that he actually has this identity.</p>

    <p>But since this card was given by Sun Rong, most likely it was also arranged by Sun Rong...</p>

    <p>Under the raccoon mask, Wang Ling shed a drop of sweat. Then he opened the redemption page of the points redemption machine. As expected, there were many things on the redemption page that were not found in the arcade...</p>

    <p>"I'm done! I never knew you could get a house by playing video games!"</p>

    <p>When the onlookers discovered the penthouse garden house in the city center worth 100 million points on the points redemption page, everyone exclaimed.</p>

    <p>And there is a special note below this prize.</p>

    <p>It says: A garden house in the city center worth 100 million points. If you bring a marriage partner named Sun who was born in 4380 to move in with you, you can enjoy more benefits...</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling found out. He was clearly arranged by Boss Sun.</p>
