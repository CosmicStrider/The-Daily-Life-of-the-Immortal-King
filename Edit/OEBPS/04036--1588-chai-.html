  <h1>Chapter 1588 Bravely Entering</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When Wang Ling entered the Palace of the Outer Gods, he was a little surprised by the powerful aura of creatures from the ancient universe inside.</p>

    <p>It turned out to be much stronger than he imagined.</p>

    <p>This Palace of the Outer Gods is actually a set. The chaos energy inside is rich. It is millions of times stronger than the ring outside the Unspeakable Land.</p>

    <p>Even a monk's realm is not enough to set foot here.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was a little uncomfortable when he first entered. But after standing there for a few seconds, his body quickly became familiar with the surrounding environment.</p>

    <p>He originally wanted to protect Ah Nuan. It turned out that Ah Nuan was more adaptable than he imagined.</p>

    <p>What an outrageous little guy.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling was in a main hall on the outermost floor of the palace. This room was huge. It was actually the size of a small world.</p>

    <p>He actually used the small world to divide the rooms in the palace. Wang Ling couldn't help but marvel at the generosity of those outer gods.</p>

    <p>This is not something from Fenmu Shen. It is something Fenmu Shen inherited from the cause after using the power of "mysterious objects" to activate the "outer god blood" in his body.</p>

    <p>In essence, this terrifying palace of the outer gods should be like those ghost ships drifting in the deep sea. It will drift with the waves over the years and stay in the universe forever.</p>

    <p>No one would have thought that the Palace of the Outer Gods would one day be reborn.</p>

    <p>Use King's Eyes to explore the front. Wang Ling found three entrances from this vast room that looks like a small world at your feet.</p>

    <p>This leads to the three rooms behind. King's Eyes' view is blocked by a golden light. It is impossible to see clearly what is behind the room.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that this light was closely related to the three-petal Golden Lotus he saw outside at that moment.</p>

    <p>Regardless of Wang Ling. Although he couldn't see what was behind these three rooms, there was nothing to be afraid of.</p>

    <p>But the biggest problem before us is...</p>

    <p>He has difficulty choosing.</p>

    <p>Facing the three entrances that appeared in his sight, Wang Ling became a little confused.</p>

    <p>At that moment. Ah Nuan "ee-ya." Pointing to one of the entrances.</p>

    <p>The third exit?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is too lazy to think about it. I believe in Ah Nuan's decision unconditionally.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling made the decision, a bright light suddenly lit up from the small world in front of his eyes. It turned into a golden avenue directly derived from Wang Ling's step, leading to the third entrance.</p>

    <p>This is a forbidden door in the palace of the outer gods. It is to prevent people who enter here from making decisions and then changing their minds.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at the golden avenue under his feet. He sighed helplessly in his heart.</p>

    <p>Somehow, he felt that this palace of the Outer Gods felt a bit like a game.</p>

    <p>This golden avenue is very long. It stretches for thousands of miles. After all, a room in the Palace of the Outer Gods is a small world.</p>

    <p>If an ordinary person came here, he would probably consume countless spiritual energy on the way.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling has no fear.</p>

    <p>He directly used the method of shrinking to an inch and easily approached the entrance to the next room.</p>

    <p>Stepping into the entrance covered by golden light, Wang Ling entered the next space.</p>

    <p>Then the brother and sister began to carefully examine the scenery in front of them. They did not miss any vision.</p>

    <p>The second room. The second small world.</p>

    <p>"ah..."</p>

    <p>The shrill screams reached Wang Ling, Wang Nuan's ears. Just a few hundred miles ahead. Wang Ling saw a dead forest.</p>

    <p>His body moved. It was like a ray of light.</p>

    <p>A shocking scene appeared in front of me.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling could not yet cover Wang Nuan's eyes and ears. But on the branches of the withered trees in this forest. There were hanging corpses on the branches of the withered trees.</p>

    <p>To be precise, it should be a mummy.</p>

    <p>These skins are not peeled off. It is as if some evil thing has sucked away the marrow and internal organs in their bodies. In the end, it is as if they are showing off their trophies, hanging in a dead forest with such a bad taste.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling simply counted the number of mummies.</p>

    <p>Within sight alone, there are more than 1,200 of them.</p>

    <p>Is he the monk who accidentally entered the palace of the outer gods in the past?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has some guesses in his mind.</p>

    <p>If this palace of the outer gods is floating in the universe, it is very likely that some monks will treat it as a secret place discovered by accident and explore it.</p>

    <p>This place is so weird.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is worried that watching it for a long time will be detrimental to Ah Nuan girl's physical and mental health.</p>

    <p>However, just as he was about to leave the dead forest, the hanging corpses changed their angles one after another. They were all staring in the direction of him and Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>"Identification... identification..."</p>

    <p>A cold sneer sounded in the dead forest. It was an ancient saying that Wang Ling had never heard before. It was filled with great malice.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling has a very strong language understanding ability. I just analyzed it in my mind. It was quickly automatically translated into Mandarin.</p>

    <p>And along with this chilling sneer, the mummies hanging on the trees in the dead forest also sneered.</p>

    <p>It was a kind of mental continuous oppressive attack. The cultivators who normally entered here would have collapsed long ago under such a concentrated attack.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling had his hands in his pockets and remained motionless.</p>

    <p>This surprised the owner who was the first to sneer in the dead forest: "Huh? You actually withstood the pressure and didn't fall down?"</p>

    <p>The voice was very old and profound: "I have never seen a monk like you... But you withstood the first round of mental evaluation. You can leave here safe and sound..."</p>

    <p>Mental assessment?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised his eyebrows. He didn't hear what the old voice was saying.</p>

    <p>But it was indeed what the voice said. After the concentrated mental attack just now, the mummies in this dry forest miraculously disappeared like an hallucination.</p>

    <p>Those sneers and all the strange sights seen in the dead woods disappeared.</p>

    <p>"Strength, consciousness, knowledge, speed, energy and blood...these values have been fixed when everyone enters the palace of the outer gods." In the dead forest, the old voice sighed helplessly.</p>

    <p>With a solemn smile, he explained the laws of this palace to Wang Ling: "This is the purpose of the Outer God to build this palace. It is also a game for the entire universe. It is a pity that since ancient times, those who have broken into this palace have Monk. Few make it to the end..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling frowned slightly.</p>

    <p>He listened to the numbers. It sure felt like a game.</p>

    <p>And strength, consciousness, knowledge, speed, blood. These five basic abilities. What is he?</p>

    <p>This. Wang Ling is not known yet.</p>

    <p>The old voice continued: "How about. Do you want to continue a bet with me? If you pass my sanity test, you will know the value of your sanity. And... I will die! If you fail... I'm sorry. You and your sister will stay here forever. You die!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't think much. He just spread his hands and maintained a completely indifferent attitude.</p>

    <p>The voice couldn't help but laugh: "You could have left safely, but you didn't expect that you would choose to bet with me? Haha... We'll see..."</p>

    <p>The words just fell.</p>

    <p>In the void, several golden rays of light appeared. Wang Ling saw ten sixty-four-sided golden dice appear.</p>

    <p>They roll in the void, rotate and finally freeze.</p>

    <p>The moment the values came out, the owner of the dead forest burst into laughter: "Unfortunately... your values add up to 523! One value represents one core! This means that you must have a mind with a combat power of 523 or more. Only by passing through the old and dead woods!"</p>

    <p>Laughter is inevitable.</p>

    <p>Because everyone who enters the Palace of the Outer Gods will have their comprehensive combat power converted according to their personal abilities and evenly distributed to the five basic abilities of "strength, consciousness, knowledge, speed, and blood."</p>

    <p>Those monks who came in in previous years may not have 523 cores in total. Let alone this single data...</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry, young man. You and your sister, I accepted it rudely..." The owner of the dry forest laughed loudly.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling frowned.</p>

    <p>Just as they were preparing to fight, the owner of the dead forest suddenly let out a painful and shrill scream...</p>

    <p>"No...that's impossible..."</p>

    <p>The owner of the dead forest screamed.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Within sight, all the dead trees in this dead forest were instantly ignited with a golden fire. They began to burn...</p>

    <p>"Your consciousness has more than 523 cores?" Amidst the screams, the owner of the dead forest burst into doubt.</p>

    <p>He actually doesn't know what the value of Wang Ling is. But speaking from experience, it is basically impossible for anyone to have such a high single value.</p>

    <p>And when the questioning ended, Wang Ling's mental data also appeared in the sky along with the golden light flashing in the void.</p>

    <p>That's not a specific number.</p>

    <p>It's a mathematical symbol.</p>

    <p>﹢∞...</p>
