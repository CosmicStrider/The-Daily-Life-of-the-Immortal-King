  <h1>Chapter 1677 Office of Strategic Deception Team Building Activities</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In the Virtual Realm. All the people in the Office of Strategic Deception were transferred away due to the brain. But three people were left behind.</p>

    <p>The first person is Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>Because he is now borrowing Jia Bugui's body, so it has not been recognized by the brain.</p>

    <p>The remaining two are Li Xian and Zhang Zhui.</p>

    <p>Just now. Nawei's attack was too fast. Almost a second before the brain waves were emitted to draw everyone in the Office of Strategic Deception into the supreme world. Wang Ming had already guessed what the other party was going to do.</p>

    <p>Nawei After all, the divine brain has been activated. And Wang Ming's current state is just a shunt of the main body's brain waves. Therefore, it may be impossible to achieve counter-waves on the brain waves.</p>

    <p>So at this critical moment, Wang Ming quickly detected the brain waves and chose Li Xian and Zhang Zhui. Using his own insignificant power compared to Nawei, he used brain waves to form a masking ability. As a result, the two The person cannot be recognized by Nawei in a short period of time.</p>

    <p>This "mask layer" was more troublesome than imagined. Wang Ming only took less than thirty seconds to perform it. Although he successfully deceived Nawei, his own mind was also very hot, emitting hot smoke.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, he was prepared.</p>

    <p>Just before Monk Jin Deng and others were sucked into the supreme world, Wang Ming had asked Monk Jin Deng to leave a few Talisman sheets for cooling. They could barely survive this period.</p>

    <p>"As expected of Ling Zhenren's brother."</p>

    <p>Soon, Li Xian and Zhang Zhui appeared, standing in front of Wang Ming almost instantly.</p>

    <p>They are the first batch to enter the Virtual Realm. They are also the ones who currently know the most information.</p>

    <p>The Supreme World is currently in a tense situation. Nawei thinks that it has involved all outsiders in the Supreme World, making the entire Virtual Realm fall into a situation without main force guarding. This is what Wang Ming sees. It's an excellent opportunity.</p>

    <p>"I've met the two seniors." Wang Ming bowed. His body was a little weak. He didn't seem to be in good condition.</p>

    <p>Just as he was about to fall over, Li Xian stepped forward to help him. After sensing Wang Ming's condition, he was also extremely surprised by Wang Ming's condition: "You are just an ordinary person. You can actually do this..."</p>

    <p>He couldn't imagine that an ordinary person who was not even a cultivator could push his brain to such limits.</p>

    <p>And it still only uses a shunted brain wave to form a mask. It fights against 70% of Nawei's divine brain...</p>

    <p>This situation surprised both Li Xian and Zhang Zhui.</p>

    <p>He didn't know whether to say that the brain has shrunk or that Wang Ming is simply too strong.</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry, senior. It doesn't matter to me. This brainwave won't last long after all. But I'm lucky to be able to keep the two seniors here." At this time, Wang Ming said.</p>

    <p>He left Li Xian and Zhang Zhui behind at the critical moment. In fact, he had carefully considered it.</p>

    <p>And at the moment when the mask layer was formed, Wang Ming also used his own power to simultaneously collect the intelligence collected by the two people so far.</p>

    <p>Of course, this kind of simultaneous collection is only possible if Li Xian and Zhang Zhui know who Wang Ming is and do not initiate resistance. Otherwise, it would never be so smooth.</p>

    <p>"The most dangerous people in this imperial city now are those who are sheltering the creatures. I leave two seniors behind. The main thing is that I want the seniors to deal with these guys."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said: "Both of our predecessors came from the Corpse Map. The current body is reshaped by the illusion of King's Eyes. It looks like flesh and blood, but in fact it is just a real illusion."</p>

    <p>"That's right." Zhang Zhui nodded and said, "As far as our current situation is concerned, we are indeed just two dead people. Therefore, we have nothing to fear when facing those sheltering creatures."</p>

    <p>He roughly understood what Wang Ming meant.</p>

    <p>In fact, there are no more suitable candidates than him and Li Xian to deal with those difficult sheltered creatures.</p>

    <p>Because most of the creatures in the shelter have the ability to resurrect, and if you are not careful, they may suffer from their weird abilities. If you use regular troops to deal with it, you will probably suffer a big loss.</p>

    <p>But he and Li Xian are different.</p>

    <p>Even if you are a dead person, you don't mind dying a few more times...</p>

    <p>Because of the pupil power of King's Eyes, even if he and Li Xian are seriously injured, they can be automatically corrected. It can be called an advanced version of reincarnation.</p>

    <p>But even so, Li Xian and Zhang Zhui actually don't have much confidence in dealing with those sheltered creatures.</p>

    <p>They were the first to sneak in. They learned that Lord Diulei and Er Ha were also going to sneak into the underground of the castle. They planned to meet them and find a solution to contain the creatures.</p>

    <p>It's a pity that before they met, one person and one dog were sucked into the supreme world.</p>

    <p>"I know the concerns of the two seniors, so I have thought about it a long time ago. Maybe this thing can help the two seniors." At this time, Wang Ming curled up the corners of his lips. He smiled meaningfully. Then he said: He took out something like a scroll from his pocket.</p>

    <p>"This is..."</p>

    <p>Li Xian and Zhang Zhui opened their eyes almost immediately when they saw this.</p>

    <p>"Yes. This is. Minature Corpse Map." Wang Ming responded.</p>

    <p>"Minature Corpse Map?" Li Xian and Zhang Zhui were all surprised.</p>

    <p>How come there is such a thing?</p>

    <p>They know about Eternal Wrap Corpse Map. But they have never heard that Eternal Wrap Corpse Map actually has branches...</p>

    <p>"Ha, this is something I had Ling Ling draw. After he finished drawing it, he sent it directly to my hand." Wang Ming said, "Like the mechanism of the Ancient Corpse Map, this is also a powerful sealing artifact, and it is specially designed for those who have taken in the living souls. Inside is an independent space, separate from the space of the Ancient Corpse Map. The two seniors will be able to utilize this artifact, and I believe that they will be able to succeed immediately."</p>

    <p>"This was actually painted by Ling Zhenren?"</p>

    <p>Li Xian feels that Wang Ling has done another thing beyond his knowledge: "When did he draw this ...?"</p>

    <p>The Ancient Chaos Weapon. It doesn't lay eggs. Just like that?</p>

    <p>"Soon after, just before he opened King Eye's Heavenly World, he casually got one. Although it was rather random, it was enough to deal with that group of sheltered beings."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"When using it, the two seniors only need to hold this Minature Corpse Map and wander around in the underground space." Wang Ming said: "All contained creatures that try to attack you will be suppressed by this Minature Corpse Map and then included in the map. world."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>At the same time, the battle in the supreme world on the other side continues.</p>

    <p>Facing such a huge ancient god giant in the enemy camp's supreme world, it is unrealistic to say that there is no fluctuation in my heart. It can only be said that when there are enough teammates, the Office of Strategic Deception and others found it here. A sense of balance.</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng, who took action first, looked thoughtful. Master Wu Xin, an old friend he respected very much during the Eternal Era, did not expect to meet again under such circumstances.</p>

    <p>Although. The person he met was the successor of Master Wu Xin. His apprentice Nawei.</p>

    <p>But the fluctuations emitted by the divine brain are not fake.</p>

    <p>At this moment, he took the lead in attacking. His first move was a golden light palm of the Great Sun Buddha.</p>

    <p>The palm that covers the sky fell from the sky. It pressed downwards. You can clearly see every line on the palm. These lines released golden light. The energy of the golden light palm of the Great Sun Buddha was instilled into the head of the ancient god giant. Burning. Burning the sky of the highest world into a fiery red. It is an apocalyptic scene of a long night of lingering fire...</p>
