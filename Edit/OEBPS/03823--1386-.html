  <h1>Chapter 1386 Sun Ying'er's evaluation of the current situation</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"I..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong hesitated for a long time. Still unable to say anything.</p>

    <p>Her face was already red. She felt like a steam duck: "My, my favorite is grandpa..."</p>

    <p>But it's a pity that Er Ha didn't admit it: "Ha! I said, don't use relatives as excuses!"</p>

    <p>The aura unique to the divine beast emanated. The high-density spiritual energy was mixed with the power of chaos. In an instant, the ground underfoot shook slightly.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, people will not face their own hearts without external force.</p>

    <p>Seeing that Er Ha was really going to take action. Sun Rong became even more anxious.</p>

    <p>The girl stamped her feet anxiously. She didn't want to fight Er Ha, so she had to tell the truth.</p>

    <p>She almost shouted: "My favorite is my classmate Wang Ling!!!"</p>

    <p>It only takes a moment. Er Ha took back the breath he released.</p>

    <p>Very good!</p>

    <p>It nodded with satisfaction. Then he put away the phone hidden in his dog's mouth and pressed the stop recording button.</p>

    <p>"Er Ha you..." Realizing that what he just said was secretly filmed, Sun Rong was extremely anxious.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, Miss Sun. I have moral integrity. I won't send it to others."</p>

    <p>Er Ha assured in front of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"You swear!" Sun Rong said anxiously with a red face.</p>

    <p>"I swear! If I dare to reveal even a word about what happened today, I will never be a human being!" Er Ha said.</p>

    <p>At first glance, this curse sounds indeed vicious enough. But after thinking about it carefully, the girl suddenly felt that she was at a disadvantage: "But you are not a human in the first place!"</p>

    <p>"But I also have a human form. Think about it. How much of a disadvantage would it be if I didn't use a human form for the rest of my life!?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha sighed: "I can't turn into a human form. I can't fall in love with a young lady in the human world smoothly. I go out to play sports with many people at night, and then give birth to a son and a half daughter. This is tantamount to my oath to cut off my descendants." Ah! Isn't this vicious?"</p>

    <p>"Oh well..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was stunned for a moment by these deceptive words.</p>

    <p>If analyzed in this way, Er Ha's curse on himself is indeed vicious enough.</p>

    <p>But she still felt that there was something strange about this statement...</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er knows. Sun Rong was fooled!</p>

    <p>Alas. Her Rongrong is still too young!</p>

    <p>In order to prevent himself from being deceived, Sun Ying'er quickly sent a message to Er Ha: "Don't ask me excessive questions! Just normal questions! When I get back, I will go to the demon world to get you 20 sacks of big meat flies!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha raised his eyebrows at these words. He nodded slightly and agreed to the contents of the deal.</p>

    <p>"Girl over there, please briefly describe your current life situation." Er Ha looked at Sun Ying'er and asked.</p>

    <p>This question couldn't help but make Sun Ying'er burst into tears.</p>

    <p>Briefly describe the current situation of life...</p>

    <p>She felt like she had a lot to say.</p>

    <p>But thousands of words came together at the end, and only one sentence remained.</p>

    <p>There was a feeling of "sadness and tears" in her eyes, and there was a bit of crying in her voice, and a tear slipped from the corner of her eye unconsciously: "It's hard for a woman to be a man during the day , but it's hard for a man to be a man at night..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong, Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After checking, Sun Rong went up the mountain with Er Ha.</p>

    <p>In front of the dense forest, an ancient temple gradually emerged.</p>

    <p>These bricks are made of the same material as the shrine on Heavenly Dao, but they are obviously very old. There is a faint aura of law flowing on them.</p>

    <p>The door of the temple is ajar.</p>

    <p>There are cracks on the door. It seems that it has experienced some violent impact.</p>

    <p>The whole temple is covered with cobwebs and dust. It looks like it has been abandoned for many years and no one cares about it.</p>

    <p>"Where did Ajuan go?"</p>

    <p>"I observed on the way here. Except for a path halfway up the mountain, there is no other entrance. Maybe she is still waiting for us in the secret room at the back."</p>

    <p>Er Ha said: "She is the King of the God Realm. It is unlikely that there will be any problems. And the Heavenly Dao secret room here is all made by Old God. She used the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube to transform the original secret room rules inside the Rubik's Cube. It became my own secret room. I recorded my past events with Dao Ancestor Wang."</p>

    <p>There are also various ways and methods used to record feelings between lovers.</p>

    <p>Use a diary to record, keep all photos and gifts given to each other, write wishes on the old tree and tie a red string together, etc. Wait a minute!</p>

    <p>And this is the first time that a secret room has been modified to record like this.</p>

    <p>"Aohai. Please scan here." Sun Rong injected spiritual power. The Aohai in his hand immediately emitted a blue aura, centered on Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>This spiritual light turned into ripples and spread out from under Sun Rong's feet. In an instant, all the dust in the temple was washed away.</p>

    <p>The temple that was originally filled with dust became as tidy as new in the blink of an eye.</p>

    <p>"It actually has such an effect." Er Ha marveled in his heart.</p>

    <p>"Doesn't this sound like overkill?"Sun Rong was a little embarrassed.</p>

    <p>"No... Miss Sun is indeed a talent. She can actually develop the properties of a wife from a spiritual sword. It seems that she will also be a good wife and mother in the future." Er Ha praised.</p>

    <p>"Er Ha! I found that after you turned into a mythical beast, you were a little arrogant!" Sun Rong squatted down and rubbed Er Ha's face angrily: "You can't drink like before. Be more cute!"</p>

    <p>"This king is now a mythical beast. The mythical beast should have a son of the mythical beast!" Er Ha counterattacked.</p>

    <p>"Look here!"</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Ying'er on the side made a new discovery.</p>

    <p>She saw two palm prints right at the ancient temple.</p>

    <p>"This is?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong stared at the palm prints. I was very confused. I didn't understand the reason for the formation of the palm prints.</p>

    <p>On the contrary, Sun Ying'er showed a very experienced look: "Judging from the width of the palm print, this should be a man's palm print. This man should be very tall. The knuckles of the palm print are very thin. This proves the fat content of this man. Very low. He should be a man with a great figure! He is a handsome guy!"</p>

    <p>"How do you know so well..."Sun Rong was surprised.</p>

    <p>"It's so bad! I've been banged so many times by Wang Ying. Now I've gained experience from being banged on the wall!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"This palm print is a wall thumping mark, and it's very likely that it was left behind when Dao Ancestor Wang wall thumped the Old God." Sun Ying Er analyzed strongly, "This temple is really related to the Old God and Dao Ancestor Wang , perhaps Wang Daozu confessed his love to the Old God here!"</p>

    <p>"But just knowing this information is not enough." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"Is it possible that you need to be knocked against the wall to pass the level?"</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er touched her chin. Immediately her eyes lit up. She stared at Sun Rong and smiled maliciously: "Rongrong! Please cooperate with me!"</p>

    <p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

    <p>"Of course it's you, Bi Dong! Don't worry. I've been kicked by Bi Dong so many times. I have rich experience!" Sun Ying'er chuckled.</p>

    <p>After saying that, she grabbed Sun Rong's wrist and raised it above her head. She slammed it down against the wall.</p>

    <p>But don't know why.</p>

    <p>After Sun Ying'er finished this action, she felt a little chill on her back...</p>

    <p>Isn't that right?</p>

    <p>Why is there the smell of Wang Ying here!</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er was a little panicked for a moment!</p>
