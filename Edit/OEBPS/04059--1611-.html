  <h1>Chapter 1611 Gray Cult's Commission</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The matter between Guo Hao and Er Dan is actually not a secret in Class 1 and 3 of high school...</p>

    <p>The parrot Er Dan has the ability to transform into a human form. That is because of the blood in his body.</p>

    <p>Previously Wang Ling used the "Great Blood Source Technique" to track him down.</p>

    <p>But if Er Dan wants to become a human, he needs to condense the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. He needs to be under certain conditions to become a human. It's a bit like the reaction that occurs when a werewolf sees the moon.</p>

    <p>As for the continuous transformation into human form, it is basically unlikely to happen.</p>

    <p>The animalization event resulted in a polar reversal phenomenon between cultivators and spiritual beasts, and animals.</p>

    <p>Animals and spiritual beasts are transformed into humans. Cultivators instead acquire some of the characteristics of animals or spiritual beasts and directly transform into animals.</p>

    <p>This thing sounds really incredible.</p>

    <p>But one thing is certain now.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao must be feeling comfortable...</p>

    <p>Because Er Dan's human form is originally like a royal sister.</p>

    <p>The most important thing is...</p>

    <p>The scale is no smaller than the original Jiang Liuying.</p>

    <p>He is definitely the type that makes Jiugong Liangzi envious when he sees him.</p>

    <p>There weren't many people in the class to begin with.</p>

    <p>This animalization incident directly caused the loss of most of the people in the class.</p>

    <p>Except for people like Guo Hao who were trapped at home by Er Dan and could not come out, the situation of others was more serious. They directly turned into animals or spiritual beasts, so they could not come out.</p>

    <p>For example, Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying's condition is said to be serious.</p>

    <p>When I woke up, I turned into a carp...</p>

    <p>When Marshal Jiang found out, poor Jiang Yingying was lying on his bed. His life was almost in danger.</p>

    <p>This makes Wang Ling uneasy.</p>

    <p>After all, the monthly exam is coming soon.</p>

    <p>If this matter never returns to normal before the monthly exam.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid it will affect his scoring rhythm.</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect Wang Ling that you still have bunny ears. Just the same as yesterday." Chen Chao pinched Wang Ling's ears and said.</p>

    <p>When he saw this scene, he began to wonder whether the phenomenon of animalization had actually started in small amounts since yesterday.</p>

    <p>Compared with Wang Ling. Chen Chao's changes are not that big compared to yesterday.</p>

    <p>In addition to the horns and tail, Chen Chao's nose has also undergone slight changes.</p>

    <p>"As expected. Wang Ling. I read you right."</p>

    <p>At this time, Chen Chao said again.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "?"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "It is said that this phenomenon only happens to cultivators below the Nascent Soul stage. And the lower the level, the more serious the animalization phenomenon may be. I actually suspected that you were hiding some strength before. Now. It seems like I'm overthinking it."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Next to them, Gu Shunzhi, Zhenyuan and others were all ashamed.</p>

    <p>Then he quickly smoothed things over for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling is just a mascot. Of course it cannot be above the Nascent Soul stage."</p>

    <p>"Not bad. Look at classmate Wang Ling's bunny ears. They're so cute. There's no way he looks like a senior."</p>

    <p>"Have you ever seen any expert who likes to eat crispy noodles?"</p>

    <p>In a few words, Chen Chao was speechless for a while.</p>

    <p>There's no way. Now the entire Grade 1 and 3 classes are moles sent by the Office of Strategic Deception... It's just this intangible benefit.</p>

    <p>The animation incident had no effect on Gu Shunzhi, Zhen Yuan, Wang Zhen, Liu Qingyi, Fang Sheng and others at Number 60 High School. They all disguised themselves before coming to the school. So they don't look too strange.</p>

    <p>And Sun Rong also managed to escape the disaster because of the Aohai sword energy protecting the body.</p>

    <p>But in order to come to school, she still disguised herself and came to school.</p>

    <p>Just like yesterday. Behind him is the snow-white and fluffy nine-tailed fox tail.</p>

    <p>But today, there are obviously fewer people around Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>The animalization incident came too suddenly, causing many people to panic for a while.</p>

    <p>For example, today Sun Rong received dozens of text messages asking for help from Gray Cult believers.</p>

    <p>Because the relationship with animals has made them feel troubled.</p>

    <p>Some believers have also turned into sea creatures like Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>Trapped at home and unable to move, I had to connect to the Internet through the voice function to ask for help. Now, the scale of Gray Cult has grown a lot both at home and abroad.</p>

    <p>But Sun Rong feels that everyone seems to have misunderstood something...</p>

    <p>After all, Gray Cult is just a literary exchange club!</p>

    <p>However, the slogan of unity and friendship is the purpose of Gray Cult. Since believers are in need of help, Sun Rong cannot refuse.</p>

    <p>As the leader of the cult, she took action with Sun Ying'er as early as the early morning when the animalization incident began to ferment. They went door to door to find those believers in need of help...</p>

    <p>So it directly led to. When I came to class in the morning.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong looks a little tired.</p>

    <p>Although in the pencil case, Wang Ling also gives me "double sugar" milk candies.</p>

    <p>But even in this situation, she still didn't want to eat it.</p>

    <p>And now, on her mobile phone, those text messages for help are still being sent continuously...</p>

    <p>This scene made Wang Ling frown slightly.</p>

    <p>The essence of Gray Cult's existence is to provide an organization for him to cover up.</p>

    <p>To put it bluntly, it has the same function as Zhuo Yi. It's just a different nature.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi can give him the responsibility to deal with vicious incidents.</p>

    <p>The existence of Gray Cult can provide some cover for him to participate in large-scale multi-person competitions in the future.</p>

    <p>If a game is played by one's own team, Wang Ling's performance will gain some limelight. As long as the internal silence is kept quiet, there won't be much of a splash.</p>

    <p>Now as Gray Cult grows in size.</p>

    <p>As a leader and organizer, Sun Rong's hard work pays off.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling No matter how stupid he is, he still sees it.</p>

    <p>The milk candy with double sugar content that I gave yesterday was originally a reward. It was originally used to relieve fatigue... He had also given an extra large bag before.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling didn't know that Sun Rong couldn't bear to eat it.</p>

    <p>Not only was I reluctant to eat, but I also took out insurance...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is puzzled by this.</p>

    <p>There is nothing we can do.</p>

    <p>In order to relieve Sun Rong's work pressure. Wang Ling decided to resolve the matter at hand as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>Original.</p>

    <p>He didn't want to do it himself.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At noon. Wang Ling found an opportunity to go to the rooftop of the school again.</p>

    <p>This was originally the first scene where the Shadow Stream Killer was turned into a scumbag...</p>

    <p>Since the last incident where Shadow Stream invaded Number 60, it has now become a famous scenic spot in Number 60 High School. Many people usually come to the rooftop to eat together.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling basically doesn't come up very well.</p>

    <p>Today, I entrusted Jin Deng to use his vice-principal power to issue a ban. Only then did he dare to go upstairs.</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling stared at the sky.</p>

    <p>He poured spiritual energy into his King's Eyes to unleash his divine power. He fired an invisible light into the clouds.</p>

    <p>Soon, across the globe, a downpour fell.</p>

    <p>This heavy rain is mixed with Wang Ling's "Great Purification Technique" mana, which can directly eliminate this abnormal event.</p>

    <p>As the rain spreads, the mana will spread with the air flow, thus taking care of everyone affected by this matter.</p>

    <p>At this point, the matter is over...</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling's expression did not relax.</p>

    <p>He has an intuition.</p>

    <p>I feel like this thing has just begun.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>And at the moment this purifying heavy rain fell.</p>

    <p>In a secret underground laboratory in Songhai City, a middle-aged man with disheveled hair was suddenly awakened by a huge explosion in the laboratory.</p>

    <p>Just now. His dashboard exploded!</p>

    <p>"Finally found it!" At this time, the middle-aged man made an excited voice.</p>
