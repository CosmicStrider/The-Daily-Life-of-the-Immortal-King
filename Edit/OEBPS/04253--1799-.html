  <h1>Chapter 1799 We are all fathers</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Here, it's always the fists that speak. Whoever has a stronger fist controls the truth." Maiko Assi held the general's sword in his hand. He stared at Pei Luoqi with a hint of excitement in his eyes.</p>

    <p>He is the leader of a group in the Heavenly Dao League. He has heard about it for a long time, so he is not going to miss this opportunity to compete.</p>

    <p>As someone who has just stepped out of seclusion and entered a new realm, Maiko Assi is really curious whether the Heavenly Dao Alliance's combat power is as incredible as the legend says.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>Almost instantly. The sword was unsheathed. Maiko Assi took action again. He held the general's sword and his sword energy was like a rainbow. It was incredibly fast.</p>

    <p>This man is serious!</p>

    <p>At the same time as they felt the murderous intent, Mrs. Lawen and Levis also instantly retreated to both sides, keeping a distance between them.</p>

    <p>St. Peter's Basilica was overturned in an instant. The portrait of the Virgin behind Maiko Assi was swaying in the strong wind. The rope was torn off in public and floated away. This is unique to Maiko Assi's madness. Once it is overtaken After that, the legendary general of Mixiu Country will become an out-and-out madman.</p>

    <p>Facing the strong spiritual pressure and the terrifying edge that was about to attack his neck, Pei Luoqi stood still. He was far more calm than Mrs. Lawen and Levi had imagined.</p>

    <p>Previously, Pei Luoqi claimed that he had reached this point with the help of the Heavenly Dao gun in his hand. However, now he was standing in the field. Facing the sudden attack launched by Maiko Assi, he remained as unmoving as a mountain. This is enough to prove that this person is extraordinary.</p>

    <p>"Clang!"</p>

    <p>The sword struck Pei Luoqi's neck accurately, making a roar like the impact of divine iron.</p>

    <p>His body was incredibly hard. He directly blocked Maiko Assi's sword with the most ordinary posture. At the same time, traces of purple energy seeped out of Pei Luoqi's skin and wrapped around Maiko Assi's general sword.</p>

    <p>"Immortal anger?"</p>

    <p>Mrs. Lawen and Levi were shocked at the same time. They could feel that the purple gas coming out was extraordinary. They had already felt something extraordinary when the Heavenly Dao gun fired the golden bullet.</p>

    <p>Now, this immortal energy was revealed again, causing both of them to fall into horror at the same time.</p>

    <p>As expected...</p>

    <p>Pei Luoqi, leader of a group in the Heavenly Dao Alliance, after the upgrading of Earth, he took the lead in entering the realm of Venerated Immortal.</p>

    <p>Maiko Assi's sword failed to cut off the head, but the expression on his face did not change much.</p>

    <p>He snorted. Then he withdrew his general sword. He stared at Pei Luoqi, who was always squinting and smiling. He said with a coldness: "Why don't you take action."</p>

    <p>"As I said below, it is to unite you all into one force and come to the outside world in unison. Therefore, from the beginning, there was no intention to fight against General Maiko Assi."</p>

    <p>Pei Luoqi said: "My intention was to reconcile the conflict, but it would have been contrary to my intention if I had taken up the fight with General Maiko Assi. At the same time, I hope that General Maiko Assi will understand. After all, we are both fathers, and we both have a child who has recently fallen in love with learning."</p>

    <p>"Huh. Boring..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Maiko Assi took back his sword.</p>

    <p>He didn't like Pei Luoqi. From the moment this man walked into the church, Maiko Assi felt that Pei Luoqi had an indescribable expression on his face.</p>

    <p>"I know that General Maiko Assi doesn't like me. But even so, our most important task right now is to cooperate sincerely and avoid being sown by the same opponents."</p>

    <p>Pei Luoqi said: "This time I am here to talk to you. It also represents the meaning of the Arch Pope."</p>

    <p>As he spoke, Pei Luoqi took out a beautifully framed jade scroll from his arms: "This is a handwritten letter from the Pope. It also has the autograph and seal of the Grand Pope. Therefore, the result of my discussion with you this time is exactly the same. The final result of discussions with the Arch Pope."</p>

    <p>"Why didn't the Arch Pope himself come?" Maiko Assi wondered.</p>

    <p>"The Arch Pope is a man who loves learning. He has been obsessed with literature recently. Therefore, he cannot come in person." Pei Luoqi said.</p>

    <p>"Knowledge is the ladder of progress. The Arch Pope is still the same as before. He is a very motivated person."</p>

    <p>Mrs. Lawen came from the side, a smile on her face as she moved her slightly heavier body, which looked bulky but actually moved quite slowly.</p>

    <p>Maiko Assi could feel that when he had just fought against Pei Luoqi, Lawen and Levi's reaction speed had surpassed that before. The two of them had also hidden part of their strength, which was even more improved than before.</p>

    <p>After confirming the letter from the Pope in Pei Luoqi's hand, Maiko Assi sighed deeply. He stared at Pei Luoqi and said: "You're trying to set us up, but we've already got a couple of guys here, don't we? "</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Mrs. Lawen was the first to laugh: "General, there is no need to use such obscure rhetoric. You can just report my ID number directly. Yes. I have won over Miss Sun and their Number 60 High School members. Participate in the variety show challenge organized by this time. And sent his white warriors to protect them. But in fact, this is the meaning of the Arch Pope."</p>

    <p>"Is this what the Arch Pope means?"</p>

    <p>Even Levis was shocked now.</p>

    <p>Pei Luoqi smiled and said: "The purpose of the Arch Pope's doing this is actually to bring Lawen closer to those people. Therefore, it is necessary to make arrangements in advance. Including creating conflicts between Chilan Society led by President Levi and the Huaguo Shuilian Group/Office of Strategic Deception."</p>

    <p>"The nun who can be sent to my side is a member of the Tengu..."</p>

    <p>For a moment, Levi felt that his brain was a little insufficient. But soon he thought of a horrifying possibility: "Could it be that... the Arch Pope is also..."</p>

    <p>"That's right." Pei Luoqi said: "Now that things have happened, I will no longer hide it from you. The Arch Pope is actually an Eight-Star Tengu. He has a very high status in the Tengu queue. And this time with Number 60 High The six high school students from Glio City who fought against the school were also carefully selected by the Arch Pope. They were also called the Six Prodigies..."</p>

    <p>"I remember. Didn't you say there was another child?" Maiko Assi frowned and asked.</p>

    <p>"Yes." Pei Luoqi nodded: "There is a child. And this child is none other than the leader of the second group of our Heavenly Dao League. Jiuyun. He is very strong. But he was born with a childlike appearance. He has always maintained the figure of a child. This trip is also the core of command in the 6+1 mode..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>While St. Peter's Cathedral was secretly plotting the variety show challenge, in the suite of the Volute Hotel, classmate Wang Ling, who is also the "father", was also discussing specific countermeasures with everyone at Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>Just half an hour ago. Sun Rong, as the leader of Gray Cult, published a piece of coordinate information on the exclusive Gray Cult app using the key on the token.</p>

    <p>Emergency call. Within the city limits of Glio. Any Gray Cult who can help...</p>

    <p>Just half an hour later.</p>

    <p>In a private room of the hotel, a little girl who looked only twelve years old suddenly knocked on the door mysteriously.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong opened the door: "Who are you?"</p>

    <p>"My name is Maiko Abei. Sister, you can call me Xiaobei."</p>

    <p>The little girl smiled and said, "I'm here to find the legendary leader of Gray Cult."</p>
