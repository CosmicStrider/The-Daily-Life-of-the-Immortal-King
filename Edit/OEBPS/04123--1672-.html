  <h1>Chapter 1672 Toolman Zhou Ziyi</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In the constant cycle of resurrection and being instantly killed, 1212 finally gave up the idea of survival and chose the ending of manually deleting the account.</p>

    <p>After Zhou Ziyi's last wave dispersed 1212, Monk Jin Deng stopped what he was doing after confirming that there was no possibility of the minced meat 1212 transformed into being recombined and resurrected.</p>

    <p>"Solution. Is it solved..." Zhou Ziyi looked at the scene in front of him in disbelief. During the time when he was being used by monk Jin Deng, although he kept bouncing around, to be honest, he didn't. There is no uncomfortable feeling at all. Instead, there is a comfortable feeling of being massaged all over the body.</p>

    <p>This period of time seems very long. It also seems very short.</p>

    <p>By the time he came back to his senses, 1212 was already unable to get up again.</p>

    <p>"Almsgiver Zhou has immeasurable merits." Monk Jin Deng put his hands together and performed a Buddhist salute. He praised him in person.</p>

    <p>"Thank you for your hard work, Ziyi! You should take the lead in this matter!" Zhuo Yi was so happy that he couldn't help but smile from ear to ear.</p>

    <p>Because in this case, these 1212 people were actually killed by Zhou Ziyi. No one could step in and steal the heads.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Zhou Ziyi had a well-earned expression. He touched his head. He had no idea what was going on with White Hair. He could only marvel in his heart at the powerful defense capabilities of this thermal underwear...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi didn't lie to him. This set of thermal underwear is really strong! And it's ridiculously strong!</p>

    <p>It's just that Zhou Ziyi feels like something is a little weird...</p>

    <p>"Brother Zhuo asked me to wear this thermal underwear before he brought me here. He said it was to protect my safety..." Zhou Ziyi muttered in his heart. The more he thought about it, the more he felt that Zhuo Yi's purpose might be It's not just as simple as protecting his safety. Why does it look like he is deliberately arranging for him to pick up the leaks?</p>

    <p>For a moment, Zhou Ziyi became a little messy.</p>

    <p>All these calculations are not inaccurate. They are almost all in Zhuo Yi's plan. It makes Zhou Ziyi feel that Zhuo Yi seems to be particularly familiar with this aspect.</p>

    <p>While Zhou Ziyi was thinking about it, streams of hot steam suddenly emitted from his body. First it seeped out from every pore on his torso, and then concentrated and spewed out from the top of his head, like a human-shaped chimney.</p>

    <p>"This is..." Zhou Ziyi was stunned.</p>

    <p>"After accumulating a certain amount of spiritual energy, it is naturally released from the ceiling of the celestial soul to complete the charge. This is a sign of advancement. Congratulations, Ziyi." Qin Zhong realized what was happening at once.</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi was shocked again: "I... I got elevated?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, yes, yes. If I'm right. It should be the late peak of Foundation Building."</p>

    <p>"..." Zhou Ziyi's mouth was wide open. A look of dumbfounded amazement.</p>

    <p>Oh, God...</p>

    <p>That's how you get a rise!</p>

    <p>And to see Zhou Ziyi get promoted just like that. Zhuo Yi was even happier: "Ziyi! You're too good!"</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi: "..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi has been searching for the next logical successor to his "Scapegoat King" for a long time.</p>

    <p>Now it seems that Zhou Ziyi does have the ability to inherit his legacy.</p>

    <p>I came out here to practice. Not only did I solve a difficult creature, I actually got promoted to a higher level along the way.</p>

    <p>The peak of Foundation Building in the later period.</p>

    <p>This level, at Zhou Ziyi's age, is enough to be considered a genius!</p>

    <p>And Zhou Ziyi's next step is Golden Core.</p>

    <p>Before entering university, there are very few cultivators who can directly break through to the Golden Core.</p>

    <p>This once again proves Zhou Ziyi's outstanding talent in cultivation.</p>

    <p>At least in Zhuo Yi's opinion, Zhou Ziyi is much stronger than he was back then.</p>

    <p>On the other side, at the moment when 1212's life information completely disappeared, Nawei, who had been sitting in his position, finally changed his expression drastically.</p>

    <p>He didn't expect that one of the two creatures he sent to contain had been killed instantly!</p>

    <p>1212! This is the most brutal of the newly included creatures!</p>

    <p>And it has unlimited resurrection ability...</p>

    <p>He died just like that?</p>

    <p>Nawei feels that the situation is somewhat unreal.</p>

    <p>"Where is 096! What is 096 doing?" He slapped his desk and became furious.</p>

    <p>The spherical guards immediately used the surveillance insects lingering in the castle to transmit what they saw.</p>

    <p>At this moment, 096... was being ridden by a baby. There was a slight blush on his face. The snow-white rabbit fur was trembling and running on the street. He was as happy as a lotus...</p>

    <p>Nawei saw this scene and almost couldn't help but vomited three liters of blood.</p>

    <p>The two contained creatures he released.</p>

    <p>One was killed instantly. The other was used as a mount...</p>

    <p>Isn't this just giving people heads and experience, and another giving people equipment?</p>

    <p>"Where did this naughty kid come from?" Nawei was doubly surprised by Wang Nuan's sudden appearance.</p>

    <p>This is just a baby girl who looks less than one year old. How can she subdue 096?</p>

    <p>"Check for me. Whose child is this?"</p>

    <p>"Report sir. There is currently no identity data record in the baby girl database. It is suspected to be a shady account."</p>

    <p>"?" These words gave Nawei a heavy blow to the brain.</p>

    <p>Black household?</p>

    <p>A child smuggled from the ghetto?</p>

    <p>Although he didn't even bother to take a look at the slums, the identity census was generally implemented. Everyone was recorded. It was unlikely that someone would sneak in from the slums.</p>

    <p>Then the only thing that could happen is that someone might invade this Virtual Realm and bring this baby girl in.</p>

    <p>"..." Although Nawei finds this unbelievable, it cannot completely rule out this possibility.</p>

    <p>Under the violent trembling of the body. An infinite hatred ensued. Nawei wanted to teach the "Mr. Gong" a lesson. He had underestimated the ferocity of the gang.</p>

    <p>Although he still has not completely given up on the "ultimate version of the New Ancient Divine Weapons plan", the successive failures eventually led to Nawei starting to become a little over the top.</p>

    <p>This is his master and his imperial city!</p>

    <p>In his territory, he is the only one who bullies others. He cannot be bullied like that!</p>

    <p>"Send my order! Increase the intensity! Kill all these people!" Seeing that the Virtual Realm. may have been invaded by foreign enemies. Under such changes, Nawei can no longer sit idly by and ignore it.</p>

    <p>Therefore, he decided to implement the following three plans...</p>

    <p>"What do you plan to do, sir?"</p>

    <p>"In the core area. Liberate all contained creatures in SCB001-010!"</p>

    <p>"In addition, dispatch all 10,000 New Ancient Divine Weapons currently available to search for possible elements throughout the entire process!"</p>

    <p>Having said this, the man also stood up: "Besides, I decided to do it myself..."</p>

    <p>In order to ensure that there is no external penetration into Virtual Realm. He had to do this step.</p>

    <p>Shou Chong's brain has been collected.</p>

    <p>The "Master Wu Xin" deshennao made from Shou Chong's brain cell extract has also been completed.</p>

    <p>Now you just need to merge that divine brain with your own brain.</p>

    <p>He will become this world... no! Even the most intelligent existence in this universe! Achieve a perfect dimensionality reduction strike!</p>
