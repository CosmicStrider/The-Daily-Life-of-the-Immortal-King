  <h1>Chapter 1285 Sun Rong's Little Book</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After proposing to issue an "ellipsis."</p>

    <p>The girl stared at the screen in front of her and fell into deep thought.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi Actually, I'm really looking forward to the explosive effect of the girl's ellipsis.</p>

    <p>In a large group, whether it's those spreading rumors or those who follow the trend, when you see the person involved online, you still have to consider whether you will be legally responsible.</p>

    <p>At that time, it will definitely trigger the "news withdrawal" of blockbusters!</p>

    <p>This kind of collective withdrawal of news is really rare.</p>

    <p>But obviously. Sun Rong has more issues to consider.</p>

    <p>The girl hesitated for a moment. In the end, she did not send out the ellipses.</p>

    <p>"Sun Rong junior school girl, why don't you show off a little bit?" Zhuo Yi asked with a smile.</p>

    <p>"If I had sent an ellipsis, then classmate Wang Ling would definitely know. I already know that he is a powerful person." Sun Rong was very hesitant.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi suddenly realized.</p>

    <p>Only then did I realize that the girl was worried about this matter.</p>

    <p>"Master, that's indeed what he said. He has always been very low-key." Zhuo Yi nodded.</p>

    <p>"Then I'd better not post it. Otherwise, classmate Wang Ling will definitely be troubled."</p>

    <p>So in the end, the girl closed the group chat with a determined look on her face and did not press the send button.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was deeply moved by Sun Rong's sensibility.</p>

    <p>No wonder his master was willing to spend so much effort to save her.</p>

    <p>"Who else knows about me being transferred to the Buddha's Golden Lotus?" Sun Rong asked at this time.</p>

    <p>"So far, no one knows except me, Master, Master Jin Deng and Senior Heavenly Dao."</p>

    <p>"Hey. Even grandpa doesn't know?"</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>"Fortunately. I didn't tell grandpa just now that he was safe. Otherwise, would he think it was haunted?" Sun Rong couldn't help but laugh.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"The preparations over there are almost complete." Death Heavenly Dao said at this moment.</p>

    <p>He has been sensing the movements in heaven.</p>

    <p>With the full cooperation of Master Jin Deng, the King of the Divine Realm, a grand Tribulation Transcendence ceremony is about to begin.</p>

    <p>The Heavenly Dao star will use divine crystals to charge all underground spiritual veins on the earth.</p>

    <p>As a result, the aura of the earth becomes richer and larger!</p>

    <p>Let the earth complete the upgrade!</p>

    <p>Thereby further liberating the realm restrictions on the earth!</p>

    <p>"So fast?" Zhuo Yi was a little surprised.</p>

    <p>Master Jin Deng moves at an unexpected speed.</p>

    <p>"But there is one last step left."</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao said.</p>

    <p>This last step is actually very simple.</p>

    <p>It's about convincing several major families in the God's Domain to agree to upgrade the Earth.</p>

    <p>After all, it involves the interests of the upper-class families in the Divine Realm. Heavenly Dao feels that things may not be that simple. A big war is inevitable.</p>

    <p>"Want to go take a look? Take your school girl with you." At this time, Death Heavenly Dao asked.</p>

    <p>"Has my master gone?" Zhuo Yi asked worriedly.</p>

    <p>"To deal with the few pieces of materials in the Divine Realm, there is no need for Ling Zhenren to do it himself. Master Jin Deng can handle it enough." Death Heavenly Dao said.</p>

    <p>He also knew that Wang Ling would not go there in person. That's why he planned to let Zhuo Yi take Sun Rong with him to experience the big scene.</p>

    <p>The lower-level cultivators watch the showdown between the upper-level cultivators. In addition to broadening their horizons, the understanding of "Dao" is also of great help.</p>

    <p>This is death. Heavenly Dao is opening a small stove for Sun Rong and Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>On Earth, a cultivator in the Foundation Building stage usually never sees a True Immortal-level duel. Let alone a battle between cultivators on True Immortal.</p>

    <p>"Can I go too?"Sun Rong was a little surprised.</p>

    <p>"You can go, but how much you can remember is your own business. Don't forget it. After you return to the body, your memory will disappear." Death Heavenly Dao kindly reminded.</p>

    <p>In fact, he was also making crazy hints to the girl.</p>

    <p>Although the memory will disappear.</p>

    <p>But a good memory is not as good as a bad pen!</p>

    <p>Don't you have a little notebook?</p>

    <p>Just write down everything you want to remember and that's it!</p>

    <p>However, the death of Heavenly Dao cannot be directly explained.</p>

    <p>All this ultimately depends on the girl's understanding...</p>

    <p>"Senior, how are we going to get there?" Zhuo Yi asked.</p>

    <p>"Put your hand on my shoulder. I can teleport directly."</p>

    <p>Subsequently. Death Heavenly Dao hand-wringing method.</p>

    <p>A golden light bloomed from under his feet and then reached the sky.</p>

    <p>This transmission channel is exclusive to Heavenly Dao. It is the green channel leading to the divine realm.</p>

    <p>When the channel is open, it cannot be noticed by non-designated personnel.</p>

    <p>Before official transmission.</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao glanced at Sun Rong inside the Buddha's Golden Lotus.</p>

    <p>Obviously.</p>

    <p>The girl had already received his hint.</p>

    <p>I opened the cloud disk notepad on my computer in advance and planned to record the information manually.</p>

    <p>This girl is quite smart...</p>

    <p>Before the teleportation started, Death Heavenly Dao smiled coldly in his heart.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. In the meeting hall of Daoxuan Hall in the Divine Realm.</p>

    <p>The top ten big families in terms of comprehensive combat power have sent their family representatives to the scene to discuss the upgrade of the earth.</p>

    <p>Daoxuan Hall is a landmark building in the Divine Realm. It is similar to places like the National Assembly Hall.</p>

    <p>At this moment in the meeting hall, the elders of several major families gathered here.</p>

    <p>It's said to be a discussion. In fact, it's just a war of words.</p>

    <p>"What? Upgrading Earth?"</p>

    <p>"I disagree! I firmly disagree!"</p>

    <p>"Back then, Dao Ancestor spread the cultivation culture to the earth. It was just for the continuation of civilization! And the Divine Realm is the cultivation tradition!"</p>

    <p>At this time, an old man with a braided beard slapped the table and shouted excitedly.</p>

    <p>"The divine realm is a peaceful place for cultivators. The highest place! Defilement is never allowed!"</p>

    <p>This old man who looked very excited was Zhou Zhentian, the wealthy elder of the Zhou family, ranked fourth in the Divine Realm family list.</p>

    <p>Although the monk had long expected this scene to happen.</p>

    <p>However, when he looked at the old man with saliva splattering in front of him, he couldn't help but sigh in his heart.</p>

    <p>I sincerely lament the quality of cultivators in the divine realm.</p>

    <p>After all, it involves an issue of interests.</p>

    <p>The excitement is understandable.</p>

    <p>But what is the divine realm?</p>

    <p>This is the birthplace of cultivation founded by Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>In this birthplace, a clan elder who claims to be a powerful person is yelling like a shrew.</p>

    <p>In the opinion of the monk, it is really insulting to the demeanor of a cultivator.</p>

    <p>This kind of magnanimity is really not one ten thousandth of that of Ling Zhenren.</p>

    <p>And it has obviously deviated from the original intention of Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>Sail against the current. If you don't advance, you will retreat.</p>

    <p>In the monk's opinion, these eight words are very appropriate to describe the current situation of God's Domain.</p>

    <p>"Hey! Monk! Just look at it. I said they won't agree!" Miss Ajuan held her head in her hands and sat next to Jin Deng, looking eagerly at the scolding battle in front of her.</p>

    <p>The monk flicked the rosary beads in his hand. His heart was calm.</p>

    <p>Just wait until the elders of several tribes in God's Domain finish expressing their opinions cursingly.</p>

    <p>The monk just stood up and performed a Buddhist salute to everyone: "The poor monk feels that the donors have some misunderstandings. Although the earth has been upgraded, there are not many cultivators on the earth who have made the transition to the divine realm."</p>

    <p>"According to the rules set by Dao Ancestor Wang back then. Only those who have touched the realm of Venerated Immortal are qualified to come to the divine realm for further exchanges."</p>

    <p>"Even if the Earth completes its upgrade, there will only be a handful of people who can reach the realm of Venerated Immortal."</p>

    <p>However, the monk's words did not move these clan elders.</p>

    <p>"Even if this is the case, it won't work! The quantity is small now. What if there are too many in the future?"</p>

    <p>Zhou Zhentian, the elder of the Zhou family, waved his sleeves. He stared at the monk in front of him and squinted his eyes: "And monk! Which Buddha are you? Why do you represent the earth? If not for the sake of the king of the divine realm. This is Is there any place for you to talk?"</p>

    <p>"Donor, I think you still have some misunderstandings."</p>

    <p>The monk clasped his hands together and said sincerely: "I'm here just to talk. It's not a request."</p>

    <p>Zhou Zhentian snorted: "It's not just talking. What is it?"</p>

    <p>"This is a requirement."</p>

    <p>The monk said categorically: "If anyone refuses, the poor monk will have no choice but to take action."</p>

    <p>Zhou Zhentian laughed out loud instantly: "What? You, a monk, still want to kill people?"</p>

    <p>"The poor monk is a monk. He never kills any living being."</p>

    <p>At this moment, the monk raised his eyes and opened the "Swastika."</p>

    <p>Looking at the mahua bearded old man in front of him, he smiled.</p>

    <p>"This is called transcendence."</p>
