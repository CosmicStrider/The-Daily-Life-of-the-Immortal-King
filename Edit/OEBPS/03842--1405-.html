  <h1>Chapter 1405 Amber Swordãƒ»Yu Ling</h1>

  <div>



<p>Because of the Sword Conference, all sword spirits in the Sword King Realm were mobilized.</p>

<p>This is a grand event that only happens once in a century. And the most important thing is that the reward is still such a big lump of "Jian Shen Alloy!"</p>

<p>This made all the sword spirits eager to get ready. The most important thing is to participate. It will definitely not be a loss to participate.</p>

<p>And in this regard, Jiu You's reward mechanism is actually pretty good.</p>

<p>The final grand prize is "Jian Shen Alloy." The first place winner in each group has a chance to "King Palace Sword." And all the audition finalists will get an extra piece of low-purity Jian Shen small alloy.</p>

<p>This is a very small piece that Jiu You cut off from the large piece of Jian Shen alloy. After being cut by a thousand people, each piece was finally only the size of a BB bullet. And the purity was also concentrated to 5%.</p>

<p>A concentration of 5% means that when fused, the success rate is approximately 5%.</p>

<p>Therefore, the low-purity Jian Shen alloy is also nicknamed the "European Emperor's Stone" by many sword spirits. For the European Emperor, even if the success rate is only 5%, it is no different from 100%.</p>

<p>Therefore, even such a small piece of low-purity alloy is enough to make the sword spirits fight for their heads.</p>

<p>That evening, there was a long queue in front of Jian Shen Square. Countless sword spirits rushed here as soon as they received the notice.</p>

<p>Carter and Xiao Qian are responsible for on-site supervision and statistical work.</p>

<p>Lao Man and Wu Jin are responsible for maintaining order at the scene.</p>

<p>In addition to controlling the field, the two men will also participate in this group stage. It is not to compete with Sun Rong for the ranking, but to ensure that Sun Rong can advance.</p>

<p>They will have 200 people in the melee stage. Eliminate as many people as possible. Finally, they will lose to Sun Rong. They will directly recommend the girl to the first place in the group.</p>

<p>That's right. This game is so "social" and "dark" (funny).</p>

<p>Anyway, their ranking is below Aohai. Even if they are eliminated, it is not unreasonable.</p>

<p>As for Jiu You.</p>

<p>He went to find the remaining competition judges.</p>

<p>It is known that Bai Qiao, Jingke, and Yu are not participating in the judging panel. Currently, the confirmed judging positions are as follows.</p>

<p>Ranked fifth: Himself (Jiu You)</p>

<p>Ranked 6th: Xiao Qian (Toothpick Sword)</p>

<p>However, it is not enough for the two of them to serve as judges.</p>

<p>So Jiu You's job now is to pull up Yu Ling, who is ranked third, and Mo Yu, who is ranked fourth.</p>

<p>These two girls, Jiu You, both know their whereabouts.</p>
    
<p>Originally, Jiu You planned to find Sui Feng, who was ranked seventh.</p>

<p>But it's a pity. Suifeng is just like his name. He drifts in the wind... and he never knows where he is.</p>

<dfn><sup>1</sup>(Translates to "At the slightest breeze.")</dfn>

<p>Suifeng is a feather sword. It is covered with feathers. It looks light and airy. When it is waved, it can emit burning phoenix fire.</p>

<p>But Phoenix Fire has the ability to heal. So it also has a powerful healing effect. Even damaged organs can be repaired by the burning of Phoenix Fire.</p>

<p>It can bring a feeling of "pain and happiness" to the healed object...</p><p>...</p>



<p>Sword King Realm. In the Jian Shen Forest. In front of a huge 10,000-meter waterfall.</p>

<p>A girl with a bun is sitting quietly under the waterfall. She is wearing a pink cheongsam with high slits on the side. A pair of white and slender legs are sitting cross-legged.</p>

<p>There is a layer of pale pink invisible sword barrier surrounding the girl. A waterfall pours down from above her head. It falls on the sword barrier and is divided by the sword energy. The water bounces and splashes around continuously.</p>

<p>This is the Bone Burial Waterfall in the Jian Shen Forest. It is a good place for cultivation. But ordinary sword spirits dare not approach it.</p>

<p>Just like the name of the waterfall. If the sword energy is not strong enough to support it, it may be crushed on the spot by the huge water pressure of the waterfall.</p>

<p>"Yu Ling. I knew you were here." Jiu You stood on the ripples of the lake in front of the waterfall. His voice reached the girl's eyes through the roar of the waterfall hanging upside down.</p>

<p>Yu Ling opened her eyes and revealed her jewel-like pink lips: "The Sword Conference was your idea?"</p>

<p>"It seems that you are very well informed." Jiu You put his hands behind his back and said with a smile.</p>

<p>"Mo Yu was originally with me."</p>

<p>After hearing that, she went immediately. "She was more enthusiastic than I thought." Wu Jiu Literature</p>

<p>"Ha. It's obviously a jade sword. It's not gentle at all. It's frivolous." Yu Ling lowered his eyes slightly: "But the matter of judging is not suitable for me. You have found the wrong person. Isn't there Sui Feng?" ?"</p>

<p>"I don't know where he is." Jiu You shook his head.</p>

<p>In fact, if you insist on looking for it, you can always find it.</p>

<p>But time is running out now. There is not much time until the Sword Conference starts.</p>

<p>It's too late to go find Sui Feng now.</p>

<p>"It seems that he is still sensing his sword master." Yu Ling raised his head and looked at the starry sky in the distance.</p>

<p>Finding a suitable sword master is actually the long-cherished wish of every sword spirit. In fact, the top 50 sword spirits on the sword list all have the ability to travel through the sword storm alone.</p>

<p>They could have gone out a long time ago. But because they couldn't find a suitable master, they would stay in the Sword King Realm and wait for the opportunity.</p>

<p>Just like a counselor living in seclusion in the mountains.</p>

<p>"It may not be easy for Suifeng to find his sword master." Jiu You smiled bitterly.</p>

<p>"His phoenix fire has a healing effect. The burned person is in pain and happiness. Even if the sword master can be found in the end, he will be trembling." Yu Ling said.</p>

<p>"Maybe."</p>

<p>Jiu You smiled. He continued the previous topic: "Are you sure you are not a judge? Among the contestants this time, the human girl is a disciple of Master Bai Qiao. And Master Bai Qiao will not participate in the selection in order to avoid suspicion. And. She named you to be the judge."</p>

<p>In fact, Bai Qiao did not say such a thing.</p>

<p>It just gives Jiu You the right to "act cheaply."</p>

<p>As long as this Sword competition can go smoothly, Jiu You can use Bai Qiao's name at will and use Bai Qiao's name to do things.</p>

<p>At this time, Yu Ling finally raised his head. His originally serious face showed an expression of surprise, as if he had been fed a candy: "Really, she asked me to go?"</p>

<p>"Yes." Jiu You nodded affirmatively.</p>

<p>As Bai Qiao's number one hidden fan, Jiu You expected that Yu Ling would be very surprised when he heard the news.</p>

<p>But he didn't expect that the girl seemed to be more excited than he imagined.</p>

<p>"What about Mr. Jingke..." Yu Ling asked. His voice was as pleasant as spring water.</p>

<p>"Master Jingke is not coming back, but Master Bai Qiao said that they will quietly watch the battle from a distance," Jiu You said.</p>

<p>"Okay! I'll be the judge!" Yu Ling agreed immediately.</p>

<p>Jiu You looked proud.</p>

<p>Today's girl is so easy to fool...</p>

<p>However, the names of Mr. Bai Qiao and Mr. Jingke are indeed useful.</p><p>...</p>



<p>At the same time, on the other side of Jian Shen Square, the interview with Jian Bei continued.</p>

<p>"Sword Spirit Kuxuan. The fourth level of sword power. Total value: 404. Unqualified."</p>

<p>Carter lowered his head and took notes: "Next one!"</p>

<p>When he raised his head again, a boy with a shaved head suddenly appeared in front of Carter.</p>

<p>The boy showed a bit of childishness. He was only slightly taller than the registration table. He was wearing a suit of rattan armor. He looked at Carter expressionlessly: "My name is Leng Ming."</p>

<p>"Where did the little sword spirit come from?" Xiao Qian frowned.</p>

<p>This was like a sword spirit that had just been born. She stared at the little boy in front of her. She felt that his spiritual energy was pitifully low.</p>

<p>"It's actually a sword made of grass." Carter saw through the little sword spirit's true face.</p>

<p>She carefully read the information on the sword list.</p>

<p>As a result, I was surprised to find that the little sword spirit named "Leng Ming" in front of me happened to be stuck at the last place on the sword list, at position 20,000.</p>

<p>"What to do now?" Xiao Qian asked.</p>

<p>"Let him give it a try. His name is on the sword list. Although he is young, he can still compete." Carter said.</p></div>
