  <h1>Chapter 1454 Sun RongVSJiang Yingying</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling discovered for the first time that his dead fish eyes were so valuable.</p>

    <p>When she was born, Mother Wang, who was passionate about double eyelids, even disliked it... If it weren't for the fact that the plastic surgeon's knife couldn't cut Wang Ling's eyelids. Wang Ling would have been abandoned by Mother Wang long ago. I was forced to cut my eyelids into double eyelids.</p>

    <p>But as she grew older, Mother Wang's obsession with double eyelids gradually dissipated.</p>

    <p>After all, he is his own son.</p>

    <p>Since he is his own son, he will naturally like him more and more, and he will become more and more pleasing to his eyes.</p>

    <p>And now.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi and Sun Rong. Actually made such a big fuss just because of his eyes...</p>

    <p>Excluding Sun Rong's 15 billion. Jiugong alone has already spent a lot of money.</p>

    <p>He spent a huge sum of money to invest in Shou Chong. He also helped the old man build a flagship pancake store for surveillance.</p>

    <p>I even thought of asking Mr. Chen to monitor me directly at the school gate. This operation is enough.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid there will be various operations in various aspects after that...</p>

    <p>Fortunately. Wang Ling has always had a good relationship with the old man.</p>

    <p>Naturally, Uncle Chen will not betray Wang Ling easily.</p>

    <p>There is a connection here.</p>

    <p>Because it is said that Uncle Chen's grandson also had dead eyes. But he died young because he was seriously ill a few years ago.</p>

    <p>So every time Uncle Chen sees Wang Ling, he feels like he is seeing his own grandson.</p>

    <p>After half a semester of getting to know each other, the relationship between them naturally became closer.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling. Do you think this girl is attracted to you..." At this time, Uncle Chen suddenly said.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that the uncle's idea is very dangerous.</p>

    <p>It's time to take advantage of your apprentice!</p>

    <p>As his chief tool... no. To be precise, he is his chief disciple.</p>

    <p>The purpose of Zhuo Yi is to block arrows at this time.</p>

    <p>Jiugong's purpose is different from Jiang Yingying's.</p>

    <p>The main reason is to be able to find him for face-to-face questioning. In order to expose the fact that Zhuo Yi took the blame for himself.</p>

    <p>But in this matter. Wang Ling will never let Jiugong Liangzi succeed like that.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>General Administration Office. After Zhuo Yi received the text message from Wang Ling, the expression on his face was unusually calm.</p>

    <p>After meeting Jiugong Liangzi in the principal's office yesterday, Zhuo Yi knew that this young lady would definitely make a bigger fuss next.</p>

    <p>As for the menacing Jiugong Liangzi. Zhuo Yi naturally had a plan in advance.</p>

    <p>In the office. Lord Diulei is sitting aside.</p>

    <p>This time. It was him who came to Zhuo Yi's office to discuss the situation.</p>

    <p>After all, Zhuo Yi still has his own job...</p>

    <p>A general administration of hundreds of schools. I go to the Office of Strategic Deception every day. It seems a little too unprofessional.</p>

    <p>The election for the leader of the Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools will be held soon. The more important it is at this juncture, the more Zhuo Yi must pay more attention.</p>

    <p>All the people in the Office of Strategic Deception are brothers. It doesn't really matter who comes to whose door.</p>

    <p>And Lord Diulei is actually a very casual person.</p>

    <p>As a qualified combat power measurement unit, although he is the leader of a sect, he never has the slightest arrogance.</p>

    <p>He still regards everyone as his equal brother and friend.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, people will change after being in a high position.</p>

    <p>But Diulei didn't.</p>

    <p>This is one of the reasons why Wang Ling was willing to date and become friends with him in the first place.</p>

    <p>"Brother Zhuo, the situation has basically been investigated clearly."</p>

    <p>On the armchair made of mahogany, Lord Diulei said: "According to the undercover reply sent to the Jiugong family by the Office of Strategic Deception. This time the Jiugong family targeted you like this. It was actually for revenge and avenge. Back then, the Jiugong family relied on advanced demon-killing and exorcism techniques. Magic Technology. In fact, it has long been able to detect the fluctuations of the gate to another world from a long distance."</p>

    <p>"In other words, have they actually been targeting Gouzi for a long time?" Zhuo Yi asked while touching his chin.</p>

    <p>"Brother Zhuo is right." Lord Diulei nodded.</p>

    <p>On the ground. Er Ha, who was lying on the ground silently, sighed.</p>

    <p>It was so difficult back then...it was like there was a wolf in front of me and a tiger behind me.</p>

    <p>Because of the invitation from Zhuo Yi. It rushed to Zhuo Yi after Wang Ling went out to school.</p>

    <p>"So. Now what are your plans."</p>

    <p>After taking some time to understand the whole story, Er Ha looked at Zhuo Yi and said, "Are you going to ask me to confront that girl?"</p>

    <p>"Actually, I've thought about this before... But there's a saying. It's okay to accuse her. Even if you confront her, as long as that girl does a little research on you, the relationship between me and the Office of Strategic Deception. I soon found out that we are in the same group. I may not believe it." Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>"Yes." Er Ha nodded.</p>

    <p>It had previously heard about Zhuo Yi's first encounter with Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>As far as the description goes, this young lady is indeed not someone who is easily fooled.</p>

    <p>"This matter must not be exposed. For this reason, Master and Mistress are very distressed." Zhuo Yi smiled bitterly: "So this time, I need Zhenjun and Brother Gouzi to help me."</p>

    <p>"What specific requirements are there?" Lord Diulei asked.</p>

    <p>"Recreate the scene from that time."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi raised his eyes and looked at the two of them seriously.</p>

    <p>"Recreating the scene of that year is not difficult. The problem is..." Lord Diulei said.</p>

    <p>Currently, the large-scale film and television base of Office of Strategic Deception is about to be built. In order to promote the sect, Lord Diulei plans to find the core members of the sect to make a big movie with the theme of Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>But now, the film and television base can be put into use immediately.</p>

    <p>And unlike those special photography films, all scenes can be perfectly restored at 1:1.</p>

    <p>When Er Ha was awarded the reward, an area was reduced to ruins. Many buildings were blown up.</p>

    <p>These scenes can be directly realized by modern cultivators using spells and magic weapons without the need for post-production special effects.</p>

    <p>Since we want to capture reality.</p>

    <p>Of course I want to blow up the real thing!</p>

    <p>As for the door to another world, that is even more convenient.</p>

    <p>Because he is the creator of the Gate to Another World. He is also one of the core members of the Office of Strategic Deception. He is from Zhenyuan Immortal.</p>

    <p>None of this is a problem.</p>

    <p>But the key is...</p>

    <p>"I know what Zhenjun wants to say."</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhuo Yi said: "Currently, the demon world and the earth are relatively friendly. Although it was all staged for that girl to see, it would really be bad if this matter leaked out."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi has thought of this a long time ago.</p>

    <p>Essentially. This is an act of deceiving Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>But this matter must be kept highly confidential.</p>

    <p>If it is accidentally leaked and allowed to be maliciously speculated and publicized by some media with ulterior motives, it is very likely that the relationship between the two circles will deteriorate again.</p>

    <p>"I understand the truth. You called me here. You don't want me to be an actor..." Er Ha raised his head and stared at Zhuo Yi. He felt that he had already smelled something.</p>

    <p>"Dogs are man's best friend. How could I abuse a dog?" Zhuo Yi spread his hands and said.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "My idea is, do you have any bigger relatives in your family? Just let them help with the acting."</p>

    <p>"I have to ask..." Er Ha said.</p>

    <p>To it.</p>

    <p>Finding actors. It's actually not difficult.</p>

    <p>Especially since this matter still involves the commander, it will be even easier.</p>

    <p>If those toads in the clan knew that they were working for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid I'll do it even if my head is broken...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, it was morning self-study time. Teacher Pan took Jiang Yingying into the classroom.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling couldn't help but shed cold sweat on his face. He had a very bad premonition.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan faced the whole class and introduced Jiang Yingying to everyone: "Dear classmates, Jiang Yingying is a new transfer student! And he is also a top student! I hope you and your classmates will learn more!"</p>

    <p>As for Jiang Yingying's coming to school, Chen Chao and Guo Hao had found out everything about her in the cafeteria on Wednesday.</p>

    <p>Then, the news about Jiang Yingying spread in the class.</p>

    <p>But Guo Hao and others did not expect that Jiang Yingying would enter their class.</p>

    <p>"I'm new here. Classmate Jiang, tell me where you want to sit. You can tell the teacher directly." Teacher Pan smiled.</p>

    <p>The girl in front of him is both a top student and the granddaughter of Marshal Jiang, one of the ten generals. The privilege of choosing a seat is naturally within Teacher Pan's ability.</p>

    <p>"Teacher, can I sit in the last row by the window?" Jiang Yingying smiled.</p>

    <p>"You want to sit behind classmate Wang Ling?"</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan was a little surprised by this choice. She reminded her in a low voice: "Don't blame the teacher for not reminding you. Classmate Wang Ling is just a boring gourd... You sit behind him. The teacher is worried that you will become a self-conscious person." Shut up the children."</p>

    <p>"No teacher."</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying said: "I'm tall. I'm afraid of blocking my classmates' sight when sitting in the front, so it's better to sit in the back."</p>

    <p>"Okay, classmate Jiang. But the last seat. The teacher needs to check if it can be seated." Teacher Pan said.</p>

    <p>"Do you still need to check this?" Jiang Yingying was shocked.</p>

    <p>"It's like this Ms. Jiang, after the renovation of the school, all the desks and chairs are made of the finest immortal wood. And on each set of desks and chairs there is a 6-digit number. If you take a seat, this desk and chair will be bound to you, and the number on it will be your student number for the next few years"</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying: "Could it be that the numbering is particular?"</p>

    <p>"That's right." Teacher Pan nodded: "These numbers are based on the order in which each set of desks and chairs are produced. They are compiled in order."</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying: "..."</p>

    <p>As Teacher Pan explained, he began to use his class teacher authority to view the information about this set of desks and chairs on his tablet.</p>

    <p>Immediately, she sighed: "I'm sorry, classmate Jiang. I'm afraid you have to choose another seat."</p>

    <p>"Why...why..." Jiang Yingying was puzzled.</p>

    <p>"That's it. According to the production sequence, the number of the set of desks and chairs you chose is 006666. This is a beautiful number. You need to spend extra money to purchase it."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying was shocked!</p>

    <p>She came to school. She chose a seat. She actually had a pretty name...</p>

    <p>What kind of little genius came up with this idea?</p>

    <p>At this moment, Sun Rong in the crowd inadvertently showed a smile.</p>

    <p>The girl raised her lips slightly. The expression on her face was full of determination.</p>

    <p>Everything is under her control...</p>

    <p>...</p>
