  <h1>Chapter 1597 Infinite Death and Reincarnation</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Fenmu Shen didn't expect Wang Ling's move to be so bold. These hands went straight in. They were directly inserted into his huge body and stirred.</p>

    <p>In an instant, Fenmu Shen felt a sea of clouds rolling inside her body, a feeling of being turned upside down. A long whine sounded. It was like the horn of the abyss coming from Fenmu Shen's body, reaching a long distance.</p>

    <p>This is the impact sound of a wave of air rushing out from the crack after being completely shattered. It is really a landslide and tsunami, and the stars and rivers tremble.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling found that his hand that reached in was sucked by the power in Fenmu Shen's body. It seemed that countless tentacles penetrated the hand from the gaps in his body. They wrapped tightly around his hand and then spread. To the entire arm of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>These tentacles are trying to drag Wang Ling inside. As if they are trying to devour him.</p>

    <p>"Boy, you are too reckless..." At this moment, Fenmu Shen made a low voice. He has inherited the blood of the Outer God Sotos, so he is not afraid of Wang Ling's attacks.</p>

    <p>You must know that he controls the supreme laws of time and space. In fact, he has surpassed the universe-level combat power. Wang Ling Even if it is against the sky, it is impossible to defeat him in the field he is good at.</p>

    <p>Even if he dies at this moment, he can still complete the backtracking before he dies and turn back the time one second to the previous time.</p>

    <p>Therefore. He has become an immortal existence. No one else in this universe is qualified to be his opponent.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling's boldness once again exceeded Fenmu Shen's expectations.</p>

    <p>Even though he seemed to be at a disadvantage, the expression on the face of the young man in front of him did not fluctuate much. He didn't even resist. He just followed the tentacles and penetrated his body.</p>

    <p>This move made Fenmu Shen aware of the mystery. He suddenly felt that something was wrong. It was a bit too careless.</p>

    <p>With Wang Ling's ability, if he wasn't quite confident in his next actions, he would never have made such a reckless move.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen believes that he has no destiny.</p>

    <p>Because he hid his outer god's heart in his own body.</p>

    <p>Because he hid his outer god's heart in his own body.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling would not be able to get in to his vitals that easily.</p>

    <p>He controls time, space, and his own destiny, the Heart of the Outer Gods. The Heart of the Outer Gods is constantly changing its position. Wang Ling's attempts to search his body for it are like looking for a needle in a haystack.</p>

    <p>As a true immortal.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen should not be concerned about Wang Ling's behavior.</p>

    <p>But now. Wang Ling's bold behavior. It made him wonder if his heart of the Outer Gods had really been discovered...</p>

    <p>The result. A scene that surprised everyone.</p>

    <p>The young man drilled into the body of Fenmu Shen's giant grape cluster. From his body, he precisely took out a red round object the size of a grain of rice.</p>

    <p>"The Heart of the Outer God... He actually found it!" Countless people in the Corpse Map applauded. Zhang Zhui stared at this scene with round eyes. In his heart, he could only feel unbelievable.</p>

    <p>All I can say is that Wang Ling is too strong!</p>

    <p>"How is this done?"</p>

    <p>"Although Fenmu Shen has controlled Sotos' ability and has the power to manipulate time and space. But if someone has the same level of ability, I am afraid it will have a mutually canceling effect...just like the positive and negative poles."</p>

    <p>At this time, Li Xian, the star wanderer, said: "Although the power of the outer gods transcends the Tao, the truth of all things in the world can still be found."</p>

    <p>Li Xian had just finished speaking. Everyone thought that the outcome of this battle had already been determined.</p>

    <p>No one would have thought that in the face of such a powerful alien god, Wang Ling would be so precise in his attack. There was no unnecessary movement. He directly found the alien god's heart, which was like a grain of sand in countless intersecting time and space. Heart.</p>

    <p>And now. There is only one step away from the key to victory...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling All it takes is to crush the Heart of the Outer God. Fenmu Shen will definitely die.</p>

    <p>"not good!"</p>

    <p>But on the other side, Fenmu Shen's reaction was also very quick.</p>

    <p>Before Wang Ling pinched the Heart of the Outer God, he forcibly activated the ability to retrace his time, going back in time to before Wang Ling grabbed his Heart of the Outer God.</p>

    <p>The scene at this time returned to a few minutes ago.</p>

    <p>The young man in front of him frowned slightly, spread his fingers, and rushed directly into his body.</p>

    <p>The giant hand sank directly into this huge bunch of "grapes." It stirred violently...</p>

    <p>This scene looks familiar. But this time, Fenmu Shen had no intention of dragging Wang Ling. Instead, he used all the power in his body to force Wang Ling's hand out of his body.</p>

    <p>He thought that doing so would prevent Wang Ling from taking out his Heart of the Outer God.</p>

    <p>However, in the next second, Wang Ling pinched his heart and came out again.</p>

    <p>"The Heart of the Outer God...He actually found it!"</p>

    <p>Countless people in Corpse Map applauded.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui once again stared at this scene with wide eyes. He only felt incredible in his heart.</p>

    <p>All I can say is that Wang Ling is too strong!</p>

    <p>However, these people in the picture all have an inexplicable delusion.</p>

    <p>Because they feel like they've seen this before. It was as if they had seen it somewhere before...</p>

    <p>It wasn't until the same scene happened more than twenty times that the eternal warriors in the Corpse Map began to have some doubts: "This... why do I feel as if this is not the first time I have seen this scene."</p>

    <p>"Do you feel the same way? I also feel like I have seen the same scene in my dream."</p>

    <p>"It should be time going back..." At this time, the well-informed Li Xian made another judgment: "Ling Zhenren repeatedly took out the heart of the evil god. And the evil god was also constantly going back through time. He has the ability to resist. But it seems that such resistance has no effect."</p>

    <p>"It's useless." Zhang Zhui shook his head and said, "This is infinite death and reincarnation. No matter how you resist, the result will be the same. It's nothing more than a way to dig out your heart. There may be some changes."</p>

    <p>They thought that Wang Ling and Fenmu Shen had the same power to check and balance time and space.</p>

    <p>Now, both Zhang Zhui and Li Xian realized that they were wrong after all. And they were so wrong!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling This wave of operations is obviously on the fifth floor!</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen already felt that he had been deceived as early as the first time he pinched the heart of the Outer God.</p>

    <p>Because that time was also the first time Wang Ling put his body into Fenmu Shen's body.</p>

    <p>This man used his own power to directly control all time and all dimensions of space in the universe! At every possible point in time, he found Fenmu Shen's Heart of the Outer God and took it away!</p>

    <p>That was probably the result of countless clones working together!</p>

    <p>In other words, no matter how the current Fenmu Shen goes back in time, it will be invalid...</p>

    <p>Because technically speaking, he is already dead.</p>

    <p>In every different dimension of time and space.</p>

    <p>They were all killed once by Wang Ling.</p>
