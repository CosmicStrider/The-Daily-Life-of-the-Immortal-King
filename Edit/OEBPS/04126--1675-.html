  <h1>Chapter 1675 Beating</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Qin Zhong has always admired Wang Ling. He has never met Wang Ling in person. But he has heard many legends about Wang Ling from Gu Shunzhi.</p>

    <p>Now that he actually saw him in person, his mood was actually very complicated. There was a mixture of excitement, disbelief and wanting to laugh out loud.</p>

    <p>Maybe he should have thought of it a long time ago. It was in the tavern called Excellent Era. When Lord Diulei said the name "Senior Gu", he should have realized which world line he had fallen into.</p>

    <p>For Qin Zhong, meeting Wang Ling was actually a powerful tranquilizer, because it meant that he didn't have to worry about not being able to return to his original world.</p>

    <p>After all, the great Ling Zhenren is omnipotent!</p>

    <p>These ten sheltered creatures were all controlled by Nawei under the capture of the divine brain. However, the fact is that no matter how Nawei used mental power to control, he could not control their bodies in the slightest .</p>

    <p>From 001 to 010, the ten most powerful indescribable beings were vast and vast in the sky. The moment the golden Heavenly City, full of epic oceans, appeared, it seemed to have fallen into a state of petrification. It was completely motionless.</p>

    <p>All heavens and worlds. All dharmas are extinguished.</p>

    <p>In the face of this overwhelming power, no creature is strong enough to compete with Wang Ling. Countless golden rattans from the golden Heavenly City hang down and aim at these sheltered creatures. It is extremely slow, but fast enough to make people feel uncomfortable. The incredible speed instantly tied up all these sheltered creatures, and then dragged them into the world of the heavens.</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling opened his eyes again, the world in the sky had been turned upside down. He was standing on a golden city. Every brick and stone under his feet was transformed from the supreme avenue.</p>

    <p>And right in front of him were ten sheltered creatures that seemed to have just reacted.</p>

    <p>It only took a moment. When Wang Ling's pupil power was reduced.</p>

    <p>Ten powerful sheltered creatures were incorporated into the heavenly world of King's Eyes in this breath.</p>

    <p>"roar!!"</p>

    <p>Number 001 hammered the earth and made a strange cry. He was born with six iron arms. The moment Xiaoshan's fist touched the earth of the heavens and the world, it was counterattacked by the power of the great road on the land. It was like an electric shock on the ground. Keep rolling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling never took action. He did not even use the divine power of the heavens and worlds to crush him. Containment Number 001 fell into a life-threatening situation just because of this simple blow.</p>

    <p>However, the tragic situation of Number 001 did not make the other sheltered creatures feel fear. Most of these nameless creatures have the ability to heal themselves. Therefore, the injuries on their bodies are generally ignored.</p>

    <p>On the contrary, after they saw Number 001 being injured, they all pounced on Number 001 and began to dismember Number 001 inhumanely.</p>

    <p>It only took a moment. Number 001 turned into a pile of bones.</p>

    <p>Then, the remaining nine shelter students became even more powerful. From their breath to their body shape, they all received brand new blessings.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't realize that the hosting spirits were capable of such a thing. To be so brutal as to devour their own "companions." To activate their own new powers.</p>

    <p>However, this power is still not enough for Wang Ling. No matter how these sheltered creatures devour and grow, they cannot change the situation in front of them.</p>

    <p>He stretched out his index finger. He reached out a little toward Number 002 in front of him.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>Golden light shot into the sky. Number 002 exploded on the spot. It was torn into pieces.</p>

    <p>Then the pieces of meat that had been blown up and scattered in all directions turned into worm-like strips of meat, reuniting from all directions.</p>

    <p>Is it not affected by the serious injury effect?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was slightly surprised.</p>

    <p>Because the creatures he had beaten in the past had almost no possibility of reorganization and healing.</p>

    <p>However, these sheltered creatures may not be affected by his serious injury effects at all due to their different physiques.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Wang Ling, who originally thought the battle was a bit boring, regained his energy.</p>

    <p>This means that he can try some other spells that he has never used before...</p>

    <p>In normal times, there is no chance to experiment.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, as Wang Ling entered the world of the heavens with the ten sheltered creatures, the overwhelming sense of oppression also dissipated in the imperial city.</p>

    <p>Nawei didn't know what happened. But when Wang Ling left, he suddenly felt that he was okay again.</p>

    <p>"Listen to my order. Eliminate them immediately!" He used his divine brain to connect the wills of tens of thousands of New Ancient Divine Weapons. He began to control these New Ancient Divine Weapons in phalanx units. And immediately locked a focus target!</p>

    <p>That is Wang Nuan who is riding around on 096.</p>

    <p>He assumed that this foreign baby girl must be related to other outsiders, so he decided to do something to her. This might attract other outsiders.</p>

    <p>It's just a baby after all.</p>

    <p>Even though she seemed to be playing well with 096, 096 was willing to be her mount for some unknown reason and did not attack her.</p>

    <p>But after all, 096 is just a sheltered creature. Who is his opponent for the 30,000 completed New Ancient Divine Weapons?</p>

    <p>And when Nawei gave the order, the New Ancient Divine Weapons phalanx closest to Wang Nuan quickly surrounded him along the street.</p>

    <p>Dao God level New Ancient Divine Weapons. There are more than a hundred of them.</p>

    <p>This made 096 feel a little nervous.</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan grabbed 096's bunny ears. The expression on his face remained unchanged.</p>

    <p>Xiang Yi, however, looked through his high-power scope and was worried: "Mr. Ming, this girl is surrounded..."</p>

    <p>"Don't be anxious. It'll be fine." Wang Ming looked calm.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, shortly after Wang Ming finished speaking, a familiar emerald green light emitted from Wang Nuan's body.</p>

    <p>Because of the huge difference in numbers, Sword Spirit's savior contract was triggered again.</p>

    <p>So. Leng Ming was summoned here from the Sword King Realm.</p>

    <p>Although it had only been a few days since the last battle, Leng Ming's combat power showed a completely new change every time he appeared on the stage. He had grown even more.</p>

    <p>"The Lord of the City wants us to capture her. If you don't want to die, get out of the way." In New Ancient Divine Weapons, the person in charge of leading the team is a blond. The appearance and hairstyle of these people are automatically pinched through big data distribution. It comes out. Everyone looks different.</p>

    <p>"It's inexplicable. I'll give this sentence back to you." Leng Ming said. He stood in front of Wang Nuan, floating slightly in the air. He was wearing a smart practice uniform that was windless and automatic, showing his divinity.</p>

    <p>This group of New Ancient Divine Weapons were all stunned. Then they turned into anger.</p>

    <p>The God-level auras of more than a hundred of them were superimposed together, and they all bombarded Leng Ming, trying to teach him a lesson.</p>

    <p>However, Leng Ming did not even take a step back.</p>

    <p>"I've already warned you. Don't blame me for taking action." Leng Ming snorted softly. He spread out his small palm. A piece of emerald green grass appeared in his palm.</p>

    <p>"Kid, you took this grass to kill someone?" The blond man and the people behind him laughed instantly.</p>

    <p>Leng Ming said nothing.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>He threw out that one little blade of grass. Across the street!</p>

    <p>It's an unbelievably fast move. This little blade of grass split the street in two. It cuts an abyss! Countless New Ancient Divine Weapons troops couldn't react. They fell in.</p>

    <p>And then. The rift in the abyss closes quickly and unseen by the naked eye. The streets are quiet again...</p>

    <p>Because at that moment. Leng Ming remembered what Jingke had taught him.</p>

    <p>Jingke said to him: Destroying the environment is wrong...</p>

    <p>So Leng Ming felt that as long as it was damaged and then repaired, it would be fine.</p>

    <p>In this way, it doesn't count as violating Master's wishes...</p>
