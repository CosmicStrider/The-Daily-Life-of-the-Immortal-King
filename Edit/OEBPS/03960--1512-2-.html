  <h1>Chapter 1512 Injury is 2 Chinese Characters<sup>0</sup></h1>

  <dfn><sup>0</sup>(damage)</dfn>

  <div>

    <p>Previously, hair was used to lock the identity of Jiugong Xinghui and the demon spirit. Wang Ling's purpose is not just for the end.</p>

    <p>It is also to be able to properly arrange the "one-click cleanup" spell trap.</p>

    <p>He calculated that Jiugong Xinghui and the demon spirit might plan to escape.</p>

    <p>Since it is going to run away, it will definitely release a certain degree of interference.</p>

    <p>Then take the initiative to release the ghosts bound to you. This behavior is not too strange.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the moment Jiugong Xinghui's body position was locked by Wang Ling, she had already lost.</p>

    <p>It was also at that moment that Wang Ling arranged a "one-click cleanup" spell trap on all the hair. Moreover, it was also a chain-seating mechanism.</p>

    <p>Ghosts released at the same time. As long as one ghost is destroyed, the other ghosts will also suffer the same damage.</p>

    <p>It is really troublesome for Wang Ling to capture ten thousand ghosts wandering around Sun Island at the same time. The main reason is that Wang Ling is worried that he will make too much noise and hurt innocent people.</p>

    <p>But it's different now.</p>

    <p>With such a "sitting together" mechanism.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling only needs to crush one ghost. The rest will explode together.</p>

    <p>So.</p>

    <p>At the moment when ten thousand ghosts disappeared at the same time, Jiugong Xinghui and the demon spirits felt greatly shocked.</p>

    <p>This...</p>

    <p>Is this still a person?</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xinghui's face twitched, and his throat made an involuntary "dong" sound. He swallowed a mouthful of fearful saliva.</p>

    <p>"You're actually hiding in that rice-shaped magic weapon?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling used King's Eyes for tracking. He quickly locked the opponent's magic weapon for escape.</p>

    <p>It looks like a grain of rice. But Wang Ling feels that this is not a magic weapon on earth.</p>

    <p>He kept his hand and did not immediately take the next step of suppressing Jiugong Xinghui.</p>

    <p>But I want to see where Jiugong Xinghui wants to escape next.</p>

    <p>To be able to absorb so many ghosts and integrate them into oneself. I think it is actually very difficult to do it without the backing of Jiugong Xinghui's personal strength.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling has a feeling.</p>

    <p>He felt that Jiugong Xinghui's aura was different.</p>

    <p>Even though there is a demon inside her.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling can distinguish the scents of humans and ghosts very clearly.</p>

    <p>The reason why he felt strange.</p>

    <p>It's because he noticed a third kind of breath flowing in Jiugong Xinghui's body...</p>

    <p>So what exactly is it?</p>

    <p>Following Jiugong Xinghui all the way, we came to the edge of the golden coast of Sun Island.</p>

    <p>Then, a magic weapon as big as a grain of rice plunged into the beach...</p>

    <p>The whole process is extremely fast. It is almost invisible to ordinary people with the naked eye.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling did not expect that the hinterland of Zhai Xing Group was actually hidden beneath the golden beach of Sun Island.</p>

    <p>After in-depth tracking, Wang Ling was surprised to find out.</p>

    <p>It turns out that just under this golden beach, there is actually another building that looks like an underground city...</p>

    <p>If you compare Sun Island to a poached egg.</p>

    <p>Then the city below this golden beach is the yolk of this poached egg!</p>

    <p>It was airtightly wrapped inside. And it was buried extremely deep!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling used King's Eyes to track all the way. He discovered some alien texts that he had never seen before.</p>

    <p>This shocked Wang Ling even more.</p>

    <p>The purpose of Wang Ming's visit to the island this time was actually to track down the DNA chain of the alien Silver Horn who attacked Wei Zhi and Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>Why is this Zhai Xing Group... related to alien civilization?</p>

    <p>No way?</p>

    <p>It can't be such a coincidence, right?</p>

    <p>Just when Wang Ling lamented that the world is so small.</p>

    <p>In the golden city of Zhai Xing Group, which is linked to the underground of the golden beach. A tunnel leading to the depths of the seabed attracted the attention of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling uses King's Eyes to track the past remotely.</p>

    <p>I just discovered this trick hidden deep under the sea...</p>

    <p>There turned out to be a well-constructed submarine base.</p>

    <p>Just like what Wang Ling saw when he was a kid. Just like the Ultraman base in those special feature films.</p>

    <p>It's just that it's completely built underground in the deep sea.</p>

    <p>There are strong defensive barriers and barriers around it, with alien characters densely covered on them. With the current technology of human cultivators, it may be difficult to crack this level of alien barrier.</p>

    <p>Of course, no matter how high-end the barrier is, for Wang Ling, it is just a matter of a snap of the fingers.</p>

    <p>But after Wang Ling thought about it, he decided not to take action yet.</p>

    <p>This is a very crucial discovery.</p>

    <p>Because this undersea base looks a lot like a secret alien military base.</p>

    <p>This is really scary.</p>

    <p>Under the nose of a country, such a behemoth can be built quietly.</p>

    <p>This is absolutely unacceptable to any government agency in any country.</p>

    <p>Zhai Xing Group established Huaxiu. This is a huge danger. I am afraid it is a premeditated plan.</p>

    <p>If once this matter is exposed.</p>

    <p>It will be the biggest scandal facing the entire Sun Island.</p>

    <p>After switching the "Free Exploration" perspective of King's Eyes back to "Jiugong Xinghui."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw that Jiugong Xinghui and the demon spirits had driven their magic weapons into the core base of the Zhai Xing Group in the golden city below.</p>

    <p>Everything went as Wang Ling expected.</p>

    <p>As expected, Zhai Xing Group has colluded with alien civilization...</p>

    <p>In the core base of the entire Zhai Xing Group, in addition to human cultivators, there is also a silver-skinned creature with tentacles.</p>

    <p>And now. Wang Ling finally understands.</p>

    <p>The Silver Horned Man they saw earlier was actually an evolved version of this silver-skinned alien creature!</p>

    <p>Silverskin people have appeared on the earth a long time ago. They have a very powerful camouflage method. They can make their skin transform like a chameleon.</p>

    <p>And you only need to provide a photo.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Dear, I saw it. There was a silver-skinned man who stared at a photo of a human for a few seconds. Then, an astonishing change took place on his body, like a kaleidoscope.</p>

    <p>He completely transformed into the human being in the photo.</p>

    <p>In the core base, a place called [Human Learning Research Institute] attracted special attention from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>After these silver-skinned people use photos to become the people in the photos, they will also learn the culture of human cultivators, so as to better integrate into society.</p>

    <p>They learn languages, texts of various countries, play games, watch anime, and even learn how to live stream goods and bring girls to a double queue...</p>

    <p>Although this mobile game technology is very bad at first, Silverskin Man learns very quickly.</p>

    <p>They are also growing rapidly.</p>

    <p>Take the MOBA mobile game "League of Kings" as an example. It only takes a week on average for a silver-skinned man to go from giving away his head like crazy to becoming the king.</p>

    <p>This makes Wang Ling sigh with emotion...</p>

    <p>It turns out that sometimes the teammates you meet while playing games who look like they are bad are not necessarily "elementary school students!"</p>

    <p>It is also possible that this kind of aliens are mixed in human society. They are trying to adapt to human life...</p><p>...</p>

    

    <p>In the Institute of Human Learning. Silverskin people need to go through systematic learning before they can enter human society.</p>

    <p>The people who offer these courses are all real humans. And these humans are all members of the Zhai Xing Group.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Judgment. There may be some kind of transaction between the Zhai Xing Group of Sun Island and the Silverskin Man.</p>

    <p>What's interesting is that even small things like diet, the Silverskin Man learned it well under the guidance of the members of the Zhai Xing Group.</p>

    <p>"Everyone! The lesson we are learning today is {the correct way to drink drinks}!" A man who looked very strong stood in front of the podium. There were thirty silver-skinned people sitting in front of the desks in the classroom. They There is a can of Coke on the table.</p>

    <p>"This thing. Commonly known as "Fuyutaku Kairakusui." When you drink it, do as I do. Gently pull the tab off the can. And then drink tons and tons of it like this!" After the man finished drinking. The carbonated drink washed through his stomach and intestines and the vaporized gas caused him to burp.</p>

    <p>He laughed loudly: "Like this. You will hiccup after drinking. This is a normal phenomenon. You don't need to panic too much. And drinks like this will cause hiccups after drinking. In addition to carbonated drinks, there are also beers."</p>

    <p>"Comparison of the first section of non-drinking studies. The sexual phenomenon of after-drinking appears in the same study in other groups."</p><p>"..."</p>

    

    <p>Wang Ling suddenly felt that these silver-skinned people are actually quite interesting.</p>

    <p>In order to integrate into human society, I also deliberately learn these human knowledge.</p>

    <p>In today's society where "knowledge is power", even aliens who come to earth cannot avoid learning...</p>

    <p>However, in Wang Ling's view, these silver-skinned people still have a long way to go to learn.</p>

    <p>When you come into contact with human mathematics, Chinese language, physical and chemical knowledge, etc., you may even collapse...</p>

    <p>However, the Silverskin Man grows extremely fast. He also has the ability to draw inferences from one example.</p>

    <p>This makes Wang Ling feel that we have to be wary of these alien creatures.</p>

    <p>After all, the submarine military base connected to the underground golden city of Zhai Xing Group was created by these silver-skinned people.</p>

    <p>They combine the inherent knowledge in their own minds, and then learn the laws of the earth through other methods. Through the collision between knowledge and knowledge, they conduct repeated deliberation.</p>

    <p>In the end it will be possible to gain knowledge that will defeat modern attempts. Thus unlocking technology in unknown areas...</p>

    <p>Now Wang Ling seems to understand why Peng Xiren chose the Silverskin Man as the target of evolution.</p>

    <p>The growth rate of these silver-skinned people is indeed terrifyingly fast.</p>

    <p>If they could evolve into Silverhorns.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid the growth potential will be even more astonishing.</p>

    <p>"We have to go!"</p>

    <p>At this time, Jiugong Xinghui left his rice escape weapon and appeared in the core base.</p>

    <p>In the core base. The boss of Zhai Xing Group appears.</p>

    <p>It was a white beard with thorny muscles. His body was as strong as a hill.</p>

    <p>Also known as Akano Sekitora, the current member of the Zhai Xing Group, also the father of Jiugong Xinghui.</p>

    <p>"Xinghui...what happened? Why are you so panicked?" Akano Sekitora was puzzled.</p>

    <p>The human body and the ghost are combined into one for the first time. This was Akano Sekitora's idea.</p>

    <p>He got good experimental results on his daughter Akano Hoshiki.</p>

    <p>And stationing at Jiugong's house was actually Akano Sekitora's own plan.</p>

    <p>Now on Sun Island, the one who has the ability to pose a real threat to Zhai Xing Group. Akano Sekitora judges that it is the Jiugong family.</p>

    <p>If he can successfully use his daughter to annex the Jiugong family, then... dominating Sun Island will be just around the corner.</p>

    <p>The rest. The 100,000 soldiers under the control of Jiugong Xinghui's magic hair spirit. Gradually conquer the world!</p>

    <p>Akano Sekitora has such ambitions.</p>

    <p>To support such ambitions, there must be strong support.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling observed Akano Sekitora's combat effectiveness.</p>

    <p>It's actually not too strong.</p>

    <p>It has about half the fighting power of Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>If Lord Diulei's combat effectiveness is at the level of a human cultivator, it would be described as "just okay."</p>

    <p>Then Akano Sekitora. It is the best of make-do.</p>

    <p>However, it is worth Wang Ling's attention.</p>

    <p>Although Akano Sekitora is not strong, the silver-skinned man standing next to Akano Sekitora is a master.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei is already a True Venerated Immortal...and is about to enter the realm of Venerated Immortal.</p>

    <p>This silver-skinned man has the fighting power of ten Lord Diulei!</p>

    <p>A total of ten Lord Diulei!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling clicked his tongue in his heart.</p>

    <p>"Father, look..." At this time, Jiugong Xinghui let down his hair, revealing two pitiful-looking bald spots on the top of his head.</p>

    <p>"This is..." Akano Sekitora was stunned.</p>

    <p>He knew very well that his daughter's situation was different from others.</p>

    <p>Others became bald and became stronger.</p>

    <p>But her daughter is in the opposite situation...bald. This means the loss of the ghost.</p>

    <p>Judging from the damaged area on the top of her head, his daughter had lost at least more than 10,000 ghosts.</p>

    <p>Akano Sekitora was suddenly confused: "What on earth is going on? Why did we lose so much!"</p>

    <p>"It's Wang Houlang!"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Xinghui said.</p>

    <p>For a while, she felt that it was difficult for her to explain clearly to her father about the terrible "Wang Houlang."</p>

    <p>Now she and the devil are out of ideas.</p>

    <p>Besides running...</p>

    <p>There is no other idea.</p>

    <p>Escape from the earth. Then go to the alien planet and start a new life. This is what Jiugong Xinghui is thinking about right now.</p>

    <p>"Xinghui! Calm down! Our big plan is being implemented steadily! We will soon be able to unify the entire earth! As your father, I will not allow you to think of such useless things!" Akano Sekitora felt that it must be Jiugong Xinghui's recent attack. The pressure is too much.</p>

    <p>Maybe he just had a hallucination.</p>

    <p>Isn't it normal for people to lose hair when they are in a state of high mental stress?</p>

    <p>For example, the author Ku Xuan who was accused of plagiarism a while ago...it is said that his hair is almost falling out!</p>

    <p>The overall level of cultivators on earth. Akano Sekitora has already investigated it. Where can such a strong person exist...</p>

    <p>"Father! What I said...is all true!" Jiugong Xinghui felt like he couldn't argue.</p>

    <p>Akano Sekitora still shook his head: "I don't believe it. Unless the Wang Houlang you are talking about appears in front of me right now."</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling, who was observing everything through King's Eyes, tilted his neck.</p>

    <p>He had never heard such a strange request.</p>

    <p>However, in view of the difference in strength, Wang Ling did not directly let his own body manifest. He just used King's Eyes' remote summon to summon a small clone.</p>

    <p>The little clone couldn't see his face clearly. There was just a vague outline.</p>

    <p>But the moment the outline appeared, Jiugong Xinghui, who had been tortured twice, recognized it at a glance.</p>

    <p>I was so frightened on the spot: "That's him! He's Wang Houlang!"</p>

    <p>"Don't be afraid, daughter! Father is here!"</p>

    <p>Akano Sekitora sneered.</p>

    <p>Then, he faced Wang Ling's virtual body. He exerted force on his feet and waist at the same time. He struck a palm from a distance!</p>

    <p>A palm like an air cannon made a bursting sound. It rushed towards Wang Ling's clone. It landed accurately on Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Then. The little clone didn't suffer any harm.</p><p>"..."</p>

    

    <p>All of a sudden.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling suddenly thought of a word that is very popular recently.</p>
    
    <p>That is: gua sha<sup>1</sup>.</p>

  <dfn><sup>1</sup>(A traditional Chinese medicine, called scrapping.)</dfn></div>
