  <h1>Chapter 1842 How many birthday gifts did Wang Ling give?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Although the process of purchasing real estate was not as fast as expected. But after Mr. Boss Sun gave the landlord a price that he could not refuse, the landlord quickly contacted the duty room to give the future owner permission.</p>

    <p>The administrator looked at Sun Rong in shock.</p>

    <p>This, this, this...is this the ability to speculate?</p>

    <p>It was almost eight o'clock at night. Wang Ling felt calm in his heart. Because he had written out all his homework in school today. He could carry out the tasks in a down-to-earth manner without any worries.</p>

    <p>Submitting homework on time is also a manifestation of fulfilling commitments and responsibilities. Father Wang is a very responsible person in this regard. Like many people who have graduated and are working, he occasionally has the dream of being criticized by the teacher if the homework is not completed. As a result, he woke up from the dream and found that he had successfully graduated and been working for several years.</p>

    <p>Holding the master key given by the duty room, the three of them got on the elevator leading to the apartment of the video blogger Li Xuan. When they arrived at the door, Sun Rong knocked politely: "Excuse me. Is anyone there? ?"</p>

    <p>While asking, she released her spiritual sense to see. After confirming that no one was in the house, she opened the door with the master key and went in.</p>

    <p>This scene seemed a bit familiar to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>In his memory, for example, the new guest from the Office of Strategic Deception, Xiang Yi, was a good expert in this field... This guy had been honing his lock-picking skills in a deserted wasteland. He had pried out an empire's secrets and wealth.</p>

    <p>"Wait!"</p>

    <p>Just before Sun Rong was about to push the door open, You Yueqing stopped Sun Rong and Wang Ling. She took out a miniature camera from her storage bag and hung it on her robe, onn the lapel.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling frowned. This miniature camera seemed a bit familiar.</p>

    <p>"This is?"</p>

    <p>"Micro cameras and law enforcement recorders are of the same nature. Even though you are the landlord now, if something happens in the house, it is difficult to explain. So it is still important to prepare in advance."</p>

    <p>At this point, she held her blushing face as if to show off and said to Sun Rong: "To tell you the truth, this is the second birthday gift Wang Ling gave me!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>When she mentioned this, Wang Ling instantly remembered the origin of this camera.</p>

    <p>Theoretically speaking, this is not a gift from Wang Ling. It is the intention of Father Wang and Mother Wang. After all, Father Wang and Mother Wang would arrange birthday gifts for the Old Wang family and You Yueqing every year during their best years.</p>

    <p>Even if Wang Ling doesn't arrange it, Father Wang and Mother Wang will help arrange it. Then let Wang Ling give it a hint or add a blessing buff before sending it. Then the gift will become Wang Ling's own gift.</p>

    <p>So don't underestimate this little tiny camera. After being modified by Wang Ling, this camera can actually capture things that others can't see.</p>

    <p>You Yueqing has maintained the camera very well over the years. It is still as good as new. She naturally realizes the magic of the miniature camera in her hand. She also marvels at the power of modern cultivation technology...</p>

    <p>After all, there are not many cameras on the market that can directly capture ghosts and can also perform transition directly through the lens... Therefore, You Yueqing has always been very moved. She knew that this miniature camera must be valuable. Unexpectedly, Wang Ling actually gave her such an expensive birthday gift.</p>

    <p>And seeing You Yueqing showing off on the side. Sun Rong felt a little helpless.</p>

    <p>It's unrealistic to say she's not bitter.</p>

    <p>There was a bitter taste in her mouth.</p>

    <p>At the same time, she is a little envious of the childhood friendship between You Yueqing and Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>These are things she has never experienced before.</p>

    <p>But now in front of You Yueqing and Wang Ling, she can't act too restless. Otherwise, she will definitely be treated as a joke.</p>

    <p>But it's still annoying...</p>

    <p>She roared in her heart.</p>

    <p>Just like the groundhog standing in the mountains.</p>

    <p>"Come on. Let's go in." Everything was ready. You Yueqing smiled and flicked the fly whisk, signaling Sun Rong to open the door and go in.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong took a deep breath and twisted the door handle. Then she accurately found the switch in the room and turned on the light.</p>

    <p>The apartment is not too big in size. It is about less than 40 square meters. But the little Ma Jiao is fully equipped with a kitchen, bathroom, and balcony.</p>

    <p>Conch Apartment itself is an apartment for young people. It is also built in an entrepreneurial park. It can also receive subsidies from the above every year, so the rent is not particularly high.</p>

    <p>Li Xuan is only sixteen years old, the age of a student. And she only recently had the idea of going out to work. So where does the rent come from for her to live here?</p>

    <p>If she ask the former landlord about this, they will definitely not be able to figure it out. There is too much information about the tenants. If you directly ask the landlord who is Li Xuan, the former landlord will probably be confused as well.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked around the environment inside the apartment.</p>

    <p>It's clean, tidy, and even spotless... Even if it's a place where girls live, it's a bit too smooth.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong and You Yueqing checked it out. No valuable clues were found.</p>

    <p>However, it was precisely this extremely clean room that made both women suspicious.</p>

    <p>"I think it's weird." Sun Rong said: "As a girl's room, except for some girls' clothes in the closet, there doesn't seem to be anything special. All places are very clean. So clean. It looks like someone specially cleaned it."</p>

    <p>You Yueqing agreed with Sun Rong: "I agree with what Miss Sun said. There must be something wrong here!"</p>

    <p>As she spoke, she began to move around the images previously recorded by the camera. From the moment they entered the door, the images in the camera were all clean. Nothing weird was captured.</p>

    <p>This made You Yueqing frown. Her sixth sense told her that there must be something wrong with this room. And it was very big!</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling. What do you think?" she asked curiously.</p>

    <p>When she turned around, she saw Wang Ling facing a white wall and looking at it.</p>

    <p>She quickly used her camera to take pictures of the white wall. She still found nothing.</p>

    <p>"Is there something wrong with this wall?" You Yueqing asked.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling did not reply immediately.</p>

    <p>He did see some clues. He was hesitant to take action on this problematic white wall. But at the same time, he felt that it was a bit too early for him to take action now. Moreover, it would be easy to alert others and expose many problems.</p>

    <p>Therefore, he hesitated again and again. Wang Ling took his hand back again.</p>

    <p>You Yueqing didn't capture any abnormal images, which is still quite normal in Wang Ling's opinion, after all, this birthday gift has a history of nearly ten years, and it is still using the 1.0 version of the enlightenment technique...</p>

    <p>Although it is more powerful than a normal camera, it is a bit difficult to solve the problem if something serious happens.</p>

    <p>Just like in front of them.</p>

    <p>The white wall they faced.</p>

    <p>Only Wang Ling saw the obscure runes on the wall.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is convinced.</p>

    <p>These are the traces left by an Eternal...</p>
