  <h1>Chapter 1595: Ancestor Slap. 1 Inherited</h1>

  <div>

    <p>No one would have imagined that it would be a pair of giant baby hands that finally broke through the Palace of the Outer Gods.</p>

    <p>Ah Nuan girl's combat power at this time was extremely terrifying. She absorbed a large amount of power from the Tentacles of Divine Punishment, causing the energy in her body to reach a full state.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling also felt the horror of using Shadow's devouring power as the sister of the founder of Shadow.</p>

    <p>This kind of operation is so skillful. It seems as if it has been performed countless times in the mother's womb.</p>

    <p>All I can say is, Ah Nuan girl is a real genius. She is born to know how to fight.</p>

    <p>Of course. Don't look at Wang Nuan's body "expanding" to such an extent at this moment. But in fact, Shadow has a powerful devouring power that is more terrifying than a black hole. This amount of energy is actually far from enough to reach saturation.</p>

    <p>But a palace of foreign gods is obviously not enough for Ah Nuan girl to digest.</p>

    <p>The tens of thousands of Divine Punishment Tentacles in the Palace of the Outer Gods were all confident at first. But in the end, they were shocked beyond measure by Ah Nuan girl's brutal operations.</p>

    <p>"Where in the world could such a cruel child come from..."</p>

    <p>This is what many people think.</p>

    <p>Many people originally wanted to use the word "naughty kid" to define Wang Nuan. However, they felt that this label of "naughty kid" was not appropriate.</p>

    <p>Because the little girl seems to be devouring the tentacles of divine punishment. But in essence, this is an act of saving all mankind, and even saving the entire universe.</p>

    <p>Let me ask, who else in this world has just been born, with a hungry stomach and a weak baby body, to resist the overlord of the universe with the blood of the Old Dominator?</p>

    <p>Nuan Zhenren! What a profound understanding of justice!</p>

    <p>How can you use a derogatory label like "naughty kid" to describe it!</p>

    <p>This is clearly the hero among women in the world! The king of baby girls!</p>

    <p>It was not just the powerful men in the Supreme Corpse Map who were frightened.</p>

    <p>In fact, the existence of Wang Nuan has indeed gone beyond the understanding of the laws of the Palace of Outer Gods.</p>

    <p>Not to mention these eternal strong men in the picture. Anyone who sees this scene will find it difficult to understand.</p>

    <p>When the collapsed palace was finally broken through by Wang Nuan's doubled-up giant little fat hand, Fenmu Shen knew that the palace he inherited from the alien god Sotos was completely hopeless.</p>

    <p>The supreme world at this moment, accompanied by the complete collapse of the palace of the outer gods, left only a pile of broken walls and ruins, like a pile of chicken feathers.</p>

    <p>Ah Nuan girl was still chewing the tentacles of divine punishment in her hand. At this moment, she suddenly discovered that the taste of one of the tentacles seemed to be different from what she had eaten before.</p>

    <p>Her teeth were stunned for the first time and she was unable to bite.</p>

    <p>When the girl followed the clue and pulled out this special tentacle, Wang Ling saw that what was connected behind this tentacle was actually the three-petal Golden Lotus she had seen before.</p>

    <p>The Golden Lotus, which has only three petals, is in a completely alert state at this moment. The petals are tightly closed, leaving no gaps.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling The spectators were secretly surprised. They did not expect that the palace of the Outer Gods would be brought to such a state of collapse by the two of them. The Golden Lotus actually survived without any damage.</p>

    <p>If I had known he shouldn't have gone in in the first place, it would have been easier to just punch him outside and bring the palace down.</p>

    <p>When this strange three-petaled Golden Lotus appeared in the Palace of the Outer Gods.</p>

    <p>Even Fenmu Shen is very different. He inherits the bloodline of the alien god Sotos. He is the omniscient and omniscient god in the Old Dominator. He knows everything about the universe!</p>

    <p>It stands to reason that since this three-petal Golden Lotus was originally in the palace of the outer god Sotos, it should be Sotos's thing.</p>

    <p>But Fenmu Shen, who has now completed the resurrection and evolution ritual, has no memory of this matter...</p>

    <p>What exactly is this?</p>

    <p>How can you cross his knowledge and hit him right in the blind spot?</p>

    <p>At this time, the supreme world once again fell into the chaos of endless sun. Needless to say.</p>

    <p>A battle for this strange three-petal Golden Lotus broke out first at this moment.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen wanted to settle the grudge between himself and Wang Ling as soon as possible. But he didn't expect that such an episode would occur.</p>

    <p>He didn't know what the three-petal Golden Lotus was. But since it was in the palace of the Outer Gods, and it was beyond his knowledge blind spot, it must be something extremely important.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that Fenmu Shen can feel that the boy in front of him is also very interested in this thing.</p>

    <p>As the biggest enemy, he naturally cannot let Wang Ling succeed easily.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen has completed the resurrection and evolution ritual. His body is huge. From a distance, he looks like a series of bubbles...</p>

    <p>The alien god Sotos was originally nicknamed the "Bubble God."</p>

    <p>Of course. It's also a bit like grapes.</p>

    <p>This description is a bit unserious. But in the eyes of Ah Nuan girl, this is just a bunch of food.</p>

    <p>"Buzz!"</p>

    <p>I saw that from this huge foam-like body, he condensed a very small human figure. There was no lower body. The upper body was exactly what Peng Xiren's body looked like before. It was just that the whole body was covered with the Old Dominator's markings. It looked even bigger than before. Creepy and evil.</p>

    <p>The next second. Fenmu Shen, who had inherited the complete bloodline of the Outer Gods, took the lead in launching the offensive.</p>

    <p>The nearby space vibrated with Fenmu Shen's will. It seemed as if everything was collapsing and destroying.</p>

    <p>Then, from his huge body, a huge spherical lens sealed with dark light was separated. It contained amazing energy.</p>

    <p>"No birth, no form. All things perish..."</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen's murmur sounded. Echoing in the supreme world.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling instinctively sensed a hint of danger.</p>

    <p>This sphere looks like a bubble. The dense reaction of psychic energy inside is extremely real. Even if Wang Nuan swallowed so much energy and expanded to this extent, if the sphere exploded in front of her...</p>

    <p>I am afraid...</p>

    <p>Will it also remove a few hairs?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was thinking about how to prevent his sister from getting hurt.</p>

    <p>It's just that the sphere is too big. The impact range is too wide. It is almost a suicidal attack. The core energy fluctuation caused will cover the entire supreme world.</p>

    <p>However, Fenmu Shen has now become an alien god. The dual power of space and time he controls makes him completely fearless of life and death.</p>

    <p>At this moment, he urged the foam ball to fly towards Wang Nuan. It was actually a form of intimidation and coercion.</p>

    <p>He wanted the Ah Nuan girl in front of him to retreat and not hold on to the three-petal Golden Lotus at hand.</p>

    <p>Although he did not inherit the memory of the three-petal Golden Lotus, Fenmu Shen already had a guess in his mind as to what this Golden Lotus was.</p>

    <p>Too...</p>

    <p>This is in addition to "Destiny." There may be another mysterious thing...</p>

    <p>With this idea in mind, Fenmu Shen has made up his mind. It is absolutely impossible for this Golden Lotus to fall into the hands of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>However, what Fenmu Shen didn't expect was that he tried to intimidate Wang Nuan with one move, but the result was completely ineffective against Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>This little girl is very courageous.</p>

    <p>He just slapped his hands and hit the ball.</p>

    <p>This ancestral slap movement can be said to be passed down from generation to generation...</p>
