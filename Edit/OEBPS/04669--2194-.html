  <h1>Chapter 2194 The sequelae of Sun Rong</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Their original purpose of coming to earth to do illegal work is to repair the spacecraft and return to their home planet.</p>

    <p>I don't want to stay too long on earth.</p>

    <p>As a result, instead of going back now, some octopus people were directly executed by the human cub in front of them for committing unforgivable sins...</p>

    <p>The octopus boss was extremely scared.</p>

    <p>It couldn't even bear to see Wang Ling's face.</p>

    <p>I feel that if I can survive this time, I will most likely get PTSD.</p>

    <p>This human cub is too scary...</p>

    <p>"Boss. How about we...recruit?"</p>

    <p>"We just want to go back. It's better than losing our lives."</p>

    <p>"Yes, boss. Returning with your life is the first priority!"</p>

    <p>Some octopus men could no longer withstand this terrifying mental pressure and began to urge the octopus man boss to tell the truth.</p>

    <p>The purpose of arranging this module array here. And to reveal the buyer behind it.</p>

    <p>To tell the truth, the octopus boss doesn't know what this modular array is for.</p>

    <p>But I also know that the person who arranged this modular array has great ambitions. This array is most likely not a good thing.</p>

    <p>The octopus boss still has some social experience.</p>

    <p>Now that everyone has decided to work illegally, professionalism tells them that the less they know, the better.</p>

    <p>Therefore, it didn't ask any questions when accepting the task. The only information now is the buyer's mobile phone number.</p>

    <p>The octopus boss tremblingly took out his little notebook...</p>

    <p>There is a bunch of distorted Arabic mobile phone numbers recorded on it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Sun Rong each looked at each other.</p>

    <p>Each of them has his own magical power.</p>

    <p>Another person has a clear sword heart. These are the abilities that can infer the true inner voice of a creature.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling. It didn't lie. The information it knows should be that much." Sun Rong said while looking at the phone number.</p>

    <p>Maybe she was paying too much attention to the phone number. When she came to her senses, she was surprised to find that her head was very close to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This distance... maybe she could just tiptoe slightly...</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, Sun Rong's face couldn't help but heat up again. It was obviously just a last-minute thing, but she didn't have the courage anymore. She quickly took a few steps back to keep herself calm.</p>

    <p>This is taking advantage of others' danger. And I'm afraid it will scare Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>What she fears most now is arousing Wang Ling's resentment.</p>

    <p>Even if you don't catch it.</p>

    <p>At least keep the current stable friendship. It's also good.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling discovered it. There seems to be something wrong with Sun Rong recently.</p>

    <p>I always blush involuntarily.</p>

    <p>Of course. He didn't mean to peek into Sun Rong's inner thoughts.</p>

    <p>As an aspiring young man who has received the core education of modern self-cultivation socialism, it is actually very impolite to read girls' minds at will.</p>

    <p>So for Sun Rong's behavior of blushing till the neck at every turn.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling also has its own preliminary understanding.</p>

    <p>He felt that maybe he had accumulated too many cultivation-related things for Sun Rong recently.</p>

    <p>This makes Sun Rong difficult to digest in a short period of time...</p>

    <p>Well, after all, in this short period of time, my realm has improved too much, and I have mastered a lot of cultivation knowledge that I didn't have before.</p>

    <p>So there may be side effects.</p>

    <p>But if it is really the sequelae caused by teaching too many things.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that he actually has this responsibility to clear the way for Sun Rong. Check his body and so on...</p>

    <p>But now they are busy going to meet Lao Huang.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling feels that there is no rush for this moment.</p>
