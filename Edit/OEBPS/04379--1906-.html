  <h1>Chapter 1906 The Great Meat Grinder</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The looming Kongque King Ming's Dharma only appeared for a brief moment. Under the blazing sunshine, it was like a ray of shadow. It disappeared in an instant. Peng Beicen failed to see the virtual image of the Dharma. But Peng Xiren, who was watching in the dark, did You can see it clearly.</p>

    <p>He was at a higher level than Peng Beicen. He was observing the battlefield carefully in secret. Just after Dongda performed this sword move called "Wanli Hong", his eyes widened in an instant. Weiwei's extremely smart mind was also at this moment. Came to a standstill.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren was actually suspicious. He didn't know if he had seen it wrong.</p>

    <p>Kongque King Ming's Dharma... This is the supreme Dharma's virtual body that was recently offered by Emperor Dongda. There should be no one else who can cast it.</p>

    <p>Could it be said that this person is Emperor Dongda himself?</p>

    <p>No way...</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren couldn't believe it in his heart. An emperor-level figure would go to great lengths for a trick and willingly serve as a servant.</p>

    <p>How is this possible!?</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren had a lot of thoughts in his mind. After all, this was just his wishful guess.</p>

    <p>If the other party was really the Great Emperor, he probably wouldn't have deliberately exposed such a mistake for him to see. So after thinking about it carefully in his mind, he felt that he might have thought wrong.</p>

    <p>This person must not be the Great Emperor. If he were the Great Emperor, he would never make such a low-level mistake...</p>

    <p>As for how to explain the sudden appearance of King Kongque's Dharma Appearance, he thought that the origin of this servant should be that of a guard around Emperor Shidong. It is not surprising that he learned a few tricks under the influence. It can also be seen from the fact that the Dharma Appearance disappeared in an instant. I just summoned Kongque King Ming Dharma. It must be just a coincidence.</p>

    <p>A supreme Dharma like this consumes a lot of spiritual energy. Staying in the void for one more second is a sea of spiritual energy loss. Ordinary people simply cannot bear it. Even if they learn this trick, they can only It's just a little brighter like this.</p>

    <p>This was a fierce ideological collision from Peng Xiren's inner world. However, what Peng Xiren didn't know was that in fact, the Kongque Ming King's Dharma just made was a flaw deliberately exposed by Emperor Dongda.</p>

    <p>At the same time. This is also a secret instruction from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He expected that Peng Xiren must be nearby to observe the battle, so he deliberately let Dongda sell a flaw. With Peng Xiren's self-proclaimed smart and suspicious personality, he would definitely think about the problem from an angle that deviated from the truth of the matter. If he starts from the beginning The tail is covered very well. It is watertight and beats Peng Beicen. This will make it easier for problems to occur.</p>

    <p>On the other side, on the training ground, Peng Beicen frowned slightly.</p>

    <p>Just because this servant is much stronger than she imagined. Just one sword move actually defused her preemptive attack. If she doesn't take it seriously and go all out to deal with it, I'm afraid she won't be able to send this man away.</p>

    <p>She raised her spiritual power in an attempt to launch a new attack. The next moment, Dongda felt the ground beneath his feet begin to shake, causing a massive earthquake.</p>

    <p>The tide of snakes coming from all directions attracted the attention of everyone present. They were small elemental snakes summoned by the power of various elements. They were moving forward at an astonishing speed like lightning under the call of the cockroach bone sword spirit. They brought them with them. With the power of their respective elements, they charged forward in a boiling manner. The momentum of the rush made people shudder.</p>

    <p>This scene is also a scene that makes those who are intensively afraid of it collapse.</p>

    <p>These fierce little snakes are too terrifying. They gather forward at an astonishing speed, carrying a terrifying force. Taking advantage of their flexible bodies, they push forward, ignoring the terrain. They come from all directions and take the lead in the charge in an instant. A batch has arrived at the feet of Emperor Dongda.</p>

    <p>It has to be said that Peng Beicen's ability to attract the beast tide is really amazing. This is a method of elemental transformation. He uses the water and ice spiritual roots he cultivated to use the ability of the spiritual sword to transform elements, thereby trying to achieve full attribute restraint. Function. Each of these elemental snakes coming from all directions has the ability to swallow the spiritual power of the corresponding element.</p>

    <p>In other words, no matter what methods Dongda resorts to next, they will be eliminated invisible.</p>

    <p>But it's a pity that Peng Beicen missed one thing. That is, the person facing her at this moment is the emperor of a domain. Maybe this move will have a miraculous effect on others. However, as an emperor-level person, he has not seen what kind of situation the Eastern Emperor is in. pass.</p>

    <p>Playing this kind of trick in front of the emperor is like dancing a sword in front of Guan Gong. Under normal circumstances, Emperor Dongda would immediately use the Suzaku Fire Shield to wrap himself tightly like egg shells in all directions. But now he is facing the elemental devouring force. Game. This move cannot be used easily.</p>

    <p>It is true. He can also directly release the Supreme Kongque King Ming Dharma Protector. It is the holy flame that is superior to the five elements of fire. Ordinary elemental devouring flow spells cannot resist it at all. But Emperor Dongda thought that the role he was playing now was that of a servant.</p>

    <p>Since he is a servant, he should behave like a servant.</p>

    <p>So, at the moment when Emperor Dongda was about to be surrounded by a tide of snakes, he set off again, waving the Que King Sword in his hand.</p>

    <p>At first, the speed of the sword dance was very slow. But gradually, the sword flower in his hand speeded up, forming a phantom.</p>

    <p>There is no magic blessing or the power of the spirit sword itself. It is purely based on the sword energy that rolls when the sword flower is swung quickly. Under the extremely high speed of the sword, a barrier built purely with ordinary sword energy is formed.</p>

    <p>This speed was really too fast. Peng Beicen was surprised. She used her naked eyes to catch it, but it actually followed the rhythm completely.</p>

    <p>Eh?</p>

    <p>She was horrified. She watched eagerly as the elemental snakes wrapped around Emperor Dongda were beheaded crazily. At this moment, Emperor Dongda stood in the field, like a high-speed and ordinary meat grinder. Simply using his own The sword energy controlled the deadlock of this beast tide.</p>

    <p>What is the origin of this servant?</p>

    <p>In the secret room on the other side, Peng Xiren's face was cold. The initial calmness was no longer there. His eyes flickered. He had not spoken for a long time since the faint appearance of King Kongque's Dharma. The secret room was filled with excitement. With a breath of air-conditioning.</p>

    <p>"Master. Miss, she seems to have reached an impasse. The origin of this servant must not be simple." The black-robed guard said.</p>

    <p>"Waste."</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren snorted. His anger was aroused. I don't know what Peng Beicen was doing. Now it is obvious that he is no match for this servant in this situation. Even now, he has not thought of using the one he gave him. stuff.</p>

    <p>That is the most holy magic weapon.</p>

    <p>As long as you use it at the critical moment, you will definitely win.</p>

    <p>But the premise is that there will be a certain degree of sequelae.</p>

    <p>And even Peng Xiren himself doesn't know what the sequelae are.</p>

    <p>He handed the magic weapon to Peng Beicen, hoping to use his sister's body to test it. As a result, Peng Beicen's hesitant attitude really made him, the older brother, very angry.</p>
