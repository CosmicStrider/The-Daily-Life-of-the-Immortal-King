  <h1>Chapter 1580 Wang Nuan. Extreme pressure resistance</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Fenmu Shen's learning ability is amazing. Although Wang Nuan has just been born, she has the memory of when she was still a cell.</p>

    <p>In Wang Nuan's impression, there was only one person in the universe with such a strong learning ability. Before she was born, his brother Wang Ling was the only one.</p>

    <p>She didn't expect Fenmu Shen to be able to do this. Analyze Shadow in just a few minutes.</p>

    <p>And the other party's purpose is very clear.</p>

    <p>The moment I learned Shadow, I immediately had an impact on the shadow space.</p>

    <p>The shadow space is equivalent to Wang Nuan's exclusive domain.</p>

    <p>If we continue to fight here, there is absolutely no chance of winning.</p>

    <p>Because Fenmu Shen's fighting ideas are very clear.</p>

    <p>He did not engage in a love battle. Instead, he directly tore the exit of the shadow space and fled.</p>

    <p>When Wang Nuan chased him out, he saw a magic weapon with an eternal seal burning in the universe outside the space, as if some ancient ritual was being performed.</p>

    <p>As the decree burned, a majestic horn sounded in the universe. It seemed like thousands of troops were attacking.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, countless black horses crisscrossed the surroundings.</p>

    <p>Some of the spears bombarded down and chopped at Wang Nuan's body.</p>

    <p>It was hard for Wang Nuan to imagine that a newborn baby girl could survive unscathed in such a chaotic and apocalyptic universe.</p>

    <p>This apocalyptic scene was accompanied by the burning decree. It lasted for several minutes, but it was as long as millions of years.</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan suddenly noticed that the nearby environment no longer belonged to the earth.</p>

    <p>This seems... after Fenmu Shen burned the decree.</p>

    <p>Using the power of obtaining the decree, the space was forcibly transferred.</p>

    <p>"Girl, the land you are on is my core stronghold in the infinite universe. Those lowly earth cultivators like to call such a place the inherent spiritual realm. That is just the beginning." Fenmu Shen sneered. Get up.</p>

    <p>Above the inherent spiritual realm are the small world, the big world and the core world.</p>

    <p>It is the ability of a high-ranking and powerful cultivator to create a world and construct laws within his body.</p>

    <p>If every cell in the human body is regarded as a living person, then the human body itself is a universe-like existence.</p>

    <p>And the universe they are in now... maybe it's just cells in another person's body...</p>

    <p>Of course. This ability to construct the laws of the world within the body is extremely strong. In such a world, the creator of the world is God.</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan frowned slightly.</p>

    <p>There is an existence stronger than the core world. That is the "Chaos Core."</p>

    <p>It is a supreme world gradually built based on the power of chaos in the universe.</p>

    <p>Not many people can build such a world. Only eternal living fossils like Fenmu Shen can do it.</p>

    <p>Because the supreme world is too vast, it usually cannot be stored in the body.</p>

    <p>You can only choose another place to develop.</p>

    <p>This mechanism is a bit like the Heavenly Dao testing ground called "Unspeakable Land" created by Dao Ancestor Wang when he founded Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>That is actually a kind of supreme world. But it is a simplified version.</p>

    <p>The supreme world that Wang Nuan is now in, dominated by Fenmu Shen, is tens of thousands of times larger than the Unspeakable Land.</p>

    <p>The sky is shrouded in purple chaotic clouds. The barren and cracked earth is devoid of any life. Such a supreme world often symbolizes the heart of the founder.</p>

    <p>A bare ancient mountain. Wang Nuan looked around. Every inch of this world was filled with graves...</p>

    <p>The ancient characters on it can be written with all the eternal masters that Fenmu Shen has killed in the past.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid he was also affected by the summoning decree. He was forced to be summoned here in reverse.</p>

    <p>The last bit was tortured by Fenmu Shen. The last strength was exhausted. The glory of eternity faded. Buried forever in the cold mound of this supreme world...</p>

    <p>After being summoned here, although Wang Nuan had closed the right to use Fenmu ShenShadow, the person in front of him didn't care at all.</p>

    <p>"Sure enough, it's just as I thought. You are the founder of this path." Fenmu Shen's eyes narrowed slightly.</p>

    <p>From the very beginning when he learned Shadow, he focused on tearing apart the Shadow space. Then he arranged for Wang Nuan to enter his own supreme world.</p>

    <p>The purpose is clear. It is to break through the Shadow space!</p>

    <p>After this goal has been achieved, even if Wang Nuan turns off the permission, Fenmu Shen thinks it's okay.</p>

    <p>In this supreme world, he is the real master.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Nuan has the ability to control shadows, in this world, Fenmu Shen also has the ability to control every plant and tree here, and even every inch of shadow.</p>

    <p>This is not the power of Shadow. It is a kind of authority originating from the highest world level.</p>

    <p>It is equivalent to forming a restriction with Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>"Girl, the situation seems to have been reversed." Fenmu Shen's voice was distant and long. Through the land of this supreme world, it seemed that it could be transmitted to the distant shore of the universe.</p>

    <p>He put his hands on his back, suspended in the void, and slowly shuttled across the land beneath his feet. Every tomb here was an eternal level powerful person that he had personally killed.</p>

    <p>Among these people, some were also arrogant geniuses since they were born, but they still lost to him in the end...</p>

    <p>These tombstones are engraved with names. Some names have been worn away by time. Even Fenmu Shen can't remember who is buried.</p>

    <p>He killed too many geniuses and too many powerful men. It is impossible to remember all their names.</p>

    <p>But these ones with tombstones were at least opponents who had lasted three minutes under his hands.</p>

    <p>Those who haven't lasted more than three minutes are just small raised mounds of earth in this supreme world.</p>

    <p>These people don't even deserve names.</p>

    <p>"Girl, you should be lucky... because you are about to have a tombstone with your name engraved on it."</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen said. Looking at Wang Nuan on the mountain in the distance: "I will put this tombstone on the highest mountain. Among all my current opponents, except Dao Ancestor Wang, you are the one who has fought with me the longest. It will take a long time. But once you enter here, you will not have the possibility of turning over..."</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the entire supreme world suddenly heard countless complicated sounds from all directions.</p>

    <p>It was like thousands of creatures were crying. Those eternal strong men buried in the land had a powerful resentment that broke out in an instant.</p>

    <p>It was like a flood, pressing down on Wang Nuan in front of him. It felt like the sky was falling.</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan, who was originally confident of winning, began to regret. Why didn't he accept Wang Ling's assistance just now?</p>

    <p>She was just born. The first opponent she faced was the eternal strong man who was the overlord of the universe. The pressure of the supreme world made her feel a storm in her heart.</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan held back his strength and tried to stabilize his body. But this terrible resentment was too strong.</p>

    <p>With her baby body, it seems a little unstoppable...</p>

    <p>"Ha. A baby is just a baby after all." Fenmu Shen sneered at this scene.</p>

    <p>He saw Wang Nuan suppressing his blush and looking like he was trying his best to suck milk. He couldn't help but feel a little proud in his heart.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen put his hand over his hand and pressed it, increasing the pressure again.</p>

    <p>He thought Wang Nuan would be dealt with soon.</p>

    <p>But what Fenmu Shen never expected was that by the time he decided to increase the pressure for the third time, a full five minutes had already passed.</p>

    <p>"What a monster..." Fenmu Shen was surprised.</p>

    <p>Ordinary eternal masters could not resist for a few seconds under the pressure of 10% of his supreme world. The person with the highest record could withstand it for about 10 seconds.</p>

    <p>But the girl in front of him, under the pressure of 50% of his world power, actually persisted for five minutes in a daze.</p>

    <p>"Do you want to use all your strength..."</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen's eyes narrowed.</p>

    <p>100% world pressure. He has never tried it, because improper operation can easily cause the world to collapse.</p>

    <p>But now, in order to completely eliminate Wang Nuan, Fenmu Shen is determined for the rest of his life.</p>

    <p>"Girl. Let's see how long you can hold on."</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen showed no mercy. The fourth time he put his hand down, directly increasing the world's pressure from 50% to 80%... and then continued to oppress through a slowly rising trend.</p>

    <p>Under such pressure, Wang Nuan finally felt a little tired.</p>

    <p>She held back her strength. A tear was squeezed out from her red little face and fell on the ground.</p>

    <p>It was also at this moment.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen suddenly felt that his supreme world was invaded by a foreign object.</p>

    <p>He did not stop oppressing.</p>

    <p>Instead, he carefully observed Wang Nuan in front of him.</p>

    <p>He could foresee that this little girl was about to lose her strength.</p>

    <p>This is something Fenmu Shen never expected.</p>

    <p>When Wang Nuan's tears fell, there was actually a small green grass on that barren ancient mountain. It grew out against all the pressure...</p>

    <p>Immediately afterwards, a ray of emerald-green body-protecting sword light seeped out from the cracks in the barren ancient mountain. It gently wrapped Wang Nuan in it.</p>
