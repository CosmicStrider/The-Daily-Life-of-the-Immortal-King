  <h1>Chapter 1742 The 4th Dragon Lord</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Muyu wanted to recognize Wang Ling as his father. For a moment, Sun Rong was speechless and didn't know how to explain it. At the same time, Wang Ming also felt a bit bitter in his heart. Unexpectedly, Wang Ling He was only sixteen years old and he actually experienced something like this.</p>

    <p>He could foresee Wang Ling's despair. After all, he became the father of a strange child just because of a disagreement. This is indeed outrageous.</p>

    <p>If it were Wang Ming himself, he would probably be shocked.</p>

    <p>But at this time, Wang Ming was still thinking of a solution. He stared at the battlefield ahead. When the figure of a white-haired boy came into view.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming's thoughts suddenly changed. His eyes lit up and he asked Wang Muyu: "Um, Xiao Muyu. In fact, the guy you see fighting now is not your father. The white-haired guy over there is. Look. He looks so much like you."</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu poked out his little head and glanced at Wang Ying. He frowned slightly. Then he buried his head into Sun Rong's shoulder: "Huh... I don't want..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "But you can't mistake your father."</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu: "He is not my father. My father doesn't looks so vulgar."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong, Wang Ming: "..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "But. He looks exactly the same as his classmate Wang Ling. How can you tell that he is obscene... vulgar..."</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu's voice was soft and soft. He whispered softly: "It mainly depends on your temperament. It is a kind of metaphysical vulgarity."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>For a long time, Sun Rong and Wang Ming were stunned and did not speak.</p>

    <p>Only Sun Ying'er couldn't bear it any longer. Finally, she burst into laughter as clear as silver bells. The laughter was extremely magical. She was worried that she would be heard by Wang Ying, but it was too difficult to bear.</p>

    <p>This is meeting a soulmate!</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er felt funny and excited at the same time: "Muyu, what you said is good! Sister, I support you! If I had such a father, I would commit suicide by committing seppuku!"</p>

    <p>On the battlefield, Wang Ying's face was obviously very ugly. His eyes were always staring in the direction of Sun Rong. There was a depth in his eyes. At the same time, when facing Wang Muyu, there was also a kind of expression written on his face.</p>

    <p>At the same time, on the other side, when the hammer spirit of the Burning Sky Chain Hammer was instantly killed by Wang Ling with one palm, the diamond gloves and God-Eating Umbrella behind him were also trembling.</p>

    <p>They instinctively sensed danger and wanted to retreat. However, Wang Ling turned into a stream of light first and grabbed their tails. Mainly targeting the God-Eating Umbrella, holding it in the palm of his hand.</p>

    <p>This is a very special chaos device. Wang Ling can sense it. It can swallow the highest world. This kind of space-devouring magic weapon is almost unique.</p>

    <p>However, at this time, God-Eating Umbrella was pinched at the throat by Wang Ling's. He was restrained tightly. He did not dare to resist at all.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling punched the umbrella rib. The God-Eating Umbrella was so beaten on the spot that it drooled. Accompanied by screams and nausea, countless chaotic energy was released from it.</p>

    <p>Until the end. The God-Eating Umbrella sprayed out a bald head...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Only then did he achieve his goal.</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren."</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng put his hands together and bowed to Wang Ling. With a smile on his face: "This time, thank you Ling Zhenren for the rescue. I wonder if Ling Zhenren can leave the next negotiations to me?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought for a moment and then nodded. There was no trace of emotion on his face.</p>

    <p>From the moment he rescued Monk Jin Deng, he knew that the monk would come out to lobby.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling's anger had dissipated at this time. He had no intention of directly eliminating Jingze.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, he felt that torturing Jingze was a bit boring.</p>

    <p>It's like bullying a child.</p>

    <p>In order to make Jingze atone for his sins, the best way is actually to let Jingze be recruited.</p>

    <p>If we can reach an agreement before Ah Nuan girl's full moon, it seems good to let Jingze become Ah Nuan girl's dragon mount.</p>

    <p>So. After thinking about this, Wang Ling didn't want to kill Jingze anymore.</p>

    <p>This is a dragon mount.</p>

    <p>It's rare in the world. It would be so cool if you could ride it!</p>

    <p>And not only can it be used as a mount, it can also be used as a bodyguard.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that there is only 096 around Wang Nuan now. It is not enough. It needs a little more promotion.</p>

    <p>"Thank you Ling Zhenren. Ling Zhenren is so compassionate and touching."</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng performed the Buddhist ritual again and bowed in praise.</p>

    <p>Hearing these words, Wang Ling felt a little guilty.</p>

    <p>He really didn't dare to show mercy. After all, it still had a purpose.</p>

    <p>After getting permission from Wang Ling, the monk slowly approached the edge of the pit. Looking at Jingze who was beaten and covered in blood at the bottom of the pit, he also showed a very pityful expression on his face.</p>

    <p>Human cultivators could originally live in harmony with all the beings in the world. However, some races do not believe it. They have paranoia of one kind or another every day. They want to reshape the hegemony of the universe and dominate the world.</p>

    <p>But as everyone knows, the world today is no longer the era of the super-eternal era when the Dragon Clan dominated the world.</p>

    <p>Today's world, and even today's universe, are all decided by one person.</p>

    <p>And this person is standing next to him right now.</p>

    <p>"You lost. Jingze." Monk Jin Deng sighed: "There are mountains beyond the mountains. You chose the wrong person."</p>

    <p>"Lord Moon Dragon is a member of my dragon clan. It's impossible for me to believe you instead of distrusting him..." Jingze said. There was dissatisfaction in his tone and he was very angry at the same time.</p>

    <p>The power of Eternal Moon's Armor weakened, which caused his recovery time to be much longer. I thought that the Hammer Spirit plus the Diamond Gloves and the God-Eating Umbrella could help him delay a little longer. Unexpectedly, the Hammer Spirit of the Burning Sky Chain Hammer was directly Instant kill.</p>

    <p>This is a light weapon...</p>

    <p>In Wang Ling's hands, there is no room for resistance at all!</p>

    <p>The most useless ones were his Diamond Gloves and God-Eating Umbrella. He actually threw them after seeing Hammer Spirit being killed instantly!</p>

    <p>Damn it!</p>

    <p>Even if you are not illuminators, you are still sequence level three annihilators!</p>

    <p>Do you have any dignity as a chaos device?</p>

    <p>"Your dragon clan has already been destroyed. Have you ever thought about why the dragon master suddenly revived this month?" Monk Jin Deng smiled: "Jingze. The poor monk has already hinted at this. It's up to you whether you believe it or not."</p>

    <p>Jingze was silent. He did feel that the dragon clan's sudden revival was a bit suspicious. However, it was still difficult for Jingze to believe it all based on Jin Deng's words.</p>

    <p>"Really...I don't believe it..." Finally, he shook his head.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he also sneered: "Don't be too proud. The Dragon Clan has not completely failed... Do you know. The three dragon masters who commanded the Dragon Clan back then? Dark Devouring Dragon, Cangyuan Dragon and Moonlight Dragon..."</p>

    <p>"Of course I know." The monk's expression was calm.</p>

    <p>"Then do you know that there actually still exists a fourth Dragon Lord?"</p>

    <p>"The fourth Dragon Lord?" The monk's expression was obviously stunned.</p>

    <p>"Hahahaha...you really don't know!"</p>

    <p>At this time, Jingze couldn't help but laugh again: "In fact, the dragon cemetery you are stepping on is the fourth dragon master, the Lunmu Dragon! At this moment, all of us are on its dragon's back. !"</p>

    <p>On the back of a dragon?</p>

    <p>Upon hearing the news, Wang Ling suddenly felt enlightened.</p>

    <p>No wonder. From the beginning of the fight, he felt that this land was somewhat extraordinary. But he never expected that he would actually step on the back of a dragon.</p>

    <p>Not only did he not feel the slightest bit afraid, but he was also slightly excited inside.</p>

    <p>This Wheel Dragon is great. The dragon's back alone is so big.</p>

    <p>Obviously it is more suitable to be used as a mount!</p>

    <p>The needle does not poke!</p>
