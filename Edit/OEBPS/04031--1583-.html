  <h1>Chapter 1583 The Worst Person</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In a green ocean, Fenmu Shen is as small as a grain of sand. It is hard to imagine that this scene happened in Fenmu Shen's own supreme world.</p>

    <p>He thought he could be invincible in the supreme world. But he didn't expect that he would be attacked by two children.</p>

    <p>Such a shame and humiliation.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen has never experienced it.</p>

    <p>He was struggling in the green sea. He looked in great pain.</p>

    <p>Leng Ming manipulated the billions of meters of sword energy to slowly cut across the front, dividing the ocean, and at the same time approaching like his body.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen's eyes showed a look of horror. Because he suddenly found that he could not move. The green sword energy around him seemed to have grown countless hands to hold his body firmly.</p>

    <p>"Guillotine..." Fenmu Shen thought of something instantly. His pupils dilated instantly.</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Leng Ming couldn't help but ponder in his heart.</p>

    <p>After all, he is an eternal living fossil. His experience is indeed much broader than that of many people.</p>

    <p>This move is called "Grass Guillotine." The full name is: "Green Grass Guillotine."</p>

    <p>It was a spell tailor-made by his master, Bai Qiao, based on his own characteristics.</p>

    <p>It is said that the master's wife found inspiration from a certain game. The original name was "Noxus Guillotine."</p>

    <p>All spirit swords have signature sword skills derived from their own characteristics.</p>

    <p>For example, his master Jingke's signature sword skill is the "World-Destroying Sword."</p>

    <p>And the Grass Guillotine move in front of me is the signature style created by Bai Qiao for Leng Ming.</p>

    <p>Leng Ming never thought that he had just learned it and applied it in actual combat not long ago.</p>

    <p>At this time, the vast green sea formed by the sword energy has firmly enveloped this supreme world. At the same time, it has also restricted Fenmu Shen's actions.</p>

    <p>Grass Guillotine. Already generated.</p>

    <p>Neither the body nor the soul can escape actively.</p>

    <p>This is a doomed situation.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>Along with countless legions of undead that were being purified and entering the reincarnation, the green sword energy that was slowly approaching in the ocean was suppressed at the same time. It slashed towards Fenmu Shen's frozen body.</p>

    <p>Just a moment.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen's body was split into two by a green light. Extremely turbulent chaos energy surged out of his body.</p>

    <p>The energy in his body is amazing.</p>

    <p>Leng Ming felt like he had been hit by a big furnace that was about to explode.</p>

    <p>Soon, a big explosion occurred in Fenmu Shen. A huge mushroom cloud rose with Fenmu Shen as the center.</p>

    <p>The air wave of the explosion stretched for hundreds of millions of miles. It seemed to have spread to far away places.</p>

    <p>"Is everything over?" Leng Ming looked at the scene in front of him and secretly breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>He could indeed feel that Fenmu Shen's aura had disappeared.</p>

    <p>A generation of cosmic-level characters and an eternal living fossil-level existence disappeared along with the collapse of the supreme world. It really makes people feel unreal.</p>

    <p>At the same time. On the other side.</p>

    <p>After Fenmu Shen's aura disappeared, many parties sensed this at the same time.</p>

    <p>Within the Infinite Galaxy. Monk Jin Deng is receiving treatment from Crispy Noodles Dao Lord.</p>

    <p>He was seriously injured. Wang Ling was a little worried, so he sent Crispy Noodles over to take a look.</p>

    <p>When the monk arrived at the scene, he was covered in blood. He didn't even have the energy to use the Buddha's fire.</p>

    <p>Fortunately. Crispy Noodles Dao Lord arrived in time.</p>

    <p>"Thank you, Taoist Master." Jin Deng sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>In front of Fenmu Shen in his heyday, the monk found that he had no power to fight back. He still lacked too much.</p>

    <p>After that, you must hurry up and practice.</p>

    <p>"It doesn't matter."</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Lord showed a soft smile. A spiritual light was born in his palm, covering the monk's body.</p>

    <p>In fact, it just transfers the spiritual energy in one's body to the monk. Like Wang Nuan, it serves as a kind of power bank.</p>

    <p>After receiving enough psychic energy, the monk himself has the ability to recover from injuries.</p>

    <p>"His breath is really gone." At this moment, the monk raised his head and looked in a certain direction.</p>

    <p>That is the location of the highest world of Fenmu Shen.</p>

    <p>As an old enemy for a long time, the death of Fenmu Shen made the monk recall many things for a while.</p>

    <p>It's not that I feel pity for him. I just feel a little weird.</p>

    <p>He felt that this old guy didn't look like he could be killed so easily.</p>

    <p>In the astrolabe, Zheng and Peng Xiren, who were tightly connected by the monk and could not escape, also felt the fact that Fenmu Shen's aura had disappeared.</p>

    <p>"He's dead..." Peng Xiren's eyes were filled with tears: "Fuck! Why did he die!"</p>

    <p>"Why are you crying? It's not a shame."Zheng glanced at Peng Xiren upset.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren stomped his feet in anger: "That's my body... He didn't give it back to me after using it. He actually exploded with it!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Zheng was speechless for a moment. I didn't know how to comfort Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>But listen to it like this.</p>

    <p>It seems that the most miserable person in the whole thing is indeed Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>His body was taken away by Fenmu Shen. He was directly robbed of the right to inherit the tomb of Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>Now the inheritance rights of the celestial tomb are gone, and so is the physical body.</p>

    <p>The most important thing is that Fenmu Shen did not leave a will or anything before his death.</p>

    <p>There are so many treasures in the tomb today. Now they are all ownerless.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren couldn't get it. He could only watch helplessly.</p>

    <p>He planned all these things just to do something big. But he didn't expect to get anything in the end. It was all in vain.</p>

    <p>"Rebuilding the physical body in the ancestral realm is not difficult in the first place. It just takes a little time." Zheng said.</p>

    <p>Perhaps now Peng Xiren has actually entered the ancestral realm. This is the only good news. The work of reshaping the body in the ancestral realm can actually be left to the bronze cat in "The Land Abandoned by Gods."</p>

    <p>It just takes a long time.</p>

    <p>He knew that Peng Xiren was impatient.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid I can't wait any longer.</p>

    <p>"It will take thousands of years to wait..." Peng Xiren was in pain inside. The feeling of being plotted by Fenmu Shen was very strong.</p>

    <p>If he had known this, he should not have listened to the evil god's lies.</p>

    <p>But it seems it's too late to say anything now.</p>

    <p>Just when he was about to completely fall into autism.</p>

    <p>Just listen to Zheng say again: "If you really reflect on it, maybe you still have a chance."</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren: "What do you mean?"</p>

    <p>Zheng: "Based on my understanding of the evil god, he died like this before he even played out his trump cards. It's too strange."</p>

    <p>These words made Peng Xiren feel surprised.</p>

    <p>Because what Zheng said is indeed true.</p>

    <p>"But...what is his trump card? The monk told me before he left. I don't know if my idea is right." Peng Xiren frowned deeply.</p>

    <p>"Sorry. Your answer should be right."</p>

    <p>Zheng said: "But he can't completely take out that trump card now. He just used some means to get one ten thousandth of its power. Back then, Master Dao Ancestor divided and sealed his soul, making the other half even more dangerous. His soul was sealed alone in the sky tomb in order to block that power."</p>

    <p>"But what exactly does that thing do?"</p>

    <p>"Specifically, I don't know. Neither I nor the monk have seen it. But since Dao Ancestor has recognized it as a threat. Then it must be very powerful."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At this time, in the supreme world that was about to collapse, Leng Ming was floating in the void with Wang Nuan on his back.</p>

    <p>With the death of Fenmu Shen, the supreme world also fell apart at the same time.</p>

    <p>He stayed here for a while. He used his sword energy to control this supreme world into a stable state of disintegration. He prevented the arrogant sword energy from directly detonating this supreme world after he left.</p>

    <p>In that case, many innocent creatures may be affected.</p>

    <p>But soon, Leng Ming felt that something was not quite right.</p>

    <p>The supreme world that was originally collapsing.</p>

    <p>There was a stagnation...</p>

    <p>A dangerous breath came to my face.</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan felt that the originally calm atmosphere had become tense again.</p>

    <p>She wrapped her arms around Leng Ming's neck and firmly grabbed his clothes.</p>

    <p>Leng Ming frowned deeply.</p>

    <p>At this time he stared ahead.</p>

    <p>Finally found it. It's right where Fenmu Shen disappeared.</p>

    <p>There was a piece of purple flesh the size of a fingernail. It was squirming and gradually expanding...</p>
