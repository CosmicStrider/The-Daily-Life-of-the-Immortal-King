  <h1>Chapter 1837 Joint investigation with Wang Ling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It is still a cultivation training hall.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong immediately put on the nine-tailed fox mask after school that day. She changed into Hanfu and rushed here.</p>

    <p>She made an appointment with Jiang Yingying to train here.</p>

    <p>The entire training lasted about an hour. After an hour, she had to rush to meet with Wang Ling, Chen Qin.</p>

    <p>Originally Sun Rong wanted to shirk it.</p>

    <p>But because of her trip abroad a few days ago, she had already given up on Jiang Yingying several times. If she didn't come today, she was worried that it would arouse Jiang Yingying's suspicion.</p>

    <p>"Beautiful sister!" Jiang Yingying was not idle either. She rushed to the training hall ahead of Sun Rong. About ten minutes earlier. Then she didn't waste a minute. She directly followed Professor Sun Rong with training on wielding a great sword.</p>

    <p>When Sun Rong arrived, Jiang Yingying greeted her with a smile on her face. There seemed to be traces of sweat dripping down her cheeks.</p>

    <p>"Well! You worked hard! Then let's train quickly." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"good!"</p>

    <p>After practicing for about ten minutes, Jiang Yingying suddenly asked out of nowhere: "Did something happen to the beautiful lady? I feel like she's a little absent-minded today?"</p>

    <p>"Sorry. It's a bit."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong admitted it simply.</p>

    <p>Even an apprentice can tell that the master is absent-minded. And even when she is wearing a mask... Such distraction is a bit too obvious.</p>

    <p>The reason for her absence is simple.</p>

    <p>Maybe it's because of Chen Qin's incident. But more importantly, it's because of Wang Ling's incident.</p>

    <p>She actually didn't expect that Wang Ling would be willing to directly intervene in this matter. Participate in the first Gray Cult commission mission with her.</p>

    <p>She thought Wang Ling would find this matter boring and ignore it...</p>

    <p>It turns out that this piece of wood doesn't play according to the routine at all!</p>

    <p>This made Sun Rong feel a little confused.</p>

    <p>Because she doesn't know very well. They just carry out the entrusted tasks together. Does this count as a good impression of herself?</p>

    <p>"Yingying. Do you remember what I mentioned to you last time."</p>

    <p>"I know. That senior's boyfriend?"</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying laughed: "I knew that the pretty sister was absent-minded today. Nine times out of ten, it has something to do with him."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong hesitated for a moment and said: "That's right. I want to go on a mission with him. The key is that he has never been interested in such a mission before."</p>

    <p>"Then this is progress!"</p>

    <p>"Do you think it's progress?"</p>

    <p>"I think so!"</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying said: "If he have no feelings for you at all, how can he go on a mission with you?"</p>

    <p>"There is a commission fee... and it is a commission fee that he cannot refuse."</p>

    <p>"Hey. So it turns out that upper-level cultivators are also interested in money?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Anyway, Sister Rongrong, I think this is a perfect opportunity. At least you can use this mission to test it out."</p>

    <p>"But I'm afraid I'll mess it up."</p>

    <p>"I think it doesn't matter. If you act recklessly, this senior brother is still willing to perform tasks with you. Doesn't that just prove that he is interested in you?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Suddenly. Sun Rong suddenly understood.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying doesn't seem to have much experience in love. She is just the kind of girl who watches a lot of silly love TV series and comic books.</p>

    <p>The setting of a reckless heroine these days is not flattering!</p>

    <p>And this is one of the reasons why so many girls like to watch TV series where handsome men cherish each other...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong held her forehead.</p>

    <p>What everyone wants to see is never the silly and sweet Mary Sue routine of a male protagonist who exudes sunshine and rescues the reckless female protagonist. What everyone wants to see is just a sweet interaction between a normal female protagonist who does not cause trouble and a normal male protagonist!</p>

    <p>Anyway, after talking with Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong understands one thing.</p>

    <p>That is, the love experience provided by Jiang Yingying has no substantial reference value.</p>

    <p>She can even do the reverse based on the experience provided by Jiang Yingying...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In class, Old Gudong's knowledge popularization, which I don't know if it can be called hint, gave Wang Ling and Sun Rong some inspiration. Now that there is inspiration, then it is time to enter the stage of idea verification.</p>

    <p>First of all. A living person cannot disappear for no reason. Assume that the video blogger is really in danger. Wang Ling feels that there will definitely be some clues left behind.</p>

    <p>In the modern world of cultivation, there are too many ways to restore the truth. Even if Wang Ling does not use the strange spells he has mastered, the Cultivation Police Station can still find flaws through existing technical means.</p>

    <p>The zombie water that was once popular in the world of cultivation is actually available now.</p>

    <p>After killing someone, pouring a drop onto the corpse will cause the entire corpse to completely evaporate in a very short period of time without leaving any trace... This method once became a must-have magic weapon for secret competition between major forces in troubled times.</p>

    <p>However, even this magical liquid that once could destroy corpses and eliminate traces of them is still detectable with modern cultivation techniques.</p>

    <p>Let's say element camera.</p>

    <p>After a cultivator dies, the spiritual roots in his body often leave traces of elements consistent with his spiritual roots in the air.</p>

    <p>Shoot a possible crime scene through the element camera. You can see the outline of the body outlined by natural elements in the camera screen.</p>

    <p>Of course...</p>

    <p>It wouldn't be difficult if Wang Ling was in the past.</p>

    <p>He doesn't need a camera. He can do it with King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The gray cafe on the student street near Number 60 High School. It has become a gathering point for Gray Cult believers.</p>

    <p>After the training with Jiang Yingying, Sun Rong rushed here immediately.</p>

    <p>At this time, Chen Qin and Wang Ling had been waiting in the cafe for a long time.</p>

    <p>On the way, she sent herself a Gray Cult leader's order. It was mainly written for Chen Qin to read. The leader's order clearly stated that the Gray Cult leader was aware of the matter and gave full authority to the person in charge of the Number 60 High School Gray Cult branch. Sun Rong and Gray Cult cultist Wang Ling responsibility for this.</p>

    <p>It's strange to say that Gray Cult was originally established because of the essay called Wang Ling written by Crispy Noodles Dao Lord for Wang Ling at the Jiulong Mountain Physical Arts Conference. And because of the golden sentence in the essay "A grain of dust in the era." Packaged Wang Ling into a little composition genius.</p>

    <p>But in fact, most of the believers who joined Gray Cult thought that this essay was written by the leader of Gray Cult...</p>

    <p>Naturally, Wang Ling has tampered with most people's memories. He is responsible for rationalizing everything.</p>

    <p>Now he's just a Gray Cultist. Which makes perfect sense.</p>

    <p>After all, he is just a writer.</p>

    <p>Gray Cult knows nothing...</p>

    <p>"Classmate Sun Rong. You are here!"</p>

    <p>Chen Qin had been sitting in the private room of the cafe with Wang Ling for a long time. When she saw Sun Rong, she felt like she had seen a life-saving straw. She looked like she was about to cry.</p>

    <p>"What...what happened?"Sun Rong was startled.</p>

    <p>"My classmate Wang Ling and I sat here for a long time. He didn't say a word."</p>

    <p>Classmate Chen Qin looked worried: "I suspect that classmate Wang Ling... is broken!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Sun Rong: "..."</p>
