    <p>Note: The timeline of this article is: when Wang Nuan was 10 years old (third grade of primary school)</p>

    <p>That is, the protagonists of the Immortal King feature film: Wang Ling, Sun Rong are 26 years old (based on the setting of the Immortal King's worldview university. They are still studying in university)</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Extra Chapter 1: Problem Girl</p>

    <p>Wuhuang District. Food Street.</p>

    <p>At noon in early autumn, Sun Rong wore a mask and sunglasses and arrived at the appointed place.</p>

    <p>The retro building in front of you looks like an ancient inn. It is the most famous soup dumpling restaurant on this food street.</p>

    <p>Although adequate precautions had been taken, the girl's tall and graceful figure still attracted the attention of many people around her along the way.</p>

    <p>"This girl must be a beauty! Look at me licking the screen from a distance! Suck it!"</p>

    <p>"I give this leg ten points! Suck it!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Ignoring the lewd looks from some passers-by, Sun Rong quickly searched with his spiritual sense after arriving at his destination.</p>

    <p>Soon, she discovered the girl who was secretly observing her in the corner.</p>

    <p>The girl wears a white shoulder-strap short-sleeved upper body, a short denim skirt and a pair of Crocs on the lower body.</p>

    <p>"Sister Rongrong!"</p>

    <p>Seeing that she was discovered, the girl immediately waved her hand.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong stared at the girl in front of him. He sighed helplessly: "Ah Nuan. You are a girl. You should pay attention to your appearance when you go out. You can easily be targeted by bad guys."</p>

    <p>"It's okay. Sister Rongrong." Wang Nuan smiled brightly, showing her cute little tiger teeth.</p>

    <p>"no!"</p>

    <p>Fortunately. She was prepared.</p>

    <p>He immediately took out a thin pink jacket from the storage bag and helped the girl put it on.</p>

    <p>"Hey, Sister Rongrong, is it necessary to be so exaggerated? Who can beat me except my brother?" Wang Nuan was never afraid of the girl's behavior.</p>

    <p>But today she made a special appointment with Sun Rong here. In fact, she wanted to ask for something.</p>

    <p>So I had to put on my coat obediently and obey the girl's instructions.</p>

    <p>"I'm worried about the bad guys who are targeting you. What if you beat me to death?"</p>

    <p>"You actually said the same thing as my brother!"</p>

    <p>"It's only natural..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong shrugged helplessly. He sat down on an empty seat in front of Wang Nuan. Looking at the steaming soup bags and tea on the dining table, he couldn't help but smile: "Tell me. Ask me out specifically." What's the matter?"</p>

    <p>Based on her understanding of Wang Nuan, she knew that there must be something fishy about being so courteous for nothing.</p>

    <p>"Eh? Are you getting to the point so quickly...don't you ask about my brother?"</p>

    <p>"Things should be settled one by one. It is impossible to repay a favor with information. I want to hear what you want to do with me this time. Then I will make a decision." Sun Rong smiled.</p>

    <p>She has grown up watching Wang Nuan and knows the girl's personality well.</p>

    <p>"Besides, if I want to know about your brother now, I don't necessarily need to know it from your mouth."</p>

    <p>"Huh! Wang Ying, this traitor!" Wang Nuan frowned, and his sharp little tiger teeth showed their sharpness.</p>

    <p>The intelligence source of Sun Rong was immediately deduced.</p>

    <p>But it's a pity that she can't do anything about Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>His brother Wang Ling is too powerful...far beyond Wang Nuan's imagination.</p>

    <p>She is obviously the ancestor of Shadow. But in the end, that man can actually restrict her abilities.</p>

    <p>Why!</p>

    <p>I was born ten years late. I am really losing blood!</p>

    <p>And Wang Nuan knows very well that such a gap cannot be made up in a short while.</p>

    <p>"Actually, it's not a big deal to find Sister Rongrong today..." Wang Nuan said tentatively.</p>

    <p>"Eh? You want my signature again?" Sun Rong subconsciously speculated.</p>

    <p>Completely different from Wang Ling. Wang Nuan's study is actually very problematic...</p>

    <p>It's not that Wang Nuan is stupid. It's that the little girl doesn't put her mind on studying at all.</p>

    <p>No matter how smart a person is, if he has no intention to study, his grades will naturally not be very good.</p>

    <p>So this imitation signature thing is actually not the first time Sun Rong has done it.</p>

    <p>"A little more trouble..." Wang Nuan pinched his thumb and index finger.</p>

    <p>"Teacher looking for parents?"</p>

    <p>"No...it's a little more troublesome..." Wang Nuan revealed the answer: "It's actually a parent-teacher meeting!"</p>

    <p>"Ah. Ah Nuan. Your request seems a bit troublesome..." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>I was feeling a headache. I saw Wang Nuan take out his transcript.</p>

    <p>Other subjects are not counted. The three subjects besides Chinese and Mathematics are added together. Wang Nuan's total score is exactly 60 points... Such an accurate combination of scores. In the eyes of Sun Rong, he is indeed a rare talent.</p>

    <p>"Ah Nuan, back then, your brother was famous for being a great score suppressor. If you had paid more attention to your studies, you wouldn't have had to come to me." Sun Rong gazed at the report card and frowned, "Leng Ming and you grew up together, so it's perfectly fine for him to tutor you, right?"</p>

    <p>"Studying is so boring! Where are the fun games!"</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan showed his white teeth and smiled and said: "I don't want Leng Ming to teach me. He is dull and dull. Just like my brother. He wants to sleep after only a few minutes of listening."</p>

    <p>"Then there are no girls in your class with good grades who can play with you?" Sun Rong asked again.</p>

    <p>"I'm not interested in socializing with those girls, only Little Wei and I play the best!"</p>

    <p>"Little Wei..."Sun Rong held his forehead again.</p>

    <p>The Little Wei mentioned by Wang Nuan. His full name is Sun Wei. He is a little cousin of Sun Rong... who happens to be in the same school as Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>But it's a pity that Little Wei's results are not very good either...</p>

    <p>The two girls were together. I guess I knew how much headache the head teacher was having.</p>

    <p>"Sister Rongrong, I'll tell you quietly. Little Wei also found someone to go for her this time!" Wang Nuan chuckled.</p>

    <p>"Who are you looking for?"Sun Rong was curious.</p>

    <p>"I don't know yet. I'm not interested in learning more. It's better to play games! I've almost finished the new stand-alone game {The Only Koi in the World of Cultivation}!" Wang Nuan said happily.</p>

    <p>She spent most of her energy on completing the clearance strategy with Bai Qiao.</p>

    <p>The excitement of chasing the first place in the server is far greater than the excitement of being first in the exam.</p>

    <p>"Actually, you just need to..." Sun Rong stared at Wang Nuan but hesitated to speak.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Nuan's grades are indeed not good now, in fact, as long as the little girl sets her mind to study for half an hour, she will not be reduced to this situation.</p>

    <p>Even Wang Nuan himself knows it very well. As long as you stay in front and cram for a while, it is absolutely no problem to get an 80 or 90% casually.</p>

    <p>However, the little girl always has only one reason. She feels that studying is a waste of time.</p>

    <p>This is obviously a wrong concept.</p>

    <p>However, ten-year-old children are very playful. It is unrealistic to correct them in a short period of time. It requires long-term and patient guidance.</p>

    <p>"Ah Nuan. It's not impossible for you to ask me to go, but you have to agree to one condition." Sun Rong calmed down. She put down the transcript in her hand and looked at the little girl in front of her seriously.</p>

    <p>"Want information about my brother?"</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan chuckled. His small mouth was like a machine gun and he started to reveal the news: "There are no suspicious girls around my brother recently! It's in the safe period! Sister Rongrong, don't worry! There was a girl who was pestering my brother before. I drove her away!" Speaking of this, the little girl put her hands on her hips and looked very proud.</p>

    <p>"Who...who asked you this!" Sun Rong's face was hot. He was a little confused about whether to laugh or cry.</p>

    <p>Mainly because Wang Nuan spoke very loudly, which attracted the attention of many strangers in the soup dumpling restaurant, making Sun Rong blush for a while.</p>

    <p>"Eh? Isn't that the information?"</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan touched his chin and thought carefully: "If Sister Rongrong has helped me so much this time, I think it should be worth 50 new pieces of information. When I finish collecting them all, I will compile it into a document and send it to Sister Rongrong!"</p>

    <p>"What I want is not information..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong took a deep breath and looked at Wang Nuan: "If I go to the parent-teacher meeting for you, you have to promise me that I will at least pass the next exam! Otherwise, I won't help you again in the future. Busy!"</p>

    <p>"OK!"</p>

    <p>To Sun Rong's surprise, the little girl agreed immediately.</p>

    <p>"I agreed quickly..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong sighed. He couldn't help but reach out and pinch Wang Nuan's soft face: "You are asking for trouble."</p>

    <p>"It's okay! Is there more? My sister-in-law is here!"</p>

    <p>"Who... who is your sister-in-law..."</p>
