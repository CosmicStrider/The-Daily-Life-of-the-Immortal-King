  <h1>Chapter 1246 The Growth of Zhuo Yi</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Although there is no familiarity between Snake and Keorn.</p>

    <p>He can be a colleague who has worked in the same unit. In addition, Keorn has secretly investigated Snake's information in private.</p>

    <p>He felt that Snake seemed to be a completely different person after transforming into an ethereal spirit.</p>

    <p>Snake became more arrogant. It could even be said that he became more conceited.</p>

    <p>"After becoming a virtual spirit, has your personality changed...?"</p>

    <p>This is a new discovery of Keorn. And he believes that this kind of personality change can be regarded as two types.</p>

    <p>The first type is earthly cultivators invaded by ethereal spirits.</p>

    <p>Because of the fusion with the virtual spirit. Under the premise that the mental space is controlled, even the personality will be occupied by the virtual spirit.</p>

    <p>Their behavior patterns don't seem abnormal, but they are still quite different from usual.</p>

    <p>Teacher Liu from Number 60 High School is the best example.</p>

    <p>The second situation is Snake in front of us.</p>

    <p>He was not invaded by the void spirit. Instead, he took the initiative to accept the void. He allowed himself to undergo a complete change starting from his soul and became the void spirit itself.</p>

    <p>Although Keorn has been investigating the virtual spirit for a long time. He has even had some contact with the virtual spirit silently.</p>

    <p>But it is indeed the first time to fight against a virtual spirit.</p>

    <p>Even standing here as a pseudo-True Immortal, he can feel tremendous pressure. Let alone Zhuo Yi?</p>

    <p>"Mr. Zhuo, what are our chances of winning..."</p>

    <p>His instinct was to persuade Zhuo Yi to evacuate.</p>

    <p>Judging from the astonishing pressure brought by Snake, even adding the Golden Core of Zhuo Yi... seems unable to completely turn the tide of the battle.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, Zhuo Yi shouted loudly - "Open the gate!"</p>

    <p>Keorn was shocked when he heard it!</p>

    <p>"Mr. Zhuo?" He turned around in disbelief and looked at Zhuo Yi's live performance in surprise.</p>

    <p>The power of Heavenly Dao...</p>

    <p>At this point, Keorn was completely shocked.</p>

    <p>The expression he showed was exactly the same as Snake's expression when he saw this scene.</p>

    <p>A Golden Core cultivator actually possesses the Heavenly Dao technique. This is simply unbelievable.</p>

    <p>This person from the Office of Strategic Deception... is a complete pervert!</p>

    <p>Is this still a sect composed of humans?</p>

    <p>At this time, Keorn was in a particularly complicated mood.</p>

    <p>Excited, stunned, confused...</p>

    <p>All kinds of emotions are intertwined.</p>

    <p>Although he already knew it in his mind. Zhuo Yi is not a simple character.</p>

    <p>But now, the impression of Zhuo Yi in his mind needs a major update.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Like a landslide and tsunami, a huge amount of spiritual energy surged out from the small Golden Core in Zhuo Yi's body.</p>

    <p>In a short period of time, Zhuo Yi's aura instantly increases!</p>

    <p>The psychic energy of 33 giant reservoirs. Zhuo Yi has only unlocked 6. It has already achieved amazing results.</p>

    <p>Reservoirs are good, but they cannot be liberated all at once.</p>

    <p>Currently, six are released in a single round. This is already the limit of Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>He needs to wait for his body to adapt before proceeding to the next round of unblocking.</p>

    <p>Unlock the 6 reservoirs to improve the realm. It is also the realm of pseudo-True Immortal.</p>

    <p>His fighting power is now as good as Keorn's.</p>

    <p>But if the two of them combined want to beat Snake, it might be a little difficult.</p>

    <p>"Miss Bai Qiao! If I die, no one will test the game for you in the future!"</p>

    <p>At this time. Zhuo Yi shouted into the void: "Don't take action now. Wait until later!"</p>

    <p>The words just fell.</p>

    <p>A brown light lit up from the horizon. It shot straight into the sky!</p>

    <p>Then it quickly turned into a meteor and rushed towards Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>The scabbard of the mahogany sword.</p>

    <p>Previously, Wang Ling also added the name Zhuo Yi to the scabbard in order to better protect Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>But Zhuo Yi has never dared to drive.</p>

    <p>If the situation hadn't been critical at this moment, he would never have dared to disturb this otaku girl playing games in the sect.</p>

    <p>I have to say, Bai Qiao's response was very quick.</p>

    <p>After hearing Zhuo Yi's call, she pressed the "pause" button of the game almost immediately and flew into the palm of Zhuo Yi at a speed exceeding the speed of light.</p>

    <p>"The scabbard of the mahogany sword?" Snake laughed again.</p>

    <p>He had never seen a person's weapon turn out to be a scabbard. Or a scabbard made of mahogany.</p>

    <p>A scabbard like this. He felt like he could turn into ashes just by blowing on it.</p>

    <p>Snake thought that Zhuo Yi would offer something extraordinary.</p>

    <p>However, the result disappointed him.</p>

    <p>"Zhuo Yi. Your show seems to be over. It's my turn."</p>

    <p>In the void. Snake opened his arms. Zhuo Yi could see invisible energy groups that seemed to be gathering in his palms.</p>

    <p>This is an ultra-high-density energy group. The moment Snake condenses it.</p>

    <p>The nearby space could no longer withstand the pressure and began to tear.</p>

    <p>This is a variation of the Devouring Void. Anyone who comes into contact with the energy group will disappear in an instant!</p>

    <p>Swallowed by the void!</p>

    <p>So no matter what Zhuo Yi offers, it won't help anything in Snake's opinion.</p>

    <p>What's more, what was just summoned was a scabbard that looked extremely useless.</p>

    <p>"Zhuo Yi! Climb for me!"</p>

    <p>Snake laughed loudly.</p>

    <p>The next moment, he pushed with both hands. He actually actively stuffed the void energy ball into the space crack.</p>

    <p>It's not as fast as Zhuo Yi can react.</p>

    <p>In the blink of an eye, the two energy balls trapped Zhuo Yi in the center with an outflanking force!</p>

    <p>This is Snake's use of the characteristics of energy groups to devour space, thus achieving an instantaneous effect.</p>

    <p>"Oops!" Keorn's expression changed dramatically.</p>

    <p>No matter how quickly Zhuo Yi reacts, it is impossible to prevent such an encirclement.</p>

    <p>In desperation, Keorn produced a psychic wave in his hand. He wanted to knock Zhuo Yi away!</p>

    <p>To get rid of the encirclement and suppression of the energy group!</p>

    <p>However, Snake's goal is not just Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>"Keorn. Climb for me too!" He sneered and repeated his old trick.</p>

    <p>There were two more void energy groups that could swallow everything, locking Keorn's position.</p>

    <p>This sentence, in Snake's opinion, is a sure win.</p>

    <p>His mission. Actually, is to kill Keorn.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi is just a buy-one-get-one-free gift when you pass by.</p>

    <p>This is the number one important figure in the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Kill Zhuo Yi. He will prove that he is superior to Heavenly Dao! And in this way, he will challenge the entire Office of Strategic Deception!</p>

    <p>Yixue himself was impaled to death by a flying needle in front of the Office of Strategic Deception!</p>

    <p>But at the next moment, an unexpected scene happened.</p>

    <p>When two void energy groups are about to collide together.</p>

    <p>The positions of Zhuo Yi and Keorn suddenly moved backward. They moved several coordinates in an instant!</p>

    <p>The void energy groups collided, making a huge explosion and blasting out two huge space wormholes.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>He finally escaped this disaster.</p>

    <p>Ever since noticing Snake's void-devouring ability, Zhuo Yi has remained fully vigilant.</p>

    <p>So at the moment when Snake condensed the energy group.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi is also ready at the same time!</p>

    <p>He used Bai Qiao to cut off a section of space to achieve the effect of spatial teleportation.</p>

    <p>Now it's his turn to fight back!</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi Take a deep breath.</p>

    <p>He quickly assumed a posture of throwing a javelin in the void, and violently threw Bai Qiao out of his hands!</p>

    <p>This is a blow to Snake's forehead!</p>

    <p>"There's no way I could have fallen in the same place. Zhuo Yi!"</p>

    <p>Facing this blow, Snake looked confident and laughed wildly.</p>

    <p>His body changed with one blow. Any matter that came close to his body would be swallowed up by the void!</p>

    <p>He even took the initiative to stick his head out to meet Bai Qiao's attack!</p>

    <p>He will swallow the entire scabbard!</p>

    <p>And then the next moment.</p>

    <p>Accompanied by. Puff! A sound.</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao turned into a brown stream of light and pierced Snake's forehead again.</p>
