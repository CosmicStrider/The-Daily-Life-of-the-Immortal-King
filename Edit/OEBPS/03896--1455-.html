  <h1>Chapter 1455 Desperate Jiang Yingying</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After Number 60 High School was renovated, Sun Rong expected that transfer students would join.</p>

    <p>So the matter of "pretty account setting" is not just for Jiang Yingying. It is a foreshadowing for the girl to prevent other people...especially other girls from getting close to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has always been the seat in the second to last row by the window.</p>

    <p>There is a corridor to the right. Sitting there is Guo Hao. Sitting in front is Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>Then, all that's left is to guard against the seat behind you.</p>

    <p>It's just that Sun Rong didn't expect that the plan he had devised with his imagination would actually come in handy now.</p>

    <p>On the podium, Jiang Yingying looked a little anxious: "Teacher... just pay for it and that's it!"</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan was a little surprised by this answer: "Classmate Jiang means... Want to buy?"</p>

    <p>Premium seats are not cheap...</p>

    <p>She knew that Jiang Yingying was in front of her. She had always been a frugal girl. She had always implemented Marshal Jiang's style of living in poverty and enjoying morality...</p>

    <p>Buying a pretty account is really not something Jiang Yingying can do.</p>

    <p>"I will buy it no matter how much it costs!"</p>

    <p>"My classmate loves you..."</p>

    <p>As a class teacher.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan has been teaching for so many years. She has seen so many students of all kinds. She can hardly hide what kind of things the students have in their stomachs.</p>

    <p>After seeing Jiang Yingying being so obsessed with the last seat by the window, Teacher Pan understood almost instantly.</p>

    <p>She turned her gaze to the second-to-last row by the window. The mascot was pretending to look out the window to try to hide her embarrassment.</p>

    <p>"Could it be because I admire my classmate Wang Ling? I just came to school. Isn't that..."</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan was murmuring in his heart.</p>

    <p>To be honest, she didn't know why. Wang Ling was so popular with women... She usually had a taciturn look, but she seemed to be particularly popular with girls.</p>

    <p>Could it be because of the sense of mystery that comes from being so taciturn?</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan really doesn't understand the aesthetics of young people nowadays.</p>

    <p>However, she did not dare to speculate on the matter between Jiang Yingying and Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Although the school rules of Number 60 High School do not restrict romance between students, as a traditional and conservative teacher, Teacher Pan will try to eliminate puppy love in the class as much as possible.</p>

    <p>As long as she finds out any signs, she will immediately strangle her to death in the cradle...</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying was actually originally assigned to another class. However, because his personal performance was too good. In addition, Jiang Yingying himself also had the intention to transfer to Class 3.</p>

    <p>Finally, I joined the class of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>I picked up such a top student who can improve my grades for nothing. What if my grades decline due to puppy love? How should I fix it...</p>

    <p>So at this moment, Teacher Pan glanced at the good quotes displayed on his tablet.</p>

    <p>The price of this set of beautiful desks and chairs is: 50,000.</p>

    <p>To be honest, this is not a price that an ordinary student can afford.</p>

    <p>After Teacher Pan thought for a moment, he looked at Jiang Yingying seriously and asked, "Classmate Jiang, are you really sure you want to buy it..."</p>

    <p>"Sure!" The persistent girl still refused to give up this opportunity.</p>

    <p>Although she has never been so lavish with money, she always has some personal savings. During the holidays, there is an endless stream of elders who come to visit Marshal Jiang. They always give her red envelopes with meaning.</p>

    <p>But I am afraid that if the red envelope is too big, I will get into trouble. So the amount of these red envelopes is not very big.</p>

    <p>The accumulation of hundreds and hundreds...</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying currently has about 90,000 yuan in savings.</p>

    <p>If she buys a place, she thinks it's more than enough.</p>

    <p>"So. The cost of 500,000 yuan for a good account. Please tell me, classmate, should Jiang pay by credit card or..." Teacher Pan smiled and looked at Jiang Yingying in front of him.</p>

    <p>"500,000..." Jiang Yingying was dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>Everyone in the class was in an uproar.</p>

    <p>This is true even for Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>To add an extra zero directly to the end of the total... This is outrageous!</p>

    <p>But soon, the smart girl reacted quickly.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid Teacher Pan is trying to put an end to puppy love.</p>

    <p>And. Sun Rong is clear.</p>

    <p>If someone knew about this at this time, they would definitely come out and question her: What happened to you and Wang Ling?</p>

    <p>To this. Sun Rong has already prepared a reply.</p>

    <p>Classmate Wang Ling. Just like a piece of wood!</p>

    <p>So can she call this puppy love...</p>

    <p>It's obviously a secret love and unrequited love!</p>

    <p>Loving someone is really hard!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At this time on the podium, Teacher Pan thought that Jiang Yingying should have given up after he falsely reported the price.</p>

    <p>But what she never expected was that this girl's temper seemed to be more stubborn than she imagined: "Teacher...can you wait for me! I can buy it! But I have to raise some money..."</p>

    <p>500,000 is really a huge amount of money for Jiang Yingying. It is simply unrealistic to raise it in a short time.</p>

    <p>So she thought of borrowing it.</p>

    <p>Who can I ask to borrow it from?</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche. In fact, it is a ready-made object.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying felt that she must be crazy...</p>

    <p>He actually went to ask someone he had just met once to borrow money.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan grabbed Jiang Yingying and said, "Classmate Jiang, please think again... I don't think you need to pursue the prestige seats because it's not cost-effective at all. I know the reason why you insist on sitting in that seat. I'm afraid. It's because classmate Wang Ling is a mascot!"</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling knows. Teacher Pan must have said that on purpose.</p>

    <p>This is for Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>However, at this time, the girl on the podium was in a state of confusion and could not listen at all.</p>

    <p>Her mind was filled with the classic sayings of a product-carrying anchor on a certain website, "Buy it! Buy it!"</p>

    <p>Obviously, Jiang Yingying could no longer calm down at this time: "Teacher, I...I still want to..."</p>

    <p>"Okay then. Classmate Jiang. Since you want to buy it, I won't stop you."</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan let go of Jiang Yingying's hand: "But before you buy the fancy seats, I have to read out some precautions..."</p>

    <p>This section is not a temporary scene added by Teacher Pan. It is already there.</p>

    <p>She is playing hard to get.</p>

    <p>Anyway, Jiang Yingying can't listen now. Why don't you read her the rules of the good seats carefully. Maybe she will calm down?</p>

    <p>"Anything else to note?" Jiang Yingying looked confused.</p>

    <p>"some."</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan nodded and said: "1: After paying the fee, you will automatically get the right to use the premium seats for one year..."</p>

    <p>"It's not permanent?" Jiang Yingying was shocked.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan did not answer Jiang Yingying's words. Instead, he directly read the second item: "Two: If you want to obtain permanent use rights, you need to apply for a membership card with a good number first."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"The membership card fee is 10,000 per year. If automatic renewal is enabled, the annual fee is 9,500. Note: If three years of membership fees are paid before graduation, this set of beautiful chairs can be delivered to your home by the school after graduation. Enjoy it forever. Use it. Or put it in the school history exhibition hall by the owner of the chair. And write your name on the back of the chair."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Three: If you have a good seat and a membership at the same time, the following additional privileges will be unlocked. 1. Daily morning call service for the class teacher. 2. Advance notification service before contacting parents. 3. Additional free homework tutoring service. 4. If on campus been subjected to school violence. You can always get a copy of the Continuous P.E. teacher's home.."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Remarks: Gold membership card and diamond membership card privilege services will be launched in the future. Please stay tuned."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Four: Users who purchase premium seats for the first time will receive 1 ton of {immortal secret scrolls} for free..."</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan has just read the fourth item. Jiang Yingying's face is full of despair: "Teacher...I don't buy it..."</p>

    <p>"OK."</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan showed a satisfied smile: "Then, you can sit here by the door, behind classmate Gu Shunzhi."</p>

    <p>"Can't it be done behind classmate Guo Hao..."</p>

    <p>"That one is also a pretty one."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
