  <h1>Chapter 1886 She is anxious! She is anxious!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Under the meaningful gazes of everyone, Sun Rong's face became even more rosy. To be honest, even she herself did not expect that she would put forward such bold and constructive opinions.</p>

    <p>Eh... In short, anyone can propose marriage! Emperor Dongda is not allowed to go! Even if Emperor Dongda uses his own body, after all, there are Wang Ling and Wang Ying in his body! Sun Rong feels like this A little weird!</p>

    <p>She believes that her behavior can be regarded as a righteous act. It is not just for her own selfishness. In fact, it is also for Sun Ying'er...</p>

    <p>These two shadows kept coming and going. They were about to accomplish something. How could a key node be messed up by something like this?</p>

    <p>Well. That's right! The opinions she puts forward now are generally for the happiness of Sun Ying'er and Wang Ying!</p>

    <p>It has nothing to do with herself!</p>

    <p>No!</p>

    <p>"Why do I feel that my wife's words are a little anxious?"</p>

    <p>"Nonsense! Where is it!" Sun Rong got even hotter after being said. Then he looked around and looked at everyone: "Am I in a hurry? Am I in a hurry? Do I look... in a hurry?"</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi patted her shoulder. He sighed: "Don't call me a good disciple. I seem to be a little bit..."</p>

    <p>You Yueqing also nodded: "Yeah. It's a bit urgent."</p>

    <p>Seeing the meaningful looks in the eyes of the people around him, Sun Rong took a few deep breaths and tried to regain his composure: "Okay... even if I am a little impatient. But this is also for the sake of returning the historical trajectory to the right path. This It's for the sake of all cultivators. It's normal!"</p>

    <p>"Master's Wife is indeed a Master's Wife. She can stick to the righteousness of cultivators under such circumstances. We admire her greatly." Hearing this, Zhuo Yi raised the corners of his mouth slightly. He couldn't bear to continue to lead everyone in teasing Sun Rong. Anyway, everyone present has a clear idea of what Sun Rong's anxious action means.</p>

    <p>The only thing that doesn't understand Feng Qing is that the man who still can't see his expression until now is the man with a paralyzed face hiding in Dongda's body.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling originally did not intend to let Sun Rong go. After all, the Book of Nine Realms is a hot potato in the current situation. Even in the hands of Emperor Dong, it may not be safe. What's more, it has been transferred to In the hands of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling changed his mind and felt that it might be smoother to leave this matter to Sun Rong. Anyway, the current historical trajectory is messed up. Even if Sun Rong summons Aohai, it will be smoother. It doesn't matter. We really encountered an emergency. With Aohai's body-protecting sword body at hand, the few pieces of material from the Peng family Wang Ling felt that they were no match for the nine-core Aohai.</p>

    <p>Of course, there is a more important reason. Wang Ling thinks that girls will understand girls' thoughts better. The men proposed marriage unexpectedly, which would appear very abrupt.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's thoughts are relatively delicate. Maybe it will make the whole thing look smoother.</p>

    <p>The plan was finalized. Sun Rong breathed a sigh of relief. Liu Qingyi and You Yueqing helped to refine Sun Rong inside and out. Mainly focusing on the skin color and facial features, eyebrows and eyes. Some changes were made to give the originally smooth and delicate face a profile that was more masculine.</p>

    <p>I didn't make any big changes to my hairstyle. I just adjusted the length to let the green silk black hair fall down naturally. Then I made some embellishments on the bangs on both sides with the forehead as the center line. All of a sudden it was Sun Rong was adjusted into a handsome and handsome man.</p>

    <p>When everyone saw Sun Rong coming out of the room wearing the pure white hanfu, everyone couldn't take their eyes away. Her foundation was already very good. Even after being dressed as a man, The decoration is also amazing.</p>

    <p>Even Emperor Dongda was surprised. Such a face, whether male or female, can be called an immortal. Even if there are countless handsome men and beautiful women in the palaces of the four emperors, they can't find such a person who makes people first. After looking at it, I can't take my eyes away.</p>

    <p>In fact, cross-dressing is the best way to see whether a person is good or not. It is true that beauty is in the bones but not in the skin.</p>

    <p>"It's feasible! I think it's completely feasible! Bring the Book of Nine Realms and the betrothal gift to propose marriage. I guarantee that Peng Beicen will like you at first sight." For some reason, Zhuo Yi suddenly felt a little excited.</p>

    <p>After everyone made a plan for the marriage proposal, they were quickly led by the core members of the Office of Strategic Deception who played the four emperors and Liu Muchen's Zhuo Yi. A dragnet was set up to prepare for the subsequent marriage proposal.</p>

    <p>Although it is just acting, it is actually fishing. Since you want to catch fish, all preparations must be done. The team for proposing marriage must be luxurious. It cannot be lower than the standard of the nine-star royal family in the eternal cultivation world.</p>

    <p>And the marriage proposal team must be densely populated with experts. According to the lowest realm standard, it must be Dao God level!</p>

    <p>Dinghai Pearl, Sky Jade, Eight Desolate Rulers, Nine-faced Lion's Heart...a dazzling array of magic weapons, heavenly materials and earthly treasures. Listed in a long list, you can't even see the end with your eyes.</p>

    <p>This is a marriage proposal list compiled from the treasures in the four imperial palaces. Everything is so precious that it can make cultivators in the world go crazy.</p>

    <p>However, now these things will become betrothal gifts to the Peng family to propose marriage. It has to make people feel sad.</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda was so ashamed: "Is this too much preparation..."</p>

    <p>"It's just a show. Why don't you worry, Emperor Dong." Xiang Yi laughed: "This thing isn't ours anyway. Don't worry too much."</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda was speechless: "..."</p>

    <p>What he said was so reasonable that he was speechless for a moment.</p>

    <p>The next step in their journey is to go directly to the Peng family's headquarters. If it hadn't been for the four emperors' secret meeting to put together the information this time, perhaps no one would have known that the Peng family's power had spread across the four major regions. And the reason why the Peng family set up the headquarters in Within the Central Galaxy.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, it is for the convenience of trade. On the other hand, it is also possible to use this intermediate position to control the forces in the four domains. It is convenient for you to distribute the Peng family's informants among the major domains.</p>

    <p>Although the four emperors had sent intelligence personnel to investigate the Peng family before, the information obtained was limited after all. The universe is so big that the detection of information cannot be too obvious. What's more, this information is not public.</p>

    <p>Even before this secret meeting, Emperor Dongda had already judged that the Peng family's power network over the years had probably expanded to an unimaginable level. However, when they marked the distribution of the Peng family's major forces as asterisks on the same map. Still couldn't help but be shocked.</p>

    <p>Seeing the stars all over the map made Emperor Dongda's pupils tremble.</p>

    <p>"It seems that the Peng family's ambitions are not small. I'm afraid they also have compassion for the throne." Wang Ying said.</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda was also worried about this: "The Peng family is too terrible. Collaborating with the old world... we will never let them gain power. I wonder if we can take this opportunity to suppress them."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying nodded: "This is natural. The original weakening of the Peng family's power was also within the scope of our plan. Wasn't it?"</p>
