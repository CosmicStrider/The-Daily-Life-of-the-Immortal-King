  <h1>Chapter 2166 Pill Assassin</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website:. !</p>

    <p>According to Mr. Zanghu's original drug store expansion plan, he could directly absorb all the drug stores in small and medium-sized towns in a short period of time, and acquire NPC drug stores as his own with high-quality and low-price elixirs.</p>

    <p>Then, he will attract more NPC players to join the team through the drug store's publicity. He will develop and produce the elixir here. As long as the elixir formula is kept top-secret, this is a business that you can count on while lying down.</p>

    <p>It is equivalent to saying that other players join Mr. Zanghu's pharmacy. It is equivalent to opening an offline drug sales channel. Mr. Zanghu can earn franchise fees and a share of the sales of elixirs.</p>

    <p>As for whether the quality of the medicines is excellent, Mr. Zanghu will be responsible for all the entrances here.</p>

    <p>This is just a game. There are usually no drug safety issues. For the other players, as long as Mr. Zanghu can provide a stable supply, it is a win-win deal.</p>

    <p>But after the demand increases, how to increase the production is also a big problem. If players are hired to participate, the formula of the elixir is likely to be leaked.</p>

    <p>So Mr. Zanghu's idea is to hire a large number of NPCs to refine elixirs for him.</p>

    <p>This directly solves the problem of production capacity.</p>

    <p>Originally, everything was developing in an orderly manner according to Mr. Zanghu's plan.</p>

    <p>Until Mr. Zanghu went to a drug store in a medium-sized town to do some research. He was suddenly shocked to find that there was a level 4 elixir worth 5 million taels of silver openly displayed in the drug store in this medium-sized town.</p>

    <p>"A level four elixir...5 million taels?"</p>

    <p>Mr. Zanghu frowned.</p>

    <p>This is also an elixir independently produced by the player. Generally speaking, the market price of a level 4 elixir in the world of Itinerant Immortal is usually 1 million.</p>

    <p>Unless the material is particularly rare, there may be a double premium.</p>

    <p>Take this level 4 elixir worth 5 million. Mr. Zanghu carefully checked the information on this elixir.</p>

    <p>Name: Immortal Dragon Blood Pills</p>

    <p>Quality: Level 4</p>

    <p>Rarity:★★★★</p>

    <p>Function: After taking it, all attributes can be temporarily increased by 25 points. It lasts for 24 hours. This temporary attribute bonus will be effective for the copy and the player's PK at the same time. At the same time, a special halo of "Reflection of Light" will be obtained.</p>

    <p>Note: In the special state of "Returning to Light", when your character encounters a fatal blow, he will not die directly. Instead, he will be locked in the state of 1 drop of blood. At the same time, when the "Returning to Light" state is in effect, the body will be cleared. All abnormal conditions.</p>

    <p>To be honest, the effectiveness of elixirs cannot be said to be top-notch.</p>

    <p>Some of Mr. Zanghu's existing elixirs also have such special properties. However, the probability of them coming out is relatively low.</p>

    <p>So 5 million pieces. In Mr. Zanghu's opinion, it's a bit outrageous.</p>

    <p>And he discovered this when he was checking out.</p>

    <p>"This gentleman looks very similar to Tibetan Fox. Excuse me...do you want to buy it?" The clerk looked at Mr. Tibetan Fox politely and said.</p>

    <p>This is what Mr. Zanghu thinks is most outrageous.</p>

    <p>Because it is for market research. Usually when a new map arrives, Mr. Zanghu will buy all the elixirs in this pharmacy at once. Do a price survey.</p>

    <p>As a result, I never expected that when choosing the elixir, the price of the 5 million Gui Immortal Dragon Blood Pill was actually hidden!</p>

    <p>It wasn't until he noticed the astronomical figures on the bill when he was paying the bill that he realized he had been stabbed in the back!</p>

    <p>There is no doubt despair on Mr. Zanghu's face...</p>

    <p>He had only heard of the Ice Cream Assassin.</p>

    <p>But I have never heard of the Pill Assassin.</p>

    <p>In the real world, daily necessities like elixirs must have strict production qualifications. They must be strictly controlled from production to sales. Most of the elixirs that can be purchased on the market have clearly marked prices. Even if prices fluctuate in different places, usually It will not exceed 3 yuan of Huaxiu coins.</p>

    <p>Oh...</p>

    <p>This is a game.</p>

    <p>That's okay.</p>

    <p>I can only say that the person who can use the Ice Cream Assassin routine to sell elixirs in the game is indeed a talent.</p>

    <p>And their sales model is clearly targeted at users. They basically only target players with money or new players who don't understand it at all.</p>

    <p>The raw materials may not be real. Although it is rare, it is not that rare. Therefore, the value of one pill is 5 million. More of the 4 million in it comes from the story of the elixir itself.</p>

    <p>Use content marketing to open up customers' minds and make buyers feel that the elixir they purchased is worth the money.</p>

    <p>So essentially.</p>

    <p>What I bought here was not only the elixir, but also a touching little story...</p>

    <p>This really clears up the process of paying for content!</p>

    <p>He glanced at the clerk in front of him with a look of disdain in his eyes. It was obvious that this clerk had undergone a considerable degree of training.</p>

    <p>Mr. Zanghu probably knows a little bit about this type of routine.</p>

    <p>Usually when they hesitate to pay, these clerks will put on a scornful face and use micro-expressions or indifferent yin and yang remarks to stimulate your purchase.</p>

    <p>But Mr. Zanghu is a veteran. As a walking encyclopedia of the world of cultivation, Mr. Zanghu's experience is not limited to books. He also has rich social experience.</p>

    <p>He would not be fooled by the clerk's glare. In the end, he removed the elixir assassin directly from the shopping cart and left.</p>

    <p>Although the existence of Pill Assassin targets the mid-to-high-end market, there is no obvious conflict with Mr. Zanghu's current layout. But in the future, when Mr. Zanghu wants to enter the high-end market, it will seem a bit awkward to enter this part of the market. It's too late.</p>

    <p>And in Mr. Zanghu's view, if you want to make elixirs high-end, you absolutely cannot rely on simple stories.</p>

    <p>He needs to really make the elixir high-end. Make this elixir worthwhile and gain recognition from mainstream players.</p>

    <p>In addition to using top-quality raw materials, the method of refining elixirs must also be updated.</p>

    <p>Traditional alchemy uses alchemy furnaces. The alchemy furnace rooms in modern cultivation societies are all combined with high-tech equipment and networked big data. All the medicinal materials added are accurate to the milligram. Even the temperature is precisely controlled by modern technology. This makes The quality of elixirs has been stabilized and standardized.</p>

    <p>However, under this standardized model, the elixirs produced are naturally standardized elixirs. In ancient times, monks used the same formula to refine elixirs. www.uukanshu.net The elixirs produced have different characteristics. This is based on nature. The addition of force gives the elixir other additional properties.</p>

    <p>Take Mr. Zanghu's alchemy refining in the wild as an example. He uses the most primitive pots and pans. The success rate is not as good as that achieved with regular elixirs. The advantage is that he can stably refine some specific elixirs.</p>

    <p>At this time.</p>

    <p>Mr. Zanghu opened the game map.</p>

    <p>He had a very bold idea in his heart.</p>

    <p>There are thousands of ways to make elixirs. But if there is any way that can greatly increase the value of elixirs and maximize the specificity of elixirs... Mr. Yi Zanghu's personal experience can only think of one.</p>

    <p>He needs to find an active volcano!</p>

    <p>Yes!</p>

    <p>Volcano alchemy!</p>

    <p>He will use the active volcano as an alchemy furnace to refine the elixir!</p>
