  <h1>Chapter 1725 Invisible Invasion</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Just as Wang Ming and Shou Chong were preparing to launch a mighty counterattack, Wang Ling was thinking about Wang Ming. Without sacrificing Wang Ming, it seemed that besides believing that Wang Ming could come out on his own and Other than waiting, there is no other option for the time being.</p>

    <p>Master Wu Xin and the mother body of the Thought Plague jointly invaded Wang Ming's body. Wang Ling felt that if he intervened forcefully, he would definitely alert the other party and cause the other party to deal with it.</p>

    <p>When the time comes, those with the thought plague will probably escape directly. And a cunning Eternal like Master Wu Xin, once it is confirmed that he has no chance of survival, will most likely resort to self-destruction, destroying all that mental space.</p>

    <p>So. What should we do...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was thinking about various plans. When he found that no matter which path he took, it seemed to be unworkable, he began to feel a little irritable in his heart.</p>

    <p>Then, this sudden irritability was like a mud cow sinking into the sea. It was swallowed up completely by a mysterious force. Wang Ling turned into the calm Wang Ling again.</p>

    <p>The one who always looks expressionless. Wang Ling who faces everything as if he were calm.</p>

    <p>The phenomenon of emotional devouring has occurred more than once. Wang Ming had clearly told him before. This was Talisman's cause.</p>

    <p>Because sealing Talisman suppresses his spiritual power, it will also suppress his mood to a certain extent. Because spiritual power changes with the rise of certain emotions.</p>

    <p>For example, when Wang Ling feels irritable and angry, his psychic energy will reach an abnormal value. Therefore, it is also important to suppress emotions.</p>

    <p>However, because the current version of the sealed Talisman cannot accurately position to suppress a certain emotion, basically Wang Ling is faced with a "one size fits all" situation.</p>

    <p>Any emotion. As soon as Wang Ling starts to react, it will be quickly suppressed.</p>

    <p>Over the years. It's been like this every time.</p>

    <p>From Wang Ling's initial discomfort to the current numbness, no one knows the bitterness in the middle...so that until now, he no longer even feels that bitterness.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling often feels as if he is trapped in a prison. No matter how he shouts, no one can hear his voice.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling?"</p>

    <p>At this time, the girl's familiar voice came, waking up Wang Ling who had just suppressed his irritability.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "Huh?"</p>

    <p>Because it's in my own body...well, to be precise. It's in my own sword spirit space.</p>

    <p>She could clearly feel that Wang Ling seemed a little different now than before. However, the expression on his face never changed. So she was a little worried. And sincerely hoped that she could be of help.</p>

    <p>"I heard Sister Zhai Yin say before that the world of spiritual space is a sea. The more active a person's thinking, the wider the size of the sea. Is this true?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"Yes." Wang Ling replied. Cherishing words like gold.</p>

    <p>"If that's the case, then I think I can give it a try?" Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>Now Aohai. is already a genuine nine-core spirit sword! It also incorporates the existence of nine Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cubes! The overall ability of the spirit sword has been greatly improved!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong just had a brief spiritual communication with Aohai.</p>

    <p>Theoretically, with Aohai's current capabilities, it can currently be directly linked to all major sea areas in the universe.</p>

    <p>Since the spiritual space is an ocean, then maybe it can be linked in quietly.</p>

    <p>It's just that Aohai has never tried such an operation before. I don't know if it is possible.</p>

    <p>This proposal made Wang Ling's eyes light up. He didn't expect that at such a critical moment, Sun Rong could directly propose a feasible solution.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, Aohai, as a veritable nine-core spiritual sword, has actually mastered the essence of "Sea King." If Aohai's sword spirit space search is used to link to the sea of Wang Ming's spiritual world, it is indeed a silent method!</p>

    <p>Wang Ming's spiritual sea is already vast and boundless. No one would care if an extra seawater mixes in. Besides, Aohai is a spiritual sword that can directly control the power of the sea.</p>

    <p>In such an environment, it can play an excellent cover-up role. That is - home field advantage! "I think Ms. Rong's plan is feasible!" Wang Ying nodded. He thought this was a way. Because it can be done quietly. Invasion. Will not make the other party suspicious.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that when Sun Rong and Aohai successfully enter the sea of spirits, they can provide a huge boost to Wang Ming. They can use the backhand at the most critical moment to give Master Wu Xin and the mother body of the Thought Plague the last chance. Attack! Regain body sovereignty!</p>

    <p>"If both Ling Zhenren and Mr. Ying think it's feasible, then I'll help too! Combined with the power of the soul index I have... I believe I can help Miss Rong and Miss Aohai quickly locate the sea of spiritual space of Mr. Wang Ming." Death Heavenly Dao said.</p>

    <p>At this time, the arrow was on the string and had to be fired.</p>

    <p>Everyone knows it. It's a race against time.</p>

    <p>After making up her mind, Sun Rong and Aohai reacted very quickly. She quickly closed her eyes and completely immersed herself in her thoughts. In conjunction with the coquettish dance of the soul index of Death Heavenly Dao, she began to combine human swords. One's passive ability. Search the sea of spiritual space.</p>

    <p>When Aohai's sword energy drew a blue circle on the floor of Sun Rong's room, an infinite aura of the sea was instantly released from the circle. There was a blue sword energy like a compass. Guide Sun Rong and Aohai to find Wang Ming's location...</p>

    <p>"Successful..." Death Heavenly Dao was excited. Unexpectedly, Aohai could really connect to the sea of spiritual space: "Next, as long as Miss Rong jumps down, you can find it by following the guidance of this blue sword energy. Mr. Ming's position! And this... is the legendary... Azur Lane!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Wang Ying: "..."</p>

    <p>"I will try my best!" At this time, Sun Rong took a deep breath. She jumped in with almost no hesitation.</p>

    <p>The moment she jumped into the light circle, she changed her clothes instantly like the goddess of the sea. She put on Aohai's gorgeous turquoise dress. The white waves at the hem of the skirt swayed in the wind. In a short moment, she could see Wang Ling slightly absent-minded.</p>

    <p>But that was only for a moment. Wang Ling's thoughts became calm again.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ming and Shou Chong were still on the ghost ship collecting materials for making giant mechas. The whole process was more troublesome than the two imagined.</p>

    <p>Wearing humanoid mechas, they were salvaging things on the sea. At this moment, an area suddenly boiled on the surface of the Abandoned Sea.</p>

    <p>"What is that?" Shou Chong was stunned immediately and called Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>When the boiling seawater turned into gorgeous foam and rose from the sea surface, it only took a moment. Sun Rong suddenly revealed her figure: "Brother Wang Ming!"</p>

    <p>The familiar voice suddenly aroused Wang Ming's thoughts. Then he became surprised: "It turns out to be you. Rongrong!"</p>

    <p>Shou Chong was also shocked: "Miss Sun Rong. It's you? Why are you here?"</p>

    <p>"I'm here to help you!" Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"OK!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming stared at Sun Rong. He couldn't help but praise: "She is indeed my appointed sister-in-law! She can even come in here!"</p>

    <p>At this time, the sea water was boiling even more.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong flushed: "Senior Shou Chong, don't listen to his nonsense...I. I am not..."</p>
