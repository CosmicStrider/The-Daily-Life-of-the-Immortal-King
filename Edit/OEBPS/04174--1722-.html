  <h1>Chapter 1722 The secret backlash</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling knows. Everything in front of him began with Bai Zhe's revenge on himself. Back then, he destroyed Bai Zhe in all world lines and timelines, completely erasing his existence. But now he will face what he will face. The solution is surprisingly similar to the original one.</p>

    <p>If the method of complete destruction is really replicated, then the more than 1.7 million death talismans in Wang Ling's hands may not be enough. The world line and timeline are a huge volume.</p>

    <p>As an independent individual, the number of each person allocated in the parallel space ranges from tens of millions to hundreds of millions.</p>

    <p>In a person's normal process, whenever you are entangled with something or encounter some difficult-to-decision issues, a new world line and timeline will be split.</p>

    <p>Over time, these divided world lines and timelines will become more and more numerous through the accumulation of time.</p>

    <p>It can be said that there are truly three things in life. Three things give rise to all things...</p>

    <p>Let's use an analogy.</p>

    <p>Today, a certain author was debating whether to update 2,000 words or 20,000 words.</p>

    <p>This author has already split off a new world line and added himself in a parallel space.</p>

    <p>Then the split author will also think and make decisions in the subsequent growth process, thereby realizing the split again...</p>

    <p>So according to this theory, the most terrifying people are those who have "difficulty choosing" because they have too many choices. When they are often unable to make a decision, they will suddenly split into countless individuals. In the end, the parallel space owned by one person Possibly as many as hundreds of millions, or even billions.</p>

    <p>The number of parallel spaces owned by Wang Ming may be comparable to this. Perhaps even worse.</p>

    <p>"Brain deduction" allows Wang Ming to regularly explore various options. After calculations in his brain, he finally reaches the optimal choice. In fact, this process is also a process that intensifies the splitting of parallel spaces.</p>

    <p>Therefore, if you want to completely erase Wang Ming from this universe, destroy the parent body parasitizing in his body, and then resurrect Wang Ming in all parallel spaces.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling estimates. I need to prepare at least 10 billion death talismans on my hands.</p>

    <p>However, even if we work overtime to make this equivalent of a death talisman... I am afraid it will be difficult to achieve it in a short period of time.</p>

    <p>So. What to do?</p>

    <p>But now, in order to ensure that the thought plague can be completely eliminated, this seems to be the only way.</p>

    <p>"This is a doomed defeat. There is no way you can win against Master Sotos and Mr. Bai."</p>

    <p>At this moment, Number 003 suddenly let out a burst of sarcastic laughter: "Human beings are creatures with complicated emotions. If you can't let go of your emotions, you will never become stronger..."</p>

    <p>Emotion?</p>

    <p>With this, wake up Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Originally he thought he was a creature without emotions.</p>

    <p>All the time, he would not show too many emotional fluctuations in anything.</p>

    <p>But now. Just now, he is still thinking about whether there are other alternative solutions.</p>

    <p>So. Is he also an emotional person?</p>

    <p>In the Sword Spirit space, Wang Ling sat down cross-legged looking a little absent-minded. He quietly stared at the thought plaguers suppressed in his palms.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling What's wrong with him?" Sun Rong could see Wang Ling's confusion at this time.</p>

    <p>This expression is based on the notes in her notebook. When Wang Ling stares at something in a daze, it usually means "confusion" about something. Just like Wang Ling's normal exam I often wonder how many points my average score should be.</p>

    <p>"It's okay. It's just the normal reverie of a High School boy." Wang Ying sighed: "There are not enough death talismans now. If Brother Ming is completely wiped out, the risk of being spread by the thought plague may be eliminated. But Mr. Ming will also Cease to exist."</p>

    <p>"Is there no other way?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"We can only wait and see. If Mr. Ming has the ability to regain control of his body, it won't be so troublesome.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ying said: "But the opponent is Master Wu Xin. Such a strong man who relies on his brainpower to make a living. Even though he is injured, it is not easy for Mr. Ming to contend with him." Death Heavenly Dao frowned and said: "But this This matter cannot be delayed any longer. Now we are in a race against time. The longer we delay, the wider the scope of the thought plague will spread."</p>

    <p>"There will always be a way."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying spread his hands and said helplessly: "If it doesn't work out, I have no choice but to surrender to Mr. Ming. Even if I can't keep all Mr. Ming in the parallel dimension, at least I can save a small part of them..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Deep in the spiritual space is a sea swept by a storm. The shocking waves beat an ancient ghost ship ups and downs in the waves.</p>

    <p>It had completely lost its course. It was drifting with the current on this ocean full of murderous intentions and storms. With the constant shaking in the cabin, Wang Ming's consciousness gradually woke up.</p>

    <p>"Damn..." He rubbed his head with a headache. Then he crashed into the wooden wall of the cabin due to severe imbalance. Heavy rain poured in, soaking all his clothes.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming knew that the control of his body no longer belonged to him. At the same time, he did not expect that the virus planted by Master Wu Xin in cooperation with the thought plague would be so arrogant.</p>

    <p>He grabbed the mast and wandered on the rough sea for an unknown amount of time until the sea finally calmed down.</p>

    <p>"We have to find a way to regain control." Wang Ming whispered silently. He had not given up thinking yet.</p>

    <p>The last time he was trapped in the spiritual space was during the journey to the Beast King's ruins. He and the Ghost Head Sword fell into the spiritual space together. Then they spliced together a part of it with the help of the scraps floating on the surface of the spiritual ocean. Mecha. Suppressed the Ghost Blade and successfully escaped.</p>

    <p>When it comes to escape operations, Wang Ming is already very familiar with them.</p>

    <p>But obviously, this time the escape is more difficult than the last time.</p>

    <p>The storm dissipated. The sea was filled with fog. It was difficult to see the direction clearly.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming clearly knows that the ghost ship he is currently in is not the original ship in his mental space.</p>

    <p>There is a sea like this in everyone's spiritual space. The main body that controls the spiritual space plays the role of captain. And Wang Ming's original ship was a giant aircraft carrier the size of fifty aircraft carriers.</p>

    <p>But now, he has apparently been exiled. The giant aircraft carrier has changed hands. Master Wu Xin has become the new helmsman.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ming gritted his teeth and began to search for the cockpit in this ghost ship. He planned to use his own power to return to the original giant aircraft carrier.</p>

    <p>And the moment he opened the cockpit door, a slightly embarrassed figure suddenly staggered out of the door and threw himself into Wang Ming's arms.</p>

    <p>"Is it you?" Wang Ming didn't expect that he would be here, meeting Shou Chong...</p>

    <p>It seems.</p>

    <p>They were exiled together...</p>
