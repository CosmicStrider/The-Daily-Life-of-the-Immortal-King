  <h1>Chapter 1555: I'll take care of myself three times a day</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The so-called knowing yourself and your enemy means you will be victorious in any battle. In order to truly capture the weakness of Houlang Sang, Moriyama Kaede investigated many things for this purpose.</p>

    <p>Although many things are rumors on the Internet, their authenticity is uncertain.</p>

    <p>But if you have the right to say something, everyone's opinion will win gold.</p>

    <p>As long as all these rumors are listed and confirmed based on the comprehensive search rate and the witnesses found, you can basically make a judgment on the authenticity of the information.</p>

    <p>However, just before the upper class student exchange meeting started today, Moriyama Kaede wanted to summarize the information.</p>

    <p>Something very strange happened.</p>

    <p>That's all the information he investigated about Houlang Sang. All disappeared!</p>

    <p>And before the meeting started, he couldn't remember anything about Houlang Sang... his memory was a chaotic mosaic like paste.</p>

    <p>What a hell...</p>

    <p>In desperation, Moriyama Kaede had no choice but to focus on the information of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>According to the collected information, Sun Rong has a favorable impression of Houlang Sang.</p>

    <p>Moriyama Kaede thought he could make a big fuss about this at the exchange meeting.</p>

    <p>All we need is to stop that Houlang Sang from coming to power.</p>

    <p>In this regard, he felt that he could find inspiration from the recently circulated stories about {Dragon King's Son-in-law} and the "Crooked-mouthed God of War."</p>

    <p>Houlang Sang. An ordinary kid whose family is not rich. And he has no talent.</p>

    <p>So many people in their Jiudaohe Class S have already entered the Golden Core realm in their freshman year of high school.</p>

    <p>What do you use to show off your power during the Foundation Building period?</p>

    <p>In the post bar of Jiudaohe High School. Moriyama Kaede has arranged for some people from the Purple Maple Club to organize posts.</p>

    <p>"Why is a poor Houlang favored by a rich woman? Do you think you are the Shura Dragon King?"</p>

    <p>"How to be a pretty girl to attract a rich woman to take care of you. With this method, you will have no worries for the rest of your life!"</p>

    <p>"You can also participate in the upper-class student exchange meeting in District S during the Foundation Building period? I have never seen such a shameless person."</p>

    <p>"Epic shame! Jiudaohe High School is the best in the world in Sun Island. They actually allow foreign players to join the delegation! Are you worthy?"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>These very headline-grabbing posts were all planned and thought up by Moriyama Kaede.</p>

    <p>It's a pity that if it weren't for the urgent time, he felt that the effect of shooting that kind of advertisement would be good.</p>

    <p>With these posts and this exchange meeting, everyone must bring a magic weapon.</p>

    <p>Moriyama Kaede wanted to see what Wang Ling would come up with.</p>

    <p>He was happily waiting for the exchange meeting to begin. He was just waiting to see Wang Ling make a fool of himself.</p>

    <p>As a result, the scene in front of him made Moriyama Kaede completely confused.</p>

    <p>"No...did I lose my memory? I shouldn't have lost my memory? Then Sun Rong obviously likes that Houlang Sang...why are they hugging that guy named Wang Xiaoer..."</p>

    <p>Moriyama Kaede felt like she was not feeling well.</p>

    <p>"President. What should we do now?"</p>

    <p>The others also felt at a loss when they saw this scene.</p>

    <p>"Don't panic."</p>

    <p>Moriyama Kaede pretended to be calm.</p>

    <p>In fact, he himself doesn't quite know what to do...</p>

    <p>But now that the plan has been set, it's too late to modify it.</p>

    <p>We can only take things step by step first. Continue to act according to the original plan.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>About a few minutes later, Number 60 High SchoolWang Ling and others entered the tree house under the leadership of Jisaki.</p>

    <p>The living room in the tree house is very spacious. It has been rearranged to accommodate the exchange meeting.</p>

    <p>The long dining tables are spliced together. They are divided into three rows inside. Each row of tables has exquisite local cuisine, desserts and drinks from Sun Island.</p>

    <p>These are all cultivation foods.</p>

    <p>As soon as Wang Ling entered the door, the originally noisy scene immediately became quieter. Many people turned their eyes towards Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>After a few seconds of silence, whispering began to sound nearby.</p>

    <p>Most people are actually discussing Wang Ling based on the marketing-style posts posted by "Moriyama Kaede."</p>

    <p>The Jiudaohe delegation allowed an outsider to join the delegation. This matter, under the leadership of Moriyama Kaede, did cause dissatisfaction among some students in District S.</p>

    <p>The most important thing is that the joining of Wang Ling was approved by the student union.</p>

    <p>Moriyama Kaede arranged such a big game.</p>

    <p>Looks like a retaliatory move against Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>But the real purpose is actually to go to the Jiudaohe Student Union.</p>

    <p>As long as they work well this time and pull down the popular student council president Jisaki, the rest of Jiudaohe High School will be under the control of their Rainbow Seven Gang.</p>

    <p>In fact, Jisaki and Ma Jiao have already known this conspiracy clearly.</p>

    <p>The moment I saw Moriyama Kaede.</p>

    <p>Jisaki and Moriyama Kaede looked at each other from afar.</p>

    <p>His seemingly calm expression was actually filled with undercurrents.</p>

    <p>"Jisaki! This time. I will definitely bring you down!"</p>

    <p>"Moriyama Kaede! This time. I will make you a disciple!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>The two people's eyes met. They conveyed their thoughts to each other.</p>

    <p>Let Wang Ling on the side hear it clearly.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling knows. The messages Jisaki sent were actually aimed at the student union.</p>

    <p>In the eyes of the other party, he is just a cannon fodder that can be used.</p>

    <p>This kind of child-like behavior. Wang Ling actually didn't take it to heart.</p>

    <p>Even a bratty kid who lacks education has a chance to turn over a new leaf...</p>

    <p>Let's see how bad Tang Jingze was in Number 59 High School. At first, he was just crazy about targeting him.</p>

    <p>And now. It is said that they have all joined Gray Cult...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling actually does not reject this behavior of the Gray Cult Supporters Association.</p>

    <p>It was because of a {substitute} essay written by Crisp Noodles that he was packaged into a little genius of writing essays by some combination of circumstances.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thinks this is a point that can be exploited.</p>

    <p>At least it can divert some people's attention.</p>

    <p>Let those people stop focusing on his true combat power.</p>

    <p>The so-called useless person is a scholar.</p>

    <p>And what Wang Ling's essay blessed Wang Ling was such a weak "jade-faced scholar" skin.</p>

    <p>On the contrary, it will make him more inconspicuous.</p>

    <p>The people in Gray Cult's support club are relatively well-educated and can help him cover.</p>

    <p>The main thing is that the leader is Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>This makes Wang Ling feel extremely at ease.</p>

    <p>As for online, that is, those fake posts on the Internet. Wang Ling didn't take it to heart.</p>

    <p>There is no need for Wang Ming to deal with this matter now.</p>

    <p>Ma Jiao can do it by herself.</p>

    <p>Now Wang Ming has used Old V's identity as the leading hacker circle to accept Ma Jiao as his disciple.</p>

    <p>All situations on Ma Jiao's side are currently under single-handed control by Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>So. Moriyama Kaede arranged this game. Who is the real winner in the end... It is actually already obvious.</p>

    <p>What's more, now in the Rainbow Seven Gang, there is also Lan Mao, the newly wooed Lan Yanhui president from Ohno Dankaede, who is acting as a mole...</p>

    <p>It is said that after Lan Mao joined the religion, he secretly won over several other presidents.</p>

    <p>In other words. Now if Sun Rong stands up as the leader of Gray Cult, he will shout "The Rainbow Seven Sons Gang will be disbanded on the spot."</p>

    <p>Maybe the entire venue.</p>

    <p>Only Moriyama Kaede is left...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Therefore. Facing the menacing Moriyama Kaede. Wang Ling's performance was particularly calm.</p>

    <p>And when Wang Ling entered the venue, he saw the doubtful looks in the eyes of many people around him.</p>

    <p>In the air, the BGM of "Children, do you have many question marks" seems to be faintly seeping out.</p>

    <p>Only then did Zhai Yin remember that the role he was playing now was Sun Rong!</p>

    <p>And she actually just hugged Wang Ming in front of so many people!</p>

    <p>The situation became awkward for a time.</p>

    <p>"Rongrong, I'm sorry! I just got excited and forgot about it!"</p>

    <p>In the independent team spirit voice channel established by several people from Number 60 High School. Zhai Yin immediately apologized to Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Mainly because she really didn't think that much after the enthusiasm just came up...</p>

    <p>The Peach wood branch of Wang Ling. The power of "I have to examine myself three times a day" was too strong. At that moment, she and Wang Ming were mentally trapped in an irreversible path. They only wanted to apologize. </p>

    <p>"It's okay, Sister Yinzi! It would be really good if you and Brother Ming can reconcile." Sun Rong responded.</p>

    <p>"Hey. I'm sorry. It's my fault..." Zhai Yin felt a little at a loss.</p>

    <p>Speaking of which, this can be considered an undercover mission.</p>

    <p>It was very different from the life-and-death special forces operations she had carried out before. For a moment, Zhai Yin really had no idea how to deal with the situation in front of her.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong discovered that Zhai Yin's attributes are actually that of a straight woman. She has a straightforward personality and doesn't like beating around the bush.</p>

    <p>She felt that this might be one of the important reasons why Wang Ming liked Zhai Yin.</p>

    <p>"Sister Yinzi, just relax. Next, follow my instructions."</p>

    <p>"Then what should I do next?"</p>

    <p>"I think you should let Brother Xiao Ming loosen your hands first." Sun Rong showed an awkward but polite smile.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>After saying this, Zhai Yin and Wang Ming reacted quickly like frightened birds.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong couldn't help but laugh in her heart.</p>

    <p>The quarrel was sudden and the reconciliation was quick.</p>

    <p>Is this what it feels like to be a "lover"...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was happy for the two of them. At the same time, he was a little envious.</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling looked at this scene from a distance. The expression on his face was as unmodified as ever. There was no sadness or joy.</p>

    <p>No emotion can be seen.</p>

    <p>Although the power of Peach wood branch "I have to examine myself three times a day" is the "lubricant" for the reconciliation between the two.</p>

    <p>But in the final analysis, Wang Ming and Zhai Yin actually don't want to quarrel.</p>

    <p>That's why the "reconciliation" happened so quickly.</p>

    <p>According to Jingke's words.</p>

    <p>It is said that the more violent the quarrel is, the stronger the effect of "I will examine myself three times a day" will be.</p>

    <p>If Wang Ming and Zhai Yin were really quarreling to the point where they would have to fight.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid the two of them did more than just hug each other in front of the tree house.</p>

    <p>Instead, they will kneel directly to each other and kowtow to the other side...</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, Wang Ling's body couldn't help but tremble.</p>

    <p>This scene is too strange!</p>

    <p>Kowtow to each other. Doesn't this become worshiping heaven and earth?</p>

    <p>There is an undercurrent in this venue right now...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thinks that in the magic weapon display session later, I would like to show off my Peach wood branch.</p>

    <p>When this kind of reflective power of "I examine myself three times a day" spreads to the entire venue, I'm afraid we will see a very exciting scene.</p>

    <p>While he was thinking, Moriyama Kaede walked to the front of the venue holding a glass of grape juice.</p>

    <p>He briefly stroked the back of his head to make sure that his hair gel had not fallen off.</p>

    <p>Then he cleared his throat, showed an old-fashioned expression, and started the next step in a very artificial broadcast accent.</p>

    <p>Moriyama Kaede: "Everyone! Today is an exchange meeting for our upper-class students in Jiudaohe. It is also to celebrate our newly elected five-member delegation from Jiudaohe."</p>

    <p>"We are all young geniuses who entered the Golden Core at a young age."</p>

    <p>Speaking of which, Moriyama Kaede glanced at Wang Ling: "It's different from those losers from the Foundation Building period."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Everyone has been practicing hard for many years. I must have some magic weapons that can be used. Today's exchange meeting is also a magic weapon display."</p>

    <p>Moriyama Kaedexiao said: "Then let's follow the order of the system's drawing of lots. Please ask the students who got the number to come up and show their magic weapons."</p>

    <p>"I'm really looking forward to seeing it. As our five-person representative team from Jiudaohe, I don't know what dazzling treasures we can come up with.</p>

    <p>After saying this, I looked at Wang Ling again.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling silently ate the crispy noodles from the snack area in the venue.</p>

    <p>It is said that this was specially arranged by Jisaki for Lan Mao to prepare separately.</p>

    <p>There were so many high-end cultivation foods in the entire venue. Wang Ling felt that this crispy noodles was the most high-end.</p>

    <p>After the system lottery, the first person came on stage soon.</p>

    <p>It's said to be a lottery. In fact, all the numbers were arranged by Moriyama Kaede in advance.</p>

    <p>The first person to come up was one of Moriyama Kaede's subordinates. He was also a student from District S.</p>

    <p>The young man was holding a huge potted plant with blue and white porcelain patterns about half a meter in radius. He carefully walked up the steps and placed it on the ground.</p>

    <p>The magic weapon displayed is actually similar to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Although compared to the Peach wood branch in the Sword King Realm, the spiritual gap is too big. But at least the ideas are the same.</p>

    <p>It's a pity that most people here have never seen the world.</p>

    <p>Even this small potted spiritual plant exudes spirituality that has amazed many people here.</p>

    <p>"This is a century-old purple cherry blossom..." Someone recognized the origin of the purple seedling in the pot.</p>

    <p>Sakura is the island flower of Sun Island.</p>

    <p>The so-called "seven days of cherry blossoms" refers to the period from when a cherry blossom blooms to when it withers. It only takes seven days.</p>

    <p>And the pot of cherry blossoms in the hands of this young man is even more exquisite.</p>

    <p>This is a century-old purple cherry!</p>

    <p>A kind of spiritual plant that can be qualified to be included in the auxiliary magic weapon!</p>

    <p>Even the purple cherry in this seedling state has the function of condensing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, which can give people the ability to accelerate their practice.</p>

    <p>If you keep this purple cherry potted plant in your room, it is tantamount to putting 10 spirit gathering arrays on the room.</p>

    <p>"A hundred-year-old purple cherry blossom. The seedling stage alone lasts a hundred years! And a hundred years later, the purple cherry blossom will grow into a purple cherry tree overnight one day and bloom!" Someone praised.</p>

    <p>Purple cherry trees bloom on a random day after a hundred years. This is done automatically.</p>

    <p>However, after the purple cherry blossoms bloom, their retention time is shorter than that of normal cherry blossoms. They will wither after seven hours.</p>

    <p>The mature purple cherry tree will quickly shrink and turn into a seed again...</p>

    <p>These fallen purple cherry blossom petals will become nutrients.</p>

    <p>Let the seeds receive circulating nutrients.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the purple cherry blossom also has an alias called "Samsara Sakura."</p>

    <p>There is a poem that says, "It turns into spring mud to protect the flowers." This is the perfect way to describe the purple cherry blossoms.</p>

    <p>Purple cherry blossoms are very rare on the market now.</p>

    <p>And the purple cherry blossoms with a certain number of reincarnations are even more rare and pitiful.</p>

    <p>"The purple cherry seedling in my hand has passed a hundred years. And this year is the seventh reincarnation of this purple cherry seedling." The young man said proudly.</p>

    <p>Seven rounds of purple cherry blossoms?</p>

    <p>Many people in the venue showed astonished expressions.</p>

    <p>It is said that this purple cherry blossom is priceless. The current market value of this seven-round purple cherry blossom must be at least 200 million!</p>

    <p>"I made you laugh. This is not a big deal. It's a pity. This potted plant is now more than 130 years old. My dad gave it to me. I haven't seen it grow into a tree and bloom until now."</p>

    <p>The owner of Purple Sakura, Sakai Toyotoshi, touched his head and smiled sheepishly: "On this occasion today, there are also several of our friends from Number 60 High School who came all the way from abroad. There are so many people here that I must be confused. A pot of seven-round purple cherry blossoms. Even more shy."</p>

    <p>Speaking of which, Sakai Toyotoshi also followed the example of Moriyama Kaede before and glanced at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Then he laughed and said: "They say Houlang Sang is a mascot. And purple cherry blossoms are actually a symbol of luck. I will make a small bet here today. If my pot of purple cherry blossoms can grow into a tree today. Bloom. I will give this pot of purple cherry blossoms to Houlang Sang!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed silently in his heart.</p>

    <p>Why is this necessary...</p>

    <p>He's not a rag collector...</p>
