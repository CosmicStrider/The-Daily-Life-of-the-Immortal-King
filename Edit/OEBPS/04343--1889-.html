  <h1>Chapter 1889 It's not easy to be a son-in-law</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Facts have proved that the order these days is not as good as what is said on the Internet.</p>

    <p>Even if you choose a son-in-law, you must follow the Basic Law.</p>

    <p>The eldest daughter of the Peng family is the pearl that the Peng family holds in their hands. Although Mr. Peng gave all the rights to choose his future son-in-law to Peng Da Qianjin, he must have given the minimum standard.</p>

    <p>According to what the passerby said, this old man has formulated very strict regulations on the morality of a son-in-law...</p>

    <p>① If you participate in any spiritual activities or spiritual gatherings, you must proactively inform your wife or family members. The application must be made no later than before sunset.</p>

    <p>② You are not allowed to drink alcohol under any circumstances. If you encounter an alcoholic, you should stay away immediately. Cut off friendships. Never associate with them! If necessary, you can just draw your sword and kill them!</p>

    <p>③In public places, you are not allowed to eat anything that smells too strong or smoke a bag under any circumstances. You must stay quiet. Always remind yourself that you are a quiet and beautiful man.</p>

    <p>④ Clothes should not be revealing. No tank tops. No clothes without sleeves. No shorts above the knee. No shirtless. At the same time, you should always pay attention to your personal image at home.</p>

    <p>⑤ The walking posture must be upright. The back must be straight when walking. The gaze must be forward. The eyes must be firm and aboveboard. Do not make any small gestures of peeking at other women. You must maintain a sense of uprightness at all times. The pace must be just right. No external gestures. Eight or within eight.</p>

    <p>⑥Before the official marriage, premarital sex is absolutely not allowed. People of the opposite sex are never allowed to be alone together, or spend the night outside (even if it is a business necessity! Because the business necessity of the cultivation world is dual cultivation!)</p>

    <p>⑦ You need to report to your wife in advance before purchasing anything worth more than 500 mixed spirit stones!</p>

    <p>⑧If you don't have money, you can ask your wife. The wife can provide loan services depending on the situation. The annualized rate depends on the situation. It can be set from 8% to 999%.</p>

    <p>⑨If you are a good-looking person and other conditions are in full compliance with your wishes, ignore all the above-mentioned rules on male morality.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Seeing this, everyone couldn't help but take a breath of cold air and let out a deep sigh. No one thought that Miss Peng's father could be so real.</p>

    <p>"Good guy, the direct conditions are too difficult! I'm so well-behaved and I can't do it." As someone who already has a partner, Wang Zhen felt very sad about this.</p>

    <p>He even felt that this journey of eternity had begun to set a very bad example for Liu Qingyi...</p>

    <p>What if after returning home, Liu Qingyi would imitate these rules of masculine virtue and formulate a new version of modern cultivation regulations for virtuous conduct for him? This day would really be impossible!</p>

    <p>Seeing the fearful look on Wang Zhen's face, Liu Qingyi was very satisfied. Because with her excellent training ability, even if she did not use these behavioral rules to restrain Wang Zhen, Wang Zhen was definitely a good man who abided by "male ethics."</p>

    <p>The most important reason is that Wang Zhen is timid. To put it bluntly, he still doesn't have the courage to challenge his wife's bottom line...</p>

    <p>"Don't worry. You're so good. I won't do anything to you." Liu Qingyi stroked Wang Zhen's head, hugged Wang Zhen in her arms and smiled sweetly. But this scene looks different now. It's very strange. Because they are not the original body...</p>

    <p>The casual cultivator who was passing by saw two women hugging each other. One of them, who looked like she was pregnant, was cuddling in the arms of the other woman. His whole body was like a five-thunder initiation. He was immediately stunned.</p>

    <p>After being stunned on the spot for a long moment, he hurriedly escaped from here with his spirit sword.</p>

    <p>This is too scary. Even with his eyesight, he has never seen two women so intimate in the eternal world...</p>

    <p>So the casual cultivator left as if he were fleeing. And in the process of escaping, he seemed to think of some shy scene. His whole face couldn't help but turn red.</p>

    <p>This, this, this... these are two women...</p>

    <p>So is it possible for two women to do it?</p>

    <p>He felt that he was so ignorant! In contrast, he felt that his friend who trained his domestic little female cat to become a beautiful girl and then got married.</p>

    <p>It seemed too normal. It seemed that he heard the thoughts of this cultivator. Wang Ling, the corners of Wang Ying's mouth were twitching at the same moment.</p>

    <p>Marrying the female cat that he trained into a beautiful girl... is obviously even more outrageous!!!</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling's heart collapsed. He looked at the long queue in front of him and couldn't help but feel a deep despair.</p>

    <p>If you wait like this the sun will go down!</p>

    <p>Moreover, the Peng family's headquarters seems to have imposed some restrictions on numbers. In other words, if they came to propose marriage today, it might not be their turn.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, because of the existence of Zhang Zhui, Dongda now has a lot of funds at his disposal. As long as he is rich enough, he can just spend money to buy the number of the person in line in front of him.</p>

    <p>"Brother, our master is in a hurry. I wonder if he can show his favor?" Zhang Zhui stepped forward and asked with a smile on his face.</p>

    <p>The person in front of them was also a noble son. He looked elegant and easy to talk to. However, in the eyes of the Peng family, this standard was just material for a son-in-law.</p>

    <p>"Who are you? Still want to jump in line?"</p>

    <p>"It's not for nothing. It's money. As long as we exchange places. We are willing to pay half a million spirit mixed stones to show our gratitude." Zhang Zhui stretched out a palm and said.</p>

    <p>The people in the carriage seemed to hear Zhang Zhui's voice. After hesitating for a moment, they decided to exchange. After all, whether he could become a son-in-law in the end was still a question. But the money of 500,000 mixed spirit stones was real money.</p>

    <p>After exchanging positions with satisfaction, the handsome young man in the carriage smiled at Wang Ling's carriage: "Brother, I would like to advise you. It's useless to have money. If Miss Peng doesn't like this, At best, you are just a son-in-law. How many people have you been rejected before? I think Miss Peng's standards are too high. No normal person would like her."</p>

    <p>"Then you still come to line up?" Zhang said happily.</p>

    <p>The young master smiled at this and said: "It's just like scratching a lottery ticket. What if you win? That will be endless glory and wealth. The background of the Peng family's headquarters is not small now. Everyone says that the Peng family master is the future. The Fifth Emperor."</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the handsome young man's face changed drastically. He suddenly felt a huge cold wave coming from the carriage in front.</p>

    <p>That was the pressure from Emperor Dongda. This handsome young man was immediately frightened into silence and did not dare to speak at all.</p>

    <p>In this way, Zhang Zhui spent money all the way to buy a place. Soon he brought Wang Ling, Sun Rong and others to the gate of the Peng family headquarters.</p>

    <p>A butler-like figure from the Peng family's headquarters stood up. He was wearing a luxurious fine silk suit. Even the patterns on it were embroidered with gold thread.</p>

    <p>When he saw the motorcade of Wang Ling and Sun Rong, he completely ignored the nine-star royal family logo on the motorcade. In a lazy tone, he asked arrogantly: "Who is coming?" Tell me your name."</p>
