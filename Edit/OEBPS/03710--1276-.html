  <h1>Chapter 1276 Pigeon is finally updated!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>To enter the unspeakable place, you have to guess what kind of restrictions Dao Ancestor Wang has placed.</p>

    <p>According to Jin Deng's experience of reincarnation, the monk has eliminated many wrong options in his infinite time.</p>

    <p>But unfortunately, he never found the correct answer.</p>

    <p>"In 2908, the poor monk guessed that Dao Ancestor's restriction may be that it is not allowed to enter the forbidden area by flying. So he chose the nearest position and continued backflips. He wanted to turn to the unspeakable place... but failed."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"In 2909, the poor monk thought and speculated that Dao Ancestor's restriction may not allow people with single eyelids to enter. Therefore, the poor monk poured power into his nails and cut himself a double eyelid. In the end, it ended in failure."</p>

    <p>"Master. I don't think there is any need to talk about the experience of failure."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei tried hard to keep smiling.</p>

    <p>He felt like continuing to listen to Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>The monk's image of an accomplished monk in his heart will completely collapse.</p>

    <p>At this time, the incident seemed to be in trouble again.</p>

    <p>The monk knows the exact location of the Unspeakable Place.</p>

    <p>However, even if you have the ability to destroy the entire forbidden area, there is no way to enter the forbidden area. Everything is empty talk.</p>

    <p>"Zhenren. The poor monk has something to say. I don't know whether to say it or not." At this time, Jin Deng suddenly said. He looked serious and seemed to be thinking about something.</p>

    <p>An unspeakable place.</p>

    <p>This is one of the few regrets in the monk's life.</p>

    <p>For thousands of years, he has been thinking of ways to overcome the challenges. As a result, he failed again and again.</p>

    <p>The monk was a little discouraged.</p>

    <p>Now, after witnessing the power of Wang Ling, the monk felt that if he combined his accumulated experience, they might be able to join forces.</p>

    <p>For this reason, he also quickly made plans in his mind.</p>

    <p>What he is about to say to Wang Ling now is one of his plans.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling opened his eyes slightly and looked at Jin Deng with an expression of all ears.</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren. Tell the truth. With the strength of you and me, we may really be able to break through the circle of chaos outside this forbidden area."</p>

    <p>The monk said: "However, this matter is also risky. Judging from the sudden appearance of the ancient Golden Men, I am afraid that there are already some evil ancient Golden Men in the forbidden area who have escaped the seal through their own means. If we now. If you force the pass, there is a high probability that your home will be stolen directly."</p>

    <p>"Stealing a house?"</p>

    <p>"I used to think that as long as there were poor monks guarding this earth, foreign enemies would not dare to cause trouble."</p>

    <p>The monk sighed: "I found out later that the poor monk thought too much..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Those ancient Golden Men are not stupid. They are acting quietly now. They have not launched a large-scale invasion. It's just because the poor monk and Ling Zhenren are on this earth together. They can sense the powerful power. Also No large-scale action was taken..."</p>

    <p>"What the master means is that if you and your brother go to break the forbidden area together, will those ancient Golden Men take action directly?"</p>

    <p>"Very possible."</p>

    <p>The monk said: "The poor monk's predictions are almost never wrong... In thousands of lifetimes, the poor monk has only made a mistake in his prediction once."</p>

    <p>"May I ask Master, which time was it?" Lord Diulei asked.</p>

    <p>"Just once."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"I thought I could beat Ling Zhenren. But I guessed the beginning. I didn't guess the end."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"So, the poor taoist's opinion is that before Ling Zhenren joins forces with me to break through the level, he needs to help others complete the Tribulation Transcendence..." The monk said: "We have to give help to some trustworthy brothers and let them form a Tribulation Transcendence group. Ascension smoothly."</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This idea. In fact, Wang Ling is not new.</p>

    <p>The main thing is that the noise will be very loud. This also makes Wang Ling very worried.</p>

    <p>Although the consumption of spiritual energy on the earth has reached the point of turning around, if someone is promoted, it means that the consumption of spiritual energy will gradually increase.</p>

    <p>This is also the purpose of the Agreement {True Immortal Convention} between various countries.</p>

    <p>Growth through limiting realms.</p>

    <p>Thereby alleviating the pressure of spiritual energy consumption. "In this matter, if Zhenren can trust the poor monk, the poor monk will be fully responsible for coming forward. Ling Zhenren only needs to provide assistance on the side." The monk smiled: "The {True Immortal Convention} has been agreed for many years. It's long past time to break with tradition. This planet needs an upgrade."</p>

    <p>"What's changed after the upgrade?"</p>

    <p>"True Immortal will be further liberated. In the end, with the development of time, the earth may be able to establish a channel with the divine realm." The monk said: "Of course. There are also factors that remain unchanged."</p>

    <p>"?"</p>

    <p>"That is, even if the upgrade is completed, there may still be no one who can beat Ling Zhenren."</p>

    <p>Speaking of this, Jin Deng couldn't help but sigh: "Zhenren. How lonely!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. Death Heavenly Dao performs his duties conscientiously. Standing guard in front of Sun Rong's bed.</p>

    <p>Don't let those ancient Golden Men who have escaped continue to cause trouble.</p>

    <p>The second wave passed. That is, after Heavenly Dao used the Book of Death to personally capture the three ancient Golden Men.</p>

    <p>For a long time, things were quiet in the hospital.</p>

    <p>Sun RongAlthough I still do "sit-ups" from time to time.</p>

    <p>But as long as Death Heavenly Dao is here, the girl will not feel the pain of having her soul roughly taken away by the ancient Golden Men.</p>

    <p>"The situation seems to be stable. But in fact it is far from stable." Death Heavenly Dao couldn't help but sigh.</p>

    <p>He stayed here to prevent the ancient Golden Men from taking away the girl's soul. He stayed here to alleviate the girl's pain.</p>

    <p>But it doesn't stop this inexplicable "Yin Yang Death Curse" from continuing to cause trouble on the girl.</p>

    <p>Moreover, he had already summoned the three ancient Golden Men for interrogation.</p>

    <p>As a result, these ancient Golden Men could not understand a single word of Death Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>Completely unable to communicate.</p>

    <p>"My lord, do you know why this is happening?"</p>

    <p>"The Heavenly Dao dialect has gone through many innovations. It is no longer the same as before. What they speak is the original version of the Heavenly Dao dialect. And it also has a local accent. It's a damn thing if you can understand it."</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao gave an example: "This is like a foreigner who has lived in Northeast Huaxiu speaking Wenzhou dialect. Various situations are mixed together. It is like the whisper of the devil."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>In this situation, Heavenly Dao dare not leave Sun Rong at all.</p>

    <p>He was afraid that if he left, these ancient Golden Men would take advantage of him and sneak in again.</p>

    <p>But now even if he catches these three Golden Men, it seems to be of no use... The language barrier is a huge problem.</p>

    <p>It's at a time when nothing can be done.</p>

    <p>The girl lying quietly in the medical cabin in front of her started to undergo new changes.</p>

    <p>"Master Death Heavenly Dao...Have you seen it..." Zhuo Yi showed a horrified look in his eyes.</p>

    <p>He rubbed his eyes repeatedly and observed what was happening to the girl's body.</p>

    <p>"I saw it. It was not an illusion."</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao also became nervous.</p>

    <p>Because the physical body of Sun Rong seems to be becoming transparent...</p>
