  <h1>Chapter 2105 The mystery of the ancestor of the Sun family</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: A gold coffin that looks very heavy. It is far less huge than Wang Ling imagined. Eternal inscriptions are neatly carved on it. It was translated by Sun Ru. I am sure that it was written by the founder of the Sun family himself.</p>

    <p>Since ancient times, many powerful people have had the habit of customizing coffins for themselves in advance. And the inscriptions on the coffins must be engraved by themselves. And each engraving method has its own characteristics. As a descendant of the Sun family, for Sun Ru, the founder of the painting, could not understand it more clearly.</p>

    <p>For the descendants of the Sun family, this is a sign of recognizing their ancestors and returning to the clan. The inscriptions carved by the ancestor of the Sun family are the symbol of their authentic coffins.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling did not directly open the coffin board. Instead, he stared at the eternal inscriptions on it for a while. This can be regarded as a kind of extracurricular learning.</p>

    <p>After all, he now has a lot of contact with the Eternal Ones. There is always no harm in knowing more. What's more, he has a hunch that in the future battle of destiny, the number of cultivator legions representing different positions will be greater than that of the Eternal Ones. It is the key to determine the winning hand.</p>

    <p>"Huh?" He studied the inscriptions on the coffin carefully for a while. Suddenly Wang Ling discovered something different about one of the inscriptions. This was definitely not written by the ancestor of the Sun family. It was obviously different from the other inscriptions. And the hidden location is also very secret. You can't see it at all if you don't look carefully.</p>

    <p>Following Wang Ling's gaze, Immortal Toya immediately slapped his head: "This is... the inscription of the master!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling suddenly realized.</p>

    <p>It turns out that this inscription was written by the master of Immortal Toya. Then everything makes sense now.</p>

    <p>But there are still drawbacks to this... To be honest. Wang Ling is even a little envious of the friendship between the founder of the Sun family and Laojun. It is so good that even the inscriptions on the coffin can leave a small space for each other. Must I know that this is a very strict thing for a big family. But the founder of the Sun family still did it.</p>

    <p>In modern terms, this is really a relationship that is so good that you can wear a pair of underpants directly.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya also sighed: "I have read the records. It is said that the master and the ancestor of the Sun family chose a geomantic treasure land. Whoever agreed to leave first would be buried by the other person."</p>

    <p>"Is there such a thing?" Sun Ru was stunned. Because even though she was a junior of the Sun family, she had never heard of this story with Lao Jun.</p>

    <p>"There is such a thing. Senior Sun Ru." Immortal Toya affirmed: "I have read Master's notes. They did make this agreement at the beginning. They also focused on the same place. But later they said they could not agree with the cemetery. The master negotiated, and this was how the Sun family's ancestral land came to be, and this golden coffin."</p>

    <p>"That's not right... We were selling tombs back then? That was an eternity period..." The corner of Wang Ying's mouth twitched. He felt like he had suddenly discovered a blind spot.</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya said: "Sell it! There are many cemeteries in the ages, and there are many choices. Some cemeteries are opened on other planets. But the problem is. A powerful person with the level of the ancestor of the Sun family must take over the whole It belongs to the planet. And we also pay attention to the feng shui of the planet. Where there is profit, there will be business."</p>

    <p>Sun Ru: "So for what reason did we not reach an agreement in the end?"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "It seems that when you sell the planet, part of the area on the planet belongs to the shared area. You paid for the entire planet. But it turns out that there is a piece of land that does not belong to you. Let you actually get the planet property. The direct living area on the certificate has been directly reduced. Do you think the founder and my master would be happy with it?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Wang Ying, Sun Ru, Marmot: "..."</p>

    <p>Sun Ru looked confused. As an ancient person, she had no idea about the area of a public pool.</p>

    <p>But as a modern person, Wang Ling. still knows something.</p>

    <p>Speaking of this shared area, this is one of the main reasons why Father Wang and Mother Wang chose to buy the current Wang family villa in a remote area in the suburbs.</p>

    <p>What Wang Ling didn't expect was that this concept has been around since the beginning of time...</p>

    <p>Sure enough, no matter how smart modern human monks are, the games they play are really just leftovers from their ancestors.</p>

    <p>But precisely because of this, after confirming that the outcome of choosing a planet as a cemetery was hopeless, the founder of the Sun family focused on the construction of the ancestral land and the creation of this unique golden coffin.</p>

    <p>Standing in front of the coffin, Wang Ling stopped and thought for a long time. He was not in a hurry to open it. After all, this was not his own ancestor. It is very impolite to open other people's coffin boards at will.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling's original idea was to use the ability of King's Eyes to scan the coffin. Unfortunately...King's Eyes forcibly burned the Miracle Contract during the previous battle with Xifengnian. It is still cooling down.</p>

    <p>Therefore, for Wang Ling, there is no choice now. The only choice is to open the coffin for inspection.</p>

    <p>Although I have asked what Sun Rong means about this matter, Sun Rong is not the head of the Sun family after all.</p>

    <p>But if I were to ask Boss Sun directly. Wang Ling couldn't open the question.</p>

    <p>As for Sun Ru...</p>

    <p>Until now, Sun Ru still thought that he was the real head of the Sun family. Although according to seniority, she was the elder. But what the head of the Sun family should do was something that Sun Ru should not overstep. Gu Xu</p>

    <p>In any case, it is very important for Wang Ling to find out the matter at hand. This is not only related to the Sun family, but also related to eternity. It will also be directly related to the future lifeline of the entire human cultivation world.</p>

    <p>He didn't want to meddle in other people's business, but for the sake of peace in the future, he had to investigate.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has always had a lot of feelings about emotions. But now he can clearly understand. This kind of tangled clarity...is probably a feeling of helplessness.</p>

    <p>It's the immortal king's helplessness...</p>

    <p>His behavior of opening the coffin was undoubtedly rude. So in the future, he could only make more amends to Mr. Boss Sun.</p>

    <p>I saw Wang Ling first put his hands together and bowed to the coffin.</p>

    <p>Junior. I'm sorry...</p>

    <p>He said secretly in his heart.</p>

    <p>Then he raised his sword fingers together and aimed at the golden coffin with a slight hook. The heavy coffin was like a light sponge that was floated directly in the mid-air by Wang Ling's ordinary primer.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling and everyone's eyes followed the light that penetrated into the golden coffin and looked inside.</p>

    <p>A humanoid remains that was the color of glaze came into view like this. It was so beautiful that it was unreal. Wang Ling had never seen such a well-preserved remains after eternity. And it was still the color of glaze.  Under the illumination of the light, this glazed skeleton looks like a work of art.</p>

    <p>"This is the ancestor's..." Sun Ru stared blankly. This was the first time she saw the skeleton of her ancestor up close. She wanted to kneel down on the spot and directly kowtow.</p>

    <p>However, as soon as he bent down, Immortal Toya helped him up: "Senior, wait a minute! There is something strange about this glass skeleton."</p>

    <p>"It can't be fake, right?"</p>

    <p>"The Ageless One indeed."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling touched his chin and made a judgment.</p>

    <p>But this glazed skeleton does not belong to the ancestor of the Sun family.</p>

    <p>Although he is in the golden coffin of the ancestor of the Sun family.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling still used the "Great Blood Source Technique" to completely trace the true owner of this glazed skeleton.</p>

    <p>"It's Laojun's remains."</p>

    <p>Finally. Wang Ling said.</p>

    <p>Verification. Completely over.</p>

    <p>This has confirmed Wang Ling's previous conjecture. www.uukanshu.net</p>

    <p>From the beginning, Wang Ling felt that the real ancestor of the Sun family might have been resurrected in the form of soul planting.</p>

    <p>And the person who was planted on the ancestor of the Sun family is most likely Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought that after opening the coffin, he would either find an empty coffin or a forged remains.</p>

    <p>But the glazed corpse in front of him was really incomparable. And his combat power was almost the same as that of the rumored ancestor of the Sun family.</p>

    <p>It's a pity. Wang Ling still saw clues.</p>

    <p>He did not expect that what was placed in the golden coffin would actually be the glazed remains of Lao Jun, the close friend of the founder of the Sun family.</p>

    <p>At this point, everything seems to have settled.</p>

    <p>But it seems like... it's just begun...</p>
