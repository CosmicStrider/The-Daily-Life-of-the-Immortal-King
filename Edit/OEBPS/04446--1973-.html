  <h1>Chapter 1973 The cunning academic master</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Forcibly canceling the spirit sword contract is an extremely painful experience for the spirit sword master. At that moment, the body will feel as if it has been cut by a sharp blade, causing an instant sharp pain from the soul.</p>

    <p>At the same time, this kind of pain will be transmitted to the abandoned spirit sword simultaneously.</p>

    <p>The moment the contract was forcibly interrupted, Wang Ling discovered something strange almost simultaneously.</p>

    <p>He followed Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan silently. He wanted to quietly watch the two men's sword-testing scene with great interest. However, the two of them were so excited that they didn't realize that Zhan Ye had been abandoned by Qu Shuling.</p>

    <p>At that moment, the stars scattered on Zhan Ye's pitch-black sword became much dimmer. Wang Ling saw some mist condensing on Zhan Ye's sword. Then it condensed. It turned into a drop of pitch black water and rolled down along the edge of the sword...</p>

    <p>Being abandoned by the owner. Such pain is indeed difficult to describe in words for the spirit sword itself.</p>

    <p>In the Sword King Realm, Wang Ling saw countless spiritual swords and sword spirits of all kinds that were bred in the chaos. And the sword spirits in the world were all bred in the Sword King Realm and matched according to the actual situation.</p>

    <p>It is not easy for an ordinary cultivator to give birth to a sword spirit from his spirit sword. If he does not put enough emotion into the spirit sword, he will not be able to make the spirit sword sense the resonance from the Sword King Realm and establish a sword spirit. match.</p>

    <p>Maybe to the former Qu Shuling, Zhan Ye might really be a special existence...</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Ling was thoughtful. He had no intention of comforting Zhan Ye. After all, with his clumsy language organization skills, he really couldn't think of any good words to comfort him.</p>

    <p>As a mature sword spirit, Zhan Ye should also have his own adjustment ability.</p>

    <p>Of course. In the view of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The separation between Zhan Ye and Qu Shuling is actually inevitable.</p>

    <p>As the director of this scene, from the moment he decided to repair Zhan Ye, he had already seen through the subsequent plot.</p>

    <p>"Buzz!"</p>

    <p>It was late at night. Accompanied by the sound of loud horns blowing suddenly around Wuxiang Peak, the night attack of Twenty Peaks suddenly began! Those special human figurines hidden in the spiritual plants suddenly swarmed up and headed straight for the sect leader's hall of Wuxiang Peak.</p>

    <p>A thousand human figurines are like sharp knives, piercing straight into the heart!</p>

    <p>They were like magic soldiers descending from the sky. They suddenly launched an attack when everyone was slacking off. And this attack can be said to affect the whole body.</p>

    <p>"What's going on! Where did these...these weird things come from!" The leader of Wuxiang Peak and the disciples were all panicked. They never thought that they had already tested it before. Such things were actually hidden in the absolutely safe spiritual plant area. There are so many dwarf human figurines.</p>

    <p>The iron barrel defense layout that the leader of Wuxiang Peak thought he had arranged before was also defeated almost instantly under this sudden night attack.</p>

    <p>In order to protect the lord's hall, the lord Wuxiang Peak had to re-mobilize the fighting figurines that had been stationed at the commanding heights to return to defense.</p>

    <p>And this transfer actually gave the other twenty peaks an opportunity to break through and encircle them.</p>

    <p>"Do it!"</p>

    <p>In front of the general's camp. Sun Rong looked at the smoothly unfolding battle situation in front of him and remained unmoved. He shouted coldly.</p>

    <p>The coalition of disciples from the twenty peaks has been waiting for this moment for more than a year. Almost at the moment when the order was given, everyone controlled the magic weapon that can increase the movement speed and quickly approached the Phaseless Peak. This kind of group attacked Night attacks and encirclements almost exerted their greatest strategic advantage under night.</p>

    <p>Those human figurines occupying the commanding heights have tried every means to block it. However, the special human figurines nearby are already interfering with them.</p>

    <p>These short special human figurines were surrounded in twos and threes. Under the cover of night, they turned into terrifying "facehuggers." The division of labor was clear and they knocked down these fighting figurines one by one.</p>

    <p>"It seems the attack went well."</p>

    <p>The mountain behind Wuxiang Peak came out. Such a passionate attack sound from the front made Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan couldn't help but sigh in admiration.</p>

    <p>They originally planned to secretly go up the mountain and find the guardian spirit beasts of Wuxiang Peak to try. However, they did not expect that the Twenty Peaks Allied Forces had already taken the lead in launching a night attack. The attack went very smoothly.</p>

    <p>Now they have nothing to do...</p>

    <p>"Boom!"</p>

    <p>Just when Li Changzhe was stunned, a huge meteor trailing a white tail flame in the distance hit their location without any warning.</p>

    <p>This psychic light bullet, as white as the bright moon, was not fired from the direction of the battlefield. Li Changzhe and others were overwhelmed with reaction. A small mushroom cloud almost immediately rose in the direction where they were.</p>

    <p>However, when the smoke of the explosion dissipated, Li Changzhe found that several of them were actually unscathed. Because at this moment, Zhan Ye quickly separated a dark psychic protective barrier and blocked the sudden attack of the light bomb. Block out.</p>

    <p>"So you are here."</p>

    <p>The next second, Qu Shuling's familiar voice came. He was caught off guard with this sudden attack. He thought that with Yue Li's power, he could at least blow up the three people hugging each other. But instead, he was blocked by a pitch black spiritual sword. It's blocked.</p>

    <p>This made Qu Shuling feel a little unhappy. He was Zhan Ye's former master after all. He didn't expect that after breaking away from Zhan Ye, the traitor would find a new home so quickly.</p>

    <p>"Brother Qu, I didn't expect you to have a spiritual sword here. Your sword, we repaired it for you while you were resting. You just don't want it anymore? What a pity." Li Changzhe saw this scene. I couldn't help but turn on the taunting mode.</p>

    <p>Shu Ling has endured this broken mouth for a long time. The corners of his mouth immediately twitched violently: "I have been touched by your dirty hands. Of course I don't want it anymore. This Yueli of mine is better!"</p>

    <p>"Really? I think the repaired Zhan Ye is stronger," Li Changzhe said.</p>

    <p>He was angry at Qu Shuling on purpose, but in fact, when he saw the Yueli offered by Qu Shuling, he was already in a state of disgust.</p>

    <p>Because in the previous competition, many people thought that Qu Shuling had already used his unique skill by sacrificing Zhan Ye. Unexpectedly, he actually had a second spiritual sword in his hand that was more powerful than Zhan Ye...</p>

    <p>Is this the common mentality of those cunning academics!</p>

    <p>For example, I obviously did very well in the exam, but I said I failed!</p>

    <p>Another example: Tell the outside world that you are resting all day long, but in fact you are practicing secretly in a place where no one is around!</p>

    <p>Another example. People always think that they have no trump cards. But in the blink of an eye, they pull out a brand new pair of trump cards!</p>

    <p>The corners of Li Changzhe's mouth twitched. Sure enough... he had a reason to hate Qu Shuling.</p>

    <p>"Brother Qu, isn't it a pity to use your Yue Li here?" At this time, Li Changzhe couldn't help but complain.</p>

    <p>"Are you scared?"</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling's face was expressionless.</p>

    <p>He sneered in his heart.</p>

    <p>Indeed. What Li Changzhe said is also true.</p>

    <p>Yue Li is so strong that even an elite high school student would find it difficult to control. After all, the quality is at the level of a sacred weapon. It is far superior to ordinary spiritual swords and immortal swords! He doesn't know how much hard work he put into taming Yue Li...</p>

    <p>After all, this is a testing ground for the spirit world. There is a protection mechanism in place.</p>

    <p>Now Qu Shuling just wants to eliminate Li Changzhe, Zhang Linyan and Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>As long as Yue Li performs normally, he can take all three of them away with one sword.</p>

    <p>Under normal circumstances, it would indeed be a bit dangerous for Na Yue Li to test the sword against these elite high school students.</p>

    <p>However, what Qu Shuling didn't know at this time was.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has exactly the opposite idea.</p>

    <p>Because before, Li Changzhe's idea was to test the sword with a spiritual beast. But now Qu Shuling came to his door.</p>

    <p>Just take the newly made Zhan Ye and test the sword on people.</p>

    <p>It's indeed a bit dangerous...</p>
