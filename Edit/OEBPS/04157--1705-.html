  <h1>Chapter 1705 The man in khaki trench coat</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Eons ago, when chaos gave birth to the first moments of cosmic order, there was indeed a huge race that has been ignored today.</p>

    <p>At that time, the concept of containing living beings did not even exist. The powerful dragon clan of the universe competed with the Old Dominator. Together they controlled the deep, dark, chaotic and twisted universe.</p>

    <p>Until one day, a big explosion occurred overnight in Wanlong Mountain, the stronghold of the Dragon Clan, due to inexplicable reasons. The leader of the Dragon Clan, King Wanlong, was killed on the spot.</p>

    <p>As a result, the balanced power began to gradually become unbalanced. The dragons in Wanlong Mountain were leaderless and suffered a devastating blow. Huge parts were all buried here...</p>

    <p>The few dragons that were lucky to survive were treated as sheltered creatures by the Old Dominators. They were forced to accept long-term servitude until the last dragon committed suicide because he could not accept such coercion.</p>

    <p>Li Xian and Zhang Zhui were tied to the stake. There was a drop of cold sweat on their cheeks. They did not expect that things would develop like this.</p>

    <p>According to Wang Ming's original plan, they would follow the wishes of the controlled Wang Ming to act out a small plot and go deep into the hinterland. Then they would act on their own initiative and wait for Wang Ming to break free from the shackles of the "Thought Plague" and cause a big fuss here.</p>

    <p>However, the agreed time has come. Li Xian and Zhang Zhui would not have wasted a moment when the real Wang Ming took over the body again.</p>

    <p>So at that moment, both of them felt that the situation was not good.</p>

    <p>It's nothing to them. After all, they are all skeletons who came out of the Supreme Corpse Map. Their physical bodies are virtual images transformed by King's Eyes. They will not feel any pain. But it is different if Zhai Yin is captured together.</p>

    <p>If the land they were standing on was really Wanlong Mountain back then, it would now be known as the "Dragon Cemetery."</p>

    <p>There must be a large number of dragon bones buried here. Although these dragons are all dead, their dragon breaths still remain after death. With Zhai Yin's physique, it is impossible to stay here for too long.</p>

    <p>So we have to find a way out.</p>

    <p>But if they leave this way...</p>

    <p>Before Wang Ming could take over his body again, he became isolated and helpless.</p>

    <p>This is a dilemma.</p>

    <p>Although their current condition is not good, both of them believe that if they work together, it will not be a problem to escape with Zhai Yin and Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>But now, the development of the situation has gone far beyond what they thought.</p>

    <p>The people of the Baobai Group are digging for the skeletons under the Dragon Cemetery... Although it is unclear what their purpose is. This matter is of great importance and cannot be solved by the two of them.</p>

    <p>Right now, Zhai Yin will be in more danger every second she stays here.</p>

    <p>Li Xian and Zhang Zhui were tied to the stake. They tacitly thought that they could not wait any longer.</p>

    <p>After the two looked at each other for a while.</p>

    <p>Next second!</p>

    <p>In the distance, a huge meteorite shining with bright fire fell from the sky! The shadow that covered the sky and the sun instantly covered it, shrouding the earth in front of it.</p>

    <p>Such a familiar operation. Anyone who knows something about it must know that such a method must have been done by Li Xian.</p>

    <p>There was a moment of panic at the scene.</p>

    <p>"A huge meteorite is approaching!"</p>

    <p>"Missile team! Prepare to block!"</p>

    <p>Command post. Members of the command team issued instructions. Several projectiles were instantly shot out from the Baobai Group's Dragon Cemetery command post, impacting the huge meteorite weapon in the air.</p>

    <p>Huge explosions accompanied by powerful firelight instantly turned the sky red.</p>

    <p>Li Xian couldn't help but curl his lips. It was nonsense to think that such an explosion would crush his meteorite. The meteorites he chose every time were not randomly transported. Like this meteorite, it was made by An iron meteorite naturally constructed of heavy metals from the universe.</p>

    <p>If the explosive power of the missile is less than a certain level, it will be impossible to destroy his meteorite.</p>

    <p>"Sir, this is very dangerous! Please evacuate as soon as possible!" At this time, a Baobai employee stepped forward and urged Wu Xin to leave quickly.</p>

    <p>There was no need for him to say anything. If this meteorite fell, Wu Xin could figure out just how strong the impact would be.</p>

    <p>However, his expression was calm. He stared at the meteorite that was about to fall to the ground. There was no wave on his face. Then he couldn't help but laugh: "Star Wanderer. Li Xian. Sure enough, he lived up to his eternal reputation."</p>

    <p>He knew that these were all Li Xian's tricks. However, he was not totally without any countermeasures.</p>

    <p>Just the next second, behind Wu Xin, a man holding a black umbrella, wearing a khaki trench coat and sunglasses appeared. His appearance was sudden. It was like lightning. There was a terrifying electric current all over his body.</p>

    <p>The man's rich voice came: "What do you want me to do..."</p>

    <p>"Destroy it. But be careful not to damage the ground." Wu Xin said coldly.</p>

    <p>Hearing Wu Xin's words, the man behind him nodded immediately: "Yes."</p>

    <p>Dragon's Cemetery. The bright fire from the sky is still accompanied by the rapidly falling meteorites, emitting frightening power.</p>

    <p>Facing the coming impact, all Baobai employees below are in panic.</p>

    <p>Except Wu Xin...</p>

    <p>And the man in a khaki trench coat suddenly appeared behind him.</p>

    <p>The man stepped forward and walked slowly forward. His unhurried posture made people anxious.</p>

    <p>He inserted the black umbrella in his hand into his back, and pulled out a diamond glove from his windbreaker. Only in the instant that this glove appeared, Li Xian and Zhang Zhui's gazes were simultaneously attracted by this glove, and then he revealed a look of disbelief.</p>

    <p>Strong chaotic power seeped out from this diamond glove, telling Li Xian and Zhang Zhui that this diamond glove was absolutely extraordinary!</p>

    <p>The chaos concentration exceeds at least 80%!</p>

    <p>The chaos rudder that Master Wu Xin took out earlier was terrifying enough. Now there is a glove with a chaos concentration of at least over 80%!</p>

    <p>Are these highly concentrated chaotic substances so worthless now?</p>

    <p>The two of them stared intently at the man wearing a khaki trench coat in front of them. They saw the man slowly putting on the diamond gloves on his right hand and admiring them for a while as if they were showing off.</p>

    <p>Being able to control such a high concentration of chaotic substances. The man's own combat power speaks for itself!</p>

    <p>Chaos objects are powerful. Far beyond the realm-level magic weapons. And every 10% more chaos concentration, the more powerful the backlash will be on the user's body!</p>

    <p>Therefore, the combat power must reach a certain level. Otherwise, let alone wearing this chaotic object with 80% chaos concentration on your hand, you may just take it out and squeeze it in your hand for a while, and your body will be turned into ashes!</p>

    <p>The man wearing a khaki trench coat looked calm.</p>

    <p>At this time, he finally turned his attention to the huge meteorite summoned by Li Xian in the sky, and stretched out his right hand wearing a diamond glove.</p>

    <p>There was a snap.</p>

    <p>He had snapped his fingers...</p>
