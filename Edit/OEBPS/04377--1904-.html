  <h1>Chapter 1904 The correct way to choose a nuclear bomb</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Peng Beicen's appearance Wang Ling feels like she has seen it somewhere. She has a special kind of heroism and handsomeness. She is not like her daughter's family, which has a gentle and elegant feeling, and she has the feeling of Xiaojiabiyu. You can tell by her appearance that she is a very cool person. people.</p>

    <p>The white robe perfectly set off her figure. There were no fancy ribbons made of silk and satin for decoration. It was completely different from the feeling of those female monks in the ancient times. It is not an exaggeration to describe it with the phrase "unparalleled elegance."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was a little stunned the moment she saw Peng Beicen. She never expected that the legendary eldest lady of the Peng family would be like this... She felt a little bit unlike a girl. And she was not like Wang Ling's intuition was the same. She felt that she was familiar with this Miss Peng, as if she had seen her there before.</p>

    <p>"Prince?" At this time, Peng Beicen's words interrupted Sun Rong's thoughts.</p>

    <p>It's a very magnetic voice. It's very neutral. If you close your eyes, you can't tell whether it's a man or a woman.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong quickly came to his senses: "I wonder how Miss Peng wants to compete?"</p>

    <p>She asked like this, and at the same time she was fully prepared in her mind. The purpose of their trip was to propose marriage. The focus was to meet Peng Xiren, Peng Beicen's brother, and then implement the follow-up plan.</p>

    <p>Just after these simple greetings, Sun Rong suddenly had a bad feeling. She felt that the Peng Beicen in front of her was not that simple.</p>

    <p>"The swordsmanship of Prince Wang is superb. I have seen all the previous sword dances. It is a very unique swordsmanship. I have studied thousands of swordsmanship. But this is the first time I have seen Prince Wang's swordsmanship." ."</p>

    <p>She smiled and looked very modest: "I can't compare to the prince in terms of swordsmanship. The prince is very strong. If compared to him, I think I would fall behind. But here I am. I mainly practice spiritual swords. So I have a gracious request before the competition."</p>

    <p>"Miss Peng, please speak." Sun Rong bowed politely.</p>

    <p>"It's like this. I definitely can't beat the prince. So I thought, pick one person from the queue accompanying the prince to compete on his behalf. If he beats me, then the prince will be the winner."</p>

    <p>"Pick someone..." Sun Rong was stunned. She never expected this result.</p>

    <p>At this time, she turned around and took a look. The people accompanying her were no longer human beings in Sun Rong's eyes. Instead, they transformed directly into grenades, missiles and even nuclear bombs.</p>

    <p>That's right. No matter how bad the people behind her are, they are still grenades.</p>

    <p>It will definitely not work if you win the "Grenade." Sun Rong feels that Miss Peng is very powerful. You will lose with the Grenade 80% of the time.</p>

    <p>So the best result is to draw a missile. For example, Wang Zhen who plays the Holy Stone Saint or Zhang Zhui who plays Ye Ren. It is most common sense to win when the strength is similar.</p>

    <p>As for the rest. Sun Rong feels that all of them are undoubtedly nuclear bombs!</p>

    <p>Right behind him, but sitting are the Four Emperors of Eternity! No matter which one Peng Beicen wins, he will win the prize. If a fight breaks out, he will have to act... and he must act out the feeling of narrow victory. He can't do it yet. Winning is too obvious.</p>

    <p>"Why. Why is Prince Wang so hesitant? Is it because he has no confidence in the people you brought?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Peng Beicen continued to use words to stimulate: "This is also a test. Generally speaking, whether the accompanying servants are strong or not is also reflected in the side."</p>

    <p>"Miss Peng's suggestion. You should obey it."</p>

    <p>Having said that, Sun Rong had no choice but to accept the move. She silently glanced back at Wang Ling. She hoped Wang Ling would step back a little and not stand too far forward.</p>

    <p>After all, what Sun Rong is most worried about is that Wang Ling is selected.</p>

    <p>Because even nuclear bombs are graded...</p>

    <p>Theoretically, Wang Ling is not a nuclear bomb. It is simply the legendary dark matter! It is too unstable! Once it is launched, it may directly level the entire Penglai Star!</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ling also immediately understood what Sun Rong meant. After all, he and Sun Rong had gone through several missions. This tacit understanding between the eyes is still there.</p>

    <p>But as soon as he took half a step back, Peng Beicen called him out: "That gentleman! Don't step back. It's you!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>As soon as these words came out, Sun Rong and everyone in the venue were sweating profusely.</p>

    <p>Although everyone already knows that the current plot direction of the Eternal World is basically skewed. Director Wang Ling needs to manually correct the script. But no one knows that Director Wang, who was originally standing behind the scenes, will end up on his own!</p>

    <p>"Are you sure, Miss Peng?" Sun Rong confirms.</p>

    <p>She hoped that Peng Beicen would suddenly change his mood and want to change his mind. However, Miss Peng shook her head with a smile on her face and said, "I usually like to play chess. They say that I have no regrets about my moves. Of course I will not regret my choice." .This is the brother! I saw this brother shrinking back. He seemed to have little confidence in himself. So I chose him."</p>

    <p>Having said that, Sun Rong has finally seen it through.</p>

    <p>In fact, Peng Beicen had no intention of marrying at all. That's why he chose that way.</p>

    <p>But since I have no intention of getting married, why do I need to make such a big show of letting all kinds of brides-in-law come to my door?</p>

    <p>Are you waiting for the one you love to show up?</p>

    <p>She doesn't understand.</p>

    <p>But now that Peng Beicen has chosen Wang Ling on his own initiative, Sun Rong can only silently wish Peng Beicen good luck in his heart.</p>

    <p>Anyway, it's just a test.</p>

    <p>As long as Wang Ling is not married to this woman...</p>

    <p>This was what she thought in her mind. Then she stepped aside very cooperatively.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ling was also very obedient and silently walked forward.</p>

    <p>Now that the arrow was on the string, he had no choice but to take action at this moment.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling doesn't have any panic in his heart. After all, he is only possessed now. The control of the body can still be left to Emperor Dongda. And Emperor Dongda himself can freely control his own strength. There is no suppression. The situation of being unable to survive the battle.</p>

    <p>However, as an emperor, even Emperor Dongda himself did not have much confidence. He lived in the imperial palace all year round to deal with various important matters. The people around him were all top-notch experts.</p>

    <p>Although this young lady from the Peng family looked extraordinary, in the final analysis she was just a young lady from an aristocratic family. He had no idea of her specific strength, let alone where to start.</p>

    <p>"Senior Wang... If something goes wrong, you have to hold me back." Seeing Wang Ling return the sovereignty of his body to himself. Emperor Dongda immediately understood that he wanted to take action himself.</p>

    <p>Before taking action officially, he said this in his heart.</p>

    <p>However, he received a ruthless reply from Wang Ying: "I'm sorry. I always only add gain buffs to people. I don't add attenuation properties."</p>

    <p>Emperor Dong: "What does buff... mean?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ying sighed: "It's just a buff spell."</p>

    <p>Emperor Dong: "Okay. Senior, it's better not to act rashly. I will take care of it."</p>

    <p>Helpless. Emperor Dongda sighed. Then he took out a spiritual sword directly from his Emperor's Treasure Box.</p>

    <p>This is already the worst one among all the spiritual swords he can get his hands on.</p>

    <p>However, when Emperor Dongda took it out, everyone at the scene showed shocked expressions.</p>

    <p>"Qu Wang Sword? Isn't this the legendary spiritual sword?"</p>
