  <h1>Chapter 1619 The life of pickpockets</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Catch a thief. Sometimes it's that simple, plain and simple.</p>

    <p>In front of the thieves, all resistance is ineffective. These thieves will not think that their bag of money has long been cursed by Zhang. Anyone who touches it will be sucked and unable to take it off.</p>

    <p>Then Zhang Zhui took out his cell phone and took several photos in succession of the world-famous painting in front of him, holding the money bag.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui still doesn't understand how to use other functions of the mobile phone. However, he has already learned the camera function.</p>

    <p>This is direct evidence.</p>

    <p>The video was recorded directly after the shooting. One-stop service.</p>

    <p>"You're young. What's wrong with you? You have to do such sneaky things."</p>

    <p>As a veteran in the industry, Zhang Zhui stared at the young people in front of him who were extending their hands, and let out a long sigh.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, people in the industry are getting more and more depressed.</p>

    <p>Especially the pickpocket wearing a silver watch attracted Zhang Zhui's special attention.</p>

    <p>At first glance, you can tell that this watch was "spelled out" for packaging purposes.</p>

    <p>These days, in order to protect their wealthy status, socialites on the Internet do everything possible.</p>

    <p>Fight for a hotel, fight for luxury stockings, fight for a sports car, fight for a watch, and even fight for afternoon tea...after taking photos and sending them to WeChat Moments, we leave.</p>

    <p>But a pickpocket is a pickpocket. No matter how you package yourself, you can't change the sneaky nature.</p>

    <p>"Don't you feel any sense of shame?" In response, Zhang Zhui questioned these pickpockets: "Every penny and every thing you steal may be the victim's life and property." Ah! I feel so ashamed and disgraceful for you, old man!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi immediately discovered that Zhang Zhui's face was not ordinary thick-skinned.</p>

    <p>It's obvious that this is what he does... Why can he still use such a serious and thoughtful tone?</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi was puzzled by this.</p>

    <p>As for this, Wei Zhi himself didn't understand it clearly.</p>

    <p>He didn't know that the person standing in front of him now was the biggest thief in the industry.</p>

    <p>"Senior...we're all just making a living. Do you really deserve to be so awesome?" The man with the silver watch on his hand said with a sad face.</p>

    <p>They were caught in action by Zhang Zhui. They were also photographed and videotaped.</p>

    <p>Suddenly I knew I had met an expert today.</p>

    <p>Therefore, I didn't even dare to show off when I stood in front of Zhang Zhui.</p>

    <p>He counted the number of people in front of him. In this wave, Zhang Zhui captured a total of six people.</p>

    <p>But this amount is still not enough.</p>

    <p>You can't even get an iced latte in exchange for it.</p>

    <p>But Zhang Zhui knows very well that pickpockets in the thieves circle rarely work alone.</p>

    <p>Gangs cover each other when committing crimes. Only then can the success rate be increased with a high probability.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Zhang Zhui concluded that there were other accomplices around these seven people.</p>

    <p>But after seeing these seven people being tricked, they immediately abandoned their companions and acted like "passers-by."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui touched his chin.</p>

    <p>He is currently studying vocabulary in modern society with Li Xian.</p>

    <p>I didn't expect that this skill of "pretending to be a passerby" in the rice circle actually has something in common with the pickpocket world.</p>

    <p>His goal was to gather ten people for business.</p>

    <p>So there is no need to catch everyone. As long as one of these seven people can stand up and point out his accomplice, everything will be settled.</p>

    <p>But Zhang Zhui also knows it very well.</p>

    <p>All this must be resolved before the subway reaches the next station.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, when the door opens, those friends will sneak away without hesitation.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Zhang Zhui stared at these people and said meaningfully: "Young people, it is inevitable to make mistakes. But as long as you correct them in time, it is not too late. I will give you a chance to point it out before the next station opens. Whoever identifies his accomplice first will be let go."</p>

    <p>"This..." The seven pickpockets all lowered their heads.</p>

    <p>It is true that they have accomplices.</p>

    <p>But in the final analysis, it still serves the pickpocket organization behind it.</p>

    <p>There are rules within the organization. If you are caught, you will stay in jail honestly. Generally, those who fail to commit crimes can be released after more than ten days in jail.</p>

    <p>As for betraying accomplices, this is something that must never be done.</p>

    <p>Because they will be retaliated by pickpockets.</p>

    <p>But Zhang Zhui seemed to be able to read the minds of the seven people in front of him. He clearly understood the thoughts of the seven people in front of him: "If you are worried about being retaliated, don't worry. You have old age as your guarantee. As long as you change your ways, no one can. I'll take action against you."</p>

    <p>"You must have seen this old trick. Make a decision quickly. The next stop is coming soon."</p>

    <p>At this time, the man wearing a silver watch suddenly pointed at a few people in front of him and shouted: "Those are my accomplices! The man with the killer haircut, the aunt with saggy breasts, the website holding the red mobile phone Red face! And that middle-aged Mediterranean man!"</p>

    <p>These characteristics are described very standardly.</p>

    <p>So Zhang Zhui quickly locked onto the character.</p>

    <p>One for four.</p>

    <p>The indicator can be achieved just right.</p>

    <p>"Damn it!"</p>

    <p>The pickpockets named by the man with the silver watch were shocked. They did not expect that the man with the silver watch would betray them.</p>

    <p>They fled to other cars one after another.</p>

    <p>However, how could it slip away so easily under Zhang Zhui's nose?</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui waved his hand. These people suddenly felt that their pants and skirts were loose. They fell off their bodies inexplicably. Then they all tripped and fell to the ground.</p>

    <p>This is another one of Zhang Zhui's special skills, "God comes to take off clothes."</p>

    <p>Can quickly take off any clothing targeted...</p>

    <p>Since it was in a public place, Zhang Zhui could not be cruel.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, these people wouldn't even have a single piece of clothing left on them.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>So at the entrance of the next subway station, nearby plainclothes police officers rushed to the scene immediately after receiving the alarm.</p>

    <p>When they saw Zhang Zhui and Wei Zhi escorting ten pickpockets out of the subway in a line, all the police officers looked shocked.</p>

    <p>It's been a long time since they've seen a thief on this scale...</p>

    <p>Because the man with the silver watch took the initiative to report it, Zhang Zhui kept his promise and let the man go.</p>

    <p>There was no man with the silver watch in the queue.</p>

    <p>And before the man with the silver watch left, he wrote a talisman on the palm of the man with the silver watch.</p>

    <p>This is for men with silver watches to save their lives.</p>

    <p>Avoid subsequent retaliation and the like.</p>

    <p>"Comrade policeman, because a junior took the initiative to report the matter, I kept my promise and let him go. Doesn't that matter?" Zhang Zhui took the initiative to step forward and shook hands with the plainclothes man.</p>

    <p>"He stole your things... If you decide not to pursue the case, it's no problem." The plainclothes policeman wiped his sweat.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui showed the photo taken on his phone: "That's the guy. He's wearing a silver watch."</p>

    <p>"Hey. I've never seen a face before. He should be a new guy in the gang. It's not necessarily that he was forced to join due to some kind of threat." Several old policemen came around and recognized their faces. They all shook their heads.</p>

    <p>One of the old policemen sighed. He stared at the old faces in front of him and whispered to Zhang Zhui: "The two groups you see are organized by the two biggest pickpockets in the circle. There are many people. One is called The hunter guild, one is called the League of Thieves."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui smiled: "Tell me this. Doesn't it matter?"</p>

    <p>The old policeman directly put his shoulder to his shoulder and said, "Although I don't know who this brother is, I can tell he is an expert at a glance. Even experienced plainclothes guys like us are beyond our reach! I wonder if your brother is interested in being our consultant?"</p>

    <p>"Isn't this... not good?" Zhang Zhui smiled.</p>

    <p>"There is a salary!" the old policeman said: "Ten thousand a month! As long as the target can be achieved. Help me destroy the Hunters Association and the Thieves League smoothly. Everything else is easy to talk about."</p>

    <p>"Ten thousand yuan." Zhang Zhui touched his chin.</p>

    <p>Ten thousand yuan. It can buy more than 300 large iced lattes.</p>

    <p>Sounds like a pretty good deal.</p>

    <p>"Okay." Finally, Zhang Zhui and the old policeman named Kong Feng added each other on WeChat and nodded in agreement.</p>

    <p>Before leaving, Zhang Zhui handed the bag of money to Kong Feng.</p>

    <p>"So this isn't your money?" Kong Feng was surprised.</p>

    <p>"No. In fact, it was all stolen from these pickpockets. It is said that these pickpockets stole it from the cash box of a certain bus!"</p>

    <p>Pickpockets: "???"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When he went out for a trip, he also joined the plainclothes police team who were fighting against pickpockets as a consultant. This was something Zhang Zhui did not expect.</p>

    <p>On the way to the spirit beast market, his eyes suddenly turned to Wei Zhi: "Did you arrange this?"</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi was sweating profusely.</p>

    <p>He was not good at lying. He had to tell the truth: "I'm sorry, senior...I...I just thought it was very interesting. I just sent what happened to Zhuo Yi brother...Zhuo Yi brother said I can help you introduce a job by the way..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Senior, don't be angry..."</p>

    <p>"I'm not angry."</p>

    <p>"Later. I'll let senior drink all you can ice latte!"</p>

    <p>"Deal." Zhang Zhui nodded with a smile on his face.</p>

    <p>He found Wei Zhi's back more and more cute.</p>

    <p>And it seems good to join an anti-pocketing organization or something.</p>

    <p>It's a way for him, an eternal old man, to use his remaining energy...</p>
