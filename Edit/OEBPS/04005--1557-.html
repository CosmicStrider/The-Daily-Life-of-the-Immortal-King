  <h1>Chapter 1557 I apologize now. Is it still too late?</h1>

  <div>

    

    <p>The probability of purple cherry blossoms blooming is extremely low.</p>

    <p>What's more, this is still in the cold winter...</p>

    <p>And when the purple cherry blossoms, which symbolize holiness and luck, appear in front of everyone.</p>

    <p>Everyone in the field looked at him with horrified looks.</p>

    <p>Of course. The purple cherry blossoms blooming out of season are a miracle of nature.</p>

    <p>Then the magical phenomenon called "Purple Cherry Blossom Gift" that only goes in the direction of Wang Ling...is even more of a miracle among miracles!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked around. He saw that many people around him were stunned, looking at this magical scene in astonishment.</p>

    <p>Many people want to take pictures of this miraculous scene with their mobile phones.</p>

    <p>There were pious expressions on their faces.</p>

    <p>There is no doubt about it. This is a super collision between mascots!</p>

    <p>This is mascot + mascot = mascot plus!</p>

    <p>Repost this "Purple Cherry Gift Houlang Photo!" The European Emperor is possessed, everything goes well, and you will definitely pass every exam!</p>

    <p>This pot of seven-wheeled purple cherry blossoms suddenly bloomed indoors. It is so beautiful.</p>

    <p>Brilliant purple petals with magical colors are blown by the breeze outside the treehouse window.</p>

    <p>Like petals scattered after an immortal flight.</p>

    <p>This beautiful scene makes people feel like they are instantly in an outdoor peach blossom garden.</p>

    <p>The tangy fragrance accompanies the fluttering purple cherry blossoms.</p>

    <p>It was dazzling for a moment.</p>
    
    <p>"awsl!"</p>

    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Meaning "That's so cute.")</dfn>

    <p>"It's so pretty..."</p>

    <p>This scene was so romantic that the men and women present were stunned beyond measure.</p>

    <p>It is simply a beautiful wallpaper in reality!</p>

    <p>Every angle taken is breathtakingly beautiful!</p>

    <p>The only flaw is standing behind this pot of purple cherry blossoms.</p>

    <p>Moriyama Kaede and Sakai Toyotoshi were slightly embarrassed at this moment.</p>

    <p>"You guys give way! Come down quickly! Don't pollute the picture!"</p>

    <p>"Pollution... pollution..." Moriyama Kaede was furious.</p>

    <p>He originally wanted to make some remarks in defense.</p>

    <p>But in front of the purple cherry tree, he finally didn't have the courage to open his mouth.</p>

    <p>Sakura is something that the islanders of Sun Island respect very much.</p>

    <p>Especially the pot in front of me is a seven-wheeled purple cherry blossom.</p>

    <p>If you are disrespectful to him, you will probably suffer retribution.</p>

    <p>In fact, after feeling frustrated in his heart, Moriyama Kaede was also reflecting on his actions.</p>

    <p>His purpose for holding this exchange meeting was to prevent Wang Ling from coming to Taiwan.</p>

    <p>But he didn't expect that now he himself would be embarrassed.</p>

    <p>Purple cherry blossoms blooming out of season. And a gift of purple cherry blossoms...</p>

    <p>All this is like God's will and gift.</p>

    <p>And what Moriyama Kaede is thinking about now is reflecting on whether he really did something wrong.</p>

    <p>Such a miraculous vision made him wonder at this moment whether he should not be against Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Am I really wrong..."</p>

    <p>Under the urging of everyone, Moriyama Kaede had no choice but to think while pulling Sakai Toyotoshi down from the stage.</p>

    <p>"President. What should I do? Save the child..."</p>

    <p>In the audience, only Sakai Toyotoshi looked like he was about to cry.</p>

    <p>Moriyama Kaede glanced at Sakai Toyotoshi: "This is the oath you made yourself. In front of so many people. You'd better accept it."</p>

    <p>"I will definitely be beaten to death by my father."</p>

    <p>Sakai Toyotoshi's face was full of dejection. Then he looked at Wang Ling's expression. He was filled with anger: "This Houlang Sang... I'm not done with him! President! Hurry up to the next step! I can't wait to see it." It's time for him to be ridiculed!"</p>

    <p>However. To Sakai Toyotoshi's surprise.</p>

    <p>Moriyama Kaede, who originally planned this exchange meeting, actually just sighed after calming down: "There is no next step."</p>

    <p>Sakai Toyotoshi: "?"</p>

    <p>Moriyama Kaede: "This is God's will... maybe we really shouldn't go against Houlang Sang."</p>

    <p>Sakai Toyotoshi: "..."</p>

    <p>Just for a moment. Everything seemed to go wrong.</p>

    <p>As the initiator of this chess game, Moriyama Kaede's thoughts changed so quickly that Sakai Toyotoshi felt caught off guard.</p>

    <p>And in fact...</p>

    <p>This is actually because the "Peach wood branch" in the hands of Wang Ling is exerting the important power of "I have to examine myself three times a day!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is now covered with disposable seals Talisman. Theoretically, there is no possibility of breath leakage.</p>

    <p>So as far as Wang Ling's personal judgment is concerned.</p>

    <p>The reason why the purple cherry tree stretched out its branches towards him was probably because of the Peach wood branch in his hand...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was also a little surprised.</p>

    <p>A cherry blossom tree. Falling in love with a Peach wood branch...</p>

    <p>Stories like this always sound a bit fantastical.</p>

    <p>But if you don't know, this story sounds a bit romantic at first glance.</p>
    
    <p>The effect is comparable to "Ah Zhen falls in love with Ah Qiang."</p>

    <dfn><sup>2</sup>(A song... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtko96w3938 )</dfn>

    <p>When the two spiritual plants resonate emotionally, the power of Peach wood branch "I examine myself three times a day" is directly distributed along the floral fragrance of purple cherry...</p>

    <p>Moriyama Kaede's heart that was bent on opposing Wang Ling was resolved on the spot.</p>

    <p>Sakai Toyotoshi was still complaining in his heart about Moriyama Kaede's betrayal. But in the next second, he smelled the fragrance of flowers and didn't know why he suddenly felt a sense of guilt in his heart.</p>

    <p>He began to find that he did not dare to look directly at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Because when facing Wang Ling, Sakai Toyotoshi actually felt a sense of shame in his heart!</p>

    <p>He was obviously scared to death. He was afraid that his boring bet would give away this pot of purple cherry blossoms worth 200 million in vain, and that he would be beaten violently by his father.</p>

    <p>But now Sakai Toyotoshi suddenly feels that if he fails to fulfill the promise he made... it seems to be more terrible than being beaten to death by his own father!</p>

    <p>As an upright man.</p>

    <p>Sakai Toyotoshi feels that he should take on his responsibilities as a boy.</p>

    <p>Although he himself didn't know why his inner thoughts suddenly changed so drastically.</p>

    <p>But this power of shame and introspection is like a fish bone stuck in Sakai Toyotoshi's heart.</p>

    <p>So a few seconds later, Wang Ling in the distance saw such a scene.</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry...I shouldn't have been like this..."</p>

    <p>Along with the murmur in his mouth, two tears actually fell from the corners of Sakai Toyotoshi's eyes.</p>

    <p>Then he quickly wiped away his tears.</p>

    <p>He walked up to everyone again and said, "I admit it. I am driven by vanity. And this pot of purple cherry blossoms was actually secretly brought out of my house."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>There were still tears in the corners of Sakai Toyotoshi's eyes: "But since I, Sakai Toyotoshi, have made a promise! Then I will definitely fulfill my promise! Give the purple cherry to Houlang Sang!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Then, after the silence, the audience burst into thunderous applause.</p>

    <p>"Well done Sakai-san!"</p>

    <p>"Those who keep their promises are the most handsome."</p><p>...</p>

    

    <p>And here. After Sakai Toyotoshi just expressed his stance.</p>

    <p>Moriyama Kaede also stood up. In front of everyone, he knelt on the ground and confessed: "Houlang Sang! I was wrong!"</p><p>"..."</p>

    

    <p>"And I want to clarify to everyone. Many of the posts about Houlang Sang that have been published on the Internet are actually made up by me!"</p>

    <p>He raised his head and looked at Wang Ling. His eyes were red: "Houlang Sang. Is it too late for me to apologize to you now...?"</p><p>"..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    

    <p>Unexpectedly Wang Ling, the exchange meeting held for him at noon would be perfectly resolved by the power of that Peach wood branch.</p>

    <p>This is an unexpected change for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>And besides that, there was a second thing that Wang Ling didn't expect.</p>

    <p>That's what happened at this upper-class student exchange meeting. It was actually filmed by Jisaki and Ma Jiao. Special effects processing and editing were performed.</p>

    <p>They are going to use this video as a promotional video for Gray Cult.</p>

    <p>Finally, use the account "Jiudaohe Gray Cult Branch" registered before. Post it directly on station B.</p>

    <p>"Houlang Sang, Rong Jiang, Brother Xiaoer. Can you take a look at the content of this video?"</p>

    <p>In the chat group established separately with Jisaki. Jisaki obediently sent the video preview information.</p>

    <p>The title of this video is planned to be: Purple Cherry Blossoms are blooming. A gift to Gray Cult members? Jiudaohe Gray Cult branch. Welcome to join and share your luck!</p>

    <p>Jisaki handled the entire video very carefully.</p>

    <p>Only the back of Wang Ling was edited. The name of Wang Ling was not mentioned throughout.</p>

    <p>It just uses the identity of a Gray Cult member.</p>

    <p>As for the photos spread on the Internet, they are all blurred due to the "big blocking technique." It is completely unclear what Wang Ling looks like...</p>

    <p>"Well done."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong praised in the group: "Low-key is our rule at Gray Cult. This is handled very well."</p>

    <p>"Rong Jiang deserves the award."</p>

    <p>Jisaki said: "But I still haven't figured it out yet. Why did Moriyama Kaede and Sakai Toyotoshi apologize in front of so many people? It should not only be because they were influenced by seeing Murasaki Sakura, right?"</p>

    <p>"Oh? What else do you think?" Wang Ming asked funnyly.</p>

    <p>"Of course there is Houlang Sang's personality charm! Although Houlang Sang's appearance can't be clearly seen in these photos on the Internet...but the outline looks very handsome!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong stared at the screen and smiled: "Of course! Classmate Wang Ling is the best!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Jisaki: "Ah, by the way, Rong Jiang! I have received applications from Moriyama Kaede and Sakai Toyotoshi for teaching."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was startled: "They want to join the religion so quickly? What do you think?"</p>

    <p>Jisaki: "I think Moriyama Kaede still needs to be investigated. As for Sakai Toyotoshi-san, I think it is best to satisfy his wish first. He said that this was his last request before he was beaten to death by his father."</p>

    <p>"You tell him. Just reassure him. He won't be beaten to death. Just join Gray Cult. Continue to support classmate Wang Ling. I will definitely protect him." Sun Rong said with a smile.</p>

    <p>Speaking of which, this time Gray Cult can make a splash on the Internet.</p>

    <p>In fact, thanks to Sakai Toyotoshi's bet, the program's effect was immediately maximized.</p>

    <p>Sun Rongn my heart, I am actually a little grateful to Sakai Toyotoshi.</p>

    <p>Now that we have turned enemies into friends, everything that follows is easy to discuss.</p>

    <p>The seven-wheel purple cherry blossoms have now become eight-wheel purple cherry blossoms. The value is a little higher than before.</p>

    <p>But it's only 500 million at best.</p>

    <p>"What does Sakai Toyotoshi-san do?" asked Sun Rong in the group.</p>

    <p>"It's from Kai Lingzhi Farm. It provides materials to many elixir companies." Jisaki said.</p>

    <p>"Okay. I understand." The girl replied with a smile.</p>

    <p>At the same time, I already have a corresponding plan in mind.</p><p>...</p>

    

    <p>That afternoon, when Sakai Toyotoshi came home from school, he felt uneasy.</p>

    <p>He was worried about his father's beating and scolding.</p>

    <p>After all, Purple Sakura is an important value-preserving tool for the Sakai family.</p>

    <p>Moreover, this is an ancestral item.</p>

    <p>Before Sakai Toyotoshi returned home. Before returning home, Sakai Toyotoshi had taken an elixir to heal his wounds, as well as to numb and paralyze him. To prevent his father from blowing his brains out all over the mountain...</p>

    <p>He tiptoed and changed into slippers in front of the entrance. He walked towards his bedroom like a thief.</p>

    <p>As a result, as soon as he took two steps, a figure appeared behind him.</p>

    <p>"Sakai! Stop!" A majestic male voice stopped him.</p>

    <p>It was his father. Naru Sakai.</p>

    <p>"Father...I..." Sakai Toyotoshi was so frightened that his legs weakened on the spot.</p>

    <p>"Son, what's wrong with you?"</p>

    <p>Naru Sakai went over to help him.</p>

    <p>"Father...I shouldn't bet with others. I lost that pot of purple cherry...just hit me..." Sakai Toyotoshi looked at the man in front of him.</p>

    <p>"Why should I hit you? Good sales, son!"</p>

    <p>"ah?"</p>

    <p>"I was just contacted by the person in charge of Huaguo Shuilian Group's Commercial Department. He said he saw your video on the internet. Seeing you keep your promise. I was very touched. They gave our family a 2 billion dollar order for spiritual plants!"</p>

    <p>Sakai Toyotoshi: "?"</p>

  <p>Is this okay?</p></div>
