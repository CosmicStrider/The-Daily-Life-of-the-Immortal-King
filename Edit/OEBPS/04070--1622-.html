  <h1>Chapter 1622 Night Attack</h1>

  <div>

    

    <p>The most famous thief in the Eternal Era is none other than Zhang Zhui. But besides Zhang Zhui, there are other Eternal Powerhouses who can be ranked as such.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui was the number one thief of the year.</p>

    <p>The second person behind Zhang Zhui is Wuming, who is known as the Ten Thousand Ghosts Walking at Night.</p>
    
    <p>As the name suggests. Because no one knows this person's name, it is called Wuming<sup>1</sup>.</p>

    <dfn><sup>1</sup>(Wuming translates to "Nameless")</dfn>

    <p>Of course, there is also a theory that this person is actually named Wu Ming. Later, he was yelling and screaming, but for no apparent reason, he lost his name...</p>

    <p>Li Xian once had an encounter with Wu Ming. This man was petite and his face could not be seen clearly. The aura all over his body was wrapped in layers of secret bandages, making it airtight. He was a very good person who hid himself.</p>

    <p>Therefore, at that time, some people also speculated that Wuming's true identity was a little lolita.</p>

    <p>At that time, it also caused a trend.</p>

    <p>"Do you know Wu Ming?" At this time, Li Xian couldn't help being curious and asked.</p>

    <p>"Is there another person like this?" Zhang Zhui raised his eyebrows and then shook his head.</p>

    <p>"He/she is the second best thief in your world. You don't know?" Li Xian was surprised.</p>

    <p>"Ha. The rankings are all given by others. This battle between first and second. This drama is just empty talk." Zhang Zhui said with a smile: "I focused on performance back then. No serious person would look at the rankings."</p>

    <p>I have to say, what Zhang Zhui said actually made sense. Li Xian was speechless for a moment.</p>

    <p>While talking softly, Zhang Zhui suddenly turned the handle and opened the door.</p>

    <p>"It's done."</p>

    <p>"So fast?"</p>

    <p>"For me, this score is a failing grade." Zhang Zhui sighed and said, "Look back. You have to practice again."</p>

    <p>Mainly, it is the lock cylinder of the modern cultivation world. The structure inside is too simple. It is almost a brainless structure.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui was used to picking high-end locks back then. So when he encounters these modern locks, he often confuses the problem and delays the time of picking the lock.</p>

    <p>This is like a high-end game player predicting the moves of a low-end game player.</p>

    <p>You would think that players in low-end games are very good at their physical skills. They are quick to deal with damage and have crazy predictions.</p>

    <p>As a result, the opponent was walking in a straight line!</p>

    <p>And you.</p>

    <p>All skills are empty...</p>

    <p>So Zhang Zhui pried the lock of Jiang Yingying's house for three minutes before opening it.</p>

    <p>This is a shame for him.</p>

    <p>But in the eyes of an outsider like Li Xian, who only knows how to smash doors with meteorites, he is already considered very powerful.</p>

    <p>"It would be great if I could see that old master again in my lifetime." After opening the door, Zhang Zhui couldn't help but murmured softly.</p>

    <p>"Is that the great god named Xiang Yi?"</p>

    <p>"He knows a lot of things. It's not just lock picking. But if it's a lock of this level, he can open it in the blink of an eye." Zhang Zhui's eyes showed admiration. It can be seen that he respects Xiang Yi.</p>

    <p>This made Li Xian a little curious.</p>

    <p>Because he rarely saw Zhang Zhui look like this.</p>

    <p>Based on his experience, he shouldn't know about those famous eternal strong men. So he thought Zhang Zhui was making up some nonsense story to deceive him.</p>

    <p>But now it seems that these things are true.</p><p>...</p>

    

    <p>A night raid on a high school girl's apartment was something I would have never imagined before.</p>

    <p>After all, he is a modest gentleman. There is no way he would do such an act that offends a girl and is ungentlemanly.</p>

    <p>But I didn't expect that the persona I had maintained for many years would be completely shattered on this day.</p>

    <p>For a time, Li Xian's heart became a little complicated.</p>

    <p>The apartment Jiang Yingying lives in is relatively small, only 50 square meters. However, although Ma Jiao is small, it is fully equipped.</p>

    <p>This is a private room. Every place is light pink. It is full of a girlish feeling.</p>

    <p>At first glance, you can tell that it is a house where girls live.</p>

    <p>As soon as he entered the door, Zhang Zhui grabbed a surveillance camera in front of him with lightning speed and covered the surveillance camera with a seal.</p>

    <p>This is a surveillance camera specially installed by Marshal Jiang to protect the safety of his granddaughter. It is directly facing the door.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, Zhang Zhui reacted quickly. He stepped forward and covered it with his seal. The picture captured by the surveillance camera was temporarily affected by the spell effect and was frozen in the picture where the door had not been opened more than ten seconds ago.</p>

    <p>"As expected of Brother Zi Xiang." Li Xian marveled in his heart.</p>

    <p>He followed Zhang Zhui carefully, trying not to make the slightest sound.</p>

    <p>Because the room was quiet. Jiang Yingying seemed to have fallen asleep.</p>

    <p>What time did you go to bed?</p>

    <p>It's only a quarter past six in the evening!</p>

    <p>Nowadays, the young people in the cultivation world are all newcomers who advocate sleeping with others and getting high...</p>

    <p>Li Xian instinctively sensed that something was not quite right.</p>

    <p>"Brother Zi Xiang, this situation seems a bit..."</p>

    <p>"Don't say so much yet."</p>

    <p>The two used sound transmission to secretly establish a team channel to communicate.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui frowned and stuffed a slippery object into Li Xian's hand.</p>

    <p>"This is?" Li Xian looked at the thing in his hand and was shocked.</p>

    <p>"Silk stockings." Zhang Zhui said.</p>

    <p>"Silk...silk stockings...what do I want silk stockings for..."</p>

    <p>"Of course it's a pullover. It can cover it up a little bit," Zhang said without changing his expression.</p>

    <p>"But if you steal someone else's stockings, it's a bit..."</p>

    <p>"Isn't there nothing you can do about it? Just make do with it, dear brother." Zhang Zhui finished speaking. He couldn't help but smile: "Besides, can we call stealing something for a cultured person? This is clearly called stealing."</p><p>"..."</p>

    

    <p>Li Xian was speechless.</p>

    <p>He is an honest man.</p>

    <p>This is also the first time to do this kind of thing.</p>

    <p>I felt extremely nervous inside.</p>

    <p>He had always only used meteorites to solve problems. After sensing that the situation in the house was not good, he immediately became a little nervous. He didn't know what to do next.</p>

    <p>This kind of sneaky occasion is not Li Xian's home field after all.</p>

    <p>His mind went blank. He stared at the stockings in his hand. Finally he gritted his teeth and put them on according to Zhang Zhui's instructions.</p>

    <p>And the other side.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui said nothing. He took out his mobile phone and took a photo of Li Xian...</p>

    <p>Li Xian: "Brother Zi Xiang. What are you?"</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui: "Just to commemorate."</p>

    <p>Li Xian: "Memory is nothing! Why don't you use it yourself!"</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui smiled again: "I'm a seasoned person. You don't need these. You are a newcomer, so you have to use them. And you are very lucky today."</p>

    <p>Li Xian didn't answer: "What do you mean?"</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui: "These stockings were used by Miss Jiang."</p>

    <p>Li Xian knew that he had been tricked by Zhang Zhui. He was so angry that he took off the black silk stockings and threw it to the ground.</p>

    <p>--Isn't this so fucking deceptive!</p>

    <p>At this moment, Zhang Zhui and Li Xian suddenly heard noise coming from Jiang Yingying's door.</p>

    <p>"Someone is coming. Hide first." Zhang Zhui reacted quickly and immediately took Li Xian and flew toward a room.</p>

    <p>Li Xian was simply dragged away by Zhang Zhui. He was shocked when he entered the house.</p>

    <p>Because the place where Zhang Zhui took him to hide turned out to be Jiang Yingying's bedroom.</p>

    <p>At this time, Jiang Yingying looked very tired and was sleeping with his head buried in the quilt.</p>

    <p>Li Xian suddenly felt bad: "Why are you hiding here..."</p>

    <p>"It's only such a big place in total. Where else can we hide?" Zhang Zhui made a hissing gesture, and then winked at Li Xian. The two of them fell silent at the same time, and used clairvoyance to look out the door warily.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the door handle of the main entrance of Jiang Yingying's apartment was unscrewed by another hand...</p></div>
