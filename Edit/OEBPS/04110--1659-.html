  <h1>Chapter 1659 Will Guard</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Li Xian is very generous.</p>

    <p>Among these many eternal strong men, he is considered a decent man. He would not engage in such operations that take advantage of others.</p>

    <p>But if the person entering the house is Zhang Zhui, that may not necessarily be the case.</p>

    <p>The yellow-haired female astrologer dressed as a witch in front of her was not Li Xian's cup of tea. But Zhang was a womanizer. All kinds of people had "stolen" her in those years. There were people of all models and skin colors.</p>

    <p>It's really hard to imagine. If the person who just walked in was Zhang Zhui, this Miss Melissa might not even have any bones left in the end.</p>

    <p>"What I want is not your body. You should know by looking at my face. I am not that kind of person." Li Xian sighed helplessly. He is handsome and personable. He does not seem to be of that genre.</p>

    <p>In fact, it was Melissa who thought too much and got the wrong idea.</p>

    <p>And she actually felt that if something really happened with Li Xian, it wouldn't be a loss...</p>

    <p>There was a moment of silence and embarrassment. Melissa put on the clothes she had taken off again. Then she sat in front of the divination table again. After calming down, she asked calmly: "So, what do you want, senior?"</p>

    <p>At this time, the two of them had a tacit understanding. It was assumed that nothing had happened just now.</p>

    <p>"It's very simple. If you want me to teach you my craft, then use some information that I'm interested in in exchange." Li Xian made the conditions.</p>

    <p>"You're so good at astrology, senior. Is there any information that you don't know?" Melissa showed an unbelievable expression.</p>

    <p>"Astrology isn't perfect. Even for me. Against an opponent who's prepared for it. There's still a chance that I'll make a mistake. So. Why don't we just go and ask someone who may know the information." Li Xian sighed and said frankly.</p>

    <p>He knew that Melissa actually had her own concerns, so he directly grabbed her hand and placed it on the black crystal ball in front of her, and performed a very simple astrological calculation.</p>

    <p>Then she said, "Ms. Melissa. Your mother doesn't seem to be in the best of health. That's why you're so short of money. You're very short of money. Your boyfriend owns the Astrology Club. But your boyfriend is a scumbag. He's a womanizer. That's why you don't have any feelings for him anymore. That's why you're here, trying to get customers to buy transit products. It's mainly to cure your mother's cervical spondylosis, isn't it?"</p>

    <p>When Melissa heard this, she looked incredulously.</p>

    <p>It was the first time she met Li Xian...it was impossible for anyone to know so much about her.</p>

    <p>Moreover, Melissa never mentioned her mother's illness to anyone.</p>

    <p>At this moment, she heard Li Xian's words. Her face showed undisguised shock: "Senior...you..."</p>

    <p>"Maybe it's a little offensive to Ms. Melissa. But that's what I just saw. But there's actually a little more to it than that. If I say too much. It might be painful for Ms. Melissa. Let's leave it at that."</p>

    <p>Li Xian waved his hand, frowned slightly as if thinking, and said calmly: "I know that there is a set of Hunyuan Kung Fu that can cure Ms. Melissa's mother's illness."</p>

    <p>"Hunyuan Kung Fu? Can Senior Li use Hunyuan Kung Fu to treat my mother's cervical spondylosis?"</p>

    <p>"Of course. This set of exercises is very simple. There are not many realm restrictions. And if you only teach the massage and physical therapy part, you can learn it yourself."</p>

    <p>Li Xian said. He crossed his fingers and held his chin: "I can teach you how to treat your mother's illness. I can also teach you some new astrological methods. As long as you master the core skills of astrology, you can do it in this place. Get rid of your philandering boyfriend. Isn't it popular now for independent women to do it?"</p>

    <p>There was a "buzz" sound. Melissa felt her heart beating hard.</p>

    <p>Li Xian's words touched her soul directly. It must be said that they gave her a strong feeling of excitement.</p>

    <p>She has done all this for so many years. In the final analysis, the simplest reason is to protect her family.</p>

    <p>After careful consideration, Melissa raised her head with tears in her eyes: "Senior, what do you want me to do?"</p>

    <p>Li Xian smiled calmly: "I want to inquire.</p>

    <p>It's about that adult. "Melissa is not stupid. When she saw Li Xian's methods, she had already made a guess about Li Xian's purpose.</p>

    <p>She said nothing. She just turned around and opened a hidden compartment. She pressed a button.</p>

    <p>Standing time. In this fortune-telling room, the grids on the four walls turned over instantly like fish scales. Almost every grid was embedded with a crystal of a different color.</p>

    <p>After doing all this, Melissa said nervously: "Senior, I have decorated this room for a long time. I don't know if it is useful. But this is the best way to stop explorers. But time is limited. Once the energy of this crystal is used up, it will no longer work."</p>

    <p>"Explorer?"</p>

    <p>"This is what the Lord uses to monitor the overall situation...it is also called the Will Guard."</p>

    <p>Melissa said: "The will of all of us is under the monitoring of that adult...Senior should have seen the light beams above the castle, right? Unless there is a way to block those light beams..."</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the energy of the crystal in this house had been exhausted.</p>

    <p>It lasted less than a minute.</p>

    <p>By this time, Li Xian had completely understood.</p>

    <p>Melissa didn't dare to say it. She didn't even dare to think about "that adult" in her heart.</p>

    <p>The will to monitor such an operation is a huge deterrent to all mechanized cultivators in this technological city.</p>

    <p>However, people like Li Xian and Zhang Zhui who have mixed in from the outside will not suffer such coercion.</p>

    <p>"Just block the light beam on the castle."</p>

    <p>At this time, Li Xian muttered secretly in his heart. He immediately sent a message to Zhang Zhui outside: "What do you think, Brother Zi Xiang?"</p>

    <p>"It's just a steal. I'll give it a try." Zhang Zhui received the request from Li Xian.</p>

    <p>Without saying a word, he looked like a ghost and disappeared into this divination club.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, on the other side, in the Sega Tavern in the slums, a group of people from the Office of Strategic Deception were also discussing plans to take down this Virtual Realm.</p>

    <p>After hearing about the Will Guard, everyone in the Office of Strategic Deception became interested.</p>

    <p>"The Guardian of the Will, right?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming raised his eyebrows through Jia Bugui's body and said: "This method of monitoring will is a long-standing speculation in the core area."</p>

    <p>"Yes. This was confirmed after I lurked here for a long time. However, this will guard is ineffective against those of us who infiltrate here from outside. It is only a potential deterrent to the local residents here." Xiang Yi replied.</p>

    <p>Then everyone turned their attention to Wang Ming...</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was stared at a little and said: "You don't have to look at me like this. I am not a mole. Although I am controlling Jia Bugui's body now, the brain wave signal cannot be captured by the will guard. The other party captures it. It's still a signal that Jia Bugui is in trouble. But now, Jia Bugui's state is like sleeping. So it won't arouse suspicion."</p>

    <p>"So, is there any way, Mr. Wang Ming, to access Jia Bugui's will?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi asked almost in unison. Their ideas coincided with each other at this time.</p>

    <p>They looked at each other and smiled.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming also immediately understood what the two people meant.</p>

    <p>If Jia Bugui's brainwaves could be manipulated to release false signals, this would be an almost perfect cover-up for their group's next actions...</p>

    <p>But such an operation is not without its technical difficulties.</p>

    <p>Because once Wang Ming's brain waves interfere with Jia Bugui's brain waves, the two brain waves will merge into one. There is a risk of exposure if you are not careful.</p>

    <p>"Let me try."</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ming slowly closed his eyes.</p>

    <p>He hypnotized himself countless times in his mind. At the same time, he muttered: "I am Jia Bugui...I am Jia Bugui...I am Jia Bugui..."</p>

    <p>"Brother Zhuo, where is Mr. Ming?" Zhou Ziyi was puzzled.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi responded calmly: "Don't you understand? He is trying to hypnotize his own brain waves first. To ensure that there are no other risks after intervention."</p>

    <p>In fact, when Wang Ming started the operation, not only Zhuo Yi. Even Lord Diulei, Er Ha, Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi were also deeply shocked.</p>

    <p>This is obviously just an ordinary person...</p>

    <p>But such an ordinary person with no spiritual power at all can actually develop the power of his brain to such an extent.</p>

    <p>It's so terrifying.</p>

    <p>Lie a thousand times and it becomes true.</p>

    <p>To deceive others.</p>

    <p>You have to deceive yourself first...</p>
