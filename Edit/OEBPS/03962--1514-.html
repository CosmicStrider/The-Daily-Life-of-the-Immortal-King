  <h1>Chapter 1514 Wang Ling is injured</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"You...are you a human or a ghost..."</p>

    <p>The moment the clone's hand touched Akano Sekitora's head, the hair on Akano Sekitora's back stood up instantly.</p>

    <p>He subconsciously shrank his neck and tried to break free.</p>

    <p>However, the avatar's strength was too strong. Its small hands were like suction cups, holding his whole head in place like a bowling ball.</p>

    <p>Then lift it up.</p>

    <p>The clone is not a complete body. It does not have intelligence like Crispy Noodles Dao Lord.</p>

    <p>It's just the differentiation of a small amount of power within Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the little clone did not answer any questions from Akano Sekitora.</p>

    <p>He is a being without emotions.</p>

    <p>The strength in the little hands gradually increased.</p>

    <p>Akano Sekitora felt a splitting pain on the top of his head.</p>

    <p>"Don't...don't use such force. It hurts..." Akano Sekitora gasped in pain.</p>

    <p>His whole body was twitching. The feeling of struggle before death made him feel powerless in the face of everything.</p>

    <p>At the same time he also realized it.</p>

    <p>This "little monster" in front of me is serious!</p>

    <p>The other party really wants to kill me...</p>

    <p>"Help me quickly!"</p>

    <p>Akano Sekitora shouted feebly.</p>

    <p>As an outstanding cultivator of metallic spiritual roots, he has completely metalized his head to increase the strength of his physical body.</p>

    <p>At this time, Akano Sekitora's entire body was plated with a metallic color.</p>

    <p>However, this level of physical strength is still not enough in front of the power of the small clone.</p>

    <p>The clone had no emotions and no expression. Akano Sekitora couldn't even see what the clone looked like.</p>

    <p>It only gave him a terrifying outline that touched the depths of his soul.</p>

    <p>Faced with a little clone floating in front of his eyes, like a child or a devil.</p>

    <p>Akano Sekitora suddenly felt that the path of cultivation he had been pursuing for thousands of years was completely overturned at this moment...</p>

    <p>Together with the three views, they collapsed together.</p>

    <p>And at the moment when the little clone was about to use force to crush Akano Sekitora's head like a watermelon.</p>

    <p>The silver-skinned king next to him finally couldn't hold it any longer.</p>

    <p>He stretched out his hands and held out a very small magic weapon.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at it from the perspective of the small clone. He was shocked to find that it turned out to be a jet black top only the size of a table tennis ball.</p>

    <p>This is?</p>

    <p>There was doubt in his eyes. He felt that this jet black top looked familiar.</p>

    <p>And at this moment. Wang Ling suddenly felt that the perspective of the little clone became blurry.</p>

    <p>The moment the jet-black top rotates, countless rays that cannot be seen clearly by the naked eye are released.</p>

    <p>In the eyes of Wang Ling's King's Eyes, it is an extremely distorted pitch black ray. It directly forms a vortex. It seems to be able to absorb all the people's minds.</p>

    <p>It's not as fast as Wang Ling can react.</p>

    <p>Bang.</p>

    <p>The little clone was affected by gyro rays and was forced to disappear due to the imbalance in space.</p>

    <p>Eh?</p>

    <p>Is this that. The power of the black stone?</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling was surprised by this result.</p>

    <p>But he was sure that the rays released by that pitch black top originated from the black stone that Peng Xiren sacrificed.</p>

    <p>It's just that the special energy released by the top is far less powerful than the black stone.</p>

    <p>Send a clone there. Don't be surprised if it disappears.</p>

    <p>If it were the highest level "real clone" like Crispy Noodles Dao Lord, it would not be affected like this.</p>

    <p>When dealing with Akano Sekitora.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling controls the will of the clone.</p>

    <p>It made the little clone's movements always look slow and slow.</p>

    <p>In fact, he just wanted to see if Akano Sekitora and the silver-skinned king had any other trump cards.</p>

    <p>And the current harvest makes Wang Ling even more surprised.</p>

    <p>He has been searching for the whereabouts of the Black Stone.</p>

    <p>After Peng Xiren disappeared, Black Stone cut off the clues.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, during this trip abroad, he would find the "vine" he had always wanted to catch here again.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. The Silverskin King and Akano Sekitora used the black top to repel Wang Ling's clone.</p>

    <p>Both of their faces looked extremely ugly.</p>

    <p>The top is fused with the power of the black stone. The radiation caused is too strong.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren was holding the black stone. He suffered huge trauma every second. Not to mention Akano Sekitora and the silver-skinned king?</p>

    <p>The time just sacrificed was only a few seconds.</p>

    <p>The two of them actually fell down the moment their clones disappeared. Their faces turned pale and they vomited blood.</p>

    <p>The Silverskin King used up his last strength. He put two life-threatening elixirs into Akano Sekitora's mouth and drank them for himself.</p>

    <p>It took a while. As the medicine dissipated in the body, the two of them regained their ability to move.</p>

    <p>In less than 2 seconds, the two of them lost an average of more than 500 years of cultivation...</p>

    <p>"Are you crazy... to use something like this?"</p>

    <p>"There's nothing I can do. You were almost crushed to death by that little monster just now."</p>

    <p>The Silverskin King said: "Senior Peng said that this top is risky. But in order to save my life, I have to do it."</p>

    <p>"This is 500 years of cultivation..."</p>

    <p>"You can keep the green hills without worrying about having no firewood."</p>

    <p>The Silverskin King said: "This black top knocked back the monster's clone. The monster's body must also have suffered heavy damage! It's not just us who were injured!"</p>

    <p>"Yes." Akano Sekitora nodded: "Now. What should we do?"</p>

    <p>"We can only go to Senior Peng for help first." The Silverskin King said: "In addition, I suggest that we temporarily move the command headquarters to the space where Senior Peng is now..."</p>

    <p>"That place?" Akano Sekitora frowned: "But once we enter there, we will lose all abilities."</p>

    <p>"Same. Senior Peng doesn't have the ability now, right?"</p>

    <p>The silver-skinned king smiled bitterly.</p>

    <p>This is a helpless move.</p>

    <p>After all, they still have to avoid the monster's subsequent actions...</p>

    <p>To be on the safe side, it's better to hide and take command first.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the dormitory. Wang Ling once again locked the location information of Akano Sekitora and the Silverskin King.</p>

    <p>He did not continue to take action.</p>

    <p>Instead, they plan to take a long-term approach to catch big fish. Let's see their further actions.</p>

    <p>As for the injury mentioned by the Silverskin King.</p>

    <p>In fact, it is not an exaggeration.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is indeed injured.</p>

    <p>After all, that black stone could originally emit a strange ray that limited his power.</p>

    <p>I've been waiting for a long time. Of course Wang Ling will get it.</p>

    <p>And just now.</p>

    <p>In 2 seconds. Because of the jet black top containing the power of the black stone.</p>

    <p>It actually broke half a centimeter of Wang Ling's hair...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was stunned.</p>

    <p>It turns out. Is this what it feels like to be hurt...</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling was a little touched inside.</p>

    <p>After all, there aren't many people in this universe who can really hurt him.</p>

    <p>I am feeling emotional in my heart.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling suddenly received a reminder from Zhai Yin.</p>

    <p>It's almost midnight.</p>

    <p>At this point in time, the welcome party has ended. A text message from Zhai Yin at this time made Wang Ling frown slightly.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling summarizes the information about Zhai Yin.</p>

    <p>It said that several girls were walking towards his dormitory after the welcome party...</p>
