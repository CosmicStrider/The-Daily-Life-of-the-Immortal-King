  <h1>Chapter 2134 Wolong recruits envoys</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Although I have only known each other for a short time, from a few words between Wang Ling and Zhai Yin, I can clearly feel that Lao Huang himself has some attributes of a social cow. Moreover, he is also cheerful and optimistic.</p>

    <p>The world of Itinerant Immortal is too big. With so many friends having no time to obtain contact information in the real world, the direct account is gone. There are no player-dominated territories like sects and unions in the game world to serve as links. It's really hard to meet again.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong asked Lao Huang. He and many of his friends met in the process of wandering. They are all casual cultivators. They have not established a sect or union yet. They wanted to meet up to build one together. But his The account was directly stuck with a bug.</p>

    <p>Such a big world. After Lao Huang regained his account, he had already reached level 33. He still could not find his group of friends, nor the established player sect or union.</p>

    <p>"It's okay, Old Huang. If we are destined, we can always meet you." Sun Rong consoled him.</p>

    <p>She understands this feeling of being left behind alone, because she also lost her father and mother when she was very young. Fortunately, Sun Yiyuan, as her grandfather, gave her enough care to make up for her father's love and mother's love. She grew up healthy and safe.</p>

    <p>But regret is regret after all. Sun Rong knows that there is no way to make up for the missing part.</p>

    <p>The correct way is to turn this regret into motivation to move forward.</p>

    <p>Even if the two elders are gone and we cannot witness her inheriting the Huaguo Shuilian Group in the future, she will work hard to run her family's business better and not embarrass her parents. She will become a qualified successor and promoter.</p>

    <p>It can be said that this is the goal that Sun Rong has been pursuing all along. In the past, she thought that she had done a good job. With strong self-confidence, she was a shining little sun wherever she went.</p>

    <p>Then she suddenly met Wang Ling. Only then did she know what it means to have mountains beyond the mountains. Only then did she realize that sometimes making a fortune in silence is a choice.</p>

    <p>Human growth requires a process. Sun Rong feels that he has learned a lot from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But the question is. Where is Wang Ling now?</p>

    <p>"Look at you. You seem to have lost your friend too?" During the conversation, Lao Huang saw what Sun Rong meant.</p>

    <p>"Yes. We entered the game world together..." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"Hahahaha!" Lao Huang laughed immediately: "I have so many friends, and I have never met them again. Although you and your friend played the game together, you know the game world of Itinerant Immortal. How big is it? The probability of being assigned to the same map is very slim!"</p>

    <p>"But you have been using experience to get to such a high level. If your friend's development cannot keep up, I'm afraid it will be difficult to meet each other in the future."</p>

    <p>"So I really want to ask what the hell this level 1 general is... It feels like a bug!"</p>

    <p>"Yeah! I think so too!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong looked at Wang Ling in front of him who had been leading the way. His eyes showed suspicion again.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's pace always maintained a consistent pace. He admitted that while walking, he felt as if the back of his head was being penetrated by Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"I have never heard of your newbie plot. It feels like a new path that can be quickly upgraded. So, your current task is to help this general develop the town? I can help!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong nodded. Then he opened the system operation interface directly in front of Lao Huang and shared the vision: "Look. This is the currently controllable force."</p>

    <p>Lao Huang glanced at the town sand table displayed by Sun Rong. When he saw the deployment of troops, he was shocked.</p>

    <p>"Hua Tia! All 2,000 troops are deployed in the city. Nearly 5,500 demon spirits are working outside? It's interesting..."</p>

    <p>Old Huang was stunned.</p>

    <p>He had never heard of this method of map creation. He had discussed the subsequent development issues after gaining control of a town when he was hanging out with his friends.</p>

    <p>One of them mentioned the concept of using demon spirits as labor force. Mainly, this method can minimize the food consumption in the city. It is equivalent to using demon spirits for free.</p>

    <p>Moreover, demon spirits will not be counted in the stamina loss.</p>

    <p>But the disadvantage is that if the town itself has a certain level, the degree of crowding out of the demon clan by the urban citizens will also become higher. And to develop a medium-sized city, at least 20,000 to 30,000 laborers must be allocated to collect outside every day. resources.</p>

    <p>If these two or thirty thousand people are demon spirits, it will greatly reduce the happiness index of the residents of medium-sized towns, causing the city to fall into chaos.</p>

    <p>So for this plan, the best place to experiment is in Xinshou Village.</p>

    <p>There are not that many residents in novice towns. Even if someone has opinions, the number will not be that large. And the residents' familiarity with the demon clan can be cultivated.</p>

    <p>The thinking of a medium-sized town is solidified and cannot be changed so easily. But in the process of urban upgrading, if the demon tribe intervenes to help with the construction, there is a high probability that the residents here will change their views on the demon tribe.</p>

    <p>To put it bluntly, we have to start from the beginning to get the residents used to this kind of life where humans and monsters coexist harmoniously.</p>

    <p>But just like what Mr. Zanghu analyzed before. How could a novice villager, a normal novice player, have the ability to directly destroy the Ten-hole Demon Lord and the Hundred-hole Demon Lord directly in the Novice Village...</p>

    <p>But now, this wild and unrealistic idea at the beginning was actually caught by him. Lao Huang thought it was all so interesting.</p>

    <p>So he decided to stay and help.</p>

    <p>"In this case, you recruit me. Let me become the first Wolong in your town! Will this also help the town's rating?" So, Lao Huang volunteered.</p>

    <p>"Eh? Is that okay, Lao Huang? If you are Wolong here, then you are bound to this place!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was surprised by Lao Huang's decision.</p>

    <p>To be Wolong, of course, you have to wait for Wolong in a high-level town to gain benefits.</p>

    <p>No one would choose to be a Wolong in Novice Village.</p>

    <p>And no one can guarantee that this novice village can develop.</p>

    <p>"Yes! And my participation can also check and balance the happiness index of the town to a certain extent. At least it can make those residents who are afraid of the demon tribe feel a little more at ease."</p>

    <p>Lao Huang said.</p>

    <p>When a high-level player who far exceeds the level of the Novice Village map joins, and his overall combat power score is no less than 100,000 points, this sense of solid security is truly indescribable.</p>

    <p>"What are you doing standing there? Recruiting!" Old Huang said.</p>

    <p>"Eh... I've just played this game... I don't know how to do it..." Sun Rong stared at the complex system sandbox in front of him, lost in thought.</p>

    <p>"You have to do this first, then this, then that..." Lao Huang gave step-by-step instructions based on the shared sandbox screen Sun Rong. He was very patient and relied on his experienced experience to give guidance.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong learned it after reading it once. It seems to be a complicated control interface. In fact, after Lao Huang's analysis, it is far less complicated than imagined.</p>

    <p>Finally, under the guidance of Lao Huang. Sun Rong completed the recruitment of Lao Huang according to Lao Huang's instructions.</p>

    <p>And almost at the same time. Wang Ling saw that he had unlocked another hidden achievement identity.</p>

    <p>When this hidden achievement identity reward popped up in front of Wang Ling's eyes, Wang Ling himself was stunned for a moment.</p>

    <p>[System: Congratulations on recruiting a Wolong player with a level B level]</p>

    <p>[System: You have unlocked the Charming City Lord achievement (successfully recruited a Wolong who is more than 30 levels higher than you). And unlocked a hidden identity]</p>

    <p>[System: Congratulations on obtaining the hidden achievement identity: Wolong Recruiter (this identity comes with special skills bonus)]</p>

    <p>[Wolong Recruitment Envoy]</p>

    <p>[Specialty: When you recruit Wolong, all costs consumed are reduced by 50%. At the same time, your town will be able to recruit Wolong that matches the town level and is one level higher (that is, if your town is a D-level city, it will be considered recruitable) to Wolong of C-level city quality). And increase the probability of recruiting high-level Wolong by 3%]</p>
