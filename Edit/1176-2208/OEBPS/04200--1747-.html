  <h1>Chapter 1747 A big secret learned by chance</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At the door. In the end, Jiang Xiaoche didn't have the guts to open the door and go in. He came to see Sun Yiyuan this time to confirm the donation of resources from the border area...</p>

    <p>In order to ensure that the frontier cultivators who defend their homeland have sufficient physical fitness and nutrition, this time the Huaguo Shuilian Group exported a total of ten tons of donated materials to major border areas for the first time. A pill only weighs more than a dozen grams. Ten tons is a huge amount.</p>

    <p>Border defense is a matter of great importance. No carelessness is allowed. All materials must be followed up in a timely manner.</p>

    <p>There is a widely circulated saying on the Internet: "While I was eating white rice and drinking happy water, I couldn't figure out why these strong and healthy soldiers died. I woke up late at night and suddenly remembered that they died for me..."</p>

    <p>In recent years, Huaguo Shuilian Group, as a domestic enterprise in Huaxiu with strong financial resources, has never fallen behind in donating materials to border areas.</p>

    <p>And materials in this area always go through the green channel. There is no need to report at all levels. As long as the materials are ready, the vehicle can be sent out immediately for material handover.</p>

    <p>However, according to normal corporate procedures, Jiang Xiaoche still has to talk to Sun Yiyuan...</p>

    <p>But he never expected that he would hear a big secret that made his soul explode.</p>

    <p>At this time, everyone in the company is gone. Almost no one can enter the chairman's office level. It seems that Boss Sun himself is a bit negligent. He did not expect that Jiang Xiaoche would suddenly come to see him at this time.</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche also fell into a state of petrification for a while while listening to the conversation in the room.</p>

    <p>He felt like his breathing had stopped. After waiting for several minutes, his legs reacted first. He hurriedly escaped from the Huaguo Building. Then he remained petrified in the car for several minutes...</p>

    <p>The eldest lady...has a child?</p>

    <p>And it's with Wang Ling?</p>

    <p>His mind was filled with the "Black question mark" emoji and the "Grandpa on the subway looking at his cell phone" emoji...</p>

    <p>Although he did hear something recently. It was said that Mr. Boss Sun had been in and out of the company at irregular times recently because he had to spend time with a child.</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche originally thought this was the child of a relative in the Sun family. Who knows, it turned out to be the eldest lady's child...</p>

    <p>So when Jiang Xiaoche learned this big secret, he had to admit one thing. That was that he was shocked...or, more appropriately, he was frightened.</p>

    <p>I thought that secretly giving birth to a child and shocking everyone would only happen in the entertainment industry with chaotic relationships... But in the end, this happened to me???</p>

    <p>No matter what, it's a big deal.</p>

    <p>And for Huaguo Shuilian Group, it is definitely a huge scandal. If it is exposed, Jiang Xiaoche can't believe how the stock price will plummet tomorrow.</p>

    <p>"Nice guy...Wang Ling...I didn't expect you to be so negligent as to allow the matter to come to my attention." At this time, Jiang Xiaoche's thoughts suddenly changed.</p>

    <p>As one of the employees of the company, he certainly doesn't want this matter to be exposed, because it will also have an impact on his work. But from the perspective of a love rival and the various grievances left before, he really can't wait to seize it. The tail end of this matter. Let's take a look at Wang Ling's panicked appearance after being caught.</p>

    <p>But to get to that point, it's useless to just rely on him to say it. He also needs sufficient evidence to support it.</p>

    <p>Then, he quickly changed into a newly purchased private car. He parked the car at the bottom of Huaguo Building and squatted to watch Sun Yiyuan come out.</p>

    <p>He took out his mobile phone and remotely controlled all the surveillance and recording systems at the entrance of Huaguo Building. He tried to capture Wang Muyu's face from multiple directions and angles.</p>

    <p>Not long after, Sun Yiyuan drove his car out of the underground parking lot.</p>

    <p>Because he had taken care of the baby for the past two days, Sun Yiyuan didn't ask Jiang Xiaoche to be the driver. Jiang Xiaoche was still confused at first, because he had known Sun Yiyuan for so many years. The old man rarely drove by himself.</p>

    <p>But now, it all makes sense...</p>

    <p>Now sitting in the car with him.</p>

    <p>But his great-grandson... can he be treated the same? The handover footage of the car passing by all the surveillance cameras lasted only a few seconds. Jiang Xiaoche's phone immediately synchronized to the video captured in those few seconds. Thousands of high definition photos.</p>

    <p>But most of the photos are useless. Because the car has a reflective hidden structure, you can't actually see the inside of the car from the outside.</p>

    <p>But Jiang Xiaoche's luck is pretty good. Because just recently, a camera with a reflective and hidden structure was installed outside the Huaguo Building...</p>

    <p>Finally, from thousands of photos, Jiang Xiaoche finally took a profile picture of Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>And after seeing Wang Muyu's appearance clearly, his hands couldn't help but start to tremble.</p>

    <p>This...</p>

    <p>These familiar dead fish eyes...</p>

    <p>And this familiar face!</p>

    <p>Isn't this just Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>Even if he only took half of his face in profile, he could directly draw the image symmetrically in his mind. Jiang Xiaoche could immediately overlay Wang Muyu's face with Wang Ling's.</p>

    <p>This can no longer be said to be evidence...</p>

    <p>But a serious hammer!</p>

    <p>Good guy Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>If you don't die this time, I'll write my name backwards!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Duobao City, Songhai City. This is the largest affordable second-hand magic weapon trading market in Songhai City. Many people can buy the second-hand magic weapons they want here. They can even find some top-notch goods at very cheap prices.</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche is also one of the old members of Duobao City. But in fact, in addition to trading second-hand magic weapons, Duobao City also has a hidden information trading channel that only old members know about.</p>

    <p>After putting on the mask and cloak for disguise, Jiang Xiaoche entered from a secret passage hidden in an alley in Duobao City. He confirmed the password, which led to the underground intelligence trading market.</p>

    <p>"I have a message to drop."</p>

    <p>In front of the transaction window, Jiang Xiaoche said mysteriously. Then he sent the photo he took: "I don't know how much this news is worth."</p>

    <p>This is a photo that has been processed by Jiang Xiaoche. It only shows the profile of Wang Muyu. The part of Boss Sun was cut off by him.</p>

    <p>"It's just a kid. How much is it worth?" The boss in charge of acquiring intelligence, nicknamed Tengu, dressed in a suit and wearing a Jason mask, wiped a glass of red wine at the counter, glanced at the photo, and asked with a lack of interest.</p>

    <p>"A sixteen-year-old boy. He secretly gave birth to a child after forcibly having sex with a girl..."</p>

    <p>"Oh? That's interesting."</p>

    <p>Tengu stared at the photo and thought for a while. He looked at Jiang Xiaoche. Then said: "This news is worth 20 million."</p>

    <p>"So much? Doesn't the boss even ask who this young man is?"</p>

    <p>"This is what we do. Do you know who it is?"</p>

    <p>Tengu smiled: "If you agree, we can arrange the transfer immediately. But you have to keep the photo."</p>

    <p>"Of course!" Jiang Xiaoche smiled: "As long as I can bring that person into disrepute. I don't need money, it's fine!"</p>

    <p>Ten minutes later, the transaction was completed.</p>

    <p>A remittance of 20 million was directly transferred to Jiang Xiaoche's private account abroad.</p>

    <p>"Well, thank you for your business. I hope you can provide better information next time." Tengu looked at Jiang Xiaoche's leaving back and said with a meaningful smile.</p>

    <p>"Boss. Is this photo worth 20 million?"</p>

    <p>After he left, a boy came up and asked.</p>

    <p>"It's just this photo. Of course it's not worth it. But do you know who the person who just left is?"</p>

    <p>"Who is it?"</p>

    <p>"Jiang Xiaoche." Tiangu smiled: "The secretary-general of Sun Yiyuan, chairman of Huaguo Shuilian Group. And according to the investigation, he has always had a good impression of his own lady. If my guess is correct, it is the child in the photo he provided this time. It is the child of his young lady and that sixteen-year-old boy."</p>

    <p>"This...that eldest lady has a child?"</p>

    <p>"A rich lady of a big company gave birth to a child out of wedlock. Isn't the value of this news much better than that of a sixteen-year-old boy giving birth to a child?"</p>

    <p>Under the mask, Tengu smiled slightly: "However, there is still a lack of qualitative evidence on this matter. Immediately send someone to follow the young lady and see if we can find any clues. If there is ironclad evidence, I believe this news will be felt by many business bosses. Interest."</p>
