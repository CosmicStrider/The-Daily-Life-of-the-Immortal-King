  <h1>Chapter 1938 I am sworn in with sin!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In the early morning of Wednesday, January 15th. As a famous city that never sleeps around the world, the brightly lit city streets of Songhai City were accompanied by the deep horn sound of the Hongmeng. It added a bit of hustle and bustle to the brilliant night.</p>

    <p>This is the first time since the Foundation organized a sneak attack on the Office of Strategic Deception that the disciples of the Office of Strategic Deception have implemented a large-scale combat plan under the guidance of an official headquarters.</p>

    <p>The disciples of the Office of Strategic Deception were wearing uniforms of light blue Office of Strategic Deception uniforms. Except for those who had necessary tasks, everyone took out the spirit sword in unison the moment they heard the order. They stepped on the spirit sword and navigated the city. Walking with the sword. Begin to return to the sect.</p>

    <p>Their movements are uniform. They have undergone the most rigorous training under the unified teachings of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Although the Office of Strategic Deception has not been around for a long time, all the disciples of the Office of Strategic Deception always have a sense of collective sect honor. This is something that many other modern sects cannot achieve.</p>

    <p>"Ugh..."</p>

    <p>The Hongmeng Horn sounded a total of twelve times. When the twelve Hongmeng Horn sounds landed, the disciples of the Office of Strategic Deception in Zhengyang Square had been neatly arranged into dozens of square formations.</p>

    <p>They gathered from their respective peaks. Some came back from the city. They all gathered the moment they heard the Hongmeng. Everyone carried a spiritual sword on their back and a medicine gourd tied around their waist. They were prepared to be serious.</p>

    <p>"The first batch of rapid response troops has been assembled! Please give instructions from the great elder!" A chief peak elder turned to Fang Xing and asked for instructions.</p>

    <p>The moment Fang Xing appeared, many of the disciples in the Office of Strategic Deception felt a little dazzled. It was because he had an extremely young face. His beautiful appearance made many people's hearts flutter.</p>

    <p>It is something that Fang Xing must do to appear in the sect in a feminine state. This is because it can conceal his identity as a student in his male form. The disciples of the sect are full of eyes and ears. If he faces the disciples of the sect in his male form, maybe it will happen. Cause unnecessary trouble.</p>

    <p>Many disciples from various peaks below have hardly seen the identities of the sect's founding elders during their daily training. Fang Xing is one of them. He has to study at Number 60 High School on weekdays, so there is even less opportunity to see him.</p>

    <p>This time, she appeared in a feminine form, wearing a snow-white dress. Her graceful figure shocked everyone here.</p>

    <p>Some disciples were discussing quietly below.</p>

    <p>"What is the name of this great elder? Why have I never seen him before?"</p>

    <p>"Don't look up for too long! It's so rude! This is the legendary Elder Fang Xing."</p>

    <p>"It turns out it's her...the Grand Elder Jianzong who doesn't have an avatar on the public list on the Office of Strategic Deception website!"</p>

    <p>"Yes! She has been here since the founding of the sect. The status of the great elder of the founding sect is not comparable to that of other elders of other peaks. Even the seniors who were later promoted to the position of great elders must respect the great elders of the founding sect."</p>

    <p>At this point in the conversation, the surrounding disciples all lowered their heads after hearing this. Everyone had respect and excitement on their faces.</p>

    <p>This is the great elder during the founding of the sect!</p>

    <p>What a distinguished position!</p>

    <p>Rumor has it that everyone is chatting and laughing with Sect Master Diulei on weekdays!</p>

    <p>At this time, Grand Elder Jianzong personally came forward to direct the battle. This sense of honor made everyone feel relieved.</p>

    <p>In fact, even Fang Xing did not expect that his appearance this time would cause such a huge response and sensation.</p>

    <p>This just proves that the management system within the Office of Strategic Deception is strict on weekdays. The management hierarchy is very clear. The disciples at the bottom can't see the elders at the top, but they can see them at this juncture of collective fighting. It is indeed very easy to move people.</p>

    <p>"This time, I will carry out simple pre-war mobilization."</p>

    <p>After waiting for a while, until the whole place fell silent, Fang Xing finally spoke.</p>

    <p>In her feminine form, her voice was cold, beautiful, yet majestic: "I believe some people have heard of it. Our target this time is the Jiutian Jingmi Institute in Songhai City."</p>

    <p>"Everyone knows that Jiutian Jingmi Academy is an official organization that specializes in recruiting outstanding young cultivators from all over the country."</p>

    <p>"It is said that if young people are strong, the country will be strong. And the duty of the Jingmi Academy is to recruit young cultivation geniuses and train them. And so that these young people can be integrated into the system in the future, win glory for the country, and become the mainstay of our Huaxiu country!"</p>

    <p>"It can be said that the existence of Jiutian Jingmi Academy is a pillar for young people to rise!"</p>

    <p>"And now, according to reliable information, right under the nose of our Office of Strategic Deception, a group of criminals have invaded the Jiutian Jingmi courtyard! They are quite powerful and have a large number of people! I just want to ask you guys from the Office of Strategic Deception. What to do!"</p>

    <p>All the disciples in the square looked at each other for a while. Then whoever opened his mouth first shouted loudly: "Of course! I am sworn in with sin!"</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, all the disciples around him clenched their fists and became excited, shouting in unison.</p>

    <p>"I am sworn in with sin!"</p>

    <p>"I am sworn in with sin!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Fang Xing nodded with satisfaction. Then he waved his hand: "Listen to my order. Let's go!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, in the Jiutian Jingmi courtyard, Teng Luchen still didn't know what was about to happen. He stared at the screen with interest. He quietly looked at the face of Wang Ling. He wanted to see the spirit beast. In the case of encirclement. How will Wang Ling behave?</p>

    <p>The sudden attack by this gang of gangsters actually helped him a lot. It gave him the opportunity to test the true strength of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Now that he is about to succeed, Teng Luchen is filled with excitement.</p>

    <p>There should be no other people to disturb us. After all, this matter has not disturbed the police yet. No one knows that Jiutian Jingmi Courtyard is currently being hijacked.</p>

    <p>As long as he confirms the strength of Wang Ling, he will immediately counterattack and suppress all these gangsters.</p>

    <p>"Little guy. He's hidden deep enough..."</p>

    <p>He believed that his vision would not be wrong.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling. It must be the genius he has been looking for...</p>

    <p>At this time, the oasis was surrounded by a large number of high-level spiritual beasts. Due to the request of this gang of gangsters, the sound was turned off. Teng Luchen could not hear the command situation inside the oasis for the time being.</p>

    <p>But he also noticed that at the call of that classmate Rokume Akahoko, almost all the elite high school students were mobilized.</p>

    <p>This is also a rare piece of information.</p>

    <p>It seems that this Rokume Akahoko has been hiding before. He does not have the appeal like now...</p>

    <p>The change in appeal between before and now is also a change that occurred after the arrival of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen felt that this further confirmed his idea.</p>

    <p>Because he also observed at the same time. This classmate Rokume Akahoko had a brief exchange with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>In other words. Perhaps the real organizer behind the scenes is none other than Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Rokume Akahoko might be delivering the order on his behalf!</p>

    <p>"Come on...classmate Wang Ling..."</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen's face was calm. He said this in his heart. Thoughts were flying in his mind. He kept trying to figure out everything about Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>While he was staring at the screen intently.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, the alarm sounded in Jiutian Jingmi Hospital!</p>

    <p>This group of criminals did not trigger any alarms when they invaded before. But at this important moment, they sounded like a symphony!</p>

    <p>At this time, Jiutian Jingmi Academy has been surrounded by all disciples of the Office of Strategic Deception!</p>

    <p>The entire building has been blocked by disciples of the Office of Strategic Deception!</p>

    <p>No one can escape from the building!</p>

    <p>"What's going on?"</p>

    <p>The gangster leader who used the golden wind to push against Teng Luchen was also shocked.</p>

    <p>He hasn't figured out what's going on yet.</p>

    <p>Behind, there was a sudden "boom" from the door of the command room!</p>

    <p>Then dozens of Office of Strategic Deception disciples poured in directly!</p>

    <p>And the person leading the charge was none other than Fang Xing in his feminine state!</p>

    <p>One by one, they were holding their spiritual swords as if they were beaten to death, and they were shouting excitedly.</p>

    <p>"Control the gangsters! Save Mr. Teng!"</p>

    <p>"Kill! I am inseparable from evil!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen: "???"</p>
