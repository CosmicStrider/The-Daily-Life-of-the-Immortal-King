  <h1>Chapter 2061 Know nothing about the basics.</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Qiao Yanyuan's tyranny was beyond the imagination of everyone here. He opened his Dragonborn and cut off the arm of Saint Number 6 without any effort.</p>

    <p>This caused Saint Number 6 to immediately put on a mask of pain on his face. Because it seemed that he was the one who was injured last time!</p>

    <p>As the youngest member of the Holy Order and nicknamed "Gui Laoliu" the group's favorite, he immediately suggested to the Holy King that, in order to avoid further trouble, two new guardians should be selected from among the first-class saints of the next level to strengthen the power of the Holy Tribe and maintain the stability of the Holy Star. These two guardians would then be promoted to the Holy King's order through the infusion of the Holy Tribe's secret power.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the current number of guardians under the Holy Throne has been changed from the previous six to eight. There are two people supporting him at the back. Gui Laoliu thought that even if he fights again in the future, the probability of being injured should be lower.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, Qiao Yanyuan cut off his arm directly in the temple without giving any face to him. His blood was sprinkled in the temple.</p>

    <p>This is in front of the Holy King!</p>

    <p>At this point, the current eight saints all have shocked expressions on their faces. One of their arms has been cut off in the Human Ancestor realm. It is just physical pain. It may not be anything to the six saints. But Qiao Yanyuan's behavior is... to Provoke the Holy Clan. And he did it after the Holy King persuaded them to make peace.</p>

    <p>This is a slap in the face of the entire holy race!</p>

    <p>But Qiao Yanyuan had the capital.</p>

    <p>The six realms of the Ancestor Realm. Starting from the Dao Ancestor Realm, there are Human Ancestor, Earthly Ancestor, Heavenly Ancestor, Ancestor King, Ancestor Immortal... Each realm is separated by a huge span.</p>

    <p>Eons ago, Dao Ancestor Wang, the founder of Heavenly Dao, was extremely powerful. But at that time, Dao Ancestor had just entered the ancestral realm. He was the first person in legend to touch the ancestral realm.</p>

    <p>If Dao Ancestor Wang is still alive, now no one knows which level of the six realms of the ancestral realm he can hit.</p>

    <p>They are the Saints of the Holy Clan and the powerful Human Ancestors. The three of them worked together, but they couldn't even shake Qiao Yanyuan's separated soul.</p>

    <p>That at least proves that Qiao Yanyuan is at least an Earthly Ancestor. Maybe even an Ancestor King!</p>

    <p>"Mr. Qiao came to our Holy Star without saying hello. And after I persuaded him to make peace, he continued to attack the Holy Lord who is under my command. Could it be that he is bullying my Holy Clan?"</p>

    <p>After a long silence, the Holy King finally spoke. Under the golden mask, the Holy King's cape exuded a dazzling light. Even the eternal cloak behind him changed color, showing the Holy King's wrath. The entire temple was suddenly shrouded in a huge majesty and pressure.</p>

    <p>But he did not attack Qiao Yanyuan directly, because the Holy King knew very well that this time Qiao Yanyuan came to visit. Apart from the so-called reminder, the biggest purpose was to show his face in front of his Holy Clan.</p>

    <p>Therefore, establishing prestige is extremely important.</p>

    <p>If he really doesn't care about his status as a holy king. Since he has the ability to cut off the arm of the Human Ancestor with only his physical dragon wings, then he has the ability to directly cut off the head of Gui Laoliu.</p>

    <p>And Qiao Yanyuan's move also made the Holy King realize that the Holy Lord under him seemed to be a little insufficient.</p>

    <p>After Qiao Yanyuan left, he had to continue to expand.</p>

    <p>At this moment, he only expressed his dissatisfaction, but did not take action. In fact, he did not want to directly break up with Bai Zhe.</p>

    <p>"Holy King, calm down. Fists and kicks have no eyes. It was just a sparring match."</p>

    <p>"Haha. In my opinion, Mr. Qiao is looking for trouble."</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry to speak frankly. If you deliberately seek trouble, these eight saints of His Royal Highness will all die in the temple at this moment."</p>

    <p>Qiao Yanyuan spoke domineeringly. There was a coldness in his eyes. It was hard to believe that he was just a soul.</p>

    <p>He finished speaking with disdain. Then he opened his hand and directly drew the staff from the hand of a saint in front of him.</p>

    <p>"How outrageous! Why don't you come back!" Saint Number 1, who had his staff taken away, said anxiously.</p>

    <p>"Shut up. Isn't that embarrassing enough?"</p>

    <p>The Holy King's eyes were filled with contempt. He immediately told the Holy Lord Number 1 to shut up. "You can't even hold the staff steady... I will settle the score with you later."</p>

    <p>"Lord Holy King, calm down..." All the Holy Lords knelt down one after another. Their movements were uniform.</p>

    <p>Qiao Yanyuan was pointing the end of the staff into the void as a javelin. Then he opened his body and threw it suddenly. At the same time, there was a mysterious smile on his face: "First time we meet. This is my gift to His Highness the Holy King."</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The staff he threw directly pierced the sky wall of the temple and flew straight into the sky. Then the staff suddenly stopped and directly pierced the mysterious thing hidden in the sky.</p>

    <p>"There is really something..." The great saints were also quite surprised. This mysterious thing was hidden in the sky above their temple. But none of the eight of them noticed it.</p>

    <p>"This is." At this point, the Holy King narrowed his eyes and began to ask about the origin of this mysterious object.</p>

    <p>"It is said that the most powerful person in the universe was born from chaos. There are forty-nine pairs in total. Each pair of eyes has special power."</p>

    <p>Qiao Yanyuan looked at the minced meat that was chased down from the sky. He smiled and said: "As the Holy King has seen, this pupil hovering above the Holy Star is exactly the Taoist Eye Number 03. It is also called the real spiritual eye of reproduction." The appearance is silvery white. The pupils are crescent-shaped. It has strong copying ability."</p>

    <p>"He is very cunning. He copied Cosmic Embryo's signal with this Number 03, trying to focus the attention of those cosmic races that also covet Cosmic Embryo on the Saint Race."</p>

    <p>Qiao Yanyuan explained: "Not only that. He also asked Pupil Number 03 to simulate the spiritual information of the creatures of the Holy Star. Therefore, he can confuse the fake with the real, so that no one can detect it. And this is the so-called mystery of the authorities."</p>

    <p>These words, after all, took some of the Holy King's face into consideration and made the Holy King's anger calm down a bit.</p>

    <p>Qiao Yanyuan continued: "As an ally, this is my gift to the Holy King. Although we can't do anything to the man named Wang at the moment, at least for now, he has lost a pair of the strongest weapons in the universe. A comprehensive battle against him his strength is also weakened."</p>

    <p>"Then do you know where the remaining pupils are?" the Holy King narrowed his eyes and asked.</p>

    <p>"These legendary things in the universe are on the same level as the miracles of the universe. They are all caused by huge immortal luck. It is impossible to find them. The universe is too vast. Who knows where they are scattered."</p>

    <p>"But I have heard that this boy is very good at collecting cards. He has the habit of collecting cards. Maybe there are other powerful men in the universe." The Holy King pondered.</p>

    <p>When Qiao Yanyuan said this, he couldn't help but laugh: "Okay, let's take a step back. Even if there really is, it's impossible to collect them all. This is a legendary thing in the universe. I just don't believe it. He can put forty-nine Collect them all. Haha. If there are any, I will just crush them..."</p>

    <p>The Holy King smiled: "So. Today, Mr. Qiao's soul left his body and broke into the temple of our Holy Clan. Just to help my Holy Clan pull out an eye?"</p>

    <p>"Of course there are other things."</p>

    <p>When Qiao Yanyuan said this, he couldn't help but laugh: "Alright, let's say there really are some. It's still impossible to collect them all. These are legendary items from the universe. I just don't believe he can collect all 49 pairs. Haha, if there are any, I'll just crush them again..."</p>

    <p>Holy King: "If they want to attack my Holy Star, I will destroy them all."</p>

    <p>"This is the second thing I came to see the Holy King for."</p>

    <p>Qiao Yanyuan put his hands behind his back. He looked at the Holy King and said, "You might as well take this opportunity to win them all over."</p>
