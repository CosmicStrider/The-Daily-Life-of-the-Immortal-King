  <h1>Chapter 2178 This may be the longest paragraph Wang Ling has ever said.</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The dragon-born magic weapon is a magic weapon that is refined by each dragon-born who inherits the dragon clan's orthodoxy based on his own soul. It can be understood as a kind of soul essence. It is a kind of magic weapon that is condensed from the depths of the soul and added to it. embodied existence.</p>

    <p>Each dragonborn magic weapon has its own special characteristics. It is as important as the chaos weapon. It is the most precious treasure of the dragonborn. It is linked to their dragon soul.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling made a Dragonborn magic weapon with his bare hands. Sun Rong feels that it can be summed up in eight words. That is "unexpected. It is reasonable."</p>

    <p>The young man in front of her has done too many miraculous things that violate the laws of modern human monks since she first realized them. There are so many miraculous things that cannot be explained by modern cultivation knowledge... Sun Rong is shocked in her heart. But This shock was only a little bit. Because this person was Wang Ling. So she felt that there was no need to make too much fuss.</p>

    <p>This is a space that can travel freely through the universe.</p>

    <p>Taking his younger sister, who is less than one year old, to go head-to-head with a man who is an outsider...</p>

    <p>Moreover, the reason why he took his sister to fight the alien gods was not because he couldn't defeat them. He just wanted to strengthen his sister a little and find some nutritious food to fill her stomach.</p>

    <p>Haha... what a warm-hearted brother!</p>

    <p>"That's not right! That's not the problem now, okay!" In just one second, Sun Rong's thoughts began to change from tranquility to erratic to crazy.</p>

    <p>It feels like everything in front of me is in line with reality but yet so unreal.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling opened his eyes. He saw Sun Rong's tangled look on his face. He had never used his mind telepathy before, and he immediately understood Sun Rong's thoughts.</p>

    <p>"Actually, it's not that difficult to create a dragonborn magic weapon."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling explained to Sun Rong through a voice transmission. He tried hard to think of the words, because this might be the longest sentence he had ever said to Sun Rong since he knew her.</p>

    <p>"The main thing here is to take into account the quantum entanglement between the dragon-born magic weapon and the laws of the universe. In fact, it is not complicated."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"The main thing is to find the key to open this Pandora's box. And to find the key, we must combine the existing chaotic energy based on dark matter."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Based on the Heavenly Dao Principle, we use non-modern cultivation scientific theoretical knowledge of infinite non-cyclic multi-dimensional space to achieve a change. Finally..."</p>

    <p>"Okay. Wang Ling..."Sun Rong made a stop gesture, preventing Wang Ling from explaining himself sincerely.</p>

    <p>She was very touched. Because it was the first time Wang Ling said so many words to herself.</p>

    <p>She knew every Chinese character, but for some reason she couldn't understand a single word when they were strung together.</p>

    <p>It can only be said that the young man was outrageous. He actually wanted to make himself understand through verbal explanation.</p>

    <p>No...</p>

    <p>In fact, even if you practice it in front of her, she may not be able to understand it, right?</p>

    <p>Let's talk about the Glazed Horn itself.</p>

    <p>This is a dragon-born magic weapon created by Wang Ling for Wang Muyu alone. It is also tailor-made for Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>This is not a summoning magic weapon. To be precise, it is a time magic weapon...</p>

    <p>Yes.</p>

    <p>The existence of the Glazed Horn, which means the power that can be released through the horn, has never strengthened Wang Muyu's Dharma Spirit.</p>

    <p>Therefore, this glazed dragon god was not summoned by Wang Muyu. It was Wang Muyu's original dharma spirit. It was only strengthened through this glazed horn. It directly borrowed power from the future and released it in advance.</p>

    <p>Doing this will directly consume a lot of spiritual energy and longevity...</p>

    <p>But this glass horn actually has no side effects on Wang Muyu at all. It's like Wang Ling bought a fund for Wang Muyu. The side effect of the glass horn is the risk of this fund. And all the profits go to Wang Muyu. All owned by me.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling's spiritual power and longevity are approaching infinite. Therefore, the risk is also zero.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu can use this glazed horn with confidence. And he doesn't have to pay any price.</p>

    <p>If Wang Muyu is given some time to grow, the little guy will become a powerful dragon god sooner or later.</p>

    <p>So when this Dharma Spirit that became the Dragon God in advance appeared, Qiao Yanyuan searched the history of the dragon clan, but found that there was a gap in his memory in his mind.</p>

    <p>But he had never thought that this glazed dragon god was actually transformed from Wang Muyu's own dharma spirit. This had exceeded the limit of knowledge that a creature in the universe could comprehend.</p>

    <p>After all, my imagination is too limited. I didn't expect Wang Ling's ability to be so great.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Shrinking the ground to an inch failed. Yifen's body was really panicked. This glazed dragon god could smash the space with just his sword energy. He forcibly made his pull invalid. I wanted to use the extreme pull to fight in a roundabout way. Through the long range He tried to test the waves and found a breakthrough. Now this idea died before it could be implemented.</p>

    <p>"Heaven and Earth Dragon Coffin!"</p>

    <p>In desperation, Qiao Yanyuan had to summon a brand new chaos device.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu could tell that this was a genuine summoning chaos device.</p>

    <p>Based on my own shallow experience, I can tell that my Glazed Horn is a summoning dragon-born magic weapon. So do I plan to summon a living being to fight against his ritual spirit, the Glazed Dragon God?</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu immediately figured out what the other party was thinking.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>The ancient black dragon coffin appeared across the sky like a phantom. Under the distorted space fluctuations, it created a strong contrast with the seven-colored core world.</p>

    <p>A corpse with a dragon head and human body appeared. It was filled with black energy. The dragon's claws were like iron hooks. It swung its dragon tail and swooped in the air. It attacked the Glazed Dragon God.</p>

    <p>There is a strong sense of weirdness in this scene. This person should not be a dragonborn, but he has the body of a dragon. It is as if he is a creature that has been reassembled by the creator. There is a violent and uncoordinated feeling all over his body.</p>

    <p>Chi!</p>

    <p>The Glazed Dragon God slashed out without any hesitation. It was destroyed on the corpse dragon's hook claws. It was so shocked that its hook claws turned into powder and exploded directly.</p>

    <p>The power of the Dragon God is so heaven-defying, domineering and fierce. This is just Wang Muyu's Dharma Spirit, but he has such a powerful combat capability.</p>

    <p>Generally speaking, the real body is stronger than the Dharma Spirit itself. If Wang Muyu can really develop to the point where he can summon the Dharma Spirit of the Glazed Dragon God, then his status in the Dragon Clan will be truly unshakable.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The Glazed Dragon God waved his sword and split a sea of seven-color fire in the void. This was a seven-color fire mixed with the power of the chaos of the universe. It was composed of the cosmic spiritual fire. It was roasting the corpse dragon.</p>

    <p>"Since your cremation is incomplete, let me burn you clean for you!" Wang Muyu's little face was very serious. He stared at the corpse dragon in the sky that was gradually surrounded by seven-color fire and was at a disadvantage. He was full of confidence.</p>

    <p>However, after the corpse dragon struggled in the seven-color fire for a while, as if it was familiar with the burning of the flames, it stopped struggling. In the end, it completely adapted to it, and strong black gas exploded in the air.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu can feel this black energy. It is a kind of negative emotion that has been accumulated for a long time and originates from the whole universe. Once affected by the black energy, the state of mind will be completely destroyed...</p>
