  <h1>Chapter 1989 The relationship between Wang Ling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The sentence "You and Wang Ling are very familiar" directly made Sun Rong slightly worried. Her face instantly turned red. But she still controlled herself as much as possible.</p>

    <p>"Why does Mr. Su think that Wang Ling and I are very familiar..."</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling's composition is very good. Didn't you set up a literary exchange organization specifically for classmate Wang Ling? You are also the president of the support club?" Su Xingyue said.</p>

    <p>"..." Sun Rong was shocked. She never expected that Su Xingyue knew directly that she was the Gray Cult leader.</p>

    <p>"How did you know about this?" Jiugong Liangzi crossed her arms. Her face began to show some hostility, and she looked at Su Xingyue with a cautious look.</p>

    <p>This is not something Su Xingyue should know. Of course, as the current president of the Shengke Student Union, and her past intelligence gathering ability, Su Xingyue must have a better grasp of intelligence information than ordinary people.</p>

    <p>"I didn't investigate on purpose. This is also the calculation result of the previous data pagoda... it hasn't been confirmed yet. But judging from your reactions, it should be right."</p>

    <p>Su Xingyue laughed: "Because there must be Wang Ling and classmate Sun Rong in the Number 60 High School competition before. In addition, there are also rumors about the two of them in the campus circles... so I thought about it. Why don't you input your reasoning into the data pagoda and let it calculate the results and see... Don't worry. I told you that the data has all been cleared."</p>

    <p>"You know, classmate Su, your behavior is actually very rude." Jiugong Liangzi criticized with a scrutinizing gaze.</p>

    <p>"You are all right in your criticisms. But I really didn't mean it."</p>

    <p>Su Xingyue lowered her head and sighed: "But now, I have no other choice. Because this time, Shengke is very likely to lose its place in the Earth Center Project because of Senior Brother Qu..."</p>

    <p>She said this. Sun Rong and Jiugong Liangzi immediately looked at each other.</p>

    <p>They had long expected this result.</p>

    <p>On the surface, Su Xingyue was interceding for Qu Shuling, but in fact, she came here just for the quota in Shengke.</p>

    <p>But this matter is really not something Sun Rong can get involved in.</p>

    <p>And she knows that man very well...</p>

    <p>The last thing Wang Ling wants to do is to wade in troubled waters and meddle in other people's business. Let him be a peacemaker. This is probably an unattainable dream...</p>

    <p>Of course. You can find Sun Rong in person. Of course Su Xingyue came prepared.</p>

    <p>Although she was not very familiar with Wang Ling, Su Xingyue had somewhat heard about Wang Ling's character.</p>

    <p>"High-tech quantum noodles..." At this time, she suddenly said.</p>

    <p>"What did you say?" Sun Rong thought she heard wrongly.</p>

    <p>"As long as classmate Wang Ling is willing to help, our scientific research department at Shengke will gather the elites of the entire hospital to create this crispy noodle that incorporates quantum technology for classmate Wang Ling..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"My classmate Wang Ling is also tired of eating dry noodles with various rare flavors. This kind of quantum flavor... Although I don't know what it tastes like, and I don't know if it tastes good or not. But classmate Wang Ling is sure to be interested! And this kind of dry noodles will be preserved forever without any preservatives. Maybe you can take one bite and it will be full of the flavor of the universe."</p>

    <p>"The taste of the universe..." Sun Rong and Jiugong Liangzi were dumbfounded. They never expected that Shengke would do this for the sake of quota.</p>

    <p>Gather the scientific research elites from all the institutes to study dry noodles...</p>

    <p>"Isn't this a bit big and trivial? Student Su... I don't think it's okay? I think scientific research should be focused on more useful things..." Sun Rong raised her head and said awkwardly.</p>

    <p>"Please rest assured, Ms. Sun. The so-called existence is reasonable. We study quantum crispy noodles. Essentially, it is to study quantum food technology. Therefore, quantum crispy noodles are the development target. In fact, it does not affect us as a whole."</p>

    <p>Su Xingyue said seriously. Then, she took out a jade tube directly from her arms. After injecting spiritual power, the jade tube began to play various digital codes and configuration diagrams in the void. Directly Sun Rong and Jiugong Liangzi were dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>"This is part of the information that can be made public. We are serious about it."</p>

    <p>Even Su Xingyue became serious as she spoke: "If quantum food technology can be born."</p>

    <p>"Theoretically, we can remotely supply cultivators. That is to say, even if there is a war in the future, through quantum food technology, we can remotely supply energy to cultivators on the battlefield. There is no need to waste any time." The taste of food will also be perfectly restored on the taste buds. It will feel like you are really eating something. Not only will it make people feel full, but it will also prevent you from getting fat!"</p>

    <p>I can only say that Su Xingyue is worthy of being Su Xingyue.</p>

    <p>As a talented young cultivator at the international level who is used to seeing big scenes, she is now the president of the student union of Shengke. Her eloquence is not something that can be underestimated.</p>

    <p>This generous speech is really moving...</p>

    <p>Even Sun Rong and Jiugong Liangzi were moved after hearing this.</p>

    <p>As eldest ladies, they remind themselves to stay in shape all the time. They cannot enjoy delicious food normally. They can only use elixirs to replace the body's energy.</p>

    <p>You can't enjoy the fun of delicious food at all.</p>

    <p>For girls, staying in shape is always the first priority...</p>

    <p>Seeing Sun Rong's throat rolling. Su Xingyue knew that this matter was most likely a drama: "That student Sun, it doesn't matter whether this matter will happen or not. I just want to express my concern to classmate Wang Ling..."</p>

    <p>"Ah, by the way. This technology can actually also be used for elixirs. For example, directly decomposing the elixirs and transmitting them to distant cultivators through quantum technology. In other words, if the technology is really successful and put into practice, our Shengke can also cooperate with Huaguo Shuilian Group."</p>

    <p>Hearing this. Sun Rong suddenly felt how scary Su Xingyue was.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong didn't expect that she would even take this step...</p>

    <p>As the future helmsman of the company, Sun Rong naturally cares about the future development of the Huaguo Shuilian Group.</p>

    <p>She took a few deep breaths and finally calmed down: "Okay, classmate Su. I will only help you this time... but if classmate Wang Ling doesn't agree, don't blame me."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry. Even if classmate Wang Ling doesn't agree. Even if we in Shengke really lose this precious place in the end, our friendship will last forever." At this point, Su Xingyue took the initiative to extend her hand.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi took the place of Sun Rong and shook her hand directly: "I hope that Ms. Su will be true to her appearance and that she will do what she says. Our Jiugong family also has a lot of criticisms against Shengke. I hope that the conflicts for many years can be resolved in the future."</p>

    <p>Originally, Su Xingyue thought that she had successfully set the pace.</p>

    <p>However, she never expected Jiugong Liangzi's move, which directly reduced her momentum to the bottom: "This is... natural... Jiugong, don't worry... look at my performance later. I will definitely not let you down. Won't be disappointed..."</p>

    <p>"Just like..."</p>

    <p>"Just with what?"</p>

    <p>"It's just like the second season of the Immortal King's Daily Life animation that started airing today. You won't be disappointed..."</p>

    <p>"I know this! Is it the domestic show where the author was sacrificed again in the first episode!"</p>

    <p>"Yes, yes! That's it! The author Ku Xuan died so tragically in the first episode... wu wu wu..."</p>
