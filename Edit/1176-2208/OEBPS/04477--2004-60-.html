  <h1>Chapter 2004: All 60 members broke through the Foundation Building's later peak plan</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng solved the matter perfectly. At the same time, the legendary God of Death, known as Crazy Demon Dai to the world, let go of the negative emotions that had been burdened on him for thousands of years.</p>

    <p>All of this is not an exaggeration to describe with the phrase "perfect merit." However, Wang Ling also noticed a problem at the same time. That is what Dai Tianchun said was the meteorite that came to the earth from an alien planet and was wrapped in a chaos device.</p>

    <p>In fact, the earth is invaded by many extraterrestrial meteorites from different galaxies every day. However, the vast majority of meteorites have been worn away when entering the atmosphere. The number of meteorites that can actually fall on the earth is very rare.</p>

    <p>Dai Tianchun thought that what was wrapped in the meteorite was just a powerful anti-realm magic weapon. But in fact, what was wrapped inside was a chaos weapon.</p>

    <p>This is enough to attract Wang Ling's attention.</p>

    <p>Because under normal circumstances, it is impossible for a chaos device to be wrapped in a meteorite. The six-element spirit armor is a super-god-level chaos device. The power of chaos emitted from it is enough to destroy the meteorite. Burned to ashes.</p>

    <p>This is like fire wrapped in paper. It is theoretically impossible. It is an operation that violates the natural rules of the universe.</p>

    <p>Of course, it would be easy to understand if there are human intervention factors.</p>

    <p>In other words, the meteorite wrapped in the Six-Yuan Spirit Armor was actually manufactured specifically to accommodate the Chaos Device. It was like a beautifully packaged express delivered by an express company. Someone had perfected the packaging and deliberately transported it to the earth.</p>

    <p>Previously, for safety reasons and also to prevent the earth from being peeked by alien creatures, Wang Ling used the "Great Shielding Technique" to establish a strong magnetic field, which tightly wrapped the entire earth.</p>

    <p>He knew that Bai Zhe and Fenmu Shen were monitoring the movement of the earth all the time. Therefore, Wang Ling on the earth was also on strict guard.</p>

    <p>But in the end, it's still a secret. Some people find loopholes in other ways...</p>

    <p>Using meteorites to directly transport objects to the earth. The situation becomes much more complicated.</p>

    <p>Who knows what is wrapped in this special stone?</p>

    <p>There may be chaos devices sealed inside. It may also contain other secret espionage instruments used to spy on the earth. It is even more likely to contain alien life forms that pose a certain potential threat to human cultivators on earth.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling knows. Bai Zhe is still in the stage of accumulating strength. He will not launch a large-scale war against the earth so soon. However, before that, it is still feasible to carry out some small actions from time to time.</p>

    <p>Its purpose is not for anything else. It is just to prevent Wang Ling's attention from focusing on him so quickly by constantly creating new troubles for the earth.</p>

    <p>In front of the desk. Wang Ling stroked the mahogany sword. The sword trembled slightly. Jingke quietly revealed his head from the table.</p>

    <p>He stared at Wang Ling. There was no wave on his face: "Hello, sword master. Calm down."</p>

    <p>"It looks like it's still the same as before. He had already expected that the group of people would make a series of small moves."</p>

    <p>Er Ha yawned and shook the fluorescent green dog hair all over his body. He said lazily.</p>

    <p>It feels that in comparison, the demon world is really lucky. At least it has been preserved.</p>

    <p>And the young man in front of him was so serious that he still didn't take action. That could only mean one thing.</p>

    <p>That's this man. Laying out...</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe thinks he can cause trouble to Wang Ling. But in fact, every move may be expected by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>They are operating behind closed doors over there, and they are also planning things out at the same time, just for the final battle.</p>

    <p>And the results are already obvious.</p>

    <p>That is, Bai Zhe will eventually be completely destroyed.</p>

    <p>Why not just eliminate the Bai people now?</p>

    <p>In fact, Jingke, Er Ha and Wang Ying present all have the answer in their minds.</p>

    <p>After all, the current Bai Zhe relies on a kind of existence that is made up by the imagination. It can be said to be a twisted product of the will of the universe.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had previously completely wiped out his physical form. Together with Bai Zhe in ten universes, he had been wiped out completely...</p>

    <p>But Bai Zhe found a new way to recover in this way.</p>

    <p>And to get rid of this twisted product of the will of the universe is far more complicated than to eliminate a person who does all evil.</p>

    <p>The reason why Wang Ling is cautious is to ensure that the next time Bai Zhe is destroyed by himself, he will disappear completely and forever. He will never appear in front of him again.</p>

    <p>Let's do it step by step.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling murmured to himself.</p>

    <p>The top priority now is still to deal with the upcoming geocentric plan.</p>

    <p>Although the superiors have not announced the list information to the outside world, Wang Ling has received an internal document from Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>After comprehensive consideration by Jiutian Jingmiyuan Teng Luchen and Huaxiu Alliance's recommendation opinions.</p>

    <p>A total of fourteen elite high school student delegations from Huaxiu State are proposed to participate in the Earth Center Project:</p>

    <p>Su Xingyue, representative of Shengke Elite</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe, elite representative of Beijing Number 8 High School</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan, the elite representative of Emperor Shi Tianzhong</p>

    <p>Yi Zhiyang, Gong Xuan, elite representatives of Jian Shen College</p>

    <p>Gao Tianming, the elite representative of Fu Mo Number 1 High School</p>

    <p>Elite representatives from Number 60 High School in Songhai City Sun Rong, Jiugong Liangzi, Chen Chao, Guo Hao, Fang Xing, Wang Zhen, Liu Qingyi and Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>To be honest, this list. Wang Ling is not too surprising.</p>

    <p>The only surprising thing is that I didn't expect Yi Zhiyang to join...</p>

    <p>And I joined even though I knew that Sun Rong would also come to participate.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling knows that since the last battle at Jiulong Mountain, Yi Zhiyang has not yet fully mastered Sun Rong's ptsd.</p>

    <p>Come and participate directly. Will it affect your performance?</p>

    <p>All in all. This is basically the confirmed list.</p>

    <p>The original list except Number 60 High School. Other schools were not included in the round. Because Qu Shuling exposed his dark side during the trial in the spirit world, the number of places in Shengke was greatly reduced. In the end, only the remaining I hired Su Xingyue to join the group as an elite representative.</p>

    <p>As for myself...</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling has successively promoted Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan, the two Crouching Dragon Fengchus, in the spiritual world trials. Let them shine like the sun, making their own sense of existence and overall performance very ordinary.</p>

    <p>But he still appeared on the list in the end. It is said that Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan personally called his name when they asked Teng Luchen for his opinion.</p>

    <p>He said that if I didn't take him with me, I would feel uneasy.</p>

    <p>As for Teng Luchen... Although he was full of doubts about Wang Ling at the beginning, he now follows the trend and directly regards Wang Ling as a mascot.</p>

    <p>After all, there are so many student representatives from Number 60 High School participating. Every time Number 60 High School wins an award, it is because of the mascot Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling is not there. How?</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen thought about it for a while, and finally chose Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>At first, he felt that Wang Ling had a powerful mysterious power. He originally thought that Wang Ling was hiding his strength.</p>

    <p>But after the spirit world trial, Teng Luchen felt that he had completely understood.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has a positive and uplifting force of unity!</p>

    <p>How long have Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan known him? Students who had no contact with him before recommended Wang Ling to him one after another... Doesn't this just show that this little mascot can unite people!</p>

    <p>So. When Wang Ling figured out what Teng Luchen really thought about him, his whole mind fell into a brief blank.</p>

    <p>Never mind...</p>

    <p>It doesn't matter what the old man thinks.</p>

    <p>As long as the old man is happy...</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling also noticed the problem at the same time.</p>

    <p>That is the delegation from Number 60 High School this time. Although there are also three "fishing in troubled waters" such as Wang Zhen, Fang Xing, and Liu Qingyi. They are monsters that can easily make the battle situation directly unbalanced.</p>

    <p>But the realms of Chen Chao and Guo Hao have always been stuck at the peak of the late Foundation Building and have not moved.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong is already strong enough. But in fact, it is only with the blessing of nine-core Aohai. Its own state has also stayed at the peak of the late Foundation Building for a long time due to various reasons.</p>

    <p>As the three people I know best at Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that it is necessary to help before the geocentric project begins.</p>

    <p>Let them collectively break through the late peak of Foundation Building. Enter the Golden Core...</p>
