  <h1>Chapter 1453 Jiang Xiaoche's Fake Couple List</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The operation of insuring the toffee was a masterpiece. Although Sun Rong paid for it himself, it was still Jiang Xiaoche who took care of the matter.</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche just signed a gambling agreement with the board of directors. After settling the 15 billion issue, he immediately contacted Sun Rong the insurance company overnight...</p>

    <p>He feels like a tool man.</p>

    <p>But he didn't feel irritated at all. Being asked to do things by Sun Rong made him feel as if he was being relied on.</p>

    <p>Very good.</p>

    <p>By the time everything was done, it was already close to ten o'clock in the evening.</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche then remembered that he had a dinner party with Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>The hotel was booked by Jiang Xiaoche before. Because of the matter with the board of directors, Jiang Xiaoche sent a text message to Jiang Yingying and asked her to wait in the hotel for a while. In the meantime, she can go to a health spa or something... Of course, the cost is completely It is settled by Jiang Xiaoche.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying is a smart girl.</p>

    <p>The cost of this hotel is extremely high. With her pocket money, she can't afford it.</p>

    <p>The main reason was that she was worried that Jiang Xiaoche would let her go. So Jiang Yingying waited carefully in the hotel restaurant from beginning to end.</p>

    <p>Just when she thought she was really let go by Jiang Xiaoche.</p>

    <p>From a distance, a tall young man with a straight nose and a pair of retro glasses walked towards her. Then he pulled out the chair in front of her and sat down: "I'm sorry. I'm late. I have a temporary assignment."</p>

    <p>When I first saw Jiang Xiaoche. Jiang Yingying, my impression was that the "Ah Che" in front of me seemed to be similar to the image in his mind.</p>

    <p>Not as handsome as expected. But his appearance is attractive...</p>

    <p>"It's okay..." Seeing Jiang Xiaoche arrive successfully, Jiang Yingying secretly breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>Finally, she no longer has to worry about her wallet.</p>

    <p>"You didn't go to a spa?"</p>

    <p>"Um...no..." Jiang Yingying blushed.</p>

    <p>She felt that if Jiang Xiaoche knew that she did not go because she was afraid of being let go, she would probably be laughed at.</p>

    <p>"Hahaha. It's okay. Girls should be careful when going out."</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche smiled and smoothed things over. Then he took the tablet from the table and started ordering: "Are there any taboos?"</p>

    <p>"It's spicy. It's not very tasty..." Jiang Yingying said.</p>

    <p>"That's right. I don't like spicy food either." Jiang Xiaoche nodded. Then he started ordering at the speed of light.</p>

    <p>He is familiar with the hotel's menu.</p>

    <p>Originally, the hotel's built-in restaurant in this world store had closed for business. However, the chef in the back kitchen never got off work.</p>

    <p>Because this hotel is opened by Jiang Xiaoche himself.</p>

    <p>"Ah, Brother Che, did you encounter another case just now?" Jiang Yingying asked curiously during the ordering process.</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche told her before that his profession is a detective.</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche often does this, lying to girls, and the best thing is that he almost never makes a mistake. He can remember the identities and stories he makes up at will, as well as the girls whose identities and backgrounds correspond to them. Clearly.</p>

    <p>"Well. It is indeed a very difficult case. A rich woman embezzled 15 billion in public funds in order to protect a pretty boy."</p>

    <p>So, he answered almost instantly. Naturally, people thought that he was a real detective.</p>

    <p>"15 billion..." Jiang Yingying was surprised.</p>

    <p>Although she is the granddaughter of ten generals, Marshal Jiang has always been honest. Such a huge number. Jiang Yingying is also unheard of.</p>

    <p>"Not only that. She also plans to spend more than one billion to insure the gifts given to the pretty boy." Jiang Xiaoche said.</p>

    <p>"What gift? Diamond ring? Gemstone?" Jiang Yingying asked.</p>

    <p>"A toffee." Jiang Xiaoche said.</p>

    <p>"Is it necessary...This is such a waste of money!"</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying despises this heinous capitalist behavior.</p>

    <p>"That's right! I think it's a waste too!" Jiang Xiaoche also said.</p>

    <p>He looked at Jiang Yingying and said with a smile: "So next, should we discuss pretending to be a couple on the weekend?"</p>

    <p>"Okay..." Jiang Yingying suddenly felt that her heartbeat was speeding up.</p>

    <p>Maybe it's because of the current atmosphere. Or maybe it's because the Jiang Xiaoche in front of him is gentler than he imagined...</p>

    <p>"This is the detailed list I made of pretending to be a couple. You can choose the acceptable options. In addition, all the expenses involved are all paid for by me." Jiang Xiaoche pushed up the glasses on the bridge of his nose. He took out the prepared list from the inner pocket of his chest and handed it to Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>List Title: Pretend Couple Agreement Checklist</p>

    <p>1:holding hands</p>

    <p>2: Upgraded version of holding hands (ten fingers clasped together)</p>

    <p>3:hug</p>

    <p>4: Upgraded version of hug (doggy style)</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When Jiang Yingying saw the fourth item, she felt bad: "What is doggy style..."</p>

    <p>"I just hug you from behind. Doesn't it look more like a couple? It makes you appear more intimate." Jiang Xiaoche explained.</p>

    <p>Then...</p>

    <p>5: Go shopping and buy clothes together</p>

    <p>6: Upgraded version of buying clothes (go to the fitting room together)</p>

    <p>7: Eat together</p>

    <p>8: Upgraded version of eating together (feeding each other in front of everyone)</p>

    <p>9: kiss</p>

    <p>10: Upgraded version of kiss (French drum washing machine style deep kiss)</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On Friday, December 11th, when Wang Ling went to school again in the morning, I found that the old man's pancake stall at the door had turned into a large flagship store.</p>

    <p>There are even employees who are here to help...</p>

    <p>Although Jiugong Liangzi is a troublesome person, he is essentially a tsundere.</p>

    <p>But judging from this incident, she does what she says. In fact, she is not a bad person.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is. This girl also likes to eat crispy noodles...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that the strategy to deal with Jiugong Liangzi does not necessarily have to be to physically clear the memory as before. If it can be converted into friendly forces, it seems good.</p>

    <p>This is the first day of the opening of the flagship pancake store. Basically, the people who come to buy pancakes are regular customers. Many alumni of Number 60 High School are surprised by the changes in just one night.</p>

    <p>The happiest person is naturally the old man of the pancake stall: "Hey! Classmate Wang Ling! Come on! Today's pancakes are all my treat!"</p>

    <p>After Wang Ling walked over, the old man pulled him aside and said in a low voice: "This time, I really want to thank classmate Wang Ling! The school said you are the mascot. It is true." You came to buy pancakes yesterday. You instantly helped me attract angel investment!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..." This is actually none of his business!</p>

    <p>Old man: "If you want to come over for pancakes in the future, just tell me. I can still afford one pancake. I'll treat you to it for free!"</p>

    <p>"Thanks..."</p>

    <p>"Don't thank me. Whom are we to each other?" The Old Man gently touched Wang Ling with his elbow. Then he said something to Wang Ling: "Also Wang Ling. I have one more thing to tell you."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "?"</p>

    <p>"Actually, what I want to say is that classmate Jiugong. Although classmate Jiugong helped me open the store, he seems to have a strange request..."</p>

    <p>The old man said: "She asked me to help. Record those boys with dead fish eyes."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
