  <h1>Chapter 1817 Another one is crazy</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Jingke appeared. He had not yet launched a major offensive. The nine-headed golden lion in the space environment was bald on the spot. All the hair on his body was scattered. It was like a goddess scattering flowers in the sky.</p>

    <p>"How could this be so..." The lion-headed man couldn't believe it. His Dharma weapon had been cultivated to the top level. It was an extremely difficult trump card for any Eternal. But he was directly used by the young man in front of him with a mahogany sword. Dissolved into the invisible.</p>

    <p>What exactly is this peach wood sword...</p>

    <p>The lion-headed man stared at Jingke, trying to detect his spiritual consciousness. However, it was blocked by an invisible barrier and refracted back, hitting him directly in the face.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>A very powerful blow, which shattered the bridge of his nose on the spot and caused blood to flow freely.</p>

    <p>This act of shooting himself in the foot made the lion-headed man furious at this moment: "How dare a mere earthling dare to be so presumptuous!"</p>

    <p>With a huge roar, he opened his big mouth. The moment he raised his head, it doubled in size. A huge lion head was as heavy as a mountain. Countless light blades spewed out of his mouth to split the space.</p>

    <p>This is the Void Splitting Slash. Through the combination of spiritual power and the energy of chaos, the explosive energy generated by this combination is sprayed directly from the mouth. It covers the entire space in front of it almost in an instant!</p>

    <p>In just a moment. Wang Ling scene in front of him was covered by countless light blades.</p>

    <p>These golden light blades were like blades piercing Ku Xuan. They passed through Wang Ling's clothes at an extremely fast speed. What made Wang Ling slightly surprised was that the 3.0 version of Number 60 High The School's enlightenment uniforms actually suffered several cuts under such an offensive.</p>

    <p>It seems that a new version of the enlightenment technique will be added to the school uniforms again...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p>It can only be said that these nine lions are indeed stronger than he thought. Before, Number 60 High School's uniforms were rarely damaged.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Wang Ling never thinks of adding any barriers to oneself when fighting against the enemy.</p>

    <p>You have to give the other party a chance to see hope.</p>

    <p>If he could give himself a shield with hundreds of millions of layers just like he gave Sun Rong a shield. This kind of visible despair would scare anyone away in an instant.</p>

    <p>Therefore. Wang Ling just wore this ugly and tattered school uniform to compete. As a result, Number 60 High School's uniforms withstood the test every time.</p>

    <p>It seems to have been a long time since the last time the school uniform was scratched...</p>

    <p>For Wang Ling, whether the school uniform is broken or not is a way to identify the strongest among the eternal.</p>

    <p>In order to protect the school uniform from further damage, Wang Ling held Jingke. Countless sword shadows also split in the air to compete with the light blades that filled the sky.</p>

    <p>It was like the collision of two meteor showers from the sky, causing huge explosions in the universe. The battle once entered a fierce scene. The lion-headed man roared, and his eyes were cold. When he opened his mouth, there was a black rod covered with strange spiritual patterns. The black spear suddenly spit out from his big mouth.</p>

    <p>The spear was like a dragon. It was hundreds of feet long. It was aimed directly at Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>This is the Lion King's Overlord Spear of the Lion Clan!</p>

    <p>It is a powerful weapon that has been passed down from generation to generation since the establishment of the Lion Clan. Now it was sacrificed by the lion-headed man in public. Wang Ling was also a little surprised when he saw it.</p>

    <p>After all, Wang Ling is just a seventeen-year-old child. There are many things that he has never seen before. Therefore, seeing many novel things feels like visiting a museum for the first time.</p>

    <p>The Lion King's Overlord Spear is too long. The spear comes out like a dragon. It penetrates from a distance. The radius of the spear body is five feet long. Wherever it passes, the space breaks apart. It directly explodes the energy in the universe. It turned into a boiling ocean.</p>

    <p>Such a huge and shocking momentum made Wang Ling realize that he had to take it seriously</p>

    <p>"Are you going to use that weird peach wood sword..." The Skeleton Prince of the Undead also stared at this scene from a distance. He hoped in his heart that the Lion King's move would work. If he could defeat Wang Ling. He can also escape from the sea of suffering. He no longer has to use the broken shield as an excuse to maintain his own life.</p>

    <p>So at this moment, he stared in the direction ahead with his peripheral vision and decided that Wang Ling might sacrifice the peach wood sword in his hand.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling thought about it again and again. He just turned the sword and inserted it into his back.</p>

    <p>Immediately afterwards, the Skeleton Prince of the Undead saw him take a deep breath and condense the power into his index finger, instilling it all to one point!</p>

    <p>When the bright red spiritual energy surged out from the young man's index finger, Wang Ling pointed the way with an immortal move. He aimed at the huge lion king spear and passed it out!</p>

    <p>At this point, the skeleton prince of the undead clan and the lion-headed man of the master clan were dumbfounded. They were surprised by Wang Ling's operation... This is the lion clan's overlord gun! It is the most powerful chaos weapon of the lion clan! The sequence level has reached the third A level 4 brightness level chaos device!</p>

    <p>This young man only used his index finger to block it purely with physical strength. Is this a normal human being?</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The Lion King's Overlord Spear collided with Wang Ling's index finger. In an instant, the sky exploded. The head of the Overlord Spear was directly destroyed by Wang Ling. The power of this index finger hit Huanglong. Fine cracks appeared from The head of the gun began to extend. It spread directly along the head of the gun several hundred feet to the tail of the gun.</p>

    <p>"ah..."</p>

    <p>At the same time, the lion-headed man screamed. He vomited blood. Veins popped up all over his body. His face turned pale in pain.</p>

    <p>As the Lion King Gun completely collapsed, he could not withstand the huge lethality caused by the backlash of this clan treasure. He rolled in the void of the universe for a long moment. He got up from the ground covered in blood.</p>

    <p>Although he was not killed directly, the power brought by the backlash just now made the lion-headed man realize that he was no longer able to resist Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>This boy from Earth is too scary. He is not as simple as a mascot as written in the information!</p>

    <p>It was only then that the Lionhead realized what had happened to the undead skeleton prince who had been breaking the shield at the side...</p>

    <p>It turns out that the undead skeleton prince already knew that he couldn't beat Wang Ling, so the undead skeleton prince just fished here!</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling walked towards the lion-headed man step by step. With his trouser pockets inserted, he had the same calm attitude as always.</p>

    <p>His red pair of eyes gave people a strong sense of contempt. There was a feeling of not taking everything seriously.</p>

    <p>The more the lion-headed man looked, the more frightened he became: "I'm telling you, don't come over! You've got the guts. Wait until we break the shield before continuing!"</p>

    <p>He hurriedly took a few steps back and stood side by side with the undead Skeleton Prince. Then he skillfully pulled out his index finger and began to imitate the Skeleton King and jointly study the method of breaking the shield.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>This is already the second Eternal One. Wang Ling really can't figure out why these people work so hard for that Holy King.</p>

    <p>What benefits were promised to this group of people?</p>

    <p>Now. Is there the last one left?</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling counted with his fingers. Two of Lawen's summoning opportunities have been used up. I don't know what the last one will be.</p>
