  <h1>Chapter 2074 Hong Siqi's immortal method</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: These words made Zhang Zhui stunned for a moment. Then his body began to twitch.</p>

    <p>This is not a sudden episode of epilepsy. It's just that I'm suppressing laughter. And I feel like I can't hold it in anymore.</p>

    <p>There are actually people pretending to be Zhuo Yi's master these days. Zhang Zhui really didn't expect this.</p>

    <p>Although there have always been legends about the master behind Zhuo Yi in the world. It once even caused a stir. In the end, it was Sun Dakang, the leader of the Ten Thousand Schools Alliance, who forcibly gave Zhuo Yi to Zhuo Yi because he cherished the talent. }Settled the situation.</p>

    <p>But even if the general leader comes forward in person, there will always be people who don't believe in this matter.</p>

    <p>They say rumors stop with the wise. But sometimes the people around you are not necessarily wise...</p>

    <p>What's more, the fact that Zhuo Yi has a master is actually not a rumor in general.</p>

    <p>So Zhang Zhui felt that this matter was most likely taken advantage of by Hong Siqi.</p>

    <p>Today, Zhuo Yi has a great reputation. There are so many casual cultivators traveling around the world. Without the clothes of any sect influence, naturally they will not be able to enjoy the various publicity resources provided by the sect.</p>

    <p>If you want to spread your reputation in this modern world of cultivation, casual cultivators must find their own gimmick.</p>

    <p>Essentially this is the same concept as product marketing.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui came to the modern world of cultivation for the first time. He is a complete newcomer.</p>

    <p>He didn't understand what marketing was. But he knew that no matter whether Hong Siqi was a legend of casual cultivators or not, he was a liar and couldn't escape.</p>

    <p>"He really told others that he was Zhuo Yi's master?" Zhang Zhui was curious.</p>

    <p>After all, as someone in the field who definitely knows who Master Zhuo Yi is, Zhang Zhui is also amazed by the fact that someone dares to pretend to be Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"He himself seems to have never responded directly to this matter. But it is just a rumor."</p>

    <p>Ouyang Miaokun responded: "In the casual cultivator circle, not everyone knows about this, but at least seventy people know about it!"</p>

    <p>Next to him, Ouyang Fenkun, an older brother, immediately echoed: "Why is it only 70%?!"</p>

    <p>"Seventy percent. It belongs to someone else. This is already very strong. There are so many casual cultivators. There is no power to rely on. If you want to make a name for yourself, it will be as difficult as climbing to the sky."</p>

    <p>The two brothers started a classic dialogue as if they were talking in cross talk. Zhang Zhui understood it completely as soon as he sang and harmonized.</p>

    <p>First of all, there is no doubt about Hong Siqi's strength. He has entered the Venerated Immortal realm at the speed of light after the earth was upgraded. His strength is so strong. In the eyes of many ordinary people, there seems to be no reason for such a legendary existence to lie.</p>

    <p>At least being the master of Zhuo Yi is more than enough.</p>

    <p>And the most cunning thing is that Hong Siqi himself never responded directly to such rumors. This cast a veil of mystery on the matter.</p>

    <p>This gives people more reason to believe. This person is the master of Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Because when rumors come there are usually two situations.</p>

    <p>You explain it. Those who believe it will think you are guilty and anxious.</p>

    <p>If you don't explain it, those who believe it will think it is true.</p>

    <p>As more and more people believe it, this rumor eventually becomes "truth" in the eyes of many people.</p>

    <p>How ironic!</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>The key thing is that Hong Siqi is not to blame. After all, he himself never said that he was the master of Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Moreover, there is no way to prove that this rumor was spread by Hong Siqi himself.</p>

    <p>"Then do you know why Hong Siqi wanted to ambush the Sword Master?" Zhang Zhui could tell. The two of them probably knew for a long time that Hong Siqi would ambush the Sword Master. That's why they came to the Island of Hell in advance.</p>

    <p>Watching powerful people fight at a higher level than yourself. This may be a more intuitive shortcut to improve your cultivation than going to the sea to find opportunities.</p>

    <p>So Zhang Zhui wanted to follow the original plan of these two people. It should be that he wanted to</p>

    <p>"What else can casual cultivators do? It's just for money. Hong Siqi himself still owes a lot of debt."</p>

    <p>Can Venerated Immortal still owe debt?</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui was dumbfounded again.</p>

    <p>"Haven't you heard? Hong Siqi took a loan to become an immortal. That's why he was able to concentrate his resources in a short period of time and complete the challenge. He became the first among the vast number of casual practitioners to hit the Venerated Immortal realm."</p>

    <p>"Loan...immortal?"</p>

    <p>The corner of Zhang Zhui's mouth twitched. He became more and more curious about Hong Siqi.</p>

    <p>Venerated Immortal Realm... The current upgraded Earth has replaced the True Immortal Realm. It has become the New God Realm.</p>

    <p>If you don't count special monsters like Wang Ling, among regular cultivators, there is nothing wrong with Hong Siqi being among the top ten on earth.</p>

    <p>Besides, we have already reached Venerated Immortal. This allows us to travel across the universe!</p>

    <p>If he really didn't care at all, Hong Siqi could have just left. But he didn't leave.</p>

    <p>That proves that he still wants to continue to develop on this earth. There is also something he misses.</p>

    <p>It's just that when a master is in such a situation, what else can he miss?</p>

    <p>"Kill the Sword Master. No matter who is behind it. As long as Hong Siqi can kill the Sword Master, he will not only be able to pay off all his loans, but also make his reputation spread directly from the casual cultivator circle. To By then he had both fame and fortune."</p>

    <p>At this time, Yue Lingwei, who had been immersed in it for a long time, spoke again.</p>

    <p>And in the next second, as if to confirm everyone's guess, the casual cultivators who surrounded Yi Jianchuan in the air were shot down into the sea like locusts.</p>

    <p>The entire Yama Island started to tremble with a bang.</p>

    <p>In a secret depression on Yama Island, spiritual light boiled. Hong Siqi showed an astonishing intimidation. This was Venerated Immortal weather. The entire Yama Island began to sink under this Venerated Immortal spiritual pressure. For a moment, the surrounding seawater Roaring. Steam was burned by the hot spiritual power, causing the surrounding space to be almost suddenly surrounded by layers of fog.</p>

    <p>The ground on the island melted on the spot. At the same time, there was an accompanying phenomenon of heaven and earth phenomena and the eruption of a submarine volcano. Thick volcanic ash dyed the entire sky above Yama Island dark red.</p>

    <p>Everything looks like the end of the world.</p>

    <p>This is not the full power of Venerated Immortal. It is just Hong Siqi's unilateral intimidation.</p>

    <p>His goal is clear. He is heading towards the Sword Master.</p>

    <p>It was only at this time that Zhang Zhui finally saw clearly the appearance of the legendary...the first person in the mortgage repair industry, Hong Siqi.</p>

    <p>He cannot be called an immortal. He has extremely high brow bones and a high nose bridge. From the appearance, he looks like a mixed race. He has black hair. The most obvious feature is the bangs on his forehead. This slightly curly arc is actually the same as Zhuo Yi is somewhat similar.</p>

    <p>Good guy...</p>

    <p>Isn't this just for fun!</p>

    <p>Really hammered!</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui couldn't stand this pretentious look. He originally wanted to see if Yi Jianchuan had a way to take the attack. But now he couldn't help but rolled up his sleeves and looked ready to fight.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, his arm was grabbed by Yue Lingwei again: "Wait a minute."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui: "?"</p>

    <p>Yue Lingwei's back was still sitting straight in the cross-legged position. He let go of his hand and looked into the distance. He said calmly: "The Sword Master is also going to be promoted."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui calmed down. Perceived again.</p>

    <p>When he sensed the subtle fluctuations in the sea of qi on Yi Jianchuan's body. www.uukanshu.net His whole expression changed with surprise.</p>

    <p>"Sanctified?"</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui couldn't believe it.</p>

    <p>But what he felt from Yi Jianchuan at this moment was indeed the aura of Sage Immortal!</p>

    <p>Before the earth was upgraded, almost all masters of the ninth level of True Immortal would choose to store their spiritual energy in a specific sea of qi, waiting for the right opportunity to release the spiritual energy of the sea of air to complete the realm!</p>

    <p>But most people are often a little short of this step. Therefore, they need to spend a lot of heavenly materials and earthly treasures to make up for the last bit of missing spiritual power.</p>

    <p>Perhaps no one could have imagined that this legendary swordsman would actually choose to directly unlock the sea of qi spiritual power that he had accumulated for many years after facing the oppression of Venerated Immortal casual cultivator Hong Siqi!</p>

    <p>And. Directly across a big border!</p>

    <p>Canonized in public!</p>
