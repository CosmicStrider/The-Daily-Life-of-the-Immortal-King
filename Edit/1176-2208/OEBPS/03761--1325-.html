  <h1>Chapter 1325 Office of Strategic Deception's Face-Pinching Challenge</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Life is a circle.</p>

    <p>The reincarnation of all things is another circle.</p>

    <p>Although the monk didn't know what was in the chaos egg, he could guess what would happen next at the moment the eggshell cracked.</p>

    <p>The marmot succeeded in seizing the house. But the monk had no intention of stopping it.</p>

    <p>As for the other woodchuck that was pushed out of its body, Er Ha has already eaten it in his mouth... and is currently digesting it.</p>

    <p>Vomit. I definitely can't vomit it out.</p>

    <p>"Amitabha. Everything is destiny." The monk performed the Buddhist ritual and walked to the front. He didn't say a word. He just stared at the prairie dog's lower body.</p>

    <p>Mr. Gray Mist felt a little uncomfortable with the monk's eyes.</p>

    <p>But I felt that the monk's eyes seemed to be hinting at something.</p>

    <p>He held his head and looked down along the monk's gaze...</p>

    <p>I was surprised to find that I didn't have one anymore!</p>

    <p>This groundhog!</p>

    <p>It's actually a female!</p>

    <p>"Ahhhh!"</p>

    <p>When he thought that he would never have a "happy" life again, the prairie dog held his head and howled loudly. Then his body instantly petrified and turned into a sculpture-like existence.</p>

    <p>"Master... this is?" Lord Diulei was extremely surprised.</p>

    <p>"Totally autistic."</p>

    <p>The monk sighed and said: "The mythical beasts bred in chaos all have the ability to evade inner demons. They will never be invaded by inner demons. Once inner demons are generated, the body will automatically enter the purification mode until the inner demons in the body are completely eradicated. would all turn into chaotic sculptures like this."</p>

    <p>After saying that, the monk took out an anti-realm magic weapon.</p>

    <p>It was a Buddhist magic sword. It was made up of seven or forty-nine copper coins engraved with the Buddhist seal of "Âçç" in series.</p>

    <p>The monk casually slashed at the petrified prairie dog.</p>

    <p>The sword collided with the groundhog's stone body, making a crisp metallic collision sound.</p>

    <p>The sword energy was directly deflected and cut towards the sand dunes in the distance. Then a big explosion occurred.</p>

    <p>"It's so hard." Everyone was stunned.</p>

    <p>"The Chaos Sculpture is indestructible. Unless it is Ling Zhenren's palm, it would be unrealistic to destroy it," the monk said.</p>

    <p>"Hey, monk. How long will it take for someone to recover from autism?" Miss Ajuan went up and touched the round head of the petrified marmot and asked with a smile.</p>

    <p>The body of the female prairie dog that Mr. Gray Mist took away was still in the state of a young chick. Compared to the original body of Mr. Gray Mist, which was overweight, it is really only a little bigger now!</p>

    <p>He looks like a serious cute creature!</p>

    <p>"So cute! So cool! If it wasn't in the petrified state, it would definitely feel good!" Miss Ajuan said.</p>

    <p>"Let me tell you. It definitely doesn't feel as good as MASTER's." Xiao Yin said at this time.</p>

    <p>"Eh? Is Ling Zhenren's face also very soft?" Everyone was curious.</p>

    <p>"I haven't touched it. I just heard it from my grandmother!" Xiao Yin remembered when she was a guest at the Wang family's villa.</p>

    <p>Mother Wang took out the childhood photo of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>That face is really elastic!</p>

    <p>And even now, he felt like Master's face could be filled with tears.</p>

    <p>It's just that no one dares to try it easily...</p>

    <p>Because I don't have the guts.</p>

    <p>"Hey. I really want to pinch Zhenren's face!"</p>

    <p>"It would be better if you don't seek death... MASTER will be angry..."</p>

    <p>Suddenly, everyone's topic suddenly shifted from Q's cute petrified prairie dog to the issue of pinching faces.</p>

    <p>The topic changed so quickly that the monk found it funny.</p>

    <p>"Okay, everyone. Since everyone is curious, why not take a gamble?"</p>

    <p>"Ah? Monk, you also gamble? Are you not a monk?"</p>

    <p>"I don't bet. But I can provide you with rewards."</p>

    <p>The monk smiled slightly. He picked up the eggshell of the Chaos Egg in front of him casually and said, "The eggshell of the divine beast is the top material for making powerful magic weapons. It is a priceless treasure. If anyone can pinch Ling Zhenren's face, then the poor monk can do it with his own hands. Tailor-made a powerful Buddhist instrument."</p>

    <p>A magical weapon customized by monk Jin Deng himself!</p>

    <p>It is also made from the eggshells of mythical beasts!</p>

    <p>Kind of want it!</p>

    <p>"Okay! I'll compete!"</p>

    <p>"I'm participating too!"</p>

    <p>For a time, many people raised their hands and said.</p>

    <p>It's just a joke... As long as the timing is right, Ling Zhenren may not be angry!</p>

    <p>That's what they thought in their minds.</p>

    <p>"I think there is no need to be constrained by signing up. Everyone within the scope of the Office of Strategic Deception can participate. Including those internal and external disciples and core members. Whoever can get it will win."</p>

    <p>"Well. Then let's do it!" Lord Diulei also nodded.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin and Er Ha were trembling as they watched.</p>

    <p>These people are so bold!</p>

    <p>I really don't want my life!</p>

    <p>"But then again, what should we do about this petrified groundhog?" At this time, someone finally realized that the topic seemed to be getting more and more off-kilter. He guided everyone to refocus their attention on the man in front of him, holding his head, and fell into a roaring posture. On the petrified prairie dog.</p>

    <p>"It takes time to purify one's inner demons. Mr. Gray Mist is trying his best to survive. After waiting for so long, the body of the prairie dog was finally captured. This is the first blow."</p>

    <p>The monk sighed and said: "After successfully seizing the body, I found that my eggs were gone. This is the second blow... Under such a double blow, inner demons are born. I will not be able to wake up for a while. The poor monk and Ling Zhenren is about to go to an unspeakable place. It is impossible to carry him with him. I think it is better to set up a sealing circle and move his petrified body there first."</p>

    <p>"Sealing the magic circle?"</p>

    <p>"In this case, once he wakes up, he will not immediately break through the seal and do evil. Although Lord Gray Fog still has the ability to use chaotic gray fog, but after all, this is a young body. The power of chaotic gray fog is far inferior. In his heyday."</p>

    <p>"That's it." Lord Diulei nodded: "Then... I have no choice but to do this!"</p>

    <p>"While Ling Zhenren and I are going to the unspeakable place, Lord Lao, please take more care of me!" the monk said.</p>

    <p>After saying that, he took out a scroll of {Great Sun Buddha Prajna Sutra} from his sleeve and gave it to Diulei: "This is the Heart Sutra method of True Venerated Immortal breaking through Venerated Immortal. It can be regarded as a little bit of the humble monk's thoughts."</p>

    <p>"But I am not a disciple of Buddhism." Lord Diulei said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"Realm cultivation has nothing to do with whether you are a disciple of Buddhism. As long as you are dedicated to doing good, you are qualified to practice." Monk Jin Deng said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"That's it. Thank you so much, Master!" Lord Diulei bowed.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. In the underground retreat cellar of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Facing the "Face-Pinching Challenge" launched by Lord Diulei and others. Zhuo Yi was also dumbfounded: "Except for Grandma and Grandmaster, I'm afraid no one in the world has ever pinched Master's face! School girl. Want to try it?"</p>

    <p>At this time. Zhuo Yi turned his attention to Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"Girls... how can they pinch a boy's face at will... They must have a very close relationship... otherwise they will be misunderstood!" Sun Rong was suddenly incoherent and at a loss.</p>

    <p>Seeing the girl's panicked look, Zhuo Yi laughed in her heart.</p>
