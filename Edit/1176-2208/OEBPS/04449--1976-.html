  <h1>Chapter 1976 The damn desire to win among men</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The current state of Qu Shuling is obviously wrong. It is true that this kind of psychological distortion also has some elements of personality trends. In addition, Qu Shuling has been habitually wearing that aloof mask for many years. Now that his true nature has completely exploded, it will naturally happen. There is an indescribable feeling of horror.</p>

    <p>Although Qu Shuling was very hateful, after calming down, Li Changzhe still considered it from a rational point of view. He felt that if he continued like this, he might make this grudge fall into an endless cycle.</p>

    <p>He has no interest in exposing Qu Shuling's true face. Youdao will only see people's hearts over time.</p>

    <p>If you want people to be ignorant, you have to do it yourself. The more a person likes to disguise himself, the uglier he becomes when his mask is taken off. And the person who takes off this mask, Li Changzhe, has no interest in becoming one. He I think time is enough to prove everything.</p>

    <p>The key at hand is how to calm down Qu Shuling. After all, this crazy group has gone dark. He is worried that the continued fighting will put all of them into a lose-lose situation.</p>

    <p>"Brother Qu, calm down. Let's do this. We might as well make a bet. Continuing to fight is nothing more than consuming the spiritual energy between you and me. But it will make other people reap the benefits, right?" At this time, Li Changzhe said.</p>

    <p>He knew that Qu Shuling was a very sophisticated egoist. As long as it was beneficial to him, Qu Shuling would take it into consideration.</p>

    <p>Of course, the current negotiation is still risky. After all, Qu Shuling is already a black man. Negotiating with such a madman. Li Changzhe even feels a little crazy.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling folded his arms and observed quietly. He found that Li Changzhe usually lived like a reckless man, but he could calm down at critical moments.</p>

    <p>"Oh? But now I just want to kill you." Qu Shuling's eyes were cold. His eyes were like a hyena that had been hungry for several days. He bit Li Changzhe tightly and wouldn't let go.</p>

    <p>But Li Changzhe also noticed that Qu Shuling didn't make any extra moves. He just stared at him and stood there.</p>

    <p>He reacted immediately.</p>

    <p>I know there is still room for negotiation in this "gamble"...</p>

    <p>Although this crazy criticism has gone dark, it has not completely gone dark yet.</p>

    <p>"Let's do this, Brother Qu. If you win this bet, I can let you stab me with a sword. You won't need any magic weapon to protect your body. I won't use any spells. You can stab where you want. It's up to you. If you lose." How about just leaving the trial field on your own?" Li Changzhe said.</p>

    <p>"interesting."</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling sneered. Then he asked, "How do you want to bet?"</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe immediately said: "You and I stand on the same level. We wave our sword energy facing the ground in the open area. See whose sword energy can stretch longer. Take the sword marks on the ground as the criterion. This is between you and me. A gentleman's relationship. Make an appointment. No one is allowed to cheat. If you can beat me, then you are great."</p>

    <p>These words sounded ordinary, but in fact they captured Qu Shuling's heart in an instant.</p>

    <p>That's okay too...</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan was holding her forehead from behind.</p>

    <p>She was stunned.</p>

    <p>As the only girl in the room, I never expected that things would develop in this direction.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, happiness between men is so simple...</p>

    <p>And he always likes to make small bets that are completely meaningless.</p>

    <p>Even the bets are ridiculous.</p>

    <p>However, when Qu Shuling really accepted the challenge, Zhang Linyan couldn't help but start to worry about the outcome of the game.</p>

    <p>"Their spiritual sword is a sacred weapon... Our sword was repaired after being damaged. Can it be compared? Can you win?" She transmitted the message secretly. She sounded particularly anxious. Although Zhang Linyan knew that Li Changzhe was probably thinking of What kind of backhand did I have to dare to propose such a duel? But I still feel a little unsure.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was calm. After all, only Wang Ling in the audience knew how powerful Zhan Ye was now.</p>

    <p>And the fundamental reason why Li Changzhe proposed this matchup did not lie with Zhan Ye. After all, he still knew nothing about Zhan Ye's power.</p>

    <p>Therefore, he just thought of another trick and tried to use a side door to defeat the enemy.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, Sister Zhang. There will be no problem." Li Changzhe was full of confidence.</p>

    <p>What they compare to is the extension of sword energy.</p>

    <p>This is also one of the regular events in the normal Spirit Sword Competition.</p>

    <p>According to Li Changzhe's idea, as long as he applies fog method to the sword edge while slashing Zhan Ye, theoretically, the sword energy entrained with water mist can be fully integrated through the water molecules in the air, thus making the sword energy The length reaches several times higher than the original distance. But the disadvantage is that such sword energy will become soft and has no lethality at all.</p>

    <p>But what they competed with was the extension of sword energy. Therefore, Li Changzhe felt that this method was feasible. There was a high probability that he could defeat Qu Shuling.</p>

    <p>After agreeing on the rules, Qu Shulingbian and Li Changzhe came to the same level.</p>

    <p>"Brother Qu, please invite me first." Li Changzhe pretended to be polite.</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling snorted. Without saying a word, he just held Yue Li in his hand. He pointed at an open area and began to swing his sword upwards and began to accumulate power. When the spiritual power condensed on the sword body to a critical point.</p>

    <p>Whoosh!</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling struck down with a sword in the air!</p>

    <p>It can only be said that the holy weapon level spiritual sword is worthy of being a holy weapon level. The powerful sword energy of this sword showed the momentum of a tiger roaring and a dragon roaring the moment it was released. The bright sword energy almost followed Qu Shuling's feet. The tip spreads forward, splitting the earth.</p>

    <p>The holy moonlight sword energy illuminated the jungle in front of the night. Then there was only the sound of countless big trees being cut apart by the sword energy.</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan was dumbfounded. It was just a sword strike from Qu Shuling. The sword energy moved four hundred meters the moment it was released, and it was also increasing in speed as time went by.</p>

    <p>Yue Li's sword energy is too weird. It's like a parabola. The sword energy's real power point is only halfway through.</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan made a rough calculation using his own visual skills as an archer. Qu Shuling's sword energy lasted for twenty-six seconds before stopping. The average propulsion distance per second had reached 600 meters, already exceeding the speed of sound.</p>

    <p>Nearly sixteen kilometers of sword energy...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Li Changzhe's silent calculation had almost the same result.</p>

    <p>He immediately frowned. He felt that he had slightly underestimated Yue Li's strength.</p>

    <p>This distance is similar to Li Changzhe's previous method of using a side door to win. If it was just a simple sword test, he felt that he would definitely not be able to win.</p>

    <p>And whether you can win now really depends on luck.</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe gritted his teeth.</p>

    <p>He stood at the same level as Qu Shuling. He suppressed his blush. It could be seen that he had used up all his spiritual power. It was all poured into Zhan Ye's sword.</p>

    <p>The next second.</p>

    <p>Accompanied by his slashing sword forward, there was a loud bang that exploded the eardrums of everyone in this spiritual world trial field.</p>

    <p>A black crescent sword energy with a height of more than ten meters rushed forward like the fangs of a vampire at the moment Li Changzhe slashed out.</p>

    <p>This kind of power is more frightening than Yue Li. At the moment of sacrifice, the heaven and earth are different. Even the night sky changes color. It is dyed with a layer of blood red that belongs to Zhan Ye.</p>

    <p>The initiator of all this was stunned on the spot and had no idea what was happening.</p>

    <p>At this time, Li Changzhe did not even realize the seriousness of the problem.</p>

    <p>Because the sword energy he slashed directly shattered the entire Number 2 Spirit World Trial Field...</p>
