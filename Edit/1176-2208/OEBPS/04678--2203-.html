  <h1>Chapter 2203 The scam appears</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: Lao Huang doesn't know what happened specifically. But he seems to have become the "spokesperson" of Wang Ling inexplicably.</p>

    <p>In fact, he can feel the extraordinaryness of Wang Ling. And he can feel an inexplicable sense of intimacy in this young man.</p>

    <p>And this feeling is not the kind of emotion that an elder brother has for his younger brother. This made Lao Huang a little embarrassed for a time, because when he faced Wang Ling, he really had the mentality of an old father.</p>

    <p>How can anyone recognize his father as soon as he comes up? This is very rude. Besides, he knows that Wang Ling and Sun Rong are not ordinary high school students in the Foundation Building.</p>

    <p>Lao Huang couldn't help but smile bitterly in his heart. He said he was doing research on the practical training of high school students in the Foundation Building period. But it turned out that he seemed to be following him for an internship.</p>

    <p>Based on this natural intimacy and invisible tacit understanding. In addition, Lao Huang has an old father's mentality. He did not expose Wang Ling. Instead, he chose to cooperate and protect.</p>

    <p>He cleared his throat and asked Huang Tingjian directly: "How dare you swear to God that the information in this scroll is really reliable?"</p>

    <p>"Absolutely reliable. Senior." Huang Tingjian replied respectfully: "This information originally came from the hands of Zhi Jiunian. I have also checked it in private. There is no falsehood."</p>

    <p>What was recorded in the scroll was the coordinate information of the common landing points of the group of smuggled aliens. The information was indeed reliable. But Huang Tingjian couldn't figure out that with the strength of the senior Huang in front of him, he needed to be affiliated with a company to get a salary to live. So he I think there must be a special intention in this. But the saucy operations and ideas of these powerful people are not something that he, a junior, can interfere with.</p>

    <p>As Huang Tingjian who has accumulated certain experience in the cultivation circle and is also a senior headhunter, Huang Tingjian understands the world of people better than anyone else.</p>

    <p>He rolled his eyes. Then he suddenly faced behind him. He waved his sleeves and a pink mist spread out from his sleeves. Then it spread quickly.</p>

    <p>The large group of system-ability cultivators in the rear were unable to react in time. Each one of them seemed to be in a fog. The holes gradually turned pink.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling knows. This is an illusion. An illusion that can erase memories based on psychological suggestion.</p>

    <p>"What happened here today. No one will remember that Senior Huang brought two high school students here... No one will remember what happened..." Huang Tingjian spoke to the people behind him. He spoke in an ethereal way. The voice was read silently three times.</p>

    <p>Those people behind him fainted on the spot.</p>

    <p>Then, he faced Old Huang again and clasped his fists: "Senior Huang, please don't worry. This junior has already dealt with everything. After these people wake up, no one will remember what happened to Senior Huang. Senior Huang's thoughts, I know I have other ideas." Deep meaning. So I don't want to ask so many questions. At the same time, I will not mention today's events to anyone. If seniors are worried, please erase my memory."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Lao Huang didn't expect Huang Tingjian to be so capable. But in fact, he really didn't have any so-called deep meaning. The original idea of coming here was just to find a reliable and high-paying job.</p>

    <p>He was silent for a moment. He winked at Wang Ling and Sun Rong. Then he continued to raise his posture and asked: "You are very sensible. Xiao Huang. So, what are the questions of my two little friends?" I wonder if you can also answer it?"</p>

    <p>"This... is natural... the younger generation must tell everything they know..." Huang Tingjian said.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong glanced at Wang Ling. He quickly seized the opportunity and asked: "Is the system capability thing real? Does the system really exist in this world?"</p>

    <p>This question is obviously a bit out of scope. And it's obviously not that Huang Tingjian doesn't know the answer. It's just that for some reason he can't directly answer Sun Rong's question.</p>

    <p>When I saw Huang Tingjian's reaction Wang Ling, I understood everything at once. It was obvious that Huang Tingjian was afraid of something. He was hindered by Lao Huang's realm, so he was respectful. It was just like he knew about the people with this system ability. The real inside story and the big boss lurking behind the inside story. This caused Huang Tingjian to fall into a situation where neither party dared to offend.</p>

    <p>Because he couldn't tell which of the two sides was stronger or weaker.</p>

    <p>At this time, keeping silent is the best choice.</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry, Senior Huang. There are some things... juniors are caught in the middle. It's not easy to deal with." Huang Tingjian looked embarrassed.</p>

    <p>Lao Huang was not a person who liked to make things difficult for others. He did not continue to force Huang Tingjian. Instead, he turned around and left with the scroll.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong also knows. In this situation, there is indeed no need to continue asking.</p>

    <p>She thought of many things in an instant. She had many thoughts: "It seems that there is indeed something hidden behind these system ability users."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling put his pockets in his pocket. He looked at Sun Rong. He tilted his head. The breeze blew his bangs: "What do you think? Tell me?"</p>

    <p>"I feel that there is no real system capability in this world. In other words, these so-called systems are preset scams from the beginning."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong sighed: "Of course. I don't have any evidence. This is...as a girl's intuition! Hmm! Intuition!"</p>

    <p>"But there's one thing I haven't figured out. If these system capabilities are all a scam, then why does the Universe Infinite Group still recruit these people in the name of recruiting talented people?"</p>

    <p>"The cultivation talents of these people are very mediocre. They have achieved this level by relying on the so-called system. When they were just in the factory, I thought their combat experience was not as good as our classmates from Number 60 High School."</p>

    <p>"I think when Chen Chao and Guo Hao come out of retreat with their master from Huishuo Mountain, I'm afraid they will have to be separated by several levels."</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun's words are indeed rough words. These system ability users are indeed empty-headed. Their own cultivation quality is not high." It's not just Sun Rong. Even Lao Huang has the same view.</p>

    <p>Judging from the system ability users he has come into contact with so far. Wang Ling, Sun Rong, Lao Huang can clearly feel the weakness of these system ability users... and this feeling gives people. Just like those rich kids who rely on drugs to constantly build themselves up to achieve short-term spiritual growth. There is a feeling that the gold on the outside is ruined on the outside.</p>

    <p>After all, in the modern world of cultivation, it is not difficult to rely on modern technology and hard work to improve one's realm. Monks with extraordinary talents like Wang Ling are ultimately a very small minority among a very small number.</p>

    <p>In order to allow their children to obtain better educational resources, as long as the conditions allow the family, the children will become medicine jars from birth. With all kinds of good tonics added to them, they will be like a bird that continues to expand in a short period of time. The balloon. As for when it will be blown up, there is no way of knowing...</p>
