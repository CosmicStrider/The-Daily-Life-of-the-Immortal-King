  <h1>Chapter 2098 The usual style</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The monk Michu was speechless after these words. As we all know, as Huaxiu gradually grows, Huaxiu has naturally become one of the international languages.</p>

    <p>In today's era, it is not only Brother Michu who is studying. Learning Mandarin has also become a standard course in other major cultivation countries.</p>

    <p>If you want to take this to the next level, you can also learn classical Chinese. You can feel the breadth and depth of Chinese culture from the beautiful poems and songs of ancient poets.</p>

    <p>This is recognized as the most difficult language in the world. It is also one of the most complex languages and cultures. It is not easy to learn. But with the continuous development of the era of cultivation, today's corporate sects who want to conduct business and trade in Huaxiu. If they can even speak a little Mandarin. I don't even understand. I'm afraid it's impossible to do business here.</p>

    <p>Since the world of cultivation entered modern times, the world of cultivation hundreds of years ago had a unipolar structure.</p>

    <p>Michu made a fortune by selling magical weapons during the war of aggression. Due to his superb cultivation technology, he almost formed a monopoly for a time.</p>

    <p>Therefore, it has been dubbed the "tailor country" since ancient times. Every day, it is either sanctioning this or that...</p>

    <p>But now it is already the year 4397 of the Cultivation Calendar. The single-level structure of the past no longer exists. Today's world of Cultivation is a world where all powerful powers have emerged. The major Cultivation Countries are also in a state of relative checks and balances. Especially large-scale Cultivation Countries are in a state of relative checks and balances. Almost all countries have trump cards in their hands.</p>

    <p>While sitting in the Little White Dragon, he saw Mi Xiu's ships coming from all directions and surrounding the Little White Dragon. Yi Jianchuan himself had never expected such a tyrannical obstruction.</p>

    <p>He did not expect that even though the pattern of the earth had changed, Michu's monks would still pursue the same hegemonic behavior as before.</p>

    <p>This has been their usual style since the founding of the country. He was thinking about it while sitting in the cabin. After thinking for more than ten seconds, he couldn't figure out what gave them the courage.</p>

    <p>Especially within the restricted area of this sea, it is recognized as high seas by the international cultivation world. No cultivation country can seize the territory here and do whatever it wants.</p>

    <p>After the monk Mi Xiu was speechless, he directly began to speak foreign language. Because he spoke too fast, Wang Muyu really didn't understand it. After all, he was only a child. The language system of the earth is too complicated. And the Dragon Clan There is not a particularly literate cultural dragon in his genes, which allows Wang Muyu to quickly learn languages from various countries.</p>

    <p>But judging from the other person's constant spitting and rapidly trembling lips, as well as his comprehensive emotions, even if he didn't understand foreign language at all, Wang Muyu knew that this person was swearing.</p>

    <p>In the capital of Mixiu Country, inside a huge white tower, Mixiu Yuan Zun sat at his desk. He looked at everything through the surveillance footage transmitted from the ship in the maritime zone.</p>

    <p>He accepted all Qiao Yanyuan's invitations and decided to cooperate with Honghuang because the conditions Qiao Yanyuan proposed to him were indeed too generous for him to refuse.</p>

    <p>Not only was Maiko Assi found, but Hong Siqi's injuries were also fully recovered. Not only that... the other party also introduced him to a rare talent - Qu Shuling.</p>

    <p>A very young boy. But he has extremely amazing psychic powers. Although Mi Xiu Yuan Zun didn't know how he was cultivated, but based on the clues collected by Mi Xiu's intelligence bureau, he judged that this Qu Shuling... It is very likely that he is the legendary Eternal One.</p>

    <p>In recent years, there have been endless reports that major cultivating countries are recruiting the Eternal Ones behind the scenes. Of course, Misuo himself is not willing to lag behind.</p>

    <p>That Qiao Yanyuan had a strange origin. He was able to directly enter the restricted area and work on the Moonlight cruise ship without anyone noticing.</p>

    <p>This also made Mi Xiuyuan Zun feel a little scared. But for now, for the sake of profit, temporary cooperation is not a bad idea.</p>

    <p>As long as his means were sufficient, he felt that Qiao Yanyuan was also a huge threat and someone who must be targeted or eliminated in the future.</p>

    <p>As for the current stage, the cooperation between Mixiu Country and Honghuang is only temporary.</p>

    <p>And his mission is also very simple. He just needs to expel those Earth monks who try to approach the Moonlight.</p>

    <p>Driving an immortal ship to wander around the straits of other cultivating countries. Who knows this better than Mi Xiu Yuan Zun?</p>

    <p>"Mr. Yuan Zun. I think the Sword Master will take action..."</p>

    <p>"He didn't dare."</p>

    <p>Mi XiuYuan Zun sat on a spacious and authentic high-end leather chair made of pure spirit animal fur. His orange skin and golden back hair made him look noble. Even the beard under his big nose looked riveting. Enough energy to give yourself a sense of drama.</p>

    <p>There is no wrinkle in his suit. It is as smooth as his self-confidence: "Sword Master. I have dealt with him for many years. In the ancient saying of Huaxiu, this person has always followed the golden mean. And for People are cautious. Even if we surround him, he will not take action directly. And the key is, in this situation, no one will come to help him."</p>

    <p>He shook the red wine glass in his hand and took a sip: "I have personally spoken with the other cultivators. Their ships have gradually evacuated from the restricted area. I have also checked this high-speed maritime train. It is from the Office of Strategic Deception."</p>

    <p>Mi XiuYuan Zun's meaning is already obvious. The high-speed train under a sect will reach the sea restricted area.</p>

    <p>Can this represent the country of cultivation to which it belongs? Can it have its own right to speak?</p>

    <p>Not at all.</p>

    <p>Because a sect, no matter how large it is built, is still dependent on the Xiuzhen Kingdom. Even if Yi Jianchuan is on this high-speed maritime train, it doesn't explain anything at all.</p>

    <p>Compared with the regular immortal fleet and the armed monks sent by Michu, the maritime high-speed rail does seem a bit out of place. It has an unfair name.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Mi Xiu Yuan Zun seems to be very calm all the time. Because applying pressure is his usual method. What Mi Xiu wants to do is an act of justice. It is to maintain peace and stability.</p>

    <p>If other cultivating countries dare to disobey Mi Xiu's wishes, that would be disobedience and a destroyer of world peace.</p>

    <p>And to say the least, even if Yi Jianchuan takes action now, Mi XiuYuan Zun still has something to do. At that time, he only needs to control the surrounding public opinion and publicize two points around the world.</p>

    <p>The first is. The sword master who has just reached the Sage Immortal Realm. Bullies the small with the big. He suppresses the monks from other countries to maintain peace and stability in the region.</p>

    <p>Second, members of the Office of Strategic Deception openly took action in the maritime restricted area on the high seas. Does this move prove that the previous statement that the Office of Strategic Deception is a state within a state is completely true?</p>

    <p>The modern world of cultivation is no longer an era where problems can be solved purely by force and combat power. As long as we fight information warfare well, we can also occupy the peak of "public opinion."</p>

    <p>Human nature is kind. No one knows better than him about this set of operations to incite public opinion!</p>

    <p>At this time, Mi XiuYuan Zun sneered: "I don't believe it. This Office of Strategic Deception high-speed rail is now in a desperate situation. How can it break my situation?"</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the slap in the face came suddenly.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the void shook.</p>

    <p>Countless golden haloes bloomed in the sky like flowers. These were portals. They were densely scattered throughout the sky...</p>
