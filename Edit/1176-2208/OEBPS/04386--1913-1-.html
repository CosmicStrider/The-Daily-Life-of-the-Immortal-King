  <h1>Chapter 1913 Everything is predestined.</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Even Wang Ling himself never thought that he would meet Peng Xiren again in eternity.</p>

    <p>He looked at Peng Xiren's shocked face and couldn't help but sigh in his heart.</p>

    <p>The Peng Xiren of the Eternal Era is still too weak compared to the modern Peng Xiren. The current Peng Xiren has not even reached the ancestral realm.</p>

    <p>However, at Peng Xiren's age, it is not an exaggeration to call him a genius.</p>

    <p>At this moment, this is a non-still picture. However, Peng Xiren has been frozen in fright by the sudden appearance of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was very helpless. It was obvious that he did not use any immobilizing spells. He did not even use spiritual pressure. The aura alone made Peng Xiren stiff.</p>

    <p>This is normal. After all, not everyone can fight with an external god.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling easily solved Sayani Gusi and sealed him directly. He also saved Peng Beicen's operation, which obviously shocked Peng Xiren's soul.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren has always believed in the supremacy of the old days and the law of the supremacy of outer gods. He also tried to use the power of outer gods to combine with existing cultivation to create a hybrid new power.</p>

    <p>This idea seems to Wang Ling to be really whimsical.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling jumped down from the outer edge. He walked slowly to Peng Xiren and looked at him.</p>

    <p>For Wang Ling, many unexplainable things seemed to be explained clearly at this moment. He suddenly understood why he came to eternity to face this script that was twisted by Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>He thought that there was no necessary relationship between the distortion of the script and his arrival, because even if he did not come, the direction of the eternal script would still be distorted by Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>And except for him, no one can fight against the foreign gods so easily.</p>

    <p>So he came to Eternity. To be precise, it was an inevitable choice.</p>

    <p>In order to destroy the outer gods and strangle this old power in the cradle, he and the people from the Office of Strategic Deception will appear here.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling was a little angry about this matter from the beginning. He felt that he was being used and was forcibly arranged to come to Eternity.</p>

    <p>Even now Wang Ling also wants to know who this person who went to great lengths to arrange for his coming to eternity is.</p>

    <p>But now he suddenly realized that the whole story of this matter didn't seem that important anymore...</p>

    <p>The only thing that is certain is that neither Fenmu Shen nor Bai Zhe has this ability.</p>

    <p>They were just taking advantage of the opportunity. They just knew that something was wrong with them, so they took advantage of every opportunity to deal with the Wang family and capture Wang Muyu while he was away.</p>

    <p>If you want to arrange him based on the abilities of these two people, they are still far away.</p>

    <p>This group of people. Wang Ling will also have to settle accounts sooner or later.</p>

    <p>Anyone who disturbs his peaceful daily life is unforgivable.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling looked at his palm, thinking deeply in his heart.</p>

    <p>In this universe now, there is only one person who can arrange him. Wang Ling can only think of one...</p>

    <p>So combine it with the truth at hand.</p>

    <p>The whole reason why he came to this eternal world starts with the incident where Chen Qin's classmate accidentally discovered that Li Xuan, a short video blogger who looked very similar to himself, suddenly disappeared from the world.</p>

    <p>If this incident was planned from beginning to end, then Wang Ling is almost certain that this Li Xuan is actually a fictional character that does not exist at all.</p>

    <p>Similar to Bai Zhe's brain ability. It is a chess piece created to guide order and promote the development of events...</p>

    <p>This truth also made Wang Ling slightly relieved.</p>

    <p>If it was just a fictional character that didn't exist, he would be much more relieved.</p>

    <p>Eternity, outer gods, the will of the universe... these things are too dangerous. He doesn't want innocent people to be involved.</p>

    <p>So now. Wang Ling still has to think carefully about how to explain to that classmate Chen Qin...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Have you been frozen in fear?" At this moment, Monk Jin Deng appeared behind Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He had left Peng Beicen under the care of Sun Rong. The people in the Office of Strategic Deception were also beginning to integrate their own resources to treat Peng Beicen's injuries.</p>

    <p>Plenty of pills were delivered to Peng Beicen's mouth for free. Anyway, they were just playing roles. These pills were not their own. They didn't feel distressed at all when using them.</p>

    <p>"Yes."Wang Ling looked at Peng Xiren. He nodded.</p>

    <p>To be honest, he really wants to squeeze Peng Xiren to death now.</p>

    <p>As an older brother, he could do such a cruel thing to his own sister. It is really unforgivable.</p>

    <p>But now, considering the overall historical process, he still needs Peng Xiren to be alive.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling took a deep breath and directly motioned to Monk Jin Deng to take action. He opened Peng Xiren's frozen palm and took away the last outer god insect cyst that Peng Xiren had taken from the outer god palace.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling only glared at the insect cyst. The insect cyst immediately turned into a ball of fly ash.</p>

    <p>Then he put his palm on Peng Xiren's head, erasing the memories related to foreign gods in Peng Xiren's head.</p>

    <p>Prevent Peng Xiren from having the idea of transforming Dao Ancestor Wang's Taoist inheritance scroll and creating the Yin Scroll of the Book of Nine Realms.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling is clear. This is only temporary.</p>

    <p>Including monk Jin Deng. They also clearly know Peng Xiren's fate.</p>

    <p>The monk sighed. Transmitted a message to Wang Ling: "This man is the chosen one by the Outer God. Even if his memory is cleared, he may still be guided to the path of the Outer God's recovery in the future."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded. The monk had the same idea as him.</p>

    <p>So now. The best way is to let Peng Xiren be bound by the Taoism. Until Wang Ling is born on earth. Let Peng Xiren be under direct supervision during this period.</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, Wang Ling took out Dao Ancestor Wang's Taoist inheritance scroll {Book of Nine Realms}. Then he opened the scroll directly, pointed it at Peng Xiren's face, and blurred it...</p>

    <p>Let Dao Ancestor Wang enforce supervision.</p>

    <p>This is what Wang Ling thought of.</p>

    <p>Originally Wang Ling was actually quite puzzling. Logically speaking, a founder-level figure like Dao Ancestor Wang would not choose such a bad apprentice.</p>

    <p>Now Wang Ling understands.</p>

    <p>This pot is not in Dao Ancestor Wang...</p>

    <p>After all, Peng Xiren was personally selected by himself. Wang Ling started to feel a little sympathy for Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>"By the way, monk. Why do you feel like you don't know about this?" At this time, Wang Ying suddenly became curious and asked through the message.</p>

    <p>Because judging from the current development process, Monk Jin Deng was fully involved in the whole process. It is impossible not to know about this matter.</p>

    <p>"The poor monk really doesn't know this. The time span is too long. Once we return to reality, the will of the universe will correct our memories of traveling through eternity in order to re-revise the order. I'm afraid there will only be Master of Shadows and Ling Zhenren by then. Still remember this incident." Monk Jin Deng said.</p>

    <p>"Is it the will of the universe? So the person who arranged for us to come to Eternity this time is actually..."</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ying frowned. Suddenly he thought of something, and a look of realization appeared on his face.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Thursday, January 8th. Everyone in Wang Ling who stayed in the Eternal Era for a long time finally returned to reality.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi and Sun Ying'er, who were nowhere to be found in the Eternal World, are also back.</p>

    <p>It's the same as what the monk said. Everyone has forgotten what happened to them in the Eternal Period. After coming back, their minds seem to be blank.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling vaguely felt that something was wrong. But he didn't think about it in detail.</p>

    <p>He was too tired to pay attention to many details. Anyway, the trajectory of eternity returned to normal as Peng Xiren inherited Dao Ancestor Wang's orthodox tradition. Wang Ling was relieved.</p>

    <p>Now, he just wants to get back to his daily routine as soon as possible and live an ordinary life comfortably...</p>

    <p>Next, just ask Sun Rong to find Chen Qin. Come up with a reason. Explain clearly what happened to the missing video blogger Li Xuan. Complete the task entrustment.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling returned home that day. When I turned on my phone, I was bombarded with a series of text messages.</p>

    <p>Even Wang Ling didn't expect it. He didn't go to school for just one day. There were many people in the class who cared about him.</p>

    <p>In a WeChat group called "Sixty Men Gang."</p>

    <p>What caught the eye was the "kind" condolences from Guo Hao; "No, Lingzi. Are you okay if you have something? If nothing happens, come out and say something and take a few steps! Do you know that Brother Wu in the entertainment industry? I have An uncle said that he had already gone in. He also heard that he was not honest in the house. He tried to open the lock with a toothpick. The result was an extra penalty! You didn't go in with him, did you?"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao answered: "What are you talking about? How could our son be this kind of person! [呲ya] Maybe. He went to save the world [funny]."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
