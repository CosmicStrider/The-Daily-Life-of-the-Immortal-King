  <h1>Chapter 1471 The Secret of Liangzi in the 9th Palace</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Holiday Inn Gujie is a time-honored brand on Xiu Zhen Cultivation Street. It was the first hotel established after the ancient street entered the business model.</p>

    <p>Huaguo Shuilian Group has a stake. And Zhuo Yi happens to have friends in this hotel.</p>

    <p>Since Jiugong Liangzi wants to conceal the identities of these three people and create the illusion that they died unexpectedly, it is completely unrealistic to use the temporary ID cards or passports of these three people to register.</p>

    <p>Fortunately. Everything has Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>It's just a matter of saying hello.</p>

    <p>Check in first. After two days Zhuo Yi will send someone to get the new ID cards of the three Viagra people. It is similar to the international "tainted witness protection mechanism." It can completely hide all clues about these three people.</p>

    <p>"It's all done."Zhuo Yi said with a serious face.</p>

    <p>He helped Jiugong Liangzi to take everything into consideration, and also secretly called a few brothers of the Office of Strategic Deception to come over to keep an eye on them, arranging a room right next to the three-person room that Viagra and the others were staying in.</p>

    <p>The left and right rooms and the location of the opposite door have all been booked by Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Of course. Jiugong Liangzi doesn't know these things.</p>

    <p>To be honest, so many things happened suddenly this time. Jiugong Liangzi felt that even if he was lucky enough to escape Bi Xianzi, he would still be in a hurry.</p>

    <p>If there is no Zhuo Yi. the situation may be more complicated.</p>

    <p>She looked at Zhuo Yi helplessly. She actually wanted to say thank you. But she happened to see Zhuo Yi's eyes staring at her. She quickly turned her blushing face away: "Huh! Don't use this. Look at me with squinting eyes. This is what you should do as a bodyguard."</p>

    <p>This is obviously not an angry voice. Zhuo Yi From this slightly playful voice, you can feel the girl's gratitude to him and the cuteness of the girl herself.</p>

    <p>"Understood." Zhuo Yi nodded. His eyes were full of tenderness.</p>

    <p>He had never believed what it was like to fall in love at first sight...</p>

    <p>Now. He knows.</p>

    <p>But emotional matters cannot be rushed. Although he is teasing, moderate teasing is the catalyst...excessive teasing.</p>

    <p>On the contrary, the opposite effect will occur.</p>

    <p>So in the next period of time, Zhuo Yi will behave very seriously.</p>

    <p>Relaxation and moderation is the way to go.</p>

    <p>As for opening a room...that's just talk.</p>

    <p>Even if he and the girl really lived in a house, it was impossible to really do anything to Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>After all, she is not yet an adult!</p>

    <p>At this time, the two of them were sitting on the mahogany sofa in the hotel lobby, each with their own thoughts in mind.</p>

    <p>Soon the girl's phone rang. It was the female bodyguard.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi quickly picked up: "Junko. Where are you?"</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry, Miss. I'm still going through extension procedures at the Immigration Bureau. I have to go to the hospital later. I remember I asked for leave from you yesterday. I just saw your message. But I may not be able to make it today. The way you came here..."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi held her forehead. She didn't expect that she would forget about it: "How much time do you need?"</p>

    <p>"If you hurry, we can arrive before six o'clock tomorrow morning. I can only ask the lady to look after it for a while."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>After pressing the phone, Jiugong Liangzi fell into silence.</p>

    <p>In this case, she has to stay in this hotel for one night...</p>

    <p>"Want to stay one night?" Zhuo Yi asked.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi has a high level of cultivation. It's not surprising that he has good hearing.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi glanced at Zhuo Yi and sneered: "What are you planning?"</p>

    <p>"I am a gentleman."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi Xiaoxiao: "If Jiugong wants to stay, I will arrange a room. But the three-person suite that Awei and three people live in are both full next door and opposite. I will arrange a room diagonally opposite. Are two single rooms okay?"</p>

    <p>"Two single rooms?"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi showed contempt in his eyes.</p>

    <p>She doesn't know why...</p>

    <p>The man in front of him suddenly became serious.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi looked at the girl in front of him and raised his eyebrows: "Or maybe Jiugong wants to be with me..."</p>

    <p>Before he finished speaking, he was directly interrupted by Jiugong Liangzi: "Stop it! There are only two single rooms. This is good! When Junko comes tomorrow morning, you come with me and return the extra room. It's over. But I still have to use your ID card to open the room..."</p>

    <p>"Understood..."Zhuo Yi nodded. He obeyed.</p>

    <p>The girl thought he needed an ID card to register. In fact, Zhuo Yi did not need it at all.</p>

    <p>And just when he turned his back to explain the situation to the hotel owner.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi buried his face deeply in his knees on the mahogany sofa...</p>

    <p>She has a reason why she absolutely cannot show her ID card.</p>

    <p>Because this is. her secret.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. Cold Weapon Shop. The Stone Spear thrown by Wang Ling directly opened a large hole in the ceiling of the weapon shop.</p>

    <p>This is not the original intention of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He planned to deliberately slip his hand when throwing it, and then get the snack coupon.</p>

    <p>The result was in the direction he threw it. I happened to see something happening over there at Zhuo Yi... so I helped out.</p>

    <p>He used his power carefully. He was afraid that he would use too much force and cause the Stone Spear to fly over his head.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, the ghosts released in Jiugong's {Ghost Book} were powerful enough and happened to stand in a straight row, forming a force of resistance that perfectly blocked the subsequent impact of the Stone Spear.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling...Are you so powerful?" Guo Hao and others all showed incredulous expressions.</p>

    <p>And soon. Zhuo Yi had sent people over there to bring back the thrown Stone Spear.</p>

    <p>As soon as Guo Hao got it, he immediately smiled and realized something was wrong: "I see..."</p>

    <p>"What's going on?" Li Youyue was curious.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao then threw the Stone Spear to Li Youyue.</p>

    <p>"You're going to die...such a heavy thing!" Li Youyue took it with both hands. After taking it, she was surprised to find that the Stone Spear was as light as a feather in her hands.</p>

    <p>"This is it!" It was only then that Li Youyue suddenly realized.</p>

    <p>"The perfect use of {{Light Body Technique}. I didn't expect that Wang Ling would use Light Body Technique in such a place." Guo Hao said with a smile.</p>

    <p>If this spell is used, the weight of the Stone Spear changes, making the Stone Spear as light as a feather. Then it is not surprising that it can fly such a long distance.</p>

    <p>Even with the power of the Foundation Building stage, it can be done.</p>

    <p>Of course. This {Light Body Technique} was not used by Wang Ling. It was Zhuo Yi who guessed the origin of the Stone Spear after seeing it.</p>

    <p>Then as the first disciple of Wang Ling, Zhuo Yi directly cast this spell on Stone Spear without saying a word to help Wang Ling cover.</p>

    <p>There is no need for text messages to communicate. There is no need for voice transmission thousands of miles away.</p>

    <p>This is an invisible tacit understanding between master and disciple.</p>

    <p>"But this is considered cheating...does it still count?" At this time, Guo Hao looked at the store manager and asked.</p>

    <p>"..." The store manager smiled.</p>

    <p>Use spells. This is of course not allowed...</p>

    <p>In fact, no matter what score Wang Ling loses, he can eventually qualify for the snack lottery.</p>

    <p>Because that was originally the plan arranged by Mr. Boss Sun.</p>

    <p>But others don't know this.</p>

    <p>So Sun Rong quickly turned his attention.</p>

    <p>She didn't say anything. She just stared at the store manager. The store manager broke into a cold sweat.</p>

    <p>Store manager: "I didn't say..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "So?"</p>

    <p>Store manager: "So. This is not cheating. It's just a reasonable use of magic..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong smiled. Continue to stare at him.</p>

    <p>The store manager wiped his sweat and continued: "Congratulations to classmate Wang Ling for winning the first prize of a marrow cleansing pill. In addition, as a reward for the reasonable use of spells... classmate Wang Ling will receive a gift from our store. 100 snack raffle tickets."</p>

    <p>Very good.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong nodded with satisfaction.</p>
