  <h1>Chapter 1969 Divine soldiers descend from heaven</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Yuanxi...</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan chewed the name carefully. It felt inexplicably pleasant. She was a little surprised at Wang Ling's naming ability. This was more useless than some of the more procrastinating names. The pen name started with nine strokes. The author is much better.</p>

    <p>Although she didn't know what the name meant, Zhang Linyan felt in an instant that a great work of art was born.</p>

    <p>"This figurine is really interesting." Li Changzhe was having fun playing with the flat screen. In fact, it should be considered such a confidential place. This kind of flat screen should have an encryption mechanism. It is impossible to let anyone People can tamper with the data inside at will.</p>

    <p>But Li Changzhe didn't know why all these things were undefended. It seemed that he was deliberately waiting for them to modify them.</p>

    <p>In fact, at the moment when Wang Ling was named, my heart suddenly became enlightened...</p>

    <p>If his guess is correct, this is probably Wang Ming's fault.</p>

    <p>The three of them counted the capsule cabins in the passage. There were 500 capsule cabins in total and 400 empty capsule cabins. The remaining 100 glass capsule cabins were all unfinished products. Or the data was not complete. Import the completed figurines. You can see the real progress data on the tablet screen connected to each figurine.</p>

    <p>The tallest figurine is 93% complete, with 7% left before it can be put into use.</p>

    <p>"Why are there empty ones?" Zhang Linyan asked.</p>

    <p>"Someone should have been here before us." Li Changzhe said: "We came in through an unexpected entrance. This underground palace is so big. There must be other entrances and exits."</p>

    <p>"Doesn't that mean...at least four hundred human figurines have been put into use?"</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan was shocked: "We came a step too late!"</p>

    <p>She realized that blowing up the figurines now seemed to be of no use.</p>

    <p>The initial combat power of these four hundred personal figurines is the peak of the Golden Core in the later stage. And they will continue to accumulate experience with the battle. It is even possible to break through! Yes! Modern high-level figurines can also break through the combat power. They will use Use your own AI system to record the gains and losses of each battle, thereby better summarizing experience.</p>

    <p>In other words, once these figurines are put on the battlefield and tempered for a long enough time, their combat power may reach the level of the early Nascent Soul stage at any time.</p>

    <p>As for these terrifying human figurines, Wuxiang Peak has invested 400 of them now!</p>

    <p>Even if they don't take the initiative to attack, they just stay on the sect's peak and fight positional battles. The defensive counterattack of four hundred human figurines relies on the terrain. It can make all the intruders drink a pot!</p>

    <p>"There are only 50 students from various countries participating in the trial this time. A dozen of them followed Qu Shuling into the Wuxiang Peak. The remaining elites from the twenty peaks plus local disciples from each peak...the total is less than 80 people." Zhang Linyan quickly calculated the suddenly increased number of people.</p>

    <p>For Wuxiang Peak, after revealing the details of the human figurines in the underground palace, this battle is already a rich battle with the number of people approaching 6:1.</p>

    <p>Moreover, Zhang Linyan speculated that they must rely on the human figurines to carry out defensive counterattacks, rather than taking the initiative to eliminate all these elites. The final goal was to forcefully delay until the day of the sect competition.</p>

    <p>It was already at the critical juncture of victory. However, the opponent sent out this kind of dimensionality-reducing strike force to defend. I wonder how serious this blow to the morale of the Twenty-Feng Alliance was.</p>

    <p>There may even be situations where you surrender to the enemy midway...</p>

    <p>If this is the case, then the elite cultivators from various countries who represent the Twenty Peaks and stand on the other side of Qu Shuling will be slapped hard.</p>

    <p>It doesn't matter whether Wuxiang Peak has used its secrets or not. The important point is that they joined forces with the Twenty Peaks. They can't even take down Wuxiang Peak where Qu Shuling is.</p>

    <p>If this matter is leaked, they will be very embarrassed.</p>

    <p>"There must be a chance..."</p>

    <p>Listening to Zhang Linyan's analysis, Li Changzhe frowned. At the same time, he was also thinking: "If we can use the remaining 100 human figurines here to join us, there may be a chance..."</p>

    <p>He stared at these human figurines. A special thought arose in his heart.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, these human figurines are missing arms and legs. In fact, this situation is caused by the insufficient production of psychic clay. It takes a long time to purify high-grade psychic clay. But now it is not difficult to pinch people. These capsules There is a robotic arm in the cabin. You just need to input the conceptual drawings on the tablet. It is very convenient to pinch a person out.</p>

    <p>"What do you think would happen if we put all these people with missing arms and lameness together?" At this time, Li Changzhe suggested.</p>

    <p>"But in this case, we won't have a hundred human figurines... We have to reduce them by at least half! We already can't beat them!" Zhang Linyan held her forehead and felt that her brain hurt.</p>

    <p>"No...I mean. Reintegrate all the remaining psychic clay. Then design new drawings. Knead again!"</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe was already a little excited. He pointed directly at a tablet and started to operate: "First, select all the human figurines from here to here!"</p>

    <p>"You missed two choices..."</p>

    <p>"These two are not important. One is pinching myself. The other is pinching Wang Yuanxi, who was just named by classmate Wang Ling. It is of commemorative significance. How can they be crushed and pinched together."</p>

    <p>"Good guy. You're also bringing in private goods..." Zhang Linyan chuckled.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry about the details. The point is my drawings."</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe chuckled. He quickly used his fingers to outline the appearance of the newly designed figurine on the screen. In less than three minutes, the general appearance was completed.</p>

    <p>Then, he stepped aside and showed it to everyone very proudly: "Look! How is it!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw the design drawings of the new figurines. He fell into deep thinking. He sighed in his heart. He felt that Li Changzhe's talkativeness could really be called a genius in a sense.</p>

    <p>"This...is this your new design?"</p>

    <p>Zhang Linyan was also dumbfounded: "It's quite delicate...but the body proportions seem a bit...you must think this is not a normal human figurine. Why does it look like a hobbit?"</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe: "I did it on purpose. I just looked too short in the photo. And I don't agree with you saying he is a Hobbit. With my small and exquisite size, even a Hobbit should be a dwarf in The Hobbit."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Zhang Linyan: "..."</p>

    <p>But in this way, they finally understood Li Changzhe's thoughts.</p>

    <p>Indeed...</p>

    <p>If you do not create human figurines according to normal proportions, but re-integrate the psychic clay to create new ones according to the drawings and designs of these dwarf human figurines.</p>

    <p>Based on the current psychic clay consolidation reserves, they will eventually get about 1,000 dwarf figurines...</p>

    <p>Behind Wang Ling, Tieyi and other miners were also dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>This is Li Changzhe!</p>

    <p>What a fucking genius!</p>
