  <h1>Chapter 1338 Sun Ying'er Earth Supervision Plan</h1>

  <div>

    <p>A battle for the soul and the body ended with the directional amnesia of cultivators all over the world.</p>

    <p>It is confirmed that Sun Rong has returned to the physical body. After being able to carry out normal activities.</p>

    <p>Mr. Sun, the boss of Huaguo Shuilian Group, was very excited.</p>

    <p>All the staff of the hospital and the employees of the group cheered.</p>

    <p>In front of the Office of Strategic Deception Mountain. Mr. Boss Sun arranged for someone to take Sun Rong back. He shook hands with Lord Diulei sincerely: "Thank you, True Lord, for your help!"</p>

    <p>Although the girl is fine.</p>

    <p>However, the old man is still a little worried. He wants Sun Rong to go back to the hospital for another detailed examination.</p>

    <p>"It's all a matter of effort. It's the result of everyone's joint efforts." Lord Diulei said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, Mr. Zhen. All losses to the Office of Strategic Deception, including the damaged buildings, will be covered by our Huaguo Shuilian Group." The old man smiled happily.</p>

    <p>"Hahaha! You're welcome, sir." Lord Diulei smiled even more happily.</p>

    <p>Although Boss Sun doesn't remember what happened. He just heard that someone was a villain who caused great damage in the Office of Strategic Deception in order to steal his granddaughter's body.</p>

    <p>With the full cooperation of the entire Office of Strategic Deception, his granddaughter's body recovered as before. Even the villain was shot dead on the spot.</p>

    <p>Now that the bad guy has been killed.</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan naturally no longer cared.</p>

    <p>For Boss Sun.</p>

    <p>Nothing is more important than the health of your granddaughter!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Half an hour later. In the hall of True Venerated Immortal.</p>

    <p>Faced with his criminal and illegal behavior of deliberately destroying the earth and destroying the unity of cultivators, Sun Ying'er confessed to this.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er. In fact, he is the evildoer rumored to have been killed.</p>

    <p>"I was wrong. I was really wrong. I shouldn't have come to Earth in the first place. If I hadn't come to Earth..."</p>

    <p>The white-haired girl knelt devoutly in the hall of True Venerated Immortal. She sincerely repented.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying was on the side, staring at her with his arms folded.</p>

    <p>At this time, it has been some time since {Planet thumping technique} passed.</p>

    <p>However, Sun Ying'er still had lingering fears. She lowered her eyes and stared at the "claw marks" on her two wrists with her peripheral vision.</p>

    <p>This was left when Wang Ying pinched her.</p>

    <p>And, as if deliberately declaring sovereignty, he left his own mark.</p>

    <p>"I know what you are thinking." Wang Ying stared at Sun Ying'er: "You are the Lord of the Void. It is not difficult for you to chop off your hand and then regenerate it."</p>

    <p>"How do you know..." Sun Ying'er was shocked.</p>

    <p>Because she did have the idea of chopping off her hands.</p>

    <p>She is the new Lord of the Void, but someone has left a mark on her. How can she lead the Void and gain a foothold in the entire Void World when word spreads about this?</p>

    <p>"In front of me, any calculation is useless."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying smiled: "I can tell you clearly. The mark on the wrist cannot be erased. It is a mark that is like being engraved in the soul. No matter where the person who is engraved by me escapes, I can instantly escape. Found it."</p>

    <p>"You...went too far..."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er raised his head. Tears couldn't help but well up in his eyes again.</p>

    <p>"If it weren't for the fact that you are Miss Sun's shadow, you would have died long ago."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying shrugged: "Now you have only one choice. That is to stay on earth and accept my supervision. After all, you are indeed a dangerous person."</p>

    <p>Now Sun Rong's plan to return to the void has been terminated.</p>

    <p>The main reason is because Sun Ying'er is currently on Earth.</p>

    <p>As long as the Lord of the Void is always under surveillance, then Sun Rong will naturally not be in danger.</p>

    <p>As for choosing who to monitor Sun Ying'er.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that there is really no one more suitable than Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>Let Shadow handle the matter.</p>

    <p>Nothing wrong with it.</p>

    <p>"I object!" In the hall of True Venerated Immortal. Although Sun Ying'er has already admitted his mistake.</p>

    <p>But facing the outcome of being supervised on earth, the girl still felt extremely dissatisfied.</p>

    <p>This is not supervision... this is simply imprisonment!</p>

    <p>"Objection is invalid.</p>

    <p>"At this time, Lord Diulei also stood up. Looking at the rest of the people in the True Venerated Immortal Hall: "Everyone, let's vote. Those who agree with Miss Sun Ying'er's plan to supervise the earth, please raise your hands."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi, Fang Xing, Monk Jin Deng, Immortal Zhenyuan, Miss Ajuan, the new Crispy Noodles Dao Lord, the bandaged Heavenly Dao... Almost all the core members have come to the temple.</p>

    <p>As soon as Lord Diulei finished speaking, everyone raised their hands in an unusually synchronized manner.</p>

    <p>"The minority obeys the majority. The proposal is passed!" Lord Diulei nodded with satisfaction.</p>

    <p>The matter was thus settled.</p>

    <p>"You...you wait! Wait until I return to the void. I will destroy the Office of Strategic Deception first..." Sun Ying'er stood up from his kneeling position in anger.</p>

    <p>"Huh?" At this time, Wang Ying raised his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>The girl planned to continue to yell and say something even more extreme.</p>

    <p>As a result, Wang Ying looked at him and forced him back. He knelt back again.</p>

    <p>"I...I accept..." Sun Ying'er was about to burst into tears.</p>

    <p>Under Wang Ying's coercion, he had no choice but to agree to the conditions.</p>

    <p>"very good."</p>

    <p>At this point, Wang Ying nodded with satisfaction: "While you are under my supervision on Earth, please be sure to do the following."</p>

    <p>"Say first..." Sun Ying'er seemed like an angry little daughter-in-law. Facing Wang Ying, she really had no temper at all.</p>

    <p>"First, after you return to Miss Sun's body, you are not allowed to cause trouble again. During the day, you will be Miss Sun's shadow."</p>

    <p>"What about tonight?"</p>

    <p>"Come to me in the evening to write a self-review. I will come to check your homework. During your time on earth, you must complete a self-review of no less than 800 words every day. You can write it in a diary, but you are not allowed to add water. You need to express your true feelings."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Second, Miss Sun has not returned to the void. So the only real strength is the Foundation Building. As a shadow, you still have to protect Miss Sun at all times. Treat her like your own mother."</p>

    <p>"Dear...mother?"</p>

    <p>"Not a real mother. But better than a real mother."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying said categorically: "Just like my father-in-law. Although I always call him my father-in-law, I know that he is my biological father."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er discovered that Wang Ying was really shameless.</p>

    <p>With her temper, she would have retorted long ago.</p>

    <p>But now, she doesn't dare.</p>

    <p>"Third, there is the problem of Miss Sun's memory. Sun Rong Miss Sun's soul developed an extremely rare phenomenon of delayed amnesia after returning to the body. I estimate that the time is almost up. Miss Sun will soon forget herself. In the soul state. Everything that happens."Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>"But I know. She has a record..." Sun Ying'er said.</p>

    <p>"That's what I want to tell you."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying looked at Sun Ying'er and said: "Miss Sun's cloud disk has records. In order to prevent accidents, your task after returning is to clear all these records!"</p>

    <p>"Okay...I understand..."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er lowered his head and agreed.</p>

    <p>"very good."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying nodded: "There are still a few thousand left. I will tell you when I think of them. You can return to Classmate Sun's body and continue to be a shadow."</p>

    <p>After that, Wang Ying waved his hand and watched Sun Ying'er leave here as if he was running away.</p>

    <p>On the way back to Sun Rong's physical body.</p>

    <p>The hatred for Wang Ying in Sun Ying'er's heart became even stronger.</p>

    <p>Hum...╭(╯^╰)╮!</p>

    <p>You actually want to instruct her to delete the memories in those cloud disks?</p>

    <p>Don't even think about it!</p>

    <p>She refused to delete it! During the flight, Sun Ying'er suddenly turned around and stuck out her tongue in the direction of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Even if I can't beat you, I'll still piss you off! Just a little bit!</p>
