  <h1>Chapter 2055 Strange mounts are added again</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Even Mr. Gray Mist himself would not have thought that the claw he was about to dig into the fifth map would actually directly poke the bear's butt. And it was a bear's butt that it was very familiar with.</p>

    <p>As one of Dao Ancestor Wang's mythical beasts, he has a certain understanding of his fellow marmot. This big guy bathed in thunder is also a mythical beast. Although his words and deeds are not as profound as it, his level is not as high as it. Down.</p>

    <p>Dao Ancestor Wang also gave it a name: Thunder Eater! Another name... Thunder Roar!</p>

    <p>After being conceived from chaos, it was once released on the planet Tribulation Transcendence by Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>That is a planet that is surrounded by thick thunder all year round.</p>

    <p>As long as you live on this planet for one day, you will be bathed in a steady stream of lightning disasters every day.</p>

    <p>And the most terrifying thing is that the intelligence level of the planet spirit of this Tribulation Transcendence star is not low. It will adjust the intensity of its own lightning strikes according to the strength of the living beings.</p>

    <p>That is not a place where normal creatures can stay. Relying on the damage reduction effect of Chaos Gray Mist, Mr. Gray Mist personally stepped into the Tribulation Transcendence planet to find this white bear several times. As a result, he was hacked every time. Charred on the outside and tender on the inside.</p>

    <p>Of course. Now it is naturally fearless. It was a long, long time ago that it was burnt black by electricity. It is only because of the shadow in childhood that it still feels a little afraid of the Tribulation Transcendence star.</p>

    <p>"Lao Lei. I didn't expect you to be here..."</p>

    <p>At this moment, they met again. This stupid prairie dog was obviously stunned. After hesitating for a moment, its subconscious reaction was not to choose force. Instead, it planned to get close first.</p>

    <p>Although it feels that this stupid bear doesn't like it, in the final analysis it can be regarded as a "teacher from the same school", so it won't attack as soon as it comes up.</p>

    <p>What the groundhog never expected was that as soon as he finished speaking, the white bear condensed his huge body into a three-meter-long body. The white hairs all over his body were floating. The constantly beating thunder light directly announced. This thunder-devouring beast has entered combat mode.</p>

    <p>"Get out! Get out!" It roared. It only said this. The blue pupils flashed with thunder, showing the mark of thunder.</p>

    <p>"You don't recognize me anymore? I'm Gray Mist!"</p>

    <p>"Ha. The Hui Wu I know is stupid, but he is definitely not a female."</p>

    <p>"You think I want to do this... Didn't this happen because of an accident..."</p>

    <p>"Then I don't care. Get out! Get out of here!" It looked very manic. And it didn't listen to advice. It was lying at the end of the tunnel. It looked like no one could pass through here.</p>

    <p>Why...</p>

    <p>The groundhog sighed in his heart. Although he felt that he and this stupid bear were not compatible from the beginning, he never expected that this stupid bear could be so stupid.</p>

    <p>Who do you think I am taking off my mask for?</p>

    <p>Just for the sake of being a "teacher from the same family", I want to save you some physical pain. I didn't expect that you don't know what's good and what's good. You're going to take action right away.</p>

    <p>Do it, right?</p>

    <p>I'm not afraid of you!</p>

    <p>Seeing the groundhog straighten its back and assume a posture that showed no fear at all. The thunder-devouring beast thought that this stupid groundhog that it had not seen for almost ten thousand years was going to fight with it.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, the other party actually stepped aside and made a respectful gesture to the handsome and handsome man behind him.</p>

    <p>Thunder Eater: "?"</p>

    <p>Like everyone else. Without knowing the true strength of Wang Ling, most people will show great disdain and disdain for this young man who can be called a newborn calf when they first see Wang Ling. Attitude.</p>

    <p>Judging age by "vigor." This is just a seventeen-year-old boy. What can he do?</p>

    <p>The Thunder Eater immediately snorted: "You stupid groundhog. You are still so stupid after so many years... You want to hide behind a kid."</p>

    <p>"You guy... you must have known it was me a long time ago! You actually made trouble with my gender. You are deliberately stirring up trouble! You just want to quarrel with me!" The corner of the groundhog's mouth twitched. However, he endured it. After a while, he did not attack directly. Instead, he planned to leave the entire battle to the young man behind him.</p>

    <p>Regarding mythical beasts, what would be the attitude of ordinary monks when they see them? They will definitely think that this is a rare thing in the world. They would like to catch one and take it home to raise it.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling didn't take these so-called mythical beasts seriously at all.</p>

    <p>After all, with his own strength, it is not difficult to create a divine beast with his bare hands.</p>

    <p>Er Ha, Xiao Yin. He transformed a demonic beast into a spiritual beast and then upgraded to a divine beast. Now he has become a divine beast.</p>

    <p>The other started directly from the sacred beast. Now it has been successfully upgraded to a sacred beast.</p>

    <p>It can be said that these are the representatives of the two sacred beasts under Wang Ling. However, their strength is terrifying. In terms of current combat power, it is comparable to the strength of this marmot that has lived for eternity.</p>

    <p>How long has it been?</p>

    <p>The key is that both Er Ha and Xiao Yin still have room to grow. They have huge talents.</p>

    <p>So this thunder-eating beast. Wang Ling didn't take it seriously at all.</p>

    <p>Faced with its disdain and obstruction, Wang Ling's attitude is also very clear. That is... suppression!</p>

    <p>As a good young man educated in modern cultivation, killing animals indiscriminately is not the style advocated by Wang Ling. Animals and the like... still need to be protected.</p>

    <p>Although it looks down upon the mythical beasts, there are also members of the Divine Beast Protection Association among the Eternal Ones.</p>

    <p>There are so many pairs of eyes looking at me in this Supreme Corpse Map. Wang Ling doesn't want to be blamed.</p>

    <p>Therefore, without saying a word, he directly raised his palm and then pressed it down violently, adopting the simplest and most brutal method of suppression.</p>

    <p>When the palm of the hand fell slightly downward, the huge spiritual pressure caused the void around the Thunder Eater to distort. The fingers were as white as jade and the phalanges were clearly defined. It was hard to believe that such a pair of young palms that looked so immature could actually bring about Such unparalleled oppressive power.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The suppressive power of this strike was astonishing. It could be called a sky-shattering one. The Thunder Eater, which had already entered combat mode, had no room for resistance. In the tunnel space that had been opened, its huge body was directly embedded deeply into the earth.</p>

    <p>It can be seen that Wang Ling's expression is very relaxed. After all, he has just fought against the Ancestor King's Nian Feng Nian. No matter how strong the Thunder Eater is, it cannot be stronger than Nian Feng Nian.</p>

    <p>"What a strong fluctuation... it must be classmate Wang Ling..."</p>

    <p>On the second map, Ice Purgatory. Sun Rong could not help but show worry again on his face.</p>

    <p>Even across several maps, she could detect the vibration coming from the depths of her ancestral land. Although she was not entirely sure of the source of the spiritual power of the vibration, she could almost sense it with her sixth sense. The vibration was due to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>My home is really going to be lost...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong couldn't laugh or cry. I couldn't help but mutter in my heart. I felt helpless inside.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile on the other side.</p>

    <p>Seeing that the Thunder Devouring Beast had been completely pressed into him and unable to move, Wang Ling put his trouser pockets in and strolled away leisurely.</p>

    <p>I heard that this thunder-devouring beast, which was still arrogant at first, immediately gave up.</p>

    <p>Although it doesn't know why Wang Ling is so powerful. He is still only seventeen years old... and it doesn't even know where Wang Ling came from as an immortal god.</p>

    <p>But in the process of being suppressed just now, the fear coming from the soul is indeed real.</p>

    <p>"Boss!"</p>

    <p>It immediately begged for mercy.</p>

    <p>Then, he raised his bear head and stared at Wang Ling. He asked without restraint: "Boss... do you still need a mount?"</p>
