  <h1>Chapter 1482 The Magical Uses of White Rabbit Milk Candy</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After realizing that his identity had been revealed, this burly man who was three meters tall finally took off his human skin coat.</p>

    <p>This is a specially made painting skin that allows its body to be hidden within it without being discovered.</p>

    <p>The six lords Heavenly Dao in Heaven also have the same thing. Now the "human skin coat" worn by the Death Heavenly Dao as a guard at 60 High School in the lower realm should be the same style as the one worn by the alien.</p>

    <p>This is a very powerful camouflage method. It is difficult for ordinary cultivators to distinguish. If it were not related to Aohai, maybe Sun Rong would not be aware of the abnormality.</p>

    <p>The moment the human skin coat was torn off, two huge silver horns emerged from the scalp of the three-meter-tall monster. The silver horns were densely covered with threads. They exuded a strange luster and curled backwards.</p>

    <p>This is a humanoid alien creature. Silver-horned Duyan, with a sharp chin and a strange dark yellow pupil.</p>

    <p>The skin all over his body is densely covered with a kind of lin armor with metallic luster.</p>

    <p>The tail, which is two meters long, is even covered with sharp undercuts.</p>

    <p>The girl looked at the creature that revealed its true form. She couldn't help but feel a little stunned in her heart.</p>

    <p>Because the chest part of this creature is actually transparent. There is something shining like crystal entrenched inside.</p>

    <p>"What the hell is this..." Even Sun Ying'er has never seen such a creature.</p>

    <p>You must know that her mind contains information about the entire void!</p>

    <p>The history of the void is extremely long. It stands to reason that Sun Ying'er himself knows a lot of those alien beings. But he has never seen anything like this... Alien Iron Man.</p>

    <p>That's right. The more she looked at it, the more she felt that there was something glowing in the transparent chest area of this alien creature.</p>

    <p>Just like Iron Man's energy reactor...</p>

    <p>"My appearance. Isn't it very mighty and domineering?"</p>

    <p>The Silver Horn man spoke. In fact, he didn't care too much about Sun Rong's opinion: "This is the earth. The aesthetics of the people on the earth are basically normal for the average level of the universe."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>It was also the first time for the girl to fight against aliens.</p>

    <p>Because she didn't know what the other party's strategy was, the expression on the girl's face was extremely cautious.</p>

    <p>However, judging from how well the other party knows him, Sun Rong roughly infers that the "senior" mentioned by this alien may be Peng Xiren from a while ago...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong remembers that he had witnessed everything the last time he hid in the core world of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>And it is still vivid in my mind to this day.</p>

    <p>The young man who suddenly jumped out and wanted to cause trouble was almost beaten to death by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Later, he thought he had successfully taken away the old Rubik's Cube on Earth and returned to the infinite galaxy.</p>

    <p>Then. She heard that there seemed to be a big explosion deep in the infinite galaxy.</p>

    <p>Maybe Peng Xiren and the sealed creature are dead.</p>

    <p>However, judging from the current situation, the other party is not only safe and sound.</p>

    <p>Even narcissistic aliens from the infinite galaxy were sent...</p>

    <p>"Just deal with it." At this time, Sun Rong closed his eyes slightly. He had already made plans to summon Aohai.</p>

    <p>Although she really wanted to know what the connection was between the silver-horned alien in front of her and that Peng Xiren... but in this situation, human life still mattered. It was not realistic to consider capturing him alive.</p>

    <p>Because she doesn't know anything about this silver-horned alien at all.</p>

    <p>The life safety of Jiang Yingying and Wei Zhi comes first.</p>

    <p>To rescue these two people, the simplest and crudest solution is to kill the alien completely.</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun, I like your eyes very much. I also appreciate your courage... You are obviously only in the Foundation Building stage. In my hometown, your level is not as good as a speck of dust." said the silver-horned creature.</p>

    <p>"No need to talk nonsense." Sun Rong frowned.</p>

    <p>"So. You don't even care about your friend's life?"</p>

    <p>The silver-horned man sneered. He didn't take the girl in front of him seriously at all: "I promise you, if you do it, you will definitely regret it later because of your stupid behavior..."</p>

    <p>Silver-horned creatures are very confident.</p>

    <p>Because he knew exactly who the person standing behind him was. He was the only true disciple of Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>And it was Peng Xiren who made their originally declining alien race collectively complete their evolution and become a higher life form.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren's request to him was that it would be best to capture Sun Rong alive.</p>

    <p>However, because the power gap is too obvious, the Silver Horns are worried that if they take action, this Earth girl who is only in the Foundation Building stage may turn into fly ash and die.</p>

    <p>Then, using her friends to threaten her might be the safest and most reliable way to capture her alive.</p>

    <p>"Leave here with me. I promise I won't hurt you. And you can save the lives of your two friends."</p>

    <p>The silver-horned man smiled: "But if you resist, you know the consequences... With your humble state, I will crush this little girl's head the moment you take action. See who is faster, you or me. quick."</p>

    <p>"So. Can I ask another question?"</p>

    <p>"Of course. If you have any questions, just leave with me and I can answer them." The Silver-Horned Man said politely.</p>

    <p>"You must have accomplices. Are those accomplices also aliens?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"nice."</p>

    <p>The Silver Horn said: "In fact, there are many aliens who have come to the earth. They wear human skin coats. They are perfectly hidden among humans and carry out activities... For example, the Saiyans, the ugly nemesis, Root number nine-body star people and so on."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"My tribe has been dormant on the earth for a long time. However, their form is still the old form. I promise them that after completing this mission, I will help them evolve together..."</p>

    <p>"..." Hearing this, Sun Rong sighed silently in his heart.</p>

    <p>She actually didn't want to know that much at all. She didn't know if it was because of her overconfidence in herself and the need to show off.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, some parties that think they are powerful often like to talk nonsense before the war and reveal some information inexplicably.</p>

    <p>Maybe this type of people really feel that there is no threat to the opponents they face, right?</p>

    <p>So it doesn't hurt to say more.</p>

    <p>"Okay. Thank you for the information. And welcome to Earth."</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Rong stared at the silver-horned man in front of him and smiled.</p>

    <p>Human life is at stake. There is no time to delay.</p>

    <p>The Silver-Horned Man thought that the girl in front of him had completely given up resistance. He felt relieved in his heart, but he saw the girl suddenly summoned a blue spiritual sword.</p>

    <p>"Ten percent Alluring Sword and..."</p>

    <p>She did not draw the sword directly. She just flicked the sheath with her thumb, revealing a gap.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>In just an instant, a trace of Aohai's sword energy seeped out from this gap!</p>

    <p>The Alluring Sword is too powerful. This is the sword energy that the girl used based on the actual situation. It should be enough to deal with the silver-horned man in front of her.</p>

    <p>"You are looking for death!"</p>

    <p>The silver-horned man didn't expect that the little girl in front of him would be so stubborn.</p>

    <p>He became angry with shame. The yellow Duyan released murderous intent.</p>

    <p>And at the same time, he also has transportation power in his hands.</p>

    <p>As long as Sun Rong dares to take action, he will immediately crush the head of the girl named Jiang in his hand!</p>

    <p>This sentence. Silver Horn people do what they say!</p>

    <p>However, at this moment, a blue sword energy as thin as gossamer passed directly through his chest.</p>

    <p>The Silver Horned Man looked at this scene in disbelief.</p>

    <p>His chest was penetrated by Aohai's azure sword energy. All along his chest, his whole body froze rapidly.</p>

    <p>"Ten percent Alluring Sword." And "Absolute Zero."</p>

    <p>This is something Aohai has only recently realized. A powerful control ability. The purpose is to ensure that even if the concentrated version of the sword energy fails to achieve a fatal blow, it can also provide a second layer of insurance.</p>

    <p>If you are hit by Aohai's "Absolute Zero" sword energy, you will be instantly frozen like this.</p>

    <p>"Cut!"</p>

    <p>A boundless breath of the sea emanates from Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>She still didn't take out the scabbard. She quickly stepped forward and easily cut off the Silver-Horned Man's right arm that was holding Jiang Yingying with only the scabbard.</p>

    <p>Then he cut off the silver-horned man's head with a sword.</p>

    <p>There were no unnecessary movements. But the girl standing forward in Hanfu was still the most brilliant glazed fireworks tonight...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It's all finally over.</p>

    <p>Then. Sun Rong freed Jiang Yingying from the broken right hand of the Silver Horn Man. Then he confirmed her vital signs.</p>

    <p>The heartbeat is stable and the pulse is normal. It's just that there are some drug ingredients in the blood.</p>

    <p>Judging from the setting that Jiang Yingying was caught here wearing only a nightgown... he must have been drugged by those aliens when he was preparing for an essential oil massage in the hotel. here.</p>

    <p>"But it's okay." Sun Rong secretly breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>Then she went to look for Wei Zhi.</p>

    <p>It's a pity that Wei Zhi's condition is not good.</p>

    <p>The girl found Wei Zhi in the corner of this abandoned factory.</p>

    <p>His face was pale. His whole body became stiff. He had been dead for at least 2 hours...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong never expected that Wei Zhi had been brutally murdered.</p>

    <p>"How could..." She immediately differentiated Aohai's healing sword energy to treat him.</p>

    <p>But alas. All this is in vain.</p>

    <p>"Hey. There's nothing you can do if you die. No matter how strong Aohai's healing sword energy is, he can't save someone who has been dead for 2 hours."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er comforted him on the side: "Unless there is a stronger method than Aohai's healing sword energy. Probably only Ling Zhenren can do it."</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling..."</p>

    <p>At this time. Sun Rong suddenly thought of something: "By the way! I still have this! If only I have this! I will definitely be able to..."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er saw Sun Rong groping in Aohai's sword spirit space with his eyes closed.</p>

    <p>When she finally opened her hands, a White Rabbit toffee appeared in the girl's hand.</p>

    <p>"Didn't you take insurance?" Sun Ying'er was stunned.</p>

    <p>"Just when you were taken out by the Master of Shadows for training and no longer with me, classmate Wang Ling gave me another one..." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>She didn't hesitate at all. She directly opened the candy wrapper and stuffed it into Wei Zhi's mouth.</p>

    <p>Buzz...</p>

    <p>A warm golden light surged from Wei Zhi's body.</p>

    <p>In less than five seconds, Sun Rong felt Wei Zhi's breath coming back.</p>

    <p>"Effective!" At this point. Sun Rong felt like a stone fell from his heart instantly.</p>

    <p>If Wei Zhi died because of her, she would definitely feel guilty for the rest of her life...</p>

    <p>Classmate Wang Ling. I owe you another favor!</p>

    <p>The girl showed her face and smiled.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wei Zhi also successfully opened his eyes: "Uh..."</p>

    <p>He felt like he had a nightmare. A group of aliens abducted him and tortured him...</p>

    <p>And now. The dream has finally awakened.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi sat up straight. He saw Sun Rong at a glance: "Miss Sun Rong. Why are you here..."</p>

    <p>"Don't say anything, Brother Wei Zhi. How do you feel now? Are you feeling uncomfortable anywhere?" Sun Rong asked with concern.</p>

    <p>"Uncomfortable..." Wei Zhi frowned: "I don't feel particularly uncomfortable anywhere. I just feel that my chest is a bit heavy."</p>

    <p>"Breasts...heavy?" Sun Rong was stunned.</p>

    <p>Then I saw Wei Zhi frowning and touching his chest. The expression on his face was completely shocked: "What... what is this! Why do I have two airbags!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "Brother Wei Zhi, please don't get excited..."</p>

    <p>"No! It must be my nightmare that I haven't woken up from yet."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Please, Miss Sun Rong, please don't wake me up again! I want to... sleep for a while..."</p>

    <p>After saying that, Wei Zhi's eyes went dark and he fainted again.</p>

    <p>"Ying'er. What should I do..."Sun Rong was a little at a loss.</p>

    <p>"It's really big." Sun Ying'er sighed: "Let's take it back first and then talk about it. After all, it's really hard for people to accept the fact that you wake up and become a transvestite."</p>
