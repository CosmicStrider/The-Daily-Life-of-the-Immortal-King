  <h1>Chapter 2147 Talent Recruitment Interview</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Two level 30 Sealer couples came to negotiate with him, which surprised Xiong Wu. Although most of the players in the Four Elephants Clan are Sword Immortals, there is no hard and fast rule that they are not allowed to recruit other players.</p>

    <p>After all, the game has the option of changing jobs after reaching level 50. As long as you contribute enough to the guild, you can continue to stay in the guild and transfer to Sword Immortal. If you contribute enough, it will be no problem even if you don't change jobs.</p>

    <p>But two level 30 sealer players mixed in the team and made it to the last level unscathed. This aroused Xiong Wu's huge interest.</p>

    <p>"You two can actually get here." The same reaction as Li Bai and Mang Shan. Xiong Wu was shocked. Even with the cover of others, very few low-level players could make it to the final level in this instance.</p>

    <p>The final boss of the Black Dragon Cave, the Black Dragon, can kill players who are not at the required level instantly with just one Roar.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi and Jiugong Liangzi remained calm and started performing a crosstalk routine.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi: "The president of the White Horse Guild and the president of the Shanye Villagers Guild. They have both set off for Fuyun Town. I don't know what is so strange about Fuyun Town."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Joke!?"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi: "They said there are some veteran players over there, and they want to go and recruit them."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Is something wrong?"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi: "It's absolutely true. It's just that I think our Four Elephants Guild has so many talented players. Players that can be targeted by Li Bai and Mang Shan must be extraordinary."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Okay!"</p>

    <p>As the couple sang in harmony, Xiong Wu became a little more interested. He had seen the name of Fuyun Town several times from the system notifications.</p>

    <p>A novice town can be on the system announcements one after another. This thing itself is not very scientific.</p>

    <p>He originally had no interest in Fuyun Town. But when he heard that Li Bai and Mang Shan had already passed by, an inexplicable sense of competition suddenly arose in his heart.</p>

    <p>That's just Xiong Wu's personality. No matter what it is, it's boring to just entertain yourself. You have to compete with others and take things from their hands to make it interesting.</p>

    <p>So he didn't think much and quickly took out a space teleportation scroll. He teleported to the place closest to Fuyun Town. He planned to fly directly there on his mount.</p>

    <p>In just the blink of an eye, the three guild leaders used teleportation scrolls to leave for Fuyun Town. This scene also alarmed many surrounding players.</p>

    <p>And Zhuo Yi went there for the purpose of building momentum. When these three conferences are moved, it can be said that it affects the whole body. It is equivalent to advertising Fuyun Town to the people around them in disguise.</p>

    <p>This gives Wang Ling and Sun Rong more rights to choose talents.</p>

    <p>But Jiugong Liangzi is still a little confused at the moment: "Your purpose is just to lure them to fight? It shouldn't be that simple, right?"</p>

    <p>In the private chat channel. Jiugong Liangzi communicates with Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>"That mighty warrior, he truly is mighty." Zhuo Yi replied.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi didn't react at first when she heard these words. But soon her face changed with shock: "This... can't be right? Are you talking about the really powerful one from the Four Elephants? He is really wanted criminal. .. How dare they?"</p>

    <p>"Although it is a game using a fake ID, and the name is also misleading. After all, if the name of the wanted criminal is directly used to show off. In most cases, people will not think that this is a real wanted criminal."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi said: "I was just testing his reaction. According to the information, Xiong Wu has such a character. He likes to compete with others. And the most important thing is the way he holds his sword."</p>

    <p>"Is it problematic?"</p>

    <p>"I have been observing for a long time. His posture when holding the sword is very strange. He is not a habitual one-handed sword user. It is obvious that he is more accustomed to using two-handed swords. And Xiong Wu is a large sword swordsman in the data. He is also a swordsman. The person with the highest cultivation among the four elephants."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi frowned and said: "He has been hiding everywhere in these years. There is no news. I still don't know where he is hiding. I didn't expect that he is actually playing this game."</p>

    <p>"..." Jiugong Liangzi heard this and didn't know what to say.</p>

    <p>Use the game to locate the wanted criminal and capture him. This was the first time she had heard of this operation.</p>

    <p>"Can... can we catch him?"</p>

    <p>But Jiugong Liangzi still has some doubts about this.</p>

    <p>Locating wanted criminals is one thing, but it's not certain that we can catch them.</p>

    <p>If the other party notices this, they can simply log off and escape.</p>

    <p>"I have already asked Mr. Ming. Locate first. As long as he can find the accurate location, he can remotely control the game cabin to activate the good citizen mode."</p>

    <p>"Good Citizen... Mode..."</p>

    <p>"At that time, the game cabin will automatically close. Capture the criminal. At the same time, start the rocket thruster to automatically eject the entire cabin. Fall to the nearest police station within the game cabin's range."</p>

    <p>"But this game cabin... is it that strong!? This is an internationally wanted criminal. It will definitely be broken open!"</p>

    <p>"It's impossible to break."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi shook his head. He smiled and said: "The game cabin has a simple remote attunement spell, Talisman, built into it. This is what Bai Qiao asked my master to design when he originally developed the game cabin. It is just for necessary situations. Next, the entire game cabin can be reinforced. In other words, the current Xiong Wu cannot escape even if he has wings."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Xiong Wu, who was immersed in the game world, never thought that he would be plotted against like this.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the urban construction plans of Wang Ling and Sun Rong are also going smoothly. In addition to the expansion of scale, the happiness index of urban residents is also improving in an orderly manner.</p>

    <p>The most important thing is that because of Lao Huang's joining, "Wolongs<sup>1</sup>" from surrounding towns have gradually begun to pour into Fuyun Town.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>("臥龍" "Sleeping Dragons")</dfn>

    <p>And Lao Huang surprisingly became the interviewer for talent recruitment together with Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Facing all kinds of talents. Sun Rong and Lao Huang have similar ideas. In addition to combat-oriented talented players, players with flexible economic thinking are also very important.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the criterion for measuring talent is not just equipment and level. Whether you have a flexible mind is also another aspect.</p>

    <p>For example, the young man currently being tested has a square face, a buzz cut, and very distinctive thick eyebrows and beady eyes, which gives him a somewhat sleazy look.</p>

    <p>"Hello HR guys. My name is Zhuang Xian. Male. My profession is a regretter. My level is 15."</p>

    <p>The young man named Zhuang Xian said: "I came to Fuyun Town. Of course it's not because of my rank."</p>

    <p>He pointed to his mouth: "I can reach level 15. I rely solely on my sharp tongue... So you two HRs, please listen carefully. In the future, I will be more interested in the culinary aspect of the town."</p>

    <p>"Food planning?" Sun Rong's eyes lit up: "Are you in the food business?"</p>

    <p>"In reality, I am just a cook." Zhuang Xian nodded and said.</p>

    <p>"How about some crispy noodles?"</p>

    <p>"No. Where is the money in junk food?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Here's the thing. I am engaged in franchising a chain of hot pot restaurants. I think that in the future, we in Fuyun Town need a hot pot restaurant franchise center. In this way, we can attract players from the entire game world. Through us, we can build a unified franchise store."</p>

    <p>Zhuang Xian revealed his grand blueprint for a hot pot restaurant: "As long as we have enough resources to guarantee it, and invite powerful star players to endorse it, and promise to return the money regularly, I believe there will be many interested players."</p>

    <p>"What should I do if the management is not good?"</p>

    <p>"Franchise is a voluntary act. What can we do if the management is not good? Anyway, as a brand owner, we will definitely not lose money. At worst, we will just run away!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this. Sun Rong had already put a red seal of [rejection] on Zhuang Xian's name. Then she looked at the back of the crowd: "That... next person..."</p>
