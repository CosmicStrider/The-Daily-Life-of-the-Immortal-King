  <h1>Chapter 1688 Six Eternal Heroes</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Seeing Wang Ling's eyes, Master Wu finally revealed a few smiles on his ancient, unperturbed face: "You're quite knowledgeable, kid. This Chaos Rudder of mine can attack and defend, no matter how strong you are, you can't beat the power of my rudder. Stop before it's too late, you and your sister still have a chance of survival."</p>

    <p>Obviously, Wu Xin at this time did not yet know what kind of players he was facing.</p>

    <p>After all, most of the Eternals had their mission to surpass "Dao Ancestor Wang" back then. Now Master Wu Xin has successfully used means to revive himself and activated his divine brain to 100%. He can transfer consciousness at any time. It is equivalent to having the ability to live forever.</p>

    <p>Together with the various magic treasures that he has saved in his hands during the past 10,000 years and the rudder that he has now unveiled, which possesses 60% of the power of Chaos, in terms of paper strength, Master Wu Xin's strength has now reached the same level as that of Dao Ancestor Wang, not to say that it surpasses Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>As the Eternal One who aimed at Dao Ancestor Wang back then, if he could reach this level of combat power, he would naturally regard himself as an "invincible" existence.</p>

    <p>Therefore, he is extremely arrogant and does not take Wang Ling and Wang Nuan into his eyes at all.</p>

    <p>Although he could feel that the young man and the baby girl standing in front of him were not ordinary people. They possessed a variety of great abilities. They were more talented than the geniuses he had seen back then.</p>

    <p>However, because of the foundation accumulated during these eternity, he did not believe that the two stupid young men in front of him, whose combined total was less than half a hundred, could compete with the eternal foundation behind him.</p>

    <p>"I need to show you what the gap is." Facing Wang Ling. At this moment, Master Wu Xin thought. A strange golden dragon scale appeared on his hand.</p>

    <p>I saw him mumbling words. The dragon scales jumped in his palm. Then they quickly spread out on his body like fish scales, turning into armor. In an instant, his whole body burst into brilliant light. It was so bright that it was blinding.</p>

    <p>"Dragon Emperor's Holy Armor?" Monk Jin Deng's expression changed instantly when he saw this object. Although this armor did not come from Chaos, it has obviously been processed and baptized by Chaos.</p>

    <p>All magical weapons can theoretically undergo the baptism of chaos, thus gaining more power than before.</p>

    <p>However, this baptism process is risky. Once the baptism fails, the result will be in vain. Even the magic weapon may be damaged and will never be returned to you.</p>

    <p>But Monk Jin Deng could tell that the Dragon Emperor's Holy Armor in front of him had been baptized more than once!</p>

    <p>The Dragon Emperor's Holy Armor possesses nearly 40% of the power of chaos. It has been baptized at least 20 times...</p>

    <p>Therefore, Monk Jin Deng's face instantly turned cold. He was really surprised by Master Wu Xin's luck. He was even more surprised by the appearance of the Dragon Emperor's Holy Armor.</p>

    <p>This is the natal magic weapon of Taoist Dragon, who was known as the Dragon Demon back then! One of the Six Eternal Heroes!</p>

    <p>In the Eternal Era, the recognized combat power was lower than that of Dao Ancestor Wang, and their levels were tied in all aspects. The six great figures could not tell the winner from each other!</p>

    <p>They were dubbed the "Six Heroes of Eternity."</p>

    <p>It's just that this epic story about the Six Eternal Heroes has never been mentioned again since the Six Heroes hid themselves in the universe.</p>

    <p>There have always been rumors that in order to explore the true meaning of chaos, the Six Eternal Heroes met and walked into the vortex of chaos. Then they never came back...</p>

    <p>The auras and news of the six people have completely disappeared since then. They seem to have disappeared into the universe.</p>

    <p>In other words, the Holy Armor of the Dragon Emperor... this magical weapon that originally belonged to Taoist Dragon. It should have been a legendary object that disappeared in the universe. Now it has reappeared. And it was still taken out by Master Wu Xin.</p>

    <p>This makes Jin Deng, who is also the Eternal One, feel a little unbelievable.</p>

    <p>Why does Wu Xin have something belonging to the Eternal Six Heroes in his hands?</p>

    <p>Could it be that he saw the Six Heroes after they disappeared?</p>

    <p>Full of doubts, Master Wu Xin sneered again: "Monk, you seem to be surprised that I sacrificed this holy armor? That's right... after all, this Dragon Emperor's holy armor was originally one of the Six Heroes. The things of Taoist Dragon.</p>

    <p>But it's a pity. Such a good thing can only belong to me now. And I still have a lot of it." He smiled arrogantly. The Dragon Emperor's Holy Armor on his body shone brightly. It was like flint, exuding a kind of cosmic energy. The red flame has an otherworldly and astonishing power. It bursts out with a shocking light.</p>

    <p>Under such strong pressure, everyone in the Office of Strategic Deception is almost in a state of collapse. Just setting up a barrier for defense is already very difficult.</p>

    <p>This Dragon Emperor's holy armor is indeed extraordinary. It has a sense of oppression. Moreover, when it is worn on the body, it is also exuding a kind of chaotic flames.</p>

    <p>It is a purple-gold cosmic flame that can burn anything that comes close.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling used the power of King's Eyes to inspect it. The expression on his face did not change much. This dragon armor is indeed much stronger than ordinary toys. But Wu Xin wanted to use this dragon armor to resist his attack. It's a bit too immature.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wu Xin saw the right moment, and his face became filled with murderous intent. His palms fell down, and flew from the sky. With a power that shattered the sun, moon, and stars, he slapped the brother and sister.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt calm in his heart. But at this moment, his eyes inadvertently revealed a knife-like, cannibalistic look for the first time.</p>

    <p>He doesn't mind doing it to himself unintentionally, but not to Ah Nuan.</p>

    <p>Ah Nuan is just a newborn child. Facing such a baby, the other party is so unscrupulous and shows no mercy. This has touched the bottom line of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Even if Wang Ling has no emotions and doesn't know what anger is, this sudden discomfort has given him enough reason to take action against Wu Xin.</p>

    <p>According to the latest family training from the Old Wang family.</p>

    <p>A brother should protect his sister unconditionally.</p>

    <p>You should try your best to avoid anything that might hurt your sister.</p>

    <p>If you are attacked by gangsters or other lawless elements, you can use all your strength to resist if necessary...regardless of the cost or consequences!</p>

    <p>"How dare this person offend Ling Zhenren like that! He is really seeking death!"</p>

    <p>In the distance, Qin Zhong said with anger in his voice when he saw Wu Xin attacking the Wang Ling brother and sister. In fact, his admiration for Wang Ling was not lower than Zhuo Yi at all. After all, he was a regular worshiper. On the table. A man whom he respected as a god.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>Unintentionally, the palm of his hand fell from the sky and turned into a huge shadow. It stretched for thousands of miles. It was impossible to see the trajectory clearly.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling raised his hand and struck Wu Xin with a counterattack.</p>

    <p>At this moment, powerful palm power overflowed from the surface of this supreme world. The explosive destructive power formed a magic ring. It spread out in all directions with Wang Ling as the center point!</p>

    <p>A buzz!</p>

    <p>The entire ground of the Supreme World sank dozens of feet under the force of Wang Ling's palm!</p>

    <p>"Bang!"</p>

    <p>Finally, Master Wu Xin took action against the Wang Ling brother and sister with a look of confusion on his face. Facing the counterattack, his whole body was flying all over the sky like a kite that had taken off its strings. It took a long time to regain my balance.</p>

    <p>A large mouthful of blood vomited out.</p>

    <p>Master Wu Xin had a look of disbelief on his face.</p>

    <p>His Dragon Emperor's Holy Armor was smashed to pieces by Wang Ling's palm!</p>

    <p>But just now, if it weren't for the Dragon Emperor's holy armor, the power of that palm might have crushed him into powder!</p>
