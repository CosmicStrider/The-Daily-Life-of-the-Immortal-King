  <h1>Chapter 1916 Congratulations Wang Ling. You are not the mascot this time!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>That night Wang Ling actually had an ominous premonition. When he got home, the "eyelid warning" that had not been activated for a long time started again. And it was still with the same frequency... which proved that there would be something coming next. A lot of trouble happened.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling subconsciously thought that this was the "butterfly effect" caused by his failure to execute the score-pressing behavior accurately this time.</p>

    <p>So when he got home, he put down his schoolbag and started staring at Wang Ying. As for Wang Ying, he was still leaning against the wall with his arms folded as if nothing happened.</p>

    <p>He was completely numbed by Wang Ling's glare, and finally he could only spread his hands and said, "Master Ling... I think that even if I am to blame for this matter, you can't blame me entirely. I was just making an immature suggestion, who knew you would adopt it?"</p>

    <p>Hearing these words, Wang Ling was speechless for a moment.</p>

    <p>But with his character, it is very easy to be "deceived!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed in his heart. He thought about it carefully and felt that Wang Ying could not be blamed for this. If he was to blame, he could only be blamed for being too simple and too well-behaved.</p>

    <p>Of course, Wang Ling did not dare to tell Father Wang and Mother Wang about this when he came back. He was afraid that his pocket money would be deducted by Father Wang for some reason.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling knows. This paper cannot cover the fire. Father Wang and Mother Wang will also know about this sooner or later.</p>

    <p>However, what Wang Ling didn't expect was that Father Wang and Mother Wang learned about it much faster than he imagined...</p>

    <p>The couple saw Wang Ling come in from the door with a depressed look. They took off their shoes without saying a word and went straight to the room. They felt that something was wrong in the atmosphere from the low pressure.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling is usually the kind of person with an expressionless face. But after living for more than ten years, he knows what kind of temper his son is. And he can judge and analyze the specific situation through micro-expressions. Father Wang and Mother Wang are too familiar with it. It is not an exaggeration to call them experts.</p>

    <p>Normal parents would  definitely think that their children would feel sad and blame themselves because of the unsatisfactory results in this monthly exam.</p>

    <p>But Father Wang and Mother Wang are different.</p>

    <p>"Did you do too well in the exam this time?" Mother Wang asked.</p>

    <p>"Probably." Father Wang put down the newspaper, sighed, and showed a sad expression on his face: "Hey, I've told him several times. He should lower his scores, don't do so well in the exam. Being too good will easily attract attention! How many times has he participated in competitions before? Every time, Xiao Zhuozi and Wang Ming helped to clean up his mess behind him."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Mother Wang shook her head and said, "I think it's fair to say that in the previous competitions, it wasn't Ling Ling who wanted to go. There were various factors, plus the strong request of Teacher Pan, so he had to listen."</p>

    <p>"Besides, except for the time when Ling Ling entered school, he was always given a low score. Shouldn't he be sent there? I doubt..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang was startled and suddenly realized: "You mean, Ling Ling has been exposed?"</p>

    <p>"Exposure shouldn't be enough."</p>

    <p>Mother Wang shook her head: "I guess the teacher at Number 60 High School is deliberately testing him. And as far as I know, because Ling Ling's score has been lowered every time before, it has made the teacher suspicious. So I think he occasionally gets a little better in the exam. It's better. It's also a way to dispel the teacher's concerns."</p>

    <p>Don't say it. After listening to this analysis, Father Wang felt that what Mother Wang said was actually very reasonable.</p>

    <p>But here are the rules of the Old Wang family. They have been set long ago. They cannot be changed easily.</p>

    <p>If you do well in the exam, your pocket money will be deducted.</p>

    <p>If you are first in grade or something, you will be fined a whole year's pocket money.</p>

    <p>Mother Wang still felt very sorry for Wang Ling. While doing what she was doing, she couldn't help but said: "The child is very pitiful. Don't be too fierce this time."</p>

    <p>"Yes. But the punishment must be executed. I've figured it out. I'll let it go this time." Father Wang sighed. He never knew that Wang Ling was not easy. So this time he decided to punish him less.</p>

    <p>Punishment is one dollar. Just a symbolic expression.</p>

    <p>Therefore, even though Wang Ling said nothing. Father Wang and Mother Wang relied on their understanding of Wang Ling to guess the matter.</p>

    <p>Parents are always the tapeworms of their children. Wang Ling thinks this is not true at all. Sometimes he even wonders whether Father Wang and Mother Wang are also "in his mind."</p>

    <p>How can you know so many things about yourself so easily?</p>

    <p>Of course. For Wang Ling, his "nightmare" today is far more than that.</p>

    <p>Because that very night, Teacher Pan called directly.</p>

    <p>A phone call came to the Wang family's small villa.</p>

    <p>When he answered, she praises Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan: "It's amazing! It's amazing! Mr. Wang! Although your son's grades in each subject have only improved a little this time, his ranking in the grade has risen. He is directly first!"</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "Teacher. Why does this lead to an increase in the rankings..."</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan: "We at Number 60 High School have always advocated diversity. We set up various lists to give every child the opportunity to be on the list. To see yourself correctly from multiple dimensions and angles. Only in this way can you know your own strengths and weaknesses. Well, to be honest, I always thought that Wang Ling, this child, did not do well in the exam on purpose."</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "Then this time..."</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan on the other side of the phone was smiling from ear to ear: "But this time, facing such a difficult paper, Wang Ling not only stabilized his usual level, but also improved his scores in various subjects online by several points. This usual stable performance coupled with super-level performance has suddenly made classmate Wang Ling's overall ranking jump up in one fell swoop!"</p>

    <p>Father Wang continued the call and was already wiping his sweat: "Teacher Pan, you should not only call me to tell me... that Ling Ling did well in the exam this time..."</p>

    <p>"It's like this, Mr. Wang. Your child is so outstanding. He has also won rankings in the previous competitions our school has participated in. So this time, I would like to recommend the list of entries for the freshman list of provincial and municipal high school cultivation colleges. Wang Ling passed."</p>

    <p>Father Wang took a deep breath.</p>

    <p>It was just as he expected. What was supposed to come came after all...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the ancient alley deep in Zhuquemen, Songhai City, there is a teahouse that has been open for a long time. A young man wearing a black windbreaker is walking through it.</p>

    <p>The Suzaku Gate was built in the year 2000 of Xiuzhenli. It has a history of more than 2,000 years. During the imperial period, it was the main passage for the emperor to transport royal supplies every day. Now it has been transformed into a pine tree after reconstruction. The tourist attractions in Haishi still retain the style of the past except for a few more shops.</p>

    <p>Those city walls, arrow towers, and moats... seem to transport people back two thousand years ago.</p>

    <p>There are also many students gathering here. Because the coordinates of Zhuque Gate are right at the center of several key cultivation high schools in Songhai City, this has become a place where students often gather.</p>

    <p>It was around six o'clock in the evening. A man wearing a black trench coat was walking on the road of the ancient alley. He looked a little out of place among the students wearing uniforms of various schools.</p>

    <p>He walked to the door of the teahouse where he had made an appointment in advance. He stretched out his hand and knocked on the wooden door.</p>

    <p>This is an old teahouse. The word "Jiutian" is written on the plaque in front of the door.</p>

    <p>"Who?"</p>

    <p>The lights of the closed teahouse suddenly turned on. Then a rough voice came from inside.</p>

    <p>"I'm Jing Heqiu. I'm here to discuss the matter of the freshman list of provincial and municipal high school cultivation colleges." The man took off his hat in front of the door and reported his family background respectfully.</p>
