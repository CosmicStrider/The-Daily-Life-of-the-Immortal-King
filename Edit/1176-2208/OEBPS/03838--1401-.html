  <h1>Chapter 1401 Investigating information about love rivals</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The third Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube is sealed under the Jiandu Palace. Jiu You has sent heavy troops to guard it here.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong I met Jiu You for the first time. I think he is a very capable person. He is mature and very experienced in his work.</p>

    <p>Jiu You has long dark gray hair. It hangs casually on his shoulders and hangs down to his waist. He wears a black slim-fitting outfit. The red thunder pattern waistband perfectly sets off his thin waist and long legs.</p>

    <p>He always had his eyes narrowed. Just like his name, people can't help but feel a sense of mystery.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong heard from the Bai Qiao that Jiu You was not yet considered one of his own people, so on Jiu You's side, the uniform line about the new Rubik's Cube was, "This new Rubik's Cube was created by the Bai Sheath , and Sun Rong is the apprentice of the Bai Qiao."</p>

    <p>On the way. Sun Rong talked to Jiu You very carefully to avoid letting anything slip.</p>

    <p>"Master Jiu You!"</p>

    <p>"Meet Mr. Bai Qiao"</p>

    <p>When passing by the underground palace, the guards at the door fell to their knees on the spot when they saw Jiu You and Bai Qiao behind Jiu You.</p>

    <p>Those responsible for guarding the third Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube are all sword spirits carefully selected by Jiu You.</p>

    <p>The sword rankings are all within 50.</p>

    <p>The leader is a girl named Xiao Qian.</p>

    <p>This is a toothpick sword. It's only as big as a toothpick. But it hides huge psychic power!</p>

    <p>Currently ranked sixth.</p>

    <p>"Master Bai Qiao. This is the old Rubik's Cube."</p>

    <p>At this time, Jiu You's eyes were pointed at the end of the underground palace corridor. The luminous object was imprisoned by several thigh-like light chains.</p>

    <p>This Heavenly Dao light chain was also left behind when Dao Ancestor Wang arranged the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube. It is used to fix the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong took out the third new Rubik's Cube that Wang Ling pinched out.</p>

    <p>The new Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube floated over on its own initiative after feeling the breath of the old Rubik's Cube in front of it. Then everyone heard a "pop" sound. It felt like two runners in a long-distance running competition completing a relay.</p>

    <p>The old Rubik's Cube was directly replaced by the new Rubik's Cube. Finally it fell into the hands of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"Successful!" The replacement of the third Rubik's Cube was smoother than Sun Rong imagined. Because there was no riot in the Rubik's Cube itself. There was no need to be involved in the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube secret room like last time on the Heavenly Dao planet. Li.</p>

    <p>At this point, the new Rubik's Cube has successfully taken over.</p>

    <p>But Jiu You also noticed the changes ahead.</p>

    <p>He was a little confused: "Sir Bai Qiao. The Heavenly Dao light chain of Dao Ancestor Wang seems to have disappeared. Is it really okay?"</p>

    <p>"Heh, my new Rubik's Cube is very smart. Automatically completes the replacement and is very obedient. I don't know how many times more reliable than the old Rubik's Cube." Bai Qiao hummed and laughed: "Alright, since the replacement has been completed, then Miss Sun and I will withdraw. You pay more attention to the matter of the Sword Dao Conference."</p>

    <p>"Yes" Jiu You bowed to Bai Qiao.</p>

    <p>About 3 minutes ago. He received a message about holding a Sword conference.</p>

    <p>And this conference must be held within 2 days.</p>

    <p>This undoubtedly poses a huge problem for Jiu You.</p>

    <p>To hold an unprecedented grand conference. In addition to "Jian Shen Alloy", finding players, judges, and sponsors are all important steps.</p>

    <p>Jiu You doesn't know if it's too late, but she can only try her best and try to complete it.</p>

    <p>"Is it all because of Miss Sun?" At this time, Jiu You looked at Sun Rong, feeling a little sour in his heart.</p>

    <p>A human girl in the Foundation Building stage can actually become Master Bai Qiao as her master. What a blessing!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong returned home. He looked at the time.</p>

    <p>Since the replacement and recycling process went smoothly, it only took less than three hours to get back this time.</p>

    <p>There is still 1 hour until midnight the next day.</p>

    <p>For Sun Rong, there are only two top priorities right now.</p>

    <p>The first thing is to meet the girl named Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>The second thing is the Sword Conference in the Sword King Realm.</p>

    <p>Today, Aohai has successfully reached three cores. However, its ranking on the sword list remains unchanged.</p>

    <p>The top few spirit swords are really frighteningly powerful.</p>

    <p>But I have three-core Aohai in hand.</p>

    <p>As long as there is no too strong opponent. Sun Rong feels that he still has a chance to win the piece of Jian Shen alloy! However, these are things for another day.</p>

    <p>We will have to wait until the Sword Conference in two days to find out.</p>

    <p>So now, the only important thing before the girl is</p>

    <p>"What are you going to do?" Er Ha asked.</p>

    <p>It came back with Sun Rong. And it did not choose to go directly to the Wang family's villa. Because the drama in front of it was so exciting, Er Ha was reluctant to leave. He only wanted to stay and watch the subsequent development of the incident.</p>

    <p>"You still have to understand the other person's nature first." The girl stared at the love letter in her hand and fell into thought.</p>

    <p>Although the real name, address and mobile phone number are left on it, it is definitely not a wise choice to act rashly.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong turned on the computer. Logged into the backend of the group platform. Tried to enable the "Wukong System."</p>

    <p>Seeing Sun Rong look serious. Sun Ying'er was also very enthusiastic: "What is Rongrong going to do?"</p>

    <p>"Let me see if this girl has left any purchase records with her mobile phone number." Sun Rong replied.</p>

    <p>"Why do I feel like you're looking for evidence of cheating?"</p>

    <p>As a qualified expert in stepping on thunder, Sun Ying'er almost made Sun Rong choke on his saliva when he heard what he said.</p>

    <p>"Ying'er. You're talking nonsense again." Sun Rong's face felt a little hot. But he still pretended to be calm and stared at the computer to search for relevant information.</p>

    <p>As a result of this search, I found some clues!</p>

    <p>"It really does." Sun Rong looked at the customer consumption records recorded on the platform in surprise: "cake, donuts, milk tea, brown sugar"</p>

    <p>Er Ha was surprised when he heard this: "Isn't your family selling elixirs?"</p>

    <p>"Grandpa has a lot of side businesses. They are all trivial small businesses." Sun Rong replied calmly: "Basically, Grandpa is involved in every industry you can think of. Our family also has investments in dog food. of."</p>

    <p>"Er Ha."</p>

    <p>"This girl likes sweets very much. Generally, girls who like sweets shouldn't be too difficult to deal with." Sun Rong touched his chin and analyzed.</p>

    <p>She combined it with the address provided in the love letter. Then she discovered that the delivery address for Jiang Yingying's purchases was not the same as the one written in the love letter.</p>

    <p>"Number 232, Northwest Road." Sun Rong said: "This is the delivery address found on the computer. And her latest purchase record was the day before yesterday. It is not the same address as the one left in the love letter."</p>

    <p>"Northwest Road?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha chewed the address carefully. It felt a bit familiar.</p>

    <p>Soon, it stood up and put its head close to the dog's head: "So this is it!"</p>

    <p>"Do you know this place?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"This is the cadre apartment where Wei Zhi lives!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha said: "Besides, Marshal Jiang also lives there, so could this girl be Marshal Jiang's granddaughter or something?"</p>

    <p>"The granddaughter of the Tenth General?" Sun Rong smiled slightly.</p>

    <p>If that's really the case.</p>

    <p>That's really an interesting opponent.</p>
