  <h1>Chapter 1674 A man worth 100 million</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When the indescribable creatures Number 001-010 stood in the void, the most powerful aura was randomly superimposed and released, sweeping across the entire place. Their containment device was so destructive in the air. The eternal light seemed to come from all eternity. The period continues to the present. There is a sense of eternity.</p>

    <p>Everyone in the imperial city was shocked by this scene. The powerful people fought in two groups, trying to escape from the core area. However, at this moment, their legs and feet became stiff. Each of them was shocked by these cubic creatures.</p>

    <p>The fear originating from the spirit makes every aboriginal person in the Imperial City feel cowed, trembling, and at a loss.</p>

    <p>"What...what the hell is going on?"</p>

    <p>"Excellent. Why did it happen suddenly? Is this a natural disaster? What are these cubes?"</p>

    <p>Everyone was stunned. Even the most powerful man in the imperial city didn't know what was going on with White Hair.</p>

    <p>In the void, the ten containment cubes burst out with bright light. After the continuous light, as the cubes gradually opened, a desolate atmosphere immediately hit their faces.</p>

    <p>For a time, the aboriginal people in the Imperial City saw the same hallucination. They saw a large amount of blood spurting out from these cubes like a waterfall, impacting everything in front of them with an aura of extreme killing.</p>

    <p>Rubbing his eyes, the illusion of a sea of blood and killing disappeared in an instant. What followed was a series of blasting sounds like the roar of the Dao!</p>

    <p>Ten humanoid monsters of different shapes emerged from their own cubes with their teeth and claws spread out!</p>

    <p>However, what is completely different from the previous 1212 and 096 is that these indescribable creatures seemed to be controlled. They stood in place obediently and did not make any major movements.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt calm. He glanced through King's Eyes and saw the spiritual threads connected to the heads of these ten sheltered creatures.</p>

    <p>It was exactly what he thought. Someone was controlling these ten sheltered creatures.</p>

    <p>Can control ten indescribable creatures at the same time. Wang Ling thinks this person is quite fierce.</p>

    <p>But it's okay.</p>

    <p>The situation at hand is controllable.</p>

    <p>"A creature of the Old Days." At that moment. Wang Ling gazed at the spirits. His calm vision seemed to be able to see through eternity. Not long ago, he had fought against Fenmu Shen, who claimed to have inherited the bloodline of the Old Dominator. I didn't expect to run into him again.</p>

    <p>He still has the strange pupil in his hand. Although there is currently no connection with King's Eyes. However, Wang Ling firmly believes that the pupil may be able to suppress him perfectly. There may be other ways of power.</p>

    <p>Obviously, now is not the time for experiments. There are too many innocent people in this imperial city. After all, these ten sheltered creatures must be transferred to other places for solution.</p>

    <p>So. The moment Wang Ling opened the King's Eyes, the three-petal Golden Lotus in the pupil flowed and bloomed suddenly.</p>

    <p>A golden vortex appeared in the sky. It gradually expanded from the size of a coin to the size of a lake. Then it swept along the surrounding area and spread all the way. Countless golden vines were derived.</p>

    <p>"What I saw was...a city?" Below, everyone in the imperial city was dazzled. The explanation was horrified by this shocking scene that was like a miracle.</p>

    <p>Just above their heads, a vast group of buildings appeared. The towering ancient buildings were full of brilliance. They exuded endless divinity and filled the sky.</p>

    <p>This is a Heavenly City! As high as the sky. It is also another ability that Wang Ling has never shown before!</p>

    <p>--King's Eyes!</p>

    <p>The "world of the heavens" built by the huge power of King's Eyes itself. The supreme world above the "supreme world", "core world", "inherent spiritual realm" and all large and small worlds built up by the power of chaos. space...</p>

    <p>Falling into someone else's space means that the master of the space can control you.</p>

    <p>The ruler is a god-like existence.</p>

    <p>But in fact, there is also a limitation.</p>

    <p>That is, if the opponent's space ability is greater than that of the space master, you can reverse the operation and annex directly in the space! Not only can you achieve polar reversal, you can even absorb the opponent's space for your own use!</p>

    <p>This means. As long as Wang Ling wants.</p>

    <p>When he was in Fenmu Shen's supreme world, he could completely eat Fenmu Shen's supreme world.</p>

    <p>But that world was stained with too much blood.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was worried that eating the supreme world would hurt his eyes, so he did not take action after all.</p>

    <p>"This is... the city of the heavens?" Xiang Yi used his 3.2 billion light-year sighting scope to see everything clearly. He couldn't help but murmur.</p>

    <p>This is really outrageous. A golden Heavenly City with no end in sight appeared in front of everyone. All the buildings inside were illuminated by Dharma light. Every brick and stone was engraved with powerful law engravings.</p>

    <p>More than just one avenue!</p>

    <p>The power of various avenues intersects on it and then spreads out!</p>

    <p>That indescribable sense of grandeur and magnificence strikes the hearts of everyone here. It makes people feel terrified.</p>

    <p>In the Imperial City, everyone who saw this scene was stunned.</p>

    <p>Including Nawei, who was leading the team to hunt down suspicious elements throughout the city. At this moment, they all stood still.</p>

    <p>It's obvious that he has merged with the divine brain. He has activated the divine brain to 70%, but he still can't stop trembling...</p>

    <p>This huge city of the heavens. There's a sense of oppression that's unimaginable. It's just there in one piece. It almost makes you feel the urge to fall down and worship it.</p>

    <p>Even monk Jin Deng was completely shocked.</p>

    <p>At a glance, he knew that such a method must have come from Wang Ling's arm. He immediately sighed in despair: "Heavenly City...Ling Zhenren. Be the only true god in the world!"</p>

    <p>Even Jin Deng made such a sigh. Among the rest, Sun Rong, Jiugong Liangzi's beautiful face was naturally vivid on the page.</p>

    <p>In addition, Zhou Ziyi and Qin Zhong were naturally affected.</p>

    <p>Just when Zhuo Yi had a showdown with Jiugong Liangzi, Zhou Ziyi also found out. It turned out that Wang Ling was Zhuo Yi's master.</p>

    <p>He thought it was a joke.</p>

    <p>It even feels a little unreal.</p>

    <p>A dignified savior hero. Zhuo Yi, the cultivator who blocked Tuntian Ha back then. How could he be a junior student of a Foundation Building student...</p>

    <p>And now, with the appearance of Heavenly City, Zhou Ziyi discovered that he was too young!</p>

    <p>Then he figured everything out.</p>

    <p>No wonder Zhuo Yi desperately hoped that he would be successful in this operation. He began to think that this was Zhuo Yi's test for him. In fact, this was simply my application form to become a disciple.</p>

    <p>If he could become the disciple of Zhuo Yi and the disciple of Wang Ling... he would truly be able to take off from where he was!</p>

    <p>Even if I lose two legs in the past ten years, it will be fine.</p>

    <p>In the next few years, he may grow faster than others even if he goes backwards!</p>

    <p>Of course. The person who was most shocked by this scene.</p>

    <p>At this moment, it belongs to Qin Zhong...</p>

    <p>He heard Gu Shunzhi say so many things about Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But he never expected that he would actually fall into the world line of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong wouldn't have expected it even if he was killed.</p>

    <p>This man who was always on his altar for him to worship.</p>

    <p>Now it was appearing in flesh and blood before his eyes!</p>

    <p>With those familiar dead fish eyes and slight breathing sound...it's alive!</p>
