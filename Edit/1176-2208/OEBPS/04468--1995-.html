  <h1>Chapter 1995 Zhuo Yi's choice</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The duel between principals is a big deal. It involves the reputation of the two schools. What's more, Jin Deng's staff files were obtained with the help of Zhuo Yi. Many of the resumes are the monk's real experiences of reincarnation in thousands of lives.</p>

    <p>It looks very rich, but there is almost zero content about modern scientific cultivation education. And there are no employment records found on the Internet. Except for the teaching qualification certificate of a mathematics teacher. It is not an exaggeration to describe it as an airborne soldier.</p>

    <p>Dai Tianchun is famous for his crazy energy. The ten generals of the Huaxiu Alliance know it all too well.</p>

    <p>On one side is a generation of god-killing generals who have made military exploits but have been immersed in them for a while. They think they have become mature.</p>

    <p>On the other side is a poor vice-principal who lacks experience in modern scientific cultivation teaching. He has taken the position of vice-principal of Number 60 High School based on his own level of ability and has yet to secure a solid foundation.</p>

    <p>As a superior department, the first reaction is of course to mediate the conflict between the two.</p>

    <p>Jinghua City Ten Thousand Schools Alliance Headquarters.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi knocked on the office door.</p>

    <p>"Come on, Xiao Zhuozi. Come in. I can smell your spiritual power from afar."</p>

    <p>In front of the desk, Sun Dakang has been waiting for a long time. He crossed his fingers and held his chin, waiting for Zhuo Yi to report the mediation results.</p>

    <p>The preliminary mediation is the responsibility of Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>This is an order from a superior. He must not disobey it.</p>

    <p>But in fact, Zhuo Yi in his heart wished that Dai Tianchun would call him quickly...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi bowed respectfully and replied: "I'm sorry. Leader, it's Xiaozhuo who is incompetent. When I was in Songhai City, I had already communicated with Principal Dai in advance through the Telecommunication Union. Principal Dai was very impatient. He hung up on me and said I was not qualified to talk to him."</p>

    <p>"Ha. After so many years, his character has not changed at all." This was an expected result. Sun Dakang was already used to this.</p>

    <p>"When I came to Beijing this time, I also visited Shengke. Shengke has been under martial law and no one is allowed to enter. Even if I show my identity as the director of the Songhai City Hundred Schools General Administration."</p>

    <p>Sun Dakang raised his eyebrows and said, "Have you contacted the local General Administration of Hundreds of Schools? I remember that you have always had a good relationship with Jinghua's Zhiliang."</p>

    <p>"Of course I also contacted Director Xu Zhiliang to accompany me. As a result, we were both turned away."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi dumbfounded: "I think Principal Dai should have already been making preparations for the war..."</p>

    <p>"That's what he would do."</p>

    <p>Sun Dakang sighed: "I already knew this would be the result. I can't blame you for this. Xiao Zhuo. I originally felt that the initial pressure plan given by Huaxiu Alliance was not enough. Although you have become famous in recent years. But it's still hard to persuade someone like Dai Tianchun, who's a veteran..."</p>

    <p>"Xiao Zhuo doesn't understand. Then why send me?"</p>

    <p>"This is Huaxiu Alliance trying my attitude." Sun Dakang said meaningfully.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi is not a fool. The sensitivity in these words was understood almost immediately.</p>

    <p>What kind of person is Dai Tianchun... He was a top master who came from the founding period of the Huaxiu Nation. Speaking of which, he is also a senior and powerful person with extremely senior qualifications.</p>

    <p>Logically speaking, he is certainly not qualified to intervene in this big boss's affairs.</p>

    <p>But the Huaxiu Alliance insisted on sending him there. As Sun Dakang said, this was the rest of the Huaxiu Alliance testing what attitude he, the leader of the Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools, had towards him Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Now, Sun Dakang's attitude can be said to have been made clear.</p>

    <p>And an important signal was released to Zhuo Yi on the spot. That is that he Zhuo Yi is likely to be the successor of the new leader of the Ten Thousand Schools Alliance in the future.</p>

    <p>As the leader of the New Ten Thousand Schools Alliance, you will have to come into contact with those powerful men of the older generation sooner or later. Therefore, I sent Zhuo Yi to meet them. It is considered as a kind of advance training.</p>

    <p>"Junior...how can you be so virtuous..."</p>

    <p>After understanding all this, Zhuo Yi lowered his head in flattery. His hands were clasped together while writing. It was faintly visible that his hands were trembling.</p>

    <p>It's a mix of emotions. Excitement dominates. Then disbelief, joy, confusion...</p>

    <p>"Xiao Zhuo, your superior performance over the years is obvious to all of us.</p>

    <p>You are a smart person. If there are too many words, I won't say anything. I will definitely support you fully." Sun Dakang said. He stood up and patted Zhuo Yi on the shoulder: "But you know, it is a big deal to elect the leader of the Ten Thousand Schools Alliance. Although the assessment has started several years ago, the final list. Every name on it must be voted on in the Huaxiu Alliance."</p>

    <p>"In each round of voting, only those with more than two-thirds of the votes are allowed to enter the next round. Until the last person's name is decided..."</p>

    <p>"I know."Zhuo Yi nodded.</p>

    <p>This is the ironclad order within the Huaxiu Alliance. And those who compete with him are equally excellent. Although Zhuo Yi's performance in recent years has indeed been good, it has not been recognized by all the ten generals.</p>

    <p>The remaining ten will choose the person they like, but will not necessarily give their votes to him.</p>

    <p>So when you vote on that day, it will be a real life and death decision. It is not an exaggeration to call it hell.</p>

    <p>"Xiao Zhuo, you know my attitude towards you. But in life, no one can be perfect and satisfy everyone." At this time, Sun Dakang looked at Zhuo Yi. His words flickered. He stopped talking.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi noticed it quickly. He immediately bowed again: "It's okay to say it, leader. If you have anything to say, you might as well say it directly."</p>

    <p>"In the final voting session, in fact, more or less in order to canvass votes, they will expose each other's dirty information. Then Xiaozhuo, let me ask you, do you know where your problem is..."</p>

    <p>"Could it be related to my family background? My family background is pretty good..."</p>

    <p>A drop of cold sweat instantly ran down Zhuo Yi's cheek: "But if the superiors are worried, they can check me. Our Zhuo family. Every penny that my parents earn is from business transactions. They have never done anything illegal. Things that violate discipline. Every penny spent is clean and innocent. There are no records of old people. Our Zhuo family is also a pioneer enterprise in disaster relief every year. We take the lead in donating money."</p>

    <p>"Don't get excited, Xiao Zhuo. I didn't talk about your family's problems. Although the Zhuo family's company is not as big as the Huaguo Shuilian Group, it is also a pioneer in the electric energy Spirit Bus industry. We have also been philanthropic over the years. You can see it all. I was asking about something else..."</p>

    <p>"Something else?" Zhuo Yi was stunned. He quickly thought of the magical Uncle Black... Although since becoming familiar with his master Wang Ling, the relationship with this magical Uncle Black Contact has also become less frequent.</p>

    <p>But during the holidays, he still didn't forget to buy gifts for Uncle Hei and send them to him.</p>

    <p>Come to think of it, the identity of this black uncle is also very mysterious. Could it be that he is really a lawbreaker...</p>

    <p>"Hey, Xiao Zhuo, don't make blind guesses. I'll just tell you the truth. In fact, your problem is only one... and that's also the place where you are most likely to be attacked at the moment."</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Dakang looked at him and said seriously: "Let me ask you, are you in love with Jiugong Liangzi, the eldest daughter of the Jiugong family?"</p>
