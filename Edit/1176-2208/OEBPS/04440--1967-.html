  <h1>Chapter 1967 The background of Wuxiang Peak</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After this battle, the strongest Wuxiang Peak in the Number 2 Proving Ground suffered heavy casualties. Qu Shuling disappeared. The remaining elite students from foreign schools who followed Qu Shuling were leaderless. They included Huaxiu's own country and elites from abroad. College students.</p>

    <p>One thing they have in common is that they all decided to join the Wuxiang Peak team after hearing the news that Qu Shuling had joined the Wuxiang Peak.</p>

    <p>"Sect Master, if we don't use the sect's heritage, I'm afraid we won't be able to participate in the subsequent sect competition under such an offensive." In this dilemma, a young man wearing a white shirt and a black suit jacket hung on his shoulders. At this time, he took the initiative to stand up.</p>

    <p>The senior senior fellow from the Haoren Sect had previously explained during the meal that a senior fellow named Qi in the Haoren Sect had defected. It was this person who was unmistakable.</p>

    <p>This person's name is Qi Yuheng.</p>

    <p>Of course. He is also an actor in the Number 2 Proving Ground.</p>

    <p>In ordinary storylines, the fate of traitors is often tragic.</p>

    <p>However, being able to obtain such a defection script proves that Qi Yuheng's own strength is also extremely powerful. In such a leaderless situation, Qi Yuheng can only stand up and take charge of the overall situation in place of the hurried juniors in the sect.</p>

    <p>This is also the ingenuity and design of Teng Luchen. Although the probability of something happening to the strongest Wuxiang Peak before the sect competition is very slim. However, considering that the possibility cannot be ruled out, the character Qi Yuheng was born in this way.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, Qi Yuheng, who had switched jobs from Good Man Peak, was already a great elder of Wuxiang Peak.</p>

    <p>Qi Yuheng's opening was both a reminder on the surface and a hint behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>The leader of Wuxiang Peak is also a member of the Jiutian Jingmi Academy system. His immediate boss is Jing Heqiu. But even so, he doesn't know why he has set up a separate strategic foundation for Wuxiang Peak. It can help Wuxiang Peak reverse its disadvantage.</p>

    <p>All we can say is that maybe Jing Heqiu or the senior Teng above him is testing something deeper...and this is not something that a subordinate of his who is just following orders can handle alone.</p>

    <p>"Just do as you say."</p>

    <p>The leader of Wuxiang Peak sighed. Then he stared at Qi Yuheng and said, "Pass this order from our sect. Activate all the human figurines in the inventory at the back mountain!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Human figurines. It can also be called earth puppets. As the name suggests, it is a combat puppet created by cultivators using natural psychic clay and earth magic.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, in the context of the era of scientific cultivation, this type of human figurines have been further strengthened. Nowadays, a powerful human figurine not only has combat capabilities, but also has gained intelligence beyond the past in the AI intelligent system endowed by science. It can no longer be used It is controlled by the magic of me, the creator. Instead, it is fully controlled by information technology means.</p>

    <p>With the combination of modern technology, human figurines can be put into use on a large scale. They can even be used to command and replace cultivators to carry out labor and production.</p>

    <p>The humanoid magic weapon previously developed by Wang Ming is actually a part of the human figurines. However, Wang Ming replaced the psychic clay with nano-spirit iron, making the humanoid figurines more indestructible. But the disadvantage is that it is expensive. It cannot be compared with the psychic clay. Same as mass production.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is also familiar with this concept.</p>

    <p>After all, he has already seen the ultimate version of the human figurines - the ancient divine weapons.</p>

    <p>In the circle of human figurines, there should be no existence with more powerful destructive power than the ancient magic weapon created by Fenmu Shen... Although to Wang Ling, the ancient magic weapon is also fragile and cannot stand at all. Take his troubles.</p>

    <p>As for the ordinary human figurines, Wang Ling did not take them seriously. However, at this time, Wuxiang Peak was preparing to sacrifice human figurines to challenge. It could also be regarded as a means to redeem the disadvantage.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling maintained an indifferent attitude towards this. After all, he had completed his plan. He had collected all available resources on the mountain behind Wuxiang Peak.</p>

    <p>The spirit sword materials used to repair Zhan Ye have been delivered by express delivery. The materials used to repair the Wuxiang Sect's spirit gathering array are now ready. Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan also took the opportunity to plunder a lot.</p>

    <p>After all, according to the rules of this trial, everything obtained in this trial can be taken out. This undoubtedly made both of them very happy.</p>

    <p>"Now I know why I bring you Wang Ling in every Number 60 High School competition. It is indeed good luck to follow you. I have stayed in the early stage of Golden Core for a long time. I have been collecting the materials of Gujin Pill to seek a breakthrough. "I didn't expect that this time I would have all the materials collected!" Li Changzhe said in surprise.</p>

    <p>"Me too!" Zhang Linyan also nodded, like a chicken pecking at rice: "I'm wondering if we should take advantage of Wang Ling's presence. We might as well refine the Solid Gold Pill directly in the trial ground. Maybe the success rate is unknown. It can go straight up!"</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe: "What a great idea, Sister Zhang! But we don't have an elixir furnace now... The broken furnace at Haoren Peak will only increase the probability of refining a useless elixir."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Then, when the two of them were silent in their infinite fantasy, Tie Yi's words interrupted their thoughts again: "You guys, please don't discuss alchemy for now. One of our brothers just came back from an investigation. He said it was someone from Houshan. There was a big earthquake in one direction."</p>

    <p>"A big earthquake? But the mountains behind have been searched by us, right?" Li Changzhehu asked.</p>

    <p>"It's the place we've been to before! It's the forest with the Deep Dream Fruit. There seemed to be something down there. The ground suddenly cracked. Fortunately, we sent someone to watch Qu Shuling. Otherwise, I'm afraid it would be like this. The kid will be sucked directly into the earth in his sleep..." Tie Yi said anxiously.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling heard this. He was thoughtful.</p>

    <p>He already knew what was buried in that land.</p>

    <p>And then, three more choices appeared in front of him.</p>

    <p>[Choice 1: Don't avoid it. Return to the camp to meet up with everyone. Mission reward: One primary solid gold pill.]</p>

    <p>[Option 2: Stay where you are and search for treasures of heaven and earth. Mission reward: Intermediate solid gold pills.]</p>

    <p>[Option 3: Follow Tie Yi with Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan to have a look. Mission reward: a high-grade solid gold pill. A pack of random limited-flavor crisp noodles.]</p>

    <p>This time. Wang Ling made his choice without any hesitation.</p>

    <p>At this time, in front of the monitor of Jiutian Jingmi Academy, Jing Heqiu saw Wang Ling actively choosing in seconds. He was also particularly excited: "Teng Lao! He chose! He chose three on his own initiative! He actually chose to investigate!"</p>

    <p>"Calm down."</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen sighed: "Choose three. There is nothing surprising. One of the people beside him is a disciple of the Arrow God Chu Tianjue, and the other is a disciple of the Mist God Luo Lan. With these two people by his side, I will choose three if he wants me." What a fuss you are making!"</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu: "???"</p>
