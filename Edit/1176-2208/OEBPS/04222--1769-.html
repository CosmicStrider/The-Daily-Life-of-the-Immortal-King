  <h1>Chapter 1769 Everyone is here</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Through his telepathy, Wang Ling knew that the little guy was blaming himself. It was not just one-sided because he was scared.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Muyu is very strong, the lack of combat experience is still a shortcoming in experience. It is difficult to accumulate it in a short period of time. He wanted to express himself. As a result, he made a fool of himself in front of Wang Ling. This made Wang Muyu lay on Wang Ling's shoulder and after crying for a while, he suddenly felt a deep sense of shame.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>He originally wanted to express himself and let Wang Ling praise him. Why not only did he fail to express himself, but he also cried on his father's shoulder?</p>

    <p>After thinking about it, Wang Muyu's little face turned red instantly. He couldn't even maintain the shape-changing state. He changed back to the original face of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He was so ashamed that he almost wanted to dig a hole and bury himself in it, just like an ostrich.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at this face that was carved out of the same template as his own, and the feeling of doubting life suddenly came up in his heart.</p>

    <p>To be honest, he has never shed a single tear since he was a child. After all, he always makes others cry when he strikes...</p>

    <p>Moreover, when facing Wang Ling, he felt that those who were beaten by him until they could cry out loud were considered lucky. Some people didn't even have time to cry... and they even needed him to find a way to clean up their mess and resurrect them on the spot.</p>

    <p>So before his eyes, he saw Wang Muyu's tearful look, as if he was looking at himself as a child. He had a magical feeling.</p>

    <p>"Dad... I didn't mean it. I will change back right away..." Wang Muyu looked at Wang Ling. He felt nervous.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling shook his head indeed and touched the little guy's head.</p>

    <p>What Wang Muyu needs to do now is to relax. If he continues to remain in the shape-shifting state, he will indeed become nervous easily.</p>

    <p>Of course. The most important thing is that they are now abroad. They don't have to worry about meeting familiar people here. So Wang Ling feels that there is no need to keep Wang Muyu in a state of transfiguration while he is abroad.</p>

    <p>He patiently rested for a while under the slide until Wang Muyu calmed down completely.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling then held the World Snack Coupon. Holding Wang Muyu's little hand, they headed to the large supermarket in Mixiu Country Glio City - Walwolf.</p>

    <p>At the door. Wang Ling found a string of scrolling text on the supermarket's electronic bulletin board: "Today. No one knows better than me. The crispy noodle series crispy noodle snack spree has been sold out. Please come to buy it tomorrow."</p>

    <p>As soon as this string of text appeared, Wang Ling's attention was directly attracted.</p>

    <p>No one knows better than me... A series of crispy noodles?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is not convinced.</p>

    <p>Because he really felt that there is no one in this world who knows crispy noodles better than him.</p>

    <p>He felt itchy and wanted to buy this crispy noodle.</p>

    <p>He has already dispatched avatars to other countries to carry out tasks. Only this Mixiu Country Glio City came from his own body.</p>

    <p>So when he saw this string of text, Wang Ling suddenly had a new idea in my mind.</p>

    <p>Anyway, today is Saturday. He felt that it was not impossible for him to take Wang Muyu to stay in Glio City for one night.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. Sun Rong soon received information that Wang Ling and Wang Muyu planned to spend the night in Mixiu Country Glio City. This was what Lord Diulei told her when Wang Ling came to discuss with Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>After all, Wang Ling and Wang Muyu have no entry information. Both of them teleported there. It is impossible to find a regular hotel to stay. So I can only ask for help from Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>However, although the Office of Strategic Deception is now expanding its overseas business, the current status of the Office of Strategic Deception's business in Glio City is still zero.</p>

    <p>"Hey. This piece of wood... why didn't you come to me directly." Sun Rong couldn't help but sigh in her heart after hearing the news.</p>

    <p>"The Office of Strategic Deception has not yet developed a map in Glio City. So I wanted to ask the Huaguo Shuilian Group... if it can be convenient?" Lord Diulei wiped his sweat and asked.</p>

    <p>"Of course you can. No problem. The matter between Wang Ling and Muyu is my business." Sun Rong laughed loudly.</p>

    <p>"As expected of the Huaguo Shuilian Group.</p>

    <p>Even has industries in Grio City. "That's not true." Sun Rong held the phone. She shook her head and said, "Zhenjun doesn't know something. Although our Huaguo Shuilian Group also has industry plans in Mixiu Country, the area is not in the city of Glio, it is somewhere else."</p>

    <p>"What about Miss Rong..."</p>

    <p>"Although we do not currently have any. But we can buy it, right?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong said: "I will ask grandpa to buy the chain hotel over there. It will be convenient for Wang Ling and Muyu to check in."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Lord Diulei swallowed his saliva: "..."</p>

    <p>Sure enough. Inhumane!</p>

    <p>The call ended. Sun Rong immediately arranged the purchase of a hotel chain. In fact, Glio City has been included in the future territory expansion plan of the Huaguo Shuilian Group a long time ago. But now it is advanced. Just carried out the plan.</p>

    <p>It's just the shares of a few hotel chains under the market. Compared with the Huaguo Shuilian Group's own business, this financial strength is just a drop in the bucket.</p>

    <p>"Yes. Grandpa. Then I'll trouble you."</p>

    <p>She quickly completed the communication with Boss Sun. Then she smiled and said, "Oh, by the way, Grandpa. Please ask Brother Xiaoche to book an express ticket for me to go to Glio City. Yes. I will need it right away. Grandpa, I won't miss school. I'll be back before Monday."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After deciding to stay in Glio City for one night, Wang Ling took Wang Muyu to the nearest cafe to wait for news about the hotel from Lord Diulei.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling has chosen a very hidden corner location, it still attracted the attention of many people.</p>

    <p>After all. There are blond and blue-eyed foreigners everywhere here. Their two Asian faces really make an impression easily.</p>

    <p>"Ah. What a cute little brother. Are you brothers?" A slightly fat and kind-looking woman came forward and took the initiative to communicate with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>In the city of Glio in Mixiu Country. These blond and blue-eyed foreigners all speak foreign languages. But Wang Ling does not have to worry about language problems.</p>

    <p>Because he has {great language skills}. No matter where he goes, he can communicate without borders. The foreign words he hears will be transformed into clear Mandarin in his ears. And the words he speaks on his own initiative will also be transformed into straight words. The well-spoken native language enters the minds of those with whom it communicates.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling did not reply. He just nodded. In contrast, Wang Muyu seemed more lively.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't expect that the little guy could do this.</p>

    <p>Because the little guy has the gene of "cultural dragon."</p>

    <p>This dragon has no other abilities. Its only purpose is to be educated. This gives Wang Muyu an extraordinary learning ability among ordinary cultivators and other dragon descendants.</p>

    <p>He used this ability to successfully make himself cute. In the end, the old woman paid for the table Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Bye-Bye."</p>

    <p>Before the woman left, she also left a name card for Wang Muyu, inviting Wang Muyu to visit their home if he had time.</p>

    <p>Such communication skills make Wang Ling not know what to say.</p>

    <p>He felt that this might be one of the few places where Wang Muyu was far better than him...</p>

    <p>A little dragon who has condensed all the genetic essence of the dragon family. He actually makes a living by being cute in a foreign country. Speaking of which, Wang Ling feels extremely emotional.</p>
