  <h1>Chapter 1885 Experts gathered in Chunlan Tower</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Maybe even the boss of Chunlan Tower didn't expect that he would have a big deal today. Although the boss himself had already received the booking fee with satisfaction and went out to enjoy himself.</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda directly paid enough to rebuild a New Chunlan Building. Even if Emperor Dongda demolished the place during the negotiation process, the boss would not complain at all.</p>

    <p>However, the essence of Chunlan Tower is still a place for male and female cultivators from the eternal world to have fun. It is also the place where the largest number of oirans and geishas gather in the entire Central Territory trade galaxy.</p>

    <p>And it is a place like this where fireworks, wine and meat are served. It is a place full of all kinds of splendid illusions and extravagance. A secret meeting of the Four Emperors that will shock the world is about to begin. This is probably something that all eternal cultivators would never have thought of.</p>

    <p>Because of the gathering of the Four Emperors, the remaining three emperors were not far from the central trading star. Following the assembly signal emitted by Zhuo Yi, three more people who wrapped themselves tightly came to Chunlan Tower soon. Cloaked man.</p>

    <p>Even if Wang Ling doesn't feel it, he knows it. This is the arrival of the remaining three great emperors. Even if their figures are well hidden by their cloaks, hr can still detect it from the unruffled aura of these three people. Show their extraordinary qualities.</p>

    <p>In the previous call to summon the crystal ball, Zhuo Yi had already hinted at the need to help Wang Ling hide his identity. So after the three people came up, they lined up respectfully in front of Emperor Dongda. The trick was done. They bowed together with respect and humility: "Poor monk Jin Deng..."</p>

    <p>"Xiang Yi..."</p>

    <p>"Li Xian..."</p>

    <p>"Meet Senior Wang!"</p>

    <p>I have to say that Monk Jin Deng looks very familiar with the body of an empress. He doesn't feel like a man at all. Instead, he embodies the charm of the empress more vividly. The only thing that is a little out of place is that he still retains the ability to be a monk.</p>

    <p>As we all know, although Monk Jin Deng has been a woman, overall he is still a serious monk. The experience of reincarnation is just his daily work as a Buddhist saint. There is nothing worth making a fuss about.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, Emperor Dongda savored the name carefully and suddenly came back to his senses.</p>

    <p>He had heard Zhuo Yi call Jin Deng's name before. He felt that the name seemed very familiar. Now Monk Jin Deng used the word "poor monk" to describe his family name. This suddenly woke up Emperor Dongda: "So it's you..."</p>

    <p>"Farewell for eternity. I didn't expect to be able to see the charm of Emperor Dongda across such a long time. It is really a blessing for this humble monk." Monk Jin Deng used the body of the empress to perform the Buddhist ritual. Then he sat down cross-legged.</p>

    <p>"Jin Deng. I didn't expect it was really you... I thought it was just the same name."</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda was shocked.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, this Jin Deng turned out to be the monk Jin Deng he knew! And this monk really lived into the modern world of cultivation! He also interacted with the Senior Wang in his body!</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda suddenly had mixed feelings in his heart. He thought that in the Eternal World Period, Monk Jin Deng's strength was not as incredible as it is now, but he was still one of the best talented players. He was once considered a strong contender for the throne of the Great Emperor.</p>

    <p>Everyone gathered. Wang Ying glanced at the front. He nodded with satisfaction. Then he began to convey the meaning of Wang Ling: "I believe what is coming next. You all understand. The situation is urgent. What we have to do now is to fix this deviated historical trajectory. Get back on track."</p>

    <p>"clear."</p>

    <p>The other three emperors nodded at the same time. They were all old acquaintances, so there was no barrier to communication.</p>

    <p>"Finally, let me talk about the rewards after successfully completing this mission."</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ying opened his mouth and said.</p>

    <p>Theoretically, most of the people here are now members of the Office of Strategic Deception. Although Xiang Yi and Qin Zhong are temporary guests and elders of the Office of Strategic Deception, they are actually members of the official establishment.</p>

    <p>Under normal circumstances, Office of Strategic Deception will be graded according to the difficulty of the task. The lowest is D, followed by C, B, A, S, SS and the highest SSS. Then Office of Strategic Deception will be organized according to the difficulty of the task. Finally, it will be based on The completion of the task and the performance of all task executors during the execution of the task are scored. The full score is 10 points.</p>

    <p>During the mission, if the score is below 6, it means that you did not perform outstandingly in the overall mission. You will only get part of the mission points. After accumulating, go to the treasure room of the Office of Strategic Deception to exchange for corresponding items.</p>

    <p>A score of 6 or above is completely different. And if the difficulty level of the task you receive is high, the rewards will be astonishing.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is not a stingy person. Although he clearly knows that as long as he says a word, everyone will do their best. But sometimes there are still rewards that should be given.</p>

    <p>"This time it is a temporary mission. The mission difficulty is the highest difficulty SSS level since the founding of our sect. All core members of the Office of Strategic Deception with a score of 6 or above can choose any magic weapon in King's Pants." Wang Ying said directly. Conveys the meaning of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The eyes of everyone present instantly lit up. Wang Ling himself didn't like the things in King's Pants. But to everyone here, every object inside was a treasure that could make the world rush to grab their heads.</p>

    <p>Of course. Scoring the sect's mission performance. This matter is usually decided by Lord Diulei and the elders of the Office of Strategic Deception after review and approval at a meeting. Occasionally, some sect disciples will deliberately please some elders to cover up their performance in the mission. A bit of fairness will be lost.</p>

    <p>Eh... the above-mentioned behavior. In fact, this is a very serious violation. If it is found out, there will be very severe punishment! In more severe cases, you may be directly expelled from the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>But this time, with Wang Ling supervising the entire mission, there was absolutely no objection.</p>

    <p>Ling Zhenren personally scores. It is absolutely fair and just!</p>

    <p>So the problem we are facing now is how to arrange the layout to bring out Peng Xiren smoothly.</p>

    <p>With Peng Xiren's cautious character, he would definitely not snatch the Book of Nine Realms if Emperor Dongda didn't show any flaws.</p>

    <p>And if the flaw is deliberately exposed, it will be too obvious, which will make Peng Xiren suspicious.</p>

    <p>At this time, the secret meeting of the Four Emperors gathered together. All the human connections and intelligence networks in the entire Eternal World were gathered here.</p>

    <p>Soon, Xiang Yi, who played the role of Emperor Beida, suddenly said: "By the way, there seems to be such an incident in Emperor Beida's memory. I remember that the Peng family was recruiting a consort? And the person being recruited was Peng Xiren's sister Peng Beicen. So I I think it would be better to..."</p>

    <p>After thinking about it, Xiang Yi quickly stopped talking and shook his head quickly: "No... forget it. I won't say it anymore. This can only be regarded as a bad idea."</p>

    <p>"You can speak out first and listen. It's just a discussion. It doesn't matter." Wang Ying said.</p>

    <p>Xiang Yi first glanced at Sun Rong. Then he said with a little embarrassment: "What I mean is, since the original copy of the Book of Nine Realms is with Senior Wang now, why not let Senior Wang bring this original copy to propose marriage." .."</p>

    <p>When everyone heard this, they were stunned for a moment. Then many people nodded to themselves.</p>

    <p>"It's okay. This idea doesn't seem too bad." Li Xian, who holds the title of Emperor of the West, said.</p>

    <p>"This, this, this... how can this be done!"</p>

    <p>However, at this moment. Sun Rong suddenly stood up excitedly. Her face was red: "This is absolutely not possible! It's too dangerous!"</p>

    <p>Seeing such an anxious look made everyone around her smile knowingly.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi looked at Sun Rong's appearance. The corners of his mouth raised crazily. He couldn't hold it back any longer: "Then Master's wife, what do you want to do?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong gained wisdom out of desperation. She patted her chest and said, "Let's do this! Give me the Book of Nine Realms! I'll disguise myself as a man. I'll propose marriage!"</p>
