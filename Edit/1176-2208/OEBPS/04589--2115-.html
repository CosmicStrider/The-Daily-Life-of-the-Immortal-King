  <h1>Chapter 2115 Wang Ling's new identity</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: [System: You have obtained a new identity (cell leader)]</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling changed into the prison chief's clothes, a prompt from the system immediately popped up in front of his eyes.</p>

    <p>When rechecking the taskbar, next to the profession, Wang Ling found a new expanded label [Prison Head].</p>

    <p>This also highly demonstrates the freedom in the game. That is, after triggering a hidden task and successfully completing the task, according to the different professional labels represented by the hidden NPC, as long as one of the opponent's equipment is picked up, it will automatically deemed to have acquired its identity.</p>

    <p>However, this identity will only be effective if you carry equipment that symbolizes your professional attributes.</p>

    <p>That is to say, in addition to the initial profession, a player can also obtain the identity of the other party by collecting specific NPC equipment to better complete the task.</p>

    <p>However, this identity is usually limited.</p>

    <p>For example, the things that symbolize the identity of this [Prison Leader] are his helmet, armor and a storage bag. On them are engraved the logo of the Fuyun Town Prison where Wang Ling is currently located.</p>

    <p>But these items all have weight.</p>

    <p>If you keep them all in your inventory, sooner or later it will be overloaded.</p>

    <p>The initial load limit of the basic inventory is 500. This is the same for every profession. The load will be calculated even if it is worn.</p>

    <p>During the game, the player's all-round attributes will be integrated to increase the load value.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling glanced at the prison head equipment he had just picked up: Floating Cloud Prison Head's helmet (white), Floating Cloud Prison Head's armor (white), and ordinary storage bag (green).</p>

    <p>The total weight of the three items is already 400 points.</p>

    <p>As a result, when he glanced at the total maximum weight limit behind him, he was immediately startled.</p>

    <p>He rubbed his eyes to make sure he saw it correctly.</p>

    <p>Yes. His weight capacity is actually 7800 points</p>

    <p>"It turns out that the upper limit of weight capacity is also affected by blood volume..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling muttered in his heart.</p>

    <p>He quickly figured out what was going on.</p>

    <p>500 points of basic load-bearing. Coupled with the blood volume passively accumulated by the stacked 73 layers of God's Descending Heart Technique, he has an excess load-bearing space from the beginning.</p>

    <p>This means that in the next outstanding stage, he may be able to gain more identities by relying on this game.</p>

    <p>This game is more interesting than Wang Ling imagined.</p>

    <p>Opening the ordinary storage bag at the head of the cell, Wang Ling got the following items: 500 copper coins, 5 ingots of silver, a second-grade spiritual stone (green) and two health recovery pills.</p>

    <p>After the storage bag is opened, the entire storage bag disappears automatically. This is regarded as a reward for completing this hidden mission. It is not for players.</p>

    <p>As for the many extra items, it does not affect the weight value. It is equivalent to the original weight of the storage bag.</p>

    <p>This means that if you encounter a particularly heavy storage bag later, it means that there may be good things inside.</p>

    <p>After summing up the things he had on hand, Wang Ling sat down directly in the dark cellar. He recited the mental formula silently for a while and raised his passive level to 90.</p>

    <p>Then he took and swallowed the two blood-restoring pills.</p>

    <p>At this point, his blood volume has completely returned to full.</p>

    <p>A blood recovery pill can restore 500 points. It can also eliminate the character's hunger state.</p>

    <p>Now. Wang Ling can really be said to be resurrected with full health.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling looked back at the monsters in the wall behind. At the same time, he felt very complicated.</p>

    <p>It's not like he has never dealt with monsters. After all, he still has Er Ha at home. Moreover, Er Ha has been transformed from a monster into a spiritual beast. Now he has been promoted to the level of a divine beast.</p>

    <p>He knew clearly that the monsters in the game were fictitious, but he still felt a little kindness towards this monster that was kept in captivity. This monster killed many people. But Wang Ling clearly knew this. They were all forced out by this prison boss.</p>

    <p>Because it was not given food, in order to survive, this monster had no other choice. Because of this, it was also full of hatred for the prison boss... and at the final moment, it regarded the prison boss as its own rations.</p>

    <p>In other words, there was no real contractual relationship between the prison leader and the monster from the beginning. It was purely a result of the prison leader forcibly enslaving the monster through violent means.</p>

    <p>Everything has a cause and an effect.</p>

    <p>After thinking about everything, Wang Ling directly reached into the gap between the bricks.</p>

    <p>This time, the monster didn't attack him.</p>

    <p>Soon. Wang Ling felt a furry touch on his fingertips. This monster actually moved his own body closer.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt it carefully. He stroked the head of the monster in the wall. It felt like the monster felt a bit like a... cat?</p>

    <p>At this moment, another system prompt came.</p>

    <p>And it's another hidden mission.</p>

    <p>[System: You have triggered an unknown plot. Investigate the monsters inside the wall]</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded slightly. Then he touched the cat demon's head through the gap between the bricks. Then he left the spiritual stone in his inventory to the cat demon.</p>

    <p>A piece of inferior spirit stone (green). The price marked by the system is 10 silver ingots.</p>

    <p>Spiritual stones are the hard currency in the cultivation world. However, according to the fluctuation of local market conditions, the transaction price of spiritual stones in each place will fluctuate slightly, but not too much. Generally, the selling price marked by the system is where Wang Ling is located. selling price.</p>

    <p>Even for Wang Ling, 10 ingots of silver was a very valuable initial start-up cost in the early stages of the game. But he did not choose to sell this spiritual stone. Instead, he directly left it to this cat demon.</p>

    <p>By absorbing the spiritual power from this spiritual stone, this cat demon should be able to survive for a while longer.</p>

    <p>"Stop eating people."</p>

    <p>Then, he only left these words and left the cellar with his new identity as cell leader.</p>

    <p>Just like the previous prison guard, he sealed the entrance of the dark cellar tightly with a jar of pickled sauerkraut.</p>

    <p>The whole process of walking out of the cell was smooth and smooth. This is the benefit of the new identity. The NPC only recognizes the identity and not the face...</p>

    <p>But if you meet a player, you might be exposed.</p>

    <p>This problem. www.uukanshu.net Wang Ling feels that it is necessary to be cautious.</p>

    <p>After successfully walking out of the cell, the feeling of seeing the sun again made Wang Ling feel the beauty of freedom. All the sunshine and air were fictitious. But at this moment, there was an indescribable sense of reality in front of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He enjoyed the blessings brought by the sun and rain. For the first time in the game, he felt Bai Qiao's soul communication with him as the game producer rather than as his sheath spirit.</p>

    <p>This is probably a gamer. He wants to see a vision of the future...</p>

    <p>But this journey is destined to be a long one.</p>

    <p>Dreams always have to be had.</p>

    <p>Maybe one day, domestic game masterpieces can really go global?</p>

    <p>He was sighing in his heart. At this time, a Fuyun Town jailer came towards him. He bowed to him respectfully and explained the situation: "Prison leader, General Chen is looking for you! He said he has something important to discuss with you!"</p>
