  <h1>Chapter 2038 The mysterious girl resurrected in the Sun family's ancestral land</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: As the ground loosened a little, a slender hand as white as jade poked out from in front of the tombstone.</p>

    <p>She was like a hibiscus in a swimming pool. She stretched out her two hands and directly scratched the soil on the side, then stretched out her upper body.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling did not move. He just stood close and observed. He couldn't help but frown.</p>

    <p>From ancient times to the present, the girl buried here has actually been able to keep her body incorruptible for such a long time. You must know that even the Eternals imprisoned in the Corpse Map have now become skeletons. Even Li Xian Zhang Zhui's body was created with the help of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling focused the King's Eyes on the half of the ancient armor exposed by the girl.</p>

    <p>That is a real golden jade garment. Each scale of the armor is made of rich and powerful spiritual stones. Even though they are separated from ancient times to the present, they can still exude their own charm.</p>

    <p>"A chaos weapon that has reached the third level of annihilation. No wonder." Wang Ying also saw the clue. He could feel that the jade armor on the girl's body was unusual. This jade armor and the carvings on each The ancient runes on the jade stone directly kept the girl's body incorruptible.</p>

    <p>However, although the mystery of the immortal body has been solved, it still allows the girl to be buried underground in the ancient battlefield of the Sun family's ancestral land for such a long time.</p>

    <p>The reason why she woke up or was activated is still doubtful.</p>

    <p>After all, Wang Ling was just passing by. And he didn't make much changes to the Sun family's original restrictions. It was like adding a new fingerprint lock.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Wang Ling actually does not directly replace Boss Sun's position as the head of the Sun family. It just adds a master setting to the Sun family's ancestral land.</p>

    <p>Of course. When all investigations are completed, Wang Ling will be responsible for restoring the ban to its original state.</p>

    <p>At this time, the cute girl who had been sleeping underground for a long time finally pulled out her last right leg. Her eyes were very blurred. It was obvious that she was not very clear about why she appeared here.</p>

    <p>To be honest, before the girl showed her face, Wang Ling thought that the person buried in this tombstone might be the Sun Fu he met when his soul traveled through the ages.</p>

    <p>But the unfamiliar facial features in front of him disappointed him.</p>

    <p>Sun Fu's heroic appearance and heroic expression made Wang Ling quite unforgettable. But the girl in front of her had a silly and cute look on her face, like a dull gourd. She didn't speak even after pulling out her body. Just look at him so quietly. Make eye contact with him.</p>

    <p>This feeling of waking up from a big dream and not fully waking up is vividly reflected in the girl.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling always had her school uniform in her trouser pocket. She was thinking about what to do next. Unexpectedly, the figure of this cute girl disappeared in an instant.</p>

    <p>She was wearing such a heavy jade battle armor. She was as light as lightning when she moved. Even though she had been sleeping since ancient times, as a genius who could be buried in the ancient battlefield of the Sun family's ancestral land, her amazing strength and fighting instincts were still present in an instant. was awakened.</p>

    <p>"So fast." Even Wang Ying was amazed. The girl was wearing a jade armor, but her body suddenly moved sideways like light and electricity.</p>

    <p>She almost teleported to the front of Wang Ling. A bright light lit up when she raised her hand. A golden sword gathered the power of thunder and swiped it. It struck Wang Ling firmly on the forehead.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>As soon as the knife went down, the ground beneath Wang Ling's feet cracked open instantly. The blade seemed to have penetrated Wang Ling's body and cut the ground into pieces. Countless gravels were rolled up by the air waves.</p>

    <p>The sword light was very long. It swept forward like a waterfall. The bright lightning turned into long dragons and shot out in all directions. It roared and was so brilliant that it was a bit dazzling.</p>

    <p>The cute girl's fighting instinct is really strong. It forms a sharp contrast with her personality.</p>

    <p>Its combat ability far exceeds that of other cultivators on the earth. With this sword strike just now, Wang Ling estimated the girl's level.</p>

    <p>It is a Dao God state.</p>

    <p>And his fighting power is very strong. He is more fierce than the heads of several major aristocratic families in God's Domain.</p>

    <p>But it's a pity. The cute girl's operation was as fierce as a tiger's. It didn't even break a hair on Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Physical attacks are ineffective against Wang Ling. Especially Dao God level attacks. They are simply not good enough for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Huh?"</p>

    <p>Obviously, the cute girl's question revealed that there was a big question mark in her heart at this time.</p>

    <p>Although this blow was struck with fighting instinct, it did not hurt Wang Ling at all. This was something she had never imagined.</p>

    <p>In fact, at the moment when the girl struck with the sword, Wang Ling used the "Great Tai Chi Technique" to directly dissolve the power brought by the sword. Therefore, the power of the sword directly passed through Wang Ling. Wang Ling's body was hit on the land beneath his feet.</p>

    <p>Just like a lightning rod guiding lightning into the ground. The power of Tai Chi to release energy played a vital role at this moment.</p>

    <p>If Wang Ling allowed the girl to chop him on the head, he would be unscathed. But the damage caused by the backlash is not something that the girl alone can bear.</p>

    <p>Now the identity of this cute girl is a mystery. Although she was rude, she could appear on this ancient battlefield. This girl's true identity may also be an ancestor of the Sun family. The respect that should be given must still be given.</p>

    <p>At this moment, a buzzing sound came from the void.</p>

    <p>The familiar teleportation array of more than ten rounds lit up again at this moment.</p>

    <p>They were the mountain-suppressing knights from the Sun family's ancestral land. They felt the spiritual power of the girl's sword and gathered here directly. More than a dozen mountain-suppressing knights appeared. The cute girl's face was also a little confused.</p>

    <p>"I am Sun Ru." She turned around and introduced herself to these mountain knights.</p>

    <p>Obviously, the girl also knows very well what these mountain knights are.</p>

    <p>In other words, as early as in ancient times, the mountain knights had been put into use by the ancestors of the Sun family. www.uukanshu.net</p>

    <p>However, in the face of the Sun family bloodline that has spanned such a long period of time and traversed the ancient times, today's Zhenshan Knights have not changed the ban on the Sun family's ancestral land, and are not accompanied by the current Sun family head. They will eliminate the modern Sun family. Everyone outside your home is considered an intruder.</p>

    <p>The cute girl reported her home to no avail. Seeing that the mountain knight was about to attack, the thunder of the golden sword in her hand surged again.</p>

    <p>Just as he was about to take action, Wang Ling raised his hand and waved his hand gently at the group of mountain knights. The mountain knights nodded in understanding and immediately changed direction and returned the same way.</p>

    <p>This scene completely shocked Sun Ru. She turned her head and looked at the young man standing in front of her in disbelief.</p>

    <p>This is the unique mountain-suppressing knight of the Sun family. He will only listen to the words of the head of the Sun family...</p>

    <p>In other words, the head of the Sun family has changed hands while she was sleeping...</p>

    <p>So. The young man standing in front of her is actually... the current head of the Sun family!</p>
