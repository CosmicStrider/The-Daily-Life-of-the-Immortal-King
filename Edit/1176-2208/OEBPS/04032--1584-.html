  <h1>Chapter 1584 Fenmu Shen's bloodline is actually an ancient god?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Although Wang Nuan and Leng Ming had long been prepared, they felt that the eternal evil god in front of them would not be killed so easily. But now that they saw the evil purple mass of flesh squirming again, the sense of surprise in their hearts was still very strong.</p>

    <p>"You must strike first while he is still in shape." Leng Ming frowned slightly.</p>

    <p>He is not stupid enough to wait for Fenmu Shen to really resurrect. Such a bloody plot does not exist.</p>

    <p>"Sun and Moon Sword Light!"</p>

    <p>Leng Ming raised his sword fingers together. A green aurora burst out from his fingertips. Thunder flowers bloomed in the void like lightning.</p>

    <p>The energy soaring into the sky was more blazing than lightning.</p>

    <p>It gave birth to an amazing power.</p>

    <p>It hit the purple piece of flesh with precision.</p>

    <p>This move "Sun and Moon Sword Light" is the power that Leng Ming originally possessed. The name of the move has the meaning of "a piece of grass can cut the sun, moon and stardust."</p>

    <p>This is Leng Ming's other unique skill besides "Grass Guillotine."</p>

    <p>The difference is that this trick was not taught by Jingke and Bai Qiao. It was learned by Leng Ming himself.</p>

    <p>The two quickly produce friction. Then a big explosion occurs.</p>

    <p>Leng Ming's sword energy collided with the squirming purple flesh, causing a terrifying glow. The extremely high temperature seemed to melt everything.</p>

    <p>However, when the smoke dissipated, the purple piece of flesh not only was not destroyed, but became even more expanded.</p>

    <p>"Ah Nuan! Help me!" Leng Ming did not believe in evil and launched a second attack.</p>

    <p>He called Ah Nuan.</p>

    <p>He saw Ah Nuan girl hugging his neck tightly. The most powerful backpack-type power bank in the universe was working again.</p>

    <p>"100 times! Sun and moon sword light!"</p>

    <p>The dimension of the second sun-moon sword light increased again with the help of Ah Nuan. It carried a destructive power that penetrated the universe.</p>

    <p>However.</p>

    <p>When the destruction sword pillar with a diameter of a hundred feet struck that lump of flesh.</p>

    <p>Everything was once again like a mud cow plunging into the sea. Everything was calm again.</p>

    <p>Previously it was clearly only as big as a fingernail.</p>

    <p>After Leng Ming's first sword attack, he grew to the size of a palm.</p>

    <p>And now this second sword comes down.</p>

    <p>It has actually grown to the size of a Kuxuan!</p>

    <p>"Is this... absorbing my sword energy?" Leng Ming was shocked. He had never encountered such a situation before. It just felt weird.</p>

    <p>This evil god was not an orthodox earthly cultivator in the first place, but an alien creature.</p>

    <p>He felt that the scene in front of him might be related to the alien blood of this evil god.</p>

    <p>It can actually absorb energy to reshape its body for resurrection... What kind of monster is this?</p>

    <p>"This is not like the ability of ordinary cultivators." Wang Ming looked at this scene from a distance and was also thinking.</p>

    <p>Although he didn't know what Fenmu Shen's bloodline consisted of, the purple flesh in front of him still gave him a familiar feeling.</p>

    <p>Especially... when this mass of purple flesh grows tentacles...</p>

    <p>"Old Dominator." This was the first reaction in Wang Ming's mind.</p>

    <p>Legend has it that this is a powerful and ancient existence in the universe. Its existence is composed of unknown substances and laws that are far beyond the understanding of the mortal world. Therefore, the laws of the ordinary human cultivation world may not have any effect on it.</p>

    <p>For a long time, among the hypotheses about cosmic civilization, there has also been the view that there was a more powerful and ancient civilization before the establishment of the cultivator civilization.</p>

    <p>And those ancient gods called "Old Dominators." Such is the case.</p>

    <p>It's just that Wang Ming has only seen these things in related "papers" and ." He never thought that they actually existed."</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Ling looked at this scene and had some guesses in his mind.</p>

    <p>The mysterious thing called "Destiny" that "Zheng" mentioned before.</p>

    <p>From now on, Fenmu Shen should have obtained the power of the "mysterious object" part.</p>

    <p>It was that power that reactivated the ancient god's bloodline that Fenmu Shen originally possessed but had been diluted by time.</p>

    <p>In other words.</p>

    <p>The biggest trump card Fenmu Shen has always relied on is that he is not in "Dao."</p>

    <p>Just like Wang Ling's King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>The ordinary secular laws of the world of cultivation have no way to restrict these strange ancient gods of the universe.</p>

    <p>Now. Wang Ling finally understands Dao Ancestor Wang's good intentions in sealing the "Mysterious Object."</p>

    <p>This is because we are worried that the ancient civilization of the universe will be revived because of that "mysterious object", which will have a further impact on human cultivation civilization.</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling suddenly had a very interesting and dangerous idea.</p>

    <p>What kind of chemical reaction will occur if this "mysterious object" is combined with a human cultivator who does not have any bloodline of the ancient gods?</p>

    <p>Although his face didn't show any emotion.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling still had to admit that his mood at this moment was exciting.</p>

    <p>He has been searching for an answer all this time.</p>

    <p>That is what your own King's Eyes is.</p>

    <p>Now, he felt that he might be able to find new answers from the lump of flesh transformed by Fenmu Shen in front of him and the mysterious "mysterious object."</p>

    <p>"Ah Nuan is in danger! This thing is too weird..."</p>

    <p>When Wang Ming subconsciously became nervous about the situation that suddenly changed again before him.</p>

    <p>He turned his attention to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But I saw that the young man had once again wandered into the world...</p>

    <p>Only this time. He was not driven back by Ah Nuan.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, the supreme world that has stopped falling into collapse is undergoing reorganization under the lingering and swirling of countless dark fragments.</p>

    <p>These fragments are like puzzle pieces. They have an aura of darkness.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen has not fully recovered. But the lump of meat has become infinitely large. A huge lump of meat that is the size of a stadium with a capacity of 100,000 people is floating in the void.</p>

    <p>The purple-black body contains some disgusting and unknown green viscous liquid. There are terrifying and complex tentacles on all sides.</p>

    <p>Leng Ming knew.</p>

    <p>This horrific resurrection ritual has not stopped yet. He must stop the resurrection before Fenmu Shen Type 2 is fully formed.</p>

    <p>However, at this time, the huge pressure made Leng Ming realize that his body could not move.</p>

    <p>The terrifying creature in front of him, which transcended eternity, actually gave rise to a kind of fear in his body like an instinct.</p>

    <p>Buzz! A sound!</p>

    <p>The situation is changing, and in the supreme world of boundless darkness. At this moment, there is infinite holy light falling from the sky. This is the new summons brought by the flesh of Fenmu Shen.</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan and Leng Ming saw a silhouette of a human figure appearing in the falling holy light. They couldn't see the face clearly. The whole body was black. It was very tall, with a height of dozens of feet.</p>

    <p>Their upper bodies take on the form of humans, while their lower bodies are like tentacles like an octopus. With a mysterious shimmering veil, they seem to be extremely kind and benevolent.</p>

    <p>But Wang Nuan could clearly feel that what was behind this veil was endless surging brutality.</p>

    <p>These are the guardian guards of the resurrection ritual.</p>

    <p>"The one who lives forever."</p>

    <p>At this moment, a familiar figure landed and stood in front of Wang Nuan and Leng Ming.</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren..." Leng Ming's eyes were dull. He saw Wang Ling appear. Suddenly, he felt that the pressure he felt disappeared instantly.</p>

    <p>"Haha!"</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Nuan kicked up his white and tender calves and climbed onto Leng Ming's shoulders. Then he kicked off and jumped onto Wang Ling's back.</p>

    <p>This warm touch was transmitted from Leng Ming to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Before Wang Ling came, he originally refused to cooperate with Ah Nuan girl.</p>

    <p>The Ancient God of the Universe in front of him was not a mortal being. He was stranger and more difficult to deal with than any previous opponent. He was worried that Wang Nuan would be injured.</p>

    <p>But at this moment. Wang Ling changed his mind.</p>

    <p>"Do you want to go too? Ah Nuan." Wang Ling said.</p>

    <p>"Ya!"</p>

    <p>Ah Nuan girl lay on Wang Ling's shoulder. It was like a pile of soft and glutinous cakes.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt as if his heart had melted.</p>

    <p>He suddenly felt.</p>

    <p>Mixed doubles between brother and sister. Seems pretty good.</p>
