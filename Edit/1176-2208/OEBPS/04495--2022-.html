  <h1>Chapter 2022 Wang Ling's Great Rewind Technique</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Hundreds of years ago. The place where the Sun family worshiped their ancestors was on the East Huaxiu Sea.</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan clearly remembers that at that time, he followed the guidance of the Heavenly Master who controlled the location for the Sun family's ancestor worship. He spent huge financial resources to build a temporary artificial floating island on the East Huaxiu Sea for worship.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the sacrificial ceremony that year also caused a great sensation. Just for this floating island used for temporary sacrificial rituals, the Sun family even obtained approval for reclamation.</p>

    <p>After the sacrificial ceremony, this temporarily built artificial floating island was not wasted. It was later put into use by Huaxiu Alliance for maritime training.</p>

    <p>After all, it is an artificially constructed floating island. It has also been used for maritime training. After many rounds of spiritual bombings, the Sun family's sacrificial island has now become a wreckage.</p>

    <p>When he heard that the coordinates of Sun Rong appeared in the East Huaxiu Sea, Sun Yiyuan almost immediately thought of the sacrificial rituals hundreds of years ago. After all, the Sun family does not rely on the sea for food. The family does not have aquatic products business. Moreover, no trading port was established near the East Huaxiu Sea. The only connection with the East Huaxiu Sea was the sacrificial ceremony held hundreds of years ago.</p>

    <p>What is Rongrong doing in the East Huaxiu Sea?</p>

    <p>Could it be that he knows the way to enter the ancestral land and is curious to take a look?</p>

    <p>Or was it hinted and instigated by someone?</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan suddenly became a little nervous. It was against the clan rules to enter the ancestral land without permission.</p>

    <p>Yes. Under normal circumstances, if you want to enter the ancestral land, it is not impossible...</p>

    <p>But it must be approved by the owner of the jade tube. The jade tube used for instructions will record the detailed instruction time. And this time cannot be changed.</p>

    <p>Because there is a recorder in the ancestral land. The time displayed on the jade tube must be before the recorder. In other words, even if Sun Yiyuan deliberately lies for Sun Rong, there is nothing he can do if Sun Rong makes a wrong step. The circle is back.</p>

    <p>He trained Sun Rong as the future successor of the Sun family. If he doesn't pay attention to this now, it will be dangerous once he is caught by other shareholders of the Huaguo Shuilian Group.</p>

    <p>In the process of rushing to the East Huaxiu Sea, Sun Yiyuan had a lot of thoughts in his mind. Based on his understanding of Sun Rong's personality, he believed that his granddaughter was not someone who would easily leave clues.</p>

    <p>Caution has always been her synonym. And she has been taught the clan rules since childhood. She should know the stakes of this matter.</p>

    <p>I just hope things don't go as he imagined...</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan couldn't help but shed a drop of cold sweat on his cheek. He accelerated his sword and headed towards the East Huaxiu Sea. The huge extended version of the luxurious spirit sword passed through the void, attracting many people's attention.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Strange. I remember that the Island of Sacrifice should be near here. How come I can't see it?"</p>

    <p>Since Wang Ling could not find any clues after several explorations above the surface of the East Huaxiu Sea, Sun Rong suggested going to the Sacrifice Island to take a look.</p>

    <p>Although the Sacrifice Island had been bombed into rubble a long time ago due to training, it is no longer what it used to be. But Sun Rong has always had an intuition. It may not necessarily be possible to detect anything on the Sacrifice Island.</p>

    <p>She followed the coordinates in her memory and formed an air sword team with Wang Ling and Immortal Toya. Together they rushed to the coordinates with their swords. As a result, the sponge underneath was nothing.</p>

    <p>Then, Wang Ling's spiritual consciousness extended. It penetrated directly into the void. According to Sun Rong's description, it touched the location of the island of sacrifice.</p>

    <p>This is a method of phantom time retrieval. It can perform phantom retracement of a designated area, thereby simulating what specifically happened here before...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is also called: the Great Rewind Technique.</p>

    <p>Although the area of effect is limited, the advantage is that this method will not cause time and space confusion. The key is that it can also be used for reasoning to solve crimes and understand what happened before.</p>

    <p>As the spell was cast, the remains of the Island of Sacrifice emerged like a mirage on the sea in front of them.</p>

    <p>"It's the island of sacrifice!" Sun Rong was surprised.</p>

    <p>"It's just an illusion. Don't be too excited. Miss Sun." At this time, Immortal Toya's voice suddenly sounded.</p>

    <p>Everyone continued to watch the illusion's retrospective demonstration. Then a mysterious figure in a robe appeared. The other person seemed to be injured. He swam and climbed up to the island of sacrifice. His body movements were particularly strange. There were A feeling of disharmony in the limbs. At the same time, he also released a dim red-blue aura...</p>

    <p>"Huh? This doesn't seem to be the same person?"</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya saw this scene and gave a strange look: "Why do I look like an injured weapon spirit?"</p>

    <p>This is a judgment based solely on his many years of experience.</p>

    <p>And the facts prove that Immortal Toya's judgment was not wrong.</p>

    <p>Because Wang Ling recognized the identity of the injured weapon spirit at a glance...</p>

    <p>That's right. It was Mingyue Ye who was taken care of by me not long ago. In order to save her life, she was forced to become the spirit of the wand.</p>

    <p>It stands to reason that after he transforms into the wand spirit, his appearance will also change. But Wang Ling can still tell him apart at a glance...</p>

    <p>"It's a bright moon night." Wang Ling sighed.</p>

    <p>He thought this was an evil fate...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels as if every time he saves someone's life, this kind of operation will always happen.</p>

    <p>Just like when he killed Er Ha three times. This bright moon night actually appeared in front of him again and again...</p>

    <p>"Oh. So it's him."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong and Immortal Toya nodded one after another. They both suddenly came to their senses.</p>

    <p>But why did this guy come to the Sun family's sacrificial island after he was beaten away...</p>

    <p>At this time, the retrospective illusion formed by the Great Rewind Technique was broadcast to the most critical scene. It happened to answer the common question in everyone's mind.</p>

    <p>I saw that after landing on the island of sacrifice on this bright moonlit night, I actually bent down and started licking the entire island.</p>

    <p>This scene made the three of them look stunned.</p>

    <p>"I understand..." Immortal Toya tapped his palms. He seemed to have thought of something and said, "I remember that the base construction material of the Sacrificial Island was a precious medicinal coral called Tianwai Coral. But although it is medicinal coral, it cannot be used as medicine."</p>

    <p>"Senior, do you know why?"</p>

    <p>"This kind of medicinal coral will lose its medicinal properties once it is exposed to heat. Therefore, it can only exert its medicinal properties when chewed raw. But this thing is too hard. Even the Itinerant Immortal state cannot chew it. How can normal people have such teeth? So this The coral is also known as the tasteless coral."</p>

    <p>"A coral that even the Itinerant Immortal realm can't chew on?"</p>

    <p>To put it bluntly, powerful people with truly high realms can't look down on the outer corals. But cultivators with low realms can't chew it. That's why it's called tasteless.</p>

    <p>However, in recent years, a small group of weapon refiners have been testing the use of tasteless coral in the past few years. They believe that adding a little bit of tasteless coral when refining can improve the toughness of spiritual weapons.</p>

    <p>Today's Mingyue Night is due to physical damage. This entire floating island made of outer corals is not looked down upon by others. But it is of great value to him.</p>

    <p>Now he has become a weapon spirit. Therefore, this floating island is a rich mine for him.</p>

    <p>There is an old saying that goes: You get what you eat.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the behavior of eating the sacrificial island on a bright moonlit night also happened to prove that the operation of the weapon refiners adding tasteless corals in the weapon refining process was completely correct...</p>

    <p>Looking at the scene played by the retrospective illusion in front of them, the three of them fell into silence for a long time.</p>

    <p>After watching it for a few more minutes, in the scene of the retrospection, the shadow of a huge whale emerged from the bottom of the sea. Its island-like body rolled up huge waves, causing the waves on the East Huaxiu Sea to surge rapidly.</p>

    <p>Then, it let out a roar and swallowed up Mingyue Ye and the entire remnant Sun Family Sacrifice Island in one go...</p>
