  <h1>Chapter 2080 A single move affects the whole body</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: Hong Siqi's fate was tragic. He was towed away by a ship sent by Mixiu Country. When he boarded the ship, his buttocks were still closed. His skin was scorched black.</p>

    <p>If this section were not in a large size, it would be impossible to look straight at it.</p>

    <p>The key point was also photographed by many casual cultivators who were watching the scene.</p>

    <p>Everyone knows it. Today's Internet communication speed is coupled with the marketing account's embellished and exaggerated copywriting.</p>

    <p>Almost immediately, the name Hong Siqi hit the front page.</p>

    <p>Pass it on!</p>

    <p>Hong Siqi was killed by a disciple of the Sword Master! With just one drop of water! He was blown into a burnt black suckling pig!</p>

    <p>Pass it on!</p>

    <p>The secret to the promotion of newly promoted Venerated Immortal Hong Siqi is to eat roasted suckling pig! But it is suspected that his fat intake exceeds the standard and he loses to the Golden Core disciples! No matter how high the realm is, you must know how to maintain health!</p>

    <p>Pass it on!</p>

    <p>The disciples of the Sword Master instantly killed Hong Siqi. It was because there was dark matter in the swordsmanship! The combat power system was out of balance. Humanity may be facing its darkest moment!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, who was still shopping in the Sun family's ancestral land, took out his mobile phone and glanced at it during the break. He just asked Wang Muyu to go to the sea restricted area. Why did the entire sea restricted area suddenly become lively?</p>

    <p>To be honest, he was actually not part of Wang Ling's calculations. In other words, starting from this incident, Wang Ling didn't want to involve the surrounding cultivating countries too much in this matter.</p>

    <p>After all, Qiao Yanyuan is very risky. This is the strongest dragonborn under Bai Zhe. If such a person is exposed in front of the major cultivation countries, who knows what kind of chemical reaction will be generated?</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling closed his eyes and directly connected to Zhuo Yi's thoughts in his own conscious universe.</p>

    <p>The matter is urgent. The words of online marketing accounts cannot be trusted. The mobile phone signal in the Sun family's ancestral land is also intermittent. Wang Ling is forced to use this slightly abrupt method to connect to the soul of Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>But seeing Zhuo Yi bowing respectfully, he said to Wang Ling: "Master, it is now confirmed that Master Mi Xiuyuan has made the decision to send the fleet directly to the restricted area."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Although he had seen some marketing accounts saying that Mi XiuYuan Zun had ordered the ships to be dispatched, it was a marketing account after all. Wang Ling felt that it was not entirely credible. Now that Zhuo Yi confirmed this, he felt in his heart Suddenly, the whole incident started to become more and more troublesome.</p>

    <p>To be honest, he asked Wang Muyu and Yi Jianchuan, the pair of masters and disciples, to go to the restricted sea area to find Qiao Yanyuan. On the one hand, it was to allow Wang Muyu to strengthen his character with the help of the Sword Master. On the other hand, he wanted Wang Muyu to give the Sword Master some inspiration. Let the realm of this old sword master be improved.</p>

    <p>I just didn't expect that before the sea restricted area, there was actually Hong Siqi, who took out a loan to repair the immortal, and took the lead in attacking...</p>

    <p>Now the entire restricted area of the sea, the entire Daxi Linghai, is in chaos just because of this Hong Siqi.</p>

    <p>However, the more chaotic the situation, the more caution is needed.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling knows. Zhang Zhui has gone.</p>

    <p>In addition, there is Yue Ling, which is differentiated from Crispy Noodles Dao Lord.</p>

    <p>There are these two people plus Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>In terms of combat power, the balance is definitely enough.</p>

    <p>But it's not very safe.</p>

    <p>After much thought, Wang Ling felt that sending too many people there was unnecessary.</p>

    <p>It's better to choose the best from the best. It's more comprehensive.</p>

    <p>So at that moment. Wang Ling thought of two people.</p>

    <p>And Zhuo Yi almost thought of it together with Wang Ling: "Master, don't say anything. Let me guess. Who do you want to send."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi said respectfully: "Senior Qin Zhong and Senior Xiang Yi. I think besides these two, you can't worry about anyone else."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised an eyebrow.</p>

    <p>I have to say. Zhuo Yi has been with him for so long. Now the spiritual understanding between their master and disciple is even better than before.</p>

    <p>"Just them." Gu</p>

    <p>So. Wang Ling nodded at Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Then the communication with Zhuo Yi was directly disconnected.</p>

    <p>In the reserve talent pool of all the big lists of Wang Ling. So far, there is really no more reliable person than these two.</p>

    <p>The key is, regarding the origins of these two people. Even for Bai Zhe, it was like a surprise from heaven.</p>

    <p>They do not belong to this universe. Therefore, even if Bai Zhe wants to trace their origin, he may not be able to trace it.</p>

    <p>The current Xiang Yi and Qin Zhong are white households on Wang Ling's side. But to the universe where Wang Ling lives, they are indeed black households.</p>

    <p>Normal people would definitely not dare to do this. If you force yourself to stay here, there is a possibility of being directly obliterated by the will of the universe at any time.</p>

    <p>However, it is different if Wang Ling is kept.</p>

    <p>After all, it's his face.</p>

    <p>Slightly bigger than others.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>As soon as they heard the news that Master Mi Xiuyuan had ordered to send a fleet to the restricted sea area, some people immediately couldn't sit still.</p>

    <p>Out of his understanding of his old friend, the first cultivator who couldn't help but stand up was Xiongxiu.</p>

    <p>When Xiong Xiu Yuan Zun heard the news, he immediately gathered around the table. He thought that Mi Xiu Yuan Zun must have discovered something in the restricted area of the sea and was leaving it here to earn a living.</p>

    <p>On the surface, it was to find the mysterious man who secretly set up an ambush and crippled Hong Siqi. In fact, he must have discovered some big secret in the restricted area of the sea!</p>

    <p>Otherwise, Wei Shen's Maiko Assi went in a few days ago. And there is no news yet?</p>

    <p>Maybe this is just because there is no news on the surface. Maybe the secrets in the restricted area of the sea were revealed by Maiko Assi himself.</p>

    <p>He knows his old friend too well!</p>

    <p>I think this matter is definitely not as simple as I thought!</p>

    <p>Therefore, Xiongxiu Yuan Zun also ordered to send the same</p>

    <p>The first one said that he would send a fleet of spiritual ships of the same size to go together.</p>

    <p>As a result, when Master Mi Xiuyuan heard this and discussed it with his subordinates, his face showed a look of joy.</p>

    <p>After all, they really just wanted to seek revenge. They had no other ideas.</p>

    <p>Who would have thought that Xiongxiu Yuan Zun would actually take the initiative to propose the idea of going together? Is this movie just to increase their combat power?</p>

    <p>Everyone is well aware of the dangers of the restricted sea area. Therefore, in this situation, some people actually wanted to go with them. Mi XiuYuan Zun immediately smiled so much that his molars could be seen.</p>

    <p>The two mainstream cultivators in the world, Yuan Zun, hit it off so well. It made the rest of the cultivators tremble...</p>

    <p>Then. There is no more.</p>

    <p>In the sea area of Daxiling, dozens of strategic maritime ships and underwater nuclear-powered submarines followed several aircraft carriers bearing the logos of different cultivating countries and entered directly through the sea entrance.</p>

    <p>Originally, there was a barrier at the entrance to this sea restricted area. It was originally set up by the Yuan Zun of the major cultivation countries. But what people didn't expect was that the monks of this Xiu Zhen country were too tough in their style.</p>

    <p>Before everyone could discuss the specific entry plan, he immediately swirled the whiskey in his hand and ordered the artillery fire to be fired at the barrier prohibiting Haikou...</p>

    <p>Under the continuous bombardment of hundreds or even thousands of psychic missiles directed at a single point. No matter how tough the node is, it is difficult to resist such continuous bombardment.</p>

    <p>So. The entrance to the barrier was opened...</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui, Yue Lingwei looked at the aircraft carriers and spirit ship fleets organized by the major cultivators, and they seemed like a family. They were in harmony and sailed into the restricted sea area together...</p>

    <p>The sword master looked at this scene. The corner of his mouth finally couldn't help but twitch.</p>

    <p>He lived for thousands of years...</p>

    <p>This scene has been something I haven't seen for a long time.</p>
