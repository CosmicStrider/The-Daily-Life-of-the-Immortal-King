  <h1>Chapter 1381 3 women, 1 drama</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Flirting with his schoolgirl. Then observing Sun Rong's reaction. It seems to Zhuo Yi that it is indeed a very interesting thing.</p>

    <p>"Brother Zhuo Yi, I think your brother will lay off you in nine out of ten cases." Lord Diulei laughed helplessly, he could only use four words to describe Zhuo Yi's various behaviors, that is , lose (gan/喪) heart (de/心) sick (piao/病) crazy (liang/狂).</p>

    <p>"Don't worry. I'll be fine."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi smiled old-fashionedly.</p>

    <p>He estimated that the time was almost up, so he began to use his administrative rights to clear all the chat records in the group with one click.</p>

    <p>Not even a recording backup of the group call was left. Not the slightest trace was left for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling returned to the group. He saw that the group was empty. It was obvious that the meeting had ended. Out of boredom, he left a string of ellipses. Then he slipped away again.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi. Indeed, it has not been sanctioned.</p>

    <p>He calculates all time accurately...</p>

    <p>"..." In front of the screen. All the core members of the Office of Strategic Deception were stunned.</p>

    <p>I didn't expect this kind of operation exists.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>There was not much time left for Sun Rong. Without further ado, she decided to set off quickly with Miss Ajuan.</p>

    <p>Before leaving, Sun Rong wrapped Aohai's sword energy around his body to prevent accidents.</p>

    <p>Ajuan found the cautious reaction amusing: "Miss Sun, don't be so nervous. Your body has been blessed by a monk. There will be no problem even if you walk in space."</p>

    <p>Ajuan has already seen how powerful the monk's consecration technique is. Even if it is not as good as Wang Ling's enlightenment technique, the girl's current physical strength is still enough to move in space.</p>

    <p>"Lord Boundary King, you don't have to call me Miss Sun. Just call me Rongrong like Ying'er."</p>

    <p>"Okay! That's really too foreign. Then just call me Ajuan!"</p>

    <p>The two women looked at each other and smiled. Immediately, Ajuan took out a set of blue French skirts and said, "Rongrong, please put this outfit on!"</p>

    <p>"This is?"</p>

    <p>"A +0 anti-world level dress. It's not a valuable thing anyway." Ajuan said: "Although your body can now withstand the pressure of space, your clothes can't. With this anti-world level dress skirt. It's much more convenient."</p>

    <p>"Ah! This is so expensive!"Sun Rong was slightly surprised.</p>

    <p>She is in the Foundation Building stage. She can actually use an anti-realm magic weapon...</p>

    <p>His grandfather's ancestral stick didn't meet this standard either!</p>

    <p>"It's okay. You helped me a lot this time," Ajuan said.</p>

    <p>"But it's not done yet."Sun Rong was still a little embarrassed.</p>

    <p>"Take it. You don't have to be polite to me." Ajuan smiled.</p>

    <p>In fact, in her opinion, Sun Rong volunteered to go. This is already half the story...</p>

    <p>This is the character Ling Zhenren tried his best to protect.</p>

    <p>She's gone. Even if something goes wrong in the end, can Ling Zhenren still sit back and not take action?</p>

    <p>As a young King of the Divine Realm, Ajuan hated all of this.</p>

    <p>Besides, she is already the King of the God Realm!</p>

    <p>She can still get this thing.</p>

    <p>For high-level cultivators.</p>

    <p>If the anti-world magic weapon is not fused with the power of chaos, it will be just like a toy. In fact, there is not much difference.</p>

    <p>An anti-realm magic weapon that incorporates the power of chaos. That is a valuable thing.</p>

    <p>As for the "+0" mentioned by Ajuan, it is actually a standard for judging the power of chaos against boundary-level magic weapons.</p>

    <p>Taking 10% as the limit. For every 10% of the power of chaos that an anti-world-level magic weapon possesses, the level will be "+1."</p>

    <p>The larger the number, the more valuable the opponent-level magic weapon is.</p>

    <p>"Come Rongrong. I'll change it for you!"</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er looked at this beautiful blue dress with starry eyes on her face.</p>

    <p>She doesn't need to change clothes. Because Sun Rong changes clothes. Her own clothes will also change.</p>

    <p>However, this change is limited to changes in style. The colors are still mainly black, white and gray.</p>

    <p>This is the pain of being a shadow.</p>

    <p>The photos taken look like portraits...</p>

    <p>Therefore, learning to enjoy hardship is also a required course for a qualified shadow.</p>

    <p>This skirt is not a long skirt. The hem only reaches above the knees. When Sun Rong put on the skirt, she faced the custom-fitting dressing mirror in front of her, perfectly showing off a pair of slender, white legs.</p>

    <p>"Leg control is a blessing!" Sun Ying'er admired from the side.</p>

    <p>While helping Sun Rong zip up the back of her skirt, Sun Ying'er smirked and made a sneak attack on Sun Rong's chest muscles.</p>

    <p>"What are you doing Ying'er!"Sun Rong felt a little embarrassed about being touched.</p>

    <p>"It's not bad Rongrong. It doesn't look big, but it actually feels good in the hand." Sun Ying'er said with a smile, "I'm helping you get used to it in advance!"</p>

    <p>"What are you used to... talking nonsense again!" Sun Rong said angrily.</p>

    <p>But soon. Sun Rong's mood gradually returned to calm.</p>

    <p>Although Sun Ying'er has not been around her for a long time, her lively and naughty temperament. Sun Rong has been completely understood.</p>

    <p>Completely different styles from myself...</p>

    <p>She couldn't punish Sun Ying'er's behavior. But as the master, there were still ways to deal with Sun Ying'er. Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>After putting on the skirt, Sun Rong turned around in the mirror and said casually: "You... can't be like me. Be more dignified? You are so naughty. Be careful Master of Shadows to find someone else."</p>

    <p>When these words came out of his mouth, Sun Ying'er didn't have much reaction on his face: "Humph! Well, you can look for whoever you like! I don't care about it!"</p>

    <p>That's what Sun Ying'er said, but in fact, he was really panicking.</p>

    <p>She didn't know why she felt an uncomfortable feeling in her heart after hearing these words. It was as if there was a mouthful of blood in her chest that couldn't be released for a while.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er felt like she was becoming a little abnormal.</p>

    <p>Obviously that guy has done so many excessive things to himself...</p>

    <p>But when she thought about that guy really ignoring her in the future, she actually felt a sense of loss.</p>

    <p>Then. Sun Ying'er shut down at the speed of light. She turned into a black shadow again. She huddled up under Sun Rong's body...</p>

    <p>"Ying'er..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong thinks Sun Ying'er is really interesting. He can be scared so easily. It shows that his mind is still too simple.</p>

    <p>No wonder Wang Ying likes to "bully" her so much.</p>

    <p>"Then Ajuan, let's go." He was fully prepared. Sun Rong held Aohai tightly and said.</p>

    <p>Heavenly Dao's Rubik's Cubes have the ability to sense each other. Sun Rong thinks it may not be difficult to find the Rubik's Cube.</p>

    <p>When a Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube is fused into Aohai's body, the sword energy formed by Aohai is actually a pure natural radar!</p>

    <p>"Yeah! Let's go now!" Ajuan nodded.</p>

    <p>"What about Er Ha?"</p>

    <p>"It told me. Lord Ma will send it directly. We will meet outside the main city of God Realm." Miss Ajuan finished. Sun Rong saw glowing feathers in her room Float down.</p>

    <p>Immediately afterwards, a teleportation ring appeared on the carpet in the bedroom.</p>

    <p>"Let's go." Ajuan said.</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Rong noticed that Ajuan's appearance seemed to have changed: "Why the disguise?"</p>

    <p>"Hey. I am the Kaiou of the Divine Realm. Is there anyone on Heavenly Dao who doesn't know me? Those people have to kowtow three times when they see me. If I go there directly as a Kaiou, I won't be able to bear all the kowtows all the way! And it's too high-profile. It's not conducive to action!" Ajuan said.</p>
