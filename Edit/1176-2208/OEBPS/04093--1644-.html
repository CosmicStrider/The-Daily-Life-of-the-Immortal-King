  <h1>Chapter 1644 Historic Meeting</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Virtual Realm. A parts scrapyard outside the 10th Ring Road in the core area of Science and Technology City. Mountains of mechanical parts are piled here.</p>

    <p>Because you enter the Virtual Realm through different coordinate points.</p>

    <p>When Zhuo Yi and Zhou Ziyi came inside through the external barrier, they appeared directly at the current location.</p>

    <p>The place was filled with all kinds of mechanical parts. The damaged limbs emit a foul gasoline odor that blends into the air. As soon as he entered the place. Zhuo Yi immediately sealed his nostrils and those of Zhou Ziyi beside him. Breathing through the "Tortoise Breath Technique."</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi was stunned by the sight in front of her.</p>

    <p>This kind of scene only appears in post-apocalyptic science fiction blockbusters. It makes people feel unrealistic.</p>

    <p>He followed Zhuo Yi through several mechanical mountains.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, a mechanical hand came out of the gap on the side and grabbed Zhou Ziyi's trousers.</p>

    <p>The residual limb was not very strong, but something happened suddenly that frightened Zhou Ziyi.</p>

    <p>In comparison, Zhuo Yi indeed looked calm. Because he knew very well that there was nothing here that could hurt him.</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi's face turned red: "Brother Zhuo... I'm sorry. I..."</p>

    <p>"You probably haven't gone out to practice since you lost your legs. It's inevitable that you lack some experience. I was so frightened when I followed several seniors to practice in a secret place a long time ago." Zhuo Yi said with a smile.</p>

    <p>These words were his encouragement to Zhou Ziyi. They also made him feel like a master for the first time.</p>

    <p>He took a fancy to Zhou Ziyi and planned to take him under his wing. He not only recognized Zhou Ziyi's own character, but also planned to find a powerful successor for himself.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Zhuo Yi also wants to experience what it feels like to be a master.</p>

    <p>If he can touch it accurately, maybe he can understand Wang Ling better.</p>

    <p>Using the power of King's Eyes. Zhuo Yi conducted a carpet search from a God's perspective. A hologram related to the entire Virtual Realm appeared in his mind.</p>

    <p>It turns out that this is a science and technology city. A cultivation city based on mechanization...</p>

    <p>"Brother Zhuo? What are we going to do next?" Zhou Ziyi asked.</p>

    <p>Before he came to the secret world, he was full of confidence. But after arriving at a new and unfamiliar environment. The sense of horror and mystery from the unknown instantly made Zhou Ziyi feel that his mind was blank. He didn't know what to do.</p>

    <p>In fact, this is not a problem that only occurs in Zhou Ziyi.</p>

    <p>Most newbies in the world of cultivation are like this.</p>

    <p>Under the current systematic model of compulsory cultivation education, before going to university, unless there is a very special opportunity.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, under normal circumstances, almost no monks before university have the experience of independently exploring secret realms. Most of them follow the large troops and act together under the protection and organization of the school instructors.</p>

    <p>There is strength in numbers. Naturally, you won't feel scared even if you change places.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi always thought that it was not called secret exploration in the strict sense.</p>

    <p>It's called Spring Outing and Autumn Outing...</p>

    <p>On the contrary, the fewer people there are, the more uneasy it will be.</p>

    <p>"Ziyi, you don't need to be afraid. What you are wearing now is very strong armor. Why, you still don't believe what I said?" Zhuo Yi laughed.</p>

    <p>"I believe..."</p>

    <p>The hell with that!</p>

    <p>Thermal underwear... how can it be so strong!</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi scratched his head.</p>

    <p>Although Zhuo Yi had already told him about the power of thermal underwear before coming here.</p>

    <p>But he really didn't believe it all.</p>

    <p>Because it's too outrageous...</p>

    <p>Although he is now wearing five layers of long johns, he visually looks fatter. But what makes Zhou Ziyi feel amazing is that he does not feel uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>This thermal underwear seems to fit the human body. It also has a temperature control system that can adjust the body's temperature to the most suitable state.</p>

    <p>It's such a comfortable thermal underwear. It's soft and considerate. It doesn't look hard at all!</p>

    <p>How can we withstand a fierce attack... This is not scientific at all!</p>

    <p>"Oh, yeah. You'll see how powerful this thing is when you put it to use." Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>After all, this 3.0 version of the customized Autumn Coat and Autumn Pants is Wang Ling's handiwork. Who'd have thought that a customized Autumn Pants would be a dozen times more powerful than the Chaos Armor on Dao Ancestor Wang's " Zheng?"</p>

    <p>And now these five pieces of thermal underwear are stacked together like a nesting doll. Although it caused Zhou Ziyi to be slightly bloated like a Michelin tire. But now Zhou Ziyi's armor is stacked up! No one can hurt him!</p>

    <p>He wasn't in a hurry.</p>

    <p>But this time he brought Zhou Ziyi here. He was looking for opportunities to take Zhou Ziyi to take off...</p>

    <p>It is true that this Master Wu Xin is an eternal level powerhouse.</p>

    <p>But if Zhou Ziyi can be allowed to kill this eternal powerhouse...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi feels that the qualifications to join the sect are more than enough.</p>

    <p>He has been lying down and winning for so long. He understands the essence of lying down and winning.</p>

    <p>It's just that Zhuo Yi didn't expect that one day, he would take the apprentice he wanted to take on and make arrangements for this future apprentice to win...</p>

    <p>He randomly picked up two mechanical stumps of his hands from the garbage mountain. He used the recovery ability of King's Eyes to scan them.</p>

    <p>Then Zhou Ziyi saw that the two mechanical stumps turned into golden light particles in Zhuo Yi's hands. They formed a holographic scene in the air, reorganized and reorganized, and then quickly materialized.</p>

    <p>This is King's Eyes' {Repairing Light·Home Appliances Edition}. It is specially used to repair mechanical products. Zhuo Yi just wanted to give it a try. Unexpectedly, it actually came in handy.</p>

    <p>It took less than two seconds. Two brand new mechanical limbs appeared in Zhuo Yi's hands.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the two of them exclaimed in unison.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi marveled in his heart: "It turns out that the intact robotic arm looks like this."</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi was amazed: "There is such an operation!!!"</p>

    <p>Realizing Zhou Ziyi's surprised look, Zhuo Yi immediately couldn't help but laugh: "Don't be too surprised. It's just an ordinary trick."</p>

    <p>After reorganizing his thoughts, Zhou Ziyi said: "Brother Zhuo, since these are all semi-mechanized cultivators, wouldn't it be better for us to also replace them with mechanical limbs?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi nodded: "Smart. But at your current level, your spiritual power is not enough for the Zhuo Yi technique to replace limbs. Even if you learn this technique, I'm afraid the duration of disintegration will not exceed Ten seconds."</p>

    <p>"Then... what should we do?"</p>

    <p>"It's very simple. Just use illusion." The next second, Zhuo Yi activated the ability to share King's Eyes. He projected the two robotic arms he had just recovered on himself and Zhou Ziyi in the form of illusion.</p>

    <p>When Zhou Ziyi saw that his right hand suddenly turned into a metal robotic arm, he was shocked: "It's amazing! It's like a new layer of skin..."</p>

    <p>"That way you'll be safe."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi held his chin and said: "But this Virtual Realm is already in another country. I guess the currency used is different from what we usually use."</p>

    <p>Different from other secret realms, this secret realm has these mechanized indigenous monks and has its own civilization.</p>

    <p>So wherever there are people, there must be all kinds of sales and transactions.</p>

    <p>And through the holographic scene map fed back by King's Eyes. Zhuo Yi also saw the most central, resplendent core area.</p>

    <p>So how to enter there as a legal aboriginal without alerting the enemy is the key to the problem.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi Judgment. If they want to travel here unhindered, they must have enough money.</p>

    <p>So at this moment, facing the huge and sparsely populated parts scrapyard in front of me, Zhuo Yi discovered an opportunity to make a fortune...</p>

    <p>"Ziyi. Go pick up some more parts that look usable." Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>He possesses the pupil technique of {Repairing Light·Household Appliances Version}. He can turn waste into treasure, buy and resell, and that's it.</p>

    <p>"good!"</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi understood it clearly. He could guess what Zhuo Yi wanted to do almost immediately.</p>

    <p>But just as Zhou Ziyi was preparing to take action, a tall young man with fair skin suddenly appeared in front of them.</p>

    <p>He was wearing casual clothes and had neat bangs. When he approached them, he seemed to be able to feel the sunshine radiating from his body.</p>

    <p>"Brother, you don't seem to be from here." Zhuo Yi frowned.</p>

    <p>"I... It's true that I'm not... but aren't you the same, right?" The young man smiled.</p>

    <p>"Who are you?" Zhuo Yi's eyes dimmed immediately.</p>

    <p>This young man with unknown origins in front of him could actually see through the illusion of King's Eyes? This made him feel incredible...</p>

    <p>"Sorry, sorry. I didn't eavesdrop on your conversation on purpose. I fell into this secret realm accidentally." At this time, the young man lazily raised his hands in a gesture of surrender.</p>

    <p>So you overheard us...</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>"So I just want to ask, where is this place? I heard you say it seems to be a secret place? Have you heard of Beiyan City? I came from there," the young man said.</p>

    <p>"Bei Yan?" Zhuo Yi was stunned.</p>

    <p>Then he raised his head and looked at the person in front of him: "As far as I know, our country of Huaxiu does not have a city called Beiyan..."</p>

    <p>"Huaxiu country?"</p>

    <p>Listen here. The young man froze. He stroked his chin in a thoughtful manner. His mouth muttered, "Dammit... Did I fall into a different dimension?"</p>

    <p>"This brother. Don't you want to explain who you are? I feel that this is a very rude behavior." Zhuo Yi remained vigilant. He felt that the young man in front of him had an indescribable strange feeling.</p>

    <p>And the main thing is that the opponent has a good fighting ability.</p>

    <p>Although the young man did not deliberately release his spiritual energy.</p>

    <p>But through King's Eyes. Zhuo Yi, one can clearly see that the spiritual energy in this young man's body is as vast as the sea... almost comparable to Dao God.</p>

    <p>"Then in exchange, after I finish speaking, I also hope you will tell me who you are."</p>

    <p>The young man smiled gently. Then he extended his hand to Zhuo Yi. He heard Zhou Ziyi call Zhuo Yi "Zhuo" earlier. So he followed suit and said, "Hello, Zhuo. My surname is Qin. My name is Qin Zong. The Qin of Qin Shu and Chu Tian. The Zong of Zongheng."</p>

    <p>"Qin... Zhong?" The name made Zhuo Yi freeze.</p>

    <p>He felt like he'd heard it somewhere before.</p>

    <p>At this moment. Zhuo Yi doesn't realize it yet.</p>

    <p>But it was a historic meeting...</p>
