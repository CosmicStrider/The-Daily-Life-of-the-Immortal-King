  <h1>Chapter 2013 What's in the Black Forest of Wang Ling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling was too close. Just right next to her. Although not touching to her, it was enough to make Sun Rong feel dizzy.</p>

    <p>She was obviously trying hard not to fall down by relying on her mental willpower. As a result, Wang Ling's sudden approach made her almost unable to hold back and faint on the spot.</p>

    <p>The black forest ahead brought endless pressure. Wang Ling knew that it was caused by him, so he was very patient. Sun Rong just holding on and not fainting seemed to Wang Ling's already a miracle. If he push it any further, it would be a bit rude.</p>

    <p>As long as they can catch up with the special offer of limited-edition crispy noodles, it will be fine. Wang Ling estimated the time. It is more than enough to help Sun Rong break through to the early stage of Golden Core before the special offer.</p>

    <p>He hugged his knees and waited for Sun Rong to regain her strength. During the whole process, Sun Rong did not use the passive ability of Aohai's human-sword unity. Because in this way, if she had no pressure at all, she can't exercise her basic level.</p>

    <p>You have to rely purely on your own willpower to survive this practice. This is the important point of entering the mountain of retrospection this time.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling. I feel better..."</p>

    <p>After the two of them stayed in place for nearly ten minutes, Sun Rong's pale little face finally became filled with normal blood color.</p>

    <p>Obviously, her condition has recovered a lot.</p>

    <p>This is because Wang Ling was around to help share most of the pressure. When you enter the black forest, the overwhelming spiritual pressure is terrifying.</p>

    <p>"Yeah." Wang Ling nodded. Then he put his hands into his trouser pockets again and walked slowly towards the black forest.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong followed Wang Ling. Close to the heel. The closer to the black forest, the spiritual pressure from inside the black forest became more and more fierce.</p>

    <p>Then, the girl's body began to tremble uncontrollably. Although it could be seen that she was already trying hard to resist with her mental willpower, but in the face of the huge pressure of the black forest, everything was like a knee-jerk reaction to the impact on her knees. It's purely a conditioned reflex of the body.</p>

    <p>This was something she could not survive with her willpower at all.</p>

    <p>Even if Wang Ling was by her side, the great pressure and fear still caused her face to gradually lose the color it had just after regaining strength. It became gradually pale. The most important thing was that even her legs began to feel unbearable and shivered.</p>

    <p>It was as if there was a pair of big hands in the dark pressing her shoulders all the time, asking her to kneel down.</p>

    <p>Still not working?...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw everything in his eyes and said secretly in his heart.</p>

    <p>After all, this is the huge pressure of the Black Forest. Let alone Sun Rong. Even if it were someone else, they would have collapsed before they were was close to the Black Forest.</p>

    <p>So why does Sun Rong have such firm willpower?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling became infinitely curious.</p>

    <p>Then soon, his slightly frowned brow began to relax.</p>

    <p>It was just a moment. Wang Ling gradually understood everything.</p>

    <p>He understands it all!</p>

    <p>"Sun Rong..."</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling spoke.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong responded weakly: "What's going on?"</p>

    <p>"Are you going to buy the special items too?" Wang Ling asked.</p>

    <p>"..." The expression on Sun Rong's face suddenly turned into confusion.</p>

    <p>She didn't know why Wang Ling suddenly asked this inappropriate question.</p>

    <p>But looking at the expression on the young man's face that he knew everything. Her momentary hesitation actually made Wang Ling thinks that this was the correct answer.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was moved.</p>

    <p>He discovered that Sun Rong had really changed.</p>

    <p>Not only did she learn to restrain himself from showing off her eye-catching personality in the past, but she also began to learn to be thrifty.</p>

    <p>She is obviously the eldest daughter of the Huaguo Shuilian Group and is extremely wealthy, so she would actually consider buying special offers.</p>

    <p>This gives Wang Ling even more confidence.</p>

    <p>Whether he gave Sun Rong the nine-core Aohai. Or now he helped Sun Rong break through to the early stages of Golden Core practice. Wang Ling feels that everything is reasonable.</p>

    <p>Those people who have always been helped by Wang Ling. For example, his disciple Zhuo Yi. Or his good brothers Lord Diulei, Immortal Toya! They all have good personalities and moral qualities.</p>

    <p>This is the key for Wang Ling to decide whether to help or not.</p>

    <p>Even Chen Chao and Guo Hao are the classmates with whom he has had the best relationship in Number 60 High School. It was only after Wang Ling went through all aspects of investigation that they decided to help them arrange a reliable master to help them. Improved through practice.</p>

    <p>"Let's go together."</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling looked at Sun Rong again.</p>

    <p>His eyes were as calm as water. There was no wave in his eyes.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Sun Rong felt a sudden pulling force from her hands. It actually pulled her directly onto Wang Ling's arm.</p>

    <p>Although se don't know what happened, this sudden scene really made Sun Rong feel unexpected.</p>

    <p>Specials...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong kept repeating the question Wang Ling just asked herself.</p>

    <p>So let her hold hands and walk together. Is it a condition?</p>

    <p>Do you mean to help buy a certain special product after this practice is over?</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Rong also began to suddenly understand. She showed an expression that she gradually understood everything.</p>

    <p>She knows Wang Ling's personality. There are specials that Wang Ling can talk about over and over again. What else... Naturally, limited-flavor crispy noodles!</p>

    <p>So. Sun Rong understood instantly.</p>

    <p>Completely understand!</p>

    <p>But it's just a special offer of limited-edition crispy noodles!</p>

    <p>She just buys it!</p>

    <p>After all, compared to this, she can hold Wang Ling's hand and move forward together. This business is not a loss at all!</p>

    <p>The two of them moved forward. At this time, Jingke's voice sounded in Sun Rong's mind again.</p>

    <p>"Sister Rongrong, are you ready? The black forest is ahead."</p>

    <p>The black forest in front of them was so close. Sun Rong never expected that she could persist to this point.</p>

    <p>If it weren't for holding Wang Ling's arm, she would have fainted.</p>

    <p>Now she has Wang Ling supporting her. Today is different from the past. Sun Rong has a firm gaze. She has unprecedented self-confidence: "Come on! I'm not afraid!"</p>

    <p>Even standing at the entrance of the black forest at this moment. Sun Rong is a little curious about what is in the black forest of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>However, after just entering the black forest and walking a few steps, Sun Rong suddenly felt a strong sense of crisis. There were two small human-faced brontosaurus, the same size as the Siberian tiger, wandering nearby. After feeling that someone had entered, They immediately roared. There were faint signs of launching an offensive.</p>

    <p>Human-Faced Thunder Dragon. This is a strange spiritual beast born in the black forest... it does not really exist in this world of cultivation.</p>

    <p>Of course, the birth of this strange spiritual beast was also because Wang Ling's overly powerful spiritual energy distorted the power of creating creatures in the Mountain of Recall. Therefore, this violent and deformed product was produced.</p>

    <p>"Why do I feel... this human-faced brontosaurus looks a bit familiar?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong murmured in her heart. There was a bit of confusion on her expression.</p>

    <p>Soon she remembered who this human-faced thunder dragon was thinking of.</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe!</p>

    <p>Right!</p>

    <p>This is the person!</p>

    <p>The biggest enemy that Wang Ling is currently dealing with! The Bai Zhe who transformed into the leader of the dragon clan, Moonlight Dragon!</p>

    <p>Each of these human-faced Brontosaurus faces looks exactly like that of Bai!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked calmly at the human-faced Brontosaurus that was flanking him from both sides. There was no emotion in his heart. It was just a look. The Human-Faced Brontosaurus that was roaring one second the next second they fell to the ground like a drowned dog, screaming in pain.</p>

    <p>Then. Wang Ling made a pistol gesture with his fingers and designed towards the two human-faced Brontosaurus.</p>

    <p>Bang! Bang!</p>

    <p>Two crisp gunshots followed. As two psychic bullets landed on the human-faced brontosaurus, the skin and flesh of the two human-faced brontosauruses were torn to pieces on the spot.</p>

    <p>But they did not die directly. Instead, they were in a dying state.</p>

    <p>This was done intentionally by Wang Ling. He deliberately spared the lives of the two human-faced Brontosaurus. Then he looked at Sun Rong who was holding his arm.</p>

    <p>Only then did Sun Rong understand.</p>

    <p>This means that I have to step forward to make up the final blow...</p>
