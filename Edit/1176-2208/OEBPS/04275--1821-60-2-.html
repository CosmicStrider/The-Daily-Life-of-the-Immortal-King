  <h1>Chapter 1821 The other 2 groups out of 60</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This result was something that Mrs. Lawen had never imagined. She set up the secret room. She originally intended to use this design to bring out the dark side of these young people's hearts.</p>

    <p>Lawen has always believed that watching variety shows that are friendly is not that interesting. It is more interesting to watch variety shows that are about intrigues and pulling out each other's hair.</p>

    <p>However, all of this turned into a cloud as the team Wang Ling and Sun Rong took the lead in breaking the secret room.</p>

    <p>She didn't know if it's an illusion. Mrs. Lawen felt like there was an invisible electric drill that she couldn't see. Otherwise, it would be impossible to explain why Wang Ling and Sun Rong could break through the secret room so easily.</p>

    <p>"Do you want to get tested? I feel like something is wrong." A program producer questioned.</p>

    <p>"No need... let's do this for now." Mrs. Lawen said, holding her forehead.</p>

    <p>She now has reason to believe that this was caused by the three buttons she pressed earlier.</p>

    <p>If this invisible electric drill really came from the hands of the seniors she summoned, then it is obvious that the purpose of this invisible electric drill from the beginning was to go to Wang Ling and Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>But it's a pity that there was a mistake...</p>

    <p>As a result, the electric drill directly helped the group Wang Ling and Sun Rong break through the secret room.</p>

    <p>This is the attack of the Eternal One!</p>

    <p>They were actually being hidden by two high school students?</p>

    <p>Mrs. Lawen's eyes widened. She felt extremely unbelievable... She felt that she had underestimated the name of Wang Ling, the mascot of Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The huge movement alerted everyone in the surrounding secret rooms. Li Youyue and Fang Xing were in the secret room. Fang Xing, who seemed to have been waiting for a signal, suddenly opened his eyes.</p>

    <p>"It seems that it's time to take action." Fang Xing said. The expression on his face revealed a kind of calmness and confidence.</p>

    <p>When she and Fang Xing were locked up together, to be honest, Li Youyue felt that Fang Xing was a bit strange. He was a bit unlike the man she knew in the class who was full of sunshine and always had a smile on his face.</p>

    <p>Compared to his usual appearance, Fang Xing's body at this time exuded more of a sense of mystery that filled his every move. It was unfathomable.</p>

    <p>Before, Li Youyue had always thought that Fang Xing was silent because he was looking for a way out of trouble. But unexpectedly, after hearing this noise, Fang Xing stood up on the spot as if he had received some signal.</p>

    <p>He stretched out his index finger, with a strategizing posture, when a white spiritual energy bloomed from the fingertips.</p>

    <p>There was a buzz! His index finger turned into a small steel snake. It drilled directly into the keyhole.</p>

    <p>Li Youyue looked a little confused: "Fang Xing... what kind of spell are you doing???"</p>

    <p>Fang Xing smiled to himself: "It's just some tricks I learned from my father. It's not worth mentioning."</p>

    <p>"So that's it." Li Youyue nodded: "Although we are in the same class, I feel like I'm meeting you for the first time today."</p>

    <p>"Do you feel this way?" Fang Xing smiled awkwardly. He didn't look away. He was still concentrating on the unlocking work using his own method.</p>

    <p>"Yes. I feel that you are a little different from the usual you. But I can't put it in words. You feel more attractive like this."</p>

    <p>Li Youyue laughed. She couldn't help but gossip: "But you usually receive a lot of love letters. I don't have to worry about you as much as I do Rongrong."</p>

    <p>"Yes." Fang Xing nodded. He hesitated before speaking. Then he said, "Actually... I also have someone I care about very much."</p>

    <p>"The person you care about? The kind you like?"</p>

    <p>"I don't know." Fang Xing thought for a moment, shook his head and replied, "I don't know either. Is this a liking. Or a kind of gratitude. Or maybe it's an illusion of being conquered by that kind of personality charm."</p>

    <p>"Indeed. If you don't confirm what you really feel, directly confessing your feelings may be harmful to both of you." Li Youyue, who has studied love science and is dedicated to playing the role of matchmaker, helped Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>In fact, she rarely talked to Fang Xing at all when she was in class. She didn't expect that during this event, Fang Xing would actually talk to her about such things.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, participating in competitions and team building together is really helpful to enhance the emotional bond between each other!</p>

    <p>Fang Xing deliberately slowed down his movements. While unlocking the door, he asked: "Besides, I found out that I also like another friend of mine. I have never had the habit of trying to steal people's favor, so until now I don't know what to do."</p>

    <p>"Do you think the two of them are capable?"</p>

    <p>"Maybe..."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing smiled bitterly: "If you are really with me, maybe there will be no results."</p>

    <p>After hearing these words, Li Youyue's thoughts became quite confused. She felt that Fang Xing's situation... seemed to be far more complicated than Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry for telling you all these irrelevant things."</p>

    <p>After about ten seconds, Fang Xing suddenly said: "The lock has been opened. I think we can go out. I hope you can keep it a secret for me. Don't tell anyone."</p>

    <p>"Okay... I understand." Li Youyue nodded.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, on the other side, Chen Chao and Guo Hao were also struggling with the lock. They had tried various methods within their capabilities, but they had never been able to break through the shackles.</p>

    <p>"Guo... If it doesn't work, just use a saw to cut off my hand." Chen Chao said, looking ready to die heroically.</p>

    <p>"Chen Chao. Just listen to me. It's not like that. It's just a variety show. It's not the real Saw!" Guo Hao said, dumbfounded: "There's always a way."</p>

    <p>"We won't be the last ones, right? I just seemed to hear something from Wang Ling and Fang Xing... It's not shameful to be the last one in Number 60 High School. If even the people from Glio City Even high school students can't compare. That would be so embarrassing!"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao gritted his teeth. He felt a surge of blood in his body: "I don't want to be the last one!"</p>

    <p>Then he looked at Guo Hao: "Don't you have many uncles? In this variety show, there is no uncle of yours? You can just ask him to help us unlock the door."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao laughed angrily at these words: "What are you thinking... How could there be my uncle here? Having said that, asking people from the show to help unlock the door. Doesn't this really count as cheating?"</p>

    <p>The words just fell.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao, Guo Hao suddenly heard a sound like a key falling on the ground in the extremely quiet secret room.</p>

    <p>A gleaming key seemed to be thrown through the cracks in the secret room. It landed directly at Chen Chao's feet.</p>

    <p>"It's the key!" Chen Chao became excited.</p>

    <p>There was more than just a key. Chen Chao found that there was a ribbon tied behind the key.</p>

    <p>Using the light provided by the fingertip fireball technique, the two of them saw clearly the words written on the ribbon: "Nephew, uncle is here to save you! Use the key to open the lock!"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "?"</p>
