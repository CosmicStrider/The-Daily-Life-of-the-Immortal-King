  <h1>Chapter 1746 Boss Sun's little thoughts</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Mu Yu is a homonym given to Wang Muyu by Sun Rong. At first, Sun Rong discovered this name when she was typing Wang Muyu's name using the Jiugongge input method. She suddenly felt that calling him Mu Yu seemed more lovely, and she kept calling him that.</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>("木魚" Mùyú Wooden Fish and "木宇" Mùyǔ Wood Room.)</dfn>

    <p>In the Office of Strategic Deception, Wang Muyu's appearance was definitely a big surprise to everyone. Some people called him a little kid. Others followed Sun Rong and called him Muyu or Little Muyu.</p>

    <p>Generally speaking, everyone is very polite to Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>Everyone discovered that when Wang Muyu put away the colorful dragon horns and tail these days, his face looked more like Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>Of course. The reason why everyone is so polite is not just because he looks very similar to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>It's because most people have discovered that.</p>

    <p>They aren't as strong as Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>As the rumors say, Boss Sun and Wang Muyu are getting along very well these days. The more Sun Yiyuan looks at Wang Muyu, the more he likes him.</p>

    <p>This is especially true since Wang Muyu refined the "Seven Dragon Balls."</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan still remembered when the "Seven Dragon Balls" were made. The entire alchemy furnace was filled with rays of light and auspicious colors. The overflowing spiritual energy instantly filled the entire alchemy room. Sun Yiyuan was shocked.</p>

    <p>When it comes to alchemy, there is actually a certain amount of luck involved in whether it is successful or not!</p>

    <p>He never thought that a six-year-old child could be so talented!</p>

    <p>As expected of...the younger brother of classmate Wang Ling! He is indeed a born mascot!</p>

    <p>Later, Sun Yiyuan evaluated these seven elixirs and found that each of these seven elixirs actually reached the top level!</p>

    <p>And among the elixirs, there is actually a special unknown substance!</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan cut off a small part of the elixir for experimentation. According to the experimental results, this unknown substance is a spiritual energy amplifying substance. After taking it, spiritual energy can be greatly increased. It has a powerful effect in helping cultivators break through bottlenecks. And it is extremely powerful. It is more effective than any other elixir of the same type currently on the market.</p>

    <p>For a cultivator, the most painful thing is to stay in the same state for a long time without being able to improve. If this elixir can be mass-produced in the future, it will be of great benefit to the development of Huaguo Shuilian Group!</p>

    <p>"Little Mu Yu, you did a good job!" Sun Yiyuan was very happy. He immediately decided to name this new elixir "Qilong Muyu Pill."</p>

    <p>Looking back at Wang Muyu, he obviously didn't have much awareness of his normal performance and normal operations. He just looked at the seven golden elixirs in front of him with an innocent face.</p>

    <p>"Little Muyu, what reward do you want? Grandpa can reward you." Sun Yiyuan touched the head of the Little Mu Yu and said.</p>

    <p>Then, Wang Muyu stared at the elixir in front of him, held his little hands together, slowly closed his eyes, and made a wishing gesture.</p>

    <p>"Muyu? What are you thinking about?"</p>

    <p>"I'm making a wish."</p>

    <p>"Oh? What wish do you want?"</p>

    <p>"I hope my father and mother will spend more time with me." Wang Muyu said.</p>

    <p>That pitiful and soft voice almost instantly broke Sun Yiyuan's guard.</p>

    <p>The most unbearable thing for the elderly is to be moved.</p>

    <p>The older you get, the lower the tear point becomes.</p>

    <p>Why...</p>

    <p>Why can there be such a cute and sensible little guy in this world!</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan was so moved that he covered his face and burst into tears.</p>

    <p>At this time, he suddenly realized that he actually did not regard Wang Muyu as an outsider at all. Instead, he truly regarded Wang Muyu as his little grandson and loved him.</p>

    <p>"Muyu, you will definitely have many, many people who will love you in the future." He picked up Wang Muyu and kissed him gently on his pink cheek.</p>

    <p>The stubble swept over it, and it made Wang Muyu feel a little itchy: "Ah ha ha ha. It's so itchy. Grandpa."</p>

    <p>As a result, Sun Yiyuan felt his heart melted instantly...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Overall, Wang Muyu is a very lovable child. At least that is what the people who have been in contact with Wang Muyu so far think.</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan was very happy.</p>

    <p>And he didn't mind being tired at all, no matter what kind of request Wang Muyu made, he would try his best to fulfill it. What kind of bad heart could the little Mu Yu have? He is only a six year old child, and even his father and mother are not yet fully clear, how adorable ah! Just as Sun Yiyuan did when he first met Wang Ling, the more he saw of Wang Muyu, the more he liked him.</p>

    <p>Of course. Like it, you like it. In addition to taking Wang Muyu with him, Mr. Boss Sun also does not forget to carry out his own mission secretly.</p>

    <p>Since Wang Muyu is the younger brother of Wang Ling, whether he is a cousin, a cousin, or a relative, he must know something about Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>In the first few days when he took Wang Muyu with him, he couldn't bear to ask any more questions. Now as the relationship between him and Wang Muyu gradually warmed up, Sun Yiyuan felt that he had reached the most appropriate time to ask questions.</p>

    <p>"Um, Muyu? What kind of person do you think Wang Ling brother...oh no. I should say, your Wang Ling father." said Sun Yiyuan.</p>

    <p>"He is a good man." Wang Muyu said: "And he is really powerful! He can kill a dragon with one palm!"</p>

    <p>"Really?" Sun Yiyuan touched his chin and was trying to figure out the meaning of Wang Muyu's words.</p>

    <p>Can Wang Ling kill a dragon with one palm?</p>

    <p>What does this mean?</p>

    <p>It shouldn't be literal... Where can there be dragons in this world?</p>

    <p>And as we all know, Wang Ling is a mascot. How could he be so strong? How could he really kill a dragon?</p>

    <p>So Sun Yiyuan immediately determined what kind of game Wang Muyu was talking about...</p>

    <p>Combined with Wang Ling's excellent performance in the arcade, it seems reasonable that Wang Ling has multiple labels of being "good at playing games."</p>

    <p>So that's it.</p>

    <p>Classmate Wang Ling likes to play games, right?</p>

    <p>This is useful information.</p>

    <p>He felt that it was necessary for him to personally issue a director's order in the future to all major game companies that cooperate with him. Monitor Wang Ling's game account in real time. As long as it is a game played by Wang Ling, no matter what game gift package it is, click the card They all have to be delivered at once! And that's not all. Sun Yiyuan also thinks that for those card games, Wang Ling should also be given privileges.</p>

    <p>For example, the probability of getting a gold card for a normal account is 1%. For Wang Ling, it is 99% or something...</p>

    <p>After getting useful intelligence clues, Sun Yiyuan nodded with satisfaction. He hugged Wang Muyu again and asked, "So, Mu Yu, what do you think sister Sun Rong ...... oh no, I should say your mother Sun Rong, what does she think of your father Wang Ling?"</p>

    <p>"Hahaha. Mom is only thinking about daddy. Otherwise, she wouldn't have been able to give birth to me." Wang Muyu replied with a smile.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>While Sun Yiyuan was thinking about Wang Muyu's answer, Jiang Xiaoche, who was about to push the door in at the door of the chairman's office, heard the conversation and was completely petrified...</p>
