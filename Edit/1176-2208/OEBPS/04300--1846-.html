  <h1>Chapter 1846 Wang Ling's divine reflection/92)</h1>

  <div>

    <p>There are a total of forty-nine pairs of pupils placed in the display cabinet. This is the variable of Dao. Each pupil is born from Dao. It has completely different abilities and can perfectly function in different situations.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was cautious after all. He didn't want King's Eyes to be damaged due to deciphering the mysterious text, so he decided to change the pupils before deciphering.</p>

    <p>All the eye pupils in the Shenhu showcase have their own serial numbers. Among them, King's Eyes is ranked 49th.</p>

    <p>But now, he directly chose eye pupil Number 01.</p>

    <p>"Dao Number 01: The cunning peeping evil eye. The appearance is orange + green aurora color. The pupils are star-shaped. It has the ability to identify all cunning people and cunning things. It can also use the power of cunning for its own use. Use an illusion to blind an object."</p>

    <p>Introduction to all gods. Wang Ling knows them all.</p>

    <p>The reason why he chose Dao Number 01 is entirely because this is a pair of very powerful illusions. It is very deceptive. Maybe he can directly decipher the content of these mysterious texts without paying attention.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't think much after installing it. He just stared at the mysterious words on the jade tube. After reading it repeatedly for five or six minutes, he suddenly closed the jade tube. Then there was a bang. Orange Green eye paste splashed. Dao Number 01 actually exploded on the spot like a beef eye from a barbecue stall.</p>

    <p>"This..."</p>

    <p>The Skeleton Prince, the Lion-headed Man and Meng Liuli all looked horrified at the same time. They never expected to see such a horrifying scene.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling seemed to have known about this situation for a long time. He was extremely calm.</p>

    <p>He used the primer technique to close the burst eye pulp again. Then he took off the Number 01 eyeball and put it back in the display cabinet.</p>

    <p>The Divine Display Cabinet has the effect of repairing eye pupils. However, the damage to eyeball Number 01 was too serious. I am afraid it will take several years to return to its peak.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed inwardly. Sure enough, his cautious idea was right. If he uses King's Eyes directly, if it is damaged... it will mean that his combat effectiveness will be compromised in a sense. Instead, it will be used by some evil people. They can take advantage of this opportunity to deal with him.</p>

    <p>King's Eyes is located at Number 49 Dao. Although it can be repaired after being damaged, it can be placed in a display cabinet in Shenzhou. But he didn't know how long it will take to repair King's Eyes...</p>

    <p>The farther back the serial number is, the longer the repair time will be.</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling's behavior of choosing his pupils to decipher {Dongda's diary} was also a test of Dongda's own strength.</p>

    <p>He could see the strangeness in this {Diary of the Eastern Emperor}. Since this was an emperor-level figure who had commanded a party of Eternals, his strength must be extraordinary. And it was far higher than these Eternals of the royal family. By several levels.</p>

    <p>The other party is familiar with the mysterious text and wrote the diary in the mysterious text. This is also a sign of extreme confidence in his own strength. It shows that the other party is not afraid of others seeing the diary. And even if they see the diary, they cannot decipher it.</p>

    <p>To put it bluntly, even if it is really deciphered, it is normal to use the emperor's ability to set some magic traps inside.</p>

    <p>For example, Wang Ling just used Dao Number 01 to forcefully test it, and suffered a backlash from a spell trap.</p>

    <p>Generally speaking, this situation can only mean that the eyes used by Wang Ling do not have the ability to directly decipher the diary and compete with the spell traps hidden in the diary.</p>

    <p>Therefore, for the second time, Wang Ling directly chose Dao Number 16. This directly raised the level of the eye pupils by one level.</p>

    <p>"Dao Number 16 Pupil: The dazzling Holy Eye of the Dark Forest. The appearance is black and white. The center pupil color is pure white. It has the ability to detect and attack unknown civilizations. When the unknown civilization tries to cause damage to the Holy Eye. The Holy Eye It will exert its greatest power and counterattack."</p>

    <p>After silently reciting the details of Number 16, Wang Ling thought that under the King's Eyes, these eyes should be the most suitable for deciphering the mysterious text. After all, in the understanding of most cultivators, the mysterious text belongs to an unknown civilization.</p>

    <p>Now Emperor Dongda has written a mysterious text and placed a trap in it. So as long as the Holy Eye is harmed... the defense mechanism will be directly triggered. The mysterious text can be absorbed instantly and the hidden meaning can be analyzed.</p>

    <p>Follow the previous steps. Wang Ling continues to stare at the jade cylinder. This time, the mysterious text of {Dongda Diary} recorded on the jade cylinder did not cause any harm to Dao Number 16.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling could clearly feel that the mysterious writings on these jade tubes were floating out of the jade tubes like feathers.</p>

    <p>Then... it was floating all over the sky.</p>

    <p>"It seems to have been successful." Meng Liuli looked surprised and curious. She was also extremely interested in the contents of the "Diary of the Eastern Emperor." She didn't know what was written in it.</p>

    <p>But at this time, Wang Ling was in a state as if he was completely immersed in the world of {Dongda Diary}. There was no response to the call from the outside world.</p>

    <p>The crimson crescent moon hangs high in the sky, illuminating the silent city on an alien land in front of us. Steel fortresses made of dark iron rise one after another, like hills.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't expect that Dao Number 16 could actually bring such an immersive experience after analyzing the mysterious text of {The Diary of the Eastern Emperor}.</p>

    <p>Yes.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Ling had his soul transfered, has become the appearance of the Eastern Emperor from the Eternal Period. He begins to play the role of the Eastern Emperor in this diary.</p>

    <p>At the same time, this is also the first time that Wang Ling has seen the appearance of the ancient world of cultivation of the eons. He once thought that the ancient world of cultivation should be the simplest civilization, full of all kinds of wild beasts, unexplored areas, and terrifying secret realms. There are also primitive tribes where a hundred schools of thought contend...</p>

    <p>It wasn't until this moment that Wang Ling discovered that cultivators from the Eternal Period had already built buildings similar to modern civilization on alien planets. This is a world where ancient and modern times are intertwined and mixed. There are traces of modern architecture. At the same time, they also retain It has the grandeur of ancient buildings.</p>

    <p>So from ancient times to the present, it is not evolution, but it indicates a continuation?</p>

    <p>Or maybe it's a reincarnation?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was thoughtful.</p>

    <p>The Eastern Emperor's Palace still retains the majestic appearance of the imperial city. Wang Ling stood at the top of the city. The beacon fire behind him made half of his face red in the night.</p>

    <p>The dark golden robe is embroidered with a red bird pattern. The wide and long sleeves are fluttering high in the strong wind. His sword are flying. Emperor Dongda on the Great Wall has his hands behind his back. He exudes a kingly aura that intimidates the world.</p>

    <p>His pupils are deep. But they are different from the dark jade-like pupils in the past. At this moment, Dongda's pupils have transformed into the appearance of Dao Number 16. This indicates that Wang Ling is using the pupil technique. Temporarily experience this diary. The life recorded by Emperor Lidong.</p>

    <p>"Emperor."</p>

    <p>At this time, a young man with skin as fair as jade and long flowing hair came from a distance wielding a sword. He landed directly next to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>All character information, including the following script, were instantly generated in Wang Ling's mind.</p>

    <p>This young man is the white-robed steward and military governor of the Dongda Emperor's palace, Ye Ren.</p>

    <p>There was no need for Wang Ling to speak. His body automatically responded to Ye Ren according to the script in the diary: "What's the matter?"</p>

    <p>"The envoys of the Western Emperor are here. Do you want to see the emperor? He said that if you want to have a truce, you must agree to all the requests of their envoys..." At this time, Ye Ren said with a bow.</p>
