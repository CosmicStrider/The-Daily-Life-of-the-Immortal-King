  <h1>Chapter 1326 The 2nd Son of the Void</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Office of Strategic Deception In the center of the lake. There is a water tower buried underground.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei came here with the monks. He introduced the details about the water tower: "This was designed when the sect was established. It can be used to suppress evil spirits."</p>

    <p>"The Office of Strategic Deception sect's facilities are indeed complete." The monk nodded.</p>

    <p>In modern cultivation society, there are not many buildings in sects specifically designed to seal evil spirits.</p>

    <p>This kind of building is also called a "spirit-suppressing facility." In ancient times, it was mostly used to imprison ferocious beasts or extremely evil monsters.</p>

    <p>As soon as the monk saw the tower in the water, he already knew the structure of the tower.</p>

    <p>It is established at the intersection of six underground spiritual veins. Once any evil thing is sealed inside, there is almost no ability to escape.</p>

    <p>What's more, now that the earth has completed its upgrade, the level of the underground spiritual veins has also changed.</p>

    <p>The original heavenly veins were transformed into divine veins. The earthly veins were transformed into heavenly veins.</p>

    <p>In other words, the six underground spiritual veins under the Office of Strategic Deception were originally earth veins. Now they have been upgraded to heavenly veins and their power is even more unparalleled.</p>

    <p>The monk dropped a golden bead into the lake. The golden light penetrated the lake, causing the central lake of the Office of Strategic Deception to ripple with golden light waves.</p>

    <p>"What a powerful Buddha's light." Lord Diulei was surprised.</p>

    <p>"The poor monk sealed the chaos sculpture of the groundhog in a Buddhist bead. Now he has added the seal from the Office of Strategic Deception's water tower. Even if he overcomes his inner demons, he will not be able to break out of it in a short time." Jin Deng said.</p>

    <p>He chanted Buddhist scriptures and worked with Lord Diulei to cast spells to open the main door of the water tower.</p>

    <p>Then, the golden bead was immediately swallowed up by the water tower. The boiling golden lake calmed down instantly and returned to normal.</p>

    <p>After doing all this, Lord Diulei secretly breathed a sigh of relief: "Will he figure it out?"</p>

    <p>"This is a poor groundhog. He is also a stupid groundhog. I believe he will figure it out after the poor monk and Ling Zhenren return from the Unspeakable Land."</p>

    <p>The monk said: "Dedicate himself to meritorious deeds. Serve the poor monk and Ling Zhenren. This is his only way out."</p>

    <p>After all, it was the number one divine beast under Dao Ancestor Wang back then.</p>

    <p>As a proud prairie dog, after getting used to doing whatever he wants, he chooses the path of "following the heart" to start over. This is a very difficult choice.</p>

    <p>But the monk always believed that the prairie dog would eventually give in.</p>

    <p>After all, the physiological structure of a mythical beast like "egg removes the whip from the sky." Probably only Ling Zhenren can forcefully change it against destiny.</p>

    <p>For the sake of a "happy" life, you have to give in!</p>

    <p>While he was thinking in his mind, the monk suddenly thought of something else: "Zhenjun, I heard that you have captured two other people who are suspected to be sons of the void?"</p>

    <p>Tomorrow we will go to an unspeakable place.</p>

    <p>And the manipulator behind this unspeakable place...</p>

    <p>It is also the object that the monk has been keeping a close eye on.</p>

    <p>When the groundhog hid himself in the gray fog, his identity had not yet been revealed, so there was suspicion.</p>

    <p>But now the groundhog suspicion has been eliminated.</p>

    <p>So. If the gap in the Unspeakable Land is torn apart by man.</p>

    <p>The Lord of the Void and the fortune teller are the most suspect.</p>

    <p>Before setting off. The monk wants to know more clues.</p>

    <p>"Yes. Jiang Xiaoche and Yi Zhiyang. are currently in the Office of Strategic Deception."</p>

    <p>"How are they doing now?"</p>

    <p>"The two people have never exuded the smell of void. It is completely different from the situation of Sun Rong girl." Lord Diulei said: "Is there something wrong?"</p>

    <p>"It's indeed a bit strange." The monk was also surprised.</p>

    <p>The Book of Sage Immortal rarely makes miscalculations.</p>

    <p>But if one of Yi Zhiyang and Jiang Xiaoche is a son of the void, then they should have exuded the smell of the void long ago...</p>

    <p>The monk turns the beads and uses his fingers to make calculations.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei saw streams of steam emanating from the six ring scars on the monk's head. It was like the chimney on an old-fashioned locomotive. It made a "wuwuwu" sound...</p>

    <p>This is when the monk is performing a complex calculation process.</p>

    <p>This is a phenomenon that occurs because the brain is running too fast to dissipate heat. A large amount of high temperature will radiate from the six scars on the head of monk Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei thought to himself, if there is a pot at this time, he can put it on the monk's head to make hot pot...</p>

    <p>The monk spent a long time making calculations.</p>

    <p>Previously, he had always suspected that the Unspeakable Land was related to the Void Incident.</p>

    <p>But now it seems that if Jiang Xiaoche and Yi Zhiyang have not become sons of the void, then the monk feels that there may be another possibility!</p>

    <p>That is, it is possible that someone deliberately misled them.</p>

    <p>Point your gaze into the void.</p>

    <p>And the Lord of the Void may also be the one being used...</p>

    <p>"Not good!" After about five or six minutes, Monk Jin Deng raised his head. It seemed that something suddenly occurred to him.</p>

    <p>"What happened to Master?" Lord Diulei asked.</p>

    <p>"Where is Miss Sun's physical body now?" the monk asked anxiously.</p>

    <p>"In the hall of True Venerated Immortal. Leave it under the supervision of a dedicated person."</p>

    <p>"Go and have a look!"</p>

    <p>By the central lake. The expression on Monk Jin Deng's face looked extremely anxious.</p>

    <p>The two of them jumped up. They turned into two streaks of light and quickly approached the direction of the True Venerated Immortal Hall.</p>

    <p>At this time, in the main hall, the girl's body, which had been illuminated, was still lying quietly in the medical cabin.</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Lord. is sitting cross-legged in front of the medical cabin on guard.</p>

    <p>When Lord Diulei came here, he suddenly felt that the figure in front of him was in a trance. He seemed to see Wang Ling himself guarding Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>After all, Crispy Noodles is Wang Ling's "real doppelg√§nger." The two of them look similar. Even Lord Diulei feels that this kind of illusion happens from time to time.</p>

    <p>"Open it." The situation was urgent. The monk asked Crispy Noodles Dao Lord as soon as he landed.</p>

    <p>"Open it. Master may have thought of something." Lord Diulei nodded along.</p>

    <p>After receiving Lord Diulei's order, Crispy Noodles Dao Lord stood up and carefully opened the hatch of the medical cabin.</p>

    <p>The monk was turning the rosary beads rapidly in his hand. The expression on his face looked very nervous.</p>

    <p>He hopes his judgment is wrong.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, this thing... would be really scary.</p>

    <p>However, the moment he re-examined the girl's body, the monk's entire expression changed. His breathing became rapid almost instantly.</p>

    <p>"It's still a step too late..." The monk sighed.</p>

    <p>"Master. What on earth is going on?"</p>

    <p>"Haven't you noticed yet?"</p>

    <p>The monk looked at the girl's illuminated body and said.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei carefully observed the girl in the medical cabin. At first, he did not notice anything unusual.</p>

    <p>However, after looking at it, I soon discovered the clue: "This..."</p>

    <p>He discovered that the girl in the medical cabin had no shadow!</p>

    <p>"Fell into a trap!"</p>

    <p>The monk felt a little headache: "If the poor monk guessed correctly, Miss Sun has a twin body of void!"</p>

    <p>"Twin Void?"</p>

    <p>"In other words, Miss Sun and Miss Sun's shadow are all children of the void!" the monk said.</p>

    <p>"Is it related to Shadow?"</p>

    <p>"It does matter! But Nuan Zhenren didn't do it intentionally..."</p>

    <p>The monk shook his head: "Judging from the current results, it should be Miss Sun's shadow that awakened on its own."</p>

    <p>When Lord Diulei heard this, he suddenly understood.</p>

    <p>Self-awakening...</p>

    <p>Isn't this similar to what happened to Wang Ying?</p>

    <p>He was dissatisfied with the ridicule of his true body. Then he awakened his spiritual wisdom and wanted to replace his true body...</p>

    <p>All I can say is that girl Sun Rong deserves to be girl Sun Rong...</p>

    <p>Even the accident that happened was so similar to Brother Ling's...</p>

    <p>They are indeed a pair of living treasures! A perfect match!</p>

    <p>At this time, the corner of Lord Diulei's mouth twitched. He couldn't laugh or cry in his heart.</p>
