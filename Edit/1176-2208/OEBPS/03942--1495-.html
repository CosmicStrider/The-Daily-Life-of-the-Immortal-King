  <h1>Chapter 1495 Chen Chao's mouth becomes stronger again</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Monday, December 14th. On this morning, two people from Class 1 and 3 of Number 60 High School were absent.</p>

    <p>One is Wang Ling. And the other is Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High School currently knows that Wang Ling and Sun Rong are about to go abroad. In fact, there are also Gu Shunzhi, Wang Zhen and others. They are now also one of the core members of the Office of Strategic Deception. This You can still get some information by clicking on it.</p>

    <p>According to the official statement provided by Teacher Pan, it is said that Wang Ling and Sun Rong are sick, so they need to rest at home for a while...</p>

    <p>If other people disappear, there is a high probability that not many people will pay attention to it. But the disappearance of these two together is a bit confusing.</p>

    <p>Are you sick together? Are you applying to recuperate at home at the same time?</p>

    <p>Others in the class may believe this. But Chen Chao and Guo Hao are not so easy to believe.</p>

    <p>"No way...is it really happening?" The two living treasures looked at each other. The expressions on their faces were extremely wonderful.</p>

    <p>On Xiu Zhen Cultivation Street, they left early and left a lot of space. They thought that the two of them would make progress now. But they didn't expect that the progress would be so fast.</p>

    <p>In two days, it was all done in the hospital.</p>

    <p>Abortion...</p>

    <p>They immediately thought of scenes that often appear in TV dramas.</p>

    <p>In the "Ling Rong Assist Discussion Group" formed by Guo Hao, Li Youyue, and Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>They are discussing the relevant situation enthusiastically.</p>

    <p>"You are too dirty! You can go anywhere you want... Who said that going to the hospital must be an abortion? And... it can't be that fast!!" Li Youyue said angrily.</p>

    <p>"If not, is it possible that Wang Ling couldn't hold back his impulse and wanted to be a beast. Then someone discovered that he had his leg broken?" Even Guo Hao himself didn't know what to say. Believe it too much.</p>

    <p>For this frigid piece of wood, the probability of becoming a beast is almost zero.</p>

    <p>It's time to do it early...</p>

    <p>When I was in the Xiao family compound, I had more opportunities to be alone.</p>

    <p>"I don't think your child is the kind of man to do that kind of thing."</p>

    <p>At this time, Chen Chao suddenly typed: "But they both disappeared at the same time. And they took sick leave. It's really interesting."</p>

    <p>"Well, I think there is probably something else behind this." Li Youyue said.</p>

    <p>The main reason is that all three of them privately sent text messages to Wang Ling or Sun Rong to inquire about the situation. However, they did not receive any reply.</p>

    <p>This situation is indeed a bit incredible.</p>

    <p>However, they also knew Teacher Pan.</p>

    <p>As a meticulous and gold medal teacher, Teacher Pan will basically not lie to others.</p>

    <p>So it seems like someone older than Teacher Pan must have planned and organized something. Then he called Wang Ling and Sun Rong out...</p>

    <p>"Could it be... studying abroad?" At this time, Chen Chao suddenly said: "I remember that foreign students came to our school in the past. There seemed to be exchange student plans. This time, instead of our class, there will be a classmate Jiugong Liangzi?"</p>

    <p>"It's possible!" When Guo Hao and Li Youyue saw what Chen Chao had typed, they immediately nodded like chickens pecking at rice.</p>

    <p>"In other words... they actually went abroad for their honeymoon?" Li Youyue's mouth twitched.</p>

    <p>At this time, Guo Hao couldn't help but laugh: "Honeymoon is an exaggeration. Can the things of a cultural person be called a honeymoon? That's called learning!"</p>

    <p>Li Youyue: "Yes, yes! Study! Hehehehe!"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao echoed: "Hehehehe!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After some discussion, Chen Chao and others seem to have the answer. They are the best brothers of Wang Ling. Even if they know something, they will only rot in their stomachs and will not tell it.</p>

    <p>However, Chen Chao and others are not the only ones who have doubts about this matter.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying was actually not in a good mood that day. She looked longingly at the empty seats of Wang Ling and Sun Rong. She felt that there was probably something going on between the two of them.</p>

    <p>When school was about to end, Jiang Yingying repeated his old tricks and blocked Chen Chao and Guo Hao at the school gate again.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Jiang...please let me go. I really don't know where your child has gone."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao raised his hands in a gesture of surrender. Chen Chao stepped forward very loyally and blocked Little Fatty Guo behind him.</p>

    <p>"I know. My classmates say that you have a crush on Lingzi. But sometimes. In fact, you really can't force it. As Wang Ling's best brother, your behavior will not only cause trouble to us, but also to classmates Wang Ling is also troublesome."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao said this very seriously. Jiang Yingying was stunned for a moment.</p>

    <p>The girl lowered her head. Her face was flushed. She was probably embarrassed because she was being told something. She was reflecting on herself.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao saw Jiang Yingying's nose twitching, as if tears were about to fall in the next second. He quickly relaxed his tone and said in as gentle a tone as possible: "Actually...Classmate Jiang Yingying. I have always wanted to ask. Do you really like your classmate Wang Ling?"</p>

    <p>These words made Jiang Yingying's mind go blank for a while: "I... of course..."</p>

    <p>"No. What I want to ask is, does classmate Jiang like Lingzi's literary talent or does he like him?"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao smiled and said: "Although I have been single for a long time, I understand a little bit about emotional matters. At our age, it is actually easy to mistake affection, friendship, admiration and the like for love. You just I read an essay by Lingzi and said that I like him. So I think Jiang Yingying should think carefully about it."</p>

    <p>"I..." Jiang Yingying was speechless for a moment. For a moment, she didn't know how to refute Chen Chao's words.</p>

    <p>"It's okay, classmate Jiang. In fact, you don't need to answer me now. These questions of mine are just out of the relationship with Lingzi as brothers. Some of the questions I raised for you are just immature and small questions." Chen Chao said.</p>

    <p>In fact, Chen Chao himself doesn't know why. He seems to be becoming more and more eloquent...</p>

    <p>Especially since the beginning of this semester, his language organization ability seems to have been strengthened.</p>

    <p>If the time range is more precise, it should be since I took the math class of the new vice principal "Huo Ding"...</p>

    <p>A series of questions left Jiang Yingying unable to answer. She stopped asking about the situation of Wang Ling. The expression on her face was slightly lost and she walked towards the station.</p>

    <p>"Isn't it too much to say?" Chen Chao frowned, somewhat less assured.</p>

    <p>"Let's follow behind and send classmate Jiang Yingying back first. Her condition is really worrying," Guo Hao said.</p>

    <p>Just like that, as soon as the two of them joined together, they followed him secretly.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Ling and Sun Rong were going through relevant procedures for leaving the country at the same place.</p>

    <p>Because I need to be present in person, Wang Ling has to personally participate in this matter.</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling is not the first time to go abroad.</p>

    <p>Mainly whether it is going abroad according to the formal procedures or it is the first time...</p>

    <p>Because he habitually used teleportation in the past. Theoretically speaking, Wang Ling has actually entered other countries illegally several times. And it was the kind of thing where he jumped repeatedly. Others still had no way to do anything about him.</p>

    <p>Huaxiu State Entry-Entry Administration Bureau.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling, who was taking passport photos, encountered a new problem...</p>

    <p>"This classmate Wang Ling. Can you smile?"</p>

    <p>The female police officer who took the ID photo was holding a SLR camera. She looked at Wang Ling and asked.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling grinned. The female police officer couldn't laugh or cry: "Why do you look like you are crying when you laugh?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Female police officer: "Come. Learn from me: Is Ku Xuan handsome?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Female police officer: "Don't say anything. Just follow my example. I'll capture it."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "But I can't. lie..."</p>

    <p>Female police officer: "..."</p>
