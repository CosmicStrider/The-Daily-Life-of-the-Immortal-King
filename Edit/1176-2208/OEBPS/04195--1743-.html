  <h1>Chapter 1743 Father and Son Bureau</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The Dragon Cemetery, where the remains of all the dragons are said to be buried, is actually the back of the fourth dragon that hides the leader of the dragons. Such a thing sounds so fantastical that it is unbelievable.</p>

    <p>In the distant Milky Way, Bai Zhe, who transformed into a moonlight dragon, opened his eyes. His body was filled with holy light. It was bright, flawless, sacred and could not be blasphemed.</p>

    <p>The two bright crescent moons in the pupils were particularly eye-catching, with a strange depth. Just when Jingze and Wang Ling were fighting in the Dragon Cemetery, he paid close attention to the movements there.</p>

    <p>It wasn't until Wang Muyu was created that Bai Zhe's mind was at peace.</p>

    <p>"They have been defeated." He spoke and communicated with the huge bunch of grapes growing in chaos.</p>

    <p>"As expected, activating the checks and balances of the universe is not your main purpose." Fenmu Shen seemed to have expected this.</p>

    <p>"To deal with him, we must make additional preparations. As soon as he sets foot in the Dragon Cemetery, his fate has already begun to be sealed."</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe's voice was calm. He looked forward. The moonlight projected in his pupils seemed to reach a very long distance, allowing him to understand everything. "I had been guessing before. If he had the ability to control the balance of the universe... then... this The second move is the best way to deal with him."</p>

    <p>"I see. That's what you had in mind." Fenmu Shen chuckled and said, "That little omnipotent dragon has all the genes of your dragon family. But it's not easy to create it."</p>

    <p>"Yes. In this little dragon, the hardest scales of every dragon in the Dragon Clan have been fused. If he is created, it will violate the balance of the universe, and will certainly be judged. Therefore, in all the previous experiments, none of them were successful."</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe mused, "And his appearance, in a sense, changed this fate. Wherever he is, the check and balance mechanism of the universe will temporarily fail, and Wang Muyu will be successfully created."</p>

    <p>"So Director Bai has already arranged the next script?"</p>

    <p>"Naturally."</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe smiled, "That's right. Learn from the barbarians and gain skills to control the barbarians. There is no need to use the balance of the universe. There is no need for me to take action. I want Wang Muyu... to kill Wang Ling with his own hands."</p>

    <p>"But this little guy doesn't think so now." Fenmu Shen smiled bitterly.</p>

    <p>"He has the blood of our dragon clan. All the genes of ten thousand dragons are in his body. I'm afraid it's up to him."</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe said, "If he grows up and surpasses the current four leaders of the Dragon Clan, it will only be a matter of time. But now he has just been created. With the help of the four leaders of the Dragon Clan, we must gather the power of the dragon to suppress this father-son game. The show of duel will be staged soon."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At this moment, in the Dragon Cemetery, there were loud roars of dragons.</p>

    <p>These sounds come and go, each different. They carry the supreme majesty and aura of the dragon clan in the past, shrouded in the back of this huge dragon.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling frowned slightly, because he heard a little bit of mourning and wailing in these seemingly loud dragon roars.</p>

    <p>"Monk, it's not over yet." Jingze got up from the ground. The injuries on his body had recovered a little, but he no longer had the fighting power he had in his prime.</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng remained silent. He knew the arrogance of the dragon clan. As an excellent dragon-born warrior, if he did not defeat this final bottom line, he might not be easily convinced.</p>

    <p>But what is the final bottom line?</p>

    <p>Ever since the roar of the dragon sounded from the broad dragon's back, Monk Jin Deng had a bad premonition. He felt as if something was coming.</p>

    <p>"What do you want to do?" asked the monk Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>"Monk, don't you know how to calculate? Let's calculate what we will do." Jingze smiled sadly. The eternal moon starlight on his body was strengthened again from a long distance. It seemed to be stronger than before. "Moon Dragon Lord It's calling me. I'm leaving."</p>

    <p>"You thought. Can you go?" The monk took a step forward and said. The dragon's roar on the dragon's back gave him a very bad feeling, but he didn't know what exactly happened.</p>

    <p>"I want to leave. Of course you can't stop me." Jingze hummed, "Don't forget. I captured so many of you before this. These people are all related to the Ling Zhenren behind you."</p>

    <p>After saying that, he leaned down and patted the ground. A strong spiritual energy surged out from the ground. Then appeared densely packed runes that spread out all around like a spider web, eventually forming a circular spiritual array.</p>

    <p>"Psychic formation?" The monk's heart moved. He saw the origin of this formation.</p>

    <p>What appeared along with this formation were all the people on the list that Jingze had captured previously. Among them were many classmates from Wang Ling's Number 60 High School. Even Old Gudong and Teacher Pan. Jingze. I didn't let them go and caught them all.</p>

    <p>At this moment, they seemed to have fallen into a deep sleep. They were all lying neatly in the cage on all sides, motionless.</p>

    <p>"There are dragon restrictions on the cage. If you go against me, this cage will explode in an instant." Jingze said. Negotiating, "Today's battle has no result. And what I want now is to leave safely."</p>

    <p>After saying that, he stared at Wang Muyu and Ling Yue in the distance, "Of course. It would be best if we could take away the kid and the traitor over there."</p>

    <p>"Do you think you are qualified to negotiate terms now? Jingze." The monk frowned slightly.</p>

    <p>The Dragon Restriction on the Cage.</p>

    <p>He knows it very well.</p>

    <p>Even if Jingze is not let go, Wang Ling can easily resolve it.</p>

    <p>However, the matter was serious at this time. The monk felt that he could not make the decision, so he still turned his attention to Wang Ling "Ling Zhenren..."</p>

    <p>"Let him go."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Voice transmission.</p>

    <p>"Okay." The monk nodded.</p>

    <p>After confirming the look with Wang Ling, Monk Jin Deng knew the next step.</p>

    <p>Obviously. Wang Ling wants to play a long game to catch the big fish. Let's see what Bai Zhe is planning.</p>

    <p>"Jingze, don't regret it in the future if you leave. Not everyone has the opportunity to be a mount for Ling Zhenren." Helplessly, the monk warned him.</p>

    <p>"Ha. Who wants to be his mount? Want me, the Dragon Clan, to be his mount? It's better to dream! Even if I die, I, Jingze, will not be a human mount!" Jingze said.</p>

    <p>He immediately abandoned the cage and evacuated at all costs. He slipped away like the wind, with a posture of running as far as he could.</p>

    <p>This left a mess all over the floor.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying crossed his arms and asked, "Does this fourth Dragon Lord really exist? How do I see and feel about it? The Dragon Cemetery at my feet doesn't look like a real dragon's back."</p>

    <p>"The theory of the dragon's back should be true. The fourth dragon master does exist. It's just that the one we're stepping on shouldn't be the one."</p>

    <p>The monk laughed and said, "This should be dragon skin."</p>

    <p>"Dragon skin?"</p>

    <p>"I'm not sure, but I think so. In the Vanguard tome "The Legend of the Dragon and the Serpent", some of the Dragons have the ability to metamorphose their skins. This skin can be transformed into a realm of its own in the universe, giving birth to living beings. Thus the name Dragonfall." the monk said.</p>

    <p>"Just let him go?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ming, Sun Rong and others also came from a distance.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming checked the injuries of the people captured by Jingze in the cage. He breathed a sigh of relief, "It's okay. None of them were injured. I'll just use brain waves to delete their memories later. This kind of damage will be minimal." We won't let them become scumbags."</p>

    <p>"Can ordinary memory erasure damage the brain?"</p>

    <p>"Of course there are certain risks in erasing memories with spells." Wang Ming said with a smile, "Why do you think there are so many scumbags in this world? Maybe it's because you saw things you shouldn't have seen. You don't know if your memory has been erased."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying"..."</p>

    <p>In the middle of this conversation, Wang Ling felt that his face was being stared at by the little guy, as if he was going to stare through him.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked away. Deliberately not looking directly at Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>Then. Before Wang Ming was about to use brain waves to clear his memory.</p>

    <p>Among the people sleeping in the cage, one of them suddenly moved his eyelids.</p>

    <p>"Eh? This person seems to be waking up... His name seems to be. Chen Chao?"</p>

    <p>"It's the poor monk's fault..." The monk smiled bitterly.</p>

    <p>After all, Chen Chao is a person who has been enlightened. He is relatively resistant to some negative effects. Therefore, he woke up earlier than everyone in the cage.</p>

    <p>Just when Monk Jin Deng decided whether to continue casting spells to make Chen Chao fall asleep.</p>

    <p>Immediately afterwards, a childish greeting from Wang Muyu came to the scene, "Dad!"</p>

    <p>The sound was so loud that it carried through the entire audience.</p>

    <p>The loud children's voice was so loud that it completely woke up the half-awake Chen Chao on the spot.</p>

    <p>Dad?</p>

    <p>At this time, Chen Chao sat up in shock as if he was dying of illness. He stared at the scene in front of him through the cage in astonishment.</p>

    <p>I feel like I know something terrible...</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling held his forehead. Suddenly he felt a little pain in his brain.</p>

    <p>I wish he had kept his integrity for so many years.</p>

    <p>Why did he suddenly become a father...</p>

    <p>();</p>
