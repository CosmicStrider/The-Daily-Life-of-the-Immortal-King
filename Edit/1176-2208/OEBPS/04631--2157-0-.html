  <h1>Chapter 2157: Sending a nuclear bomb 0 miles away. The courtesy is light but the affection is heavy.</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: You never know how hard a group of wanted criminals on the run will work just to be able to play the game.</p>

    <p>As a senior game geek, the first discoverer of this game was Qingjiao. He accidentally saw the closed beta introduction on the game forum. He felt itchy in his heart.</p>

    <p>They have been hiding overseas for a long time since Xie Jian Shen was captured. They are very cautious in everything. This has resulted in their extreme lack of freedom in the past.</p>

    <p>Itinerant Immortal is an alternative way for them to find freedom.</p>

    <p>Qingjiao is a game expert. He is also a technical geek. He clearly knows that the game cabin has a crime locating system. It is very likely that they will be detected as wanted criminals on the run.</p>

    <p>So it was Qingjiao's idea to make a puppet for mid-end links.</p>

    <p>Moreover, this mid-range technology has also allowed Sixiangzhong to make a lot of money on the foreign black market. Many suspects with criminal cases have also successfully experienced the fun brought by this game.</p>

    <p>Since the establishment of the guild of the same name, the Four Elephants. As monks with rich experience in swordsmanship, Qingjiao, Xuehu, Zhu??, and Xiongwu have developed a variety of novel ways of playing according to their respective fields of swordsmanship.</p>

    <p>This allows them to gain a long-lost sense of satisfaction in the virtual world in the real world.</p>

    <p>Itinerant Immortal's magic ring is not a gold-earning game. But the daily maintenance of the game cabin costs money. The daily maintenance of the puppets also costs money. They rely on the revenue from selling puppets on the black market as the key to balancing their books.</p>

    <p>Another more important point is that Xiongwu saw the hope of a comeback for the Four Elephants in the Itinerant Immortal.</p>

    <p>Since they are hiding in the real world in the Middle East. Why not directly use the game to cultivate power?</p>

    <p>As long as their influence is large enough, more and more sword immortal players will join. In the real world, these sword immortal players may not necessarily be mainstream swordsmanship practitioners. But being able to choose this profession means that they are interested in swordsmanship.</p>

    <p>Then this can directly filter out a group of people.</p>

    <p>According to Xiong Wu's plan, when the number of people in the guild increases, he will use his status as president to gradually understand the true background of each person, and finally decide whether to recruit them into his team.</p>

    <p>Once the team is established, he will give the new team a new name. In fact, it is a branch under the name of Sixiangzhong.</p>

    <p>Originally, the Four Symbols were a branch of the Wuji Sword Sect.</p>

    <p>Now they have established a branch of their own. It is very reasonable.</p>

    <p>Once the branch line is established, Xiongwu will teach the swordsmanship skills created by the Evil Jian Shen in real life to enhance the reputation of the Four Elephants.</p>

    <p>It can be said that this entire process plan is very detailed. It is so thorough that several people are amazed by it. At the same time, relying on the game to rise in real life has become the only hope for Sixiangzhong at the moment.</p>

    <p>But what Xiongwu never expected was that at this juncture, they met... the guarding general of Fuyun Town.</p>

    <p>"Found it!"</p>

    <p>Just after a few people decided to find out the location of Wang Ling, Qingjiao, a technical geek, kept investigating Wang Ling. He is also a well-known person in the hacker world. He has a girl named Meirenjiao. ID.</p>

    <p>The overall strength is actually on par with Ma Jiao from Jiudaohe High School.</p>

    <p>"How is it!?" Xiongwu asked with concern.</p>

    <p>"Brother! This person is real! Not an NPC! He is a real player!"</p>

    <p>"This guy is cheating!"</p>

    <p>"I don't know...but it is indeed a real player...but the opponent's coordinates are well encrypted. There is no way to locate it at the moment...I can only find a way to hack into the opponent's game cabin. See if I can make the game The crime alarm system of the cabin accidentally triggered. Finally, the other party's game cabin was launched directly to our side."</p>

    <p>Qingjiao revealed his comprehensive plan.</p>

    <p>To be honest. He was still hesitating.</p>

    <p>Because it stands to reason that the firewall of ordinary players is not like this, and it should not have such thorough encryption measures. This is most likely because behind the general of Fuyun Town, there is also a master who knows hacking technology secretly planning. everything.</p>

    <p>In this case, it seems to make sense why the other party has so many magical skills in the game.</p>

    <p>Because the general of Fuyun Town may not only be a real player. He may also be a game administrator?</p>

    <p>But obviously, Xiongwu could no longer care about this. He ordered Qingjiao: "Fourth brother! Just do what you want! Something happened. Big brother is here!"</p>

    <p>Because the realism of Itinerant Immortal's magical ring is too strong. Xiongwu is still a little bit into the game after suffering such humiliation in the game. He cannot accept such humiliation.</p>

    <p>Therefore, he couldn't calm down properly. He was furious and wanted to kill Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>On the other side, in fact, when Qingjiao checked the coordinates of Wang Ling for the first time.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming had already felt the attack from the green dragon.</p>

    <p>Inside the Karma Base, Wang Ming is planning everything. It feels interesting.</p>

    <p>"Ling Ling's game cabin was attacked." Wang Ming said calmly and calmly while looking at the code that was constantly beating in front of him.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin next to her was also very calm, because she knew clearly that when it came to hacking technology, no one could compare to the most powerful brain in front of her who was good at calculations.</p>

    <p>"What are you going to do?" Zhai Yin asked.</p>

    <p>"Teacher Shou Chong."</p>

    <p>"I am here."</p>

    <p>"Save Ling Ling's game data to avoid data damage when the link is disconnected later."</p>

    <p>"good."</p>

    <p>Now, inside the Itinerant Immortal magic ring, the layer of gray fog is still very hazy. Players in the game world can still exit and enter the game normally. Once more than half of the realization is completed, even the game will not be able to exit. Only Can be entered from the outside.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming also didn't expect Sixiangzhong to take the bait so quickly. He also arranged for Zhuo Yi, Qin Zhong, and Xiang Yi to sneak in respectively.</p>

    <p>As a result, the other party could no longer sit still.</p>

    <p>After explaining to Shou Chong, Wang Ming calculated the time and pressed the red button on the system control panel.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>In the Karma Base, the space channel directly connected to the ground was opened. A beam of light shone from above and fell directly on the game cabin of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Wang Ling, who was playing the game, suddenly woke up. He realized that he had temporarily returned to the real world.</p>

    <p>And. The whole thing seems to be in a state of waiting for launch...</p>

    <p>"Are you... using your own tactics?" Zhai Yin suddenly realized. She understood everything.</p>

    <p>"You could say that."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming smiled sinisterly: "My brother's nuclear bomb. Since they want it so much, let them take it. Anyway, I won't lose anything here..."</p>

    <p>The words just fell.</p>

    <p>Only a "boom" was heard in the laboratory.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's game cabin directly ascended to the sky. With Wang Ling, it was ejected directly from the Karma Base. It rushed out of the ground. Then, with the assistance of the high-density spiritual booster, it headed towards the real world. The coordinates and directions of the four elephants inside are radiated...</p>
