  <h1>Chapter 2157: Sending a nuclear bomb from 0 miles away: A small gift with a big meaning</h1>

  <div>

    <p>You never know how hard a group of wanted criminals on the run will work just to be able to play the game.</p>

    <p>As a senior game geek, the first discoverer of this game was Qing Jiao. He accidentally saw the closed beta introduction on the game forum. He felt itchy in his heart.</p>

    <p>They have been hiding overseas for a long time since Evil Sword God was captured. They are very cautious in everything. This has resulted in their extreme lack of freedom in the past.</p>

    <p>Itinerant Immortal is an alternative way for them to find freedom.</p>

    <p>Qing Jiao is a game expert. He is also a technical geek. He clearly knows that the game cabin has a crime locating system. It is very likely that they will be detected as wanted criminals on the run.</p>

    <p>So it was Qing Jiao's idea to make a puppet for mid-end links.</p>

    <p>Moreover, this mid-range technology has also allowed the Four Elephants to make a lot of money on the foreign black market. Many suspects with criminal cases have also successfully experienced the fun brought by this game.</p>

    <p>Since the establishment of the guild of the same name, the Four Elephants. As monks with rich experience in swordsmanship, Qing Jiao, Xue Hu, Zhu Qi, and Xiong Wu have developed a variety of novel ways of playing according to their respective fields of swordsmanship.</p>

    <p>This allows them to gain a long-lost sense of satisfaction in the virtual world in the real world.</p>

    <p>Itinerant Immortal's magic ring is not a pay-to-win game, the daily maintenance of the game cabin costs money. The daily maintenance of the puppets also costs money. They rely on the revenue from selling puppets on the black market as the key to balancing their books.</p>

    <p>Another more important point is that Xiong Wu saw the hope of a comeback for the Four Elephants in the Itinerant Immortal.</p>

    <p>Since they're constantly hiding and running in the real world, why not use games to cultivate their influence directly?</p>

    <p>As long as their influence is large enough, more and more Sword Immortal players will join. In the real world, these Sword Immortal players may not necessarily be mainstream swordsmanship practitioners. But being able to choose this profession means that they are interested in swordsmanship.</p>

    <p>Then this can directly filter out a group of people.</p>

    <p>According to Xiong Wu's plan, when the number of people in the guild increases, he will use his status as president to gradually understand the true background of each person, and finally decide whether to recruit them into his team.</p>

    <p>Once the team is established, he will give the new team a new name. In fact, it is a branch under the name of the Four Elephants.</p>

    <p>Originally, the Four Elephants were a branch of the Wuji Sword Sect.</p>

    <p>Now they have established a branch of their own. It is very reasonable.</p>

    <p>Once the branch line is established, Xiong Wu will teach the swordsmanship skills created by the Evil Sword God in real life to enhance the reputation of the Four Elephants.</p>

    <p>It can be said that this entire process plan is very detailed. It is so thorough that several people are amazed by it. At the same time, relying on the game to rise in real life has become the only hope for the Four Elephants at the moment.</p>

    <p>But what Xiong Wu never expected was that at this juncture, they met... the guarding general of Fuyun Town.</p>

    <p>"Found it!"</p>

    <p>Just after a few people decided to find out the location of Wang Ling, Qing Jiao, a technical geek, kept investigating Wang Ling. He was a well-known figure in the hacker world and had an ID called "Mei Ren Jiao".</p>

    <p>The overall strength is actually on par with Ma Jiao from Jiudaohe High School.</p>

    <p>"How is it!?" Xiong Wu asked with concern.</p>

    <p>"Brother! This person is real! Not an NPC! He is a real player!"</p>

    <p>"This guy is cheating!"</p>

    <p>"I don't know... but it is indeed a real player... but the opponent's coordinates are well encrypted. There is no way to locate it at the moment... I can only find a way to hack into the opponent's game cabin. See if I can make the game crime alarm system of the cabin accidentally trigger, the other party's game cabin will launch directly to our side."</p>

    <p>Qing Jiao revealed his comprehensive plan.</p>

    <p>To be honest. He was still hesitating.</p>

    <p>Because it stands to reason that the firewall of ordinary players is not like this, and it should not have such thorough encryption measures. This is very likely because behind this General of Fuyun Town, there is also a master hacker secretly plotting everything.</p>

    <p>In this case, it seems to make sense why the other party has so many magical skills in the game.</p>

    <p>Because the general of Fuyun Town may not only be a real player. He may also be a game administrator?</p>

    <p>But obviously, Xiong Wu could no longer care about this. He ordered Qing Jiao: "Fourth brother! Just do what you want! If something happens. Big brother is here!"</p>

    <p>Because the realism of Itinerant Immortal's magical ring is too strong. Xiong Wu is still a little bit into the game after suffering such humiliation in the game. He cannot accept such humiliation.</p>

    <p>Therefore, he couldn't calm down properly. He was furious and wanted to kill Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>On the other side, in fact, when Qing Jiao checked the coordinates of Wang Ling for the first time.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming had already felt the attack from Qing Jiao.</p>

    <p>Inside the Karma Base, Wang Ming is planning everything, finding it all quite interesting.</p>

    <p>"Ling Ling's game cabin was attacked." Wang Ming said calmly while looking at the code that was constantly beating in front of him.</p>

    <p>Yin, standing to the side, remained equally calm, for she knew clearly that when it came to hacking skills, no one could rival the most powerful and calculating mind in front of her.</p>

    <p>"What are you going to do?" Zhai Yin asked.</p>

    <p>"Teacher Shou Chong."</p>

    <p>"I am here."</p>

    <p>"Save Ling Ling's game data to avoid data damage when the link is disconnected later."</p>

    <p>"good."</p>

    <p>Now, inside the Itinerant Immortal magic ring, the layer of gray fog is still very hazy. Players in the game world can still exit and enter the game normally. Once more than half of the realization is completed, even the game will not be able to close. Only able to be entered from the outside.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming also didn't expect the Four Elephants to take the bait so quickly. He also arranged for Zhuo Yi, Qin Zhong, and Xiang Yi to sneak in respectively.</p>

    <p>As a result, the other party could no longer sit still.</p>

    <p>After explaining to Shou Chong, Wang Ming calculated the time and pressed the red button on the system control panel.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>In the Karma Base, the space channel directly connected to the ground was opened. A beam of light shone from above and fell directly on the game cabin of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Wang Ling, who was playing the game, suddenly woke up. He realized that he had temporarily returned to the real world.</p>

    <p>And, the whole cabin seems to be in a state of waiting for launch...</p>

    <p>"Are you... using this as a trap?" Zhai Yin suddenly realized. She understood everything.</p>

    <p>"You could say that."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming smiled sinisterly: "My brother is a nuclear bomb. Since they want it so much, let them take it. Anyway, I won't lose anything here..."</p>

    <p>The words just fell.</p>

    <p>Only a "boom" was heard in the laboratory.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's game cabin directly ascended to the sky. With Wang Ling, it was ejected directly from the Karma Base. It rushed out of the ground. Then, with the assistance of the high-density spiritual booster, it headed towards the coordinates and directions of the four elephants in the real world...</p>
