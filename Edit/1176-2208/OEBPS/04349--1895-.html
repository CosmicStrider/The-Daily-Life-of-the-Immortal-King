  <h1>Chapter 1895 Dimensional confrontation across time</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Muyu is in danger.</p>

    <p>At this moment, in the eternal period, in front of the Peng family headquarters in Penglaixing, Wang Ling fell into a brief thought in the body of Emperor Dongda.</p>

    <p>This is a dangerous sixth sense. Even if Wang Ling is now in eternity, in a world that transcends countless time, it can still be felt.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu is now like a younger brother to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Although we don't have much communication at ordinary times, there is already a vague emotion that cannot be let go.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has always been stupid. He doesn't understand what such emotions are. But he knows that he will never send Wang Muyu to Bai Zhe just like that.</p>

    <p>Regarding Wang Muyu's security issues, in fact, Wang Ling has already made plans. Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi received the first secret mission they received while staying in the Office of Strategic Deception since they took up the position of guest elders in the Office of Strategic Deception. In fact, it is Zhou Quan who protects Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>At this time, even if Wang Ling did not speak, the two strongest guards used their own methods to feel the danger that spanned the ages.</p>

    <p>"Something happened over there with brother Muyu." Qin Zhong said from within the team's voice department.</p>

    <p>In order not to disturb Sun Rong's marriage proposal test, he would only communicate with Xiang Yi alone at this time.</p>

    <p>"Did Bai Zhe take action?" Xiang Yi asked.</p>

    <p>"That's right. Judging from the combat prowess, he's still the same Dragonborn as before."</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong frowned slightly: "I have reason to doubt now. We were arranged to go to Eternal Time. Is it also the plan laid out by that side. They want to take the opportunity to attack brother Muyu."</p>

    <p>Speaking of this, Xiang Yi, who played the role of Emperor Beida, suddenly raised his lips and smiled slightly: "What a pity. They found the wrong person."</p>

    <p>After all, protecting Wang Muyu is the job assigned by Wang Ling. Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi are both extremely serious.</p>

    <p>While the two people were talking, they also used their own heaven-defying methods to find out everything about the situation in the modern world of cultivation.</p>

    <p>"Oh, this guy is pretty cool. He still uses a bow and arrow. How interesting!" When Xiang Yi saw Jingze transforming the black umbrella into the form of a bow and arrow, he started to get a little excited.</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong seemed to have guessed what Xiang Yi was going to do: "So. Do you want to hit the target?"</p>

    <p>"I often do this." Xiang Yi scratched his head: "And my bullets will never rust. Although we are across the timeline, I feel that it shouldn't be difficult to snipe him. Nuan Zhenren seems to be preparing to set off. Yes. I just need to delay it for a little while."</p>

    <p>In the past, Xiang Yi and Xiang Yi have been sniping at many cutting-edge technologies of alien beings. But now, the objects we are sniping at are bows and arrows, which are classified as Dragonborn magic weapons. This new experience also makes Xiang Yi eager to try it.</p>

    <p>His Nine Sun Divine Sword is a powerful super heavy sniper! I wonder what the scene will be like against this ancient dragon-born magic weapon bow and arrow?</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, Xiang Yi couldn't stay any longer. He quickly said to Qin Zhong: "Excuse me. I'm going to find a place. Brother Muyu is a bit in danger."</p>

    <p>"Do you want me to stand by and give you some assistance?" Qin Zhong asked.</p>

    <p>"No need. I'll be back soon." Xiang Yi shook his head and said.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>On the other side, the diamond glove in Jingze's hand and the black umbrella that turned into a bow glowed at the same time. The two most powerful dragon-born magic weapons surged with endless thunder. At the same time, they also exuded a kind of holy moonlight. That was given by Bai Zhe The power of his remote blessing.</p>

    <p>When this arrow was shot, everything was extinguished. It was like a god coming to the world. It seemed like it could pierce through everything.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu changed color. He could feel the power contained in this arrow. It was really astonishingly strong. The moment Jingze let go, the thunderous thunder was already squeezing forward like the overturning sea water.</p>

    <p>It has the effect of moonlight tracking. It is an additional ability of Bai Zhe. No matter how Wang Muyu dodges, this arrow will still hit him in the end!</p>

    <p>This is a 100% hit shot!</p>

    <p>It was only then that Wang Muyu discovered the tactical gap between himself and Jingze. It was not that his strength was inferior to Jingze's. It was entirely his lack of combat experience that caused the situation in front of him. The key is that Wang Muyu did not expect that in Jingze's hands. A black umbrella actually has such an effect.</p>

    <p>It can transform into a bow. This is an unstoppable blow. Wang Muyu knew that he would definitely be hit by the arrow. But he still struggled to death. Otherwise, the arrow would hit his vital part.</p>

    <p>He worked hard to calculate the strength and distance of the arrow. Finally, at the moment of impact, he used the ability of the "Gravity Dragon" to rearrange the gravity of the surrounding space to delay the attack.</p>

    <p>However, the power of Jingze's arrow was too powerful. Such delay was of no avail. He could not withstand the huge power of the arrow. The arrow directly pierced his left shoulder, causing a thunderstorm!</p>

    <p>Seven-color glazed dragon blood spurted out instantly and spread all over the ground.</p>

    <p>"You can't escape." Jingze's face was expressionless. He raised his hand. Thunder surged in his palm. He once again used the power of thunder to recall the arrow.</p>

    <p>This time, the arrow was mixed with the power of Wang Muyu's glazed dragon blood, which brought the arrow's ability to a new level.</p>

    <p>He didn't want to kill Wang Muyu, but he used 100% of his fighting power, because Jingze knew very well. Only in this way could it be possible to seriously injure this talented little guy who was fused with Wanlong genes.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Muyu had already been hit by one of his arrows. As long as the second arrow hit again, Wang Muyu would no longer be able to resist.</p>

    <p>"Is the revival of the dragon clan that important to you? Jingze!" Wang Muyu asked. He didn't understand why Jingze wanted to pursue this so hard, even at the cost of being driven by evil people.</p>

    <p>He felt that Jingze still had a sense of justice in his body and should not be used like that by Bai Zhe.</p>

    <p>The glory of the dragon clan is already past history. And there is no connection between the destruction of the dragon clan and modern cultivators. Wang Muyu doesn't understand why this beautiful era is destroyed. He must go back to the past for hegemony. In a world of plunder, the law of the jungle, and supremacy of strength.</p>

    <p>"You have had too much contact with human cultivators. Naturally, you will not understand. This is why I have to take you back." Jingze spoke. His expression was calm, without any emotional fluctuations.</p>

    <p>He was like an emotionless killing machine, aiming his arrow at Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>"You don't have any chance."</p>

    <p>After saying that, he let go of his hand.</p>

    <p>But the moment he let go of his hand.</p>

    <p>"Chi!"</p>

    <p>Suddenly, a brilliant silver beam of light seemed to come from the end of the universe. It penetrated straight in with the breath of endless years!</p>

    <p>This is a beautiful silver bullet!</p>

    <p>Jingze's pupils dilated instantly. It was like an earthquake.</p>

    <p>He would never have thought that there would be such a bullet at this time. It was shot from a strange angle!</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The next second. Accompanied by an explosion, the silver bullet accurately hit the arrow wrapped in thunder and moonlight...</p>
