  <h1>Chapter 2062 Arrangement of Wang Ling</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Dao Number 03 Pupil was directly destroyed. The feedback also appeared immediately on Wang Ling. But compared to the damage caused by King's Eyes going against the will of heaven and burning the miracle contract. This time the price Wang Ling has to pay It's much smaller.</p>

    <p>His myopia has deepened again. It has increased by 10Â° on the original basis. It can basically be regarded as ineffective backlash damage.</p>

    <p>Qiao Yanyuan thought he had destroyed Pupil Number 03. But he didn't know that such cosmic-level legendary objects have self-repair mechanisms.</p>

    <p>Over there, Pupil Number 03 had just been destroyed. In Wang Ling's display cabinet, a golden bud grew out of the vacant spot of Pupil Number 03.</p>

    <p>If you look closely, you will find that there is a small white crescent-shaped mark on the leaves of Meiko. It corresponds to the unique silver-white crescent pupil of Number 03.</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling's Divine Object Display Cabinet is also a cosmic miracle, because he has collected all 7,749 Divine Objects in total that are considered unobtainable by outsiders.</p>

    <p>In this way, the Divine Display Cabinet was included in the ranks of the miracles of the universe.</p>

    <p>King's Eyes. Wang Ling was born with it. This is the hardest one to obtain among the forty-nine eyes. Who knows why he was born with it... He was just a child. His ability was not as strong as it is now.</p>

    <p>In fact, if you find all forty-nine Taoist coins, you can have everything else if you have the King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling didn't find it difficult to collect experiences of other Taoism. This King's Eyes is like a signal detector. The location of each King's Eyes is clearly marked. So Wang Ling, when he was in junior high school, he traveled around the universe and collected all the Taoism.</p>

    <p>Don't delay your studies. Just take advantage of your weekend break to get away from the earth and take a walk.</p>

    <p>Those who know will know that he is looking for other powerful beings in the universe. Those who don't know think that he is playing Genshin Impact 1.0. He is collecting the Eyes of Wind here...</p>

    <p>All in all, it was just a Dao Chaos that was destroyed. It had little impact on Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Of course, these most powerful weapons, which are regarded as legends in the universe, can actually be destroyed. Unless someone can destroy them together, as long as there is one left, the others will slowly grow back over time.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, the display cabinet in the hands of Wang Ling actually functions as a storage box for contact lenses and a greenhouse for cultivating and repairing channels.</p>

    <p>"It's quite interesting to be able to directly destroy Dao Number 03. This guy named Qiao."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was raising a hand to steadily suppress Heavenly Dao Yun. The moment Dao Number 03 was destroyed, he and Wang Ying immediately felt it.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Ying's comment can be regarded as a compliment to Qiao Yanyuan.</p>

    <p>He rarely appreciates other people, especially those enemies who are on the opposite side. Now, there are actually people who can destroy a powerful Dao weapon without any effort. And this is proven by just relying on the power of his own soul. This man's fighting power is amazing.</p>

    <p>But it's a pity. He was exposed too early. In Wang Ying's opinion, such behavior is still stupid.</p>

    <p>The laws of the dark forest in the universe actually also apply in the world of cultivation.</p>

    <p>When you are alive, you must not be too arrogant. Making a fortune in silence is the way to go.</p>

    <p>Although Number 03 was destroyed, Qiao Yanyuan's action also completely exposed himself. He went from a shadow dragonborn behind the scenes to the front of the stage.</p>

    <p>The only fly in the ointment is that there is still too little information about Qiao Yanyuan. Judging from this person's performance, his combat power far exceeds the previous Jingze and Yan?. However, this person hides his ability very well.</p>

    <p>Of course. Wang Ling actually doesn't care what Qiao Yanyuan's abilities are... but if he can have more information here, he can provide the same amount of information to Zhuo Yi at the same time.</p>

    <p>After all, there are some things that are not convenient for him to come forward in person. He still needs Zhuo Yi to take care of them for him.</p>

    <p>"Can you... please respect me?"</p>

    <p>Heavenly Dao Yun was lying on the ground. He saw Wang Ling's eyes wandering, as if he was thinking about other things. This faceless creature was forced to lose his expression at this time. It was full of despair.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was contacting Zhuo Yi and had no time to respond. As a result, this yelling made Wang Ling increase his intensity even more.</p>

    <p>The cry of the faceless creature became even more shrill. His whole body was pressed into the ground by palm prints. There was no appearance at all... Who dares to believe it. He is the incarnation of a cosmic miracle!</p>

    <p>"This man is not simple. He is not afraid of facing the Holy King with his soul body. It seems that Bai Zhe should have trained him as a key secret weapon." At this time, the voice of the old monk incarnated in the Biangan tree came again. The vast reverberation has a sense of heaviness. There will be a feeling of respect that people will unconsciously feel.</p>

    <p>But this effect was useless to Wang Ling. After contacting Zhuo Yi, he remembered that there was such a cosmic miracle beside him that he was lingering on.</p>

    <p>The Bian Shu tree has a long history. It has witnessed the rise and fall of the universe. Naturally, it has also seen the death of dragons. Wang Ling thought that maybe this old monk could know something: "How much do you know."</p>

    <p>The voice of Wang Ling immediately sounded in the mental universe. He asked directly and clearly.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, the old monk chuckled and replied naughtily: "If I can answer it, can I stay with you?"</p>

    <p>"You answer first..."</p>

    <p>Bian Shu: "The three leaders of the Dragon Clan. Yueguang, Cangyuan, and Dark Devour. Bai Zhe has now inherited the Yueguang Dragon orthodoxy. In order to ensure that his position is stable, he will definitely not release the two orthodox traditions of Cangyuan and Dark Devour."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying was puzzled. He directly joined the conversation in the mental universe: "But the inheritance of Taoism can be superimposed. If in order to stabilize his position, according to his personality, he should swallow the Taoism of the other two chief dragons together."</p>

    <p>Bian Shu shook his head and said: "The Dragon Clan's orthodoxy is too overbearing. A group of dragons has no leader. One mountain cannot accommodate two tigers. But back then, when the Dragon Clan was at its peak, there were three leaders. Don't you think it's strange? The Dragon Clan's orthodoxy is too overbearing. He forcibly swallows the orthodoxy of the other two leader dragons. This will create a counterbalance and weaken his own combat power."</p>

    <p>"That's it. So it's better not to inherit." Wang Ying raised his eyebrows. He found that the old man on the other side of the tree still had something. He was like a walking encyclopedia. And he answered whatever he asked. It was comparable to a human flesh search engine.</p>

    <p>Much better than the self-talking Apple before.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying: "That's what you mean. Do you think Qiao Yanyuan is related to the other two leaders of the Dragon Clan?"</p>

    <p>"Perhaps. Although he has not shown any traces now, as a new dragonborn, such combat power is too unusual. Under Bai Zhe's arrangement, he may have inherited both Cangyuan and Dark Devour."</p>

    <p>Bian Shu said: "Although it can make his combat power surpass that of other dragon descendants., there are limitations due to conflicting traditions. In the end, he is destined to be unable to surpass Bai Zhe who is dedicated to inheriting one tradition."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying: "But what's going on with Wang Muyu? He has all the Dragon genes. So there's no conflict?"</p>

    <p>Bian Shu smiled: "He is different."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying: "What's the difference?"</p>

    <p>Bian Shu: "This little guy was born under the watchful eye of Ling Zhenren. In a sense, his existence itself is a miracle of the universe. If Wang Muyu hadn't been well protected by you, Bai Zhen focused on cultivating him. The target will definitely not be Qiao Yanyuan. This little guy's growth rate is amazing. If he were in the age of dragons, he might become the new Dragon King."</p>

    <p>"What about now? For example, compared to this one."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying asked curiously. He actually had a scale in his heart, but he still wanted to hear Bian Shu's opinion.</p>

    <p>Bian Shu chuckled: "Didn't Ling Zhenren send him to the Daxi Ling Sea? You will know the answer soon."</p>
