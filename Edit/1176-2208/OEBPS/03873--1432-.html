  <h1>Chapter 1432. Can it be killed instantly? It's hard!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The Buddha's fire was golden when it began to condense. The monk dispersed the three groups of Buddha's fire and transformed them into three different strange colors.</p>

    <p>Past, present, and future. Three groups of Buddhist fire condensed on the monk's heavenly spirit cap. They circled around the monk's purple and gold cassock.</p>

    <p>Gray Buddha Fire: represents the past.</p>

    <p>It symbolizes the road that has been traveled. You can miss the past, but you don't have to be attached to the past. The meaning of gray is: if you have been attached to it, let go of it. If you have been concerned, no worries...</p>

    <p>Green Buddha Fire: represents the present.</p>

    <p>I have best wishes for a smooth future.</p>

    <p>And the white Buddha fire: represents the future.</p>

    <p>Symbolizes unpredictability and various uncertainties.</p>

    <p>The three fires gathered together like three flowers gathering at the top. Suddenly, the monk's momentum suddenly became different.</p>

    <p>"Bald Donkey. I'm going to be serious. I will definitely kill you with the next blow..."</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren squinted his eyes. Stars bloomed all over his body. Thousands of rays of light. The starlight under his feet gathered like a storm. He transformed into a huge unicorn mount!</p>

    <p>This is a magic mount summoned with powerful abilities!</p>

    <p>The monk thought it was still a star dragon. Unexpectedly, it turned out to be a unicorn.</p>

    <p>"The dual appearance of dragon and unicorn..." The monk frowned slightly. He looked at the young man in front of him who was surrounded by stars and seemed to be one body. There was a trace of movement in his calm expression that was invisible to the naked eye.</p>

    <p>As the only disciple of Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren is indeed the proudest man of all time.</p>

    <p>The imperial dharma like dragon and unicorn can appear in one person at the same time.</p>

    <p>If anyone else were here they would be scared out of their wits.</p>

    <p>"Kill!" He stood on the top of the Qilin's head. Holding the Qilin's horn with one hand, he urged his mount. It was like a rapidly falling mountain crushing towards the monk. The Qilin's front hooves lifted up and it suddenly crashed down!</p>

    <p>The star dragon mark on the body bursts out with light. The twin methods are superimposed on each other. The power is infinite!</p>

    <p>At the same moment, Wang Ling was also calmly observing the battle from the front line through King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>"It's really strong. At least the special effects are enough." Er Ha watched with fear.</p>

    <p>As far as the scene is concerned, the showdown between Peng Xiren and the monk seems to be no less than the previous showdown between Wang Ling and Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>The image projected by King's Eyes can also convey the sense of oppression here very realistically.</p>

    <p>"Coming from the infinite galaxy. He is also the first disciple of Dao Ancestor Wang. He is indeed extraordinary." Er Ha sighed while observing the reaction of someone next to him.</p>

    <p>To be honest, after seeing Peng Xiren's strength, Er Ha suddenly had a doubt in his heart...I don't know if Wang Ling can beat Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>But this concern was quickly dispelled.</p>

    <p>Because Wang Ling was on the side. There was never the slightest wave of emotion on his face.</p>

    <p>It's as if you are just watching a big movie with ordinary special effects.</p>

    <p>No waves. In fact, this is the best reaction.</p>

    <p>This proves that at least against Peng Xiren. His master's strength is definitely not inferior to him...</p>

    <p>So now comes the problem.</p>

    <p>Even if he can beat him, can this Peng Xiren be killed instantly like the previous ones...</p>

    <p>It was so curious that it couldn't help but look at Wang Ling and asked: "How is it?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "Can this person be killed instantly?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "It's difficult."</p>

    <p>"It's difficult?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha looked incredulous.</p>

    <p>It was extremely surprised. It didn't expect that the leader it had known for so long would actually give such an answer.</p>

    <p>But now that I have said that, it seems...this Peng Xiren is indeed no ordinary person.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying couldn't help laughing. She looked at Er Ha: "What are you thinking? What the Lord means is, this Peng Xiren. It's hard not to be killed by him instantly."</p>

    <p>"..." Er Ha was shocked.</p>

    <p>So this is the true meaning of "difficult?"</p>

    <p>God is so difficult!</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "This is Dao Ancestor..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying: "Dao Ancestor. What's wrong? It's Dao Ancestor. Don't you need to be slapped?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "But I clearly saw Little Master Ling looking embarrassed..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying: "He thinks it's too monotonous to slap him to death every time. He doesn't know what to do."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>"Also..."</p>

    <p>When Wang Ying said this, his eyes dimmed and he said no more.</p>

    <p>And there is.</p>

    <p>The origin of the fortune teller is undoubtedly Peng Xiren...</p>

    <p>This account needs to be settled.</p>

    <p>And judging from the current situation, there is a lot of other information about Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>It would be a pity to kill him directly.</p>

    <p>It's best to beat him to death.</p>

    <p>So the blood pressure line is very important...</p>

    <p>This is the problem that Wang Ling. is having a headache about.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. The battle between Peng Xiren and the monk continues. The Unicorn Dharma form traveled across the sky, and its hooves stomped down. The monk's body was torn apart. It was crushed into gold dust.</p>

    <p>"It's a fake body." However, Peng Xiren is indeed Peng Xiren. As the only disciple of Dao Ancestor Wang, he could see through the monk's trick of using fake bodies at a glance.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren was able to complete the act of changing the civet cat for the prince under his nose. The monk's magic power really had to make Peng Xiren admire him.</p>

    <p>"Monk, you can't get rid of me... In the cosmic environment, all the stars are my eyes." Although he still couldn't see the monk, he clearly knew the location of the monk's true body.</p>

    <p>Previously, the monk used three balls of Buddha fire to cover himself.</p>

    <p>These three kinds of Buddhist fire, which control the power of the past, present and future, can distort time and space, thereby diluting one's own sense of space existence.</p>

    <p>But such tricks obviously cannot fool Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>"Poor monk. Right here."</p>

    <p>And when the monk stood in front of Peng Xiren again, Peng Xiren discovered that the monk was pointing his head at him.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren actually didn't understand what the monk wanted to do. He couldn't help laughing: "Monk, do you want to hit me with the iron head skill? I'm afraid you can't withstand my physical strength. Use your head to hit me." You're just digging your own grave."</p>

    <p>He just finished speaking.</p>

    <p>Ahead, where the monk's head was, there was suddenly a "click, click, click, click" sound like a machine gun. Blue fire quickly erupted...</p>

    <p>Tens of thousands of missiles appear from the six scars on the monk's head. These "missiles" are only the size of a pen. But each one contains amazing terrifying energy!</p>

    <p>What is this...</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren was confused by the monk's behavior. To be honest, he was shocked.</p>

    <p>These missiles fired from the "ring scar" on the monk's head are incredibly powerful and full of unimaginable power!</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that Peng Xiren actually smelled the smell of heavenly calamity from the product.</p>

    <p>"This monk can actually summon heavenly calamity with his own power?" Peng Xiren frowned. He felt a little hard to understand.</p>

    <p>This heavenly calamity is a divine power that naturally arises when one's realm exceeds one's realm! The higher the realm, the more powerful the heavenly calamity one faces.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren remembers when he jumped from Dao God to Dao Ancestor. The scene was too exaggerated. He almost died in that disaster!</p>

    <p>And now, the "missiles" fired by the monk from the scar are exactly the same as the power of his Tribulation Transcendence!</p>

    <p>How is this done?</p>

    <p>The monk couldn't help but laugh: "This is the poor monk. He has been reincarnated for nearly four thousand lives. He has absorbed the power of the tribulation... Now, the poor monk will shoot them all out. I will give you a wave of rockets!"</p>
