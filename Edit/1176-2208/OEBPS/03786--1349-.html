  <h1>Chapter 1349 Messy Love House</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The function of {Single Spell} is actually to block confession and reverse the psychological effect.</p>

    <p>As long as the spell is in a state of blessing, the various courtships and confessions that the spellcaster receives during this period are all in reverse operation!</p>

    <p>"Like" will become "hate." "Advantages" will become "disadvantages..."</p>

    <p>Take the last time Sun Rong confessed to himself. (For a review of the previous situation, see Chapter 1090: {Methods to Attract Attention})</p>

    <p>Mainly because Wang Ling didn't expect Sun Rong to imitate Xia Ming.</p>

    <p>When she said the word "hate."</p>

    <p>Because of the effect of the magic blessing, it instantly became "like."</p>

    <p>However, this "reverse loophole." Wang Ling has now been filled.</p>

    <p>In other words, the current {Single Curse} will never be the same as last time.</p>

    <p>Moreover. Wang Ling also added a little bit of news. It improved the reversal psychological effect of {Single Curse}.</p>

    <p>When someone confesses his love, the confessor will not only say something completely opposite to what he expresses, but will even slap the other person... fully realizing the characteristics of "being single based on his strength."</p>

    <p>But now the effect of this spell falls on Liu Qingyi. This is something Wang Ling did not expect.</p>

    <p>What a coincidence.</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi actually walked out of the crowd and stood in front of the passerby couple...</p>

    <p>But the problem is. Gu Shunzhi and Liu Qingyi are actually a fake couple!</p>

    <p>Now even Wang Ling doesn't know what will happen next...</p>

    <p>In short, the Shura field in the Love Pavilion today is extremely amazing.</p>

    <p>Even Wang Ling was secretly observing from the side. He still felt like he was trembling.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When Liu Qingyi came to the Love Pavilion.</p>

    <p>She looked through the glass wall in front of her and saw Wang Zhen with another strange woman.</p>

    <p>A burst of fire surged from my heart instantly!</p>

    <p>But soon, the woman's reason defeated the sudden fire.</p>

    <p>Since she can find Gu Shunzhi as a fake boyfriend, then Wang Zhen can naturally find a woman to pretend to be his fake girlfriend.</p>

    <p>This guy... what the hell is he doing!</p>

    <p>In fact, when she thought of this, Liu Qingyi was not angry. Instead, she felt a little happy.</p>

    <p>"You were quite angry just now. Why now?" Liu Qingyi's face changed so quickly that Gu Shunzhi looked shocked.</p>

    <p>"Think about it. In fact, this idiot's thinking mode is the same as mine. They both found a fake partner to pretend to be. They want to make the other party jealous first. This proves that our brain circuits are actually quite compatible." At this time, Liu Qingyi Laugh.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>After listening to this, Gu Shunzhi just wanted to slap himself!</p>

    <p>Sure enough, he was so smart that he was misled by his cleverness. He should not have told Wang ZhenLiu that Qingyi found him to pretend to be her boyfriend in the first place!</p>

    <p>But things...</p>

    <p>It has already happened to this point.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi still wanted to struggle: "How can you be sure that the girl in it is fake? What if she is a real girlfriend?"</p>

    <p>"Real girlfriend?"</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi glanced coldly at Fang Xing, who was in the feminine state inside. He chuckled: "Wang Zhen is the young master of the Wang family after all. What kind of girl has he not seen when he was in God's Domain? How could he find such a popular face as his girlfriend? ?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Gu Shunzhi raised his head and glanced at the female form Fang Xing.</p>

    <p>In her feminine state, Fang Xing has a unique style. She definitely can't be called a popular face. Her sexy and plump body curves make even the many male practitioners with Taoist companions in the room look at her with their imaginations...</p>

    <p>"Is it really popular?" Gu Shunzhi's mouth twitched.</p>

    <p>"Isn't this a public face? Although I have never met this girl, she feels familiar! As if I have met her somewhere. Usually people who feel this way are not public faces." Liu Qingyi Shrugging, it seemed as if he didn't take the female Fang Xing seriously as an opponent at all.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi felt that Liu Qingyi's terror was beyond words.</p>

    <p>All I can say is, my fucking intuition is amazingly strong!</p>

    <p>It took just one glance to see through so many things...</p>

    <p>At this time, Liu Qingyi suddenly took Gu Shunzhi's hand and touched it forward.</p>

    <p>This angle is just enough for Wang Zhen to see them.</p>

    <p>She had noticed that Wang Zhen had looked in their direction from the corner of his eye.</p>

    <p>He immediately put his hands around Gu Shunzhi's neck and started his own plan of action: "Then let's get started?"</p>

    <p>"Start... start what..." Gu Shunzhi looked nervous.</p>

    <p>His mother is too close!</p>

    <p>It was so close that Gu Shunzhi could feel her mother's breathing and heartbeat!</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi turned his face away. He was afraid that if he was not careful, his mother would kiss her...</p>

    <p>Although when Gu Shunzhi was just born, his "first kiss" had already been taken away by Liu Qingyi.</p>

    <p>But now he is so old! Of course he can no longer accept kisses from his mother.</p>

    <p>"It stands to reason. Aren't you the orderlies who have read countless people? Why are you so nervous?" Liu Qingyi thought Gu Shunzhi's reaction was a bit funny.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi subconsciously dodged back.</p>

    <p>In fact, that was not a young boy's reaction.</p>

    <p>But Gu Shunzhi's instinctive respect for his "real mother."</p>

    <p>However, it is a pity that in Liu Qingyi's opinion, Gu Shunzhi's reaction is no different from that of young boys who fall in love for the first time.</p>

    <p>"You're too nervous. Forget it. I won't kiss you." Liu Qingyi sighed.</p>

    <p>She really wanted to kiss Gu Shunzhi. And she even wanted to stick out her tongue.</p>

    <p>But seeing Gu Shunzhi's reaction.</p>

    <p>Suddenly she couldn't help it.</p>

    <p>"You still plan to kiss me..." Gu Shunzhi was shocked.</p>

    <p>"They are all adults. What's wrong with a kiss?" Liu Qingyi said with a smile.</p>

    <p>At this moment, she took...</p>

    <p>A momentary glance at Wang Zhen: "Look at this pair inside, how well they are acting. This borrowed position can be said to be seamless."</p>

    <p>"You can see this..." Gu Shunzhi was shocked again.</p>

    <p>"After all, I've been here before. If it's a real kiss, the surface temperature of the two people will continue to rise. This will make the surrounding air dry, which will affect the air humidity to a certain extent."</p>

    <p>"I have already practiced it to the point where I can judge whether the other person is really kissing based on the humidity of the surrounding air."</p>

    <p>"???"</p>

    <p>"Then, then we will start as well, Gu Shunzhi."</p>

    <p>At this time, Liu Qingyi returned his gaze to Gu Shunzhi's face and cupped Gu Shunzhi's cheeks with his hands.</p>

    <p>"Didn't you say you don't want to kiss..."</p>

    <p>"You're too nervous. The kiss would be too fake. It's better to do this. Just confess your love to me. But you have to say it out loud, okay?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Liu Qingyi posed another problem to Gu Shunzhi.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Confess to my mother...</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi now particularly regrets that he agreed to Liu Qingyi pretending to be her boyfriend!</p>

    <p>Confessing love to your biological mother... is simply outrageous!</p>

    <p>"Are you going to say it or not?"</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi looked at Gu Shunzhi with great pressure.</p>

    <p>At this time, Gu Shunzhi really couldn't withstand the pressure. He already had the idea of revealing the truth in his heart.</p>

    <p>But he hasn't said it yet.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Liu Qingyi's eyes darkened: "It's so hard... you don't say it, I will!"</p>

    <p>Later, Gu Shunzhi met.</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi suddenly held his face and began to confess her love loudly in front of everyone: "Bah! You two-legged scumbag! Come on!"</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi: "???"</p>

    <p>When he said this, even Liu Qingyi himself was shocked!</p>

    <p>Because this is not what she wanted to say at all!</p>

    <p>However, before she could explain, her right hand stretched out uncontrollably.</p>

    <p>Snap!</p>

    <p>The next moment, a crisp slap came.</p>

    <p>It was Liu Qingyi who slapped Gu Shunzhi on the face.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi was not prepared at all.</p>

    <p>After being severely beaten by his own mother, he flew out on the spot. He broke the glass wall of the love pavilion and hit the pool.</p>

    <p>Wow! Suddenly, water splashed everywhere, and a huge water column rushed up.</p>

    <p>Several sea lions were frightened and fainted on the spot...</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Zhen was shocked.</p>

    <p>Didn't you agree to pretend to be your boyfriend to make him jealous?</p>

    <p>Why did Gu Shunzhi suddenly become a "scumbag?"</p>

    <p>"Brother Fang, what kind of trick is this?" Wang Zhen pushed Fang Xing with his elbow.</p>

    <p>Next to him, Fang Xing was also confused: "I'm sorry. I don't understand either..."</p>
