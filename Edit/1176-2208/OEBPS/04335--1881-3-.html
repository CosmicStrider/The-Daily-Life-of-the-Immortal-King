  <h1>Chapter 1881 The long-planned usurper</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Mrs. Shanxiu's words can be said to explain many things that were previously unsolved for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>For example, given Dao Ancestor Wang's highly respected status in the world of cultivation, why would he choose a rebellious person like Peng Xiren as his disciple?</p>

    <p>After all, choosing a disciple cannot just be based on talent. Moral character is also very important.</p>

    <p>And now looking at it all together, Peng Xiren is just a usurper claiming to be a disciple of Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>Because of the promise he made, Dao Ancestor Wang had to accept it and transmit his orthodoxy to him.</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect the situation to be like this..."</p>

    <p>Even Emperor Dongda was surprised when he heard this result. The Peng family, which had risen newly in the past hundred years, and the other four emperors had paid attention to it. But they did not expect that the Peng family was actually making such an idea.</p>

    <p>"Seniors, I suddenly thought of a possibility." At this time, Sun Rong suddenly said. The look on her face was extremely solemn.</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun, please speak." Emperor Dongda nodded, looking like he was all ears.</p>

    <p>"I'm thinking... what if King Tiankun's death, including Peng Xiren's subsequent fight for the Book of Nine Realms, are actually within the trajectory of history?"</p>

    <p>I have to say. Sun Rong put forward a very bold idea. It shocked the hearts of everyone present. Everyone looked at each other in confusion.</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda asked: "This... you mean... is still within the historical trajectory?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong nodded obediently. Then she analyzed it unhurriedly: "That's what I think. In fact, the process of the diary was experienced by us, including Emperor Dongda himself, for the first time. Although it is written above what will happen. And it is true that things have not developed according to what was written in the diary. It seems to have deviated from the historical trajectory. But if all this was designed by the senior who wrote the diary, then there are two different theories."</p>

    <p>"Since that senior has the power to write this diary that spans the timeline, he must also have the power to influence the development of the trajectory. And if he has planned the death of King Tiankun, and Peng Xiren will seize the Book of Nine Realms thing. Then everything else will actually fall into place."</p>

    <p>"As for what I mentioned above, there is actually evidence for it. After all, Peng Xiren did inherit the Taoist tradition of Dao Ancestor Wang when he was in the modern cultivation society. And this Taoist tradition is very pure. It is obviously not the yin of the Book of Nine Realms. The volume gave him the power."</p>

    <p>"This..."</p>

    <p>Everyone was stunned when they heard this. Wang Zhen took a closer look and felt that Sun Rong's words really had some truth: "What Rongrong said is actually quite logical. And how do I feel about it? Rather than saying that the person who was clearly arranged was the dead King Tiankun, it would be better to say it was Peng Xiren."</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi also nodded quickly. Agreeing with Wang Zhen's opinion: "Yeah. It makes sense. After all, in the timeline of modern cultivation society. Even if Peng Xiren inherits Dao Ancestor Wang's orthodoxy, he will still be beaten by Senior Wang? ... In other words, it is very likely that this orthodoxy was deliberately inherited by him in our timeline."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Wang Ying: "..."</p>

    <p>That's so!</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Ling had to secretly exclaim that Sun Rong is a genius...</p>

    <p>He just wanted to find out the master behind the mysterious article. But he ignored this logical connection.</p>

    <p>Yes. This Peng Xiren has completed the inheritance of the Taoist tradition in the modern cultivation society. And even if he has obtained the Taoist tradition of Dao Ancestor Wang, it is not as strong as he imagined.</p>

    <p>Taoism is a good thing. It can allow a cultivator to greatly improve his cultivation level in a short period of time. It is equivalent to the ancestor giving him a meal.</p>

    <p>But Taoism also has limitations.</p>

    <p>Because if Peng Xiren has a talent that surpasses Dao Ancestor Wang, then inheriting Dao Ancestor Wang's orthodoxy will be a shackle for Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>And now it actually proves this point.</p>

    <p>Because Peng Xiren looked down upon the orthodox Book of Nine Realms. Instead, he was more interested in the replica of the Yin Scroll. After all, the Yin Scroll contained the power of the old world, which could double-bless his strength. Has endless possibilities.</p>

    <p>After analyzing this point, the situation in front of them seems to be infinitely clear. But facing the script that has completely deviated from the trajectory of the diary, Wang Ling finally knows how to bring the final conclusion to this plot from the eternal world.</p>

    <p>"It seems that we still have to watch the meeting of the Four Emperors tomorrow."</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ying looked around and said: "It is impossible that the West Emperor was unaware of the death of King Tiankun. Given the conflict between the West Emperor and the East Emperor, under normal circumstances, they would have come to seek revenge. But There is currently no movement from Emperor Xi. This only shows one thing. That is Emperor Xi has also thought of this. Therefore... he did not take action."</p>

    <p>"So. The forces that Peng Xiren belongs to will still take action next."</p>

    <p>You Yueqing also said. She tried hard to straighten her posture and control her snake body. Although moving was no different from walking on two legs under normal circumstances, this abrupt feeling was still there all the time.</p>

    <p>"This Peng Xiren doesn't know that the Yin Scroll has been transferred by King Tiankun in advance. And it is in the hands of Mrs. Shanxiu. So the biggest possibility now is that he will come to snatch the Yang Scroll directly, and then use the magic weapon or secret technique of the old world. Make another copy of the Yin scroll!"</p>

    <p>"What Master You said is absolutely correct."</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ying's eyes met You Yueqing's. This Taoist priest was young but very witty.</p>

    <p>At this time, on the other side, Zhang Zhui also came over with the Yin scroll given by Mrs. Shanxiu. Mrs. Shanxiu was a person of her word. Not only did she explain the whole story, but she also directly presented the Yin scroll.</p>

    <p>She is not stupid. This thing in her hand is like an invisible time bomb. And as an orthodox and upright cultivator, she has no intention of opening it and taking a look.</p>

    <p>No cultivator with normal thinking would hope that the terrifying civilization of the old world would be revived in the eternal world of cultivation... That period of history was full of darkness and distortion. It should honestly become history forever, sealed in the long river of time.</p>

    <p>"What should I do? How should I deal with this thing?" Zhang Zhui took the initiative to hand over the scroll.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling also took advantage of the situation and took the Yin Scroll. He had no intention of opening it to see. Although he was curious about the old world, Wang Ling now knew very well that he was representing the future cultivators.</p>

    <p>So he didn't think much. A dazzling black and white flame immediately rose in his hand. With a bang, the scroll was burned into ashes.</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda couldn't help but feel his Adam's apple rolling. He didn't expect that the dark scroll of the Book of Nine Realms would be burned so easily... What kind of method was this?</p>

    <p>In the past few days, the methods that the senior hidden in his body has repeatedly used have exceeded Dongda's own cognition.</p>

    <p>Especially when Dongda just heard people around him saying that Peng Xiren, who inherited Dao Ancestor Wang's orthodoxy, was still being hung up and beaten by this senior king in the modern world of cultivation, Dongda's heart was filled with mixed emotions.</p>

    <p>Who is Dao Ancestor Wang...</p>

    <p>This is the legend and pearl of the eternal world of cultivation!</p>

    <p>Such a person actually made this group of people completely devoid of awe... it's too scary.</p>

    <p>Even Emperor Dongda himself began to have some doubts.</p>

    <p>This is the first founder of cultivation. Is he Dao Ancestor Wang...</p>
