  <h1>Chapter 1905 Damn Peng Xiren</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"It's actually the Que King Sword?"</p>

    <p>In the underground darkroom deep in the inner courtyard of the Peng family headquarters, Peng Xiren was sitting on a wide bench. While sipping tea, he looked at the picture projected by the magic ball in front of him. All the scenes of Peng Beicen's marriage in front of him. It's all in sight.</p>

    <p>According to common sense, the younger sister chooses her husband. As an older brother, he should also help. But Peng Xiren thinks that there is no need at all now.</p>

    <p>Sister is just a prop that can be used at critical moments to verify the path of cultivation he has chosen. It is also a one-time consumer product and can be discarded at any time after use.</p>

    <p>This has been Peng Xiren's view since he was a child. And he extremely despises those sister-in-laws who hold their sisters in the palm of their hands to protect them.</p>

    <p>At this time, he stared at the picture projected by the magic ball in front of him. Finally, he became somewhat interested in the previous boredom: "Is there no result yet?"</p>

    <p>A black-robed attendant stood on the side. His voice was vicissitudes of life, and his strength was very impressive. He was no weaker than the guards around the emperor: "Master, we have tried our best to investigate, but we still haven't found the true identity of Wang Rongxia."</p>

    <p>"Then I understand." Peng Xiren nodded. He had some realization in his mind: "It's really interesting. They came to propose marriage and came here under a false identity. It seems that their purpose is not simple. It should not only be to marry Bei. Came from Cen."</p>

    <p>"Master suspects that their identities are false?" The black-robed guard was obviously a little surprised by this inference.</p>

    <p>"Other than this answer. There seems to be no other reasonable explanation."</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren smiled slightly: "My Peng family's influence spreads all over the four regions. The areas under the jurisdiction of the four emperors all have my Peng family's informants. If Wang Rongxia is a famous royal family, it is impossible for my Peng family not to pay attention to it."</p>

    <p>"Of course. The above are just my personal guesses. It was only after the other party sacrificed this Que King Sword that I had a definite answer in my heart."</p>

    <p>"The slave dared to ask. What's wrong with this Que King sword?" the black-robed guard bowed and asked.</p>

    <p>"The Que King Sword is a legendary sword. It has a very special origin. Theoretically, only the Four Emperors own it. But now, this sword has fallen into the hands of a servant. Don't you think it's strange?"</p>

    <p>"This..."</p>

    <p>"And look at this servant. Although his clothes conform to the standard, he must have been specially packaged. He doesn't look like a servant at all."</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren analyzed the situation while sipping tea, and directly broke down the situation outside the court: "I have heard about it before. The four emperors are very afraid of the development of my Peng family. They have repeatedly sent people to test. This A gathering of the Four Emperors actually gave them a good opportunity for communication. At the same time, this is something that my Peng family is particularly concerned about... However, if they had a secret meeting before the gathering of the Four Emperors, we would not know."</p>

    <p>"Secret meeting?"</p>

    <p>The black-robed guard looked surprised. He couldn't believe this at all: "This shouldn't be... right?"</p>

    <p>You must know that not long ago, there was a vigorous fight between the Western Emperor and the Eastern Emperor. This resulted in irreconcilable conflicts among the royal families, large, medium and small tribes and casual cultivators of the two regions.</p>

    <p>Now Peng Xiren suddenly put forward such a bold hypothesis. He believed that Wang Rongxia's true identity was a perfect false identity carefully packaged by the four emperors after the secret meeting of the four emperors.</p>

    <p>Such a guess is not a bold one.</p>

    <p>However, after the black-robed guard carefully considered this speculation, he felt that the possibility was not completely impossible...it was just difficult to explain why the two emperors who had been eager to fight as soon as they met suddenly shook hands and made peace. Start The Peng family was targeted with all guns blazing.</p>

    <p>"Master, do you want us to drive them out?"</p>

    <p>"That's not necessary." Peng Xiren shook his head: "He's here. And he dares to use a fake identity. Although I don't know how many emperors are involved in packaging this fake identity. But I think it's very interesting."</p>

    <p>"And this servant chosen by Beicen. At first glance, he is a guard beside a certain emperor. He is also very strong. I know Beicen doesn't want to marry, so she must win this game."</p>

    <p>"If you are not sure about winning, you will use what I gave her when the time comes..."</p>

    <p>Speaking of this, Peng Xiren raised the corners of his mouth. There was a sinister smile in his gloomy expression.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, the huge Peng family headquarters. The battlefield in the inner courtyard has been set up. This was originally a place for the Peng family to practice. The venue is very spacious. Wang Ling took a quick look and measured the space. There were actually twenty people here. It's as big as a football field. And all the terrain is created inside.</p>

    <p>Deserts, lakes, forests, rock walls... In order to satisfy the Peng family's practice for different spiritual roots, everything here has been set up.</p>

    <p>Just one training ground has such a scale. The wealth of the Peng family is really shocking. And this is just one of the training grounds in the Peng family's headquarters.</p>

    <p>The overall area of the Peng family's palace is indeed unimaginable. It is not an exaggeration to say that it is a replica of the imperial palace. In a sense, Wang Ling feels that it is larger than the imperial palaces of the four emperors. Style.</p>

    <p>Peng Beicen was ready for battle. She was standing on a very high rockery, towering above a stone pillar. She was wearing a white robe and holding a cockroach bone sword.</p>

    <p>Her cockroach bone is not a common thing. It is an object made by a famous weapon refiner from the ancient times. It has strong malleability. It is a retractable spiritual sword. When used, it can swallow mountains and rivers like a python and sweep away thousands of armies. Or it is as flexible and flexible as a spiritual snake. It is a spiritual sword with strong comprehensive performance.</p>

    <p>But as we all know, powerful spiritual swords all come from the Sword King Realm. The Sword King Realm in the Eternal Era is still in its infancy.</p>

    <p>At this time, the Cockroach Bone Sword and Sword Spirit already had a ranking in the Sword King Realm. In a sense, the Cockroach Bone Sword and Sword Spirit was also considered one of the ancestors of swords. However, later on, as the spiritual swords in the Sword King Realm became more and more diverse. The art of cockroach bone gradually declined.</p>

    <p>According to the current ranking of the sword rankings, Cockroach Bone's ranking cannot even enter the top one thousand.</p>

    <p>In other words, if it is a normal game, Sun Rong's Aohai can indeed beat Peng Beicen and her cockroach bones.</p>

    <p>However, if the Eternal Spirit Sword is used in the same timeline, it can be used against the Cockroach Bone.</p>

    <p>During this period, Gu Gu was still a very powerful "Sword Ancestor."</p>

    <p>"Are you ready, Mr. Servant?" Peng Beicen showed a gentle smile.</p>

    <p>The next second. She moved.</p>

    <p>His eyes were fixed on the body of Emperor Dongda. It was cut directly across from a strange tilt angle. It was extremely ferocious. This kind of power was more terrifying than a python. It was the power of a dragon! As it swept across, it rolled up all over the sky. Water mist and ice crystals, along with the sweeping trajectory, freeze every inch they pass.</p>

    <p>Are you practicing the dual methods of ice and water?</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda didn't even frown. He didn't even mean to call the sword spirit. He also swung his sword at the trajectory of the cockroach bone.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>Under the edge of the sword, the power of Emperor Dongda alone shot out thousands of feet of sunlight at this moment!</p>

    <p>In this brief moment, Peng Xiren suddenly stood up from the chair. I don't know if it was an illusion.</p>

    <p>Although it was only a short moment.</p>

    <p>He felt like he saw a King Kongque flying in the sky, emitting endless light and heat...</p>
