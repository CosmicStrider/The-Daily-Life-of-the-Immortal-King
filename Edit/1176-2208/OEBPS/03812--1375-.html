  <h1>Chapter 1375: Fishing and catching yourself</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Su Yu didn't expect that she would be blocked like this.</p>

    <p>This classmate Wang is indeed a cautious person. He is more difficult to deal with than Su Yu imagined.</p>

    <p>"Sister? Are you unhappy about something?"</p>

    <p>In front of the dining table, Su Xiao was taking online classes. He saw his sister's sad face and couldn't help but ask.</p>

    <p>"Go to your class well."</p>

    <p>Su Yu scolded lightly.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>This name is actually not unfamiliar to Su Yu.</p>

    <p>Su Yu even met Wang Ling. It's just that Wang Ling may not know it.</p>

    <p>Previously, Number 60 High School had a "censorship incident." The school required parents of students to come to school in person to pick up their children. Su Yu had a face-to-face meeting with Wang Ling when she was picking up Su Xiao.</p>

    <p>Her brother said that although classmate Wang Ling looks cold, he is actually a very good person.</p>

    <p>He is also the mascot of their class. He has represented the school several times and brought glory to Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche asked her to test a boy. She described the boy as heinous. Su Yu didn't know who the boy was before receiving the information.</p>

    <p>Who knows? This turned out to be the classmate of her younger brother Su Xiao. Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, Su Yu felt a little pain in her head.</p>

    <p>Su Yu had never thought about "molesting" her younger brother's classmates.</p>

    <p>She didn't mean to embarrass Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>It's just that Jiang Xiaoche paid her a very high salary.</p>

    <p>If this order can be completed.</p>

    <p>Su Yu can stay away from home for the next few years and do the job of being a waiter that she hates.</p>

    <p>Everything she did was for life.</p>

    <p>Just so that I and my brother can live a better life.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche's side. About an hour later, he received a reply from Su Yu: "I used thirty-six numbers to add, but they were all blocked. I don't have any numbers anymore."</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche was shocked. He stared at Su Yu's news with a look of disbelief: "No one added? Is he so upright? Why don't I believe it so much!?"</p>

    <p>After all, Wang Ling is only 16 years old.</p>

    <p>And Jiang Xiaoche is also a veteran. It is common for young people of this age to be full of energy.</p>

    <p>It is also the age when it is easiest to face all kinds of temptations.</p>

    <p>"I have screenshots here. I have said both soft and hard words when requesting friends. Now I really have no choice [sweat]." Su Yu typed.</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche: "Don't worry. I will pay for the reward."</p>

    <p>"That's good."</p>

    <p>Su Yu nodded. She didn't know who this mysterious boss was.</p>

    <p>He actually spent so much money to do the so-called "test" for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But Su Yu had an intuition. She felt that this person might have something to do with Sun Rong. Maybe he was also the suitor of classmate Sun Rong?</p>

    <p>Or...</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, Su Yu couldn't help but ask: "Excuse me, are you Ms. Sun Rong herself?"</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche: "I'm not..."</p>

    <p>Staring at the phone, Su Yu chuckled. Usually he would be eager to deny it. Nine times out of ten, that's it.</p>

    <p>She has long heard about some campus scandals between Sun Rong and Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>I just didn't expect that Sun Rong would be so interested in Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He also specially made a voice changer and pretended to be a boy. I don't know where he found her and asked her to test Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Su Yu felt that she must have guessed correctly. The burning heart of gossip forced her to speak her truth: "No need to be embarrassed, classmate Sun Rong!"</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche: "..."</p>

    <p>Su Yu: "I actually understand this kind of test of character. Given your family background, you should be more cautious. According to my experience, my classmate Wang is a very pragmatic, honest and dedicated person. He will not be easily The type you are tempted by! Just feel free to get married!"</p>

    <p>Snap!</p>

    <p>After listening, Jiang Xiaoche was so angry that he smashed his phone.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The mission to send Su Yu over for testing failed. But Jiang Xiaoche is still determined to be evil.</p>

    <p>He felt there must be something wrong somewhere.</p>

    <p>After paying Su Yu the reward as agreed, Jiang Xiaoche still planned to continue targeting Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>In fact, he got some inspiration from Su Yu.</p>

    <p>The artificial intelligence matching function of Wukong system is the most suitable match based on the information he entered about Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But for the tags I entered earlier: [Fish-eye], [Frigid], [Sulky], [Emotionless], [Loves to steal other people's women]...</p>

    <p>Some of them are Jiang Xiaoche's own stereotypes of Wang Ling. Some of them are tags added randomly out of jealousy. In fact, they are not objective and fair.</p>

    <p>In an unfair situation, the girl you match will naturally be inaccurate.</p>

    <p>"Why..."</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche sighed.</p>

    <p>He discovered his mistake.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, this discovery was quite timely.</p>

    <p>Then he started to keep telling himself in his mind.</p>

    <p>We must put aside our prejudices, be objective and fair, and write down the shining points of Wang Ling on the label...</p>

    <p>In this way, more accurate girls can be matched through a large database.</p>

    <p>He bit the bullet and deleted the tags he had added randomly. Then he started to re-enter some tags [Fish-eye], [Cold on the outside, hot on the inside] from the perspective of the old man and Su Yu's analysis just now. , [Sultry], [Pragmatic], [Honest], [Down-to-earth], [Undivided], [Beautiful handwriting], [Fair-skinned], [Handsome]...</p>

    <p>While entering tags, Jiang Xiaoche was holding back a mouthful of blood.</p>

    <p>He felt like he was about to suffer internal injuries.</p>

    <p>In order to give a stumbling block to his love rival, he actually had to praise his love rival first...</p>

    <p>This magical operation never imagined that Jiang Xiaoche would happen to him.</p>

    <p>About a few minutes later.</p>

    <p>In front of the computer. Jiang Xiaoche wiped his sweat.</p>

    <p>This time. The labels he entered were objective enough.</p>

    <p>There should be no more problems with the Wukong system.</p>

    <p>Soon, the system's electronic voice prompt came again: "Dear Mr. Jiang. Xiao Kong has recommended a local girl in Songhai City for you. Please check it out."</p>

    <p>This time. The system matching degree is as high as 96%!!</p>

    <p>Opening this girl's information. Jiang Xiaoche couldn't help but rub his eyes.</p>

    <p>He was sure that he saw it correctly.</p>

    <p>Because the girl in the photo is actually somewhat similar to Sun Rong...</p>

    <p>But Jiang Xiaoche is sure. This is definitely not Sun Rong himself.</p>

    <p>"So there are actually such similar people in this world?" Jiang Xiaoche showed his starry eyes.</p>

    <p>He didn't know what it felt like to fall in love at first sight.</p>

    <p>But now. He is sure... that he has fallen in love with this girl!</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying!</p>

    <p>What a name!</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche was talking about this girl's information.</p>

    <p>Then he quickly sent a friend request message to the girl named Jiang Yingying: "Miss, do you want to date me?"</p>

    <p>3 seconds later...</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche was directly blocked.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>This scene also made Wang Ling sigh on the screen.</p>

    <p>Late at night, I inexplicably received more than 30 explicit messages from friends...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling also knew that someone must be causing trouble.</p>

    <p>Then, he immediately traced it to Jiang Xiaoche and found out that it was Jiang Xiaoche who was "fishing."</p>

    <p>Pity.</p>

    <p>Some people catch themselves while fishing...</p>
