  <h1>Chapter 1806 Unimagined Road 2</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The feeling of being used as a pawn is not pleasant. From the moment Levi started cooperating with the church after becoming the president of the Chilan Society, he also imagined what the church would do with him if one day it felt that he was useless.</p>

    <p>He originally thought that the church would be as kind-hearted as the Holy Mother and would talk a little bit about martial ethics. However, he unexpectedly abandoned the Chilan Society as a whole. It is still the church's first choice when encountering related problems.</p>

    <p>If it weren't for Lawen, Levi felt that he might have turned into a stinking, rotting corpse. He would have been randomly abandoned in a hidden corner of the street. Then he would slowly turn into white bones and be eaten by the wild dogs in Glio City.</p>

    <p>So. Levi's at this time.</p>

    <p>He hates.</p>

    <p>I really want to kill the Arch Pope.</p>

    <p>If we really take action, it may not be possible to achieve this.</p>

    <p>This is because the Arch Pope is not very powerful. It is just because of his status and the protection of experts around him. Under normal circumstances, it is very rare for the Arch Pope to escape alone. He may only relax his guard when entering a friend's home.</p>

    <p>But who are the friends of the Arch Pope?</p>

    <p>Just a few hours ago, the arrogant and domineering Mai Keasi was one. The leader of the Heavenly Dao League group, Pei Luoqi, was another... With these two peerless masters as friends, there is no need to consider safety when going to their homes. problem.</p>

    <p>So to sum up, there are actually very few opportunities to find the Arch Pope alone. Levis is well aware of the stakes involved. Admittedly, he is just thinking about it to relieve his resentment. He is not really going to kill this person. Damn old man.</p>

    <p>"President Li, there is no need to be so angry. From now on, our sincere cooperation is the best way to go." Mrs. Lawen smiled again at this time. Her face was full of wealth and wealth, and she seemed to be very elastic when she smiled.</p>

    <p>Levis could only smile bitterly. When he first saw Lawen, he felt that this woman with a hidden smile was not easy to deal with. But he didn't expect that her scheming would be so deep.</p>

    <p>In recent years, he has been running a large chain of supermarkets under the guise of a variety show producer. It seems that he is doing a fair business, but behind the scenes he is running a variety of black industries.</p>

    <p>Levis looked at the standing white warriors around him and felt a deep irony.</p>

    <p>That's all...</p>

    <p>The current situation is not conducive to him.</p>

    <p>We can only think of ways to make concessions and make concessions first, and then discuss it in the long term.</p>

    <p>What belongs to him. He, Levi's, will get it back sooner or later...</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, Levis took the initiative to stand up and extended his hand very gentlemanly: "Then Mrs. Lawen, I hope we can cooperate sincerely in the future."</p>

    <p>He tried his best to suppress the sharp look in his eyes and lowered his head.</p>

    <p>At this time, Lawen also stretched out her hand and shook it back with Levi: "President Li is indeed a smart man. We will cooperate sincerely. Whether it is the Huaguo Shuilian Group or the Office of Strategic Deception, we will catch them all..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the way back to the villa, Levi's head hurt. He poured himself a glass of tequila. He took the wine glass to the glass sliding door of the living room and looked at the bright moon outside the window.</p>

    <p>Looking up at the stars and thinking about life. This is something Levi often does. His peripheral vision swept across the moonlit courtyard in front of him, which looked like it was covered by a layer of white gauze. Suddenly, he caught a white figure.</p>

    <p>This white figure was hiding behind a bush in the courtyard. It seemed that he was ambushing someone.</p>

    <p>And the first thing he thought of was Lawen's white warriors.</p>

    <p>This Lawen...</p>

    <p>Levi's angrily crushed the wine glass in his hand into powder.</p>

    <p>On the surface, they said they were sincerely cooperating, but secretly, they sent white warriors to his home to hunt him down?</p>

    <p>Levis was furious.</p>

    <p>He was running spiritual power in his palms. He condensed the spiritual power directly into the shape of a blade in his hand, and then threw it violently forward!</p>

    <p>Chi!</p>

    <p>The extremely fast speed left no room for the white warrior in front to react. This small flying knife made of spiritual power directly pierced the white warrior's forehead.</p>

    <p>Levi's intention was to kill. He didn't leave any room for it. Even if Lawen found out afterwards, he wasn't afraid.</p>

    <p>It is illegal to break into the house without his consent!</p>

    <p>Speaking of which, Levi felt it was ridiculous. He was the leader of the largest mafia organization in Glio City. He did not expect that at this time, he would actually have to protect himself from a legal perspective.</p>

    <p>If he had not chosen to follow the path of the president of the Chilan Society, but had become a good and law-abiding citizen, even if his life would be worse than it is now, he would at least be stable enough, right?</p>

    <p>Levi sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p>He pressed the button, opened the sliding door leading to the courtyard, and walked into the body of the white warrior little by little.</p>

    <p>At this time, Levi's had prepared corpse-turning water. This was one of the usual methods of the mafia. It was designed to wipe out everything without leaving any trace after such an accident.</p>

    <p>He was about to dump the body. But at this moment, he suddenly found that the face of the body seemed a bit familiar...</p>

    <p>Levi's mind went blank at first.</p>

    <p>Then he was completely shocked.</p>

    <p>This...</p>

    <p>This is...</p>

    <p>--The--Grand--Pope!?</p>

    <p>At this moment, his mind was like thunder exploding.</p>

    <p>And he never figured out why the Arch Pope would appear in his courtyard wearing the clothes of a white warrior...</p>

    <p>But one thing is for sure.</p>

    <p>The Arch Pope has been killed by him</p>

    <p>And he used a flying knife made from spiritual power to pierce his head.</p>

    <p>As long as the spiritual gene molecules are extracted from the gene bank and compared with him during the autopsy later, he will never be able to escape Yuan Zun's sanctions.</p>

    <p>How could this happen...</p>

    <p>Levi took a few steps back and collapsed on the ground.</p>

    <p>Even though he had seen a lot of big scenes. Even just now, he had dismissed the bad old man in the church and threatened to kill him... But when the Arch Pope really died in front of him, Levi's mind was chaotic inside. He started to feel a little overwhelmed.</p>

    <p>Now. There are too few people he can trust.</p>

    <p>The cooperative church, Lawen, Maiko Assi, including the Heavenly Dao League. He cannot trust these people!</p>

    <p>All are on the side of the Pope!</p>

    <p>He is the weakest force. Even if he wants to frame the blame, there is probably no way...</p>

    <p>And compared to those others, his level is really too low.</p>

    <p>What you need to pay attention to when putting the blame is to make everything real. In other words, if the Arch Pope died at the hands of those people, it would be easy for them to put the blame on him...</p>

    <p>But if you want to turn the blame on yourself, it is simply unrealistic.</p>

    <p>What to do...</p>

    <p>At this time, Levis only had these three words left in his mind.</p>

    <p>He didn't know what to do either.</p>

    <p>After sitting there for a long time, Levis could only think of one solution.</p>

    <p>That is, use the body of the Arch Pope as a pledge of allegiance. Form an alliance with the Huaguo Shuilian Group and the Office of Strategic Deception...</p>

    <p>But the other party may not be willing to accept such cooperation.</p>

    <p>Because once the two are related, the death of the Arch Pope will directly evolve into a huge diplomatic issue between the two Cultivation Countries...</p>
