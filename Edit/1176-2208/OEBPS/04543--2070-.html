  <h1>Chapter 2070: Follow the boss</h1>

  <div>

    <p>On Yama Island at the entrance to the restricted sea area, so many monks gathered here. Such a scene has never been seen before.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui learned that in fact, in the past, many monks would choose to stay on this Yama Island. Like most people, these monks were loose cultivators without belonging. And many of them came from different cultivation countries. But let Zhang Zhui was surprised that so many people from different cultivation countries gathered on such a small island. They all spoke the Mandarin of Huaxiu.</p>

    <p>As we all know, the Chinese culture is extensive and profound. Nowadays, Mandarin has become a common language in the international cultivation world. This just shows the growing international status of Huaxiu.</p>

    <p>It is indeed different from what it used to be...</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui sighed inwardly. Compared to the Eternal Period, although the Eternal Ones at that time were extremely powerful and frequently destroyed planets, they were still in chaos.</p>

    <p>Today's earth. In the world of modern scientific cultivation. With the popularization of the national cultivation education system, people today are living a peaceful and comfortable life. Even though their realm and combat power are not as good as those of eternity, such a life is actually quite good.</p>

    <p>Youdao means simplicity. Smooth and simple daily life can often best reflect the simplest sense of happiness.</p>

    <p>As a person of eternity, the more Zhang Zhui understands modern life, the more he understands why Wang Ling chooses to work silently behind the scenes to protect this world.</p>

    <p>A happy life is hard to come by. It's just that there are always people carrying the burden behind you.</p>

    <p>"I think it's not as if these people are just waiting for the Sword Master?" Zhang Zhui looked around and continued to ask.</p>

    <p>He stared at the monk in front of him and continued to persecute him. He quietly took away the spiritual stones from this man and gave him a bag containing the spiritual stones. The raccoon cat was exchanged for the prince.</p>

    <p>Seeing Zhang Zhui, this man took the initiative to send money again. He was so happy that he couldn't close his mouth. He no longer concealed anything: "It seems that this fellow Taoist is a new arrival. He doesn't know much about the situation on Yama Island. You don't know something. What's ahead? That area of the sea is restricted. But there is a wall."</p>

    <p>"Yes. I know." Zhang Zhui nodded. He has extraordinary strength. Naturally, he can feel the invisible wall of spiritual power.</p>

    <p>"This triangular spiritual wall surrounding the restricted sea area in the Daxi Ling Sea is said to have been built jointly by 119 cultivators. The purpose was to completely block this restricted sea area. That's why they have chosen to commit suicide over the years. Monk, the lowest level is also Soul Formation. This spiritual wall is very high. It is impossible to climb over without Soul Formation."</p>

    <p>As the insider explained, he glanced at the three monks sitting cross-legged in front of him: "Did you see it? Those three people. It is said that they came to the island a long time ago and have been sitting here cross-legged."</p>

    <p>"But their realms have all gone through Soul Formation. They can be easily overcome." Zhang Zhui nodded.</p>

    <p>"It's easy to climb over the wall, but it's not easy to survive in the restricted area. So these three people are waiting for the opportunity." The man added.</p>

    <p>At this point, Zhang Zhui finally understood.</p>

    <p>These three people obviously planned to catch a big boss and follow them to look for opportunities in the restricted area of the sea.</p>

    <p>To put it bluntly, this means that you don't have the guts to take risks alone in the restricted area of the sea. But you have the courage to go to the restricted area of the sea with the help of a big boss and gain experience from behind. Not only do you have the courage, but you are also very brave!</p>

    <p>Although it would be a bit shameless to do so, the problem is to save one's life.</p>

    <p>And truly powerful people are usually quite helpless with this kind of brown candy. The modern world of cultivation emphasizes the rule of law. Powerful people are also very difficult to be trusted. They are always subject to the supervision of public opinion.</p>

    <p>If you rely on your own high level to suppress low-level cultivators, once the video is captured and uploaded to the Internet, then a wave of malicious editing will be carried out, starting from the beginning to the end. A huge public opinion war will soon be set off. A social death scene.</p>

    <p>Regardless of whether you are a powerful person or not, it is certain that you will live on another planet.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Zhang Zhui also discovered that the ancient theory of fighting only is not very feasible in the modern world of cultivation under certain circumstances. The higher the level of people, the more they must have such a sense of caution in words and deeds.</p>

    <p>Because most of the people who hide behind the screen and output wildly are almost shady.</p>

    <p>Very helpless. But this is also reality.</p>

    <p>"Thank you, fellow Taoist."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui patted the man's shoulder. Then he delicately walked towards the three casual cultivators who were sitting cross-legged.</p>

    <p>"Hahaha. Why are you thanking me? Thank you, boss!" The man was also polite. He waved goodbye to Zhang Zhui. He just wanted to count the spiritual stones on his body to see how much he had earned this time. As a result, after counting, he found himself The amount has not changed at all. On the contrary, there are two more bags for spiritual stones...</p>

    <p>What's going on?</p>

    <p>The man looked confused. Then he quickly realized that he had just met a liar!</p>

    <p>What a guy... you actually got information from him!</p>

    <p>But what does this person look like?</p>

    <p>At this time, the poor brother who was deceived was in a daze. He felt that he had lost his memory. Not only could he not remember Zhang Zhui's face, but he also forgot his voice...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Erasing memory is certainly not difficult for Zhang Zhui, the Eternal One. He had already cleared that person's impression of him with just a tap on his shoulder.</p>

    <p>To be fair, he didn't count it as stealing. After all, it was that person's money that he used, and he also returned all the money.</p>

    <p>There is no such kind and innocent person as him in this world.</p>

    <p>He was moved by himself in his heart. He also quickly moved to the side of the three casual cultivators who were meditating.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui knows that two of these three people are about to reach the end of their lives. That is to say, if there is no breakthrough before the end of time, death will be waiting for them once their life span is over.</p>

    <p>And this is why these two casual cultivators who were about to reach their end of life chose to take the risk and enter the restricted sea area.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui finally understood these two people.</p>

    <p>However.</p>

    <p>There are also things he can't understand.</p>

    <p>For example, the third person sitting next to these two Daxian monks.</p>

    <p>This person's aura is restrained. He obviously hides his true realm. And the most important thing is that this person's aura is long and long. It doesn't look like he is about to die at all. Both his realm and lifespan are better than those of the two next to him. He was much higher in cultivation, but now he was sitting here with the same posture as the two people, which made Zhang Zhui feel a little curious.</p>

    <p>He looked at this man with his eyes slightly closed. He was obviously a man, but he had long eyelashes, a straight nose, and skin as fair as jade. His hair was tied up and fell naturally down his head. Even so, he didn't look feminine at all. There was something about the clear edges and corners. Remarkably full of masculinity.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhuixu narrowed his eyes. What surprised him the most was that he couldn't see through this person's face. Because this person was wearing a mask, and with his eyesight, he couldn't see the face under the mask.</p>

    <p>While he was looking around like this, the man wearing a mask opened his eyes and looked sideways at him: "Is something wrong?"</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui looked surprised. He pointed at himself: "You ask me?"</p>

    <p>"Of course I'm asking you."</p>

    <p>The man's voice was cold. His tone could not be said to be tough. Instead, it sounded magnetic and confident.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui became interested and asked hurriedly: "Nothing. I just want to ask if this Taoist friend has any relationship with the two Taoist friends next to him. If not, how about walking with me?"</p>

    <p>He paused. Then he said: "I saw that the upper half of your face looks somewhat similar to an old friend I know."</p>
