  <h1>Chapter 1851 The Wrath of the Goddess</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The huge supreme light Kongque is rising across the sky. The feathers behind it are all spread out. It is like a divine sun rising across the sky. It shines in all directions. It dispels the darkness and brings infinite light.</p>

    <p>And when these rays of light broke through the layers of clouds and haze to shine on the ground, the invisible pressure simultaneously made the few survivors in the field tremble.</p>

    <p>The Eastern Emperor did not kill them all, but left a few of the weakest alive. He needed someone to witness this history, so that all those who coveted the throne of the Eastern Territory would be warned.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Emperor Dongda didn't expect that the effect of "inviting a god to the body" would be so good this time... He didn't know the god he had invited could directly upgrade his Eight-tailed Suzaku to Kongque Mingwang.</p>

    <p>Such strength is obviously above the emperor level...</p>

    <p>The four great emperors from the east, west, south and north can only be regarded as younger brothers in the face of such hard power.</p>

    <p>"Why is this so..."</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect that Emperor Dongda would still hide this trick. King Kongque Ming... is so terrifying..."</p>

    <p>The few surviving elders from the Western Regions looked pale.</p>

    <p>Although they were not dead, they suffered internal injuries and their cultivation levels were set back hundreds of years.</p>

    <p>Even if they have royal blood, this is a sign of serious damage to their vitality. It means that they have lost the qualification to compete for the throne.</p>

    <p>For the Eastern Emperor, this is definitely a glorious battle. Because the appearance of King Kongque not only deterred foreign enemies, but also consolidated the people's hearts. It proved that the Eastern Emperor's destiny was immortal.</p>

    <p>At the same time, those invaders from the Western Region, including the Sun Goddess, would not have thought that the Eastern Emperor, who had always governed the region with kindness, actually had a decisive side to go as far as killing.</p>

    <p>At this time, the Sun Goddess took a few Golden Cores. She attacked the Eastern Emperor again. She never gave up her resistance.</p>

    <p>It was a unique secret medicine given to her by Emperor Xi. It could ignore the pain in a short period of time, recover from injuries, and stimulate the potential in the body.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the damaged tail of the Hydra Suzaku was also quickly restored by the power of the secret medicine. Those severed snake heads grew wildly again. There were still nine. But the shape of the head had changed. It became more savage than before.</p>

    <p>In the end, these snake heads grew dragon horns. Dragon roars came and went, neighing in the sky. With the blessing of the secret medicine, the Sun Goddess directly entered a violent state. She even ran away with the Dharma!</p>

    <p>"The Romance of Dragon and Snake! This is the Nine Dragons and Suzaku!"</p>

    <p>In the distance, some people exclaimed. They all showed incredible expressions when faced with the transformation of the Sun Goddess.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the Sun Goddess was roaring wantonly. The piercing cry was accompanied by the roar of the dragon. It erupted in that petite body with graceful curves. It seemed a little out of place.</p>

    <p>It can be seen that the Sun Goddess is in pain. Because of the secret medicine, her potential has been forced out. Although her combat power has been greatly improved, the powerful medicine in the body also extremely tests the body's tolerance.</p>

    <p>She needs to fight while enduring the pain of her body being torn apart.</p>

    <p>The monks in the east and west regions were shocked. A few secret pills could actually cause the Dharma to change like a dragon and snake. This secret pill definitely contains the blood of an eternal dragon!</p>

    <p>Someone once saw Emperor Xi taking secret medicine to evolve his dharma. This was not as painful as the Sun Goddess.</p>

    <p>From that time on, it became a legend that the Western Emperor had a secret medicine containing dragon blood...</p>

    <p>Many people can't believe this is true.</p>

    <p>Only the power of dragon blood can give Hydra such resonance.</p>

    <p>Compared to before, the aura of the Sun Goddess has improved so much in a short period of time.</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda frowned. At this moment, with the Dharma of King Kongque, he was no longer afraid of anything.</p>

    <p>Out of the same source of friendship, he saw that the Sun Goddess was trying to adapt to the impact of the secret medicine. He did not take action directly. Instead, he deliberately waited for a while.</p>

    <p>Punishing the father of the Sun Goddess for trying to rebel was also a helpless move by the Eastern Emperor. He would not have thought that in the days to come, the Sun Goddess would be targeted by the Emperor of the Western Regions and become a tool for revenge.</p>

    <p>At this time, he was filled with emotions, but the arrow was on the string and he had to shoot.</p>

    <p>After waiting for a while, the Sun Goddess obviously adapted to the pain. The originally ferocious face turned into the most beautiful look again. She used to be like the rising sun, but now she is exuding embers from the setting sun.</p>

    <p>Her snow-white body was covered with traces left by the impact of the secret medicine on her blood vessels, forming faint golden lines that ran down her long and white neck like a print all the way down to her ankles.</p>

    <p>At this time, the goddess of the sun carries a strong aura of twilight. It exudes a smell of death that incinerates everything. It is accompanied by the roar of dragons all around.</p>

    <p>Almost in the blink of an eye, her body moved. As fast as a beautiful dragon. She instantly jumped in front of Emperor Dongda, and aimed at Emperor Dongda's head with her whip leg.</p>

    <p>"Chi!"</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda reacted quickly. He directly raised his left arm and grabbed the snow-white ankle of the Sun Goddess in his hand. The eyes of the woman in front of him were obviously filled with strong anger and hatred.</p>

    <p>She looked calm even when her ankle was grabbed.</p>

    <p>It was another blink of an eye. Fire burst out from the beautiful eyes of the Sun Goddess, and she directly damaged her body, burning her ankles off.</p>

    <p>The beautiful snow-white feet turned into a ball of ashes in the palm of Emperor Dongda...</p>

    <p>Then, her severed foot began to regenerate, returning to its original appearance at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p>

    <p>"Dragon Qi protects the body... Even if the head is broken, it can be restored!" The veterans of the Eastern Region were horrified when they saw it. They never expected that the battle would develop to this point.</p>

    <p>The next moment, the Sun Goddess took action again. The Nine Dragon Suzaku behind her breathed flames.</p>

    <p>Under the cover of the scorching and dazzling fire mist, the Nine Dragons at the end stretched out their long bodies. They used their strongest power to sweep away thousands of armies. They actually formed a body array with their bodies and drilled into the ground of the imperial palace. Deep into the ground of the imperial palace. Deeply rooted in it.</p>

    <p>This is extracting the emperor's luck from the bottom of the Eastern Territory. Together with the spiritual veins in the ground, they are also absorbed by the Nine Dragon Array. They become a steady stream of nutrients for the Sun Goddess.</p>

    <p>Then. The aura of the Sun Goddess became obviously more powerful.</p>

    <p>Everyone was shocked. What kind of terrifying power is this?</p>

    <p>People from the east and west regions were all dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>There is no doubt that this continuous absorption of underground spiritual veins and imperial destiny is an act that injures the enemy one thousand times and damages oneself eight hundred times. Once the body cannot withstand such pressure, there will be a direct danger of bursting.</p>

    <p>But Emperor Dongda suddenly understood what the Sun Goddess was doing at this time.</p>

    <p>He sighed.</p>

    <p>It turns out that from the very beginning, the Sun Goddess had no intention of surviving...</p>

    <p>This is for the purpose of dying directly with him.</p>

    <p>Originally, the Eastern Emperor still had a merciful thought and did not want to kill the Sun Goddess.</p>

    <p>But now, for the sake of his own people, he had to take action...</p>

    <p>He wants to use this Supreme Light Kongque King Ming to eat these nine dragons like earthworms.</p>
