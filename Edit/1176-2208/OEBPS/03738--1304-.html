  <h1>Chapter 1304 Plan to transfer the body</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After getting permission from Boss Sun, the plan to transfer Sun Rong's physical body was carried out in cooperation with Zhuo Yi and the death Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>The entire plan is divided into two parts.</p>

    <p>First: Create a simulated fake body and put it in the medical cabin to hide from others.</p>

    <p>Second: Transfer the girl's real consecrated body to the Office of Strategic Deception and hand it over to Crispy Noodles Dao Lord and Zhenyuan immortals for 24-hour day and night care.</p>

    <p>In the intensive care unit, all monitoring equipment is turned off during the transfer of the physical body.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi waited with death Heavenly Dao for a while. Along with a golden light falling from the sky, a huge cardboard box was accurately delivered here.</p>

    <p>"Zhuo Yi Senior. What is this golden light?" The girl was puzzled.</p>

    <p>"This is Lord Ma. It was originally a toilet in Master's bedroom, and was turned into a spirit by Master's power of illumination. It's very powerful. The royal courier of the Wang family villa."</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling is really amazing..." Sun Rong suddenly realized.</p>

    <p>Since learning more about Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>She thought that no matter what she saw or heard now, she wouldn't be too surprised.</p>

    <p>It wasn't until the cardboard box in front of her was opened that the girl decided to take back what she had said...</p>

    <p>What was contained in the cardboard box was a custom-made prosthetic body that was exactly the same proportion as hers.</p>

    <p>It's said to be fake. But in fact, it doesn't look like it is fake at all.</p>

    <p>The craftsmanship of this fake body is truly extraordinary.</p>

    <p>The facial expression and expression are as if they are real. Even the eyelashes and pores on the face are perfectly restored one to one.</p>

    <p>"Boss Luo's skills are getting better and better." Zhuo Yi marveled at Luo Pangzi's skills.</p>

    <p>"Who is Boss Luo?"</p>

    <p>"The owner of a magic weapon shop. The shop is called Luo Pang Hardware. You can take Sun Rong to have a look later."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi said: "This simulated body is the project that Boss Luo is currently researching."</p>

    <p>Yes. Luo Pangzi has actually been researching projects related to simulated flesh bodies.</p>

    <p>In the beginning, this research topic all started because of "Jingke."</p>

    <p>As an avid fan of Jingke, Luo Pangzi started with the limbs to produce Jingke's simulated robotic arm... which is used to sleep on the head at night. It is said to have the effect of preventing stiff neck and relaxing muscles and activating blood circulation.</p>

    <p>At first glance, Shangqu's research sounds a bit wretched and perverted.</p>

    <p>But who would have thought that Luo Pangzi's research would eventually come in handy.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, as Luo Pangzi's simulation skills continue to improve, replicating the entire human body is no longer a problem for him.</p>

    <p>"This craftsmanship is indeed very high..."</p>

    <p>Inside the Golden Lotus of Buddha. Sun Rong looks at this simulated body. It really feels like looking in the mirror.</p>

    <p>"Listen to Boss Luo. This body is made in equal proportions based on the body of Sun Rong. All the details are restored one to one. It is no different from the real body. Including the hair on all parts of the body, etc."</p>

    <p>"... hair all over your body?" Sun Rong got goosebumps when he heard this.</p>

    <p>"Sun Rong Schoolgirl, don't get me wrong. Boss Luo's simulated body production technology can already achieve AI intelligent production. There is no manual step in the whole process. It fully protects the customer's safety."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi said: "Of course. If it were placed 2 months ago, it would not necessarily be true... I remember 2 months ago. If we want to restore the hair details, the hair on the simulated body is all boss Luo. It's inserted root by root."</p>

    <p>"So... so perverted..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, the corners of the Sun family's mouths couldn't help but twitch.</p>

    <p>"But there is one thing to say. This method is indeed very high. It is almost as fake as real." At this time, Death Heavenly Dao also said.</p>

    <p>It is not easy to get praise from Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>Although Luo Pangzi's simulated body production technology has grown up under the accumulation of countless "abnormal behaviors", because the production level is unparalleled in the world, it has still been recognized by most people in the field.</p>

    <p>Even Death Heavenly Dao praised it. It can be imagined how excellent this fake body is.</p>

    <p>Swap the fake body wearing a hospital gown with the real body.</p>

    <p>The first thing is done.</p>

    <p>Death Tianda saw Zhuo Yi holding a remote control in his hand. He asked curiously: "What is this remote control?"</p>

    <p>"Don't all girls like to look beautiful? Boss Luo specially customized a few extra sets of clothes for Sun Rong's fake body."</p>

    <p>In addition to hospital gowns, Luo Pangzi designed a total of two other sets of clothes for cross-dressing.</p>

    <p>"Clothes? What kind of clothes?" Sun Rong also asked.</p>

    <p>"The blue and white striped hospital gown replicated on Sun Rong's fake body is made of a special material. In fact, it can be quickly reorganized according to needs. You can easily complete the transformation by pressing the remote control."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi said with a smile: "But this design knowledge was given to me by Boss Luo. In fact, it is of no use at all."</p>

    <p>"Can you see what kind of clothes they are?"Sun Rong was very curious.</p>

    <p>"Of course. It's just that Sun Rong, the school girl, really wants to watch it..." Zhuo Yi asked.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong suddenly had a bad feeling.</p>

    <p>"Clothes that you don't know how to design are very revealing..."</p>

    <p>"Not really. There is one set that is exposed. There is also one set that is not exposed. Which set does Sun Rong want to see?"</p>

    <p>"Then... it's better not to be exposed..."</p>

    <p>In front of so many people. Sun Rong is a little embarrassed.</p>

    <p>"Are you sure?" Zhuo Yi asked with a smile.</p>

    <p>"Yes... sure..."</p>

    <p>"Okay." Zhuo Yi nodded.</p>

    <p>The more "revealing" clothing is clothing Number 2. Luo Pangzi's design is a swimsuit.</p>

    <p>As for the "non-revealing" ones, it's clothes Number 3.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi quickly switch to clothes Number 3!</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>Along with the colorful glazed light emerging from the girl's body, the hospital gown began to change rapidly...</p>

    <p>After seeing clothes Number 3.</p>

    <p>The girl's face turned red and her ears were burned.</p>

    <p>She understands everything!</p>

    <p>But why...</p>

    <p>Clothes Number 3 is a wedding dress!!!</p>

    <p>She felt like she was being tricked by Zhuo Yi!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Office of Strategic Deception. In the True Venerated Immortal Hall. Zhenyuan immortal, Crispy Noodles Dao Lord is waiting here to welcome Sun Rong's true body.</p>

    <p>While waiting, the two had a brief conversation.</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect that the ancient Golden Men would be so rampant." said the immortal man from Zhenyuan.</p>

    <p>"It's just a grasshopper after autumn. It won't last long." Crispy Noodles Dao Lord laughed.</p>

    <p>"But I'm still a little confused." Zhenyuan Immortal said puzzledly: "Since these ancient Golden Men need to use the power of the Son of the Void to completely break through the seal of the Unspeakable Land, then why do they only focus on Miss Sun? I Remember. There should be two Sons of the Void."</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Lord held his chin up. He thought carefully and said: "Sun RongThe girl already has the breath of the void. It is the same as those void spirits. The ancient Golden Men are relatively easy to distinguish. But the second son of the void .Although Little Master Ling already has a lock range, it is still well hidden."</p>

    <p>"Is it hidden on purpose?"</p>

    <p>"I think it was intentional. There may be an ulterior conspiracy behind it."</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Lord said: "But I think I will have the answer soon. The three people from God's Domain have already gone to capture people."</p>
