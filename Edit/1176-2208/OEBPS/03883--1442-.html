  <h1>Chapter 1442 Join forces with Jiang Yingying</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Under normal circumstances. Boss Sun's reasoning result + reverse inference = correct answer.</p>

    <p>So after hearing Sun Yiyuan's king-like analysis, Jiang Xiaoche immediately knew the whole story.</p>

    <p>The eldest lady definitely took the initiative to make an appointment for this matter. And the location was probably also chosen by the eldest lady.</p>

    <p>Damn it...</p>

    <p>This Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche gritted his teeth.</p>

    <p>Mainly out of jealousy for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He has never seen Sun Rong care so much about someone. Even the places he went out to play were all for the sake of the other person.</p>

    <p>"Sir, what about the protection work on the ancient street this time..." Suppressing his jealousy, Jiang Xiaoche said to Boss Sun on the other side of the phone in as calm a voice as possible.</p>

    <p>"The protection must continue. But don't make such a big show of it." Mr. Boss Sun said: "Arrange some people. Put on the clothes of the ancient street staff. Disguise as the staff over there and carry out normal activities. Just protect it secretly."</p>

    <p>Xiu Zhen Cultivation Street. Mr. Boss Sun has also been there. He knows the situation there relatively well.</p>

    <p>All the staff inside are wearing Hanfu. They imitate the dress of cultivators in the old days when they go out. The Hanfu experience is also a famous activity on the ancient street.</p>

    <p>All tourists who come to the ancient street can rent Hanfu that suits them on site. They can walk on the ancient street in ancient costume and appreciate the folk customs of the cultivation culture of the old era.</p>

    <p>There. It's really a very romantic place.</p>

    <p>"Find some security personnel to pretend to be staff, right? But what should we do with the original staff..."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry about that. The owner of the street is an old friend of mine. I'll call him later. I'll give him a call. Give the staff a break for two days. Of course. We'll pay the wages for those two days. We'll pay them all. At three times the rate. I don't think they'll refuse." Boss Sun said.</p>

    <p>"Understood. Master, please go to bed early." Jiang Xiaoche nodded.</p>

    <p>Then hung up the phone.</p>

    <p>Dating on the ancient street...</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche curled his lips.</p>

    <p>Suddenly he had a new plan in mind.</p>

    <p>A plan that allows Wang Ling to reveal its true nature on the ancient streets...</p>

    <p>After the last incident where Lao Hui and his team from the "Loyalty Group" were invited to take action failed.</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche made a new summary based on the last failure experience.</p>

    <p>If he wants to realize his plan, it is not enough to rely on his own efforts. At this time, he must have teammates. He should cooperate inside and outside.</p>

    <p>The first suitable person that Jiang Xiaoche thought of was Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>Since Jiang Yingying transferred to another school because of Wang Ling, Jiang Xiaoche guessed that this little girl would not want Wang Ling and Sun Rong to be together.</p>

    <p>So, with the same goal in mind, Jiang Xiaoche felt that this was a good opportunity to cooperate with Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>Previously, he could not find a suitable reason to add Jiang Yingying's WeChat account, which resulted in him scrapping hundreds of WeChat accounts.</p>

    <p>But now. Everything is different.</p>

    <p>"I have a piece of information about Wang Ling. Do you want to know?" Jiang Xiaoche once again sent a friend request to Jiang Yingying through a new account.</p>

    <p>This time.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying approved his request almost immediately.</p>

    <p>Although he finally successfully added WeChat friends, Jiang Xiaoche still felt something was wrong.</p>

    <p>He tried so many times but failed. But he passed as soon as he mentioned Wang Ling... ugh. It was too difficult for him!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying was actually in a very depressed mood. The fact that Sun Rong became the leader of Gray Cult made her feel stuck in her throat. She felt at a loss.</p>

    <p>She is not the eldest daughter of a wealthy family. Especially she is the granddaughter of Marshal Jiang. She must pay attention to her words, deeds, and daily expenses.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, it is very likely to cause trouble to grandpa.</p>

    <p>As for emotional matters, Jiang Yingying has always been accustomed to handling them by herself.</p>

    <p>Although before she transferred to Number 60 High School, she had predicted that perhaps Sun Rong was her biggest opponent.</p>

    <p>But now Jiang Yingying discovered a problem.</p>

    <p>That is, compared to this eldest lady, her rank is still not high enough.</p>

    <p>Without the help of others, it will be difficult to start the next battle with Sun Rong...</p>

    <p>Originally, Jiang Yingying planned to become the leader of Gray Cult. Through the power of the leader of Gray Cult, he learned the information about Sun Rong from all aspects. Finally, he took action to deal with it.</p>

    <p>It's a pity. Sun Rong seems to have predicted her prediction. She used money to secure the position of the leader of Gray Cult in advance.</p>

    <p>Let her be defeated in the first round of confrontation.</p>

    <p>So now Jiang Yingying is in trouble.</p>

    <p>Now, I am new to Number 60 High School. It is really difficult to start the next plan when I am not familiar with the place.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying originally planned to let Yi Zhiyang accompany him to Number 60 High School after Yi Zhiyang recovered.</p>

    <p>However, Yi Zhiyang is still in a semi-autistic state...</p>

    <p>Although the situation is slightly better than before, it is still not completely back to normal.</p>

    <p>So in the end, Jiang Yingying found that he was too anxious.</p>

    <p>"It might be a lot better if Brother Yi is here." Jiang Yingying was lying on the bed, with his two slender legs slapping up and down.</p>

    <p>She was scratching her hair in confusion. At this moment, her phone vibrated.</p>

    <p>The ID shows that a man named "Ah Che" is trying to add him as a friend.</p>

    <p>In fact, Jiang Yingying has recently found that she seems to be being harassed all the time. Almost every day, a large number of strange men try to join her.</p>

    <p>Almost out of habit. Jiang Yingying was preparing to reject the application and be blacklisted.</p>

    <p>However, at this moment, a message about "Wang Ling" caught her attention.</p>

    <p>"Who are you?" He asked with a curious attitude. Jiang Yingying thought about it for a moment, but agreed to the other party's request.</p>

    <p>"Actually, I am a suitor of Miss... Sun Rong." Jiang Xiaoche mysteriously sent a message: "I know. My classmate Jiang has a crush on that classmate Wang Ling." ?"</p>

    <p>"I just appreciate his literary talent. Don't talk nonsense..." The moment Jiang Yingying saw the message, his cheeks turned red almost immediately.</p>

    <p>"In that case, we can cooperate because the goals are the same." Jiang Xiaoche typed straight to the point: "That's it. I received a piece of information here. This weekend. Wang Ling, Sun Rong and three light bulbs. We will go to Xiu Zhen Cultivation Street."</p>

    <p>"I know that place!" Jiang Yingying quickly replied.</p>

    <p>As a literary girl, Jiang Yingying always gets a different experience every time she goes to that ancient street.</p>

    <p>At the same time, she is also very familiar with the topography of that ancient street because she has been there more than once. The food circles on the ancient street also have hospitality coupons. She also saved a lot.</p>

    <p>"Are you sure the news is reliable?" However, out of caution, Jiang Yingying asked dubiously.</p>

    <p>"100% reliable. If you don't believe it, you can go to school tomorrow and ask one of the two light bulbs, Guo Hao and Chen Chao, to verify the authenticity. They are the best buddies of Wang Ling." Jiang Xiaoche said.</p>

    <p>"Okay. If it is true, I will agree to cooperate." Jiang Yingying nodded.</p>

    <p>In fact, the conversation ends here. Jiang Yingying already knows that this matter is almost true.</p>

    <p>My impression of Chen Chao and Guo Hao. Jiang Yingying is quite deep.</p>

    <p>I still remember when we were in the cafeteria before. The man named Chen Chao directly claimed that he was Wang Ling's best buddy.</p>

    <p>If this person named "Ah Che" is just a boring liar, there is no way he would know so much.</p>

    <p>"So, what do you want me to do?" At this time, Jiang Yingying asked.</p>

    <p>"The first step. We need to disguise our identities and then enter the ancient street together." Jiang Xiaoche said.</p>

    <p>"How to disguise?"</p>

    <p>"Of course I'm pretending to be boyfriend and girlfriend."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
