  <h1>Chapter 1586 The child is hungry</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Although the Ultimate Hunter does look similar to an octopus from a distance...</p>

    <p>But when it comes to appetite. Wang Ling will not have it. No matter how hungry he is, he will not have such thoughts.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Nuan obviously didn't think so. Wang Ling looked at the hungry child beside him, with inexplicably complicated emotions in his heart.</p>

    <p>Speaking of which, Ah Nuan girl has not even had a sip of hot milk since she was born, so she has been in a hurry to fight Fenmu Shen, who calls himself the "Overlord of the Universe."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that his girl is really having a hard time.</p>

    <p>Since I'm hungry...</p>

    <p>Then just eat it.</p>

    <p>But does the "Final Hunter" that looks like an octopus really taste good?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling always has doubts about this.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>There are more and more Endgame Hunters taking advantage of the Nameless Mist ahead. The number is no less than tens of thousands.</p>

    <p>They were shrouded in a layer of faint black light. The evil compound eyes were covered with red bloodshot eyes. They were filled with huge eyeballs like millstones.</p>

    <p>In addition, there are some other ancient creatures that are constantly being used from the cracked earth.</p>

    <p>Earth-boring Demonic Insects, Giant Devouring Worms, Mu Ancient Mysterious Insects... these existences only appeared among the gods of the ancient universe. Now they have all appeared. Densely packed worms are springing up from the earth like bamboo shoots after a rain.</p>

    <p>At first, there were only a few sporadic ones. Then it suddenly showed a blowout-like explosion.</p>

    <p>It was just to protect the evolving Fenmu Shen. It actually triggered rounds after rounds of gods that could only appear in the ancient universe.</p>

    <p>Seeing this scene in the distance, everyone in the King's Eyes vision sharing state was frightened.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong covered his slightly open mouth with his hands to hide his shock.</p>

    <p>The scene in front of me is definitely a nightmare for trypophobia...</p>

    <p>She had never seen or heard of these terrifying ancient creatures. Just looking at them gave her a sickening feeling that made her hair stand on end.</p>

    <p>Especially when the tens of millions of demonic insects, worms, and mysterious insects on the ground arch their bodies and accelerate forward.</p>

    <p>Sun RongYou can clearly see the thick purple-green mucus on the abdomens of these insects.</p>

    <p>When the bugs are close together, the stomach-turning slime tangles together. It separates with a hideous thread-drawing effect.</p>

    <p>And this scene also made Wang Ming's scalp numb.</p>

    <p>These Old Dominators from the ancient universe were beyond his knowledge. As the most powerful brain on earth, Wang Ming was also trying to understand what was happening in front of him.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Monk Jin Deng, who was recovering from his injuries, also stood up. He saw the scene happening in the highest world through the "Swastika."</p>

    <p>"Look at your expression now, monk. It seems that what is happening now is a bit beyond your expectation." Crispy Noodles Dao Lord sees it clearly. As a "real clone", although he is an independent individual, as long as Wang Ling agreed to his application to access King's Eyes, vision sharing can also be achieved.</p>

    <p>There are actually some differences between Crispy Noodles Dao Lord and Wang Ling. But when the two faced this doomsday-like scene, they showed my calmness but they were surprisingly consistent.</p>

    <p>The monk frowned: "The poor monk probably thought that he had obtained the power of some mysterious objects and might not die so easily. But he really didn't expect that this person actually has the blood of the gods of the ancient universe..."</p>

    <p>Civilization in the Old Dominator era. The monk had a partial understanding of it in Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>That era happened a long time ago, far beyond the civilization of human cultivators. But later, for some reasons, that profound ancient civilization was completely annihilated.</p>

    <p>No one knows what exactly caused a civilization that was so powerful in ancient times to be destroyed in an instant.</p>

    <p>As a symbol of the existence of ancient cosmic civilization, the "mysterious object" discovered by Dao Ancestor Wang is one of them.</p>

    <p>"At that time, Master Dao Ancestor knew the danger of the mysterious object, so he tried every means to seal it." The monk said, "It is said that when it was discovered, it was just an ordinary stone. Master Dao Ancestor kept the stone with him. After a while, Then he heard the heartbeat coming from inside the stone."</p>

    <p>"Heartbeat?" Crispy Noodles Dao Lord touched his chin. He felt that he heard something very interesting: "So this mysterious thing called destiny. It is actually a heart fossil left by a certain alien god in the ancient universe?"</p>

    <p>"This... the poor monk doesn't know..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, in the supreme world shrouded in chaos, the battle continues.</p>

    <p>Seeing the dense insects on the ground, Wang Ling felt a little uncomfortable. He took a deep breath. The Niwan Palace in his mind was shaking!</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>An invisible loud noise spread with Wang Ling as the center. It spread to the minds of every living creature in the supreme world.</p>

    <p>For a moment, the space froze. Even time seemed to have stood still.</p>

    <p>Everything in front of me paused. The final hunters with their claws and fangs in the air, including the worms that were constantly scurrying on the ground, seemed to be petrified at this moment. They were motionless.</p>

    <p>This is only 5% of the mental pressure of Wang Ling. When released, it is enough to intimidate the entire audience!</p>

    <p>These pressures are all caused by Wang Ling's daily work on function bodies. As well as the pressures in life that he is afraid of destroying the world by using too much force and worrying about it all day long.</p>

    <p>It may not seem like too much pressure, but over time it can reach a very scary level.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling didn't expect that he only released 5%.</p>

    <p>The creatures from the ancient universe in front of him were all shocked by him.</p>

    <p>After about a few seconds of silence, the bugs that emerged from the earth retreated away under the tremendous pressure. They burrowed back into the earth again. They walked in unison. Incomparably sincere...</p>

    <p>And these Old Dominators flying in the sky, named "Final Hunters", crashed from the void and fell to the ground.</p>

    <p>Then. Wang Ling jumped down from the ancient mountain and began to examine these "Final Hunters" who had fainted under the tremendous mental pressure.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling squatted down. He stretched out a finger and poked the body of one of the final hunters.</p>

    <p>Whether it's the touch or the fishy smell that's very similar to seafood on the surface.</p>

    <p>All this seems to be no different from grilled squid in a barbecue restaurant...</p>

    <p>The main reason why he used the method of releasing mental pressure to shock the audience was to ensure the flesh quality of these ancient cosmic creatures.</p>

    <p>After all, if you directly use the ability of King's Eyes to release rays, these guys will die and turn into fly ash on the spot. And my girl may not even be able to eat a piece of meat.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling sighed deeply in his heart. He was not polite and directly pulled out one of the tentacles of the final hunter. Then he used the most basic "Palm Flame Technique" to burn the tentacles. bake.</p>

    <p>Not long after, a fragrance spread.</p>

    <p>There was no seasoning. Ah Nuan girl took a bite and bit directly on the tentacle.</p>

    <p>But after just chewing for a while, Wang Nuan spit out the meat in his mouth.</p>

    <p>Because the hunter's meat is not delicious.</p>

    <p>And at this time.</p>

    <p>She turned her attention to the evolving tomb...</p>

    <p>At this moment, Fenmu Shen's resurrection ceremony has entered the final stage. The huge piece of flesh floating in the air exudes a dark yellow luster.</p>

    <p>From a distance, it looks like a salted duck egg yolk leaking oil...</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan swallowed hard. Suddenly it felt like Fenmu Shen. Even more delicious.</p>
