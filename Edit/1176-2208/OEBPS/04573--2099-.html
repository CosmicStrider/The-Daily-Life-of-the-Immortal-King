  <h1>Chapter 2099 Big Pie Tactics</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: Against Yi Jianchuan, against Yue Lingwei, against Zhang Zhui. The immortal fleet arranged by Mi Xiu Yuan Zun surrounded them from all directions. If this matter is not handled carefully, it will easily lead to a war between the two countries.</p>

    <p>Even though Sage Immortal is in charge, the country is so vast that a fight is really going to happen. Yi Jianchuan is not sure that he can protect the safety of all the people. Peace is what everyone hopes for. No one wants to live in an era of war. Let alone People hope that there will really be a fight, because when the time comes, we will rise or fall. We will always be the citizens of the Xiuzhen Kingdom in suffering.</p>

    <p>The reason why the modern scientific cultivation world can move forward steadily is ultimately because of the existence of the rule of law, the existence of civilization, and the existence of checks and balances. It restrains the kind of unreasonable violence against others that relies only on strength under the cultivation system of the old era. The kind of monks who plunder and have no moral sense.</p>

    <p>Of course, there are many monks like this who have no sense of morality and rule of law in the modern world of cultivation. But they dare not, because they know that there are people above them who are stronger than them, because they are also afraid of social death. They are afraid that their crimes will be made public with the modern Internet. They are afraid that their ugly faces will be known to everyone.</p>

    <p>Therefore, in Yi Jianchuan's view, Misu, as a country that made its fortune in modern times by invading other cultivating countries, appears to be free, fair and preaches peace everywhere. In fact, it is still continuing its old hegemony.</p>

    <p>Just like at this moment, these ships were surrounded. It told him clearly that at this moment on the high seas, they were riding a sect's special train. They were not qualified to speak on an equal footing with a country's exclusive fleet.</p>

    <p>This is a trick used by Mi Xiu. It is also an act of hegemony. But Xiao Bailong has traveled so far. It was impossible for them to give in in the past. It is even more impossible to give in now!</p>

    <p>The restricted area of the sea is the high seas! It is a land without owners. Although the order of the international cultivation world must be observed, the monks of Michu cannot be allowed to show off their power here.</p>

    <p>When countless golden haloes bloomed like flowers in the void, the sea water in the entire sea restricted area surged again and became unstable.</p>

    <p>Mi XiuYuan Zun was in the giant white tower. He looked at the scene in front of him from a distance. He rubbed his eyes and couldn't believe what he saw. This was not a teleportation circle. It was someone who opened the teleportation channel!</p>

    <p>Space-based teleportation spells. True Immortal can do it. But the teleportation distance will not be too far. It is absolutely impossible to come directly across half the world. And in the process of traveling through space, a lot of spiritual power will be consumed.</p>

    <p>Venerated Immortal can communicate with the power of the universe and roam on foot in the universe. It is no problem to achieve long-distance crossing. As for the holy realm... as long as you understand the space spell, the distance of space transmission can be even further.</p>

    <p>However, all space spells currently known to modern human monks on earth have one thing in common. That is, only in places marked by one's own aura can one use space capabilities to achieve precise transmission. Otherwise, position deviation will easily occur.</p>

    <p>But in front of him, the teleportation channels opened in the void one by one made Mi XiuYuan Zun completely confused.</p>

    <p>Because he immediately judged that this was definitely not a space channel opened by magic. It was a transmission completed using modern technology! It was also combined with the most advanced satellite positioning to achieve such accuracy!</p>

    <p>When a large number of humanoid combat mechas with Huaxiu's mark poured out from the space passage and formed a neat square array in the void. The moon spirit was in danger, Zhang Zhui suddenly understood in his heart. This was Wang Ming's handiwork!</p>

    <p>Both of them were amazed at how terrifying this man was.</p>

    <p>With the body of an ordinary person, he can actually develop a precise space transmission device for ultra-long distances.</p>

    <p>It should be noted that from Huaxiu to this restricted sea area, it spans more than half of the earth!</p>

    <p>If we send out a fleet group, we won't be able to reach here at the first time.</p>

    <p>The same person who was shocked was Mi Xiu Yuan Zun. He was in the office of the giant white tower with a group of staff under him. Gu Cheng</p>

    <p>"Ultra-long distance precision space transmission device..."</p>

    <p>An old man in a suit and ties was greatly shocked. His back stood up. He felt that all the nerves in his body were tense instantly.</p>

    <p>As a country that has always been famous for its black technology of cultivation and sells offensive magic weapons to the world, Huaxiu suddenly developed an "ultra-long-distance precise space transmission device" at this time. It was undoubtedly a slap in the face for them.</p>

    <p>"Our Academy of Sciences has been developing this thing for a long time! Why did they come up with it first?" Mi XiuYuan Zun was puzzled, but he was greatly shocked.</p>

    <p>This advanced technology made him feel an almost disconnected feeling. At the same time, his face was covered with cold sweat. From Huaxiu to the coordinates of the sea restricted area, more than half of the world has been crossed.</p>

    <p>This means that the barriers arranged by the major cultivation countries at the national borders are no longer in effect for Huaxiu now... Their monks can concentrate their strength at any time. Through this method, they can be transmitted continuously like today!</p>

    <p>You don't even have to send out monks!</p>

    <p>Because the humanoid fighting machine in front of him has already explained that Huaxiu also controls the technology of the mechanical monk! This is a fighting robot made purely by using technological means and materials from the cultivation world!</p>

    <p>This is also a technology that Michu does not have now...</p>

    <p>At this moment, Mi XiuYuan Zun felt himself dizzy and felt like he was about to faint.</p>

    <p>He asked sternly: "Why! There are so many cutting-edge monks in our Academy of Cultivation and Magical Science. How come these two technologies have been overtaken? Isn't it possible that none of them can work! Wasn't this proposed decades ago..."</p>

    <p>"Why..."</p>

    <p>One person lamented: "Although this concept was proposed decades ago, and we also have mature theories, it is just a theory."</p>

    <p>"So I just want to ask why it hasn't been done! Is it so difficult to have a mechanized cultivation force. and an ultra-long-distance precise space transmission device?"</p>

    <p>"Lord Yuan Zun, calm down... This... we didn't expect this. We originally wanted to draw a pie. Because although this thing has theory, in fact, it is simply a fantasy in the eyes of our scientific researchers. It is completely impossible to achieve. So Huaxiu has invested in this area over the years. The possibility of getting nothing is very high."</p>

    <p>As the man spoke, he sighed: "But... who would have thought... they really did it."</p>

    <p>The tactic of trying to spread the pie and bring down the rest of the Xiu Zhen Kingdom was also Mi Xiu's usual tactic. But he didn't expect that it wouldn't work this time.</p>

    <p>At this time, over the sea restricted area, a large number of mechanical monks developed by Huaxiu were neatly arranged in a grid pattern. There were tens of thousands in number! It was a dark mass, like a sheet of dark clouds, giving people a strong sense of oppression.</p>

    <p>The sword master immediately pointed at the void and sneered: "Mixiu Yuan Zun, you have deceived Xiongxiu before. You have also deceived Xiongxiu. Today is different from the past. I wonder if you, Mixiu, have this ability now? You don't have this ability. You know." Now you are still trying to deceive me and Brother Huaxiu. You are really shameless!"</p>
