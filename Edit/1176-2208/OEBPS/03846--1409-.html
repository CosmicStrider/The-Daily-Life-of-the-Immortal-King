  <h1>Chapter 1409 The big crisis of Sun Rong!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Zhen looked like he was out of luck.</p>

    <p>But in fact, Wang Zhen decided to kneel down on the durian after careful consideration.</p>

    <p>Of course he knew that this "Heavenly Dao Durian" was extraordinary.</p>

    <p>That is an existence that has been enlightened by Wang Ling. It is impossible for it to be crushed by one's own knees like an ordinary durian.</p>

    <p>If I kneel down, I'm afraid my kneecaps will be shattered...</p>

    <p>Therefore, before Wang Zhen knelt down at Heavenly Dao durian, he had a very clear understanding of the situation.</p>

    <p>But in the end he chose to kneel down.</p>

    <p>Because Wang Zhen also knew it very well.</p>

    <p>As soon as his knee was broken, Wang Ling's anger disappeared.</p>

    <p>The matter of "offending Wang Ling" was far more terrifying than the matter of "breaking a knee", as Wang Zhen imagined.</p>

    <p>So, just kneel down...</p>

    <p>Anyway, cultivation medical technology is so advanced now. Even if it is broken, it can be repaired without leaving any sequelae.</p>

    <p>As long as Wang Ling can calm down. Everything will be worth it.</p>

    <p>And the facts proved that Wang Zhen's decision was completely correct.</p>

    <p>As for his knees being beaten by gangsters...</p>

    <p>This thing is completely false.</p>

    <p>He didn't know how it spread.</p>

    <p>Logically speaking, only Liu Qingyi knew the news about his injury.</p>

    <p>And Liu Qingyi actually kept this matter under wraps, so no outsiders would know about it.</p>

    <p>Unless he accidentally leaked the news...</p>

    <p>But even if it leaks out, it won't be so outrageous!</p>

    <p>This made Wang Zhen sigh with emotion.</p>

    <p>That's what the Internet is like now.</p>

    <p>The people who follow the trend and follow the trend often ignore the truth of the incident itself.</p>

    <p>Because what the melon-eaters really care about is not the truth, but what they believe is right.</p>

    <p>These days, I don't have the ability to think independently. It's really scary...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, in response to the vicious incident in front of the school gate where Wang Zhen was suspected of being attacked by a gangster, Sun Rong held a special student union meeting to discuss it.</p>

    <p>What happened to Wang Zhen. In fact, it was indeed Liu Qingyi and Sun Rong who accidentally let it slip during their conversation.</p>

    <p>Then Miss Sun acted as the driving force behind the scenes and made up this matter...</p>

    <p>She wants to organize a student union meeting. Looking for more information about Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>And since there is a meeting, there must be a reason.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen's incident is actually a suitable excuse to hold a meeting.</p>

    <p>Who makes Wang Zhen so naughty!</p>

    <p>But after all, this is also taking advantage of Wang Zhen.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong still prepared some supplements to send to the love hotel where Wang Zhen is currently staying.</p>

    <p>Treating bones, treating kidney deficiency, everything...</p>

    <p>At 12:30 noon, it was originally lunch break time for each class.</p>

    <p>At this point. Sun Rong has launched a student union meeting.</p>

    <p>The student union cannot sanction the so-called "gangsters."</p>

    <p>But as an organization that provides services to students, they can advocate to the school to strengthen security at the school gate during school hours.</p>

    <p>Before all participants start the meeting.</p>

    <p>Everyone thought this would be a serious and serious meeting.</p>

    <p>At the results meeting, when Sun Rong suddenly asked for a person's name, everyone was confused.</p>

    <p>"Do you know this girl Jiang Yingying?"Sun Rong was smiling and calm.</p>

    <p>Everyone was stunned.</p>

    <p>Wait a minute!</p>

    <p>Aren't we discussing today the issue of strengthening security at school gates after school?</p>

    <p>Why did the conversation suddenly turn to a girl?</p>

    <p>All the representatives from Number 60 High School's elite class present were stunned.</p>

    <p>"President, is this girl related to this incident?" someone asked.</p>

    <p>"No. Not sure yet."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong said: "I just heard some rumors. So I want to ask everyone if you know this girl. I can integrate the information to identify the authenticity."</p>

    <p>The girl's expression was serious and her words sounded as if they were true. All the simple students here believed her.</p>

    <p>"As expected of the president! As expected of my classmate Sun Rong. He is serious and rigorous in doing things!" Someone couldn't help but praise him on the spot.</p>

    <p>At the meeting site, many people were whispering and discussing.</p>

    <p>Basically, those who are willing to join the student union are social butterflies who are active in various campus circles. They have more or less connections in other schools.</p>

    <p>After Sun Rong asked this question, these people immediately took out their mobile phones and asked their familiar friends.</p>

    <p>Under such a huge crowd tactic, someone really asked about Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>"I asked!"</p>

    <p>A girl with short ear-length hair raised her hand: "Jiang Yingying. A girl from Jian Shen Academy! She also participated in the Jiulongshan National Physical Martial Arts Competition before. But she was kicked out very early!"</p>

    <p>"Jian Shen Academy?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong frowned slightly.</p>

    <p>Everyone knows that Jian Shen Academy is a school invested and built by the sword master General Yi, and his adopted son Yi Zhiyang studies there.</p>

    <p>Er Ha previously speculated that Jiang Yingying might be related to Martial Saint Marshal Jiang.</p>

    <p>So if Jiang Yingying also studies here...then this can almost be regarded as a real deal.</p>

    <p>Was he originally a student of Jian Shen College?</p>

    <p>This new discovery surprised Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>In this way, the event clues and character relationship clues are all connected...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong is almost certain. This is the Jiang Yingying you want to find.</p>

    <p>"Do you have any photos?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"Yes." The short-haired girl pulled out Jiang Yingying's photo. This was a set that someone had just sent to her.</p>

    <p>The person who sent her the information was a boy from Jian Shen College. And this boy was also from the student union.</p>

    <p>"This person looks a bit like you, the president!" The girl swiped her hand, and the photo on her phone was projected onto the screen into the void of the conference room.</p>

    <p>When everyone saw Jiang Yingying's appearance clearly, they couldn't help but hissed...</p>

    <p>"This..."</p>

    <p>"I can't say they are particularly similar. It just looks a bit similar at first glance."</p>

    <p>"That's awesome! I still think we will look good!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong stared at this face that looked very similar to his own. He was also thinking about countermeasures in his mind.</p>

    <p>Based on the information obtained so far, Jiang Yingying is generally close to her speculation.</p>

    <p>Basically, the fact that he can participate in the Jiulongshan National Physical Martial Arts Competition is enough to prove that Jiang Yingying's results in Jian Shen Academy are pretty good!</p>

    <p>It was just because I lacked some luck during the competition that I was eliminated very early. As a result, Sun Rong did not notice this person.</p>

    <p>"So. I fell in love with my classmate Wang Ling. Was it also during the Jiulongshan National Gymnastics Competition?" Sun Rong thought thoughtfully.</p>

    <p>After the student union, Sun Rong spent another afternoon thinking about how to approach Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>If you come to the door very suddenly, it will look very unnatural.</p>

    <p>However, what the girl never expected was that an emergency happened again just before school was over that day...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was called to the office by Principal Chen: "Classmate Sun Rong. You are the president of the student union. There will be a group of new transfer students in our school soon. I hope you will take the lead and integrate these students into our school as soon as possible. environment!"</p>

    <p>"Okay principal. I will try my best!" Sun Rong nodded.</p>

    <p>"Yes. Student Sun has excellent abilities. There will be no problem!" Principal Chen handed out a brochure with a smile: "Here is the list. Take a look."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong opens the booklet.</p>

    <p>The name of the first person on the roster immediately came into her sight.</p>

    <p>This person is no one else.</p>

    <p>It is Jiang Yingying from Jian Shen College...</p>

    <p>It only took a moment. A sense of crisis came to Sun Rong's heart.</p>
