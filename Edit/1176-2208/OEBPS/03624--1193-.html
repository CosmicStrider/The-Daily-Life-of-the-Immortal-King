  <h1>Chapter 1193 Composition "Substitute"</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After realizing that he was noticed by Sun Rong, Crispy Noodles quickly suppressed his smile. This was the first time he received a field mission order from Wang Ling. He felt that he was a little too complacent. He actually showed such a smile. Big flaw.</p>

    <p>The crispy noodles were very clear. The girl in front of him was the eldest lady of the Huaguo Shuilian Group. When she entered school, she was listed as one of the people on the "Beware of Strictly" list by Little Master Ling at the first sight. Now she was actually seeing such a person. A flaw was revealed in front of him. This made Crispy Noodles feel that he had made a huge mistake.</p>

    <p>What should I do? Should I knock her out... physically erase her memory?</p>

    <p>After thinking carefully, Crispy Noodles finally decided against it.</p>

    <p>She refuses verbally, but sometimes her body is very honest. Crispy noodles feel that although classmate Sun Rong has been included in the list of objects to be strictly wary of, it does not necessarily mean that Little Master Ling actually hates her. Since Under the premise of not being sure whether it is really annoying or not, for the sake of caution. Crispy noodles did not take a rough approach to Sun Rong in the end.</p>

    <p>Instead, he used the branch ability of the {Great Memory Technique} in Three Thousand Heavenly Dao to erase the image of him accidentally smiling from the girl's mind.</p>

    <p>This incident actually served as a wake-up call for Crispy Noodles. He had been too complacent just now. He temporarily forgot that his mission was to change his identity. He should maintain the character of Little Master Ling as much as possible.</p>

    <p>As a real avatar with intelligence. Although Crispy Noodles looks exactly like Wang Ling, there is actually a certain degree of difference in personality from the original body.</p>

    <p>He must pay more attention to this.</p>

    <p>Facts have proved that although the matter of being a stand-in seems simple, it is also very demanding on acting skills.</p>

    <p>It's not easy for Crispy Noodles to blend into the team. The differences in souls between people are often reflected at this time. He is the true clone of Wang Ling. However, there are still differences.</p>

    <p>In the early morning, everyone in the Fire Peak Number 60 High School camp is taking time to complete the entry diary for this Taishu Exchange Conference.</p>

    <p>This is an additional component in this Taishu Exchange Conference. The requirement is very simple. It is to complete an experience essay during the competition. It is required to express the true feelings of the competition from the perspective of a contestant.</p>

    <p>You can choose your own topic, and the subject matter can be triggered by research on physical martial arts duels from each school, friendship, team chemistry, and tactical analysis and discussion...</p>

    <p>If you can complete this essay during the survival competition, the participating team you represent will get extra points. Then, it will be judged by professional Chinese teachers based on the content of the essay. The ten essays with the best content will be selected to get extra points.</p>

    <p>It's okay if you don't write it. No points will be deducted. But since it is an option for extra points, schools that can afford it still decide to participate.</p>

    <p>For example, the Number 60 High School camp can safely complete this extra-point essay.</p>

    <p>Ever since the news broke that four high schools, led by Fu Mo Number 1 High School, were taken over by Number 60 High School, no one in the Number 60 High School camp dared to offend them.</p>

    <p>The early morning period is when the mind is most alert. It is perfect for literary creation.</p>

    <p>In the process of Wang Ling going to save the world. The task of this essay naturally fell on Crispy Noodles.</p>

    <p>The main reason is that Crispy Noodles saw everyone writing about it. If he didn't go, I'm afraid he would be a bit unsociable.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling is also here to write a composition. Make room quickly!" Everyone formed a circle. When they saw Crispy Noodles coming, they all moved their buttocks to make way for a seat that was just big enough for one person.</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles wanted to say thank you. However, considering that this did not seem to fit Little Master Ling's character, he forced himself to smash the thank you and swallowed it in his stomach. Then he held his knees and merged into everyone's creations obediently. middle.</p>

    <p>Many people are thinking about choosing topics for compositions. In the past, the habit of Wang Ling was to observe everyone's topic choices and then classify them. Then choose the one with the most topics to create based on the same topic.</p>

    <p>For example, five people wrote essays on the theme of "Friendship." Three people wrote essays on the theme of "Tactical Layout." Then Wang Ling will definitely write an essay on "Friendship" based on the side with more people. "of.</p>

    <p>In this way, he can ensure that his composition will not be too eye-catching.</p>

    <p>When a composition teacher reads too many essays on the same topic, unless you write something unique, your score will not be too high.</p>

    <p>And what Wang Ling wants is this effect.</p>

    <p>But Crispy Noodles didn't actually know Wang Ling's habits. He saw that everyone had already started writing, so he immediately formulated his own topic.</p>

    <p>The title of his composition is "Substitute."</p>

    <p>Many people noticed the essay title of Wang Ling and expressed curiosity.</p>

    <p>"Substitute? Classmate Wang Ling is this expressing some kind of metaphor?" Some people were puzzled.</p>

    <p>"Guaiguai. Wang Ling has actually already drafted the title of the essay. In the past, he always wrote it slowly and last." Chen Chao also expressed surprise. He felt that this was a bit unlike Wang Ling's. Style. I always have the illusion that Wang Ling is not being manipulated.</p>

    <p>"Are you a substitute? This essay title is interesting." As a representative of the ideological and political class, Guo Hao felt that he had something to say. It was a short essay in the ordinary introduction to cultivation thought class. Many times, some historical events cannot be explained clearly. This kind of passage is needed. Only when metaphors are expressed in words can teachers favor them.</p>

    <p>So for the title "Stand-in", Guo Hao had his own interpretation almost instantly: "I know! What classmate Wang Ling wants to express is the theme. In fact, it is friendship! The friendship of each of us is inseparable. Substitute! A true friend should be like a substitute. He can help in time in times of difficulty! To help friends bear the pain together! Share the hardships together! And this is the legendary [Stand-in Messenger] general friendship..."</p>

    <p>So is this what Wang Ling wanted to express?</p>

    <p>Everyone nodded when they heard this.</p>

    <p>They felt that Guo Hao's point of view sounded quite reasonable at first glance. In fact, even Crispy Noodles himself did not expect that there was such a level of sophistication in it... He just made up a random topic.</p>

    <p>Of course, the most egregious thing is more than that.</p>

    <p>Just when Crispy Noodles decided to write an article, the other side was actually setting up a "betting game"... but this bet was made with himself as the starting point.</p>

    <p>The two people taking the lead are Guo Hao and Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>"Come on, come on. The deal is gone! No one can go back on it!" Chen Chao shouted from the front. As he said that, he put all the Talisman in his hand on the word "big."</p>

    <p>"What kind of bet is this? How to play?"</p>

    <p>"Below 20 is small. Above 21 is large!"</p>

    <p>"???" Some people still don't quite understand what this means.</p>

    <p>"To put it bluntly, I'm just betting on how many ellipses there will be in classmate Wang Ling's composition this time!"</p>
