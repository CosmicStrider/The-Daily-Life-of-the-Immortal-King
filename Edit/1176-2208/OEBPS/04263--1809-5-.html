  <h1>Chapter 1809 Unimagined Road 5</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Everything is within the layout of Wang Ling. Levis, who has assumed the identity of the Arch Pope, is no different from the obvious wolf effect in Werewolf. Maiko Assi and Pei Luoqi clearly know that the Arch Pope is dead. The person in front of them must be a false pope.</p>

    <p>They will only secretly plot to identify the true identity of the Arch Pope.</p>

    <p>It's a pity that with the current methods on earth, there is no way to see through the disguise under Wang Nuan's "Shadow Film Assimilation Technique." Now Levi's shadow has been surrounded by the shadow of the Arch Pope, and he has obtained all the memories of the Arch Pope. And he himself has become the Arch Pope himself.</p>

    <p>The blood, fingerprints, and DNA data will all become a perfect match for the Arch Pope. No mistakes can be found at all.</p>

    <p>"Do you know what to do now?" Wang Ying looked at Levi's and asked.</p>

    <p>This kind of disguise was beyond Levi's imagination. Looking at this completely changed body covered by the "Shadow Film Assimilation Technique", and the memories flooding into his mind.</p>

    <p>Levi's face showed a kind of shock at first. Then all the emotions turned into a kind of ecstasy and anger.</p>

    <p>He inherited the will of the Arch Pope. He also got all the original thoughts and ideas of the Arch Pope. Not only did he know that the church planned to attack the Huaguo Shuilian Group and the Office of Strategic Deception, but he also knew more clearly about the Arch Pope. The pope's attitude toward himself.</p>

    <p>Now Levi knows everything.</p>

    <p>I learned that the church had indeed planned to abandon him from the beginning.</p>

    <p>And. Because of Lawen's lobbying, she changed her initial strategy towards him.</p>

    <p>To the church, he is now just a useless chess piece. And he is also a chess piece that knows too many things. After being used up, he must be destroyed once and for all.</p>

    <p>According to the original plan of the church, after Lawen completely took over the Chilan Society, they planned to take advantage of his slackness and then get rid of him together.</p>

    <p>"That woman...it turns out that she knew from the beginning that the Arch Pope was still going to kill me. Fortunately, she could still talk about sincere cooperation..." Levis smiled bitterly. There was a disgusting feeling of being deeply deceived. It made him feel sick. I was overwhelmed and retched at one point.</p>

    <p>He thought that his relationship with the church was unbreakable. But he never expected that the white warriors that Lawen had formed privately over the years would form an unimaginable bond with the church.</p>

    <p>It was this bond and deeper cooperation that prompted the church to completely abandon him.</p>

    <p>At one time, Levis was completely kept in the dark. It could be said that he had no idea about this matter. But now that he has become the Arch Pope, all the fog in front of him suddenly became brighter and clearer.</p>

    <p>He began to hate the church. He hated the Arch Pope, Lawen, Maiko Assi, and the Heavenly Dao who only knew how to make peace with the mud...</p>

    <p>Of course! What made him feel even more disgusting was the Tengu who was hiding behind the scenes and was always plotting various conspiracies.</p>

    <p>Even the Arch Pope is one of the top members of the Tengu...the infiltration of this organization and the impact it will bring in the future are inestimable.</p>

    <p>At this time, Levis looked at Wang Ying. Although he still couldn't see Wang Ying's face clearly, he also knew that the senior from the Office of Strategic Deception in front of him was the last straw he could hold tightly: "Senior, don't worry. I will fully cooperate with you in the next actions. I will play the role of the Arch Pope and infiltrate the Tengu at the same time..."</p>

    <p>"Very good." Wang Ying nodded.</p>

    <p>Levis is still a smart person, which makes him very satisfied. Youdao means knowing people, knowing faces, but not knowing hearts. This shadow film assimilation technique allowed Levis to completely understand what role the church played. It completely cut off Levis. The last vestige of trust in the church.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ying threw a mobile phone to Levi's. The mobile phone had a Gray Cult exclusive app downloaded. And it was a magical app. It would only be displayed when it passed Levi's hand.</p>

    <p>If an outsider picks up Levi's phone or checks the contents of the phone, the app will hide it by itself and delete all the messages in it.</p>

    <p>Information cultivation magic. It is also one of the hot topics this year.</p>

    <p>With the development process of the modernization of cultivation, the development of information-based cultivation techniques will also become a key part in the future.</p>

    <p>"I understand, senior."</p>

    <p>Levis took the phone and nodded.</p>

    <p>"In addition, you are now given a new ability." Wang Ying said: "In order to ensure the smooth development of this intelligence mission, now you only need to come into contact with other people's shadows. You can pre-read the other person's thoughts."</p>

    <p>"Contact Shadow?"</p>

    <p>"For example, during the conversation, find the light and angle. Let your shadow touch the shadow of the person you want to test. You will know that you can know most of the information in his mind."</p>

    <p>"How can it be like this..." Levis was completely shocked.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, on the other side, everyone at Number 60 High School is still understanding the rules of this variety show challenge. Variety shows are inherently about fun and pranks. Normally, they don't really do anything to the contestants. It's even more impossible. To the point of death.</p>

    <p>But after listening to the rules of Sun Rong, everyone at Number 60 High School suddenly had a bad feeling.</p>

    <p>For example, in the first round of escape, six people were locked in two groups in different rooms. The remaining Wang Muyu will also be locked in another independent space in the central area, waiting for rescue.</p>

    <p>According to the rules. The team that breaks free from the shackles first and finds three different keys corresponding to the three rooms. The team that rescues the "children" in the central area wins...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling understands the truth. But he doesn't know why the more this thing sounds, the more it sounds like a modified version of {{Saw}}...</p>

    <p>Is it true to lock people up and escape?</p>

    <p>Do I need to saw off my arms or legs or something like that?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thinks this is a bit too exaggerated.</p>

    <p>But in the current situation. They have to participate in the variety show challenge. How to conduct the next grouping is a problem.</p>

    <p>"This way, Guo Fen and I will be together, Fang Xing and Li Youyue will be together, and Lingzi will be together with Boss Sun Rong." At this time, Chen Chao suggested.</p>

    <p>In his opinion, this was a flawless grouping plan. The original purpose of their coming to Glio City was to assist.</p>

    <p>So the initial mission has not been forgotten.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong did not expect Chen Chao to be so awesome. He was immediately moved to tears.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao gave Sun Rong a thumbs up in return. Then he patted his chest. This meant to tell Sun Rong that he has never forgotten his original intention...</p>

    <p>Simple body language. Wang Ling can see it all. And he also knows exactly what it means...</p>

    <p>However, such a grouping is still somewhat unstable for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>After all, this is it.</p>

    <p>It's like putting the most powerful people into one group.</p>

    <p>He and Sun Rong are both very strong.</p>

    <p>Li Youyue has Fang Xing taking care of her. Naturally, there is no need to worry about escaping.</p>

    <p>Only Chen Chao and Guo Hao.</p>

    <p>One has a bright mouth, and the other has a lot of uncles... Who knows what could happen if these two come together?</p>
