  <h1>Chapter 2139 Director's Responsibilities</h1>

  <div>

    <p>As a director, how to direct an excellent work. Its creativity and content screenwriting often depend on the minimum limit of the work. The actors' interpretation and interpretation of the script directly determine the upper limit of the work.</p>

    <p>As an inexperienced and ordinary high school student, Director Wang is not a directing major after all. He doesn't understand directors, and he doesn't know how to choose actors.</p>

    <p>Even the script was arranged based on what was available after careful calculation.</p>

    <p>As for the future results of the final interpretation, Wang Ling only has a rough outline in his mind. To put it simply, he is quite confident.</p>

    <p>Because although he doesn't know much about it, he still understands a little bit about everything.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, it is.</p>

    <p>He knows Bai Zhe too well...</p>

    <p>As a strange being who has been wiped out several times by himself, but has not been completely wiped out. He has survived with a trace of his remaining thoughts.</p>

    <p>To put it mildly, Wang Ling felt a bit of resilience from Bai Zhe.</p>

    <p>As long as this guy's logical thinking is normal and he doesn't think about doing evil everywhere, he may be a rare "talent" in the history of human monks.</p>

    <p>Now, they have gone from openly competing with each other in the beginning to a situation where they are wrestling with each other behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>Although Qiao Yanyuan is very strong, he is at best just a pawn under the alliance of Bai Zhe and Fenmu Shen.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling himself is not afraid. It is good that Bai Zhe has many strange and capable people in his hands. But Wang Ling also has good talents in his hands.</p>

    <p>And a large part of them were secretly supported by Wang Ling himself after falling in love with them.</p>

    <p>On a larger scale, for example, Qin Zhong, Xiang Yi, Li Xian, Zhang Zhui... these are strangers from the outside world and people from all ages.</p>

    <p>Speaking more closely, there are also Zhuo Yi, Lord Diulei, Immortal Toya, Cailian Zhenren, and Lord Diulei who were good friends who I met on the Internet. Now all of them have become core members of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>If we were closer, there would be Fang Xing, Chen Chao, Guo Hao and his classmates.</p>

    <p>Although Chen Chao and Guo Hao are at a low level, their talents are actually quite good. Now, under his script, he has personally customized mentors on the road to cultivation. It is really time for the battle of destiny. Wang Ling feels Both of them might be able to play their respective roles.</p>

    <p>And now, in the world of the Itinerant Immortal magic ring, Wang Ling has set its sights on Sun Rong again.</p>

    <p>To be honest, Sun Rong was actually cultivated intentionally by Wang Ling. However, there is a feeling mixed in there that Wang Ling has not quite understood yet.</p>

    <p>At first Wang Ling was just regarded as an unavoidable fate.</p>

    <p>Later, after the Yin-Yang Death Tribulation happened, Wang Ling gradually accepted the reality... and acquiesced that Sun Rong could know his true strength...</p>

    <p>The comfort that Wang Ling gives to myself now is that the reason for everything is "repaying kindness."</p>

    <p>After all, Sun Rong and Mr. Boss Sun are very good to him. At least they are not ambiguous about the crispy noodles. It can be said that they fully satisfy his fantasies about all the ways to eat crispy noodles.</p>

    <p>As for the Huaguo Shuilian Group, in fact, in the eyes of Wang Ling, it is not a pill group.</p>

    <p>Speaking of which, it's more like a stable source of dry noodles.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After some operations by Wang Ling, the town rating of Fuyun Town has been upgraded from [Ding Upper] to [C Lower].</p>

    <p>A novice village town can directly complete promotion across progress. This is incredible in the eyes of all players. As mentioned in the previous analysis, there is no need for novice village to make such an investment. The maintenance and upgrading of the town are both problems.</p>

    <p>Unless there is a way to use the demonic power of the surrounding caves as a labor force to mine resources. But this idea is only a theoretical possibility in the eyes of many players.</p>

    <p>Novice stage. Who can challenge the Demon Lord of Baidong alone and take control of the money-counting demon spirit in the early stage?</p>

    <p>No!</p>

    <p>From the moment the game world of Itinerant Immortal was created, countless people tried to accumulate strength in the novice stage, trying to directly control the novice village and the surrounding monster caves. The results all ended in failure!</p>

    <p>So this move by Wang Ling is a record-breaking move!</p>

    <p>The moment the system's world announcement was released, almost all game players were shocked. They couldn't believe that such a terrible player still existed in the world.</p>

    <p>So is this person really new?</p>

    <p>He shouldn't be a newcomer, right?</p>

    <p>If you are a newbie, how can you have such skillful operation?</p>

    <p>Maybe it was a trumpet account opened by some big shot player?</p>

    <p>For a time, many people had different opinions.</p>

    <p>As for the entire world of Itinerant Immortal, Fuyun Town, a small novice village, is the focus. Almost everyone's eyes are focused here.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling. Although he is sitting in Fuyun Town, he has not gone anywhere.</p>

    <p>Originally, the illuminated areas on his map were just small bright spots surrounding Fuyun Town and the demon caves surrounding Fuyun Town.</p>

    <p>In addition, even the hometown of his good-for-nothing identity is kept secret. Because the starting point of his script is in Fuyun Town, he has never been back home.</p>

    <p>But you can see that there is a special home mark on that place.</p>

    <p>And now.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw that the dark map was directly lit up. Players from all over the world of Itinerant Immortal were like clusters of bright torches. With curiosity and desire to explore, they were heading towards Fuyun Town. near.</p>

    <p>As the general in charge of Fuyun Town, Wang Ling can directly see the information that his town is locked by many players.</p>

    <p>They are coming from all over the world to find out what's going on to satisfy their curiosity. Even though Wang Ling hasn't gone anywhere, his dark map is gradually being lit up by major players.</p>

    <p>When the dark areas of the map are broken up bit by bit by the players, the visual impact is self-evident.</p>

    <p>"It seems that many people have noticed us. They are approaching Fuyun Town!" Lao Huang also became excited. He looked at the shared map shown to him by Sun Rong. They all witnessed this shocking scene.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Sun Rong's eyes were also red. There was a kind of touching from the bottom of his heart. No matter what purpose these players came for, but this moment of gathering towards Fuyun Town made Sun Rong feel the virtual world. of fireworks.</p>

    <p>Especially when the players are working together towards a goal. and slowly lighting up the entire dark world. She seemed to see the cohesive force coming from the center...</p>

    <p>Wiping away the tears that couldn't help but swirl due to excitement. Sun Rong quickly calmed down.</p>

    <p>She knew it wasn't time to celebrate yet.</p>

    <p>Many of the players who have gathered here now are driven by curiosity and a desire to explore.</p>

    <p>And there is bound to be no shortage of "Wolongs" who want to take refuge here. As well as intruders with malicious intentions towards Fuyun Town...</p>

    <p>Grasp talents with one hand.</p>

    <p>Prevent intrusion with one hand.</p>

    <p>Having both. That is the key right now.</p>

    <p>Only children make choices.</p>

    <p>She wants them all!</p>
