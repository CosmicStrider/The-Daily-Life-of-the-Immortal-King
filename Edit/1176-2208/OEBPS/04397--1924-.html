  <h1>Chapter 1924 Jing Heqiu comes to visit in person</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In fact, Jing Heqiu didn't understand at all. What is the operation of inviting someone in person? He was just a student in the Foundation Building period. Why did Mr. Teng pay so much attention to it?</p>

    <p>Number 60 High School was originally selected as an exception. If Ivy League veterans had not included Number 60 High School in the list, he is afraid that Number 60 High School would not even be qualified to participate in further selection.</p>

    <p>The qualification to go to the inner world this time is very rare. It is an act of bringing glory to the country. Except for the fact that Shengke is currently number one in the college rankings.</p>

    <p>The roster of the second seven-member team. There is an undercurrent surging in the top 30 colleges and universities privately. Everyone wants to ask for orders to play.</p>

    <p>In fact, the invitation letter to Jiutian Teahouse is also a disguised test of the intelligence gathering capabilities of these universities. If this group of people knew who Teng Lao was, or even guessed a little bit about Teng Lao's identity, they would definitely not refuse the invitation.</p>

    <p>To put it bluntly, so many colleges and universities pay attention to it. But this one was selected as an exception...</p>

    <p>If he lost it, he would lose it. Teng Luchen actually asked him to go and invite him in person.</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu immediately lost his nerve.</p>

    <p>He is the dean of Jiutian Jingmi Academy...</p>

    <p>His position is comparable to that of the deputy leader of the Hundred Schools Alliance. He is stronger than the principals of the cultivation colleges and universities. After all, he is also one of Zhuo Yi's immediate bosses.</p>

    <p>As a result, he was directly sent out to recruit a student from the Foundation Building period.</p>

    <p>What's more, he is not completely unaware of Number 60 High School's "mascot" named Wang.</p>

    <p>He is just a person who has won the championship position in several competitions through luck. Why is he valued so much by Mr. Fuji?</p>

    <p>To be honest, Jing Heqiu's heart was a little broken. If Teng Luchen hadn't had a tough attitude, he would have been reluctant to invite Wang Ling in person.</p>

    <p>But now he really has no choice.</p>

    <p>After all, Mr. Teng has been in the Suzaku Sect incognito for many years. He has scouted many students before and after.</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu could only think that maybe he was blind and failed to see the extraordinary qualities of this mascot.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't know if it's because he has to set aside time to prepare for the competition. Or maybe it's because Teacher Pan is in a particularly good mood. Today's homework for Class 1 and Class 3 was very little. He finished it all at school.</p>

    <p>As a result, Wang Ling began to feel a long-lost sense of emptiness after returning home.</p>

    <p>Is this what it feels like to feel uncomfortable after not doing homework for a day... Sure enough, he is still a child who loves to learn.</p>

    <p>With nothing to do, Wang Ling naturally can only scroll through his phone. Weibo, Douyin, and eating melon on various public platforms is the best way to kill time.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling saw the hot search news recommended by the system: rock singer Mr. Wang Banbi is about to hold a concert.</p>

    <p>At this moment, his heart skipped a beat. He immediately knew that something was going to happen in the entertainment industry again...</p>

    <p>He didn't know if it is because the entrance to the inner earth world has been opened, causing the earth's core to become unstable. Wang Ling found that this year, the entertainment industry seems to be collapsing everywhere. From time to time, there will be a wave of major earthquakes.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that this is a backlash in the entertainment industry. Ultimately, it is because people were too tolerant of artists and idols in the past. But now the country of Huaxiu is gradually growing. The country is peaceful and the people are safe. Under the circumstances of increasingly rich spiritual needs. The people also began to have rich thinking abilities.</p>

    <p>At least, he will no longer be immersed in the world of an idol alone. He will link everything to the star idol.</p>

    <p>As a result, the standards for treating these artists and idol stars have been raised.</p>

    <p>In addition, these star idols nowadays especially like to shape their own personas. In the past, there were some academic masters. Now there are some immortal men and the like... The more extreme the persona is, the more it will collapse once they fall from favor.</p>

    <p>So it's better not to create random characters, because you will often overturn if you are not careful. Wang Ling feels that today's own can be used as a typical case.</p>

    <p>If he had always adhered to the score-pushing policy, he wouldn't have been so stupid this time. But before this monthly exam, he believed Wang Ying's lies...</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling didn't understand it himself. He only got a slightly higher score than usual. Why did he rise to the top of the grade? This is too outrageous!</p>

    <p>He was feeling depressed. At this time, Zhuo Yi suddenly sent him a text message. It was about the inner earth world project.</p>

    <p>Because the decision-making power on this matter does not belong to Zhuo Yi at all. If Wang Ling hadn't asked Zhuo Yi to help investigate. Zhuo Yi would never have known about this plan.</p>

    <p>Therefore, this competition in the inner earth world is of a hidden kind. The upper leadership has no intention of announcing it to the outside world at this stage. Therefore, there is currently no news on the Internet.</p>

    <p>"Master, I asked a lot of people around. Finally I know something about the situation. This time the inner earth world is actually a war between various countries to divide the resources of the inner earth world."</p>

    <p>"But considering that if all countries send their powerful powers to have a fight, it may cause a devastating blow to the inner earth world."</p>

    <p>"So after joint discussions, they came up with the plan to select elite representatives from high school students and send them to the inner earth competition."</p>

    <p>"The person who ultimately wins the competition can obtain limited rights to divide the resource area. And in terms of the divided area, it can be 10% more than other cultivation countries!"</p>

    <p>After seeing the message from Zhuo Yi, Wang Ling nodded thoughtfully. It turned out that this was the idea...</p>

    <p>Indeed. Although the True Immortal realm is nothing in the eyes of Wang Ling, if these True Immortals are really going to fight. They still have the ability to destroy several big cities.</p>

    <p>The resources in the inner earth world are already precious. If these powerful people go to the inner earth world to compete, there may be no resources left in the end.</p>

    <p>So it is indeed the safest to send high school students whose average level is only Foundation Building to Golden Core.</p>

    <p>He's just a high school student. His destructive power is not that strong.</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, Wang Ling felt even more ashamed. Then why the hell would they send him!</p>

    <p>What if he had a nuclear explosion directly in the inner earth???</p>

    <p>The original purpose of not allowing powerful people to compete is to protect the inner earth world.</p>

    <p>As a result, if he is sent in... what is the difference between this and installing a nuclear bomb directly at home!</p>

    <p>At this time, after knowing the whole story, Wang Ling's heart collapsed.</p>

    <p>He had an unknown premonition.</p>

    <p>Although from a probability perspective, the probability of him being selected for the seven-man team was very low, he felt as if he was being stared at by someone.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, the eyes of Wang Ling suddenly turned to the window.</p>

    <p>Not just Wang Ling. Even Er Ha felt a mysterious and powerful aura suddenly appear at the door of the Wang family's villa.</p>

    <p>"The peak of the eighth level of True Immortal realm." Er Ha shook his hair and looked out the window calmly. He immediately made an accurate judgment on the realm of the visitor.</p>

    <p>Although the earth has been upgraded, this means that the overall state of human cultivators will make a big leap in the future, aligning with the divine realm.</p>

    <p>But in the final analysis, judging from the current stage, there are actually only a handful of human cultivators who can reach the eighth level of the True Immortal realm.</p>

    <p>So who is this man? And why does he suddenly appear at the door of his house?</p>
