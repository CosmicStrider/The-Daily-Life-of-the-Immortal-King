  <h1>Chapter 1702 Epidemic Humanization Investigation Team</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Er Ha naturally had his own considerations in choosing Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi. He felt that these two living treasures were of great use, and their identities were not simple. Now that they have become guests of the Office of Strategic Deception, it is equivalent to being one of their own.</p>

    <p>Since both of them are rushing towards Wang Ling to learn this way, they feel that they can just get close to each other.</p>

    <p>After all, it is now the old man of the Office of Strategic Deception. It is reasonable for the old man to bring in new people.</p>

    <p>However, although guest secretary is an honorary position in the Office of Strategic Deception, it is on the same level as the elder in terms of position level. Therefore, it is impossible for Er Ha to show an old-fashioned attitude in front of the two of them. He still needs to remain as polite as possible.</p>

    <p>At eight o'clock that evening. At the Office of Strategic Deception in front of the guest secretary branch.</p>

    <p>Er Ha met with Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi. When he found the two of them, they were playing chess in the yard. They looked like generals. They refused to give in to each other and racked their brains with each other.</p>

    <p>Of course, playing chess also involves a bit of luck. In order to ensure fairness, Qin Zhong will share his luck equally when playing chess. In this way, the fun of playing chess can be fully guaranteed.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, it will be inexplicable to win all kinds of games. You will not even have any gaming experience at all.</p>

    <p>Er Ha did not disturb the two of them. Instead, it waited quietly for the two of them to finish the game of chess. After watching it for a long time, it discovered that both Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi had indescribably handsome faces. Fair and translucent skin and sharp edges and corners. No matter how you look at it, it looks like the protagonist's face.</p>

    <p>Before planning to have this in-depth contact, Er Ha had not inquired about the two of them. He had a general understanding of Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi.</p>

    <p>Both of them had almost reached the point where they were about to reach the top in their own worlds. However, they did not expect to be hit hard by the forced dimensionality reduction after they came to the world line of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Even the universe-level masters I encountered were not on the same level.</p>

    <p>And it was only after they happened to bump into Master Wu Xin this time that both of them realized that there is no end to learning.</p>

    <p>Let me add something by the way.</p>

    <p>That is, in order to make sure that the learning attitude is serious enough, Xiang Yi's real body is re-tuned with the shadow after meeting with his own daughter-in-law.</p>

    <p>What is in front of Er Ha now is the real Xiang Yi.</p>

    <p>"Hey. Lost again." Xiang Yi scratched his head in frustration.</p>

    <p>After waiting for only a few minutes, the two people decided on the winner.</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong achieved complete victory without relying on luck.</p>

    <p>His chess skills are not too weak to begin with. Even without the blessing of luck, he can be almost impeccable. The only person Qin Zhong has lost in playing chess is Gu Shunzhi.</p>

    <p>To be honest, after coming to the world of Wang Ling, he actually wanted to meet Gu Shunzhi. But he never found a suitable opportunity.</p>

    <p>The Gu Shunzhi timeline at this time was before his current achievements. He had not yet been sent to his universe to become his cultivation manager.</p>

    <p>In other words, it's just not as strong as it was then...</p>

    <p>"You two, I have a mission here." Er Ha said. And he tells the story of the Epidemic in a simple and concise way.</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi understood immediately.</p>

    <p>"In other words, the task that Elder Toad has received now is to find those people who were invaded by the Thought Plague, right?" Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi nodded after listening.</p>

    <p>"That's right. This is a direct order from the Lord." Er Ha said: "The key point now is to find out the source."</p>

    <p>"The source..."</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong held his chin and thought carefully: "When we were in the Science and Technology City earlier, Senior Li Xian and Senior Zhang Zhui did not act with us. Could it be that they were invaded? Or maybe they had something to achieve. Something that invaded a large area came out of the science and technology city?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha and Xiang Yi were both stunned when they heard this.</p>

    <p>Because as far as they knew, the only thing Li Xian and Zhang Zhui brought out from the Science and Technology City was the chip that Wang Ming designated after using brain waves to invade the wealthy businessmen of the Science and Technology City who did not return.</p>

    <p>No way...</p>

    <p>Is it such a coincidence?</p>

    <p>Although Qin Zhong does not have the blessings of Chen Chao, because of his unparalleled luck, sometimes it is not a problem to hit the mark.</p>

    <p>This made Er Ha and Xiang Yi extremely alert for a moment. If the source of infection really comes from Wang Ming... when the thought plague invades Wang Ming's body, with Wang Ming's powerful brain wave power, he may be able to achieve great results in an instant.</p>

    <p>And the serious consequences of this invasion are probably incalculable...</p>

    <p>"Then where should we start now?" Xiang Yi asked.</p>

    <p>"How about going to find Senior Gu?" At this time, Qin Zhong suggested.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Xiang Yi, Er Ha was silent for a while.</p>

    <p>It's okay if Qin Zhong didn't mention it. This mention... it's possible that the first person they were looking for during this trip was Gu Shunzhi. I'm afraid he has been invaded.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After Er Ha left. Wang Ling noticed a news break.</p>

    <p>This was a car accident that occurred near the Wang family's small villa. A psionic three-wheeler delivering couriers crashed into a self-driving car.</p>

    <p>The courier boy and a couple were killed together.</p>

    <p>The couple used their bodies to protect their daughter before they died, resulting in three deaths and one injury.</p>

    <p>Car accidents happen every day. This is not surprising.</p>

    <p>But as luck would have it, the guy who delivered the courier was the same guy who gave Sun Rong the human-shaped gift box before.</p>

    <p>That coffin... oh no. It's a human-shaped gift box, so there's something inherently wrong with it. Then there's a high possibility that the courier guy has been hacked.</p>

    <p>Although in the big explosion of the car accident, the courier boy and the poor couple were burned into shape and their appearance was almost indistinguishable.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling has King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>You can still directly restore their original appearance through your own pupil power.</p>

    <p>Judging from the explosive force generated at the scene, it is a miracle that the little girl survived.</p>

    <p>But the little girl not only survived. There were not many injuries on her body. There were only a few traces of burns. This made Wang Ling have to start to doubt whether this little girl was really a little girl.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling first found the courier tracking number of the guy who sent the humanoid gift box. From the tracking number, you can directly find the guy's work number. You can know the guy's accurate personal information by making a complaint through manual customer service.</p>

    <p>Then, he activated the Sage Immortal Book remotely and found out the girl's name: Chen Xiaomu.</p>

    <p>Then I followed this information and found Chen Xiaomu's parents' information.</p>

    <p>After getting the information of the three people, he teleported directly to the morgue of the hospital.</p>

    <p>Outside the morgue of the Ninth cultivation People's Hospital, several family members cried into a group, through the thick iron door Wang Ling can hear the heartbreaking cries.</p>

    <p>He sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>Although directly resurrecting these three people is against Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>But after all, the source of the deaths of these three people was still the ancient beings. It was not an ordinary accident.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling feels that there is no harm in resurrecting these three people.</p>

    <p>Of course. Even if he is a Heavenly Dao whitelist user, the process seems a bit irregular.</p>

    <p>So when Wang Ling teleported to the morgue of this hospital, he also called Heavenly Dao, who was currently working as a guard at the gate of No. 60 Middle School, to come here.</p>

    <p>In this way.</p>

    <p>They are all resurrected by heaven after death.</p>

    <p>What's it got to do with him?</p>
