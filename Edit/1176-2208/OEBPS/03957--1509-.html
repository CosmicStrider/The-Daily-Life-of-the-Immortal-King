  <h1>Chapter 1509 A simple and unpretentious little romance</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Jiudaohe High School's S-level class. The average strength peaked in the later stages of the Foundation Building.</p>

    <p>Among the twelve students, excluding Wang Ling, three have already entered the Golden Core realm in their first year of high school.</p>

    <p>This overall combat strength level is indeed above the level of Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>Of course. The above mentioned...actually excludes Wang Ling, Sun Rong, Zhenyuan, Gu Shunzhi, Fang Xing, Wang Zhen, Liu Qingyi and other core members of the Office of Strategic Deception. above the "level."</p>

    <p>If we include the core members of the Office of Strategic Deception who infiltrated Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid Number 60 High School is a freshman class. It is ranked first in the world.</p>

    <p>The combat power of all the high school schools in the world, even if it were to circle the earth three times, might not be worth one billionth of the combat power of Number 60 High SchoolWang Ling's elite class.</p>

    <p>It sounds like an exaggeration.</p>

    <p>But that's the truth.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling actually didn't expect that when he was so entangled, Sun Rong would choose this time to take action.</p>

    <p>Although what he said seemed a bit hateful.</p>

    <p>But it did solve his urgent need.</p>

    <p>He was in the first row and column of the classroom. Akano Jisaki looked at the fragments of the energy ball in his hand. His heart couldn't calm down for a long time.</p>

    <p>Obviously. If it is just an ordinary Foundation Building period.</p>

    <p>It is absolutely impossible to shatter the energy balls of the entire class with just the psychic energy waves that he releases.</p>

    <p>Even Jisaki himself cannot do this.</p>

    <p>Sure enough...this terrible woman is still as difficult as before!</p>

    <p>As for the "late Foundation Building period" shown on the student status information, it must be an illusion...</p>

    <p>He judged that Sun Rong's combat power was at least at the late Golden Core level.</p>

    <p>A freshman in high school.</p>

    <p>To be able to reach the situation of the late Golden Core...</p>

    <p>Jisaki felt scared and panicked.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, he listened to his aunt Jiugong Xinghui and did not attack the eldest lady directly.</p>

    <p>This woman is really scary.</p>

    <p>He thought that after working hard and practicing hard for so many years, he could finally get away from this terrible woman.</p>

    <p>However, it turned out that no matter what efforts he made.</p>

    <p>Still hard to come by.</p>

    <p>In fact, regardless of combat power.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's combat power is not inferior to that of Jisaki.</p>

    <p>Although the girl's strength is still at the peak of the later stage of Foundation Building, this is actually the result of Sun Rong's forcibly suppressed realm after many times of "cleaning reagents."</p>

    <p>If a cultivator wants to improve his realm, the concentration of spiritual roots in his body needs to reach a certain level before he can break through.</p>

    <p>The so-called "scouring reagent" is actually a concentration diluent.</p>

    <p>Able to develop a person's potential to the greatest extent.</p>

    <p>If you are promoted when your potential is fully developed, you will be able to go further in the future.</p>

    <p>Therefore, according to the normal progress of cultivation, Sun Rong will be able to break through the Golden Core a long time ago.</p>

    <p>Therefore, from the beginning, the girl did not take this group of arrogant and conceited people in Jiudaohe seriously.</p>

    <p>Her eyes were always careful and cautious.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid these people are deliberately looking for trouble with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>It's not because I'm afraid of Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>The main concern is that the lives of those who are looking for trouble may be in danger.</p>

    <p>How convenient it is to find fault.</p>

    <p>If you look for it, you will die. Isn't it a loss of blood?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was time for lunch. Wang Ling The group followed to Jiudaohe's canteen.</p>

    <p>Just like classrooms, Jiudaohe's cafeteria also adopts a grading system.</p>

    <p>And the class division is very obvious.</p>

    <p>The lowest class is Class D. The divided dining area is made of cold wooden seats. It looks a bit hard.</p>

    <p>Class C's treatment is better. There is also a small soft cushion made of silicone on the wooden seat.</p>

    <p>Class B's leather chair. Class A's boss chair...of course. The one with the best treatment is the fully automatic massage sofa seat of Class S.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was secretly surprised by such a distinction.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, Sun Rong is in charge of everything.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling felt that the girl was like a Valkyrie protecting her calf at this moment. She was on the strongest side and her aura was amazing.</p>

    <p>Many people were afraid to approach for a while...</p>

    <p>Both Wang Ming and Wang Ling discovered it.</p>

    <p>This seems to be another "Sun Rong field."</p>

    <p>"It actually has the function of adapting to local conditions?" Wang Ming smiled inwardly.</p>

    <p>He could see that the "Sun Rong domain" power in the girl had such abilities.</p>

    <p>It will switch to different modes depending on the environment.</p>

    <p>For example, in a low-risk area like Number 59 High School. "Sun Rong Area" takes a people-friendly route. It can make all nearby people involuntarily and slowly turn into "fans"...</p>

    <p>After all, Number 59 High School is still in the country.</p>

    <p>It's true that the students of Number 59 High School don't study together normally. But once it comes to some competition, they can always meet up with each other.</p>

    <p>Therefore, running the "Sun Rong field" of "people-friendly line" is actually an act of paving the way for oneself.</p>

    <p>But the situation in Jiudaohe is different from that of Number 59 High School.</p>

    <p>This is a foreign country. And they are here as exchange students. I am afraid it will be difficult for them to have a chance to meet each other in the future.</p>

    <p>So there is no need to take the "people-friendly" route.</p>

    <p>Of course. The most important thing is actually what Sun Rong thinks. From the moment Wang Ling entered Jiudaohe High School, the girls in Jiudaohe have been taking a peek at Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>This made the girl instinctively feel unhappy.</p>

    <p>And immediately regarded Jiudaohe as a "hostile and dangerous area."</p>

    <p>And since it is a dangerous area, the "people-friendly route" of "Sun Rong area" was instantly switched to the "aura suppression route"...</p>

    <p>She was holding the dinner plate. One person was at the front. All the eyes looking at her were obviously filled with fear.</p>

    <p>"Pretty girls in adolescence are really scary..." Wang Ming followed behind. He couldn't help but smile bitterly in his heart and grunted.</p>

    <p>This was also the first time he saw Sun Rong look like someone owed her hundreds of millions.</p>

    <p>This calf guard is a bit too obvious...</p>

    <p>But it doesn't matter anymore.</p>

    <p>Because he saw the expression on Wang Ling's face. It was much calmer than he imagined.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming knows too much.</p>

    <p>Originally, in a completely unfamiliar environment abroad, his little brother Wang Ling would have felt various discomforts.</p>

    <p>This can be regarded as a kind of "social phobia" accumulated in childhood.</p>

    <p>Every time after arriving in a new environment, my face would turn pale for a long time before I could recover.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming remembers the most painful time. It was when he was in junior high school.</p>

    <p>Because of the new environment. Wang Ling turned pale...</p>

    <p>It actually caused many girls in the upper grades of the junior high school to fall in love with him.</p>

    <p>It is said that among the new students in this class, there is a cute little boy with a face as white as jade...</p>

    <p>God's face is as white as jade!</p>

    <p>Look at how those wolves and tigers scared the children...</p>

    <p>This kind of "social phobia" was relieved a lot after Wang Ling entered Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>Now Wang Ling is not as serious as before.</p>

    <p>But sometimes there are too many strangers around me, and I still feel a little uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>Therefore. In Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's calmness now is all thanks to Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Under the leadership of Sun Rong, the three of them found a seat near the corner. Wang Ling sat directly on the innermost sofa.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming, on the other hand, sat directly next to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Eh...</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin cooperated tacitly and sat directly opposite Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>The two of them sat like that on purpose.</p>

    <p>Because this way.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong can only sit across from Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>It is also a simple and simple little romance for adolescent boys and girls to eat together face to face...</p>
