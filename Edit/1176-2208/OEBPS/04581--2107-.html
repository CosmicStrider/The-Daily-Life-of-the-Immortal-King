  <h1>Chapter 2107 Knowledge is power</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Right now, cooperation in acting is the key. Of course there is no problem with Sun Rong cooperating. But in fact Wang Ling also knows very well that this is not a long-term solution.</p>

    <p>Sooner or later, there will be a showdown with Sun Ru. And Sun Ru must know that Sun Yiyuan is the real head of the Sun family today.</p>

    <p>As for now...</p>

    <p>The situation is too complicated. The remains of the ancestors of the Sun family have disappeared. The situation in the maritime restricted area is not yet stable. There are too many forces entangled together. It is really difficult to explain all this to Sun Ru for a while.</p>

    <p>One less thing is worse than one more thing. We can only hide the matter for the time being. It won't be too late to show off the cards after everything is smoothed out.</p>

    <p>But now that Sun Ru has arrived, her living arrangement in the human world has become a new problem.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thinks it is more convenient to follow the old rules. That is Wei Zhi family...</p>

    <p>Speaking of Wei Zhi. Wang Ling remember that there is also a close business relationship between Wei Zhi and the Office of Strategic Deception. He is basically the spiritual beast consultant of the Office of Strategic Deception. He is responsible for raising various categories for the Office of Strategic Deception's spiritual beasts.</p>

    <p>There is no need to worry about living expenses anymore. And most importantly, all the food rations for the spirit beasts living in Wei Zhi's apartment will be reimbursed by the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>This allowed Wei Zhi to save a lot of money and at the same time, he could concentrate on doing big things.</p>

    <p>"Who is this old gentleman who fainted?"</p>

    <p>Everyone was preparing to evacuate from the ancestral land. Sun Ru suddenly saw Sun Rong helping Boss Sun on the side and asked quickly.</p>

    <p>"This is my grandpa." Sun Rong replied.</p>

    <p>As she answered, she winked at Er Qiao beside her, telling him not to talk too much.</p>

    <p>This "Qiao Yanyuan" from another parallel dimension is extremely cautious. He is also very clever. Although his level is low, he still has this bit of discernment.</p>

    <p>Although Er Qiao didn't know what happened, and what kind of relationship there was between the group of people who appeared in front of him.</p>

    <p>But he came here to ask for help.</p>

    <p>He doesn't need to worry about other things. After expressing his demands, he can just wait and see what happens.</p>

    <p>"That's it." Sun Ru nodded. She looked at Sun Yiyuan carefully. After realizing that Sun Yiyuan was currently only in the True Immortal realm, she sighed: "I didn't expect that the descendants of our Sun family would eventually decline."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>The rest of the crowd: "..."</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Ru's face was full of disappointment. But soon her eyes became bright and clear again. She looked at Wang Ling with her cute-looking face: "Hey, the master of the family's fighting power is so extraordinary, why are the descendants under him so weak? Or is it that the head of the family has not cultivated his own descendants?"</p>

    <p>As soon as these words came out, Immortal Toya and Immortal Zhenyuan, almost couldn't hold back their laughter and spit out their saliva.</p>

    <p>They are professional monks. They don't laugh... unless they can't help it.</p>

    <p>But the problem is. This really hits the point of laughter!</p>

    <p>So, they held it back until their faces turned red. This scene actually made Sun Ru a little embarrassed. She thought it was Immortal Toya and Zhenyuan who were angry. Seeing that their faces were almost twisted from holding it in, they hurriedly Apology: "Sorry. My question was so rude..."</p>

    <p>She actually didn't think much about the underlying reason behind this.</p>

    <p>On the contrary, Sun Rong couldn't help but start having a daydream in her mind after hearing these words.</p>

    <p>She stared at Wang Ling's almost perfect profile face. The expression on her face was slightly red. While supporting Sun Yiyuan, she buried her head and looked at Wang Ling with her peripheral vision.</p>

    <p>She couldn't calm down in her heart. Even after returning to the submarine, she still couldn't calm down.</p>

    <p>"Hey, I heard quite a bit of commotion coming from inside. How's it going? Is everything done?" asked Mr. Canghu. He had been waiting beside the submarine for a long time, and as agreed, he did not go deep into the ancestral land, but only did some geological research in the shallowest layer.</p>

    <p>In addition, he also had a brief exchange with this ancient whale of unknown origin.</p>

    <p>It's a pity that this ancient whale is quite aloof and has been ignoring him.</p>

    <p>Just as everyone was preparing to leave in the submarine, Mr. Canghu's sudden words once again attracted everyone's attention.</p>

    <p>"By the way. I've always wanted to ask. Who is this girl?" He looked at Sun Ru.</p>

    <p>"It's my Great-Great-Grandmother... who has always lived in the ancestral land and never came out. This time she decided to go out and live with us." Sun Rong explained quickly.</p>

    <p>But Mr. Canghu still felt that there was something inexplicably wrong. As a knowledgeable popular science scholar in the world of cultivation, it can only be said that Mr. Canghu is worthy of being called Mr. Canghu. He is far less easy to fool than everyone thinks.</p>

    <p>He still saw the clues through his profound knowledge.</p>

    <p>His eyes twitching. He looked Sun Ru up and down carefully. Then he analyzed: "The Cloud-Piercing Golden Dragon Scale Saber on the back does not look like a modern or ancient thing. The inscription grooves on it and the precision of the carving. It was undoubtedly the work of the mighty craftsman. And..."</p>

    <p>As he spoke, he stretched out his hand and flicked the sword lightly with his knuckles. A strange sound came out immediately, like a muffled thunder on a sunny day. The sound was trembling and lasted for a long time.</p>

    <p>"Obviously. This is a kind of spiritual mineral that is fused with thunder elements and has a special texture. I have only heard of it in the ancient book {Lingshan Guangji}. But this ancient book was written by ancient monks... so this sword. It's an ancient thing. It's priceless!"</p>

    <p>Everyone: "..."</p>

    <p>Knowledge is power. Wang Ling and Sun Rong looked at each other. They didn't expect that Mr. Canghu really had something. He could analyze so many things with just his observation ability.</p>

    <p>Sun Ru is a genuine ancient monk. Although she is not as good as the Eternal One, Sun Ru's current realm is also Dao God. It is equivalent to the realm of the ten masters of the current God's Domain.</p>

    <p>This is not something that ordinary earth monks can come into contact with. But Mr. Canghu is able to break the rules and conduct hard-core analysis through his own knowledge.</p>

    <p>And basically, it's pretty much correct.</p>

    <p>Mr. Canghu squinted his eyes and continued his analysis: "Of course, what surprises me most is not the golden sword... but the jade armor on your grandma's body. If you look carefully. You will find that every piece of jade on this jade armor has very fine and dense lines inside."</p>

    <p>"As far as I know, this is an ability built into the spiritual pattern. It is necessary to practice the sword's mind. Under the premise that the sword's mind have reached a certain level, the spiritual power can be embodied to form a spiritual carving knife, and then precision carving can be carried out."</p>

    <p>"By opening a small knife edge, pouring in spiritual energy, and carving spiritual patterns at the same time. After shaping, these spiritual patterns can form something similar to the meridians of the human body."</p>

    <p>"Not only can it be used as a storage device for spiritual energy. It can also be used for one's own use at critical moments to increase combat power."</p>

    <p>"And the most important thing is that it can maintain its youth forever to a certain extent. If it is buried after death and dug up thousands of years later, its appearance can still maintain its youth and be lifelike."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
