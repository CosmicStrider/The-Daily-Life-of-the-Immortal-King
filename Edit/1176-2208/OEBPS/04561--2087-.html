  <h1>Chapter 2087 Human-to-human transmission of ideological changes occurs</h1>

  <div>

    <p>What will be the reaction when human-to-human transmission of ideological dissemination occurs?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Even though his face was paralyzed, the expression on his face still made the corners of his mouth twitch several times at the speed of light... because it was a shock coming from within.</p>

    <p>In my memory, it started when Father Wang used the pen name Wang Situ. After experiencing the initial trough period, the creative path became smoother.</p>

    <p>Especially when Father Wang himself found out that even Master Emperor also watched Xiuzhen and was also his fan. The excitement was self-evident.</p>

    <p>However, the Wang family has always advocated keeping a low profile. Even if they were excited, they would not express it in person. Therefore, when Emperor came to visit the Wang family's villa several times, Father Wang seemed extremely calm.</p>

    <p>Now Wang Ling thought about it carefully. He felt that maybe it was Father Wang's calmness that gave Master Emperor the illusion of being a worldly master...</p>

    <p>And since Mr. Emperor came into contact with Father Wang, Father Wang's performance has almost skyrocketed. He writes a popular book without mentioning it. Sometimes he even just draws up an outline and is rushed by Party A to buy the copyright.</p>

    <p>And the origins of these Party A are not simple. They are either the masters of heaven-level sects or famous entrepreneurs in the cultivation circle. Somehow, all of them claim to be fans of Father Wang.</p>

    <p>Even Father Wang himself is baffled as to why his mediocre writing can attract so many readers.</p>

    <p>Following the trend and herd mentality on the Internet directly made Father Wang the most popular writer in the Internet literary circle.</p>

    <p>But to be honest. In fact, Wang Ling, the son, doesn't quite understand what is so good about Father Wang's book. The characters are so faceless. There is not a single chapter left unsaid about the plot. The jokes are also special. It's dense. People without any experience or knowledge can't understand where the laughter lies.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that the heroine in the book can actually disappear for more than a thousand chapters... it was not until the middle period that a large part of the plot was rearranged.</p>

    <p>If I am not the biological child of Father Wang. Wang Ling feels that the author of this online article may have been kicked in the head by a donkey.</p>

    <p>He was puzzled to understand how Emperor became obsessed with Father Wang's books.</p>

    <p>As a result, I didn't expect to get the answer today...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Zhang Zhui fell into silence for a long time on the sea surface where the smell of fresh blood oozed from the Shark King.</p>

    <p>It was a shock. But in Yi Jianchuan's view, he felt that Zhang Zhui seemed to be remembering something: "Do you know this person?"</p>

    <p>"I don't know." Zhang Zhui shook his head naturally. And he was very decisive.</p>

    <p>He is a veteran of the Jianghu. And this lie has been told from eternity to now.</p>

    <p>Even if it is a false statement, he will not blush or even have a slight expression when it comes out of his mouth.</p>

    <p>Therefore, even the swordsman Yi Jianchuan, who is also an old martial artist, did not find anything unusual. Compared to Zhang Zhui, there is still a gap in his conduct.</p>

    <p>After shaking his head, Zhang Zhui added: "The name Wang Situ and the name Wang Jiao have never been heard of in all eternity. Maybe I have other friends who know about it. But at least, I have never heard of it."</p>

    <p>"Is that so?"</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan frowned: "So Mr. Emperor is just a suspicion after all. He has no evidence to prove Wang Jiao's identity. He just thinks that this person is unusual. If it is an eternal person, such a powerful person, the child should be born as well. Very strong. But his son, Mr. Emperor, has gone to observe. His aura is unremarkable. Except for that pretty face, he has almost no cultivation talent at all. He is estimated to have cultivated to the Golden Core in this life. That's it. It's over."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Moreover, Mr. Tenglu Chenteng from Jiutian Jingmiyuan has also gone to verify it. I think this child is just like that. At most, he is just a little lucky. Some immortal fate has been added to his luck. Therefore, he participates in various competitions. Can successfully win the championship."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui heard this and suppressed his laughter.</p>

    <p>Although this is not the first time I have heard other people's comments about Wang Ling from other people's mouths, such derogatory comments are really rare.</p>

    <p>"Master Emperor has been paying attention for many years. Didn't he find anything at all?"</p>

    <p>"Honestly. No."</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan shook his head and said: "In other words, he may have discovered some clues. He just didn't tell me directly. Wang Situ's family gave birth to a daughter a while ago. Lord Emperor even went to observe it and found that their daughter. It's very ordinary. The whole family is just an ordinary person."</p>

    <p>After saying that, he sighed and waved his hand: "That's all. Let's not discuss these for now. The things in front of us are more important."</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan looked at the sea surface stained with blood and frowned slightly.</p>

    <p>He could probably guess that this kind of spiritual beast that far exceeded the level of the earth world must be instigated by someone behind the scenes and did it deliberately.</p>

    <p>So anyone who has the ability to summon such a monster is probably an Eternal One.</p>

    <p>"Get in the car." Seeing that Shark King had been knocked over by Zhang Zhui, he called Zhang Zhui again to get on the little white dragon in the waves.</p>

    <p>"Sword Master wait."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui stopped him.</p>

    <p>"What else?"</p>

    <p>"You should know who you are going to face next. I don't think you need to follow us. It's probably safest to leave with Muyu."</p>

    <p>"You are the One of Eternity. I am the Sword Master of this world. Why should I be afraid."</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan smiled and said: "I can open up the sea of spiritual energy and rise to a sudden level. I can kill those Hong Si Qi. Naturally, I can also kill other people."</p>

    <p>This is the true fearlessness of the sword. Even without a sword in your hand, you can accomplish great things just by relying on the faith in your heart.</p>

    <p>Just such a state of mind. Not even many eternal beings have it.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui knew that there were some Eternals who had escaped from the Supreme Corpse Map and even joined other races in the universe. In order to survive, they had to endure hardships to survive in the universe.</p>

    <p>Some of them are princes of the same clan, or key descendants of bloodline inheritance.</p>

    <p>If this sword master had been alive forever, he probably would not have done such a spineless thing.</p>

    <p>"It seems that you should have known that this accident would happen." At this time, when Zhang Zhui was stunned. Yi Jianchuan said again.</p>

    <p>"I probably guessed that he would take action. But I didn't expect that he would do it in this way."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui sighed. Although he rescued more than 70% of the people, when the Shark Emperor first appeared, he still killed 30% of the monks from all over the world.</p>

    <p>And they were not injured. They were crushed into powder and blended into the air. There was no chance of treatment.</p>

    <p>"The more arrogant the enemy is. The more he wants to use this method to intimidate. It means the more afraid he is. On the contrary, he doesn't want his affairs to be exposed here."</p>

    <p>"I guess. I'm afraid the other party didn't expect that one day so many monks would break into this deserted Earth Sea restricted area at the same time."</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan guessed a lot. He couldn't help laughing.</p>

    <p>Then, his expression suddenly became solemn: "I don't care what his origin is, but this restricted area of the sea is already the territory jointly owned by the monks of our earth. Those who offend our earth will be punished no matter how far away they are! Anyone who offends our earth will be punished even though they are far away. The strong will be killed!"</p>
