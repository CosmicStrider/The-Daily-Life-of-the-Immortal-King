  <h1>Chapter 1498 Wang Ling? Isn't it a mascot?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>According to the current speed of immortal boat sailing, the entire journey from Songhai City to Sun Island takes 4 hours.</p>

    <p>Originally, the distance to Sun Island was not that far. But as the glaciers in the Antarctic and Arctic melted, the sea level rose. The strong backflow storms formed at the poles lost by the resistance of the glaciers. In the end, they pushed the entire Sun Island forward...</p>

    <p>In a timeline of hundreds of years.</p>

    <p>Today's Sun Island has drifted near the equator.</p>

    <p>The distance becomes longer, and the air route of the immortal boat also becomes farther.</p>

    <p>In the business class. Wang Ling looked calmly at the cloud scenery outside the window. The clouds that were dazzling by the sun flew back.</p>

    <p>But in the eyes of Wang Ling, this speed is really too slow.</p>

    <p>And this is one of the reasons why Wang Ling finds it troublesome to go abroad.</p>

    <p>The current immortal boat in the world of cultivation. Its sailing speed really makes Wang Ling dare not compliment it. If it weren't for the Sun Island exchange student plan, it has to go through legal channels... Wang Ling does directly use the Wang Ling technique }Past impulses.</p>

    <p>Anyway, as long as he teleports fast enough, no one can discover him.</p>

    <p>It was approaching eleven o'clock. There was still no movement from the man who was secretly watching in the first class cabin.</p>

    <p>The whole voyage seemed to be harmonious and smooth.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming is using the smart eye equipped with Wang Ling Number 3 to watch movies. He only needs to extract the fragments of the eye and splice them together.</p>

    <p>However, he still maintained full vigilance.</p>

    <p>Five minutes later, the business class service light came on. A stewardess pushed a huge luxurious dining car with a dazzling array of food. She walked slowly from the sky kitchen at the front of the business class.</p>

    <p>The meals in business class are relatively rich and have everything.</p>

    <p>Just ask for what you want to eat from the menu.</p>

    <p>The flight attendant will take the food, arrange it on the plate and put it in front of your eyes. If you don't have enough, you can refill it.</p>

    <p>"Give me a children's meal. Thank you."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming glanced at the menu and felt that it was too troublesome to order a single order, so he directly selected the combination on the menu.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>The stewardess was stunned. Although he had never seen a child under 1.8 meters, since this was the customer's request, of course she had no choice but to comply.</p>

    <p>The children's set meal also has a rich variety of combinations. Assorted vegetables, exquisite hamburger steak with a little red flag, side dishes of fried golden fish balls and grilled chicken wings, plus guacamole for garnish.</p>

    <p>In addition, there is a fruit ice cream and a cup of sugar-free happy water.</p>

    <p>I have to say, the stewardess is very skilled in her business.</p>

    <p>She quickly picked up the food according to the contents of the set meal and started plating. She moved very quickly. It took less than 1 minute to present the children's set meal to Wang Ming: "Sir, your children's set meal."</p>

    <p>"Thank you." Wang Ming nodded with satisfaction.</p>

    <p>Then he saw the flight attendant turn her eyes to Sun Rong and Wang Ling: "What do you two want to eat? Do you want one? How about the couple's set meal?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong immediately felt the fire burning to the base of his ears. He was so shy that he quickly buried his face: "Well... we are not..."</p>

    <p>"Sorry. I was abrupt."</p>

    <p>The stewardess covered her mouth and smiled slightly: "So. Do you want to try the table-sharing meal?"</p>

    <p>"Table meal plan?"</p>

    <p>"Because there are often student groups on our flights, that's why we have the "tablemate package" design. It can enhance friendship." The stewardess replied with a smile.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong blushed and looked at Wang Ling: "Classmate Wang Ling. What do you think?"</p>

    <p>"kindness."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded. As always, he cherished words like gold.</p>

    <p>He is not picky about food. In fact, it doesn't matter what he eats.</p>

    <p>As a result, when the stewardess brought the set meal, Wang Ling and Sun Rong were both dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>Because it's a big plate. And there's everything on it...</p>

    <p>"Just one portion?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. The table-sharing set meal is originally a plate. The meal is for two people." The flight attendant smiled.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"How to eat from this plate..."</p>

    <p>"Of course we will eat together." The stewardess continued with a smile: "Look. Is there something like a chalk line in the middle of this oval plate? This is actually a 38 line made of snow-colored caviar."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Since it is a set meal that enhances friendship, of course eating it together can enhance friendship."</p>

    <p>Just as the stewardess finished speaking, she suddenly heard the sound of an old-fashioned steam train in the air.</p>

    <p>Obviously. Sun Rong became a steam girl again...</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was looking on in amusement. While eating the hamburger steak in the children's set meal, he couldn't help but recite a poem: "Boundless shame is falling. Steam rolls in endlessly..." What a poem!</p>

    <p>Now. Sun Rong finally found out. Since she experienced the "Yin and Yang Death Tribulation" incident.</p>

    <p>She always seems to be on the way to being teased.</p>

    <p>In fact, the real table-sharing package is not like this.</p>

    <p>But everyone has a time when they are young.</p>

    <p>She saw it. From the moment Sun Rong got on the immortal boat, the girl's eyes fell on the young man's face and never stopped.</p>

    <p>The light in her eyes was gentle but full of strength. It made the stewardess think of many things at once.</p>

    <p>What it feels like to fall in love with someone. Everyone who has been there knows it.</p>

    <p>It's not just a racing heart and a blush.</p>

    <p>But when two people are in the same space, it seems that only the figure of the person in their heart is in sight.</p>

    <p>So at that moment, the flight attendant was sure of one thing.</p>

    <p>The handsome young man in front of her is the only light in the girl's sight...</p>

    <p>Lunch or not. It doesn't really matter.</p>

    <p>As long as her intention can be conveyed, it will be a success.</p>

    <p>"You two, please use it slowly."</p>

    <p>The stewardess always had a smile on her face. She pushed the dining car to the end of the business car.</p>

    <p>Then another layer was taken out from under the luxury dining car and a small dining car was taken out.</p>

    <p>The food on the small dining car is packaged lunch boxes. In the first class, there are more box lunches to choose from and more side dishes.</p>

    <p>As for economy class, there is no other choice.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, the cabins are different. The treatment at this level is also very different...</p>

    <p>He saw the flight attendant using her work badge to carefully open the door connecting business class and first class, and was about to push the cart through.</p>

    <p>As a result, the originally peaceful immortal boat suddenly experienced a tremor.</p>

    <p>The flight attendant was experienced. She quickly pressed the brake button of the dining car and then held the handle next to her.</p>

    <p>Normal airflow turbulence occurs from time to time.</p>

    <p>As a professionally trained flight attendant, she has extremely high professional qualities.</p>

    <p>Preparing to confirm the situation with the cab via inlay phone.</p>

    <p>As soon as the phone was raised, the flight attendant seemed to hear something. Her face immediately changed drastically. She turned pale!</p>

    <p>Then. I heard a "buzz!" Another strong jolt came.</p>

    <p>But this time, the entire immortal boat actually began to tilt to the right.</p>

    <p>"The situation. Not quite right..."</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ming frowned.</p>

    <p>"It's the cab." Sun Rong responded at a constant speed.</p>

    <p>Judging from the reaction of the flight attendant before, she judged that something unexpected happened in the cab.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, there had been no movement in the cab before. When Aohai's sword energy was tested again, a feeling of chill came directly along the sword energy, making the girl shudder violently.</p>

    <p>"This is... a ghost?" Sun Rong was stunned.</p>

    <p>The look on Wang Ling's face was equally astonishing. Because the cab was right in front of the business class cabin.</p>

    <p>During this period, except for the flight attendants, no one else passed by. How did this ghost pass through the business class and get into the cab?</p>

    <p>But they were surprised. But the three people in the business class did not show any panic. They were already calm and found the matter interesting.</p>

    <p>"Your Majesty, please find a way to stabilize the immortal boat. Let Miss Rong and I deal with this invading ghost." Wang Ming said through brainwave transmission.</p>

    <p>At this stage, it's not time for Wang Ling to intervene. It's just a few minions.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming felt that at this level, even he and Sun Rong couldn't get through it.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is their trump card.</p>

    <p>Since it's your trump card, don't reveal it easily.</p>

    <p>This was in the sky. Wang Ming thought that if Wang Ling made a move, what if his aim was not accurate?</p>

    <p>This ghost may die together with the immortal boat.</p>

    <p>It will really be a plane crash then...</p>

    <p>Therefore, Wang Ling also fully agrees with Wang Ming's decision at this moment.</p>

    <p>The three of them work together in perfect harmony.</p>

    <p>After hearing the commands issued by Wang Ming's brain waves.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling leaned on his position calmly.</p>

    <p>He lightly tapped the seat support with one finger.</p>

    <p>In an instant, the immortal boat, which was about to roll over, was easily corrected.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ming, who had changed into Wang Ling's Number 3 mecha, stood up from his seat together with Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>The division of labor between the two is clear.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming went straight to the cab. And Sun Rong was responsible for logistics processing.</p>

    <p>Aohai's sword energy has healing power. The moment Sun Rong stood up, the surging sword energy spread out like ripples with the warm blue aura centered on the girl.</p>

    <p>At this moment. Sun Rong suddenly transformed into a "moving water spring" with a huge radiation range.</p>

    <p>The azure aura spread out in circles, calming the anxious thoughts of all the passengers on the immortal boat.</p>

    <p>And those who were injured are gradually recovering...</p>

    <p>"Ah? What happened? The wound is actually healed?"</p>

    <p>"Is someone using a healing spell?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, my God! My silicone implant just broke. And the silicone just flowed back into my chest from the wound... How did that happen?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>The passengers had no idea what was going on.</p>

    <p>But the situation seems to have stabilized.</p>

    <p>This made everyone breathe a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>"What on earth... is going on?"</p>

    <p>First class cabin. The person who was sent by Jiugong Xiushi to protect Wang Ling and the others - Makino Ling.</p>

    <p>At this moment, there was a look of confusion on his face.</p>

    <p>He had no idea what was going on.</p>

    <p>Little did he know that he was clearly here to protect. As a result, he now became the target of "protection"...</p>

    <p>But one thing is certain.</p>

    <p>Just now, the immortal boat suddenly turned over. It was definitely not caused by turbulence in the airflow that caused the loss of control.</p>

    <p>But it's human reason!</p>

    <p>Makino Ling was surprised.</p>

    <p>Originally, the three hours the immortal boat traveled were uneventful.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, in this final time of arrival.</p>

    <p>Suddenly something like this happened...</p>

    <p>Everything is as Jiugong Xiushi and One-Eyed Samurai expected.</p>

    <p>An "air crash" really almost happened!</p>

    <p>"Jiugong Xinghui... this woman is indeed a lunatic!"</p>

    <p>Makino Ling gritted his teeth. He was filled with fear.</p>

    <p>He wanted to use satellite signals on the plane to report to Duyan who was waiting for news at Jiugong's home.</p>

    <p>However, there was a force that blocked the signal from his nano headset.</p>

    <p>Just when I turned on the device, I heard a harsh sound in my ears.</p>

    <p>It's like a cat. It stretches out its claws and scratches the blackboard.</p>

    <p>"How can it be repaired!!"</p>

    <p>Makino Ling angrily took off the headset, which was about the size of a grain of rice, and threw it on the ground.</p>

    <p>Although I don't know why the Dao Immortal boat has stabilized now.</p>

    <p>But Makino Ling still couldn't figure out how the sixth wife planned this plane crash silently...</p>

    <p>Just when he was puzzled, a girl wearing a 60 High School uniform came towards him with a smile on her face.</p>

    <p>No way. No way?</p>

    <p>Have you actually been discovered?</p>

    <p>The moment he saw Sun Rong walking towards him. Makino Ling still thought that he would be fortunate.</p>

    <p>He pretended to be calm and picked up the newspaper.</p>

    <p>At this time, the girl's figure stopped in front of him. She stopped her steps accurately: "You are Mr. Makino Ling, right?"</p>

    <p>"..." Makino Ling shed a cold sweat.</p>

    <p>I can't believe they even know him by name...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong leaned over and said softly: "No need to pretend, Mr. Makino Ling. How about it? Do you want to come to the business class to talk?"</p>

    <p>I would actually be discovered. Or by a student in the Foundation Building period...</p>

    <p>Makino Ling puts down the paper in disbelief. His mind was mixed up. He looked at Sun Rong: "Ms. Sun. When did..."</p>

    <p>"In the beginning." Sun Rong answered truthfully.</p>

    <p>"In the beginning?"</p>

    <p>"Didn't you already keep an eye on us when you were in the lounge?" Sun Rong smiled.</p>

    <p>"This... you discovered it early? Then why didn't you wait until now..."</p>

    <p>"Because you didn't do anything inappropriate. I'm just teasing you."</p>

    <p>"..." The corner of Makino Ling's mouth twitched.</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Rong suddenly looked towards the rear in the direction of the business class cabin.</p>

    <p>After feeling it for a while, she smiled and said, "It seems that Brother Xiaoer has already dealt with the ghost."</p>

    <p>"?"</p>

    <p>At this point, Makino Ling was completely dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High School sent us as exchange students this time. Aren't they all students from the Foundation Building period!?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, in the business class, Wang Ming successfully entered the cockpit.</p>

    <p>Uncover the ghost that caused the immortal boat to almost roll over and cause the plane crash to occur.</p>

    <p>What makes Wang Ming unbelievable is that.</p>

    <p>This turned out to be a lock of hair...</p>

    <p>About a few minutes ago, when he just entered the cab.</p>

    <p>I found that the hair of the pilot and co-pilot was rising forward like a Saiyan.</p>

    <p>It's like being electrocuted. Floating in the air.</p>

    <p>Later, I took a closer look.</p>

    <p>Only then did Wang Ming discover that it was two hairs that had penetrated through the gap, piercing the tops of the two people's heads like tentacles.</p>

    <p>He made a prompt decision and cut off the hair connecting the two pilots' heads. Then he collected it.</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Rong came back with Makino Ling and immediately closed the business class door.</p>

    <p>"This should be a ghost that can move at a distance. It also has a wide range."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said: "It can be manipulated by penetrating hair into the gap and piercing the human brain."</p>

    <p>"The person being manipulated will have his or her hair stand on end and lose consciousness. Just like a puppet on strings."</p>

    <p>"Although I cut off the link, the ghost did not die. Look at the hair quality. It looks like a woman's hair..."</p>

    <p>"It's the hair demon..."</p>

    <p>Makino Ling seems to know something.</p>

    <p>After he was brought in by Sun Rong and heard Wang Ming's description, he immediately thought of such a legendary ghost...</p>

    <p>"It seems that Mr. Makino Ling knows the origin of this ghost?"</p>

    <p>"This is a legendary ghost... and the one the Jiugong family has always wanted to capture."</p>

    <p>Makino Ling pondered: "A few years ago, the Jiugong family organized an exorcism operation against this ghost. However, due to an unexpected incident, the exorcism operation was canceled."</p>

    <p>"After that, there was no movement for several years."</p>

    <p>"The outside world says that the Jiugong family's operation against the "hair demon" failed."</p>

    <p>Oh?</p>

    <p>Wang Ming felt that he had asked some interesting things.</p>

    <p>Immediately he couldn't help but look at Makino Ling with great interest. He continued to ask: "What kind of emergency is it?"</p>

    <p>"It appears to be an attempted burglary..."</p>

    <p>Makino Ling said: "I don't know the specific thing. After I was discharged from the army, I was hired by the eldest son of the Jiugong family, Jiugong Xiushi, as a personal samurai for a few years. The time was not too long."</p>

    <p>Speaking of which, Makino Ling looked a little nervous.</p>

    <p>"This haired demon is no ordinary ghost... it will lose consciousness if invaded. There should be no one in the cockpit now, right?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. The pilot and co-pilot are both asleep."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming smiled and said: "But I have just dealt with it. Now the immortal boat is completely under my control. So there is no need to worry."</p>

    <p>As he spoke, Wang Ming pressed a spot on his arm. A flap was opened on his right arm.</p>

    <p>There is a set of universal remote control equipment inside.</p>

    <p>This was specially prepared by Wang Ming in anticipation of such a situation.</p>

    <p>As long as the smart program of Wang Ling Number 3 is implanted, you can control all devices with electronic functions. You can achieve unimpeded access.</p>

    <p>"Who are you...?"</p>

    <p>Makino Ling was stunned. It was hard to express in words.</p>

    <p>He looked at the young man in front of him who was wearing a mecha. He was fully armed with high-tech features. He looked like he had pretty good combat capabilities.</p>

    <p>However, this person didn't have any spiritual power at all. He was just an ordinary person.</p>

    <p>"These are not things you should know. Mr. Makino Ling."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming chuckled and said: "Shouldn't you explain to us now? Why are you spying on us? And... did you already know that something would happen later?"</p>

    <p>"I was only ordered to protect the safety of the three of you before landing. I don't know anything about other things." Makino Ling frowned and said with a bitter smile.</p>

    <p>"Yes." Wang Ming nodded.</p>

    <p>Every word spoken by Makino Ling can be measured by his heart rate and brain wave fluctuations.</p>

    <p>Judging from the current monitoring results, Makino Ling did not lie.</p>

    <p>"As of now, I have no other way. Because I don't know much. Since you can detect me and know my name, you must know something."</p>

    <p>Makino Ling sighed helplessly: "So. I don't need to lie to you."</p>

    <p>He really felt helpless.</p>

    <p>Who would have thought that during a Nascent Soul period... when a plane crash almost happened just now, a group of people would panic.</p>

    <p>Instead, he himself was saved by these two students who only had the foundation building level.</p>

    <p>However, although the information states that it is the Foundation Building period, judging from the current contact experience.</p>

    <p>Makino Ling felt that the classmate Wang Xiaoer in front of him and the legendary Miss Sun seemed not as simple as they seemed.</p>

    <p>"So what do you know about us?"</p>

    <p>"The information given to me by Jiugong's family shows that you are a student who has been on leave for a long time. Your name is Wang Xiaoer. Foundation Building Period."</p>

    <p>At this time, Makino Ling looked at Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>Then he turned aside Sun Rong: "Miss Sun. I think it goes without saying... Miss Sun's reputation is actually very loud..."</p>

    <p>"So. Where is that person? How much do you know?" Wang Ming pointed at Wang Ling. and asked.</p>

    <p>"Isn't he the mascot mentioned in the information?" Makino Ling said.</p>

    <p>"Yes. It's the mascot." Wang Ming couldn't hold it back and laughed out loud.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After some questioning, Wang Ming found that the information Makino Ling knew was actually not too much.</p>

    <p>Even many things were guessed by him in advance.</p>

    <p>Seeing that the immortal boat would land smoothly soon, Wang Ming planned to end this interrogation game early.</p>

    <p>He brought Makino Ling back to his original seat.</p>

    <p>"This classmate Wang. Who are you... can't you satisfy my curiosity?"</p>

    <p>"Thank you Mr. Makino Ling for your cooperation. There are too many things for me to say. If you are destined, you will know." Wang Ming smiled politely at him.</p>

    <p>Then he pressed the button on his chest.</p>

    <p>Buzz! A bright white flash suddenly lit up from the center of Wang Ming's chest. It then shot to every corner of the immortal cabin.</p>

    <p>The white flash lasted about 5 seconds.</p>

    <p>Except for the three people from Number 60 High School, all the passengers on the immortal boat, including the crew, suddenly felt their minds go blank.</p>

    <p>When everyone regained consciousness, they all felt as if they had been in a daze for a long time.</p>

    <p>"It's all done."</p>

    <p>Returning to business class. Wang Ming sat down again.</p>

    <p>"What did brother Xiaoer just use?"</p>

    <p>"A pulse device that enhances my brainwave radiation. It can cause rapid amnesia. Forget everything that happened in an hour." Wang Ming said.</p>

    <p>"That's awesome!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong sighs. Admiration from the bottom of my heart.</p>

    <p>"It's okay... but this thing can't be used continuously. It will burn your brain if you use it too much."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said with a smile. In fact, his head feels a little feverish now.</p>

    <p>Although he now wears a mecha, many of the devices on the mecha actually need to be used in conjunction with Wang Ming's brainwaves.</p>

    <p>Brainwaves are used too much. Heat dissipation is also a big problem...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong saw Wang Ming's face burning. He quickly applied a {cooling technique} to Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>"What is this? It's so cold..." Wang Ming suddenly felt a lot more comfortable.</p>

    <p>"It's a cooling technique." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"This spell is pretty good. And Miss Rong is very skilled. Is it because she saw my family Ling Ling blushing that she often uses it on herself?"</p>

    <p>"I... I'm not!"</p>

    <p>The girl quickly turned her face away and started to feel hot again.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Arrive successfully at Sun Island Dongfu City International Boatyard.</p>

    <p>After leaving the immortal boat, Wang Ling noticed that the Makino Ling from before was secretly following them all the way.</p>

    <p>Just like a crazy person who walks behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry about him. His mission should have been completed. There is really nothing to ask."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said: "But judging from the conversation just now, the ghost called the Hair Demon that appeared on the immortal boat may be the work of the sixth wife that classmate Jiugong Liangzi said."</p>

    <p>To be honest, Wang Ming was quite surprised.</p>

    <p>It is indeed the famous underworld organization "Zhai Xing Group" based on Sun Island. It even dares to do things like planning an air crash...</p>

    <p>The fatness of this guy is unbelievable.</p>

    <p>"It's a pity. We don't have direct evidence yet." Sun Rong frowned slightly.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry. Just wait and see what happens."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming pillowed his head and walked forward: "It's a fox. It will always show its flaws."</p>

    <p>In fact, it is not difficult to see that Wang Ming. Sun Rong felt a little angry.</p>

    <p>I finally got the opportunity to study abroad as an exchange student with Wang Ling. There were actually some ignorant people interrupting me.</p>

    <p>Zhai Xing Group, right...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong has already written down this name in the "little notebook" in my heart.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at Sun Rong from the corner of his eye. Although there was not much expression on his face.</p>

    <p>But regarding the plane crash that almost happened just now, he actually had some thoughts in his mind.</p>

    <p>Zhai Xing Group is indeed hateful.</p>

    <p>In order to target a few people, he even did not hesitate to drag other innocent people into the funeral.</p>

    <p>Such behavior actually touches the principle of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This time he came to Sun Island. He came with a learning attitude...</p>

    <p>And these people obviously didn't think about what would happen if they disturbed Wang Ling's study.</p>

    <p>The three of them waited at the boat yard for more than half an hour.</p>

    <p>After disguising themselves, Jin Deng and Zhai Yin successfully met them.</p>

    <p>Both of them are wearing casual clothes today.</p>

    <p>Jin Deng no longer wears the thick-looking cassock. Instead, he also changes into the uniform of Number 60 High School. However, the word on the back of the uniform is no longer the word "jing", but the word "dai."</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling was stunned when he saw the special school uniform of the "leading teacher."</p>

    <p>Could this be the legendary "Brother Dai?"</p>

    <p>On the other side, Zhai Yin is wearing a light casual outfit.</p>

    <p>Off-shoulder white short sleeves and an ultra-short denim sports skirt revealed her good figure and slender thighs.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was stunned for a moment.</p>

    <p>If it weren't for the special nature of this job, he would rarely see Zhai Yin dressed like this.</p>

    <p>Normally, Zhai Yin always wears the security uniform.</p>

    <p>If it weren't for the person's beauty.</p>

    <p>In Wang Ming's opinion, the uniform is not much different from that of the old school guard.</p>

    <p>Sure enough. People depend on their clothes...</p>

    <p>Wang Ming sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>He found that he seemed to have seen a side of Zhai Yin that was hard to see on weekdays.</p>

    <p>"Sorry. Long wait."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin was carrying a small suitcase and stepped forward to say hello.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming felt that his head had just been subjected to the Sun Rong Sun Rong head. It suddenly became a little warm again.</p>

    <p>He kept telling himself in his mind that he must stay calm...</p>

    <p>"Did you misuse your brain waves? Why is your face so red?" Zhai Yin stepped forward and asked with concern. She stretched out her hand to take a human body temperature measurement.</p>

    <p>As a result, Wang Ming subconsciously got out of the way.</p>

    <p>"Don't move! Don't move. You'll get what you deserve!" Zhai Yin ordered in a stern voice.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming was yelled at on the spot by this sound. Like a robot that had received instructions, it stopped in place.</p>

    <p>Then Zhai Yin stepped forward. As if afraid that Wang Ming would slip away again, he grabbed Wang Ming's collar with one hand and touched Wang Ming's forehead with the other hand.</p>

    <p>The close touch made Wang Ming's body temperature rise sharply due to embarrassment.</p>

    <p>It's usually just in the laboratory. No one else sees it.</p>

    <p>But it's different now. In this public place, Zhai Yin behaves like his girlfriend...</p>

    <p>It's really too close.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming can even feel Zhai Yin's breath.</p>

    <p>And from this angle. He could also see the two outlines on Zhai Yin's chest.</p>

    <p>"It actually has a hook..."</p>

    <p>Because Zhai Yin usually wears a tight-fitting uniform, Wang Ming completely ignored this.</p>

    <p>After staying there for a few seconds, Zhai Yin released his hand that was measuring the temperature.</p>

    <p>The overall temperature is quite normal. It's not as exaggerated as I thought.</p>

    <p>After all, she had fried steak on Wang Ming's head before. She had experience in temperature control in this area.</p>

    <p>She looked at Wang Ming and breathed a sigh of relief: "It's okay. Everything is normal. You have to pay special attention. Do you understand?"</p>

    <p>"eh..." Wang Ming nodded, like a chicken pecking at rice.</p>

    <p>Seeing this deflated look made Wang Ling feel comfortable in his heart.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, in this world, one thing will bring down another...</p>

    <p>However, at this time, Zhai Yin looked at Wang Ming, still a little puzzled: "But why is your face so red when your temperature is not high?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong realized that he had found an opportunity to counter flirt. Immediately, he couldn't help but smile, "Maybe it's because Second Brother saw a close thing with sister Yinzi, isn't it?"</p>

    <p>Something occurred to Zhai Yin.</p>

    <p>She suddenly realized that when she was taking his temperature, there was something wrong with Wang Ming's eyes. Wang Ming's eyes seemed a little off. He kept glacing down...</p>

    <p>And then her face reddened.</p>

    <p>But at this time, Wang Ling suddenly felt that Sun Rong was a little dangerous.</p>

    <p>Because of his understanding of Wang Ming. He knows Wang Ming's personality very well...</p>

    <p>Dare to tease this guy. The end result is often being "molested" twice.</p>

    <p>Everyone is here. In area B of the Zhouchang underground parking lot, Yingxian Heming, the foreign affairs officer of the Jiugong family, has been waiting for a long time.</p>

    <p>"Hello, Mr. Yingxian Heming. Poor taoistHuo Ding. I am the leading teacher this time."</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng stepped forward and said with a kind smile: "I believe you already know the few classmates standing behind me. And this Miss Yu Jun Dakou is my assistant teacher who is accompanying me. She is not on the list this time. It was my personal request to bring her to support work."</p>

    <p>"so it is."</p>

    <p>Yingxian Heming smiled kindly and said, "It doesn't matter. As long as all the expenses are borne by our Jiugong family."</p>

    <p>"That's very polite. Thank you in advance, poor taoist." Monk Jin Deng</p>

    <p>The name of this fake identity almost made Wang Ming laugh out loud.</p>

    <p>Yukui Okou. Don't they just mean "Zhai" and "Yin" together?</p>

    <p>At this time, Yingxian Heming also frowned.</p>

    <p>Yukui Okou?</p>

    <p>It seems like this surname is rare.</p>

    <p>He immediately asked: "By the way, Ms. Yukui Okou is a native of Sun Island?"</p>

    <p>"My mother is a local and my father is from Huaxiu. I have been living in Huaxiu for a long time. But I am proficient in both languages." Zhai Yin said politely in the local language here.</p>

    <p>"It turns out to be a mixed race!" Yingxian Heming suddenly realized.</p>

    <p>Of course. This experience was all Zhai Yin's fake identity.</p>

    <p>After all, she is here this time. Her main job is to protect Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>This fake identity was made by the authorities. It was perfect. There were no problems.</p>

    <p>And because of his previous experience in the Sheng Immortal Special Forces, Zhai Yin has been sent to perform missions around the world.</p>

    <p>Naturally, he also understands the language of Sun Island.</p>

    <p>With the blessing of fluent native language.</p>

    <p>Yingxian Heming had no doubt about the identity of the "Yukui Okou" lady in front of him.</p>

    <p>"Welcome everyone! You have come all the way. Thank you for your hard work."</p>

    <p>As a gentle and elegant old gentleman, Yingxian Heming stood in front of the prepared car and took the initiative to bow.</p>

    <p>Then, he took the initiative to hold Zhai Yin's hand, leaned over and kissed it.</p>

    <p>In fact, he had no intention of actually getting married.</p>

    <p>This is just a courtesy.</p>

    <p>When the kiss fell, Yingxian Heming kissed the back of his hand.</p>

    <p>As a result, the kiss hadn't ended yet. Wang Ming took the initiative to take a step forward and took Yingxian Heming's hand.</p>

    <p>He didn't know why he did that.</p>

    <p>I just feel a little unbearable...</p>

    <p>Even if it's not a real kiss.</p>

    <p>But when he saw Zhai Yin's hand being held by someone, Wang Ming felt so uncomfortable that it was as if he was overturned.</p>

    <p>So, in Yingxian Heming's shocked eyes, he suddenly kissed the old gentleman on the back of his hand.</p>

    <p>He sneered at Yingxian Heming. The expression on his face was slightly hostile: "Well, the process has been completed. Then just leave for Jiugong's house quickly."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Yingxian Heming was shocked and speechless. He blushed: "This, this, this..."</p>

    <p>He couldn't help but sigh in his heart. Today's boys are too unrestrained.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, am I still getting old...</p>

    <p>If he had taken the initiative back then, maybe his boyfriend wouldn't have run away.</p>

    <p>And now. The boy in front of him actually took the initiative to kiss his hand... Maybe his charm is still there?</p>

    <p>In a short period of time, Yingxian Heming's thoughts drifted away from Wang Ming's kiss.</p>

    <p>But soon. Monk Jin Deng's words brought his thoughts to a halt: "Mr. Yingxian Heming?"</p>

    <p>"Ah. Sorry. I was distracted..."</p>

    <p>"My student is just a bit bad. He doesn't actually like men. Please don't think too much about it."</p>

    <p>"That's right..."</p>

    <p>Yingxian Heming was silent. Then he smiled apologetically: "Sorry, sorry. It's my fault."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The car that Yingxian Heming used to pick up the driver was an RV. The space inside was very spacious.</p>

    <p>But when Wang Ling got in the car, she realized that something was not quite right in the atmosphere.</p>

    <p>It was obviously fine before getting in the car...</p>

    <p>But just after the hand-kissing incident, Sun Rong suddenly realized that Wang Ming seemed a little unhappy.</p>

    <p>Although his face did not look angry, this style of keeping silent was obviously not in line with Wang Ming's personality.</p>

    <p>"Sure enough... Brother Wang Ming is... jealous, right?" At this time, Sun Rong thought in his mind.</p>

    <p>"Miss Rong's guess is absolutely correct." Monk Jin Deng can read minds.</p>

    <p>After he heard Sun Rong's voice, he immediately secretly established a secret spiritual chat window and chatted privately with Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong couldn't help but laugh at that time: "I suddenly realized that Brother Ming seems quite cute..."</p>

    <p>Mainly because this is the way the girl feels she rarely sees a man being jealous.</p>

    <p>"Miss Rong, are you envious?" Monk Jin Deng asked, raising his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>"How can I..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong began to deny it. But soon he faced his own heart: "Okay. It is indeed a little bit."</p>

    <p>Hey. It would be great if, sometime, classmate Wang Ling could also be jealous of her...</p>

    <p>"Haha. There will always be a chance in the future." The monk couldn't help but smile.</p>

    <p>The DNA of Wang's family has always had a special charm that attracts peach blossoms.</p>

    <p>And on top of that. Old Wang's family is also famous for their vinegar.</p>

    <p>And this. Sun Rong will indeed be felt in the future.</p>

    <p>The monk was actually right.</p>

    <p>And he expected it.</p>

    <p>If that time really comes, it will not be far away from attaining the righteous fruition of cultivation...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>I have to say that Wang Ming is really jealous. This sour smell spread all the way...</p>

    <p>Until Yingxian Heming parked the RV in front of Jiugong's house. The strong smell of vinegar in the air seemed to have not dissipated.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming remained silent. But Zhai Yin couldn't bear it anymore.</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry. We have something to deal with between classmate Wang Xiaoer and I. Please wait for us in the car first." Zhai Yin left these words. Then he directly grabbed Wang Ming's wrist and pulled him out.</p>

    <p>As soon as she got off the car, she grabbed Wang Ming and pulled him to a big tree nearby.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming knows. A debate is about to begin.</p>

    <p>To ensure safety, he opened the magnetic shield again.</p>

    <p>So that the words spoken between himself and Zhai Yin will not be heard by strangers.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ming. What do you mean? Who are you showing your face to?" Zhai Yin just stared at Wang Ming. The expression on his face was obviously unhappy.</p>

    <p>"Yeah. I'm keeping a straight face. I also want to ask you. Who are you looking for when you are dressed so flashy?" Wang Ming replied.</p>

    <p>Hearing these words, Zhai Yin raised his hands in anger.</p>

    <p>She wanted to hit Wang Ming, but she couldn't. Finally, she thought about it and put her hand down.</p>

    <p>In fact, after Wang Ming said this, he himself felt a little regretful.</p>

    <p>Girls can dress however they like. It is indeed a girl's freedom.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming knows very well that what he just said is very ambiguous.</p>

    <p>He didn't know how long it had passed. It seemed like seconds, it seemed like minutes. Wang Ming suddenly saw a few tears welling up in the corners of Zhai Yin's eyes.</p>

    <p>In fact, Zhai Yin actually has a lot to say in her heart.</p>

    <p>But when the words came to my lips, I felt like I had nothing to say.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin: "Wang Ming. You are not stupid like your brother... You always know what I am thinking. That's why I don't understand, you know. I don't know what you were angry about just now..."</p>

    <p>"Yinzi..."</p>

    <p>"If you just want to make me angry, then congratulations. Your goal has been achieved."</p>

    <p>"I didn't mean it." Wang Ming opened his mouth.</p>

    <p>He looked at the girl who was about to burst into tears. Suddenly he felt that his soul had been hit hard.</p>

    <p>At this moment, looking at Zhai Yin, his tone was obviously much softer: "You know, this is not what I want to say. I was a little confused just now... especially when I saw the old man grabbing your hand..."</p>

    <p>"So?" Zhai Yin looked at him.</p>

    <p>However, for a long time, under the shade of the tree, Wang Ming still did not answer.</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin felt a little discouraged and was about to turn around and leave. Suddenly Wang Ming reached out and held her arm firmly.</p>

    <p>"Let go..."</p>

    <p>"Yinzi. I have something to tell you."</p>

    <p>"Let go. I don't want to hear it anymore."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin's eyes were red. She was trying to stabilize her emotions.</p>

    <p>"Just one sentence."</p>

    <p>After a long silence, Wang Ming said: "I know. You like me... but I feel that you deserve someone better..."</p>

    <p>These words touched Zhai Yin.</p>

    <p>She turned around and pushed Wang Ming against the tree trunk. She looked at Wang Ming: "So, do you like me?"</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. When Zhai Yin said this, Wang Ming felt that this was the last straw.</p>

    <p>If you don't catch it, you may be drowned in regrets in the future.</p>

    <p>He fixed Zhai Yin's shoulders. He replied, " I love you!"</p>

    <p>Just the next second.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming felt Zhai Yin suddenly leaning towards him.</p>

    <p>Before he could react.</p>

    <p>The girl's softness was already imprinted on his thin lips.</p>

    <p>Yin... Zi...</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Ming's eyes widened.</p>

    <p>In a daze, he suddenly understood.</p>

    <p>In fact, as long as we like each other, that seems to be enough.</p>

    <p>As for probabilities, go to hell!</p>

    <p>The next moment, he turned back and took the initiative to hold Zhai Yin's cheek and retorted.</p>
