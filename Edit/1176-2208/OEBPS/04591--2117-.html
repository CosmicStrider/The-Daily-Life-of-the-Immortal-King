  <h1>Chapter 2117 The intersection of fate</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In terms of opening methods, the choices of Wang Ling and Sun Rong are surprisingly consistent. Although this is inevitably suspected of cheating, both of them have clear minds. Everything they are doing now It's not just to play games. It's to be able to provide a considerable level of support to Mr. Canghu when necessary.</p>

    <p>To put it bluntly, if Wang Ming is the commander behind this wall-breaking incident, then Wang Ling and Sun Rong are the king bombs placed by Wang Ming in the game and ready to be activated at any time. Will cooperate when necessary Mr. Canghu gives a real "wall-breaking blow."</p>

    <p>However, the game world is too huge. The initial tasks cannot be skipped. Even if Wang Ling and Sun Rong enter the game, they can only gradually explore based on the existing tasks. Find the ones that overlap in the world line. opportunity.</p>

    <p>Fuyun Town.</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. Sun Rong always has an intuition. It feels like Wang Ling is by his side.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. On the way to the general's mansion by the jailer, Wang Ling vaguely felt as if someone was calling him.</p>

    <p>It sounded like the voice and shadow of Sun Rong. He was stunned. He immediately released a spiritual signal...</p>

    <p>But soon. Wang Ling came back to his senses.</p>

    <p>He almost forgot. Spiritual perception is useless in the game world.</p>

    <p>Only after meeting each other and adding each other as friends will you know each other's information.</p>

    <p>The game IDs between players will not be displayed to each other. Although there are ten professions in the game, in addition to professions, there is also a setting for obtaining [new identities] through hidden tasks in the in-game comparison.</p>

    <p>The label of the new identity will be ambiguous to a certain extent, making it impossible for players to judge whether this person is an NPC or a real player.</p>

    <p>So after meeting, whether you can tell whether the other party is an NPC or a real player in reality can only be judged from the dialogue and various secret codes.</p>

    <p>This is more friendly to Huaxiu players. In the inner stage alone, there are people who use secret codes to determine each other's identities.</p>

    <p>"Palace Yuye Liquor?"</p>

    <p>"One hundred and eighty cups!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Ask me how it goes?"</p>

    <p>"Listen to me blowing for you!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Do you like this dish?"</p>

    <p>"A great gathering of talents!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>However, this kind of identification method. Wang Ling cannot be shouted out. Although he is not unaware of these jokes, he really doesn't have the courage to shout it out in the game.</p>

    <p>I was already afraid of society...</p>

    <p>Where could one possibly make such a move that can be called a social cow?</p>

    <p>So in this situation, he felt that he could only trust Sun Rong. He felt that Sun Rong could recognize him at a glance.</p>

    <p>Under the leadership of the jailer, Wang Ling successfully arrived at the General's Mansion in Fuyun Town. This is the only building in Fuyun Town that looks relatively stylish. I don't know what the General's Mansion in the big city looks like. But The decoration of the General's Mansion in front of us is beyond the reach of an ordinary small town. In addition, the stone at the door... a dog?</p>

    <p>Eh... more impressive...,</p>

    <p>That's right. It's not the huge stone lion that is placed in front of the noble's door in the TV series. It is two huge stone dogs. The prototype is Er Ha.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly Wang Ling, Er Ha actually has an image implanted in {Itinerant Immortal Child Magic Ring}...</p>

    <p>And the key is that there is not much sense of dissonance.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thinks of Lord Diulei's gifts for straight men. For example, on Wang Ling's birthday. Lord Diulei once proposed to give Wang Ling two huge Er Ha sculptures and a hotel. The one at the door is as big as the one at the door. It can be placed directly in front of the Wang family's small villa to support the house.</p>

    <p>This proposal was directly rejected by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>There's no other reason. It's just that my mother was beaten...</p>

    <p>And this is too high-profile. It is seriously inconsistent with the family tradition and motto that the Old Wang family has always advocated.</p>

    <p>Standing at the door and looking at it for a while. Wang Ling went straight in. In the main hall of the General's Mansion, Wang Ling met the legendary General Chen.</p>

    <p>"Hey, Wu Laotou! You're here!" Hearing the sound of footsteps, General Chen turned around. Wang Ling was stunned immediately.</p>

    <p>Although this "General Chen" looks like he is in his thirties or forties from the outside. He also has a thick black beard. However, no matter how you look at the facial model Wang Ling, you can tell this at a glance. General Chen. It is definitely designed according to Chen Chao's facial features!</p>

    <p>In fact, this is also Chen Chao's own request. He and Guo Hao are also the first inside players of {Itinerant Immortal Ring}. After the inside is completed, all players have the opportunity to become NPCs in the game directly through facial image authorization. Of course, this also requires the consent of the player himself.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao and Guo Hao. These two shameless, shameless guys... it's normal to accept this condition.</p>

    <p>As for being assigned a role like a general, it was probably because of Chen Chao's familiarity with him.</p>

    <p>In essence, Huaxiu is still a small human society.</p>

    <p>"Wu Laotou, sit down quickly!"</p>

    <p>General Chen invited him to sit down and ordered his subordinates to pour tea cups. It can be seen from the game plot that the relationship between this general and this Wu prison leader is extraordinary.</p>

    <p>His face was rosy and he showed a lustful expression. He looked at Wang Ling furtively. He only waited for his subordinates to finish serving tea and leave. Then he said to Wang Ling: "I recently discovered something. An interesting thing. I discovered that there is actually a woman among my guards in Fuyun Town."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised an eyebrow.</p>

    <p>His face remained calm. In fact, he quickly thought of the story of Hua Mulan.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling has not thought about the matter with Sun Rong. After all, the game map is too big. The probability that he and Sun Rong will appear in the same map at the same time is very low. And The probability that the plots can be connected is even lower... In other words, the female guard in this plot is not necessarily Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling didn't think about that at all.</p>

    <p>Seeing General Chen's malicious look, he felt that he had already guessed the next development of the plot.</p>

    <p>"What are you doing?"</p>

    <p>"Hey. Didn't you tell your brother last time that you wanted to get a wife? You didn't get a wife yet, but you just showed up at your door? In the military camp, it is a taboo for a woman to disguise herself as a man and join the fight. This is a serious crime that needs to be punished on the spot. I have already ordered my subordinates to invite people to the house in your name, brother."</p>

    <p>General Chen laughed and said, "Brother, take a look. If you can see it, you can take her away directly. With a stroke of my pen, I will directly erase all her information. No one will notice that there is a problem. But If you don't like her, then this girl is mine."</p>

    <p>As he talked, he finally showed his hidden fangs. He smiled without any scruples: "I have three wives and four concubines in my house. But I have never seen this type of girl. So... this time I called my brother here just to make my words clear. It's not like I haven't thought of you. But if you are picky, then there's really nothing I can do about you."</p>
