  <h1>Chapter 1467 Classmate Jiugong Liangzi Don't be Angry</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Zhuo Yi and Jiugong Liangzi were hiding under the altar table in the Taoist temple.</p>

    <p>"It's so crowded...Who wants to hide in there with you, a liar!"</p>

    <p>He said so. But Jiugong Liangzi still got in obediently.</p>

    <p>The space under the table is relatively small. Zhuo Yi There is no intention to offend the girl. Although he has tried very hard to keep a distance, part of his body is still touching the girl.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi blushed with a disgusted expression. But in this situation, she really couldn't push Zhuo Yi away.</p>

    <p>"Sorry. Classmate Jiugong, please be patient for a while." Zhuo Yi made a shushing gesture and said in a gentle voice.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi snorted. He turned his head slightly and looked at Zhuo Yi with only his peripheral vision.</p>

    <p>She saw Zhuo Yi constantly changing her posture and trying to keep a distance from herself. The emotions in her heart were extremely complicated at the moment.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, she suddenly felt that Zhuo Yi seemed more upright than she imagined.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Zhuo Yi deliberately kept a distance from her. On the contrary, it made her feel unhappy.</p>

    <p>"Isn't this lady's charm enough to make you so disgusted?" Jiugong Liangzi muttered in a low voice and quickly.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Jiugong. What are you talking about?"</p>

    <p>"I won't repeat it a second time."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi's voice was cold.</p>

    <p>The girl calmed herself down and took a deep breath.</p>

    <p>She felt that she must be crazy. She was expecting an old liar like Zhuo Yi to succumb to her charm.</p>

    <p>Such a liar...</p>

    <p>She will never care about it in her life!</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi glared at Zhuo Yi. The hostile look in his eyes made Zhuo Yi feel puzzled: "?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>The little girl now can't figure out what she's thinking!</p>

    <p>It's so difficult to understand!</p>

    <p>It is said that women have so many evil thoughts. But this little girl has not yet become a real woman. How come she has so many evil thoughts?</p>

    <p>Just as he was wondering, the two people under the altar table heard the noise coming from outside the hall at the same time.</p>

    <p>Everything is as expected by Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>It didn't take long for the three people behind to break into the Taoist temple.</p>

    <p>They acted quickly. Once inside, they carefully closed the door and re-bolted it to prevent anyone from entering.</p>

    <p>One of the people took out a three-legged magic weapon and placed it on the ground.</p>

    <p>This is a shielding device that blocks sound and all external signals.</p>

    <p>After manually setting the range, the three-legged instrument made a buzzing sound. A circle of invisible ripples spread out on the spot, covering the entire Taoist temple.</p>

    <p>"The next step is to catch a turtle in an urn."</p>

    <p>The leading man wearing black earrings smiled secretly. He could already feel the auras of Zhuo Yi and Jiugong Liangzi in the main hall of the Taoist temple in front of him.</p>

    <p>The man quickly made two gestures to signal the other two companions to surround the main hall.</p>

    <p>The remaining two people have radars in their hands. This is a device bound to the shielding instrument. Once someone approaches the signal shielding circle, the radar can detect the signal instantly.</p>

    <p>Now it's really hard to fly even with wings.</p>

    <p>The man with black earrings stood gracefully in front of the main hall. He crossed his arms and put on a gesture of good-natured advice: "Miss Liangzi, we don't mean to offend. We are just following orders. As long as Miss Liangzi is willing to hand over the replica in her hand." {Ghost Book}. Then we can consider letting Miss Liangzi go."</p>

    <p>In fact, killing Jiugong Liangzi was their original purpose.</p>

    <p>As for snatching the {Ghost Book}. This is just a matter of convenience.</p>

    <p>The man knew very well that the book in Jiugong Liangzi's hands was just a replica. The real book was still sealed underground in Jiugong's house.</p>

    <p>But the ghosts in these replicas are actually hidden dangers. If they kill Jiugong Liangzi, the ghosts in this replica will witness everything.</p>

    <p>What if this matter was later known to other members of the Jiugong family?</p>

    <p>This is not conducive to their master's subsequent election plans.</p>

    <p>So after they kill Jiugong Liangzi, they need to bring back this "reissue" and wait for the latest disposal order from the owner.</p>

    <p>"{Ghost Book}?"</p>

    <p>Under the altar table. Zhuo Yi looks at Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>{Ghost Book} is related to Jiugong's family secrets. Jiugong Liangzi hesitated to speak. She didn't want to explain.</p>

    <p>But in this case, it seems inappropriate not to explain.</p>

    <p>So the girl frowned and was thinking of a way to briefly summarize it.</p>

    <p>"I guess. This should be a magical weapon used by your family to seal away monsters and control them." At this time, Zhuo Yi guessed.</p>

    <p>"How do you know?" Jiugong Liangzi was surprised.</p>

    <p>"It's just based on experience." Zhuo Yi smiled.</p>

    <p>All this time, Jiugong Liangzi thought he was still the same Zhuo Yi six years ago.</p>

    <p>If it were placed six years ago, the girl would confront him as aggressively as she does now. She doubted that he was not the "savior hero" back then. Zhuo Yi indeed did not have the slightest confidence.</p>

    <p>But now. Everything is different.</p>

    <p>Now Zhuo Yi possesses the special {Thirty-three Little Paths of Vitality} technique.</p>

    <p>Once all true combat power is released, it will rival True Immortal.</p>

    <p>If you add "Yu"...</p>

    <p>Maybe even True Immortal is no match for him.</p>

    <p>In fact, Zhuo Yi's level could have been improved a long time ago.</p>

    <p>As long as he wants to, it is not difficult to quickly advance to Itinerant Immortal.</p>

    <p>But now Zhuo Yi is a public official after all. There are countless eyes staring at him. If the basic level improves too fast, it may make people suspicious...</p>

    <p>Anyway, for Zhuo Yi, the basic level is not important.</p>

    <p>His combat power has exceeded the level of ordinary cultivators on earth.</p>

    <p>On the contrary, the current "basic realm" can give him an excellent cover.</p>

    <p>Just like the three people outside the Taoist temple, I always thought that he only had the combat power of Golden Core.</p>

    <p>At this time. Zhuo Yi is thinking.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi was also trying hard to think about who sent the people outside the Taoist temple.</p>

    <p>She muttered: "It seems like...that person shouldn't be from Xiushi's side."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "Xiushi?"</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi: "Jiugong Xiushi. The only son born to my father's second wife. He is also my second brother."</p>

    <p>"I have an impression. Is it the disabled child mentioned in the news?" Zhuo Yi asked. He had also investigated some information about Jiugong's family beforehand.</p>

    <p>For such a big family, there is always a lot of gossip.</p>

    <p>"Yes. My second brother is disabled. But I always thought it was a cover-up, so I have been monitoring him. But now I am sure that the people outside were not sent by him." Jiugong Liangzi said.</p>

    <p>"Why are you so sure?"</p>

    <p>"I can't tell you this."</p>

    <p>"It seems that you are quite hated in your family." Zhuo Yi couldn't help but smile and said, "Actually, I know even if you don't tell me."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi: "?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "I think your second brother should also have a replica of {Ghost Book}, right? In this case, there is really no need to snatch it."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi: "How did you..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi pointed to his head: "I also rely on my brain to make a living. I am fundamentally different from those women with big breasts and no brains."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi's expression darkened: "What do you mean..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi laughed again: "Jiugong, please don't get excited. You are not."</p>

    <p>Just as he finished speaking, Zhuo Yi could already hear the sound of Jiugong Liangzi gnashing his teeth.</p>

    <p>Then the entire altar table... no! The entire Taoist temple seemed to be shaking slightly...</p>

    <p>"Jiugong, I was just joking. There's no need to be like this..." Zhuo Yi apologized quickly.</p>

    <p>The girl's expression also looked particularly surprised: "No! It's not me..."</p>

    <p>She quickly took out her replica {Ghost Book} from under the cloak.</p>

    <p>I was surprised to find that this amazing abnormal energy fluctuation came from this replica of {Ghost Book}!</p>

    <p>"What...what's going on..." Jiugong Liangzi was so frightened that his face turned pale.</p>

    <p>Such a situation had never occurred before. She was at a loss for a while.</p>

    <p>"danger!"</p>

    <p>Out of an instinctive reaction to the danger, Zhuo Yi immediately grabbed the replica {Ghost Book} and threw it out with great force.</p>

    <p>Outside the Taoist temple, the man with black earrings saw something suspiciously like a {Ghost Book} flying out. He quickly reached out and took it.</p>

    <p>He didn't expect that this young lady would be so straightforward.</p>

    <p>"But even so..." The leading man stroked the Ghost Book in his hand and smiled coldly.</p>

    <p>Even so. Jiugong Liangzi is still going to die.</p>

    <p>However, just as the man was about to attack, the {Ghost Book} in his hand suddenly let out a piercing scream. It was like a witch's roar that made his ears numb.</p>

    <p>The next moment, a thin woman in red clothes appeared in front of him like a ghost.</p>

    <p>With waterfall-like black hair and a mouth smeared with bright red lipstick, there was blood flowing from the corner of the mouth. He looked particularly ferocious.</p>

    <p>Bi Xianzi...</p>

    <p>The man looked at the woman in front of him in astonishment. He recognized it at a glance as the powerful female ghost sealed in the {Ghost Book} by the Jiugong family.</p>

    <p>He instinctively wanted to escape. However, at this moment, the man was shocked to find that his body could not move.</p>

    <p>"No...no!" The man was so frightened that he became incontinent.</p>

    <p>Bi Xianzi approached him step by step. Every time he took a step closer, there were gusts of evil wind on all sides.</p>

    <p>The next moment, the woman's red nails suddenly turned into the tip of a pen. It penetrated directly into the man's body. It was absorbing the man's vitality like a pen absorbing ink...</p>
