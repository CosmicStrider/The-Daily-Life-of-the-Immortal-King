  <h1>Chapter 1390 People who support each other</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The Alluring Sword caught Old God off guard when he was completely defenseless.</p>

    <p>She was almost pulled out of the core world before.</p>

    <p>And the power of the Ten-shot Sword of Allure is unstoppable...</p>

    <p>What's more, this is not just one time.</p>

    <p>Aohai fired ten consecutive rounds of ten rounds. That is, ten rounds and ten rounds!</p>

    <p>Under this attack that sounds like a matryoshka doll, cracks have appeared in the core world of Old God. The whole world is shaking. All the surrounding space walls are shattering.</p>

    <p>Under such a situation, Old God seems to be unable to withstand it.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er put her hands on her hips and said with a proud expression on her face: "So what if you are the Old God? My Rongrong is the woman covered by Ling Zhenren!"</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren?"Old God retrieves memory.</p>

    <p>I found that I did not have this character in my mind.</p>

    <p>It stands to reason that if it is someone Ajuan knows, after Ajuan's soul is swallowed by her, she will also get Ajuan's memory.</p>

    <p>As a result, the name was completely blank in Old God's mind. She seemed to know it, but also seemed not to know it.</p>

    <p>This is the role of the "Great Shielding Technique."</p>

    <p>After all, the Old God has never seen Wang Ling. So it is useless even if he swallows Ajuan's soul and gets the memory.</p>

    <p>If she had known who she was facing and what kind of "player" was standing behind her, she would have known that with the wisdom of Old God, she would never have dared to commit suicide like this.</p>

    <p>So sometimes, people are stupid.</p>

    <p>Not having a clear understanding of one's own abilities is another aspect.</p>

    <p>The hundred-shot Alluring Sword in front of him made Old God feel like he was helpless.</p>

    <p>Her figure kept retreating. Several wounds were cut by the sword energy on her already bald head. Blood slipped from them.</p>

    <p>At this most critical moment, Old God sacrificed another magic weapon of his.</p>

    <p>That is a golden holy shield. Although it is golden, it is made of sacred wood!</p>

    <p>Golden Holy Spirit Shield!</p>

    <p>It is one of Old God's most treasured anti-world magic weapons!</p>

    <p>Moreover, this Holy Spirit Shield was also one of the gifts given to her by Dao Ancestor Wang. A +2-level anti-realm weapon! It comes with 20% of the power of chaos!</p>

    <p>"Boom!"</p>

    <p>A hundred Alluring Swords. When stacked together, they actually emit the aura of the Divine Realm and the Divine Sea!</p>

    <p>The void ahead was flooded by azure blue light. Before he could see clearly, the billowing sword energy was already approaching.</p>

    <p>"Ha! They are all women! Don't think you are the only one who has support! The person standing behind me is Dao Ancestor Wang!" Old God raised the Holy Spirit Shield high. While sacrificing this magic weapon, her confidence seemed to have improved. Quite a few.</p>

    <p>Although Old God lost the initiative and became very passive, the existence of Holy Spirit Shield seems to have given the whole situation a new chapter.</p>

    <p>A buzz!</p>

    <p>A brilliant golden light erupted from the Holy Spirit Shield. It illuminated the eight wastelands and burned the nine heavens. A powerful aura of the great avenue emanated!</p>

    <p>For a time, there were thousands of dharma phenomena in the entire heaven and earth. The phantoms of various living beings appeared.</p>

    <p>Light Elephant, Light Python, Light Lion, Light Leopard, Light Pikachu...</p>

    <p>Each of these living creatures was as big as a mountain. They ran forward and blocked the Old God's sword. They blocked all the hundreds of alluring swords.</p>

    <p>The sword energy emitted by Aohai collided with the golden light emitted by the Holy Spirit Shield and the virtual images of living creatures, causing billowing mist to erupt in the sky. The high-concentration mist covered everything.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong split the fog in front of him in half with a sword. But he saw the Old God holding the Holy Spirit Shield in front with a proud smile.</p>

    <p>"Dao Ancestor Wang's Holy Spirit Shield is here. Can you split this Holy Spirit Shield in half?" Old God smiled. This is a +2 anti-realm weapon. It is integrated with 20% of the power of chaos. Rare in the world!</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that the gift given to her by Dao Ancestor Wang is not just the Holy Spirit Shield.</p>

    <p>Like other magic weapons, she hasn't had a chance to sacrifice them yet. They are also extremely useful.</p>

    <p>But Old God didn't expect that the first time he would use the Holy Spirit Shield since his debut was just to deal with a little girl in the Foundation Building stage.</p>

    <p>In the void. Sun Rong pursed her lips. She did not want to argue with the Old God.</p>

    <p>It makes no sense. It has no results.</p>

    <p>And the Old God in front of her seemed more like a woman who had fallen out of favor.</p>

    <p>Because only when someone falls out of favor can such a strong comparison mentality arise.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong doesn't bother to compare with Old God. Because there is no need.</p>

    <p>But Old God. doesn't think so.</p>

    <p>"I don't care who is supporting you behind your back. No matter how powerful that person is, can he still be stronger than Dao Ancestor? Dao Ancestor was the only one who doted on me back then. He gave me so many treasures!"</p>

    <p>The old god laughed coldly: "I admit that I have underestimated you, it's unprecedented for you, a Foundation Building, to be able to force me to unveil the Shield of the Holy Spirit."</p>

    <p>Facing the aggressive Old God. Sun Rong still maintained the dignified posture of a lady.</p>

    <p>Even though the Old God said provocative words, it never made the girl's expression fluctuate in the slightest.</p>

    <p>Because the girl knows very well... Sun Ying'er will definitely say those words that she doesn't want to say no matter what!</p>

    <p>Who knows she is a lady but Shadow is a good talker...</p>

    <p>Sure enough, Sun Ying'er couldn't bear it anymore. She put her hands on her hips and said to the old god: "You old woman! You old woman! You say that men are not good things, but here you are using the one given to you by Dao Ancestor Wang. It's in vain that Dao Ancestor Wang is infatuated with you. How about you? If you are suspicious of him, in today's terms, you are just like green tea! Do gods also have green tea?"</p>

    <p>God is not supposed to be angry.</p>

    <p>But now, Old God has actually lost his mind.</p>

    <p>There is no comparison between women and women.</p>

    <p>The girl in front of her is clearly only in the Foundation Building stage, but she has gained the combat power to compete with her. This is enough to prove how much effort the people behind the girl have spent on her...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is actually just helping Sun Rong improve its combat power. To be honest, it doesn't take much effort.</p>

    <p>But there's no way. That's what Old God thinks.</p>

    <p>Now, with Dao Ancestor Wang's whereabouts unknown, Old God does have the feeling of an old woman who has fallen out of favor.</p>

    <p>The existence of Sun Rong made her feel jealous.</p>

    <p>And jealousy will also turn into anger towards Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"If you want to kill me, just break the shield of my Holy Spirit before you do it." At this time, in the void, Old God squinted his eyes and whispered.</p>

    <p>She sat cross-legged on a divine cloud, holding up the Shield of the Holy Spirit.</p>

    <p>All kinds of golden creatures poured out from all directions, surrounding her tightly.</p>

    <p>"This Holy Spirit Shield is difficult. The sword energy of a hundred Alluring Swords is blocked. When the strength is insufficient, I want to use quantity instead. This is a good idea. It is a pity that the power of Aohai's sword spirit alone. Even ten The swords are firing in unison. This speed is still not enough!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha was heartbroken to see. Aohai in full energy form. The power of ten consecutive sword attacks was not enough to defeat the Old God.</p>

    <p>It looked at Wang Ying, hinting at Wang Ying to take action.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ying remained motionless.</p>

    <p>Although this is just an Old God. In Wang Ying's opinion, this is a character who can be shot to death with just a flip of his hand.</p>

    <p>There is no need for the Lord to do it himself.</p>

    <p>Even a shadow of him can do it.</p>

    <p>But this is a rare opportunity for training. If he takes action, the battle will be over immediately. It will be detrimental to Sun Rong and Ying'er.</p>

    <p>Both girls lacked combat experience. At the same time, they also lacked the tacit understanding of cooperating with each other.</p>

    <p>So. This is an excellent opportunity for advancement.</p>

    <p>Fight against masters. The improvement in experience is undoubtedly huge.</p>

    <p>Fighting hundreds or thousands of times with cultivators of the same level may not have the same effect as this one.</p>

    <p>It is true. Old God is not a master in the eyes of Wang Ling, Wang Ying...</p>

    <p>"Maybe Miss Sun can think of a way." Wang Ying said.</p>

    <p>When you want to wait for your fighting power, know how to use the tricks at hand to be flexible and get back into the fight.</p>

    <p>This is one of the skill experiences of advanced combat.</p>

    <p>"Ying'er! Your ability to split. Can you split other things?"</p>

    <p>"It can be split! Just add my splitting law! But now my power is restricted by Wang Ying Gorilla!" Sun Ying'er just finished speaking. He suddenly showed a surprised look: "Eh? How can I Suddenly I feel like my power is back..."</p>

    <p>She was filled with surprise.</p>

    <p>Because just after she complained, the power restricted by Wang Ying returned in an instant...</p>

    <p>This made Sun Ying'er feel terrified.</p>

    <p>"Okay! Now you cooperate with me. We will break her shield!"</p>

    <p>External division Aohai!</p>

    <p>This is Sun Rong's battle plan!</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng arranged the split law inside the Sword Spirit space. The main reason is to allow Aohai to gain the ability to charge through the split body!</p>

    <p>And now, the internal charging has been solved with the power bank provided by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Then as long as the external split is completed, Aohai with full energy will continue to split and replicate!</p>

    <p>Then theoretically, a high amount of sword energy output can be achieved in a very short period of time!</p>

    <p>An Aohai can fire ten swords in a row at once.</p>

    <p>Then ten Aohai!</p>

    <p>That's a thousand swords!</p>

    <p>One hundred Aohai. That is ten thousand swords firing together!</p>

    <p>Even if Old God has the shield of the Holy Spirit.</p>

    <p>With the sheer number of thousands of swords fired at once, it would probably be difficult to withstand them!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong frowned. She became more serious. Behind her was the boundless sea. The extremely strong Taiyin finger power surged!</p>

    <p>Under the secret communication between the two women.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er also began to exert strength at this time.</p>

    <p>She slapped the "split rule" on Aohai's stamina.</p>

    <p>For a time, Aohai in countless energy-saturated forms began to split.</p>

    <p>Two from one life, four from two, eight from four... More and more Aohai appear behind Sun Rong like an army!</p>

    <p>"Want to play this trick with me?"</p>

    <p>All I can say is that Old God deserves to be called Old God.</p>

    <p>She immediately noticed Sun Rong's countermeasures.</p>

    <p>She raised her hand and took out a jade whisk.</p>

    <p>This is the "Whistfish of All Realms." It is also a gift given to her by Dao Ancestor Wang. It can condense the dust of heaven and earth, making each particle of dust as heavy as a mountain!</p>

    <p>It is most suitable to limit the division of Aohai in front of us.</p>

    <p>But just as she was about to wave the whisk.</p>

    <p>Countless Sun Ying'ers in front turned into black shadows and attacked her, trying to hinder her actions!</p>

    <p>"Get out of the way!" Old God shouted. He had to wave his whisk to drive away these fragments of Sun Ying'er.</p>

    <p>"As long as I'm here, you can't even think of hindering Rongrong!" Sun Ying'er snorted. The countless split bodies were like missiles attacking Old God from all directions.</p>

    <p>These fragments exploded the moment they approached the Old God. It was a standard suicide attack.</p>

    <p>The Old God had to wave his whisk to drive away these splinters.</p>

    <p>This is a tactic of attacking in the east and attacking in the west.</p>

    <p>By the time Old God reacts, it seems to be too late to prevent Aohai from splitting!</p>

    <p>Aohai's split has become a general trend. It is no longer a situation that she can solve with just a whisk.</p>

    <p>A full thousand Aohai.</p>

    <p>A powerful ocean of immeasurable energy burst out.</p>

    <p>These breaths are superimposed together to form a virtual image of a divine sea whale in the void!</p>

    <p>"The power is so huge that it forms a whale's body..." Er Ha was shocked.</p>

    <p>This is a phenomenon that only occurs when the power of the water spiritual sword is powerful enough!</p>

    <p>The power of the falling whale is a symbol of the sea nurturing and accommodating all things!</p>

    <p>At this moment. Sun Rong is standing in front of thousands of energy-saturated forms of Aohai.</p>

    <p>The huge Divine Sea whale was entrenched at her feet. The whale swung its tail. The tsunami rolled and released terrifying waves.</p>

    <p>At this moment, she was like a heroine. The blue skirt that Ajuan gave her was like a battle armor at this moment. The strong wind roared, the sword energy and the sound of wind interspersed, playing a war song of a heroic woman.</p>

    <p>"Aohai listen!" Sun Rong shouted.</p>

    <p>"Sword Master. I'm here!" Thousands of Aohai responded in unison.</p>

    <p>"Kill!"</p>

    <p>The next moment, the girl pointed to the sky. Then she waved the spiritual sword in her hand.</p>

    <p>Chi!</p>

    <p>She faced Old God. Slash forward!</p>

    <p>Thousands of sword energies are fired together. Cutting forward!</p>

    <p>"Oops!" Old God thought badly.</p>

    <p>These ten thousand sword energies are too powerful!</p>

    <p>She wasn't even close when she rushed towards her. The strong sword wind that could split the space had already distorted her face!</p>

    <p>This sword energy is too strong. It is unprecedented...</p>

    <p>Ten thousand Alluring Swords. The auras were superimposed together. The sword aura had its own armor-piercing effect. It penetrated directly into her Holy Spirit Shield. Not only did it instantly break through the golden light beast around her, but it also made her cough up blood.</p>

    <p>The blood of Old God fell from the corner of his mouth. It mixed with the red clothes on his body, and the color was completely indistinguishable.</p>

    <p>Realizing that something was wrong, Old God decided to run away!</p>

    <p>"To withdraw..."</p>

    <p>There is no doubt that for a god, this is an extremely shameful choice.</p>

    <p>She would actually be beaten up by a Foundation Building and run away.</p>

    <p>But now for Old God, there is no other way.</p>

    <p>She has decided that when she successfully evacuates, she will detonate the entire Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube and blow up all the Heavenly Dao stars!</p>

    <p>This Sun Rong. Can't keep it!</p>

    <p>Even if it costs the entire Heavenly Dao planet, Sun Rong must be completely destroyed.</p>

    <p>However. Just as the Old God was about to abandon the core world and escape.</p>

    <p>A dazzling golden light descended from the sky!</p>

    <p>"What is this?!" Old God was shocked.</p>

    <p>She was covered by this golden light. Her whole body was unable to move!</p>

    <p>"This is Little Master Ling's {Stand Attention and Get Beaten Technique}!" Er Ha identified the origin of this spell. This is a branch of the {Great Immobilization Technique}.</p>

    <p>Those who fall victim to the spell will be frozen in place and unable to move. They will receive the impact head-on!</p>

    <p>"Even if you sent me here, your master still couldn't help but take action. This man is indeed spying on everything." Wang Ying smiled bitterly.</p>

    <p>Everything is over.</p>

    <p>In the sky, Old God was completely imprisoned by the {Stand Attention and Beaten Technique}. He was unable to move.</p>

    <p>She must face it. Accept the impact of Sun Rong's ten thousand sword energy.</p>

    <p>The scene in front of her was like the end of the universe. Thousands of sword energies shattered her core world into pieces. There were holes and storms in space everywhere.</p>

    <p>"I am Dao Ancestor Wang's woman! Do you dare to touch me?"</p>

    <p>Old God looked horrified: "If you kill me, Ajuan will die too!"</p>

    <p>"Don't you understand yet?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Ying'er chuckled: "The man behind my Rongrong. But he can do anything!"</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The sword energy impacted and hit the Old God. Everything there was exploding and falling apart. Then the entire core world began to collapse.</p>

    <p>The chaotic power of the universe seeped in from the gaps and mixed with the sword energy. Everything in the world was wailing.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er's words.</p>

    <p>It was also the last words that Old God heard before he was cut into pieces by ten thousand sword energies...</p>
