  <h1>Chapter 1524 Jiudaohe closed-door match</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In the dormitory building of S District. Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming, Zhai Yin, Sun Rong and Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Four people, facing each other, sitting on the edge of the bed.</p>

    <p>They are discussing Wang Ling's participation in a closed-door meeting.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming frowned and felt uncomfortable. He still felt that this matter was too risky: "No. I still don't agree with you participating in the closed-door match. Even if it is a closed-door match, the current situation is still very dangerous."</p>

    <p>"Just let the classmate Wang Ling do the swimming, right? If you don't participate now, it will look very suspicious. And maybe, you won't be able to complete the task assigned to us by Liangzi..."Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>She also has her own thoughts.</p>

    <p>"I completely understand what Miss Rong means. But now is really not the time."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming sighed: "Talisman's effectiveness naturally weakens over time. It has been almost half a year since I replaced Ling Ling at the last Spirit Sword Exchange Meeting with a new Talisman. Judging from the current strength. Talisman's weakness is obviously much stronger than in the past."</p>

    <p>"Generally, a new Talisman can last for 2-3 years. Now I'm afraid it has to be replaced every year. If you participate in competitions, even behind closed doors like this, it will cause a lot of wear and tear on the Talisman."</p>

    <p>There was obvious helplessness in Wang Ming's tone.</p>

    <p>There is nothing we can do.</p>

    <p>He is also thinking about the whole earth and even the whole universe.</p>

    <p>If the young man in front of him, his dearest brother... loses control completely, the energy erupting from his body may be no less than the Big Bang.</p>

    <p>How could he let this happen?</p>

    <p>"There should be other ways..." Sun Rong's eyes were slightly hopeful.</p>

    <p>"Yes, yes. But..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming is actually not good at lying. Especially when he sees his "brothers and sisters" looking at him like this. He cannot lie to the girl directly.</p>

    <p>"Is there any way you can stop hiding it? I'm so anxious right now." Zhai Yin nudged Wang Ming with her elbow.</p>

    <p>Just a moment.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming felt that his status had plummeted.</p>

    <p>None of them listened to advice!</p>

    <p>He frowned: "Unless... put up another Talisman... Since Talisman's power has weakened now. Put up another one. This is the best way."</p>

    <p>"Then what are you still doing? Hurry up and do it!" Zhai Yin looked at Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>"No, Yinzi... this is Talisman. It's not about laying eggs. You can just lay eggs if you ask. How is this possible?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming couldn't laugh or cry: "I will develop the latest version of the [complete] sealed Talisman myself. It takes a week to make one. The technical content is very high. Ordinary people can't do it at all. And... this method It's risky."</p>

    <p>"What's the risk?"</p>

    <p>"The Talisman on Ling Ling is like a suppressive drug. If you use it too much, you will develop drug resistance. This is why the effectiveness of Talisman is decreasing year by year even after the upgraded version."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said: "The current substances in Talisman that can produce sealing effects are no longer enough for Ling Ling. We must find more powerful substitutes."</p>

    <p>"So the current situation. Before a stronger Talisman is developed, in principle it is better to save what you can. It is safer not to abuse it."</p>

    <p>This is what Wang Ming is most worried about.</p>

    <p>Now. A [Complete Form] seals Talisman. It takes a week to develop.</p>

    <p>In other words, if Wang Ling's resistance reaches the point where he will need to replace a Talisman within a week... by then he may not have time to make it at all.</p>

    <p>Here, Wang Ming is looking confused.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Ling raised his eyes and looked at him very calmly. He said, "Before graduation. Okay."</p>

    <p>This was the promise Wang Ming made when we were at the Jiugong family residence.</p>

    <p>He still remembers.</p>

    <p>This man swore that he would find a perfect solution before graduation.</p>

    <p>"That's what I said..." Wang Ming reached out and dug at his cheek.</p>

    <p>"I always. Believe in you."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling voice transmission.</p>

    <p>A voice that sounded directly in Wang Ming's mind.</p>

    <p>This immediately gave Wang Ming a great encouragement.</p>

    <p>This is a feeling of being trusted.</p>

    <p>As a scientist dedicated to researching new cultivation technology.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming suddenly felt that the moment he was trusted by his younger brother was the proudest moment in his life.</p>

    <p>Immediately, he laughed helplessly: "Okay. I really can't do anything about you..."</p>

    <p>"But is it still too late to do Talisman now? Didn't you say it would take a week?" At this time, Zhai Yin asked a crucial question.</p>

    <p>"It's true that it takes a week to seal Talisman in the [Complete Body]. But if it's the [Incomplete Body], it won't take that long... At this time, it's up to you to do whatever you need."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming made a simple calculation.</p>

    <p>Jiudaohe's closed-door match starts at noon tomorrow.</p>

    <p>Before noon, he could probably make about 100 pictures of incomplete Talisman.</p>

    <p>And 100 of them. It's about a seventh of the full size.</p>

    <p>The key is that it's still fragile...</p>

    <p>Maybe when Wang Ling competes, these incomplete Talisman bodies will be like setting off firecrackers...</p>

    <p>However, the sealing effect is still there.</p>

    <p>It can make Wang Ling's current strength state more stable.</p>

    <p>"There is no other way now. It is better than nothing. Just do your best..." At this time, Wang Ming sighed.</p>

    <p>He stared at Wang Ling. There was a bit of helplessness and love in his eyes.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling chose to participate in the competition this time. This was actually something Wang Ming did not expect.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High School is not a prestigious school.</p>

    <p>However, since joining Number 60 High School, Wang Ming found that Wang Ling's boring temperament was gradually opening up.</p>

    <p>I am no longer as isolated as I used to be.</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling wants to propose to participate.</p>

    <p>What can he, the older brother, do?</p>

    <p>He hopes that Wang Ling can live more freely and happily.</p>

    <p>However, judging from Wang Ling's expression...</p>

    <p>Maybe he himself wouldn't understand why his body was out of control at that time. Should he reach out to accept Jisaki's invitation to the closed-door match?</p>

    <p>Maybe this is a secret desire deep in the heart.</p>

    <p>Prompting an honest response from the body...</p>

    <p>But because of the existence of the sealed Talisman.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has been deprived of the emotions he should have when facing various things since he was a child.</p>

    <p>Here. Just when Wang Ming felt distressed for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He saw the back page of the invitation on the table...</p>

    <p>There is actually a back page?</p>

    <p>Wang Ming raised his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>When he discovered that the rewards for this Jiudaohe closed-door competition included a snack gift pack, and the snack gift pack contained Sun Island limited dry noodles as a reward...</p>

    <p>Wang Ming suddenly felt that he seemed to understand something.</p>

    <p>Really...</p>

    <p>Or is he too naive?</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Thursday, December 17th.</p>

    <p>Before the noon closed-door match at Jiudaohe High School started. Wang Ling was posting incomplete versions of the sealed Talisman created by Wang Ming in the dormitory.</p>

    <p>In order to make it easier to post, Talisman is currently designed like a band-aid. Just tear off the plastic paper and press it directly on your body.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked in the mirror. Looking at the dog skin plaster all over his body, he fell into deep thought.</p>

    <p>Then I put on the Number 60 High School uniform.</p>

    <p>The school uniform is very spacious. It is enough to hide all these Talisman without leaving a trace.</p>

    <p>Oh yes...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Before applying Talisman, he used a technique called hair removal to remove all the hair on his body which was not much.</p>

    <p>Maybe many people have had this experience.</p>

    <p>If you don't want to remove the hair, just tear off the "dog skin plaster" on your body. When the time comes, tear it off along with the hair. It feels so sour and refreshing.</p>

    <p>Therefore, it is actually necessary to use {hair removal}.</p>

    <p>When these 99 "incomplete seals of Talisman" are attached to the body.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling really feels that the sealing effect has been strengthened. I feel that I am now more comfortable when exerting force. I don't have to worry about blowing up these Foundation Building students by blowing lightly.</p>

    <p>When he came to class in the morning, Wang Ling heard Jisaki greet him warmly: "Houlang Sang! Good morning!"</p>

    <p>"eh..."Wang Ling responded gently. Nodding to show politeness.</p>

    <p>"Eh? There's a competition today. Didn't Houlang Sang have a rest last night?" Jisaki frowned.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "?"</p>

    <p>"Because I can obviously feel that the aura on Houlang Sang's body seems to be much weaker than yesterday."</p>

    <p>Speaking of which, Jisaki sighed: "It's my fault. Jisaki sighed: "It's my fault. I should have warned Houlang-san earlier. I should've warned Houlang about this before the game... What's the saying. A young boy cannot know the value of a penis. When you're old and you're no longer a shooter, you'll cry in vain."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "???"</p>

    <p>These words made Wang Ling fall into silence.</p>

    <p>Before he could fully react, he followed Jisaki's rhythm.</p>

    <p>The students in Class S began to show a new round of concern for him.</p>

    <p>"Houlang-san! I heard you didn't rest well last night. Do you need the 66-flavored Dihuang pills to replenish your body?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Houlang Sang. It doesn't actually matter. It doesn't matter if you lose the game. As girls, we just need to cheer quietly together! Oh no. You don't seem to be a girl. But look at how good your skin is. Better than girls!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Do you want a bed, Houlang Sang? I'll move one for you now?"</p>

    <p>"?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling suddenly realized that the wind direction in Class S was getting more and more wrong.</p>

    <p>In the corridor, Jisaki looked at the students in the class communicating enthusiastically with Wang Ling. He couldn't help but nodded with satisfaction.</p>

    <p>He started to notice Wang Ling after Sun Rong had a showdown with him.</p>

    <p>This seemingly ordinary boy is known as the mascot of Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>Beneath the harmless appearance, there is actually something very unusual in Jisaki's eyes.</p>

    <p>Although Sun Rong didn't tell him explicitly, Jisaki actually felt it.</p>

    <p>Whether it was his pioneering work in the cafeteria or his emergence in the first period of Class S... Sun Rong was all for the young man in front of him.</p>

    <p>Houlang Sang...</p>

    <p>What is it about you that deeply attracts Miss Rong?</p>

    <p>With such curiosity, Jisaki began to put aside all his pride and prejudice and understand this.</p>

    <p>And gradually, he really discovered what was different about Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This is a young man who doesn't care about worldly affairs and looks extremely low-key.</p>

    <p>If you use flowers to describe it.</p>

    <p>He felt that Wang Ling was like a begonia flower.</p>

    <p>Simple, generous, beautiful but unassuming...</p>

    <p>Suddenly, Jisaki realized the qualities he had been lacking.</p>

    <p>He felt that he could learn more from Wang Ling to make himself better.</p>

    <p>And with such curiosity.</p>

    <p>Jisaki started to go online to learn more about Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>Until I saw the essay written by Wang Ling at the Jiulong Mountain Physical Arts Conference.</p>

    <p>"A grain of ashes in the times..." Jisaki read the golden sentence in the article.</p>

    <p>In an instant, I was deeply attracted by Wang Ling's talent.</p>

    <p>So, until today, the moment before the game started.</p>

    <p>Jisaki made an important decision!</p>

    <p>He wants to--Join Gray Cult!</p>

    <p>Become Wang Ling's number one fan overseas!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. In the infinite galaxy. In a mysterious celestial body like a black hole.</p>

    <p>It is a new celestial body formed by the power of black rocks swallowing black holes. Peng Xiren calls it "Star Eater."</p>

    <p>At this moment, Peng Xiren is in the Devouring Star. His combat power is suppressed and he is unable to exert his full strength.</p>

    <p>But it can still monitor external things through the power of stars in the universe.</p>

    <p>Every star is like a satellite to Peng Xiren. It can help Peng Xiren remotely transmit a special signal to the earth.</p>

    <p>In order to achieve the purpose of monitoring Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Ever since they were plotted by Wang Ling, causing the Infinite Galaxy seal to explode, Peng Xiren took Fenmu Shen, the owner of the evil eye, to hide here for recuperation.</p>

    <p>The injury has almost fully recovered.</p>

    <p>But now is still not the best time to take action.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren cast his gaze into the distance.</p>

    <p>Akano Sekitora and the Silverskin King were also taken into the Star Eater by him at this time.</p>

    <p>The two of them are in a deep sleep. They are taking medicine to rest and speed up their recovery from their injuries.</p>

    <p>"This level is not as good as when I was in my heyday... the plan of the Sky Tomb needs to be prepared in advance." In the darkness, Fenmu Shen opened his eyes.</p>

    <p>"I know."</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren nodded: "But now is not the best time..."</p>

    <p>The location of the Celestial Tomb. Peng Xiren has taken control of it.</p>

    <p>But based on Peng Xiren's understanding of his master, there must have been many traps in the tomb that day.</p>

    <p>Without sufficient assurance, they would never set foot there.</p>

    <p>The reason why Fenmu Shen is called Fenmu Shen is because Dao Ancestor Wang was so surprised by its power that he split Fenmu Shen into two halves.</p>

    <p>Half of them are in the sealed area.</p>

    <p>And the other half is in the sky tomb.</p>

    <p>Now Fenmu Shen has not yet integrated the other half of the power in the Sky Tomb. He already has 90% of the combat power of his heyday.</p>

    <p>If they are all integrated, its combat power can be imagined.</p>

    <p>By that time, even Wang Ling... may not be able to stop it, right?</p>

    <p>While Peng Xiren was thinking deeply.</p>

    <p>At this time, his eyebrows suddenly moved: "No... how could..."</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen: "Eh? What's going on?"</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren laughed loudly: "It won't be wrong! It won't be wrong!!! I always said before that the time is not enough! But just now, I found that the time has come!"</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen: "What the hell is going on?"</p>

    <p>"In this world, there really is no one who can always remain strong."</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren sneered and said: "Although I don't know what happened specifically. But now I find... that Wang Ling's aura has dropped a lot! Maybe he is in some period of weakness? I think. We The opportunity has come to take action..."</p>
