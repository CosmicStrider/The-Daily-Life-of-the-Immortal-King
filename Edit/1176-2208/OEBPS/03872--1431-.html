  <h1>Chapter 1431 Monk vs. Peng Xiren</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Peng Xiren is still alive. This does not surprise the monk.</p>

    <p>After all, it is as he said. He is the only disciple of Dao Ancestor Wang...</p>

    <p>Whether in the world of cultivation or elsewhere, it seems that as long as powerful people with certain abilities like to play this "suspended death game", they are afraid that others will not know that they are big bosses.</p>

    <p>The monk sighed silently.</p>

    <p>As for faking his own death...actually, he has done it before.</p>

    <p>Usually, a powerful person fakes his death. On the one hand, it is to dig out the inner ghosts around him and see clearly the attitude of the people around him towards this matter.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, it is to avoid death and so on.</p>

    <p>But none of the above situations were the monk's original intention.</p>

    <p>The monk faked his death back then, just to get some skin.</p>

    <p>He used his experience in one of his lifetimes to experience it. After discovering that he had faked his own death.</p>

    <p>Those who denigrate, those who mourn, those who commemorate...all kinds of ghosts and ghosts will surface after suspended animation.</p>

    <p>This process is quite torturous, but the pleasure lies in the feeling when the faked death is revealed and reappears in front of everyone.</p>

    <p>The young man in front of him, surrounded by stars, seemed to enjoy the feeling of surprise when others saw him.</p>

    <p>"So, the purpose of your fake death is to devote more energy to the infinite galaxy and search for Dao Ancestor's celestial tomb..." the monk guessed.</p>

    <p>"I already know where the Sky Tomb is. Now there is only the last step left. I will take the sealed people with me." Peng Xiren has made all the plans. It seems that he has a chance to win.</p>

    <p>"It seems that there is only one battle left..." The monk closed his eyes.</p>

    <p>"Remember, when you saw me, I was Dao God. But now, it's different." Peng Xiren smiled confidently, as if he had a chance to win.</p>

    <p>"I know. You have entered the ancestral realm. If you were Dao God, even a poor monk would not even bother to take a look." The monk also smiled.</p>

    <p>Now his strength has returned to its prime. Even stronger than before...</p>

    <p>"Me too." Peng Xiren said: "We haven't seen each other for many years. Bald Donkey, you have become stronger. I was no match for you before. I want to see if I am still weaker than you now."</p>

    <p>"There are mountains beyond the mountains. There is still a certain distance between you and your master." The monk said.</p>

    <p>The true realm of Dao Ancestor Wang. It is not just Dao Ancestor.</p>

    <p>He is the first person to enter the ancestral realm.</p>

    <p>Hence the title Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>And now. Dao Ancestor Wang is definitely more powerful.</p>

    <p>"Even if there is a distance, it's not too far. I feel like I've caught up with Master."</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren finished.</p>

    <p>"Boom!"</p>

    <p>His body's starlight surged, causing stage waves. There was a strong wave surging.</p>

    <p>At the same moment, the blood in his body continued to surge. A star dragon made of diamonds emerged from Peng Xiren's body. It kept struggling. Then a dragon roar erupted with a roar.</p>

    <p>When this star dragon appeared, it directly scattered the surrounding starry sky. The energy fluctuations were too powerful!</p>

    <p>The monk saw that the situation was not good. Almost at the moment when Peng Xiren called out to Star Dragon, he took Peng Xiren to transfer space and moved the battlefield to the outer galaxy.</p>

    <p>"There's no point in moving the battlefield. I'll kill you. Rubik's Cube on Earth. I'm bound to win." Peng Xiren opened his eyes.</p>

    <p>At this time, the star dragon behind him quickly penetrated into his body, and finally turned into an imprint of surging starlight on his chest, arms and forehead.</p>

    <p>"This is..." The monk stared at him with deep eyes, wanting to see Peng Xiren thoroughly.</p>

    <p>Every inch of Peng Xiren's body, which was as white as snow, could be seen shining brightly. The stars were lingering, exuding an immortal power.</p>

    <p>After jumping into the realm of Dao Ancestor, Peng Xiren's realm is indeed different from before. The sense of oppression brought by it is too strong. It is more powerful than all the family heads in the God's Domain combined!</p>

    <p>"Not only have you entered the realm of Dao Ancestor. You have also practiced Dao Ancestor's set of {All Realms Stardust Technique} to the eighth level of perfection..." Such a change really surprised the monk. Because when he first met Peng Xiren. The young man has just practiced this technique. He has not even reached the second level.</p>

    <p>But now, he has cultivated to the state of Dzogchen.</p>

    <p>The eighth level of Dzogchen. Also known as: The Immortal Diamond.</p>

    <p>As long as the power of starlight continues, Peng Xiren will have an endless supply of energy. Even if he is injured, he can be quickly repaired by the surrounding starlight.</p>

    <p>"Bald Ass. As you can see. Now I am. The Immortal Son of the Stars..."</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren whispered. His eyes were cold. His whole body was glowing. The roar of the star dragon in his body rumbled.</p>

    <p>{All Worlds Stardust Kung Fu} is the first Kung Fu under Dao Ancestor. In the context of the battlefield in the universe, he is equal to invincible!</p>

    <p>"I'll let you know what it means to be invincible...kill!"</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren's hair was shining with starlight. It was hanging down. His eyes were frightening. Without any modification, he punched the monk's smooth forehead with a straight punch.</p>

    <p>The small fist condenses countless starlight around it!</p>

    <p>This is Peng Xiren condensing the power of the stars. He has refined all the bones in his body into the Supreme Star Bone. It can absorb the power of the surrounding starlight to increase bone density and greatly enhance his own strength.</p>

    <p>This punch seems inconspicuous. Without any modification, it is still shockingly powerful. It is not a problem at all to kill the head of the family in the divine domain...</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng held his breath. Facing this punch, he fell into trance and did not dodge or dodge.</p>

    <p>He took it with his own physical strength. During the collision, the final punch seemed to hit a piece of hard iron. There was a buzzing sound, and a harsh high-frequency vibration of metal collision erupted.</p>

    <p>The monk knew very well that Peng Xiren did not use all his strength in this attack.</p>

    <p>I probably only used about 30% of my strength...</p>

    <p>"Cough." At this moment, blood oozed from the corner of the monk's mouth.</p>

    <p>Although he seemed to be fine, the punch had already caused some internal injuries to him.</p>

    <p>"Bald Donkey. You are too confident. You actually resisted with your own body. You didn't even leave any means of defense. Are you looking down on me?" Peng Xiren said.</p>

    <p>At the same time, I was sighing in my heart.</p>

    <p>An average opponent wouldn't be able to withstand even 10% of his strength.</p>

    <p>30% of the power. The soul is flying away is just the basic operation.</p>

    <p>There are only a handful of people in this world who can withstand his punch.</p>

    <p>"You are injured internally. You bald donkey." Peng Xiren couldn't help but laugh. The monk's confidence ultimately harmed himself.</p>

    <p>However, just when he was feeling proud, he saw three groups of gorgeous Buddha fires blooming suddenly on the monk's Tianling Cap.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren's expression changed instantly: "The three most holy fires of Buddhism...you actually have an epiphany!?"</p>

    <p>He could tell at a glance that these three groups of Buddha fire were exactly: past Buddha fire, present Buddha fire and future Buddha fire...</p>

    <p>I know a lot about Peng Xiren, the sage of Buddhism. But it is extremely rare to be able to realize three Buddha Fires at the same time!</p>

    <p>He is worthy of being his lifelong enemy!</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren's expression became excited.</p>

    <p>Now, his master has entered reincarnation and cannot control him for the time being.</p>

    <p>Just kill the monk in front of you...</p>

    <p>In this universe, no one can limit him anymore.</p>

    <p>After all, in this universe surrounded by stars.</p>

    <p>His eighth layer of immortal diamond is invincible!</p>
