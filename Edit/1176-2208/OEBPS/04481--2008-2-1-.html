  <h1>Chapter 2008 2 in 1. Immortal King's Chess Game</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This time, it was not Mingyue Ye's illusion. His scepter stirred inside Dai Tianchun's body, like a juicer turning the inside into a mess.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the ruby on the wand is also emitting a heart-stopping red light, extracting all the spiritual energy from this body bit by bit.</p>

    <p>This is a wand that can strengthen itself by absorbing the body of a strong person. It is also a serious chaos weapon. Mingyue Ye's own strength is actually not that strong. It is only the strength of Venerated Immortal.</p>

    <p>However, the magic wand in his hand is the key factor that greatly increases his combat power. It is precisely because of the blessing of this magic wand that his illusions have extraordinary strength compared to other cultivators on the earth.</p>

    <p>Even the legendary God of Death, who has met many great illusionists, was kept in the dark.</p>

    <p>"What is Crazy Dai? That's all..." After draining the last bit of Dai Tianchun's spiritual energy, he looked at the legendary god of death that had shriveled into a piece of skin. A sly smile appeared on Mingyue Ye's face. However, he could clearly feel his body was not satisfied yet.</p>

    <p>He also needs to absorb the spiritual energy of more powerful people to quickly expand his own realm, so as to better assist the growing young master of the wilderness.</p>

    <p>Although the young master is just a baby now, as a loyal servant, Mingyue Yi has secretly resolved to make Honghuang become one of the most powerful organizations on Earth before the young master grows up when he accompanies the young master of Honghuang to establish them on the Earth...</p>

    <p>After doing all this, Mingyue Ye didn't even clean up the scene. Instead, he directly picked up Qu Shuling, who had fainted on his side. He used his wand to draw a portal on the spot and disappeared without a trace.</p>

    <p>As soon as Mingyue Ye left, a young man and a monk wearing white Hanfu also landed quickly with a golden light.</p>

    <p>Looking at Dai Tianchun's tragic situation in front of them, the two of them looked at each other and frowned.</p>

    <p>"He was badly injured, almost all of his spiritual energy was sucked away, but his three souls and six spirits were still there." Crispy Noodles Dao Lord squatted down and just put his hand on the remains of the human skin. and made a judgment.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Dai has suffered a lot." Monk Jin Deng sighed and said, "But after all, he lives up to the name of the God of Killing..."</p>

    <p>After all, he was a strong man back then. A man who had experienced countless bloody battles all year round. Such a man's willpower was astonishing even when he was on the verge of death.</p>

    <p>Under normal circumstances, Dai Tianchun would have been in a dead state at this moment. His brain and internal organs were all smashed into pieces.</p>

    <p>However, for high-level cultivators, as long as the soul can be retained, there is still hope of resurrection.</p>

    <p>"Ling the master is like a god. He had already predicted that Mr. Dai would be in this kind of disaster." Crispy Noodles Dao Lord didn't talk nonsense. A flash of inspiration came out from his hand. He directly used the "Great Healing Technique" to help Dai Tianchun recover this broken body.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Monk Jin Deng also sacrificed the Buddha's fire from the past to stabilize Dai Tianchun's soul: "Before you came to join the poor monk, I already knew that this was Ling Zhenren's idea. The one who attacked Mr. Dai. He seems very confident."</p>

    <p>"Well. Theoretically, Dai Tianchun is dead."</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Lord said: "So after we rescue him, we have to take him away."</p>

    <p>"So, you want to hide him and then announce his death to the outside world?" Monk Jin Deng said.</p>

    <p>"Not entirely. If you directly announce the death, it will make the person who did it suspicious. It should be more ambiguous."</p>

    <p>"I understand, poor monk." The monk nodded: "For example, we can say to the outside world that Mr. Dai is practicing in seclusion. During the period of seclusion and practice, the principal affairs of Shengke will be replaced by someone else. In this case, the person who did it will not be troubled. He will feel more at ease. Will think this is a movement blockade implemented by Huaxiu Alliance because they are worried about the turmoil caused by the exposure of this matter."</p>

    <p>"That's right."</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Lord nodded: "And monk. You should be able to see it. Dai Tianchun's talent."</p>

    <p>"Mr. Dai's talent is extraordinary compared to ordinary cultivators on earth.</p>

    <p>If it were not for being bound by the {International True Immortal Convention}, he would have been able to cultivate to a height that frightens the world." Monk Jin Deng said with emotion: "And now, the upgrade of the earth is completed. The {International True Immortal Convention} has also been dismissed. It's a pity that Mr. Dai is old and has missed the best age for cultivation."</p>

    <p>"So now we have to look for these talents who have rich experience on the battlefield, and we must do our best to protect them. Dai Tianchun is the person who is chosen by the Lord. He will be useful on the future battlefield."</p>

    <p>"It turns out that Ling Zhenren wanted to train him..." At this moment, Monk Jin Deng completely understood.</p>

    <p>Although Dai Tianchun has missed the best age for cultivation, as long as Wang Ling intervenes, everything will not be a problem.</p>

    <p>The treatment for the two of them took less than two minutes. Dai Tianchun has returned to his original appearance.</p>

    <p>But he was still in a coma. He had no idea what happened.</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng reacted quickly and took the unconscious Dai Tianchun directly into the "Buddha Golden Lotus" and took him away.</p>

    <p>"The person who did this is named Mingyue Ye. He has a chaos device in his hand. It can absorb the spiritual energy of powerful people and use it for his own use. He should be committing crimes frequently in the near future."</p>

    <p>"I understand, poor monk. This person specializes in picking strong people to attack. To a certain extent, it saves us the time of selecting talents and making final preparations for the war."</p>

    <p>"That's right."</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Lord stood up, put his hands behind his back, and sighed silently: "It's hard work, monk, you have been working overtime with me recently. And we rescue people. We must do it quickly. Because after all, not everyone is like Dai Tianchun. Having amazing willpower."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, Zhuo Yi drove the Office of Strategic Deception's exclusive bus and gradually approached the secret entrance to the Mountain of Recall, their final holy land of cultivation.</p>

    <p>At the entrance is a man-made forest created by the Office of Strategic Deception. There are real spiritual beasts living in it. Chen Chao and Guo Hao thought this was the training ground. As soon as they got off the bus, they all showed excited expressions.</p>

    <p>They didn't notice at all that just before getting off the bus, Wang Ling closed his eyes tightly. In fact, he was using his mental power to remotely command Crispy Noodles Dao Lord, the real clone he sent to rescue Dai Tianchun.</p>

    <p>After learning that Dai Tianchun was successfully rescued, Wang Ling opened his eyes with relief.</p>

    <p>Everything was as he suspected. Sure enough, someone had begun to infiltrate the earth. And that group of people was sent by Bai Zhe.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling is certain that it is not just Bai Zhe and his group. There must be other alien forces trying to infiltrate the earth.</p>

    <p>It's just that Mingyue Ye's methods are obviously more powerful.</p>

    <p>After all, he relies on people behind him. But the current leader of the Dragon Clan is Fenmu Shen, who inherited the Heavenly Dao tradition.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling just sent Crispy Noodles and the monk to save people. It didn't mean to directly kill the prehistoric man.</p>

    <p>There is a saying that one mountain cannot accommodate two tigers.</p>

    <p>If Mingyue Ye wants to develop the prehistoric world, relying on his own strength to win over the alien forces who have the same purpose and are trying to infiltrate the earth. This is the fastest and most convenient way.</p>

    <p>It is impossible to raise tigers to cause trouble.</p>

    <p>That moonlit night. Wang Ling didn't take it seriously at all.</p>

    <p>He's just a pawn used to gather those suspicious alien forces and then catch them all...</p>

    <p>Fortunately, the work of Crispy Noodles and Monk is progressing smoothly. And the investigation of extraterrestrial meteorites by Lord Diulei is also improving. With these strong and capable friends helping together, this makes Wang Ling He is even more confident about controlling the future battle situation.</p>

    <p>He got out of the car with his hands inside his pockets. He pretended to have a calm expression. He always looked like he had not woken up. In Chen Chao's words, his sleepy look seemed to be the kind of tiredness that saved the galaxy in his previous life.</p>

    <p>If anyone who knows the true strength of Wang Ling hears this, they will definitely complain.</p>

    <p>This pattern is still too small after all...</p>

    <p>This is not saving the galaxy. It is basically saving the universe.</p>

    <p>In order not to disturb the spiritual beasts living in the forest, the last section of the road leading to the Mountain of Recall needs to go through the forest.</p>

    <p>This natural forest was artificially created by the Office of Strategic Deception. It is still not fully open. The main purpose of its original design was to hide the secret entrance to the Mountain of Recall.</p>

    <p>Therefore, no one with a rank below the rank of Great Elder is eligible to enter the forest.</p>

    <p>Therefore, this forest of the Office of Strategic Deception is also called the "Mysterious Forbidden Forest" by the disciples of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>In the eyes of most Office of Strategic Deception disciples, the appearance of this mysterious forbidden forest is very strange. It seems as if it grew overnight and appeared directly in the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>In fact, that is just the means of Zhenyuan Immortal. After all, Zhenyuan Immortal has been creating a second planet suitable for human cultivators to live in. Although he is also attending Number 60 High School, he does not only complete his homework after school every day In addition, he also continue to play the real version of Minecraft on Drought Star very carefully.</p>

    <p>He is already very familiar with how to create a planet with natural ecology. Creating a forest is not a big deal for Zhenyuan Immortal.</p>

    <p>You can create easily by using the "Enhanced Version of the Star Movement Array" and the "All Things Growth Method" in the "Natural Technique" in Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>However, in the eyes of regular earth cultivators, this is an incredible operation that is unimaginable.</p>

    <p>Therefore, there are many legends about this "mysterious forbidden forest." Generally, they are only spread among the disciples of the sect...</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling, Zhuo Yi, and Sun Rong all discovered that they still underestimated a certain talent's gossip ability.</p>

    <p>All they can say is that Guo Hao deserves to be called the PHS of Number 60 High School. He is also known as the intelligence leader.</p>

    <p>"An uncle of mine is a disciple in the Office of Strategic Deception. I remember hearing him talk about this forest before." Just as everyone was walking through the forest path, Guo Hao suddenly said.</p>

    <p>"You have so many uncles, Mr. Guo."</p>

    <p>Fang Xing, who had been silent all this time, couldn't help it. He showed an awkward but polite smile: "But since your uncle is a disciple at the Office of Strategic Deception, why don't he invite you to the Office of Strategic Deception?"</p>

    <p>"Hey. He is just an outer sect. The outer sect disciples have the strictest management. How can he bring his family members in at will?"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao spread his hands. Then he completely ignored Fang Xing's deliberate interruption and continued, "I heard from my uncle and some disciples of the Office of Strategic Deception that this forest grew overnight... and with this Forest area. Using current cultivation spells combined with formations, it will take at least a week."</p>

    <p>"Are you suspecting that there is a hidden master in the Office of Strategic Deception? Or?" Chen Chao asked with a huge sword on his back and touched his chin.</p>

    <p>"That's wrong, Chao'er. You are too small. I think the purpose of building this forest is probably Lord Diulei's operation to hide his master." Guo Hao said with his hands on his hips.</p>

    <p>"Lord Diulei's... master?" Sun Rong, Jiugong Liangzi and the two girls almost choked when they heard this.</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling, Zhuo Yi trembled. Silently.</p>

    <p>"As we all know, Lord Diulei is now the first person on earth to enter the realm of True Venerated Immortal! And this is before the earth has completed its upgrade. The {International Cultivation Convention} is still there. He has no master and no expert. Guidance. How is it possible?"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao made a reasonable and sound analysis and said: "And you think about it. Lord Diulei was given the nickname Death Seeking Senior. He committed suicide in order to pursue his own justice. He offended many evil people in the past, but he still lived tenaciously... If it weren't for the master protecting you from behind, Zhenjun would be in danger!"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Chen Chao nodded repeatedly: "I think it makes sense!"</p>

    <p>The rest of the crowd: "..."</p>

    <p>However, Guo Hao has not yet finished his words: "Of course the most critical point is that Lord Diulei established the Office of Strategic Deception. No sect can develop on such a scale in such a short period of time. It directly jumped to become the number one super sect in the world! So I dare to say that Lord Diulei must have a master! And this master must be the strongest cultivator on the earth right now!"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "In other words, Guo, you think that the head of the Office of Strategic Deception is not Lord Diulei, but his master?"</p>

    <p>"No. What I mean is that there must be big bosses hiding behind the scenes in the Office of Strategic Deception. And Lord Diulei is just on the surface."</p>

    <p>When Guo Hao said this, he scratched his head and said with a smile: "Of course. These are some conclusions I drew based on the rumors shared by my uncle. Just for everyone's enjoyment."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi laughed loudly: "The two juniors have really rich ideas. It would be a pity not to write a book..."</p>

    <p>The rest of the crowd: "..."</p>

    <p>After walking for several kilometers, a slightly open area ahead once again attracted everyone's attention.</p>

    <p>"Oh my God! Why is there such a big gold-plated statue here!" Chen Chao and Guo Hao hurriedly ran over.</p>

    <p>They stared at the statue. Their minds became more certain about the ideas discussed during the previous journey.</p>

    <p>"Sure enough! This mysterious forbidden forest of the Office of Strategic Deception was built by Lord Diulei! He actually didn't build his own statue. Instead, he put someone else's statue here..." Guo Hao said excitedly: "I even I think this forbidden forest is very likely to be the retreat place of Lord Diulei's master, the legendary strongest cultivator on earth!"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "But it's a bit strange, Guo. Why aren't the facial features of this strongest cultivator sculpted?"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "What do you know? This is the strongest cultivator on earth. How can the appearance of a super powerful person be seen clearly by ordinary people?"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao haha: "That's right! I just thought that this face was erased on purpose."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Looking at Guo Hao's excited face, Zhuo Yi slapped his forehead suddenly.</p>

    <p>At the same time, everyone else here was also dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>Because most of them can see that the outline of this statue is actually carved from Wang Ling's appearance...</p>

    <p>"What's going on? Senior Zhuo Yi!" Sun Rong couldn't bear it any longer. She secretly asked Zhuo Yi via voice transmission.</p>

    <p>"Zhenyuan said that this was an Easter egg he deliberately left when he was building the forest to express his admiration for the master. Originally, even the facial features were carved out. In the end, it was me who polished the facial features."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
