  <h1>Chapter 1545 Ohno-san. Will you join the church?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Purple Maple Club student branch meeting room.</p>

    <p>Ohno Dankaede rubbed his eyebrows and sat on the sofa with a painful look on his face.</p>

    <p>He is one of the members of Jiudaohe High School's Rainbow Seven Sons Gang Zifeng Club. He is also the vice president.</p>

    <p>In the Purple Maple Club, all gang members must have the word "Maple" or a homophony of "Maple" in their names.</p>

    <p>This kind of unwritten rule for High School students is said to have been established by the first gang president. Because it is quite unique... it has been continued ever since.</p>

    <p>"You just let him in like this?"</p>

    <p>The current president, Moriyama Kaede, looked at him in disbelief and said, "Have you never failed before?"</p>

    <p>"There is no one who doesn't get his shoes wet when walking along the river."</p>

    <p>Ohno Dankaede also had a headache. He sighed.</p>

    <p>There are mountains beyond the mountains. This time Ohno Dankaede really saw it.</p>

    <p>He thought his skills at dice and poker were superb.</p>

    <p>But I didn't expect that this time I would actually hit the iron plate...</p>

    <p>Even until now, he still doesn't understand how Wang Ling did such a magical thing.</p>

    <p>That's more than just an iron plate...</p>

    <p>What he met was simply an immortal god!</p>

    <p>Cheating!</p>

    <p>"How can we fix it..." Ohno Dankaede couldn't help but sigh.</p>

    <p>After deciding on the final candidates for the five-member delegation, these three words were the words he repeated the most.</p>

    <p>But tell the truth.</p>

    <p>This time he was completely convinced by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Even if Wang Ling did not confront him head-on.</p>

    <p>But "throwing dice" is such an immortal technique.</p>

    <p>Ohno Dankaede thinks he is so big. He has never seen...</p>

    <p>If it weren't for his relationship with the gang, he would have wanted to become a disciple on the spot!</p>

    <p>Assess the situation. Stop when you see a good outcome.</p>

    <p>This is something Ohno Dankaede's family instilled in him from childhood.</p>

    <p>Although their family runs a casino, Ohno Dankaede also grew up watching various casinos. He learned a lot of tricks and unique skills... and was also obsessed with studying various scammers and techniques for detecting scammers.</p>

    <p>But in fact, Ohno Dankaede has never really bet money with anyone.</p>

    <p>Mainly because of the pressure at home.</p>

    <p>Ohno Dankaede's father started his career in this field, but he didn't want his son to be exposed to this kind of thing.</p>

    <p>That's why Ohno Dankaede was forced to practice Sword.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, Ohno Dankaede is also very talented in Sword.</p>

    <p>It's just that Ohno Dankaede felt that his parents didn't really understand what he wanted.</p>

    <p>After thinking for a long time, Ohno Dankaede frowned and said, "I think it would be better if we don't move about this person."</p>

    <p>"Why did this idea suddenly come to you?"</p>

    <p>Moriyama Kaede smiled: "You've always wanted to run the family business. But your uncle and aunt didn't allow it? You've fought all over the world and finally met a master. Shouldn't it inspire your will to completely defeat him?"</p>

    <p>"Some people... can't be defeated."</p>

    <p>Ohno Dankaede said.</p>

    <p>He said it very seriously. Especially after he determined in his heart that Wang Ling was an "immortal god." This thought became even more unwavering.</p>

    <p>That Houlang Sang who came all the way from Number 60 High School in Huaxiu... is really strong!</p>

    <p>"You are just like my parents. In fact, you have no idea what I want." Ohno Dankaede sighed and looked at Moriyama Kaede.</p>

    <p>In fact, when Ohno Dankaede said running a family business, he did not mean directly inheriting the casino.</p>

    <p>Rather, he wants to rely on the abilities he has learned so far to change this industry...to transform his own company into a good organization such as a "Gambling Abuse Center."</p>

    <p>This is what Ohno Dankaede has always wanted to do.</p>

    <p>"Are you going to stop thinking about it?" Moriyama Kaede asked, seeing Ohno Dankaede's determined look on his face.</p>

    <p>"I will no longer get involved in this matter."</p>

    <p>Ohno Dankaede stand up. Seriously.</p>

    <p>"That's fine."</p>

    <p>Moriyama Kaede shook his head. He smiled bitterly: "We had heard the news before that "the one who wins Houlang wins the world." We wanted to win over this Houlang Sang. Unfortunately...this Houlang Sang didn't appreciate it at all. That's why we, the Rainbow Seven Gang, planned to join forces. Embarrass him. Even if you don't want to help, there are still people who are willing to do it."</p>

    <p>"I advise you to be careful too."</p>

    <p>Ohno Dankaede said: "The people in the student union may already be fans of Houlang Sang. And the Sun Rong lady from Houlang Sang has always taken good care of him..."</p>

    <p>"So what?"</p>

    <p>Moriyama Kaede laughed: "I've looked up this Houlang Sang's information. Born in a mediocre, modest family... Ma Jiao is destined to be Ma Jiao... he can't succeed."</p>

    <p>Ohno Dankaede was silent for a moment. He responded coldly: "Then it's up to you..."</p>

    <p>Then he turned around and left quickly.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After walking out of the conference room, the cold wind blew on Ohno Dankaede's cheeks.</p>

    <p>Time: Friday, December 18. 3:15 am.</p>

    <p>Go home now. The road is a bit far. Ohno Dankaede was upset. He didn't want to go back. So he took a path toward the student apartment in District S.</p>

    <p>It was as if someone had calculated that he would appear here.</p>

    <p>He had just taken a few steps along the trail when he was blocked by a familiar figure.</p>

    <p>"Ohno Dankaede, I have been waiting for you for a long time." Jisaki saw Ohno Dankaede with surprise in his eyes.</p>

    <p>He didn't expect that Wang Ming's prediction for him was completely accurate!</p>

    <p>You can actually cut off Ohno Dankaede on this trail...</p>

    <p>Brother Xiaoer's calculation is so accurate!</p>

    <p>Great!</p>

    <p>"President? How did you..."</p>

    <p>Ohno Dankaede obviously didn't expect that Jisaki would be waiting here at this time.</p>

    <p>And it was as if he had expected him to come.</p>

    <p>"Don't ask me where I'm from."</p>

    <p>Jisaki looked at him. The golden hair glistened in the moonlight as if it had been coated in hair wax: "I know. Moriyama Kaede's gang came to you, didn't they? Are the Rainbow Seven planning to do the same? Is the Rainbow Seven planning something against Houlang Sang?"</p>

    <p>Ohno Dankaede did not respond. It was the default.</p>

    <p>"And from the look of you, you don't seem to be planning to continue participating, right?"</p>

    <p>Jisaki looked at Ohno Dankaede and said with a smile: "This is a very smart choice."</p>

    <p>"Whether I participate or not seems to have nothing to do with the president." Ohno Dankaede responded coldly.</p>

    <p>Just getting ready to leave.</p>

    <p>Just listen to Jisaki say again: "They don't understand you. I understand you. The skills you are learning now are actually learned because you want to change the family's business method."</p>

    <p>These words made Ohno Dankaede pause on the spot.</p>

    <p>He turned around in disbelief and looked at Jisaki.</p>

    <p>You must know that even his parents don't understand this matter...</p>

    <p>"I know Ohno-san. And I also know how to help you." Jisaki said.</p>

    <p>Of course he knows.</p>

    <p>Because now everything said to Ohno Dankaede.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming calculated everything remotely through his own mental deduction technique.</p>

    <p>What Jisaki needs to do is just make good use of his status as the student council president.</p>

    <p>"You actually want to ask Houlang Sang for advice, right? But you are too embarrassed to ask."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Obviously, Jisaki's words touched Ohno Dankaede's mind again.</p>

    <p>"I want to ask Houlang Sang. Actually there is a very convenient way." At this time, Jisaki said.</p>

    <p>"What way?" Ohno Dan Kaede was obviously interested.</p>

    <p>"Join the Church."</p>

    <p>"Join the church?"</p>

    <p>"Yes! Join the religion!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Have you ever heard of a sect that exchanges literature in Huaxiu country? Gray Cult! In fact, this is the fan support club of Houlang Sang!"</p>

    <p>Jisaki smiled and looked at the boy in front of him: "So, Ohno-kun, do you want to join the church?"</p>
