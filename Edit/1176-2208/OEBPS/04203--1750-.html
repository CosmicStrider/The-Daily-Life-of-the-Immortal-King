  <h1>Chapter 1750 Rescue Jiang Yingying</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At this moment, Jiang Yingying is still in a state of confusion. She has no idea about the cause and effect of the incident. She can only make a basic judgment on the whole thing from the current conversation with Yin Hu.</p>

    <p>First of all, she must have been captured by mistake, which is absolutely right, the gang's initial target is Sun Rong herself... And it seems that the purpose of capturing Sun Rong is also to confirm certain intelligence, by recording video evidence to blackmail Sun Rong in this way.</p>

    <p>But the current information is a huge scandal that Jiang Yingying was shocked to hear.</p>

    <p>Having a baby out of wedlock. And after giving birth to a baby, she also used methods such as inducing birth... Either of these two things would be scary enough.</p>

    <p>Rationally speaking, Jiang Yingying didn't think Sun Rong would do such a thing. As her opponent all along, combined with all aspects of Sun Rong's character, Jiang Yingying immediately I feel that this matter is not reliable. It is mostly based on rumors and unconfirmed misunderstandings.</p>

    <p>And now, these people have captured her.</p>

    <p>If she really used the trick to impersonate Sun Rong and help Sun Rong record such a video...even if this matter can be clarified in the end, it will plunge the Huaguo Shuilian Group into a huge public opinion storm.</p>

    <p>In today's Internet environment, sometimes fake news appears about a certain incident that may cause public outrage. The truth of the incident is often not the focus of public attention. More people are just used to venting their emotions through this window. It is very rare for people to remain rational in such a public opinion environment.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying doesn't like Sun Rong. And has always regarded Sun Rong as a good competitor.</p>

    <p>And the current choice is actually a good opportunity for her to overthrow a competitor. Even if she can't overthrow her, at least she can make the opponent feel disgusted for a while.</p>

    <p>But no matter how much she hates Sun Rong. Jiang Yingying, she won't do that.</p>

    <p>Because this is the wrong thing.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the first person Jiang Yingying thought of was her grandfather.</p>

    <p>Martial Saint Jiang educated her and did not allow her to do such obscene things.</p>

    <p>She was worried that she would be embarrassed by her grandfather who loved her very much.</p>

    <p>At the same time, I also hope that I can have a real and fair opportunity with Sun Rong to compete Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying doesn't know if she will regret this decision in the future.</p>

    <p>But now. She has made up her mind.</p>

    <p>"Miss Sun, tell the truth and it will be beneficial to everyone." Yin Hu curled his lips and smiled.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying suppressed the fear in her heart and tried to calm her uncontrollable trembling. She was covered with a blindfold and could not see the appearance of the Yin Hu clearly. But she followed the Yin Hu's voice and looked in the direction of the Yin Hu: "I don't care who you are. You want me to tell you? Dream on, you guys! Hawk Tuah!"</p>

    <p>A mouthful of saliva just spit on the Yin Hu's face.</p>

    <p>Yin Hu was shaking with anger. With a snap, he immediately slapped Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>"Boss... you can't hit her... otherwise it will be seen in the video..." Daishu next to him held his forehead, feeling helpless.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry. I'm keeping my hand. Nothing will happen. I'll touch up her makeup later before recording the video. Cover the red marks on this bitch's face."</p>

    <p>Yin Huhehe. As he said that, he pinched Jiang Yingying's chin and said, "Ms. Sun, since you're so uncooperative, don't blame us for not doing everything right... all of our brothers don't have a daughter-in-law. You can guess, if you locked up to comfort them, and then shoot a video. You as a big lady of the family, such a video on the black market, you can guess how many curious viewers there will be?"</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying stopped talking. She just lowered her head. At the same time, she was praying that someone would find out that she had been kidnapped soon.</p>

    <p>She knew it was better not to anger this group of people right now. Otherwise, she would really be in danger...</p>

    <p>But at this moment, with the extremely helpless emotions intertwined and fluctuating in her heart, Jiang Yingying also made some surprising discoveries.</p>

    <p>Even at this time, she was looking forward to the first person who could come to save her.</p>

    <p>The face that comes to mind is neither Wang Ling. nor Jiang Xiaoche...</p>

    <p>Her mind.</p>

    <p>It's blank....</p>

    <p>On the other side, Jiang Yingying was taken away by a group of people pretending to be doctors. Almost half an hour after Yin Hu left, Martial Saint Jiang noticed it.</p>

    <p>Because he and his granddaughter no longer live together, Marshal Jiang took over the house opposite Jiang Yingying for safety reasons and installed what looked like a peephole on the door. It was actually a remote monitoring device.</p>

    <p>That night, Martial Saint Jiang originally called for surveillance to see if Jiang Yingying had gone home. As a result, he happened to take a picture of the Yin Hu using gold-eating insects to break into the door.</p>

    <p>Just a few minutes later, the Office of Strategic Deception received a co-investigation notice from the Huaxiu Alliance. The Office of Strategic Deception was required to immediately organize manpower to thoroughly investigate the capture of Jiang Yingying in a short period of time.</p>

    <p>In video conference.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei personally came out to appease Martial Saint Jiang.</p>

    <p>It can be seen that the face of this veteran general is full of haggard and vicissitudes of life.</p>

    <p>"Zhenjun. I only have one granddaughter..."</p>

    <p>"Uncle Jiang, don't worry. We are all highly cooperating with the investigation regarding Ms. Jiang Yingying's case. I believe there will be results soon. Ms. Jiang is a lucky person. She will be fine."</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei comforted him. Just as he finished speaking, a document was suddenly handed over from the blind spot on the side.</p>

    <p>After a quick read, Lord Diulei showed a surprised expression on his face: "There is already news from Uncle Jiang. Now I switch the video to the new research team leader in my Office of Strategic Deception, Mr. Shou Chong."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong?</p>

    <p>That unreliable internet celebrity scientist?</p>

    <p>Martial Saint Jiang looked forward to it. After transferring the video, the picture in the video turned out to be a lotus pond...</p>

    <p>"This is..."</p>

    <p>"Oh, by the way. I forgot to tell Uncle Jiang. Because Teacher Shou Chong's body was destroyed by the villain in the previous mission. So now the Office of Strategic Deception has reshaped him into a new immortal lotus body. But the body is still being cultivated. At present Teacher Shou Chong can only be kept in a pond. He relies on nerve conduits to transmit information."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Martial Saint Jiang was stunned for a moment. Then he said anxiously: "So. Do you have any clues now?"</p>

    <p>In the video, Shou Chong's voice came from the tablet computer next to the lotus pond: "This is Mr. Jiang. Although this group of people cannot be retrieved at all in the police's background information database, they are completely invisible people. But in the terminal device, I found out that someone tracked Ms. Jiang's location through the facial recognition system I sold before."</p>

    <p>"Your facial recognition system?"</p>

    <p>"This is the extra money I made from a technology company before. But because I was worried that the system would be used by criminals, I still left a backdoor. Their usage records. I can find them here."</p>

    <p>Shou Chong said: "The person they should want to capture is girl Sun Rong. They found Miss Jiang. My skills should not make such a mistake."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Lord Diulei and Martial Saint Jiang fell silent at the same time.</p>

    <p>This man really has no idea about his inventions...</p>
