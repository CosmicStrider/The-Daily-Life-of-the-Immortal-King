  <h1>Chapter 1753 The bustling Duobao City</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi feels that this time the Duobao City operation seems to be very lively...all forces are secretly gathering together. This is by no means a common thing.</p>

    <p>"What should we do next?" She had a vague premonition.</p>

    <p>This is purely a woman's sixth sense.</p>

    <p>"He's still just a child after all. It's too difficult to restrain him." Zhuo Yi shrugged helplessly. He held the steering wheel. In fact, he was a little at a loss inside.</p>

    <p>It doesn't matter if he is asked to take the blame. It is his duty as a disciple to take the blame of his master. But if Wang Muyu is seen by everyone, he will not be able to take the blame...</p>

    <p>Because even if he went out of his way and admitted that Wang Muyu was his child, no one would believe it when they saw that Muyu had the same face as his master.</p>

    <p>It's hard to say that it was born between him and Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, holding the pass prepared by Zhuo Yi, Sun Rong successfully entered the underground intelligence trading market in Duobao City.</p>

    <p>I have to say that the scale of this place is quite astonishing. Wandering intelligence dealers wearing masks and trying to sell information can be seen everywhere.</p>

    <p>There are also stalls for public sale. This is a planned market. Information dealers hide their hands in their long sleeves and wait for customers to arrive in the square retro-style stalls.</p>

    <p>On the table is a tube that only contains information. According to the value of the information, these tubes can be divided into bamboo tubes, iron tubes, jade tubes and gold tubes.</p>

    <p>The tubes are also distributed based on the intelligence value after appraisal by a specialized neutral intelligence agency in Duobao City. Intelligence vendors cannot make their own decisions.</p>

    <p>Follow the normal transaction process. After payment is completed, the information in the corresponding tubes can be obtained. Finally, the tubes will be handed over to the recycling area at the exit. There will be a dedicated person responsible for recycling these tubes.</p>

    <p>It's just that the information purchased through stalls or wandering dealers is equivalent to a kind of information gold mining. The information you get may not be what you want.</p>

    <p>However, the total transaction volume successfully sold through these vendors every year is still tens of billions, and continues to increase year by year.</p>

    <p>This is enough to prove how scary people's desire for gossip is.</p>

    <p>"Today's discount on jade tubes. Buy two and get one free. You can choose any information. Today's information contains gossip about female celebrities. The online author will update the information..."</p>

    <p>"This booth contains the latest secret realm news in the world of cultivation. If you draw a friend who has secret realm news, I can recommend a big guy to lead the team. It is safe and risk-free. Cultivation will get twice the result with half the effort."</p>

    <p>"The information on this booth contains the home address of the author Ku Xuan. Friends who can draw this information will also receive 88 black iron blades and express delivery service. Your satisfaction is guaranteed."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When passing by these stalls, Sun Rong heard a variety of hawking and shouting sounds from many nearby information dealers.</p>

    <p>Pricing on a per-tub basis in the intelligence trading market is nothing new. If you want to purchase specified intelligence, you still have to go to a larger organization that is specifically responsible for this type of intelligence.</p>

    <p>For example, take the Roaring Heaven Alliance headed by Tengu.</p>

    <p>It's just that you need to pay a more expensive price.</p>

    <p>Move forward all the way. Sun Rong At the same time, use the passive ability of Aohai's sword to amplify the spiritual consciousness until it spreads to the entire underground intelligence field.</p>

    <p>--Found it!</p>

    <p>In just a few breaths, Sun Rong immediately locked the specific location of Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>It's just that Jiang Yingying's position seems a bit strange.</p>

    <p>At the entrance of an underground residential area, an old mulberry tree came into view. The residential area here is specially designed for these information vendors to stay. Almost all the houses are rented by people who run this business.</p>

    <p>Intelligence is a shady business. People who work in this business often use multiple false identities to hide their identities. Naturally, it is impossible to reveal their true address in real life.</p>

    <p>Therefore, this underground residential area provides a good cover, allowing these intelligence traffickers to conduct their transactions unimpeded.</p>

    <p>In the Office of Strategic Deception, the people who have the most say in intelligence are the duo of the former Immortal Castle's Lord and Lady.</p>

    <p>The two people's intelligence trading network in Songhai City is huge.</p>

    <p>Before being incorporated by the Office of Strategic Deception, it once had its own place in the underground intelligence trading market. If it weren't for the fact that it has now officially joined the ranks of the regular army, the Roaring Sky Alliance has lost a strong opponent. The Tengu group would not be possible. It rose rapidly in just half a year.</p>

    <p>"Strange. Classmate Jiang's aura is obviously here." Sun Rong frowned under the old mulberry tree. According to her spiritual sense, Jiang Yingying's aura is here in this mulberry tree. The positions are almost coincident.</p>

    <p>"Not necessarily Rongrong. It's possible that there is a universe inside." As the Lord of the Void, Sun Ying'er's sensitivity to space and experience judgment are stronger than Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"Ying'er, what you mean is that classmate Jiang is locked up in a layered space?"</p>

    <p>"This underground intelligence city is crowded with people. It would definitely not be safe if it were locked directly in our current main space. So, some layered methods are probably used in it." Sun Ying'er analyzed.</p>

    <p>To explain the spatial layering technique using the simplest principle, it is similar to the layering effect of PS software. After setting up a main spatial layer, you can make multiple spatial layers underneath, so as to hide the people, things, and objects you want to hide.</p>

    <p>To put it in plain English, this is the same method as some boys like to create multiple folders and then hide indescribable video files. And the method of naming that folder "Study Materials" is exactly the same.</p>

    <p>The design of many cultivation spells originally came from life. It is not difficult for people who have mastered the relevant spells to cast this spell.</p>

    <p>The reason why Tengu hid Jiang Yingying like this is because this kind of space layering technique is absolutely safe.</p>

    <p>It is impossible for non-powerful people to detect it so easily.</p>

    <p>But even so, today there is no way to escape the testing of the Nine Core Aohai.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, in the Number 3 layered space of the underground intelligence city, Yin Hu and others were still conducting video evidence collection on Jiang Yingying in the independent interrogation room here.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Jiang. I hope you can cooperate." Yin Hu frowned. He had changed his mind and knew that he had indeed captured the wrong person.</p>

    <p>However, at the moment, the least they can do to fix the mistake is to let Jiang Yingying pretend to be Sun Rong to record the video.</p>

    <p>Because of the capture of Jiang Yingying, the Tengu people judged that the Huaguo Shuilian Group must be on guard. They want to capture Sun Rong again. I'm afraid it won't be that easy.</p>

    <p>Originally, Yin Hu thought that letting Jiang Yingying pretend to be Sun Rong to record a fake video would be much smoother, because these two people didn't deal with each other very well.</p>

    <p>But he never expected that Jiang Yingying would be much tougher than he thought.</p>

    <p>He asked for a long time. Facing the prepared camera, Jiang Yingying gritted her teeth and refused to say another word.</p>

    <p>"Don't be disrespectful." Yin Hu was annoyed. He pinched Jiang Yingying's chin and said, "This layered space was created by a powerful senior. Even if your grandfather really comes, he won't be able to find it here."</p>

    <p>Yin Hu said with a snort.</p>

    <p>He really didn't take Martial Saint Jiang seriously.</p>

    <p>As we all know, all ten generals are in the True Immortal realm.</p>

    <p>But since the upgrade of the earth, the current highest level of cultivators on earth has opened up restrictions...</p>

    <p>True Immortal realms are rare.</p>

    <p>But in the eyes of the Yin Hu gang, who have stronger people in the background, they are just a few cabbages.</p>
