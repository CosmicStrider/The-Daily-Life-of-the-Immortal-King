  <h1>Chapter 1818 Creating the Eternal Utopia</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The situation is worse than the lion-headed man imagined. Just a few breaths ago he was complaining about why this idiot skeleton prince of the undead was here to fish in the name of breaking the shield.</p>

    <p>As a result, he also fished it now...</p>

    <p>There is no way. The main reason is that Wang Ling is too strong. It completely controls the inner universe of King's Eyes. It has an unparalleled power. His Lion King Overlord Spear! The fourth level of the clan's chaos magic weapon. It was completely destroyed by this young man with one finger.</p>

    <p>What a terrifying hard power this was. It made the lion-headed man feel numb for a moment. So he had to settle for the next best thing. He took the same approach as the Skeleton Prince of the Undead.</p>

    <p>Otherwise...</p>

    <p>Life is not guaranteed.</p>

    <p>Moreover, both of them were particularly worried about what to do if the shield was broken by them in the end. So they tacitly let go of each other. They seemed to be working very hard to break the shield. In fact, you are paddling carefully.</p>

    <p>"What to do..."</p>

    <p>At this time, the two Eternals trapped in the inner universe of King's Eyes are both thinking about the same question.</p>

    <p>I don't even remember what my original mission was.</p>

    <p>The Holy Lord sent by the Holy King asked them to find the master hidden in Number 60 High School. Then bring his soul back. And the body is to plant a magic weapon like "parasitic seed." Leave it to the parasitic seed to take control of his body.</p>

    <p>Both of them were full of confidence before they were sent here. They felt that they were fully capable of the task this time.</p>

    <p>After all, one of them is the prince of the undead tribe, and the other is the current leader of the lion tribe.</p>

    <p>Although there are no other members of the two clans, they all inherited the blood of the royal family.</p>

    <p>With this layer of bloodline power added to him, their strength on paper is much stronger than most of the Eternals.</p>

    <p>It can instantly kill most of the Eternals who have turned into skeletons in the Supreme Corpse Map.</p>

    <p>Naturally, dealing with the Blood Lotus Female Butcher who defeated Haiyao Jushi was no problem.</p>

    <p>However, although their idea was good, it was difficult to implement it.</p>

    <p>Just like the product departments of some companies. They always come up with some unrealistic ideas and ridiculous operations. Programmers often lose their hair when performing tasks.</p>

    <p>For example, there are some authors with the surname Ku who are clamoring for more updates all day long. Before coding, they confidently said that they would destroy the world. However, when it came to coding, they were submissively fucked by the world...</p>

    <p>Facts have proved that there is always a difference between ideas and practice.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling actually didn't expect that two eternal beings of royal blood would be so afraid of him.</p>

    <p>But how to say it.</p>

    <p>Can scratch his school uniform.</p>

    <p>Praise is still needed.</p>

    <p>From the beginning Wang Ling had no intention of killing these two people.</p>

    <p>After all, they are descendants of the royal family. Moreover, they are all Eternals. They already know as much as Li Xian and Zhang Zhui.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Wang Ling's initial purpose was to capture the two of them alive like Pokemon, and then imprison them in the Corpse Map for domestication.</p>

    <p>The Eternal One. As the oldest line of human cultivation civilization. Since Dao Ancestor Wang originally intended to protect and preserve it, he must have his own reasons.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling believes unswervingly. Regarding the creation of Talisman who can limit the energy in his body once and for all. In the end, he must start from these eternal ones.</p>

    <p>Looking at the two members of the royal family in front of him, the thought in Wang Ling's heart was to create a Utopia of the Eternals within the Supreme Corpse Map.</p>

    <p>Let the Eternal Ones gradually adapt to modern cultivation civilization under certain constraints in the world of the Supreme Corpse Map, and eventually turn these Eternal Ones into their own strength to prepare for emergencies.</p>

    <p>This idea is like creating a game world. Wang Ling can serve as the main god of this game world. Let these eternal beings build their own homes, establish sects, and revive the glory of their clans in the past. Finally, The benefits are then distributed according to each Eternal's contribution to the world.</p>

    <p>Anyway, the things piled in King's Pants are inexhaustible. Any magic weapon taken out is enough to make this group of ancients fight for their heads.</p>

    <p>Therefore, under the premise that the system is clear, the benefits will be distributed according to the degree of contribution. In this way, no one will have any objections.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling also knows that he has such an idea. It is not easy to implement it.</p>

    <p>The first step is to establish a management team with him as the core that is trustworthy and has prestige among the Eternal Ones.</p>

    <p>Li Xian and Zhang Zhui are his confidants, so they are naturally the first candidates.</p>

    <p>But it is difficult to achieve deterrence by just relying on the strength of two people.</p>

    <p>Therefore, we need royal family members like the Skeleton Prince and the Lion-headed Man in front of us to play supporting roles.</p>

    <p>However, the legacy of just two royal families seems to be a bit scarce...</p>

    <p>Therefore, he only needs to dig out all the Eternal Ones from the Holy King.</p>

    <p>After two rounds of duels, Wang Ling discovered that the Holy King seemed to have a hobby of collecting royal heritage. The two Eternals in succession were both members of the royal heritage...</p>

    <p>So who is the third person who comes next?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is very curious.</p>

    <p>Following the previous routine, Wang Ling temporarily unlocked the time-stop effect.</p>

    <p>Through the screen on the monitor, Mrs. Lawen saw Wang Ling still burying his face in his knees. She almost went crazy...</p>

    <p>"Why is this person still squatting inside and acting cute!!"</p>

    <p>"Why wasn't there be any response when she pressed the remote control?"</p>

    <p>"Damn it...this button can't be fake, right? Did you promise to send strong people to support you? Why didn't you get any reaction at all?"</p>

    <p>"Is there anyone who can take care of this guy?"</p>

    <p>Although there is only one last chance to press the button.</p>

    <p>But her fingers couldn't help but move wildly.</p>

    <p>In a very short period of time, she clicked "click, click, click, click" countless times...</p>

    <p>Then, the time-stop effect is activated again.</p>

    <p>Because Wang Ling can sense that the third Eternal One has arrived. And it is exactly what he thought. They have the blood of the royal family.</p>

    <p>Unexpected by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The third Eternal One is a female Eternal One. She is wearing a gorgeous glazed robe. Like a mysterious goddess falling from the sky, she appears in front of Wang Ling with countless seven-color petals..</p>

    <p>"It turned out to be Meng Liuli..." The undead skeleton prince and the lion-headed man were shocked at the same time when they saw the woman appearing.</p>

    <p>They never expected that Meng Liuli, the famous dream controller among the Eternal Ones, would actually be under the command of that Holy King and work for the Holy King.</p>

    <p>What is completely different from the Skeleton Prince and the Lion-headed Man is that after realizing that she was sucked into the inner space of King's Eyes, the woman named Meng Liuli was not in a hurry to take action.</p>

    <p>Instead, she looked at Wang Ling and said: "You are willing to put so many shields on the girl outside. Come to think of it, that girl is a very important person to you. Whether you want to recognize it or not..."</p>

    <p>She looked at Wang Ling. Then her face changed into Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"The shield is ineffective against me." Meng Liuli smiled and said: "Now, I am her, and she is me. If you hit me, all the injuries and pain will be concentrated on that girl..."</p>
