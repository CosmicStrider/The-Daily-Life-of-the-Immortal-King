  <h1>Chapter 1814 Wang Ling fights the undead</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The undead say they are immortal, but in fact they are not. Their longevity is naturally strong and they can survive for a long time without any training.</p>

    <p>Previously Wang Ling took Sun Rong to the Immortal Star. The Immortal Star is actually a split piece of the Undead Star where the undead survive.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has very little information known about the undead. He only heard that the death of the undead was due to the disaster caused by their immortality. In order to allow themselves to live longer, the alien gods forcibly captured these snow-white skeletons as a food. In an attempt to decompose the natural genes of the undead to increase your survival time in the world.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the undead are theoretically eaten.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at the snow-white skeleton wearing a black cloak in front of him. The King's Eyes were flowing with red light. This was a fully developed undead. It was much more powerful than the average Eternal. Even in many cases the eyes of those of eternity, it is simply unbelievably strong.</p>

    <p>But more undead did not survive this age and were dissolved in the stomachs of other races.</p>

    <p>Sometimes it can be troublesome if the growth cycle is too long, because during the growth process, you will be targeted by evil people at any time and become someone else's food.</p>

    <p>"I have never seen an Earthling like you." Maybe he didn't expect that Wang Ling was the hidden Eternal One that the Holy King behind him had been looking for. The snow-white skeleton was staring at Wang Ling, after looking at it for a long time, he spoke slowly.</p>

    <p>In fact, he was repeatedly exploring the true identity of Wang Ling in his own way. As a result, when he found out that the young man in front of him was really just a standard earthling, he was astonished that he would not notice anything for thousands of years. The feeling suddenly caused ripples to appear in the calm lake in his heart.</p>

    <p>Not just an Earthling. But a terrifying Earthling.</p>

    <p>The characteristics of the undead, in addition to their naturally extremely long lifespan, are also those deeply sunken skull eye sockets. Even if there are no pupils that can use pupil skills, these pair of eye sockets seem to be involved in the eternal stars, but they still have the ability to see through everything.</p>

    <p>If a normal cultivator looks at him for a long time, he will definitely be trapped in the world of his eye sockets and pupils, unable to extricate himself. There will be an illusion that his soul has taken off and been drawn into the universe.</p>

    <p>And when that time comes, it will be time for the undead to harvest.</p>

    <p>However, at this moment, Wang Ling was standing in front of him, looking at him with those red eyes that he could not see through.</p>

    <p>The young man's eyes seemed ordinary and nothing strange at first glance. However, after observing the undead skeleton prince for a while, he suddenly felt his body lighten.</p>

    <p>Immediately afterwards, the surrounding space was no longer in the secret room. Instead, it was drawn into a vast sea of stars.</p>

    <p>"Am I being bitten back?"</p>

    <p>The Skeleton Prince has never seen such a situation. He is a king of the undead. He actually lost when he looked at an earthling!</p>

    <p>Instead, his soul entered the world of other his eyesight!</p>

    <p>And what's even more terrifying is that this boy's world of pupil power is infinitely vast... At most, it can only be within the scope of a solar system. But this boy's world of pupil power is a universe of its own. It is infinitely vast!</p>

    <p>Why can an earthling be so strong...</p>

    <p>This undead skeleton prince couldn't figure it out.</p>

    <p>And he seriously suspect that he have been cheated.</p>

    <p>That was not what the Holy Lord under His Royal Highness said when he found him.</p>

    <p>It is only said that there is probably a hidden Eternal in the team of Number 60 High School. He needs to find out.</p>

    <p>But in this situation, this is not a temptation!</p>

    <p>My life is about to be lost!</p>

    <p>This was his first instinct as an undead prince. He immediately sensed that Wang Ling was a very dangerous existence!</p>

    <p>However, as the prince of the undead, he still has the last bit of stubborn dignity. Even though he knows he can't defeat him, he still needs to resist...</p>

    <p>As Li Xian and Zhang Zhui mentioned before, there are many powerful races in the universe of the Eternal Era. However, most of the powerful races actually look down on the human Eternals.</p>

    <p>Over time, a chain of contempt was formed.</p>

    <p>Like the undead. They were despised by the Old Dominator. They were even reduced to food for the alien gods for a time. Throughout the ages, they have been engaged in the "Undead Lives Matter" movement every day. They have shouted slogans every day to protest against discrimination and oppression.</p>

    <p>As a result, they turned around and inflicted the rude behavior the Old Dominator had on them on other races.</p>

    <p>They say time is a cycle.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thinks this makes sense.</p>

    <p>Because this phenomenon still exists in the modern world of cultivation.</p>

    <p>"Earthling... don't come over. Although I have entered your world of pupil power, I am not afraid of you. If I self-destruct here, you will lose at least one eye!"</p>

    <p>The Skeleton Prince threatened Wang Ling. He tried to negotiate with Wang Ling. At the same moment, Wang Ling could sense that the other party's unwillingness to give up was about to move under the black cloak.</p>

    <p>It was a blue flame. It symbolized the heart of the undead. The heart of this skeleton prince was extremely bright.</p>

    <p>He secretly transported the spiritual power. At the same time, he watched Wang Ling vigilantly. Just a few seconds later, a rosary made of several small skeletons suddenly flew out from under his black cloak.</p>

    <p>In an instant, the power of the skull rosary burst out. The surge of spiritual power swallowed up the starlight in the sky. The powerful spiritual energy was like a greedy snake that suddenly broke into this world, drawing countless stars into its body.</p>

    <p>"Boom!"</p>

    <p>The moment the skull rosary broke out, an extremely terrifying power of disillusionment was produced, opening up a small immortal world. It was like a small isolated island in the pupil universe of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling nodded secretly. Being able to create another world in his pupil world to resist external pressure. This is already amazing.</p>

    <p>This world was created by the Skeleton Prince with the rosary beads in his hands. In the current environment, it is like a submarine entrenched deep in the seabed. There is always the risk of being crushed by water pressure.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't use any force. He just waited naturally. He wanted to see when the Skeleton Prince's island would collapse.</p>

    <p>After about eight seconds of silent counting.</p>

    <p>Really.</p>

    <p>There was another loud "boom" sound.</p>

    <p>The newly formed island fell apart in a very short period of time.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling no longer waits. The light beam wraps around his five fingers. With a gentle pinch, the entire island collapses before his eyes.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he lightly hooked his index finger. The Skeleton Prince's rosary betrayed him in public. It flew directly into Wang Ling's palm.</p>

    <p>"Give it back to me!" At this time, the Skeleton Prince became angry.</p>

    <p>Although this rosary is not the most powerful magic weapon in his body, it is of great significance!</p>

    <p>Because each string of skulls on the rosary is transformed from the skull of each of his blood relatives. It is a string of powerful growth-type magic weapons!</p>

    <p>It's just that he never expected that this rosary, which was created by his own blood relatives, could not withstand the temptation of Wang Ling's finger. It fell directly into his hands...</p>

    <p>The feeling of being betrayed and separated from his relatives made him unable to help vomiting blood in public.</p>
