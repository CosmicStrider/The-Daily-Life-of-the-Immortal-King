  <h1>Chapter 1319 The top of the sky・Palm Cliff</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In the underground seclusion cellar. Along with Wang Ling's figure disappeared.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi suddenly felt dizzy: "No... why does it hurt so much all of a sudden!"</p>

    <p>Even the death Heavenly Dao next to him had the same reaction. The two people slipped and fell to the ground, back to back.</p>

    <p>However, the headache symptoms disappeared quickly.</p>

    <p>The two of them sat slumped on the ground.</p>

    <p>Questions kept popping up in my mind.</p>

    <p>Why are they here?</p>

    <p>What on earth are they doing?</p>

    <p>"Senior Death Heavenly Dao?"</p>

    <p>"Eh?"</p>

    <p>"Do you feel like we forgot something..."</p>

    <p>"I have this feeling." Death Heavenly Dao nodded.</p>

    <p>He folded his arms and sat cross-legged on the ground, meditating. But he couldn't remember what he had forgotten.</p>

    <p>Zhuo YiCarefully observe the surrounding environment.</p>

    <p>Because part of the memory is missing. The memories of many things cannot be connected together.</p>

    <p>He didn't even know why he was in the retreat cellar of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>"Why is there such a big hole in the ceiling?"</p>

    <p>"Who could have stabbed him?"</p>

    <p>"It's such a big hole... who can poke this hole? There's one in the sky and one on the ground!"</p>

    <p>"Didn't Ling Zhenren leave just now? He might have stabbed him," Death Heavenly Dao said.</p>

    <p>"Too."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi nodded: "That's reasonable! My master is big everywhere. It's not surprising that he poked such a big hole."</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao: "What do you mean..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "I said my master has a big fist."</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao: "..."</p>

    <p>Emmm...</p>

    <p>The scene fell into a long silence.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi thought about death and Heavenly Dao. In the end, I felt that the memories could not be strung together.</p>

    <p>They seemed to have forgotten something together. Or rather, they had forgotten someone.</p>

    <p>"Let's go out and take a look. Maybe I'll remember it soon. And the master was so anxious just now. I think something must have happened. Let's go see if we can help!" At this time, Zhuo Yi stood up.</p>

    <p>He stretched out his hand and said, "Here comes the sword!"</p>

    <p>An emerald green crystal bamboo sword was inspired. It turned into a stream of light and fell into Zhuo Yi's hand.</p>

    <p>And the moment he held the sword.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi felt like his whole body was being shocked by a current!</p>

    <p>"Preliminary. What do you want to say to me?" Zhuo Yi asked, holding up the second sword in the world.</p>

    <p>I saw a string of words gradually appearing on "Yu"'s body: "Fate will tell you. The moment you see this string of words, you will be able to retrieve your lost memory."</p>

    <p>A moment!</p>

    <p>A stream of information suddenly poured into Zhuo Yi's mind from "Yu"'s body!</p>

    <p>"So that's it!" It only took a moment. Zhuo Yi understood.</p>

    <p>"What did you think of?"</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao asked. He is still confused.</p>

    <p>"I thought of something I forgot." Zhuo Yi giggled. As happy as a child.</p>

    <p>There are actually a lot of things he has to do now.</p>

    <p>So to remind myself all the time.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi took advantage of the power of "Yu" and backed up all the things he had to do in his sword spirit to prevent himself from forgetting.</p>

    <p>The words that appeared on "Yu" just now were carved by Zhuo Yi in advance.</p>

    <p>As long as you see this string of words, you can recall the designated memory!</p>

    <p>Resurrection ban will weaken the girl's sense of existence. This will make everyone around the girl forget about her.</p>

    <p>This is true!</p>

    <p>But the groundhog miscalculated after all.</p>

    <p>Sword Spirit...</p>

    <p>Not human!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The other side. The earth one second later. The position of the top of the sky.</p>

    <p>In front of the palm cliff.</p>

    <p>This is the most famous tourist attraction at Tianding.</p>

    <p>In front of the cliff is a vast ocean. You can see the horizon and the sunrise.</p>

    <p>The fracture in front of the cliff is very strange. It is a five-curved and wavy five-fingerprint.</p>

    <p>It is rumored that the sea in front of the palm cliff was struck out by a powerful person.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Mr. Gray Mist is still struggling with why the girl can see through his space jump.</p>

    <p>"How did you know?"</p>

    <p>His eyes were serious, staring closely at the girl in the Buddha's Golden Lotus.</p>

    <p>A cultivator in the Foundation Building period.</p>

    <p>It's impossible to use the power to see through space.</p>

    <p>And the key thing is that Mr. Gray Mist also discovered that since Sun Rong was kidnapped by him, he has always maintained an unusual calmness and composure.</p>

    <p>Although the girl's body was shaking uncontrollably because of the aura emanating from him.</p>

    <p>But he never showed the slightest fear.</p>

    <p>"Impossible... you are not the true son of the void yet! Although you have huge potential! But as long as you do not return to the void, you will not be able to obtain the huge power of the void world!" Lord Gray Mist was constantly thinking in his mind. : "So. It's impossible for you to see my space jump!"</p>

    <p>"Hasn't Senior discovered it yet?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Rong was sitting in the Buddha's Golden Lotus. He asked calmly.</p>

    <p>She raised her glowing eyes and looked somewhere.</p>

    <p>Only then did the prairie dog discover it in surprise.</p>

    <p>This shadow of Buddha's Golden Lotus is actually an afterimage...</p>

    <p>Although the shadow of the Golden Lotus is incomplete, it is illuminated by light.</p>

    <p>Golden Lotus at this moment. The shadow is stretched very long.</p>

    <p>And on this afterimage, three lines of words were carved.</p>

    <p>This is a note that girls are all too familiar with.</p>

    <p>Although it was brief, it brought her great peace of mind.</p>

    <p>The groundhog's eyes twitched. He looked at the message conveyed from the shadow in disbelief...</p>

    <p>He had no idea when exactly it was.</p>

    <p>These three lines of words were actually engraved on the afterimage of the Buddha's Golden Lotus!</p>

    <p>The first line is:</p>

    <p>[Earth one second later]</p>

    <p>It turns out that someone sent a message to this girl!</p>

    <p>At this time, after discovering the truth, the groundhog was extremely frightened.</p>

    <p>His forehead started to sweat uncontrollably.</p>

    <p>Then read along the first line of words.</p>

    <p>The second line of text is:</p>

    <p>[Don't be afraid]</p>

    <p>Don't be afraid?</p>

    <p>Are you telling the girl not to be afraid?</p>

    <p>No wonder this girl was so calm from beginning to end...</p>

    <p>Finally. The third line of text.</p>

    <p>It is also the third line that scares the prairie dog the most:</p>

    <p>[I'm coming]</p>

    <p>"Who's coming..."</p>

    <p>At this time, the sweat from the prairie dog's body has gathered into a small river at its feet.</p>

    <p>This is the Earth one second later!</p>

    <p>And he was also affected by the radiation of Sun Rong's "disappearing sense of existence."</p>

    <p>Logically speaking, no one remembers them anymore!</p>

    <p>According to the groundhog's plan!</p>

    <p>As long as he continues to take the girl and hide in the earth one second later!</p>

    <p>It won't be long before he can travel back and forth as he pleases.</p>

    <p>Transform into a terrifying mysterious gray mist creature!</p>

    <p>"Impossible! No one can find this place! No one!"</p>

    <p>The groundhog roared.</p>

    <p>And at this moment, the fourth line of words appeared on the afterimage of Buddha's Golden Lotus.</p>

    <p>It is still written by Wang Ling. It is in a very beautiful thin gold style.</p>

    <p>The fourth line of text:</p>

    <p>[Kill you again]</p>

    <p>When the groundhog saw this sentence, the whole mouse was frightened out of his mind!</p>

    <p>He stretched out his claws and tried to escape!</p>

    <p>Since the earth one second later won't work! Then drag it back a few more seconds!</p>

    <p>He doesn't believe it. Wang Ling can find him!</p>

    <p>When the claws are waving towards the void!</p>

    <p>Space jump. Happens again!</p>

    <p>"Successful!" At this time, the groundhog breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>However, after calming down, he found that something seemed wrong about the surrounding environment...</p>

    <p>This is simply not the top of the sky where he is!</p>

    <p>"Don't waste your efforts. I figured you would jump."</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling appeared, staring at him from behind. The message said.</p>

    <p>"I understand... you set up a space trap. You set the time back... As long as I jump, I will go back to the past time..." Mr. Gray Mist left in a cold sweat: "But you can't adjust the time like this. Yeah... I don't look like the Earth was just a second ago."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling shrugged.</p>

    <p>This is certainly not the Earth a second ago.</p>

    <p>Because from the beginning, he had no intention of correcting time.</p>

    <p>After all, this is still within the scope of the earth.</p>

    <p>No matter whether it is the earth one second ago or the earth one second later.</p>

    <p>It's not good to do anything.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling adjusted the time back by a few hundred million points.</p>

    <p>"This is the Earth 4 billion years ago."</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling stared at the prairie dog in front of him and moved his neck.</p>

    <p>"Four billion years ago..." The prairie dog was astonished at this moment. It cannot be described in words.</p>

    <p>"The God-Destroying Blow..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling without any unnecessary nonsense.</p>

    <p>Another palm fell on the groundhog.</p>

    <p>Ahead, the originally flat land was instantly knocked out of the groundwater by Wang Ling's palm!</p>

    <p>The surging tides continue to gather, forming a vast ocean!</p>

    <p>Just 4 billion years from now...</p>

    <p>This has become one of the most famous tourist attractions on earth - the top of the sky·Palm Cliff.</p>
