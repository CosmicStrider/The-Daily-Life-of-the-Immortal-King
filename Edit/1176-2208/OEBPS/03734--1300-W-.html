  <h1>Chapter 1300 A new problem arises</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The head of the Zhao family gave up his "80 lifetimes of cultivation" and was liberated from the land abandoned by the gods.</p>

    <p>The first thing he did was to personally prepare gifts and visit the Liu family to apologize.</p>

    <p>He was originally an instigated person. He believed in the evil head of the Sheng family and made the unwise move of siege.</p>

    <p>Now it is not easy to be able to put down my dignity and go to the city gate in person to apologize in front of all the Liu family children and people in Liucheng.</p>

    <p>The head of the Liu family is not a petty person. Naturally, he sent Liu Chengru to come out and accept the apology.</p>

    <p>After giving the gifts and apologizing, the head of the Zhao family stood at the gate of Liucheng and did not leave.</p>

    <p>Liu Chengru probably guessed what the head of the Zhao family was thinking: "The head of the Zhao family, do you want to ask me about the senior on earth..."</p>

    <p>Zhao Liegang suddenly raised his head and bowed: "Exactly! I don't know..."</p>

    <p>"The leader of the Zhao family is Dao God. He should also be aware that the senior has specially set up a restriction to block tracking. So I am not very clear about the intelligence information about that senior."</p>

    <p>Liu Chengru smiled and said: "But my master's eldest daughter Liu Qingyi is studying next to this senior. If you want to know more about it, you have to look at your own ability."</p>

    <p>"Thanks for the advice."</p>

    <p>The head of the Zhao family bowed again.</p>

    <p>I have to say that the head of the Zhao family has a very clear idea.</p>

    <p>This time, he really woke up and understood the truth that there is a heaven beyond the sky.</p>

    <p>He had already thought it through when he was in the God's Abandoned Land. Instead of struggling with bargaining with the God's Abandoned Pillar.</p>

    <p>It's better to come out early and make friends with the senior on Earth. That's the most important thing.</p>

    <p>With that senior's magical power, if I could establish a relationship with him, wouldn't it be easy for him to succeed in the future?</p>

    <p>In comparison, the cultivation level of eighty lifetimes is really nothing.</p>

    <p>As a result, the head of the Zhao family, who had walked out of the land abandoned by the gods, also began to prepare a plan to send his own son to study on earth...</p>

    <p>In addition, he is also thinking about how to make good friends with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Although he has not been able to deduce Wang Ling's name and where Wang Ling lives so far, he can still deduce Liu Qingyi's whereabouts.</p>

    <p>Finding Liu Qingyi first is the first step in the entire plan.</p>

    <p>In the forbidden area of the Zhao family, Zhao Ganglie summoned his eldest son Zhao Qingxian.</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian is a slightly chubby person. In fact, his strength is far inferior to Wang Zhen and Liu Qingyi.</p>

    <p>If I could describe it in one sentence, this is the legendary silly son of a landlord.</p>

    <p>Send Zhao Qingxian out. In fact, the head of the Zhao family still has a lot of worries...but he thought that if he followed the senior on Earth, his unsatisfactory son's interests could also improve.</p>

    <p>Before leaving, the head of the Zhao family gave many instructions.</p>

    <p>"After you arrive on Earth, you must first follow the low value given to you by your father. Find Liu Qingyi. Remember, you must be polite! Understand!"</p>

    <p>"Liu Qingyi?"</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian scratched his head: "Isn't this the eldest lady of the Liu family?"</p>

    <p>After saying that, Zhao Qingxian stretched out his hand: "Give me the stuff."</p>

    <p>"What?" the head of the Zhao family wondered.</p>

    <p>"What a betrothal gift! The eldest lady of the Liu family. I have also been interested in her for a long time!" Zhao Qingxian said confidently.</p>

    <p>"Who asked you to go down to the lower realms? I asked you to get clues about the senior on earth from Liu Qingyi. Then you can find a way to make friends with that senior! Did you hear that?"</p>

    <p>"My father is Dao God. Why should I be friends with people on earth..." Zhao Qingxian was puzzled.</p>

    <p>In fact, he didn't care at all about the previous battle involving the head of the Zhao family.</p>

    <p>And Zhao Ganglie didn't intend to tell him.</p>

    <p>I want to tell my own son. Your father was just pinched to death by that senior on earth...</p>

    <p>He couldn't say this at all!</p>

    <p>"Anyway, you must remember what your father told you! Be polite! Get close to Liu Qingyi. Then get in touch with the senior on Earth! As for how to deal with it, you can figure it out yourself."</p>

    <p>"Where's the money? Even if we make good friends, we still have to spend money."</p>

    <p>"After you go down to the next world.</p>

    <p>As a father, I will prepare it for you. "Okay. Wait until I pack my things. Let's set off immediately."</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian nodded. Then he bowed to Zhao Ganglie and said, "Then my son will leave first."</p>

    <p>"eh...go away."</p>

    <p>Zhao Ganglie snorted.</p>

    <p>He didn't know why he feels a little worried...</p>

    <p>Leave the family sanctuary.</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>He actually had thoughts about Liu Qingyi for a long time.</p>

    <p>This time I come to the earth in person. It is really an excellent opportunity!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. Inside the Office of Strategic Deception. Opinions no longer focus on matters in the God's Domain.</p>

    <p>There are currently five Dao Gods trapped in the Abandoned Land.</p>

    <p>Although everyone wants to know what will happen next, there are more important things to do right now.</p>

    <p>Guo Ping was ordered to come here. As the ambassador for establishing diplomatic relations with extraterrestrials from the Heavenly Dao planet, they jointly discussed and formulated a plan to upgrade the earth.</p>

    <p>In terms of time, everyone's opinions are relatively consistent.</p>

    <p>Because it needs to be implemented as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>So we just decided on Tuesday, December 1st.</p>

    <p>The problem is location.</p>

    <p>This is a huge impact on the earth caused by the condensed power of chaos from all the planetary spirits in the galaxy.</p>

    <p>Guo Ping gave it an easy-to-understand name - Chaos Tribulation Transcendence Cannon!</p>

    <p>If it can withstand this bombardment, the earth will be upgraded successfully.</p>

    <p>However, this obviously needs to be carried out in an inaccessible place, which is safer.</p>

    <p>It is difficult for cultivators on earth to accept the oppression of the power of chaos. Even radiation may harm innocent people.</p>

    <p>So the placement of the monk's "chaos egg" primer has become a problem.</p>

    <p>"How about the Infinite Sea?" Lord Diulei asked.</p>

    <p>"There are no people in this place. But there are a lot of marine life under the sea. The power of this radiation can reach the deep sea. Even if Tribulation Transcendence is successful, there will probably be a horrific scene of thousands of corpses floating around." Guo Ping shook his head.</p>

    <p>Then he turned his attention to the girl in the Buddha's Golden Lotus: "Miss Sun Rong. What do you think?"</p>

    <p>This earth upgrade thing. To put it bluntly, it all started because of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Guo Ping really wanted to hear Miss Sun's opinion.</p>

    <p>"Can I say it too?" Sun Rong was a little surprised.</p>

    <p>From the very beginning, the girl came with a learning attitude. Everyone here was in a higher realm than her.</p>

    <p>"Of course. Ling Zhenren specially planned this situation for this matter. Of course you can express your opinion." Guo Ping said.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong heard this. Her face turned red and she turned into a steam girl.</p>

    <p>"How about the Desert of Bones...?" Finally, Sun Rong expressed his thoughts.</p>

    <p>She felt that this should be a very logical answer.</p>

    <p>I just don't know why no one in the audience said it...</p>

    <p>As soon as he said this, everyone around him nodded.</p>

    <p>"What a great idea! This desert of dead bones is deserted. The experiment of the sky-dropped positive E bomb was also conducted there." Guo Ping nodded, like a chicken pecking at rice.</p>

    <p>"True Venerated Immortal. Lord Boundary King. Then book here!"</p>

    <p>At this time, the monk stood up, looked at Lord Diulie and Miss Ajuan and said.</p>

    <p>Everyone around him also stood up.</p>

    <p>"It is indeed the place that Miss Sun Rong came up with! I second my opinion!"</p>

    <p>"I second the proposal!"</p>

    <p>"I also second the proposal!"</p>

    <p>So, the choice of location was decided!</p>

    <p>Passed unanimously!</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>But the girl feels like she is being played...</p>

    <p>At this time, the monk couldn't help but smile.</p>

    <p>He thought that Guo Ping was a real human being.</p>

    <p>In fact, everyone present is an advanced cultivator with a certain level of vision. How could they be so entangled in choosing a place?</p>

    <p>So all of this is really just a show.</p>

    <p>Everyone can see it. Wait until this incident ends.</p>

    <p>The girl may also become one of the core members here.</p>

    <p>And letting Sun Rong express their opinions is also a way to integrate the girl into the environment as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>Even in the Foundation Building period.</p>

    <p>Then there is nothing to be ashamed of.</p>

    <p>Behind you.</p>

    <p>But there is another Ling Zhenren!</p>
