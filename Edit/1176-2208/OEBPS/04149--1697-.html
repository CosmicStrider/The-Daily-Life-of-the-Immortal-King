  <h1>Chapter 1697 Implanted consciousness</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ming wanted to give out detailed conceptual information about the first version of the new Talisman on Wang Ling's birthday. He planned to name it "Eternal Talisman." He privately thought that this was the best thing he could give so far.</p>

    <p>Compared with all those fancy things that money can buy, only the design and development of Eternal Talisman can bring eternal happiness to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Many people have different definitions of happiness.</p>

    <p>So for Wang Ling. What exactly is happiness?</p>

    <p>In this regard, as a brother, Wang Ming feels that he has thought very thoroughly.</p>

    <p>For Wang Ling, happiness is simple and plain.</p>

    <p>He especially hoped that one day he could tell Wang Ling in person: "Congratulations, Lingzi... you can finally live a normal life."</p>

    <p>However, there is still a long way to go to realize such a vision.</p>

    <p>After analyzing the memory chip brought from the Virtual Realm through a dedicated analysis helmet, Wang Ming suddenly felt that his brain and body fell into a long-lost fatigue.</p>

    <p>Logically speaking, with his brain capacity, it is not a problem to process this part of short-term memory. But now he actually has a trance-like feeling. This makes Wang Ming feel a little uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>When he stood up, his body swayed. He almost knocked over the coffee on the table. Zhai Yin stepped forward and held him firmly: "Don't force yourself too much."</p>

    <p>"I didn't..." Wang Ming's face turned pale and he said slightly weakly.</p>

    <p>He is a little uncomfortable. I'm just analyzing the data. How could he be so tired?</p>

    <p>Could it be... a problem with the crystal card?</p>

    <p>Wang Ming vaguely sensed something was wrong. He quickly grabbed Li Xian's hand and said, "Senior Li Xian, let me ask you... who else has touched this crystal card?"</p>

    <p>"The crystal card was given to us by Mr. Ming. It has never been touched by anyone." Li Xian replied.</p>

    <p>"During the process of making this crystal card, did anyone see it?"</p>

    <p>"During the production, Brother Zi Xiang and I used the Minature Corpse Map given by Ling Zhenren to seal the remaining trapped creatures. I have never seen how this crystal card was made." Li Xian answered truthfully.</p>

    <p>After saying this, Wang Ming suddenly felt bad.</p>

    <p>If no one is there to see the production process of this crystal card, then the situation will be very intriguing...</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ming's thoughts were very confused. Despite his headache, he stacked the hands of Zhai Yin, Li Xian, and Zhang Zhui together. Then he held them up himself: "Yinzi and seniors Li Xian and senior Zhang Zhui... What I say below is very important. Please be sure to stay calm after hearing what I say..."</p>

    <p>"Mr. Ming just said it's okay. We'll all listen to Mr. Ming's arrangements."</p>

    <p>"That's right. I suspect that my brain has been implanted with a consciousness. In simple terms, you can also understand this consciousness as a virus in the computer program."</p>

    <p>"Conscious body? What will happen to Mr. Ming?"</p>

    <p>"It's hard to tell the result. This consciousness is very strong. I have tried to clean it with my own power. But it doesn't work."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said: "Looking at it now, the worst-case scenario is that I might become a completely different person."</p>

    <p>"Then what do we do?" At this time, Zhai Yin calmed down and looked at Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming suddenly smiled bitterly: "Why don't you cry? I'm already like this... and... if I become another person, I might not be able to change back."</p>

    <p>"What's the use of crying... I believe you have a solution! And... you have to change back!"</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhai Yin held Wang Ming's head: "Wang Ming! You must always remember! If you can't change back! You will most likely be assigned to the legendary Minotaur plot!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming: "..."</p>

    <p>Zhai Yin's statement was so terrifying that it made Wang Ming suddenly wake up like an enlightenment.</p>

    <p>And it turns out that this obsession to avoid being turned into a tauren played a huge role in the subsequent progress...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The other side.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi and Sun Rong are still overwhelmed by the shocking human-shaped gift box in front of them. The courier boy responsible for delivering the gift box is provided by the merchant. Faced with the situation of dissatisfied customers. This guy was also a little helpless: "Miss Sun, this gift box is completely customized according to your requirements. The key is that it really doesn't look like a coffin at all. And it looks very exquisite at first glance! The workmanship is full of materials. !"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"And our boss knows that Miss Sun is giving it to her boyfriend. She wants to give her boyfriend a surprise."</p>

    <p>"No... he's not yet..."</p>

    <p>"Hehe. It will always be the case in the future. Our gift box is a masterpiece that the boss spent an entire night making. When the gift box is opened, there is a mezzanine. It also comes with a crib." The courier boy rubbed his hands.</p>

    <p>Their boss had actually reached this stage a long time ago. No girl can stop the thought of falling in love with the person she likes for a lifetime and then having a baby.</p>

    <p>Often just some baby-related design elements can improve the maternal nature of these girls.</p>

    <p>This is the general trend.</p>

    <p>It is precisely because of this that there are more and more mom fans these days.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, after hearing these words, Sun Rong couldn't stand it any longer, and immediately made up her mind: "No need to say anything. I will buy it!"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>So just ten minutes later, when Zhuo Yi delivered a cart of limited-edition dry noodles and a human-shaped gift box to the door of the Wang family's villa.</p>

    <p>Mother Wang, who came out to help sign for the goods, was immediately stunned: "Little Zhuo. These are..."</p>

    <p>"These are gifts for Master. But they are not given by me. I am only responsible for escorting them." Zhuo Yi said while wiping his sweat.</p>

    <p>"Hey. Just come. What else can I give you? That's so polite." Mother Wang said a few words. Then she focused all her attention on the unique-looking humanoid gift box next to it.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi immediately became nervous: "Well... don't be anxious first. Just listen to my explanation..."</p>

    <p>"Little Zhuozi, there is no need to explain." Mother Wang was stunned for a while, then shook her head: "The child has grown up after all... During the growth and development period, it is easy to hold back. It is normal to need an outlet to vent."</p>

    <p>"That's not the case. Auntie..."</p>

    <p>"I know. Lingling in a special situation, so a normal one won't hold up, so this must be a special one, right? It's made of special material so that it won't break so easily."</p>

    <p>"..." Zhuo Yi held his head. It felt like he couldn't explain it at all: "This is really not..."</p>

    <p>"I understand. Little Zhuozi. Thank you for your thoughtful consideration."</p>

    <p>"No, Auntie. This is really not an inflatable..."</p>

    <p>"Inflatable sandbag? The material is too poor."</p>

    <p>"Oh. So Auntie was talking about sandbags... Then it's okay..."</p>
