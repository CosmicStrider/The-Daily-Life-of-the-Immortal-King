  <h1>Chapter 2053 The little expert in mining reappears in the world</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling raised his hand to strike. It was tantamount to directly bombarding the Sun family's ancestral land. The power of one strike was not just as simple as punching through a wall. It was afraid that it would directly penetrate all the maps behind it.</p>

    <p>Even more serious. This palm will directly make a hole in the belly of the whale, causing the ancient whale outside to directly "perforate the stomach."</p>

    <p>Of course Wang Ling also knew the stakes. So he only used 1% of the Law Palm. It seemed to be safer.</p>

    <p>Just as he was about to gather his spiritual power, a spiritual talisman from afar arrived instantly. The spiritual power signal directly traced to Wang Ling at a strange angle appeared directly in front of his eyes.</p>

    <p>This is the spiritual talisman of Zhuo Yi. However, it is also mixed with the spiritual power of Monk Jin Deng. In other words, this communication talisman can be accurately sent here. There is also the help of Monk Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>"Array instant birth talisman?"</p>

    <p>Upon seeing this, Immortal Toya immediately made a judgment.</p>

    <p>This is a talisman that can quickly summon formations. It has the same effect as the magic crystal stone that can quickly set up large formations.</p>

    <p>The current function of spiritual stones such as Dharma Crystal is to fuse a pre-arranged array into the crystal. If necessary, just smash the crystal. A well-structured array can be immediately arranged on the ground.</p>

    <p>This is a technology that was previously known to Wang Ling in the Beast King Ruins that combines modern cultivation technology. The scientific difficulty lies in the "condensation technology of formations."</p>

    <p>However, the cost of Dharma Crystal is very expensive. Therefore, it is mostly used for setting up large formations. If it is some small formations, using Dharma Crystal to arrange it feels like overkill.</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhuo Yi must have had an ulterior motive in sending this formation instantaneous talisman. And when the talisman opened on the ground, the moment he saw the formation lines, Wang Ling knew it. This is a psychic magic circle.</p>

    <p>Are you sending someone or a spiritual beast here?</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>Along with the golden light of the psychic circle with a radius of two meters, the golden light continued to emerge. In a cloud of misty gray mist that suddenly spewed out, a familiar little figure made everyone present except Sun Ru suddenly realize.</p>

    <p>"Ground... marmot?" Sun Ru suddenly blinked her eyes. There was some disbelief in her eyes. She never expected that such an ordinary-looking creature would suddenly land here.</p>

    <p>"It turns out to be you."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling put down his hand. He almost forgot that this little thing existed.</p>

    <p>Since the last incident of forced reincarnation, this prairie dog has been unable to accept the change of its gender and has been in autistic state.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't expect that</p>

    <p>Indeed. In terms of excavation technology, as a mature groundhog, Mr. Gray Mist is very familiar with the road.</p>

    <p>The most important thing is that this guy knows how to control his strength so as not to directly cause huge and irreversible damage to the Sun family's ancestral land.</p>

    <p>At this time Wang Ling once again felt that his apprenticeship was not in vain.</p>

    <p>In a sense, Zhuo Yi still cares about his master. And he thinks very carefully. He even knows to contact Monk Jin Deng to bring this stupid prairie dog here.</p>

    <p>"Let me introduce to Senior Sun Ru. The full name of this groundhog is: Tu Li Buri. Dao name: Gray Mist Lord. It was once a sacred beast kept in captivity by Dao Ancestor Wang. It is now adopted by Senior Jin Deng." In the core world. Immortal Toya introduced the origin of the groundhog with a smile.</p>

    <p>"Is it Dao Ancestor's mythical beast?" Sun Ru was stunned. Then it became even more horrifying.</p>

    <p>No! That doesn't seem to be the point!</p>

    <p>She heard a familiar name...</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng...</p>

    <p>"Senior Jin Deng is actually still alive? How many reincarnations has this taken..." Sun Ru was surprised.</p>

    <p>"What? Senior Sun Ru also knows about him?"</p>

    <p>"Of course I know! This is a senior who can be reincarnated with his memories! While I was sleeping, he should have climbed to the top and become the sage of Buddhism, right?"</p>

    <p>"Senior Sun Ru is absolutely right. I didn't expect you and senior Jin Deng to be familiar with each other."</p>

    <p>"It's familiar. You can ask senior Jin Deng. He was reincarnated in one life and became my sister."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Wang Ying: "..."</p>

    <p>Immortal Toya: "..."</p>

    <p>Really.</p>

    <p>You will never guess what a monk who forgot to drink Meng Po soup went through in his reincarnations... Originally Wang Ling thought that Jin Deng's reincarnation experience as a woman was quite extreme. It turned out that his imagination was still too small.</p>

    <p>This is more than just being a woman...</p>

    <p>It's all aspects. He has experienced girls of all kinds and styles.</p>

    <p>No wonder he can transcend the world of mortals and become the sage of Buddhism. It turns out that there is a cause and effect relationship in all this.</p>

    <p>"Aren't you autistic?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ying's voice came. He crossed his arms and stared directly at the summoned groundhog and asked.</p>

    <p>"Hey. It's all in the past. There's nothing to figure out."</p>

    <p>Mr. Gray Mist said this, but in fact there was still a hint of sadness on his face: "The monk said that as long as I complete the task, he can help me get my original body back."</p>

    <p>"It turned out to be a transaction." Wang Ying smiled.</p>

    <p>"No way. Now I have figured it out. There is nothing wrong with working as a worker." Lord Gray Mist sighed.</p>

    <p>It has learned enough lessons. As one of the few beings that has competed with the two brothers Wang Ying, Wang Ling and Wang Nuan, it can never forget its painful experience.</p>

    <p>The next moment, its little head kept wandering around, as if it was looking for something in this ancestral land of the Sun family.</p>

    <p>Soon, it understood the exact location of the knight's tomb in the mountain. It began to lead everyone directly: "Go here."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thinks this groundhog is a bit strange.</p>

    <p>He doesn't know why. He feels like this guy has returned to his home...</p>

    <p>"Strange. Why do I feel like you are so familiar with this place? Huh?" Wang Ying asked.</p>

    <p>This question directly caused the prairie dog to burst into cold sweat.</p>

    <p>"I have robbed many tombs of the Ancients in the past... you know. There are many heavenly materials and earthly treasures inside. Otherwise, I would not be able to cultivate to a level higher than other divine beasts. Do you think so..."</p>

    <p>The groundhog explained it this way. But obviously such a weak explanation could not directly convince Wang Ling and Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>Such weak rhetoric is fine to deceive laymen. But it is completely useless in front of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Under the intense gaze, at that moment, the prairie dog seemed to remember the scene of being beaten one after another. His hair suddenly exploded all over his body. He was so excited that he finally had to tell the truth: "Hey, let me be honest. I I've been here before. My main job when I came here was to do transportation work."</p>

    <p>"Be more specific." Wang Ying chuckled.</p>

    <p>"It's just stealing... you know. We are the kind of creatures who just like to hoard some treasures for ourselves... then we can only dig everywhere..." the groundhog said helplessly.</p>

    <p>"Haha. You actually have the attributes of a hamster?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ying continued to ask: "But the Sun family's ancestral land is hidden in the belly of a whale. How can you actually find it?"</p>

    <p>"The original Sun family's ancestral land. I'm sure it's not inside the whale's belly. It was transplanted later." The prairie dog replied.</p>

    <p>After all, it is almost a creature from the same period as Dao Ancestor Wang. What it says is still somewhat credible.</p>

    <p>In order to confirm his statement, Mr. Gray Mist directly led Wang Ling everyone to a corner of the Zhenshan Knight's tomb. He pointed there with his nails and said, "Look, there are my paw prints here. I was like that before. Digging it in."</p>

    <p>"The Mountain Knights didn't respond at all to your invasion?"</p>

    <p>"Hey. There were so many mountain knights at that time. The defense was very loose. And I didn't have many things at my disposal. Basically, it was enough."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
