  <h1>Chapter 1774: Estrangement</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Li Weiwei's roar was able to stop ten thousand men. This roar was completely unexpected by the group of lurking tengu. But this time they gathered a large number of people. Thousands of Soul Formation troops. Facing Li Weiwei's 500 people The island's maritime border defense group is not worried at all.</p>

    <p>The leading tengu wears a five-star Jason mask. He is the commander of this operation. He is also the person with the highest level among these Soul Formation troops. He is at the ninth level of Soul Formation! Only half a meter away from a breakthrough!</p>

    <p>"Captain Li, you are well." He was an old man. He was leaning on a cane and wearing a sea animal skin coat. He took the initiative to reach out from the bottom of the sea. But he didn't get even a drop of water on his body.</p>

    <p>All the Soul Formations summoned here this time are cultivators who major in the water system. More than half of them have water spiritual roots in their bodies. Their combat capabilities in water-related environments will be greatly enhanced.</p>

    <p>Therefore, this is one of the reasons why these tengu are so confident.</p>

    <p>"Leave quickly!" Li Weiwei had no other words. Facing the invading enemy, he did not have such a good temper. As he spoke, the aura in his body was already surging. He seemed to be ready to fight at any time.</p>

    <p>The leader, the old Tengu man, smiled. His yellowed teeth were exposed under his mask: "I didn't come here just to fight with Captain Li today. Although we outnumber you, Captain Li is not easy to mess with. If we really put it all together, it might be a lose-lose situation."</p>

    <p>"Now that you know, get out of here!" Li Weiwei was already a little impatient in his words.</p>

    <p>The old man Tengu pretended not to hear and just kept talking to himself: "In fact, Commander Li also thinks in his heart that it is not necessary for us to fight, right? Use the lives of us in exchange for the lives of these brothers in the border defense group."</p>

    <p>"Whether it's necessary or not depends on your attitude."</p>

    <p>Li Weiwei was fearless and took the initiative to take a step forward: "I, the man from the Border Guard Corps, will never allow foreign enemies to invade. If you want to fight, no one here is afraid of death!"</p>

    <p>"Captain Li is too anxious... I told you. The purpose of my trip is not just to fight."</p>

    <p>The old Tengu man Jie Jie said with a smile: "The last question. Commander Li is not curious. How can we summon a thousand Soul Formation troops to surround this place without you noticing?"</p>

    <p>Li Weiwei frowned but did not speak. This group of people came very strangely. They were lurking under the sea as if they appeared out of thin air. In the process, they also deliberately fired two missiles at the Immortal ship in the air...</p>

    <p>Although they were not shot down, such provocative behavior was enough to demonstrate the confidence of this group of people.</p>

    <p>The person sitting on the "immortal ship" is the eldest lady of the Huaguo Shuilian Group. And this green route was originally planned for this lady by the Office of Strategic Deception. Now the Huaguo Shuilian Group and the Office of Strategic Deception has a cooperative relationship..."</p>

    <p>The old man ignored Li Weiwei's increasingly solemn eyes and sneered.</p>

    <p>"What exactly do you want to say?" Li Weiwei frowned deeply.</p>

    <p>"It's a very simple reason." The old man Tiangu said with a kind of confidence: "Commander Li, think about it. Why can we appear out of thin air and lurk near this island. We can ambush here in advance... The reason is very simple. That is there are people in Huaguo Shuilian and Office of Strategic Deception who belong to Tengu."</p>

    <p>As soon as these words came out, Sun Rong was stunned. Only then did she realize the Tengu's true purpose.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "This group of people are talking nonsense... They actually said that there are people in Huaguo Shuilian Group and the Office of Strategic Deception who are traitors."</p>

    <p>"It seems that the purpose of these tengu appearing here is to create a wedge between them."</p>

    <p>Butler Lin also secretly felt that the situation was not good.</p>

    <p>The current development of the Office of Strategic Deception is too fast and too powerful. Although the Office of Strategic Deception also has part of the control of Huaxiu Alliance, as the largest sect on the earth, Western countries have always had no control over the Office of Strategic Deception. Smear campaigns have never stopped.</p>

    <p>For example, in Mixiu Country, there is a very dangerous voice, saying that the Office of Strategic Deception is the most successful. It is a country within a country.</p>

    <p>Now, Tengu has resorted to this alienation trick again...</p>

    <p>This deepened the internal suspicion. Butler Lin sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid that the next days for the Office of Strategic Deception will be a little difficult. On the other hand, after hearing the words of the old Tengu man, the look on Li Weiwei's face was also quite ugly.</p>

    <p>It was impossible for him to completely believe what the old man in front of him said. However, there might indeed be Tengu within the Huaguo Shuilian Group and the Office of Strategic Deception. He would definitely report this important news to his superiors.</p>

    <p>As for other matters, we can only leave them to Shangfeng to investigate.</p>

    <p>And now, his first task is to expel all these invading tengu!</p>

    <p>"What you said has nothing to do with me. I just want you. Get away from the Nantian Islands as quickly as possible!"</p>

    <p>Li Weiwei snorted and stepped forward. The spiritual light on his body vibrated. He summoned a silver armor and wore it on his body. He directly entered the battle preparation state.</p>

    <p>"Why. I brought such valuable information to Commander Li. Commander Li still wants to take action?"</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>The nearby sea surface was shaking along with the entire Nantian Islands. A terrifying spiritual energy seeped out from the sea water. It was awe-inspiring. It was like a deep-sea monster dormant deep under the sea was resurrecting.</p>

    <p>Li Weiwei instantly felt extremely vigilant.</p>

    <p>He could feel that the old Tengu of the ninth level of Soul Formation in front of him was much more powerful than that!</p>

    <p>"Anyone who offends our sea territory will be killed without mercy!" Li Weiwei was extremely determined. He shouted a war cry, which aroused the excitement of all the soldiers in the entire island army. Everyone shared the same hatred. The expression on his face was cautious but also slightly angry.</p>

    <p>"Captain Li, I told you earlier that our side was 50-50 with yours, but you really believed me? Why are you fighting against a stone with an egg? If you can go back alive today, remember to convey for me to your superiors, thanks to the Office of Strategic Deception and Huaguo Shuilian Group for the information." The old man smiled.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>At the same time, a sea wall of tens of meters was formed behind him. It blocked the sky and the sun. It was shaped like the palm of the sea god. It was terrifying and boundless. It was completely controlled by the old man.</p>

    <p>There was no need for the thousands of troops behind him. The old man's single strength already gave people a creepy feeling. At that moment, the overwhelming spiritual pressure collapsed. With just one palm, everyone on the island felt it. It was as if they was carrying a huge mountain on my back.</p>

    <p>This spiritual pressure was so great that many people were unable to move.</p>

    <p>"Don't even think about trapping me!"</p>

    <p>Li Weiwei gritted his teeth and moved forward. He took a step forward. Then he began to run forward with a kind of arrogant and domineering spiritual power. Every time he took a step, the soles of his feet sank a little downward. It seemed that he was using brute force.</p>

    <p>He started out in the flesh, headed for a coordinate, and ended up crashing into a piece of spirit stone!</p>

    <p>At the moment when the spirit stone shattered, the island's defense array was also activated at the same moment. In an instant, dozens of chains came from all directions around the Nantian Islands! They shot towards the invading enemy accurately!</p>

    <p>These are all immortal locks made of spirit-binding materials. If cultivators get involved, they will be unable to allocate spiritual power.</p>

    <p>"Zoom!"</p>

    <p>The old man didn't pay attention to these immortal bonds at all. His palms gave birth to a dark blue spiritual light, with a kind of withering power. In an instant, endless mist rose up, surrounding the entire island.</p>

    <p>This method shocked Li Weiwei because he could see that these defensive bindings were corroding rapidly under the corrosive mist full of seawater smell at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p>

    <p>"The situation is not good. It seems that Commander Li is in trouble..."</p>

    <p>Butler Lin watched the battle remotely through the equipment in the immortal boat. Seeing that Li Weiwei was at an impasse, he was anxious for a while. He hurriedly said: "Miss, don't move. I'll go down and help him."</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, he found that Sun Rong who was sitting next to him had disappeared.</p>

    <p>An escape hatch at the end of the immortal boat.</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Rong has put on the nine-tailed fox mask of "Wang Piaoliang." She is fully armed.</p>

    <p>After taking a deep breath, she jumped down...</p>
