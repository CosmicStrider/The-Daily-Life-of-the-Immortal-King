  <h1>Chapter 1370 Sun Rong tests the sword!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>A phenomenon in which the concentration of the power of chaos soared appeared in the Mountain of Recall. This is indeed a big deal.</p>

    <p>The demon star where the demon world is located is hidden. However, the distance from the earth is actually not too far.</p>

    <p>Once the power of chaos cannot be suppressed, it rushes out from the secret realm and causes the demon star to explode.</p>

    <p>With the blessing of the power of chaos, the explosive power of the demon star will penetrate the entire galaxy.</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling is also reflecting.</p>

    <p>If he hadn't planned to save trouble and then set up a secret cultivation realm, even if the concentration of the power of chaos reached 100%, it would be impossible to blow up his secret realm.</p>

    <p>But now, regretting is of no use.</p>

    <p>The key is.</p>

    <p>Find out the reason for the abnormal surge in the concentration of the power of Chaos. And save the situation.</p>

    <p>Regarding the phenomenon of abnormal surge. Wang Ling actually has a rough inference.</p>

    <p>That is the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube originally created by Dao Ancestor Wang. Its purpose is not just as an external stabilizer for the core world...</p>

    <p>It should also play a role in checking and balancing the density of the universe.</p>

    <p>Now. The Unspeakable Land has been disintegrated. One of the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cubes is fused with Aohai.</p>

    <p>In the absence of checks and balances, this phenomenon of abnormal power of chaos will occur again in the future...</p>

    <p>First of all. Apart from the option of "returning the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube", there is actually another option before Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>That is to create a new "Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube" and replace it.</p>

    <p>But if one of them is replaced, then the remaining eight Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cubes will also have to be replaced.</p>

    <p>No way.</p>

    <p>The Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube he created is too powerful.</p>

    <p>Possibly far more powerful than the original version created by Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>If only one was created to replace the current loophole, there would still be no way to truly act as a check and balance.</p>

    <p>"Create a Rubik's Cube?"</p>

    <p>Beside the pillow. Jingke shook slightly and then transformed into a human form.</p>

    <p>He is also thinking about the problem that Wang Ling is thinking about.</p>

    <p>For Wang Ling, it is not difficult to create a new Rubik's Cube. It only requires materials and a certain amount of time.</p>

    <p>However, the current situation is actually far more complicated than everyone imagines.</p>

    <p>For a person like Dao Ancestor Wang who is meticulous in his work, it is impossible to imagine how terrible it would be if the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube failed to form a restriction, causing an abnormal imbalance in the concentration of the power of chaos in the universe.</p>

    <p>Therefore. Wang Ling suspects that the remaining eight Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cubes may adopt a "revenge mechanism" at any time.</p>

    <p>Get the one that is combined with Aohai back.</p>

    <p>But what exactly the form of revenge will be is not yet known.</p>

    <p>"I need to trouble Bai Qiao to go there."</p>

    <p>In front of the desk. Wang Ling holds his chin, carefully thinking about countermeasures.</p>

    <p>The top priority right now is to solve the abnormal concentration of chaos power in the secret area and help Er Ha successfully complete the upgrade of Tribulation Transcendence.</p>

    <p>"Can't I go?" Jingke asked.</p>

    <p>"Aohai has no sheath spirit." Wang Ling replied.</p>

    <p>Although the words were concise and concise, Jingke finally understood.</p>

    <p>Because Aohai does not have a sheath spirit.</p>

    <p>Even if he went there in person, he still wouldn't be able to complete the integration.</p>

    <p>But if Bai Qiao goes there, the situation will be completely different.</p>

    <p>This decision.</p>

    <p>In fact, I am also helping Sun Rong try out the sword.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Internet cafe inside the Office of Strategic Deception. Bai Qiao put down his headphones.</p>

    <p>Being interrupted while playing the game made Bai Qiao, a veteran otaku, a little uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>She scratched her hair and said, "It's so annoying. You can't let people play games anymore!"</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling's face. It's impossible for her not to give it.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Bai Qiao was quickly pushed to the front line under Lord Ma's teleportation light.</p>

    <p>It's just approaching the entrance to the secret realm of "Mountain of Recall."</p>

    <p>The powerful power of chaos inside has seeped out. Bai Qiao's dull hair danced backwards like a piece of seaweed that was enduring a strong storm. It was swaying in the wind...</p>

    <p>"Who are you?" Sun Rong asked as he faced the girl who suddenly appeared in front of him.</p>

    <p>She saw Bai Qiao wearing a fire-breathing dragon one-piece pajamas. There was also a bright red earphone hanging around his neck. The house was full of cuteness.</p>

    <p>"I am your Lord's woman." Bai Qiao replied.</p>

    <p>The dull hair on the top of her head was under her control. It seemed to be turning consciously.</p>

    <p>She saw Sun Rong's face darken. She knew that her joke seemed to be too big. She quickly changed her words: "Okay. I am his scabbard. The Lord asked me to help."</p>

    <p>The next second. Sun Rong's expression immediately returned to normal: "So you are Miss Bai Qiao!"</p>

    <p>The speed of this change made Bai Qiao feel a little caught off guard.</p>

    <p>"You are also White Hair. Is this author a white hair person?" Sun Ying'er actually knew Bai Qiao's identity. But this was her first meeting with Bai Qiao. After seeing Bai Qiao's appearance, she felt Still a little surprised.</p>

    <p>" The milk-riding loli lover and the Ku Xuan white-haired lover are both authors from the state of Wenzhou, and they are a perfect match."</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao shrugged indifferently. He was as venomous as ever: "Let's leave the small talk later. It's better to resolve the matter at hand first. Miss Sun, please come in with me."</p>

    <p>"But Senior Jin Deng said it's very dangerous inside..."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry. I'm here and you won't hurt Miss Sun." Bai Qiao said confidently.</p>

    <p>She added another protective golden light to Sun Rong. Then she stepped into the secret realm.</p>

    <p>Then.</p>

    <p>There was a "pop" sound.</p>

    <p>Kneeling next to Shen Wuyue.</p>

    <p>Shen Wuyue: "..."</p>

    <p>Second Generation Demon Saint: "..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng-_-: "Miss Bai Qiao. It's not the Chinese New Year yet. There's no need to give this big gift..."</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect the concentration of chaos inside to be so high..." The expression on Bai Qiao's face looked a little embarrassed. On the contrary, Sun Rong who was following her was fine at all.</p>

    <p>The illuminated body is coupled with the protective golden light she personally arranged and Aohai's own sword energy protective body. This allows Sun Rong to move freely even under such a strong concentration of chaos power.</p>

    <p>Apart from feeling a slight sense of hypoxia, there was no other discomfort.</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao patted the dust on his pajamas. He stood up from the ground and asked, "How is the situation now?"</p>

    <p>Jin Deng frowned: "It's not optimistic. I have already slapped the sky. I want to disintegrate this power of chaos. However, with the power of my palm, I cannot eradicate it all at once. I can only try my best to control the concentration."</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao nodded. After understanding the situation, she turned her gaze to Sun Rong: "Miss Sun, let's try the sword first. Slash towards the sky. Feel it."</p>

    <p>"Eh? Is that okay? It's more important to control the situation first, right?" Sun Rong was stunned.</p>

    <p>Bai Qiao said with an expressionless expression: "The secret realm is arranged by the Lord. The concentration must exceed 65% before it collapses. The current concentration is only 40%. There is still time left."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong Unexpectedly, the purpose of Bai Qiao letting him in was to let him try the sword.</p>

    <p>The reason why Bai Qiao came here is because of the instruction of classmate Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>So...</p>

    <p>Is classmate Wang Ling creating a chance for her to try the sword?</p>

    <p>The girl's mood immediately improved when she thought of this.</p>

    <p>"Thank you, classmate Wang Ling. Thank you, Miss Bai Qiao! Thank you, seniors! You're welcome."</p>

    <p>Then. Sun Rong quickly pulled Aohai out of the scabbard. A powerful sword energy burst out from Aohai's sword body!</p>

    <p>"drink!"</p>

    <p>Sun RongThe sword points to the sky. Cut it off with one sword!</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The sword light seeped out from Aohai's edge. At first it was only a few inches, and then it continued to surge as it hit the sky!</p>

    <p>The turbulent sword intent accompanied the sound of the tsunami, which echoed continuously like the Hong Zhong of Heavenly Dao. The terrifying sword pressure rushed towards the power of chaos that was constantly accumulating in the sky, making the entire secret realm dazzling!</p>

    <p>"A Foundation Building. Can actually cut out a sword energy of tens of thousands of meters..." At this time, the second-generation Demon Saint and Shen Wuyue who were kneeling on the ground were both stunned.</p>
