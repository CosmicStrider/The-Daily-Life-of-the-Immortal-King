  <h1>Chapter 1452 Wang Ling's Milk Candy</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The deal with Sun Rong has been concluded.</p>

    <p>Shou Chong left the villa under the escort of the commissioner assigned by Sun Rong. This was to prevent the Jiugong family's spies from monitoring nearby.</p>

    <p>Since the Office of Strategic Deception can arrange an undercover agent in Jiugong's home, there is no guarantee that there will be a mole in her villa.</p>

    <p>So. The girl immediately implemented the following plans.</p>

    <p>One: Use Aohai's sword energy to form a sword barrier. Within the scope of the villa, no communication signals can be transmitted. If there is a ghost in the villa, not only can the signal be effectively blocked, but even the communication talisman will be intercepted by Aohai.</p>

    <p>Two: She asked Sun Ying'er to help. She wrote down the shadow of everyone in the villa. If there was a new maid hired, the new shadow would be captured immediately by Sun Ying'er.</p>

    <p>Of course, this operation is also feasible if you ask Aunt Qiu to specifically ask for information and then identify each person's face.</p>

    <p>However, there is too much movement, which can easily reveal the truth.</p>

    <p>Finally, and the third point: before Shou Chong left the villa, Sun Rong specially asked the maid of the villa to take a bath and put on a neat new suit.</p>

    <p>Avoid places outside the villa where Aohai's sword energy barrier cannot take care of. Place the Jiugong family's eyeliners.</p>

    <p>Even if there is eyeliner, facing the new look of Shou Chong, I am afraid that it will not be recognized at first glance.</p>

    <p>The above decision-making was decisive, swift and clear-thinking. Shou Chong was amazed to see it.</p>

    <p>On the way out of the Sun family villa, Shou Chong had already begun to make plans in his mind...</p>

    <p>Now, he has two parties.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong and Jiugong Liangzi are both.</p>

    <p>But after such a comparison, it is actually obvious which Party A is more powerful...</p>

    <p>Although it is true that the eldest lady of the Sun family provided him with 15 billion in funds, it is obvious that this eldest lady is a character who is not easy to fool.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Shou Chong feels that it is necessary to be a little more serious about the research and development of magic weapons for Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>At least we must develop a magic weapon that is sustainable and profitable...</p>

    <p>After this wave, his 20 billion "Infinite Energy Plan" research funding has been barely realized.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong treats him well... Mainly because Party A's father is not easy to fool. So Shou Chong feels that he needs to be extra serious about his research on Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Of course. There is also Shou Chong's own intuition in this.</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. During the conversation with the eldest lady of the Sun family, Shou Chong felt a chill behind her...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, after Wang Ling finished his homework in the study, he has been observing the movements in Jiugong's villa and Sun Rong's side...</p>

    <p>Of course, he didn't intentionally spy on these two girls.</p>

    <p>Just out of pure curiosity. What will these two girls do...</p>

    <p>The result. Let Wang Ling be shocked.</p>

    <p>For his pair of dead fish eyes. The two girls combined invested 20 billion in research funds.</p>

    <p>Although it is not my own money.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling's first reaction was still distressed...</p>

    <p>20 billion!</p>

    <p>How many crispy noodles can you buy?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling remember that there was a news in the news a while ago that the god of gambling, the immortal, passed away.</p>

    <p>This legendary God of Gamblers left a fortune of 500 billion to his children...</p>

    <p>Someone simply did the math.</p>

    <p>What is the concept of 500 billion assets?</p>

    <p>Assuming that a person can live to be 100 years old, then this person will have to spend about 13.69 million yuan every day from birth until death... before this money can be completely consumed.</p>

    <p>Is this the life of rich people?</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling's current life is dull and not poor. He can afford Father Wang's meager royalties, but he is not to the point of squandering tens of billions...</p>

    <p>"If you want to live a rich life, you can get married." Wang Ying crossed his arms and leaned against the door with a smile.</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling still glanced at Wang Ying with a dead look on his face.</p>

    <p>It is impossible to marry into the family.</p>

    <p>Money or not. In fact, it has little impact on Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Anyway, Wang Ling only needs to have enough money to buy crispy noodles.</p>

    <p>Things like money.</p>

    <p>If you don't bring it with you in life, you won't take it with you in death. From Wang Ling's point of view, it doesn't make any sense.</p>

    <p>But sometimes it's quite interesting to have an illusion.</p>

    <p>For example, Wang Ling remembers fantasizing about it when he was a child.</p>

    <p>If everyone in the world transfers a dime to him, will he become the richest person in the world?</p>

    <p>"Your Majesty, is this the only way you feel about this 20 billion?" Wang Ying looked at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked expressionless. He actually didn't quite understand what Wang Ying meant. But he knew that there was obviously something behind his words.</p>

    <p>"She did it all for..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying opened his mouth. He was halfway through speaking, but in the end he couldn't continue.</p>

    <p>He knows that regarding emotional matters, as long as the sealed Talisman still exists, his family's leader will always be like this... At this stage, this is something that is difficult to change.</p>

    <p>We can only wait until one day when Wang Ling can truly control the power. Maybe it will be understandable...</p>

    <p>But when that time comes, maybe the emotions that have been suppressed in my heart will burst out in an instant like a blowout.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying touched his chin and thought about what might happen in the future.</p>

    <p>I suddenly felt more curious.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After sending Shou Chong off smoothly, Sun Rong began to complete the homework assigned by the school.</p>

    <p>A few days ago, because of the collection of Rubik's cubes, the girl got up early to make up the homework.</p>

    <p>But there is no need for it now. The subsequent collection of Rubik's Cubes has been suspended because it is said to be very risky.</p>

    <p>So. Is Wang Ling actually still thinking about her?</p>

    <p>Thinking of this. Sun Rong feels very good.</p>

    <p>She sorted out her evening homework and opened her pencil case.</p>

    <p>Although there are many papers, these exercises are not difficult for young girls. If you are determined, you can finish one in 10 minutes.</p>

    <p>Many multiple-choice questions have almost formed directional thinking under the teacher's question-sea tactics. After doing it too much... there is no need to review the questions at all. You can know where the answer is by just looking at the options.</p>

    <p>Her fingers were reaching for the pen in her pencil case. A white rabbit toffee suddenly caught the girl's attention.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was immediately stunned: "?"</p>

    <p>Why is there candy in her pencil case...</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er was behind with a look of watching a drama. She resisted the urge not to spoil the story. She was observing the girl's reaction when she saw the candy.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the girl picked up the White Rabbit toffee, put it in front of her nose and smelled it carefully: "This candy... seems to have the smell of classmate Wang Ling on it..."</p>

    <p>"I'll be damned! You can smell it!" Sun Ying'er was shocked.</p>

    <p>"Ying'er. Did you know this early?"Sun Rong was surprised.</p>

    <p>"Yes, but seeing that you were so focused on dealing with the mistress from Jiugong, I didn't remind you. I wanted to wait for Rongrong to find out on your own. I didn't expect your sense of smell to be so strong!" Sun Ying'er was surprised.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling has... always had a very light soap smell..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong became a little shy: "And, please don't say that about Jiugong-san."</p>

    <p>"Okay. After all, it's not decided yet."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er nodded. Then he looked at Sun Rong with a curious expression: "How about it? Do you want to try it? Ling Zhenren's candy is attuned and has special effects!"</p>

    <p>"It will expire..."</p>

    <p>"Enlightened. Of course not."</p>

    <p>"Then I have to keep it."Sun Rong said with a smile.</p>

    <p>There is only one sugar.</p>

    <p>It would be a shame to just eat it like that...</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er spread his hands helplessly: "I know you can't bear it. Do you still want to insure the candy?"</p>

    <p>These words made Sun Rong's eyes light up: "Ying'er. Although you usually speak freely, you finally mentioned a great idea!"</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er: "..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong thought for a moment: "I still have some pocket money left this month. I will use the remaining pocket money to buy insurance first! I will renew the insurance coverage when I get next month's pocket money."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er: "So how much pocket money do you have per month?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "Not much. Just one billion."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er: "..."</p>
