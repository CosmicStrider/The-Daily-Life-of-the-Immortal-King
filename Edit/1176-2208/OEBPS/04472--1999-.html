  <h1>Chapter 1999 The new dean</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Sunday, January 19th. Number 60 High School was not quiet on that day. This was because it was the date appointed by Principal Dai Tianchun of Shengke High School.</p>

    <p>For this reason, Monk Jin Deng had already made preparations and came to school early in the morning.</p>

    <p>Of course, except for Monk Jin Deng, there were also many teachers gathered at Number 60 High School on this day. Most of them did not come to join in the fun intentionally. Instead, they gathered to discuss the preparation for the next week's lessons.</p>

    <p>Since the implementation of the double reduction policy, the pressure on students seems to have decreased but not all... The pressure on teachers has increased day by day.</p>

    <p>Because it is necessary to reduce the burden of homework at home, most teaching tasks can only be completed in school through reasonable lesson preparation and time arrangements.</p>

    <p>The reason why they chose to gather at school on Sunday was mainly because the teachers wanted a good discussion atmosphere, just like studying together in the library of cultivation University.</p>

    <p>"Thunder Sword Technique has been taught in the Spirit Sword Class. However, the students who have reached proficiency can be counted on their fingers. This semester, all those who have reached the mid-term level of Foundation Building must reach proficiency in the use of Thunder Sword Technique. So I hope that next week's physical arts class can give way to the spiritual sword class."</p>

    <p>"I understand that the teachers in the spiritual sword class are under pressure. But it is also important to learn mathematics well. If you are not good at mathematics, you will not be able to accurately estimate the spiritual energy consumption between the enemy and ourselves during battle. Even when throwing spells. Because you haven't learned the parabola well, your accuracy will be reduced. Give us the physical arts class next week."</p>

    <p>"Mathematics is of course important, but practice makes perfect. As long as you practice more, it will come naturally. I think it's better to leave it to our ancient language class. Some advanced Talisman formulas are combined with ancient cultivation language. The physical arts class should also be given to us, the most difficult subject."</p>

    <p>"Teachers... please don't ignore us, okay?"</p>

    <p>The teachers of the physical education group, represented by Teacher Ye, had a look of helplessness on their faces: "This..how can this be done? I've been doing it for several periods. You said the same thing to me last time. Yes. I'm a physical education teacher who teaches physical skills. I can't always do well in every class. Now there are rumors on campus that I have kidney deficiency!"</p>

    <p>"Then what can be done? The scores in various cultural classes need to be improved. Now we no longer allow all written assignments to be taken home. We can only keep some simple ones. But with that kind of intensity, students who are unconscious will not be able to remember them at all."</p>

    <p>A teacher sighed and felt very sad at the same time: "I believe that all teachers have also received private messages and chat records from some parents... asking us to help their children with voluntary make-up lessons."</p>

    <p>"Yes, yes, yes. I received it too! I'm as good as a horse in class and after school. I even left various answers to overtime work after school. Where do you have all the time?"</p>

    <p>"Don't make any noise, everyone..."</p>

    <p>At this time, Teacher Pan's words immediately caused the teachers present to fall into silence.</p>

    <p>She cleared her throat, pushed up her gold-rimmed glasses and said, "Actually, I can understand everyone's feelings. We are all here for the students."</p>

    <p>"Which teacher doesn't treat their students as their own children? Even those whose grades are not up to par. When their grades are not good, we feel uncomfortable, right?"</p>

    <p>"As teachers at Number 60 High School, we still need to be united as one. We cannot fight among ourselves."</p>

    <p>"Teacher Pan's words are good. But this class only lasts so long... We are all in a dilemma." A teacher in the alchemy class said.</p>

    <p>"I think there will be a solution soon."</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan said: "You must have heard about it. Today is not only the appointment day between Principal Dai from Shengke and Huo Ding, the vice principal of Number 60 High School, but we will also have one from Number 60 High School. The new dean."</p>

    <p>"Dean of Education? Shouldn't this be Teacher Wang Zukang's position?"</p>

    <p>"Teacher Wang is from the Academic Affairs Department. The new dean is from the Coordination Department. His position and rank are equivalent to Teacher Wang. I heard that Principal Chen also specially recruited the new dean in order to cope with the double reduction. Teacher, the purpose of coming to our Number 60 High School is to help us arrange our class time reasonably," Teacher Pan said.</p>

    <p>"That's good." Teacher Ye immediately grinned and said, "If there is someone who can make the decision, then I think everyone has no opinion?"</p>

    <p>Teacher of the Spirit Sword Team: "Hey. Can you apply to this new teaching director of the Coordination Department to take up the physical arts class?"</p>

    <p>Alchemy group teacher: "What a great idea! This will increase our class time!"</p>

    <p>Talisman group teacher: "Isn't it a bit rude to occupy it? I think we can just cancel it."</p>

    <p>Teacher of the weapon refining group: "Wonderful, wonderful. I think that's it!"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Teacher Ye almost knelt down: "Dear teachers... our physical arts team has always had no enmity with all the teachers. Why are you trying to steal our jobs?"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Number 60 High School. Office of the Vice Principal.</p>

    <p>Since Jin Deng was qualified for the position of vice principal, he has devoted himself to the teaching work of Number 60 High School. The reason why he came early today was not entirely for this appointment. The newly appointed dean is here.</p>

    <p>From the moment when the hour and second hands of the wall clock accurately overlapped and pointed to eight o'clock, a girl wearing a Taoist uniform and holding a pink floating dust stepped in on time with a warm smile on her face: "Hello, Vice Principal Huo. My name is You Yueqing. I was invited by Principal Chen to apply for the position of dean of the department."</p>

    <p>Jin Deng stood up quickly. His eyes were calm, and he shook hands with the girl who still had a childish look on her face: "Thank you for your hard work, Teacher You, who came from afar. But I didn't expect that Teacher You would be so young. You look no different from the students."</p>

    <p>"A cultivator shouldn't judge the conduct by their appearance. Shouldn't he?"</p>

    <p>You Yueqing showed her signature smile. Then she looked at Jin Deng: "Excuse me, should I call you Vice Principal Huo. Or... Senior Jin Deng?"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Jin Deng's eyes suddenly lit up.</p>

    <p>Even Principal Chen didn't know his true identity. He didn't expect that he would be discovered by the new dean.</p>

    <p>All I can say is that this new teacher You does have something.</p>

    <p>The monk is also a person who is used to seeing big scenes. He should not be frightened by You Yueqing's words.</p>

    <p>On the contrary, he was extremely calm. While making tea for You Yueqing, he asked: "Then, is Taoist You's visit this time also for Ling Zhenren?"</p>

    <p>In one sentence, the purpose of You Yueqing joining Number 60 High School is clearly exposed.</p>

    <p>The monk knows very well that this little female Taoist priest knows his identity. She must have specially investigated it or used some divination method to calculate it.</p>

    <p>Given the monk's current state, it's still clear whether he has been counted against or not.</p>

    <p>So the monk immediately retaliated with tooth and gave You Yueqing a calculation. And he didn't use any props. He knew You Yueqing's identity just by calculating with his fingers.</p>

    <p>As for the purpose, it's hard to say...</p>

    <p>The monk only counts Tao. You Yueqing knows Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Buddhism and Taoism are one family. Senior, you don't need to be so wary of me. Don't worry. Wang Ling and I have known each other for a long time. I have no intention of exposing his secrets. I am here for other purposes." You Yueqing laughed and replied calmly.</p>

    <p>The monk raised his eyebrows. He was slightly different from You Yueqing's calm attitude.</p>

    <p>Although this little girl is not very old, her old-fashioned tone is a bit like a battle between experts...</p>
