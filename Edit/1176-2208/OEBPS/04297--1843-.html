  <h1>Chapter 1843: Retreat to advanceÂ·You Yueqing</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was late at night. When Wang Ling faced this wall that was difficult for ordinary people to see and full of obscure runes, he immediately knew that this matter was no longer something that Sun Rong or You Yueqing could solve.</p>

    <p>Once he continues to lead them to investigate further, they will inevitably run into danger. Even if he has strengthened Sun Rong at this point, these Eternals hiding behind are very cunning. The lack of skills and experience may make Sun Rong suffer a big loss. And experience cannot be compensated for by combat effectiveness.</p>

    <p>As for You Yueqing, there is no need to say much. Although there are many enlightened birthday gifts given by Wang Ling when she was a child, even if they were brought out to face the Eternal One, it would not be enough.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Wang Ling faced the wall and stared blankly for a moment before shaking his head. As if nothing happened, he put his hands into his school uniform's trouser pocket and started walking out of the apartment.</p>

    <p>He deliberately did not tell the two people what he saw. Instead, he kept the whole thing to himself without saying a word.</p>

    <p>As for Sun Rong and You Yueqing, the two women looked at each other and followed Wang Ling out.</p>

    <p>Out of their understanding of Wang Ling. They each have their own plans in mind.</p>

    <p>It was getting late. Then the three of them planned to disperse in front of the apartment and go home. Before leaving, You Yueqing added Wang Ling on WeChat. Then she added Sun Rong together.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong didn't refuse. She actually wanted to know more about You Yueqing, so she took out her phone and scanned the QR code.</p>

    <p>After successfully obtaining the contact information of the two of them, You Yueqing smiled brightly: "I feel like Sun Rong and I are actually very compatible! I can help you tell your fortune for free later. You can ask anything you want!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong responded with a generous smile: "Okay. Then I'm welcome. Thank you, Daoist Master You."</p>

    <p>"Just call me Xiaoqing. Don't be so formal. If you need my help later, just contact me on WeChat."</p>

    <p>You Yueqing narrowed her eyes slightly. Then she flicked her fly whisk, got on the ivory white dragon and drove away.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling. Did you see something?"</p>

    <p>After watching You Yueqing go away, Sun Rong couldn't help but ask Wang Ling if he had just observed something in the room.</p>

    <p>This was a question she asked after getting to know Wang Ling. Although Wang Ling had said calmly in the apartment that nothing was abnormal, Sun Rong could still sense something was wrong.</p>

    <p>And she believed that You Yueqing also felt this way. It's just that You Yueqing left in order to retreat.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong felt that she could not see through You Yueqing more and more.</p>

    <p>However, after asking this question, Sun Rong saw Wang Ling staring at her intently for a while. Finally, he shook his head no.</p>

    <p>He waved goodbye to Sun Rong, signaling her to go back early.</p>

    <p>After waiting in the dark for a while, after confirming that Sun Rong left the apartment, Wang Ling reappeared from the hidden corner of the street. Returned to the room and faced the weird white wall again.</p>

    <p>He operated King's Eyes. He dispelled the pure white mist on the white wall and re-exposed the mysterious runes hidden behind it.</p>

    <p>After doing all this, he sat cross-legged on the ground and used his pupil power to directly summon three eternal beings with royal blood who were previously sealed in the "pupil universe."</p>

    <p>The skeleton prince of the undead, the lion-headed man of the Eternal Lion Clan, and the princess Meng Liuli of the Dream Clan.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling originally wanted to tell Monk Jin Deng, Li Xian and Zhang Zhui to be present. But that seemed a bit too alarming. Now the three of them are also important elders of the Office of Strategic Deception. They go out to do things. Almost the entire Office Everyone in Strategic Deception knows this. It would be bad if word spread.</p>

    <p>That's why Wang Ling summoned the three Royal Eternals previously prepared in King's Eyes. He planned to listen to their opinions.</p>

    <p>Since being defeated one by one by Wang Ling in Glio City, the three royal Eternals have lost all temper. And they also know that the Saints have successfully compromised with Wang Ling and have all their contracts transferred to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The key is that what makes them even more unbelievable is that Wang Ling doesn't care about the constraints of these contracts at all. After getting it, he burned the contracts with the eternal fire of King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>This means that he is no longer worried that they will escape at all... on the other hand, it also shows that he are fully confident in his own strength.</p>

    <p>Now. The Skeleton Prince, the Lion-headed Man and Meng Liuli are all looking forward to the promise of the "Eternal Utopia" that Wang Ling will fulfill for them.</p>

    <p>Unbound by any contract, they finally found the feeling of freedom and respect.</p>

    <p>As for Wang Ling, he has become their "new boss." Even if they don't sign a labor contract, they are willing to stay with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Until Wang Ling summoned them, the somewhat literary Skeleton Prince was still drafting the composition {Wang Ling. My Superman!}</p>

    <p>But now, when they saw the obscure runes on the white wall in front of them, the three of them looked at each other, and their expressions immediately became serious.</p>

    <p>"This is... I remember seeing this kind of mysterious rune when a certain clan was at war." The Skeleton Prince immediately frowned. He thought of something that happened a long time ago. But that time was too long ago. It goes back a long time. When he was little.</p>

    <p>The lifespan of the undead is infinite. It can be traced back to when he was a child. The time span is even more terrifying.</p>

    <p>Because when he was a child, the Old Dominator still existed. But it was at the end of the old days. It was far less glorious than it was in its heyday.</p>

    <p>"Well, there are a few suspicious Eternal-level forces who are good at using this mysterious writing formula to create formations and secret techniques." The lion-headed man scratched his head and replied.</p>

    <p>"It's a long time ago. But given some time, we should be able to confirm it." At this time, Meng Liuli continued: "As long as I retrieve the dream, it will be fine. This is the unique ability of the Dream Clan. All the dreams that have been invaded by the Dream Clan. Recorded, and can be gathered into a huge dream network and stored in the mental space for sharing. As long as I confirm the approximate time range and perform precise retrieval, the results will be available soon."</p>

    <p>With that said, she sat down directly cross-legged and started working without saying anything. It was extremely efficient. It made Wang Ling very satisfied.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, after Sun Rong arrived home, the head maid named Qiu came over immediately: "Miss, you are back. You have a friend waiting for you in the living room."</p>

    <p>"Friend?" Sun Rong was stunned in her heart. She followed the head maid over with a suspicious look on her face.</p>

    <p>When she came to the living room, she saw a familiar snow-white figure appearing in front of her.</p>

    <p>That person is no one else.</p>

    <p>It was You Yueqing.</p>

    <p>"We meet again. Classmate Sun Rong." You Yueqing was not polite. She immediately stood up from the sofa and looked at her with a smile. She seemed to be anti-customer.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong took a deep breath. She never expected that You Yueqing would retreat directly to her home from the door of the apartment.</p>

    <p>What kind of performance is this...</p>

    <p>"It's already very late. Is there something wrong, Mr. You?" Sun Rong asked trying to maintain her composure.</p>

    <p>"I just have a few questions. A little curious."</p>

    <p>You Yueqing touched her chin. She looked at Sun Rong carefully. Then she walked slowly over, getting closer and closer. Looking at Sun Rong, she couldn't help but smile and said, "I actually want to ask. Do you like Wang Ling?"</p>
