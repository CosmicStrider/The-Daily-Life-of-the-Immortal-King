  <h1>Chapter 2143 2 humanoid plug-ins</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: This is the game world. It is normal for two level 1 novice players carrying huge amounts of cash to walk on a crowded map and arouse the covetousness of many people.</p>

    <p>But two players who are only level 1 are faced with a total of ten players who are ahead of them in level siege. They keep claiming that they have surrounded ten people in turn. This is a bit outrageous!</p>

    <p>The leaders would never believe that Qin Zhong would say such arrogant remarks in front of them.</p>

    <p>"The person with the lowest level here is also level 6. Do you know what this means?" The leader smiled. He was not a mechanic. He was an immortal sword with a level 12 level. Apparently he came from other maps. Came here.</p>

    <p>The ten people here formed a small team with him as the leader. During the novice period, find a big brother with familiarity and experience to take the lead. This can avoid many detours.</p>

    <p>Therefore, in this ten-person team, it is not surprising at all that such a level 12 sword immortal player appears. However, the opponent is not taking action at the moment. Qin Zhong cannot yet tell what genre the opponent is from.</p>

    <p>In the game world of Itinerant Immortal, there are only ten main professions. But each profession is actually divided into many different ways of playing.</p>

    <p>For example, take the profession Sword Immortal. There is a fast-attack Sword Immortal that focuses on agility. It focuses on attack speed and movement speed. It depends on the character's sensitivity.</p>

    <p>There is also the violent sword Immortal. As the name suggests, all attribute points are added to strength. The equipment and the equipment are all equipped with attribute points that add strength. This can ensure the maximum output. Moreover, when adding strength, it also has an impact on blood volume and energy. The weight-bearing capacity has been improved to some extent. It is very suitable for collecting materials as a part-time worker in the early stage.</p>

    <p>"You're only level 12. I don't think it's very high." Qin Zhong shrugged and smiled helplessly.</p>

    <p>He really wasn't afraid at all.</p>

    <p>Just as this Sword Immortal player said, in their team of ten, the one with the lowest level is five levels ahead of them.</p>

    <p>This also means that even if Xiang Yi has a blue sniper rifle in his hand, if the bullet is shot without a headshot, he will kill the player at level 5. However, one shot cannot be taken away.</p>

    <p>And there are many people on the other side. They can give each other supplements and milk each other. This forms an endless cycle.</p>

    <p>Therefore, although Qin Zhong boasts that he will kill all ten people in Haikou, he still needs to pay attention to some tactical thinking.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, in this team of ten people, only this level 12 player is an immortal sword. The rest are just mechanics. So as long as he can grasp the method of this sword immortal, he will have confidence in his heart.</p>

    <p>"You have two million with you now. Let's do this. I'm not unkind. You keep one hundred thousand and give the rest to us. I can be more peaceful and won't do anything to you."</p>

    <p>The player of this sword immortal said while the other hand had already put his hand on the hilt of the sword: "Of course. If you don't obey me... don't blame me for being rude..."</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the spiritual sword in his hand was already shining faintly. He didn't take action first simply because he was afraid of the mechanical eye. Although there were no other buildings in the building, if the fighting was too loud and they didn't escape in time, they would still be attracted in the end. Mechanical Eye. Increase crime star rating.</p>

    <p>If you can rely on negotiation and some skill to win the money, why not?</p>

    <p>This sword immortal player is a seasoned player. He won't attack first. But he can intimidate.</p>

    <p>For example, right now...</p>

    <p>He used</p>

    <p>--Sealing Spirit Sword Technique!</p>

    <p>A ray of blue sword light flashed past the eyes of Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi. Finally, it converged into a blue Bagua Seal and fell from above their heads.</p>

    <p>"It turns out to be the immortal sword..." Xiang Yi suddenly realized when he saw this.</p>

    <p>This is a popular genre in the Itinerant Immortal magic circle. The feudal sword immortal is just as the name suggests. It is a sword immortal that does not follow the conventional route. The attack and speed are not as fast as the traditional sword immortal route. The attribute distribution is usually 4 wisdom 1 A lucky match. Or 5 wisdom.</p>

    <p>This is an auxiliary type of faction, but it is very popular. As long as there are teammates who cooperate, it is a radiant profession.</p>

    <p>Now Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi understand why this level 12 sword immortal came to the Machinery City to find 9 players to be his younger brothers. He is responsible for sealing. So as mechanics, the nine younger brothers only need to take advantage of their opponents to be sealed. Just focus your fire and shoot. Simple and crude. Foolproof.</p>

    <p>But this is only if the seal can hit...</p>

    <p>The sealing mechanism in the Itinerant Immortal magic ring. In addition to the bonuses brought by the player's own attribute points and skill proficiency, the level difference is also the key. The higher the level difference of players. The sealing rate of high-level players against low-level players There will also be some improvement.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi were defeated as soon as this Spirit-Sealing Sword Technique was used.</p>

    <p>It turns out that the immortal sword is not a traditional sword that specializes in strength and agility...</p>

    <p>It's actually a seal type!</p>

    <p>Xiang Yi covered his face. They all felt pity for this sword immortal player. You are playing with a koi to seal... Then this is not a proper act of seeking death...</p>

    <p>So, it was no surprise at all. When the sealing disk fell from the sky and was about to approach Qin Zhong's head, a string of miss light effects immediately appeared on Qin Zhong's head.</p>

    <p>This means. This level 12 sword is immortal. Its seal did not hit.</p>

    <p>"You seem to have good luck today. This didn't seal you." Players of this sword immortal were also surprised. There is a chance of failure in sealing. With his skill proficiency and attribute points. In addition, with Qin Zhong, Xiang Yi's level difference. The hit rate of the seal will be 65%</p>

    <p>Once hit, Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi will not be able to leave the coordinate point for the next 30 seconds, and will not be able to use any skills.</p>

    <p>So seeing that his first shot didn't hit, the sword immortal player immediately became more energetic. This time he fired four shots in a row. He directly summoned four sealing disks and put them on Qin Zhong.</p>

    <p>Four magic disks. The probability is 65%. There is always one that can hit!</p>

    <p>The result was still far beyond the expectations of this Sword Immortal player. Because after four consecutive attempts, they were all misses!</p>

    <p>"What the hell...what the hell!" players of this sword immortal are wondering.</p>

    <p>The next second, there was a bang!</p>

    <p>The sound of a sniper rifle shot penetrated the ears of everyone here. Along with the harsh gunshot, a level 9 mechanic in the ten-person player team flew directly backwards!</p>

    <p>There was a bullet hole between his eyebrows. He was shot directly in the head!</p>

    <p>Such a tricky location. www.uukanshu.net can be called a knowing blow!</p>

    <p>Even with the astonishing level gap, the player was still severely injured. No one thought that Xiang Yi would choose to shoot at this time!</p>

    <p>This is because I didn't find a good sniper angle. Secondly, I don't have a sight multiplier... is this okay?</p>

    <p>No one has reacted yet.</p>

    <p>The result was another bang! A sniper rifle shot!</p>

    <p>The second level 8 mechanic flew out like a scarecrow. Then he turned directly into particles and disappeared in front of everyone.</p>

    <p>Two bullets. Two were taken in succession. All bullets were fired!</p>

    <p>But this time, someone noticed Xiang Yi's actions. He did not use conventional sniping techniques...</p>

    <p>"It's a blind sniper!" someone exclaimed.</p>
