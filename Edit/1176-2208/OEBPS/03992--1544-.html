  <h1>Chapter 1544 Wang Ling's performance</h1>

  <div>

    <p>To roll out sixty-three points. Even for Wang Ling, it is actually a probabilistic event. Because he often uses too much force to shake the dice directly into powder...</p>

    <p>This requires high-density and delicate operations.</p>

    <p>But now that Wang Ling has multiple seals on his body, the success rate of this precise operation has been greatly improved.</p>

    <p>For Ah Nuan's gift. Wang Ling needs the prize money from this competition.</p>

    <p>And under the current circumstances, the best result is to get more than 18 points.</p>

    <p>After all, the remaining three supporting characters don't even have names. The author of this book obviously didn't intend to include them in this story.</p>

    <p>"Houlang Sang looks very nervous. Do you really not need me to do it for you? Maybe I will roll out 17 points and you can become a member of the delegation." Ohno Dankaede smiled sinisterly.</p>

    <p>How could Wang Ling not know that this is a smile hiding a knife...</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling actually didn't take Ohno Dankaede's malicious intentions seriously.</p>

    <p>He doesn't need to argue with a child.</p>

    <p>Although he himself is just a child...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has actually been analyzed before.</p>

    <p>Due to the strict hierarchy within Jiudaohe High School, an internal circular chain of contempt was created. This move actually greatly deepened the xenophobia of Jiudaohe High School.</p>

    <p>For a local like Ohno Dankaede who was born and raised on the Island of the Sun.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is actually just a despicable foreigner.</p>

    <p>In addition, because of the ranking of Sun Island high school students, Wang Ling became a hit. It also formed a certain influence among girls.</p>

    <p>The boys in Jiudaohe treat Wang Ling with hatred to the core.</p>

    <p>Why can a student from abroad steal their limelight?</p>

    <p>He looks average. His studies are average. His height is average... Isn't it just that his face is a bit paler and he's a bit lucky? Why are he so popular with girls?</p>

    <p>Neither Ohno Dankaede nor Kongque, who was watching the theater next to me, actually thought much about this.</p>

    <p>But actually regarding the issue of height.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has something to say.</p>

    <p>He doesn't care much about height, because his body can adjust every inch of his body proportions.</p>

    <p>Besides, for a man, being tall while lying down may be more important than standing tall...</p>

    <p>"Need not."</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling shook his head.</p>

    <p>He put one hand in his trouser pocket and reached out with the other hand to touch the dice cup. He refused Ohno Dankaede's kindness.</p>

    <p>Ohno Dankaede knows.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is trapped.</p>

    <p>He actually guessed it. Wang Ling would definitely do it himself.</p>

    <p>Therefore, this dice cup and this dice are actually specially manipulated.</p>

    <p>The two items are specially made. Made of a special material. The durability is very low...</p>

    <p>When the dice cup shakes, the dice inside are constantly colliding back and forth in the dice cup.</p>

    <p>This seemingly normal collision will greatly reduce the durability of the dice...</p>

    <p>After a certain number of times, the dice will completely shatter!</p>

    <p>The reason why Ohno Dankaede kindly wants to help everyone throw dice. This is the purpose.</p>

    <p>The seven people in front, including himself, all shook the dice cup.</p>

    <p>How many times the dice collided in the dice cup. Ohno Dankaede can count them clearly.</p>

    <p>This is a special little skill of Ohno Dankaede.</p>

    <p>--Excellent feel developed through years of shaking the dice cup!</p>

    <p>Besides that. He also watched a lot of animated videos to train his ears.</p>

    <p>A 32x speed animated video. He could clearly use his ears to hear how many clicks were stuck in total. How many times did the repeated clips and audio appear?</p>

    <p>In fact, in the previous seven rounds of throwing dice, Ohno Dankaede had already pushed the durability of the dice to the limit through his precise counting.</p>

    <p>Don't talk about shaking the dice cup now.</p>

    <p>Even if it's just a slight shock, these dice will turn into powder in an instant...</p>

    <p>"Houlang Sang. Next. What are you going to do?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Ohno Dankaede crossed his arms, pretending to be watching a good show.</p>

    <p>The reason why he chose to shake the dice cup is actually because Wang Ling has the title of "Sixty Mascot."</p>

    <p>Even if it's a mascot. So what?</p>

    <p>If you are really lucky and have the ability, just roll out some points?</p>

    <p>Ohno Dankaede sneered.</p>

    <p>He has seen the outcome of this "gamble."</p>

    <p>Because from the moment Wang Ling opens the dice cup, what is waiting in front of everyone's eyes must not be points. But a pile of... snow-white powder turned from dice...</p>

    <p>In the central control room.</p>

    <p>Jisaki looked at the remote shooting of the referee ball. He felt nervous in his heart.</p>

    <p>"Houlang Sang. Is that okay?"</p>

    <p>He sighed: "You shouldn't compete with that guy Ohno! Their family just runs a casino!"</p>

    <p>On Sun Island, casinos can be operated legally with formal business licenses after approval by the department.</p>

    <p>But generally speaking, the approval conditions are very strict... Those who can open a casino at home usually have two brushes on the background.</p>

    <p>Ohno Dankaede grew up in such an environment. In addition, he often performed in various bars. Flower cards and dice are his most familiar tricks besides Sword.</p>

    <p>"I see. A special dice made of soot." On the other side, Wang Ming, who was watching, had used the electronic eye he carried with him to learn the material of the dice through remote satellite scanning.</p>

    <p>Although soot is fragile, it is a high-end pressure-reducing and shock-proof material.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming is actually no stranger.</p>

    <p>And now Ohno Dankaede will use soot to make gambling equipment...</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ming himself is not surprised.</p>

    <p>Because this was all Wang Ming's remaining tricks...</p>

    <p>Because when he was in the laboratory, he often played this trick with Zhai Yin.</p>

    <p>Than the size of the points.</p>

    <p>As long as Zhai Yin's points can be greater than his, he will take it.</p>

    <p>It turned out that because Wang Ming had tampered with the dice, Zhai Yin never won...</p>

    <p>"Brother Xiaoer, what should I do? Do you want to think of a way to help Houlang Sang?" Jisaki looked at the scene in the video and felt nervous.</p>

    <p>"No need. He must have a way." Wang Ming smiled.</p>

    <p>He felt that Jisaki was more nervous than Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>At this time, under the eyes of everyone, Wang Ling was already shaking cautiously on the table.</p>

    <p>At this moment, many people knew that something was wrong.</p>

    <p>Because inside the dice cup, when the dice cup was shaking, the crisp collision sound of the dice was not heard at all...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling just shook a little.</p>

    <p>After a muffled sound, no matter how much he shook, there was dead silence in the dice cup. There was no sound at all.</p>

    <p>"Hahaha!" Ohno Dankaede laughed: "Houlang Sang was too careless. Why did you use so much force? Did you shake the dice into powder?"</p>

    <p>"Is there... something wrong with the dice?" Hattori Zentetsu asked weakly.</p>

    <p>"I rolled the first seven times. How could there be something wrong with the dice? If there is something wrong, I have new dice. Let's not count. Let's do it again? Only this time. I don't care about you." Ohno Dankaede counted. I'm sure some people will question it. I just used a set of rhetoric prepared in advance.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, after saying this, Hattori Zentetsu in the field shrank his neck and did not dare to say any more unnecessary words...</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling sighed helplessly.</p>

    <p>He opened the dice cup in front of everyone...</p>

    <p>Indeed.</p>

    <p>The dice inside have turned into white powder.</p>

    <p>But the scene in front of him made Ohno Dankaede unable to laugh at all.</p>

    <p>Because the dice turned into powder... but the points were retained!!!</p>

    <p>He didn't know how Wang Ling managed to accurately pick out the dots on the dice...</p>

    <p>But the scene before him now was exactly this incredible scene.</p>

    <p>On the snow-white dice powder, there is a row of delicate little dots, like a series of huge ellipses. Arranged from left to right...</p>

    <p>And the number of these dots adds up.</p>

    <p>There are 126 pieces!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling not only picked out every dot!</p>

    <p>And everything was divided into two. Divided into two parts...</p>
