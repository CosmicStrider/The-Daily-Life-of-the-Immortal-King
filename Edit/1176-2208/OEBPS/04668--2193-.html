  <h1>Chapter 2193 Confession</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Looking at the group of octopus men kneeling on the ground and shivering in front of them.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong opened his mouth.</p>

    <p>In her impression, except for some short-sighted beings who tried to attack Wang Ling and were wounded to death, Wang Ling rarely killed people by themselves.</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling's shot was naturally well thought out.</p>

    <p>If the Law of Cultivation can be solved, leave it to the Law of Cultivation. If it cannot be solved, hand it to bullets. This is not considered lynching. At most, it is on the same level as Demon Slayer and Defense.</p>

    <p>This is a group of aliens who had no choice but to stay on the earth and then be exploited. They have not contacted the alien ambassador Guo Ping and established formal diplomatic relations with the earth. That is why these octopus people are actually outright gangsters.</p>

    <p>In addition, they did not want to have any more interactions with the Earth monks, so they had to do illegal work to earn the cost of repairing the spacecraft.</p>

    <p>Therefore, these Kuroto octopus people will not receive the protection of the existing earth's cultivation laws without establishing diplomatic relations with the earth.</p>

    <p>What's more. Wang Ling used the creature outline ability of King's Eyes to see clearly the crime of the octopus man in front of him.</p>

    <p>Taking action against an innocent monk from Earth. And it was a little girl with no strength to restrain herself. Such a crime is truly unforgivable.</p>

    <p>Of course. Wang Ling's purpose in firing this shot was, firstly, in the light of righteousness. Secondly, it was also to get some useful information from the mouths of these octopus men.</p>

    <p>He noticed that these octopus men were not really doing construction work. They were secretly completing the construction of the magic circle.</p>

    <p>With Wang Ling's meager knowledge, it was not difficult for him to figure out that this should be a multi-type compound array. What these octopus men built was only one part of the module.</p>

    <p>Considering the attributes of these octopus men working undercover, Wang Ling felt that this magic circle was most likely not a serious magic circle. He originally wanted to destroy it directly. But he was afraid that destroying it directly on his side might disturb those behind the scenes. people.</p>

    <p>With the shallow connections of this group of octopus people who first arrived on Earth, they are definitely not the mastermind behind the design of this modular array. There must be some culprit behind this.</p>

    <p>After taking care of an octopus man, the initial deterrence has taken effect.</p>

    <p>Many octopus men were so frightened that they fell down from their kneeling position. They were curled up. They were afraid that they would become Wang Ling's next victim.</p>

    <p>Following the markings on the outline of the creature, Wang Ling walked up to the second octopus man accurately and raised his finger gun.</p>

    <p>The second octopus man is still stubborn.</p>

    <p>It doesn't believe that Wang Ling can really see through what immoral things he has done...</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling. What crime did this octopus man commit?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"Take advantage of others' danger."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed.</p>

    <p>Said the message to Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>While a Golden Core monk was sleeping, this octopus man cut open the man's abdomen with a magic weapon and took out the Golden Core to cook and eat.</p>

    <p>"This. is too much..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong listened to all the explanations from Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Also angry.</p>

    <p>I was just about to scold this octopus man from a righteous perspective.</p>

    <p>As a result, I saw a wisp of green smoke accompanied by Wang Ling's fingertips. The octopus in front of me also returned to the underworld...</p>

    <p>This octopus man was even worse. Because the crime he committed was worse than the previous one, not even his head was left. He was directly reduced to powder.</p>

    <p>Next one.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed.</p>

    <p>Walk up to the third octopus marked by King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>The octopus man was so frightened that he burst into tears. Black ink flowed directly from his eyes. He no longer said harshly: "Excuse me online! I was wrong! I was obsessed. I joined a phone fraud organization when I first came to Earth." ..I have defrauded dozens of families...I also know that several of them chose to commit suicide because I defrauded them of all their money..."</p>

    <p>It was trembling with fear: "I will find a way to raise money. Give the money back to them... I will spend my life to atone for my sins..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling hesitated.</p>

    <p>Bang!</p>

    <p>A bullet was fired, directly breaking one of the tentacles on the octopus man's face.</p>

    <p>The octopus man came to his senses. This was Wang Ling giving himself a chance. Because he could truthfully confess his crime, he was retained.</p>

    <p>And this fingergun bullet that pierced the tentacles on his face was marking himself. It was also a warning to him.</p>

    <p>It is telling it that if it fails to fulfill its promise of atonement, it will bear the consequences.</p>

    <p>In less than half an hour, two-thirds of these octopus men were dealt with by Wang Ling. In the end, only a dozen scattered octopus men were left, including the boss octopus man.</p>

    <p>The rest of the octopus men were all dealt with by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>There were so many black alien corpses. Wang Ling felt that it would be troublesome to deal with them, so he took photos of the scene and sent them back to Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi understood instantly. Called Wang Ling: "Master, don't worry. Disciple already knows how to deal with it. You will examine the living octopus first. Disciple will bring people over now. As for the media On. I will claim to the outside world that it is because these Kurodo Octopus people are extremely vicious and too dangerous. I killed them all out of self-defense."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling communicated with Zhuo Yi on speakerphone. What Zhuo Yi said was also heard by Sun Rong and the remaining octopus people.</p>

    <p>The corners of the mouths of these octopus men who had been taken away twitched when they heard this.</p>

    <p>Listen...</p>

    <p>Is this human language?</p>

    <p>Extremely vicious...too dangerous...</p>

    <p>They were obviously tied up and imprisoned. They had absolutely no strength left to resist...</p>

    <p>It is also outrageous that it can be attributed to self-defense.</p>

    <p>As the octopus boss, the octopus boss was as clear as a mirror at this time. He knew that this time he was stepping on the iron plate.</p>

    <p>It has long known the rumors about this city hero Zhuo Yi. It has even heard that there is a mysterious master behind it... but it never expected that this person would be so young...</p>

    <p>The octopus man thought about it and was horrified. The sweat on his face could no longer be stopped. Such things should be kept confidential. But the young man actually deliberately left his cell phone on speakerphone?</p>

    <p>This is tantamount to telling it. It doesn't matter whether it knows the secret or not.</p>

    <p>Because maybe... they won't be able to leave alive today...</p>
