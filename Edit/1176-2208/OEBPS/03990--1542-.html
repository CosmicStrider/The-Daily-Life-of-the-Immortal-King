  <h1>Chapter 1542 Beat up my teammates</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Although it is already early morning on Friday, December 18th.</p>

    <p>However, Jiudaohe still chose to hold the game overnight in order to select a five-member delegation as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>It's actually not a big deal if a cultivator himself "cultivates immortal" without sleeping for several months.</p>

    <p>At most, it's just a bald head.</p>

    <p>For ordinary people, staying up late is still not possible.</p>

    <p>It can cause kidney deficiency, night sweats, fatigue, poor mental state, memory loss, and other problems... (What are you looking at? I'm talking about you!)</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Sun Rong were waiting in the waiting room. Matsushita Singha beside them was very attentive.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Liangzi, are you hungry? Do you want a midnight snack?"</p>

    <p>"Supper... night?" Sun Rong was stunned.</p>

    <p>Losing weight is a girl's lifelong career.</p>

    <p>And something as evil as late-night snacks has always been the natural enemy of girls.</p>

    <p>The main reason is that Sun Rong himself is convinced. Wang Ling doesn't like that kind of voluptuous girl. So it is very important to maintain a good figure!</p>

    <p>Of course, sometimes Sun Rong also hopes that his fat content can increase a little, but his basic figure can remain the same.</p>

    <p>Let the fat go where it needs to go...</p>

    <p>Maybe it's what every girl wants to do, right?</p>

    <p>Sun Rong thought so in his heart.</p>

    <p>In fact, so far, she is quite satisfied with her situation.</p>

    <p>At least when compared with Jiugong Liangzi, it suddenly seems quite heavy...</p>

    <p>"Yes! I know there is a 24-hour fried fish ball shop next to the school. It's really delicious! And it's filled with papaya cheese!"</p>

    <p>"No need, Matsushita Singha-san..." Sun Rong refused.</p>

    <p>"Okay. I'm going to prepare a midnight snack! Liangzi, please don't be polite to me." Matsushita Singha smiled. Her expression was really like looking at a lover.</p>

    <p>As she said that, she quickly took out her mobile phone, as if calling some servant to help her buy it.</p>

    <p>In fact, just a few minutes ago, Wang Ming just sent Matsushita Singha's information to Sun Rong and Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>They know now. The Matsushita Singha in front of them is also a eldest lady.</p>

    <p>Although he is the second eldest child in the family, he is deeply loved by the head of the Matsushita family.</p>

    <p>And currently, Panasonic and Jiugong are still in a competitive relationship.</p>

    <p>After knowing the news.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong support amount.</p>

    <p>Suddenly I felt like the sky was completely dark when I looked up at the stars.</p>

    <p>What has she done!</p>

    <p>He actually helped classmate "Jiugong Liangzi" conquer the second lady of a rival family...</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Rong's mood was extremely complicated. She tried her best to show her resistance.</p>

    <p>Mainly I want to tell Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>I am actually not from that group.</p>

    <p>She puts the overall situation first, not Big Orange!</p>

    <p>At this time, Matsushita Singha, who was giving her a headache, came over again and looked at her with a doting look on her face: "Classmate Liangzi, are you thirsty... Do you want me to order some milk tea?"</p>

    <p>This time, Sun Rong suddenly became cautious in his answer.</p>

    <p>If you refuse again at this time...</p>

    <p>She felt that Matsushita Singha would do the opposite again.</p>

    <p>So why not just agree to give it a try?</p>

    <p>So. Sun Rong imitated Jiugong Liangzi's tone and said: "Then... I just want a small cup."</p>

    <p>As a result, Matsushita Singha became even more excited: "Ah! Classmate Liangzi! You actually agreed to me frankly! I knew it! My efforts will definitely be reciprocated!"</p>

    <p>"..." Sun Rong was speechless for a moment.</p>

    <p>Then, she saw Matsushita Singha take out her mobile phone again and start calling her maid.</p>

    <p>"Yes! It's me again! Now I want you to go to the nearest pasture to select cows! Yes! It's best to bring the cows directly to school. Liangzi wants to drink milk tea!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"That's right! In addition to cows, please hire me a milk tea master! It must be the best! It doesn't matter how expensive it is!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"What? Can't find Master? What do you do for food? Don't we have so many service-oriented electronic spirit beasts in our family? I remember, don't we all have the owner information of the electronic spirit beasts?"</p>

    <p>Matsushita Singha said: "Yes! What I mean is to let you remotely access the electronic spirit beast. Let the spirit beast tie the master who makes milk tea to me here."</p>

    <p>"Classmate Matsushita Singha. I'd better not drink this milk tea..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong is really scared.</p>

    <p>Even she had never heard of this way of drinking milk tea.</p>

    <p>It's too hardcore!</p>

    <p>"Don't be polite to me, Liangzi-chan! We will become a family that loves each other from now on! Chew!" Matsushita Singha said cutely.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>About half an hour passed. With all the players in place.</p>

    <p>The final 16-person group competition will begin soon.</p>

    <p>This is already the final battle.</p>

    <p>Jisaki announced the competition rules directly through the central broadcast room.</p>

    <p>The next game will be divided into two groups. There will be an 8V8 brawl.</p>

    <p>The entire process is still conducted using a points system.</p>

    <p>Among the winning side, the five people with the highest contribution points are the members of the five-person delegation this time.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling and Sun Rong are assigned to the red edge.</p>

    <p>Most of the people in the same team Wang Ling are not familiar with him. The only one who is familiar with him is the rather annoying Kongque.</p>

    <p>And Matsushita Singha. was assigned to the blue side.</p>

    <p>This made Sun Rong feel slightly relieved.</p>

    <p>Next, as long as they win the game, there will be no interference from Matsushita Singha in subsequent games.</p>

    <p>In the blink of an eye, Sun Rong was on the opposite side of Matsushita Singha. Wang Ling originally thought that Matsushita Singha would be in a very bad mood.</p>

    <p>The result is just the opposite.</p>

    <p>She looked actually very happy.</p>

    <p>Even on the stage. She held her face. She looks at Sun Rong with a mesmerized face: "Ah! I knew Liangzi and I wouldn't be on the same team! I'm on the blue team. You' re on the red team! Isn't there a saying. Red and blue have always been a couple?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong took a deep breath and asked curiously: "What if you and I are assigned to the same team?"</p>

    <p>"Then we are a match made in heaven!" Matsushita Singha smiled.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong couldn't help but shuddered after listening.</p>

    <p>Youdao means that one thing descends from another.</p>

    <p>Until today. Sun Rong seems to have finally discovered the biggest nemesis in his life...</p>

    <p>"Goo!"</p>

    <p>As the game begins, the warning sounds.</p>

    <p>In the gymnasium of Jiudaohe High School, the competition officially entered.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked forward to it seriously.</p>

    <p>Although he has reattached the disposable Talisman that he had peeled off before, he still has to control his strength carefully. The most feared thing in a mess is bumps and bumps.</p>

    <p>It's not that Wang Ling is afraid of hurting himself.</p>

    <p>But I will kill someone else if I am not careful...</p>

    <p>"Kyuubi Mode!"</p>

    <p>With a shout from Matsushita Singha, the girl quickly divided her hair into nine ponytails.</p>

    <p>Under the stimulation of the acupuncture points on the scalp, Matsushita Singha's aura surged! Her combat power soared!</p>

    <p>"As expected of the blue team's main fighting force. Unexpectedly, Matsushita Singha was so serious from the beginning. It seems that she really wants to compete on behalf of the school." In the central control room, Jisaki watched in amazement.</p>

    <p>Because he rarely sees it.</p>

    <p>Matsushita Singha is in "Nine-Tails Mode."</p>

    <p>And this scene also made Sun Rong frown slightly.</p>

    <p>Everyone thought that this would be a fierce battle.</p>

    <p>However, what was beyond everyone's expectation was.</p>

    <p>This started only a minute later.</p>

    <p>Blue. A series of screams came...</p>

    <p>"Matsushita Singha-san. What are you doing! I am your teammate!"</p>

    <p>"I know!"</p>

    <p>"I'm your teammate! You won't get points if you hit me! And we will all get points deducted!"</p>

    <p>"I know! It's you I'm hitting!"</p>

    <p>All I saw was a huge gymnasium.</p>

    <p>Matsushita Singha is like a little leopard. One person is chasing the other seven people on the blue side.</p>

    <p>While running, he shouted: "Liangzi-chan is going to participate in the competition! I guarantee it!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, Sun Rong: "..."</p>
