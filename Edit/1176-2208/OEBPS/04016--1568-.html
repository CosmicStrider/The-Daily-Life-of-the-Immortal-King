  <h1>Chapter 1568 So I temporarily closed your eyes</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When Yonekura Eaki woke up, he found himself in the infirmary.</p>

    <p>He took out his cell phone and looked at his face through the reflection on the screen. The face that should have been bloated by being slapped has completely recovered.</p>

    <p>There was no pain, no internal injuries. It was as if I had never participated in this game.</p>

    <p>He could no longer remember how he fell.</p>

    <p>He just felt that at the moment his eyes met those of Wang Ling, a huge emptiness and loneliness disturbed his spirit, causing his thoughts to stagnate.</p>

    <p>Then, Yonekura Weiaki just closed his eyes.</p>

    <p>A duel. Like a dream...</p>

    <p>"Classmate, are you awake?" The old lady in the infirmary at the competition venue glanced at Yonekura Weiming.</p>

    <p>"Doctor... my injury..."</p>

    <p>"You passed out during the game. There was no external injury at all when it was delivered. However, it is not yet possible to determine the extent of your internal injuries. How is it? Is there any discomfort?"</p>

    <p>"no..."</p>

    <p>Yonekura Weiming was extremely surprised.</p>

    <p>His body was no longer injured when he was brought here?</p>

    <p>Logically speaking, judging from the intensity with which he attacked himself, it shouldn't be possible for him to recover so quickly.</p>

    <p>"So. Did Houlang Sang do something?"</p>

    <p>Yonekura Weiming was confused.</p>

    <p>"Classmate, if you are not feeling unwell, I would like to ask you to give up your bed... There are students waiting in line for treatment behind me."</p>

    <p>"Where is the game going?" Yonekura Weiming was even more confused.</p>

    <p>"Now there are 125 people. We will select 25 people for the main battle."</p>

    <p>"Has the main battle started yet?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. It is said that the winner is determined through a mental competition. The classmate you fought with earlier is one of the twenty-five champions." The doctor said.</p>

    <p>Yonekura Weiming understood.</p>

    <p>He has heard of this Champion Station before. The 25 champions drawn out are equivalent to the defenders. As long as they can defend the mental attacks of five random people, they will advance directly.</p>

    <p>As for the attacker, as long as the attack is successful, he can become the new champion. After becoming the new champion, he can still advance by defending the attack of four people.</p>

    <p>According to the rules of this closed-door competition, there are only 50 promotion places in this round.</p>

    <p>In other words, the 50 people with the highest priority will advance to the next round.</p>

    <p>"How is the situation at Houlang Sang..."</p>

    <p>"Closed game. How do I know?" The doctor sighed.</p>

    <p>As he spoke, he pointed in the direction of the door.</p>

    <p>Yonekura Weiming was stunned for a moment. He got out of bed and walked towards the door of the infirmary.</p>

    <p>As soon as he stepped out of the door, he was shocked by the scene in front of him...</p>

    <p>Because it's in the corridor in front of the infirmary.</p>

    <p>The unconscious people were lying on the ground like sardines...</p>

    <p>"What on earth is this!?"</p>

    <p>Yonekura Weiming was like a piece of wood. He was stunned by the scene in front of him.</p>

    <p>Among these people lying down, about 90% were sent by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Because. Everyone who fights against Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Finally they closed their eyes...</p>

    <p>Successfully advanced to the tenth group stage.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's ups and downs finally settled down more than half.</p>

    <p>He didn't expect that the main stage of the competition would be decided by a mental battle...</p>

    <p>This is actually what Wang Ling is good at. Compared with physical touch, mental output is actually relatively less harmful.</p>

    <p>In addition, due to the limitation of having a one-time Talisman on him, the damage caused by the mental battle can be almost ignored.</p>

    <p>For example, in the defending phase of being the champion. Wang Ling only needs to sit upright and calculate the function in his mind.</p>

    <p>Whoever dares to invade his mental space will have his head immediately entangled with countless parabolas. Then he will freeze on the spot...</p>

    <p>According to the memories of the personnel who woke up after the battle with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Because the brain's calculations were too complicated at that time, they no longer remember what happened specifically at that time... They just felt that their minds were shrouded in large parabolas and mathematical symbols...</p>

    <p>And after waking up, they didn't even have the slightest worry about failure.</p>

    <p>Instead, I felt very guilty for not learning mathematics well.</p>

    <p>So at the competition site, some rumors spread.</p>

    <p>"Houlang Sang... an amazing man! He was actually calculating math problems during the competition..."</p>

    <p>"Houlang Sang is really a very gentle man. I heard that Akito Kurae was injured and was cured by Houlang Sang. He actually healed his own opponent."</p>

    <p>"No wonder so many people join Gray Cult. I get it! This is an amazing man!"</p>

    <p>"So is the Jiudaohe Gray Cult branch still recruiting people now? I'm pretty good at Chinese. I'm also pretty good at math."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the infinite galaxy. Originally, the monk was playing backgammon with Zheng.</p>

    <p>Before the first game of chess was played, the monk turned to use his "Swastika" to project the scene of the Wang Ling game on Earth into the void.</p>

    <p>Zheng wished that the monk would leave as soon as he finished the game with him.</p>

    <p>But what he saw in the void was the game of Wang Ling. The speed of the moves was deliberately slowed down a lot.</p>

    <p>He pretended to be thinking about the chess game seriously. It looked like he didn't care at all. In fact, he was quietly paying attention to Wang Ling's every move with his peripheral vision.</p>

    <p>"Zheng. You are indeed very dishonest."</p>

    <p>The monk couldn't help but laugh: "If you want to see it, just do it openly. I have plenty of time."</p>

    <p>Zheng frowned: "Monk. You should know who he is..."</p>

    <p>"Don't talk nonsense. The poor monk doesn't know."</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng fiddled with the beads in his hand. His eyes narrowed into slits. His expression looked extremely mysterious: "You already have the answer in your heart, don't you..."</p>

    <p>Zheng was silent for a moment, but only said three words: "Mysterious object."</p>

    <p>The monk laughed: "What a whimsical idea."</p>

    <p>Zheng took a long breath: "But apart from this, I really can't think of the origin of his power."</p>

    <p>"Destiny is still being held there. So it can't be him."</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng shook his head and said: "I once thought about many possibilities, but in the end I rejected them all. Have you seen the poor monk's pair of swastikas? It was just to test his identity. I only caught a glimpse of its outline. Then the young monk, who has the power of a thousand generations of pupils, was blinded by the swastika."</p>

    <p>"There is such a thing."</p>

    <p>Zheng. Peng Xiren, who was standing next to him, heard the words. The expression on his face was full of astonishment.</p>

    <p>They had never heard the monk mention this.</p>

    <p>"It's too exaggerated. Monk..."</p>

    <p>Although Zheng had just suffered a defeat at the hands of Wang Ling, he still didn't believe it. Wang Ling could be that powerful...</p>

    <p>I feel that the monk's remarks are a bit exaggerated.</p>

    <p>"If you don't believe it, you can try it." The monk smiled: "Now, you can enter Ling Zhenren's mind and have a look. Use your mental power to try to invade it and you will know."</p>

    <p>"What conspiracy do you have..." Zheng's expression was somewhat alert.</p>

    <p>"I'm just responding to your doubts. Practice is the truth, isn't it? If you are afraid, I will understand. After all, even I will be afraid." The monk smiled.</p>

    <p>"Heh. Just give it a try! Just try it!" Zheng snorted.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>A few seconds later...</p>

    <p>Zheng closed his eyes. And temporarily stopped thinking...</p>
