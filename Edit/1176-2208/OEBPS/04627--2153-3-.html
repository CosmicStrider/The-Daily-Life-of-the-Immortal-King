  <h1>Chapter 2153 Director Wang's performance</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: This is a result that no one expected. It is beyond the expectations of every player here. Everyone has imagined the damage value of Xiongwu's sword. It must be in the millions. Or maybe hundreds of thousands. There are also.</p>

    <p>Although I didn't expect that this sword would only hit an outrageous number of single digits. But it was a bit unacceptable that it didn't hit.</p>

    <p>When a capital letter "miss" came into everyone's eyes, and slowly disappeared above Wang Ling's head with a very silly text effect, everyone watching the game took a breath of air.</p>

    <p>This ending was something no one expected. The purple miss text was right above Wang Ling's head. But it was dazzling like a sun.</p>

    <p>However, an even more surprising scene happened immediately. After Xiongwu struck with his sword, the "General of Fuyun Town" emitted streaks of golden light from all over his body, like a bright sun directly penetrating the entire void.</p>

    <p>At this moment, for the first time, the game world of Itinerant Immortal felt like a god had descended.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's body slowly floated up. It slowly rose to the sky.</p>

    <p>He sighed softly. Although he had never thought that Xiong Wu's sword might not cause much damage to him.</p>

    <p>But it was a direct miss. He didn't expect it.</p>

    <p>And because of this "miss", Wang Ling accidentally realized the new god-level skill {{Eight Desolations and Nine Heavens Technique}} when he was sitting in the general's mansion and stacking his passive.</p>

    <p>This is also a skill programmed according to Heavenly Dao's logic. Its passive ability is automatically triggered when it avoids an attack with a damage value exceeding 100,000 points.</p>

    <p>In other words, Xiongwu's sword just now did a lot of damage. It could cut down at least 100,000 health points. For Wang Ling, it could cut off a fraction of his own health bar of 100 million. This is already It's quite an achievement.</p>

    <p>But it's a pity. Because Wang Ling's dodge value is also higher than that of other players. Coupled with the high luck attribute, this allows Wang Ling to directly avoid damage.</p>

    <p>Then. {Bahuang Jiuxiao Jue} was triggered...</p>

    <p>This is originally a life-saving magical skill. When the skill is triggered, it can maintain real time for 10 minutes.</p>

    <p>In this 10-minute state of the technique, Wang Ling will also obtain the following effects.</p>

    <p>Attack speed +200%</p>

    <p>Skill cooldown time -95%</p>

    <p>Spell consumption mana consumption -95%</p>

    <p>Each attribute value +500 points</p>

    <p>Physical resistance +75%</p>

    <p>Spell resistance +75%</p>

    <p>Negate the enemy's physical resistance +75%</p>

    <p>Negate enemy spell resistance +75%</p>

    <p>The effect of your spell with the highest mana cost will be increased by 200% after being activated.</p>

    <p>Your mount's speed +200%</p>

    <p>If there is no mount, it will be +100%</p>

    <p>Your spirit beast's loyalty will not be compromised during this period</p>

    <p>You can summon more spirit beasts than the maximum limit to fight</p>

    <p>Your spirit beast will also receive 20% of all your attribute points as a bonus</p>

    <p>During combat, the opponent's spirit beast will be weakened by the aura of this skill by 60%.</p>

    <p>All enemies cannot summon new spirit beasts</p>

    <p>All enemy attributes reduced by 20%</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling glanced at this attribute gain table, which looked like it was cheated. The whole person immediately fell into deep thought.</p>

    <p>In fact, he thinks that using the word "invincible" can directly summarize all the above content?</p>

    <p>It doesn't have to be so troublesome...</p>

    <p>But I can only say that Bai Qiao is indeed Bai Qiao. Wang Ling can be seen that these arrangements are definitely carefully designed by Bai Qiao. They are the holding attributes set based on the rationality of the game.</p>

    <p>You know, the reason why Itinerant Immortal is favored by so many players is simply because this game is fair enough.</p>

    <p>The probability of getting everything is fixed. And everyone has a chance to get it.</p>

    <p>It's just that so many outrageous god-level orange skills will appear on one person at the same time. This probability is really rare.</p>

    <p>"I believe it now. This is definitely an NPC... How can a normal player be so outrageous?" Mangshan crossed his arms with an expression as if he was watching a show. At first, he thought that the general of Fuyun Town looked like a real player pretending to be one.</p>

    <p>But now, he would rather believe that Wang Ling is an NPC. Because it is really too outrageous. Although Mangshan and Li Bai have long heard that the probability of obtaining the orange divine skill in the Itinerant Immortal magic ring is as low as dust. But once you get it, it's a qualitative leap.</p>

    <p>Xiongwu has been thinking about clearing the dungeon of Hei Long Cave so many times to open the treasure chest. Isn't it just for an orange god-level skill?</p>

    <p>As a result, the things they never see appear again and again in the same player.</p>

    <p>"Trespassers. Death."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is still standing behind his own cordon. The magic halo superimposed on his body is dazzling. Standing under the sun, he shines brightly. At this moment, he himself is the sun. It makes people feel extremely strong.</p>

    <p>Even if no action was taken, the amazing sense of oppression was still there. Many people below felt a sense of suffocation. Under this sense of oppression, they all felt that they could not breathe.</p>

    <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!...</p>

    <p>Off the field, the members of the Four Elephants riding their mounts all felt the mounts under them emit huge panic. They disappeared one by one and were frightened directly back to their psychic land. They became a group of people. A cloud of smoke.</p>

    <p>Then, those Immortal players with the Four Elephants' Sword fell uncontrollably from the sky one after another, creating a personal pit on the ground.</p>

    <p>Everything happened so suddenly.</p>

    <p>The pressure brought by the general in front of him is really suffocating.</p>

    <p>The most unbelievable thing is that the other party's... is only level 1!</p>

    <p>This is really the strongest combat against level differences.</p>

    <p>Xiongwu gritted his teeth. No matter how stubborn he was, he knew that the outcome he would face if he tried hard would definitely be a dead end. Once he died in battle, he would lose not only money, but also the hard work he had endured every day. I finally got the orange equipment in the copy.</p>

    <p>Even if it was for the sake of taking the overall situation into consideration, Xiong Wu felt that he had to calm down now and not rush forward.</p>

    <p>But as soon as he retreated, the glory of the Four Elephants no longer existed.</p>

    <p>In the days to come, the rules of this game will be completely rewritten. Those newbies who know that there is such a general guarding the city in Fuyun Town will definitely come here to do tasks and seek refuge, right?</p>

    <p>For a moment, Xiong Wu had a lot of thoughts.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling interpreted Xiong Wu's thoughts through the gods.</p>

    <p>Do you want him to protect so many players?</p>

    <p>That's really overthinking...</p>

    <p>This is just a game. Even if he is strong, www.uukanshu.net, he won't have time to take care of so many people.</p>

    <p>As for why it appeared at this time.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling glanced at Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>This is a very strange emotion. Wang Ling doesn't quite understand it. Anyway, when he saw Xiong Wu's body getting stronger and planned to step on Sun Rong, he felt some slight emotional ups and downs in his heart.</p>

    <p>Then. Wang Ling no longer hesitated and decided to take action.</p>

    <p>There is no other reason.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling just thinks Xiong Wu's behavior is very rude.</p>

    <p>"Let's go!" Xiongwu finally gritted his teeth and led his men dejectedly away from Fuyun Town.</p>

    <p>This was also the first time that Xiong Wu bowed his head. In front of so many players, especially Li Bai and Mang Shan. This made him feel that he had lost face.</p>
