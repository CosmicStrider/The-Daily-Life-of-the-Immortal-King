  <h1>Chapter 1348 Boss Mr. Sun is very satisfied with his "grandson-in-law"</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi actually regrets taking the initiative to inform Wang Zhen of the news.</p>

    <p>His original intention was to make Wang Zhen think that his mother Liu Qingyi was a "very scheming" woman, thus making Wang Zhen feel disgusted with Liu Qingyi.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, Wang Zhen was so stimulated by him. Instead, he became more energetic!</p>

    <p>He actually found a fake girlfriend to pretend to be a couple...</p>

    <p>When he heard the news, the uneasiness in Gu Shunzhi's heart became even stronger!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. Huaguo Shuilian Group Headquarters.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling As soon as they entered the aquarium, Boss Sun had already set his sights.</p>

    <p>The feedback mechanism of ID card information sent the admission information of Wang Ling to Mr. Boss Sun's mobile phone.</p>

    <p>On the other side, Jiang Xiaoche frowned: "Sir, this man really has a problem. He is a man. He went to the aquarium alone? Is there any psychological problem?"</p>

    <p>Boss Sun was obviously uncomfortable when Jiang Xiaoche said this: "Who said you can't go to the aquarium alone?"</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche: "..."</p>

    <p>"I think classmate Wang went to the aquarium today for inspection. He must have wanted to date Rongrong, so he came here early to do his homework."</p>

    <p>Today, Mr. Boss Sun's brain power is still as powerful as ever.</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche: "Is that so..."</p>

    <p>"It must be so." Boss Sun has always been very confident in his guesses.</p>

    <p>There are actually more than just Chang Yang aquariums in the city center. So why did Wang Ling choose Chang Yang?</p>

    <p>They must have come here because they knew this was an industry under their family group!</p>

    <p>It was obvious that he came here to do homework in advance for his precious granddaughter!</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche: "Even if what the master said is right. But... he invited the young lady to go to this place. The whole journey is free of charge. This is too cheap for this kid."</p>

    <p>Mr. Boss Sun rolled his eyes: "What do you know! This is called having an economic concept! Do you think your classmate Wang will be like you, arrogant and extravagant all day long? It is not easy for a 16-year-old child to have such a frugal economic concept. It should be encouraged."</p>

    <p>"..." Jiang Xiaoche finally discovered it now.</p>

    <p>Mr. Boss Sun seems to be very satisfied with his "future grandson-in-law."</p>

    <p>This directly resulted in. Everything he said was wrong.</p>

    <p>He is so difficult!</p>

    <p>However, Jiang Xiaoche feels that in this current situation, he does not have no chance at all.</p>

    <p>He grew up with Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>And I have been secretly in love with Sun Rong for a long time.</p>

    <p>How can I let someone else take advantage of a cabbage that I have watched grow up before my own eyes?</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling. Just wait! The grandson-in-law of the Sun family must be me!" Jiang Xiaoche swore secretly in his heart.</p>

    <p>He has assigned some tasks to the insiders at the aquarium. He plans to give Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>Stumbling block.</p>

    <p>In Jiang Xiaoche's opinion, since Sun Yiyuan has been blinded now, he will take a strong dose of medicine!</p>

    <p>It's better to have Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Complete. Social death.</p>

    <p>Haha^_^</p>

    <p>Today's aquarium. Unexpectedly lively.</p>

    <p>In front of the Love Pavilion. Many couples gather here.</p>

    <p>"This love house is so interesting!"</p>

    <p>"Did you see it? All the spiritual beasts in the restaurant come in pairs!"</p>

    <p>A couple said through the huge floor-to-ceiling glass wall in front of them.</p>

    <p>Many cultivators who are passionately in love even kiss naturally in such an atmosphere.</p>

    <p>This makes Wang Ling feel out of place.</p>

    <p>In front of the railing in front of the museum, Wang Ling saw many couples writing their names on red ribbons for blessing. Then they tied the red ribbons to the railing.</p>

    <p>At this time, through the glass wall, Wang Ling saw a pair of swirling sea lions making indescribable movements.</p>

    <p>I saw the male swirling sea lion lying on the female's body.</p>

    <p>Whenever someone ties a red ribbon to the railing, the male sea lion's body will squirm five to six times...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling used the map in his hand to check the information about the "Whirlling Sea Lion" in the Love Pavilion.</p>

    <p>It turns out that this swirling sea lion actually has a nickname called "Teddy in the Water."</p>

    <p>Because of their natural sensitivity to "red", male swirling sea lions have unusual reactions to red objects during mating. This can greatly increase the chances of female sea lions getting pregnant...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Really improved my knowledge...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that the amount of information in front of me is greater than when I was a child watching {{World of Spirit Beasts}.</p>

    <p>However, as a good young man with upright views, Wang Ling will not always focus on these embarrassing pictures.</p>

    <p>In contrast, what concerned him more was the presence of Wang Zhen and Fang Xing in his feminine state in the love pavilion...</p>

    <p>"It's the breeder!"</p>

    <p>As soon as Wang Zhen appeared in a staff uniform, passers-by shouted softly.</p>

    <p>At this time, Fang Xing, a female disguised as Wang Zhen's girlfriend, appeared next to Wang Zhen.</p>

    <p>She was holding a bucket. Wang Zhen was holding her waist while grabbing fresh fish pieces in the bucket and feeding them.</p>

    <p>And this scene made Wang Ling feel extremely eye-catching. It actually made many couples who didn't know the truth feel very romantic...</p>

    <p>"Oh my God! The breeder actually held his arms around his girlfriend's waist the whole time! This guy's strength is so amazing!"</p>

    <p>"Ah, it is indeed a love house! Even the breeder brought his girlfriend here! It's so sweet!"</p>

    <p>"My dear, I want to hug you too!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Separated by a thick glass wall, the two of them were talking and laughing. They seemed extremely intimate. Almost no one could hear clearly...</p>

    <p>What on earth are these young lovers talking about?</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling. could hear it clearly...</p>

    <p>The two people seemed to be smiling. In fact, they were communicating using ventriloquism.</p>

    <p>"Brother Fang, isn't it a little too early for you to act now... I think Qingyi hasn't come over yet."</p>

    <p>"You don't understand this. This is how I feel real enough. I think the atmosphere is brewing well now. I'm just waiting for Miss Liu and Gu Shunzhi to come later. We're just too old."</p>

    <p>"Open it directly?"</p>

    <p>"Borrow me a seat."</p>

    <p>"oh"</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen suddenly realized: "Why is Brother Fang so skilled..."</p>

    <p>"You've never eaten pork. Have you ever seen a pig running?" Fang Xing smiled.</p>

    <p>In fact, he has always planned to enter the entertainment industry. And whether it is a male or female form.</p>

    <p>As long as he debuts, Fang Xing believes that he can definitely become an idol.</p>

    <p>For this reason, Fang Xing actually read a lot of books about acting. Operations such as taking a seat and kissing were naturally not a problem.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>But at this time, outside the glass wall.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was once again shocked by what he heard.</p>

    <p>What the hell?</p>

    <p>Liu Qingyi and Gu Shunzhi are coming here too?!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was stunned.</p>

    <p>Why is this circuit diagram so messy today...</p>

    <p>But... no matter what the two waves of people are up to.</p>

    <p>His plan to test the spell cannot be interrupted.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Ling stared at one of the couples in the field and shook his finger.</p>

    <p>As a result, at this time, a sturdy and familiar figure suddenly jumped into Wang Ling's sight.</p>

    <p>His spell was originally aimed at passers-by.</p>

    <p>However, what Wang Ling never expected was that Liu Qingyi suddenly rushed up at this time and blocked the passerby couple...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Oh ho!</p>

    <p>Finished...</p>
