  <h1>Chapter 1943 The eyes focused on the immortal king</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling discovered that it seems that those who have the baggage of idols. People with various celebrity auras will establish an extreme personality for themselves.</p>

    <p>The invincible academic type, the family-oriented type, the noble returnee type... In recent years, Wang Ling has seen a lot of big news about celebrities in daily life who have ruined their personalities due to something. As a result, their personalities have collapsed.</p>

    <p>In a sense, this is a kind of self-deception on the psychological level of these human cultivators.</p>

    <p>After they tell lies too many times, they start to believe them. So when they have a halo around them, they will keep adding buffs to themselves to show how special they are.</p>

    <p>So Li Changzhe's amount of information is indeed very large.</p>

    <p>Although he didn't say it clearly, Qu Shuling's background was exposed in just a few words.</p>

    <p>After all, he is just a high school student. How could he have such a flawless character?</p>

    <p>But now Qu Shuling is in the limelight. Without any concrete evidence, it is impossible for this talented high school student in the eyes of the world to admit his failure.</p>

    <p>Like what was revealed on the forum about fainting in the closed beta of the spiritual world. No one would believe it.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling doesn't think this is a particularly extreme negative argument.</p>

    <p>For example, Wang Ling saw the trending video of Qu Shuling shirtless and persuading girls to drink two days ago... Such a case is even more social.</p>

    <p>However, the video at that time only captured the back. There was no way to prove that the person was Qu Shuling himself.</p>

    <p>What's the trick here? Wang Ling doesn't care about it now. His top priority right now is to deal with this spiritual world test and the upcoming Earth Center Project.</p>

    <p>As for this time, Li Changzhe reminded him to pay attention to Qu Shuling. Wang Ling felt that this opinion could be adopted. It really sounded true.</p>

    <p>Anyway, after this first internal test in the spiritual world, his impression of Zhang Linyan and Li Changzhe, two classmates from outside the school, was much better than that of Qu Shuling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling doesn't like Qu Shuling very much. I feel like this person is hiding something.</p>

    <p>He lowered his head and looked at the time. It was already 6:00 in the morning. Originally, this was the time when Wang Ling left for school.</p>

    <p>But today, Wang Ling was not in a hurry to leave as usual. He sat calmly at his desk and stared out the window, as if waiting for something to arrive.</p>

    <p>"Is there anything you want to send?" Er Ha asked curiously.</p>

    <p>"Yes."Wang Ling replied obediently. Cherish words like gold.</p>

    <p>Just a minute later, Er Ha saw a hint of golden light in the fiery red clouds illuminated by the rising sun. First, there was a very bright round spot of light.</p>

    <p>Then the light spot grew bigger and bigger as it got closer, and finally formed a huge sparkling disk, which suddenly flew down from a distance.</p>

    <p>This golden light carries astonishing cosmic energy. It seems to have the power to disintegrate everything.</p>

    <p>"Here's another...Cosmic Embryo!"</p>

    <p>After closer observation, Er Ha finally discovered the origin of this golden disk.</p>

    <p>This was when I was in Glio City in Mixiu Country. Wang Ling made a deal with the Saints.</p>

    <p>The Saints underestimated the power of Wang Ling. In order to ensure that they would not be exterminated by Wang Ling, they had no choice but to hand over the actual control of the Tengu. They also agreed to hand over the Cosmic Embryo to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>At this point. Wang Ling now has all two Cosmic Embryo in hand.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling currently does not know what specific role Cosmic Embryo can play. But what is certain is that this thing is closely related to the Old Dominator. It is likely to be the key magic weapon that determines the direction of victory in the future.</p>

    <p>And such things must not fall into the hands of evil people. The reason why Wang Ling is anxious to collect them is because they are worried that someone will use the energy of Cosmic Embryo to cause trouble and add trouble to their ordinary daily life.</p>

    <p>"Did they time out?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha asked. He remembered that Wang Ying had given a limited date when he went to negotiate.</p>

    <p>"It doesn't matter. As long as you get the thing, it will be no problem." Wang Ying wiped his chin and said, "This thing has huge energy. It is probably not easy to transport it with their ability. Fortunately, it has been perfectly recovered now."</p>

    <p>"Then the Saints just let it go like this?" Er Ha asked.</p>

    <p>"They probably won't attack again in the short term." Wang Ying said, "After all, this is a deal. We also promised not to take the initiative. But if they are disobedient, we will just destroy them."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Er Ha fell silent after hearing the words.</p>

    <p>Just destroy it...</p>

    <p>What a domineering statement.</p>

    <p>But it does fit Wang Ying's personality.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was still seven o'clock in the morning on January 15th. Four hours had passed since the first round of internal testing of the spirit world ended. There were also a lot of gossips about this internal testing on the Internet.</p>

    <p>At the entrance of Jian Shen College. Yi Zhiyang was eating beef noodles in a noodle shop while looking at his mobile phone. He was also browsing the closed beta news about the spiritual world.</p>

    <p>However, he found that most of the news seemed to focus on the foreign aid student invited by Yaqi High School. Rokume Akahoko.</p>

    <p>"Who is this Rokume Akahoko?" Yi Zhiyang put down his chopsticks and touched his forehead. He felt a little confused.</p>

    <p>Gong Xuan, who was sitting opposite him, was peeling fragrant tea eggs and said calmly: "He is a famous high school student in Sun Island. And his performance this time is said to be really good. Li Changzhe said that."</p>

    <p>"Li Changzhe said it. That's pretty reliable." Yi Zhiyang nodded: "Hey, it's a pity. If I had recovered a little bit, I might have been able to go in last night."</p>

    <p>"The time for the supplementary test has come down. How about you go? Anyway, the quota can be transferred." Gong Xuan said seriously.</p>

    <p>"Forget it, forget it. It's better for you to go." Yi Zhiyang shook his head. Fighting for places has never been his style. Secondly, Yi Zhiyang is also more afraid of death. Compared to now, he has not fully recovered. This is what happens if he sees a sharp object on his body. There was another reaction. That was truly embarrassing in front of the world's elite high school students.</p>

    <p>He is still recovering. Even in the morning, he only dares to eat noodles. And they are wide noodles... He doesn't even dare to touch his favorite breakfast fried dough sticks. Because some fried dough sticks have two pointed heads. He is afraid.</p>

    <p>"You've been flipping through it for a long time. What are you flipping through?" Gong Xuan couldn't help but ask when he saw Yi Zhiyang looking attentively flipping through his phone.</p>

    <p>"Looking for a person. But found little information about him."</p>

    <p>"Who?"</p>

    <p>"People from Number 60 High School."</p>

    <p>"What's that guy called Wang..."</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling." Yi Zhiyang replied.</p>

    <p>"Well, that seems to be the name. He also went in last night."</p>

    <p>"Did you see how you got in?"</p>

    <p>"no..."</p>

    <p>Gong Xuan shook his head.</p>

    <p>Yi Zhiyang: "I found one. Someone on the Internet said that Li Changzhe banged his head on the door first and entered. Then he used a primer to stick to Li Changzhe's body and they went in together. Do you think it is possible?"</p>

    <p>"Not quite."</p>

    <p>Gong Xuan shook his head: "If such a shameless method is used, with Li Changzhe's personality, people will definitely say that this guy is shameless. But their relationship seems to be very good now. Yesterday, they added WeChat after coming out of the spirit world."</p>

    <p>Yi Zhiyang was stunned: "Is there such a thing?"</p>

    <p>Gong Xuan: "Why did you suddenly notice him?"</p>

    <p>Yi Zhiyang: "It's nothing. It's just my younger sister who asked me if I'm familiar with this guy. I want to know some information. I guess my sister likes him. I think this guy has hidden a lot. I'm secretly investigating him. He seems to be famous. It's not true. Why don't you take him in as your brother-in-law? Then you can know more of his secrets?"</p>

    <p>Gong Xuan: "You are really a genius... Does your butt still hurt?"</p>

    <p>Yi Zhiyang sneered: "Ha. We won't talk about butt stuff today. Thank you for the compliment."</p>
