  <h1>Chapter 2165 Integrating Power</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Things developed suddenly and the turning point was a bit abrupt. But the ending of the story was much better than Wang Ling imagined.</p>

    <p>Even though he didn't take any action. Even though he didn't realize that he was unilaterally entangled with the girl's emotional reaction, it was actually some kind of emotional factor that was at work.</p>

    <p>And she realized this late. Looking to the future, she had been waiting for him for more than ten years.</p>

    <p>Of course, all this is another story.</p>

    <p>For the current Wang Ling, the relationship between him and Sun Rong has not yet reached such a complicated level.</p>

    <p>Now she is one of the core members of the Office of Strategic Deception. And she also has a rare and powerful fighting ability. So she is planning and planning everything in the rear and takes Sun Rong to play with her. Isn't it normal?</p>

    <p>He also brought Diulei and his apprentice Zhuo Yi to play with him.</p>

    <p>That's right. This is all based on the most basic logic of friendly partner behavior.</p>

    <p>In addition, another very important point is that Wang Ling feels that Sun Rong is his relatively stable source of crispy noodles.</p>

    <p>When Father Wang withheld his pocket money for no reason so that he could not buy the limited edition and simply bought it, Sun Rong's "kindness" Wang Ling was clearly remembered.</p>

    <p>At the same time, outside the main hall of the General's Mansion, Lao Huang saw from a distance that Sun Rong put his arms around Wang Ling's neck.</p>

    <p>There was no doubt in his mind that there were ten thousand black question marks floating over his face. He had no idea what was going on.</p>

    <p>This...</p>

    <p>Is it really Zhenren?</p>

    <p>Old Huang is convinced.</p>

    <p>I am completely convinced by Wang Ling's operation of pretending to be an NPC.</p>

    <p>He and Sun Rong constantly conduct Turing tests to test it out!</p>

    <p>In other words, if Sun Rong hadn't broken the mask on Wang Ling's face through this wave of door-opening assassinations, maybe this person would have planned to continue hiding it from Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>But as for the reason for hiding it, Lao Huang has more ideas than Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Perhaps it was not just because the hidden mission required concealing one's identity. Lao Huang felt that perhaps Wang Ling was secretly planning it. Moreover, the strictness was such that even acquaintances could not easily inform them.</p>

    <p>Of course, Huang did not choose to criticize these extra operations. He is not a discerning person. He does not want to destroy this hard-won reunion and harmony.</p>

    <p>However, at this moment, Lao Huang's heart was undoubtedly still very messy.</p>

    <p>Because he probably already knows the details of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>After all, the name Sun Yiyuan is too resounding. In addition, Sun Rong has demonstrated a mature style as a future corporate successor in managing the town. Lao Huang almost quickly determined that this person with the ID name "Sun" The female player in "Yiyuan" may be the legendary eldest lady of the Huaguo Shuilian Group.</p>

    <p>And the general from Fuyun Town in front of her is probably her classmate.</p>

    <p>What a guy. Two Foundation Building high school students are cheating and killing everyone in the game world... The key point is that Huang is convinced. This is definitely not the result of krypton gold.</p>

    <p>The game world of Itinerant Immortal is fair enough. There are no additional options other than taking chances from the game guides shared by a large number of players.</p>

    <p>Of course. In order to ensure the revenue of the game, Bai Qiao will launch a skin function after the public beta of the game. That is, there will be no additional attribute bonus when sold. It is just a good-looking fashion.</p>

    <p>This is a necessary operation to recover part of the game development costs.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The main hall of the General's Mansion. Wang Ling After the showdown, the situation in front of him seemed to become a lot clearer. At least for Lao Huang.</p>

    <p>But when he saw Wang Ling being very frank, he began to switch among the various identities he had collected.</p>

    <p>Lao Huang and Sun Rong were still shocked.</p>

    <p>Now. Wang Ling's identities are: [waste], [prison head], [General Chen of Fuyun Town], [Demon Lord of Ten Caves of Fuyun Town] and [Demon Lord of Hundred Caves of Fuyun Town], [Wolong Recruitment Envoy ]...</p>

    <p>Are you going to take away all the NPC jobs?</p>

    <p>"My classmate Wang deliberately concealed his identity. I think there is nothing wrong with this. It is very reasonable..." Lao Huang couldn't laugh or cry.</p>

    <p>He feels that the current high school students in the Foundation Building are a bit too outrageous.</p>

    <p>The key is that even if Wang Ling personally compiles a guide for such an operation, there is a high probability that it cannot be replicated.</p>

    <p>Because it is too outrageous.</p>

    <p>Now many people outside would rather believe that Wang Ling is an NPC than believe that he is a Zhenren player. This is the reason.</p>

    <p>If Wang Ling is really a Zhenren player. In the minds of many people, Wang Ling has become an insurmountable legendary peak.</p>

    <p>So Lao Huang felt that although Wang Ling had exposed his identity as a player at this time.</p>

    <p>But fortunately, the number of people who know about this matter is still limited, so everything is still within the controllable range.</p>

    <p>Everything seems to be back on track.</p>

    <p>But soon, a series of system announcements began to appear in the World Channel.</p>

    <p>[System] Xiong Wu, the president of the Four Elephants Guild, killed the player "Jiuquxi" in Eight Star Ridge.</p>

    <p>[System] Xiong Wu, the president of the Four Elephants Guild, killed the player in Eight Star Ridge, "Today I want to be the cave master."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>A series of system announcements. Xiongwu was killing everyone in the game world. Such anomalies immediately attracted the attention of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Those people from Sixiangzhong have obviously been captured in the real world, but their accounts in the game world are still logged in. And their behavior is more arrogant than before.</p>

    <p>According to Si Xiang Zhong's previous style, they would just send sword immortal players of similar levels in the guild to rob. This would at least seem fair on the surface.</p>

    <p>But now, a guild leader just goes out to bully newcomers and directly kills the guild in the system announcement. This is a bit shameless.</p>

    <p>"How could this happen..."</p>

    <p>In the Karma Base, Shou Chong looked at a string of abnormal codes that were suddenly generated in the game world. He tried to correct it. But he found that this string of codes could not be modified by human factors.</p>

    <p>Therefore. There is only one possibility that can explain this phenomenon.</p>

    <p>That's when the gray fog arranged by Bai Zhe in the game world took effect.</p>

    <p>Although Xiongwu's Zhenren was captured, their game data has been realized. According to Xiongwu's own logical thinking, an independent individual was directly separated and became a real virtual person.</p>

    <p>In other words, the data of the four core members of the Four Elephants who were captured in the real world has become real in the game world.</p>

    <p>They live in the game world of Itinerant Immortal. They are independent individuals created by Bai Zhe using twisted power.</p>

    <p>Because of this. No matter how Shou Chong corrects the game data, they cannot be erased.</p>

    <p>"Wow. This is obviously a bug..." Shou Chong was a little confused. Such a change was too sudden. And it was also a bit too complicated for him.</p>

    <p>"Ling Ling can find a solution."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming sighed.</p>

    <p>The only solution for now is to believe that Wang Ling can resolve this matter satisfactorily.</p>

    <p>And with his help, almost all the preliminary work has been completed.</p>

    <p>After all, in the current world of Itinerant Immortal magic rings, Wang Ling is not the only one who drives the secret layout of cheats.</p>

    <p>There are also other core members of the Office of Strategic Deception arranged by Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong, Xiang Yi, Zhuo Yi, Jiugong... They are all important forces that Wang Ling can use to form troops.</p>
