  <h1>Chapter 1228 Void Invasion</h1>

  <div>

    <p>With the general idea provided by Gu Shunzhi, the focus of the next discussion will be very clear.</p>

    <p>It is based on the premise that the earth is being invaded by advanced beings and ethereal beings from the "Gate of the Void." Everyone calls this event the "Void Invasion."</p>

    <p>The problem then unfolds.</p>

    <p>When did the void spirits begin to invade the earth?</p>

    <p>What is the invasion mode of Ethereal?</p>

    <p>What is the ultimate goal of Void Spirit?</p>

    <p>The last point and the most important point. Among the clues provided by Warden Liang, it is known that the person codenamed "Judgement" of the SBP Foundation may be a "spy" from the void. So what are they waiting for?</p>

    <p>"If creatures from higher planes become interested in lower planes, their final goal is definitely to invade and occupy the territory or to destroy lower creatures for their own pleasure. However, if this [Judgment] is already a virtual spirit, then they will be delayed. The reason for not taking action must be another purpose. Maybe they are looking for something..."</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi said. He looked at the time. It was almost ten o'clock. He stood up from sitting cross-legged and said, "I'm sorry, everyone. I have to go copy my homework."</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "You, the person of order, don't care???"</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi: "I can only give you further hints, but I cannot intervene. The Void Gate is not within the Tao. I am not qualified to do anything at will. Unless I get permission from Heavenly Dao. But so far, Heavenly Dao has not There are no orders. But I can still provide you with some analysis to the best of my ability. If you find new clues, you can come and talk to me."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi, Er Ha: "..."</p>

    <p>Although it is said that orderers have the rules of orderers, Er Ha feels that the process of this Heavenly Dao is too rigid. Do you have to wait for someone to hit the door with a cannon before sending out orderers to maintain the peace of the universe?</p>

    <p>Er Ha doesn't quite understand this matter.</p>

    <p>"Senior Gu has Senior Gu's thoughts. Of course, another situation cannot be ruled out." At this time, Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>"What's going on?" the others asked.</p>

    <p>"I remember Master once said to me. Heavenly Dao has his own way of judging crises. If Heavenly Dao thinks that these virtual spirits do not pose a big threat, he will not take action." Having said that. Zhuo Yi He smiled bitterly: "Actually... after all, on this earth, my master is still here... I don't know the creatures behind this door. How many palms can I face with my master?"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, everyone was silent. Because this is the fact.</p>

    <p>"What should we do next?" At this time, Er Ha asked.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi curled his lips quietly. After clearing his thoughts, his nervous mood also became happy: "Keorn refused to say anything. It was because he thought that if he remained silent, the news would not be leaked. But thanks to Senior Gu, we now have a clue. Now we may be able to use this information to pry Keorn's mouth open."</p>

    <p>Then. Zhuo Yi quickly made a plan based on the clues at hand.</p>

    <p>"Senior Wang Zhen, senior Liu Qingyi. You two go to support Zhenjun. If nothing happens, Zhenjun will probably run into a wall in Jinghua."</p>

    <p>"No problem." The two nodded.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was a little surprised that he agreed so quickly. He felt that after returning from the national competition, the relationship between the two seemed to have eased a lot. It was not as incompatible as before.</p>

    <p>"Senior Zhenyuan, please follow me."</p>

    <p>"No problem." Zhenyuan Immortal has been sitting obediently. His long, fiery red hair is constantly fluttering with the surging breath.</p>

    <p>He got excited...</p>

    <p>Then Zhuo Yi turned his attention to Wei Zhi: "Senior Li Huanran and senior Jiang Yingyue, who is autistic in the bathroom, are important witnesses. Please keep an eye on Brother Wei Zhi for now."</p>

    <p>"It doesn't matter." Wei Zhi shook his head.</p>

    <p>This apartment has long been restricted by Zhenyuan Immortals. This restriction was specially designed to target external intrusions and Jiang Yingyue. As long as Jiang Yingyue has plans to escape or take action, the restriction will be activated immediately. Jiang Yingyue was crushed to the ground like a pancake.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingyue had tried it once before. Her personal evaluation was that the pressure made her breasts hurt. It felt like she almost burst the silicone inside... She didn't dare to try it again easily.</p>

    <p>Task distribution. In the end, Er Ha is left.</p>

    <p>"Go find Immortal Toya and Cailian Zhenren." At this time, Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>"What are you looking for them for?"</p>

    <p>"I need to know the mode of virtual spirit invasion. Judging from Senior Gu's inference, they are likely to be attached to the human body. So since they are attached to the body, maybe they will have a rejection reaction with the human body? Of course. These are just My guess is that Immortal Toya-senpai has a lot of medical information. Maybe he can get some clues."</p>

    <p>"I understand." Er Ha nodded.</p>

    <p>The troops are divided into three groups. Everything is within the deployment of Zhuo Yi. Although Zhuo Yi is at a low level, he always has a good view of the overall situation. This is why Wang Ling likes Zhuo Yi. And An important reason for accepting him as a disciple.</p>

    <p>And Zhuo Yi has always been a bold character. It is important not to be afraid of taking the blame.</p>

    <p>Just when everyone was about to set off, Zhuo Yi suddenly said to Li Huanran again.</p>

    <p>"Wait a minute. There's something else."</p>

    <p>"Is there anything else?" Li Huanran said.</p>

    <p>"I have a hunch, Senior Li, that you may be one of the focuses of this incident. Someone may do something to you while we are away..."</p>

    <p>"But there are restrictions imposed by Senior Zhenyuan here. Ordinary people cannot enter." Wei Zhi said.</p>

    <p>"But we can't rule it out. If the Void Spirit comes to find you, they might have special methods, right?" At this point, Zhuo Yi took out the thermal underwear from the storage bag: "This is for you. Senior, this is what my master left for me. I have another set here. This set is a spare. You put it on first, just in case something unexpected happens."</p>

    <p>"This is..." Li Huanran held up his autumn pants with a confused look on his face.</p>

    <p>"This is... no, maybe the strongest armor in the entire universe." At this time, Zhenyuan couldn't help but sigh.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>22:15. Wang Ling paused his homework. He went to take a shower and changed into his White Rabbit pajamas. At the same time, he also remotely followed the progress of Zhuo Yi over there.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei rushed to Jinghua City alone. Although this move was dangerous, Wang Ling felt that there should be no problem. He still had one of his own King's Eyes in his hand. It was enough to cope with the predicament at hand.</p>

    <p>"Is it a virtual spirit..."</p>

    <p>Previously. Wang Ling asked Sun Spirit what was behind the Void Gate.</p>

    <p>The Sun Spirit told him that behind the Void Gate there was nothing but emptiness.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling still don't understand what this means.</p>

    <p>Then. Wang Ling took out the "Senluo Wanxiang Pillar" that Wang Ying had used before from his pencil case. This pillar had shrunk to the size of a needle.</p>

    <p>This thing is a thing of the void. Wang Ling originally planned to find a suitable opportunity to send it back.</p>

    <p>Now. He feels that the opportunity has come.</p>

    <p>Since the other party has been invaded by void, he has to reciprocate...</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, Wang Ling used another King's Eyes to carve a Heavenly Dao poem that is widely circulated in Heavenly Dao on this dense pillar:</p>

    <p>What year is this dream?</p>

    <p>Sit on the ground and transform into three thousand.</p>

    <p>The heart connects to the whole world.</p>

    <p>Ignorance also becomes immortal.</p>

    <p>Immediately. Wang Ling moved his mind and captured the location of the Void Gate.</p>

    <p>Then he opened the window, flicked his fingers, and sent out the colorful pillar in his hand.</p>
