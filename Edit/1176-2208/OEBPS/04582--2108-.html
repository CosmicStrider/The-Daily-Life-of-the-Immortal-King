  <h1>Chapter 2108 Reading more can really change your destiny</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: If Chen Chao's "open mouth" was an unintentional mistake, but Mr. Zanghu's inference makes it even more terrifying when compared with it.</p>

    <p>Being knowledgeable can really change your destiny. This is why Wang Ling has not given up on learning even though he is so powerful.</p>

    <p>Because. He did not pin all his hopes on Wang Ming. Instead, he thought that if he could one day, he would be able to develop Talisman without relying on Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>But sometimes it's easy to form an inherent concept when it comes to thinking. Even the smartest people once fall into a certain circle, it's difficult to get out.</p>

    <p>Relatively speaking, Wang Ming is a very special being. Because almost everything he has studied so far is "black technology" developed without normal thinking. It is really difficult for normal human monks to imitate .</p>

    <p>Especially now, when he has obtained the divine brain, it is even more incredible.</p>

    <p>A long time ago Wang Ling had not thought about whether to implant spiritual roots into Wang Ming so that he could truly become a cultivator.</p>

    <p>But this good intention was clearly rejected by Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>As a man who wants to be strong throughout his life, Wang Ming does not want to rely on Wang Ling to prove himself. For him, the only thing that can prove himself is him.</p>

    <p>And now, he has indeed proved that with his ordinary human body, through wisdom and scientific research, he can also stand shoulder to shoulder with human monks.</p>

    <p>Everyone in the Old Wang family is strong.</p>

    <p>This is true for Wang Ming. This is even more true for Father Wang and Mother Wang.</p>

    <p>They both have spiritual roots, but their shortcoming is that they are very weak...so weak that they can almost be ignored.</p>

    <p>So Mother Wang and Father Wang are still in the body-training stage. To put it bluntly, they are ordinary people with stronger strength.</p>

    <p>With Wang Ling's strength, it is easy to help his father and mother embark on a normal path of spiritual practice. But the couple clearly refused Wang Ling's help. In Wang Ling's view, this is considered Father Wang and Mother Wang have shown good intentions to him since he was a child.</p>

    <p>Lead by example. Ask him not to abuse his power.</p>

    <p>Not everyone will feel happy after gaining great power. After all, people still have to decide their own destiny in life.</p>

    <p>Back to business.</p>

    <p>Now Mr. Zanghu. Wang Ling also sees the same label as Wang Ming. That is "be strong."</p>

    <p>If Wang Ming is said to be a strong man in his life.</p>

    <p>That Mr. Zanghu is the Zanghu who will be strong in his life.</p>

    <p>His talent is not too high, and his appearance is unremarkable. He even became obsessed with practice and turned into the Tibetan Fox he is now.</p>

    <p>But he was not defeated by the suffering. He still kept his spine straight and used what he had learned to describe the true meaning of scientific cultivation to others.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had never realized that Mr. Zanghu was such an interesting person before.</p>

    <p>Now... I do notice some meaning.</p>

    <p>In the critical scene, no one could blame Mr. Zanghu for being "discourteous." After all, this was analyzed based on his own knowledge and ability. Moreover, it was also an unintentional guess.</p>

    <p>In ancient times, heroes competed with each other. The disciples of the major families only knew that in terms of combat prowess, realm came first. Although there were also basic etiquette and cultural lessons, Sun Ru himself accumulated reputation through fighting.</p>

    <p>There is something to be said about her learning. She was not considered strong in the context of that era, but she could not be said to be a scumbag either.</p>

    <p>So Sun Ru herself also admires people with rich knowledge reserves.</p>

    <p>Especially the Mr. Tibetan Fox in front of me. He is clearly a modern monk. He can actually see so many things with his own eyesight...</p>

    <p>I almost told the truth.</p>

    <p>On the Internet, Mr. Hidden Fox mainly popularizes science and identifies various popular "fake science" videos on the Internet. It covers a wide range. The most popular one is naturally the spirit beast series.</p>

    <p>But in fact, Mr. Zanghu's knowledge base is very broad. It's not just popular spiritual animal identification. He has dabbled in jade, spiritual minerals, cultural relics, spiritual plants and immortal grass. Wait a minute!</p>

    <p>Some people call him the living encyclopedia of cultivation.</p>

    <p>"Grandma Taizu..."</p>

    <p>This situation makes Sun Rong seem a little overwhelmed.</p>

    <p>But Sun Ru actually aroused a lot of interest. She put her hands on her hips and said very generously: "Since Mr. Zanghu is interested in my jade armor, why don't you take a closer look?"</p>

    <p>"Is that okay?" It can be seen that Mr. Zanghu also realized that he had just been too excited. He knew that he was offended, so he stepped back several times. But unexpectedly, this grandma of Sun Rong. He was too enlightened in his imagination.</p>

    <p>Originally, Mr. Zanghu felt that the ancestor-level figures who never emerged from the ancestral land that had been in seclusion all year round were generally stubborn living fossils, the type who were ready to suppress people at every turn.</p>

    <p>Now it seems that he still likes to label people too much. He does not discuss in categories and considers everything comprehensively.</p>

    <p>This is a big taboo as a science popularizer.</p>

    <p>To be honest. According to the online videos, he became famous by identifying the popular series of spiritual beasts. But he himself is more interested in studying these "old objects."</p>

    <p>Tracing the origins of human monks, eliminating the false and retaining the true of human civilization, and restoring its essence. This is what he has always wanted to do.</p>

    <p>Seeing that the atmosphere had eased, Wang Ling was secretly relieved.</p>

    <p>Sun Ru was very generous. Not only did she allow Mr. Hidden Fox to take a closer look, she even made an invitation that surprised everyone.</p>

    <p>"Then, Mr. Zanghu, would you be interested in visiting the place where I live?"</p>

    <p>Sun Ru said: "Where I live, there are more good things!"</p>

    <p>Although the old item Sun Ru is wearing now is this jade armor, it doesn't mean that she doesn't have other magic weapons on her body.</p>

    <p>Whatever you take out is an ancient thing.</p>

    <p>People around: "..."</p>

    <p>Mr. Zanghu's eyes lit up: "Really. Is that okay?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong held his forehead. He quickly took Sun Ru's arm and said, "Grandma Taizu...is this too hasty?"</p>

    <p>Sun Ru responded playfully: "Is it rash? I think it's fine!"</p>

    <p>At this moment, Sun Rong just sighed. Arranging Sun Ru to live in the apartment of Wei Zhi's family was really a wise choice. www.uukanshu.net Otherwise, with the personality of her grandma Taizu, she might not know what to do. What kind of trouble will happen again?</p>

    <p>For Mr. Zanghu, it is a great honor to have such an opportunity to visit old objects up close.</p>

    <p>He is not the type of person who prostitutes for free, nor does he like to owe others favors.</p>

    <p>Dangzhi patted his chest and said, "Old things. I don't look at them for nothing. If you need my help, you can just ask!"</p>

    <p>Tuesday, January 21st. There are 10 days until the Earth Center Project begins.</p>

    <p>Chen Chao and Guo Hao are still practicing with their respective masters Cang Long and Liu Yong in the Mountain of Recall.</p>

    <p>The confrontation around the restricted sea area continues.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling got the answer he wanted. He is planning the next layout.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Wang Ming was also recommended a candidate who might have a significant role in breaking the wall of spiritual consciousness...</p>
