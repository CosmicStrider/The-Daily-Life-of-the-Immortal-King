  <h1>Chapter 1357 Monk Jin Deng comes to visit</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The reason why the Zhao family can gain a foothold in God's Domain is to rank in the top ten.</p>

    <p>In fact, it is also due to the various strange skills mastered by the Zhao family.</p>

    <p>To put it bluntly, it's just that the mind is too big, which leads to an increase in all kinds of weird knowledge.</p>

    <p>Then we developed some weird spells based on Heavenly Dao...</p>

    <p>Some of these spells are very powerful, but some are also useless.</p>

    <p>After many years of experiments, the head of the Zhao family has naturally mastered countless "weird spells."</p>

    <p>Although Zhao Qingxian is his legitimate son.</p>

    <p>But because of my lack of knowledge and skills, although I inherited a lot of things from him, most of them are actually two swords.</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhao Qingxian, who had changed his soul into Fan Xing's body, was a little overwhelmed by the situation in front of him.</p>

    <p>Although Fan Xing's facial features are passable.</p>

    <p>But as a man.</p>

    <p>"Important equipment" is missing.</p>

    <p>Still doesn't work.</p>

    <p>However, {TemporaryÂ·Soul Changing} cannot be cast again after it is activated. The body can be automatically replaced after the spell time expires...</p>

    <p>But Zhao Qingxian couldn't wait any longer.</p>

    <p>He unplugged the various infusion tubes on his body and picked up the storage ring on the ground.</p>

    <p>This ring was also deliberately thrown in the corner by Zhao Qingxian before he exchanged his body. Although he exchanged his body, the soul in Fan Xing's body is still Zhao Qingxian.</p>

    <p>So. Opening the storage ring is a piece of cake.</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian took out a {Tian Yuan Gui Xin Dan} worth 1 billion immortal gold.</p>

    <p>He sneered: "You are just a miscellaneous repairman from Earth. You are really getting an advantage..."</p>

    <p>Throwing the elixir into his stomach, a warm spiritual energy flowed out from his blood vessels, nourishing the whole body and repairing the damaged body.</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian clearly felt that his physical condition was improving.</p>

    <p>This is the life-saving elixir he brought from God's Domain. He brought six pills in total. As long as he is not instantly killed by a palm and still has a breath of life, this pill can bring his life back...</p>

    <p>Although Fan Xing's physical condition is a bit bad, with fractures all over his body and severed meridians.</p>

    <p>Although the connection has been completed, such an injury needs to be recovered. Based on the current level of elixirs on the earth, even if we use the best medicinal materials to nourish it every day.</p>

    <p>Without two years of recuperation, it is absolutely impossible to return to the level of a normal person.</p>

    <p>But now, a pill from Zhao Qingxian restored the injury in an instant.</p>

    <p>The power of the medicine is still being absorbed, but Zhao Qingxian can already feel that he has regained his ability to move.</p>

    <p>Then he opened his pants and took a look. The expression on his face was still a little disappointed: "Even such a miracle drug can't regenerate organs..."</p>

    <p>However, Zhao Qingxian has mastered a variety of strange skills. It is not that there is no way to repair it.</p>

    <p>"It seems that we have to make a deal with the River God."</p>

    <p>He thought of a secret method. Although it was risky, he could give it a try.</p>

    <p>Anyway, this body is not his now.</p>

    <p>It really doesn't work. Just wait until the statute of limitations expires...</p>

    <p>After that, he will choose another person to swap bodies...</p>

    <p>On the other side. At the entrance of the villa where Sun Rong lives. There is a handsome monk visiting the huge fountain.</p>

    <p>Facing the monk who suddenly appeared in front of her, Aunt Qiu, who was cleaning in front of the door, bowed very politely and smiled: "Master, if you are here for alms, please come with me."</p>

    <p>"As expected of Miss Sun Rong's subordinate."</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng performed a Buddhist ritual. He has always been polite to educated people.</p>

    <p>"Master, do you know my lady?"</p>

    <p>"The poor monk's Buddhist name is Jin Deng. Please let me know. I have something important to discuss with Miss Sun."</p>

    <p>So he is the lady's friend?</p>

    <p>Qiu Shuyun was amazed at the wide range of friends her young lady had made.</p>

    <p>"Master, please wait a moment." Aunt Qiu nodded.</p>

    <p>Then, she immediately walked to the door. She raised the intercom phone at the door and started to confirm the situation with Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>In just half a minute, Aunt Qiu got the exact answer. She walked up to the monk and welcomed him in.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The monk was taken directly to Sun Rong's room by Aunt Qiu.</p>

    <p>In the room, the girl was sitting on the sofa. Two maids were placing vegetarian pastries and tea on the coffee table.</p>

    <p>They moved quickly. In a short time, all the things for the reception were ready.</p>

    <p>"Stand back. You didn't hear me calling you. No one is allowed to come in." Sun Rong ordered.</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>The two maids bowed and then quickly retreated.</p>

    <p>After there were no outsiders in the room, the monk finally spoke: "Miss Sun is still as considerate and considerate as ever. Seeing that Miss Sun's complexion has returned to the same level as before, the poor monk feels more at ease."</p>

    <p>"Master, please sit down quickly."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong kept a smile on his face from beginning to end: "I am safe this time. I am grateful for everything Master has done for me! I will definitely repay you in the future!"</p>

    <p>"What I have done is insignificant. If Miss Sun wants to thank you, I still have to thank Ling Zhenren." The monk smiled and said, "A monk does not ask for anything in return. I am not here to ask for a gift in return from Miss Sun."</p>

    <p>"May I ask what you need to do, Master?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"The poor monk came here this time to ask what kind of magic weapon Miss Sun wants."</p>

    <p>"Magical weapon?"</p>

    <p>"Have you forgotten, Miss Sun? You are the champion of this Office of Strategic Deception face pinching competition. The first person to pinch Ling Zhenren's face." The monk just finished speaking. Two streams of steam came out of the girl's ears like a long dragon. Howling out.</p>

    <p>But soon, the girl's rapidly rising temperature returned to calmness under the influence of the spell.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er appeared from the state of shadow. Transformed into an entity. Suddenly appeared beside the girl. Lying on the girl's knees, he said: "Monk Jin Deng. I think you can just buy an electric fan for Rongrong! Save it!" I use cooling techniques on her every day!"</p>

    <p>"Ying'er...don't be rude!" Sun Ying'er's outspoken personality has always given Sun Rong a headache.</p>

    <p>"There is no need to be so polite..."</p>

    <p>"In front of a poor monk." The Jin Deng smiles.</p>

    <p>He looked Sun Ying'er up and down.</p>

    <p>If it weren't for the difference in hair color and personality.</p>

    <p>When two people sit side by side, the monk feels like he is looking at twins.</p>

    <p>"Whatever kind of magic weapon Miss Sun wants, you can do it. Most of the poor monks can do it." At this time, the monk glanced at Sun Rong: "Let's do it. How many kinds of magical tools can the poor monk provide for Miss Sun?" direction."</p>

    <p>"direction?"</p>

    <p>"Yes." The monk nodded: "Magical weapons are classified according to their functions. They are divided into three types: offensive magical weapons, defensive magical weapons, and auxiliary magical weapons. And the poor monk just calculated that Miss Sun may need to use them. To. Auxiliary magic weapon."</p>

    <p>"Master, what do you say?" Sun Rong asked curiously.</p>

    <p>"Miss Ying'er, doesn't she have back pain? The poor monk can create a magic weapon to relieve back pain," the monk said.</p>

    <p>"But Ying'er's back pain was caused by Wang Ying's {Planet thumping technique}."</p>

    <p>"Although Miss Sun's body has been blessed by a poor monk, it does not mean that she can do whatever she wants. What does it have to do with me..."</p>

    <p>The monk said seriously: "Then Miss Sun is so sure that she won't be in pain in the future..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "?"</p>
