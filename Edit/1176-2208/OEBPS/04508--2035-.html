  <h1>Chapter 2035 Bright Moon Night. Stop scratching</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This time the situation was urgent. Wang Ling had to take action. Although he was hiding in the wind and snow, Sun Yiyuan still felt the moment when the spiritual power emerged.</p>

    <p>The old man, whose body was surrounded by flames, suddenly widened his eyes with a look of disbelief on his face.</p>

    <p>He felt that his neck was stiff. Like a machine, he slowly turned his eyes slightly behind him. He saw the young man in school uniform walking on the glacier with his trouser pockets in his pockets indifferently in the wind and snow.</p>

    <p>At the moment, Wang Ling no longer cares about this much. It doesn't matter even if he is seen by Sun Yiyuan. Mingyue Ye is not an ordinary cultivator on earth. He is a little harder to kill.</p>

    <p>After all, his strength is comparable to that of the Eternal One.</p>

    <p>In the state of sealing, Wang Ling can only cripple it with one palm. If you want to completely eliminate it and never cause further trouble, you have to use a move more powerful than an ordinary palm.</p>

    <p>However, the move that kills with one hit often makes a lot of noise.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling was fully prepared before he came. This time he takes action. Sun Yiyuan will definitely find what makes him unique.</p>

    <p>However, there is {Great Memory Technique}. In fact, it doesn't matter if it is seen for a while. Just replace the memory when the time comes.</p>

    <p>For example, he can replace Sun Yiyuan's memory of seeing him take action with the memory of seeing Zhuo Yi take action.</p>

    <p>Anyway, according to Boss Sun's original idea, the positions of master and apprentice between him and Zhuo Yi were reversed. Zhuo Yi became his master instead.</p>

    <p>So replace it with Zhuo Yi. It is a relatively reasonable option.</p>

    <p>But memory replacement is actually risky. Although Wang Ling has successively carried out bug fixes and upgrades for many commonly used Heavenly Dao spells, if it is reused many times, it may still produce irreversible sequelae.</p>

    <p>The fundamental reason is that Wang Ling is too strong.</p>

    <p>Even people like Boss Sun, one of the few True Immortal warriors among cultivators on earth, cannot withstand the repeated attacks of Heavenly Dao level spells.</p>

    <p>So this time after using the {Big Memory Technique} on Mr. Boss Sun, Wang Ling had to record it in private. This was to avoid using it repeatedly on one person, which would have irreversible effects.</p>

    <p>But now. I see Wang Ling appearing.</p>

    <p>The shock in Sun Yiyuan's heart is self-evident.</p>

    <p>The old man's eyes widened and he looked at him with confusion on his face: "Classmate Wang Ling?"</p>

    <p>No matter how incredible his brain power is, he would never have imagined that Wang Ling's realm could be so unfathomable.</p>

    <p>Just a high school student.</p>

    <p>Wearing only regular school uniforms and walking in the "Frost Purgatory" of the Sun Family's Hundred Thousand Mountains, like a normal person... Is this something a normal high school student can do?</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Yiyuan's mind was filled with thoughts, just like the snowstorm that was falling all over the sky. He even started to feel a little confused and confused.</p>

    <p>Now that he has decided to show off, Wang Ling no longer restrains his spiritual power. He lets out a long sigh of relief. Strong spiritual power seeps out from every pore, melting the surrounding ice on the spot, turning it into a vast whiteness. The mist rises.</p>

    <p>Then, the ice beneath my feet began to split.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>There was a loud noise. The glacier under my feet cracked rapidly in all directions like a spider web!</p>

    <p>His spiritual energy was extremely powerful. It penetrated just a little bit and directly decomposed the large glaciers of this frost purgatory.</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan was so shocked that he could not speak. The huge tremor on the ground nearly knocked him down. His True Immortal-level balance ability was completely lost under Wang Ling's spiritual pressure.</p>

    <p>He felt like a duckweed tumbling in the waves. He had completely lost the attitude that a True Immortal should have.</p>

    <p>But now, Mr. Boss Sun can no longer feel the shameful emotion at all, because his mind is filled with horror.</p>

    <p>Because this just shows that the realm of Wang Ling has surpassed True Immortal!</p>

    <p>Otherwise, it would never be possible to bring such an astonishing and extremely oppressive feeling just by relying on spiritual power and spiritual pressure.</p>

    <p>What an amazing realm and strength this is!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling put one hand in his trouser pocket.</p>

    <p>He gently touched the old man's back with his fingers. A golden light flashed out. It turned into ripples and formed a circle of ripples that spread across Sun Yiyuan's back. Then it completely covered his body. This was the body-protecting golden light.</p>

    <p>It is also a routine operation when Wang Ling takes action to protect friends from harm.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling raised his head and took a look at Mingyue Ye.</p>

    <p>He was trying to embed his body into the iceberg behind him to stabilize his body.</p>

    <p>However, under the gaze of Wang Ling, this is ultimately useless.</p>

    <p>A look.</p>

    <p>Mingyue Ye fell directly under the heavy pressure. The whole person landed vertically along the mountain.</p>

    <p>He smashed the iceberg with his face, tearing a huge crack out of the iceberg. Then he lay down on the ice like a toad.</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan couldn't help but cover up after seeing it.</p>

    <p>Mingyue Ye. It's so miserable...</p>

    <p>Hit the iceberg directly with your face. The visual effect is very painful!</p>

    <p>If he were a normal person, his face would already be covered in blood.</p>

    <p>However, because Mingyue Ye was no longer a human being, part of her body was directly transformed into spirit debris during the process of splitting the iceberg with her face.</p>

    <p>"It seems that not all inhumane people can become stronger."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling walked to Mingyue Ye and sighed secretly.</p>

    <p>He had already given Mingyue Ye a chance. He didn't expect that she would dare to appear in front of him openly.</p>

    <p>At this time, the fear in Mingyue Ye's heart had reached its limit. He roared and began to use what he had learned all his life. He manipulated the terrain to condense countless broken ice around him into sharp blades, and stabbed towards Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't hide or avoid. Just looked at him.</p>

    <p>After a burst of violent bombardment, he slowly squatted down in the ice blade storm. Looking at Mingyue Ye who was lying on the ground and trying to cast spells, he sighed slightly: "Stop scratching."</p>

    <p>These three words are extremely insulting.</p>

    <p>Don't tell me that Yue Ye can't even reach the Dao Ancestor realm now. Even if he reaches the Dao Ancestor realm, it's just a scratch for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>At first, Peng Xiren thought that he was invincible when he reached the realm of Dao Ancestor. As a result, such damage was not enough for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>From the rear. Boss Sun's expression said everything. His jaw almost dropped to the ground. He could almost swallow an ostrich egg alive. His whole person fell into a sluggish state. He was completely unable to use normal logical thinking. Thinking about the problem.</p>

    <p>"If you kill me... my master will send others! Those people are more cruel and inhumane than me!" Mingyue Ye said, with fear in his eyes.</p>

    <p>In front of Wang Ling, he felt that his entire being had become humble. He was just a paramecium.</p>

    <p>This time. Wang Ling didn't talk nonsense with Mingyue Ye.</p>

    <p>He just stood up slowly and pointed his palm at his head.</p>

    <p>5% Law Order Palm.</p>

    <p>The next second, the spiritual power condensed in Wang Ling's palm. Then it emitted a dazzling light and burst out in an instant!</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>A red light cannon shot out from Wang Ling's palm.</p>

    <p>Wherever the light wave of the Law Palm passes, everything is annihilated...</p>
