  <h1>Chapter 1756 Jiang Yingying becomes a disciple</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"Classmate Jiang. Are you okay?" Sun Rong stepped forward and untied the rope that bound Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>She didn't know why. She felt that the person wearing the nine-tailed fox mask in front of her seemed familiar.</p>

    <p>In fact, when Sun Rong first appeared, Jiang Yingying was blindfolded. For a time, she had the illusion that Sun Rong was coming to save her.</p>

    <p>However, later on, this idea was broken by her in an instant.</p>

    <p>Especially after her blindfold was blown away. She saw that this woman's sword energy was red.</p>

    <p>Fierce and domineering.</p>

    <p>It's completely different from Sun Rong's Aohai.</p>

    <p>Immediately, Jiang Yingying couldn't help laughing at herself.</p>

    <p>She didn't know what she was fantasizing about... She actually wanted her love rival to save her?</p>

    <p>This idea is a bit too naive.</p>

    <p>Then Sun Rong spoke. The nine-tailed fox mask has its own voice-changing function. Therefore, Sun Rong's voice sounds very different from the original one.</p>

    <p>"What do you call it?" Jiang Yingying asked.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong quickly replied: "My name is... Wang Piaoliang."</p>

    <p>"Oh, then I'll call you Pretty Sister<sup>1</sup>!"</p>
    
    <dfn><sup>1</sup>("王漂亮" "漂亮" meaning pretty.)</dfn>

    <p>Jiang Yingying smiled brightly.</p>

    <p>Although everyone has always said that Jiang Yingying and herself are very similar, when looking at Jiang Yingying face to face, she would occasionally be in a trance, but in fact, if you look at it for a long time and distinguish it carefully, you can still tell it apart.</p>

    <p>Just like the smile in front of me. Sun Rong found that when Jiang Yingying smiled, she was actually nothing like herself.</p>

    <p>"They didn't do anything to you, right?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"It's okay. I just got a couple of smacks." Jiang Yingying rubbed her face. In fact, it was for video shooting. Yin Hu didn't use much force before.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong checked it out. Use the Office of Strategic Deception prepared in advance to contact the mobile phone. Take photos to collect evidence. Then use Aohai's power to help Jiang Yingying repair her injuries.</p>

    <p>It was still using simulated red aura. Jiang Yingying couldn't tell.</p>

    <p>"Speaking of which, do you know why they captured you?" Sun Rong asked as "Wang Piaoliang" while recovering. Of course she already knew what was going on. Therefore, this question was just a test.</p>

    <p>"They captured the wrong person. They were originally going to capture the eldest lady from the Huaguo Shuilian Group."</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying smiled bitterly: "At the beginning, I said they had captured me wrongly. They didn't believe me and even beat me. Later they found out that they had captured me wrongly, so they planned to take advantage of it."</p>

    <p>"Just follow the plan?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. They seem to have some dirty information about the young lady. They want to make a video to prove it. They originally wanted to capture her, but they captured me. Then they planned to ask me to cooperate in making a video."</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying said: "However, I didn't agree to them. So I was beaten..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was shocked when she heard these words.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, she found that she didn't hate Jiang Yingying so much.</p>

    <p>In such a dangerous situation...</p>

    <p>Even if Jiang Yingying really betrays her.</p>

    <p>She would also think that this was coercion. Jiang Yingying had no choice but to protect her life. She would not really blame her.</p>

    <p>But now. Sun Rong heard what Jiang Yingying said. Sun Rong feels a little uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>After a silence, she asked Jiang Yingying again: "But according to the news from the Office of Strategic Deception, it is said that you and this eldest lady have a feud. In fact... you can sell her to protect yourself, right?"</p>

    <p>"Ah...how do you even know this..."</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying didn't know what she thought of. Her face suddenly turned red: "Isn't it possible that even my grandfather knows about this? If he knew, I would be in trouble!"</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, classmate Jiang. Martial Saint doesn't know yet..." Sun Rong reassured.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying patted her chest and breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>She didn't know if the "Wang Piaoliang" in front of her saved her relationship. She suddenly felt that this was someone she could freely confide her concerns to.</p>

    <p>She never told anyone these things.</p>

    <p>One is that she doesn't dare. The other is that she feels that even if she says it, no one may understand her or listen carefully to her concerns.</p>

    <p>But now, she is facing "Wang Piaoliang" who saved her. Although she is not very familiar with Wang Piaoliang, she has an inexplicable sense of trust in Wang Piaoliang.</p>

    <p>"Actually, we can't really say that there is a festive relationship between her and me."</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying sighed and said: "It's just that she fell in love with the same person. The things she did to me were not too excessive. They were just aimed at me... If it were me, I would do the same. That's what you did. It's normal."</p>

    <p>"But isn't this a good opportunity to step on her?" Sun Rong asked sharply.</p>

    <p>"That's true. But these evil people are still evil people. If I help them, I will be aiding and abetting the evil-doer, won't I?"</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying laughed: "And in the final analysis, these are things between us little girls. There is no need to use this method to ruin someone's reputation. She is my competitor. As my competitor, Jiang Yingying, I believe that She would never do such a morally corrupt thing."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>After hearing these words, Sun Rong remained silent for a long time. She just felt moved.</p>

    <p>After suppressing her emotions, she did the final healing work for Jiang Yingying.</p>

    <p>Then, she took out a small mirror and handed it to Jiang Yingying: "Classmate Jiang, you can take a look in the mirror. I have repaired your injuries. I also helped you repair the red marks on your face."</p>

    <p>"Thank you, pretty lady. It really doesn't hurt anymore."</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying nodded. Then she took the mirror and looked at herself. Then she couldn't help but feel a surprise on her face: "Wow! Why do I feel that my face seems to be much whiter! The beautiful lady is so amazing!"</p>

    <p>"They're all just trivial tricks..." Sun Rong said modestly.</p>

    <p>"Speaking of which, pretty sister and I hit it off right away. Pretty sister is so good at skills. Can I learn some skills from pretty sister?" At this time, Jiang Yingying suddenly changed the topic and showed expectant eyes.</p>

    <p>"You mean... to be my disciple?" Sun Rong was stunned.</p>

    <p>"Yes, yes. That's it! I don't know if this will break the rules of the Office of Strategic Deception." Jiang Yingying said.</p>

    <p>In fact, she noticed early on that the Hanfu worn by Sun Rong had the emblem of the Office of Strategic Deception. She immediately knew that the sister in front of her was from the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>And judging by the way she extends her hands, she is most likely an elder!</p>

    <p>"You want to be my disciple...then Martial Saint..."</p>

    <p>"If grandpa finds out, I will take care of this matter. Grandpa won't ask any more questions."</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying said: "I am a girl. He has been teaching me hand-to-hand combat, martial arts, physical skills, etc... But what I really want to learn are those combat abilities that are lighter to use. Just like a beautiful sister using sword energy. Same as when she swept through this gang. How graceful."</p>
