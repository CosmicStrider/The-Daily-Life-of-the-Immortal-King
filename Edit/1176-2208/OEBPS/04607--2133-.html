  <h1>Chapter 2133 Lao Huang</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Finally, it was no longer an NPC talking to me. Sun Rong took off her helmet. Her eyes turned red on the spot. She was purely moved.</p>

    <p>Lao Huang was a little surprised when he saw that the person hidden under the heavy armor was actually a girl. He spoke a very magical Northeast dialect. He was very happy: "I didn't expect it to be a young lady?"</p>

    <p>In my impression, very few girls would choose the profession of ancient heavy-armored monk. The mobility is too poor, it is bulky, and it is not feminine and beautiful enough, which is a taboo for female players.</p>

    <p>Many girls choose professions such as immortal swordsman, stargazing Taoist priest, and mechanic that look more handsome. In the evaluation of many female players, the heavy armored monk is like a walking Urgot.</p>

    <p>"You're so excited..." As a player, Lao Huang is already an experienced player in the world of Itinerant Immortal. But facing such an excited girl, his otaku attributes are instantly exposed. He instantly became shy.</p>

    <p>Excited?</p>

    <p>That's for sure.</p>

    <p>Because for Sun Rong, all the plot developments currently faced can be described as inexplicable! It is such an open online game. She was stunned to complete the unparalleled single-player game...</p>

    <p>He didn't know which choice caused the problem.</p>

    <p>But Sun Rong doesn't remember that he has done too many outrageous things!</p>

    <p>Isn't it just an opening mission to hide your gender?</p>

    <p>She has successfully completed all this... but she ended up following this level 1 general from Fuyun Town to gain experience until now...</p>

    <p>Lao Huang was also surprised. He looked at Wang Ling up and down, and asked Sun Rong about his gaming experience.</p>

    <p>"I see. The task you are receiving now is to help this general manage the city?" Old Huang clicked his tongue. He suddenly felt that he had underestimated this game.</p>

    <p>At least among the closed beta players, no one has encountered this task in Novice Village. In other words, the task that Sun Rong is encountering now has no guide at all.</p>

    <p>No one knows exactly why. I encountered such a level 1 NPC general who was like a plug-in and forcibly pushed the map.</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling was walking on the way back to the city. He kept a steady pace as much as possible. At the same time, he also listened to the exchange between Lao Huang and Sun Rong behind him.</p>

    <p>Meeting players now is something that is expected. But Wang Ling didn't expect to bump into them at this time. It's a little out of place.</p>

    <p>But he still hopes to hide his identity as much as possible.</p>

    <p>"Generally speaking, even if there are NPCs to assist you in defeating monsters, you won't gain that much experience. You will reach level 35 by the time you are behind... Do you know how many people there were during the closed beta? Even if you practice to level 20, your liver will break out."</p>

    <p>Lao Huang complained.</p>

    <p>Like many games in the same category, the map of Itinerant Immortal is very difficult to survive. You may hit a wall everywhere. If you are not careful, you will die directly and start from the respawn point.</p>

    <p>The level will not be lost. However, two pieces of equipment will be randomly lost, 50% of the experience accumulated at the current level and 35% of the money on the body.</p>

    <p>This is somewhat of a loss.</p>

    <p>Therefore, many old players are walking on thin ice. They are afraid that they will die if they are not careful. They store all the equipment that can be stored in the wild map environment. And they have almost no money with them.</p>

    <p>It can be said that the old Huang who appeared in front of him was a maverick existence.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong was also very curious: "Old Huang. How long have you been playing? Now you are in orange equipment?"</p>

    <p>Itinerant Immortal is in the magic ring. It's scary to be able to collect a set of purple equipment before level 35. The orange equipment of Lao Huang can be said to be blinding.</p>

    <p>"I was there during the first and second tests. The files were deleted during the first test. The files were not deleted during the second test. But my files were deleted," said Lao Huang.</p>

    <p>"Deleted?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. It was very sudden. It was deleted immediately." Father Gu</p>

    <p>Lao Huang said with emotion: "I made a lot of good friends at that time. I didn't even have time to say goodbye to them... We even made an appointment during the second test. We were in such a hurry that we didn't even have contact information in real life. If you stay, it will be gone."</p>

    <p>"Could it be because of that bug incident?" Sun Rong remembered.</p>

    <p>The only bug that appeared in the inner part of Itinerant Immortal's magic ring was that all players' screens suddenly went black for two minutes.</p>

    <p>Although the bug was quickly recovered, it also caused a very small number of players to lose their archives after being disconnected and could not recover them.</p>

    <p>And obviously, Lao Huang is one of them.</p>

    <p>But Bai Qiao handled this matter very well, because the number of players whose accounts were directly deleted was very small, only in the single digits, so it was very convenient to compensate them.</p>

    <p>"That's it. Although I can't contact my good friends from before... but if we are destined, we can always meet again." Old Huang nodded.</p>

    <p>"What compensation did the official give you?"</p>

    <p>"Hahaha. It's four pieces of orange equipment! It's just functional equipment without adding attributes. The orange smiley face mask, the orange flying cloak! You just saw them! The other two pieces. Let me give it a try first!"</p>

    <p>Lao Huang said excitedly. As he spoke, he first showed the two pieces of equipment he mentioned to Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>[Mask of Eternal Faith (Orange)]: An orange accessory that does not add any additional attributes. It can be used in combination with mask-like equipment. It has two special skills.</p>

    <p>Special Skill 1: Illusion Counterbalance: It can resist the effects of illusions. But at the same time (when wearing the mask) the illusions you cast are not effective on other people.</p>

    <p>Stunt 2: The mask is permanently bound. It will not be dropped due to death or other factors.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>[Cloak of Everlasting Faith (Orange)]: This cloak will help you gain more freedom in the world of Itinerant Immortal. It has three special skills,</p>

    <p>Stunt 1 Light Flying: You gain the ability to fly. The flying distance will depend on the agility of the character. The higher the agility, the farther the flying distance. No spiritual power is consumed during flight. The flying speed is constant. It is equal to the normal running speed. But the advantage is that you You can now rely on your cloak to cross the map.</p>

    <p>Stunt 2: Airdrop Holy Treasure: While wearing this cloak, you can sacrifice 300 load-bearing space to carry one person to fly with you at high altitude. You can carry up to two people.</p>

    <p>Special Skill 3: The mask is permanently bound. It will not be dropped due to death or other factors.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"So awesome..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong looked at the introduction of the two pieces of orange equipment. and was dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>No wonder this old man is not afraid of wandering around in the wild map... All the compensated equipment comes with [handling] special skills. Even if you die in the wild map, you will not drop it!</p>

    <p>Although it does not add any additional attributes, it is obvious that these functionalities can really help a lot during the game.</p>

    <p>Normal players don't know how to get such equipment. But Lao Huang can have four pieces at once!</p>

    <p>"Are you envious?" Lao Huang asked.</p>

    <p>"A little." Sun Rong nodded.</p>

    <p>"It's all in exchange for friends..." Lao Huang covered his face. He couldn't laugh or cry.</p>

    <p>Then he immediately became serious.</p>

    <p>Looking at Sun Rong. He said solemnly: "But it's okay now. I have a new friend now."</p>
