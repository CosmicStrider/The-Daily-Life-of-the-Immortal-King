  <h1>Chapter 1242 The strengthened Teacher Liu</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling had indeed reserved his hand when he took action.</p>

    <p>He used a condensed version of {Great Gravity Technique}. It was only used against Teacher Liu Ruoxu who was trying to escape.</p>

    <p>This is a locked skill.</p>

    <p>But Wang Ling didn't expect that the power of the concentrated version could also trigger meteorites in the universe.</p>

    <p>He really is.</p>

    <p>It only exerts a tiny bit of power.</p>

    <p>But in the end, this is still his fault. He must find a way to solve it.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, when the meteorite falls, the huge explosion may level the entire Number 60 High School... no, the entire area.</p>

    <p>But there is a saying. Teacher Liu who was possessed by the virtual spirit has indeed become very strong.</p>

    <p>The virtual spirit has been perfectly integrated with Teacher Liu. Teacher Liu's body has also been blessed by the virtual spirit.</p>

    <p>For Wang Ling. This is an experiment.</p>

    <p>Because he has not yet fought against the creatures on the other side of the Void Gate.</p>

    <p>This is a good opportunity to test it out.</p>

    <p>Buzz!!</p>

    <p>Under the influence of the Great Gravity Technique, Teacher Liu, who wanted to escape from the gymnasium, fell from mid-air and hit the ground hard, creating a big crater.</p>

    <p>Her expression was ferocious and terrifying. Her eyes were bloodshot and her pupils were silver-gray. The virtual spirit inside Teacher Liu had completely given up hiding.</p>

    <p>Facing the frantic Teacher Liu, all personnel at the testing station retreated. Several security personnel rushed to the front to provide cover.</p>

    <p>They want to ensure the safety of the remaining students.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the loud noise coming from the gymnasium also caused many students to walk out of the classroom and stand in the corridor to watch through the windows.</p>

    <p>Su Xiao was frightened. Her whole body was trembling: "This... this means I am bald. Have I become stronger?"</p>

    <p>Several students in Class 2 were also shocked. They all swore to God.</p>

    <p>"Teacher, I will never copy homework again! I must listen to the class carefully!"</p>

    <p>"Uuuuu Teacher, I will never attend class again! I will delete {The Daily Life of the Immortal King} right now! I won't read this lousy book!"</p>

    <p>They had never seen what a crazy Teacher Liu looked like. But the aura exuding from Teacher Liu was indeed shocking.</p>

    <p>This is no longer a power that ordinary Golden Core teachers can exert.</p>

    <p>What surprised Wang Ling even more was that Teacher Liu actually climbed out of the pothole by himself.</p>

    <p>Being able to stand up under his own concentrated version of the Great Gravity Technique. This gave Wang Ling a clearer understanding of the power of the Void Spirit.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling forgot about his palms. The combat power of the virtual spirit attached to Teacher Liu's body is about the measurement unit of two palms.</p>

    <p>But he couldn't do it directly, because this body still belonged to Teacher Liu. He had to find a way to force the virtual spirit out of Teacher Liu's body.</p>

    <p>The Great Purification Technique is ineffective because the virtual spirit is not an evil spirit, fooling around, nor is it a toxin virus. It is a complete high-level creature. The power of the Great Purification Technique cannot act on Teacher Liu's body.</p>

    <p>In this case. Wang Ling can only find another way.</p>

    <p>He looked towards the sky. The meteorite that had fallen due to the Great Gravity Technique was already moving here at high speed.</p>

    <p>On one side is Teacher Liu who is driven crazy by the virtual spirit.</p>

    <p>On one side is a meteorite about to fall.</p>

    <p>This situation is undoubtedly a catastrophic trouble for Wang Ling. There are many people at the moment and it is impossible for him to take action directly. He can only secretly resolve this sudden crisis.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the gymnasium, under the locking effect of the Great Gravity Technique, Teacher Liu struggled to stand up from the ground. The concentrated version of the power cannot completely restrict Teacher Liu's freedom. But if it is the full version, it may trigger a new round of violence. Meteor crisis.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed inwardly.</p>

    <p>In this case, we must not only force out the virtual spirit in Teacher Liu's body, but also prevent the meteorite from landing.</p>

    <p>The best method seems to Wang Ling. There is only one.</p>

    <p>The next moment. Wang Ling turned his fingertips. He strengthened Teacher Liu's bald head.</p>

    <p>"Look! It's a golden legend!" someone at the scene exclaimed. More than one person saw that Teacher Liu's head was glowing!</p>

    <p>This is the effect after being strengthened by Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>The dazzling light is like the sun just rising on the horizon.</p>

    <p>People can't help but feel a little dazzling. Many people can't help but cover their eyes. They don't know what exactly happened. But this kind of light is really too dazzling!</p>

    <p>Strengthen Teacher Liu's bald head. This is just the first step for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Teacher Liu may now be the "strongest" woman in the universe.</p>

    <p>The next step is for Wang Ling to personally control Teacher Liu to fight against the meteorite.</p>

    <p>In just the blink of an eye, Teacher Liu instantly soared out of the gymnasium like a rocket, straight into the sky!</p>

    <p>With her bald head exuding dazzling glory, she headed towards the huge meteorite trying to pass through the atmosphere with an unstoppable momentum!</p>

    <p>The virtual spirit attached to Teacher Liu found that the body he had controlled did not listen to his instructions at all. He even couldn't help but uttered a curse word!</p>

    <p>Xu Ling originally did not know how to swear, but their learning ability is very strong. This is what the Xu Ling in the body learned inadvertently when Teacher Liu scolded the students.</p>

    <p>A few seconds before he was about to hit the meteorite, Xu Ling felt fear in his heart. He didn't know that Wang Ling had strengthened Teacher Liu's bald head. Therefore, he was unable to make an accurate judgment on the situation in front of him.</p>

    <p>He has been in Teacher Liu's body for a long time. It can be said that he has reached the point of perfect integration. And once Teacher Liu's body suffers trauma, he himself will also receive the same amount of damage!</p>

    <p>Never let this happen!</p>

    <p>He still wants to save his life to complete the mission assigned by the Lord of the Void!</p>

    <p>So, in the extreme inner struggle, seeing that he was about to hit the meteorite, the virtual spirit attached to Teacher Liu's body finally gritted his teeth and gave up Teacher Liu's body!</p>

    <p>The next moment, accompanied by a huge roar from the sky, a huge meteorite collided with Teacher Liu, who was launched from the ground.</p>

    <p>The meteorite suffered an impact from the most stubborn woman in the universe. It was smashed into pieces in the atmosphere... before the disintegrated gravel hit the ground, it was burned into fly ashes.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling controlled Teacher Liu to land safely. On the other hand, he chose to leave his body to capture the ethereal spirit that had just escaped from Teacher Liu's body.</p>

    <p>The virtual spirit escaped by chance and is preparing to find a new host.</p>

    <p>At this time, he saw Wang Ling where the soul left the body...</p>

    <p>Very strong person!</p>

    <p>This virtual spirit immediately became excited!</p>

    <p>At such a young age, he has mastered the ability to escape from the body. His physical fitness must be first-rate! This is not only several trillion times stronger than the female teacher he attached to before!</p>

    <p>"Boy, you'll be unlucky if you meet me!"</p>

    <p>This virtual spirit made an excited sound. Without saying a word to the soul of Wang Ling, it dived straight in!</p>

    <p>At the same time, on the other side, Wang Ling quickly recovered the soul.</p>

    <p>The plan to use the soul as bait to capture the ethereal spirits was a complete success.</p>

    <p>Ha. This virtual spirit met itself.</p>

    <p>Bad luck for him...</p>
