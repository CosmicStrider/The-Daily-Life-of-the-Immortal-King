  <h1>Chapter 1288 Suffering from lack of culture</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao never expected that the elders of the Divine Realm would have reached such a state of shamelessness.</p>

    <p>He finally brought people back to the divine realm.</p>

    <p>I came to accept the influence of a higher level of cultivation culture. But I was directly invaded by the sand sculpture culture!</p>

    <p>However, the battle in front of us doesn't seem to be over yet.</p>

    <p>Heavenly Dao originally thought that if the seven Dao Supremes joined forces, they could at least have a 50-50 draw with Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, this turned out to be a unilateral blast...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The monk struck a palm and defeated the seven Dao Supremes. If it were spread out at this time, the face of the seven families in their divine domain would be wiped out.</p>

    <p>But the monk did not finish the matter. He still kept his hand.</p>

    <p>Otherwise.</p>

    <p>Seven people.</p>

    <p>All must die.</p>

    <p>The only person in the world who can withstand the power of his palm is Ling Zhenren, except for Dao Ancestor Wang who has disappeared.</p>

    <p>And after clearly recognizing the strength of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Even if the monk wants to fight, he must weigh the power of the backlash.</p>

    <p>It's easy for him to hit him with one palm. The damage he gets back may make him paralyzed.</p>

    <p>At this time, the Seven Dao Supreme got up from the ground and wiped the blood hanging from the corner of his mouth.</p>

    <p>The monk's palm hit them until they vomited blood.</p>

    <p>This was something they never expected.</p>

    <p>It was also the first time for everyone present to fight against the sage of Buddhism.</p>

    <p>The monk's strength was far beyond their imagination.</p>

    <p>"Monk, have you ever thought about the consequences..." Zhou Zhentian was trembling all over. There was anger, but more of it was trembling.</p>

    <p>His front teeth were shattered when they hit the ground. His mouth was filled with blood. In addition, he also suffered serious internal injuries.</p>

    <p>He didn't know how long it will take to recover.</p>

    <p>Even though he can still speak now.</p>

    <p>It won't be long before he loses his voice completely...</p>

    <p>Seventy spurts per second at a high frequency. After all, his throat couldn't bear the pressure.</p>

    <p>"What the poor monk did was also for the sake of the Divine Realm."</p>

    <p>The monk scanned the crowd in front of him and said, "Are the elders convinced? If not, I have other means."</p>

    <p>This is not a joke.</p>

    <p>Based on his 3,910 reincarnation experiences, the monk has summed up tens of thousands of ways to torture the Dao Supreme in front of him to the point of dying without being instantly killed.</p>

    <p>Of course. If stubbornness doesn't work.</p>

    <p>It is not impossible to force a transition.</p>

    <p>That's it.</p>

    <p>Zhou Zhentian knows very well.</p>

    <p>Fight. Definitely can't be beaten.</p>

    <p>Unless the head of the family takes action. Maybe there is a glimmer of hope...</p>

    <p>The heads of the ten major families in God's Domain are all at the Dao God level.</p>

    <p>But it is so easy to ask God to take action.</p>

    <p>At present, almost all the heads of the family are in retreat and practicing. It is impossible to easily get out of seclusion and take action.</p>

    <p>Zhou Zhentian stared at the monk, feeling like a mute eating coptis.</p>

    <p>If they can't stop this, the Earth's upgrade will be a certainty.</p>

    <p>The monk relied on his own strength to do whatever he wanted, leaving them helpless.</p>

    <p>When did such a terrifying figure appear on earth?</p>

    <p>"Monk, if the head of the family wasn't in seclusion, do you think you can get a bargain..."</p>

    <p>Zhou Zhentian looked at Jin Deng: "I admit that I am not your opponent. If you are capable, let's discuss it!",</p>

    <p>"On Tao?"</p>

    <p>The monk smiled: "I will accompany you, poor monk."</p>

    <p>At this time, the seven Dao Supremes stepped forward one after another.</p>

    <p>They already have a problem in their minds.</p>

    <p>"Take the upgrading of the earth for example! Monk! Let me ask you... how do the high-level cultivation paths in the divine realm go on for these simple cultivators on the earth?"</p>

    <p>"The poor monk believes that there is no distinction between high and low in cultivation. There is no path to cultivation. If there are people, there will be a path."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Monk, you are a monk. Why do you want to fight for the short time for cultivators on earth?"</p>

    <p>"Dao Supreme asked the poor monk a question. Are you arguing with the poor monk? God's realm has been arrogant for a long time. It should not continue to degenerate. Dao Supreme asked such a question. The poor monk could only say that he was sorry for his misfortune and angry with him. No fight..."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"You Dao Supreme have already asked the poor monk two questions.</p>

    <p>So, can I ask you a question? "Tell me and listen."</p>

    <p>"The function y=f(x) defined on R. If for any unequal real numbers x1, x2 satisfies f(x1)-f(x2)/x1-x20. And x, y satisfies the inequality f(x??- 2x)+f(2y-y??)≤0 is established. Then when 1≤x≤4. The value range of y/x is?"</p>

    <p>"..."ò</p>

    <p>"Is it too difficult?"</p>

    <p>The monk frowned: "Can a power function be used?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"What about trigonometric functions and inverse trigonometric functions?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"There will always be a function, right?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Qida Dao Supreme shook his head. Hearing this, everyone looked confused.</p>

    <p>In their divine realm, math problems are not really taken seriously.</p>

    <p>The monk sighed helplessly: "I don't know anything. Why do I think I'm Dao Supreme..."</p>

    <p>The corners of Zhou Zhentian's mouth twitched. "Monk, we are on the wheel! What the hell are you asking..."</p>

    <p>"The great road of mathematics and physics. Why is it not part of the Tao?"</p>

    <p>The monk laughs.</p>

    <p>He will never forget. When he held the memory brick of Wang Ling, he was overwhelmed by the "electricity" function and vomited blood...</p>

    <p>Such pain. The monk didn't want to try it again. And he decided to share the pain more generously.</p>

    <p>Such a devilish thing. The pain alone is not as painful as the pain of others.</p>

    <p>"Monk, you are making excuses..."</p>

    <p>"Monks don't tell lies. If you don't understand the profound knowledge contained in these functions, a poor monk can tell that your realm will stop here. There will never be time to improve."</p>

    <p>At this time, the monk shook his head. He gathered the painful memory fragments from when he came into contact with the memory brick into a spiritual energy group and concentrated it on the palm of his hand.</p>

    <p>Then he stared at the many Dao Supremes in front of him: "If you don't believe it, you can take a look at this memory of the poor monk."</p>

    <p>The Seven Dao Supremes were doubtful and looked at each other for a while.</p>

    <p>In the end, it was Zhou Zhentian clan elder who stood up first: "It's just a math problem. I don't believe there is anything terrible about it."</p>

    <p>Then Zhou Zhentian stretched out his hand directly.</p>

    <p>The moment your fingertips touch the psionic mass...</p>

    <p>A feeling of electric shock came instantly!</p>

    <p>"No!" Elder Zhou clan hurriedly tried to let go.</p>

    <p>But it's too late!</p>

    <p>Terrible memories poured into his mental space. For a moment, he felt as if he had been struck by a thunderstorm! His whole body was twitching crazily with "electricity!"</p>

    <p>By the time the rest of Dao Supreme came to their senses, Elder Zhou had already thrown his buttocks on the ground...</p>

    <p>Staring at the elder of the Zhou clan whose body was charred and blackened by the "power of knowledge."</p>

    <p>The monk couldn't help but let out a sigh of sympathy.</p>

    <p>He glanced at the people in front of him: "There is also Mr. Dao Supreme. Do you want to give it a try?"</p>

    <p>"That's all..."</p>

    <p>The remaining six Dao Supremes took a step back.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Let's go back."</p>

    <p>At this time, Heavenly Dao felt helpless when he took Zhuo Yi and Sun Rong to witness the death of Heavenly Dao at the "Taoist Forum" outside the temple.</p>

    <p>I couldn't beat him again and again. I also suffered the disadvantage of being uneducated...</p>

    <p>Today's God's Domain is indeed in decline!</p>

    <p>In Buddha's Golden Lotus, the girl was also disappointed: "That's it?"</p>

    <p>Death Heavenly Dao smiled helplessly: "Whether it's the earth or the divine realm. Study hard. It's always right."</p>
