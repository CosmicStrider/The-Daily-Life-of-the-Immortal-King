  <h1>Chapter 2202 That year he had his hands in his pockets...</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling wore a hood and stepped forward step by step. From the moment he entered the factory, no one took such an ordinary high school student seriously.</p>

    <p>This group of monks who claim to be system capable people do not follow the orthodox path. They only obtain abilities by completing so-called system tasks and think very highly of themselves. Wang Ling does not bother to argue with them. After all, there is no happiness in cultivation. Comparable.</p>

    <p>Although Wang Ling's ability continues to grow day after day, it was not very happy at first. But on the road of finding ways to suppress his own ability, Wang Ling gradually found new fun.</p>

    <p>Others are trying every possible means to make themselves stronger. Wang Ling is trying every possible means to make themselves look less strong.</p>

    <p>It's the same happiness of cultivation. It's just that the way of happiness is different.</p>

    <p>The world is so big. Wang Ling is undeniable. Maybe there are real system capable people in this world. But those in the factory in front of us. Wang Ling cannot praise them.</p>

    <p>Just relying on King's Eyes ability, he has seen through too much.</p>

    <p>"The scroll is mine! No one can snatch it from me!" someone yelled from the front.</p>

    <p>With this shout, countless people came forward to fight for it excitedly. You fought for it, and the crowd instantly became a fight.</p>

    <p>It's pretty much what Wang Ling, Sun Rong imagined. These people have the realm that they have accumulated through the so-called system. But they are not good at physical skills at all.</p>

    <p>In Wang Ling's view, these people's fights are more like children's boxing. They are even far inferior to the physical skills of Chen Chao and Guo Hao, his two good brothers from Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>The scene was very chaotic. It was also very eye-catching.</p>

    <p>Such weak physical skills would be impossible to graduate from Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't care about all this at all. He walked out leisurely, as if taking a leisurely stroll. He didn't take this group of people seriously at all. He had a sense of intimidation. On the way there, fighting was raging around him. Everyone suddenly became quiet again.</p>

    <p>He walked all the way. The noisy fighting in the factory gradually subsided. Wang Ling seemed to have a magical power that could make everyone around him quiet down...</p>

    <p>At least in Sun Rong's eyes. That's what it looks like.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, the people who were fighting were actually frightened and speechless by the aura emanating from Wang Ling. They seemed to be able to see a large amount of spiritual energy, just like the one in the movie Wang Ling. Ocean-like blood spurted out from Wang Ling's Tianling Cap. In just a few seconds, it almost submerged the entire factory...</p>

    <p>At this time, Huang Tingjian, who was standing at the top, was also shocked. He found that he could not see through the young man in front of him.</p>

    <p>He is obviously a high school student. But Wang Ling's aura is so majestic that he is like an eternal monster.</p>

    <p>"Which high school student is this from..." Huang Tingjian began to be very curious about Wang Ling. He tried to test it. The result was that behind Wang Ling, a figure with a face covered with bandages. His back Born with eight wings. The spirit of Dharma, wearing dark ancient armor all over his body, suddenly appeared in Huang Tingjian's eyes.</p>

    <p>He couldn't call out the name of the spirit of Dharma. He saw in the next second that the spirit of Dharma quickly pulled out an arrow from the quiver at his hip and placed it on the bowstring.</p>

    <p>Then!</p>

    <p>Whoosh!</p>

    <p>An ink arrow pierced directly from the front. It almost pierced Huang Tingjian's ear.</p>

    <p>Huang Tingjian was frightened. Beads of sweat immediately flowed down his face.</p>

    <p>As a person with some basic knowledge of cultivation, he knew immediately that if this arrow had not been released, it would probably kill him directly.</p>

    <p>However, this ink-style Dharma Spirit successfully diverted Huang Tingjian's attention from Wang Ling to Lao Huang.</p>

    <p>This style is very obvious. It comes from the style of this painter. Moreover, this painter named Huang majored in traditional bows in college. It is not surprising to have such a spiritual guardian of the Dharma.</p>

    <p>The key is. This directly explains why this high school student has such powerful spiritual energy flowing in his body...</p>

    <p>"Did you borrow the light of this painter surnamed Huang?"</p>

    <p>Huang Tingjian frowned.</p>

    <p>After some brainstorming, he reasoned everything out into completely reasonable answers. Otherwise, it would be too exaggerated for a high school student to have such a powerful aura.</p>

    <p>In fact, this Dharma Appearance Spirit is not Lao Huang's Dharma Appearance Spirit. Instead, Wang Ling used King's Eyes to derive it based on Lao Huang's characteristics. The purpose is to mislead.</p>

    <p>And it's obvious that Wang Ling's misdirection worked.</p>

    <p>No one could stop Wang Ling from getting the scroll. Including Huang Tingjian. Everyone watched quietly as the male high school student in the Foundation Building slowly walked under the chain with his pockets in his pockets. With a simple primer, the scroll was pulled off. Then it was thrown into Lao Huang's hand.</p>

    <p>At this moment, it seemed that everyone in the room understood what was going on. Only Lao Huang was still confused.</p>

    <p>He actually differentiated his own Dharma Spirit. Let a high school student come and grab the scroll...</p>

    <p>The key is that they are unable to stop Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>This is a big shot!</p>

    <p>Many people lowered their eyebrows. The panic in their hearts could not be eliminated. Many people even began to regret it. They should not have yelled at Senior Huang in the first place. They should have ridiculed him for taking two people for outdoor training. High school students came to compete with them for information.</p>

    <p>Even Huang Tingjian changed his face. He changed into a respectful attitude.</p>

    <p>He fell from the sky and came straight to Old Huang. He bowed and said: "Senior Huang, speaking of it, you and I still have the same family name. I was rude before. I didn't expect that Senior Huang has such a powerful spirit of Dharma. His painting skills, The archery skills have all reached the pinnacle..."</p>

    <p>Lao Huang had no idea what had happened to White Hair. He touched his head. But he had to shoot as the arrow was on the string. He really wanted a stable job, so he took the initiative to extend his hand and shook it back. He was as humble as ever: " So Mr. Huang, according to regulations, this scroll?"</p>

    <p>"The information in this scroll naturally belongs to Senior Huang." Huang Tingjian did not dare to hold it directly. Instead, he took a step back and bowed his fists respectfully: "Senior Huang, you don't have to be so polite. You can call me Xiao Huang..."</p>

    <p>He knew it all too well. What these high-level cultivation masters like to do most is nothing but testing. They may seem elegant and easy-going, but in fact every step they take is a testing.</p>

    <p>If you make the wrong choice, your life may be in danger!</p>

    <p>"Xiao Huang. Isn't this bad?"</p>

    <p>Lao Huang thinks this is quite impolite. Huang Tingjian's ethics are clearly deeper than his own. How can he be called Xiao Huang?</p>

    <p>As a result, Huang Tingjian thought that Old Huang was angry. He knelt down and bowed down in front of everyone. He kowtowed heavily and said, "I overstepped my bounds. Seniors can call juniors whatever they want!"</p>

    <p>He was really frightened.</p>

    <p>That arrow just now was a show of force!</p>

    <p>If you don't bow your head at this time, you will probably be killed directly by this senior Huang Shengdong!</p>

    <p>Lao Huang: "..."</p>
