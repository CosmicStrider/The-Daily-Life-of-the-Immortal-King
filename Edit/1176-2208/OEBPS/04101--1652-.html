  <h1>Chapter 1652 The conspiracy of mechanized cultivators</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The Martial Arts Competition has only just started for thirty minutes. Jiugong defeated four people one after another. He reached the final level at the speed of light and became a huge dark horse that stood out on the scene.</p>

    <p>The dignitaries and bettors all roared in the entire viewing room, and the crowd was abuzz.</p>

    <p>"Gong! Too strong! Will be a god forever!"</p>

    <p>The situation changed rapidly. At first, no one paid attention to this "little man" with such a thin figure. But they never expected that this man was really "condensed to the essence." If he didn't take action, it would be fine. If he did, he would become a blockbuster.</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry. I won't give you another chance."</p>

    <p>At this time, Hei Long, standing in front of Jiugong Liangzi, looked like the most normal person, but there was a vague sense of danger.</p>

    <p>He stared at Jiugong Liangzi. The black eyes without the white of the eyes looked particularly terrifying. Jiugong Liangzi looked at Hei Long with all his concentration.</p>

    <p>She saw Hei Long's toes clinging to the ground. The ground on the ring was scraped with deep scratches, and then cracked in all directions.</p>

    <p>Bang!</p>

    <p>Hei Long's feet suddenly stepped out from the ground. It looked like a powerful beast. The speed was incredibly fast. It was completely different from the four things he encountered before.</p>

    <p>At the edge of the ring, Sun Rong was sweating secretly: "This..."</p>

    <p>She was sure that this Hei Long definitely had more than just the combat power of the Golden Core.</p>

    <p>Although the official average combat power of the gatekeeper list in the five levels is Golden Core. But such speed and explosive power. Sun Rong can be noticed just by the passive ability of integrating with the Aohai human sword.</p>

    <p>This Hei Long...is definitely not Golden Core...</p>

    <p>At the very least it has to be Dao God level!</p>

    <p>She once killed Dao God with the multi-core Aohai sword in her hand. She knows the true strength and weakness of Dao God.</p>

    <p>Although Hei Long hid himself very well, Sun Rong could still sense it.</p>

    <p>He quickly approached Jiugong Liangzi and quickly reached out his hand. With one claw, he was like a flying dragon emerging from the clouds, making a deafening sound of air explosion.</p>

    <p>This level gap is really too big. Jiugong Liangzi was completely frightened and couldn't react at all.</p>

    <p>The next second, this "Feilong Tanyun Grasping" hand formed a fierce wind and struck Jiugong Liangzi's chest.</p>

    <p>Although Jiugong Liangzi knew that she actually did not have breasts that could be attacked by others, as a girl, she still subconsciously wanted to resist.</p>

    <p>"Too slow." Hei Long curled his lips and sneered.</p>

    <p>He had almost foreseen the scene of the strong wind tearing the clothes on Jiugong Liangzi's chest.</p>

    <p>This is his bad taste when fighting with others.</p>

    <p>Almost everyone who knows Hei Long knows that anyone who has fought with Hei Long, regardless of whether they are dead or not, will have their clothes completely torn off after the fight.</p>

    <p>However, just when Hei Long's nails touched less than half an inch on Jiugong Liangzi's chest, an incredible scene happened!</p>

    <p>Hei Long's iron claw, which was about to attack Jiugong Liangzi, was actually blocked by a refracted golden light!</p>

    <p>No matter how hard Hei Long tried, he couldn't shake the golden light.</p>

    <p>"This is impossible!" Hei Long roared in a low voice. He couldn't believe what was happening in front of him.</p>

    <p>He is extremely confident in his own strength.</p>

    <p>After all, he was created by "that Lord!"</p>

    <p>And all the parts in his body are different from those sold to the outside world in this technology city! They are not parts forged using materials from this world!</p>

    <p>Hei Long clearly remembers the scene where the adult smelted the broken "ancient terracotta warriors and horses", then made those materials into parts and finally inserted them into his body one by one.</p>

    <p>"New magic weapon." At this time, Wang Ming said with his arms crossed.</p>

    <p>This was something he knew from Jia Bugui's memory.</p>

    <p>The name Hei Long is just a nickname for the man in front of him who conceals his true identity in this underground boxing ring.</p>

    <p>And his real name is "New Ancient Divine Weapons."</p>

    <p>"New Ancient Divine Weapons?" Zhuo Yi immediately reacted: "So. The Lord who created Hei Long also had something to do with the construction of the Ancient Divine Weapons?"</p>

    <p>"It should be a method inherited from Master Wu Xin."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said: "This Hei Long is the original New Ancient Divine Weapons." That is to say. That is to say, the strength of this Hei Long. That is to say, the strength of this Black Dragon is even stronger than those Ancient Divine Weapons that Master had encountered earlier." Zhuo Yi frowned. In his heart, he was grumbling.</p>

    <p>He was secretly surprised by the changes in the new and old ancient magic weapons.</p>

    <p>The original ancient magic weapon was huge. Although it looked very lethal, it was too bulky after all. It felt cumbersome when moving.</p>

    <p>But these New Ancient Divine Weapons. were completely made to look like human cultivators...</p>

    <p>Thinking of this. Zhuo Yi suddenly woke up and seemed to think of something.</p>

    <p>"Have you finally realized it?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ming followed Boss Jia's body, and the expression on his face began to become a little solemn.</p>

    <p>"Could it be that Master Wu Xin's purpose in establishing this science and technology city is..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi thought of an incredibly dark point of view.</p>

    <p>"You are thinking the same thing as I am." At this time, Wang Ming used brainwave transmission and said: "This person. Wants to cultivate this science and technology city into an incubation base for New Ancient Divine Weapons."</p>

    <p>"But... is it possible..."</p>

    <p>"From the memories I learned, the body mechanization level of the powerful people in the core area has reached over 89%. Only 20% is human tissue. And these things are essentially paving the way."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said. He actually had no interest in this technology city at first. But after learning about the memory of this wealthy businessman, he suddenly wanted to learn more about it.</p>

    <p>It is purely intended to inspire ideas for the next new Talisman research work.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Ming said, foreshadowing..."</p>

    <p>"These people are so mechanized. As long as they continue to go deeper, maybe just a chip. Waiting for their brains to be replaced, everyone will become a humanoid weapon."</p>

    <p>"This. This kind of thing...who would take the initiative to apply to replace their own brain with a chip."</p>

    <p>"Although it sounds unbelievable, according to the progress of events, what will happen next will definitely be like this."</p>

    <p>Wang Ming said: "Human civilization is a process of continuous progress. Once rumors spread that chip brains are more reliable than human brains, in order to enjoy a luxurious and luxurious life for a longer period of time, someone will definitely choose to do this. And then. A new round of following the trend has begun."</p>

    <p>"Then if there is negative news..."</p>

    <p>"There can be no negative news." At this time, Wang Ming said seriously: "Those people have been implanted with chips. A simple procedure can silence them. Then black and white will be reversed. In this technology city, from the powerful to the powerful, The poor will be deceived all the way up and down."</p>

    <p>When Wang Ming said this.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi has a full sense of picture in his mind.</p>

    <p>If Master Wu Xin's purpose of establishing this technology city is really to serve as an incubation base for New Ancient Divine Weapons, then once his plan succeeds, the top and bottom of this technology city will add up.</p>

    <p>He will have an army of New Ancient Divine Weapons with a population of hundreds of millions...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>While Zhuo Yi was momentarily distracted, a scene once again appeared on the ring in front that shocked the entire audience.</p>

    <p>Just after Hei Long's several attacks failed, his accumulated anger unexpectedly reached its peak.</p>

    <p>Black sigils rose up from under his feet, winding up from his legs like snakes, and finally crawled all over his body.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi frowned. This was a suffocating evil force. I don't know why. It made Jiugong Liangzi feel sick.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong feel like something is wrong with Jiugong Liangzi's condition: "Senior Jin Deng...There seems to be something wrong with Liangzi."</p>

    <p>The monk's face was calm: "This is the power of the Asura Hell. It has a certain restraint effect on the Buddha's light of the Consecration Technique. Although it will not unlock the 4.0 version of the Consecration Technique, it will definitely make Miss Liangzi feel uncomfortable. After all, she is not a Buddhist. The power of Shura Hell is focused on the heart."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong became anxious: "What should we do..."</p>

    <p>"Miss Rong, don't be impatient."</p>

    <p>After thinking for a moment, the monk said: "Then, let's replace it with a poor monk."</p>

    <p>"Senior means..."</p>

    <p>"Version 4.0 of the Consecration Technique. The person being consecrated has the right to use it to fulfill the wish. In critical moments, just say a word of great mercy silently. The poor monk can temporarily take over the body."</p>

    <p>"Is this...is this okay..."</p>

    <p>"No problem. In the thousands of reincarnations of this humble monk, I have had the experience of being a woman."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
