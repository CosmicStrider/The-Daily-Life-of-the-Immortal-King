  <h1>Chapter 1459: Being let go?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When Zhuo Yi received a message from Wang Ling. It was that night.</p>

    <p>In fact, as early as yesterday, he had received news that Wang Ling and his group were going to Xiu Zhen Cultivation Street.</p>

    <p>It's a holiday anyway. Zhuo Yi has nothing to do. He thought of dressing up and going over to give assists to his junior schoolmate Sun.</p>

    <p>But he never expected that before his plan was implemented, Wang Ling took the initiative to send a message asking him to follow him secretly... It was nominally to better protect the girl's safety, but in fact Zhuo Yi felt that was not the case at all.</p>

    <p>He knows his master very well.</p>

    <p>Generally speaking, in order to successfully hook up with a girl, a boy will usually find a wingman to cover him.</p>

    <p>And Zhuo Yi plays the role of wingman this time.</p>

    <p>But his function is different from other wingmen.</p>

    <p>It's to cover Wang Ling's retreat...</p>

    <p>So. This is obviously the layout of his master.</p>

    <p>As a result, the assist plan failed.</p>

    <p>After all, this time, his master Wang Ling personally invited him, and it is very likely that he will monitor his actions throughout the process.</p>

    <p>So Zhuo Yi feels that the assist plan is not easy to implement... Last time, although he imitated Wang Ling's voice and teased Sun Rong in the group, it was because of his appearance. Because of his understanding of Wang Ling's habits, he just had the opportunity to commit suicide.</p>

    <p>But the situation is different now.</p>

    <p>I just had to play it by ear.</p>

    <p>Of course, the above are just Zhuo Yi's own inferences.</p>

    <p>After all, so far. Wang Ling gave him the request. Just let him go. But he didn't say what it was for...</p>

    <p>Inside the cadres' apartment.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi called a friend he had met on Xiu Zhen Cultivation Street.</p>

    <p>That is the director of the sub-district office that manages that ancient street. With their relationship, it is very convenient to get a free travel pass.</p>

    <p>Of course. Zhuo Yi is not for petty gain. It is for safety reasons.</p>

    <p>After all, almost all projects on the ancient street currently adopt the face recognition + identity verification model. With the Changyou Card, you can go directly to the VIP green channel.</p>

    <p>He knows. The Jiugong family has been monitoring their situation.</p>

    <p>If the identity information is registered on Xiu Zhen Cultivation Street, those people will probably follow him immediately.</p>

    <p>"Thank you, brother. If possible, use the Heavenly Delivery Formation to send the card directly to my apartment. Yes, the address is still the same as before." Zhuo Yi finished speaking about his needs. He said thank you and hung up. Cut off the phone.</p>

    <p>At this time, he found that the TV screen in the living room seemed to suddenly change. A woman's figure seemed to appear on it.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi rubbed his eyes. The TV screen returned to normal immediately.</p>

    <p>Have you been too tired during this period?</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi smiled bitterly in his heart.</p>

    <p>After all, the coalition election is coming soon. He actually has a lot to do during the working day. In addition, he is also working hard to supplement his knowledge these days.</p>

    <p>Take yesterday as an example.</p>

    <p>In just one day, he read several classic works by the famous critical writer "Yuan Yuan."</p>

    <p>For example: {I can't breathe}, {Death of a black man}, {Woman under the horse's hooves}, {Bullets flying towards the door of the house}, {Sweet air} and {No one knows cultivation better than me}...</p>

    <p>This is a selection event that only those at the level of the General Administration of Hundreds of Schools are eligible to participate.</p>

    <p>There are a total of 1,282 general offices in all cities across the country.</p>

    <p>First- and second-tier cities and county-level cities are included.</p>

    <p>But compared to the general bureaus in other cities, he can be considered a Buddhist. He had seen many people go out to the streets to promote themselves and canvass for votes.</p>

    <p>"It's better to rest early today."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi rubbed his eyes. He got up and returned to the bedroom.</p>

    <p>He had a premonition.</p>

    <p>Tomorrow, something earth-shattering will definitely happen...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Saturday, December 12. In front of Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling wore casual clothes and took the earliest Spirit Bus to the school gate.</p>

    <p>He woke up very early. It would be a bit boring if he teleported here in advance.</p>

    <p>Occasionally take transportation and enjoy the city scenery along the way. It seems not bad.</p>

    <p>The outfit he went out with today was personally chosen by Mother Wang.</p>

    <p>The upper body is a white shirt, and the lower body is a pair of slim-fitting jeans. Wang Ling's legs are already in good shape. They are slender yet curvy. They are the kind of legs that all girls envy. With these jeans, they look perfect. reflected.</p>

    <p>When helping Wang Ling button up his shirt, Mother Wang deliberately did not lock all the buttons. He released the top one alone. This way, Wang Ling's collarbone was exposed.</p>

    <p>After finishing dressing up, Mother Wang was still intoxicated for a long time. After all, she gave birth to a boy... He looks good no matter what he wears!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed silently in his heart.</p>

    <p>He thinks that this kind of dress may be a bit out of place?</p>

    <p>Because these are all new clothes.</p>

    <p>I know Wang Ling is going out today. Mother Wang placed an order for it overnight yesterday.</p>

    <p>Never mind...</p>

    <p>As long as mother is happy.</p>

    <p>"Take more pictures Harlequin! Especially the hanfu photos. You have to take them! When you're choosing a hanfu. Let the girls help you!" Mother Wang is looking at Wang Ling with a wide mouth. Looking at Wang Ling with a smile on her face.</p>

    <p>"When taking pictures, remember to temporarily remove your {big shielding technique}! Don't take pictures that are all mosaic. It's not something shameful."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>By the time Wang Ling's thoughts returned, he had already arrived at the school gate.</p>

    <p>I thought I came early.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, Sun Rong came earlier than me.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling!"</p>

    <p>As soon as she saw herself, the girl waved and greeted him warmly.</p>

    <p>"Morning."Wang Ling responded.</p>

    <p>As always, cherish words like gold.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong's face turned slightly red.</p>

    <p>She doesn't know why she feels like Wang Ling today. It seems like she has a completely different feeling.</p>

    <p>He actually wasn't wearing the same clothes he had worn before!</p>

    <p>It's brand new!</p>

    <p>Did you dress up specially for this trip?</p>

    <p>Today's Wang Ling. looks great too!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong suppressed the urge to take out the phone and turn on the continuous shooting mode.</p>

    <p>She knew that it would be inappropriate to forcefully take pictures now. It might make Wang Ling disgusted. If several people took pictures together, it wouldn't be too embarrassing!</p>

    <p>At worst, we'll get rid of a few other people when the time comes. Only her will be left. And Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>But now comes the problem.</p>

    <p>Now the time has come for us to agree.</p>

    <p>Li Youyue, Chen Chao, Guo Hao... none of the three people came!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong held her forehead. At this time, she could even feel that the air was stagnant and solidified.</p>

    <p>These three people... must have planned to let the pigeon fly from the beginning, right?</p>

    <p>Just when there was nothing to do, the ringtone of Sun Rong's cell phone suddenly rang.</p>

    <p>It's a call from Li Youyue.</p>

    <p>"Where are you? I... My classmate Wang Ling and I have already arrived." Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"Ah! Sorry Rongrong! We're stuck in the subway station!"</p>

    <p>"we?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. Chen Chao, Guo Hao and I are together. We happened to meet each other. Someone suddenly fainted in the subway, causing the line to be blocked. Now we are just in time for the morning rush hour. It's a mess here."</p>

    <p>"Then you..."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry about us! I think this is fine. Let's meet directly at the intersection of the ancient street!"</p>

    <p>"Okay!" Sun Rong nodded and immediately hung up the phone.</p>

    <p>Okay, okay...</p>

    <p>She wasn't let off the hook. Otherwise, she really wouldn't know what to do.</p>

    <p>But soon, the girl's face quickly turned red again.</p>

    <p>Because that means.</p>

    <p>She will take transportation with Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>And the car is crowded with people.</p>

    <p>They're probably going to be next to each other...</p>
