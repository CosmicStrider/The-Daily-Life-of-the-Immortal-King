  <h1>Chapter 1676 A fancy show</h1>

  <div>

    <p>No one would have thought that the power of a piece of grass could be so terrifying.</p>

    <p>It is only a few inches long, but it exudes unparalleled divinity at the moment it penetrates the past. It shines brightly, illuminating eternity.</p>

    <p>With a terrifying sword intent penetrating from eternity, it suddenly split the earth under its feet into two, opening up an abyss of chaos and burying all these Dao God-level New Ancient Divine Weapons in the abyss of chaos. !</p>

    <p>Then, the cracks in the earth merged. At the cracked location, a long row of grass grew along the sword intent that had just been released.</p>

    <p>In just an instant, 30,000 Dao God-level New Ancient Divine Weapons were killed under a blade of grass by Leng Ming. One-tenth of them were killed on the spot!</p>

    <p>Such a deterrent is not a big one!</p>

    <p>If it weren't for the fact that there were other innocent people on the street, Leng Ming felt that his movement could be bigger. Maybe he could clear the place on his own.</p>

    <p>He is only at the level of Dao God. Now with his ability, cutting Dao God with the sword is like chopping vegetables. It is no longer a problem.</p>

    <p>This is the result of Jingke and Bai Qiao's special training every day and night.</p>

    <p>And there is another benefit to helping Leng Ming. That is mutual learning.</p>

    <p>Not only Leng Ming has improved. Even Jingke and Bai Qiao have also improved compared to before.</p>

    <p>This means that once Jingke and Bai Qiao merge into "Jingbai" again, the strength of Jingbai will be increased by more than one order of magnitude compared to the original.</p>

    <p>Three thousand New Ancient Divine Weapons were lost in the blink of an eye.</p>

    <p>When these spiritual links were severed from the divine brain, Nawei's divine brain immediately fell into a brief stagnation. The nerves connecting the New Ancient Divine Weapons in his brain were disconnected in an instant. Like a Fragile noodles.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the pain from mental backlash followed one after another. But the duration of this pain was not too long. Nawei soon woke up.</p>

    <p>After he woke up, the anger that followed immediately surged into his brain.</p>

    <p>He was furious. He immediately shook his head and jumped into the air. He was above the sky. In an instant, all the New Ancient Divine Weapons square array moved together at this moment, turning into streaks of light that gathered from all directions. It actually wrapped around his torso, limbs and head and fused.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the aura of the strongest is constantly superimposing, converging on the individual of Nawei!</p>

    <p>When a total of 27,000 New Ancient Divine Weapons with the power of Dao God completed their combination in the air, a sixty-foot-tall Ancient God giant also appeared in front of everyone!</p>

    <p>With the blue sky above your head and your feet on the earth, you can feel endless power just by raising your arms!</p>

    <p>An astonishing amount of energy is being released. It engulfs the entire Virtual Realm in an instant!</p>

    <p>This is an automatic search through the divine brain. Because Nawei has the information of all the aboriginal people. So if you know the information of the aboriginal people, you only need to go through the process of elimination. You can remove the "ants" that have been mixed into this world. "Find them out.</p>

    <p>"I'm going to kill you all!"</p>

    <p>The ancient god giant formed with the divine brain of Nawei as the core. The broad palms like mountains clasped together and formed seals at this time. Lord Diulei, Er Ha, Xiang Yi, Qin Zhong, Jiugong Liangzi and others were all included. Inhaled into his own supreme world.</p>

    <p>A supreme world built in the form of Stonehenge. It's full of large, irregularly shaped stones. They are stacked on top of each other. They are covered with obscure chaotic patterns. It's dizzying when viewed with the naked eye.</p>

    <p>"Why are we here all of a sudden?" Lord Diulei and Er Ha were amazed.</p>

    <p>They originally acted together and planned to directly destroy the den that housed the creatures. Unexpectedly, they were brought to the highest world by Nawei not long after they went deep.</p>

    <p>"Oops...Mr. Ming is still outside!" Xiang Yi was holding the Nine Sun Divine Sword. He was very nervous.</p>

    <p>"Ya!" At this time, Ah Nuan lay on Leng Ming's back and called out softly.</p>

    <p>"What did Nuan Zhenren say?" Xiang Yi was puzzled.</p>

    <p>This is baby talk. Others cannot understand it. But as a sword spirit, Leng Ming can understand it.</p>

    <p>So. Leng Ming translated: "Ah Nuan said. She has sent 096 to protect Mr. Ming. So don't worry about him."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Xiang Yi swallowed his saliva.</p>

    <p>All I can say is that he is worthy of being a boss...</p>

    <p>He could predict in advance that he would be sucked into the supreme world. He contacted 096 on the spot to protect Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>At this time, Xiang Yi just wanted to say one thing to himself: He is still too young.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, both Ling Zhenren and Ling Zhenren's sister are standard monsters. And monsters cannot be measured using normal cultivator logic.</p>

    <p>At this moment. In the supreme world. Nawei thought that doing this would improve his deterrence.</p>

    <p>However, it doesn't seem to be what he thought.</p>

    <p>These guys are obviously outsiders, and they have also been sucked into his supreme world.</p>

    <p>But what makes Nawei feel very strange is that these people don't seem to be afraid at all. Not only are they not afraid, but they also chat...</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect that this guy has this skill. He can actually use these New Ancient Divine Weapons absorption combinations for his own use. If he is really allowed to realize the New Ancient Divine Weapons replacement mass production plan for the entire Virtual Realm. I am afraid his strength will be even more terrifying. " At this time, Zhuo Yi frowned and said.</p>

    <p>"Then what should we do next? If we can't defeat this big guy, I'm afraid we won't be able to escape from this supreme world, right?" Sun Rong asked. She held Aohai in her hand and was eager to try. She felt very relaxed and contented.</p>

    <p>After all, we just had a showdown with Jiugong Liangzi. In other words, there is no need to be timid now.</p>

    <p>"The poor monk suggested that it would be better for Miss Rong to take action later. Let the five people, poor monk, Xiang Yi, Qin Zhong, Leng Ming, and Nuan Zhenren take the lead."</p>

    <p>"Then Zhenjun, little friend Er Ha, Mr. Zhuo and little friend Ziyi will fight for the second battle."</p>

    <p>"Finally, it will be fine if Miss Rong and Miss Jiugong end it."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong, Jiugong Liangzi: "..."</p>

    <p>This plan sounds really seamless and solid.</p>

    <p>But why do they always sound like they are picking up the slack?</p>

    <p>And what makes Sun Rong feel even more horrified is that Zhou Ziyi can actually fight in the second round!</p>

    <p>But thinking about Zhou Ziyi being used as a ping pong ball and running around in the audience just now. Sun Rong was instantly relieved.</p>

    <p>"Then just follow what Senior Jin Deng said." At this time, Qin Zhong couldn't help but smile: "This ancient god giant is the power of reorganization through some means. Although this supreme world is indeed the genuine supreme world. But it is also flashy. If we can defeat it, the power of the Supreme World will be weakened little by little. Senior Jin Deng can do this in seconds."</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng waved his hand and quickly stretched out his palm. Golden light overflowed in his palm. The golden light of the Great Sun Buddha condensed in his hand: "Then everyone, follow the agreed plan. In the first round, the poor monk will snipe the head."</p>

    <p>Xiang Yi quickly climbed down and began to adjust his Nine Sun Divine Sword: "Then, I will focus on the left and right arms."</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong nodded: "That's great. The left and right legs belong to me."</p>

    <p>Wang Nuan: "Ya Ya ya ya!!"</p>

    <p>Xiang Yi, Qin Zhong: "?"</p>

    <p>Leng Ming: "Ah Nuan said. She goes to attack the middle."</p>

    <p>At this time, all the men in the field couldn't help but feel nervous...</p>

    <p>Only Nawei was so angry that his scalp was numb.</p>

    <p>This group of people...</p>

    <p>In his supreme world, he was actually discussing how to attack him so calmly?</p>

    <p>They don't show any respect at all! They don't show any martial ethics at all!</p>
