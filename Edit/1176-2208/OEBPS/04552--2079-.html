  <h1>Chapter 2079 The sea area is about to become lively</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: Golden Core's slap. How can it kill someone?</p>

    <p>This was a joke that many people planned to see before Wang Muyu's palm fell.</p>

    <p>It was a joke based on Hong Siqi, the legendary casual cultivator. It was also a joke based on Wang Muyu, the disciple of the Sword Master.</p>

    <p>Of course, no one knows what this disciple of the Sword Master looks like or what his age is. All they know is that he is extremely well protected, wrapped tightly in a water polo, like an unmarried girl.</p>

    <p>Before this palm was struck, some people even deliberately used this to ridicule Wang Muyu. They planned to use this method to force the disciple of the Sword Master out of the water ball to see his true appearance.</p>

    <p>But Wang Muyu was not fooled.</p>

    <p>So until the palm fell on Hong Siqi's chest, no one cared what was going on.</p>

    <p>All I can say is that it all happened so suddenly.</p>

    <p>No one would have thought that this palm technique, which was the size of a drop of water, would explode the moment it touched Hong Siqi's robe.</p>

    <p>A mushroom cloud rising from the ground on Yama Island stunned everyone.</p>

    <p>All the vegetation on the entire island was instantly reduced to dust. Even the island was directly bombarded with a large layer cut off. Many people did not understand why such a change happened.</p>

    <p>Even if the disciple of the Sword Master is a genius, this is obviously not the destructive power that a Golden Core can achieve.</p>

    <p>Although the area of Yama Island is not that big, it is a famous island. You, a Golden Core, can actually blow up this island! This is not an operation that normal people can do!</p>

    <p>As for Hong Siqi, there is no difference between his death and his immortality at this time.</p>

    <p>All his clothes were blown away. He was lying on the bald Yama Island. He looked like a human-shaped briquette. The key was that the ash on his butt was not completely covered. On top of the charred black body, there was such a contrast in color. The legendary Venerated Immortal's buttocks are clearly visible.</p>

    <p>The shock on everyone's faces was almost at the same time. They all opened their mouths. They didn't know how to evaluate this matter.</p>

    <p>Master Mi Xiuyuan was also speechless.</p>

    <p>In the void, the old man hiding behind seemed to have become mute.</p>

    <p>Just a Golden Core.</p>

    <p>Can't kill anyone...</p>

    <p>A few minutes ago, those words kept ringing in my ears, making Master Mi Xiu wish he could depose himself.</p>

    <p>After a long time, he finally heard his voice: "Shouldn't the Sword Master...give me an explanation?"</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan was also shocked.</p>

    <p>He didn't even hear the question from Master Mi Xiuyuan at the beginning.</p>

    <p>Previously in the artificial lake, Wang Muyu's superb performance was clearly visible in my mind.</p>

    <p>But it's just a sluice. It's just a little high.</p>

    <p>In addition, due to its age and the fact that he had previously penetrated the sluice with a drop of water, it may have directly destroyed the mechanical support structure of the sluice as originally designed.</p>

    <p>So in Yi Jianchuan's view, Wang Muyu blasted through the sluice gate in the artificial lake. This is something that can be explained by modern cultivation science.</p>

    <p>But now it is just blowing up Yama Island and blowing up the Venerated Immortal until it is completely naked. This is a little bit... outrageous!</p>

    <p>Of course, Yi Jianchuan's first reaction was definitely not that Wang Muyu was hiding his strength.</p>

    <p>Instead, he frowned on the spot and bowed in the air.</p>

    <p>This time, he deliberately did not use an encrypted call. Instead, he directly chose to tell the truth: "Mixu Yuan Zun, I hope this matter will be investigated in detail! I and my disciples are all victims!"</p>

    <p>This is also done to give a reasonable explanation to all the monks present.</p>

    <p>Check in detail?</p>

    <p>What does it mean?</p>

    <p>Mi XiuYuan Zun was so angry behind his back that his liver trembled.</p>

    <p>On this earth now, although Sage Immortal has already qualified, there are still very few Venerated Immortal... there are such monks. It is also a major strategic resource.</p>

    <p>What's the result now?</p>

    <p>People have become so virtuous.</p>

    <p>It was agreed that it would only be a slap in the face. How come the water droplet exploded and turned into a nuclear bomb in the end?</p>

    <p>This is so unscientific!</p>

    <p>The key point is that all my people were bombed like this. You are here to cry out for injustice? Say you are a victim?</p>

    <p>I saw Yi Jianchuan's righteous words. He explained loudly: "To tell you the truth, I just taught my disciple the method of dripping water through stone in {Wuji Sword} today. Although he learned it quickly, he has not practiced it well after all. How can he use it? Is it my Golden Core's combat power that makes Hong Siqi such a virtuous person? Or is it that Hong Siqi's Venerated Immortal state is actually fake and has cultivated loneliness?"</p>

    <p>"This..."</p>

    <p>These words left many people in the room speechless.</p>

    <p>No one would have thought that Yi Jianchuan would use such an excuse to make amends.</p>

    <p>But how to say...</p>

    <p>This sounds reasonable.</p>

    <p>Just listen to the sword master continue to explain: "I wonder who in the world doesn't know who I am. In front of these fellow Taoists, since I have already made it clear that I will not do anything, in the eyes of so many people, if in my eyes During the process of the disciple's actions, I have leaked some of my spiritual power to help. There are so many people present. I think someone should have raised objections."</p>

    <p>"Moreover, the water droplet suddenly accelerated in the middle of the advancement and burst out with a powerful aura. How could he, a Golden Core, achieve this level of power? Therefore, my conclusion is that someone must be secretly using it. This palm of my disciple's hand. Acts of revenge."</p>

    <p>This is an impeccable explanation. It also suits Wang Muyu, Zhang Zhui and Yue Lingwei's intentions.</p>

    <p>The move just now was actually made by Wang Muyu after adding a few monks. It had the effect of increasing the power after someone intervened halfway.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui and Yue Lingwei also cooperated very well. They directly used their spiritual power to create a powerful wave of spiritual power in the sea restricted area, creating the illusion that someone was casting spells to intervene in the sea restricted area.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>In the space on the other side, Mi XiuYuan Zun was also silent for a long time. He was discussing this matter with the people around him.</p>

    <p>"Disciples of the Sword Master. Are there really only Golden Core realms?" He asked the subordinates on his left and right.</p>

    <p>The aura hidden by Wang Muyu in the water polo is exclusive to the Dragonborn. It is impossible to detect it by ordinary means. He wants to locate himself in the Golden Core. It is very easy. And it can be done seamlessly.</p>

    <p>Therefore, after Hong Siqi was seriously injured, they immediately re-tested the psychic energy fluctuations inside the water ball.</p>

    <p>So the people on the left and right sighed again: "Hey. It is indeed the Golden Core, Master Yuan Zun..."</p>

    <p>"How did Hong Siqi get injured?" Mi XiuYuan Zun was dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>He originally wanted to repay Yi Jianchuan's favor for not killing Hong Siqi, so he agreed to Yi Jianchuan's slap.</p>

    <p>The result is now good. Hong Siqi was directly seriously injured.</p>

    <p>And maybe after recovering from the injury, there is still the possibility of regression.</p>

    <p>The most important thing is that he is the creditor and the owner!</p>

    <p>Hong Siqi hasn't paid off the loan yet!</p>

    <p>To sum up, on his own side, blood loss...</p>

    <p>"Lord Yuan Zun, I have something I don't know whether to say or not."</p>

    <p>"Say!" Mi XiuYuan Zun was annoyed. His whole heart felt like a knife.</p>

    <p>"That's right. We actually tracked a very special spiritual signal just now... It seems to be coming from the restricted sea area. Therefore, it is possible that someone in the restricted sea area has been hiding in it beforehand. Judging by the form. He used the disciples of the Sword Master to beat Hong Siqi like this. "</p>

    <p>The man analyzed: "You see, General Maiko Assi is also missing in the restricted area of the sea. And so far there is no news. The Pope has hired credible people to investigate. I suspect. General Maiko Assi may have been poisoned by this person."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>In less than a few days.</p>

    <p>Mixiu Country. Two new Venerated Immortals. One is missing. The other is seriously injured.</p>

    <p>Mi XiuYuan Zun was holding fire in his heart.</p>

    <p>He was so angry that he immediately slammed the table: "Organize a fleet! Enter the restricted sea area! I want to see who is causing trouble in there! If you have the ability, step forward!"</p>

    <p>This anger.</p>

    <p>Also means.</p>

    <p>The restricted area of the sea where no one normally intrudes is about to become lively...</p>
