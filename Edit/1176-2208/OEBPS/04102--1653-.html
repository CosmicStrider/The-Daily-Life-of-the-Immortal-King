  <h1>Chapter 1653 Reflection under the Light of Buddha</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After seeing Hei Long appear, Jin Deng's eyesight could actually tell that this Hei Long was similar to the ancient divine weapon he had seen before.</p>

    <p>The "Power of Shura Hell" spell is a magic spell originating from the ancient times.</p>

    <p>Since the internal parts of Hei Long were created from the same material as the ancient divine weapons from the eons of time, it makes sense that the creator would input spells that would only appear in the eons of time into his memory.</p>

    <p>It's just that this move is a magic spell. It's a bit beyond Jin Deng's expectation.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, the 40 version of the consecration technique on Jiugong Liangzi is powerful enough and will not cause any damage to the body.</p>

    <p>When the black curse marks spread up from the soles of the feet like tentacles, Jiugong Liangzi instinctively felt a sense of being restrained. This spell seemed to affect the mental will. Jiugong Liangzi's vision gradually began to become blurred.</p>

    <p>When the monk used the "40 enlightenment technique" on her earlier, he hinted at the mechanism of the technique's "repayment."</p>

    <p>Now, Jiugong Liangzi feels that the time is completely ripe.</p>

    <p>"Repay your wish... I want to return your wish..."</p>

    <p>At the moment when his consciousness gradually became blurred, Jiugong Liangzi almost said in his heart with a weak spiritual will.</p>

    <p>The words just fell.</p>

    <p>A burst of golden light erupted from beneath her cloak.</p>

    <p>Jin Deng's voice sounded in her mind: "Miss Liangzi, please don't worry. The poor monk is here. The poor monk will temporarily control your body with Buddha's will."</p>

    <p>"Um."</p>

    <p>After the brief exchange, the golden light emanating from Jiugong Liangzi became even brighter.</p>

    <p>Under the blessing of the most holy power of Buddhism, seemingly boundless Buddha light flowed out from every pore of Jiugong Liangzi's body. At the same time, Sanskrit words invisible to the naked eyes of ordinary monks lingered around Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>Almost in this brief moment, the cells in Jiugong Liangzi's body became stronger with the blessing of Buddha's intention! The spirit was also supplemented by Jin Deng's Buddha's intention, and some false and evil forces were quickly dissolved!</p>

    <p>"The evil spirits are gone..."</p>

    <p>Jin Deng burst out Buddhist sounds through Jiugong Liangzi's mouth.</p>

    <p>Buzz! A sound!</p>

    <p>A ripple spread out in all directions with Jiugong Liangzi as the center!</p>

    <p>This is the purifying light of Buddha's will!</p>

    <p>Moreover, it is managed by the "Holy Saint of Buddhism" himself!</p>

    <p>Faced with this powerful purifying force, Hei Long's "power of Shura Hell" was completely useless. It was quickly defeated with a devastating force.</p>

    <p>Essentially, the "Power of Shura Hell" spell is something with the power of "withering", "weakness" and "aging." It affects the mind and then acts on human cells.</p>

    <p>But this magic spell was understood by the original creators from the daily lives of human cultivators.</p>

    <p>No one would have thought that someone would actually seek inspiration from "lazy cancer" and "procrastination", which are common diseases among modern cultivators.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, Jin Deng took action in time.</p>

    <p>Blessed by the great Buddha's Dharma, the powerful purifying Buddha's light swept across the entire venue. At this moment, the boiling underground boxing ring fell into a brief tranquility.</p>

    <p>After all, it was the powerful power exerted by the sage of Buddhism. Everyone in the boxing ring suddenly began to reflect on the wrong things they had done recently.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, Jin Deng heard the voices of many people confessing and it came to his mind.</p>

    <p>"Ah. I shouldn't have spent so much money on betting... I should have saved that much money. I know. Betting is bad behavior..."</p>

    <p>"If I had known better, I wouldn't have bought so many things in the shopping street. I can barely fit in the express boxes at home."</p>

    <p>"Hey. If I hadn't returned my wife's express delivery, maybe I wouldn't have divorced."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Of course, among the many confessions, Jin Deng also heard some familiar voices...</p>

    <p>"I shouldn't have said Yinzi's area was small a while ago. Now after seeing Liangzi. I really think I was so wrong. Anyway. Why does Zhuo Yi like it so much...? Since there's nothing available. Why don't you just find a man?"</p>

    <p>"I should be more bold. Liangzi's hands alone still can't satisfy me very well.</p>

    <p>Men should be more honest sometimes. I never thought that Liangzi would be jealous for me. She is such a cute girl." If I had known before carrying out this mission, I should have followed what that guy Gu Shunzhi said. Just make some noodles. Otherwise, I wouldn't have jumped the world line and come to this strange place."</p>

    <p>"Hey. Even if I admire Brother Zhuo, I shouldn't secretly take photos of him every day. If I continue like this, I feel like I'm almost turning into a voyeur. My sister-in-law is so jealous. What if she misunderstands me and Brother Zhuo?. What should we do?"</p>

    <p>"The corset is really tightening me up. The chest part is really tight. Although my classmate Wang Ling's milk candy is very sweet. But I really can't eat too much at once... He gave me a sack of them last time. That much! So it's true. You like me, don't you? But this candy is a little too potent. But it's only temporary. And with the tights on. Liangzi won't be able to tell. Otherwise she'd be jealous..."</p>

    <p>"To be called a man in a place like this. That's not very honorable. As expected. That area. You have to have a lot of meat to be a woman. Anyway. Rongrong seems to have gotten bigger there... And she's obviously wearing tights! Oh my god! I can't believe she's wearing tights! I should have asked before I came here. I should have been honest and asked her how she was doing it."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Although. It sounds like some weird reflections.</p>

    <p>But I can only say that Monk Jin Deng is worthy of being Monk Jin Deng.</p>

    <p>Even though he heard these things, it still gave these friends enough face. He did not make any comments in his heart.</p>

    <p>Monks are pure-hearted and have few desires. They do not understand the love between men and women in the world...</p>

    <p>Therefore, he just pretended that nothing happened.</p>

    <p>At the scene, everyone was in a state of reflection, making the overall atmosphere present a state of silence. This shocked Hei Long.</p>

    <p>"You... who are you?"</p>

    <p>Hei Long felt that his brain was in chaos. His magic spell had failed. And he was affected by the backlash under Jin Deng's purifying Buddha's light.</p>

    <p>His steps began to become frivolous. He began to stagger around in the field as if he was drunk.</p>

    <p>There was a pop.</p>

    <p>A loud kneeling sound broke the silence of the scene.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Hei Long was kneeling in the boxing ring. The whites of his eyes, which were completely occupied by black, gradually revealed the whites of human eyes.</p>

    <p>Hei Long's hands were trembling. He stared at his palms. His pupils shrank slightly. A question began to echo in his heart: "I... who am I..."</p>

    <p>Yes.</p>

    <p>Just at this moment.</p>

    <p>A reflective question also appeared in Hei Long's mind.</p>

    <p>He was reflecting on who he was, why he appeared in this world... and where he came from.</p>

    <p>And when these questions unfolded in his mind, Hei Long searched through his seemingly rich memories. Only to find that there was nothing but killing in his mind.</p>

    <p>The rest is a blank...</p>
