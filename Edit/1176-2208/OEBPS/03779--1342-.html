  <h1>Chapter 1342 Wang Ying's Punishment</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The moment he was dragged out by Wang Ying, Sun Ying'er already realized that something was wrong.</p>

    <p>In front of this man who existed like a tyrant, she was completely unable to display any abilities. She was like a fish on the chopping board... No, maybe more pitiful than a fish!</p>

    <p>At least the fish can still struggle. But she doesn't seem to even have the right to struggle...</p>

    <p>"I knew it. You wouldn't be honest."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying took Sun Ying'er's hand and dragged the girl quickly through the earth's atmosphere to the moon.</p>

    <p>The spirit of the moon was frightened...</p>

    <p>He was repaired to 780% by Wang Ling last time. Wang Ling rushed to do other things.</p>

    <p>The remaining damaged parts of the Moon Spirit had to heal themselves.</p>

    <p>This will make Wang Ying bring Sun Ying'er to the moon. The moon spirit suddenly felt a sense of despair in his heart.</p>

    <p>He was afraid that Wang Ying would use his infamous {Planet thumping technique} again...</p>

    <p>In the entire extraterrestrial area to the west of the Milky Way, the spirits of the major planets were wailing all over the place due to Wang Ying's extremely overbearing tactics. However, they had no way to complain. There was no way to report it.</p>

    <p>After landing on the moon, Wang Ying felt the ground beneath his feet tremble slightly. He immediately knew what the Moon Spirit was thinking.</p>

    <p>He smiled: "Yue Ling, don't worry. I'm just borrowing a place today. I won't cause any harm to you."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, the Moon Spirit breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>"You, can you please stop being so rude every time..." Sun Ying'er pretended to be scratched and stabbed by Wang Ying. In fact, Wang Ying's little strength could not really scratch Sun Ying'er. er.</p>

    <p>After all, he is the Lord of the Void. How can his physical fitness be so fragile?</p>

    <p>"I told you to be honest, but you didn't listen, so I had to treat you this way."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying scratched Sun Ying'er's claw marks with his thumb: "If you don't have a long memory, you will suffer a big loss in the end. Have you forgotten the mark I left on you? As long as I want. No matter when, what I can track you wherever you are!"</p>

    <p>"Hmph. Don't talk too much. Anyway, it's too late to say anything now! Rongrong already knows everything!"</p>

    <p>"So what if you know?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ying shrugged indifferently: "Anyway, your master is just a piece of wood. He can't have feelings for others."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er was in disbelief when he heard these words: "You all know that you still..."</p>

    <p>But soon. Sun Ying'er figured it out immediately.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying did it on purpose!</p>

    <p>He would have arrived a long time ago. He would not follow the orders!</p>

    <p>That's why I set up this trap and waited for her to get out of it!</p>

    <p>The reason is to wait for her to make a mistake and then punish her...</p>

    <p>Eh... so perverted!</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er couldn't help but shuddered when she thought of this. Goosebumps all over her body.</p>

    <p>"Heh. You finally found out?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ying suddenly stepped forward and pushed Sun Ying'er directly to the ground of the moon.</p>

    <p>He grabbed the girl's wrist, raised it above her head, intertwined their fingers, and suppressed her tightly.</p>

    <p>The extremely familiar wall-dong posture made Sun Ying'er's heart beat faster instantly.</p>

    <p>The girl blushed and turned her face to the side: "You promised... there will be no wall-dong today..."</p>

    <p>"This is to help you recall the previous punishment. The mistake you made today is worth 407 planet wall slams. I have already remembered it."</p>

    <p>"Why 407 times!!! So spicy!!!" Sun Ying'er protested.</p>

    <p>"I'm happy. I decided the number arbitrarily." Wang Ying chuckled: "If you are more honest in the future, I can reduce the sentence."</p>

    <p>"Then it's better to just avoid jail!" Sun Ying'er felt that he had seized the opportunity.</p>

    <p>"It is impossible to avoid punishment. Otherwise, wouldn't my planets be repaired in vain?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ying said, "Earlier, I grabbed you and crashed thousands of planets in the deep western part of the Extraterrestrial Galaxy. It was indeed a bit too much. So now, I've already sent a split body over to fix it. It will probably be repaired tomorrow. Once it's fixed, I'll bring you over for your punishment."</p>

    <p>In Wang Ying's opinion, punishment must be necessary when dealing with a dishonest woman like Sun Ying'er who is full of rebellious accusations.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er looked aggrieved: "Why do you understand... I think it will be executed the day after tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, the day after tomorrow. It's the same! You have to give me a chance to reduce my sentence!"</p>

    <p>"I don't want you to feel. I want me to feel."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying pinched Sun Ying'er's cheek, which looked thin but felt good to the touch. She carefully felt the soft touch from her fingertips.</p>

    <p>He felt that the girl was about to cry from being squeezed by him. He couldn't help but laugh in his heart: "Are you a fruit? Water will flow when you squeeze it? The Lord of the Void loves to shed tears so much?"</p>

    <p>"Who... who is crying!" Sun Ying'er pursed her lips and puffed up her cheeks, trying to hold back her tears.</p>

    <p>"Very good." Wang Ying gently brushed away the tears hanging on the girl's eyelashes: "In the future, you are not allowed to cry in front of me. This is the fourth rule I have set for you."</p>

    <p>"Devil! You are the devil!"</p>

    <p>Except for devil. Sun Ying'er feels like he can't find any words to describe Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>"It seems that your understanding of me is not very clear."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying released Sun Ying'er's hand.</p>

    <p>A man and a woman remained in a posture of banging against the wall for an unknown amount of time.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wang Ying stood up from the ground and said, "In addition, my Lord, I have something to ask you."</p>

    <p>"Hmph. Who's going to tell you! The devil is a pervert! No! It's a perverted devil!" Sun Ying'er cursed angrily in a very soft voice, as if he had exhausted all his strength.</p>

    <p>However, in Wang Ying's opinion, this kind of scolding sounds like coquettishness.</p>

    <p>Not only will it not anger others, but it will make Wang Ying feel like he wants to bully Sun Ying'er.</p>

    <p>He tried hard to restrain his urge to "bully" Sun Ying'er. He tried to use a calm tone and said: "That's a good answer. The sentence can be reduced. You should consider it."</p>

    <p>"I said!" Sun Ying'er nodded quickly.</p>

    <p>When she thought about the 407 planet wall bangs tomorrow... her despair could almost be written on her face!</p>

    <p>At this critical moment, it would be better if we could reduce it a little.</p>

    <p>"After you become the Lord of the Void, what will the old Lord of the Void do?" Wang Ying asked.</p>

    <p>"Of course it's retirement! The void creatures can't die anyway." Sun Ying'er replied.</p>

    <p>"Very good." Wang Ying nodded with satisfaction: "I have a second question."</p>

    <p>"Why don't you tell me first... I may not know..."</p>

    <p>"Do you know anything about the fortune teller? Since you are Miss Sun's shadow, I think you may have heard something about the fortune teller."</p>

    <p>"Isn't he just a charlatan? I've seen what he looks like."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er said.</p>

    <p>But as she spoke, her mind suddenly went blank. She couldn't think of anything!</p>

    <p>This feeling made Sun Ying'er extremely frightened: "That's wrong! It's obviously in my mind... But why... I suddenly can't remember it!"</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er's expression was extremely anxious. Tears began to roll in his eyes again.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying judged that Sun Ying'er was not uncooperative on purpose this time, so he did not blame him too much.</p>

    <p>But he couldn't understand why Sun Ying'er was so anxious. He was so anxious that he almost cried.</p>

    <p>"It's okay if you can't remember it. I don't blame you." Wang Ying said.</p>

    <p>"Really?" Sun Ying'er couldn't believe it.</p>

    <p>"Really." Wang Ying nodded.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying can actually speak human words.</p>

    <p>She was afraid that she didn't answer just now and Wang Ying would punish her again.</p>

    <p>"Then how much can my sentence be reduced by the answer I just gave?" At this time, Sun Ying'er asked.</p>

    <p>"406." Wang Ying replied.</p>

    <p>"406? So many!" Sun Ying'er was instantly surprised.</p>

    <p>"No. There are 406 times left. The sentence is reduced by 1 time. Based on the value of the answer you just answered. It's only worth that much."</p>

    <p>"Wang Ying, just wait. Sooner or later, I will definitely escape to a place where you can't catch me..." Sun Ying'er stared at Wang Ying, with an angry little mouth and gritted teeth.</p>

    <p>"You can try." Wang Ying spread his hands and showed a confident smile.</p>
