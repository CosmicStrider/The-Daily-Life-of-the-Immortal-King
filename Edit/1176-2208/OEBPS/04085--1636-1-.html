  <h1>Chapter 1636 What did you say you did to provoke him?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The strategic reserve of talents is something that every sect will do. The key point is whether both parties to the transaction pay enough attention to talents.</p>

    <p>It is also common for some small sects to let go of big fish for the immediate benefit.</p>

    <p>Li Huayu is a talent hand-picked by Crispy Noodles Dao Lord. Keorn will not worry about his quality in all aspects.</p>

    <p>But compared to other sects, the Office of Strategic Deception is poaching. This is not an easy task.</p>

    <p>Let me ask you, how could a super sect fall in love with a disciple of a Xuan-level sect?</p>

    <p>If you dig too blatantly, you will only alert others. This Li Huayu is a rare talent. I want to book the Office of Strategic Deception!</p>

    <p>In this way, Li Huayu's worth will be quickly raised to an extremely high level in a short period of time. In the end, it will put the Office of Strategic Deception in a passive situation.</p>

    <p>"Have you, Zhenjun, thought about poaching people? I don't think it's easy." Keorn said, staring at Li Huayu on the screen.</p>

    <p>"Xiao Yin." Crispy Noodles Dao Lord said bluntly.</p>

    <p>"Xiao Yin? That Captain Silver?" Keorn actually didn't know Xiao Yin very well. He came to the Office of Strategic Deception not long ago. Many sect elders and disciples didn't recognize him.</p>

    <p>But he does know this "Captain Silver."</p>

    <p>This is a member of the core team of the Office of Strategic Deception. It also manages matters related to the spirit beast group.</p>

    <p>And he knew that this Captain Silver had been living in Lord Diulei's house after the Office of Strategic Deception was established before he had his own Spirit Beast Peak.</p>

    <p>Including now. After the completion of Spirit Beast Peak, it is said that the mysterious Captain Silver still likes to live in the same old place.</p>

    <p>"Captain Silver. Is he any good? He's always so cool..." Keorn didn't know much about Xiao Yin. This statement made Crispy Noodle chuckle.</p>

    <p>Xiao Yin...cold?</p>

    <p>Of course that doesn't exist...</p>

    <p>In the entire Office of Strategic Deception, except for Ling Zhenren, can anyone find a more lively and lovely person than Xiao Yin?</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Lord thinks he has no.</p>

    <p>The affinity inherent in being born as a holy beast is the key to Xiao Yin's negotiation.</p>

    <p>And as the leader of the Spiritual Beast Group, when he goes to other sects, most of them come for Lingyi. Basically, it is difficult to think that he comes to poach people...</p>

    <p>"Well, of course the True Lord has his own considerations. Just watch the show." Crispy Noodles Dao Lord said.</p>

    <p>He counted with his fingers and stared at the screen in front of him.</p>

    <p>It should be almost time now.</p>

    <p>Liu Renfeng Over there. I guess I'm about to get excited...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The underground passages of Fengchu Laboratory extend in all directions. The original purpose of Liu Renfeng was to establish an encrypted passage underground. On the other hand, it was also due to the layout considerations of the Number 2 backup plan.</p>

    <p>These underground passages extend for great distances.</p>

    <p>At this moment, all the artificial humans Liu Renfeng came out in full force. All of them carried a spirit stone and a formation flag on their backs.</p>

    <p>Li Xian and Zhang Zhui each cast an invisibility spell on themselves. They looked down from above the sky at a bird's eye view.</p>

    <p>You can clearly see the layout of the artificial humans Liu Renfeng after they have passed through each secret passage.</p>

    <p>The outermost layer of this secret passage extending in all directions is a very standard circle. You can tell it is a formation disk without even looking.</p>

    <p>It's just such a large-scale formation. It's definitely impossible for Liu Renfeng to do it with his own strength.</p>

    <p>"All things are transparent and vitality formation?" Li Xian carefully observed the layout and details of the formation. He quickly thought of the origin of this formation.</p>

    <p>This is a spiritual gathering array that can absorb the spiritual power of all cultivators within the array. It is divided into two types: active dedication and forced extraction.</p>

    <p>If a cultivator standing in the formation actively contributes, he only needs to raise his hands above his head.</p>

    <p>But Liu Renfeng obviously won't do that.</p>

    <p>In order to open the infinite secret realm, she can only forcefully extract it.</p>

    <p>"It seems that this is a real deal."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui said: "This Liu Renfeng really has a brother behind him. Just do not know what this brother is in the end. I recall...."</p>

    <p>"Master Wu Xin invented the Universal Brightness Energy Matrix. It is said that he only passes it on to his disciples..." But Master Wu Xin himself is now locked up in Corpse Map." Li Xian's mouth twitched. He looked rather helpless and said, "And that guy used to say every day that he wanted to take on disciples. But so far I haven't heard what kind of person his disciple is."</p>

    <p>Speaking of Master Wu Xin. In the eternal era, this one was also an all-powerful person.</p>

    <p>But unfortunately, Master Wu Xin has a small problem. He is very stingy.</p>

    <p>There was a banquet. Master Wu Xin entertained everyone including Dao Ancestor Wang. In order to save money, he bought a lot of fake wine from a wine merchant and only gave Dao Ancestor Wang real wine to drink.</p>

    <p>The result was so good that Dao Ancestor Wang's wine gourd was somehow tampered with during the banquet...</p>

    <p>Then only five sounds of "ton ton ton ton ton ton" were heard. This gourd of fake wine was completely drank by Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>And then. There will be no more...</p>

    <p>Dao Ancestor Wang, who drank the fake wine, put Master Wu Xin and the wine dealer who sold the fake wine into the Corpse Map on the spot.</p>

    <p>Now look back on that history.</p>

    <p>Li Xian couldn't help but sigh.</p>

    <p>A good person. Why did you provoke him?</p>

    <p>At this moment.</p>

    <p>On the battlefield in the northern suburbs that had been silent for a long time, a burst of exclamations suddenly came from the battlefield.</p>

    <p>"What is this..."</p>

    <p>Some monks noticed something was wrong. The expressions on the faces of those heaven-level sect leaders all looked terrified.</p>

    <p>"It's a big formation! A big formation that can cover the northern suburbs!"</p>

    <p>"What? How could this Liu Renfeng have the ability to arrange such a large formation?"</p>

    <p>They all looked panicked on their faces. Keorn at the command post was also confused.</p>

    <p>Because these are all things within the scope of the plan...</p>

    <p>As a result, I didn't expect that these heaven-level sect leaders and their disciples were all acting talents. Everyone contributed their outstanding acting skills at this moment and performed it to the extreme...</p>

    <p>"Uh. My spiritual power. My spiritual power was taken away..."</p>

    <p>"No. I feel my life passing..."</p>

    <p>The cultivators trapped in the formation screamed one after another, showing expressions of death.</p>

    <p>In fact, their spiritual power has not been drained away.</p>

    <p>The spiritual power absorbed by Liu Renfeng is all provided by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>At this moment, he was squatting at the entrance of the secret realm.</p>

    <p>While reading the exercises in front of you, raise your hands to channel your spiritual power.</p>

    <p>"It's done!" Shou Chong Laboratory. Liu Renfeng showed a surprised expression through the artificial human.</p>

    <p>The spiritual power absorbed through the magic circle was too huge! It was far beyond his imagination!</p>

    <p>"Hahahahaha!" She couldn't help laughing wildly: "I didn't expect that Liu Renfeng actually succeeded! This world of cultivation will soon usher in a new year of Fengchu! Then I will be Liu Renfeng opens a new era!"</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the controlled artificial man quickly returned to silence.</p>

    <p>It seems that Liu Renfeng has withdrawn the spiritual link to the main body and is preparing to take action on its own.</p>

    <p>Shou Chong was pinned to the ground by several androids and could not move. At this moment, he was completely despairing. He only felt that the situation was over...</p>

    <p>Buzz! A sound!</p>

    <p>When the entrance to the secret realm opened at the preset location of Liu Renfeng, the crazy woman rubbed her hands and stepped in with excitement on her face.</p>

    <p>She thought she would see a gorgeous new world when she opened the door.</p>

    <p>What came into view was a young man doing homework at his desk.</p>

    <p>Liu Renfeng laughed: "I didn't expect that there would be a doorman in this infinite secret realm?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ling raised his head and looked at her. After confirming that this was Liu Renfeng's true form, he locked the secret door behind Liu Renfeng with just one look. It's blocked.</p>

    <p>A terrible oppressive force. At this moment, it extinguished all the excitement in Liu Renfeng...</p>

    <p>Wait a minute!</p>

    <p>This situation seems a little bit wrong?</p>
