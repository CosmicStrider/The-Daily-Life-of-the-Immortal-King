  <h1>Chapter 1413 Death Heavenly Dao's blood lock</h1>

  <div>

    <p>If you can access the Internet now, Fan Xing would like to post a post asking how to ensure that he survives a rapid fall from a height of several thousand meters when he only has two fireball talismans.</p>

    <p>But it is a pity that Fan Xing seems to have no chance to regret now...</p>

    <p>So that night, a meteorite fell into Xinxing Apartment, causing the entire apartment building to be destroyed. News that the owner of the apartment building ejected and fled with his employees in an emergency spread throughout the Internet.</p>

    <p>The miraculous operation of just launching and not landing immediately aroused new public opinion.</p>

    <p>As the saying goes, when Brother Hei smiles, life or death is unpredictable.</p>

    <p>Created by Brother Chong. It ascends to the sky and explodes.</p>

    <p>Designer of apartment building. "Shou Chong" is popular...</p>

    <p>In this accident, only Fan Xing survived.</p>

    <p>He used the last two fireball talismans on his body to impact the ground the moment he landed, forming a reverse propulsion force for buffering.</p>

    <p>This action saved Fan Xing's life. Although he did not die, in the eyes of outsiders, this state would be better than death...</p>

    <p>"Why is it him again..."</p>

    <p>When the ambulance from the First Military Medical Hospital of Songhai City arrived at the scene, the emergency doctor saw the dying young man lying on the ground in front of him. He couldn't help but look in shock.</p>

    <p>He was deeply impressed by Fan Xing. After all, not all men have the experience of having their ribs pierced through their balls...</p>

    <p>Fan Xing recovered and was discharged from the hospital two days ago. The emergency doctor also paid special attention to it. He thought it was a miracle in the history of medicine.</p>

    <p>And this kind of miracle should be unlikely to happen again...</p>

    <p>But now. The emergency doctor decided to take back his words.</p>

    <p>Using portable scanning tools, emergency doctors began preliminary identification and treatment of Fan Xing.</p>

    <p>The situation is very not optimistic.</p>

    <p>The last time the procedure was performed, it was just a comminuted fracture of the skull.</p>

    <p>And now, apart from the head, the whole body has slime-like fractures...</p>

    <p>The so-called slime fracture means that it is more exaggerated than a comminuted fracture. Almost all the bones in his body were crushed into powder... The whole person was like a puddle of slime.</p>

    <p>"Slime fractures all over the body. Cases like this are rare." One of the accompanying medical staff sighed.</p>

    <p>"To be honest, with such an injury, it would be better to be beaten into ashes. It might be easier to bear. If the force is strong enough to shoot someone into ashes, the person who is beaten into ashes will not feel any pain..."</p>

    <p>So, Fan Xing's current situation is actually slightly better than turning it into ashes.</p>

    <p>Might as well die.</p>

    <p>Even if he can be rescued, he is destined to be tortured.</p>

    <p>In fact, it's not just a matter of bones.</p>

    <p>After the emergency doctor checked, he found that Fan Xing's organs were severely damaged: "The organs were ruptured. There was massive bleeding in the body. The egg slurry and blood were fused together..."</p>

    <p>With such serious injuries, he could basically be declared dead under normal circumstances.</p>

    <p>But what the emergency doctors couldn't believe was that Fan Xing was still breathing...</p>

    <p>Everything is the same as last time.</p>

    <p>The injury is obviously serious!</p>

    <p>But Fan Xing just kept talking...</p>

    <p>"This vitality is so tenacious!" the emergency doctor sighed.</p>

    <p>Although Fan Xing's injuries were serious, his heart rate was actually stable.</p>

    <p>What a hell!</p>

    <p>He spat secretly.</p>

    <p>Blood-locking plug-ins are not that outrageous!</p>

    <p>Fan Xing certainly doesn't have the ability to "lock blood."</p>

    <p>This is just a continuation of the curse that Death Heavenly Dao left for Fan Xing last time...</p>

    <p>As long as Fan Xing has evil thoughts about Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>The curse of "Death is coming" will always exist.</p>

    <p>And because Fan Xing will put all the resentment on "Sun Rong."</p>

    <p>Ever since. The curse of Death Heavenly Dao has become a kind of perpetual motion.</p>

    <p>So in fact. Even if Sun Rong did not send out the split body Aohai.</p>

    <p>Fan Xing will end miserably in the end...</p>

    <p>"How about it? Do you want to take it back... I don't think it can be cured if you take it back."</p>

    <p>"This brother was also in our hospital before. He directly charged 200 million into our account. So you don't have to worry about the medical expenses." The emergency doctor said: "Besides, we are doctors. Since we are doctors, it is our bounden duty to save people's lives. No matter how difficult this person is to save...so...carry him away!"</p>

    <p>He greeted the medical staff around him.</p>

    <p>This is his second time saving Fan Xing.</p>

    <p>Faced with the man's tenacious vitality, all the accompanying doctors were moved...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, in the secret realm of the universe of the Ageless Star, the girl successfully replaced the fourth Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube. At the same time, she integrated the fourth old Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube into Aohai.</p>

    <p>At this point. Aohai has become a quad-core spiritual sword.</p>

    <p>The Ageless Star is a beautiful place. The temperature is pleasant, and the seven-colored clouds in the sky are as gorgeous as the Northern Lights. This is the legendary Peach Blossom Land in the secret realm of the universe. It is a secret place that is very suitable for vacation.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er is holding a cotton-like snow-white creature. This is an immortal star. A creature with a soft body like cotton wool. It is said that each immortal star has a life span of tens of thousands of years... They seem to be able to survive here. Eternal life. Never grow old.</p>

    <p>"What a magical place."Sun Rong sighed.</p>

    <p>If it weren't for the task of collecting the Rubik's Cube, she might never have known that such a beautiful resort existed in the universe...</p>

    <p>"Eternal Star was originally a place suitable for human habitation. However, it was also transformed by Dao Ancestor Wang. It was used for his own vacation." Er Ha said.</p>

    <p>The Eternal Stars are very amiable. They have lived here for generations without fighting against the world.</p>

    <p>No one has ever seen an immortal star angry.</p>

    <p>Because of this, the Ageless Star is also called the "Honest Star."</p>

    <p>This alias was given by Dao Ancestor Wang. Er Ha felt that this alias might have a purpose.</p>

    <p>After all, sometimes, once an honest person is angered, it will be a terrible thing.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid it might cause a catastrophe...</p>

    <p>But fortunately, regarding the replacement of the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube, the Eternal Stars are generally quite cooperative.</p>

    <p>They can't speak. They all use their mind to convey information.</p>

    <p>Guided Sun Rong and others along the way. They successfully completed the task of replacing the Rubik's Cube.</p>

    <p>Quad-core Aohai. Even more powerful.</p>

    <p>This powerful power is now in the hands of a girl in the Foundation Building stage. No one else may be able to imagine it.</p>

    <p>"Rongrong. You are going to be invincible!" Sun Ying'er chuckled.</p>

    <p>However, the girl's expression did not look as relaxed as expected: "I feel that everything seems to be going too smoothly..."</p>

    <p>She was worried that something would happen next.</p>

    <p>Although there are no mistakes in the task of replacing the Rubik's Cube.</p>

    <p>But that faint feeling of worry always lingered in the girl's heart.</p>

    <p>"I feel like you are thinking too much, Rongrong. Even if something happens, Ling Zhenren will still be there to hold up the sky if it falls."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er comforted: "Tomorrow is the Sword Conference. I think you should think about how to perform better in the Sword Conference! I will practice sword practice with you tonight! I will teach you a new sword technique! I guarantee a sure win. !"</p>

    <p>"New swordsmanship?"</p>

    <p>"This is the inspiration I found from the {dog beating stick method} in martial arts novels. It's called the Whirlwind Dog Sword!"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "?"</p>
