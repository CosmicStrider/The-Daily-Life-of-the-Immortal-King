  <h1>Chapter 2111 The Wall Breaker of the Magic Ring World</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The reason Wang Ling chose [waste] is very simple. Because this profession does not have so many bells and whistles. And the attribute distribution is balanced. It comes with five attributes at the beginning. Each basic attribute is assigned 1 point. It can be said that it is a balanced career.</p>

    <p>As for the equipment, it's even simpler.</p>

    <p>After entering the game world, Wang Ling clicked on his [Inventory] and took a look. The white rough cloth in the character list was extremely conspicuous. It made him look a bit like a country boy who came out of the wilderness. Apart from the hairstyle, there is nothing modern about him. He is just a pure savage.</p>

    <p>Although his background is in a small town, the conditions created for him by this profession are indeed very poor. He started with one piece of clothing and nothing else.</p>

    <p>In Bai Qiao's {Itinerant Immortal Magic Circle}, when the player selects a character, the opening plot is different. Each career's opening will have a hundred sets of openings that match the character's story background and personality. Then In the following plot, the options will be continuously arranged and combined to determine the final direction of the story.</p>

    <p>So. This also means that the task options after Wang Ling cannot be selected blindly.</p>

    <p>For example, his start is like this now.</p>

    <p>Originally the son of a noble family, he was ostracized because of his weak physique.</p>

    <p>So, without sufficient guarantee of resources, the protagonist decided to go to the city to work, intending to earn money by working with his own hands and earn training funds. After entering the town, the young protagonist quickly found a job of harvesting immortal grass. However, because he was too young, his salary was maliciously deducted by the unscrupulous boss in the final stage of settlement. This led to a conflict with the boss.</p>

    <p>Because the difference in strength was too big. In the end, the protagonist was punished by the boss without saying a word. And because he had a fight with the boss first, he was now taken into the government office. He needed to be locked up for three days as punishment...</p>

    <p>After reading the basic background introduction, Wang Ling's heart was almost filled with uncontrollable flaws.</p>

    <p>It is indeed in line with the background setting of the "waste" profession. At the beginning, it gives people a strong sense of "don't bully young people who are poor." And then in the end, you will either plummet to the bottom. Then he will directly attack and slap all sentient beings in the face.</p>

    <p>This is the life of "waste" people under normal circumstances...</p>

    <p>After all, {Itinerant Immortal} is a game masterpiece designed with cultivation as its background. As for the character content of cultivation, Qidian novels alone can provide too much material to count.</p>

    <p>So. Are there 100 ways to start a career?</p>

    <p>I'm afraid this is just rare.</p>

    <p>At this time Wang Ling suddenly became curious.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong. What career did she choose?</p>

    <p>During the game, he and Sun Rong are independent individuals. Only when they meet can they have normal conversations.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, they have to wait for Wang Ming to step in as a third party and give them a hint.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is actually quite curious. And he also knows that Wang Ming must be observing everything secretly. Now he found out. Wang Ming is really a little bit bad... With Wang Ming's IQ, he would not have guessed what he is thinking about?</p>

    <p>As a result, he didn't even say a word to him, which made Wang Ling feel a little depressed.</p>

    <p>The next second, a rather unbeatable voice came over: "Ling Ling, do you want a guide? You can ask me."</p>

    <p>Of course Wang Ling has a complete set of strategies in his hands. Jingke went to Bai Qiao specifically to get them. But each profession has 100 sets of opening methods. So the total number is 1,000 sets of openings.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that since they are playing a game, it would be boring if he knew the optimal solution in advance according to the guide.</p>

    <p>So he didn't look at it at all.</p>

    <p>According to the normal strategy, the protagonist needs to bribe the prison chief of the Office to gain freedom in advance. After all, if he is really imprisoned here for three days, the protagonist may not be able to survive that long with his useless physique.</p>

    <p>What's more, he was beaten at the beginning.</p>

    <p>The health is only 70 points.</p>

    <p>And in the hungry state, 5 blood points will be deducted every hour...</p>

    <p>So the most economical way is to survive these three days.</p>

    <p>Then increasing the upper limit of health is the key.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling took a look at his own condition. He didn't know if it was too late to practice push-ups now...</p>

    <p>But doing push-ups is an old trick, and Wang Ling thinks that since he is going to do something fancy, he must do it in a way that makes it more interesting.</p>

    <p>Although he doesn't know the strategy, he knows Bai Qiao very well. Bai Qiao and Jingke are from the same source. As the sword spirit and sheath spirit under his control, Wang Ling feels that in terms of writing the cultivation logic of this game. Bai Qiao must have more or less referenced a lot of Heavenly Dao's theories in it.</p>

    <p>In the current world of cultivation, it is no secret that all cultivation spells originated from Heavenly Dao. Almost all cultivation spells range from level 1 to level 10. Even super levels above level 10 have their roots from Heavenly Dao. It is the branches and leaves that extend from around this big tree trunk...</p>

    <p>When it comes to playing games. Wang Ling can't be said to be an expert, but he knows Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>If the programming logic of the game refers to some routes of the Way of Heaven, then most of the spells and the Heart Law King's Orders can be simulated independently.</p>

    <p>So...</p>

    <p>What are the mental methods or exercises to increase health?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought for a moment.</p>

    <p>Then he directly sat down cross-legged in the cell. His hands naturally dropped to his knees, and he began to try various mental techniques.</p>

    <p>In just three minutes, Wang Ling recited three exercises and mental formulas that can improve physical strength.</p>

    <p>He finished reading the first two exercises. There was no response from the characters in the game.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, by the time he reached the third exercise of "The Art of Descending Gods", his health bar value suddenly increased!</p>

    <p>From the initial 70 points to 80 points!</p>

    <p>And in the skill column, related displays about this skill also appeared. Bai Qiao simplified the name of this skill.</p>

    <p>God-level skill {God descends to earth} Passive attribute: God descends to earth can be superimposed passively by sitting cross-legged and reciting mantras. Each layer of passive provides 10 points of blood value. There is no upper limit for the number of layers. (Other ways to quickly superimpose passive: every hit killing a non-human creature counts as one stack. Each successful act of pretense counts as one stack)</p>

    <p>After seeing the detailed explanation, Wang Ling raised his eyebrows. It turns out that passive can be superimposed not only by reciting the mantra.</p>

    <p>But if you show off once and stack passive... how do you do this?</p>

    <p>He is used to keeping a low profile...</p>

    <p>He won't show off at all!</p>

    <p>Who will teach him how to act cool...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling suddenly felt a little pain in his brain.</p>

    <p>He was depressed in his heart. He could only use the most clumsy way to rely on silently reciting mental mantras to superimpose passivity. At the same time, he was thinking about how to show off correctly.</p>

    <p>Because he has memorized this mental method very well. This is originally something engraved in the DNA of Wang Ling. Therefore, it takes about 10-30 minutes for ordinary people to recite a complete article. And it still needs to ensure zero mistakes.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling only takes 1 minute. Or even dozens of seconds at the fastest.</p>

    <p>He sat cross-legged in the prison. He closed his eyes and meditated silently for a long time. Soon his health rose by 170.</p>

    <p>Already stacked 10 layers of passive.</p>

    <p>Nearly the initial HP of an ancient heavy-armored monk.</p>

    <p>However, he is not particularly satisfied with this value. Wang Ling feels that it is too slow to rely on memorization.</p>

    <p>At this time, the prison guard passed by him again.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling couldn't help but look over. After discovering that the opponent's health was only 100 points, he couldn't help but sigh: "100?"</p>

    <p>"What's wrong with 100? I've been practicing for 100 years. What's wrong?" The prisoner looked at Wang Ling jokingly and sneered.</p>

    <p>It turns out that "health" is "level" in the NPC's thinking mode.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling did not expect that his casual grunt could directly trigger an interaction with the prison boss.</p>

    <p>"Nothing..."</p>

    <p>He could only scratch his head in embarrassment and sigh again. His tone was still a bit careless: "I'm only 170. I'm only 70% more than you."</p>

    <p>What Wang Ling didn't expect was that after he said the truth, the original 10-level passive ability was directly increased by 1 point...</p>

    <p>Huh?</p>

    <p>Already added? </p>

    <p>Oh, I see.</p>

    <p>So this is what they call showing off?</p>
