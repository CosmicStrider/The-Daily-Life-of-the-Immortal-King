  <h1>Chapter 1849: Inviting God to Come Up</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ling has never seen what a real emperor looks like. Now the domineering, majestic and tough Emperor Dongda shows when facing invading enemies. It almost perfectly fits what Wang Ling thinks in his mind.</p>

    <p>He is aloof. He is not afraid even when facing a group of eternal beings with royal blood. The Suzaku fire in his eyes dims and flickers. There is a powerful chaotic energy flowing along with a secret power all over his body.</p>

    <p>This is the original Qi of the Great Emperor. It is actually the same type of substance as the original Qi in Wang Ling's body. Usually only those who hold the throne of the emperor have it.</p>

    <p>It's just that most of the original energy, including the emperor's original energy, has already been formed. It has an upper limit of strength. Wang Ling's original energy is incredible. There is no upper limit at all.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling has never felt this kind of power in any Eternal. Including the Skeleton Prince, Lion-headed Man, Meng Liuli and the like...leaving aside these three. Even Monk Jin Deng and Dao Peng Xiren, Ancestor Wang's true disciple, doesn't have this power either.</p>

    <p>He can only say that the Great Emperor level is worthy of being the Great Emperor level. It is truly different and extraordinary.</p>

    <p>"Who dares to act rashly..."</p>

    <p>At this time, Emperor Dongda said. His whole person was enveloped by the Suzaku fire. This is an unintentional and automatic protective ability. Any flying object that comes close to Emperor Dongda, including long-range spells and hidden weapons, will be destroyed the moment it approaches. The red bird fire burned it up.</p>

    <p>Then he stared at one of the few women in the queue in front. He muttered: "I didn't expect you to come too. Jiaoyang...you are from the same source as me. But now you turned against me in the enemy's camp. You have forgotten our ancestors. It's really ridiculous."</p>

    <p>Everyone below was stunned. The Goddess of the Sun... this was whom the Western Emperor spent a lot of money to win over. This was the first time that everyone heard that this most famous Immortal Son of the Flame Saint actually had the same origin as the Eastern Emperor.</p>

    <p>The Sun Goddess had a calm face. After hearing Emperor Dongda's words, she did not show the slightest anger on her face. She still maintained her graceful and charming posture. She took off her hood and stepped forward. That posture made the heroes around her dim.</p>

    <p>There is no doubt that the Sun Goddess is a strong contender for the throne of Dongda Emperor this time. She is the woman most likely to directly take the head of Dongda Emperor.</p>

    <p>She and Emperor Dongda are from the same origin. Naturally, she is very aware of the weaknesses of Emperor Dongda. Even the emperor-level powerhouses cannot be completely invincible. They also have fatal life gates. It's just that they are absolutely invincible. Most people just don't know it.</p>

    <p>"A good bird chooses a tree to roost in. The emperor's words are a bit like moral kidnapping. I have not grown up in the Eastern Region since I was a child. I have been wandering around. Apart from some dispensable bloodlines, there is nothing between you and me."</p>

    <p>She laughed and stared at Emperor Dongda: "As the emperor, you allow people of the same origin to wander and be homeless. Have you ever thought about how many people looked down upon me in the past?"</p>

    <p>"Your father conspired to rebel a long time ago. This is a serious crime. Out of kindness, I only punished your father and exiled your people..." Emperor Dongda spoke. His expression turned pale. It was obvious. The words he just said actually touched some of his pain.</p>

    <p>The past is unbearable to look back on. It is all in the past. Even Emperor Dongda himself never thought that a single thought of kindness would actually ignite this firework of revenge.</p>

    <p>"We are gathering today. So many people with imperial connections are gathered here. Emperor, you should know that you have no chance of winning today."</p>

    <p>When the Sun Goddess heard the old story, the expression on her face did not change at all. She still maintained a calm posture and looked at Yan Sanyang, who had turned into a charred corpse on the ground. Her eyes were sharp: "The emperor in the west gave you one last chance. It's a pity that you didn't cherish it properly."</p>

    <p>"Hmph! The majesty of the emperor. How can I tolerate provocation?"</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda's words were cold. He couldn't help but laugh out loud: "Since you all broke into my hall today, I have no choice but to kill you all!"</p>

    <p>"Boom!"</p>

    <p>The next moment, everyone in the hall tacitly understood each other and moved at the same time. Powerful spiritual energy collided in the air, forming a high pressure. The dome of the entire hall was about to be blown away.</p>

    <p>"Do it!"</p>

    <p>Someone shouted. The battle has begun. Then everyone has no scruples. Although some people know in their hearts that the Sun Goddess has a great chance of winning. But the battle for the title depends on everyone's ability. If there is a chance to find a leak behind the scenes. The first one to get the head of Emperor Dongda. Then he can also ascend to the throne of Emperor.</p>

    <p>At the same time, because of the presence of the Sun Goddess, they have no fear at all when facing the Eastern Emperor. This is the main output, and they only need to interfere from the side.</p>

    <p>In their opinion, there are many ways to win. Emperor Dongda has been on the throne for many years. His imperial energy has dried up and he has already entered his twilight years. No one thinks that Emperor Dongda can still be arrogant.</p>

    <p>Endless magic weapons flew across the sky, illuminating the upper part of the imperial palace in a brilliant way. All attacks were focused forward, aiming at Emperor Dongda.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the world was silent. All kinds of chaotic atmospheres intertwined, with a smell of death. Ye Ren, the white-robed manager, tried his best to protect him, but was rushed away by the Sun Goddess.</p>

    <p>"Nine-tailed Suzaku?" Ye Ren was shocked.</p>

    <p>That palm just now. He saw a nine-tailed Suzaku rushing out from the palm of the Sun Goddess. His face turned pale with horror. If Emperor Dongda didn't take action in time and used the power of his palm to push him away remotely, that palm just collided with him head-on. He will be killed directly.</p>

    <p>He couldn't believe it. The Goddess of the Sun possesses the Dharma of the Nine-tailed Suzaku... This is the top level of the Suzaku Kung Fu. Even Emperor Dongda has never understood it. Now it is only at the level of the Eight-tailed Suzaku.</p>

    <p>"That's not the Nine-tailed Suzaku! It's the fake Nine-tailed Suzaku!" A veteran of the East Imperial Palace was surrounded by several people during the battle. He vomited blood, but he could clearly see the scene just now.</p>

    <p>He was very sure that there was something different about the nine-tailed Suzaku, because the tails on the back of the Suzaku were not Suzaku feathers, but nine snake heads!</p>

    <p>Obviously, before coming here, the Western Emperor lent his power to the Sun Goddess!</p>

    <p>She had originally cultivated the six-tailed Suzaku. Now she was blessed by the power of the Western Emperor. No wonder she dared to lead the crowd to directly attack the Eastern Emperor's palace.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the Sun Goddess did not shy away. She once again showed the Hydra Suzaku Dharma, sweeping the entire place with a powerful aura. The Dharma Appearance was used. It shocked the world. With a powerful aura, many people in the air were on the verge of falling to the ground.</p>

    <p>This pressure is too strong. They are too close to the Sun Goddess. They can't even stabilize their figure flying in the air...</p>

    <p>"Defiled the Suzaku bloodline...how dare you do this!" A veteran of the East Emperor Palace was half-kneeling on the ground. He was shocked by the force and his seven holes were bleeding. He was so angry that he was shaking all over.</p>

    <p>"This is the power given to me by the emperor of the West. And power is just a tool. As long as I can win."</p>

    <p>The face of the Sun Goddess remained unchanged. She looked steadily at the Eastern Emperor in front of her. As soon as the Hydra Suzaku was used, the impact and crushing feeling of power. The Eastern Emperor was the most intuitive.</p>

    <p>In just a moment, he felt the energy and blood surging all over his body. Even the Suzaku fire protection on his body was ineffective.</p>

    <p>But what makes Wang Ling feel very strange is that even in the face of the current dead situation, Emperor Dongda still shows no fear.</p>

    <p>Could it be said that Emperor Dongda has another plan?</p>

    <p>He was hiding in Dongda's body. He was filled with doubts in his heart.</p>

    <p>The situation should be similar to what he reasoned...</p>

    <p>After all, there is a relatively complete battle record in {Dongda Diary}. If Dongda died here, he would not be able to complete this diary.</p>

    <p>And while Wang Ling was thinking, Emperor Dongda suddenly laughed at the goddess of the sun in front of him: "Sun...can I ask? Are you asking a god to come to you?"</p>

    <p>"It doesn't count. It's just borrowing power." The Sun Goddess shook her head. She was inexplicably confident. She stared at Emperor Dongda with a sinister look: "As long as I can kill you. Even if the emperor of the West wants my body, I have no complaints.This is the worst possible move... I would rather kill you myself."</p>

    <p>"Ha ha..."</p>

    <p>To everyone's surprise, Emperor Dongda laughed again when he heard this: "Do you think you are the only one who can ask gods to come to you?"</p>

    <p>Speaking of this, he had a thought in his mind.</p>

    <p>Immediately, a voice came from Wang Ling's mind: "Master! Why are you still standing there in a daze? Come on, help me!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "???"</p>
