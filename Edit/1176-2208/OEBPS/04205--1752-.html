  <h1>Chapter 1752 Unexpected Action</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche got 20 million in intelligence fees by selling Wang Muyu's photo. However, in fact, not long after he came out of Tengu, he met another intelligence dealer named Skunk.</p>

    <p>Yes.</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche did not leave Duobao City directly.</p>

    <p>Instead, use the newly obtained 20 million to use part of it to buy some inside information about stocks and funds so that I can trade in a timely manner and avoid being treated as leek.</p>

    <p>Skunk is a well-known traffic intelligence dealer in the Duobao City underground intelligence network. He does not belong to any force. He is a very rare solo operator. However, the accuracy of his intelligence information is quite high. It is no less than that of the Tengu.</p>

    <p>So many people are actually suspicious of Skunk. They think that Tengu has an informant from the Skunk branch.</p>

    <p>"You wait."</p>

    <p>Under the skunk's mask, Jiang Xiaoche heard a very sharp electronic sound. It went straight into his ears. Then a hand was put on his shoulder: "This gentleman, I have a new acquisition here. I received some information. I wonder if you are interested?"</p>

    <p>"Is it related to stock funds? Or are liquor stocks about to fall?" Under the mask, Jiang Xiaoche was extremely alert.</p>

    <p>"No. But you are definitely interested in my news. As long as you pay me five million first. If you are not interested after hearing this, I can refund half of it to you." Skunk chuckled.</p>

    <p>If it was an ordinary wandering information dealer, Jiang Xiaoche would naturally not believe it. But this person was a skunk.</p>

    <p>He was suspicious for a while, but finally went to the underground bank with Skunk and made the transfer according to the foreign account provided by Skunk.</p>

    <p>It wasn't until he saw the transfer receipt that Skunk handed a piece of paper back to Jiang Xiaoche: "Information. Right here."</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche opened the note. There were only a few words written on it: "Jiang Yingying, the adopted granddaughter of the Tenth General Martial Saint Jiang, was captured by the Tengu."</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche's scalp went numb immediately upon hearing the news.</p>

    <p>Jiang Yingying was captured?</p>

    <p>This...</p>

    <p>What's going on?</p>

    <p>His forehead was instantly covered with beads of sweat. He quickly wrote on the note and asked: "Why did the Tengu capture her?"</p>

    <p>The skunk saw the question. A sly smile appeared under the skunk's face: "It's still the old rule. Five million for one question. I think you have a lot of questions. Why don't you charge more. If it's not used up, it won't be a big deal for me. I'll give it to you the way it came."</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche gritted his teeth. Finally, he transferred another fifteen million to Skunk...</p>

    <p>In just a short moment, the 20 million he had just received had been wasted.</p>

    <p>After seeing the transfer credentials, Skunk nodded with satisfaction. He pulled Jiang Xiaoche to an uninhabited corner.</p>

    <p>"You can tell me now, right?" Jiang Xiaoche was a little anxious: "She has no grudges with the Tengu. There is no intersection..."</p>

    <p>"I know this better than you."</p>

    <p>Skunk said: "It is said that there is a douchebag, sold a photo related to the Huaguo Shuilian Group, the Tengu in order to verify the information, they intend to go to catch the Miss Sun Rong. However, they did not know that this Jiang girl and Miss Sun Rong look somewhat similar, they caught the wrong person. This is really a big joke. Over the years, Tengu's business skills have deteriorated."</p>

    <p>"captured the wrong person?" Jiang Xiaoche: "Then will they let her go?"</p>

    <p>"This is your third question. After I answer you now, you have one more chance to ask." The skunk raised a finger.</p>

    <p>"Okay...I understand..." Jiang Xiaoche nodded.</p>

    <p>"Based on what I know about the Tengu people, this matter probably won't end so satisfactorily."</p>

    <p>Skunk said: "Black market intelligence emphasizes precision and accuracy. Although it was only the intelligence confirmation team under Tengu that made the mistake this time, the fact that the wrong person was captured has already been circulated internally and spread. Otherwise, I wouldn't sell you this information."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

    <p>"I have a feeling that this Miss Jiang will end up miserable. After all, so far, no one knows where this Miss Jiang is being held. The Tengu people have always been ruthless."</p>

    <p>"If we can erase her existence, die without any evidence, and then whitewash the matter and make it a misinformation, given Tengu's reputation in the industry, I'm afraid most employers will still believe it. Then what should I do?"</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche was very anxious.</p>

    <p>Skunk thought for a moment and simply transferred the last five million to Jiang Xiaoche.</p>

    <p>"What are you doing?" Jiang Xiaoche was worried.</p>

    <p>"Because I don't know the answer." Skunk shrugged: "If you want to blame it, just blame the bastard who sold out the information about the Huaguo Shuilian Group."</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Hello. Zhuo Yi Senior? Yes. I am in Duobao City now. But this is an underground intelligence trading market. How do I get in?" After arriving in Duobao City, Sun Rong immediately gave Zhuo Yi made a phone call.</p>

    <p>"Master's Wife, please be patient and don't be impatient."</p>

    <p>"I'm not your Master's Wife..."</p>

    <p>"Hey, you don't know if it's you or not.?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Don't worry, there's a shopkeeper who sells potted plants in Duobao City, I've already put the secret order to enter the dungeon and the map to enter the dungeon underneath a potted plant with rich and noble flowers. In addition, I also prepared a nine-tailed fox mask inside, Master's Wife after entering, do not show your true face."</p>

    <p>"Okay...I understand. I'll be there right now!"</p>

    <p>"Ah, by the way, Master's Wife. Please don't do anything after entering. The most important thing is to find out the location and confirm the safety of classmate Jiang. If the safety of classmate Jiang is threatened, just pretend that I didn't say what I said above."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi After thinking for a while, he added: "Master's Wife can do whatever she wants. Just leave all the aftermath matters to me. But Master Wife needs to pay attention to one other thing."</p>

    <p>"What's the matter?"</p>

    <p>"That's Martial Saint Jiang, who is already on his way here. It is very likely that you will meet him face to face during this operation. He knows your Aohai. Maybe he will directly find out your identity."</p>

    <p>"Okay. I understand. Thank you, Senior Zhuo."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong nodded. She immediately hung up the phone.</p>

    <p>"Eh? Martial Saint is coming too. What should we do?" Sun Ying'er's voice sounded in Sun Rong's mind again.</p>

    <p>"Don't worry."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong shook her head: "Aohai has the ability to simulate sword energy. As long as she hides her true sword energy, she won't be caught."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"How is the situation now? Is your classmate Jiang in danger?"</p>

    <p>Just as Zhuo Yi was driving to Duobao City, Jiugong Liangzi, the co-pilot, also showed unusual concern about this matter.</p>

    <p>"This is not clear yet. But the Master's Wife has already passed. She knows the aura of her classmate Jiang. Use Aohai to search. I believe she will be able to find her location soon. But this matter has become a bit troublesome now... I actually just just There's something I haven't told my Master's Wife."</p>

    <p>"What else?"</p>

    <p>"Little Muyu, he ran away..."</p>

    <p>"Ah? Ran away?"</p>

    <p>"Because today was originally the day when the Master's Wife went to see the Little Mu Yu. But now she went to save her classmate Jiang... It must have been that the Little Mu Yu lost the temper of a child and ran out to find the Master's Wife. I have already done this. I told Master. Master is also on his way there."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Jiugong Liangzi took a breath of air.</p>

    <p>Good guy. She's straight up good guy.</p>

    <p>A family of three, all in one place....</p>
