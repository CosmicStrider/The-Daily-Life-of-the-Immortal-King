  <h1>Chapter 1294 Monk Jin Deng's Egg</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The monk took out his mythical beast egg that had been hatched for 300 lives but still had no fruit.</p>

    <p>The whole egg is dark blue. The whole egg has a crystal-like texture.</p>

    <p>There are carving-like and regular purple lines on the outside of the eggshell. When illuminated by light, it can disperse a beautiful light.</p>

    <p>"Master, do you mean to direct all the energy erupted during the Earth's Tribulation Transcendence to this egg?" Lord Diulei understood.</p>

    <p>"Exactly."</p>

    <p>The monk nodded: "The power of chaos has the characteristic of attracting each other. The egg of the poor monk was bred by chaos. It is suitable to be used as a lure."</p>

    <p>In fact, it is not difficult to find a magic weapon that contains the power of chaos.</p>

    <p>The heads of several major families in God's Domain probably have them in their hands.</p>

    <p>The anti-realm magic weapon is not a rare thing in the divine domain.</p>

    <p>But an anti-realm magic weapon that incorporates the power of chaos is priceless!</p>

    <p>If an anti-world magic weapon contains the power of chaos, the power of the magic weapon can be greatly enhanced!</p>

    <p>An anti-world magic weapon containing 1% of the power of chaos. Even if it has only a trace of power, it can increase its power by 5% on its original basis.</p>

    <p>And this is why the Dao Gods are so keen on raising mythical beasts.</p>

    <p>These creatures born from chaos are artifacts infused with the power of natural chaos.</p>

    <p>It is similar to a "reinforced syringe."</p>

    <p>Use things on the body of mythical beasts as materials. For example, head horns and hair. Use these materials as supplementary materials to strengthen the world-level magic weapon. There will be a slight probability that the magic weapon will gain the power of chaos.</p>

    <p>Jin Deng's mythical beast egg was extracted from chaos a long time ago.</p>

    <p>But the difference from other Dao Gods is that a normal chaotic one should have some movement after giving birth to more than ten or twenty lives.</p>

    <p>The monk's one seems to be particularly special.</p>

    <p>Just like Nezha. He refuses to come out...</p>

    <p>So the monk thought of a way to take advantage of this earth's Tribulation Transcendence.</p>

    <p>"This poor monk has his own selfish motives in this matter. But I hope you can help me." The monk said to everyone.</p>

    <p>"It's just a matter of course. Master is so polite. I also really want to know what can be born from Master's egg..." Zhenjun said. He turned around and took out his mobile phone. He made several calls.</p>

    <p>During this period, Zhenjun changed many languages. As many as seven or eight.</p>

    <p>Upgrading the Earth is a big deal. Lord Diulei has already consulted with the Huaxiu Alliance for instructions before. He hopes that the Head of State can negotiate with the leaders of multiple cultivating countries.</p>

    <p>This is a good thing for cultivators all over the world.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, it solves the problem of insufficient spiritual energy. On the other hand, it also enables the True Immortal realm to be further liberated.</p>

    <p>"nailed it."</p>

    <p>Ten minutes later, Lord Diulei turned around and replied: "This afternoon, Ambassador for the establishment of diplomatic relations between the planet and the planet, Guo Ping, will come to the Office of Strategic Deception. He will meet with Lord Boundary King in person. Together, we will determine the specific time for the earth's upgrade. This This matter will trouble the Lord Boundary King. This matter should be done as soon as possible. The initial date is Tuesday, December 1st."</p>

    <p>Although it was the monk who proposed the idea of upgrading the earth.</p>

    <p>However, the monk does not want too many people to know his identity.</p>

    <p>It is actually appropriate to leave this matter to Miss Ajuan.</p>

    <p>Directly create the Heavenly Dao star on the surface in order to have more friendly exchanges with the earth. Take the initiative to provide upgrades to the earth and benefit cultivators all over the earth. This would be better.</p>

    <p>"Na na! If I take the initiative, will there be any reward?" the girl asked confidently, with her hands on her hips.</p>

    <p>"The poor monk can provide three additional consecration services to Miss Ajuan." The monk smiled.</p>

    <p>"Deal!" Miss Ajuan nodded.</p>

    <p>At this time, the monk sighed silently in his heart.</p>

    <p>This King of the God Realm is so coaxable.</p>

    <p>They have all come to earth. Wouldn't it be nice to directly ask for Ling Zhenren's enlightenment technique...</p>

    <p>This enlightenment technique is more powerful than his consecration technique.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, the head of the Zhou family woke up from a coma. He was covered in bandages.</p>

    <p>Especially the head. It was wrapped up airtight.</p>

    <p>His whole body was filled with the smell of medicinal liquid. After all, he still had the heritage of a big family. The family's medicine storehouse had all the rare magical medicines and spiritual plants in reserve. It was just for use at this critical moment.</p>

    <p>As soon as the head of the Zhou family woke up, he saw six men sitting around his bed. He was so shocked that he almost lost his breath again.</p>

    <p>"You... why are you here..."</p>

    <p>Those were the heads of the other six major families who were beaten.</p>

    <p>After they were carried back for treatment by their respective wealthy elders, it didn't take long for them to wake up one after another from their coma.</p>

    <p>The head of the Zhou family was the last one to wake up.</p>

    <p>"We have important matters to discuss. But you were injured the most, so I came to visit in advance and wait for you to wake up." The head of the Sheng family said.</p>

    <p>His head had been hammered into the collarbone by the monk.</p>

    <p>After returning to the family, the wealthy elder of the Sheng family mobilized several people to pull his head out of his body and reset it.</p>

    <p>In a battle with the earth's cultivators, the Seven Dao Gods suffered a complete defeat.</p>

    <p>This is something no one expected.</p>

    <p>"Then the monk is gone..." The head of the Zhou family was still frightened.</p>

    <p>He was hit hard by the monk's head hammer. He felt like he was almost dead...</p>

    <p>"Master Zhou, I think your focus is wrong." The leader of the Sheng family shook his head.</p>

    <p>This monk is indeed very powerful... but the problem is that the person who really caused a psychological shadow on them is not the monk!</p>

    <p>But that terrible person on earth!</p>

    <p>"Don't blame Zhou Family Master. He was seriously injured by the monk's head hammer. In fact, he has no idea what happened next." The other family heads sighed.</p>

    <p>They actually quite envied the head of the Zhou family.</p>

    <p>Although his Dao God brain was destroyed when the earthly young warrior's extraterrestrial hands first appeared.</p>

    <p>But fortunately, the elimination speed was fast enough. The head of the Zhou family has not fully reacted yet.</p>

    <p>After that, I experienced a headbutt from a monk. Naturally, I didn't know how terrifying Wang Ling was.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, the other six Dao Gods had a head-on confrontation with Wang Ling's virtual bodies. Then they were collectively beaten...</p>

    <p>That kind of mental impact cannot be described in words.</p>

    <p>Several family heads couldn't help but sigh.</p>

    <p>"After the earth undergoes this upgrade, I think it won't take long to catch up with the divine realm... It's also a hundred years? Maybe a thousand years? Maybe it won't take that long at all..."</p>

    <p>"More than that, I just want to know when did such a number one person appear on Earth?"</p>

    <p>"Could he be... Dao Ancestor?"</p>

    <p>"It can't be Dao Ancestor. We're both clear on that."</p>

    <p>"Then the Gu family, the Wang family and the Liu family. It seems that they have known the details for a long time. They deliberately did not take action this time."</p>

    <p>"Yes! Now that our cultivation has been reduced, the gap between us and these three families will widen. Although the Liu family's background is not strong to begin with, after this time, there is a high probability that it will surpass us. Everyone who steps on us will on the head."</p>

    <p>At this moment, the Zhou family, who had just woken up from serious injuries, understood: "So what do you mean, my lords?"</p>

    <p>"In our current situation, it's definitely not possible to suppress the Wang family and the Gu family. We couldn't defeat them originally... but it's still possible to bully the Liu family."</p>

    <p>The head of the Sheng family said: "In this battle, the majesty of the seven of us has been wiped out. All forces in the God's Domain must have complained about this matter. Taking it out on the Liu family. On the one hand, it is to suppress. On the other hand, it is also to intimidate."</p>
