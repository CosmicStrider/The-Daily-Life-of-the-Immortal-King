  <h1>Chapter 1189 Hexagonal Warrior</h1>

  <div>

    <p>As an excellent human shield warrior, Wang Zhen's talent in martial arts is self-evident. Although his ability is not as good as Gu Shunzhi's, he has fought against Gu Shunzhi so many times in the divine domain. He can also learn a few tricks. In addition to the fact that he has been beaten since childhood. In fact, even if he had not encountered Wang Ling. Wang Zhen would not be afraid of the mental control of this "dark shadow"...</p>

    <p>His ultimate ability to bear the psychological shadow area is far beyond comparison with other people. This is basically what his real father and real mother taught Wang Zhen in the process of "husband and wife mixed doubles" since he was a child. Normal people cannot imitate it. Also It is not recommended that parents use this "domestic violence" method to train their children in order to strengthen their children's psychological endurance...</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen is feasible. On the one hand, it is because of the physical constitution. On the other hand, the brain circuit of the real father and mother is different from ordinary people. If this matter were placed on the earth, it would be sentenced according to the "Domestic Violence Law!"</p>

    <p>"It's actually stronger than I thought." Jiang Yingyue felt that she was a little fooled. Wang Zhen's strength was beyond his imagination. Such mental endurance is really rare. If there was an attribute panel, At least it is a 3a panel with strength, speed, and mental strength.</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect that not long after I died, such a famous person would appear on the earth..." Jiang Yingyue sighed in Er Ha's independent space.</p>

    <p>Er Ha smiled inwardly after hearing this.</p>

    <p>Wang Zhen's strength is indeed very strong. But after all, Wang Zhen comes from the God's Domain. The combat power level of the people in the God's Domain is originally incomparable with that on Earth. If it weren't for the fact that most of the strength was blocked by Heavenly Dao, Li Huanran even punched Wang Zhen. They can't bear it. Although Wang Zhen is now blessed with the power of Shadow, his overall combat strength is still worse than in his heyday.</p>

    <p>Therefore, it is really not surprising that Wang Zhen is strong.</p>

    <p>Er Ha feels that Jiang Yingyue is so surprised. I'm afraid the main reason is that he has never seen a real hexagonal warrior...</p>

    <p>Of course. The so-called hexagon is just a metaphor.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is powerful enough to support any shape.</p>

    <p>Even if it is a forty-eight-sided shape, it can be held up perfectly...</p>

    <p>At this time, the battle is still going on.</p>

    <p>Li Huanran saw that his "demon shadows" had no effect on Wang Zhen. There was a puzzled expression on his face.</p>

    <p>It should be noted that the mental suppression effect of his Shadow power has never failed like this before.</p>

    <p>Li Huanran thought it was because his attack was not strong enough. So he expanded the power of his {Ji Quan Dao} to the sixth level! His power became greater than before. He punched to the flesh. Every time Wang Zhen, who was capable of punching, spit out a large mouthful of blood.</p>

    <p>However, as a human shield warrior, Wang Zhen's ability to withstand pressure is really amazing.</p>

    <p>{Blood Coagulation Restoration Skill}. Helped him to repair his injuries immediately during the beating. The sixth level of Jiquan Doo was still far away from the goal of "vomiting three liters of blood." It did not reach Wang Zhen's bottom line at all.</p>

    <p>But at the same time, Wang Zhen was also thinking of a way. He didn't want Li Huanran to continue to superimpose the power of {Ji Quan Dao}, because the result of this was obvious. Li Huanran would only die.</p>

    <p>In Wang Zhen's view, Li Huanran is the same as Jiang Yingyue, whom Er Ha previously captured. Perhaps he is a friend who can be pulled into his camp.</p>

    <p>The way to end this battle now is also very simple. You just need to help Li Huanran get rid of the shackles of mental control. As long as Li Huanran is not controlled, as the son of Master Li Xiaokai, he has an absolutely positive image in the world of cultivation. He will never help the people behind the scenes continue to do evil.</p>

    <p>But how to get Li Huanran back on his feet? This is a big problem.</p>

    <p>"On the surface, what Li Huanran was hit was a very strong mind control spell. And it was most likely that he was hit along with the resurrection spell. Therefore, Li Huanran was already under control the moment he was resurrected. " Er Ha stared at the battle situation in front of him and analyzed it in his mental space.</p>

    <p>"Is there any way to crack it?" Xiao Yin asked.</p>

    <p>"Generally, there are three ways to break this powerful mind control spell."</p>

    <p>"First, through physical strikes, force the opponent out of the state of mental control. However, this method does not seem to be feasible at present. Wang Zhen and Li Huanran have been fighting for so long. Li Huanran is unmoved. This kind of Methods without physical means are ineffective. Stronger methods must be used."</p>

    <p>"The second one is to directly find the person who used the mind control technique on him and defeat him. Then the control technique can be contacted." Er Ha knew. There is no difference between saying this and not saying it. The purpose of their coming to this stalactite cave This was originally to track down the identity of the person behind the scenes and collect more evidence about "Huang Lao being transferred to a subcontractor."</p>

    <p>Therefore, after eliminating the above two options, there is only the third method of intervention that relies on magic.</p>

    <p>But the problem is. The three of them here seem to be in close combat. Er Ha himself is barely half a fatan. It is not easy to remove such a level of mind control spell. A more powerful mind control spell is needed to control Li Huanran. It can only be covered by magic!</p>

    <p>But who among them knows mind control spells?</p>

    <p>Isn't this ua... you can control it just by saying control...</p>

    <p>"As long as the coverage is completed, that's it?" At this time, Wang Zhen asked.</p>

    <p>"Theoretically it is indeed possible." Er Ha nodded: "As long as the mental control spell you cast is at an absolute advantage... and ensures that the intensity is higher than the mental spell that controls Li Huanran, coverage can be achieved."</p>

    <p>"Then I can try." At this time, Wang Zhen's expression became serious again.</p>

    <p>"You actually know how to control mind? Aren't you a human shield warrior?" Er Ha and Xiao Yin were both surprised.</p>

    <p>"It's not me... but my image. It has this ability."</p>

    <p>"So it turns out that the tied man can not only control the body?"</p>

    <p>"As long as I want to, mind control is also possible..." Wang Zhen's current idea is actually very simple. That is to use the shadow effect of the man he tied up to cover the mind control technique on Li Huanran. Then Then cancel his own photo effect. Then Li Huanran will become a normal person again.</p>

    <p>This idea was immediately approved by Er Ha and Xiao Yin.</p>

    <p>If they can pull all these "resurrectionists" into their team, they will be much more confident about finding the person behind the scenes... Even if Jiang Yingyue refuses to tell, Li Huanran, as a decent person, once When your mind returns to normal, you will never hide any information.</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, Wang Zhen felt that it was no longer necessary to delay.</p>

    <p>He controlled his "tied man" and rushed towards Li Huanran!</p>

    <p>As Wang Zhen said, in addition to the effect of physical imprisonment, the bound man actually also has the power of mental control...</p>

    <p>Once the tied man is tied up, the tied person will immediately transform into a "masochist" mentally...</p>
