  <h1>Chapter 1731 Encryption Laboratory</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The encryption laboratory in the Dragon Cemetery. Branches are located in various directions in the cemetery. Some are in the air and some are underground. They will change locations at any time following the encryption mechanism.</p>

    <p>There are four levels of encryption laboratories: Heaven, Earth, Xuan, and Huang. The Heaven level is the highest level encryption laboratory. This is the only one distributed in the entire Dragon Cemetery. And all the bones of the three Yu family that have been searched The files are collected in this only heaven-level laboratory.</p>

    <p>This is the highest level laboratory. Even though Master Wu Xin and Bai Zhe have joined forces, Bai Zhe is wary of him and has not fully given him access.</p>

    <p>A mechanical crab with eight legs. It is a regular means of transportation in the Dragon Cemetery. Wang Ming and Number 10021 galloped like the wind. They ran around this reddish-brown cemetery.</p>

    <p>The eight-legged crab looked bulky but was extremely fast and flexible. The two quickly found the boss who had led the country Number 10021. Codenamed Wasp.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming glanced at the hornet's work number plate. It read 291.</p>

    <p>The three-digit ID tag is enough to prove that the other party is a group of employees who are already veterans of the Baobai Group. In the Baobai Group, these Panda people can judge each other's seniority based on their own work number plates. The sooner you get there, The smaller the artificial account, the higher the level and right to speak.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the length of this number is sometimes a symbol of status. A three-digit work number is like a five-digit QQ number. It is already a legendary existence in the Baobai Group.</p>

    <p>It is precisely because of this that Wasps are very arrogant in their behavior.</p>

    <p>Even though Master Wu Xin already belongs to the first echelon of scientists in the Baobai Group, ordinary pandas would call him "Sir" when they see him. But as an employee with a three-digit job number, when Wasp saw Wang Ming appear, there was a look on his face. His expression didn't change much.</p>

    <p>"I know who you are. The new scientist. And you entered the first echelon as soon as you came in."</p>

    <p>The hornet smiled and said: "But I don't care who you are. There are three hundred and sixty-two divisions in the Dragon Cemetery. Now my rank is the division commander. As long as I am the general commander in charge of on-site excavation and exploration Not you. Then the relationship between you and me is equal."</p>

    <p>"I understand." Wang Ming smiled.</p>

    <p>"No. You don't understand. I heard your appeal at Number 10021. Before you officially start cooperating with us, in order to ensure that nothing unpleasant happens, I still want to make this relationship clear with you."</p>

    <p>Wasp said: "First of all, not every division commander knows the location of the Sky Level Laboratory. If you think there is someone else more reliable than me, it can bring you more convenience. Okay. Please leave as soon as possible. This subdivision. Go to their subdivision."</p>

    <p>"Time flows very slowly in Dragon Cemetery. According to the time here, ten minutes have passed in the outside world. Maybe only a month has passed here."</p>

    <p>"Using the time here to calculate. This is the 5th year since the establishment of Baobai. I gave the other Baobai employees 3 years. I capped it in the 2nd year. In 3 years, has any of their performance exceeded mine? ?"</p>

    <p>"Now I have become the commander of this division. I am also one of the top dark horses among all division commanders competing for the overall command. Accepting the offer to cooperate with you is completely giving you face. After all, there are not many scientists in the first echelon."</p>

    <p>"So, we have an equal relationship, not a superior-subordinate relationship. Do you understand now?"</p>

    <p>"I really understand this time." Wang Ming smiled bitterly in his heart and said softly.</p>

    <p>At this point, the wasp nodded with satisfaction.</p>

    <p>He looked at Wang Ming and confirmed: "Number 10021 said that you only need to use brain waves to detect it outside the sky-level encryption laboratory, right? How long will it take? Is 1 second enough?"</p>

    <p>"1 second?"</p>

    <p>"This is the highest level encryption laboratory. The location will change at any time. The time spent at one coordinate point will not exceed 5 seconds at most.</p>

    <p>If you're lucky enough, you'll have five seconds. But if you're unlucky, you'll only have 1 second." Wasp said, "And I can only help you once. After all, detecting top secrets, I also have certain risks."</p>

    <p>"Okay then. One second is enough." Wang Ming said.</p>

    <p>No matter if it's one second or one hundred thousandth of a second, as long as this heaven-level laboratory appears, it will definitely not escape before his eyes.</p>

    <p>Wang Ming felt inadequate and laughed.</p>

    <p>Now in his body are some of the strongest people on earth.</p>

    <p>"How did you calculate the location of the Sky Level Laboratory?" Wang Ming asked.</p>

    <p>"It's not based on calculation. It's based on induction." Xinghua smiled: "There are three hundred and sixty-two zones in the Dragon Cemetery. The sky-level laboratory will always pass by the place under my jurisdiction several times. In the zone under my feet. The sensing device has been planted a long time ago."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. Wang Ming feels that the operation of the Wasp seems to be very skillful. It seems that he is not the first person to inquire about the location of the Tian-level laboratory.</p>

    <p>He felt that the Hornets had turned this into a business.</p>

    <p>At this moment, Wasp was holding a data panel, staring intently at the data above. Several people were sitting on the mechanical crab and kept moving. Until a certain point, Wasp finally commanded the mechanical crab to stop.</p>

    <p>"It's coming! Get ready! The Sky Level Laboratory will pass near us soon. The coordinates are within a radius of no more than two kilometers from us," he said.</p>

    <p>This is not precise location information. But it is enough for Wang Ming. It is only a few kilometers. His brain wave radiation range can still be covered.</p>

    <p>He concentrated his mental power, and then spread the brain waves out at once, like a dragnet, covering all directions on the ground - and the result was in mid-air. Wang Ming suddenly felt that he had caught a huge creature.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>Suddenly, a huge thing hidden in the void appeared. Under the influence of Wang Ming's brain waves, the invisible barrier on the outside was affected. His true face in Lushan was revealed directly in front of everyone.</p>

    <p>This is a giant thing that looks like a steel silkworm chrysalis. No one would have thought that such a monster-like thing could be a building. It is also a legendary heaven-level laboratory!</p>

    <p>The wasp's mouth gradually grew. He couldn't believe that Wang Ming's brain waves were so terrifying. It directly disabled the invisibility mechanism of the Tian-level laboratory! Not only that. The Tian-level laboratory was also directly frozen in place. It stopped moving. Not a cent!</p>

    <p>"Are you crazy? You made such a big fuss!" the wasp screamed.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Is it big?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ming crossed his arms, raised the corners of his lips, and stared at the hornet. There was a bit of coldness in his eyes: "When you brought my girlfriend here, you didn't seem to have considered whether the matter would become a big deal, right?"</p>

    <p>Wasp immediately realized that something was wrong: "You...you are..."</p>

    <p>At this time, Wasp felt an invisible force strangle his throat. His whole body was levitated under a powerful wave.</p>

    <p>He was manipulated. Under the tremendous mental pressure, he peed his pants on the spot.</p>

    <p>Then Wang Ming stepped forward and touched the wasp's head. In his right hand was a "temporary enlightenment technique" prepared by Wang Ling, which strengthened the wasp's head.</p>

    <p>Then he used brain waves to control the wasp, pointing his head directly at the steel chrysalis in front of him.</p>

    <p>Just listen to a whooshing sound!</p>

    <p>A humanoid self-propelled missile was accurately projected under the control of Wang Ming. It blasted a huge hole in the sky-level laboratory in front on the spot...</p>
