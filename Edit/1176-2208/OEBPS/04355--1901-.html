  <h1>Chapter 1901 Lord Ma &gt; Dragonborn?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>His body is very clean now. Lord Ma knows this very well. Since falling in love with Yu Shenshu, there has been no other benefit. He has a girlfriend who likes to clean. He looks much younger.</p>

    <p>Although. He is already the oldest spirit in the Old Wang family. Little Sheep has always called him the uncle with gray hair and boyish face. This moved Lord Ma very much.</p>

    <p>At this moment, as one of the first batch of furniture monsters in Old Wang's family that has been strengthened by version 3.0 of the attunement technique, Lord Ma suddenly changed his clothes in the next second. He immediately put on a very coquettish Western-style tuxedo. He enlightens his status as an old patriarch in the world of spirits and monsters.</p>

    <p>"Bed Immortal. I will leave it to you, old master. I will fight off this girl." Lord Ma said. He directly teleported Father Wang steadily to Bed Immortal. Bed Immortal was carrying Father on his left and Mother Wang on his right shoulders. Very stable.</p>

    <p>He and Lord Ma are also old partners. In this case, there is no need to say many words at all. Just a look. The cooperation is an incomparable tacit understanding.</p>

    <p>"What a joke. Do you want to compete with us dragonborn, monsters like you using magic?" Yani? giggled. She found it incredible. A piece of furniture that had been enlightened could have such a confident tone. She wanted to stop the noble blood.</p>

    <p>"You self-righteous little girl. So what if you are a dragonborn? My master has never looked down upon bastards like you." Lord Ma put his hands behind his back and stared at her. The tail at the end of the Western-style tuxedo was windless and elegant.</p>

    <p>Being so looked down upon by an enlightened toilet. Yan? can't tolerate it. She is also a Dragonborn after all. She doesn't approve of such a matchup. She actually let a toilet be her opponent. This is too disrespectful to the Dragon Clan.</p>

    <p>"You court death!"</p>

    <p>She got angry instantly and spit out dragon flames from her mouth. This was the purple and black dragon divine fire. It had a terrifying temperature. The flame lake below immediately resonated with it at the moment it was erupted. Several fire dragons soared into the sky from the flame lake. Forming a double-team attitude, they headed towards Lord Ma.</p>

    <p>Lord Ma had a calm expression on his face, but in his heart he was secretly surprised and disgusted by her methods. She looked like a very quiet girl, but her moves were all large-scale destructive attacks.</p>

    <p>Although he is the oldest spirit in the Old Wang family, Lord Ma still knows nothing about the grand occasion of the Dragon Clan back then. This battle actually taught Lord Ma a lesson.</p>

    <p>However, Lord Ma did not panic at all. He quickly dodged. Although the formation of the fire dragon was sudden, it still gave Lord Ma a certain amount of reaction time.</p>

    <p>The rest of the Wang family's spirits hid in the house and watched. With the entire villa surrounded by the flaming lake, the temperature in the house rose a lot. The spirits looked out the window at the apocalyptic scene outside. Every one of them had lingering fear in their heart.</p>

    <p>The dragons are really terrible. There are really not many among the Old Wang family's enlightened spirits who can fight with dragons of this level. If they were the ones who got a little bit of the dragon's divine fire, they would be burned to ashes immediately.</p>

    <p>Like Jingze, Yan? has also grown in these days, becoming more fierce than before.</p>

    <p>While Lord Ma was fighting, he didn't feel very sorry in his heart.</p>

    <p>Such a powerful ability. If it can be used to benefit the world of human cultivation, this will be a wonderful avenue of symbiosis.</p>

    <p>He doesn't understand why the Dragon Clan must pursue the mission of restoring its past glory. Since he can live from his heart, it's not a bad idea to take a path of peaceful coexistence, coexistence and symbiosis.</p>

    <p>There was a "bang" sound. Lord Ma ducked sideways to avoid a fire as big as a mountain. The spiritual power of Yan? seemed to be endless. She didn't care about the consumption when casting spells. She swayed her dragon in large amounts. The breath and spiritual power burned the land in front of it redden. The nearby earth was all cracked and shattered, forming dry abyss.</p>

    <p>"You can only hide? Toilet!" Yan? ridiculed. She did not regard Lord Ma as her opponent at all. She was just letting her temper go willfully.</p>

    <p>Lord Ma's face suddenly became serious when he heard this. He felt that this little dragon girl was really in need of discipline.</p>

    <p>As the spirit of the Wang family, the patriarch has always regarded himself as elegant and easy-going. When he was avoiding these attacks, he had planned to use verbal admonitions to make him easy to catch.</p>

    <p>But now it turns out that Lord Ma feels that he thinks too much. Sure enough, the trick of talking and escaping does not apply to everyone.</p>

    <p>As the head of the family, now he has to take action to teach Yan?</p>

    <p>"Huh!"</p>

    <p>At this time, Yan? once again breathed out the divine fire of the Dragon Clan. The pink skirt radiated light under the resonant power of the Dragonborn bloodline, making her whole body glow.</p>

    <p>She once again intensified the power of the Dragon Divine Fire. This time it hit Lord Ma directly, completely engulfing him.</p>

    <p>This time, Lord Ma did not choose to dodge. Instead, he directly opened his mouth to receive the divine fire from Yan? With a terrifying devouring process, a wonderful cave was formed in his body, absorbing the dragon divine fire in continuously.</p>

    <p>Everyone was shocked. This was carrying the Dragon Clan Divine Fire and swallowing these Dragon Clan Divine Fire into their stomachs! It was simply unbelievable!</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei was horrified when he saw it from a distance. He knew the origin of Lord Ma. But he never thought that Lord Ma was so powerful!</p>

    <p>No wonder Senior Wang didn't take action. It turned out that he had anticipated Lord Ma's strength. Can Lord Ma alone be able to fight against him?</p>

    <p>As expected of Senior Wang...</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei sighed in his heart about the great strength of Father Wang and Mother Wang.</p>

    <p>It seems that the Dragonborn is not ready enough for the two of them to take action.</p>

    <p>Although it is very strong, it is enough to deal with the monsters inspired by the Old Wang family.</p>

    <p>"I don't believe it. You can keep swallowing it!" Same as Jingze. There is a kind of magical arrogance in Yan?. She originally looked down on Lord Ma. It was even more difficult to accept the fact that her dragon divine fire was ineffective.</p>

    <p>The next moment, she increased the flames. The separation stimulated the dragon divine fire to try to explode Lord Ma's internal space.</p>

    <p>However, what Yan? didn't expect was that her urging caused a new change in Lord Ma's body.</p>

    <p>Under the constant stimulation and devouring of the dragon's divine fire, Lord Ma's black tuxedo changed visibly to the naked eye. Not only that, even his eye color and hair color changed.</p>

    <p>His black tuxedo turned into a gradient black and gold color. His hair color and curly goatee turned into pure gold at this moment. And Lord Ma's aura is more powerful than before! In the process of continuously absorbing the dragon's divine fire .He became stronger than before!</p>

    <p>"Uncle Ma's aura seems to have improved!"</p>

    <p>"I know! It's fourth gear!"</p>

    <p>"Fourth gear?"</p>

    <p>The crowd started to talk about it.</p>

    <p>"Well. It's version 4.0 of the Enlightenment Technique! It requires a special mechanism to trigger the upgrade!"</p>

    <p>The little sheep said softly: "Now, Uncle Ma is already a version 4.0 enlightenment spirit!"</p>

    <p>At the same time, Father Wang and Mother Wang heard the words of sheep. When they suddenly realized it, they felt speechless in their hearts.</p>

    <p>Who would have thought...</p>

    <p>Lord Ma actually evolved into a tempered toilet during the battle with the Dragonborn...</p>
