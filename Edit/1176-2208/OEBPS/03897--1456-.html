  <h1>Chapter 1456 The number of strange Shura fields increases</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Obviously. Jiang Yingying was clearly arranged.</p>

    <p>At the same time, she also realized the horror of Sun Rong...</p>

    <p>But Jiang Yingying is never a person who gives up easily.</p>

    <p>She didn't give up.</p>

    <p>If you can't get a seat behind Wang Ling, then there is only one last option left.</p>

    <p>After class, Jiang Yingying took Guo Hao aside alone: "Classmate Jiang, what do you mean... change seats?"</p>

    <p>"Young man! Don't be so outgoing. Just call me Yingying." Jiang Yingying patted Guo Hao on the shoulder and looked at Guo Hao expectantly.</p>

    <p>During the first class, Jiang Yingying was planning this episode.</p>

    <p>No boy would refuse a cute girl's request, right?</p>

    <p>However, to Jiang Yingying's surprise, Guo Hao rejected her without even thinking: "Then you are wrong Yingying. As one of Wang Ling's best buddies, I won't Give up your seat easily."</p>

    <p>Nonsense. Of course he can't give up his seat.</p>

    <p>Boss Sun over there just gave them so many {publicly selected links} accounts that are number one in the server... How could they betray Boss Sun like that!</p>

    <p>Moreover, Boss Sun has actually already arranged this with them before the start of school.</p>

    <p>As long as he and Chen Chao don't give up their seats.</p>

    <p>Sponsor an additional 10,000 yuan in game funds every month...</p>

    <p>But for Guo Hao and Chen Chao, this is already a lot.</p>

    <p>Such benefits should not be wasted.</p>

    <p>10,000 yuan is nothing to Sun Rong. It is just a fraction. But considering that excessive consumption in the game will make people mentally depressed, so the girl did not give more. It was just a token of appreciation.</p>

    <p>He also made an agreement with the two of them that if one day the results are at the bottom, the financial sponsorship will be cancelled.</p>

    <p>Neither Guo Hao nor Chen Chao understood the girl's behavior very well before.</p>

    <p>Now. He has completely understood...</p>

    <p>When school was over that day, Chen Chao and Guo Hao walked together.</p>

    <p>Guo Hao talked about Jiang Yingying. Chen Chao's reaction was also very strong.</p>

    <p>"Sure enough. Did she come to you? She came to me too. Everything was as expected by Boss Sun..." Chen Chao wiped his sweat. He was immediately glad that he was not on good terms with Sun Rong. Otherwise, it would be a bit overwhelming.</p>

    <p>As for a girlfriend, it's better to find someone silly...</p>

    <p>"Boss Sun has a long-term vision. He is really powerful." Guo Hao nodded: "Tomorrow is Saturday. We have made an appointment to go to the ancient street. Then we will have to find an opportunity to escape. I remember there is a An inn-style Internet cafe is very nice."</p>

    <p>"I understand."</p>

    <p>Chen Chao nodded his head. Then he rubbed his chin: "Hey. This time in the transfer students. There are quite a few beauties at the school's flower girl level... Jiang Yingying. There's also a foreign girl called Jiugong Liangzi.. I think she's also here for Wang Ling. Why do I think she's here for Wang Ling?"</p>

    <p>Emmm...</p>

    <p>They have been feeling that something is wrong with the atmosphere in the school recently.</p>

    <p>It seems to be true. The main reason for the strange atmosphere is the increase in the number of strange Shura fields!</p>

    <p>Speaking of this, the two old bachelors couldn't help but sigh in their hearts - a bunch of flowers, stuck on the wood!</p>

    <p>At this time, Guo Hao looked at Chen Chao: "By the way, have you ever been in love?"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "Just once. The girl even kissed me."</p>

    <p>"?"</p>

    <p>Guo Hao: "When did it happen? Junior high school?"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "Kindergarten class."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao was shocked: "How the hell does this count!?"</p>

    <p>Chen Chao: "Actually, there will be a few more after that. They are in elementary school and junior high school. I don't know if they are in love. What about you?"</p>

    <p>"Womb solo."</p>

    <p>Guo Hao spread his hands and said with a smile: "Same as the author of Immortal King."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After Wang Ling returned home in the evening, I just realized that tomorrow was the day we agreed to go to the ancient street.</p>

    <p>Today he was stared at by Jiang Yingying's scorching eyes, which made his balls ache. Fortunately, there were many of him in the classroom.</p>

    <p>Gu Shunzhi and Zhenyuan are secretly helping him avoid Jiang Yingying's sight.</p>

    <p>As for Sun Rong, because of the good seats, it naturally helped him a lot.</p>

    <p>I helped you. Naturally I have to return the favor.</p>

    <p>This is the etiquette of the Wang family.</p>

    <p>The gift, of course, is the lighted White Rabbit toffee.</p>

    <p>Because Wang Ling saw that the white rabbit toffee that was previously placed in Sun Rong's pencil case was gone.</p>

    <p>There is no need to deliberately deduce it. Wang Ling also knows that the girl must not have eaten it... maybe she has kept it.</p>

    <p>He didn't quite understand what the girl meant by doing this.</p>

    <p>This is just a piece of candy.</p>

    <p>So this time. Wang Ling stuffed two.</p>

    <p>He didn't believe that Sun Rong could behave like a hamster. He put away all the candies.</p>

    <p>"Xiu Zhen Cultivation Street..."</p>

    <p>Before dinner. Wang Ling deliberately searched the Internet for information.</p>

    <p>This ancient street is also the first time for Wang Ling to go. It is also necessary to do a little homework in advance.</p>

    <p>This way you can avoid going into some minefields.</p>

    <p>But there are many people traveling together tomorrow. There are also three people: Li Youyue, Guo Hao, and Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>These three people are all chatty veteran drivers.</p>

    <p>The atmosphere shouldn't be too awkward.</p>

    <p>"Ling Ling. I heard that you made an appointment with your classmates to go to Xiu Zhen Cultivation Street tomorrow?" At this time, Father Wang on the sofa put down the newspaper and glanced at Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Yeah." Wang Ling nodded.</p>

    <p>He didn't know where Father Wang got the news... In fact, he was a little curious.</p>

    <p>After what happened last time when he and Sun Rong went to the Xiao family compound, he became wary of Father Wang and Mother Wang's reaction when they saw him going out with a girl.</p>

    <p>Parents of other families avoid puppy love. Only these two live treasures don't care at all.</p>

    <p>Because it is said that when Father Wang and Mother Wang were young, they were also famous members of the puppy love party...</p>

    <p>Then. Father Wang continued to ask: "How many girls are there? Is there any Sun Rong girl?"</p>

    <p>Really!</p>

    <p>I asked anyway.</p>

    <p>He just knew...</p>

    <p>"Forget it. I know even if you don't tell me." Father Wang chuckled: "I just want to tell you. If you can't come back in time in the evening, you don't have to come back."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "?"</p>

    <p>He can teleport!</p>

    <p>If he wants to leave... who can stop him...</p>

    <p>"There is obviously a girl in front of you. If you still think about using your power to force your way back. This is a very impolite behavior of a straight man. You will be criticized."</p>

    <p>After saying this, the corners of Wang Ling's mouth twitched.</p>

    <p>Father Wang does not have the ability to read minds. But in this emotional aspect, he is like an expert in mind reading.</p>

    <p>What is Wang Ling thinking about?</p>

    <p>He seemed to know everything clearly.</p>

    <p>Father Wang laughed: "When we leave, boys should take the initiative. Send all the girls home safely and then come back. This is the right thing to do."</p>

    <p>"Okay..." Wang Ling nodded.</p>

    <p>There is nothing we can do.</p>

    <p>He is a good boy.</p>

    <p>I'm used to being obedient. My father's fate is difficult.</p>

    <p>Of course, he was mainly worried that Father Wang would deduct his pocket money for another reason.</p>

    <p>"Oh, by the way, Ling Ling. There is one more thing I want to tell you."</p>

    <p>At this time, Father Wang added: "The owners of the Hanfu shops on Xiu Zhen Cultivation Street are all my fans. I have already said hello to them."</p>

    <p>Hanfu?...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling thought for a moment.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if it would be weird if I wore Hanfu.</p>

    <p>"Since you are going to play with your classmates, you need to integrate into the group. The Hanfu over there is very good. You can try it." Father Wang said: "You don't have to say hello. When you get to the store, the bosses will naturally recognize you."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "?"</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "After all, there are very few people with fish-like eyes like yours."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
