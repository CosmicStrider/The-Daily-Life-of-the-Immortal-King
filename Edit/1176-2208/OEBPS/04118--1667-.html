  <h1>Chapter 1667 Wang Ling's concern</h1>

  <div>

    <p>There was no blood. There was only the stinking smell of engine oil flowing across it. It was very similar to the feeling when refueling a car at a gas station.</p>

    <p>Facing the sudden Alluring Sword. Jin Yan and the androids underground had no time to react. Their heads fell to the ground one after another.</p>

    <p>As bionic humans, their insides are created with high-precision machinery. Therefore, even if their heads leave their bodies, they will not die immediately.</p>

    <p>Of course, if it is an ordinary decapitation, with their regeneration ability, they can control the body to pick up the head and put the head back together.</p>

    <p>But unfortunately, the girl was more cautious than they thought. When the Alluring Sword's sword energy swept across, it directly destroyed the sensory nerves inside their bodies, causing the mental connection between the head and the body to be completely severed. They are now completely isolated and helpless.</p>

    <p>Of course. Sun Rong is far more cautious than that...</p>

    <p>At this moment, she took another step forward and inserted Aohai into the earth. A huge vortex force formed in the field. It accurately locked the sixteen broken bodies here.</p>

    <p>One body after another uncontrollably gathered from all directions with the attraction of the vortex. Then it was sucked into the vortex. It was very similar to the fruits that were sucked into the juicer. In an instant, it was smashed to pieces and turned into particles of dust...</p>

    <p>So, in just a few seconds, the bodies of Jin Yan and others also disappeared. Only the round heads were left.</p>

    <p>And it was only now that Jin Yan realized what kind of devil he had offended.</p>

    <p>So cruel...</p>

    <p>Why are there such scary guys?</p>

    <p>"Mr. Ducas, did you kill him? You have to answer honestly. Otherwise I will be angry." At this time, Sun Rong leaned over and stared at Jin Yan's head.</p>

    <p>Jin Yan sweated: "Yes..."</p>

    <p>"very good."</p>

    <p>After seeing Jin Yan's straightforward admission, Sun Rong immediately nodded.</p>

    <p>Every wrongdoer has his head, and every debt has his own owner.</p>

    <p>As an experienced Hanzawa Naoki enjoyer. Sun Rong knows how to return the favor.</p>

    <p>Another move was the "mobile version of the vortex gravity technique." Sun Rong brought all sixteen heads together. They were hovering behind her like the Taoist Jade in a certain cartoon. If she insists, The description of this scene reminds Jiugong Liangzi a little bit of a hero named Syndra in "League of Legends"...</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng understood. He knew what Sun Rong was going to do. He consciously stepped forward and opened the huge wine barrel that previously contained the remains of Ducas.</p>

    <p>The remnant body inside has been successfully transcended by monk Jin Deng. Not a single trace is left.</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng put his hands together. His face was full of Buddha's light and kindness: "Amitabha..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong Without saying a word, he threw the collected heads into the wine barrel one by one.</p>

    <p>The Jin Yan bionic man was the last one to be thrown in. Seeing Sun Rong about to close the lid, he immediately panicked: "You... what are you going to do! And the one over there who is emitting Buddha's light." .. Aren't you monks out of compassion to save all sentient beings?"</p>

    <p>Jin Deng raised his eyes. He stared at Jin Yan and glanced at him: "Those who have souls are living beings. You don't even have souls. What kind of living beings are you?"</p>

    <p>These words left Jin Yan speechless.</p>

    <p>They think they are humans. But in fact they are just machines with certain artificial intelligence created by Nawei.</p>

    <p>Is it sad?</p>

    <p>Maybe a little bit...</p>

    <p>She thought so.</p>

    <p>At this time, Monk Jin Deng was also stirred up in his heart. He felt that Sun Rong had always been a kind girl. But on some big issues of right and wrong, she showed a clearer sense of grudges than he imagined. She has a bit of the heroine style of Jianghu children.</p>

    <p>This made him feel a little happy. He felt that Sun Rong had really grown a lot.</p>

    <p>"Rongrong... what the hell..."</p>

    <p>At the scene at this moment, the only confused person was Jiugong Liangzi. She felt a little broken. She didn't understand why Sun Rong suddenly became stronger... and ridiculously strong...</p>

    <p>"Liangzi. I didn't mean to hide it from you. The same goes for Senior Zhuo Yi. I asked him not to tell you all this time... Anyway, this is a good opportunity. Why not let Senior Zhuo Yi explain it to you."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong took Jiugong Liangzi's hand and said.</p>

    <p>Immediately she looked outside the hall: "Zhuo Yi Senior, are you here? Stop hiding outside. I have noticed you a long time ago."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Beside the haystack outside the house, Zhuo Yi, who was lurking underground using the escape technique, couldn't help but sigh.</p>

    <p>What should come. It will always come...</p>

    <p>Because Jiugong Liangzi always thought Wang Ling was his apprentice...</p>

    <p>He felt that this wonderful misunderstanding was actually quite good. At least it could help explain a lot of things.</p>

    <p>Of course. Zhuo Yi also knows very clearly. The truth of all this cannot be hidden forever.</p>

    <p>Now he and Jiugong Liangzi have established a relationship. And they plan to continue to do so in the future...</p>

    <p>So this step has to be taken after all.</p>

    <p>Even though I was a little surprised by the development of the incident.</p>

    <p>But now.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi felt that it was time for him to act like a man. He explained everything clearly to Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The other side about a few minutes ago.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is playing with a gold coin bulldozer in the game hall of the Imperial City.</p>

    <p>He was holding a coin. The hand that inserted the coin suddenly paused in the air.</p>

    <p>He could feel it. It was the fluctuation of sword energy from the Alluring Sword over there.</p>

    <p>There seems to be a fight over there.</p>

    <p>It is also a crushing dimensionality reduction blow.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't know why he was playing the game so well that he would suddenly pay attention to the battle situation over there. But after learning that Sun Rong was progressing smoothly over there, he did feel relieved a lot. Then he focused his energy again Arriving in front of the gold coin bulldozer in front of me.</p>

    <p>This is already the sixteenth gold bulldozer that has been emptied by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The game coins earned by Wang Ling were filled with three sacks.</p>

    <p>There are as many as one hundred thousand pieces.</p>

    <p>According to the discount calculation in the game hall, all the 100,000 game coins can be discounted. They can be converted into equivalent gold gear coins at an exchange rate of 1:10.</p>

    <p>There are actually many throwing techniques for playing Gold Coin Bulldozer. The technique of Wang Ling is to attach a layer of magnetism to the thrown game coin while throwing the gold coin.</p>

    <p>So that as soon as this game coin enters the machine, no matter where you are, it will immediately form an overwhelming momentum. Push all the game coins in the machine out...</p>

    <p>"Mr. Jin, do you want to continue... The machines that have been emptied in front of you have been loaded with new game coins." The person in charge of the game hall wiped his cold sweat and stood respectfully next to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>His immediate boss is Jia Bugui.</p>

    <p>On weekdays, whenever Wang Ling appears in the game hall, Jia Bugui will be so frightened that he trembles all over and scolds them to drive Wang Ling away no matter what method he uses...</p>

    <p>Like other video game arcade owners, all video game arcade owners who have been "robbed" by Wang Ling almost all suffer from a disease that makes them twitch when they see Wang Ling. Commonly known as: Today is a mental illness.</p>

    <p>The person in charge thought that Jia Bugui's attitude might be the same as before.</p>

    <p>But who knew that when I went to report today, Boss Jia seemed to be in a particularly good mood...</p>

    <p>Not only did they not stop him, but he also asked them to send someone to have fun with Mr. Jin.</p>

    <p>The most outrageous thing is that there is no lower limit to this game...</p>

    <p>Jia Bugui has already issued orders to him.</p>

    <p>Even if today, Wang Ling takes away all the game coins from his game arcade. Even if the arcade goes bankrupt and loses everything... I still have to play with him...</p>

    <p>The person in charge of this arcade was stunned on the spot after hearing this.</p>

    <p>"Boss... are you serious?" Just a few minutes ago on the phone, he confirmed with Jia Bugui again.</p>

    <p>As everyone knows, Jia Bugui answered the phone and said righteously: "Of course I am serious!"</p>

    <p>After all.</p>

    <p>It's his brother's birthday...</p>

    <p>My brother wants to play. Of course I have to play with him!</p>

    <p>Anyway, even if the arcade goes bankrupt...</p>

    <p>It's not his money...</p>
