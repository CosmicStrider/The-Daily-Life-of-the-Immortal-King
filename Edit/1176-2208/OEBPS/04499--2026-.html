  <h1>Chapter 2026 Chinese people don't lie to Chinese people</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: Xiao Liang. Internet name: Infinite Xiaoliang.</p>

    <p>Nicknames: Dr. Xiao, Mr. Hidden Fox.</p>

    <p>Occupation: A professional popular science scholar in the world of cultivation.</p>

    <p>However, what Mr. Zanghu didn't expect was that this trip to the bottom of the sea completely subverted his previous understanding. It even broke his three views...</p>

    <p>First of all, he also wanted to know very much. Why did the creatures he made up out of thin air actually appear on the bottom of the sea?</p>

    <p>Obviously, this is something that is difficult to explain scientifically.</p>

    <p>A primate creature that has lived in the deep sea for a long time. The sea orangutan...actually existed in front of him. And it was temporarily domesticated at this moment. It became a warrior who escorted the submarine.</p>

    <p>This gave Mr. Zanghu a dreamlike feeling.</p>

    <p>Of course, what made him even more dreamlike was what happened later. That was when he found that the high school student named Wang standing next to him suddenly had a six-pointed star mark between his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>This is the sign of the array master. In other words, the one who is actually mind-controlling this sea gorilla... is this ordinary-looking high school student?</p>

    <p>Are you already so brave in the current Foundation Building period?</p>

    <p>This was the first time a sea gorilla appeared in front of him whose habits he didn't quite understand... And judging from its strength, this sea gorilla was not low-level. At least it was equal to his strength. It was a person whose strength was equivalent to Nascent's. A fourth-level high-level spiritual beast in the Soul stage!</p>

    <p>A high school boy in the Foundation Building period controls a level four high-level spiritual beast...</p>

    <p>This...are you sure you won't have a mental breakdown?</p>

    <p>Looking at the suspicion on Mr. Zanghu's face again, Immortal Toya coughed quickly and said: "This is me deliberately training my disciple's willpower. Mr. Zanghu, mind control. You know. Only the master can control it." Only when people's mental concentration is extremely concentrated can they exercise well."</p>

    <p>"That's... that's natural..." Mr. Zanghu nodded.</p>

    <p>In fact, my heart is roaring.</p>

    <p>Exercise the mental willpower of the controller. These words sound reasonable. But Mr. Zanghu feels that there is something wrong!</p>

    <p>This is a fourth-level high-level spiritual beast!</p>

    <p>It's not something that a high school student in the Foundation Building period can control his mind at all!</p>

    <p>Even if the formation is arranged by you!</p>

    <p>But the person in charge is not your apprentice in the Foundation Building period!</p>

    <p>At this time, Immortal Toya's cheeks were dripping with cold sweat. Seeing that the matter was about to be exposed, he quickly bowed to Wang Ling: "Ling Zhen..."</p>

    <p>He originally wanted to say it to Wang Ling. Otherwise, it would be better for him to be the main controller. As a result, he almost shouted Wang Ling "Ling Zhenren" out of habit.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>At this time, Mr. Zanghu's eyes became even more suspicious: "What is Ling Zhen?"</p>

    <p>"Hahaha. You heard wrong, Mr. Zanghu. What I said is, it's really unbelievable... I didn't expect that my disciple would make such great progress."</p>

    <p>"Immortal. My level is low. You really don't want to lie to me..."</p>

    <p>"No way. Mr. Zanghu. Chinese people don't lie to Chinese people."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>Under the escort of sea orangutans, the submarine dived to a position of four thousand meters under the sea. A huge undersea undercurrent surged from the depths, forming a shock wave that went straight to the submarine.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had a premonition long ago. He controlled the sea orangutan to use his huge body to cover the submarine to resist it. This was not a naturally formed undercurrent. It was a certain group living on the bottom of the sea that had sensed the signal of foreign invasion and was intruding on them. The behavior issues a warning.</p>

    <p>The orangutan has a huge body. Its huge body is like a copper wall. It firmly protects the submarine and uses its solid back muscles to share the damage of this undercurrent.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the advanced sonar receiving device in the submarine also received the signal. After the system analyzed the sonar, a series of whale whistles came from it.</p>

    <p>"Is this... the voice of a spirit whale?" Sun Rong's expression suddenly became tense.</p>

    <p>"It's not the spirit whale as we understand it. I heard it. It sounds like the sound of a sword whale. Their sound is sharper than that of a spirit whale. And they also have a strong sense of territory." Mr. Zanghu analyzed it just from the sound. Come to a conclusion.</p>

    <p>Sword whale. As the name suggests, it is an undersea spirit beast with a spiritual sword tail. The group has a wide range of growth. Young sword whales are second-level high-level spirit beasts when they are born. Adult sword whales can even reach the fifth-level primary level.</p>

    <p>Just like what Mr. Zanghu said, sword whales have a strong sense of territory. They can use the ocean currents to draw sword energy by swinging their tails in the shape of spiritual swords. They form water swords in an instant. They can target prey or other places at extremely long distances. Perform sword energy piercing. Known as a family of undersea swordsmen.</p>

    <p>In today's swordsmanship circle, cultivators have learned many swordsmanship techniques through studying sword whales.</p>

    <p>"Whoosh! Whoosh!"</p>

    <p>At this time, Immortal Toya's ears twitched. Although he was in the submarine, the sound of swords in the water released by the sword whales below still reached his ears.</p>

    <p>"No! They're attacking!"</p>

    <p>Because they stayed here for too long, they were already regarded as intruders by the sword whales. Therefore, they launched an attack without mercy.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling. Naturally, I also heard the sound of the sword whale attacking.</p>

    <p>This is the instinctive defense reaction of the creatures on the seabed. It is a very natural thing. But if you want to reach deeper and find the spirit whale, you must pass through the territory of the sword whale.</p>

    <p>So thinking of this, Wang Ling faced the swords in the water shooting from all directions. He raised his arms.</p>

    <p>Under the mind control circle of the six-pointed star seal, the gorilla guarding the submarine assumed the same posture as him. However, along with the one-hand seal, part of Wang Ling's spiritual power was directly connected through the circle. Come to this sea gorilla.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>A dazzling sword light erupted from the sea gorilla's palm, almost lighting up the entire seabed in a brief moment.</p>

    <p>This is the Palm Sword Barrier derived from the Palm Sword. Wherever the light reaches is the defense range. All sword energy shot within the sword barrier will be dispelled and invisible.</p>

    <p>Obviously, the sword whales below had never seen such a formation. They were all frightened for a while and let out even more intense roars.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't want to disturb them. But it was a helpless move. At the same time, he also wanted to avoid casualties as much as possible. Therefore, he used this method to protect the submarine's progress.</p>

    <p>Every living thing on the earth has its own value and meaning (except mosquitoes)...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. A few minutes ago, Sun Yiyuan had already arrived above the East Huaxiu Sea in Songhai City with his extended spirit sword.</p>

    <p>"Strange. Rongrong's spiritual power signal is getting weaker and weaker. But it is clearly right here." Sun Yiyuan frowned. He stared at the light spot on the watch where the signal was gradually weakening. He was puzzled: "Could it be. She went under the sea?"</p>

    <p>Not good...</p>

    <p>He immediately sighed and smiled bitterly in his heart.</p>

    <p>It seems...Rongrong already knows that the Sun family's ancestral land is in the belly of the spirit whale...</p>

    <p>She is indeed the granddaughter of Sun Yiyuan. www.uukanshu.net She is so smart!</p>

    <p>There is no other way. The purpose of his trip now is to prevent Sun Rong from making mistakes.</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, Sun Yiyuan did not hesitate. He jumped directly into the seabed with his body. Then he dived quickly to look for the spiritual signal of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>As the surrounding environment became darker and darker, a bright light deep under the sea suddenly caught his attention.</p>

    <p>"That's..." Sun Yiyuan frowned.</p>

    <p>Because at this time, he felt another familiar spiritual power.</p>

    <p>Strange. Why is the spiritual power of classmate Wang Ling also at the bottom of the sea?</p>

    <p>After a brief period of doubt, as the CP leader of LingRong Party, Sun Yiyuan's smile gradually became crazier...</p>
