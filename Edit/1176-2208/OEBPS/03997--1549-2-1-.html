  <h1>Chapter 1549 Corpse Map Research</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The two chaos devices were beaten to pieces. It seems to Zheng that there is no possibility of repair.</p>

    <p>This is also one of the flaws of this chaotic thing...</p>

    <p>Because there is no material in the world that can replace this natural material derived from chaos.</p>

    <p>If the magic weapon is worn out, it can still be soaked in chaos for maintenance.</p>

    <p>But there must be a gap or something. Chaos cannot be repaired.</p>

    <p>Not to mention the current situation where his body is shattered to pieces.</p>

    <p>Even if there is only a small scratch on the computer, it cannot be restored by immersing it in chaos.</p>

    <p>Regarding this point, Zheng actually has a grudge in his heart.</p>

    <p>It's really a headache that this product from Chaos doesn't have "shattered screen protection."</p>

    <p>So now when the Chaos Armor appeared in front of Zheng intact, the expression on Zheng's face was extremely surprised.</p>

    <p>"Since this Chaos Armor can be repaired... then my Corpse Map..." Zheng said suspiciously.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's strength is astonishing. He admitted that he underestimated the young man.</p>

    <p>He didn't expect to be able to repair the Chaos Device.</p>

    <p>However, Chaos Armor and Corpse Map are essentially the same thing.</p>

    <p>So since Chaos Armor can be repaired, his Corpse Map should theoretically be repaired as well.</p>

    <p>"The Corpse Map has indeed been restored." A monk does not lie. The monk understands Zheng's temper, so it would be better to be more honest.</p>

    <p>"Where's the picture?"</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren said. I want to study it for a few days. I will return it to you when the study is completed."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>ZhengThe corners of his mouth twitched: "Can you give me a deadline?"</p>

    <p>"What a deadline. It's too far-fetched."</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng put his head back on his back.</p>

    <p>The expression on his face was as kind as ever: "I'll tell you the truth, poor monk. Since these two chaos weapons have been defeated and smashed to pieces in battles before, they have no special value to Ling Zhenren. He won't drag them away on purpose. Not returning it."</p>

    <p>Hearing this. Zheng took a deep breath.</p>

    <p>After a great battle, two Chaos Devices that had been beyond repair were restored.</p>

    <p>This can be considered an unexpected surprise.</p>

    <p>Since that young man had the intention to send the monk to return the Chaos Armor to him, it meant that he really didn't mean to be greedy for his two treasures.</p>

    <p>The formation history of the Corpse Map is older than that of the Chaos Armor. It is an eternal thing.</p>

    <p>Zheng is thinking about it. Wang Ling may be interested in things of eternity.</p>

    <p>I want to use the Corpse Map to ask about those eternal strong men who were suppressed in the map...</p>

    <p>This idea seems a bit crazy at Zheng.</p>

    <p>Because these suppressed eternal strong men have been sealed in the map for a long time. Their souls are imprisoned and cannot get out. They have already gone insane and become lunatics.</p>

    <p>You can never expect a mentally ill person to confess something to you...</p>

    <p>So. Regarding what monk Jin Deng said.</p>

    <p>Zheng didn't care too much: "That's okay. If he is willing to keep it, just keep it and look at it. This picture will just look like that after looking at it for a long time. It's not interesting."</p>

    <p>I know a lot about Corpse Map. Zheng.</p>

    <p>A picture was unfolded. It was full of bones. There were no young ladies wearing stockings, nor were there any beautiful young female college students... Even if there were, they were just red and pink skeletons.</p>

    <p>After looking at it for a long time, apart from being able to clearly count the number of bones in the bodies of men and women, it seems to have no extra value.</p>

    <p>Zheng feels that as long as Wang Ling gets tired of it after studying it, he may be able to return it to himself in a short time.</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, he turned around and placed his hand on the mouth of the seven-color astrolabe behind him.</p>

    <p>Just as he was about to enter his password, he discovered that Monk Jin Deng had not left yet.</p>

    <p>Zheng: "?"</p>

    <p>Monk: "The poor monk has come a long way to send back the Chaos Armor. You won't be so stingy that you won't even give me a cup of tea, right?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Zheng was silent for a moment.</p>

    <p>In fact, he doesn't hate monks.</p>

    <p>It's just that he has always been a loner. He has never brought anyone else back to his mansion.</p>

    <p>Now in this area, there are only two of them.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren and the monk.</p>

    <p>One is a direct disciple of Dao Ancestor. The other can be regarded as his old acquaintance.</p>

    <p>"Go in. Don't move things." Zheng warned coldly.</p>

    <p>Then twist the palm of your hand and open the channel of the astrolabe.</p>

    <p>The monk smiled and stepped in with his hind legs.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Fenmu Shen suddenly opened his eyes in the Devouring Star.</p>

    <p>It looks like everything is going well...</p>

    <p>Everything was within Fenmu Shen's expectation.</p>

    <p>Including the fact that Peng Xiren's soul will be taken away by Zheng.</p>

    <p>"What's the next step, senior, plan to do?" Akano Sekitora asked, "Are you going to save senior Xiren?"</p>

    <p>"save?"</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen smiled.</p>

    <p>Because. He no longer needs Peng Xiren...</p>

    <p>This is a chess game.</p>

    <p>From the moment Peng Xiren made up his mind to go to the earth to cause trouble for Wang Ling, he had already made up his mind.</p>

    <p>This guy still lost because he was too young and too cautious.</p>

    <p>In order to make first-hand insurance preparations, he actually placed his body in the Devouring Star and sent his soul to the earth...</p>

    <p>Started as early as that time.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen thought of a plan to get the best of both worlds.</p>

    <p>Including later sending out ancient magic soldiers, pretending to rescue Peng Xiren. In fact, they wanted to attract Zheng to Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>Let Zheng take over this plan to rescue Peng Xiren...</p>

    <p>The premise of this plan is that he must know that Zheng still exists in this universe.</p>

    <p>And this.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen has felt the presence of Zheng for the first time since she and Peng Xiren decided to cooperate together.</p>

    <p>Only Peng Xiren is still in the dark.</p>

    <p>His familiarity with Dao Ancestor Wang and Zheng was actually far beyond what Peng Xiren thought.</p>

    <p>And now. Peng Xiren's soul was brought back to his residence by Zheng.</p>

    <p>This was actually part of his calculation.</p>

    <p>As long as Peng Xiren can't come out...</p>

    <p>Then his next plan can be realized.</p>

    <p>"The next thing. I don't need him anymore." Fenmu Shen said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"But the location of the Sky Tomb... only Senior Xiren knows..."</p>

    <p>"That's right." Fenmu Shen nodded. He immediately turned his gaze and looked at the body of Peng Xiren with his eyes closed: "And his mistake was that he left this body in the Devouring Star."</p>

    <p>Akano Sekitora looked stunned: "..."</p>

    <p>He didn't expect that the Fenmu Shen in front of him was actually this kind of Fenmu Shen.</p>

    <p>In the end, what he wanted was not the tomb itself at all. It turned out to be the body of senior Peng Xiren...</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen glanced at Akano Sekitora.</p>

    <p>He didn't pay attention to the strange thoughts in the other person's mind.</p>

    <p>His original plan was to cooperate with Peng Xiren. After opening the Heavenly Tomb and devouring the other half of his soul to increase his strength. Then he would devour Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>And now this plan is Plan Number 2.</p>

    <p>The only difference from Plan 1 is that Peng Xiren's soul is still held captive by Zheng.</p>

    <p>He couldn't swallow it.</p>

    <p>But swallowing or not swallowing. It makes no difference to Fenmu Shen.</p>

    <p>His original purpose was just to get back his own things that were sealed in the tomb...</p>

    <p>"Delightful... Go. Take me to the directions of the Heavenly Tomb..."</p>

    <p>At this time, Fenmu Shen opened his evil eyes. He placed his hand on Peng Xiren's body and called softly.</p>

    <p>This is a simple spell that awakens muscle memory.</p>

    <p>Even if Peng Xiren's soul is not here, his physical body has only visited the location of the celestial tomb.</p>

    <p>Driven by this spell, they will act automatically like a walking zombie...</p>

    <p>And all Fenmu Shen has to do is follow Peng Xiren's physical body.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren, who had his eyes closed tightly, suddenly released a red light.</p>

    <p>Immediately afterwards, he stood up slowly. His body moved. Then the starlight under his feet took hold little by little.</p>

    <p>In the next breath, the whole person disappeared directly into the Devouring Star.</p>

    <p>"You are waiting here. Wait for my return." Fenmu Shen left a message to Akano Sekitora, the Silverskin King and Jiugong Xinghui. Immediately, the whole person disappeared in an instant. He followed Peng Xiren's body.</p>

    <p>Just waiting for him to merge with the other half of the soul locked in the tomb.</p>

    <p>All this has come to an end.</p>

    <p>He no longer has to wait for Peng Xiren's arrangements. He acts based on anyone's face...</p>

    <p>Because by that time, he will have ten times the power he had in his heyday!</p>

    <p>It can truly be omnipotent and destroy everything.</p>

    <p>Even if Zheng appears, it is impossible for him to be his opponent...</p>

    <p>Traveling along the infinite galaxy for countless billions of light years.</p>

    <p>The universe here gradually becomes "clear."</p>

    <p>The reason why it is said to be clear is because Fenmu Shen discovered that there are very few galaxies in this space.</p>

    <p>Even the meteorites floating in the air seemed to be reduced a lot.</p>

    <p>After looking at the deep, chaotic, and complicated star map of the universe, even Fenmu Shen discovered for the first time that there is such a unique "Peach Blossom Land" in this infinite galaxy.</p>

    <p>It's so clean here.</p>

    <p>It seems like an unpolluted place.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen can even feel the flow of air in space...</p>

    <p>All those things that go against common sense have been fully reflected in this universe.</p>

    <p>"Is the location of the celestial tomb right here?" Fenmu Shen asked with a deep look.</p>

    <p>No wonder he has been trying to explore the location of the Sky Tomb in the infinite galaxy for so many years, but has never been found.</p>

    <p>The infinite galaxy is too vast. There are too many mysterious places that he has never thought of... If he searches according to basic common sense, he will definitely not get any results.</p>

    <p>Ahead. Peng Xiren's physical body has slowed down and finally stopped at a certain coordinate.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen couldn't help but laugh: "You spent such a huge price to seal me for so many years... I'm afraid you didn't expect it. Today's seal was led by your most proud disciple to break through it, right?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Peng Xiren raised his hand expressionlessly and waved the Qiankun password in his hand.</p>

    <p>A rift in space appeared that was just big enough for one person to pass through.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen thought that the passage was about to open. However, at this moment, a sound of bells suddenly came from the crack.</p>

    <p>An old woman with a stooped back and a lantern walked out of the crack.</p>

    <p>The handle of this lantern is a dragon head. At first glance, it looks like an eternal thing.</p>

    <p>And under the lantern, there was a series of golden bells hanging. As the old woman staggered out, they kept swaying and making crisp sounds...</p>

    <p>The sound made Fenmu Shen a little unhappy.</p>

    <p>The bell is not a mortal thing. It is obviously an object from all eternity. It is a lantern made of chaos. There is also a string of bells also from chaos hanging at the bottom.</p>

    <p>"Who..." the old woman said.</p>

    <p>The sound was not loud, but it was like a heavenly bell in this space. The sound wave spread out and gradually became stronger. In the end, it was like a tsunami, and the surrounding wind was strong.</p>

    <p>There was an explosion in the distance.</p>

    <p>The old woman's greeting directly caused a violent reaction in the space, which spread to far away places.</p>

    <p>Those harsh wind whistles are actually the wails of the planet spirits.</p>

    <p>"Interesting." Fenmu Shen opened his spiritual shield and stood still. Such a show of force could not stop him.</p>

    <p>"I have been ordered by Dao Ancestor to guard the Sky Tomb. No one is allowed to approach." The old woman looked at the evil-eyed creature in front of her.</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen flew through the void. He maintained his posture of sitting cross-legged. He was aloof and arrogant.</p>

    <p>There are blood-colored war lines tattooed on the dark purple skin. On the skinny cheeks that look like there is no moisture at all, there are three evil eyes that do not belong to humans.</p>

    <p>The jet black mane was braided into two twists and hung down along the temples.</p>

    <p>She actually knows the origin of Fenmu Shen... Those evil eyes are his biggest symbol.</p>

    <p>Just by looking at it, one can recognize that this person is the terrifying creature that Dao Ancestor Wang spent a huge price to deal with back then.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the old woman did not dare to show any slackness in her eyes.</p>

    <p>The location of the Sky Tomb is a secret. No one except Peng Xiren can find it.</p>

    <p>Regarding the sudden appearance of Fenmu Shen, the old woman understood everything after seeing Peng Xiren being manipulated like a puppet.</p>

    <p>"Those who forcefully break into the tomb will die..." The old woman had no other words.</p>

    <p>As the guardian of the Sky Tomb, she must complete the mission given to her by Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>Even if it ends up costing her life, she must do everything possible to stop the person in front of her.</p>

    <p>Although the old woman knew it in her heart. At this moment, there was a huge disparity in strength between her and Fenmu Shen...</p>

    <p>"The universe is going to be in chaos..." The old woman said in her heart before she decided to take action.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>The next moment, I saw the old woman holding the lantern in her hand. She opened the top of the lantern and took out the white flame inside with two fingers. Then she fired towards Fenmu Shen with a flick of her fingertips!</p>

    <p>"Go!" the old woman shouted softly.</p>

    <p>This small cluster of white lamp flames suddenly burst into a brilliance as devastating as a star!</p>

    <p>The white flame turned into a one-horned unicorn. It rolled its iron hooves and rushed toward Fenmu Shen!</p>

    <p>The scene created by this small white flame was vast and infinite. For a moment, the space was swept into a sea of spiritual beings.</p>

    <p>Almost every inch of the city was in riots.</p>

    <p>Looking at this scene, Fenmu Shen closed the spiritual shield and allowed himself to be baptized by the white flame. It was just a slight burning sensation. It was not very painful.</p>

    <p>The old woman's eyes were horrified. She didn't expect that her Sea and Sky Holy Flame would actually fail. It was a kind of eternal flame. It collected the core flames of hundreds of millions of stars and cultivated the most powerful holy flame!</p>

    <p>But now, this sea and sky holy flame has no effect on Fenmu Shen at all.</p>

    <p>The old woman's pupils were shocked. Although she had already expected that there was a gap in combat power between herself and the monster in front of her, she did not expect that the monster would be so strong...</p>

    <p>"Is that it? Then... it's my turn to take action..."</p>

    <p>At this time, Fenmu Shen in front of him shuddered: "The weak retreat!"</p>

    <p>Then he stretched out his finger. A powerful spiritual light shot out from his fingertips, directly splitting the white sea of fire in front of him into two!</p>

    <p>By the time the old woman came to her senses, Fenmu Shen had already come from across the sea and pinched her head...</p>
