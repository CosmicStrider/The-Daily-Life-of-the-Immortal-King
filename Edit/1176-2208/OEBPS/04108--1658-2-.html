  <h1>Chapter 1658 A group of 2 people who ruined the place</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Melissa's calculation was more accurate than Li Xian imagined.</p>

    <p>This result was honestly a bit beyond his expectation.</p>

    <p>She is not a liar. In Li Xian's opinion, the accuracy of astrological divination is barely adequate. The only pity is that the amount of information is still too little.</p>

    <p>Accuracy is one thing. But as an excellent astrological fortune teller, it is more important to be able to sort out your own clues from the starry sky and accurately tell as many things as possible about what you see.</p>

    <p>Although Melissa's accuracy rate is high, it also shows that she may have seen very little information.</p>

    <p>Because the information obtained from the astrology is true or false. These require astrology fortune tellers to distinguish between right and wrong.</p>

    <p>As for some uncertain information, under normal circumstances, astrology fortune tellers will choose to remain silent and only tell the news that they are confident about.</p>

    <p>In this way, you will appear to be very noble.</p>

    <p>For example. Regarding "Is there a second season of The Daily Life of the Immortal King?"</p>

    <p>All Melissa saw was that there was.</p>

    <p>And Li Xian also saw other information from the stars.</p>

    <p>For example, the second season of The Daily Life of the Immortal King also contains the following elements...</p>

    <p>Demon Realm Chapter (Er Ha Chapter)√</p>

    <p>Wang Ling crushes everything√</p>

    <p>Beat up the demon saint√</p>

    <p>Show off every episode√</p>

    <p>Invisible candy √</p>

    <p>The whole process is easy and smooth √</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Melissa could not tell the above information from astrology.</p>

    <p>Of course. Maybe you can see it. But you can't tell right from wrong.</p>

    <p>Seeing Li Xian and Zhang Zhui staring at her for a long time, Melissa immediately ended her work. She turned to look at them and said, "Two gentlemen, would you like to try fortune telling? You two. I am a new user. You can perform fortune divination and question divination at the same time today."</p>

    <p>"Do you divine fortune?" Li Xian said with a gentle smile, "I know that a skilled fortune teller can change fortune. Can you do the same?"</p>

    <p>Melissa showed a professional smile: "According to the different changes in the stars. Combined with each person's own zodiac sign, there will naturally be strong and weak fortunes. It is impossible for someone to have excellent fortune every day."</p>

    <p>"Oh? Is there such a thing?" Zhang Zhui was doubtful.</p>

    <p>He actually doesn't believe these things.</p>

    <p>After all, in the Eternal Era, everything he did was always smooth... The only mistake he made was at the hands of Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>Daily fortune calculation. It is free for members.</p>

    <p>But in fact, this seemingly free project actually knows its tricks.</p>

    <p>When she heard that these two new customers were interested in fortune, Melissa knew immediately. She would complete her daily KPI ahead of schedule today.</p>

    <p>"The so-called luck change only uses some auxiliary props to achieve the effect of balancing the luck stars. That is, absorbing a little bit of the luck of the people around you, thereby diluting some of the bad luck on your body. This way you will not look so unfortunate. Already."</p>

    <p>Melissa talked eloquently and looked very professional.</p>

    <p>But in front of an expert like Li Xian.</p>

    <p>This is just a trick.</p>

    <p>Luck stars are indeed special stars that can affect luck.</p>

    <p>And it is indeed possible to use some special props with astrological spells to guide the luck of the person who is most blessed by the luck star to those who need to change their luck.</p>

    <p>But such a method requires extremely sophisticated means.</p>

    <p>Li Xian. Of course it can be done.</p>

    <p>But Melissa...</p>

    <p>He judged that given this lady's ability, she might not be able to do such a thing.</p>

    <p>However, the situation has not yet been clarified. Li Xian cannot directly label Melissa as a deceiver.</p>

    <p>Then he said in a tentative tone: "So Ms. Melissa, in this astrology club, is there any better astrologer than you?"</p>

    <p>"No more. I'm ranked number one." Melissa shook her head.</p>

    <p>Li Xian, Zhang Zhui: "..."</p>

    <p>Okay. Liar is real...</p>

    <p>But Li Xian is actually very interested in astrological divination.</p>

    <p>After all, their purpose is not to divine horoscopes, fortune, or tell fortunes.</p>

    <p>But I want to get some specific information.</p>

    <p>Of course Li Xian can also use astrology to deduce information.</p>

    <p>But you have to do this through astrology. The crystal balls used for divination are of very high quality.</p>

    <p>The crystal ball of this club is too inferior. It may affect the calculation results.</p>

    <p>Of course. The most important thing is.</p>

    <p>The opponent is an eternal level strong man. He will definitely be prepared in this regard.</p>

    <p>It wouldn't be good if we just alert the enemy.</p>

    <p>Therefore, using human flesh to obtain information is currently the best result.</p>

    <p>"Okay, Ms. Melissa, we need to do fortune telling." At this time, Li Xian said.</p>

    <p>"Welcome. Then, gentlemen, please come with me. The fortune telling is in another room." Melissa bowed and led the two of them into a room dedicated to fortune telling based on astrology.</p>

    <p>In order to avoid the mutual influence of fortune and those around you, fortune divination through astrology requires an individual.</p>

    <p>After Li Xian and Zhang Zhui communicated through eye contact, Li Xian finally entered the room with velvet carpets first.</p>

    <p>After closing the door, Melissa put on a special gauze dress made of amethyst, covering her body tightly.</p>

    <p>This is to prevent the astrologer responsible for divination from affecting the fortune of the fortune teller.</p>

    <p>"Sit down, Mr. Li."</p>

    <p>Then, Melissa and Li Xian sat down, facing each other.</p>

    <p>Different from the crystal ball used for astrology in "Weekly Q&amp;A", the crystal ball used to test fortune is pure black. It is as deep as a black hole.</p>

    <p>Li Xian pretended not to know and asked: "So Ms. Melissa, what should I do? Put my hand up?"</p>

    <p>"Well. Please clear your mind of distractions. Then put your hands up. Think of a happy thing first, and then think of a sad thing." Melissa said.</p>

    <p>"Okay." Li Xian nodded cooperatively.</p>

    <p>However, things were beyond Melissa's expectation.</p>

    <p>Because after the first round of calculations, she didn't even see Li Xian's fortune position at all.</p>

    <p>"This..." She told Li Xian with slight surprise in her eyes. There was something wrong with Melissa's horoscope.</p>

    <p>"What happened. Ms. Melissa?" Li Xian laughed.</p>

    <p>Melissa closed her eyes without admitting defeat. She tried her best to calculate. Then the next second, she stood up suddenly: "This... this is impossible! Why is your luck so good! I have never seen a lucky star. People who have perfect luck numbers!"</p>

    <p>"Because measuring fortune through astrology is inherently inaccurate."</p>

    <p>Li Xian smiled calmly: "With Ms. Melissa's knowledge. Since you know about the Lucky Star. Then you should also know about the existence of the Seat of Destiny, right?"</p>

    <p>"Destiny... The Seat of Destiny..."</p>

    <p>"It's called destiny. Fate. That's where the luck comes in. A practitioner who has studied astrology. Can light up their own destiny through astrology. So as to achieve the goal of eternal luck."</p>

    <p>"Senior, who are you..." Melissa was shocked.</p>

    <p>"Do you want to learn? I can teach you."</p>

    <p>Li Xian touched the black crystal ball. He smiled and said, "But the premise is that you have to exchange it for something."</p>

    <p>When Melissa heard this sentence, she immediately thought for a long time, as if she was experiencing some fierce ideological struggle.</p>

    <p>A few minutes later, Li Xian asked: "How is it? Have you thought about it clearly?"</p>

    <p>Melissa was startled out of her senses. Then she nodded her head as if she had made up her mind: "I... I know, senior."</p>

    <p>And then. She started in front of Li Xian. Took off her amethyst veil, blouse...</p>

    <p>At that moment. Li Xian was horrified and grabbed her by the arm: "What are you doing..."</p>

    <p>"Didn't the senior say. Do you want to exchange it for something?"</p>

    <p>"But I didn't say I wanted you to give yourself to me..."</p>
