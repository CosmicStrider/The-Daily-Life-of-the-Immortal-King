  <h1>Chapter 2094 Script. In the hands of Director Wang</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Seeing the self-proclaimed "Er Qiao" Qiao Yanyuan solemnly kowtow in worship, everyone's faces were full of astonishment.</p>

    <p>Because this matter from beginning to end. Logically speaking, it is impossible to involve Mr. Boss Sun no matter what... Then how did Mr. Boss Sun become the savior?</p>

    <p>Who told him this?</p>

    <p>"It seems that someone helped him lock this place. I'm afraid he won't be able to directly travel through the multi-layered space just by relying on his own strength." The fifth map location. Wang Ying analyzed from the air. He and Sun Ying'er's information was synchronized. Therefore, Able to respond to each other from a distance and simultaneously receive information from there.</p>

    <p>And everything was seen by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Just like that time when the soul traveled through eternity, there was someone behind the scenes who took care of everything.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling actually doesn't like this feeling of being arranged. It feels like being peeped into life. Obviously he is the only one who peeks at other people's screens...</p>

    <p>The time when the soul traveled through eternity. Emperor Dongda denied that the mastermind behind this was Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>Of course, it is also possible that Emperor Dongda did not have the ability to know that everything was planned and arranged by Dao Ancestor Wang, and was fooled by this old man.</p>

    <p>As for Wang Ling, he actually figured it out now. He didn't need to worry too much about the identity of the person behind this. On the one hand, he wanted to continue to explore the ancestral land of the Sun family and verify his conjecture by identifying the true identity of the founder of the Sun family.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, he has already written the script to deal with Qiao Yanyuan. Everything is proceeding step by step.</p>

    <p>Some people have already written the ending of the story.</p>

    <p>But now, the one who is directing this drama is himself.</p>

    <p>How the story will end is not yet certain.</p>

    <p>As for who will become the final savior. Wang Ling is not interested.</p>

    <p>After all, once you become the so-called savior, you will inevitably be shrouded in the halo of praise from the world. This is also something Wang Ling does not want.</p>

    <p>The society may be very difficult.</p>

    <p>Saving the earth and maintaining peace in the universe is also difficult.</p>

    <p>The most difficult thing is that a sociophobic patient has to shoulder the work of saving the earth and maintaining peace in the universe...</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling couldn't help but sigh.</p>

    <p>He is really tired...</p>

    <p>Unable to delay any longer, he looked at Marmot and Sun Ru and asked them to continue leading the way.</p>

    <p>He has stayed here for too long. It's time to go deeper and reveal the truth.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, in the first map, people were questioning Mr. Er Qiao from another world and space one after another.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong did not hesitate to use the elixir in his hand to heal Er Qiao's injuries. At the same time, he used Aohai's sword energy to heal him. Finally, his bloodless face recovered a lot.</p>

    <p>"With your own strength, I don't think you have the ability to come to this place." Sun Rong questioned.</p>

    <p>Qiao Yanyuan, who calls himself Er Qiao, did not hide anything. He came here to solve the problem. Although Sun Yiyuan is unconscious now, it is the same as directly communicating with Sun Rong: "Of course he told me the identity of the savior. My benefactor sent me here."</p>

    <p>"But my level is low. You have also seen it. Only the Foundation Building... the fall just now almost killed me." Er Qiao said this with apologetic expression on his face.</p>

    <p>He was able to travel through multi-dimensional space and land accurately. And he caused so much damage to the first map. It was all because of this "benefactor."</p>

    <p>Everything is well explained.</p>

    <p>Since there is someone behind the scenes to escort him, it is not too surprising that he can travel here with his level.</p>

    <p>And it was precisely because of the escort of the person behind the scenes that Mr. Er Qiao had a thick defensive spiritual shield.</p>

    <p>And this thick spiritual shield directly hit the ground after he fell out of the space, forming a backlash explosion. As a result, the Ice Purgatory was destroyed again.</p>

    <p>Er Qiao sighed: "My benefactor is hidden in the fog. I can't see his face clearly. I can only hear his voice."</p>

    <p>"It's useless even if you know the voice..." Sun Rong showed a bitter smile.</p>

    <p>"Indeed." Zhenyuan Immortal nodded.</p>

    <p>A powerful person of that level knows that sound is useless because it can be disguised.</p>

    <p>"I heard you say before. Our savior... that is to say, you also represent Qiao Yanyuan in other dimensions?"</p>

    <p>"That's right." Er Qiao nodded excitedly and said, "They chose me to come here. It's also because of my low level... Even if I leave, there's a high probability that he won't be discovered. Plus, I have a benefactor to cover me. All my talents So smooth."</p>

    <p>"So what is your request for coming here?"</p>

    <p>"Of course I want to bring order to the chaos... defeat him!"</p>

    <p>Er Qiao said righteously: "You have no idea what he did to us!"</p>

    <p>"I heard that Qiao Yanyuan's dragon-born ability is that he can control himself in parallel spaces. Can you concentrate your power?" Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"Yes!" Er Qiao said more and more excitedly: "He established a connection with us in the parallel space through his own ability, forcing us to practice. Even if we have no qualifications to practice, he will not let it go! We will not let it go! We have to get up before dawn and practice the exercises. If we slack off even a little bit, he will give us an unbearable headache!"</p>

    <p>"..." Sun Rong is silent.</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. She always thinks this sounds so much like class...</p>

    <p>And from the description Sun Rong, I feel that this thing of holding on to my continuous cultivation in the parallel space is like the head teacher supervising the students' study. It actually has something to do with a well-known closed cultivation academy. Amazing similarity!</p>

    <p>And this Mr. Er Qiao is obviously a "bad student" in Qiao Yanyuan's eyes. Because he has no cultivation qualifications. Even if he follows the instructions to practice, he will not make much progress. In this case, Qiao Yanyuan will not care about such a low-level person. The space body "ran away from home" with the help of others.</p>

    <p>After all, Qiao Yanyuan's ability is to absorb himself from other parallel dimensions, thereby causing his realm to expand rapidly. The stronger the average ability of the space body, the stronger his own strength will be.</p>

    <p>"At Qiao Yanyuan's level, it stands to reason that even if your talent is not good, there should be ways to change your physique." At this time, Zhenyuan Immortal said.</p>

    <p>"That's true. But I just can't learn it! Moreover, my hometown has very thin spiritual energy. It's a matter of the cultivation environment. He can't interfere just by manipulating me. Besides, this is really a learning process. No. Naturally, I have made no progress at all... The point is, he is not fair at all!"</p>

    <p>"Unfair? How do you say that?"</p>

    <p>"This is a joint accusation from other space bodies. There are other space bodies that complained to me. He has special care for those space bodies that have achieved success in cultivation! Even if they have not completed the set cultivation growth value, as long as they give him benefits... You can avoid the pain and not be disturbed by him!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>
