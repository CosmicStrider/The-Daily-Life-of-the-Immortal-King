  <h1>Chapter 1626 Destroy it. Hurry up</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When the slime man said this, he didn't realize that a crisis was about to come.</p>

    <p>This is really too perverted...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong thought of being touched by a man other than Wang Ling. A feeling of nausea arose in his heart. Especially since this slime man was extremely insignificant.</p>

    <p>She originally wanted to infiltrate a little deeper and take down the entire organization at once.</p>

    <p>But now, the ideological roots of this organization are very problematic.</p>

    <p>In broad daylight, the world is bright. He actually wants to attack an underage girl... Is this still a human being?</p>

    <p>Although Sun Rong is very dissatisfied with some of Jiang Yingying's actions, and there are actually conflicts between the two. But even for Martial Saint Jiang's sake, as long as she still calls Martial Saint uncle, at least it will be safe. She can still take care of all aspects of the problem.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong endured all the way. The slime man took him into a shower room.</p>

    <p>When the door is closed.</p>

    <p>Only Sun Rong and the slime man were left in the shower room of the base.</p>

    <p>The slime man took off the palm part of his biochemical coat. He rubbed his hands with a sly expression: "Miss Jiang. I'm sorry, I couldn't bear it anymore!"</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry. I can't bear it anymore..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong said with his head slightly lowered.</p>

    <p>The slime man couldn't see his face clearly. Hearing this, he was overjoyed: "Hahaha! I didn't expect that we actually like each other! Since we can't help it anymore, let's start quickly!"</p>

    <p>"Fuck...fuck you!"</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking. Sun Rong could no longer bear the sight of this wretched slime man.</p>

    <p>A blue sword energy came out of the market. The powerful sword pressure fell suddenly. It was as powerful as a looming threat.</p>

    <p>The slime man fell to his knees on the spot. At the same time, the skin on his face was trembling wildly. He showed an expression of disbelief: "You..."</p>

    <p>As a quality beautiful girl who has received compulsory education all year round, Sun Rong almost never speaks dirty words. But just now she lost her temper because of a slime man.</p>

    <p>This made the anger already in her heart even worse.</p>

    <p>"That's it."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong pointed his sword energy and knocked the slime man in front of him unconscious.</p>

    <p>Her chest was heaving with anger. She felt just dizzy, as if she still wasn't relieved of her anger.</p>

    <p>"Should we castrate him?" At this time, Sun Ying'er suddenly popped up and said.</p>

    <p>"Isn't this... too bloody?" Sun Rong held his face in his hands. There was still some hesitation in his heart.</p>

    <p>"It's okay. There won't be any trauma. I've actually been studying this recently." Sun Ying'er chuckled and said, "You know, as long as that big ass presses me down for a day, I will never be able to get ahead. So. ah..."</p>

    <p>"So you want to castrate the Master of Shadows?" Sun Rong gasped. She felt that Sun Ying'er was planning to die.</p>

    <p>Although compared to Wang Ling, Wang Ying's way of expressing emotions is indeed more radical. However, such a proactive feeling makes Sun Rong extremely envious.</p>

    <p>If that wood could finally enlighten her at some point, she might be so happy that she died.</p>

    <p>Of course.</p>

    <p>She felt that Sun Ying'er was so blessed that he didn't know how to be blessed.</p>

    <p>But this is useless.</p>

    <p>This guy has been trying to commit suicide all day long... In the end, the only thing that is pitiful is his waist. And those planet spirits who are shivering every day for fear that they will be banged against the wall.</p>

    <p>"So. How to do this?" At this time, Sun Rong asked.</p>

    <p>"Just cut it off."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>"Oh. I'm not talking about cutting on his body. I'm just talking about removing the part of his shadow." Sun Ying'er replied.</p>

    <p>"Is this okay?" Sun Rong was surprised.</p>

    <p>"Of course. There will be no trauma. And the key is that no fault can be found. It's just that it can't be revived."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>This process is faster than Sun Rong imagined.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er's technique seemed to be more skillful than she imagined.</p>

    <p>It was just a small thing of an inch or two.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er directly pointed the knife at the shadow and quickly divided it: "Done!"</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Rong's mood was actually extremely complicated.</p>

    <p>But this wretched man got the punishment he deserved. Her depressed mood instantly relaxed a lot.</p>

    <p>"So what should we do now?" Sun Ying'er then asked.</p>

    <p>"First take off his biochemical coat. Let's pretend to be him and sneak in directly." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"But you have to bring someone with you... Aren't they looking for Jiang Yingying? You pretend to be him. What about Jiang Yingying?" Sun Ying'er asked.</p>

    <p>"This is easy." Sun Rong suddenly laughed and stared at Sun Ying'er.</p>

    <p>"Damn it! You don't want me to dress up as Jiang Yingying, do you?"</p>

    <p>"You look exactly like me. Anyway, they are face-blind. As long as they change their hairstyle, they probably won't be able to tell the difference. And these secular cultivators can't do anything to you."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er: "Rongrong. Are you sure you want me to pretend..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "There is no one more suitable than you. Ying'er."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er: "Then let me tell you first. If this commotion becomes too big and cannot be ended, I don't care. I'm afraid this base will be razed to the ground by then."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong looked tired: "Then destroy it. Hurry."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er: "..."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The outer conference room of the base. Liu Renfeng was sitting on a leather sofa, with a strategizing posture.</p>

    <p>At this time, a tall, thin man wearing a black suit pushed in the door. He had a special medal hanging on his body to show his status as a manager.</p>

    <p>His name is Hang Chuan. He is the chief of the intelligence section of Liu Renfeng's team.</p>

    <p>"Madam. Jiang Yingying has been brought here successfully." Hang Chuan said.</p>

    <p>"It seems a little slower than expected."</p>

    <p>"Madam, please calm down. First, that little girl is a little clever. She actually found the eldest lady of the Huaguo Shuilian Group to exchange identities. She tried to trade with the civet cat for the prince by virtue of her similar appearance."</p>

    <p>Having said that, Hang Chuan smiled and said, "Fortunately, I have seen through this plan. I caught Miss Jiang. It was a close call. The second thing is that I know that my wife has mysophobia, so I came here." Before, I asked Zhang San to take her to take a bath. Maybe it was Zhang San who was complaining."</p>

    <p>"You guys really know how to enjoy it." Liu Renfeng heard this. The expression on his face was unchanged.</p>

    <p>She would turn a blind eye to some of her subordinates' quirks, as long as they were not too outrageous.</p>

    <p>Working in the dark underground all year round. There must always be some outlet for venting.</p>

    <p>After Jiang Yingying was sacrificed, he died anyway.</p>

    <p>There seems to be nothing wrong with feeling the happiness of an adult before you die.</p>

    <p>"That's all." Liu Renfeng waved his hand. His expression was gentle: "You still know how to bring her to take a bath to see me. You are sensible."</p>

    <p>"Mrs. I appreciate it."</p>

    <p>"So. Has anyone arrived?"</p>

    <p>"Already at the door."</p>

    <p>"Bring her in." Liu Renfeng said. She didn't even raise her eyes.</p>

    <p>A moment later. When the door opened.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong escorted Sun Ying'er, disguised as Jiang Yingying, into the room.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er didn't dare to speak at all. He was afraid that he would reveal something.</p>

    <p>It wasn't until this moment that Liu Renfeng got up from his seat. He walked over and stared at her. He started looking up and down.</p>

    <p>The atmosphere instantly became tense.</p>

    <p>I watched it for about two or three minutes.</p>

    <p>Liu Renfeng just spoke slowly: "Jiang Yingying...it's really you..."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Sun Rong and Sun Ying'er breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>It makes sense...</p>

    <p>This face blindness is too much!</p>

    <p>"Well done, Zhang San." Then, Liu Renfeng looked up at Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"What are you doing standing there in a daze? Why don't you thank Madam quickly?" the intelligence section chief Hang Chuan said quickly.</p>

    <p>"eh..."Sun Rong bowed.</p>

    <p>"Well, why are you so reserved today?" Hang Chuan laughed and said, "Madam, please don't be surprised. This must be the first time he sees you. He was shocked by your majesty."</p>

    <p>"He is a capable young man. He can be promoted later."</p>

    <p>"Thank you, madam." Hang Chuan said with a social clasped fist.</p>

    <p>At this time, he looked at Sun Rong and frowned slightly: "Speaking of which, Zhang San, have you been training your chest muscles recently? Judging from this biochemical coat, your chest muscles seem to be quite big."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. When I heard this.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong actually felt a little happy.</p>
