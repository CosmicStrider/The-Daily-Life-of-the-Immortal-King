  <h1>Chapter 1866 Soul exchange across eternity</h1>

  <div>

    <p>For the skull of a spiritual beast, all these eternal dignitaries in the hall became jealous.</p>

    <p>The skull of an ancient mythical beast like this has an unusual origin. What is even more valuable is that this skull symbolizes the origin of several branches of blood. Even if you buy it and don't use it, there is still great room for appreciation if you keep it around.</p>

    <p>Of course. Although the thing is good, it is still useless for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"This skull must be purchased. I remember that you were the final recipient of this skull." At this time, Zhang Zhui said.</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda nodded: "Make a bid."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui: "How many shots should I take?"</p>

    <p>Dongda: "I didn't write down the specific details in my diary. It doesn't matter. Just make sure this skull is mine. But my suggestion is, don't bid this round. We can offer an auction item. Use this item to auction it." The funds received are used to offset this expense."</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Zhang Zhui immediately showed an expression of realization: "Yes! I remembered!!! It seems like this. You sold one thing at the beginning and bought a bunch of things with the money you got from that thing. Something... but I can't remember it. What are you selling?"</p>

    <p>After all, the timeline spans a long time. It spans eternity. Zhang Zhui only has vague memories of the past. The specific details have long been forgotten.</p>

    <p>At this time, Emperor Dongda suddenly laughed. The smile was meaningful: "This thing is not mine. This is a reference item provided by Wang Ying."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was stunned when he heard this. He didn't expect that things would fall on him again so soon.</p>

    <p>He was also thinking about what would be better to sell. However, according to the rules of the Old Wang family, he cannot use his own ability to make money. Therefore, it is obviously inappropriate to take out the magical objects in King's Pants for auction.</p>

    <p>After thinking for a long time, finally a slender object with golden glitter appeared in front of Emperor Dongda accompanied by a whirlpool.</p>

    <p>"What a powerful spiritual energy... No! It's not just spiritual energy. There are also a variety of other energy sources! And a rich energy of chaos!"</p>

    <p>This made Emperor Dongda's eyes light up instantly.</p>

    <p>There was no doubt about it. This shiny, slender object gave him the feeling of surprise as if he had drawn a golden legend.</p>

    <p>His reaction was quick. He immediately lit the lantern in front of the VIP room and called the appraiser to come upstairs.</p>

    <p>"Come, take a look. How much can this object sell for?" Dongda looked confident. He handed the golden filament to the appraiser's hands.</p>

    <p>The appraiser took it with both hands. Before appraising it, he noticed a strong fragrance.</p>

    <p>After observing carefully for a moment, the auctioneer showed a shocked expression: "I'm sorry for my blindness... I really can't tell what kind of hair this is from a mythical beast."</p>

    <p>"So. Can't sell it?"</p>

    <p>"No. Of course it can be sold!" The old appraiser said with excitement on his face: "This thing is too powerful! A small hair. Not to mention exudes the fragrance of spring breeze, it actually contains such a powerful energy."</p>

    <p>"You can get this mythical beast hair. It can be smelted into elixirs or used to refine weapons. It has extraordinary benefits! It can even be used to set up an array. Use it as an array eye!"</p>

    <p>"Formation eyes made of this hair. It can change the trend of spiritual energy in the world. It assists in spiritual gathering practice. The sect is built around this formation. There is no need to worry about the loss of spiritual energy for thousands of years."</p>

    <p>This introduction made everyone dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong laughed: "It's so valuable. Could the old gentleman be mistaken?"</p>

    <p>"I will never make a mistake! It's just that I can't tell. What kind of mythical beast's hair is this... so I plan to ask."</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry. I don't know about that either." Dongda said, spreading his hands, "I just got it accidentally. I haven't found out what kind of mythical beast it is."</p>

    <p>"There is no other way. For now, if you want to participate in the shoot, you have to package this hair." said the appraiser.</p>

    <p>"Packaging? How to package..." Wang Zhen asked.</p>

    <p>"Just complete the information and make up a story about this mythical beast hair."</p>

    <p>The old appraiser said without any surprise: "For example, the skull of the mythical beast that is being sold now. Do you think there really is a mythical beast with such a long name? That's just something we made up."</p>

    <p>"It's actually made up..." Sun Rong was shocked.</p>

    <p>"There is no other way. In order to make the products look better, of course we can only package them."</p>

    <p>The appraiser said: "The name is long. It is also to make everyone feel unfamiliar with this mythical beast. However, the bidders here are all dignitaries in the cultivation world. It is impossible to openly say that they do not know the origin of this mythical beast. So no one will care. The name of this mythical beast is authentic."</p>

    <p>"Instead, they want to show that they are familiar with this mythical beast. No matter how long the name is, they will say it completely without any mistakes or omissions."</p>

    <p>"Or do you think that such a long name is just to fill in the number of words for those unscrupulous novel writers?"</p>

    <p>"so it is!"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong suddenly realized.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Appraiser: "I am telling you this. I just want to tell you that we are working together now. In order to sell it at a high price, we need your cooperation. No matter how outrageous the story you will hear later, you must stay calm."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong dumbfounded: "But we don't know how to make up stories. The most we can think of is a name..."</p>

    <p>The appraiser thought for a while and said calmly: "This is easy. Just think of a name. Leave the rest to us."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>After about a few minutes, Liu Renwen on the stage received the hair of the mythical animal that had been temporarily added to the shoot, as well as a written explanation.</p>

    <p>The hair of the mythical beast has been covered by a cover. The packaging is extremely good.</p>

    <p>The expression on his face was very calm. He scanned the description at a glance, and then said loudly: "Dear guests, the first temporary item in this auction has been produced. This was provided by the guest in Room 1. The proceeds from the auction can be directly used for other auctions in this auction."</p>

    <p>After saying that, he opened the dark seal cover. In just a moment, the shining golden hair bloomed with dazzling light...</p>

    <p>Liu Renwen said: "As you can see, according to the professional results of our appraiser's appraisal, this is a very, very rare hair of a mythical beast! The hair of the Almighty Tianluo Raccoon Beast!"</p>

    <p>"What!? It turns out to be the hair of Almighty Tenra Raccoonmon... I, I, I've heard of this mythical beast!"</p>

    <p>"Oh my god! Such powerful spiritual energy... No! It's not just spiritual energy. There are other energies too! Especially the concentration of the chaos energy. It's really scary!"</p>

    <p>"Oh my God. It turns out to be the Almighty Tenra Raccoonmon! What is the origin of the guest in Room 1? How come there is such a divine object!"</p>

    <p>"The energy of this hair is too strong. It is far better than the skull that was just brought up... If it is refined, maybe it can lead to immortality! Fill the body and let yourself never dry up!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling didn't expect it himself. He just offered up a piece of his own hair. It would actually blow up like this.</p>
