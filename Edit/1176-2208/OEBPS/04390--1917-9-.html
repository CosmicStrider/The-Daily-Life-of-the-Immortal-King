  <h1>Chapter 1917 Teng Luchen and Nine Heavens Jingmi Courtyard</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The man who called himself Jing Heqiu waited for a moment after announcing at the door at Jiutian Teahouse. He heard the latch of the old-fashioned wooden door in the teahouse moving.</p>

    <p>He pushed open the door and entered. Then he closed the door carefully.</p>

    <p>As soon as he entered the door, he saw a shirtless old man with gray hair pouring tea.</p>

    <p>His muscles are very strong. He looks quite exaggerated. He has a better figure than some young people.</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu suddenly laughed: "I feel relieved to see Mr. Teng is still in such good spirits."</p>

    <p>"There's no need to say any polite words."</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen narrowed his eyes and smiled. He pushed a cup of hot tea in front of Jing Heqiu and said, "Today you came to see me. You didn't come just because of a matter about the freshmen list, right? It's between you and me. There is no need to be a riddler. Whatever medicine is in the gourd, just pour it out."</p>

    <p>These words directly made Jing Heqiu laugh. He couldn't hold back the smile on his face: "Just a freshman list? If sir, you don't care about this freshman list, why did you ask me to set up Jiutian Jingmi Academy to identify talents among the younger generation? Why have you stayed in this Jiutian Teahouse for so many years? Isn't it because you want to be closer to these young students?"</p>

    <p>"Jiutian Jingmiyuan, the name given by the teacher back then, as the name suggests, means to find out all the elites including the nine heavens."</p>

    <p>"What is Jiutian? Jiutian symbolizes the vitality of the sky and the world, and is synonymous with young monks. Mr. has been looking for talents among young monks for so many years, and I believe he already has his own list, so he directly requested to hold this newborn list competition."</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu was not polite. He pierced the window paper in just a few words. He was very direct: "Moreover, this time I suddenly received an order from the top. They said that they were going to form the freshman list of provincial and municipal high school cultivation colleges. I felt... strangeness."</p>

    <p>"It stands to reason that regarding plans such as cultivation schools, no one can directly control the project without the permission of the Alliance of Ten Thousand Schools. Except for you, sir..."</p>

    <p>This statement may seem very rude, but in fact Teng Luchen doesn't mind it at all. What he hates most is playing riddles. He likes to talk about everything in front of his face.</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu knew Teng Luchen's temper very well, so speaking out like this really angered Teng Luchen.</p>

    <p>If it were other people who had not had close contact with Teng Luchen, they would definitely not dare to speak like that.</p>

    <p>This is a big shot that even ten generals would tremble in fear upon seeing him.</p>

    <p>Of course, Jing Heqiu feels that his knowledge of the gentleman in front of him is not very thorough. He is afraid that everything he knows is just superficial. Most of it is what he has learned by himself through dealing with Mr. Teng for many years. Premature speculation.</p>

    <p>"Haha. You are quite perceptive."</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen moved the muscles of his neck, folded his arms, and stared at Jing Heqiu: "What else do you know. You might as well continue talking. I will decide whether to continue communicating with you after listening."</p>

    <p>"I also know. Something about a big plan."</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu said calmly: "This big plan. Teng Lao has been planning it with that adult for hundreds of years. And this time, elites were selected from these young people. In the end, they served to deliver this big plan. Just Because of the danger, the talents found must be the best among talents. The best among the best... am I right? Mr. Teng?"</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen closed his eyes slightly and sighed: "The Earth Center Project. Was that the adult who told you about it?"</p>

    <p>Jing Heqiu was silent for a moment and then laughed: "What if? Otherwise, Mr. Teng thinks, how can I have access to such a confidential plan with my position?"</p>

    <p>"Since before the earth was upgraded, the resource competition and deployment in the inner earth world has already begun."</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen straightened his sitting posture and said: "The academies of cultivation science in various countries believe that the inner earth world has precious resources that the cultivation world does not have. But everyone wants to fight for this piece of cake. But to go for it. How can it be so easy?"</p>

    <p>"So Mr. Teng decided to set up this battle for resources as a competition and let young people compete as representatives. They thought they were participating in a competition. But in fact, they are fighting on behalf of various cultivating countries?"</p>

    <p>"That was not the original plan. I can only say that this was a helpless move."</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen shook his head. Suddenly he smiled bitterly: "Now, every country is preparing its own team of young people. And we, with the privilege, can bring an extra team of seven people in."</p>

    <p>"Why do you have such a privilege?"</p>

    <p>"The entrance to the inner world of the earth. Before the earth is upgraded, all countries are trying their best to open it. But getting through to the center of the earth is not easy."</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen straightened his posture and said, "But recently, that adult and I accidentally discovered that there is a natural entrance in our Songhai City..."</p>

    <p>"Natural entrance?"</p>

    <p>"Not rough."</p>

    <p>When Teng Luchen said this, he paused slightly and then said, "Do you still know about that natural wonder near the sea on the outskirts of Songhai City?"</p>

    <p>"Teng Lao is talking about the top of the sky, Palm Cliff? But according to legend, the handprint was made by a powerful person..."</p>

    <p>"But legends are just legends. No one has such palm power."</p>

    <p>When Teng Luchen said this, the two looked at each other. Jing Heqiu suddenly showed an expression of realization: "What Teng Lao means is... No way..."</p>

    <p>"Can't be wrong."</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen affirmed: "Although it is not yet possible to analyze what kind of natural phenomenon this is. But on the earth, the natural entrance to the inner earth world is also the first and only entrance. It is under the palm cliff."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Tuesday, January 14th, the day after the monthly exam. Although everyone knew that the results were out, the Academic Affairs Office had no intention of announcing it directly. This made Wang Ling very nervous.</p>

    <p>"Eh? I heard that the results will be released a few days later. The school has been dealing with people wearing white coats these two days."</p>

    <p>"White coat? Is it a doctor? What does a doctor do in school?"</p>

    <p>"Not necessarily a doctor. I think it might be someone from the Cultivation Research Institute."</p>

    <p>On the way to school, Wang Ling's ears twitched. He heard informed 60 High School friends discussing gossip. These are all senior students.</p>

    <p>Comparing the time after school for the second and third years, the average time for freshmen in their first year of high school is one to two hours at night.</p>

    <p>In other words, although Number 60 High School very carefully chose a time after school to receive the reception, he is afraid it was still seen by a small group of students who left late. Then the matter spread directly.</p>

    <p>But it's hard to say whether they are from the Cultivation Research Institute or not.</p>

    <p>Because if it is, he can definitely get some information from Wang Ming in advance.</p>

    <p>But now his bastard brother hasn't even sent a text message. There's no hint at all. It's not like Wang Ming's style at all.</p>

    <p>To put it bluntly, even people from the Xiuzhen Research Institute. Wang Ling feels that there is a high probability that they are not the same group as Wang Ming.</p>

    <p>Why do they visit the school at night?</p>

    <p>What exactly are they talking about?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is very curious about this.</p>
