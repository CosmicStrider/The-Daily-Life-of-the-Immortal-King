  <h1>Chapter 2112 Career Choice of Sun Rong</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: Everything is difficult at the beginning. This is true in real life. Of course, the game is no exception.</p>

    <p>A game developer from Sun Island. Miyazaki Ren, known as the father of the soul system by monks, is the creator of the same type of game that Bai Qiao is currently developing.</p>

    <p>Is Miyazaki kind or not? Sun Rong has never experienced it, but I know more or less.</p>

    <p>In the game circle, the meme of Miyazaki's mercy has almost become obsolete!</p>

    <p>So Bai Qiaoren is not kind. Sun Rong doesn't know. But he is somewhat mentally prepared.</p>

    <p>Top ten professions. Sun RongThe final choice is [Ancient Heavy Armored Monk].</p>

    <p>Because she knows that with the personality of Wang Ling, she will definitely choose [waste] to start. After all, this seems to be a relatively low-key profession.</p>

    <p>So why did she choose [Ancient Heavy Armored Monk]?</p>

    <p>There are three reasons.</p>

    <p>The first is that she doesn't want to be the same as Wang Ling. Moreover, in the career list, the career chosen by her and Wang Ling happen to be at the same end. This gives her an indescribable and inexplicable fantasy.</p>

    <p>And. Here are the top ten professions!</p>

    <p>Maybe it means that she can catch up with Wang Ling in ten months!</p>

    <p>The second reason. As mentioned in the job introduction, it is more friendly to novice players. The operation is also easier to use. The health and defense are very high! She feels that after encountering Wang Ling later, she can fight with Wang Ling. Wang Ling cooperates. Give Wang Ling a human shield!</p>

    <p>The last reason. In fact, when Sun Rong saw this profession, he immediately thought of the newly recognized grandma Sun Ru.</p>

    <p>In ancient times, her great-grandmother Sun Ru was also such an ancient heavy-armored monk! The armor she wore was so heroic and heroic. She really wanted to experience what it felt like to wear it on her body.</p>

    <p>The holographic game cabin has a spiritual transmission matching system. The texture, touch, weight and even temperature of all equipment are strictly controlled within this system.</p>

    <p>In other words, when wearing a thick set of ancient armor, even in the game, Sun Rong can clearly feel the heaviness from ancient times.</p>

    <p>After being on the inside, {Itinerant Immortal Magic Ring} has received unanimous praise from players. They think it is a cross-generational game work. Because everything in the game world is too real! Everything can be truly touched. The distance of the sound. The smell of different objects has a unique system.</p>

    <p>Even when you are injured by being cut, you will feel pain to a certain extent.</p>

    <p>Of course, this pain is bearable. After all, if it hurts too much, the player will be disconnected directly from the pain.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that when players suffer damage inside the game, they will get a tolerable tingling sensation similar to current feedback in the game holographic cabin in the real world. It also has a certain effect on promoting the self-purification ability of spiritual roots.</p>

    <p>In other words, playing games is just playing games. There is no need to worry about spiritual practice during the entire game.</p>

    <p>In addition, the holographic cabin is also equipped with a special nutritional potion. It will detect the body values of each monk in real time. If the monk needs to supplement nutrition during the game, he can choose the potion independently. The injection is automatically completed by the holographic cabin, thereby obtaining longer health. game experience time.</p>

    <p>Of course. If the monitoring equipment determines that the monk has played for too long and even the nutritional potions have been consumed, it will automatically archive and force the connection to be disconnected to allow the player to return to the real world to rest.</p>

    <p>Of course...</p>

    <p>All the above functions are only available to adult monks.</p>

    <p>For underage monks, the total gaming experience is only two hours.</p>

    <p>This wave of Wang Ling and Sun Rong is a game that has received special benefits. It is a game developed by Bai Qiao. Bai Qiao himself is the sheath spirit of Wang Ling. That's why Wang Ling He is the real boss behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Same as Wang Ling. After entering the game world. Sun Rong first checked his [inventory].</p>

    <p>In the character equipment area, she saw the ancient silver scale armor that looked very thick. This style is suitable for both men and women, but it is indeed an older style. It is okay without a helmet. If you even wear a helmet, there will be A clunky feeling.</p>

    <p>This also means that Sun Rong's own movement speed is not high. Although the blood volume reached 200 points at the beginning, and the defense power is also considerable, the mobility of the profession is really poor.</p>

    <p>The start of the ancient heavy armored monk profession. The start background that Sun Rong was randomly assigned to is as follows.</p>

    <p>Through conversations with NPCs, Sun Rong gradually learned about his current role and background.</p>

    <p>The role she plays is a guard guarding a remote town. But the ancient concept of male superiority and female inferiority in the "Itinerant Immortal Continent" has penetrated into the hearts of some monks with old ideas. It is deeply rooted.</p>

    <p>Monks with old ideas believe that women should stay at home, take care of their children, farm the land, and do housework. Going to the battlefield to win glory for the country is what men should do.</p>

    <p>But the game's "Sun Rong" doesn't think so. So she is always looking for opportunities to prove herself. She wants to prove it with her actual actions. There is no difference between men and women in bringing glory to the country.</p>

    <p>Women are not inferior to men. Even women can protect their home and country. They will give everything they have! Even their lives!</p>

    <p>She has an older brother. He is the foolish son of a landlord in the Imperial City. He is greedy for life, afraid of death, and greedy for money. During the time when the Imperial Capital was recruiting an expeditionary force, her brother retreated. In addition, her father was partial to his older brother.</p>

    <p>The two of them conspired to shave off her hair without hesitation, dress her up like a boy, and let her take part in the expedition in place of her brother.</p>

    <p>Now, it is her second year of joining the expeditionary force. She works diligently on duty beside the city wall of this remote town every day.</p>

    <p>In the past two years, she has used various methods to avoid the fact that she is a girl, because once people know that she is a woman, the most severe and inhumane punishment will be waiting for her...</p>

    <p>Originally, everything was fine. But just recently, she noticed a lot of suspicious eyes on her.</p>

    <p>[To reassure doubters]</p>

    <p>This was the first main quest that Sun Rong encountered after entering the game. To be honest, she didn't know where to start. Sun Rong didn't have much exposure to this type of game.</p>

    <p>If Chen Chao and Guo Hao were here at this time, these two people would definitely know what to do better.</p>

    <p>But Sun Rong also knows that all the choices he makes next will affect the development of the subsequent plot. www.uukanshu.net</p>

    <p>The only thing to do now is to make peace with Wang Ling as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>But...</p>

    <p>Where is classmate Wang Ling now?</p>

    <p>Sun Rong feels like my head hurts...</p>

    <p>At this time, a rough male voice came from the side: "Hey, who is that? The prison boss wants you to go there. There is a dishonest person in the prison. I hope you go and beat him up."</p>

    <p>The person talking to him was another heavily armored monk.</p>

    <p>"Why me?"</p>

    <p>"What? The cell leader asked you to go. Just go. He has a very good relationship with the general. Do you want to disobey?"</p>

    <p>The burly monk laughed: "They said you look like a girl. If you don't go, it will prove even more that you are a woman. Because only women can be soft-hearted."</p>
