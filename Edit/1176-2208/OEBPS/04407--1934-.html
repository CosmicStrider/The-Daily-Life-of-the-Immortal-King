  <h1>Chapter 1934 Teng Luchen's suspicion</h1>

  <div>

    <p>This group of criminals who suddenly broke into the Jiutian Jingmi Academy command post were quite capable. And they were obviously well prepared.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, as an employee of the Jingmi Academy Command Post, although such emergencies are rare, there are usually rehearsals. Although everything currently seems to be controlled by the bad guys, it is actually still within the scope of control.</p>

    <p>Everyone kept a calm mind and remained silent during the explanation. All the staff in the Jingmi Hospital squatted on the ground with their heads in their hands, keeping their breath while waiting for Mr. Teng's next command.</p>

    <p>The gangster is very powerful. However, it is impossible for Teng Lao to be in a state of strength without the ability to counterattack. This shrewd old man seemed to be waiting for something. He said nothing.</p>

    <p>At the same time, it fully cooperates with the gangster's command operations and increases the difficulty of the Number 1 trial field through the spiritual operating system of the Jingmi Academy Command Center.</p>

    <p>"It's already the highest difficulty level."</p>

    <p>After the adjustment, Teng Luchen said: "You also know. These are the best students from all over the world. The spirit beasts in the Number 1 trial site have an upper limit of difficulty. Maybe they can't be killed. Unless there is a way to schedule higher levels. The spirit beast of the trial ground comes to trial ground Number 1."</p>

    <p>"Then adjust!" the leader of the gangsters said from the bamboo hat. He pushed his gun against Teng Luchen's waist again: "I'm warning you, Teng Lao... don't play tricks!"</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen said expressionlessly: "It's not that I don't cooperate. It's just that the original system settings are like this. I can't adjust them directly. I will only operate according to the existing system. I will dispatch the spirit beasts from the advanced trial field." New program code is needed. However, with such a code, even if everyone here is gathered together, it will not be completed in a short time. Unless... there is external help."</p>

    <p>"Who are you looking for?"</p>

    <p>"His surname is Wang. He is President Qi's favorite student."</p>

    <p>Teng Luchen laughed: "Don't worry. He has no realm. He is not a cultivator. There is no need to worry that he will tell the truth. After all, he is an ordinary person with no cultivation. If you just rub him, he will die."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>The man in the bamboo hat was silent for a while, as if thinking.</p>

    <p>In the end, after a fierce ideological struggle, he finally agreed to Teng Luchen's request: "Then I will extend it to you for another half hour! One and a half hours. This is the deadline! Otherwise, all of you here will die! I will hand it over to you." The power of this golden wind. What kind of destructive power a close blow can cause. Mr. Fuji should be very clear."</p>

    <p>This is a clear threat.</p>

    <p>Of course Teng Luchen knew the power of the golden wind.</p>

    <p>Perhaps given his level, he wouldn't be seriously injured by a bullet.</p>

    <p>But once the bullet hit his body, the psychic energy generated by the backlash explosion was enough to level the entire command post and everything nearby within a thousand kilometers.</p>

    <p>The spiritual operating system of Jiutian Jingmi Academy is a top secret.</p>

    <p>As for the purpose of this gang of criminals, Teng Luchen actually had a clear mind.</p>

    <p>In fact, no matter whether they can fulfill their requirements in the end, this bullet will be fired...</p>

    <p>Their original purpose was to go after one of these high school students.</p>

    <p>Maybe it's Qu Shuling, maybe it's Zhang Linyan, Li Changzhe, or maybe it's a cultivator from other cultivating countries.</p>

    <p>The reason why they want to kill all the high school students who are entering now is just a way to hide from others. In fact, it is to cover up their real killing target.</p>

    <p>Anyway, when it happens, these high school students will all die. Even if the news breaks out in the end, public opinion will not pay attention to the specific action against a certain high school student. It will only define it as an outrageous large-scale terrorist act.</p>

    <p>So Teng Luchen knew it well.</p>

    <p>He made quite a few guesses about the actions of these gangsters in his mind.</p>

    <p>However, he did not directly stop this group of people. On the contrary, he even followed the wishes of this group of people and began to increase the difficulty of the map in the Number 1 Proving Ground.</p>

    <p>No one noticed.</p>

    <p>At this time, among the more than a thousand monitors connected to the oasis, the few monitors staring at Wang Ling were the ones that Teng Luchen paid special attention to...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The countdown was less than 20 hours away from clearing the Number 1 trial ground. Wang Ling sat with him under the tree for more than half an hour. Qu Shuling was lying on the left, and Li Changzhe was lying on the right... This The nation's number one college genius and the nation's second genius. One on the left and the other on the right, like goalkeepers, fell next to him. Wang Ling felt extremely complicated for a moment.</p>

    <p>In the past half hour, in addition to giving Zhang Linyan secret guidance, he also counted the leaves in the oasis one by one.</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ling had already noticed it when he first entered the oasis. He knew that these leaves were equipped with micro pinhole monitoring equipment.</p>

    <p>It's just that he kept pretending that nothing happened. It made people feel as if he didn't notice it at all.</p>

    <p>While sitting on the ground, Wang Ling had been using his peripheral vision to look for the cameras monitoring him. Although there were not many of them, Wang Ling was convinced that the people in front of these cameras had actually been paying attention to his movements.</p>

    <p>In other words, Wang Ling's sixth sense told him that he might have been targeted. And the person targeting him should be of a high level.</p>

    <p>He sighed endlessly in his heart. He only blamed himself for being so worthless. He actually left the house just because of a few packets of crispy noodles... Why couldn't he control his paws?</p>

    <p>But there is no way now. He has come here. He can only pretend to cooperate and complete the task. Anyway, there are a lot of people here. There are always available characters who can be used to temporarily take the blame.</p>

    <p>Without Zhuo Yi, he can only develop new people.</p>

    <p>Then he discovered that Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan were actually very good.</p>

    <p>One is more naive. Although the other is smarter than Li Changzhe, he is a very sensible person.</p>

    <p>He hinted several times. Zhang Linyan actually received some signals. However, Wang Ling's looks were too natural. She had no direct evidence to prove that Wang Ling was hinting to her.</p>

    <p>Just like the protagonist in many famous suspense works, there are always a few supporting characters around him who inadvertently hint at the modus operandi.</p>

    <p>So considering Wang Ling's original plan, he would use Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan to cover himself.</p>

    <p>But the problem is. Li Changzhe still hasn't woken up...</p>

    <p>The bump on his head has obviously gone away. This was when he was carrying Li Changzhe on his back and he was cured when no one was paying attention. Logically speaking, Li Changzhe should have woken up long ago.</p>

    <p>But there is a saying. You can never wake up someone who is pretending to be asleep...</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe is still awake now. Wang Ling thinks there may be only one reason.</p>

    <p>That means he doesn't want to wake up.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In fact. Li Changzhe woke up when he was lying on Wang Ling's back.</p>

    <p>But when he thought that he had knocked headlong into the teahouse door and passed out, the dignity on his face suddenly disappeared.</p>

    <p>The most important thing is that he has always been hostile to Wang Ling. As a result, Wang Ling came in on his back during the time he passed out...</p>

    <p>This kind of elegant and noble sentiment made Li Changzhe feel guilty for a while.</p>

    <p>He thought it would be better for him to lie down... It would be so embarrassing if he woke up!</p>
