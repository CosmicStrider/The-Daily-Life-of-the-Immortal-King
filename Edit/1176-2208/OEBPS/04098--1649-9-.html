  <h1>Chapter 1649 9th Palace Liangzi's Anger and Jealousy</h1>

  <div>

    <p>It was not a loud sound, but it attracted the attention of people around. There were less than five hours left. The thugs contracted by Director Ducas were all dead. There was almost no one with spare money in the entire ten rings. Fund the next fight.</p>

    <p>Zhu Yuanrun was actually right. He is also a well-known figure in the elite circle in the core area. And he actually has some shares in this underground boxing ring.</p>

    <p>What Zhu Yuanrun didn't expect was that someone would bet on Hu Baoguo after hearing his analysis?</p>

    <p>In his opinion, this was simply impossible.</p>

    <p>"Young man, you are quite powerful. This move is one million silver gear coins. I'm afraid this is the continuation of your life, right?" Zhu Yuanrun laughed. Although he was a little annoyed that some people did not listen to his analysis at this time. Forcibly Things that run counter to what he said.</p>

    <p>But in fact, Qin Zhong bet on Hu Baoguo to lose. In fact, it was good for him.</p>

    <p>Because he is the one who wins.</p>

    <p>What you earn is this stable business.</p>

    <p>After he was convinced that no one could challenge Hu Baoguo, he immediately increased the odds. He raised the odds to the current 1 because the financial odds were huge. Even 172 times, it was enough for him to make a lot of money.</p>

    <p>Qin Zhong's bet only gave him another 1 million yuan.</p>

    <p>He smiled coldly in his heart.</p>

    <p>A charity sale like this that gives away money for free. He couldn't find it even with a lantern.</p>

    <p>As a result, the words just fell out.</p>

    <p>A deafening sound of gongs sounded in the VIP area.</p>

    <p>"Someone beat the drum of war!"</p>

    <p>On the screen in the hall, a thin figure wearing a jet black cloak and a mask was accompanied by two other cloaked people who also wore masks. He was smiling from ear to ear. Ducas caught everyone's attention.</p>

    <p>"Ducas? Why is it him again... Didn't his contracted thug just..." Zhu Yuanrun and the surrounding dignitaries opened their mouths at the same time. Looking at this scene, they just felt a little unbelievable.</p>

    <p>Hu Baoguo is one. Rumor has it that his strength is unfathomable. Although the entry list states that he is the peak of the late Golden Core, in fact this realm is just "fishing."</p>

    <p>It makes people mistakenly think that Hu Baoguo is weak. This lowers the overall level of those contracted thugs. After all, the signing fee of each thug is based on his level.</p>

    <p>For example, the Golden Core thug that Ducas hired earlier was hired based on the data on paper.</p>

    <p>This was Zhu Yuanrun's secret operation.</p>

    <p>But he didn't expect that this person didn't even get through the fourth level.</p>

    <p>In fact, Hu Baoguo's strength lies in Soul Formation!</p>

    <p>A Soul Formation can appear in the slums. Such a state is scary enough.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, the guy Ducas found was so thin that he looked ridiculous...</p>

    <p>In Zhu Yuanrun's opinion, it would be difficult to survive even the first three levels.</p>

    <p>"This Ducas...is there something wrong with his brain? Why did he find such a short man to compete?" When Zhu Yuanrun said these words, Ducas entered with Sun Rong, Jiugong, and Jin Deng. to the venue.</p>

    <p>As soon as he entered the venue, Jiugong Liangzi heard the voice of Zhu Yuanrun speaking nonsense.</p>

    <p>Under the cloak, her body was trembling slightly.</p>

    <p>This damn fat guy... actually said that she... that she was...</p>

    <p>"Calm down. Liangzi... don't expose yourself. And this Ducas has indeed marked you as a boy in his fake identity. It's all for cover-up! Cover-up!" Sun Rong reminded her using the "team voice."</p>

    <p>"..." Jiugong Liangzi took a deep breath.</p>

    <p>I kept repeating words like "The world is so beautiful, but I am so irritable..."...</p>

    <p>They are blessed with Jin Deng's consecration technique, which perfectly conceals their own aura. This ensures that Zhuo Yi and others will not find out.</p>

    <p>Sharing King's Eyes. It is indeed very powerful. But this power is completely different from the real King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>As long as the "opening technique" is strong enough, it will be impossible to penetrate the pupil power of the King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>So, what is being applied to them now is Jin Deng's 40th version of the consecration technique...</p>

    <p>Although the effect is temporary, it greatly increases Jiugong Liangzi's combat power.</p>

    <p>When entering the hall, Sun Rong was worried about whether Zhuo Yi would see it. After a brief exchange of eyes, Zhuo Yi quickly moved away from them and turned elsewhere.</p>

    <p>This made Sun Rong breathe a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>"What a risk..."</p>

    <p>"Look Rongrong. That person...that person has been looking at Zhuo Yi! He never stopped!" Jiugong Liangzi was furious with jealousy in his heart.</p>

    <p>In addition, Zhu Yuanrun just said that she was a boy. This made the anger in her chest reach the critical point.</p>

    <p>The admission procedures for the Martial Arts Competition were fully handled by Ducas. In just ten minutes, Jiugong Liangzi got the pass.</p>

    <p>And when her name appeared on the big screen, everyone's eyes jumped.</p>

    <p>"Gong?"</p>

    <p>Who is this person?</p>

    <p>A Golden Core thug. And a thug that no one has ever heard of.</p>

    <p>"Ducas. You are pushing this kid into the fire pit. You see he is so thin and small. He is not fully developed, right? You called a girl with half-haired hair over. What are you doing?" Zhu Yuanrun's face showed a joke. look.</p>

    <p>"Pushing into the fire pit? What do you know..." Ducas ignored what Zhu Yuanrun said at all. He had already seen how powerful Jiugong Liangzi was. Naturally, he didn't care what others thought.</p>

    <p>Although Jiugong Liangzi's asking price is indeed higher than that of the previously deceased male thug, his ultimate goal is to get a pass.</p>

    <p>As long as you can get the pass. It's all worth it!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Miya, are you ready? Let's show them real magic!" Ducas crossed his arms and smiled confidently.</p>

    <p>Magic?</p>

    <p>In a sense, this is indeed magic.</p>

    <p>After completing the formalities, there were only about 4 hours left. Then Zhu Yuanrun and others made sarcastic remarks. On the surface, it was ridicule, but in fact, it was just to delay time.</p>

    <p>To challenge six people continuously within these four hours. In the eyes of others, this is simply unrealistic.</p>

    <p>But when Jiugong Liangzi stepped onto the ring in front of everyone's eyes.</p>

    <p>Zhu Yuanrun still noticed something was wrong.</p>

    <p>"What's wrong, Mr. Zhu?" A waiter under Zhu Yuanrun came over and asked. When he saw Zhu Yuanrun raising his hand, he knew that the boss had something to ask him to arrange.</p>

    <p>"Go and call the five strongest people we specially prepared for the Martial Arts Competition. They will be the masters of the five stages of this Martial Arts Competition."</p>

    <p>"Is this... necessary..."</p>

    <p>"I think something is wrong." Zhu Yuanrun frowned.</p>

    <p>Ducas. He knows best.</p>

    <p>Under normal circumstances, he would not do useless work... Of course, the main reason was the confidence on the other person's face that scared Zhu Yuanrun.</p>

    <p>After about a few minutes.</p>

    <p>The first Guanzhu Jiugong Liangzi faced had already arrived in front of her.</p>

    <p>This is a man with eight mechanical legs. He is nicknamed Urgot!</p>

    <p>"Is the first person a crab?" Zhu Yuanrun sneered.</p>

    <p>"This man looks extremely bulky. But he is extremely fast and agile! And most importantly, his two iron fist gloves... these are the work of that adult..."</p>

    <p>"That lord?"</p>

    <p>"Yes... although that Lord is only a disciple. But even if he is a disciple, this iron gauntlet is enough to kill... This is a fist that transcends the fear of death!"</p>

    <p>"That's it! It sounds very strong! And look at Mr. Zhu. The man opposite is not wearing gloves."</p>

    <p>"Ha. With bare hands? This is seeking death!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Beyond the Fist of Death Fear...?</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi was stunned for a moment. Then he clenched his fists tightly.</p>

    <p>She really wasn't wearing anything. Just two delicate fists.</p>

    <p>But after the 40th version of the Enlightenment. She is now fearless...</p>

    <p>"That damn fat pig. He actually said... that I am a man..." Thinking of what Zhu Yuanrun said just now, Jiugong Liangzi's anger increased to full level again. Faced with the "crab" with a huge size difference in front of him.</p>

    <p>He went up and waved his arms.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>No one could see clearly the punch Jiugong Liangzi made. They could only feel a dazzling golden light flashing in front of their eyes.</p>

    <p>A loud explosion of air exploded between the two of them!</p>

    <p>After the light dissipates.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi retracted the smoking fist that pierced the crab's lower body: "Next!"</p>

    <p>She roared in a disguised voice.</p>

    <p>Although this voice has been modified, Zhuo Yi still couldn't help but feel a tremor...</p>

    <p>And he didn't know why. From the beginning, he felt that this man's fist seemed a bit... familiar?</p>
