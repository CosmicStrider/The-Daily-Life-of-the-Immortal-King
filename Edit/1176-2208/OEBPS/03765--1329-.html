  <h1>Chapter 1329 Shadow's Trap</h1>

  <div>

    <p>On the other side. Room 331 of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Lord used {primer} to move the medical cabin here.</p>

    <p>And currently lying in the main hall of the Office of Strategic DeceptionTrue Venerated Immortal is another fake body of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>There are two people, Zhenyuan Immortal and Ajuan girl, guarding the temple here.</p>

    <p>This is a temporary "matryoshka-style blindfold" for the safety of the real body.</p>

    <p>Although it may not necessarily work, it is at least a layer of protection.</p>

    <p>"How many bodies did Boss Luo create for Sun Rong's junior classmate..." Zhuo Yi was stunned.</p>

    <p>Finally, she came into close contact with Crispy Noodles Dao Lord. The girl looked at this face that looked very similar to Wang Ling. She seemed hesitant to speak.</p>

    <p>"Crispy Noodles Dao Lord is a very amiable person. If you want to ask me anything, you don't have to be polite." Zhuo Yi smiled and encouraged.</p>

    <p>"That..."</p>

    <p>Then Sun Rong finally spoke. She looked at the young man in front of her and asked politely: "Senior, have we met somewhere?"</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Lord thought for a while and replied truthfully: "Jiulong Mountain. Physical Arts Competition."</p>

    <p>"Physical skills competition..." Sun Rong thought carefully. Suddenly, a scene came to mind that was completely different from Wang Ling's usual style of behavior: "Senior, are you writing an essay? Sometimes. I replaced my classmate Wang Ling..."</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Lord was slightly surprised by the girl's extremely fast thinking and reaction ability.</p>

    <p>But since it has been exposed, there is no need to hide it: "Yes. I did replace Little Master Ling when he was writing the article. At that time, he was fighting with his own shadow in the universe."</p>

    <p>"I'm just telling you! Classmate Wang Ling's essay. How come it suddenly got such a high score."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong laughed happily: "It turns out that seniors are just a speck of ashes in this era!"</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Lord scratched his head and felt a little embarrassed: "Miss Sun was joking. I was just performing normally. I didn't expect it to be like this. This matter has caused a lot of trouble to the owner. It's really a technical job."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong nodded. I couldn't agree more: "I can't learn it either... It's easy to get a hundred percent score. It's really difficult to get an average score."</p>

    <p>"How do you deduce that the master was subcontracted when he was writing the essay?"</p>

    <p>At this time, Crispy Noodles Dao Lord asked curiously.</p>

    <p>"It's very simple. First of all, the words are different."</p>

    <p>The girl answered easily: "In the competition, the senior wrote the composition on behalf of classmate Wang Ling. Although the handwriting is also very beautiful, it is obviously not the handwriting of classmate Wang Ling. The handwriting of classmate Wang Ling is thin Gold body. As for the calligraphy of the senior..."</p>

    <p>"I am a fat golden body."</p>

    <p>"Yes, yes! It just feels a little thicker than usual."</p>

    <p>"My font is just a little thicker than the master's."</p>

    <p>"???"</p>

    <p>"Then let me ask Miss Sun. Are there any other differences?"</p>

    <p>"Of course there is." Sun Rong nodded: "Everyone was communicating with each other when writing essays in a group. I feel like the seniors talked a lot that day..."</p>

    <p>"But I only said three sentences in total."</p>

    <p>"Compared to classmate Wang Ling who usually doesn't say a word. This is an obvious abnormality."</p>

    <p>"Hey." Crispy Noodles Dao Lord sighed. Unexpectedly, he tried his best to imitate Wang Ling, but still showed flaws.</p>

    <p>"But I think this is good. Seniors don't have to deliberately imitate classmate Wang Ling."</p>

    <p>At this time, Sun Rong said with a smile: "I am now communicating with my seniors. It feels like I am talking to one of the personalities of my classmate Wang Ling."</p>

    <p>"As long as Miss Sun is happy." Crispy Noodles Dao Lord smiled.</p>

    <p>There is an obvious difference from Wang Ling. This makes Sun Rong find it very interesting.</p>

    <p>What did she look like when she laughed in the illusion Wang Ling countless times.</p>

    <p>"Senior. Can you laugh again?"</p>

    <p>At this time. Sun Rong took out his hand-drawing tools.</p>

    <p>She wanted to find the smile of Wang Ling in Crispy Noodles Dao Lord.</p>

    <p>"no problem."</p>

    <p>Crispy Noodles Dao Lord is very cooperative and smiles naturally.</p>

    <p>The eyebrows are curved.</p>

    <p>White teeth....</p>

    <p>On the other side. Wang Ying ran out of the Wang family's small villa.</p>

    <p>He tracked it all the way to the western depths of the extraterrestrial galaxy. He just stopped.</p>

    <p>He began to realize that something was wrong.</p>

    <p>If Miss Sun Ying is heading for the Unspeakable Land, the coordinates of the Unspeakable Land are east of the Milky Way outside the territory.</p>

    <p>And here. Completely two directions.</p>

    <p>"Have you finally discovered it? But... it's too late." A cold voice sounded in the space.</p>

    <p>The countless black shadows around turned into a hair-like substance that continued to float in the air. Finally, it condensed into the figure of the girl.</p>

    <p>The Sun Ying in front of me has exactly the same appearance as Sun Rong. But like Wang Ying, he also has White Hair.</p>

    <p>The long white hair is even longer than the body. It is like ice silk hanging upside down.</p>

    <p>"The perfect body of void." Wang Ying frowned slightly.</p>

    <p>The aura on Sun Ying's body made him feel something bad.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, everything was as they initially guessed.</p>

    <p>The body of classmate Sun Rong was temporarily stagnant due to the separation of body and soul.</p>

    <p>But her shadow became completely empty.</p>

    <p>Moreover, Wang Ying could detect that the energy in Miss Sun Ying's body was astonishing. It was far beyond the reach of ordinary virtual spirits.</p>

    <p>If we really have to fight, this might be a difficult opponent?</p>

    <p>"Sun Ying?" Wang Ying looked at the girl in front of him.</p>

    <p>"Don't call me Sun Ying. My name is Sun Ying'er. It's okay if you call me Ying'er."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er said: "I have been her shadow for too long. I have long wanted to get rid of her."</p>

    <p>"Do you want to imitate me when I took my body?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ying is also a shadow. Wang Ying can roughly understand Sun Ying'er's thoughts: "I tell you, this is impossible. You have to fight back. Seizing the body is the key. But in the Office of Strategic Deception. Sun Rong There are too many people protecting the girl now. And you will be dragged here by me. Or even defeated by me."</p>

    <p>"If you want to defeat me, I'm afraid it won't be that easy."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er smiled: "You probably don't know my photography ability yet, right?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ying frowned.</p>

    <p>"My shadow ability is the mother of splitting. I can split myself into many. And all split bodies have the same huge energy as me."</p>

    <p>"This is impossible!"</p>

    <p>"Theoretically speaking, this is indeed impossible. Because the energy contained in the split body is far from reaching the level of the original body. But don't forget. I am the son of the void. The energy of the void is obtained from Inexhaustible."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er smiled and said: "Having the power of void at the same time. This makes my photography ability even more amazing."</p>

    <p>"You mean..." At this point, Wang Ying finally realized what the problem was!</p>

    <p>"That's right. What you have been tracking is just my split body."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er looked at Wang Ying and showed an expression of complete control: "And my mother body is still hidden on the earth."</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>At the same time, a girl with white hair exuding a dangerous aura appeared at the entrance to the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>She opened her palms. A pure white snow lotus mixed with the power of the void appeared and rotated slightly in her palms.</p>

    <p>"Rongrong. Come back to the void with me." Sun Ying'er smiled and threw the snow lotus away.</p>

    <p>In the void, the swirling snow lotus contained amazing energy. Then it exploded. In an instant, it lit up the entire night sky...</p>
