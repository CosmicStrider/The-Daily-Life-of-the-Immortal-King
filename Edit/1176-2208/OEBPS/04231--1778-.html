  <h1>Chapter 1778 The Shield of the Liver Emperor</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The red lotus is shocking to the world. Who is responsible for the tremors!</p>

    <p>Sun Rong slashed through the core world with one swing. Infinite flames appeared around her body, with a kind of blazing light and heat. It was dazzling and full of intimidation.</p>

    <p>Haiyao Jushi's color changed on the spot. He would never have thought that this was the "void sword energy" displayed by Aohai combined with the passive ability of "human sword unity." It was constructed with illusion, but it gave people an extremely real feeling.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the Void Sword Qi is also called the real and illusory sword.</p>

    <p>Unable to see through this, Haiyao Jushi further confirmed in his mind that Sun Rong was the legendary Blood Lotus Female Butcher. The Blood Lotus Female Butcher originally majored in fire magic. She was also a Sword master with the fire spirit root.</p>

    <p>Among all the ancients, apart from the Blood Lotus Female Butcher, which other female Sword master can reach such a level...</p>

    <p>For a moment, Haiyao Jushi was frightened and thought of many things. He thought that the Blood Lotus Female Butcher was not his opponent back then. But now she not only joined the Office of Strategic Deception, but also changed her identity as "Wang Piaoliang." The identity of an ordinary earthly cultivator has successfully established itself on the earth.</p>

    <p>Such a powerful person is in the Office of Strategic Deception. How can people in the Office of Strategic Deception not feel her presence?</p>

    <p>Haiyao Jushi kept thinking in his mind.</p>

    <p>He thought about it over and over. Suddenly he came up with an extremely terrifying answer.</p>

    <p>That is the possibility that the Office of Strategic Deception... is not composed of regular earth cultivators at all! Maybe the core members inside are all Eternals!</p>

    <p>As for Lord Diulei, the famous "death-seeking senior" on earth, he just used this identity as a cover. As the leader of the sect, he has the identity of the Eternal One. Haiyao Jushi believes that he has been completely confirmed.</p>

    <p>The Eternal Ones have always been arrogant. How could they agree to accept someone weaker than them as the head of the sect and bend down to do things under their hands?</p>

    <p>This Blood Lotus female butcher is so powerful. In the Office of Strategic Deception, she is just an elder named "Wang Piaoliang."</p>

    <p>So...</p>

    <p>The remaining core members of the Office of Strategic Deception. Who among the Eternals are there?</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, the cold sweat on Haiyao Jushi's cheeks continued to flow down.</p>

    <p>He thought about this frightening possibility. In an instant, he felt like everything was explained.</p>

    <p>No wonder the Office of Strategic Deception has become the only super sect surpassing all heaven-level sects on earth in a short period of time...</p>

    <p>No wonder the Office of Strategic Deception can take the lead in handover with the Heavenly Dao planet, communicate with those extraterrestrial visitors, and establish normal diplomatic relations.</p>

    <p>It turns out that the root cause...</p>

    <p>Among the core members behind the Office of Strategic Deception. It is likely that a group of Eternals are operating!</p>

    <p>"During the battle. Are you still thinking about other things?" Sun Rong's voice was cold. She stared at the disintegrated core world. And Haiyao Jushi who vomited blood due to the collapse of the core world.</p>

    <p>She was not slow. She was confirming the current injuries of Haiyao Jushi to ensure that the force of her next blow would not kill him in one blow.</p>

    <p>It is necessary to keep people alive.</p>

    <p>Because Sun Rong feels that Haiyao Jushi must know a lot of things. Maybe there is a more powerful person behind Haiyao Jushi.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>The red lotus sword energy swept across, pierced the void, and illuminated the sky. Haiyao Jushi stared at his pale face and pulled out a glazed metal shield from his body. This sword energy directly hit the metal shield, and a dazzling beam of light erupted.</p>

    <p>Cracks appeared instantly on it.</p>

    <p>This was transformed by the liver of Haiyao Jushi. As a liver emperor among the cultivators back then, he stayed up late to cultivate and temper his liver. The liver was sacrificed to become the indestructible metal shield it is today.</p>

    <p>Over the past ten thousand years, he doesn't know how many fatal attacks he has withstood without any damage. He didn't expect that the battle with this "Blood Lotus female butcher" would actually give him a split liver!</p>

    <p>Puff!</p>

    <p>Haiyao Jushi vomited a large mouthful of blood. Both hands holding up the shield were convulsing. The sting was extremely painful. Sun Rong's sword energy was too strong. It was transmitted through the penetration of the shield. Even if it was blocked by the Shield of the Liver Emperor Most of it. However, the remaining power is enough for Haiyao Jushi to have a drink.</p>

    <p>If it weren't for the Liver Emperor's Shield, Haiyao Jushi felt that the blow just now was enough to kill him. He would have been chopped to pieces by the sword energy!</p>

    <p>The next second.</p>

    <p>He retreated. He retreated at a high speed. He fled the scene decisively. The core world was shattered on the spot. Like a broken mirror.</p>

    <p>The purple water all turned back to its original blue. Commander Li Weiwei's garrison troops and the Tengu army reappeared. Haiyao Jushi abandoned his armor and turned into a fish and swam through the seabed. When Sun Rong reacted. The breath is already far away.</p>

    <p>"Captain Li. I am Wang Piaoliang from the Office of Strategic Deception. I am here to help you." After leaving the core world, Sun Rong immediately identified herself with Li Weiwei.</p>

    <p>She didn't say much. She immediately controlled the sea water to immobilize all the tengu in front of her with water. She turned into a stream of light and jumped into the seabed to chase Haiyao Jushi.</p>

    <p>This time, Master Haiyao Jushi was really frightened.</p>

    <p>He had obviously slipped out far away. He never expected that a female butcher named Blood Lotus, who majored in fire magic, could move better than him underwater...</p>

    <p>Are you so unconventional these days?</p>

    <p>"You are a fire practitioner. Why can you swim faster than me?" When the figure of Sun Rong gradually approached him, Haiyao Jushi's face turned white with fear. At the same time, his heart was trembling.</p>

    <p>Blood Lotus female butcher was too powerful... far beyond what he thought.</p>

    <p>What kind of resources did the group of Eternals in the Office of Strategic Deception consume? Can they reach such a point?</p>

    <p>He felt incredible and swung the fish's tail wildly with all his strength. Sun Rong was chasing after him. For a while, two long water lines were dragged up on the sea surface, one in front and one behind, like two water dragons.</p>

    <p>This woman is so terrible.</p>

    <p>Haiyao Jushi couldn't believe it at all.</p>

    <p>She was clearly a person who was firmly suppressed by him back then. Not only did she come from behind and break his core world with a sword, but she also chased him and beat him hard, leaving him in such a mess.</p>

    <p>He gritted his teeth and secretly swore that revenge would be necessary in this battle, and he would redouble his efforts to repay the "Blood Lotus Female Butcher" and the people from the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>And the premise is that he must escape this disaster and bring the information back alive. He must not let himself be caught.</p>

    <p>What made Sun Rong surprised was that under her fierce pursuit, Haiyao Jushi finally gave up the resistance and stopped taking a step forward.</p>

    <p>She saw the other party cut open his stomach, took out his heart and held it in his hand: "I will never let you catch me! I am more ruthless than you. You, a girl, are a too tender."</p>

    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Haiyao Jushi immediately squeezed his hand and burst his heart like a balloon right in front of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>"Dead...dead..."</p>

    <p>Looking at the seawater stained with blood, Sun Rong was stunned. She wanted to catch him alive, but she didn't expect to force Haiyao Jushi to death. For a moment, she blamed herself.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side, after seeing the heroic scene of Haiyao Jushi committing suicide, Wang Ling also withdrew his gaze.</p>

    <p>Glio City Fenlei looked confused: "Die just like that? Impossible, right?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ying's voice came from the side. He manifested his body, leaning against the wall with his arms folded. He sneered: "An eternal man dying. How can it be so easy?"</p>

    <p>Glio City Fenlei: "That's right...most of these powerful people have the means to resurrect."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying: "It's not a means. It's just a privilege left by Dao Ancestor Wang. Have you forgotten the Abandoned Land and the Cat in the Abandoned Land?"</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Glio City Fenlei suddenly understood. He instantly understood what Wang Ying meant: "I understand! Master of Shadows means. The other party deliberately committed suicide. In fact, he wanted to enter the land abandoned by the gods. Get rid of tracking? "</p>

    <p>"Yes. It is a privileged place for Dao God and above. You can consume your own cultivation. You can choose a place to be reborn. It can be regarded as a method of self-preservation like a gecko cutting off its tail."</p>

    <p>After Wang Ying finished speaking, he couldn't help but curl his lips: "It's just that he probably didn't expect that the bronze cat in the God's Forsaken Land is also from our side."</p>

    <p>"Hahaha. Isn't that just throwing yourself into a trap?" Glio City Fenlei laughed.</p>

    <p>"So I just went to the Land Abandoned by the Gods to say hello to the bronze cat." Wang Ying: "I want it to resurrect this Haiyao Jushi according to the rules and see where he will choose to be reborn."</p>

    <p>Glio City Fenlei: "Is this fishing?"</p>

    <p>Wang Ying nodded: "Of course I'm fishing. And... this is what the Lord meant."</p>
