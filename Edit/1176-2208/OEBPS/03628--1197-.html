  <h1>Chapter 1197 Backlash is the main one</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ying's power is astonishing. At least it is far more terrifying than Wang Ling imagined. He broke away from the star core by himself. He fought his way out while being surrounded by such dense meteorites. Ask for himself. Got "a glimmer of hope."</p>

    <p>This method of breaking free by relying solely on physical strength cannot be described or evaluated in any words, because it does not have any technical content at all.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling did not take any action. Instead, it was waiting for the other party's next move.</p>

    <p>The scene seems to be in a stalemate. If there are people watching here, they will definitely have huge doubts about the outcome of the battle. This kind of doubt is like why Kuxuan is short. It is thought-provoking!</p>

    <p>On the other side, Wang Ying broke free with pure physical strength. Several layers of faint black light lingered all over his body. This is the aura of the holy body that sanctifies the flesh. Wang Ling's aura is pure white. It is completely opposite to Wang Ying.</p>

    <p>When the halo of the Holy Body was surrounding Wang Ying like a star ring, the meteorites within a hundred feet of Wang Ying were actually attracted by the power of the Holy Body halo. Then they split little by little, and finally completely shattered.</p>

    <p>This is the circle of innocence brought about by the aura of the Eucharist.</p>

    <p>It can automatically clean up all approaching flying objects within a hundred feet range. Hidden weapons, spells. Wait a minute!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling usually maintains a suppressed state. He does not allow his Holy Body aura to be revealed. Because if his aura is not controlled, the consequences will not only be to clear up flying objects, but also to destroy the nearby space. All living creatures within are wiped out together.</p>

    <p>Even Wang Ying now. His halo is reserved. The degree of openness is less than 10%.</p>

    <p>Because he also has to take care of the dense and colorful pillars underneath.</p>

    <p>Once it reaches the point of 100% complete liberation, a large piece of the Senluowanxiang Pillar underneath and the surface of the sun will be chewed off immediately and disappear directly from the space.</p>

    <p>All I can say is that it is indeed my own shadow.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked at this scene. There was a bit of surprise in his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>It's been a long time since he met such a tough person.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying almost copied all of his Heavenly Dao abilities.</p>

    <p>However, judging from Wang Ying's action just now. Wang Ling actually also saw some drawbacks.</p>

    <p>Almost all the spells he created previously were based on Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>Assume that Wang Ying separated from himself a long time ago. Then Wang Ying may not be able to master 100% of the new abilities he gained after the separation.</p>

    <p>Although he was careful to leave a small part of his shadow on Wang Ling to prevent Wang Ling from noticing the lack of shadow. However, the learning ability of this small part of the shadow is limited.</p>

    <p>So. Thinking based on this scenario, Wang Ling felt that the opportunity for a decisive victory had arrived.</p>

    <p>As long as you use the power of Heavenly Dao, you may be able to expose Wang Ying's flaws.</p>

    <p>However, at this moment, Wang Ying had a sly smile on his face. There was a long series of black shadows condensing in his open hands. Finally, they gradually condensed into a solid body. First, the dark hilt was revealed, and then a little bit more concrete. Jian Shen came out of condensation.</p>

    <p>This sword is completely black. But even though the colors are different, Wang Ling can still tell it apart at a glance. This is Jingke's shadow...</p>

    <p>Wang Ying not only escaped from him, but also stole Jingke's shadow with him!</p>

    <p>What a beast...</p>

    <p>But at this moment, staring at the rampant Wang Ying in front of him, Wang Ling felt a little secretly happy in his heart.</p>

    <p>He thought to himself that the other party was lucky not to attack the shadow of Gan Jian Mian.</p>

    <p>If even the shadow of dry noodles is stolen, then dry noodles are no longer complete dry noodles.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling. I know what you are thinking. I know you are thinking of using Heavenly Dao to deal with me... But it is a pity that your wish may come true. I do not fully grasp the power of Heavenly Dao. But you must always remember. I am your shadow."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying's voice sounded: "Shadow exists for imitation. If you dare to use Heavenly Dao, I can learn it in an instant. By then, I will become stronger..."</p>

    <p>Having said that, Wang Ying pointed the black Jingke directly at Wang Ling: "I said it.</p>

    <p>I want you to become my shadow!" The shadow bites back.</p>

    <p>This is by no means just what Wang Ying said.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling can feel that Wang Ying is serious.</p>

    <p>In fact, for Wang Ying, this is also a gamble.</p>

    <p>He spent such a huge price to set up the cosmic formation, trying to absorb the power of all living things in the entire solar system. In order to be able to draw enough power to fight against Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>That's right.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Wang Ying's ultimate goal is to counterattack. He wants Wang Ling to swallow him up and turn him into his own shadow.</p>

    <p>But now, there is still a crucial step to complete this plan. It is to wait until Senluo Wanxiang Pillar absorbs enough power of the Sun Spirit.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying once imagined what kind of attitude and expression he would show if he saw Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>As it turned out, Wang Ying found this more exciting than she imagined.</p>

    <p>He couldn't even wait for the moment when the Senluo Wanxiang Pillar absorbed enough energy. His whole person was already boiling!</p>

    <p>According to his original plan, if he cooperates with the universe to form a magic circle, his success rate of devouring Wang Ling will reach 99.99%!</p>

    <p>Although the current success rate is not that high, it is still 80%!</p>

    <p>So, Wang Ying decided to try it first to see if he could swallow Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>"hehe."</p>

    <p>With Wang Ying's frivolous smile, he held a black sword and swept towards Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>At first, Wang Ying's swing of Wang Ying's sword with four ounces of sword energy only produced a small sword wave. However, the moment the sword wave was pushed out, it suddenly surged like a surging tsunami, forming a huge sword wave thousands of feet wide!</p>

    <p>The wildly dancing sword energy caused Wang Ling to move slightly.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling began to feel lucky that he had the foresight to change his school uniform and school pants before setting off... Otherwise, under the power of this sword, all his clothes would be stripped off.</p>

    <p>"Do you think this is the end? I didn't even use 10% of my strength with that sword strike just now."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying is particularly confident in his offensive.</p>

    <p>He quickly changed his direction. Every time he changed his direction, he struck a sword at Wang Ling. Huge sword waves from all directions rushed towards Wang Ling at the center, forming a huge convection. It seemed that Wang Ling Caught in the middle and unable to move.</p>

    <p>Such power is indeed astonishing. A fraction of a percent of the power can actually produce such an effect. This has been affirmed by Wang Ling in his heart.</p>

    <p>However, in the center of the sword energy, Wang Ling relaxed his muscles and bones.</p>

    <p>10% sword energy is still a bit too weak. It is impossible to trap yourself.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying saw this and reacted quickly. He launched a second round of attack again.</p>

    <p>To devour Wang Ling, you must first imprison Wang Ling. Just like a python swallowing its prey, you must first make the prey give up its struggle in a short time, leaving enough time for the shadow Devour!</p>

    <p>Ten percent Sword!</p>

    <p>This time, Wang Ying no longer held back. He originally wanted to save some power for use when devouring Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>But now. He has decided to stud!</p>

    <p>Reserve your own strength first to immobilize Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>The sword pressure caused by the 100% strength Sword is devastating.</p>

    <p>Any creature trapped inside will be torn to pieces.</p>

    <p>Only Wang Ling can be safe and sound.</p>

    <p>"Is it already ten percent..."</p>

    <p>"That's right! That's 100%! It's awesome!"</p>

    <p>However, after confirming that Wang Ying sacrificed a sword with 100% strength.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's face showed a deep look of disappointment. Two words popped out of his heart involuntarily: That's it?</p>
