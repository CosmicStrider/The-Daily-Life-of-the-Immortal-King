  <h1>Chapter 1915 Very good. This is normal!</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In this way, Wang Ling and Sun Rong disappeared for a whole day and did not go to school because of the Gray Cult mission. They were suppressed for the time being. There was also secret help from Zhuo Yi. Overall, it can be considered a near miss.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Sun Rong is also reflecting on this matter. She feels that it is better not to accept these strange commissions in the future... at the very least, there must be an audit and screening mechanism.</p>

    <p>Her original intention was just to help others. But unexpectedly, she was suddenly involved in a cosmic event!</p>

    <p>Good fella...</p>

    <p>She's a straight up good guy!</p>

    <p>Very good!</p>

    <p>This is very common!</p>

    <p>"Classmate Chen Qin!"</p>

    <p>Before Chen Qin left the student union office, Sun Rong suddenly stopped her. The expression on her face was more or less hesitant.</p>

    <p>Chen Qin paused and asked, "President, are there any other details you want to add to me?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong took a deep breath and said seriously: "That student Chen Qin... forget about the publicity thing. The leader of Gray Cult just sent me a message. She said that the core purpose of Gray Cult is to keep a low profile. Propaganda or something. It's a bit too showy. But if there is really something that needs Gray Cult's help, you can still find Gray Cult. I will convey the information. And you also don't need to call me president, just call me Rongrong."</p>

    <p>"Eh. Don't want to promote it? Okay..."</p>

    <p>Chen Qin felt a little pity. She was originally the director of the Publicity Department of Number 60 High School. Every sports meeting and large-scale school event, such as the previous spirit sword exchange meeting with Number 59 High School, all the contact documents were handwritten by her. She was very good at publicity.</p>

    <p>She obviously did a good deed to help others but kept it secret in her heart. This decision made Chen Qin a little confused, but it was not completely incomprehensible.</p>

    <p>And she was deeply moved by it.</p>

    <p>I think this Gray Cult leader is too chivalrous!</p>

    <p>She won her heart!</p>

    <p>Even if it cannot be promoted externally, it can still be spread internally by word of mouth!</p>

    <p>Isn't that how word-of-mouth develops?</p>

    <p>Word of mouth spreads from person to person. But the effect is better than spending a lot of money on marketing!</p>

    <p>"I understand Rongrong. I won't post the manuscript. I respect all the decisions of Master Gray Cult."</p>

    <p>At this moment, Chen Qin suddenly laughed when she thought of this: "By the way, Rongrong, you are Gray Cult's manager, right?"</p>

    <p>"ah?"</p>

    <p>"You are not an officer. How do you contact the leader of Gray Cult?"</p>

    <p>"Oh yes... I'm the manager!"</p>

    <p>"That's right. If there is a chance, I would like to meet the leader of Gray Cult and thank him in person. If it is inconvenient, it actually doesn't matter." Chen Qin requested.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong agreed immediately: "Okay. No problem. I will try to convey it."</p>

    <p>"Okay." After receiving the reply, Chen Qin jumped away like this.</p>

    <p>In fact, Sun Rong was not very familiar with the friends from the Publicity Department of Number 60 High School. Every time the student union had to carry out its work, Sun Rong had to rely on classmates with whom they had good relationships to convey the information on their behalf.</p>

    <p>This time she got on with Chen Qin. Sun Rong felt it was an unexpected gain.</p>

    <p>Chen Qin is the director of the Publicity Department of Number 60 High School. She has a lot of say. Wang Ling is actually particularly afraid of others bragging about her work on such official publicity documents. As a result, she has secretly revised them several times before. It will take a lot of effort.</p>

    <p>Now that I know Chen Qin, the subsequent operations will be much easier.</p>

    <p>The Propaganda Department is also responsible for communicating with external schools. In the past six months, Number 60 High School has won various provincial and municipal competitions. The comprehensive ranking of the campus has significantly improved across the country and even the world. This is a lot more opportunities to connect with external schools.</p>

    <p>In other words, the network resources Chen Qin has access to are wider than Sun Rong imagined.</p>

    <p>Now Chen Qin happens to be a Gray Cult believer.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong thought that maybe she could find a suitable opportunity to show off directly to Chen Qin that she was the leader of Gray Cult. It seemed like a good idea to bring her into the team as a cadre.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Monday, January 13th.</p>

    <p>After two days of review over the weekend, Wang Ling finally dealt with the recent major life event - the monthly exam.</p>

    <p>And all of this was based on Wang Ying's opinion. This time, he didn't push the score too hard. Instead, he got an above-average score.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan has been suspicious of him before. She has always wondered if he is deliberately trying to score points. He believes that by passing this exam. Wang Ling feels that this concern should be easily resolved.</p>

    <p>All Number 60 High School students had completed their exams on the same day. It was still the same eight subjects as before.</p>

    <p>Physics and chemistry in addition to math and calculus. Plus Talisman class, Spirit Sword class and spell course exam.</p>

    <p>Moreover, most modern cultivation colleges have intelligent grading systems. Except for some big questions and essays that compete with theoretical knowledge and need to be organized and written logically, questions such as selection and fill-in-the-blanks with standard answers are passed through the floating mechanical method used for grading. The correction can be completed directly.</p>

    <p>The previous Number 60 High School did not have such a mature system. But since Wang Ling came, everything has been different.</p>

    <p>Take campus rankings as an example. After Wang Ling came, Number 60 High School's ranking among high school cultivation colleges in the country jumped directly from 81st to 37th.</p>

    <p>It has jumped from 370th to 126th place worldwide.</p>

    <p>In just half a year, this is definitely an amazing improvement.</p>

    <p>In addition, with the support of Zhuo Yi, an old alumnus who graduated from Number 60 High School, the educational resources Number 60 High School now enjoys are indeed different from what they used to be.</p>

    <p>Originally it was only a lower-middle-class school. Now it is no exaggeration to call it a first-class school.</p>

    <p>So Wang Ling actually took the test on the same day. The results came out on the same day.</p>

    <p>And like everyone else. Enter it directly into the computer and automatically generate rankings.</p>

    <p>That evening, the lights were brightly lit in the teacher's office of Number 60 High School. None of the teachers left. They were all busy reading the rankings of the key students they were paying attention to.</p>

    <p>They are extremely serious.</p>

    <p>Even Principal Chen and Monk Jin Deng, who is the vice principal, came in person to watch the rankings of this monthly exam.</p>

    <p>Yes. Because the results of this monthly exam are actually very important. They will directly determine the list of entries for the freshman list of provincial and municipal high school cultivation colleges that is suddenly decided to be held at the end of the month.</p>

    <p>The previous lists were almost all selected from Teacher Pan's class. This led to more or less opinions from teachers in other classes.</p>

    <p>Although they successfully won the competition in the end, many teachers were still dissatisfied with some students in the participating student queue who had obvious paddling behavior.</p>

    <p>For example. Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>The grades of Wang Ling are actually very average in the eyes of teachers in other classes!</p>

    <p>But being able to play as a mascot every time is outrageous!</p>

    <p>So this time, Principal Chen directly decided to decide the order of the matches based on the monthly exam rankings.</p>

    <p>Because of this, the teachers had no objections.</p>

    <p>After all, monthly exams can best reflect students' recent academic performance.</p>

    <p>It's just that this ranking came out.</p>

    <p>All the teachers were dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>"Damn it. What's going on with Wang Ling's monthly exam this time? Why did the rankings of the whole grade rise so much!" A teacher was immediately shocked.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's scores in each subject are actually not that conspicuous on the subject list. It is only an average of more than ten points more than the last exam.</p>

    <p>As a result, the name Wang Ling was directly entered into the first place by the system on the ranking improvement list!</p>

    <p>Principal Chen seemed to have expected this result. He couldn't help but laugh: "Classmate Wang Ling is pretty good. It seems that Teacher Pan is very strict these days."</p>

    <p>"No, no." Teacher Pan shook her head modestly: "Wang Ling This child has been smart since he was a child."</p>

    <p>In fact, as the head teacher, she was already happy.</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan was actually the most nervous about this exam because Wang Ling's scores were always stuck in the middle. She was even questioned by other teachers about her teaching ability.</p>

    <p>But now. With Wang Ling's extraordinary performance in this exam, all the problems have been solved!</p>

    <p>Wang Ling, ah!</p>

    <p>The teacher doesn't always love you in vain!</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan was deeply moved.</p>

    <p>This extraordinary performance at a critical moment was a real help in times of need. It made her proud in the monthly exam rankings that so many teachers paid attention to.</p>

    <p>"So it seems that the principal has expected the results of this ranking?" At this time, other teachers became curious.</p>

    <p>"Actually, I know that many teachers are paying attention to this classmate Wang Ling. So before the results came out, I specifically asked General Zhuo for his opinion."</p>

    <p>Principal Chen said. Then he showed his mobile phone.</p>

    <p>The teachers discovered that Zhuo Yi just sent Principal Chen a group photo of seven gourd kids rescuing grandpa.</p>

    <p>"Gourd baby? What does this mean? Director Zhuo is really an old Riddler..." a teacher complained.</p>

    <p>"Well, I think what General Zhuo wants to express is that as long as you work hard, you will definitely gain something. In the end, the gourd boys saved their grandfather through their own efforts, didn't they?"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>At this time, as the vice-principal, Monk Jin Deng sighed silently in his heart.</p>

    <p>He just sent a text message asking Zhuo Yi. What does this mean.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi tells him.</p>

    <p>Hard-working gourd babies. There are indeed seven.</p>

    <p>But Grandpa. There is only one!</p>
