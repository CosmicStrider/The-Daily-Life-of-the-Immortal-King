  <h1>Chapter 1698 Waiting for each other to grow up</h1>

  <div>

    <p>After successfully delivering the box, the harmless-looking delivery boy quickly left the Wang family villa on his tricycle. He drove the car to a remote corner and made a call.</p>

    <p>The person on the other end of the phone told him something. Then the guy quickly replied: "Yes, boss. The customized gift box has been delivered."</p>

    <p>"Oh...that means I'll find another body, right? Then just abandon this body?"</p>

    <p>"That's it. You want me to look like a car accident? Don't worry, boss. Your subordinates will do it properly."</p>

    <p>After hanging up the phone, the courier boy's pupils dimmed quickly, then split into tentacle-like patterns.</p>

    <p>He rode a tricycle to the nearest road. He amplified his senses. After searching for several minutes, he finally settled on a Tesla electric and psionic hybrid vehicle that drove itself from afar.</p>

    <p>In the car, a family of three were sitting happily in the back seat. He pedaled the tricycle and sped past.</p>

    <p>Bang! A sound!</p>

    <p>The cars collided. There was a big explosion.</p>

    <p>With his body burned by the flames, he jumped onto the car and lifted the roof. He saw a man and woman who had been hit beyond recognition and hugged the unconscious girl tightly.</p>

    <p>Everything was as he expected.</p>

    <p>Human kinship will play a vital role at this moment.</p>

    <p>This little girl, who was only ten years old, was immediately protected by her parents after being hit. She did not die.</p>

    <p>And this is also the result he wants to see.</p>

    <p>"Mission accomplished."</p>

    <p>He couldn't help but curl his lips. Immediately, an invisible golden light separated from his body and attached to the little girl's body.</p>

    <p>From the next moment.</p>

    <p>He is no longer him.</p>

    <p>Her name is Chen Xiaomu.</p>

    <p>He was the only survivor in a car accident with a courier boy.</p>

    <p>At the same time, it is also the Old Dominator that continuously attaches itself to human consciousness on Earth.</p>

    <p>Same as the End Hunter in Old Dominator.</p>

    <p>This group of them also has an exclusive code name. It is called: Thought Plague.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>On the other side. Wang Ling received many birthday gifts. Chen Chao, Guo Hao and Su Xiao actually arrived first. After the three people handed the gifts to Wang Ling, they started sneaking around. Entered the house. He looked like he had a secret to tell Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling listened to Chen Chao's words. He was stunned: "You know. Wang Ling...I think. Sun Rong wants to give herself to you!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>It's just what other people said. When Chen Chao said it, Wang Ling immediately shed a drop of sweat on his forehead.</p>

    <p>Want to give yourself to him?</p>

    <p>It's not necessary...</p>

    <p>How could he accept a living person as a gift? And the most important thing is, he thinks Sun Rong is of no use and the noodles are not delicious at all.</p>

    <p>In addition, Wang Ling has no intention of falling in love at all. If he accepts this "gift", what should he do if he is misunderstood?</p>

    <p>These are all questions for Wang Ling to consider.</p>

    <p>As the saying goes, rabbits do not eat grass on the edge of the nest, high mid-term feelings between Wang Ling seems to have been unreliable, he felt that Sun Rong is still in a moment of brain fever ...... coupled with his attitude towards Sun Rong, but also just pure friendship, at this stage it is impossible to consider the long-term development.</p>

    <p>No...</p>

    <p>Not just at this stage. Even in the future it will not be possible.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling. Just make peace with it now. You said it was so obvious to her, so you just accepted it?" Guo Hao said, "Don't worry. Brothers will definitely support you with all their strength..."</p>

    <p>"But isn't it a bit too guilty to fall in love now? Teacher Pan will be unhappy if I know it." Su Xiao said.</p>

    <p>"She is just a pedantic old stubborn." Guo Hao retorted: "Besides, can this be called falling in love? This is clearly called enhancing friendship. Wang Ling and Sun Rong. This is in the process of enhancing friendship. Let's wait for each other to grow up."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Gods are waiting for each other to grow up!</p>

    <p>"Ling Ling, Miss Rong has given you a birthday gift. You have to thank her properly when you come back! Let's go out for a meal or something!"</p>

    <p>At this time.</p>

    <p>Mother Wang brought Sun Rong's birthday gift to Wang Ling. A pile of custom-made crispy noodles in a giant gift box made him very satisfied. And next to the gift box, there was a human figure. Gift box. It makes Wang Ling want to return it...</p>

    <p>"Ah ah! The weather is nice today. Wang Ling! Happy birthday to you! We will evacuate first!" Chen Chao was already laughing from ear to ear. He quickly patted Guo Hao and Su Xiao on the shoulders. Almost forcing the two of them to leave Wang Ling's room together, and then quickly disappeared.</p>

    <p>This kind of vision is not bad. Wang Ling feels that if he really likes Sun Rong. Chen Chao's move is definitely the strongest assist operation.</p>

    <p>To be honest, Wang Ling originally planned to send Sun Rong directly back. However, when he saw the human-shaped gift box, he still felt that something was wrong.</p>

    <p>"Don't bother. The secondary pupil's counter-control ability is ineffective." Wang Ling glanced out the window and sent a message to Zhuo Yi who was ambushing outside the villa.</p>

    <p>He was waiting for an opportunity outside the door of the Wang family's villa. Unexpectedly, before he exerted any force, he already felt the dead fish-eye stare from the room on the second floor of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>For a moment, Zhuo Yi felt a little disappointed.</p>

    <p>You are worthy of being a master. No one else has such insight...</p>

    <p>But from Wang Ling's tone just now, he heard a somewhat dignified tone.</p>

    <p>Is there something wrong with the gift box?</p>

    <p>If you already know that the gift box contains Master's Wife, under normal circumstances, with Master's temper, he would definitely send Master's Wife back without even opening the box.</p>

    <p>But now. Wang Ling has not done that.</p>

    <p>Writing makes Zhuo Yi realize the problem.</p>

    <p>He immediately went upstairs and saw Lord Ma and Er Ha sitting around the human-shaped gift box inspecting it.</p>

    <p>"What exactly is going on?" Zhuo Yi asked.</p>

    <p>"There is something wrong with the gift box. Miss Rong can't get out." Er Ha said.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "How is that possible?"</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "This gift box has been tampered with. It will explode if opened. And the explosion is not small. I'm afraid it will affect many innocent people. In addition, the explosion may bring cosmic energy radiation... causing Irreversible damage. Judging from the current methods, it should be those of the Old Dominator."</p>

    <p>"Fenmu Shen?"</p>

    <p>"It may be him. It may also be his followers." Er Ha said: "Of course. These are what Little Master Lingzi told me."</p>

    <p>"Can't it be demolished by force?"</p>

    <p>"If it is forced to be demolished, Miss Rong may endure unbearable pain. Even if she can be resurrected, there is no guarantee that her soul will be intact under the intense pain." Er Ha said: "Of course, in addition to this gift box, there are also crispy noodles in the box, are customized out-of-print flavors ... If it explodes, it would be too bad."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi: "..."</p>

    <p>It seems that this is the main reason for not demolishing...</p>

    <p>"What should we do now?" Zhuo Yi asked.</p>

    <p>Er Ha: "We can only let Lord Ma try it first to see if he can use some tricks to teleport Miss Rong out of the box alone..."</p>
