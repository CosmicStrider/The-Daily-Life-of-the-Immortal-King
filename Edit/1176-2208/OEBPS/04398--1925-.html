  <h1>Chapter 1925 Shengke's Data Pagoda</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Qu Shuling was almost the first to know the news that Li Changzhe arrived in Songhai City on the same day's immortal boat. This relied on big data clues collected by Shengke from various competitions over the years.</p>

    <p>Through contact with students from other schools during competitions, and through the data collection of Shengke contact lenses and contact gloves, the specific training data of students from other schools are compiled into a place called the Data Pagoda in Shengke.</p>

    <p>Then use the artificial intelligence embedded in the data pagoda to evaluate the basic talents of these high school students from other schools through the collected data. Calculate their basic cultivation growth value in the next few years without the assistance of any resources. Finally, the high school students will be evaluated. Students give ratings.</p>

    <p>SSS is the highest level. Followed by SS, S, A, B and C.</p>

    <p>This evaluation system was independently developed by Shengke. And the most amazing thing is that the data they collect is not limited to the basic panel data of students. Even their aura attributes can be collected. And it can be set up by Shengke in Song Aura monitoring tower in Hai City to collect the specific movements of these high school students.</p>

    <p>As the student union president of Holy Science College, Qu Shuling naturally has the right to use the data pagoda. Therefore, as soon as Li Changzhe came to Songhai City, the electronic map transmitted by the data pagoda came to his contact lens.</p>

    <p>There is a rapidly moving black light spot on it. Specific analysis shows that this red light spot is Li Changzhe himself.</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling was reading leisurely in the Songhai City Library. He deliberately remained calm. After waiting for a while, he looked at the mobile phone on the table.</p>

    <p>Buzz! Buzz!</p>

    <p>Sure enough, the phone vibrated.</p>

    <p>"Did Li Changzhe make an appointment with you?" Su Xingyue spread out the book and asked, covering half of her face.</p>

    <p>"Yeah." Qu Shuling nodded. This was expected. But Li Changzhe made an appointment with him two hours later.</p>

    <p>He and Su Xingyue had just returned from the Zhuque Gate and confirmed the location of the Jiutian Teahouse. However, Qu Shuling was not in a hurry to go in. He wanted to wait and see Li Changzhe and see how many people were fighting for this rare spot. What exactly will be done?</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling: "He asked me to meet in two hours."</p>

    <p>Su Xingyue was suspicious: "We have obviously arrived in Songhai City. It will take another two hours? Who are you going to see?"</p>

    <p>"It's normal."</p>

    <p>Qu Shuling was not surprised and said: "He also has friends in Songhai City. And as far as I know, Jian Shen College is also fighting for a place to go to the inner world this time. Their student union president and vice president have a relationship with Li Changzhe Excellent."</p>

    <p>"That Yi Zhiyang? The one who was beaten by Sun Rong in the previous game?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. He was injured before." Qu Shuling nodded and spoke concisely.</p>

    <p>At this point, Su Xingyue burst out laughing: "Hahahaha! I know him!"</p>

    <p>"It is said that he has not recovered yet. He cannot help his mental recovery. It is really difficult to get a quota in this state."</p>

    <p>Su Xingyue laughed so hard. After all, Yi Zhiyang's incident was also famous in the cultivation campus circles in Songhai City.</p>

    <p>It's not an exaggeration to call it a social death scene. it will take a long time to recover from this psychological treatment. And even if he does recover, Yi Zhiyang will quickly escape from the earth and live on another planet.</p>

    <p>Now Yi Zhiyang. is like the designated comedian in the cultivation campus circle.</p>

    <p>Although he is indeed very strong, many people can't stand it when they think of the match between him and Sun Rong...</p>

    <p>It's a bit difficult.</p>

    <p>But Su Xingyue also knows that besides Yi Zhiyang, Jian Shen Academy is not without experts.</p>

    <p>For example, their vice president of the student union is something to be wary of.</p>

    <p>In the data pagoda of Shengke. Gong Xuan, the vice president of Jian Shen College, is also one of the few students nationwide rated at the SSS level.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The school uniforms of Jingmen Number 8 High School are very unique. All students in the school wear hip-hop style hooded sweatshirts. The layout and workmanship of the clothes are similar to Number 60 High School. There is a Pekingese dog painted on the right chest, as a logo.</p>

    <p>Jingba, Jingba... This is a perfect homophony. It is said that the designer who originally designed this school uniform was deducted money on the spot because of the homophony. But the overall design of the school uniform is very unique because the students like it very much. It continued to be used.</p>

    <p>The school uniform of Jingmen Number 8 High School is indeed quite unique. Except for the Pekingese dog logo on the right chest, the text on the back is part of the sixteen-character school motto of Jingmen Number 8 High School.</p>

    <p>Because sixteen characters are too long, the school uniforms assigned to each student only show four of the sixteen characters.</p>

    <p>The three words written on the back of Li Changzhe are "continuous self-improvement."</p>

    <p>As soon as he landed, Li Changzhe saw a young man wearing a peaked cap and a black gown waiting for him at the exit of the Immortal Boatyard.</p>

    <p>He recognized it at a glance as the uniform of Jian Shen College. It was completely different from the exaggerated hip-hop style of Jingba. The conservative school style of Jian Shen College made their overall uniform look particularly simple.</p>

    <p>All black. On the chest is the logo of three swords overlapping each other.</p>

    <p>"Brother Xuan!" Li Changzhe was very excited when he saw the visitor. He quickly went over to shake hands with the young man.</p>

    <p>Gong Xuan slapped his hand away with a look of disgust. His voice was cold: "Talking while walking."</p>

    <p>In fact, the relationship between him and Li Changzhe is not that good. It was actually Yi Zhiyang who asked him to come to pick up Li Changzhe this time. He and Li Changzhe had only met a few times before. It turned out that Li Changzhe was a natural acquaintance. The kind that anyone would stick to with that face as hot as the sun.</p>

    <p>"Is Brother Yi feeling better? This time I came to Songhai City. In addition to doing my own business, I also want to see him." Li Changzhe said.</p>

    <p>"The president is not completely free yet."</p>

    <p>Gong Xuan sighed and replied: "He said, whenever he see sharp objects, his butt hurts."</p>

    <p>Li Changzhe: "Isn't it difficult to use a sword? What he is best at is swordsmanship..."</p>

    <p>Gong Xuan: "It's better now. It's just a dull pain. He can still use the sword despite the pain. It's not like before when he saw sharp objects and it hurt so much that he couldn't move. This psychological barrier can only be overcome slowly."</p>

    <p>"Hey. Then Sun Rong was really ruthless when she started. I heard from Qu Shuling that Number 60 High School was also selected this time. I feel very bad."</p>

    <p>"Don't underestimate Number 60 High School."</p>

    <p>Gong Xuan frowned. He looked at Li Changzhe and said seriously: "If nothing else happens, Number 60 High School should be our toughest opponent among all the high school schools competing for places this time."</p>

    <p>"I know. That's why I came to Songhai in a hurry." Li Changzhe said: "I was thinking about other schools and they had to find a way. Anyone can go. But at least they can't let Number 60 High School go. The ranking is only 37th in the country. What qualifications do they have to go?"</p>
