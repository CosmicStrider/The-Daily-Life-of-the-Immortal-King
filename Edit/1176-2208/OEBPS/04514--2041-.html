  <h1>Chapter 2041 The Mighty Saint</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The Wang Ling Here we continue to visit the ancestral land of the Sun family.</p>

    <p>At the same time, on the other side, in the depths of the infinite galaxy, surrounded by countless black holes, it was airtight. On the dragon star shining with holy brilliance, Bai Zhe in the form of a moonlight dragon opened his eyes.</p>

    <p>Although the earth is still under an invisible barrier due to Wang Ling, Bai Zhe still learned of Mingyue Ye's death through other means.</p>

    <p>Previously, he hid a life dragon scale on Mingyue Ye. It can be used to monitor Mingyue Ye's life status.</p>

    <p>Its essence is the old dragon scales metabolized from the current Bai Zhe. It is inconspicuous and has no other value. But it can provide Bai Zhe with a good barrier to avoid the earth. It can know what one wants by tracing back to the soul. What is the life state of the person being monitored?</p>

    <p>But now, he can no longer sense the relationship between this life dragon scale and himself.</p>

    <p>It's faster than expected.</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe swung the dragon's tail. The expression on his face couldn't be said to be too surprising. It seemed that he had already known that Mingyue Ye would be in trouble due to this.</p>

    <p>Anyway, he still has a lot of cards in his hand. Mingyue Ye is just the weakest one.</p>

    <p>Although the time of death was much earlier than Bai Zhe predicted, Mingyue Ye also accomplished his historical mission well.</p>

    <p>At least Bai Zhe knew the exact location of the Sun family's ancestral land.</p>

    <p>That was also part of Bai Zhe's plan.</p>

    <p>"The second chess piece. It seems you have already arranged it." Fenmu Shen said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"His name is Qiao Yanyuan."</p>

    <p>Bai Zhe said calmly: "It was originally sent to the earth with Mingyue Ye."</p>

    <p>The difference from Mingyue Ye is that Qiao Yanyuan is a powerful new dragon born supported by Bai Zhe. His fighting power is more powerful than Jingze and Yan? combined.</p>

    <p>Qiao Yanyuan was actually there when the bright moon night was swallowing up everything on the earth. The task assigned by Bai Zhe to Qiao Yanyuan was to guide Qu Shuling to swallow the dragon scale he gave him, so that he could complete a glorious evolution.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Out of her good impression of Wang Ling and the trust she gained after receiving help, Sun Ru guided Wang Ling into the fourth map.</p>

    <p>In the void. After Wang Ling took Immortal Toya into the core world, he followed Sun Ru across the sky. Soon, under Sun Ru's guidance, he saw a completely dried up abandoned pool on this ancient battlefield.</p>

    <p>It was originally a healing immortal spring. It was originally excavated from nature and then artificially transformed and beautified around the immortal spring pool. The surrounding area was surrounded by hard jade.</p>

    <p>After years of baptism, these spiritual jade have lost their original luster. The cracks on them are twisted and twisted, full of a mottled feeling of time.</p>

    <p>In the ancient battlefields of ancient cultivators, it was extremely important to have a healing immortal spring. You only need to sit cross-legged near the immortal spring pool. You can quickly recover internal and external injuries with the help of the natural power of the immortal spring pool, thereby achieving the best results on the battlefield. Battery life.</p>

    <p>Therefore, whether it is the main battle party or the defensive party, snatching the immortal spring pool is a routine operation in ancient battlefields. This is an important natural strategic point.</p>

    <p>If we can capture most of the immortal spring pools on the battlefield, our chances of winning the battle will increase significantly.</p>

    <p>Now, this healing immortal spring has completely dried up. If Sun Ru hadn't brought him here, Wang Ling wouldn't even have discovered this pool.</p>

    <p>"Senior Sun Ru, is the entrance to the fourth map space right here?" Immortal Toya asked in the core world.</p>

    <p>"This old immortal spring pool is of great significance. It was originally here... but I didn't expect it. After finding this place according to the coordinates, the pool has completely dried up. Originally, the immortal spring pool was in a full state. I plunged into it. In the water, you can reach the fourth map space." Sun Ru responded.</p>

    <p>This time span is too long. The immortal spring pool in the memory of that year is no longer the same. Although Sun Ru remembers that before she entered the infinite sleep in order to calm the blood demon, the immortal spring pool had already suffered a lot of wear and tear. But this is not enough. No... this was something Sun Ru never expected.</p>

    <p>"It must have been while I was sleeping. Someone else stole the spiritual power of the immortal spring pool in order to break through the realm." Sun Ru frowned for the first time and said with some complaints.</p>

    <p>For ancient cultivators, the immortal spring pool was of great significance. Because it was an important resource and strategic point on the battlefield, it was generally strictly controlled.</p>

    <p>And according to the collaborative agreement, the party to which the immortal spring pool belongs has the responsibility and obligation to protect the integrity of the immortal spring pool. Of course, it is also very important that the immortal spring pool cannot be borrowed for practice.</p>

    <p>Because these are limited natural resources. Once they are all consumed, they will no longer exist. Although the ancient cultivators in those days had constant wars, big and small, they also believed that this world of cultivation did not entirely belong to them. They should fight for it. Future generations are responsible. Leave something for them.</p>

    <p>But it's a pity. There are always those selfish and refined egoists in every era.</p>

    <p>Some people have even created a spell that can quickly absorb the spiritual power of the immortal spring pool and use it for their own use, thereby quickly improving their realm.</p>

    <p>Sun Ru sighed as she spoke. She even thought of a person: "I wonder if you, as a descendant of Laojun, have ever heard the Taoist name of a sad and powerful saint?"</p>

    <p>"Well. Senior Sun Ru said this. I do remember that I have seen this name somewhere."</p>

    <p>"This is the shame of ancient times." Sun Ru said: "She was originally a casual cultivator. Her original name was Huang Shengwei. However, she rose to several great realms in a very short period of time during the ancient times. Many people thought she was a genius... But in fact, she relied on stealing the spiritual power of the immortal springs controlled by the major families in ancient times to strengthen herself."</p>

    <p>"Has it never been discovered?"</p>

    <p>"It was already too late when she was discovered. She was very powerful. Most people couldn't do anything to her. In the end, it was the heads of several major families who discussed and personally took action to suppress her."</p>

    <p>Sun Ru sneered and said: "Back then, the spiritual power stolen by the sad and powerful saint from the immortal spring pool was converted into a specific value. It was nearly 1.341 billion."</p>

    <p>"So accurate?"</p>

    <p>"Because there were special statistics when the verdict was announced."</p>

    <p>"What Senior Sun Ru said is quite interesting. Senior Zhang Zhui called him an expert."</p>

    <p>"Huh? You actually know Zhang Zhui? But I think the behavior of the sad and powerful saint is much worse than this thief. At least this thief only steals from wealthy gentry. Sometimes he robs the rich and gives to the poor. But this sad and powerful saint steals It's a public resource."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Listening to Sun Ru's words, Wang Ling was staring at the immortal spring pool in front of him, thinking deeply in his heart.</p>

    <p>This immortal spring has now dried up. It stands to reason that Sun Yiyuan must have other ways to enter the fourth map. But if what Sun Ru said is true, then as long as this immortal spring is restored, you can directly enter the fourth map. Four map spaces.</p>

    <p>Thinking of this. Wang Ling At this moment, the spiritual energy in the palm of my hand burst out. I patted it forward. The golden spiritual energy surged forward. It was like a vast ocean pouring straight into this immortal spring pool that had dried up long ago. Li.</p>

    <p>Buzz!</p>

    <p>An unbelievable scene happened again for Sun Ru.</p>

    <p>The immortal spring pool that had dried up for countless years was restored to its full glory under the palm of Wang Ling! Above the immortal spring pool, the colorful glazed spring water reappeared. The flowers of the Dao were in full bloom. The damaged spiritual jade surrounding the pool absorbed the spiritual power of the spring water and regained its original luster.</p>

    <p>Just a palm of spiritual energy instilling it. Directly filling an ancient immortal spring pool?</p>

    <p>Sun Ru was shocked.</p>

    <p>You must know that in ancient times, an immortal spring pool could repair the injuries of millions of cultivators at the same time...</p>
