  <h1>Chapter 1308 Bronze Cat Negotiation</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The place abandoned by God. With the departure of the last three family heads, the place fell into silence again.</p>

    <p>The appearance of the gray mist creatures made the God Spirit Column feel helpless.</p>

    <p>It is unable to resist the gray mist creatures. It is even less able to refute what the gray mist creatures say.</p>

    <p>Enlightenment toys?...</p>

    <p>God Spirit Column is extremely helpless.</p>

    <p>For a long time, the creatures of the gray mist have been punished for interfering in the land abandoned by the gods.</p>

    <p>Zhu Ling has been patient and controlling his temper.</p>

    <p>But this time.</p>

    <p>Its endurance has reached its limit.</p>

    <p>Although it allowed the gray mist creatures to take away the three masters, it was just a delaying tactic.</p>

    <p>"Even if you pay the price this time... I will definitely let you get punished..." The voice of the pillar spirit echoed in the land abandoned by the gods.</p>

    <p>If there is one person in this world who can teach the gray mist creatures a lesson...</p>

    <p>Then. The God Abandoned Pillar can only think of one person.</p>

    <p>However, it is extremely dangerous to summon this person's soul to the land abandoned by the gods.</p>

    <p>If you are not careful, it will suffer backlash.</p>

    <p>However. In order to punish the gray mist creatures.</p>

    <p>At the same time, it is also so that Dao Ancestor Wang's way of cultivation can be passed down for a longer time.</p>

    <p>God Spirit Column knows very well that this gray mist creature has reached a point where it cannot be eliminated.</p>

    <p>Therefore. Even if this matter is risky.</p>

    <p>It will also go against the will of heaven...</p>

    <p>The next moment, God Spirit Column concentrated his energy and began to use the entire land abandoned by God to perform the summoning ceremony.</p>

    <p>The power of 6,000 lifetimes of cultivation... This is all the cultivation that the Pillar of Abandonment has collected so far through divine punishment.</p>

    <p>Now the Abandoned Pillar is sparing no effort to invest in it. Sacrifice it directly! Just to gain enough power to summon a person's soul!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling opens his eyes.</p>

    <p>I found myself summoned to a dark and claustrophobic space.</p>

    <p>What comes into view is a huge altar.</p>

    <p>"A place abandoned by the gods." Wang Ling immediately recognized what kind of place he had come to.</p>

    <p>Previously, when Monk Jin Deng was broadcasting live in the main hall of the Office of Strategic DeceptionTrue Venerated Immortal, he also learned about the existence of such a place by peeking at the screen.</p>

    <p>It's just that Wang Ling didn't expect it.</p>

    <p>I was actually summoned here.</p>

    <p>He was clearly still in the Wang family's small villa before.</p>

    <p>In the blink of an eye, Wang Ling felt his soul tremble slightly. Immediately, his soul was summoned here.</p>

    <p>"It must have cost a huge price..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is clear.</p>

    <p>There is no one in this world who has the ability to summon him.</p>

    <p>Unless you pay an immeasurable price.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at the altar in front of him. It was very clear who was responsible for the current operation.</p>

    <p>The God Spirit Column has the ability to punish all the souls in the world of cultivation. This ability can even directly transcend Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>Therefore, except God Spirit Column, no other person can do it.</p>

    <p>"What do you want from me?" At this moment, Wang Ling took a step forward.</p>

    <p>King's Eyes saw clearly the true form of God's Spirit Column.</p>

    <p>It was a bronze-colored cat with strange runes carved all over its body.</p>

    <p>Zhu Ling hid at the top of the Pillar of God's Abandonment. He gently licked his cat's paw: "If it's not a last resort, I don't want to trouble Ling Zhenren."</p>

    <p>"You know me?"</p>

    <p>"I've heard it for a long time," said the pillar spirit of the God's Abandoned Pillar.</p>

    <p>The main thing is that it can clearly know the real cause of death of every person who is sent to the land abandoned by God.</p>

    <p>It was precisely because of the scene where the six Dao Gods were crushed to death by Wang Ling at the same time. The Pillar of Abandonment of God further confirmed the power of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Before that, although Zhu Ling knew about the existence of Wang Ling, he had no real understanding of the true strength of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>"Are they the creatures in the gray fog?" At this moment, Wang Ling asked via voice transmission.</p>

    <p>He used the power of King's Eyes to rewind everything that had just happened in the God-Forsaken Land.</p>

    <p>At the same time, he also saw clearly the non-human creatures that appeared in the land abandoned by the gods and were wrapped in a thick layer of gray mist.</p>

    <p>This gray mist creature is arrogant.</p>

    <p>Total disregard for the authority of God's Spirit Column.</p>

    <p>With an extremely arrogant attitude, he took away the heads of the Wu, Li, and Sheng families. He also verbally humiliated Zhu Ling.</p>

    <p>And at this moment, Wang Ling saw all of this through the retrospective of King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>"Zhenren must have seen it too. How arrogant is this guy in the gray mist?"</p>

    <p>The bronze cat looked at Wang Ling. He spoke sincerely: "If we don't stop him and teach him a sufficient lesson, the world of cultivation will be in chaos... Don't worry, Ling Zhenren. I won't ask you to take action in vain."</p>

    <p>"?" Wang Ling is curious. I wonder what the Bronze Cat can offer in exchange.</p>

    <p>Now. Wang Ling knows that his horizons have become higher.</p>

    <p>Ordinary crispy noodles can no longer satisfy him.</p>

    <p>Unless it's the limited edition special flavor crispy noodles that he hasn't eaten before...</p>

    <p>And it's not enough to only send one pack!</p>

    <p>At least get one box!</p>

    <p>"I know. Ling Zhenren is rescuing a girl."</p>

    <p>The Bronze Cat of the Pillar Spirit in the Land Abandoned by the Gods said: "That girl is the child of the Void. The whole Void is looking forward to her return... Once the girl's soul falls into the hands of the Void, everything will be too late."</p>

    <p>In exchange for teaching the creatures of the gray mist a lesson, the Bronze Cat said: "I am a god-forsaken land. Only at the level of Dao God am I qualified to keep backups. If Ling Zhenren agrees to my request, I can make an exception. Let that person The girl's name also appears on my list."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, Wang Ling raised his eyebrows.</p>

    <p>He already understood what the bronze cat meant.</p>

    <p>The Pillar of Abandonment itself has the power to control the soul beyond the authority of Heavenly Dao.</p>

    <p>If the Abandoned Land comes forward to detain Sun Rong's soul first when it encounters a threat, this will undoubtedly add another layer of insurance.</p>

    <p>This exchange condition seems reasonable to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>After all, the girl herself only has the Foundation Building stage.</p>

    <p>Now I can get the privileges that only the Dao God level has.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling still did not agree directly.</p>

    <p>This is negotiation.</p>

    <p>Especially when the other party takes the initiative to come to negotiate, he takes the initiative.</p>

    <p>As long as you don't rush to agree, the other party will definitely continue to increase the bargaining chips.</p>

    <p>This is a method that Wang Ling learned from Father Wang. When Lie Mengmeng came to urge for manuscripts, Father Wang often did this trick. Then he "cheated" the recommendation positions of many novels...</p>

    <p>Everything went as Wang Ling expected.</p>

    <p>Just after he was silent for a few minutes, Bronze Cat indeed increased its "chips" again.</p>

    <p>"Okay Zhenren. I can open up another privilege. When the Sun Rong girl is allowed to leave the land abandoned by the gods, she will be liberated directly without spending any cultivation."</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling is silent.</p>

    <p>"In addition, I am also responsible for protecting the safety of this girl... As long as she is within the scope of the Forsaken Land, I will take action against anyone who breaks into this place, even if it is a void creature."</p>

    <p>"..." Wang Ling is silent.</p>

    <p>"Add another box of limited edition flavored crispy noodles..."</p>

    <p>"make a deal."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling agrees.</p>

    <p>When the bronze cat heard this, he couldn't help but let out a long sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>As a God-like being who can control the souls of cultivators, the Bronze Cat himself never expected that one day he would ask a young man on Earth to help him.</p>

    <p>The bronze cat thought he was God.</p>

    <p>However, it wasn't until it knew Wang Ling. that it clearly understood its mistake.</p>

    <p>It discovered that it was not qualified to be God.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ling. may be a being more powerful than God.</p>

    <p>God may have called Jobs away because he wanted to play with his mobile phone;</p>

    <p>God may have called away Kobe because he wanted to play basketball;</p>

    <p>But it is impossible for God to call Wang Ling away just because he wants to be beaten...</p>
