  <h1>Chapter 1605 The Secret of Liangzi in the 9th Palace</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The matter in the Jiugong family has been completely settled. The happiest person is naturally Jiugong Liangzi who is waiting for news in Huaxiu.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi has been paying close attention to the movements of Jiugong's family these days.</p>

    <p>She originally thought there would be some twists and turns.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, everything was handled in an extremely harmonious manner.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is... Gray Cult has actually become popular on Sun Island.</p>

    <p>Although there is no publicity on the surface, this religion can actually attract his father to join. As a literary exchange fan support club specially established for Wang Ling, Jiugong Liangzi feels that it is a bit outrageous.</p>

    <p>All I can say is that Sun Rong is indeed the opponent she has always respected.</p>

    <p>This time she asked Sun Rong to do everything beautifully and he did it beautifully. She submitted an answer sheet with nearly full marks.</p>

    <p>But Jiugong Liangzi felt that this matter was not as simple as it seemed.</p>

    <p>"What's wrong? You look absent-minded?" Zhuo Yi put a bite of vegetables into Jiugong Liangzi's bowl.</p>

    <p>It is actually very obvious when there is contrast in emotions.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi is in a very happy mood.</p>

    <p>Because the master is coming back.</p>

    <p>And Zhou Ziyi is also in a good mood, because his legs are already growing and developing.</p>

    <p>A toe has grown out of the broken leg after the transplant.</p>

    <p>Now Zhou Ziyi's legs are covered by a heat-insulating glass cover. He feels like he is tending two pots of flowers and plants.</p>

    <p>It's just different from the ordinary watering method.</p>

    <p>In addition to keeping warm, Zhou Ziyi also needs to take in a lot of nutrients to ensure the smooth growth of the granulation in the broken leg.</p>

    <p>Seeing that Jiugong Liangzi didn't speak, Zhuo Yi simply guessed the girl's little thoughts.</p>

    <p>The two have lived together for so long. Zhuo Yi feels that they still have a tacit understanding.</p>

    <p>"If you want to thank classmate Sun Rong. Actually, I have a good suggestion." Zhuo Yi said with a cold smile.</p>

    <p>Of course, in addition to this reason, he also thought of other things... but at this juncture, he couldn't take the initiative to bring it up.</p>

    <p>Think about it from a routine perspective.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi thinks.</p>

    <p>So much time has passed.</p>

    <p>Tonight is already the best moment for a showdown.</p>

    <p>"Who wants to thank her..." The girl's cheeks instantly became hot.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi felt that the eyes of the man in front of him were terrifyingly accurate.</p>

    <p>It's as if he has some kind of mind-reading spell. He always hits her right where it hurts.</p>

    <p>But Zhuo Yi has no such ability...</p>

    <p>The main reason is that the girl herself showed her flaws.</p>

    <p>For example, when Zhuo Yi went online in the morning, he saw the following search information in the search engine records.</p>

    <p>"What do the eldest ladies of the Huaguo Shuilian Group like?"</p>

    <p>"What does Sun Rong like to eat?"</p>

    <p>"What are the hobbies of Sun Rong from Huaguo Shuilian Group?"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Yes.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi is an Internet novice. He usually doesn't know how to search for similar things. He always greets his female assistants and asks them to search, and then tells her in turn.</p>

    <p>But now she is living in Zhuo Yi's house these days. She can't speak directly to Zhuo Yi, so she thinks about having enough food and clothing by herself. As a result, she doesn't even know to delete her search history.</p>

    <p>"This is a deal! A trade of equal value!" Helpless, Jiugong Liangzi had no choice but to confess.</p>

    <p>But in fact, when she said this, the girl's face clearly showed a guilty conscience, because she had other things she was hiding Zhuo Yi...</p>

    <p>Two people get along and live together. On the surface it is a relationship between the employer and the bodyguard.</p>

    <p>But in fact, in the eyes of outsiders, they are already a couple.</p>

    <p>At least when Zhou Ziyi lived with them these days, he always treated her as "sister-in-law."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi thought he would mind very much.</p>

    <p>On the surface, he scolded Zhou Ziyi not to talk anymore, but in his heart, he was not disgusted by such a title.</p>

    <p>She is not a fool.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi said that the relationship is between the employer and the bodyguard. But how can an employer live directly in the bodyguard's home...</p>

    <p>Although Jiugong Liangzi didn't say anything about this relationship, judging from his actions, he actually recognized Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Now the matter at Jiugong's side has been resolved.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong and the others will also return home soon.</p>

    <p>All order will return to normal.</p>

    <p>What gift to buy for Sun Rong as a thank you is a headache for Jiugong Liangzi.</p>

    <p>But mostly because. She feels like she's going to have to leave when things get back to normal.</p>

    <p>Even when I first lived here Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi had various discomforts. But now when she thought of leaving immediately, she realized that Zhuo Yi had already laid a dragnet to trap her tightly.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It was a boring dinner.</p>

    <p>Zhou Ziyi is a smart person. He vaguely felt that something big was going on tonight, so he hid in his room after eating and didn't say a single word.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi saw this. He knew the time had come.</p>

    <p>So he took the initiative to knock on Jiugong Liangzi's door. The door was not closed tightly. It was just ajar. Zhuo Yi knocked twice and opened it.</p>

    <p>When he entered the door, he saw Jiugong Liangzi packing his things in a storage bag. There were two faint traces of tears on his face. His eyes were also red, as if he had just cried.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi said nothing. He just took a step forward, stretched out his arms, and hugged Jiugong Liangzi tightly from behind: "Do you really want to leave? Liangzi?"</p>

    <p>That voice was so soft that only two people could hear it.</p>

    <p>From the moment Zhuo Yi walks in the door.</p>

    <p>Start by saying what you just said.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi felt that his last psychological defense line had been breached.</p>

    <p>Her legs were a little weak. The storage bag in her hand fell down. While wiping her tears, she said: "I have always said that you are a liar... actually... actually I... I am the liar..."</p>

    <p>"In this life, there are always times when people lie. One or two lies is normal. What's more, even if Liangzi lies, it must be a kind lie." Zhuo Yi laughed. He buried his face in the girl's shoulder. Said softly.</p>

    <p>"But I... but this lie of mine is not kind..." Jiugong Liangzi suddenly pushed Zhuo Yi away. He straightened his flat upper body slightly and rested his head on Zhuo Yi. chest.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi only felt the temperature of his body rising sharply. It exploded instantly.</p>

    <p>It was rare for a girl to take the initiative, which made him happy.</p>

    <p>"I also have something to hide from you. Let's do it like this. You say one thing and I say another. Let's exchange." Zhuo Yi said.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi looked at Zhuo Yi in his eyes. He could no longer suppress the sin of lying in his heart.</p>

    <p>She stared at Zhuo Yi. She mustered up her courage and said: "Zhuo Yi... Actually... actually, I am not sixteen... I am older than my classmate Sun Rong.. I am 20 years old this year..."</p>

    <p>"Yes." Zhuo Yi nodded. The expression on his face was unwavering.</p>

    <p>This is Jiugong Liangzi's biggest secret all the time.</p>

    <p>At least in her own opinion, it's a secret.</p>

    <p>But Zhuo Yi didn't care at all.</p>

    <p>Because this means it.</p>

    <p>He and Jiugong Liangzi can interact normally!</p>

    <p>And he doesn't have to be accused of being a pervert who likes sixteen-year-old girls...</p>

    <p>"Why are you... not surprised at all..." Faced with Zhuo Yi's bland reaction, Jiugong Liangzi felt surprised.</p>

    <p>"What I like is you. What does age have to do with it? Even if you tell me you are a 200-year-old witch, I won't mind it." Zhuo Yi said and hugged the girl tighter.</p>

    <p>"Who is the witch..." Jiugong Liangzi shed tears. He lightly bit Zhuo Yi's shoulder.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi remained silent.</p>

    <p>After a few seconds, he asked, "Are you feeling comfortable?"</p>

    <p>"In exchange, I'll tell you something. I'm hiding something from you."</p>

    <p>At this time, Zhuo Yi said: "Do you still remember the first time when you came to Number 60 High School to find me?"</p>

    <p>"Of course I... remember."</p>

    <p>"I've loved you since then."</p>
