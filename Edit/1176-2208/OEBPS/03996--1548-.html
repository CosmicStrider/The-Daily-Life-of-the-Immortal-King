  <h1>Chapter 1548 The Monk's Way of Acceleration</h1>

  <div>

    <p>A group of people from Number 60 High School are worrying about the "high-class banquet."</p>

    <p>On the other side, Monk Jin Deng is still conscientiously executing the tasks assigned to him by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>After accepting the Chaos Armor, he followed Zheng's footsteps. However, Zheng's movement speed was too fast.</p>

    <p>When the steel wings on the back are opened, they can freely travel through space. It is equivalent to having an additional "shrinking method" that has no cooling time and does not need to be activated by oneself.</p>

    <p>Just open the steel wings.</p>

    <p>In addition. Zheng also has the advantage that you don't need to worry about chaos intrusion.</p>

    <p>The flow of time in chaos is very different from that on earth. The monk chased for a while. A long time may have passed on earth...</p>

    <p>On the way to return the Chaos Armor, the monk never saw the figure of Zheng. An idea came to his mind involuntarily.</p>

    <p>If he pursues him so unrestrictedly...</p>

    <p>When he returns to Earth, will Ling Zhenren even have children?</p>

    <p>After restraining his dangerous thoughts, the monk looked stunned. Then he speeded up again.</p>

    <p>He pulled out his head and turned it upside down and carried it behind his back.</p>

    <p>Then there was a loud bang!</p>

    <p>The six scars on his head suddenly emitted endless blue jet flames, leading the monk's body forward quickly!</p>

    <p>This is a skull-type backpack accelerator. It is a small skill developed by the monk himself.</p>

    <p>I can't say it's too powerful. But it's more practical.</p>

    <p>It's just because it's scary to use. The monk has never shown it in front of outsiders.</p>

    <p>Use the skull-type backpack accelerator and the "shrinking the ground into an inch" method without stopping.</p>

    <p>The monk finally felt Zheng's breath getting closer to him.</p>

    <p>"That will work. The poor monk should be able to catch up soon." At this time, the monk's head behind his back showed a calm smile.</p>

    <p>Ahead. Picking up Peng Xiren is like sprinting a million light years Zheng.</p>

    <p>Suddenly I felt a familiar breath approaching from behind.</p>

    <p>Zheng: "..."</p>

    <p>"Is it that monk?"</p>

    <p>Zheng frowned. It was unclear why the monk was chasing him.</p>

    <p>Could it be that he wanted to kill him while he was sick, considering that he had destroyed two chaos weapons and was seriously injured?</p>

    <p>If this matter were placed on other people, Zheng might be wary.</p>

    <p>But what Monk Jin Deng said...Zheng felt that the other party would not do something so immoral.</p>

    <p>"Let me go." Peng Xiren was tightly restrained by Zheng.</p>

    <p>He originally wanted to wait until Zheng took him some distance away before looking for an opportunity to escape.</p>

    <p>However, he still underestimated the power of Earthly Ancestor-level masters.</p>

    <p>He is just in the realm of Dao Ancestor.</p>

    <p>But Zheng. is Earthly Ancestor.</p>

    <p>There is also a "Human Ancestor realm" gap between them.</p>

    <p>Therefore, even if Zheng is injured now, it is more than enough to suppress him.</p>

    <p>"If you don't obey me, don't blame me for beating you." Zheng glared at Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren actually suffered a lot from Dao Ancestor Wang or Zheng when he was a teenager.</p>

    <p>Once upon a time. Naturally, Dao Ancestor Wang taught him a little more lessons.</p>

    <p>Sometimes Dao Ancestor Wang happens to have something to do and is unable to take action. As a spirit of Dharma with independent consciousness, Zheng will do it for him.</p>

    <p>Peng Xiren back then.</p>

    <p>Every inch of flesh on this body.</p>

    <p>Zheng. None of them were spared.</p>

    <p>Even looking back now, Peng Xiren, as the victim, still can't help but tremble.</p>

    <p>He thought he could break free.</p>

    <p>But now that it's obvious that I can't run away, I have to give in temporarily: "Brother Zheng..."</p>

    <p>Zheng: "..."</p>

    <p>"Then where is my master?" Peng Xiren asked in a low voice.</p>

    <p>This is something Peng Xiren has always wanted to know.</p>

    <p>Because if Dao Ancestor Wang exists, it will affect his next plan.</p>

    <p>Zheng answered: "I don't know."</p>

    <p>This may seem like prevarication. But in fact, Zheng does not know the whereabouts of Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>He is the spirit of Dharma with independent will.</p>

    <p>Although he can act on his own and has the ability to think independently.</p>

    <p>And it can continue to survive even after the owner disappears.</p>

    <p>But one thing won't change.</p>

    <p>That is Zheng can never go against Dao Ancestor Wang's will.</p>

    <p>And this is why Zheng wants to snatch back Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>Because when Peng Xiren is in danger, an alarm sound that cannot be heard by ordinary people will constantly sound in his head, making him extremely irritable.</p>

    <p>For a long time, Peng Xiren didn't speak.</p>

    <p>Even Zheng doesn't know the whereabouts of his master, Dao Ancestor Wang...</p>

    <p>Now Peng Xiren was really unsure.</p>

    <p>"Where is Brother Zheng taking me?" Peng Xiren asked again.</p>

    <p>"My residence." Zheng said. The words were concise and to the point.</p>

    <p>Now Peng Xiren. He is too good at causing trouble.</p>

    <p>Zheng thinks it's better to watch it by yourself.</p>

    <p>Of course. The most critical point is that Peng Xiren also colluded with the person Zheng disliked very much...</p>

    <p>Dao Ancestor Wang spent so much money to suppress Fenmu Shen.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, after countless years, he would be his only disciple to break the seal.</p>

    <p>He didn't know how deep the current connection between Peng Xiren and Fenmu Shen was.</p>

    <p>But on the way through, he heard Peng Xiren mention something very magical.</p>

    <p>That is Fenmu Shen actually wrote a book about his deeds. And the name is {Fenmu Shen Chronicles}...</p>

    <p>Zheng sighed.</p>

    <p>He decided to imprison Peng Xiren in his residence.</p>

    <p>Let's recover a little bit from the injury. Then go and completely eliminate Fenmu Shen...</p>

    <p>Although the opponent is very powerful.</p>

    <p>But as long as it hasn't merged with the other half of the soul in the sky tomb, the chances of winning are still very high.</p>

    <p>But now that he has lost two Chaos Devices, his winning rate will drop slightly from the original level.</p>

    <p>But overall, it will not change the situation of that battle.</p>

    <p>It's just that Zheng doesn't know why.</p>

    <p>There was always a sense of uneasiness in his heart.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Infinite Galaxy. In front of an unknown seven-color star chart. Zheng stopped while holding Peng Xiren.</p>

    <p>Seems to be waiting for something.</p>

    <p>But how long.</p>

    <p>The appearance of Monk Jin Deng, who carries a head as a jet.</p>

    <p>Zheng: "..."</p>

    <p>This kind of weird trick can only be imagined by a monk.</p>

    <p>"Zheng. You ran too fast." Jin Deng chased all the way here. However, his face was not red and he was out of breath.</p>

    <p>"You followed me all the way. Why?"</p>

    <p>There was a hint of vigilance in Zheng's eyes: "This is the monk in front of my house...Although I have lost my Chaos Qi and been injured, I still have many magic weapons at home that I can use."</p>

    <p>"The poor monk has been chasing you all the way. Of course he is not here to fight with you."</p>

    <p>The monk smiled kindly. Then he took out the fully repaired Chaos Armor from his sleeve and explained his purpose: "I am here to return this thing."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Zheng saw the intact Chaos Armor. He was obviously stunned for a while.</p>

    <p>His armor was as broken as tofu before...</p>

    <p>Can this be repaired?</p>
