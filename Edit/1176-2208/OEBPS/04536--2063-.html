  <h1>Chapter 2063 Wang Muyu's path to apprenticeship</h1>

  <div>

    <p>At the beginning, Wang Ling helped Chen Chao and Guo Hao arrange masters. At the same time, he also helped Wang Muyu arrange a master. In terms of realm and combat power, Yi Jianchuan was a sword master, he was a brave general who was galloping on the battlefield. But, after all, he was still no match for Wang Muyu, who grew up rapidly with the power of his bloodline.</p>

    <p>Just like what Bian Shu said, the little guy has huge potential for development. And the reason why Wang Ling arranged for the Sword Master to teach him is actually more important, it is the spiritual construction.</p>

    <p>A strong man cannot just have fighting power. He must also have a strong heart and a stable state of mind.</p>

    <p>In the entire world of cultivation, the fighting power of Father Wang and Mother Wang is so insignificant that ordinary ones can no longer be ordinary. But sometimes Wang Ling feels that his parents are extremely powerful. They are the key to his spiritual construction.</p>

    <p>The couple taught Wang Ling to be kind, teach him patience, teach him how to practice and uphold justice, teach him calmness, teach him not to bully, etc.</p>

    <p>On the road to growth in cultivation, the shaping of one's state of mind is equally important as one's state of mind and combat effectiveness.</p>

    <p>The little guy grew up too fast with his own bloodline genes. So Wang Ling felt that he needed such an excellent mentor.</p>

    <p>In this regard, he quite approved of Sword Master's character.</p>

    <p>And he felt that bringing up Wang Muyu's spiritual state of mind might also help the Sword Master himself. Maybe he could learn some Heavenly Dao from Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>All in all, this is a master-disciple combination that can perfectly complement each other in terms of state of mind and realm.</p>

    <p>Of course. It is true that Wang Ling has his own layout.</p>

    <p>After all, in this world, world peace certainly cannot be protected by him alone...</p>

    <p>He is just a seventeen-year-old child.</p>

    <p>Therefore, Wang Ling will also secretly provide as much help as possible to some powerful figures who have sufficiently high moral standing and kind hearts in the cultivation circle.</p>

    <p>And this is Wang Ling's "comprehensive support plan for powerful factions." The fundamental purpose is to prepare for the future.</p>

    <p>The earth is not his alone. It needs to be protected by everyone.</p>

    <p>It is precisely for this reason that it is actually very important to improve the overall state of mind.</p>

    <p>Since the upgrade of the earth, the highest realm of cultivators on the earth no longer has the shackles of True Immortal. However, it will take at least thousands of years to develop to the level of the Soul Formation realm sweeping the streets in the divine realm.</p>

    <p>That's why Wang Ling launched this plan. It is intended to speed up the cultivators on Earth.</p>

    <p>Priority will be given to pilots from those capable players who already have enough reputation and have passed the inspection.</p>

    <p>It's not just the Sword Master. In fact, all the other ten generals are also on Wang Ling's support list.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Time goes back to the morning of January 20th. The Qingfeng Hall is located south of the suburbs of Songhai City. The famous Songhai Reservoir is not far from the Qingfeng Hall. The straight-line distance is no more than two kilometers.</p>

    <p>On the way Wang Ling and a group of people took the Zhuo Yi bus to the Office of Strategic Deception, Wang Muyu followed the address to the Qingfeng Hall. He took the Huaguo Shuilian Group's special car. Yes Sun Rong specially prepared it after greeting Mr. Wang.</p>

    <p>Qingfeng Hall is a famous sanatorium in Huaxiu country and a reception place for important guests. Almost all the big shots have been here. It is full of spiritual energy and has a large area. It is an excellent place for spiritual practice.</p>

    <p>To be honest, after hearing that Wang Ling found a master for himself, Wang Muyu was not very happy. The little guy who only focused on combat power still only had Wang Ling in his heart. He felt that there was only one in the world. Wang Ling can teach him.</p>

    <p>And the person he was going to take him to see now seemed to Wang Muyu to be just a mortal who had only half stepped into the realm of Venerated Immortal. He was too weak.</p>

    <p>What qualifications does he have to teach?</p>

    <p>But having said that, Wang Muyu went obediently. After all, this was arranged by Wang Ling. He felt that there might be something special about the old man he met.</p>

    <p>On the contrary, he invited Wang Muyu to the Qingfeng Guild Hall knowing that the Sword Master wanted to recruit a disciple. Boss Sun's attitude was much more positive than Wang Muyu's.</p>

    <p>Knowing the news at that time, Sun Yiyuan also said in his heart that Wang Muyu had a bright future.</p>

    <p>At such a young age, the Sword Master took notice of him. The future is promising! So he arranged everything for Wang Muyu. He even sent his own special car to take Wang Muyu to the agreed place. He also didn't forget to find someone to help Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>The Sword Master's recruitment of disciples is of great importance. How could it be leaked out so easily?</p>

    <p>Therefore, except for Sun Yiyuan, Sun Rong and Butler Lin, no one else in the Sun family knew what Wang Muyu was doing at Qingfeng Guild Hall.</p>

    <p>Butler Lin, Lao Lin, is the Sun family veteran who has the most contact with Sun Yiyuan and Sun Rong. He is honest and hard-working. The key is that he is not a talkative person.</p>

    <p>"I can only send you this far. Master Muyu."</p>

    <p>The car drove to a fork in the mansion. Butler Lin, who was responsible for seeing Wang Muyu off, stopped the car. Then he looked in the rearview mirror and said to Wang Muyu: "You go along the road on the right. You will see the Sword Master."</p>

    <p>"Okay. Thank you, Uncle Lin." Wang Muyu thanked him politely, then opened the car door and jumped out.</p>

    <p>Looking at Wang Muyu's calm back, Butler Lin couldn't help but sigh.</p>

    <p>It is said that the most important thing for a swordsman is to be calm.</p>

    <p>If other children knew that they might be chosen as disciples by the Sword Master, they would probably faint from excitement, right?</p>

    <p>Look at little Muyu. How calm he is!</p>

    <p>Be calm... This is the proper attitude of a master!</p>

    <p>"That master would like him so much." At this time, Lao Lin looked at Wang Muyu's retreating back. He felt that he understood a lot of things in an instant.</p>

    <p>The official meeting place with the legendary sword master is by the artificial lake of Qingfeng Hall.</p>

    <p>The artificial lake is very vast. The surrounding mountains stretch. The sun shines on the lake, reflecting dots of golden light. From time to time, fish jump out of it.</p>

    <p>Not long after Wang Muyu walked along the main road, he saw an old man wearing a white training suit and a red belt fishing on the shore.</p>

    <p>This is probably the sword master...</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu murmured in his heart.</p>

    <p>He didn't go over immediately. Instead, he simply snapped his fingers and untied the hairdo that the stylist had made for him. He let his bangs hang down naturally again. He changed out of the carefully prepared suit. He put on a smaller version of Wang Ling's "World Peace" sweatshirt.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu prefers nature. The sticky hair on his back made him very uncomfortable. However, he didn't say it when he was styling it. Instead, he chose to endure it.</p>

    <p>Because he knew that this was the good intention of Mr. Boss Sun. He would just wait until there was no one around and find a chance to return to his normal self.</p>

    <p>"Little guy, you are finally here. I am here. I have been waiting for you for a long time."</p>

    <p>Soon, a voice came from the old man on the shore. The disembodied voice had a sense of immortality.</p>

    <p>This meeting was far more peaceful than Wang Muyu imagined.</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu, who had changed into regular clothes, put his hands inside his sweater and walked over. Facing the completely unfamiliar person in front of him, Wang Muyu asked tentatively in a very childish voice: "Grandpa, do you want to accept me as a disciple?"</p>

    <p>"Haha. Not sure yet. It depends on your qualifications. But... the person who recommended you is the head of the Zhan Sect. I don't think he would lie to me." Yi Jianchuan smiled and looked at him intently. He said while looking at the lake.</p>

    <p>"Then let me ask Grandpa, how do you view qualifications?" Wang Muyu asked.</p>

    <p>"Here. This is for you."</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan nodded. He handed the fishing rod in his hand directly to Wang Muyu: "Can you fish?"</p>

    <p>"Does this mean that fishing qualifications are judged? Isn't that too hasty, grandpa?" Wang Muyu asked.</p>

    <p>"The material of this fishing rod is special. It can accurately analyze your spiritual power and related qualities."</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan laughed loudly: "Especially. If you have the talent to learn Sword, it will be a big bonus. Therefore, the fish you can catch will be bigger."</p>

    <p>Wang Muyu continued to ask calmly: "How big is the largest fish in this lake?"</p>

    <p>Yi Jianchuan replied: "The bottom of this artificial lake is connected to the Songhai Reservoir. The Songhai Reservoir has a history of thousands of years. It is rumored that there is a huge thing lurking under the bottom of the lake."</p>

    <p>"Okay. I understand." Hearing this, Wang Muyu nodded.</p>

    <p>The little guy's chat just now wasn't because he knew nothing about the situation at the bottom of the lake. He was just stalling for time.</p>

    <p>After all, if he goes down with this pole, he may be able to pull the monster at the bottom of the lake directly out of the water...</p>

    <p>The purpose of his delaying time was to select fish.</p>

    <p>To be honest, Wang Muyu didn't want to become the sword master.</p>

    <p>So now he should fish up a slightly smaller one. It would be better to use this to prove that he does not have the talent to practice Sword.</p>

    <p>But at the same time, Wang Muyu didn't want to make it difficult for Lord Diulei and Wang Ling, so he thought it would be okay to catch a moderate one.</p>

    <p>As a result, after this hesitation and confusion... more than ten minutes passed.</p>

    <p>He didn't catch a single fish.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Yi Jianchuan, who was standing next to him, had his mouth wide open, showing an expression of extreme astonishment.</p>

    <p>In fact, it doesn't make any sense how big the fish is.</p>

    <p>The real point is how long Wang Muyu can hold this fishing rod.</p>

    <p>This is a premonition fused with the True Immortal sword intent...</p>

    <p>Under normal circumstances, a child of Wang Muyu's age would faint within less than ten seconds of holding it.</p>

    <p>As a result. This little guy was left here not even struggling for more than ten minutes like a normal person...</p>

    <p>Oh my god!</p>

    <p>What a genius!</p>

    <p>Unparalleled genius!</p>
