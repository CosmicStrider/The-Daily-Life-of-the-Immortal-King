  <h1>{Valentine's Day Special} Extra 1: Sun Rong's special chocolate</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Preface: The timeline of this chapter is before Wang Nuan decided to implement the big plan of Tao Lu Wang Ling (shortly after Ling Rong entered university).</p>

    <p>Chapter 1: Sun Rong's special chocolate</p>

    <p>The day before Valentine's Day. Sun Rong got up early.</p>

    <p>I took my phone out from under the pillow and found that the time had just settled on six in the morning.</p>

    <p>Gently pressing the call bell beside the bed, two young maids pushed the door open and entered. One of them was carrying a jade basin, and the other was carrying a tray. On the tray were various toiletries.</p>

    <p>After the girl completed her washing work with a sense of ritual.</p>

    <p>The expression on her face looked extremely serious.</p>

    <p>He looked as if he was about to go to the battlefield.</p>

    <p>"Are you all ready?"</p>

    <p>While asking. Sun Rong changed into a white shirt and short skirt.</p>

    <p>One of the maids came around behind her and tied the apron on the girl. She replied: "Yes. Miss... everything is prepared according to your instructions yesterday."</p>

    <p>"Very good." Sun Rong nodded with satisfaction.</p>

    <p>After all, this is the first time she's pretending to be brave. She wants to make chocolates for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>In order to complete this big plan, Sun Rong has been preparing for a full month.</p>

    <p>The total can be divided into the following steps.</p>

    <p>First: Use the power of the family group to collect high-quality raw materials for making chocolate from all over the country. Hire special personnel to manually screen these high-quality raw materials;</p>

    <p>Second: Hire famous dessert masters who make chocolate from all over the world, and finally let these masters work freely to produce customized chocolate that matches the characteristics of their own country.</p>

    <p>Third: Hire a master who is responsible for making crispy noodles. Customize special crispy noodles for chocolate filling. And make sure that the hardness of the crispy noodles is ensured when sandwiching the crispy noodles to ensure that crispy texture.</p>

    <p>It's a bit like the process of making fried milk balls filled with ice cream.</p>

    <p>However, the technical difficulty is actually not particularly high.</p>

    <p>You only need to apply a hardening technique with "timing" ability on the prepared crispy noodles to temporarily increase the hardness of the crispy noodles.</p>

    <p>As for. Why should the hardness of dry noodles be increased?</p>

    <p>Naturally, this is to pave the way for the fourth step that is about to happen...</p>

    <p>In the kitchen of the villa, there are sixteen dessert chefs standing in a row in the spacious kitchen.</p>

    <p>In front of them lay a chocolate dessert that they had spent a whole night conjuring up ideas and making with ingenious techniques.</p>

    <p>Among these masters, there are four masters in Huaxiu. They are all top-notch figures in the industry.</p>

    <p>And other masters are also from different countries.</p>

    <p>In order to ensure the cleanliness and hygiene of desserts.</p>

    <p>Each of them wore thick protective clothing and kitchen gloves.</p>

    <p>He is standing patiently in front of the dessert he made, waiting for the girl to review it.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong Put on your gloves. Go into the back kitchen.</p>

    <p>"I've met the eldest lady."</p>

    <p>Sixteen dessert chefs greeted the girl warmly in fluent Mandarin.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong came to the first master. This pastry master was proficient in carving skills. He actually carved the chocolate he made into a phoenix.</p>

    <p>"Miss. This is me..."</p>

    <p>The master was about to introduce his work, but was stopped by the maid next to him: "Master, please be patient. Miss, I will ask you questions if necessary."</p>

    <p>"Okay!" The master laughed.</p>

    <p>The maid used a knife to cut off one of the chocolate phoenix's claws. Then Sun Rong carefully held the part and took a small bite.</p>

    <p>"It tastes good." After savoring it carefully, the girl nodded.</p>

    <p>"Thank you for the compliment, Miss." The first master breathed a sigh of relief: "So, Miss, don't you have anything to ask?"</p>

    <p>"Tasty is the most important thing." Sun Rong smiled. Then he faced everyone in the room and said, "Thank you for your hard work, masters. No matter how the dessert tastes, the fees will be settled to the masters normally! If the taste satisfies me, I will. On top of the original employment fee, a bonus of 20% will be added."</p>

    <p>"Thank you, Miss!"</p>

    <p>Sixteen pastry chefs bowed in unison.</p>

    <p>The girl in front of them was indeed richer than they thought.</p>

    <p>The cost of a trip here to make special chocolates is worth their entire year's salary!</p>

    <p>The sponsor is here. Even if they stay up and work all night, they naturally won't care too much.</p>

    <p>After nearly an hour of screening and repeated comparisons, Sun Rong began to fall into the final choice.</p>

    <p>All the dessert chefs were called out, leaving only the girl and the two maids behind her.</p>

    <p>"Which one did the young lady like?" the maid asked.</p>

    <p>"The first and eighth courses are both good."</p>

    <p>The taste of chocolate is very important. It is sweet but not greasy. Although the chocolate desserts made by other masters also have their own characteristics.</p>

    <p>But there are only these two. There is an extremely smooth feeling after the entrance.</p>

    <p>The rich chocolate flavor engulfs every taste bud.</p>

    <p>The key is that it won't stick to your teeth.</p>

    <p>"Hey. It's so hard to choose. Let's go with these two."</p>

    <p>Finally. Sun Rong made a decision.</p>

    <p>"So. Do you want to call these two masters in?" the maid asked.</p>

    <p>"Need not."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong shook his head: "You two. Put all these two works into my alchemy furnace."</p>

    <p>Maid: "?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "What are you still doing? Go quickly!"</p>

    <p>Maid: "Don't you plan to make chocolate yourself?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "Yes. I made it myself! I will personally supervise the work later. Melt the two chocolate desserts. Then pour the slurry into the crispy noodle-shaped mold to shape it. I always It has been prepared for a long time."</p>

    <p>The maid was shocked: "..."</p>

    <p>It turns out that I called so many masters here, not just to teach them how to make chocolate!</p>

    <p>That's okay...</p>

    <p>Anyway, what the lady said is right!</p>

    <p>As a qualified maid, they can only follow instructions and arrangements.</p>

    <p>In the afternoon.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong takes out his own special chocolate from the template and seals it into a gift box with freezing function.</p>

    <p>So far.</p>

    <p>Nothing is too difficult.</p>

    <p>The step of sending it out is perhaps the hardest part...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In the early morning of May 20th, Wang Ling woke up naturally from a deep sleep.</p>

    <p>"Eternal Talisman" allows him to no longer have to worry about accidental snoring sometimes causing earthquakes.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ming said that the current "Eternal Talisman" is just a trial product. There will be several updates in the future.</p>

    <p>The man promised that he would develop a perfect version once and for all before he graduates from college.</p>

    <p>Open the curtains. Open the windows. Wang Ling Let the wind and sunlight drift in from the window.</p>

    <p>The spring breeze blew through his hair, gently playing with his bangs...</p>

    <p>He enjoyed this comfortable and leisurely moment very much.</p>

    <p>These are the rights he never enjoyed before switching to "Eternal Talisman."</p>

    <p>The sounds that bothered him disappeared. Only peace and quiet remained.</p>

    <p>He does not need to be troubled by uncontrollable energy;</p>

    <p>You don't need to pay special attention when eating. You are afraid of breaking your chopsticks;</p>

    <p>Don't even worry. You might have fallen down on the road, which would bring a devastating blow to the life you love...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling held his face with one hand. He supported his body with the other hand and leaned on the window sill.</p>

    <p>After a few minutes, he opened his eyes from this enjoyment.</p>

    <p>It's a rare vacation at home. It seems unusually quiet at home today.</p>

    <p>Release spiritual consciousness. Wang Ling noticed that he seemed to be the only one at home.</p>

    <p>Then... he suddenly remembered.</p>

    <p>Today is Valentine's Day.</p>

    <p>Father Wang and Mother Wang went out to live in a world of two!</p>

    <p>As for Ah Nuan girl, she was temporarily entrusted to Mr. Wang's care.</p>

    <p>"Valentine's Day..." Wang Ling's face still showed little emotion.</p>

    <p>He recalled the bad experiences he had on Valentine's Day several times before. Almost every Valentine's Day was spent with Sun Rong with Li Youyue, Chen Chao and Guo Hao.</p>

    <p>The key is that every time, something unexpected happens...</p>

    <p>Now everyone has been admitted to the ideal university.</p>

    <p>This year's Valentine's Day, maybe I can finally spend it in peace?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked out the window at the wind and beautiful scenery. I thought in my heart.</p>

    <p>Before switching to Eternal Talisman.</p>

    <p>Spending the holidays alone is indeed a luxurious expectation for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling feels that his expectations are not as strong as before.</p>

    <p>He even felt like he was missing something...</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling! Good morning!"</p>

    <p>At this time, just as he was in a trance, a girl's voice came from the window. An extremely familiar voice.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Note: There are two chapters in the Valentine's Day special. The second chapter will be released at 15:00 today through the WeChat public account (Kuxuanjun).</p>
