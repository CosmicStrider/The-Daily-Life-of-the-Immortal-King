  <h1>Chapter 1990: Robbery incident</h1>

  <div>

    <p>"That's what happened. Classmate Wang Ling..."</p>

    <p>The student union office at eight o'clock in the evening. Su Xingyue has evacuated. Only Sun Rong and Jiugong Liangzi are left.</p>

    <p>They called Wang Ling here. Then they truthfully explained the other party's demands according to Su Xingyue's agreement.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Wang Ling. Don't put too much psychological pressure on it. If you don't agree, just say it. I'll help you reject it." Sun Rong said with a stiff smile.</p>

    <p>Although she had noticed that the boy didn't seem to be listening to what she said carefully.</p>

    <p>It can be seen that his thoughts are still stuck on the "quantum crispy noodles" she mentioned dozens of seconds ago.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong don't know why a pack of crispy noodles can bring so much energy to Wang Ling. Even those dead fish eyes are blooming with lotus...</p>

    <p>It can only be said that Su Xingyue really has something. This time she was completely defeated by Su Xingyue.</p>

    <p>"Hey..." Seeing this scene, Jiugong Liangzi couldn't help but sigh. She patted Sun Rong's shoulder to express comfort.</p>

    <p>She wanted to say that men are unreliable.</p>

    <p>But when the words came to her lips, she swallowed them back alive.</p>

    <p>One is because in terms of strength in this world, there really is no man more reliable than Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>And as far as his preference for instant noodles is concerned, Jiugong Liangzi also feels that Wang Ling has a kind of firmness and persistence that is unusual for ordinary people... This is also something that other men cannot do!</p>

    <p>It's a pity that the emotional intelligence has never been clear. It does make people a little anxious.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, there is actually another reason why she didn't say it.</p>

    <p>That's herself. She already has a man...</p>

    <p>Even though that old liar, Zhuo Yi, had many strange problems, she only discovered them after she fell in love.</p>

    <p>For example, he grinds his teeth while sleeping, talk in his sleep, and fart very smelly...</p>

    <p>But there is one thing to say. Old Liar Zhuo was really nice to her. He gave her priority in every aspect, no matter how big or small.</p>

    <p>For the first time in her life, she felt like she was being held in someone's hand and loved.</p>

    <p>Compared with the intrigue life inside Jiugong's family, Jiugong Liangzi found that she would be more relaxed and happy living with Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>So she really couldn't say the words "men are unreliable."</p>

    <p>Compare Sun Rong's current situation. She is a bit too Versailles here.</p>

    <p>Even in normal times, Jiugong Liangzi pays special attention to try not to post those disgusting pictures showing affection in the circle of friends.</p>

    <p>Showing affection is for outsiders to see... that's called "killing the dog."</p>

    <p>If you show it to your friends, especially those who are single, it would be a little too much.</p>

    <p>This kind of time is often a time to test the strength of friendship.</p>

    <p>As long as the other party doesn't block you, you will always be good friends...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>It's eight o'clock in the evening. Sun Rong and Jiugong Liangzi haven't gone back yet. This is because the previous conversation with Su Xingyue was very late.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ling also rarely stayed in school today. First, he was on duty. Second, Teacher Pan found him and had a one-sided conversation.</p>

    <p>It's still a matter of the spirit world and the Earth Center plan. Even though Wang Ling has tried very hard this time to focus Teng Luchen's attention on Li Changzhe and Zhang Linyan.</p>

    <p>But Jingmiyuan seems to have not completely given up on Number 60 High School...</p>

    <p>"This is classmate Wang Ling. It can be seen that you have tried your best in this spiritual world trial."</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan found him, pushed up her glasses, and said to him: "However, at the joint request of classmates Zhang Linyan and Li Changzhe, they told Jingmi Institute that if the two of them are selected to work on the Earth Center Project later, they hope that you can go together too."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Teacher Pan said earnestly and patted Wang Ling on the shoulder: "Hey. Wang Ling. I didn't expect that you are usually such a quiet handsome man in the back row. You can be so attractive. On the other hand, representatives from two prestigious universities have asked to form a team with you.</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>To be honest. This was another unexpected turn for Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>In the end, he still failed to avoid the activities of the Earth Center project.</p>

    <p>Maybe this is the legendary bad fate.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, there is a cycle of cause and effect. Sooner or later, you will have to pay it back.</p>

    <p>After all, the entrance to the Earth Center Plan is at the top of the sky, under the Palm Cliff. And this entrance was actually opened by him with one palm...</p>

    <p>It's like giving the Earth Spirit a penetrating wound in the face and then leaving it alone.</p>

    <p>It's just that the entrance was extremely small back then. It might be thinner than the eye of a needle. Wang Ling didn't realize that the earth had actually been penetrated by the energy of that palm after finishing the blow.</p>

    <p>Now after endless years of baptism, this invisible loophole has finally become the entrance to the inner world of the earth...</p>

    <p>Ultimately, Wang Ling still owes the Earth Spirit an explanation.</p>

    <p>The beautiful earth needs to be cared for by everyone.</p>

    <p>But now it seems that it is too late to fill the loopholes again. Now that human cultivators have discovered the passage into the center of the earth, they will inevitably not give up the exploration of the inner world.</p>

    <p>The Earth Center studies and related professional courses that have become popular in recent years are actually paving the way for the future Earth Center plan. No matter how rich, rare or novel any resource is, once it is explored by humans, it will be a disaster.</p>

    <p>Mortal greed is always a sin that cannot be abandoned. Now the pressure on the surface of the earth is already overwhelmed. If we wait for the resources in the center of the earth to be hollowed out...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling cannot imagine whether he can still peacefully live his ideal daily life.</p>

    <p>So, make peace with what you have come. Wang Ling knows that his trip is actually to pay off a debt. And he still has to go.</p>

    <p>The battle for honor between the two immortal realms can be left to Zhang Linyan and Li Changzhe.</p>

    <p>And what he is thinking about now is to take advantage of this great opportunity of the Earth Center project to enter the interior of the geocentric world and naturally find a way to fill this hole.</p>

    <p>So after meeting Sun Rong here, Wang Ling immediately planned to meet Li Changzhe.</p>

    <p>He rarely takes the initiative to find people. But this time he did it out of necessity...</p>

    <p>Because if he wants to fill the hole, according to his envisioned plan, Shengke cannot completely abandon it.</p>

    <p>Therefore, he helped Li Changzhe, Zhang Linyan and Su Xingyue of Shengke reach a reconciliation. In fact, it was also a logical event within the plan and deployment of Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>So he is not the kind of person who can't walk around after seeing novel instant noodles... All of this was within his expectation!</p>

    <p>But at this moment, he was standing at the door of the hotel. Suddenly he felt a hint of ominous premonition...</p>

    <p>By this time in the morning, the mist master Luo Lan had already come to see Li Changzhe. This is very clear to Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>However, in modern cities where there are many cultivators, Wang Ling's ability to sense breath has always been accurate. If there are high-level masters around, he can sense it quickly.</p>

    <p>After all, cultivators above Itinerant Immortal are still a minority on the current earth...</p>

    <p>But now, Wang Ling can clearly feel that there are four cultivators above the casual cultivation realm in this hotel alone!</p>

    <p>Combined with the fact that Li Changzhe's chatterbox has lost his voice. For Wang Ling it is not difficult to judge... This guy may have been attracted by four powerful men at the same time! They all want to accept him as their apprentice!</p>
