  <h1>Chapter 2034: Caring for the elderly. Everyone has a responsibility</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan, who is eager to take away Wang Ling, Sun Rong, actually has one thing he didn't say. That is, once the Mountain-Suppressing Knight is activated, it often indicates that the ancestral land may have fallen into irreversible greatness. Crisis.</p>

    <p>While Sun Yiyuan urgently transferred Wang Ling and Sun Rong away, he was also mentally prepared to defend the ancestral land to the death. After all, there are all the secrets about the ancestral land. No one can compare with him in this position. The head of the Sun family knew better.</p>

    <p>Follow the bloodstains of the knights who guard the mountain in Biyoudongtian. When Sun Yiyuan successfully passed through, what he saw was a glacier filled with wind and snow.</p>

    <p>Each of the hundreds of thousands of mountains in the Sun family's ancestral land has its own terrain characteristics. No matter what kind of terrain you can see here. The glacier in front of you is the "frost purgatory" behind the "unique cave." The temperature is maintained at minus 78 degrees.</p>

    <p>The wind and snow here have a bone-eroding power. Once it touches the skin, it will immediately penetrate into the depths of the bones mixed with the power of Yin. It is a cold that even the monks in the Nascent Soul stage cannot resist.</p>

    <p>If you don't have adequate means of warmth and magic weapon protection under Soul Formation, you will be frozen into an ice sculpture directly here.</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan was still wearing the exquisite suit that he originally participated in the "Songhai City Cultivator Representative Association." He followed the blood stains and walked on the glacier with a serious expression. He took off his coat as he walked.</p>

    <p>Then he took off his tie and unbuttoned his white shirt one by one. He put them all into the storage space, revealing his amazing and strong muscles.</p>

    <p>It is hard to imagine that the elderly head of the Sun family is actually a hidden muscular man after taking off his coat. This is completely different from the gentle and gentle image that Sun Yiyuan has always portrayed.</p>

    <p>The falling ice and snow covered Sun Yiyuan's back, eyelashes, and beard with frost.</p>

    <p>Then.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>Boss Sun's skin began to burn with blazing fire.</p>

    <p>The Flame of the Ming King!</p>

    <p>This is the body-protecting effect after practicing the Fudo Myooh Kung Fu to the highest level. It can withstand the severe cold of minus 120 degrees Celsius.</p>

    <p>When the skill is activated, the body will have the special effect of being surrounded by flames. It will look like a walking Flame Lord.</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan moved his muscles while walking.</p>

    <p>Modern life is too comfortable.</p>

    <p>He hasn't fought for too long.</p>

    <p>And this kind of fighting form, because there has been no switch for a long time, made Sun Yiyuan himself a little uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>The sound of fierce fighting ahead attracted Sun Yiyuan's attention.</p>

    <p>A ray of light flew through the void. A knight wearing silver dragon skin light armor and a silver dragon helmet holding a sword in both hands slammed into a glacier.</p>

    <p>In an instant, the glacier was directly smashed through. Then the entire mountaintop collapsed directly. Endless ice crystals fell from the sky. A hailstorm fell on the spot.</p>

    <p>The Zhenshan knight was kicked away directly. Such a scene was unimaginable to Sun Yiyuan.</p>

    <p>It was only then that he saw the intruder clearly. He was a man wearing an eye patch and a black gown. He always had a sly smile on his face. His white teeth were reflected by the nearby glaciers. Especially dazzling.</p>

    <p>Full of danger...</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan frowned slightly.</p>

    <p>This is someone who even the Zhenshan Knights have not been able to capture directly. And at this moment, he still exudes the smell of heavenly materials and earthly treasures. I think that after sneaking into the Sun family's ancestral land, he has eaten a lot of heavenly materials and earthly treasures that grow in the ancestral land. treasure.</p>

    <p>"Even so, Sun Yiyuan was neither humble nor arrogant. He straightened his back and showed his pride as a descendant of the Sun family: "Who are you? You dare to invade the ancestral land of my Sun family."</p>

    <p>"I see. This is the ancestral land. I wonder why there are so many good treasures."</p>

    <p>Mingyue Ye laughed even more wildly. He stared at Sun Yiyuan: "Old man, I came here today just to tell you that your ancestral land can change hands. Not only this ancestral land, but also the whale outside. I also want to tame them. From now on, this place will be my ancient territory."</p>

    <p>After that, a ray of light came from a distance again.</p>

    <p>This is the giant sword thrown by the mountain knight. The speed is incredibly fast.</p>

    <p>However, Mingyue Ye didn't even look at the trajectory. He directly raised his swords together and clamped the giant sword firmly.</p>

    <p>He sneered and looked in the direction of the Zhenshan Knight: "One by one. It's endless. They are carrying out sneak attacks while I am talking. You, a battle puppet, are not ordinary."</p>

    <p>Mingyue Ye naturally saw the origin of this Zhenren knight. Even if the Zhenren knight did something similar to Zhenren, he would bleed and shed tears, and he had the same combat logic as a normal cultivator, or even more advanced. But it was fake after all. Fake.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if he wanted to give Sun Yiyuan a blow. Mingyue Ye did not attack Sun Yiyuan directly. Instead, he raised his hand and directly attracted the mountain knight from a distance.</p>

    <p>In front of Sun Yiyuan, he grabbed Zhenshan Knight's neck tightly and sneered: "Old man, do you really think that placing such a toy in the ancestral land will be useful? But this toy is above True Immortal. Judging from the realm of people on earth, it is indeed extraordinary."</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan frowned more and more: "Your Excellency, are you not from Earth?"</p>

    <p>"Yes or no, it is no longer that important. From now on, I will be a human being on Earth, and the future of the Earth will be entirely decided by the prehistoric people."</p>

    <p>Mingyue Ye said as he spoke, and then with a sudden squeeze, he tore off the entire head of the Mountain Guard Knight. He seemed to be dismantling a toy. He let out crazy sizes, from the head to the limbs, and tore off the Sun family's Mountain Guard Knight. Just tore it into pieces.</p>

    <p>"I was just playing with this battle puppet. He was imprisoned while moving. But he naively thought that he could defeat me."</p>

    <p>Mingyue Ye shrugged helplessly. Then she looked at Sun Yiyuan: "You, a True Immortal, also want to compete with me?"</p>

    <p>He snorted coldly.</p>

    <p>Immediately he raised his hand and pointed it at Sun Yiyuan again.</p>

    <p>An invisible force was generated from the void. The most powerful spiritual pressure that did not belong to the same dimensional level instantly fell over. The pressure was so heavy that Sun Yiyuan could not move.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Sun Yiyuan also felt this force clamping down on his neck.</p>

    <p>Ming Yueye repeated his old trick. He planned to use the same spell to suck Sun Yiyuan into the palm of his hand.</p>

    <p>However, at this moment, he suddenly felt that something was wrong.</p>

    <p>He didn't know why. Mingyue Ye found that Sun Yiyuan's body seemed to have suddenly gained a lot of weight.</p>

    <p>Wrong...</p>

    <p>It's not that the old man is getting heavier. It's that there is another force that is competing with him.</p>

    <p>Who is it!?</p>

    <p>At this moment, behind Sun Yiyuan, Mingyueye saw a familiar and terrifying figure of a young man wearing a 60's High School uniform with his trouser pockets inserted, slowly walking in the snowstorm...</p>

    <p>At that moment, the panic from the soul suddenly surged into Mingyue Ye's heart.</p>

    <p>He immediately couldn't help but cursed in his heart.</p>

    <p>Why...</p>

    <p>Why is it this haunting boy again!</p>

    <p>Just like a ghost!</p>
