  <h1>Chapter 1387 Old God's Altar</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ying's breath was very strong. It also made Er Ha break into cold sweat for a moment.</p>

    <p>In fact, Wang Ying was the third line of defense in this operation.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling deliberately arranged it this way. It is to ensure that this operation is foolproof.</p>

    <p>After receiving the order, Wang Ying blended into Er Ha's shadow and sneaked in.</p>

    <p>And. It's well hidden along the way.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly, after seeing Sun Ying'er wall-dong Sun Rong, Wang Ying's mood began to fluctuate slightly...</p>

    <p>"Master of Shadows. You have to restrain yourself..." Er Ha said through the message. It was trying to appease Wang Ying. It hoped that Wang Ying could calm down: "It needs to be solved. You can arrange it after you get out."</p>

    <p>These words finally made the restless Wang Ying regain his composure again.</p>

    <p>He folded his arms and huddled in Er Ha's shadow. Using Er Ha's shadow as a cover, he quietly watched Sun Ying'er's various reactions and performances.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>"Danger!"</p>

    <p>At this moment, Sun Ying'er felt like there was a huge word of danger hanging over his head.</p>

    <p>She re-perceived her surroundings and found that Wang Ying's aura had disappeared again.</p>

    <p>Is it an illusion?</p>

    <p>It was because she was hit by the wall too many times, which caused the action of the wall-dong to affect her spirit, causing her breath judgment system to fail.</p>

    <p>Anyway, let's talk about it. To sum up, isn't it just that I was spoiled by the gorilla Wang Ying?</p>

    <p>"Woooo! Rongrong! I seem to be a little abnormal because of Wang Ying, the gorilla!"</p>

    <p>"You finally discovered it..." Sun Rong sighed. He touched Sun Ying'er's little head: "Also, what the hell is a gorilla?"</p>

    <p>"Anyway, when I say he is a **, he will become a **. Why not just call him a gorilla!" Sun Ying'er said.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>In fact, sometimes Sun Rong thinks Wang Ying is quite difficult.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er's mouth is carefree. It's completely different from her temperament. She's just a mouthful and a master of slander.</p>

    <p>But the problem is... Ying'er is very cute.</p>

    <p>I can't bear to let people be really cruel.</p>

    <p>Although Ying'er complained to her every day about Wang Ying bullying her, Sun Rong never saw any external injuries on Sun Ying'er's body.</p>

    <p>Facts prove.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying looks crazy, but he is actually a measured man.</p>

    <p>"Buzz!"</p>

    <p>At this moment, there was a shaking sound in the ancient temple.</p>

    <p>The wall with Dao Ancestor Wang's palm print suddenly sunk in completely and then separated to the left and right.</p>

    <p>"It's really a trap! There's a secret room hidden inside!" Sun Ying'er exclaimed.</p>

    <p>When the wall was opened, what everyone saw was a top-secret altar hidden behind the wall!</p>

    <p>"It's actually a square altar?" Er Ha was also surprised.</p>

    <p>Square altars are rare, because most altars are integrated with formations. Most of the formations are circular! But the altar in front of you is based on the four corners of the room as its fulcrum. It directly frames the entire room. Entered the altar.</p>

    <p>Engraved on the ground are mysterious ancient characters that even Er Ha cannot understand.</p>

    <p>Most of these mysterious ancient characters come from the Gods. Only a few of them are Heavenly Dao characters. This proves that the person who decorated the altar is none other than the Old God himself.</p>

    <p>"Here is an altar to the Old God." Er Ha said.</p>

    <p>Combining the scene before us, it is actually not difficult to deduce this conclusion.</p>

    <p>So now. A new problem arises.</p>

    <p>What is Old God's purpose in decorating this altar?</p>

    <p>In the center of the altar. Sun Rong found a small coffin.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong took a step forward. He squinted his eyes and looked carefully: "Is this...customized by Old God after he returned to youth?"</p>

    <p>"If it's just to build a coffin for yourself, why would you put so much effort into building such an altar?" Er Ha said.</p>

    <p>Wherever there is an altar, there is probably a purpose behind it.</p>

    <p>At present, the evidence they have is insufficient, so it is not yet possible to conclude that this is a conspiracy of Old God.</p>

    <p>But based on experience and intuition, Er Ha felt that the existence of this altar must not be a good thing.</p>

    <p>At this moment, there were gusts of dark wind in the secret room, with a bone-crushing coldness. Accompanied by a woman's cries that came and went, the coffin in front of me was opened with a bang!</p>

    <p>It was the white bones of a baby. But the right arm was missing.</p>

    <p>"Old God bone?" Er Ha looked hesitant: "Why does a deceased Old God Kaikai-King emit such a strong ghost aura?"</p>

    <p>This sudden dark wind is permeated with powerful pressure and energy. It is also mixed with a kind of divine energy. Although it is very weak, Er Ha can feel it.</p>

    <p>Then, the altar glowed brightly. A shadow with closed eyes emerged from the center of the altar.</p>

    <p>"Ajuan?!" The phantom suddenly appeared, shocking everyone.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong Make sure you read it right!</p>

    <p>This is the soul of Miss Ajuan!</p>

    <p>In the coffin, the remains in the infant form of the Old God trembled slightly. Ajuan's soul merged with the remains, and finally transformed into a little girl wearing a red dress and black leather shoes.</p>

    <p>This is the appearance of the little girl of the Old God. In the previous scroll, everyone has seen it!</p>

    <p>"I have finally waited for this day."</p>

    <p>The little girl made a voice. But the voice was extremely old. It was obviously not Ajuan's voice.</p>

    <p>"Are you Old God?" Sun Rong looked ahead warily. She couldn't believe that Ajuan was poisoned after being separated from them: "What did you do to Ajuan!"</p>

    <p>"I have been waiting for many years. I have never elected the next successor to the God Realm. Just for this day."</p>

    <p>The little girl said: "There is no more suitable candidate than Ajuan. She has no Old God soul. As long as she is old enough, merge it with my baby remains. Theoretically, I can be restored to the appearance of sixteen or seventeen years old." And the appearance will be fixed in that time forever."</p>

    <p>"But you seem to be impatient." Er Ha looked at the little girl in front of him.</p>

    <p>The Old God of the Divine Realm. The last King of the Divine Realm. The aura on her body is very terrifying!</p>

    <p>The breath of Ten Thousand Winged God. This is the first time Er Ha feels it!</p>

    <p>It is indeed ridiculously strong!</p>

    <p>"That's right. Ajuan is still too young now. If he can grow into a mature woman, he might be what I want after merging with me." Old God laughed.</p>

    <p>"But. Dao Ancestor Wang doesn't mind your appearance! Even if it's your old age!" Sun Rong said. She had envied this kind of love from the beginning. At the same time, she also admired Dao Ancestor Wang very much.</p>

    <p>"He doesn't mind. But I do."</p>

    <p>Old Heavenly Dao: "No woman can endure her own old age. She can endure the pain of having to part with the one she loves after returning to childhood..."</p>

    <p>"But Dao Ancestor has a way!" Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"He has no choice! Don't think that you know everything! A man's words are never trustworthy!" Old God was very unhappy: "In order for God's world to become better, I can only sacrifice Ajuan. This is also helpless. matter."</p>

    <p>"It's just high-sounding hypocritical remarks." Sun Rong frowned: "Dao Ancestor Wang actually likes you. Maybe this is the biggest stain in Dao Ancestor's life."</p>

    <p>As he said that, Sun Rong held Aohai tightly, his body shaking slightly with anger.</p>

    <p>"What? You still want to fight me? A Foundation Building?" Old God laughed.</p>

    <p>"Hand over Miss Ajuan!"</p>

    <p>The next moment, she pulled out Aohai and pointed the sword edge at the Old God: "Otherwise, even if you are a god! I won't be polite!"</p>

    <p>The sword energy mixed with the Heavenly Dao Rubik's Cube and the power of chaos roared out!</p>

    <p>The urging on the spot made Old God's shoulders sink!</p>

    <p>"impossible..."</p>

    <p>Old God raised his eyes. Shock was written on his face.</p>
