  <h1>Chapter 1594 The Darkest Moment</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Zhang Zhui stared at the scene in front of him dumbfounded. The palace of the outer gods was shaking. Everything was in a state of collapse.</p>

    <p>Then, he heard a cracking sound coming from the palace. It seemed like something was about to collapse.</p>

    <p>"Just one punch. The palace of the outer gods collapsed..."</p>

    <p>In the Supreme Wrapped Corpse Map, those Eternal-level experts were all shocked. Who would have thought that such an invincible young man would appear today after an eternity.</p>

    <p>Palace of Outer Gods...</p>

    <p>That is the ancient cosmic civilization. It is a symbol of supreme power among the Old Dominator tribe. It is also a symbol of hegemony.</p>

    <p>No one would have thought that the Palace of the Outer Gods would be like this. It was destroyed by Wang Ling's punch. It was as crispy as a piece of tofu.</p>

    <p>Those supreme laws of the outer gods are as powerful as an electrical grid criss-crossing the palace. They can punish anything that is disrespectful to them.</p>

    <p>However, in front of Wang Ling, these laws are in vain.</p>

    <p>The broken palace of the outer gods is no longer peaceful.</p>

    <p>"Boom!"</p>

    <p>Thousands of pitch-black tentacles emitted blazing chaotic light, seeping in from the cracks in the Palace of the Outer Gods. The form collapsed but the spirit was immortal. The Palace of the Outer Gods gathered the last of its divine power to fight back before it completely collapsed.</p>

    <p>After all, it is something from the ancient universe. This level of toughness is actually within Wang Ling's expectations.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling looked as calm as an ancient well.</p>

    <p>Because that's the last thing I want to do.</p>

    <p>At this moment, the Palace of the Outer Gods was completely dark, giving Wang Ling the illusion of being in darkness.</p>

    <p>And at this darkest moment, these thousands of thick tentacles quickly extended from the surroundings, carrying some kind of terrifying power of divine punishment.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling raised his hand. He caught a few of them in his hand, and pulled them out and cooked them. Then he pulled them off and roasted them. He fed them to the hungry Ah Nuan girl on his shoulder.</p>

    <p>The Tentacles of the End Hunter are not tasty. But these tentacles derived from the darkness with divine punishment effect. Wang Ling judge that the meat quality must be very good.</p>

    <p>Strength alone is not on the same level.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the meat must be high in protein and very chewy.</p>

    <p>Of course. The most important thing is that Wang Ling can feel the breath of the sea at the moment when these tentacles strike.</p>

    <p>He judged that this should be the divine punishment tentacle that the Outer God Palace separated from the sea of spiritual consciousness based on his own last will.</p>

    <p>The sea of spiritual consciousness. To put it bluntly, it is also a sea.</p>

    <p>Since it is seafood produced in the sea, it must have a salty taste.</p>

    <p>In fact Ah Nuan was very hungry.</p>

    <p>Even if the tentacles don't taste salty, she can still eat them.</p>

    <p>But now that it has a taste, it is naturally the icing on the cake.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is, she found out that her brother didn't lie to her. Because these divine punishment tentacles are really delicious! They are many times chewier than the tentacles of the Endgame Hunter!</p>

    <p>Ah Nuan girl can't describe the taste. But after Wang Ling tried it for a bit after grilling it, it felt a bit like cuttlefish noodles.</p>

    <p>It's the kind of scene that once appeared in gourmet animations. The chewy cuttlefish minced meat is stuffed into the noodles to increase the chewiness and texture.</p>

    <p>I have to say, the divine punishment tentacles have a magical texture that is soft and chewy. It is indeed a bit addictive.</p>

    <p>So far...</p>

    <p>The group of eternal warriors wrapped in the Corpse Map were once again stunned by the operations of Wang Ling and Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>These siblings are so scary.</p>

    <p>It sounds like they were born on Earth. But they don't look like Earthlings at all!</p>

    <p>Even the punishment trials at the Outer Shrine were not spared.</p>

    <p>In fact, it's not just the ancient warriors in the Corpse Map who are confused.</p>

    <p>The Tentacles of Divine Punishment that attacked Wang Ling and Wang Nuan were also a little confused.</p>

    <p>When the two Wang brothers and sisters began to swallow the tentacles into their stomachs, at this darkest moment, everything around them that was about to move fell silent...</p>

    <p>Divine Punishment Tentacle was stunned.</p>

    <p>They had just evolved. They were punished by the will of the alien gods. As a result, Wang Ling caught them by the tentacles. They cut them off, roasted them and ate them.</p>

    <p>This operation was so skilled that no one could understand it at all. So all the tentacles of divine punishment stopped their movements for a moment and fell into a state of temporary confusion.</p>

    <p>This...</p>

    <p>They are tentacles of divine punishment!</p>

    <p>Represents the will of the outer gods!</p>

    <p>Don't they...don't want to lose face?</p>

    <p>There is no doubt that Wang Ling's behavior is completely provocative.</p>

    <p>This is tarnishing the final divine punishment will of the Palace of the Outer Gods. It almost leaves no room for it.</p>

    <p>After a dead silence that lasted for more than ten seconds, Ah Nuan girl, who was addicted to eating, no longer maintained her image of a good baby and started to feast.</p>

    <p>One on the left hand and one on the right. There was a chewing sound coming out of the mouth. It sounded like the echo of a demon.</p>

    <p>At this point, the Palace of Outer Gods once again rioted.</p>

    <p>Who would have thought that a newly born baby girl could be so arrogant.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling. They can't be dealt with. But it seems that they can operate on this baby!</p>

    <p>As a result, more Tentacles of Divine Punishment, hundreds of thousands of them, surged out from the cracks near or far away. The troops divided into two groups and attacked Wang Ling and Wang Nuan.</p>

    <p>But at this moment, a shocking scene appeared.</p>

    <p>I saw the Ah Nuan girl who was happily eating the Tentacle of God's Punishment. Her body grew rapidly in a short period of time! Previously, when she ate a Tentacle of the End Hunter outside the Palace of the Outer Gods. Wang Ling Actually Just discovered this.</p>

    <p>At first I thought it was an illusion. But now it seems that he was indeed right...</p>

    <p>Ah Nuan girl's body is indeed getting bigger.</p>

    <p>But it's not that kind of growth. It's just a doubling of the current body.</p>

    <p>In less than a minute. Ah Nuan girl's infinite body grew to be more than 30 feet tall... She was still lying on the ground in the baby's crawling position. The milky scent from her body instantly filled the entire space. It then flowed out from the cracks of the Outer God's palace.</p>

    <p>"Is there excess energy..." Zhang Zhui was dumbfounded.</p>

    <p>As for the situation at hand. Wang Ling soon knew what happened.</p>

    <p>Because the current Ah Nuan girl, although she looks the same as Zhenren, is actually the incarnation of Ah Nuan girl's shadow. And the shadow can expand infinitely.</p>

    <p>When you take in too much energy, your body size will naturally increase indefinitely.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Outside the Palace of the Outer Gods. Fenmu Shen has already felt something strange in the palace.</p>

    <p>He could actually think that an outer god's palace might not be able to trap Wang Ling. His original purpose was to delay it. This way he would have enough time to complete the last step of resurrection.</p>

    <p>But what Fenmu Shen didn't expect was that the brother and sister would break through so quickly.</p>

    <p>What made him even more unexpected was that he actually saw a huge baby's chubby hand at this moment. With a bang, it directly pierced the outer god's palace. It stretched out from the top...</p>

    <p>Fenmu Shen, who is inheriting the power of the bloodline of "Outer God Sotos", is filled with surprise.</p>
