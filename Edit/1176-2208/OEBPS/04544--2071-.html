  <h1>Chapter 2071 A familiar friend</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: This was definitely not Zhang Zhui's deliberate attempt to get close. Instead, he really felt that the person in front of him looked familiar. And given his state of mind, he could not clearly see the half of his face hidden under the mask. Zhang Zhui almost thought of something very quickly. possibility.</p>

    <p>That is this person. There is a high probability that he is also an Eternal One.</p>

    <p>Eternals have a mutual attraction to each other. And currently, it seems that the average level of cultivators on the earth is not that high. In fact, it is easy to tell whether the other person is an Eternal.</p>

    <p>No matter how well you hide your aura, there will still be flaws in it.</p>

    <p>When Zhang Zhui was originally trapped in the Supreme Corpse Map, he thought that all the Eternals had been captured by Dao Ancestor Wang. As a result, more and more cases later proved that some of the Eternals managed to escape by chance. Seal the Corpse Map of Dao Ancestor.</p>

    <p>For example, the three Eternals who had previously surrendered to the Holy Clan. The Lion-headed Man of the Lion Clan, Meng Liuli of the Dream Clan, and the Skeleton King, the prince of the Undead. All three of them have royal blood. After losing their protection, they had to rely on The slightly stronger saint races in the universe are just surviving.</p>

    <p>But now, they have all been recruited by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>According to common sense, a normal person would definitely feel disgusted by such a shameless approach like Zhang Zhui. But the young man in front of him showed an unusual calmness.</p>

    <p>Usually, the more this is the case, the more it illustrates the problem.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui became somewhat interested in the person in front of him. He crossed his arms and said with a smile: "In the world of cultivation, the old are respected and the young are respected. You really don't know any etiquette."</p>

    <p>"The moon spirit is in danger."</p>

    <p>After a long while, he opened his mouth without raising his eyes, directly introduced himself to his family, and said his name.</p>

    <p>After a pause, he added: "I'm just a passerby here to join in the fun. I have nothing to do with the two dying men next to me."</p>

    <p>Puff!</p>

    <p>The words came out in a shocking way. There were people around who were drinking water. They sprayed it out in one gulp.</p>

    <p>In fact, anyone who has made some achievements in cultivation can see that the end of these two people is approaching. They are eager to break through, so they plan to hug the leg of a certain boss and break into the legendary restricted sea area to seek immortal fate.</p>

    <p>But to say directly to their faces that these two people are about to die is a bit unflattering.</p>

    <p>For Daxian monks, such words are undoubtedly a taboo. Therefore, even if many people know it in their hearts, they will not say it directly in front of so many people.</p>

    <p>Seeing through can't be revealed. This is also one of the rules for survival in the world of cultivation...</p>

    <p>The two monks were meditating well at first, but they were stunned by Yue Lingwei's words.</p>

    <p>You can see that the corners of their mouths and eyes are twitching violently. They seem to be ready to take action at any time.</p>

    <p>But in the end, the two of them endured it.</p>

    <p>They didn't know Yue Lingwei, and they had never heard of such a person in the casual cultivator world. However, this person had a reserved aura. It was not easy to provoke them, as they both had a clear conscience.</p>

    <p>The closer the deadline is, the more calm you have to be. Otherwise, the deadline may come early before you can break through. This is an act that outweighs the gains and losses.</p>

    <p>A small fluctuation caused almost all eyes on Yama Island to focus on the direction of Zhang Zhui and Yue Lingwei.</p>

    <p>Originally, many of the people who gathered on the island today were busybodies who loved to join in the fun. Everyone thought that there would be a fight before the legendary sword master arrived. But it turned out that the two monks who were approaching their end of life chose not to take action. Then there were looks of disappointment on their faces.</p>

    <p>"Hey, I don't dare to do it. It's so boring now. I would have to start doing it in a minute." Someone said.</p>

    <p>In the harmonious society of modern cultivation, monks must of course abide by the rule of law. They cannot take action directly. If they start a fight on the street, they will be punished directly for the crime of picking quarrels and provoking trouble.</p>

    <p>But this is Yama Island. It is just in front of the restricted sea area. This place and the restricted sea area in front are areas that do not belong to any cultivation country. Even if you fight here, no one will capture you.</p>

    <p>Therefore, in everyone's opinion, there is only one reason for not taking action. That is cowardice.</p>

    <p>After waiting boredly on the island for most of the day, Zhang Zhui found that more and more idle monks from the surrounding major cultivation countries had gathered here.</p>

    <p>He had not felt it when he lived in the Huaxiu country. Now that he had witnessed it with his own eyes, he was surprised by the influence of this sword master.</p>

    <p>It's truly amazing. And a little bit beyond expectations.</p>

    <p>It is not surprising that a person has made great achievements in his own cultivation country. But if he is famous in cultivation countries around the world, this shows the prestige of this person in the current cultivation world.</p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>On the sea level in the distance. With the afterglow of the setting sun, the distant sea line was burned red. Along with the rolling waves, an old man wearing a white training suit and a trademark red belt stepped on the huge waves. Come.</p>

    <p>It's the Sword Master!</p>

    <p>Someone immediately exclaimed.</p>

    <p>This proves that the rumors are true. Otherwise, how could the Sword Master appear at the entrance to the restricted sea area without any reason?</p>

    <p>At the same time, many people have focused their attention on Yi Jianchuan. The reputation of the Sword Master is well-known. There have been rumors of recruiting true disciples for a long time. As a result, the rumors were broken. Now it is the Sword Master's own strength. Tell the world. Show in front of the media that you have found a true disciple.</p>

    <p>Therefore, many people are curious and want to see the true face of this true disciple.</p>

    <p>You can see that just above the giant waves Yi Jianchuan is stepping on, there is a huge water polo behind him.</p>

    <p>"It's a disciple of the Sword Master. He's inside!"</p>

    <p>On Yama Island. At this moment, all the casual cultivators gathered were as excited as if they had been given a shot of chicken blood.</p>

    <p>Only Zhang Zhui, Yue Lingwei and the two casual cultivators whose deadlines were approaching remained calm.</p>

    <p>None of the four of them took action. They didn't even look in the direction where the Sword Master came from on the waves.</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui felt this was strange from the beginning.</p>

    <p>Although his mission was to go to the restricted sea area to find the missing Maiko Assi, he took a long detour because he failed to pass customs. So he arrived at the entrance of the restricted sea area at about the same time as Sword Master and Wang Muyu.</p>

    <p>But because he is from the Office of Strategic Deception, Zhang Zhui knows the situation with Wang Muyu very well.</p>

    <p>The Sword Master just released the news that he had accepted a true disciple. www.uukanshu.net did not mention who this person was, let alone any subsequent training plans.</p>

    <p>So how do the group of people gathered on Yama Island now know?</p>

    <p>Who leaked the news behind the scenes? And it was precisely because Zhang Zhui felt something was fishy that he didn't rush to the sea restricted area to find Maiko Assi.</p>

    <p>Protecting Wang Muyu was more important to Zhang Zhui than that of Maiko Assi. So Zhang Zhui decided to stay here the moment he felt something fishy after arriving on the island.</p>

    <p>He had to wait and see. At least he had to cover the entrance of Juggernaut and Wang Muyu in full public view.</p>

    <p>"Kill!"</p>

    <p>Just as he was thinking, some of the people watching the fun on the island finally couldn't hide themselves. These people were organized and had plans. They were just waiting for the moment when the Sword Master arrived to reveal their sinister look!</p>

    <p>One after another, they transformed into streams of light and shot out from the island. Their targets were directly at Yi Jianchuan and Wang Muyu!</p>
