  <h1>Chapter 1429 The Chess Game of the Infinite Galaxy</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The unprecedented Sword Conference ended with the victory of Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>For the four judges, Jiu You, Yu Ling, Mo Yu and Xiao Qian, this result is no surprise because it is the result that was determined by default.</p>

    <p>However, for the Sword Spirits who were watching, this ending obviously surprised them.</p>

    <p>And the most important thing is that at the end of the game, Lao K's sword gambling actually added extra authenticity to this King's Group Stage.</p>

    <p>Because there is uncertainty in the gambling itself.</p>

    <p>What if Lao K really draws blue sword energy or golden sword energy? Maybe he can make a comeback?</p>

    <p>Before the game of the King Group ended, Liang Feng gave Sun Rong a vicious look. The anger surging out of his eyes seemed to be an expression of sworn hatred: "Humph! I was just injured and needed treatment. Those who abstained from voting are not doing so deliberately because they have a good impression of you!"</p>

    <p>"So. Do you still feel any pain?" Sun Rong laughed. As early as on the playing field, Liang Feng's injuries had been fully recovered by Aohai's sword energy. In fact, they were not very serious.</p>

    <p>"I want you to be a widow!" Liang Feng blushed. He rolled his eyes and left in a hurry.</p>

    <p>She is ranked 16th on the sword list. She also wants to save face!</p>

    <p>Until this moment.</p>

    <p>No one would have thought that a chaos would begin...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong watched Liang Feng leave from the passage.</p>

    <p>This female sword spirit made her feel unforgettable.</p>

    <p>Although I say no, my body is very honest.</p>

    <p>This is Sun Rong's evaluation of Liang Feng.</p>

    <p>Her arrogant personality makes Sun Rong feel very cute.</p>

    <p>She watched Liang Feng all the way to the entrance of the passage. She watched Liang Feng gradually disappear into the passage. At this moment, there was a shocking vibration on the ground.</p>

    <p>"Is this...an earthquake?"</p>

    <p>Sun Rong frowned.</p>

    <p>I sensed that something seemed wrong.</p>

    <p>It's the pressure from the sky!</p>

    <p>Caught off guard. Sun Rong raised his head. He suddenly felt that there was an extremely evil force penetrating into the endless and deep universe.</p>

    <p>This force is like a knife. It ruthlessly cuts through the blade storm of the Sword King Realm. Then it falls densely from the sky!</p>

    <p>Countless sword spirits in the audience were shocked by this sudden overturning force.</p>

    <p>Bang!</p>

    <p>The defensive sword barrier formed by Jiu You and others was shattered as easily as glass under this overwhelming pressure!</p>

    <p>"What on earth is going on..." Yu Ling frowned deeply. This pressure was so amazing.</p>

    <p>Even with her fighting power ranked among the top three in the sword list, it was still a bit unbearable. She felt like something was strangling her throat. Even breathing became extremely difficult.</p>

    <p>"What..." Mo Yu was shocked by the pressure. The jade crown on her head changed color according to her emotions. It turned into a frightened purple color.</p>

    <p>Next to them, the expressions of Jiu You and Xiao Qian also changed suddenly.</p>

    <p>This sudden and inexplicable power made them overwhelmed. The entire old sword city and the sword spirits in the entire Sword King Realm began to panic!</p>

    <p>An invisible creature falls from the sky like rain. It is impossible to tell what it is. Only under the illumination of light, its entire body will appear in seven colors.</p>

    <p>Their bodies are transparent, like glass. After falling on the ground, they begin to squirm regularly.</p>

    <p>"What the hell is that?"</p>

    <p>"Like a bug!"</p>

    <p>"Where did the bugs come from..."</p>

    <p>Discussed by Jiu You et al.</p>

    <p>They differentiated their sword energy. The first reaction was to kill these bugs!</p>

    <p>However, when their sword energy swept across these colorful insects, all the sword energy was absorbed by these insects!</p>

    <p>Then they started to grow. From a body the size of a grain of rice, they quickly grew to the size of a child.</p>

    <p>In the inn. Wang Ling looked at this scene.</p>

    <p>There is no wave in my heart.</p>

    <p>The man from the infinite galaxy. Finally lost...</p>

    <p>"What on earth is this?" This smell was inexplicably dangerous. It made Er Ha feel uncomfortable all over.</p>

    <p>Its fur was blown out. It quickly came to Wang Ling from Sun Rong's room.</p>

    <p>"It's unmistakable. This is a strange creature born from chaos. It comes from the infinite galaxy." Wang Ying said.</p>

    <p>Such chaotic creatures have never been seen in the outer galaxy.</p>

    <p>This is a seven-color insect. When it is young, it is only the size of a grain of rice. In the first stage of growth, it is as big as a child.</p>

    <p>At the beginning of the first stage, there is the ability to "hug the face." It will completely drain out the spiritual energy in the body of the person hugging the face.</p>

    <p>They use energy as support and can devour spiritual power. As long as they contain spiritual power, they will be like the group of piranhas in tropical rivers that swarm up when they encounter meat. They will be eaten up in an instant.</p>

    <p>"It seems that the other party's purpose is not only to target Leng Ming and Miss Sun. They even want to destroy the Sword King Realm." Wang Ying frowned slightly.</p>

    <p>This is no longer an enemy that Sun Rong can deal with.</p>

    <p>Now it has to "change hands."</p>

    <p>Fortunately. Wang Ling has already made arrangements here.</p>

    <p>In the sword arena. When these Chaos Facehuggers absorb sword energy from a state the size of rice grains and evolve into adults.</p>

    <p>A snow-colored figure also arrived immediately.</p>

    <p>"Go back!"</p>

    <p>A young man wearing a snow-white fur coat came here. He withstood all the pressure by himself.</p>

    <p>The brown sword energy swept across the scene. Although these facehuggers devoured psychic energy, their capacity was limited when they had not developed into a complete body. They exploded on the ground one after another.</p>

    <p>The seven-colored liquid was like an eyeball that had been stepped on and exploded. It was flowing all over the ground.</p>

    <p>"It's Master Jingbai! Master Jingke and Master Bai Qiao have merged!"</p>

    <p>Some sword spirits screamed excitedly.</p>

    <p>They rarely even see Jingke on weekdays.</p>

    <p>At this moment, I was shocked.</p>

    <p>It almost feels like a dream!</p>

    <p>"grown ups!"</p>

    <p>The pressure dissipated. Jiu You and others took the initiative to come forward and bow.</p>

    <p>"Listen to my order. All the top 10,000 sword spirits on the sword list are dispatched! Eliminate the incoming enemies! No need to hold back. Use all your strength! When they grow to the first stage, they cannot swallow so much energy! The other sword spirits converge their swords Don't let it become the nourishment for these facehuggers!" Jingbai ordered.</p>

    <p>"Yes! Sir!" Jiu You agreed.</p>

    <p>This matter must call on the Sword King World to unite. And the key to the confrontation is that these bugs must not be allowed to develop into adults...</p>

    <p>The first and second stages after the larvae can be dealt with. But if it develops into the third stage, it will be difficult to deal with.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>When Sun Rong opened her eyes again, she found herself in a brand new place.</p>

    <p>"School at night?"</p>

    <p>The girl looked at the scene in front of her in surprise. She was shocked to find that this place seemed to be the Number 60 High School that she knew well.</p>

    <p>She released Aohai's sword energy. As a result, she found that the world she was in was vast and boundless, with no boundaries at all.</p>

    <p>This is a world shrouded in night...</p>

    <p>At this time, Wang Ying's figure appeared here: "The defensive seeds I planted on Ying'er before have worked. Once there is danger, you will be sent here together."</p>

    <p>"So here is..."</p>

    <p>"Don't you know where you are yet?" Wang Ying said with a smile.</p>

    <p>What a silly girl.</p>

    <p>"It looks like a place similar to the core world..." Sun Rong said.</p>

    <p>"It's not like this. It's the core world."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying nodded. Looking at Sun Rong: "You are now in the core world of the Lord..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "This is...the core world of classmate Wang Ling!?"</p>

    <p>At this time, he looked at the surprised face of the girl in front of him.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying suddenly felt a little emotional.</p>

    <p>Unknowingly, you have become his world.</p>

    <p>And now, I'm just waiting for the day when this sealed twilight is broken through by light...</p>
