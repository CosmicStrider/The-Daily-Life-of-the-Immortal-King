  <h1>Chapter 1337 The Desperate Earth Spirit</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Wang Ying grabbed Sun Ying'er's wrist tightly and began to carry out crazy destruction in the depths west of the extraterrestrial galaxy. No less than a hundred planets were destroyed.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er felt like a three-dimensional pinball that kept jumping up and down. The impact made her whole body feel bad.</p>

    <p>"Don't...don't do this to me..."</p>

    <p>He didn't know how long it took.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er felt like her tears were almost dry.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying then calmed down slightly.</p>

    <p>And it wasn't until this time that Sun Ying'er discovered how perverted Wang Ying was...</p>

    <p>It turned out that the harder she cried, the more excited Wang Ying became!</p>

    <p>Therefore, when Sun Ying'er discovered this, he simply shut up and did not dare to let out any more sobs.</p>

    <p>"Aren't you crying? Keep crying." Wang Ying sneered.</p>

    <p>His hand was holding on to Sun Ying'er. It wasn't that he was afraid that Sun Ying'er would run away, but that he thought Sun Ying'er was too fun and couldn't bear to let go.</p>

    <p>"I won't cry anymore. Really..." Sun Ying'er pretended to hold back.</p>

    <p>She knows how to deal with perverts like Wang Zhen.</p>

    <p>The best way is to pretend to compromise first, and then wait for an opportunity to escape.</p>

    <p>However, Wang Ying's abnormality was beyond Sun Ying'er's imagination.</p>

    <p>I saw Wang Ying looking at her coldly: "Take off your clothes."</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er became frightened again: "You...what are you going to do..."</p>

    <p>"I'm afraid you'll run away. But as long as you're naked, you should be honest. Don't worry, I'm a gentleman. I promise I won't look at you."</p>

    <p>"Become...perverted..."</p>

    <p>"All right."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying shrugged. He had actually expected this answer.</p>

    <p>"Then. Let's continue."</p>

    <p>"You..." Sun Ying'er knew that he had been fooled again.</p>

    <p>However, before she could curse, Wang Ying launched her {Planet thumping technique} again..</p>

    <p>That day. Deep in the western part of the extraterrestrial galaxy. Sun Ying'er's screams of "Ahhhh" came and went...</p>

    <p>The spirits of nearby planets that were not harmed were all silent and trembling about this incident.</p>

    <p>For a long time to come, no planet spirit was willing to mention this matter again.</p>

    <p>And Wang Ying also developed a new word through his own efforts.</p>

    <p>Name: Ball Shock...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>An unspeakable place.</p>

    <p>After the monk's palm fell, along with the destruction of the core temple, the space began to show signs of collapse.</p>

    <p>The original Heavenly Dao was trapped in the reincarnation of death. The unspeakable land has fallen into a state of collapse.</p>

    <p>Even if Wang Ling doesn't take action.</p>

    <p>In a few days, this place can be disintegrated naturally.</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect that this world founded by Dao Ancestor Wang would end up with a poor monk..." The monk had a complicated mood.</p>

    <p>Of course. The main thing is that Ling Zhenren is stronger.</p>

    <p>The power of this 100% enlightenment technique increased the power of his only 10% palm power to the point of destroying the world.</p>

    <p>This is something that Monk Jin Deng could not have imagined.</p>

    <p>The unspeakable land was destroyed. This means that the girl's soul will no longer be affected.</p>

    <p>And Sun Ying'er was suppressed by Wang Ying. When the Lord of the Void was controlled, Sun Rong naturally could not return to the Void.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er is like the host of this void return ceremony.</p>

    <p>Now the host has been dragged away to receive "training." Naturally, the ceremony cannot continue.</p>

    <p>Of course. For Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>He felt that the matter was not completely over.</p>

    <p>This "fortune teller."</p>

    <p>He still hasn't found it.</p>

    <p>This is the mastermind behind everything.</p>

    <p>"Zhenren, look!"</p>

    <p>At this time, the monk's eyes suddenly pointed somewhere ahead.</p>

    <p>This is the core temple of the Unspeakable Land.</p>

    <p>A location that suffered annihilation.</p>

    <p>The space there has been completely shattered.</p>

    <p>The entire core temple was destroyed and turned into dust particles swirling in the universe.</p>

    <p>However, in the center of the annihilation, there is a luminous object. It shines like a night pearl in the darkness.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling reached out and introduced this luminous object into the palm of his hand.</p>

    <p>This is a palm-sized hexahedron Rubik's cube.</p>

    <p>Has extremely high temperatures.</p>

    <p>The whole body exudes powerful and dense spiritual energy.</p>

    <p>This is no ordinary thing.</p>

    <p>If a normal cultivator holds it in his hand, the whole hand will be blown up by the magic power of the Rubik's Cube.</p>

    <p>"It should be a stable magic weapon that moves the core world to the outside." Although the monk didn't know the origin of the Rubik's Cube, he still made a judgment based on his own experience.</p>

    <p>They finally found the secret that kept the core world alive for a long time after Dao Ancestor Wang moved it to the outside world!</p>

    <p>In addition to Dao Ancestor Wang's own understanding of the power of law.</p>

    <p>This stabilizing magic weapon also played a vital role.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling Hold the Rubik's Cube in the palm of your hand. Use a little force.</p>

    <p>It turned out that the Rubik's Cube actually generated a huge force to fight against him.</p>

    <p>This kind of spiritual power is astonishing. Wang Ling is rarely seen on other magical weapons.</p>

    <p>Even Jingke doesn't have such huge spiritual power.</p>

    <p>If it is the shock after the combination.</p>

    <p>It's quite comparable to it.</p>

    <p>Could it be that this Rubik's Cube comes from the same hometown as Jingke and Bai Qiao?</p>

    <p>Wang Ling holds the Rubik's Cube. Thoughtfully.</p>

    <p>This is an important discovery.</p>

    <p>He carefully put the Rubik's Cube into the space of King's Eyes.</p>

    <p>Before leaving. Wang Ling suddenly thought of something.</p>

    <p>He took one last look at the collapsing Unspeakable Land.</p>

    <p>"What is Ling Zhenren looking at?" the monk was curious.</p>

    <p>"Crack."Wang Ling replied. Concisely and to the point.</p>

    <p>Yes...</p>

    <p>He is observing the cracks in the outer layer of the Unspeakable Land.</p>

    <p>Because the evil Golden Men who escaped and came to the earth flowed out from this crack.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling wants to see the cause of this crack.</p>

    <p>Did the evil Golden Men tear it apart themselves? Or did the others do it on purpose?</p>

    <p>This is the result.</p>

    <p>Let Wang Ling be stunned on the spot.</p>

    <p>"Who caused the crack?" the monk asked.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling was silent for a while. He did not directly answer the monk's words.</p>

    <p>In the end, I only replied with two words: "Accident."</p>

    <p>Monk: "?"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>A few seconds later. Wang Ling and the monk returned to Earth smoothly.</p>

    <p>But they didn't go in directly. They were in the outer space of the earth.</p>

    <p>The monk saw Wang Ling raising his hand. He seemed to be preparing to attack the earth: "Ling Zhenren, what are you..."</p>

    <p>"5% Targeted Global Amnesia." Wang Ling answered.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er made things too big.</p>

    <p>This memory. Except for the core members of the Office of Strategic Deception, the memories of everyone must be wiped. Sun Rong will not be in trouble.</p>

    <p>Sun Ying'er is exactly the same as Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>Although the conspiracy to return to the void did not succeed in the end.</p>

    <p>But the whole thing has already begun to ferment on the earth.</p>

    <p>Out of helplessness.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling had no choice but to make this decision.</p>

    <p>Anyway, the earth has been upgraded.</p>

    <p>His palm used only 5% of his power to hit the ocean part.</p>

    <p>Apart from the pain, it will never have any adverse effects on the earth.</p>

    <p>The earth spirit was terrified.</p>

    <p>He saw Wang Ling raise his hand. He quickly screamed: "Zhenren, calm down! Take your palm back quickly! I can cast a spell. Help Zhenren make people around the world lose their memory!"</p>

    <p>If I didn't tell you earlier...</p>

    <p>Wang Ling rolled his eyes at the Earth Spirit.</p>

    <p>His palm is already on the way.</p>

    <p>It was obviously difficult to regain the strength of the palm.</p>

    <p>So, he had no choice but to say four words with regret to the spirit of the earth: "Definitely next time!"</p>

    <p>Earth Spirit: "..."</p>

    <p>2 seconds later.</p>

    <p>The spirit of the earth screamed like a slaughtering pig, resounding throughout the entire galaxy...</p>
