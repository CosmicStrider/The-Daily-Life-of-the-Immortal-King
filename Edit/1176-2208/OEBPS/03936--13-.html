  <h1>Sun Rong and Wang Nuan} Extra 13: Wang Ling What does it cost to be friends?</h1>

  <div>

    <p>When Sun Rong rested his head on Wang Ling's lap, Father Wang and Mother Wang were "forced to take a drive."</p>

    <p>The off-road vehicle Father Wang drives was bought by Wang Ling in his senior year of high school. The outer shell was enlightened by Wang Ling. It is indestructible and once saved the world.</p>

    <p>Anyway, there is almost no thing on earth that can smash Father Wang's black off-road vehicle into pieces. It can remain intact even under a nuclear warhead.</p>

    <p>The couple finished shopping for groceries. It was actually quite early.</p>

    <p>As she was about to return to the villa, Mother Wang began to look at the surveillance probe at home. In fact, this surveillance probe was not surveillance in the strict sense. It just had the function of surveillance at the same time.</p>

    <p>Essentially, this is just a stabilizing device used to remotely control "Eternal Talisman." It is used to absorb the special radiation released by Eternal Talisman.</p>

    <p>Father Wang and Mother Wang are ordinary people after all. The main component of Eternal Talisman is the "black stone" with powerful radioactive material discovered by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>After the black stone was refined by Wang Ming and used to create "Eternal Talisman", although the radioactive material was reduced, it still existed.</p>

    <p>So in order to completely eliminate this influence, Wang Ming developed a stabilizer that can absorb this radioactive material. It was installed on the ceiling of the first floor of the Wang family's villa.</p>

    <p>And because this stabilizing device is connected to the satellite at the same time, it also has a monitoring function...</p>

    <p>"I found that you became very gossipy after giving birth to Ah Nuan girl." Father Wang was driving. He looked straight ahead and criticized Mother Wang for her gossipy heart.</p>

    <p>He didn't know if it's because of my age. Mother Wang does know that she seems to be a bit gossipy.</p>

    <p>She knew it was wrong to do so, but she just couldn't help it. She couldn't help but roll her eyes.</p>

    <p>Of course. With this burning heart of gossip, Mother Wang would naturally have no interest if Wang Ling was alone at home.</p>

    <p>Only when Sun Rong comes to their home as a guest and are alone with Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Wang Ma's spirit of gossip was completely on fire.</p>

    <p>"What are Ling Ling and Rongrong doing?" Father Wang asked.</p>

    <p>Although he criticized Mother Wang's gossip and refused to watch the surveillance with Mother Wang, Father Wang still asked questions honestly.</p>

    <p>"Ling Ling is awake. Rongrong has cooked porridge for him. Good girl..." Mother Wang looked at the surveillance camera and was a little moved.</p>

    <p>"Already drinking? Are there any comments or anything like that?"</p>

    <p>"The voice was too low. I couldn't hear clearly." Mother Wang frowned. Then she looked at Father Wang and said, "Are you almost home?"</p>

    <p>"Yes." Father Wang nodded.</p>

    <p>"Why are you driving so fast...drive slower! It's hard for the two children to have a chance to be alone together!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang held the steering wheel and smiled bitterly: "Don't we have to rush back to make lunch? It's only after nine o'clock."</p>

    <p>"No! It's too early! We can't just go back!" Mother Wang said, shaking her head.</p>

    <p>"Then how many more detours are there?"</p>

    <p>"Well, drive slowly. Let Ling Ling drink the porridge that Rongrong cooked first."</p>

    <p>"good."</p>

    <p>Father Wang nodded.</p>

    <p>That's it. The couple reached a unanimous consensus on the matter.</p>

    <p>It's almost eleven o'clock...</p>

    <p>In the car, Mother Wang suddenly burst out laughing: "Wow! Rongrong rested his head on Ling Ling's lap!"</p>

    <p>"Are you envious? If you lean back, I will lean on you." Father Wang smiled.</p>

    <p>"Who cares about your old arms and legs?" Mother Wang stared at the monitor intently. Her face was also slightly red, with a sweet smile.</p>

    <p>"Mom, we're almost home. We seemed to have traveled hundreds of kilometers just now..."</p>

    <p>"Wait a moment. Rongrong is attacking fiercely now. It's better not to disturb her."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang suddenly had a bad feeling.</p>

    <p>Mother Wang: "How about you go around a few more times?"</p>

    <p>Father Wang: "..."</p>

    <p>He finally discovered that today's meal is inedible...</p>

    <p>He sighed silently in his heart. Father Wang turned the car around.</p>

    <p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

    <p>"Add some oil..."</p>

    <p>Father Wang couldn't laugh or cry in his heart.</p>

    <p>He thought their family seemed a bit strange.</p>

    <p>Children from other families talk about friends. When a parent wraps up a red envelope, it is always meaningful. It costs money.</p>

    <p>Their Wang Ling home is good. It wastes gas...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong went back after lunch. Father Wang and Mother Wang wanted to keep the girl for dinner. However, Sun Rong seemed to have something to do. After lunch, they helped clear the table together. Left in a hurry.</p>

    <p>"What a wonderful girl." Mother Wang couldn't help but sigh at the back of Sun Rong, who was walking away with the spirit sword.</p>

    <p>This was actually said to Wang Ling on purpose.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling came back to his senses and glanced at Mother Wang. He was sitting on the sofa, looking at the TV with a blank expression. There was an inexplicable feeling of emptiness in his heart.</p>

    <p>"Ling Ling." At this time, Mother Wang came towards him with a smile on her face. With just one look, she drove Father Wang away from the sofa.</p>

    <p>Family status. Obviously.</p>

    <p>Then, Mother Wang sat down directly. Then she followed Sun Rong and fell on Wang Ling's lap. She sighed with satisfaction on her face: "Don't tell me, it's quite comfortable. Our home Ling Ling's legs don't look like they have a lot of flesh, but they are very firm. They feel more comfortable than those memory foam pillows."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>"Really or not. Can you give me a try?" Father Wang suddenly felt excited and wanted to try it too.</p>

    <p>"Wait. Let me lie down for a while." Mother Wang yawned. She was lying on the ground feeling slightly sleepy.</p>

    <p>"Is it that comfortable..." Father Wang questioned.</p>

    <p>He stared at Mother Wang's left leg lying on it, feeling envious in his heart.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling held his forehead. He looked at Father Wang and pointed at his other leg: "You actually don't need to grab it..."</p>

    <p>As a result, at this time, the couple refused in unison: "No! We only want the right leg!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "?"</p>

    <p>Mother Wang laughed: "The left leg belongs to Miss Rong. We don't dare to have it."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Thinking of the weight left by the girl sitting on his lap, Wang Ling's face suddenly became rosy again.</p>

    <p>He didn't expect that he would be "molested" by his own father and mother.</p>

    <p>Then it was like this until about ten o'clock in the evening. Wang Ling was still sitting alone on the sofa in a daze. Although his face seemed expressionless, something seemed wrong about his face.</p>

    <p>"It's a bit strange, the child's father..."</p>

    <p>Mother Wang put on the facial mask and looked at Wang Ling who seemed to be in a daze.</p>

    <p>In Mother Wang's memory, she rarely saw Wang Ling behave like this. It was as if the computer suddenly crashed...</p>

    <p>Although provenance Wang Mu-tou has always been provenance Wang Mu-tou. But normally, even if he's a log. It's not like he's not moving at all.</p>

    <p>Take watching TV as an example. Wang Ling watching TV without eating crispy noodles is outrageous.</p>

    <p>"It's a bit strange." Father Wang also felt that there was something wrong with this smell.</p>

    <p>It seems that they have entered this daze mode since they "molested" each other.</p>

    <p>"Is there something wrong with Fu?" Mother Wang was worried.</p>

    <p>"Don't be nervous. I'm going to call Xiao Ming and ask him what's going on..."</p>

    <p>...</p>
