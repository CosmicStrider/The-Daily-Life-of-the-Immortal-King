  <h1>Chapter 1606 Zhuo Yi's Thoughts</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The issue of "age" has always been a thorn in Jiugong Liangzi's heart. Especially after Jiugong Liangzi found out that he really fell in love with Zhuo Yi, the guilt in his heart became even stronger.</p>

    <p>She was obviously entrusted by her family to come to Huaxiu to investigate information about this old liar. She wanted to take advantage of this wave of anti-counterfeiting to expand the Jiugong family's market in Huaxiu.</p>

    <p>It turned out that because of his age, Jiugong Liangzi felt that he was not qualified to scold Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>She is also a liar.</p>

    <p>It was only now that the matter was told that she felt much more at ease...</p>

    <p>The two of them stayed in the bedroom for a long time. They both felt a great sense of satisfaction. This had already been revealed. Jiugong Liangzi did not hold himself back any longer. The girl lowered her guard and let Zhuo Yi Then hold it.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi always disliked the heat when Zhuo Yi hugged him.</p>

    <p>But now he didn't say even a word.</p>

    <p>"Do you want to continue playing the game?"</p>

    <p>After a while, Jiugong Liangzi suddenly said: "The game of exchanging secrets..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi responded calmly: "Okay."</p>

    <p>The girl thought that Zhuo Yi would refuse. She didn't expect that he would be so straightforward.</p>

    <p>"You first and me first?" Zhuo Yi laughed. He deliberately brought his face very close. With a gangster look: "Then. I'll get better first. My secret is that I actually have a master."</p>

    <p>"Do you really have a master?" Jiugong Liangzi was shocked.</p>

    <p>There have been rumors outside that Zhuo Yi had a master. Many people even said that the reason why Zhuo Yi became a fighting hero six years ago was because of the help of the master behind him.</p>

    <p>But until now, no one has seen the true appearance of Master Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Many people conceive Zhuo Yi's master as an immortal old Taoist priest. There is even a variety show specifically focusing on this matter that launched a long-term follow-up investigation on Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>However, the investigation found that Zhuo Yi's work route is actually very stable. Except for the Headquarters of 100 Schools, his own apartment and going to some schools for official reasons, there is no other abnormal behavior.</p>

    <p>What an immortal old Taoist priest...</p>

    <p>Not even a hair of this legendary master was visible.</p>

    <p>The ones who appear the most around Zhuo Yi are the students who are gathered around asking for autographs.</p>

    <p>All of them are wearing oversized school uniforms, with fluffy hair... their faces are full of collagen and childishness. There is no way they look like Master Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Then many people focused on the principals of some schools...</p>

    <p>For example, Principal Chen of Number 60 High School was once suspected to be Zhuo Yi's master.</p>

    <p>But after being suspected, these principals also clarified themselves in public media occasions. They even used something like a big oath...</p>

    <p>In front of a national audience. No one would joke about this.</p>

    <p>"They say your master is an immortal Taoist priest. Isn't that right?" Jiugong Liangzi asked.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi gently pinched Jiugong Liangzi's nose: "It's agreed. Each person will tell one. No further questions. It's your turn."</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi showed a helpless expression.</p>

    <p>She sighed and said: "Okay... let me tell you a secret. In fact, my development is a bit delayed..."</p>

    <p>"..." Zhuo Yi glanced at the flat airport in Jiugong Liangzi. The expression on his face remained unchanged.</p>

    <p>He had already seen it.</p>

    <p>But the problem is. He thinks this is all obvious...</p>

    <p>"Liangzi... you are too cunning. Can this be considered a secret?"</p>

    <p>"Of course! Why doesn't it count?" Jiugong Liangzi said with great difficulty: "I said my development is delayed. It means there is no possibility of growth in the future!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi was speechless with one sentence.</p>

    <p>He didn't say much. He just held Jiugong Liangzi in his arms.</p>

    <p>To like someone. Of course, to like everything about a person.</p>

    <p>Not to mention that Jiugong Liangzi is an airport now. He would also like it even if it is the Mariana Trench.</p>

    <p>And Zhuo Yi himself doesn't have much favorable impressions of girls who are particularly well-developed.</p>

    <p>She's still pretty cute. "Liangzi. I don't mind this at all." He hugged the girl tightly. These successive confessions had a strong impact, making Jiugong Liangzi's mind go blank.</p>

    <p>She felt that this might be the unique personality charm conveyed by Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi is a courageous person. He takes action when it is time to take action. And he will never hesitate at all.</p>

    <p>Facing the world six years ago, Jiugong Liangzi had always had doubts.</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi is just a Golden Core monk. Why is he so brave to rush to the front...</p>

    <p>Now. Jiugong Liangzi started to understand a little bit after learning about Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>This is a man who will never look back once he's determined.</p>

    <p>"No more fun... you are the most cunning person." Jiugong Liangzi slapped his red face. He looked at Zhuo Yi and asked: "I have one last question left..."</p>

    <p>"You want to ask about classmate Sun Rong, right?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. I don't even know how to thank her. Our Jiugong family's matter can be solved smoothly this time. It all depends on her." Jiugong Liangzi said.</p>

    <p>After this incident, the conflict between her and Jiugong Xiushi has been completely mediated.</p>

    <p>As for the sixth lady who was possessed by a ghost, she is currently undergoing treatment to remove the ghost.</p>

    <p>"Your father didn't separate from her?"</p>

    <p>"After all these years, we still have feelings. And Zhai Xing Group also has a certain scale on Sun Island. For the sake of stabilizing the situation, even if my father has this idea, it cannot be made public for the time being."</p>

    <p>"so it is."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi touched his chin.</p>

    <p>In fact, he was also making insinuations about his future father-in-law's preferences.</p>

    <p>Judging from this time, Jiugong Akagi is still a kind and righteous person... Although he married six wives, at least with this burden, he can even bear the rain and dew, and he can hold a bowl of water levelly.</p>

    <p>And he really cares about every one of his family members.</p>

    <p>As long as he can show some sincerity in the future, he doesn't think the problem is too big.</p>

    <p>He found that he liked Jiugong Liangzi even more than he thought.</p>

    <p>Especially now when I hold her in my arms.</p>

    <p>He felt like he owned the whole world...</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Monday, December 21st.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High School's group returned to Huaxiu country smoothly</p>

    <p>During this trip, Wang Ming collected a bunch of new clues about Talisman and deduced new data.</p>

    <p>As soon as we landed, Zhai Yin and I rushed to the laboratory without stopping.</p>

    <p>And he followed up.</p>

    <p>I am also going to meet the citizen scientist "Shou Chong."</p>

    <p>As for Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>As soon as Wang Ling landed, he came directly to pick him up.</p>

    <p>Taking over from the master is what a disciple should do.</p>

    <p>Of course. He still has some selfish motives...</p>

    <p>That's the question about Zhou Ziyi.</p>

    <p>"Master... do you... want a disciple? Someone who can work as a tool and make crispy noodles..." Zhuo Yi asked nervously while holding the steering wheel in the car.</p>
