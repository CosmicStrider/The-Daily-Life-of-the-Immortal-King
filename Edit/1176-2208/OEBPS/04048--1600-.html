  <h1>Chapter 1600 A good law-abiding citizen・Li Xian</h1>

  <div>

    

    <p>This is the first time Li Xian has accepted a task assigned by Wang Ling. It is also the first time Li Xian has walked out of this Corpse Map in all eternity.</p>

    <p>But now, all the eternal strong men in the picture are just white bones.</p>

    <p>Reshaping the physical body is not difficult for Wang Ling. However, this is to reshape the physical body for the eternal strong man. Therefore, Wang Ling plans to wait until the things at hand are finished. Find time to specifically reshape the body for the picture. Use some of the "tools" you commonly use to customize it.</p>

    <p>As for now, Li Xian who walked out of Corpse Map is still disembodied.</p>
    
    <p>In order to avoid people thinking that he was cosplaying "The Bones of the Sin Realm are King in the End<sup>1</sup>", Wang Ling used the power of King's Eyes to put a layer of skin on Li Xian who was out on business.</p>

    <dfn><sup></sup>(A Novel, "罪域的骨終為王," where the main character has turned into a skeleton.)</dfn>

    <p>In appearance, Li Xian is wearing a very modern casual sportswear. But his appearance is Li Xian's original appearance.</p>

    <p>Li Xian took a look in the mirror after going out. Although he was a little uncomfortable with his current attire, he was very receptive.</p>

    <p>The familiar look in the mirror made Li Xian suddenly feel sad.</p>

    <p>But...</p>

    <p>Finally he came out.</p>

    <p>After putting on a completely modern look, he also lost the long and flowing hair that was the hallmark of the Eternal Strong Man.</p>

    <p>The skin Wang Ling gave him did not follow the aesthetics of that time in the past. It was all based on modern times.</p>

    <p>And Li Xian, who is now wearing modern clothes, is a standard "spirited boy." He has a short haircut and is extremely handsome. He has the look of a star on his face.</p>

    <p>It's no wonder that Dao Ancestor Wang didn't believe Li Xian's explanation at first.</p>

    <p>However, although Li Xian in the mirror has lost his former appearance, the "star wanderer" is still there. He has the style of a literary young man. In addition, Wang Ling gave Li Xian this The skin suit is also paired with glasses without prescription, which makes Li Xian's overall temperament even more obvious.</p>

    <p>"Jiugong Xiushi?" Li Xian searched for the memory that Wang Ling sent to him through mental transmission. He confirmed the target of this operation.</p>

    <p>Over at Jiugong's house. Ever since Jiugong Xinghui, the sixth wife of the Zhai Xing Group, was eliminated by Wang Ling, Jiugong Xiushi's little moves have been the only one that has continued.</p>

    <p>Li Xian's mission this time was to teach Jiugong Xiushi a lesson. By the way, he also destroyed the extra {Ghost Book} volumes.</p>

    <p>The Jiugong family has always regarded {Ghost Book} as a symbol of family power. {Ghost Book} is regarded as a national jade seal in the eyes of the Jiugong family...</p>

    <p>After understanding the whole story of the incident.</p>

    <p>Li Xian suddenly felt that what he was really afraid of was not the ghosts in the {Ghost Book}, but the human hearts outside the {Ghost Book}.</p>

    <p>The poison in people's hearts has far outweighed the threat of {Ghost Book} itself.</p>

    <p>Although the Jiugong family has sealed the dangerous {Ghost Book} in the basement of the Jiugong family, the real danger is the human struggle caused by this little Ghost Book...</p>

    <p>And everyone in the Jiugong family has unknowingly fallen into this fratricidal dispute.</p>

    <p>Li Xian has seen too many fights throughout the ages.</p>

    <p>Although the earth is small, it is also condensed and visible.</p>

    <p>That's it. Li Xian took the Supreme Corpse Map and went out to carry out the first mission assigned by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The reason why I went with the Corpse Map was because this was actually the second task assigned to Li Xian by Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>The main purpose is to let Li Xian help the eternal strong men in Corpse Map to get familiar with modern society.</p>

    <p>In this way, when Wang Ling is used by other people later, there is no need to adapt to it one by one.</p>

    <p>Of course. Although Wang Ling was relieved to hand over the Corpse Map to Li Xian, there was no need to worry about Li Xian running away with the Corpse Map.</p>

    <p>Although Li Xian is a strong man throughout the ages, Li Xian now has neither the ability nor the courage...</p>

    <p>He is a smart man. He knows what to do.</p>

    <p>Come to the modern street.</p>

    <p>When Li Xian saw the modern human cultivators flying swords in an orderly manner, or taking the Spirit Bus from the ground or in the air to wait for the traffic lights to line up to pass through the road section, many ancient strong men were filled with emotion at the same time.</p>

    <p>This is a time they have never seen before.</p>

    <p>No one thought that the cultivation civilization would become like this after all these eternities.</p>

    <p>"Why do all modern cultivators have such tempers as those of rabbits?" Someone lamented in Corpse Map.</p>

    <p>"Yes." Others nodded in agreement: "Think back in the Eternal Era, when the secret realm was opened. The competition was all about speed. Fighting for the priority of the secret realm and fighting for the entrance. That was commonplace. I don't know if it is found under the modern system. How are new secret realms allocated?"</p>

    <p>"It is allocated based on national borders." Li Xian has already looked up this issue.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling gave Li Xian how to use the smartphone through spiritual transmission.</p>

    <p>As for the mobile phone in Li Xian's hands now, Sun Rong bought it for him.</p>

    <p>The eldest lady has a lot of money. Li Xian's group of eternal strong men have no shortage of funds for activities.</p>

    <p>"nation?"</p>

    <p>"The entrance to the new secret realm will be owned by that country. As for the resources inside the secret realm, the country will send a representative team to collect them efficiently. All will be handed over to the national treasury. Finally, they will be unified according to the modern talent resource pool. Resource allocation." Li Xian said.</p>

    <p>Now, everything is different from the time of eternity. Human cultivators have strict rules and systems.</p>

    <p>It is no longer the era of killing people and stealing goods like the ancient times. It is an era of burning, killing and looting at will.</p>

    <p>All kinds of rules and regulations make these violent Eternal Powerhouses in the picture a little uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>But if they want to be free, this is the level they must go through.</p>

    <p>So, Li Xian followed the rules of modern people and waited patiently at the intersection like everyone else. When the red light in front of him turned to green, he used the "levitation technique" to slowly fly forward.</p>

    <p>Of course he's very fast.</p>

    <p>It's just that the road in front of him is a speed limit section. Li Xian really can't get up fast.</p>

    <p>As a legal citizen who is adapting to modern life, he feels that he still has a lot to learn.</p>

    <p>So... when Li Xian arrived at the door of Jiugong's house step by step.</p>

    <p>His ears moved. Many sounds immediately flowed into Li Xian's ears.</p>

    <p>At this moment, One-Eyed Samurai, who works under Jiugong Xiushi, has begun secretly planning in the courtyard to attack Jiugong Liangzi in a closed-door match.</p>

    <p>Apparently, he was just in time.</p>

    <p>Li Xian sighed silently and put his hand on the door of Jiugong's mansion, preparing to blast the door open with the "Star Cannon."</p>

    <p>But then I thought about what I was doing, which might seem like a violation of modern law.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the range of the star cannon is too wide. This cannon will probably circle the earth several times. I don't know how many people will die along the way...</p>

    <p>So, after considering the above, Li Xian took his hand back.</p>

    <p>Started to knock on the door politely.</p>

    <p>"Is anyone here?" Li Xian asked politely with a smile on his face, looking like a gentleman.</p>

    <p>Result. No one responded.</p>

    <p>Li Xian judged that Duyan had probably controlled the entire Jiugong family before taking action.</p>

    <p>But in the current situation, he couldn't enter on his own initiative. This was an act of breaking into a private house.</p>

    <p>So what if... it is an act of force majeure caused by natural factors...</p>

    <p>At this time, Li Xian raised his head and looked at the sky.</p>

    <p>In the deep depths of the universe, a huge meteorite was inspired by Li Xian. It was falling towards the main entrance of the Jiugong family mansion...</p>

    <p>Yes.</p>

    <p>Li Xian plans to do it now.</p>

  <p>Summon meteorites. Break open the door of Jiugong's mansion...</p></div>
