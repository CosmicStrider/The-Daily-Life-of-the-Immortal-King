  <h1>Chapter 2130 The Demon Lord of Cave 0 is awakening</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Latest website: It can only be said that this is Wang Ling's old problem. And this trick always seems to work for him. And it works every time.</p>

    <p>He sighed inwardly. He secretly thought that Sun Rong was not a martial artist. However, his performance was not that obvious because he had a mask to hide it. He just hesitated for a moment.</p>

    <p>This does not allow Sun Rong to make a more accurate judgment. After all, they are being led by a little demon spirit to guide them. They are within the range of the Baidong Demon Lord.</p>

    <p>The movement of hesitation is very vague. It is just a pause of the body. It can also be interpreted as... alertness.</p>

    <p>So it's not really a real deal.</p>

    <p>However, this still made Wang Ling under the mask ashamed. The secret girl's sixth sense was indeed astonishingly terrifying.</p>

    <p>At this time, he fixed his gaze on a certain direction and raised his hand. A huge demon spirit lurking in the tree fell to the ground. The tree, which was as thick as the waist of five people, was directly traversed by Wang Ling. It was poured to the ground and turned into [timber].</p>

    <p>"This is... the sentry around Baidong District?" Sun Rong was slightly surprised. Unexpectedly, the Fuyun Town's previous hesitation was because of this?</p>

    <p>She looked at the huge demon spirit that was shot down. There were two mountain patrol demon flags stuck on its back. This was the symbol of the demon sentry. The key is that the level of this sentry was not low. It was higher than the one she encountered before. The Ten-hole Little Demon is so powerful. Just in terms of physique, it is not on the same level.</p>

    <p>As a result, he was instantly killed by this NPC general.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong sighed. There was a look of disappointment in her eyes. She very much hoped that the person in front of her was Wang Ling... But she didn't expect that the other person was really just an NPC...</p>

    <p>Although the other party hesitated slightly when he shouted just now, as the demon sentry in the Baidong area was shot down, Sun Rong was instantly relieved.</p>

    <p>After all, I paid by mistake. I thought too much...</p>

    <p>Sun Rong has always had a clear understanding of the Sun family. But after all, the Sun family is a family of merchants. They have to deal with people and do business. There are many traps in the business world. So Ever since I was little, Sun Rong has been taught by Mr. Boss Sun to think a few more steps before everything happens.</p>

    <p>Only in this way can we not panic when encountering difficulties. And firmly grasp the initiative in our own hands.</p>

    <p>Therefore Sun Rong has been well aware of this truth since he was a child.</p>

    <p>It can be said that part of the Sun family's brain-boosting ability is innate, and part of it is purely cultivated. This old tradition has continued for a long time. It can be said that it has continued since the generation of Sun Rong's wife, wife, and grandfather.</p>

    <p>At the same time, on the other side, an invasion warning was issued in the Hundred Cave Area. Just after Wang Ling suddenly sent out a sentry, tens of thousands of birds in the jungle were aroused and circled in the air, forming a large black vortex. The howling sound was endless. Dark clouds came over the whole sky instantly, giving a strong sense of oppression.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's heart is always calm. The sound effects of this game are too powerful. But after all, he is used to seeing big scenes. He has seen the scene of the planet exploding. The visual effect caused by this environmental rendering is terrifying. Wang Ling hasn't completely taken it into consideration yet.</p>

    <p>In fact, whenever Wang Ling sees these explosive scenes in the game, he still feels a little proud of Bai Qiao. Other people's sword spirits. The sword body + scabbard is just one spirit. He himself But there are two.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the personalities of the two spirits (Jingke+Bai Qiao) are completely different. Jingke can fight and act cute. Bai Qiao can fight and play games... They are all geniuses with both civil and military talents!</p>

    <p>"Who disturbed my rest..."</p>

    <p>Soon, a whine like a Hongmeng horn came from the Baidong area.</p>

    <p>This was a terrifying sound coming from the depths. The moment it echoed and spread in the air, the five thousand demon spirits in the entire Baidong area boiled instantly. Both Wang Ling and Sun Rong A feeling of being surrounded. Gu Jiang</p>

    <p>At the same time, the nearby environment also began to change. The leaves quickly withered. Instead, countless crystalline substances crawled into every gap in the forest. The ground, tree trunks, flowers, plants and things were all covered by this. covered with crystals.</p>

    <p>Ten Thousand Demonic Crystal Flowers...</p>

    <p>This is an environmental phenomenon caused by the appearance of a powerful demon clan. When the powerful demonic energy combines with the spiritual power in the air, a substance called the Ten Thousand Demonic Crystal Flowers will appear. Instantly like an ivy. Climbing all over every natural scene, it simultaneously emits a demonic aura to achieve a frightening effect.</p>

    <p>This proves that the Demon Lord of Baidong District is probably stronger than Wang Ling imagined.</p>

    <p>But no matter what the blood volume and level are. With the gameplay that Wang Ling currently controls, what he wants is the level difference. And the bigger the gap between this and his own level, the better.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Such a riot also alarmed Mr. Zanghu, who was collecting rare spiritual plants in the distance. He had already collected a lot of spiritual mushrooms that could be used to make medicine. These spiritual plants could be used as medicine and could be quickly refined into products with a constant market value, and the sales were good. Qi and blood elixirs.</p>

    <p>At this moment, he raised his head again and felt the riot in the Baidong area in the distance. He had heard the movement there before. But he didn't expect that the movement at this moment was actually bigger than before.</p>

    <p>He heard the screams of countless birds. Such a tide of spiritual beasts often indicates that a map boss may be activated.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, the next second, in the system channel, an announcement floated over for all players to see.</p>

    <p>[System prompt: Baidong District near Fuyun Town. The Demon Lord of Baidong is awakening...]</p>

    <p>Did someone really pick up this boss?</p>

    <p>Mr. Zanghu is suspicious.</p>

    <p>Although the Baidong District is still located near Novice Village, the average player wants to level up by killing the demon spirits in the Baidong District. These demon spirits will be replenished automatically after a few days. They can never be killed completely.</p>

    <p>But it would be different if we directly challenge the Hundred Cave Demon Lord. Once the Demon Lord dies, the Hundred Cave Demon Spirits will be in a leaderless state. At that time, the demon spirits in that area will have been killed one by one. No. will be automatically generated again. This indicates that the Hundred Cave Area has been occupied by players.</p>

    <p>This is how the game is set up.</p>

    <p>So for many players. The Baidong District is a place to gain experience. No one will directly challenge the boss in the Baidong District in the novice stage because they can't beat it.</p>

    <p>After the level is high, you can come back to play. However, this is a thankless job. There is very little experience gained. The benefits obtained will not match the current level.</p>

    <p>It's like a level 40 boss going to kill the level 20 hidden boss in Novice Village. It took some effort. But the equipment he got was still level 20. Naturally, no one would dare to touch this boss when the benefits are not proportional. Demon Lord of Hundred Cave.</p>

    <p>So after excluding all the above purposes.</p>

    <p>There are only two things that Mr. Zanghu can think of. That is that this player who dares to challenge the Demon Lord of Hundred Cave is either seeking death out of pure innocence. Or he wants to obtain the Baidong District directly by killing the Demon Lord. The control of demon spirits makes these demon spirits become his labor force...</p>

    <p>And people with this kind of thinking can never be just NPCs.</p>

    <p>The opponent should be the lord of a certain city, or a general...</p>
