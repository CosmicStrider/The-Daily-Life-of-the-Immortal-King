  <h1>Chapter 1874 The number of strange companions increases</h1>

  <div>

    <p>As soon as Chen Ren said these words, Wang Ling had to pick up his energy and start to look at the young man carefully.</p>

    <p>If you don't look carefully, this eternal version of Chen Chao doesn't seem to be much different from Chen Chao. The exquisite small head, regular facial features, dark skin, and just the right muscles seem to be synonymous with Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>If he were to say what was different, it would be the scar on the bridge of his nose. Also, he was slightly taller than Chen Chao.</p>

    <p>The heavenly materials and earthly treasures used by the eternal cultivators are far more powerful than those used by modern cultivators. The elixirs refined by modern cultivators with the heavenly materials and earthly treasures already have the standardized process of scientific cultivation. But the eternal cultivators are different.</p>

    <p>They still use a relatively primitive method of alchemy. They throw the collected heavenly materials and earthly treasures into the alchemy furnace, and then resign themselves to fate.</p>

    <p>If it is refined, the medicinal properties are far more powerful than modern ones. Therefore, the eternal cultivators who can survive will be much stronger than modern cultivators in terms of realm growth and development.</p>

    <p>Modern cultivators pay more attention to safety. Pills of the same standard will not have any negative effects on the body. The rest is to use money to pile up resources for cultivation.</p>

    <p>According to Zhang Zhui, there are a few cultivators who have taken medicine to achieve breakthroughs and died through the ages. Together, they can circle the earth several times.</p>

    <p>"Chen Ren. I knew your boy was here too!"</p>

    <p>Just when Wang Ling was watching Chen Ren in a daze, a carefree voice came from the distance.</p>

    <p>A huge figure walked out of a palace, and then came to the door of the Dongda Emperor's palace. This man was fat and had short hair. After greeting Chen Ren from a distance, he started talking like Chen Ren. He lifted up the wealthy woman who was prostrating on the ground.</p>

    <p>"Mom, it's useless for you to worship the Great Emperor. I just don't want to practice... It's so pleasant to raise the spiritual animal ranch at home." said the fat man.</p>

    <p>The plump woman sighed: "I just know that you don't like to practice. So I didn't go in that direction with my prayers to Emperor Dongda. I just hope that you can have more friends and a wider network. In this case, at least I will have friends to take care of me in the future. You will not be bullied."</p>

    <p>"You like to raise spiritual beasts. We all know this... You can practice it. You still have to practice it. After all, your level of cultivation affects your longevity. Your father and I don't want to see you die young."</p>

    <p>The rich woman taught earnestly.</p>

    <p>In a daze, Wang Ling felt that this was an eternal fate that could not be explained in words.</p>

    <p>Even if he doesn't believe it anymore, the overlap of attributes between the two people in front of him is too high compared to Chen Chao and Guo Hao!</p>

    <p>"Brother Guo Jie. I knew you were here too."</p>

    <p>Just like the modern cultivator, the relationship between the two in the eternal era was also very good. Looking at Wang Ling, it feels like a world apart.</p>

    <p>If I hadn't known that this was the Eternal Period. Wang Ling would have thought that the people standing in front of him were Chen Chao and Guo Hao themselves.</p>

    <p>"I can't help it, because I found that many friends came here to pay homage. It took some time to say hello to each one." Guo Jie laughed. The fat on his face looked very elastic: "We don't have to be so polite."</p>

    <p>"Yes. We grew up together. It would be too fake to be so polite." Chen Ren laughed. The two of them hooked up and hugged each other instantly.</p>

    <p>In this regard, both parents were helpless and looked at each other with a smile.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling In fact, really wanted to get to know these two people. Because this can further determine whether these two people are related to Chen Chao and Guo Hao in the future.</p>

    <p>But because he was worried that if he tried to test it, I would disrupt the process of history, he still resisted this impulse.</p>

    <p>As a result, what Wang Ling didn't expect was that Emperor Dongda actually walked over on his own.</p>

    <p>Wang Ying: "Do you know them?"</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda shook his head: "No. I just feel that you, senior, want to get to know them."</p>

    <p>Wang Ying: "Don't. It will affect the course of history."</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda: "Small details don't matter. As long as big events don't change. For example, if there is a duel between emperors here in the future, it will affect many people. In this case, no matter what you do It will not affect the course of history."</p>

    <p>These words caused Wang Ling, Wang Ying, Sun Rong and others to instantly fall into deep silence.</p>

    <p>Because they heard the meaning of the words.</p>

    <p>In the course of history, if an irreversible disaster occurs, no matter what you do before the disaster, it is indeed innocuous... because the disaster is immutable, and everything after the disaster will be destroyed.</p>

    <p>This made Wang Ling suddenly have a doubt.</p>

    <p>Because he knows the fate of all the eternal beings.</p>

    <p>Most of the Eternals were eventually imprisoned in the Corpse Map by Dao Ancestor Wang.</p>

    <p>If we say... this time is a big disaster...</p>

    <p>So in theory, no matter what they do now, it seems that it will not change the course of history.</p>

    <p>But this is just an idea of Wang Ling. At present, he is not particularly clear about the structure of the eternal world. It is always right to be steady.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the operation in which all the Eternals were imprisoned in the Supreme Corpse Map was actually not a natural disaster, but a man-made disaster.</p>

    <p>Since it is a man-made disaster, the probability of triggering may not be 100%.</p>

    <p>So the answer that Wang Ling thought about under this premise is that everything they are doing in the diary now may be to pave the way for Dao Ancestor Wang to take the Eternal Ones into custody in the Corpse Map.</p>

    <p>It's too complicated.</p>

    <p>At this time. Wang Ling sighed in his heart.</p>

    <p>It is not easy to sort out all the events. Now we can only take one step at a time.</p>

    <p>"This brother, stay here. I seem to have seen you somewhere." Just as Emperor Dongda was walking towards the east hall, Guo Jie's voice suddenly came. Then he squinted at him.</p>

    <p>"Oh? Really?" Dongda smiled. He was very kind and warm.</p>

    <p>"You look very kind. And judging from the style of your clothes, you should be from the Eastern Region, right? Only people from the Eastern Region will be equipped with the Suzaku feather pattern on their bodies. I see that the Suzaku embroidery on your robe is Very delicate...the identity must be unusual." Guo Jie frowned and guessed.</p>

    <p>"You know a lot." Dongda agreed.</p>

    <p>"Hey, I heard it all from my friends. I don't have anything. I just have a lot of friends." Guo Jie laughed.</p>

    <p>"Senior is laughing at this. He's like this. He's familiar with himself." At this time, Chen Ren stepped forward and made a respectful gesture of clasping fists.</p>

    <p>"You are a polite child." Emperor Dongda nodded with satisfaction.</p>

    <p>"I think the senior has extraordinary magnanimity. There are other seniors around him who are closely assisting him. He must be from the royal family from the Eastern Region." At this time, Chen Ren also expressed his opinion: "Besides, you must be a fan of the Eastern Emperor."</p>

    <p>Emperor Dongda: "...How can you see it?"</p>

    <p>"Senior, isn't dressing like this a tribute to Emperor Dongda? Is it possible that senior dares to say that he is Emperor Dongda himself?"</p>

    <p>Chen Ren couldn't stop laughing: "Even if it is, that's too weird. How can anyone come to worship themselves? Do you think so?"</p>

    <p>Dongda: "..."</p>

    <p>Sun Rong: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>The rest of the crowd: "..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling found it.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, the Chen family is in danger...</p>

    <p>It has been dangerous since ancient times...</p>
