  <h1>Chapter 1201 Yi Zhiyang. 1 Sheep</h1>

  <div>

    <p>No one thought that Sun Rong would take advantage of the heavy rain and use the power of Aohai's sword spirit to wield the sword energy from a distance to annihilate the enemy. Although not everyone was eliminated in the end.</p>

    <p>So on the eighth day, there were 12 people left on the field.</p>

    <p>Number 60 High School occupies 6 people.</p>

    <p>The remaining six people are: Nan Yixiu from Nanhai Tianzhong, Siyan who had previously worked with Wang Zhen, Zhu Hanyun from Taitan High School, Yan Xiaochun, a junior student from the same school, Tang Jingze from Number 59 High School and Jian Shen College. Captain Yi Zhiyang.</p>

    <p>Everyone in Number 60 High School knows more or less about other people. However, this Yi Zhiyang from Jian Shen College. His origin makes people curious.</p>

    <p>"What kind of school is Jian Shen College?" Chen Chao touched his head. He felt confused.</p>

    <p>"My uncle seemed to have mentioned it to me. This is the newly established cultivation High School in Jinghua City. I didn't expect that this young school would participate in the national competition for the first time and someone would be shortlisted... But this is Yi Zhiyang. I don't know who it is." There are too many students participating. Even if there are too many uncles, it is impossible for everyone to remember them clearly.</p>

    <p>The key is that Jian Shen Academy was not originally on Principal Chen's watch list. Now one person suddenly broke out. This surprised all the contestants from the school.</p>

    <p>If the game hasn't started yet, maybe Guo Hao can learn Yi Zhiyang's identity through other means. But now he is in the game after all. Even if he has tricks off the field, he can't use them openly.</p>

    <p>Command center. Huang Lao sips hot tea. He is wrapped in a thick quilt. This quilt is a special magic weapon. Wrapped around the body, it has the effect of driving away cold air and strengthening the body...</p>

    <p>This is the real Huang Lao.</p>

    <p>Previously, he was trapped in a cold pool in a stalactite cave. His whole body was frozen into ice.</p>

    <p>"Teacher, are you feeling better?" President Qi asked with concern.</p>

    <p>"It's gotten better already." Mr. Huang stared at Yi Zhiyang on the screen: "Speaking of which, could this person be..."</p>

    <p>"The teacher's guess is absolutely correct." President Qi smiled and nodded.</p>

    <p>The students at Jian Shen Academy are naturally experts in swordsmanship. Moreover, the leader of the team is also named Yi. Let me ask you about the swordsmanship in this world. How many people can be as good as the swordsman named Yi?</p>

    <p>Mr. Huang carefully looked at Yi Zhiyang's appearance. Then he frowned again. He shook his head slightly and said through a message: "He doesn't look like him. And I remember that Yi Jianchuan is a thousand-year-old virgin." I don't have a wife. When did such a big son appear?"</p>

    <p>"Not my biological son." President Qi then smiled and replied using the sound transmission technique.</p>

    <p>"This... belongs to the old man next door?" Huang Lao was shocked.</p>

    <p>"The teacher is overthinking. This is a child that Old Yi picked up more than ten years ago. It is said that he was born with a sword bone. He thought he was a talent that could be made, so he adopted him as his adopted son."</p>

    <p>So that's it.</p>

    <p>Huang Lao was relieved.</p>

    <p>Now all the doubts in his mind were lifted.</p>

    <p>In the middle of the night on the seventh day, the sword rain baptism led by Sun Rong directly eliminated most people. And among so many split screens in front of him, Huang Lao recognized the ones split in the corners of the screen at a glance. Yi Zhiyang.</p>

    <p>At that time, Yi Zhiyang was sitting alone on the cliff, his white school uniform swaying in the wind. He did not wield any magic weapon. He just pulled out a handful of grass on the ground and integrated the sword intention into the grass. Using these grasses The strength formed a powerful sword screen. It withstood the baptism of Aohai's sword rain.</p>

    <p>No one would have thought that on the last day of the competition, such a group of dark horses would appear.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Saturday, November 22nd. The eighth day of the National Cultivation School Physical Martial Arts Competition.</p>

    <p>After discussion among the surviving students from each school, everyone unanimously decided that the final battle would be a one-on-one showdown on the Dome Mountain, with promotions taking place step by step.</p>

    <p>The opponent of the duel is determined by drawing lots.</p>

    <p>"Write the names of all the people from Number 60 High School on the slips of paper. How about each of the six of you draws one?" Nan Yixiu suggested.</p>

    <p>"The six of you challenged the six of us from Number 60 High School? Then why don't you include your names together?" Chen Chao felt that this was unfair.</p>

    <p>The original one-on-one duel was already the biggest concession Number 60 High School had made. Otherwise, based on the current situation, Number 60 High School could completely attack as a group and defeat them one by one. There was no need to schedule a duel on Dome Mountain.</p>

    <p>And the reason why he agreed to the one-on-one request is that Sun Rong was actually operating according to the instructions of Principal Chen.</p>

    <p>There is no other reason, the main reason is to save some face and consideration for other schools... If this is really a group push, the probability of other schools winning is extremely slim. Moreover, the one-on-one duel makes it easier to enjoy the competition, and Sun Rong especially likes this feeling.</p>

    <p>But after all, this matter is not something Chen Chao can decide. During the process of leading the team, everything must obey the command of Sun Rong: "It doesn't matter one-on-one. The victory of this game is destined to belong to Number 60 High School. If this can be done If you are convinced, that's fine."</p>

    <p>This decision was not made because Sun Rong was too arrogant and conceited. It was because she did have confidence in everyone at Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>After being baptized by her Aohai sword rain last night, almost everyone in other schools was exhausted. And they had no extra supplies to restore their aura and physical strength.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, at Number 60 High School, because Sun Rong is constantly producing elixirs, everyone's spiritual energy, physical fitness, and mental state are relatively maintained at an excellent level.</p>

    <p>So even if it's a one-on-one duel. Sun Rong feels that Number 60 High School still has the upper hand.</p>

    <p>"Then it's a deal!" Nan Yixiu was excited when he heard Sun Rong agreed to the duel. He took out the bamboo sticks he had prepared in advance and put them in a bamboo tube for the six of them to draw. Bamboo sticks Written on it are the names of everyone at Number 60 High School.</p>

    <p>"Classmate Tang and classmate Yi. You have the smallest number. You can be selected first."</p>

    <p>"Okay." Tang Jingze stepped forward and drew a card. The person he drew was Chen Chao. This made Tang Jingze a little disappointed. He actually wanted to fight Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Yi Zhiyang calmed down. He crossed his arms and said with a rather cold expression: "I don't need it. Just give me the rest after you finish it."</p>

    <p>"Okay!" Nan Yixiu curled her lips.</p>

    <p>After everyone draws.</p>

    <p>The list of duels has also been finally determined.</p>

    <p>First round promotion match.</p>

    <p>Tang Jingze versus Guo Hao;</p>

    <p>Yi Zhiyang versus Sun Rong;</p>

    <p>Zhu Hanyun against Chen Chao;</p>

    <p>Yan Xiaochun versus Li Youyue;</p>

    <p>Four Eyes Duel in the South Huaxiu Sea with Xia Ming.</p>

    <p>And in the end, Nan Yixiu. The person drawn was Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>In fact, all the draws were arranged by Nan Yixiu.</p>

    <p>Nan Yixiu drew Wang Ling. It was also within Nan Yixiu's arrangement...</p>

    <p>The one he drew was the classmate Wang Ling who was known as the Sixty Mascot...</p>

    <p>A superior horse versus an inferior horse.</p>

    <p>According to the rules of Tian Ji horse racing, Nan Yixiu feels that he has advanced to the first round. It is very stable!</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, Nan Yixiu curled her lips. She was secretly happy: "Classmate Wang Ling. I'm sorry!"</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>
