  <h1>Chapter 1361 Mr. Shuangji's road to death</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Mentioning his junior brother, the monk's face was full of melancholy.</p>

    <p>In my impression, Wang Ling rarely saw a monk showing such an expression.</p>

    <p>You know, the friendship between the monk and his junior brother back then was very deep.</p>

    <p>At this time, the monk said Amitabha and then said, "Let me tell you about my experience of scattering ashes."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling: "..."</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng said: "Back then, my junior brother and I entered the Buddhist hall together and broke through the maze of words left by the master. Those who pass the level can inherit the mantle of the master. But halfway through, I was trapped by the "maze of the past" left by the master."</p>

    <p>Hearing this. Wang Ling understood clearly.</p>

    <p>This Buddhist maze of the past is probably based on the same principle as the original Heavenly Dao move made by the monk before.</p>

    <p>If the practitioner does not reflect on himself, he will be trapped in the infinite illusion of the past forever.</p>

    <p>"This was originally a test given to me by my master. But I let him down."</p>

    <p>Monk Jin Deng sighed: "If my junior brother leaves me and moves on, he can become my master's successor. However, junior brother, he sacrificed himself in order to get me out of the predicament."</p>

    <p>"Then you become the sage of Buddhism" Wang Ling asked.</p>

    <p>"No." The monk shook his head: "The cultivation of the poor monk today was achieved by relying on his own strength after his great enlightenment. Although my junior brother saved me, I did not open the door to the end of the Buddhist hall."</p>

    <p>"Junior brother, he is a more suitable successor than me. He sacrificed his life to help me out of trouble. This kind of friendship is worth remembering for the rest of my life."</p>

    <p>"The door to the end is still in the Buddhist hall. So far, no monk has opened it. I don't know what the master left for us. Maybe it is some kind of magical weapon or some Buddhist scriptures."</p>

    <p>At this time, the monk gave a wry smile and said, "But since it is the inheritance of the mantle, this thing must be able to help one of my brothers become the most holy saint in Buddhism."</p>

    <p>When Monk Jin Deng said this, he found that Wang Ling suddenly frowned, looking thoughtful.</p>

    <p>"Ling Zhenren" asked the monk.</p>

    <p>He rarely sees Wang Ling looking dazed.</p>

    <p>If so. Something big must be happening.</p>

    <p>For example, last time he was in a daze, he exchanged souls with "Crispy Noodles Dao Lord."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling came back to his senses: "Yeah, it's okay."</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian was taken into his core world by Yang Shuangji.</p>

    <p>At this time, Yang Shuangji, who was in action, also began to carry out his own delisting plan for the list of people who must not be provoked.</p>

    <p>Except for Wang Ling and the monk who are ranked first and second in this list, the rest of the names are in no particular order.</p>

    <p>"Senior, if you don't want to kill Ling Zhenren, why did you choose the last person on the list to do it first?" Zhao Qingxian asked curiously in the core world.</p>

    <p>"Good food. Save it for last." Mr. Shuangji said.</p>

    <p>Killing his senior brother and his vest too early is too boring.</p>

    <p>So Yang Shuangji's idea was to kill all the others on the list. Finally, he would attack Monk Jin Deng and Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Since they can appear on this list, I know that these people must be related to my senior brothers.</p>

    <p>Last person on the list: Sun Rong.</p>

    <p>This is the first target he wants to kill.</p>

    <p>It's just a Foundation Phase.</p>

    <p>It can be extinguished by just blowing on it.</p>

    <p>But Yang Shuangji didn't know where the girl lived.</p>

    <p>So, he used his Asura pestle to argue his position.</p>

    <p>Zhao Qingxian: "What are you going to do, sir?"</p>

    <p>Yang Shuangji smiled: "Just watch."</p>

    <p>He stood on a flat ground and stood the Asura Pestle upright on it. Then he released his hand. The Asura Pestle immediately fell in one direction.</p>

    <p>"That's the right direction."</p>

    <p>This method of position defense seems a bit random, but Yang Shuangji believes in it.</p>

    <p>The legendary Buddhist theory of debate.</p>

    <p>Just recite the name of the person you are looking for in your mind.</p>

    <p>And what's more convenient is that this list of people who must not be messed with actually comes with photos of each person.</p>

    <p>Except for the photo of the vest called "Wang Ling" owned by his senior brother, which is a mosaic. The photos of the rest of the people are clearly listed next to their names.</p>

    <p>This undoubtedly brought great convenience to Yang Shuangji's search.</p>

    <p>"This girl looks pretty good to me. If you like women, I think you can give it a try." Yang Shuangji chuckled.</p>

    <p>"No. I only have Qingyi in my heart. I can no longer tolerate other women." Zhao Qingxian shook his head and refused.</p>

    <p>Although judging from the photos, Sun Rong is indeed very beautiful. Her exquisite facial features can almost be described as impeccable.</p>

    <p>To use Zhao Qingxian's words, this is the "first love face" that all boys have fantasized about.</p>

    <p>However, as an infatuated man, his heart has already been given to Liu Qingyi.</p>

    <p>This time he was willing to go down to earth. In fact, his main purpose was to go to Liu Qingyi.</p>

    <p>"I didn't expect you to be a lover. What a pity."</p>

    <p>Yang Shuangji smiled and said: "Then I'll do it first. Anyway, I've already returned to secular life. And I haven't touched a woman for a long time."</p>

    <p>"Senior is thinking"</p>

    <p>"Yes. I will kill this girl first. Then enjoy it while it's hot."</p>

    <p>Yang Shuangji raised the corners of his lips, showing an evil face.</p>

    <p>"This time, Zhao Qingxian suddenly felt a little regretful.</p>

    <p>The person he was following didn't seem normal! He was too perverted!</p>

    <p>The key is that such a person is actually the most holy Buddha in Buddhism. Is it certain that he will not cry?</p>

    <p>Using the "Asura Pestle" method of identifying Buddha's fate, Yang Shuangji soon arrived at the door of the luxurious villa where Sun Rong lived.</p>

    <p>"Too weak."</p>

    <p>In front of the door, Yang Shuangji felt the atmosphere inside the villa. He only felt that the people inside were weak and pitiful.</p>

    <p>But treat a Foundation Phase.</p>

    <p>He also has to pay a little attention.</p>

    <p>Since you want to get close to a woman, you can't be too harsh. Otherwise, she will be beaten into a paste by him, which will be very embarrassing.</p>

    <p>He raised his hand and pointed his palm towards the direction of Sun Rong's bedroom.</p>

    <p>Trying to use the force of his palm to draw the girl out of the room.</p>

    <p>As a result, at this moment, in the void, a wave of powerful aura struck in the opposite direction from the direction of his palm power.</p>

    <p>The huge energy poured in like a long river. In an instant, Yang Shuangji's palms were shaken open.</p>

    <p>"There are experts"</p>

    <p>Yang Shuangji was shocked. He didn't expect that there was a master of decision-making hidden in this room.</p>

    <p>While he was thinking, a group of shadows was gathering in the void. Countless shadows poured out from the direction of Sun Rong's bedroom. Finally, they formed the prototype of Sun Ying'er.</p>

    <p>"Who is it! You want to attack my Rongrong!"</p>

    <p>As soon as Sun Ying'er appeared, he turned his attention to Yang Shuangji at the door: "Huh! Anyone who touches my Rongrong will die!"</p>

    <p>Furious, her snow-white hair fluttered in the air. Sun Ying'er pursed her lips. In an instant, she split into more than a dozen split bodies and attacked Yang Shuangji!</p>
