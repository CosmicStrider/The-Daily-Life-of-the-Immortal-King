  <h1>Chapter 1617 The daily life of the eternal boss</h1>

  <div>

    <p>The investigation of Transformers caused quite a stir among the core members of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>In the world of cultivation, there are many kinds of magic that can change shape. Many times it is used by casual cultivators who want to explore secret realms and the world when they organize group expeditions.</p>

    <p>Strange cultivators do not know each other. It is common for them to use their identities for safety reasons.</p>

    <p>Someone once used a thousand faces to team up with different people to explore the secret realm. After this story was spread, the term "Thousand Faces Man" became very popular in the world of cultivation.</p>

    <p>But the Thousand-Faced Man certainly has a thousand faces. No matter what he looks like, everyone sees the same face at the same time.</p>

    <p>Unless there is a spell more powerful than "Thousand Faces Transfiguration", it is absolutely impossible for everyone to see things differently.</p>

    <p>This matter was a bit out of line for core members of the Office of Strategic Deception.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, two new Eternal-level consultants have recently been welcomed into the core members.</p>

    <p>One is Li Xian, the star wanderer who summons meteorites at every turn.</p>

    <p>The other is Zhang Zhui, the father of Theft.</p>

    <p>These two people were the first eternity-level experts to be released from the Corpse Map by Wang Ling. And as soon as they came out, they completed the tasks assigned by Wang Ling very well.</p>

    <p>And now, he has officially settled in Songhai City. He has begun to learn and adapt to the life of a modern cultivator little by little.</p>

    <p>The place to stay was arranged by Zhuo Yi.</p>

    <p>It's still Wei Zhi's cadre apartment.</p>

    <p>After Liu Qingyi and Wang Zhen moved out, the originally lively atmosphere suddenly became deserted. Occasionally, Wei Zhi would feel lonely.</p>

    <p>He was not used to living under the same roof with strangers.</p>

    <p>But now I'm getting used to it.</p>

    <p>The main reason is that he has too many pets.</p>

    <p>Short of money.</p>

    <p>And the Office of Strategic Deception provided too much...</p>

    <p>It's just a few more people living together in the living area. Not only can all his feeding expenses be taken care of, he will also be very wealthy.</p>

    <p>This is a very good deal for Wei Zhi.</p>

    <p>The only thing that's a little bit wrong is that. Wei Zhi realized that the two new men looked like they'd just moved into the city. They often did strange things.</p>

    <p>"Senpai. This is called a refrigerator... So you don't have to make it snow at home. Look at my coo-coo chicken, it's freezing. The crown of the chicken has turned blue." Wei Zhi said in a pained voice.</p>

    <p>"Okay. Sorry Mr. Landlord." Li Xian scratched his head. He apologized from the bottom of his heart.</p>

    <p>He and Zhang Zhui are destined to have a long time to learn about the use of electrical appliances in today's cultivating life.</p>

    <p>He had a good attitude towards admitting his mistake. Wei Zhi actually didn't take it too seriously.</p>

    <p>It was just that he didn't think of asking about the details of the two of them until after Li Xian and Zhang Zhui moved in.</p>

    <p>Because the money given to the Office of Strategic Deception is too much.</p>

    <p>As for the money, Wei Zhi was temporarily dazzled. He agreed without even thinking about it.</p>

    <p>"Um. Brother Zhuo Yi...what are the origins of these two uncles?" At lunch time, Wei Zhi called and asked.</p>

    <p>He just saved the world again.</p>

    <p>Because there is a Heavenly Dao durian at home, which makes Li Xian and Zhang Zhui even more curious.</p>

    <p>When Wei Zhi discovered that the two of them were gathering together to smash open durians with meteorites, he quickly stepped forward to spread the word about what durians were.</p>

    <p>That's it.</p>

    <p>Poor Earth Spirit. Once again escaped disaster...</p>

    <p>"Oh. It turns out they are brothers Wei Zhi. Do the two uncles you are talking about refer to senior Li Xian and senior Zhang Zhui?" Zhuo Yi said with a smile.</p>

    <p>"Yeah. I think they are weird..."</p>

    <p>A few days ago he heard the two of them discussing Taoism in the room.</p>

    <p>What he said was something he couldn't understand.</p>

    <p>"The Tao is Tao. It is very Tao. Brother Zi Xiang is a little too persistent. I have been obsessed. Letting go of the obsession...is the right way."</p>

    <p>"Existence precedes essence. Let me ask you. What is the essence of Tao?"</p>

    <p>"Then how do you define existence?"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi was a little confused after hearing a few words.</p>

    <p>I still feel a little dizzy when I recall it.</p>

    <p>On the other end of the phone. Zhuo Yi couldn't help laughing immediately after hearing Wei Zhi's complaints.</p>

    <p>"It's my fault. I forgot to tell you. Seniors Li Xian and Zhang Zhui have been in seclusion for a long time. So they are not very familiar with modern cultivation life. I arranged for them to stay with you. I also want you to take time to guide them."</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi said: "Why. Did it cause you any trouble?"</p>

    <p>"It's not too much trouble to arrive."</p>

    <p>"The Office of Strategic Deception will double the compensation for any losses caused to you during the stay of the two seniors. Please rest assured."</p>

    <p>"I've already paid a lot for the rent..." Wei Zhi held up his forehead and showed a bitter smile.</p>

    <p>In fact, he is not that careless person.</p>

    <p>I just want to know more about Li Xian and Zhang Zhui.</p>

    <p>After all, we will still have to live together for a long time.</p>

    <p>If you can understand your temper, you can avoid many unnecessary conflicts.</p>

    <p>Over the phone. Zhuo Yi thought for a moment and then said: "Thank you for your hard work these past two days, Brother Wei Zhi. I will ask Er Ha to visit you in a few days. You haven't seen it for a while, right?"</p>

    <p>These words were a direct reassurance for Wei Zhi.</p>

    <p>"Ah! Er Gouzi!" Wei Zhi shouted loudly.</p>

    <p>It has indeed been a long time since he saw Er Ha. When he went to find Er Ha before, he heard that Er Ha had been in retreat.</p>

    <p>Of course. Er Ha hasn't come to see Wei Zhi these days. It's not because of retreat.</p>

    <p>It has long since been promoted to a divine beast.</p>

    <p>It's just that Mother Wang gave birth to Wang Nuan not long ago. She needs to be taken care of.</p>

    <p>As a mature dog, Er Ha also started to learn to wash clothes, cook and change Ah Nuan girl's diapers...</p>

    <p>"Then it's settled Zhuo Yi brother!"</p>

    <p>Now that he heard that Er Ha was coming, Wei Zhi suddenly became happy.</p>

    <p>I feel happier than receiving the rent payment.</p>

    <p>After interrupting the call, he was about to go out to the spirit animal market to buy some beef bone sticks and big meat flies to prepare special dog food for Er Ha.</p>

    <p>This is a food specially invented by Wei Zhi for Er Ha.</p>

    <p>Use the "bone crusher" to crush the marrow inside the bone. Then insert a vacuum suction tube on one side of the beef bone to suck out the marrow and mix it with the big meat flies. Put it in a juicer and crush it. Mix it one to one and then sprinkle it with nutrients. Pink packet.</p>

    <p>Finally, re-inject it into the complete beef bone sticks and bake it, and you're done.</p>

    <p>Only when Er Ha comes to your door can you enjoy such royal treatment.</p>

    <p>As one of Er Ha's few friends in the human world, Wei Zhi is indeed interesting.</p>

    <p>While changing shoes at the door, Wei Zhui suddenly saw Zhang Zhui approaching: "Mr. Landlord. If possible. Can you take me with you?"</p>

    <p>"Where's Senior Li Xian?"</p>

    <p>"He was planning to go out with me. He just received a call from Sect Master Diulei. He is busy."</p>

    <p>"That's alright. Senior, just follow me. If you encounter something you don't understand, don't rush to take action..." Wei Zhi said.</p>

    <p>"I understand." Zhang Zhui smiled and agreed confidently.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The two of them took the bus from the cadre apartment all the way to the spirit animal market.</p>

    <p>On the bus. Everything was harmonious.</p>

    <p>Wei Zhi also breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>But when he got out of the car, Wei Zhi suddenly realized something was wrong.</p>

    <p>Because he found an extra sack on Zhang Zhui's hand. It was filled with coins...</p>

    <p>"Senior, you..."</p>

    <p>"Sorry. I couldn't hold it back for a while."</p>

    <p>Zhang Zhui rubbed the back of his head in embarrassment: "Speaking of this sack, how do I return it?"</p>
