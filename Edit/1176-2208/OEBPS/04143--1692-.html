  <h1>Chapter 1692 The knowledge of giving gifts</h1>

  <div>

    <p>In the past, she never worried about a gift. Because there are so many gifts that can be bought with money in this world. But when faced with Wang Ling, she still wanted to give something special. At least. A gift that reflects your sincerity and heart.</p>

    <p>After all, gifts that can be bought with money are not sincerity.</p>

    <p>When she was very young, Sun Yiyuan once taught her that giving gifts is actually a very sophisticated thing for the cultivators of Huaxiu country. Gifts also contain great knowledge. The traditional culture of reciprocity has continued for thousands of years to this day. It's not unreasonable.</p>

    <p>Reasonable reciprocity is an important course in interpersonal relationships. It is different from simply giving gifts directly.</p>

    <p>Gifts are not always better when they are more expensive, the key is "suitability."</p>

    <p>Nowadays, more and more people are misinterpreting the meaning of "gift giving." Often the meaning of "gift giving" changes after giving it away.</p>

    <p>She didn't believe this rhetoric before. Only now did she discover the inscrutable nature of this knowledge...</p>

    <p>Turns out to be...</p>

    <p>When you like someone, you will really get entangled in choosing a gift!</p>

    <p>The more you care, the more you like it.</p>

    <p>And the more you like it, the more people will feel hesitant.</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>About twenty minutes passed. Wang Ling over there had transformed the chaos rudder into a rudder-shaped milk bottle. At the same time, the previously stored Xiaguang was made into milk powder for brewing.</p>

    <p>The color of this brewed nutritious chaos milk is really beautiful. It has a little bit of starlight. It is actually seven colors. Ah Nuan girl took a big gulp of the milk bottle. Her soft little face was full of happy expressions.</p>

    <p>"It looks delicious..." Jiugong Liangzi propped up his knees and looked at Wang Nuan sucking milk. No girl would feel overflowing with motherhood when seeing such a scene.</p>

    <p>She thinks Wang Nuan is too cute.</p>

    <p>I even had the dangerous thought of having a relationship with Zhuo Yi...</p>

    <p>"As expected of Nuan Zhenren. Only Ling Zhenren can handle this chaotic milk. Nuan Zhenren's physique can handle it." Monk Jin Deng smiled crookedly.</p>

    <p>The milk powder brewed with Chaos Xiaguang seems to be nothing to Wang Ling and Wang Nuan. But this kind of milk actually has great stamina and is very easy to get addicted.</p>

    <p>If other people go to drink, even just one bite will feel like they have been drunk with strong alcohol. If the body is a little weaker and drinks more, it is easy for the energy to overflow and explode.</p>

    <p>"So, what Senior Jin Deng means is that he can explode?"</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei became interested when he heard this: "This can be regarded as unlocking a new way to die. It will be very helpful to improve my {Book of Death}."</p>

    <p>"As expected of the true king..."</p>

    <p>The rest of the Office of Strategic Deception heard this and were all amazed.</p>

    <p>This death-seeking senior is now on the road to constantly unlocking new ways to die and is unable to extricate himself...</p>

    <p>It is unheard of since ancient times to be able to increase the strength of one's cultivation through constant death.</p>

    <p>Although he will be resurrected.</p>

    <p>But the pain caused by death can still be felt!</p>

    <p>Various ways to die...</p>

    <p>Some methods of death even require death in an extremely painful process.</p>

    <p>According to the brain circuit of a normal person, no matter how powerful the "Sutra of Suicide" is, it is impossible to learn such a method to improve one's cultivation level.</p>

    <p>As for Wang Ling and Lord Diulei, I can only say that one dares to teach and the other dares to learn...</p>

    <p>Of course, If Lord Diulei succeeds in learning in the end, the improvement in combat power will be unparalleled! In the later stage, as long as a new method of death is unlocked, the span of improvement in combat power will be much greater than the experience stack obtained by the monk's first reincarnation!</p>

    <p>Until then, for Lord Diulei, if he dies once, it is equivalent to reincarnation!</p>

    <p>The monk still needs to survive the experience of his current life before he can enter the next reincarnation.</p>

    <p>Just the growth aspect is different.</p>

    <p>"It's done, Zhenjun. Qin Zhong and I have arranged the teleportation circle of the Office of Strategic Deception according to your instructions.</p>

    <p>It is directly connected from the True Venerated Immortal Hall of the Office of Strategic Deception to the castle hall of the Imperial City." At this time, Xiang Yi said while carrying a black sniper rifle box. He and Qin Zhong worked together to successfully establish this road. Green channel.</p>

    <p>The follow-up work is to wait for the Office of Strategic Deception to completely take over the current situation in the Science and Technology City.</p>

    <p>But it's still a bit of a pity.</p>

    <p>After this incident in the Virtual Realm. is over, he and Qin Zhong will not be able to stay here for long.</p>

    <p>Lord Diulei has become a habitual observer. He could still see the thoughts of Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi. He immediately said: "After this ordeal, you two have become my office of Strategic Deception guest elders. If you don't dislike it, why don't you? How about staying here for a few more days? Anyway, if you go back then, brother Ling can also send you back to the previous world line. You can even specify a time node. It will not affect you two."</p>

    <p>"Is this... really okay?"</p>

    <p>When the two heard this, their eyes immediately flickered.</p>

    <p>They looked at Wang Ling. They saw Wang Ling shrugging indifferently.</p>

    <p>If it were an ordinary person, Wang Ling would certainly not agree.</p>

    <p>But Qin Zhong and Xiang Yi.</p>

    <p>It can be a special case.</p>

    <p>"Thank you so much Ling Zhenren and Zhenjun!"</p>

    <p>The two immediately bowed and nodded.</p>

    <p>Being able to stay and study with Wang Ling. Such learning opportunities don't come often!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Although the green transmission channel has been established, due to the twists and turns in the space, the internal structure of the channel is very complicated, so a third-party media is needed for transmission.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling directly reorganized the Rubik's cubes that sealed and contained the living beings. It formed something similar to a space elevator. The internal space was extremely large. The maximum load-bearing capacity was one hundred billion tons.</p>

    <p>The Office of Strategic Deception was divided into two groups. One group stayed for communication. The other group returned and brought back information from the Science and Technology City for sharing.</p>

    <p>Because I had to take care of Ah Nuan girl's feeding. Wang Ling did not go back immediately.</p>

    <p>To Wang Ling's surprise, this time Sun Rong didn't try every means to take the same flight back with him. He directly took Jiugong Liangzi's hand and entered the elevator. He seemed to be rushing back without stopping. appearance.</p>

    <p>"Wang Ling... See you on Earth!" Before leaving, she still had a smile on her face and greeted her generously.</p>

    <p>As soon as the elevator door closed, she immediately dialed Sun Yiyuan's number.</p>

    <p>Jiugong Liangzi was shocked: "Can there be a signal?"</p>

    <p>Zhuo Yi laughed: "Master's mobile phone has been enlightened by senior Jin Deng. It is not a problem to achieve signal crossing. It can even make calls from the third dimension to the second dimension."</p>

    <p>"In other words, you can talk to those fictional anime characters?"</p>

    <p>"Theoretically, it's absolutely possible." Zhuo Yi said, "If my master enlightens me, maybe I can bring out those fictional anime characters."</p>

    <p>"..." On the other side, Zhou Ziyi was shocked when he heard this.</p>

    <p>He knew that Zhuo Yi planned all of this to allow him to successfully become a disciple and gain the approval of Master Wang outside...</p>

    <p>After this incident, it can be said that Zhou Ziyi's inner outlook has been completely refreshed.</p>

    <p>His master is too strong...</p>

    <p>It was so strong that he once doubted whether it was human...</p>
