  <h1>Chapter 2148 Crouching Dragons Gather</h1>

  <div>

    <p>Sun Rong and Lao Huang are very clear. What they want is Wolong, a true talent. Even in the game world, there is justice and morality. They are determined not to do this kind of behavior that tarnishes their reputation. Will do it.</p>

    <p>Of course. Some people will think that this may be just a game. No one will take it too seriously. But the problem is the game world of Itinerant Immortal. Everything is too real.</p>

    <p>All players who feel the purity of the air in this world and breathe in the fresh air in the game world will not feel that this is a false world.</p>

    <p>What's more, the world is now also suffering from the influence of some evil forces. It is gradually becoming real.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling is sitting in the General's Mansion. He uses his Number 04 Eyes: the True and False Yuan Shen Dharma Eye to observe the changes in the game world.</p>

    <p>He observes the game world through backward reasoning.</p>

    <p>A series of cold digital codes. They seem to be disordered. But in fact, as long as they can understand them, there are rules to follow. He can use the codes to make inferences and see the essence through the phenomena.</p>

    <p>Today, outside the General's Mansion, there is a long queue at the temporary Wolong Recruitment Office. There is an endless stream of applicants recommended for interviews, covering the entire street.</p>

    <p>The happiness index of cities and towns is rising steadily. The gathering of talents is one of the ways that the system determines to add points to the happiness index of cities and towns.</p>

    <p>In a short period of time, more Wolongs have gathered in Fuyun Town. The happiness index will also increase, thus attracting more players.</p>

    <p>This is a forward cycle.</p>

    <p>Of course. In addition to real players, there are also NPCs who automatically enter Fuyun Town to participate in the election due to the increase in the town's happiness index.</p>

    <p>The difference between real players and NPCs. Lao Huang has his own method.</p>

    <p>That is to directly conduct the Turing test.</p>

    <p>First, tell with the naked eye whether this person is a robot player generated in the world of Itinerant Immortal. Then just ask the question directly.</p>

    <p>And the question must be repeated.</p>

    <p>For example, below is the conversation between Lao Huang and a suspected NPC player.</p>

    <p>"What's your name?"</p>

    <p>"Li Qiushui."</p>

    <p>"What's your name?"</p>

    <p>"Li Qiushui."</p>

    <p>"What's your name?"</p>

    <p>"Excuse me, HR. Are you deaf? My name is Li Qiushui."</p>

    <p>"Okay, it's okay..."</p>

    <p>After repeated questions, the robot player did not answer the questions in a fixed sentence according to the questions preset by the code. This is enough to prove that this is an ordinary player.</p>

    <p>Of course, the above situation cannot be generalized. After all, there are some very "dog" players who will even use the "Turing Test" through reverse psychology in order to hide their identity.</p>

    <p>No matter how many times you ask a question, the answers will always be exactly the same. It makes people believe that this is a real NPC.</p>

    <p>For example, they are very suspicious now...Wang Ling...</p>

    <p>Well, although this was not the first time that they had doubted the general from Fuyun Town, they just felt that this general felt weird from beginning to end.</p>

    <p>Mainly, they also conducted a Turing test on Wang Ling. Good guys. As a result, Wang Ling did not fall into the trap. They asked countless questions. Every time Wang Ling answered the answer. Exactly the same.</p>

    <p>Moreover, some questions were asked after a long interval. The answers were still the same as last time.</p>

    <p>This forced them to believe that this general was a real NPC. Secondly, even if he was a disguised NPC, Lao Huang felt that this man was too dedicated...hundreds of questions! He had to remember hundreds of questions. Fixed answers. Then answer every time they choose. You can't travel. How dedicated you must be...</p>

    <p>It would be a shame not to become an actor.</p>

    <p>With such powerful acting skills and line memory skills, even the best actor had to kneel down after watching it.</p>

    <p>So Sun Rong and Lao Huang thought that no matter whether this player is real or fake, just treat him as a fake... After all, he can have the energy to memorize the answers to so many questions. And the answer is never The person who made the mistake must be given some respect.</p>

    <p>Sun Rong and Lao Huang orderly select thoughtful players to build towns. Many players already have their own main jobs in the real world. And the experience of these jobs can also be applied to the game.</p>

    <p>For example, 3D modelers. Modelers usually also have the ability of designers. Therefore, they are very good at overall map planning of towns and urban environment beautification.</p>

    <p>Another example is the serious chef. The chef is a sub-profession in the Itinerant Immortal game. It is different from the scammer who persuaded people to join and open a store. The serious sub-professional chef is in the Itinerant Immortal game. In the gaming world, it is undoubtedly a high-income profession.</p>

    <p>Directly choose [Thief] to start the game. The high luck attribute bonus can often be used in the chef as a sub-professional. If there are not enough ingredients, you can steal them through the thief's professional skills in the early stage. The luck value also means that the chef can cook dishes with high attributes. Additional dishes.</p>

    <p>Very useful for strategy copies.</p>

    <p>Although the attribute bonus of food is temporary, these high attribute bonuses are often the key to the strategy copy. In the same way, the thief turned alchemist and the thief turned weapon refiner are also the mainstream choices of players at present. But pills and refining It is very difficult to obtain the materials for the weapon.</p>

    <p>So in the early stage of the game, choose chef as a sub-career to start, and sell it by cooking. After earning funds, you can find a way to change your job to become an alchemist or an alchemist. It is also a path of steady progress.</p>

    <p>Lao Huang and Sun Rong spent a long time choosing together. There were many people who came, but the number of people they liked was very limited. There is a difference between choosing to stay in Fuyun Town for development and being directly recruited into Wolong.</p>

    <p>The town recruitment mode and the guild recruitment seem to be similar, but in fact there are essential differences in treatment. The guild is owned by the president. Whether the distribution in the guild is balanced or not depends entirely on the conscience of the president.</p>

    <p>The Wolongs who are recruited into the town will fairly distribute their income based on their contribution to the town. As long as you invest enough energy, you will never be treated badly.</p>

    <p>This is also the reason why many players want to be recruited into Crouching Dragon. There is no other reason.</p>

    <p>Just two words: fair!</p>

    <p>Fair!</p>

    <p>Yes. Fair!</p>

    <p>At this moment. A group of shadows in the sky covered the queue of players below. A group of beautiful white Pegasus came into view. At the same time, a village man riding an armored griffon caught the eye. husband player.</p>

    <p>"Excuse me. Is the Wolong Recruitment Office here?" The handsome young man on the white horse asked with a smile.</p>

    <p>Everyone was attracted by the two men's mounts.</p>

    <p>Being able to control flying mounts is enough to prove that the levels of these two players are not low. At least they have reached level 50 or above.</p>

    <p>Are even level 50 players coming here to apply for jobs?</p>

    <p>Many players in the queue couldn't help but secretly complain. This is too involuntarily involved!</p>

    <p>Lao Huang stood up and looked at the two people with squinted eyes. He felt that the two people looked familiar...</p>

    <p>Isn't this...the president of the White Horse Guild and the Yamano Villagers Guild?!</p>

    <p>Old Huang was shocked.</p>
