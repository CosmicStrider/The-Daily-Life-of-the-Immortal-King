  <h1>Chapter 1374 Boss Sun's fan filter</h1>

  <div>

    <p>He was excited. But after Mr. Boss Sun calmed down, he still realized Wang Ling's intention from Wang Ling's essay "The Great Way to Simplicity."</p>

    <p>This is a national-level competition. This essay is creative, but it is too risky.</p>

    <p>And with the personality of classmate Wang Ling, it is not his personality to participate in the national essay competition.</p>

    <p>In all likelihood, it was probably the Chinese teacher at school who forced him out.</p>

    <p>So is it possible that classmate Wang Ling never wanted to win the award from the beginning?</p>

    <p>Boss Sun frowned: "Xiaoche. Are you saying that classmate Wang Ling. doesn't want to win the championship at all?"</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche carefully tried to figure out the meaning of Boss Sun's words. The old man's current "fan filter" was too strong. Jiang Xiaoche knew that he had to adjust his attitude towards Wang Ling as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>Even if he is dissatisfied with Wang Ling, he still has to follow the old man's wishes in front of Boss Sun. Otherwise, it will be too late when Boss Sun finds him objectionable.</p>

    <p>"I'm afraid it is, sir." Jiang Xiaoche nodded regretfully. Then he began to observe Boss Sun's reaction.</p>

    <p>"Is that really true..."</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan first showed a look of pity, and then let out a long sigh: "But... this essay is really well written!"</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche: "..."</p>

    <p>To be honest, if Sun Yiyuan didn't still have some sense, he would have given Wang Ling a full score of 60 points for this essay!</p>

    <p>But in order to take care of Wang Ling's feelings at the same time.</p>

    <p>In the end, Mr. Boss Sun did not give a specific score for the essay review.</p>

    <p>Instead, the composition was submitted directly to the "New Concept Creative Library."</p>

    <p>The reward mechanism for this national competition is actually very rich.</p>

    <p>For some essays that break through the style of exam-oriented essays, they do not need to be graded according to the scores of exam-oriented essays. They will be selected for the "New Concept Essay Award."</p>

    <p>This award is not a championship award. It does not attract that much attention. But it is also a national award. Mr. Boss Sun feels that with this award, Wang Ling is enough to give an explanation to his Chinese teacher.</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan's idea coincided with that of several others. In addition, Lord Diulei, Zhuo Yi was behind the scenes to smooth the relationship.</p>

    <p>Wang Ling's Wang Ling essay on {{Single}}. There is almost no suspense about winning the New Concept Essay Award.</p>

    <p>Sun Yiyuan used his mobile phone to take pictures of Wang Ling's composition. Although the composition only had four words, the more he looked at these four beautiful words, the more he liked them.</p>

    <p>"What is the name of classmate Wang Ling's Chinese teacher? Do you know?" Sun Yiyuan asked.</p>

    <p>"Called Guan Ziqian." Jiang Xiaoche quickly replied.</p>

    <p>"Very good." Sun Yiyuan nodded: "You will inform Principal Chen later. Send a commendation order to Teacher Guan."</p>

    <p>"Commendation... order?"</p>

    <p>"To be able to teach such an excellent classmate Wang Ling. Teacher Guan must be an excellent person too!"</p>

    <p>Mr. Boss Sun stared intently at the photos taken on his phone. He was deeply intoxicated.</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche: "..."</p>

    <p>"Wonderful, wonderful! This word is written wonderfully! Xiaoche. Go and print this picture. I want to frame it and keep it."</p>

    <p>Boss Sun said: "From now on, when recruiting new employees of Huaguo Shuilian Group, anyone who can write in beautiful thin gold fonts will give me 10 points in the comprehensive evaluation."</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>At this time, the expression on Jiang Xiaoche's face was complicated.</p>

    <p>He didn't know what magic spell Wang Ling had used on Boss Sun.</p>

    <p>He can actually make this old man who always handles things calmly have such a thick fan filter!</p>

    <p>When Wang Ling went to the aquarium before, Jiang Xiaoche secretly planned a plan to trip up Wang Ling. However, he had not found a good opportunity.</p>

    <p>And now, Jiang Xiaoche feels like she can't bear it anymore.</p>

    <p>He must expose the "nature" of Wang Ling!</p>

    <p>Let Mr. Boss Sun see clearly who is the most suitable person for Sun Rong!</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>The entire plan is divided into two parts.</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche will start with Wang Ling and Sun Rong respectively.</p>

    <p>Reveal the "nature" of Wang Ling. And improve Sun Rong's favorability towards himself!</p>

    <p>Huaguo Shuilian Group's backend AI intelligent system "Wukong" created good conditions for Jiang Xiaoche to implement the plan. This intelligent system was originally used for customer big data calculations.</p>

    <p>It is similar to the "guess you like" function developed by some shopping platforms by obtaining customers' focus when browsing products.</p>

    <p>The "Wukong System" can automatically push various elixirs produced by Huaguo Shuilian Group to potential customers based on customers' browsing needs.</p>

    <p>But now. Jiang Xiaoche plans to use the Wukong system to do other things.</p>

    <p>[Fish-eye], [Frigid], [Sulky], [Emotionless], [Loves to steal other people's women]...</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche inputs all the tags he thinks about Wang Ling into the Wukong system.</p>

    <p>Soon, the system's electronic voice prompt came: "Dear Mr. Jiang. Xiao Kong has recommended a local girl in Songhai City for you. Please check it out."</p>

    <p>According to system speculation, the match between this girl and Wang Ling is as high as 87%. She is the type that Wang Ling may like!</p>

    <p>"Successful!" Jiang Xiaoche secretly rejoiced.</p>

    <p>He clicked on the girl's information.</p>

    <p>The girl in the photo has fresh short hair, her skin is as white as jade, and she is cute and charming.</p>

    <p>She looks very young, but in fact she is a senior professional escort expert!</p>

    <p>Specializing in providing wine-stopping services in hotels for bosses in shopping malls!</p>

    <p>"It's interesting. I didn't expect classmate Wang Ling to like such a coquettish type."</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche nodded with satisfaction.</p>

    <p>Then. He quickly followed the information provided by the system.</p>

    <p>I called this girl.</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche: "Hello. Is this Miss Su Yu? I want to ask you for something."</p>

    <p>"It's nothing serious. I just want you to help me flirt with a boy... What? Showing off your skills rather than selling yourself? No! I don't need you to sell yourself..."</p>

    <p>"Do you understand the boyfriend loyalty test?"</p>

    <p>"Yes! It's just a test!"</p>

    <p>"The pay is very high! I hope you will consider it!"</p>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>So that night. Wang Ling suddenly received a very strange friend adding message.</p>

    <p>This is a girl whom Wang Ling does not know at all.</p>

    <p>The friend request description column reads: "Classmate Wang Ling! I am in trouble. Please add me. I have something important to tell you!"</p>

    <p>"..."</p>

    <p>Wang Ling stared at the girl's profile picture for a few seconds.</p>

    <p>He searched the memories in his mind and confirmed that there was no such person in Number 60 High School and among all the people he had come into contact with.</p>

    <p>However, the other party actually called his classmate Wang Ling.</p>

    <p>Maybe from another school?</p>

    <p>No...</p>

    <p>It may or may not be an information leak.</p>

    <p>Jiang Xiaoche calculated well. But he didn't calculate it. Wang Ling actually doesn't have the habit of adding strangers.</p>

    <p>He didn't even bother to ask the girl what was going on.</p>

    <p>Then this "strange girl" was included in the blacklist...</p>

    <p>If you are in trouble, you should go find the police!</p>

    <p>Why are you looking for him...</p>

    <p>It also delayed his online classes!</p>

    <p>(I just woke up... there will be updates later. Try to send a little candy today? Hehehehe)</p>
